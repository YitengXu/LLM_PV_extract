    , Accepted 28th September 2021First published on 29th September 2021AbstractThe existence of high defect density in the interface region limits further promotion of perovskite photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. Surface termination of perovskite films alters the interfacial electronic states, which are responsible for the carrier dynamics and physical and chemical properties of the interface. Therefore, suitable termination design is beneficial to the photoelectric performance and operational stability. Here, guanidinium thiocyanate (GASCN) was selected to modify the surface terminations of methylamine lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films by taking advantage of its strong bonding capacity and increased hydrogen-bonding interactions with the [PbI6]4− octahedron. Firstly, to select an effective solvent to introduce GASCN onto the surface of MAPbI3, multiple solvents with varied polarity were tested to carefully examine their effects on the perovskite active layer in consideration of their scouring or polar erosion effect. Secondly, the surface matrix is formed after thermal annealing due to the strong chemical bonding between GA+ and the perovskite surface. The strong surface bonding immobilizes the anion (I−) and reduces its migration, so suppressing the hysteresis behavior of the assembled device. As well, the surface matrix blocks invasion of moisture and oxygen from the atmosphere and thus improves the long-term stability of assembled devices.
1. Introduction
Perovskite materials have been extensively explored since they are successfully applied in thin-film photovoltaic cells, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed to 25.5%,1–4 surpassing all other thin film solar cells.5 The rapid progress in PCE has been attributed to superior photoelectronic properties, such as high light absorbance, low exciton binding energy, long carrier diffusion length and high defect tolerance.6–10 Further enhancement in perovskite photoelectric performance mainly focuses on the Voc (open-circuit voltage) because the Voc deficit is usually larger than 450 mV, making Voc significantly lower than the corresponding Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit even though the short-circuit current density (Jsc) often approaches the S–Q limit.11–13 Therefore, reducing the gap between Voc and the bandgap (Eg) is the main area of focus to effectively promote the solar cell efficiency.
A few strategies have been developed to raise the photovoltage without sacrificing the photocurrent. Forming an ultrathin wide band-gap semiconductor film on the top surface of the perovskite layer14–18 and defect passivation19–23 are two popular strategies: for the former, a thin superficial layer with a wide bandgap imparts a larger Fermi level split, resulting in a larger Voc; for the latter, enhancement in Voc is attributed to the reduced defect state density because the defects are responsible for non-radiative recombination and degrade the photovoltage, which can be expressed as:, where KB is the Boltzmann constant, EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence, T is the Kelvin temperature, and e is the elementary charge.24–27 In semiconductor photovoltaic devices, the defect capture capacity depends on the capture cross-section, which is related to the defect concentration and defect type.28,29 These grain-boundary defects and crystallographic defects with deep defect energy levels lead to more serious carrier capture and recombination.30,31 Therefore, the fewer the deep defect states, the higher the photo-voltage. Both of the above-mentioned techniques change the surface termination, and thus they change the interfacial electronic states to reduce the number of dangling bonds or surface defect complexes. To employ these techniques, a suitable solvent is required to disperse the additives to construct the wide band gap layer or passivate the surface defects. Ethyl acetate (EA), isopropanol (IPA), and chlorobenzene (CB) are often adopted for this purpose,32–36 and alcohol, methyl benzoate and anisole have been probed as greener anti-solvents.35,37,38 Although anti-solvents have been employed, there are no systematic studies on the effects of the polarity of anti-solvents on the dissolution and re-crystallization processes of perovskite crystals.39 This is especially true for two-step interfacial engineering, which involves solvent erosion or induced growth, possibly thermal annealing treatment, and a small quantity of additive, making it intricate to distinguish the true function of the additive because, in most cases, medium-polarity solvents are employed to dissolve the additive due to their poor solubility in low-polarity anti-solvents. In addition, guanidinium (GA) has been widely employed in organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskite films to advance their photoelectric performance because it forms more hydrogen bonds,34,40–45 leading to stronger bonding between the A sites and [PbI6]4− octahedron compared to formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA), thus stabilizing the structure, especially under external stimuli such as heat or light. Therefore, GA was introduced into the organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskite systems via one-step precursor solution or two-step anti-solvent treatment. As well, Ma's group recently reported a surface ligand-exchange strategy to decorate the perovskite quantum dot films by GASCN treatment, which induces the formation of a surface matrix due to the GA cation with large capacity for hydrogen bonds.43 Additionally, the counteracting anions impact the functional mechanism of the GA cation. The SCN anion is a strong bridging group for coordination bonding that can coordinate with Pb.40,46–49
Anti-solvent treatment has been proven as a significant strategy to control the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite.42 In this paper, a series of solvents with (high, medium, low) polarity were selected to wash the perovskite to systematically reveal their effects on the surface topography and phase components. Considering the anti-solvent erosion and dissolution of additives in anti-solvent, we employed GASCN with CB as the anti-solvent to alter the surface termination of MAPbI3 to improve the carrier extraction and transport at the interface thus raising the photoelectric performance of the MAPbI3 system. Compared with MA, there is a stronger bonding capacity between the GA and [PbI6]4− octahedron due to the formation of more hydrogen bonds. In addition, these hydrogen bonds between the GA+ and terminated I− construct a surface matrix, which immobilizes the lattice ion and suppresses their migration. As well, the formation of the surface matrix slows the perovskite film degradation, thus enhancing the long-term stability of assembled photovoltaic cells. In addition, surface treatment effectively reduces the trap state density and boosts the PCE of the assembled photovoltaic cells.
2. Results and discussion
The light-active layers of MAPbI3 were deposited using a one-step anti-solvent spin-coating method and subsequent surface termination modification, as depicted in Fig. 1a. In all perovskite systems, high-polarity solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a polarity of 7.2 and N,N-dimethylaniline (DMF) with a polarity of 6.4 have been preferred to dissolve the raw material to form uniform precursor solutions. Therefore, post-processing solvents must be carefully chosen to avoid destruction of the grain morphology and phase components. In this paper, we compared the effects of several anti-solvents with various polarities and evaporation rates, which are related to the boiling points and viscosity. Ethyl acetate (EA), i-propanol (IPA), chlorobenzene (CB) and cyclohexane (CH) are suggested as the representative anti-solvents. Their boiling points and polarities are plotted in Fig. 1b. Fig. 1d exhibits the SEM morphologies of perovskite films treated by different solvents. “Pristine” denotes that the film had no post-solvent washing. These solvents with high evaporation rate and low polarity have little impact on the surface appearance of annealed perovskite films. With higher polarity, solvents produce much stronger erosion: for example, EA and IPA will smash the large grains into smaller grains; IPA, especially, is much more destructive to the grains and increases the grain boundary gap because of its longer dwelling time as a result of its higher viscosity compared with EA with similar polarity. By contrast, CH and CB cause weaker erosion resulting from their low polarity. In order to differentiate the effects of the post heat treatment from those of the functional additives, SEM images of the pristine with post-heat treatment were acquired. We found that simple post-heat treatment can also promote grain growth. CH and CB post-treatments have similar grain growth trends. As for the IPA and EA, the erosion caused by the polar solvents possibly concealed the grain growth during the thermal treatment. We explored the crystallization variance and phase purity by analyzing the XRD patterns in Fig. 1c, and found that the intensity of the PbI2 peak became stronger, especially after IPA treatment, and thus an anti-solvent with high polarity not only dissolves the perovskite grains but also decomposes the perovskite material. CB balances the dissolution of surface passivation agents and causes little erosion of the surface appearance and grains, and it can be widely applied. CH may be regarded as the best anti-solvent because it causes the least dissolution of the perovskite grains, but this is accompanied by low dissolution of the usual additives, such as ionic compounds or polar molecules. Thus, for subsequent treatment, CB has been chosen as the most effective anti-solvent.

MAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are regarded as two typical organic–inorganic hybrid and all-inorganic perovskite materials for light-harvesting materials.50 Other hybrid perovskite structures, such as FAPbI3 and GAPbI3 are derived from MAPbI3 in which FA is produced by replacing the hydrogen in C–H with an –NH2 group, and further replacing the hydrogen in C–H with another –NH2 group results in the formation of GA.48 Substitution of more hydrogen gives rise to gradual increase in ionic radii and tolerance factors (t), as exhibited in Fig. 2a. The t can be expressed as in eqn (1):51 (1)where the ri is the ionic radii of each ion for the ABX3 perovskite structure. More hydrogen bonds between the organic cations and [PbI6]4− octahedrons cause much stronger bonding; however, the large volume resulting from more hydrogen bonds induces phase instability or instability of the 3D perovskite structure due to the organic cations being incapable of fitting in the cages formed by the [PbI6]4− octahedrons. For example, FAPbI3 favors the face-sharing “double chain” 1D phase under ambient conditions. GAPbI3 with a larger tolerance factor of 1.03, beyond the suitable range, brings about disruption of the 3D network of [PbI6]4− octahedrons to a low-dimensional yellow phase structure.42,52 Nevertheless, it was reported that a trace amount of GA can occupy the substitutional sites to stabilize the light-active black phase by relaxing the lattice strain and forming strong hydrogen bonding.42 DFT (Density Functional Theory) simulation pointed out that GA can positively firm the inorganic Pb–I lattice and decrease the formation of defects.44 As well, GA can form strong hydrogen bonds with the neighboring [PbI6]4− octahedral building blocks to suppress the phase transition in CsPbI3 or FAPbI3 films. In this work, GASCN was introduced to cross-link the grains to accelerate the charge transport between the grains.53 At the same time, GA can bond with the dangling I by forming hydrogen bonds to deactivate the surface reactive sites. The possible mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 2b. Furthermore, the effects of post-treatment on the surface composition and electronic states of MAPbI3 were investigated by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and the resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 2c. The peaks located at 138.1 and 143.9 eV were assigned to Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2, respectively, for the film without any treatment.54,55 They shift toward higher binding energies as a result of the formation of stronger ionic bonding between Pb2+ and GA with GA modification. The XPS peaks of I have a similar shift, illustrating interaction between I and GA. The shift of the N peak is due to the existence of its double bond in GA, which has a lower binding energy. There is no observable signal from sulfur by XPS, which is in accordance with the recent report by Pham et al., who proposed that the possible reactive process can be expressed as in eqn (2):41 CH3NH3PbI3 + GASCN → (GAI + PbI2) + (CH3NH2(g) + HSCN(g))(2)

The interactions were further probed by collecting the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) transmission spectra of PbI2 and GASCN and MA and GASCN precursor solutions plotted in Fig. 2d. The characteristic stretching vibration peak of SCN− in GASCN is located at 2059 and 1663 cm−1. Both the mixtures of GASCN and PbI2 and GASCN and MAI give observable shifts, evidencing the reaction between them. We performed structural and optoelectronic characterization of MAPbI3 perovskite films with GASCN post-treatment. The enhancement in film quality via GASCN surface modification was the result of the known effect of SCN ions increasing the grain size and improving the film morphology, as evidenced in Fig. 3a.41,46 Grain sizes were effectively measured to clearly see the trend (Fig. 3b). Grain sizes in Fig. 3b were derived from SEM, several SEM images were selected for each sample, and 200 grains were counted by particle size distribution calculation software, and then statistical graphs were made to calculate the average grain size. We list more details in ESI Fig. S2.† With the GASCN modification, the MAPbI3 perovskite films contain larger grains and fewer gaps at grain boundaries, which are attributed to Ostwald ripening induced by the SCN ion. The enhanced crystallization of perovskite films by GASCN surface modification was further confirmed by the XRD patterns in Fig. 3c. Then, the luminescence properties were investigated by acquiring the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra displayed in Fig. 3d. The PL peak intensity strengthened with the surface modification, and the S1 perovskite exhibited the highest luminescence intensity, implying the best film quality with the least non-radiative recombination pathways. The PL quenching in the S2 and S3 samples suggests incomplete passivation compared with S1. Next, the intrinsic charge dynamics were probed by analyzing the time-resolved PL spectra in Fig. 3e. The PL lifetimes are analyzed by bi-exponential fitting, and the relative parameters are listed in Table S2.† All average recombination lifetimes of the films with surface modification are extended, suggesting that these films have suppressed unwelcome species or sites. We observed that the carrier lifetime of sample S1 is 52.992 ns, which is two times longer than that of the control sample with 22.095 ns. In addition, we noted that the percentage of the short carrier lifetime reduced after the surface modification, indicating fewer trapped states at the surface of the perovskite films and suggesting surface modification is an effective strategy to reduce the carrier recombination and accelerate the carrier transport behavior. For the long carrier lifetime, it can be assigned to quenching of the electron and hole by the bi-molecular radiative recombination process and the surface recombination process is attributed to the defect-assisted monomolecular recombination process. To further evidence this, we prepared electron-only devices to measure their electronic properties. As exhibited in Fig. 3f, three regions (ohmic region, trap-filled region and trap-free region) can be distinguished in the dark current–voltage curves.9 The concentration of the trap states can be calculated based on eqn (3): (3)where VTFL is the trap-filled limited voltage, L is the film thickness, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the electron charge and ε is the relative dielectric constant. We note that the concentrations of the trap states are positively correlated with VTFL. Therefore, lower VTFL indicates smaller trap density. The decreased trap density leads to efficient charge extraction at the surface, and thus reduces the energy loss, which enhances the Voc and FF. We observed that the VTFL decreased from 0.51 V to 0.31 V with GASCN modification as a result of the reduced defect concentration. To investigate PV characterization with the surface termination design, solar cells were completed with the structure glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 (50 nm)/perovskite films (450 nm)/(Spiro-OMeTAD, 70 nm)/Au (80 nm). The detailed device fabrication processes are presented in the Experimental section. Each constituent layer of the device is clearly resolved in the cross-sectional SEM image in the inset of Fig. 4a. The typical photoelectric performances are compared in Fig. 4a, and detailed photovoltaic (PV) parameters are supplied in Table 1. The PCE improved from 20.14% to 21.26% because of increases in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). One of the best MAPbI3 PSCs has a Voc of 1.154 V, with a photovoltage deficit of 0.426 V. To demonstrate the reliability and repeatability, we have plotted the statistics of the pivotal photovoltaic parameters of the different devices in Fig. 4b. We confirmed that the improved performance of S1 devices is attributed to increased Voc and FF, and the short circuit current Jsc has only a slight fluctuation with treatment. At the same time, the parameters of device S1 are distributed in a narrow range, illustrating better reproducibility. The ion migration is connected to the hysteresis effect estimated by the hysteresis index defined as H-index = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse. The existence of ion migration also contributes to the current, resulting in unreliable results. Specifically, external bias voltage accelerates the ion migration. We found that the S1 device has the smallest hysteresis index, while the control device shows serious hysteresis behavior, as shown in Fig. 4c, demonstrating that the control device has more ion migration channels, such as through vacancies or interstitials at the surface of the perovskite films. The reduced hysteresis indexes imply suppressed ion migration, illustrating that the GA modification is effective in immobilizing the ions. This may be ascribed to the stronger bonding ability of GA with the Pb–I network compared with MA. In addition, GA, with more hydrogen bonds, is beneficial to the cross-linking of the grains to promote carrier transport. Assembled devices without and with GASCN modification were tracked at room temperature with 30% relative humidity. The steady power output and the steady current output with devices biased at the initial maximum power point voltage for 240 s are shown in Fig. 4d. Both devices have a fast light response and reach the maximum point in short order. The control device has a slight decline with continued light soaking, while the optimized device shows a much more stable output. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are employed to confirm the Jsc values extracted from the J–V curves. The conversion ratio of extracted electrons to incident photons at a specified wavelength and the integrated current values are displayed in Fig. 4e. The integrated value falls within 5% of the Jsc determined from the J–V curves, illustrating the reliability of the Jsc measurement.

As mentioned earlier, the performance improvement is attributed to the increased Voc and FF. To better reveal the underlying details of these improvements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to illustrate the charge-carrier dynamics including the carrier extraction and recombination processes. The equivalent circuit diagram is shown in Fig. S8.† The fitting parameters are summarized in Table S3.† The recombination resistance (Rrec) for the modified device is ∼2.52 times that of the pristine device. The higher Rrec of the modified device further illustrates the longer carrier diffusion length, benefiting from the reduction of surface trap states.
The devices were evaluated by determining the ideality factor (n) from measurements of the photovoltaic voltage as a function of light intensity. The value of n can be deduced from the equation , where Eg represents the band gap of the light-harvesting material, q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, I is the incident light intensity and I0 is the saturation current. In principle, the slope of Vocversus light intensity approaches kT/q when less Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is involved. Therefore, higher n implies more defect-assisted-recombination centers. From Fig. 4g, we observed that the ideality factor declines from 2.359 to 1.488 with surface modification. These results further demonstrate that GASCN treatment is effective in passivating the surface defects. Furthermore, we found that the built-in voltage increases based on the Mott–Schottky method. The enhanced built-in voltage means higher capacity to separate the photogenerated carriers, thus giving rise to higher Voc. Next, we performed long-term stability tests for 20 assembled devices for 1000 hours. Encouragingly, the PCE of modified devices degraded on average to ∼80% of their initial PCE, exceeding the control device (60%) after storing in air with a relative humidity of 20%. The improved stability benefits from the reduced reactive sites and ion migration, relieving the possible reactive processes of the perovskite devices with the atmosphere. To further study the perovskite stability, perovskite films with and without GASCN treatment were subjected to extreme conditions with a high 80–90% relative humidity and high heat treatment at 85 °C, separately, to reveal the resistance to the humidity and heat stresses. Their evolutions were tracked by XRD measurements taken at different times. The presence of PbI2 as the thermal decomposition product was regarded as the rule to evaluate the stability. We compared the XRD spectra of perovskite films without and with the GASCN modification in Fig. 5a, and both have a PbI2 peak after thermal treatment for 12 hours. Subsequently, the peak became gradually stronger. A large amount of PbI2 was produced and visible yellow areas appeared after 96 hours of thermal treatment for the control sample. Comparatively speaking, the films with the surface modification have better stability with fewer yellow areas. The intensity ratios of the PbI2 peak and the (110) peak of MAPbI3 also reveal a much more serious decomposition for the control film. Differing from the heat stress behavior, there are two obvious hydrate peaks at the low angles marked by inverted triangles in the spectrum of the control film after 16 hours of storage in high humidity, as seen in Fig. 5b, which can be assigned to MA4PbI6·2H2O. Conversely, the films with GASCN modification have no obvious hydrate peaks, and only a slight PbI2 peak appeared after water vapor exposure for 30 hours. This may be because the surface modification with GASCN resulted in the formation of a surface network due to cross-linking driven by GA, which thus blocked the intrusion of undesired molecules.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the effects of anti-solvents with high-, medium-, and low-polarity on the erosion and phase components of perovskite films. The anti-solvents with high polarity lead to obvious dissolution and phase decomposition of the perovskite films. The lower evaporation rate of the anti-solvent resulted in much more serious erosion, such as by EA and IPA with similar polarity. CH, with the lowest polarity, has a faint effect on the perovskite grains, and the perovskite film also exhibited excellent resistance to CH anti-solvent. CB, as a medium polarity anti-solvent, balances the dissolution of the additive with low erosion of the perovskite grains and can be widely adopted. In this work, GASCN dissolved in CB is chosen to modify the perovskite surface termination. Combining the enlargement of the grain size due to SCN− and the formation of a surface matrix by GA+, the perovskite material quality has been improved. A 21.26% PCE was acquired for a solar cell based on the MAPbI3 system, and the voltage deficit is reduced to 0.426 V. As well, the hysteresis is suppressed due to the cross-linking of GA, which reduced ion migration. Meanwhile, the humidity and thermal stability are significantly enhanced due to the formation of the surface matrix.
4. Experimental section
Chemicals
Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP), and chlorobenzene were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. Guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN, 99%), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I MAI. 99.5%), and Spiro-OMeTAD [2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene] were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All the chemicals were used without further purification.
Preparing the compact TiO2 layer
TiO2 was deposited on a glass (25 × 25 mm) substrate coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). FTO glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with distilled water, acetone and ethanol for 30 min and then dried with N2. Then, the clean FTO glasses were treated under ultraviolet light and ozone for ∼10 min. The TiO2 layer was deposited by immersing FTO glass substrates in 200 mL aqueous solution with 4.5 mL titanium tetrachloride for 60 min at ∼70 °C. Finally, the FTO substrates coated with TiO2 were washed with distilled water and ethanol, followed by drying with N2.
Light-activated layer deposition and device assembly
The precursor solution was prepared as follows: 1.2 mmol CH3NH3I and 1.2 mmol PbI2 were dissolved in a 1 mL mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (with the volume ratio of 9:1) and then stirred at 60 °C for more than 6 hours to obtain a clear, light-yellow solution. The GuSCN saturated solution was prepared by dissolving GuSCN in 5 mL chlorobenzene and stirring at 80 °C for 12 hours. Then, the solutions were filtered through a 0.24 μm pore PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) syringe filter before spin-coating. The reference perovskite thin film was spin-coated onto the FTO glass substrates by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 and 40 s, respectively. Note that 300 μL ethyl acetate was dripped as an anti-solvent 15 s after the second stage began to obtain a light-brown smooth perovskite thin film. Then, the substrates underwent a pre-heating treatment at 130 °C for 5 minutes on a hotplate. Subsequently, the substrates were heated at 150 °C for 20 minutes to obtain the final perovskite films. Similarly, the as-prepared GuSCN saturated solutions with different concentrations were deposited on the MAPbI3 perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 30 s followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min to form the TiO2/perovskite/GuSCN structure. After cooling the perovskite thin film, the spiro-OMeTAD solution with a concentration of 90 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the perovskite films at 5000 rpm for 30 s. It is noted that 22 μL Li-TFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 36 μL tBP were added to the spiro-OMeTAD solution for the sake of improving the carrier mobility and electrical conductivity of the thin film. The samples were kept in a desiccator overnight to promote the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD. Each perovskite device was finally assembled by deposition of a metal electrode of 80 nm-thick gold by thermal evaporation under a high vacuum of 10−4 Pa.
Characterization
The phase purities of the perovskite films were analyzed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD; DX-2700) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5416 Å). The absorption spectra of the absorbing layers on TiO2-coated FTO were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer). The morphologies of the perovskite films were investigated using field-emission scanning-electron microscopy (FESEM; SU-8020, Hitachi). An atomic force microscope (AFM; MULTIMODE 8, Bruker) was used to image the topography and to measure the surface roughness in peak force mode. The J–V characteristics of assembled solar cell devices without encapsulation were investigated using a SourceMeter (2400, Keithley) under simulated sunlight illumination generated by a solar simulator (XES-40S2-CE, San-Ei Electric, AM 1.5G filter at 100 mW cm−2), which was calibrated using a certified silicon photodiode. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the PSCs were recorded using a QTest Station 2000ADI system (Crowntech Inc.). EIS analysis was performed on a Zahner Electrochemical Workstation. XPS and UPS of the perovskite films were carried out using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded on an F-7000 (Shimadzu, Japan) with a 150 W halogen tungsten lamp as the light source. TRPL spectra were measured with a PicoQuant FluoQuant 300.
