    , Accepted 2nd October 2012First published on 4th October 2012AbstractMesoporous TiO2 with a large specific surface area (∼150 m2 g−1) is the most successful material in dye-sensitized solar cells so far; however, its inferior charge mobility is a major efficiency limiter. This paper demonstrates that random nanowires of Ni-doped TiO2 (Ni:TiO2) have a dramatic influence on the particulate and charge transport properties. Nanowires (dia ∼60 nm) of Ni:TiO2 with a specific surface area of ∼80 m2 g−1 were developed by an electrospinning technique. The band gap of the Ni:TiO2 shifted to the visible region upon doping of 5 at% Ni atoms. The Mott–Schottky analysis shows that the flat band potential of Ni:TiO2 shifts to a more negative value than the undoped samples. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements showed that the Ni:TiO2 offer lower charge transport resistance, higher charge recombination resistance, and enhanced electron lifetime compared to the undoped samples. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the Ni:TiO2 nanowires showed an enhanced photoconversion efficiency and short-circuit current density compared to the undoped analogue. The transient photocurrent measurements showed that the Ni:TiO2 has improved charge mobility compared with TiO2 and is several orders of magnitude higher compared to the P25 particles.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have emerged as a low-cost renewable energy device due to several advantages such as simple fabrication technique and promising photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η).1–4 The one-dimensional (1D) current density (J) of DSCs, in general for any electronic device, is given by J = nμ(x)∇Fn, where n is the electron density, μ(x) is the 1D electron mobility, and ∇Fn is the gradient in the Fermi levels of the material across which the electrons flow.5,6 In DSCs, the ∇Fn is achieved by fabricating a combination of a dye-sensitized metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) with a large band gap (≥3.0 eV) characterized by a higher Fermi energy (Fn1) and an electrolyte of lower electrochemical potential energy (Fn2). The maximum photovoltage, defined as the open circuit voltage (VOC), attainable from DSCs is therefore proportional to the difference in the above two energies, i.e., VOCα(Fn1−Fn2) and the maximum photocurrent driven by the photovoltage, defined as the short circuit current density (JSC), is scaled by a factor nμ(x). The intensity of solar energy at the absorption wavelength window of most MOS is rather weak but this limitation is overcome by chemically bonding organic or inorganic fluorophores (dyes) with the MOS such that the resultant conjugate has a wider absorption wavelength window. As the amount of dye bonded on the MOS determines the n, nanostructured MOS particles with a large specific surface area is essential to allow the loading of a large amount of dye, which has been successfully implemented two decades ago by Reagan et al.7 using mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) particles. Intense research during the past two decades brought the DSCs to a level of delivering η ∼ 12% in single cells8 and ∼9% in sub-modules9 using mesoporous TiO2 particles, inorganic dyes (porphyrin dyes, for example), and suitable electrolytes.
The currently achieved η of DSCs is only 35% of the Shockley–Queisser theoretical limiting efficiency of 31% for single junction solar cells. i.e., although the p–n junctions built using single crystalline silicon has achieved over 90% of the theoretical limit10 the DSCs are still far behind.
One of the major hurdles for achieving a higher efficiency in DSCs is that an inverse relationship exists between two important properties of the device, viz. the specific surface area of the MOS and the μ through it. On one hand, a high specific surface area achieved through reducing the particle size of TiO2 to ∼20–25 nm enables the loading a large amount of dye thereby achieving high n. On the other hand, the electron energy loss and subsequent thermalization of photo-induced carriers during transport through the m-TiO2 electrode limits its thickness to only a few microns, thereby limiting the material loading, for efficient charge collection.
The inefficient transport occurs as a result of differences in the band structure of m-TiO2 compared to that of the bulk. Fig. 1 shows a schematic on the difference in charge transport mechanisms between the bulk and the m-TiO2. The energy gap is completely forbidden in the bulk TiO2 whereas in mesoporous particles it is characterized by a broad distribution of localized energy states11–13 that arise as a result of deviation of equilibrium atomic coordinates.14,15 Density of those localized states is higher at the bottom of the conduction band and exponentially decreases in the energy scale towards the Fermi level. The photogenerated electrons in the m-TiO2 are trapped by the localized states and subsequent thermal activation leads the electrons to deeper energy levels and they become re-traped again. The injected carriers thus move via a trap–detrap, otherwise called multiple trapping (MT), through the band gap.12 In addition, bulk materials could support an electric field on account of a space charge region which would further accelerate the electrons; whereas the space charge is completely depleted in the case of nanomaterials (≤25 nm) and could not support a macroscopic electric field.16 Therefore, the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) and hence the μ are typically less by several orders of magnitude than the corresponding bulk material.
 Fig. 1  Schematics showing the difference in charge diffusion mechanism between (A) bulk single crystalline semiconductors and (B) nanocrystalline semiconductors. The top panel shows the difference in the periodic arrangement of atoms between single crystalline and nanocrystalline materials and the bottom panel denotes the difference in their band structures. The EC and EF denote the conduction band and Fermi energies, respectively. The circles represent electrons. The charge transport through semiconductors is controlled by phonons and by pairing of electron–phonon coupling, known as polarons. The solid arrow in (A) denotes the hopping of electrons through the bulk transport state (ETRB); the dashed line in (B) indicates the transport through the band gap states (ETRN). The difference in the electron diffusion coefficient between the two types of materials is indicated in the schematics. The unit cell shown is that of anatase TiO2, whose typical diffusion coefficients are noted in the figures. 
The inferior μ affects the configuration and hence the performance of the DSCs directly. For example, a typical electron (MOS)–hole (electrolyte) recombination time in DSCs is ∼10−6 s, which requires faster electron mobility for efficient charge collection. The distance travelled by electrons before recombining with the electrolyte is known as the diffusion length, L = (Dnτ)1/2, where τ is the electron lifetime, a crucial device parameter. Thus, owing to the inferior μ through the m-TiO2, photoelectrons from only a small thickness of the film (12–15 μm) are collected in the state of the art DSC. As dyes are the primary absorbers in DSCs which convert photons into electrons, their amount can be increased only if a material with a large specific surface area and μ – such that the L is high – occupies the position of the photoanode. Several promising approaches have been adopted for this purpose viz. (i) use of ordered17–19 as well as disordered 1D nanostructures20,21 on account of directed charge transport, (ii) use of composite electrodes as well as core/shell structures to suppress electron recombination during transport, and (iii) suitable doping of TiO2 to engineer the band structure that results in high Dn and μ.22 A number of dopants such as Nb, Zr, have been tested in TiO2 to favor enhanced charge transport parameters, a detailed account of which can be found elsewhere.14,23 One of the serious problems that arises during doping with elements of higher molecular weight is the loss of specific surface area and dye-loading in addition to lattice strain that contributes to electron recombination.24 Moreover, the heavy metal dopants in TiO2 have shown to result in delocalized energy states lying within the band gap; but Ni dopants are somewhat delocalized and significantly contributing to the formation of valence bands with p (O) and 3d (Ti) electrons.25 We have now screened the suitability of Ni2+ ions as a substituent for Ti4+ and found beneficial effects in the DSC performances. We note that Ni doped TiO2 (Ni:TiO2) showed increased surface area26 and photo-catalytic properties27 in previous studies. Also, the application of a TiO2/NiO composite as an electrode in DSCs is reported with enhanced photoconversion efficiency.28 The Ni:TiO2 developed in this study, as nanowires, showed larger flat-band potentials, lower transport resistance, higher electron recombination resistance and lifetime compared to the undoped TiO2 as well as conventional Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the Ni:TiO2 nanowires showed enhanced photoconversion efficiency and short-circuit current density compared to the undoped analogue.
2. Experimental details
Samples for the present study were in the form of nanowires synthesized by an electrospinning technique.29,30 The TiO2 nanowires were prepared by a commercial electrospinning machine (NANON, MECC, Japan) using a previously adopted procedure.24 The amounts of Ti and Ni precursors required were calculated based on the number of atoms required for replacing a given number of Ti atoms by Ni atoms. In the present work, 2 and 5 at% Ni were doped in the TiO2. The precursor solution for electrospinning was prepared from polyvinyl acetate (PVAc, Mw 500000), dimethyl formamide (DMF), titanium(IV) isopropoxide, nickel sulphate hexahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) and acetic acid. In a typical synthesis, 4.5 g of PVAc was dissolved in DMF to form 11.5 wt% PVAc in DMF and mixed together with titanium(IV) isopropoxide (4 g) and nickel sulphate hexahydrate (0.057 g for 2 at% and 0.1426 g for 5 at%). A sol was prepared by the dropwise addition of 0.5 g of acetic acid to the above solution. The resulting solution was stirred well and electrospun at 25 kV accelerating voltage and at 1 ml h−1 flow rate. The polymeric wires containing Ti4+ and Ni2+ ions were collected on a grounded rotating drum placed ∼10 cm below the spinneret.
Decomposition of the composite wires and crystallization behavior were studied by simultaneous differential thermal and thermogravimetric analyzer (STA, DTG-60 AH, Shimadzu, Japan) in the range 30–800 °C. The samples were sintered in air at 500 °C for 24 h to remove PVAc and allow nucleation and growth of TiO2 particles in the fiber structure. The morphology of the as-spun and annealed nanowires were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quanta 200 FEG System: FEI Company, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL 2010Fas, Japan). Crystal structures of the nanofibers were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5005, Bruker, Germany) technique. Particulate properties of the materials were studied using BET surface area measurements (Micromeritics, Tristar 3000, USA). The presence of Ni was confirmed by X-ray fluorescence measurements (EDX-720, Shimadzu). The optical bandgap of the fibers were determined from the diffused reflectance spectroscopy measurements (DRS, UV-Visible-NIR Spectrophotometer UV-3600, Shimadzu). Samples for the DRS measurements were prepared by pressing the finely ground electrospun nanowires into the form of cylindrical pellets of diameter ∼13 mm and thickness ∼1 mm.
Flat band potentials and electron density of the samples were determined from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Autolab PGSTAT30, Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands) in the dark employing Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis. Samples for EIS were prepared by sintering TiO2 and Ni:TiO2 fibers onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass plates and sealed using a 50 μm spacer. Acetonitrile containing 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethyl imidazolium iodide was used as the electrolyte. A platinum coated glass plate was used as the counter electrode. The MS plots were generated from EIS measurements in the dark for bias voltages from 0.4 to 0.7 V and fitting the observed EIS spectra to a modified Randles circuit.31
For the fabrication of DSCs, the TiO2 and Ni:TiO2 wires were directly spun on FTO glass substrates (1.5 cm × 1 cm; 25 Ω/□, Asahi Glass Co. Ltd, Japan), and then spun coated with a thin layer (∼100 nm) of TiO2. The thickness of the films was controlled by placing the FTO for different durations of time. The as-deposited fibrous films were then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. Area of the films were fixed at 0.28 cm2. Solar cells using the standard Degussa P25 particles purchased from Soloronix were also developed for comparison. Thickness of the films and its surface uniformity were studied by surface profilometry (Alpha–Step IQ Surface Profiler). The films were homogeneous and of uniform thickness (12 μm) and therefore the difference in properties does not arise from the surface non-uniformity. The DSCs were prepared by soaking the sintered electrodes in a dye solution containing a 1:1 volume mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol of a ruthenium-based dye [RuL2(NCS)2-2H2O; L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (0.5 mM), N3, Solaronix)] for 24 h at room temperature as outlined before.32,33 The dye-sensitized samples were then washed in ethanol to remove unanchored dye and dried in air. Samples were sealed using a 50 μm spacer. A Pt sputtered FTO glass was used as the counter electrode. The I3/I− electrolyte, which was used for the MS analysis, was injected to the spacer region through two previously developed micro-holes. Photocurrent measurements of the assembled DSCs were performed using a solar simulator (San Ei, Japan) at air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) condition. The level of standard irradiance (100 mW cm−2) was set with a calibrated c-Si reference solar cell. To avoid stray-light effects, devices were properly masked to expose only the photoelectrode area. The I–V curves were obtained using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT30, Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out using the standard kit from Oriel Instruments (model QE-PV-SI, Silicon detector, Newport Corporation, US). The AC responses of the cells were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using the Autolab PGSTAT30.
Electron diffusivity and mobility through the DSCs were studied by transient photocurrent measurements. The DSCs were excited with a low intensity laser pulse (532 nm Nd:YAG laser, pulse width <5 ns) superimposed on a large background white light illumination. The intensity of the white bias light was varied to study the effect of photocarrier density on the Dn. The intensity of the laser light was controlled with neutral density filters to keep the magnitude of photocurrent transients less than the dc level due to the white bias light. The cells were illuminated through the substrate as well as the counter electrode sides. The photocurrent transients were recorded using a digital oscilloscope (Agilent, 1 GHz) under short circuit conditions. The RC time constant of the instrument was <20 μs.
3. Results and discussion
Electrospinning is a matured technique for the synthesis of nanostructured materials with variable aspect ratio, morphology, crystallinity, and functionality.34–36 Many articles are published on the synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures by electrospinning including TiO2 with controllable crystallinity and electrical properties.30,37,38 In the present study, the diameter of the TiO2 wires was controlled by reducing the precursor concentration following Li et al.37Fig. 2 summarizes the thermal, structural, and morphological characteristics of the pure and Ni-doped TiO2 nanofibers. The DTA and TGA studies showed that the fibers were anatase up to 2 at% Ni doping; however, nucleation of the rutile phase was detected for higher Ni concentrations (5 at%) under similar processing conditions (Fig. 2A). The XRD patterns did not show any change in the lattice parameters for 2 at% Ni:TiO2 whereas it showed a lattice contraction for higher Ni content (Fig. 2B). The Ni:TiO2 nanofibers produced in the current work have a lower diameter (∼60 nm) (Fig. 2C and D) compared to our previous experiments;39 and therefore, have a relatively higher specific surface area (∼80 m2 g−1). Unlike in the previous cases of heavy metal doping, the BET surface area of the Ni:TiO2 does not decrease possibly because the molecular weights of Ti and Ni does not differ much. The Ni:TiO2 showed enhanced crystallinity as judged from the extended periodicity in the lattice image as well as from the discreteness of the electron diffraction patterns (Inset of Fig. 2D).

Fig. 3 shows the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the pure and Ni doped nanofibers, which clearly reveal the differences in the band structure upon Ni doping. The reflectance profile changed upon Ni doping in TiO2 and a clear red shift was observed for 5 at% doping. Interestingly, the reflectance profile of the Ni:TiO2 indicated partial transparency in the lower energy side, i.e., in the visible spectral region. A color change from white to pale yellow upon 2 at% Ni doping in TiO2 was noted. The intensity of the solar spectrum at the absorption wavelength window of most of the metal oxide semiconductors (>3.0 eV) is rather weak which is high at the visible spectral region. Note that a larger band gap results in a larger loss-in-potential,40 which is roughly defined as the difference between the band gap of the photoactive semiconductor divided by the charge of an electron and the VOC, in solar cells. Therefore, the observed red shift in the absorption edge and partial transparency of TiO2 to the visible spectrum is beneficial for solar light harvesting.

The effects of Ni doping on the electrochemical and optical properties were studied by Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis. The MS plots were developed from the EIS measurements in the dark following the procedure described elsewhere.41,42Fig. 4 shows the MS plots determined from EIS plots for the pure and Ni doped TiO2 nanowires sintered onto FTO substrates in the presence of the I−/I3 electrolyte. Sigmoidal plots were observed with an overall shape consistent with the n-type semiconductors. The flat band potentials,43i.e., the potential corresponding to the situation in which there is no charge accumulation in the semiconductor such that there is no band bending, which could be obtained from the x-intercept of the linear portion of the curves, differ for both samples. The intercepts were 0.615 and 0.578 for undoped TiO2 and 2 at% Ni:TiO2, respectively, implying that the flat band potential of Ni:TiO2 shifted more negative compared to that of the undoped TiO2.
 Fig. 4  MS plots of TiO2 and 2 at% Ni TiO2. 
Simultaneous decreases in the band gap and shifting of the band edge to more negative values upon Ni doping are not surprising. This effect happens because of the properties of the orbitals forming valence and conduction bands of Ni:TiO2. The 2p (O) and 3d (Ti) electrons form the valence band of TiO2, which has been further contributed significantly by the corresponding electrons of Ni25 thereby uplifting the valence band. The conduction band of TiO2 consists of pure 3d orbitals, the contribution from Ni (3d) is weaker compared to that obtained for the valence band. i.e. the rate of uplift of the valence band is higher compared to that of the conduction band as schematically shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Schematic showing the change in band structure of TiO2 upon Ni doping. The VBM and VBM′ are the valance band maxima of TiO2 and Ni:TiO2; CBM and CBM′ refers their conduction bands. The contributions from the orbitals forming the valence band is higher than that forming the conduction band such that the band gap of TiO2 [Eg (TiO2)] is larger than that of the Ni:TiO2 [Eg (Ni:TiO2)]. 
The slop of the linear portion of the MS plot, from where their electron densities (nD) could be calculated, increased upon Ni doping implying that the nD of Ni:TiO2 is lower than that of the undoped sample. This lowering in the nD is expected as Ni is a p-type dopant for Ti. The nD obtained from the slope of the 1/C2vs. V curve of TiO2 and Ni:TiO2 were 7 × 1021 cm−3 and 7.65 × 1020 cm−3, respectively. The electron density of nanostructured materials vary depending on the particle size, chemical history of material development, morphology, doping, and electrochemical or thermal treatments. Small nanoparticles, such as Degussa P25 (25 nm) usually show low charge carrier densities (∼1 × 1021) because of the totally depleted space charge region and therefore, the equilibrium Fermi level is far from the conduction band.35,36 On the other hand, the TiO2 nanowires developed in this study have many fold larger volumes compared to the Degussa P25 which can sustain internal band bending at the surface and are characterized by a depletion layer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The latter band bending brings the Fermi level closer to the conduction band and as a result the central region of the wires conducts similar to their bulk counterpart. Therefore, the enhancement of electron density from P25 to the nanowires results from the difference in their volumes. The electron density of TiO2 decreased as expected on Ni doping because the Ni2+ replacement for Ti4+ results in electron vacancy.
The charge transport parameters through the samples in the presence of I/I3 electrolyte were studied by EIS employing the transmission line model developed by Bisquert et al.44–48 According to the model, the impedance of a percolating network of the mesoporous metal oxide and electrolyte is expressed as: (1)where RT is the total resistance offered by the mesoporous metal oxide to the electron flow, RCT is the resistance to the recombination of electrons in the metal oxide with the hole-conducting species in the electrolyte, ωCT is the characteristic frequency at which the charge recombination occurs. The EIS spectra of similar systems usually display three semi circles due to three processes, viz., (i) charge transport resistance occurs at high frequency (>1 kHz); (ii) charge recombination resistance occurs at intermediate frequencies (<1 kHz < f < 1 Hz); and ion diffusion occurs at lower frequencies (<1 Hz). Fig. 6(A and B) shows the EIS plot for the samples sintered onto FTO plates in the presence of the electrolyte for a typical bias voltage of 0.61 V. Results of 5 at% Ni:TiO2 is eliminated from this discussion because of its multiphase nature, i.e., a mixture of anatase and rutile. These two polymorphs have differing electrical and optical properties; therefore, deconvoluting the contributions from individual phases from similar sets of experiments is rather cumbersome. Fig. 6C shows a magnified portion of the high frequency region corresponding to charge transport from where the RT could be calculated. Fig. 6D shows the RT calculated for the 0.4–0.7 V range by employing the transmission line model. One may observe that the RT of the Ni:TiO2 is considerably decreased compared to undoped TiO2 and P25. An increase in RT from TiO2 nanowires to P25 particles includes the size effects and an internal band bending.6 The only reason for a lowered RT for the Ni:TiO2 could be the enhanced crystallinity which eliminates the surface traps as shown in Fig. 1. Similar enhancement in RT in materials of simultaneously higher specific surface area and high crystallinity followed by enhanced μ is demonstrated in a recent paper.49

(A) The Nyquist plot of the TiO2, 2 at% Ni:TiO2, and P25 for a bias voltage of 0.61 V; (B) Magnified portion of the Nyquist plot in Figure (A) in the high frequency region showing the differences in the transport resistance; (C) Same as (B) but for 2 at% Ni doped TiO2; (D) Charge transport resistance (RT) as a function of applied voltage for TiO2, 2 at% Ni:TiO2, and P25; (E) Bode plots showing the difference frequencies of charge recombination processes; (F) Chemical capacitance (Cμ); (G) Charge recombination resistance (RCT) as a function of applied voltage for TiO2, 2 at% Ni:TiO2, and P25. Panel (H) shows the variation of RCT as a function of Cμ of the doped and undoped TiO2 nanowires. 
The Nyquist plots in Fig. 6A show that radius of the second semicircle increases from the P25 to the Ni:TiO2 nanowires. The apparently larger semicircle indicates an increase in the charge recombination resistance and therefore, an increased electron lifetime. The lifetime τn can be calculated from the Bode plots (Fig. 6E) using the equation τn = 1/2πfc, where fc is the peak frequency which for TiO2 NWs, 2 at% Ni:TiO2 NWs, and P25 were 4.79, 1.68, and 40.66 Hz at 0.61 V, respectively. These frequencies correspond to a τn of 33.24, 94.78, and 3.92 ms, respectively. i.e., the τn of 2 at% Ni:TiO2 is apparently longer than the other two samples. The longer τn of the device fabricated using the 2 at% Ni:TiO2 indicates a more effective suppression of the electron recombination between electrons in the conduction band and I−3 ions in the electrolyte. The enhanced τn is expected to result from the higher crystallinity achieved through the Ni doping.
To discuss its implication, we have calculated the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and the RCT as a function of the applied voltage from the EIS curves and shown in Fig. 6F and G. The Cμ represents the variation in the electron density of states (DOS) as a small variation of applied potential.44–48 The Cμ marked a lowering in Ni:TiO2 as expected when Ti4+ are replaced by Ni2+. The RCT increased significantly from the P25 particles to the nanowires. Although the enhancement of RCT of the Ni doped sample is not very significant, it is still at the higher end than the undoped samples. Fig. 6H shows the variation of RCT as a function of Cμ, which compares RCT for constant electron density. This observation is particularly important because Ni-doping reduced the electron density and hence the DOS, a situation which would decrease the effective μ. However, in this case, the Ni doping increased the crystallinity of TiO2 nanowires thereby partially removing the localized electronic states (surface trap states) lying in the band gap. As stated before, deviation from the ideal atomic packing is the source of these traps states in nanocrystalline materials and the primary reason for inferior μ through them. Thus, a possible lowering of μ due to the reduction in the DOS upon Ni doping in TiO2 could be compensated by its role in the removal of surface traps. The transient photocurrent measurements, which will be discussed later in this article, have corroborated this observation.

Fig. 7 shows the current density (JSC) vs. voltage (V) plots for the DSCs fabricated using TiO2, Ni:TiO2 nanowires, and P25 particles. The photovoltaic parameters of the cells are in Table 1. Requirement of high efficiencies in DSCs are (i) compact but porous electrode, (ii) highly purified dyes, (iii) choice of dyes and electrolytes, and (iv) presence of scattering layers to enhance light sensitivity.50 No scattering layers were used in the present experiments and the dyes used here were as-received and without any further purification. Furthermore, conventional N3 dye and iodide–triiodide based electrolytes were used in the present experiments and the combination of these could achieve only similar efficiencies.7 The purpose of the present experiment is to screen the suitability of Ni:TiO2, therefore, the efficiency achieved in these cells are of acceptable quality. The 2 at% Ni:TiO2 based devices showed 8% higher VOC (881 mV), 20% higher JSC (12.01 mA cm−2), and 30% enhanced η (6.75%) compared to the undoped analogue. However, a nominal decrease in the fill factor (FF) by ∼3% was observed for the Ni:TiO2 compared with the undoped analogue, which most likely arises as a consequence of lowering of RCT with respect to Cμ as shown in Fig. 6H. The 5 at% Ni:TiO2 showed decreased photovoltaic performance primarily because this material was a mixture of anatase and rutile phases with differing electrical and optical properties. Although Degussa P25 particles showed slightly improved efficiency than the best performing Ni-doped samples, the BET surface area and dye-loading of the former was twice that of the latter. The normalized η and JSC with respect to the dye-loading was therefore much higher for the 2 at% Ni:TiO2. The higher VOC in Ni:TiO2 is on account of its higher flat-band potential and enhanced electron lifetime. Possible reasons for the enhanced JSC of the 2 at% Ni:TiO2 based devices are (i) higher dye-loading (ii) its improved charge transport characteristics, and (iii) as an effect of change in the reflectance profile. As Ni is not appreciably heavier than Ti, the BET surface area of the Ni:TiO2 did not vary compared to the undoped analogue and the dye-loading test gave similar values for both samples (1.1 × 10−7 mol cm−2) i.e., enhancement in JSC due to difference in dye-loading could be ruled out. Therefore, the lowered RT and improved RCT of 2 at% Ni:TiO2 compared with its undoped counterpart have partially contributed to the improved photocurrents. To examine the contribution of the shift in the absorption edge of Ni:TiO2 on its photovoltaic parameters, the IPCE measurements were carried out. Fig. 8 shows the IPCE spectrum of pure as well as 2 at% Ni:TiO2. The peak IPCE showed an increase from ∼53% to ∼64% upon Ni doping. Besides, the spectra of Ni:TiO2 samples were wider than that of the undoped analogue thereby showing contributions on account of its shift in the band edge. To check the consistency of the results between the photo-action spectra and I–V measurements, the JSC of the devices were calculated from the IPCE spectra using the relation (2)where P is the input power and λ is the wavelength of the photo-response range. The integrated IPCE over the entire λ was used to calculate the JSC. The calculated JSC of the devices were 9.44 and 11.5 mA cm−2 for TiO2 and Ni:TiO2, respectively. These values closely match with their measured JSC from the I–V measurements, i.e., 9.68 and 12.01 mA cm−2, respectively. Thus, the higher JSC of the Ni:TiO2 based device results partially from the enhanced charge transport characteristics on account of its higher crystallinity as well as red-shifting of its band edge compared to the undoped analogue.

I–V curves of the solar cells fabricated using the TiO2, 2 and 5 at% Ni:TiO2 and P25. Although P25 shows higher photocurrent than the rest of the samples, it has two-fold dye-loading compared to the others. Therefore, normalized photocurrent with respect to dye-loading of the nanowire based devices is at least twice that of the P25.

Additionally, as was suggested by one of the reviewers of this article, it is worth noting whether or not the holes produced in the Ni:TiO2, as a result of visible absorption, can be effectively regenerated by the N3 dye/iodide redox couple. The HOMO of the N3 dye is at −4.98 eV32 AVS (versus absolute vacuum scale, AVS) and the redox potential of the iodide–triiodide is at −4.85 eV51 AVS, which are far above the valence band edge of TiO2, −7.4 eV AVS.52 As the valence band edge of 2 at% Ni:TiO2 is not appreciably different than that of pure TiO2, an effective reduction of holes in Ni:TiO2 is energetically favored. However, this aspect is an issue which requires further investigation.
Finally, the effect of Ni doping on the charge diffusivity and mobility were determined through transient photocurrent measurements. Fig. 9 shows the photocurrent transients of the pure and Ni-doped TiO2 nanowires. The photocurrent was observed immediately after laser excitation in the device fabricated using TiO2 and Ni:TiO2 and reaches the peak at around 70 μs followed by an exponential decay. The transit time (τc) was extracted by fitting the photocurrent transient using a single exponential decay from which the electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) was estimated using the relation, τc = d2/2.35Dn, where d is the thickness of the samples. The factor 2.35 corresponds to the diffusion geometry.53,54 The electron collection time or transport time reported in this study is estimated from the long time domain of the transient photocurrent signal, which is independent of the absorption coefficient or the illumination direction of the probe light. The photoexcitation density for various white light illumination intensities were calculated by numerically integrating the photocurrent transients. Fig. 9 also shows the Dn determined from the photocurrent transients. One may observe that the charge diffusivity, enhanced as a result of Ni doping, thereby provides direct evidence for the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the Ni:TiO2. Thus, the present study provides research directions for developing semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures with desirable charge transport properties and without compromising the particulate properties of the nanocrystalline materials.

Conclusions
In conclusion, Ni doping has a dramatic influence on the optical and electrical properties of TiO2. The present study using TiO2 nanowires of ∼60 nm diameter showed that the crystallinity of the TiO2 nanowires could be enhanced by Ni doping that resulted in enhanced charge mobility without compromising the nanocrystalline-particulate properties. The reflectance spectra of the Ni-doped TiO2 reveal absorbance in the visible spectral region, which have beneficial effects in solar energy harvesting. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic studies show that the Ni-doped TiO2 has a conduction band edge more negative compared to the undoped samples, lower transport resistance, and higher charge recombination resistance. We have shown that lowering of electron density of states as a result of replacing Ti4+ by Ni2+ could be compensated by an enhancement in crystallinity and partial removal of surface trap states. This elimination of surface states is shown to have a dramatic influence in its electron lifetime and electron mobility. The dye-sensitized solar cells fabricated using the 2 at% Ni-doped TiO2 nanowires showed improved photoconversion efficiency on account of the red shift of the absorption edge as well as improved charge transport properties. Photocurrent transients were recorded for the solar cells developed in this study and observed that no decrease in electron diffusivity and mobility occurred in Ni-doped TiO2 nanowires although the material had a higher specific surface area. Thus, results from the present study could be applied to fabricate more efficient dye-sensitized solar cells as well as provide future directions for developing semiconducting metal oxide nanostructures with desirable charge transport characteristics and without compromising the specific surface area.
