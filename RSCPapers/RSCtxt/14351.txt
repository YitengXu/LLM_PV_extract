    , Accepted 26th April 2021First published on 26th April 2021AbstractBy serving as alternatives to toxic and hazardous solvents, green solvents assist in implementing the idea of sustainability. The use of these neoteric reaction media dramatically reduces energy requirements and moderates the rate at which chemical waste is produced. In this work, we propose the sustainable synthesis of AFe2O4 catalyst (A = Mg, Zn, Mn) using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixture. The choline chloride–malonic acid based DES system shows heterogeneities at the nanoscopic stage, allowing for a more holistic production of spinels via a modified solid-state route with less environmental effect. Structural and morphological analyses of the synthesized ferrites clearly demonstrate the importance of next-generation solvents in the fabrication of functional materials. The ability of these synthesized samples to act as magnetically separable catalysts for the effective degradation and electrochemical detection of hazardous dye contaminants in water bodies using visible light has also been investigated. This approach quantifies green chemistry metrics and proves that functional materials can be effectively modified and improved at the nanoscale for a variety of applications.
Introduction
Nanostructured magnetic materials have attracted growing interest in material engineering as an outcome of their efficient recovery and isolation from reaction mixtures.1 Due to their wide range of tunable properties and applications, spinel ferrites (AFe2O4), which are a prominent member of magnetically separable catalysts, furnish great technological relevance.2–6 The cations distribution among the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in their crystal structure has a significant impact on the structural and microstructural characteristics of these ternary metal oxides, which, in turn, depends on their synthesis methodology.7,8 Numerous synthetic procedures including sol–gel autocombustion,9,10 co-precipitation,11,12 thermal decomposition,13,14 microwave assisted techniques,15,16 and microemulsion routes17,18 with modified reaction conditions are reported in detail in the literature for the fabrication of these nanospinels. Regardless of these approaches, conventional solid-state reactions have emerged as the saviour for large-volume production of ferrites. However, these reactions have some inherent drawbacks like high annealing temperature, uncontrolled composition and chemical inhomogeneity, which call for environmentally benign and easily scalable green synthetic routes. In this sense, DESs mediated solid-state reactions19,20 can be explored for the development of ferrites at low temperatures following the pathways of sustainability.
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are eutectic molar mixtures mainly consisting of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) that liquefies when they come into contact. The association of these components through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions and entropic differences stabilize the formation of a liquid phase at room temperature through melting point depression. These eutectic systems are alternatives to conventional solvents due to their favourable attributes like cost-effectiveness, non-toxicity, biodegradability that lead to the fabrication of micro and nanomaterials negligible ecological footprint.21–24 Among the numerous combinations of HBD and HBA that have been widely communicated, choline chloride (ChCl) based DESs have been significantly explored based on their efficacy in solubilizing a variety of metal precursors. Dong et al. reported for the first time, the preparation of single-crystalline ZnO nanomaterials based on reline solution that predicted the use of these DESs as designer solvents for ternary metal oxides.25 However, very few studies have been directed to explore the eutectic synthesis of ferrites and thus, an investigation in this regard could exploit the properties of these materials to the highest degree with low environmental impact. The superior physicochemical properties of DESs based on their constituent materials create a polar environment that catabolizes the successful formation of novel materials with less energy requisites.
In addition to comprehensive state-of-the-art applications, ferrites have established their potential in environmental remediation research,26,27 especially as an effective photochemical system for water purification.28–30 Uncontrolled urbanization and a myopic attitude towards pollution and climate change have thrown humanity into a water crisis, necessitating waste water treatment, mainly the conversion of organic dyes into harmless compounds. Electrochemical detection and photocatalytic degradation of dyes are an escalating area of research due to the deplorable quality of water, which possesses an exhortation for society and globalization.
The electrochemical technique, in addition to a precise determination, enables the identification of dye contaminants in real samples, resulting in true representation of quantitative analyses, while photodegradation contributes to wastewater detoxification. However, the majority of photocatalysts are only relevant for photocatalysis in the ultraviolet region, which accounts for merely 4% of solar energy. Consequently, visible light-driven photocatalysts, which make consistent use of sunlight are highly desirable.31–35
In this work, a more amenable, sustainable and cost-effective strategy is adopted for the synthesis of AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) nanoparticles using choline chloride – a malonic acid deep eutectic solvent system at low temperatures. In addition to structural characterization, the potential of these ferrite nanoparticles on the electrochemical detection and degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye has been investigated. The adverse health effects associated with MB with far reaching consequences symbolize the importance of its evaluation as a model pollutant. Also, the relevance of spinel catalysts for photo-remediation has been further extended to other hazardous dye pollutants for its effective performance qualification. The use of DES as a solvent promotes the biocompatible formation of spinel ferrites with reduced energy following the guideposts of sustainability.

Synthesis of AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) nanoparticles
Generic AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) are synthesized from their respective oxides using a previously reported DES-mediated solid-state reaction.36,37 Primarily choline chloride–malonic acid deep eutectic solvent is prepared by mixing the components in the desired molar ratio (1:1) and stirring at 25 °C in a sealed vial until a clear solution is obtained. This synthetic procedure differs from the conventional adopted methods of DES preparation as malonic acid decomposes to form acetic acid and carbon dioxide if heated at higher temperatures, thus significantly affecting the greenness of the synthetic procedure. α-Fe2O3 and metal oxide (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) precursors are then added to the DES solution in a molar ratio of 1:1 and stirred for 1 h for homogeneity. The as-obtained melts are then transferred to individual crucibles and calcined at 500 °C in a muffle furnace for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The schematic representation of the method of synthesis is given in Scheme 1.

Photocatalysis
An assessment of the photocatalytic behaviour of AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) spinels is realized through the visible light degradation of aqueous MB dye solutions carried out in a multi lamp photoreactor [Heber HML-COMPACT-SW-LW-44] fitted with 4 no. of 8 W fluorescent black light SANKYO DENKI F8T5/BLB with dimensions of 28.7 cm × 1.55 cm and an output power of 1.4 W. The initial control experiments constituted 25 ppm of MB dye aliquot made up to 50 mL using deionised water. In detail, 50 mg of each spinel catalyst was mixed with 50 mL of dye solutions and H2O2, for magnetic stirring in darkness for 30 min to attain adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The visible light source is then switched on for a period of 2 h for photodecolourization studies. 6 mL of suspensions are withdrawn at an interval of 15 min followed by centrifugation to record the absorption spectra of the dye aliquots at varied irradiation durations. The percentage degradation of the dye is determined using eqn (1), % Degradation = (C0 − Ct/C0) × 100(1)where, C0 is the initial concentration and Ct is the concentration of the sample at time t. Also, the correlation of kinetic behaviour is obtained through the relation eqn (2), ln(C0/C) = kt(2)where, k is the constant of degradation rate.
Electro-sensing of MB adsorbed at MnFM modified GCEs
A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with MnFM is used as the working electrode for MB detection, in combination with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and Pt wire as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The as-prepared GCEs assembly and nitrogen capillary are submerged in a 10 mL solution containing 1 M of MB mixed with an appropriate volume of acetate buffer in an electrochemical system. Different volumes of acetate buffer are investigated for optimization. The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) method is engaged in an optimized manner (at the potential of −0.4 V to 0.2 V) during most experiments for the effective electrochemical investigation and detection of MB dye.
Results and discussion
Structural and morphological evaluation
The materialization and crystalline properties of the ferrite samples annealed at 500 °C are determined by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. 1a). For MgFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 materials, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values −30.1°, 35.5°, 43.1°, 53.5°, 56.9°, 62.7° and 29.9°, 35.2°, 42.8°, 53.0°, 56.5°, 62.1° are assigned to the crystal facets (220), (311), (400), (422), (511) and (440) (JCPDS no. 89-7746 and JCPDS no. 82-1042), respectively. The diffractogram of MnFe2O4 displayed reflections at 2θ values −34.8°, 36.5°, 42.4°, 46.4°, 52.9° and 62.7°, which corresponded to the (311), (222), (400), (331), (422) and (440) planes (JCPDS no. 89-2808), respectively. These results can be readily attributed to the formation of crystalline cubic spinel structures with the space group Fdm for the as-synthesized ferrites. The results indicated the existence of pure single phases of magnesium and zinc ferrites, whereas weak reflections of α-Fe2O3 are prevalent in MnFe2O4 which evidenced the transfer of Fe3+ from the B site to A site in its spinel structure.38

The calcination temperatures, in addition to the local oxygen environment of the MnFe2O4 system, which effectively achieves a faster rate of oxidation and reduction, can be attributed to the favourable formation of secondary phases. The dominance of the ambient local oxygen environment over the pressure of the inner oxygen environment induces and influences its distortion at lower heating temperatures resulting in the oxidation and decomposition of a particular ferrite phase. For the other two spinel systems, the pressure of the inner oxygen surroundings is adequate to avert the decomposition of the ferrite phases. This variance in the behaviour is inclined to the incorporation of metal ions with different ionic radii in the interior crystal structure with varied A sites.39 Moreover, the absence of discernible peaks of other segregated phases indicates the efficiency of the method compared to conventional synthesis routes with temperatures higher than 1000 °C. Table 1 summarizes the lattice constant, cell volume and X-ray density of the synthesized AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) materials which are represented as MFM, ZnFM and MnFM, respectively. These crystallographic variables are comparable to those found in the literature, reflecting the method's superiority. The larger ionic radius of Mn2+ ions results in the enhanced lattice constant for MnFM followed by ZnFM and MFM. The cation redistribution on the lattice of the spinel system brings about a linear shift in the lattice parameter dependent on the ionic radii of the metal ions. Also, the nature of variation on X-ray density is established on the basis of the atomic masses of the cations.

In order to evaluate the peak broadening with crystallite size and lattice strain due to dislocation, the Williamson–Hall (W–H) method and size-strain plots (SSP) have been analysed and presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Grain boundaries, coherency stresses, triple junctions, point defects, contact or sinter stresses etc. induce crystal imperfections and dislocations in nanocrystals producing microstructures of the lattice in consequence. The decoupled effect of the intrinsic strain on XRD peak broadening in Scherrer's method ideates the significance of the W–H method and SSP for the estimation of size-strain parameters. Fig. S1a–c (ESI†) represents the uniform deformation model of the modified W–H equation. This model takes into account the crystal's isotropic composition, as well as the uniform strain distribution in all crystallographic directions. The Lorentzian and Gaussian functions description of the crystallite size profile through SSP is depicted in Fig. S1d–f (ESI†). This method offers a better evaluation of the isotropic broadening as reflections at higher angles are neglected as the accuracy and precision are lower. Low and mid angle reflections provide a better quality of XRD data with negligible overlapping of the diffracting peaks. A superior fit with uniformity of lattice strain indicated by less scattering of the data points in W–H and SSP validates the isotropic nature of the synthesized samples.40,41 A comparison of the crystallite size obtained from these methods is provided in Table 1.
The FT-IR spectra analysis records the absorption vibration of the materials to determine the surface functional groups and molecular interactions. Fig. 1b depicts the FT-IR spectra of MFM, ZnFM and MnFM samples in the frequency range of 400–4000 cm−1. The similar absorption band features with two characteristic bands in the frequency range 580–550 cm−1 and 432–420 cm−1, which are distinctive peaks of spinel ferrites, indicate the effective structural formation of all three synthesized materials. These peaks are attributed to the stretching vibrations of oxygen ion with tetrahedral metal ions and octahedral metal ions. The shorter bond length of the tetrahedral group due to the extra covalence of metal-oxygen complexes at this region in contrast to the octahedral group results in a relative difference in intensities of these characteristic peaks of spinel structures. The weak peaks around 1623 cm−1 and 1396 cm−1 correspond to the bending vibrations of physically adsorbed and interlayer water molecules while stretching vibrations appear at 1109 cm−1. The O–H stretching mode for adsorbed and interlamellar water molecules results in the broad absorption peak around 3400 cm−1 as a consequence of the compaction of KBr pellets. The preferential distribution of cations in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel structure resulting in a bathochromic or hypsochromic shift in vibrational frequencies is significantly influenced by the finite size effects at nano dimensions. The differences in the microstructure, percentage of porosity, methods of preparation, cation-oxygen binding forces and atomic weights of the cations can reinforce the crystal field energies and modifies the absorption band positions.29,36,42 Also, an integrated view of FT-IR and XRD of MnFM stipulates the impact of the secondary phase of α-Fe2O3 on vibrational frequencies by the appearance of long shoulders in the higher frequency absorption band.
Specific surface areas significantly affect the electrochemical and photocatalytic properties of ferrites, and the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution graphs of the synthesized materials are shown in Fig. 1c. The physisorption isotherms for MFM, ZnFM and MnFM clearly reflect type IV isotherms of IUPAC classification with hysteresis loop type H2. Hysteresis behaviour apparently affirms the existence of mesoporous materials enclosing capillary abridgement during the desorption process. The corresponding relative pressure for MFM, ZnFM and MnFM (P/P0) is in the range of 0.35–0.97, 0.40–0.97 and 0.41–0.93 which further emphasizes the mesoporosity in the samples.31,43 The total specific surface areas and other textural parameters are presented in Table 1. The increased pore volume of MnFM can be attributed to its larger pore diameter which can, in turn, be due to the effect of secondary phases on the formation of pores.
The analysis of the optical characteristics of AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) through UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and Tauc plots are presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1d clearly illustrates the expression of absorbance in the visible region for MFM, ZnFM and MnFM materials with well-defined band edges around 500–570 nm. The improved harvesting properties under visible light can be attributed to the photo-excitation materializing between the O-2p and Fe-3d levels of the valence band and conduction band respectively. The energy band gap (Eg) values evaluated using the Kubelka–Munk Function in a Tauc plot for direct and indirect optical transitions (Fig. S2a–f, ESI†) are listed in Table 2. The wide band gap of ZnFM arises from the blue shifting owing to the reduction of sizes through quantum confinement effects. With decreasing crystallite size, this phenomenon resulting from the small size regime broadens the band gap. Further variations in the band gaps of MnFM and MFM with comparable crystallite sizes are facilitated by the formation of local energy levels from the surface and interface defects in MnFM. Narrow band gaps and elongated optical path lengths of the synthesized materials envisage their utilization as visible light active catalysts. In addition, this method's superiority in terms of metal impurities and oxygen vacancies is demonstrated by the absence of localized levels in the band gaps of these materials.44,45

The morphologies of the synthesized materials explored through SEM and TEM are presented in Fig. 2. The SEM images (Fig. 2a–c) clearly depict the non-uniform size distribution with a degree of inhomogeneity in MFM, ZnFM and MnFM samples. MFM comparably exhibits a much more uniform size distribution of spherical and cubical particles while MnFM and ZnFM are mainly composed of irregular spherical particles. The agglomeration leading to the formation of coarse bumpy materials is an indication of magneto-static and van der Waals surface interactions between the particles which influence the magnetic behaviours of ferrites. TEM images in Fig. 2d–f further recognise these considerations with more discernible microstructural information. Nanometric particles combine to form fluffy aggregates through nucleus coalescent growth to attain a reduced free energy state resulting in subsequent agglomeration. The magnetization curves in Fig. 2g–i furnish the characteristic magnetization nature of the as synthesized catalysts. The ferromagnetic natures of the three spinels are clearly illustrated by the thin S shaped hysteresis loops which emphasize the potential of these materials as magnetically separable catalysts.46–48 Different parameters such as saturation magnetization (Ms), remanent magnetization and coercivity deduced from these curves are summarized in Table 2.

Photocatalytic activity of AFe2O4 (A = Mg, Zn and Mn) spinels
The photo-Fenton catalytic performance of the spinels is explored by the rate of degradation of MB under varied systems. The absorption spectra of the dye reveal two major peaks namely at 664 nm and 609 nm. These essential peaks can be attributed to the conjugation of dimethyl amine substituted aromatic rings through heteroatoms S and N. Fig. 3a–c present the effect of three spinels on the photo-degradation rates of solutions of MB at different time intervals of visible-light irradiation. As seen in the figure, MnFM displays superior degradation capability compared to MFM and ZnFM. Also, the absorption peaks of MB gradually diminished on increasing the degradation time for the nanoparticles. The active radicals for photo-degradation increases with increasing radiation time with subsequent degradation within 2 h. MnFM attained 99% degradation within 30 mins of irradiation resulting in a faster derivative reduction process with redox reaction initiation. This is preferred because of its narrower band gap, which allows for an active response to visible light accompanied by photogeneration of electrons and holes. The % degradation efficacies of MFM, ZnFM and MnFM are included in Fig. 3d. The adsorption–desorption equilibrium studies carried out in the dark for 30 minutes clearly envisage that no appreciable degradation is witnessed in the absence of light. This directs the effective solar spectrum response of the prepared photocatalysts. The kinetics of the photocatalysts examined in Fig. S3 (ESI†) followed pseudo-first-order kinetics of Langmuir–Hinshelwood relationship of bimolecular reaction. The linear variation substantiates the random interaction of the catalyst with MB and secondary reagents. The efficient photolysis of MB by MnFM forms the underlying basis for further optimization studies in order to acquire better insight into its catalytic properties.

Reaction mechanism
The photocatalytic mechanism is primarily mediated by highly reactive species such as electrons (e−), holes (h+), hydroxyl (˙OH), superoxide (O2˙−) and hydroperoxyl (˙OOH) radicals. Heterogeneous photo-Fenton systems utilize H2O2 to generate extra hydroxyl radicals and to avert the recombination of charge carriers. The incorporation of an oxidant like H2O2 along with the simultaneous reaction of holes and electrons emitted from the catalyst on visible light irradiation with water and oxygen, assist in faster production of surplus ˙OH and other active radicals. The reactive species on the surface of the nanoparticles expedites redox reactions with the contaminants causing its mineralization.49 The mechanistic pathway of the photo-degradation is shown in Fig. 3e.

Fig. 4a and b depict the influence of catalyst dosage on the photocatalytic reaction of MnFM. The photocatalytic activity exhibits a linear upsurge on varying the catalyst amount from 50 mg to 100 mg. This elevation can be attributed to the rise in the active sites on the surface of the photocatalyst. A further increase in concentration can bring about a downshift in efficiency owing to the reduced penetration of stimulated light. Furthermore, the initial concentration of the dye embarks great significance towards the photodegradation process. The potency of the MnFM catalyst towards varied concentrations of MB solutions is depicted in Fig. 4c–e. The degradation efficiency experiences an elevation on altering the concentration from 10 ppm to 25 ppm but a further increase to 50 ppm induces a downward shift in the process. The apparent reason for this phenomenon is the existence of dye molecules on the functional sites of the photocatalyst at higher concentrations which limits the infiltration of light on the surface of the spinel to produce radicals. A decrease in the activity at 10 ppm can be assigned to the visible light screening of the dye itself. Fig. 4f–l presents the impact of change in pH (range 1–13) on the catalytic efficiency of the MnFM spinel. Better activities are shown by the catalyst at a pH above 9 which affiliates the photodegradation to the pH of aqueous dye solutions based on the point of zero charges (pzc) of manganese ferrite. A pzc of 7.7 is reported for MnFM in the literature above which the surface of the material becomes negative. This results in the attraction of the cationic dye, MB, with the oppositely charged species of MnFM enabling the rapid breakdown of the pollutant.

To ascertain the contribution of each reactive species, radical scavenging activity studies are included in Fig. 5a–d. Scavenger materials for hydroxide ions, superoxide anion radicals, holes and electrons such as potassium iodide (KI), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), benzophenone ((C6H5)2CO) and potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), respectively,50 are used in the reaction processes for the optimized MB solutions. The absorption spectra manifest ˙OH radicals as the principal active species involved in the photocatalytic process. The degradation efficiency is significantly affected by the addition of KI, followed by K2S2O8, (C6H5)2CO and EDTA implying minimal roles of these species in the photocatalytic reaction. The presence of air oxygen can contribute to photocatalytic oxidation. Oxygen can act as an electron acceptor which restrains the electro-hole recombination promoting the generation of ˙OH radicals. The results also manifested ˙OH radicals as the principal active species involved in a photocatalytic process where their additional numbers can be facilitated by the action of oxygen as electron acceptor. Also, Fig. 5e depicts the photo-degradation efficiency of MnFM nanoparticles under visible light in consecutive batch runs. It is indicated that the spinel system exhibits excellent chemical durability and stability for up to six cycles. This envisages its successful utilization as the magnetically separable and recyclable catalyst.

Usefulness of MnFM catalyst for other pollutants
The evaluation of the activity of the MnFM catalyst on the visible light degradation of other toxic dyes extends its application for wastewater remediation. Fig. 5f–h presents the absorption spectra of rhodamine-B, malachite green and methyl orange tested for its visible-light catalytic activity under the optimized conditions of MB. The spinel catalyst efficiently degrades all three dyes with remarkable degradation percentages. This marked activity of the biocompatible photocatalyst emphasizes its application to other toxic effluents.
Electrochemical determination of MB dyes
DPV methods have been extensively applied for the rapid detection of analytes. In order to describe the immobilization of MB in a MnFM modified electrode in 0.2 M acetate buffer, the absorbance of 1 M MB is analysed to detect the concentration of MB under optimal conditions, as shown in Fig. 6a. Here, the current linearly increased by elevating the buffer volume from 1 to 2 mL while it decreased at a concentration of 2.5 mL with the described electrolyte. Therefore, 2 mL of 0.2 M acetate buffer with a pH value of 7 is chosen and applied in the following experiments as the optimal volume for MB detection. The possible electrochemical oxidation–reduction reaction mechanism of MB is given in Scheme S1 (ESI†).51,52Fig. 6b displays the DPV curve of MnFM/GCE with respect to different concentrations of MB ranging from 0.1 to 9.6 μM in 0.1 M acetate buffer. The inset in Fig. 6b demonstrates the corresponding calibration plot of MB concentration versus current. The linear regression correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.995 is estimated from Fig. 6b. The limit of detection (LOD) and sensitivity is calculated by the standard method given in the following eqn (3) and (4):53–58 LOD = 3 × (standard deviation of low concentration)/(slope of the calibration line)(3) Sensitivity = (slope of the calibration curve)/(surface area of the electrode)(4)

The proposed MnFM/GCE sensor displays accurate validation towards significant electrocatalytic activity by attaining a wide response range of 0.1–9.6 μM, the lower detection limit is 9 nM and higher sensitivity is 4.42 μA μM−1 cm2 when compared to previously reported literature (Table S1, ESI†). These results satisfactorily categorize the MnFM modified electrode's potential application for the electrochemical sensing towards MB in real-world samples.
Real sample analysis of MB in bodies of water
The real applicability of MnFM/GCE is investigated by determining MB in real world samples. For the recovery testing of MB in water bodies, the standard addition procedure is developed to minimize matrix effects that can adversely affect the analyte's measurement signals. The percentage of MB recoveries at spiked and un-spiked MB in 0.1 M acetate buffer, shown in Fig. 6c and d, specifies the practical applicability of the proposed sensor in real-life samples. Therefore, MnFM is a tremendous fit of modified electrodes towards detecting water pollution and paves the way towards effective monitoring to provide objective evidence for water conservation.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study explores the potential of DES as a sustainable solvent for the synthesis of AFe2O4 nanoparticles (A = Mg, Zn, Mn) using a choline chloride–malonic acid system. The structural, magnetic, optical and morphological characterization through advanced techniques suggests the evolution of pure spinel ferrites with better structural and morphological characteristics. The synthesized nanoparticles behave as highly efficient systems for visible light degradation and electrochemical detection of toxic dyes. Also, the excellent photooxidative capability of the ferrites further envisages its wide application in water remediation as photo-Fenton catalysts and the detections offers constructive water quality monitoring. This method offers the fabrication of materials with enhanced properties with shortened synthesis tree in addition to preventing waste generation and reducing energy demands. The intermolecular interactions between HBD and HBA of the DES system assist in the effective solubilization of the precursors along with its simultaneous action as a template and accelerate the formation of functional materials. Moreover, the intersection of the conventional techniques with these green solvents promotes cost-effective procedures with less energy requisites. Thus, the environmental and economic benefits obtained from this sustainability driven solvent system can lead to better advances in material design and engineering.
