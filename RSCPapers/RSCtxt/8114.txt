    , Accepted 22nd November 2021First published on 29th November 2021AbstractExploiting high-performance, low-cost, and robust bifunctional catalysts toward electrochemical water splitting is of great importance, but remains challenging. Herein, a novel hybrid electrocatalyst of Ni–Fe–Ru-based phosphide heterostructures directly grown on nickel foam (Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF) is synthesized by a simple two-step strategy. When assessed as a bifunctional catalyst toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the resultant Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrode shows remarkable electrocatalytic performance and long-time durability in alkaline electrolytes due to the collaborative contributions of abundant heterointerfaces, good conductivity, and 3D porous architecture. As expected, to afford a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the as-prepared Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF merely requires low overpotentials of 195 and 78.6 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, comparable to most bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF//Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrolyzer demonstrates a low voltage of 1.49 V for 10 mA cm−2 along with excellent stability, exceeding that of Pt–C/NF//IrO2/NF (1.64 V). Furthermore, the H2 generation driven by commercial solar cells is evaluated to stimulate practical applications in the future.
Introduction
To realize the social renewable development goal, it is of great significance to exploit clean and sustainable energy resources to replace fossil fuels.1,2 Among them, hydrogen (H2) with zero-carbon emission and eco-friendly nature has gained extensive attention during the past few decades.3,4 Considering hydrogen generation technologies reported, electrochemical water splitting is regarded as a promising approach to produce H2 with high purity, which comprises the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).5–7 However, the bottleneck in boosting water electrolysis technologies is the sluggish oxygen evolution process, which greatly reduces the efficiency of full water splitting.8,9 At present, the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts toward the HER and OER are Pt-based materials and IrO2/RuO2, respectively.10 Regretfully, the high cost and scarcity of noble-metal catalysts severely impede their practicability toward water splitting.11–13 Therefore, rational design and development of advanced electrocatalysts with low cost, high efficiency and long-term stability for the HER and OER are urgently needed.
Transition metal phosphides (TMPs), for instance, NiPx,14–16 FePx,17,18 CoPx,19–21 and so on,22,23 have emerged as competitive electrocatalysts toward the HER and OER owing to their outstanding electrical conductivity and high catalytic performance. Particularly, bimetallic or multimetallic phosphides exhibit superior electrochemical activities,24–29 exceeding those of monometallic phosphides, which can be attributed to the synergy of different components. Although numerous TMP-based electrocatalysts have been designed and exploited toward the HER and OER, their activities are far from satisfactory for industrial applications. To further enhance catalytic properties of TMP-based hybrids, nanostructure engineering has been proposed as an effective solution and widely carried out. Of note, interfacial engineering can play the role of “killing two birds with one stone” in the construction of efficient catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution,30–33 which not only merely modulates the electronic structure, but also produces plenty of novel active sites, thereby resulting in the enhancement of catalytic efficiency. On the other hand, integration with conductive substrates forming 3D porous heterostructures in the absence of binders,34–40 can accelerate mass/charge transfer, increase the loading mass of active components, expose more catalytic centers, and prevent catalysts from detaching throughout the catalytic process, further improving electrocatalytic ability and long-term durability of the heterostructured electrode.
Recently, ruthenium phosphide (RuPx)-based nanomaterials have been widely employed as catalysts with extraordinary electrochemical performance for the HER.41–43 Moreover, benefitting from the oxides and/or hydroxides in situ generated during the OER process, RuPx-related hybrids have drawn considerable interest in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.44–46 Notably, the cost of Ru is greatly lower than that of Pt.41 Inspired by the above-mentioned considerations, we envision that the preparation of Ru-doped multimetallic phosphides is at the forefront of research for low-energy consumption water electrolysis. To our knowledge, self-supported Ru-doped TM-based trimetallic phosphides synthesized by a facile strategy have rarely been reported to date.
Herein, we report the direct growth of 3D porous nanosheet arrays containing Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P rich heterojunctions on nickel foam (named Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF) via a hydrothermal method followed by phosphidation. Thanks to the synergy of the unique structure and component, the resulting nanosheet arrays show excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic abilities for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline media. Impressively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, it only requires a lower overpotential of 195 mV toward the OER in 1.0 M KOH solution. Meanwhile, it also exhibits enhanced HER properties with an overpotential of 78.6 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 85.1 mV dec−1, comparable to those of most of reported HER electrocatalysts. Additionally, a two-electrode electrolyzer utilizing Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF as both the anode and cathode for full water-splitting, can provide 10 mA cm−2 current density at a voltage of 1.49 V and continuously functions for over 10 h, strongly confirming the feasibility for energy-saving hydrogen generation. Intriguingly, the device can also be operated by using a solar cell. This work offers a simple route to develop an efficient and low-cost electrocatalyst for water-splitting in alkaline media.
Experimental section
Preparation of NiFeRu-LDH on nickel foam
NiFeRu-LDH on NF was prepared by a hydrothermal method reported.6 In brief, a piece of NF (1 × 3 cm2) was washed with ethanol, HCl aqueous solution (1 M), and deionized water in sequence. 87.2 mg Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 96.9 mg Fe(NO3)2·9H2O, 12.4 mg RuCl3·xH2O, and 120.1 mg urea were dissolved in 15 mL of water solution to form homogeneous solution, which then was transfered into a Teflon autoclave. Subsequently, the cleaned NF was immersed into the above solution and then was heated at 120 °C for 12 h. Lastly, after washing with deionized water and drying, the sample was obtained (denoted as NiFeRu-LDH/NF). NiFe-LDH/NF was obtained in an identical way without adding RuCl3·xH2O.
Preparation of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF
In a representative procedure, 50 mg of NaH2PO2·H2O and the as-synthesized NiFeRu-LDH/NF were placed at the upstream and downstream side of a tube furnace, respectively, and thereby heated at 350 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF was achieved. Ni2P–Fe2P/NF was fabricated utilizing NiFe-LDH/NF as a raw material by a similar approach.
Preparation of IrO2/NF and Pt–C/NF
For comparison, IrO2/NF was prepared as follows: 20 mg commercial IrO2 was added into a mixed solution of Nafion (70 μL) and ethanol (1930 μL) to form homogeneous solution. Then, 150 μL of the ink was decorated on a pre-prepared NF (1 × 1 cm2) and dried at 40 °C. Pt–C/NF was constructed with the same method.
Instruments
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out on a JSM-7800F. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, and high-resolution (HR) TEM images were taken on a JEOL-2100F. A D/max 2500/PC diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) was used to acquire powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns. The elemental compositions were probed by X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 Versa). Contact angle tests were executed on a Dataphysics-OCA100.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical tests were performed on a CHI 760E electrochemical station (Chenhua, Shanghai) in 1.0 M KOH solution at room temperature. The resultant catalyst/NF (1 × 1 cm2), graphite rod, and Hg/HgO (1.0 M KOH) were chosen as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. Notably, the calibrated value of Hg/HgO in 1.0 M KOH is 0.924 V (Fig. S1†), in which Pt wires were chosen as the counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. All potentials were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): ERHE = 0.924 V + EHg/HgO. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained at 2 mV s−1. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements at 20–100 mV s−1 for the OER and at 2–10 mV s−1 for the HER in the non-faradaic region were performed to investigate the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) respectively. A two-electrode configuration was assembled using the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF couple as both the anode and cathode toward full water-splitting. Remarkably, the produced O2 and H2 were quantitatively collected through the water drainage strategy.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 elucidates the synthetic procedure of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF according to a two-step in situ growth-phosphidation method. First, according to the literature previously reported,6 the NiFeRu-LDH nanosheet arrays were directly aligned on the NF (named NiFeRu-LDH/NF) by means of a facile hydrothermal process. Subsequently, the resultant NiFeRu-LDH/NF can be phosphatized to the target product of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF, where NaH2PO2 was chosen as a P source under an Ar atmosphere.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation of the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrocatalyst. 
The structure and morphology of the as-prepared Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. S2†, the three main peaks at 44.6°, 52.1°, and 76.5° correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of metal Ni resulting from NF (JCPDS 04-0850), respectively,36 while the other peaks at 11.7°, 23.1°, 34.5°, 38.9°, 46.7°, 60.4°, 61.3°, and 65.3°, are indexed to the (003), (006), (101), (015), (018), (110), (113), and (116) crystal faces of NiFeRu-LDH, respectively.6 The SEM images shown in Fig. S3† reveal that uniform nanosheets with a 3D open porous architecture are vertically grown on the NF. After phosphorization, the designed Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF still inherits the sheet-like morphological feature (Fig. 1a–c). Moreover, these nanosheets with a thickness of about 20 nm are mutually interconnected, generating a wall-like structure of NiFeRu-LDH. Such fascinating networks can endow the hybrid with a robust framework, large accessible surface and high conductivity, which are advantageous for fast mass transport and release of the gas bubbles, thereby expediting water electrolysis.34,47 As exhibited in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1d), the existence of a sheet-like morphology can be further manifested, which consists of small nanoparticles encapsulated into the hybrid matrix (Fig. 1e). From the high-resolution TEM (HR TEM) images shown in Fig. 1f, it is clearly found that multiple-interfaces occur on the heterojunction structure. The well-defined d-spacings of 0.192, 0.204, and 0.189 nm are assignable to the (210) facet of Ni2P, (201) plane of Fe2P, and (301) plane of Ru2P, respectively. These results provide further evidence of the fabrication of Ni–Fe–Ru-based phosphide heterostructures, which contribute to the formation of the interfacial effect and more exposed catalytic sites, thereby leading to the improvement of electrocatalytic performance.35,36 In addition, the homogeneous distribution of metal phosphides on NF is proven by the corresponding elemental mapping images of Ni, Fe, Ru, and P elements (Fig. 1g). As can be seen in Fig. S4,† apart from the characteristic peaks of Ni, the PXRD pattern of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF matches well with Ni2P (JCPDS 65-3544), Fe2P (JCPDS 88-1803), and Ru2P (JCPDS 89-3031), respectively. To get insight into the hydrophilic feature, water contact angle tests were implemented. As shown in Fig. S5,† when NF is decorated with Ni2P/Fe2P/Ru2P nanoparticles, the contact angle is reduced from 109.3° to 0°, powerfully supporting its superhydrophilic behavior, which can result in the intimate contact of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF and the electrolyte, boost the gas detachment, and accelerate ion/charge transfer, further enhancing the catalytic kinetics.7,31

For comparison, the Ni2P–Fe2P/NF was also synthesized through a similar approach without adding RuCl3. The corresponding morphologies and structures of these related samples were characterized by SEM and PXRD in detail, and are illustrated in Fig. S6–S9.†
To investigate the chemical state and elemental composition of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed. The survey spectrum presented in Fig. S10† shows that the hybrid is consisted of Ni, Fe, Ru, P, and O elements. As seen from the Ni 2P XPS spectrum (Fig. 2a), the peaks centered at 853.2 and 870.5 eV are assignable to the formation of Ni–P in Ni2P, and the two doublets located at 856.8/874.8 eV and 861.3/879.9 eV correspond to the oxidized Ni species and satellite peaks.27,31 In Fig. 2b, the Fe 2P spectrum could be fitted into six peaks, which are attributed to Fe–P (705.9/715.4 eV), Fe2+ (710.4/724.1 eV), and Fe3+ (713.1/726.7 eV), respectively.34,37 Among them, Fe2+ and Fe3+ should be ascribed to Fe oxides. The Ru XPS spectrum presents (Fig. 2c) two main peaks at 461.9 and 484.2 eV indicative of Ru 2p3/2 and Ru 2p1/2, respectively.41,42 As displayed in the P 2p region shown in Fig. 2d, a pair of peaks at 129.4 and 130.3 eV can be distinguished attributable to metal phosphides. The additional peak at 133.9 eV belongs to P–O originating from surface oxidation.24,32 Noticeably, the existence of oxide-containing species can endow the sample with high-efficiency catalytic activity toward the OER.

Oxygen evolution reaction measurement
The electrocatalytic OER performance of the as-designed catalysts was examined by using a typical three-electrode device in 1.0 M KOH solution. For comparison, the commercial IrO2 catalyst was also evaluated under the identical conditions. Fig. 3a demonstrates the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the resultant catalysts. As expected, Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF shows the best electroactivity along with the lowest overpotential of 195 mV to deliver 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3b), in comparison to Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (230 mV) and IrO2/NF (316 mV). Especially, Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF can require a slight enhancement in overpotentials (225 mV and 236 mV) to attain 50 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2. As shown in Fig. 3c, the resulting Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF presents a substantially smaller Tafel slope of 30.5 mV dec−1 compared to Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (31.2 mV dec−1) and IrO2/NF (63.4 mV dec−1), suggesting greatly rapid kinetics toward the OER. Such prominent catalytic activity can make Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF the best OER electrocatalyst reported to date (Table S1†).28,40,48,49 These impressive results offer convincing proof that the introduction of Ru can effectively promote the oxygen evolution. In addition, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) according to the double layer capacitance (Cdl) approach was adopted to assess the electrocatalytic behavior of the as-designed electrodes, as displayed in Fig. S11† and 3d. The calculated Cdl value of 4.45 mF cm−2 for Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF is 1.9 time larger than that of Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (2.33 mF cm−2), implying maximal exposure of electrochemically active centers in Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF benefitting from interfacial engineering between different constituents and a 3D conductive support. Moreover, the ECSA normalized LSV curves shown in Fig. S12† further confirm the enhanced intrinsic OER electroactivity for the as-fabricated Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrode.

(d) Plots of the current density versus the scan rate. (e) LSV curves of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF before and after 1000 cycles. (f) Durability test of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF at 50 and 100 mA cm−2. 
As is well-known, long-time durability is also an important factor for practical applications. The LSV curves of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF remain almost unchanged after continuous 1000 cycles as depicted in Fig. 3e. Meanwhile, the chronoamperometric responses shown in Fig. 3f present a negligible current decay at 50 mA cm−2 for 10 h and 100 mA cm−2 for 10 and 110 h (Fig. S13,†), respectively, strongly evidencing the excellent long-term stability of the obtained electrode toward the OER. As can be seen from Fig. S14,† the SEM images of the post-OER hybrid are similar to those of the initial. Fig. S15† shows the PXRD patterns of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF before and after the stability test for the OER. No new peaks can be observed, which may be relevant to the formation of amorphous feature of the surface layer.34 Particularly, it is worth noting that the signals corresponding to Ni/Fe/Ru–P in the Ni 2p (Fig. S16a†), Fe 2p (Fig. S16b†), and Ru 3p spectra (Fig. S16c†), respectively, almost disappear, which coincide with the marked decrease of the P–M signal in the P 2P spectrum (Fig. S16d†). Consequently, these aforementioned results undoubtedly certify that the surface of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF may be oxidized into amorphous Ni-/Fe-/Ru-oxides and/or -hydroxides during the OER process,37,44 which are considered to be the real catalytic OER species.
Hydrogen evolution reaction measurement
The as-prepared Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF was also investigated for the electrocatalytic HER in a basic electrolyte (1.0 M KOH) and comparisons were made with Ni2P–Fe2P/NF and commercial Pt–C catalysts. As revealed in Fig. 4a, Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF shows excellent electroactivity for the HER, only requiring an overpotential of 78.6 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2 current density, which is slightly higher than that of commercial Pt–C/NF (40.1 mV), but much lower than that of Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (124.5 mV). Such a lower overpotential can be comparable to most of reported electrocatalysts toward the HER (Table S2†).31,40,48,49 Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the overpotential values at 50, 100, and 200 mA cm−2, respectively, follow the trend of Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (122.6, 229.9, and 266.2 mV) > Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF (89.2, 188.1, and 229.8 mV) > Pt–C/NF (63.9, 152.2, and 195.2 mV), demonstrated in Fig. 4b. The Tafel slope of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF (85.1 mV dec−1) is slightly smaller than that of Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (88.5 mV dec−1), implying the fast HER kinetics with the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (Fig. 4c).35,41 Therefore, the substantial enhancement of electrochemical performance for the HER should originate from the synergistic contribution of ternary phosphides. In comparison with Ni2P–Fe2P/NF (194.6 mF cm−2), a larger Cdl value of 279.7 mF cm−2 for Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF is obtained (Fig. S17† and 4c), powerfully signifying rich available electroactive sites which are helpful to enhance HER performance. Besides, Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF also shows outstanding electrocatalytic durability toward the HER (Fig. 4e, f, and S18†). After consecutively operating for 1000 cycles, and 10 and 110 h, slight current deterioration can be detected. Simultaneously, the SEM images (Fig. S19†) and PXRD pattern (Fig. S20†) of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF after the HER test reconfirm that the morphological and structural characteristics can be well-preserved, suggesting robust stability of the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrode throughout the hydrogen evolution process.

Overall water splitting measurement
Encouraged by the superior OER and HER performance, a two-electrode system for full water splitting was fabricated with two pieces of Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF in 1.0 M KOH solution, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5a. Amazedly, the designed Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF couple shows remarkable catalytic behavior with the cell voltages of 1.49 and 1.74 V to provide 10 and 50 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. 5b), respectively. In sharp contrast, the benchmark Pt–C/NF//IrO2/NF requires higher voltages of 1.64 and 1.87 V to achieve the corresponding current density. Such a lower voltage for full water-splitting for the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF couple is comparable, even superior to that of most reported self-supported electrode materials up to now,32,40,48 powerfully evidencing that the designed Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF can serve as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst to generate H2 and O2 at the same time. The Tafel slope of the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF couple determined to be around 172.7 mV dec−1 (Fig. 5c), is smaller than that of Pt–C/NF//IrO2/NF (233.1 mV dec−1), which coincides with the results of LSV curves. Moreover, the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF-related electrolyzer displays the excellent long-term stability, which can continuously operate well for at least 10 h with a negligible decay (Fig. 5d).

Additionally, an H-type electrolytic configuration for overall water splitting is schematically shown in Fig. 6a, which can be used to collect the produced H2 and O2 gases through a water drainage strategy. The relevant digital photograph of the electrolyzer separated by a proton exchange membrane is shown in Fig. 6b. Furthermore, the amounts of H2 and O2 generation can be detected at a constant time of 180 s (Fig. 6c and d). Impressively, 3.2 mL H2 and 1.6 mL O2 could be achieved with 12 min examination (Fig. 6e), respectively. This matches well with the theoretically calculated volume ratio of 2:1, suggesting a faradaic efficiency of approximately 100% toward overall water splitting. That is, all electrons on the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrode can be applied to the generation of H2 and O2. These above data significantly prove that Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF is an effective and durable electrocatalyst for overall water electrolysis. Considering the potential for the practical application, a commercial AA battery of 1.5 V (NANFU) and solar cell are adopted to offer the power of water splitting for the Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF//Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF device setup, respectively. Strikingly, continuous production of vigorous bubbles at both the cathode and anode can be intuitively observed (Fig. 6f, g and Video S1†), which are assignable to H2 and O2, respectively, reconfirming its feasibility for widespread industrial applications in the future.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we have demonstrated ultrathin Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P nanosheet arrays supported on NF through a feasible and economic approach, which exhibits many appealing advantages including well-resolved heterointerfaces, remarkable electron conductivity, and a porous matrix, together with hydrophilic characteristics. The obtained Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF electrode displays outstanding catalytic performance and long-time stability toward the OER and HER in alkaline solutions, respectively. Impressively, using it as a bifunctional catalyst, the constructed two-electrode electrolyzer Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF//Ni2P–Fe2P–Ru2P/NF shows a cell voltage of 1.49 V for overall water splitting to achieve 10 mA cm−2, nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, and excellent durability. Moreover, it can be also driven by a solar cell for hydrogen production. This work opens a new avenue for the construction of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts toward energy storage and conversion.
