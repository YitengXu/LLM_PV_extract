Current photovoltaic and artificial photosynthetic systems require improvements and include the development of: 1) inexpensive, abundant, non-toxic charge separation catalysts that absorb visible light; 2) stable catalysts with high turnover numbers that possess self-healing mechanisms to prevent photo corrosion; 3) catalysts capable of oxidizing a broad range of electron donors; and 4) hybrid organic/inorganic nano architectures that bridge charge flow from electron donors to electron acceptors. The ferritin nanocage is a model system of such an organic/inorganic hybrid catalyst capable of overcoming these photochemical limitations.
Introduction
The driving force to develop more efficient PV systems to replace fossil fuels has increased because of: 1) environmental problems related to CO2 emissions; 2) dwindling fossil fuel reserves; and 3) political unrest in countries that have abundant oil supplies. These issues have caused an increase in market demand for renewable energy and have driven many advances in photovoltaic systems.1
The first commercially available photovoltaic (PV) systems or first-generation PV systems were constructed using silicon technology and used monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon or amorphous silicon (Fig. 1A).2,3 Silicon is not the best material for photovoltaic systems, because it requires thick layers ~100 μM for efficient light absorption, which increases the cost of the PV cells, but silicon-processing technologies allowed it to be a dominant material in early PV technology.3–5 Typical amorphous and polycrystalline silicon systems are less efficient but monocrystalline systems are more efficient (28%)2 and are reaching their theoretical limit of 31%.6
 Fig. 1  (a) Silicon solar cells: amorphous (top), polycrystalline (center), monocrystalline (bottom). (b) Thin film solar cell. (c) Organic solar cell. 
Second-generation PV charge separation catalysts have been synthesized using thin films to try to produce PV cells at lower cost than silicon. Some of the most promising materials include cadmium telluride, gallium arsenide and copper indium gallium selenide (Fig. 1B).1 These advances have provided new competitors for silicon PV systems as the efficiencies of these second-generation PV materials have recently passed 20%.4,7 However, the low natural abundance of the elements used for these second-generation solar cells and toxicity issues make these photo catalysts unsuitable for large-scale mass production to replace fossil fuels.7 Other advances in the second-generation solar cell arena include, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC), with efficiencies around 10% and organic solar cells (OSC) (Fig. 1C) with efficiencies over 10%.8–10 These advances are reaching efficiencies that make these second-generation PV systems competitive with silicon.1,4,7,10
Future PV systems must possess increased efficiency and lower production costs before solar power can replace fossil fuels. To achieve these goals, third-generation PV systems are focusing on nano-structure based devices and nano-material architectures that possess unique properties to maximize light harvesting and facilitate energy conversion reactions.1 Several promising technologies for third-generation PV systems include colloidal quantum dot PV systems where the quantum dots are imbedded in membranes,11 or hybrid systems composed of organic and inorganic mixtures.1,12 Hybrid chemical/biological PV systems are one area of active research.
A comparison of photosynthesis to PV systems was performed to better understand how nature harvests light from the sun.13,14 The ultimate goal is to mimic photosynthesis and oxidize water but it should be noted that nature did not start by oxidizing water but started with more easily oxidized molecules. An example of this evolutionary process is purple photosynthetic bacteria where the electron donors were molecules such as sulfur-containing molecules, hydrogen or other organic molecules. Efforts to create artificial systems to oxidize biomass are following this same strategy.
Using the model provided by nature, bio photo electrochemical fuel cells have been successfully developed.15,16 Algae and cyanobacteria were used to harvest solar energy and transfer it to electron acceptors present in the growth medium.17,18 Other systems include hybrid dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) where enzymes break down biomass and convert oxidized substrates into electron rich molecules that subsequently donate electrons to the photo anode in the fuel cells.19 These systems range from poor efficiency (0.3–2%) to efficiencies similar to commercial PV systems (12%). However, a major drawback to bio photo electrochemical fuel cells is the poor stability of the enzymes or cyanobacteria that act as catalysts.
The transition from biomass oxidation to water oxidation is a priority because of the abundance of water as a substrate and production of hydrogen as a product. Hydrogen represents a fuel that can be stored for use when solar radiation is not available (night) or less abundant (cloudy days or winter).20 We briefly outline efforts to develop water oxidation catalysts and how they are coupled to light harvesting systems to produce hydrogen gas.
A ruthenium complex known as the blue dimer was the first synthetic water oxidation catalyst.21 Since that seminal study, water oxidation has been observed with a variety of catalysts. Our intent here is not to review the field of water oxidation catalysts as that has been done in several recent reviews.14,22–25 However, we emphasize that many of these successful studies have used expensive catalysts or noble metal catalysts that will be cost prohibitive for mass-production to meet global solar energy demands.
In contrast, the last 5 years have produced remarkable breakthroughs in water oxidation catalysts using earth abundant transition metals.20,26–33 This has driven a renewed effort for studying these metals and their metal oxides, sulfides, phosphates and borates, for oxygen and hydrogen evolution. Remarkably these catalysts have been coupled to light harvesting devices and the solar energy has been harvested and used to drive water splitting.23,30
The successful synthesis of third-generation PV systems is proposed to require a combination of organic/inorganic hybrid nanomaterials made from earth abundant transition metals. To be successful, these third generation catalysts must overcome several significant challenges to meet global solar energy needs. First, earth abundant catalysts need to be developed that will absorb visible light because 44% of solar energy is found in the visible region of the spectrum. One solution is to develop stacked cells (see Fig. 2A) with a variety of light harvesting molecules that absorb different wavelengths of light.34,35 A second method to increase efficiency is through carrier multiplication or allowing each photon to cause multiple electronic excitation events. Schaller et al. reported carrier multiplication reactions with PbS and PbSe that maximize the number of electrons that are excited (up to seven excitons by a single photon) (Fig. 2B).36 Second, production of stable catalysts with high turnover numbers is required. One method to improve turnover numbers is to develop self-healing catalysts to maximize catalyst stability.28 Third, biomass oxidation may be an intermediate between current systems and water oxidation. The development of catalysts capable of oxidizing a broad range of abundant electron donors such as glucose or glycerol may sustain energy demands until water oxidation system are fully developed. A fourth goal is to increase the rate and efficiency of electron transfer out of the charge separation catalysts to the electron acceptors in order to prevent charge recombination. One mechanism to do this is to tether the charge separation catalyst directly to the electron-harvesting molecule so that the excited electrons can be siphoned away from the charge separation catalyst to drive the reaction forward. The development of molecules or architectures that bridge the electron donor and electron acceptor molecules to limit recombination and improve electron transfer to the electron acceptor is required.14,36,37

In this review we outline how ferritin possesses important properties that can be used as a model system for the development of future third generation photo catalysts. Ferritin is a protein complex composed of 24 similar polypeptide subunits that assemble into a hollow spherical protein nanocage. Ferritin possesses channels that allow metal ions to enter and leave the cavity (Fig. 3).38 Nucleation sites on the interior of the ferritin cavity allow for mineralization of metal oxides making ferritin a naturally occurring organic/inorganic hybrid material. Ferritin has an exterior diameter of 12 nm and an interior diameter of 8 nm resulting in a 2 nm thick, light transparent, protein shell that separates the mineral from the exterior solution. Ferritin can accommodate up to 4500 Fe ions as a ferrihydrite mineral. It is a thermo stable protein (up to 80 °C) and has good pH tolerance that ranges between pH 5–10. Ferritin naturally binds iron and in addition, non-native metals have been incorporated inside ferritin including transition metal oxides, sulfides, selenides and oxoanions (Table 1). Additionally, once these transition metals have been deposited inside ferritin it is possible to reduce them to their elemental form using strong reductants.39

Metal oxides are known semiconductors and light is known to excite electronic transitions in these minerals. Ferritin has been studied for its photochemical properties and promotes important oxidation and reduction reactions.40–42Fig. 4 represents the photochemical reactions that take place. The photochemical properties of ferritin are described in more detail in Section 1 below.
 Fig. 4  Challenges of the 3rd generation photo catalysts that ferritin can overcome: 1. ferritin can be prepared with a variety of mineral cores with different band gaps. This allows the synthesis of tunable band gap materials in ferritin. Ferritin can also be attached to transparent electrodes with the goal that electrodes layered with different ferritin minerals can create stacked light harvesting arrays. 2. Self-healing catalysts are important for durability. Ferritin possesses a ferroxidase center (FC) with ferroxidase activity that prevents photo corrosion allowing the Photo catalyst mineral to be re-synthesized if photo corrosion occurs. 3. Ferritin is capable of biomass oxidation. Ferritin has been used to successfully oxidize organic acids, “sulfhydryl groups, alcohols, Good's buffers, amines, glucose, gluconic acid, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. 4. Ferritin can form nano architectures and can be functionalized for electron harvesting capabilities. These properties can limit charge recombination and direct electrons to electrodes for battery and fuel cell applications. Ferritin can donate electrons to, metal ions (e.g.: Cu, Au), redox dyes (viologens) and proteins (cytochrome c). 
Ferritin assembles in hexagonal close packed arrays on silicon or gold surfaces and such ordered packing allows the encapsulated cargo to be organized into nano architectures.43 (Figures of nano architectures of ferritin and the characterization of these assemblies are available in the reference of Yamashita (2010).) These nano architectures might possess unique properties for light harvesting or for oxidative charge separation reactions. Additionally the exterior of ferritin can be functionalized with chemical “handles” to allow the attachment of light absorbing molecules or to trigger assembly of nano architectures that will allow ferritin to be assembled into 3-dimensional arrays or tethered to other molecules.44,45 Ultimately, the recent advances in transition metal oxide water oxidation catalysts20,26–33 and the ability to assemble ferritin into nano architectures might be combined to produce third generation photo catalysts capable of light harvesting and water oxidation to produce hydrogen (see Fig. 5).23 Below we expand on the four goals listed in the abstract that are required to improve photo catalysis and demonstrate that ferritin possesses or can be chemically altered to exhibit these desired properties. Fig. 4 represents the properties ferritin possesses that make it a model system for achieving these goals and this figure will be referred to throughout the review.
 Fig. 5  Ferritin nano architecture for light harvesting and water oxidation. Our ultimate goal is to combine the light harvesting properties of ferritin with the water oxidizing or hydrogen evolving properties of the metal oxide catalysts. This figure represents a model illustrating how such a goal could be realized. 
1. The development of inexpensive, abundant, non-toxic charge separation catalysts that absorb visible light
Iron oxides are photo catalysts that undergo charge separation reactions when illuminated.46 In addition, light can catalyze the photochemical oxidation of organic molecules complexed with iron.47,48 Colloidal suspensions of iron oxide nanoparticles function as photo catalysts but their solubility is limited and their catalytic stability is short lived due to photo-corrosion in aqueous solutions. Photo corrosion occurs when Fe(III) oxide minerals are photo reduced to Fe2+ (aq.) followed by oxidation back to Fe3+ (aq.), which rapidly precipitates as rust Fe(OH)3 (s.). Metal oxides of other transition metals possess the same photochemical properties and also undergo photo corrosion.49,50
Metal oxide nanoparticles are not soluble but when metal oxides are encapsulated inside ferritin, the protein shell, which is soluble, allows the metal oxides to be dispersed in solution. Relatively high concentrations of the metal oxides can be achieved when solubilized in ferritin. For example, a 10 mg mL−1 solution of ferritin containing 2000 metal ions per ferritin would have a metal concentration of 44 mM. The ability of ferritin to disperse the metal oxide minerals in solution effectively increases the probability of light interacting with these metal oxide catalysts and improves the probability of charge separation reactions.
The first photochemical studies of ferritin were demonstrated in plant ferritin,51 followed by UV light exposure studies to determine if iron in ferritin could be photo reduced and released as Fe2+ (aq.), which can act as a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).52–54 Since these initial reports of ferritin photochemistry, ferritin has been shown to act as a powerful reducing agent for photo reducing redox dyes (viologens), proteins (cytochrome c) and metal ions (Cu2+ and Au3+).40
Nikandrov proposed and evaluated a variety of mechanisms for electron transfer from the iron oxide interior, through the ferritin protein shell, to the electron acceptors. After a series of control experiments he concluded that the reaction proceeded through a valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) transition and electron tunneling through the protein shell.40,55,56
The work described above used near UV light to catalyze the photochemical reactions. The ability to efficiently harvest the full solar spectrum from UV light throughout the entire visible range to the near IR is an important goal to achieve. Therefore, developing ferritin photo catalysts that absorb light at different wavelengths in the visible portion of the spectrum is an essential goal for maximizing light harvesting. Ferritin, with a ferrihydrite core, has a reported band gap in the range of 2.5–3.5 eV, which means that light between 350 nm to 500 nm will excite electrons from the CB to the VB.57,58
The iron mineral can be removed from iron-containing ferritin (referred to as holoferritin) by reduction and chelation of the iron producing an iron-free protein shell called apoferritin. The iron core can be reconstituted inside ferritin by the following reaction.4Fe2+ + apoferritin + O2 + 4H+ → 4Fe3+(inside ferritin as Fe(O)OH) + 2H2O
Divalent metal ions of most of the first row transition metals can be substituted into this reaction equation to prepare cores of Mn(O)OH, Co(O)OH, Ni(O)OH, as well as other metal hydroxide species (see Table 1 for a complete list of minerals synthesized inside ferritin). Similar strategies have been used to synthesize a variety of other minerals and quantum dot materials inside ferritin. The procedures and methods for these synthetic reactions can be found in references in Table 1.
The ability to synthesize ferritin with a large variety of mineral cores (Table 1) with different VB to CB transitions provides the opportunity to create “wavelength tunable” photo catalysts inside ferritin.59 For example, replacing the ferrihydrite mineral core (2.5–3.5 eV, 350–500 nm) with CdS (2.4 eV, 516 nm), CdSe (1.8 eV, 688 nm) or GaAs (1.42 eV, 873 nm) will change the wavelength of light required to excite electrons from the VB to the CB. Altering the minerals sequestered inside ferritin will allow us to tune the wavelength of light that is absorbed by ferritin (Fig. 2 and 4). Additionally, altering the anions from oxide to phosphate, borate or sulfide provides other methods for tuning the band gaps and altering the wavelengths of light absorbed by the minerals.60,61 Efforts are underway in our laboratory to use these techniques to prepare ferritin minerals that absorb strongly in all regions of the visible spectrum.
Generally, one photon of light is able to produce one charge separation event. Schaller et al. reported that PbS and PbSe nanoparticles are able to exhibit multiple carrier effects where one photon of light was able to produce multiple excitons (Fig. 2B).36 In fact, their study showed that up to 7 excitations could be generated by one photon of light using PbS. Bulk materials are less likely to perform carrier multiplication effects but nanoparticles possess the ability to produce this charge carrier phenomenon. PbS has been synthesized inside ferritin but these samples have not yet been tested for charge multiplication effects. Perhaps the hybrid nature of ferritin containing PbS or other charge multiplication effect materials will further enhance solar energy harvesting.
2. Development of stable catalysts with high turnover numbers that possess self-healing mechanisms to prevent photo corrosion
Nanoparticles of ferrihydrite (Fe(O)OH) can catalyze photo reduction reactions, but their activity is short lived because the ferrihydrite particles undergo reductive photo corrosion.49,50 Photo catalysis stops when Fe2+ ions are oxidized to Fe3+ and precipitate by hydrolysis forming an amorphous precipitate.
Ferritin can overcome photo corrosion and maintains the Fe(O)OH mineral in an active form. The protein shell is transparent to light and allows light to interact with the Fe(O)OH mineral causing charge separation to occur in the semi-conductor mineral. If Fe2+ forms, it migrates to an enzyme site called the ferroxidase center, where it is re-oxidized to Fe3+.62 The ferroxidase center catalytic site is found at the center of the H-ferritin subunits so Fe2+ does not leave the protective confines of the ferritin protein shell. Once iron is oxidized at the ferroxidase center, the Fe3+ ions migrate back to the ferritin interior and are reincorporated into the mineral core. Ferroxidase activity stops iron from moving into the surrounding solution and keeps the catalytic particle substantially unaltered.
For most catalysts, the surface of the catalyst is critical for activity so interactions of the protein shell with the catalyst surface might impose limitations to the reaction. In the case of ferritin, these protein–metal interactions appear to be required to sustain an active catalyst because control reactions with Fe(O)OH nanoparticles show rapid photo corrosion and precipitation of iron.
Similar reactions occur with other metals artificially deposited inside ferritin suggesting that the ferroxidase enzyme active site can function as a self-healing mineralization enzyme for photochemical reactions.63,64 Ensign demonstrated that ferritin was capable of repeated photochemical reactions without changes to the rate of Cu(0) nanoparticle formation and with only a small amount of protein degradation.41 However, the long-term stability of photochemical reactions of metal oxides inside ferritin has not been extensively studied. In general, ferritin is a very stable protein and potentially ferritin from thermophilic organisms will enhance its stability in photochemical reactions.65,66
3. Development of photo catalysts capable of oxidizing a broad range of electron donors
One goal of this work is to mimic nature and develop synthetic photo catalysts capable of oxidizing abundant sources of biomass such as glucose or glycerol with the future goal of developing photo catalysts capable of oxidizing water. Nikandrov et al. showed that illumination of ferritin with light below 400 nm catalyzed the photo-oxidation of organic molecules and donated the electrons to external electron acceptors. A variety of electron donors have been studied and include organic acids, sulfhydryl groups, alcohols, Good's buffers and amines40,58,67 and additionally we have observed the oxidation of glucose, gluconate, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde (unpublished data). Although the mechanism of oxidation of these electron donors is not yet established, it is possible that the ferroxidase center of ferritin may be involved in the oxidation of these molecules as reported by Zhang et al. for 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer.68
4. Developing hybrid organic/inorganic nano architectures that bridge charge flow from electron donors, through the catalyst to electron acceptors
A variety of electron acceptors have been used in the ferritin photochemical system and include Cr(VI), Cu(II), Au(III), viologens and cytochrome c.40–42,57 The redox potential of the electron acceptors characterized to date include acceptors with positive potentials such as Au3+ (+1.18 V) and negative potentials such as viologens (−0.360 V). To harvest energy, the excited electrons must be accepted by molecules that will transfer the electrons to electrodes for fuel cell applications or for storage in batteries. Alternatively, the electrons can be used to produce energy rich molecules that can be used as fuels. For example the reduction of viologen species is promising because viologens are excellent mediators for donating electrons to electrodes in electrochemical cells. Additionally, methyl viologen has been used to successfully reduce protons to hydrogen, which is a fuel that can be stored.69 The fact that gold and copper nanoparticles are synthesized within ferritin (copper) or on the exterior surface of ferritin (gold) may allow these metals to be “built in” in situ electrodes for electrochemical applications.41,42
Additionally, ferritin is known to naturally bind directly to gold and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surfaces or can be chemically modified for covalent attachment to electrodes.70–75 Attaching ferritin to a light transparent ITO electrode is particularly useful for photochemical applications.76 Ferritin possesses inherent redox properties in the protein shell that allows efficient electron transfer from the iron core, through the protein, directly to the electrode. Additionally, ferritin isolated from bacteria contains up to 12 heme groups that function to mediate electron transfer across the protein shell.44,77 If electron transfer becomes limiting in reactions with mammalian ferritin, a switch to bacterial ferritin may further enhance electron transfer to electrodes. The direct linkage of ferritin to electrodes will couple photochemical oxidation of biomass molecules directly into battery or fuel cell systems.
There are two critical issues associated with the electrons as they move through photochemical systems that limit the efficiency of the reactions. The first issue is charge recombination where excited electrons fall back to the original state.78 The second limitation is charge build-up that occurs when local concentrations of charge inhibit the reactions from proceeding.
The hybrid organic/inorganic nature of ferritin prevents charge recombination by stabilizing the excited electronic state. Nikandrov demonstrated that light caused the excitation of an electron into the conduction band of the iron oxide cluster of ferritin and the excited electron was relatively stable (microsecond time scale) because: 1) the hole created in the valence band is rapidly filled by oxidation of the sacrificial electron donors; 2) the ferritin iron core is capable of delocalizing the electron throughout the core to enhance stability; and 3) both the iron core and the protein shell are redox active and can “store” the electron(s) until an electron acceptor is encountered in solution.40,56
Photosynthesis prevents charge build-up reactions by proton-coupled electron transport.14 Electron and proton transport pathways have evolved in trans membrane protein complexes that allow rapid equilibration of charge to prevent charge build up that is inhibitory to the next charge separation event. Artificial systems are limited by charge build up and this slows the reactions and limits the energy produced by the charge separation.78
Remarkably ferritin has evolved mechanisms to alleviate charge build up (Fig. 4). As iron enters or leaves ferritin, the oxidation state of the iron changes between Fe2+ and Fe3+. These redox reactions involve electron transfer across the protein shell for iron oxidation or reduction and require efficient proton-coupled electron transfer to allow positive charge to accompany the negative charge of the electron. The ferritin protein shell is redox active and mediates these redox reactions.56 These properties allow ferritin to act as a “membrane” that mediates charge transfer reactions and controls ion gradients similar to the cellular membranes that allow photosynthetic reactions in plants.55,56,79 Additionally, ferritin possesses other ion transport mechanisms where anions are selectively and rapidly transported into and out of ferritin to balance charge (Fig. 4).80
The ferritin protein contains a large number of amino acid R groups or functional groups that provide the appropriate chemical entities for adding a variety of chemical functional groups that can tether ferritin to surfaces or be used for assembling architectures (Fig. 4).44,45 Without any modifications ferritin can be deposited in monolayers and in multi-layers on a variety of surfaces in very ordered arrays.43 These assemblies may further enhance light harvesting, enhance charge separation reactions and mediate the flow of charge carriers to increase efficiency of solar energy harvesting. Additionally, light-harvesting molecules may be attached to the exterior of ferritin to further enhance light absorption and increase solar energy harvesting (Fig. 4).44
Future directions
Earth abundant transition metal catalysts have been prepared that oxidize water or evolve hydrogen.23,30,31 Incorporating these water-oxidizing catalysts into hybrid organic/inorganic light harvesting nano architectures with enhanced charge separation and electron transfer pathways will allow photochemistry to be coupled to hydrogen evolution or water oxidation.30 Additionally, tuning the band gap of these light-harvesting architectures to absorb solar radiation in the visible spectrum will increase the energy harvested.
We propose a ferritin photochemical model system (Fig. 5) that will incorporate all of the benefits of ferritin coupled to the water oxidation or hydrogen evolution catalysts presented in this review. We propose that mineralizing the right blend of metals and anions inside ferritin will allow us to create light harvesting semiconductors or quantum dots. In other ferritin molecules, water oxidation catalysts such as a cobalt phosphate catalyst will be prepared. A ferritin containing a light harvesting ferritin mineral will be tethered to a ferritin containing a water oxidation catalyst through an electron conducting linker. Upon illumination, we propose that water may be oxidized or hydrogen evolved. We propose that the advantages of ferritin will provide a model system for studying the ability of hybrid inorganic/organic nano architectures to function in solar energy harvesting.

 	Fig. 4  Challenges of the 3rd generation photo catalysts that ferritin can overcome: 1. ferritin can be prepared with a variety of mineral cores with different band gaps. This allows the synthesis of tunable band gap materials in ferritin. Ferritin can also be attached to transparent electrodes with the goal that electrodes layered with different ferritin minerals can create stacked light harvesting arrays. 2. Self-healing catalysts are important for durability. Ferritin possesses a ferroxidase center (FC) with ferroxidase activity that prevents photo corrosion allowing the Photo catalyst mineral to be re-synthesized if photo corrosion occurs. 3. Ferritin is capable of biomass oxidation. Ferritin has been used to successfully oxidize organic acids, “sulfhydryl groups, alcohols, Good's buffers, amines, glucose, gluconic acid, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde. 4. Ferritin can form nano architectures and can be functionalized for electron harvesting capabilities. These properties can limit charge recombination and direct electrons to electrodes for battery and fuel cell applications. Ferritin can donate electrons to, metal ions (e.g.: Cu, Au), redox dyes (viologens) and proteins (cytochrome c).	 

 	Fig. 5  Ferritin nano architecture for light harvesting and water oxidation. Our ultimate goal is to combine the light harvesting properties of ferritin with the water oxidizing or hydrogen evolving properties of the metal oxide catalysts. This figure represents a model illustrating how such a goal could be realized.
