    , Accepted 12th August 2021First published on 12th August 2021AbstractDevelopment of renewable energies is in parallel with improving high-performance energy storage devices, which can store maximum solar or wind energy and power. Herein, asymmetric energy storage systems are constructed from phosphorus-doped nickel sulfide (P-doped NiS) and biomass-derived humic acid (HA) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Initially, nickel sulfide (NiS) nanostructures are directly grown onto nickel foam (NF) via a hydrothermal step. P-doping into the NiS bulk is carried out through a simple hydrothermal process as well. Also, HA is activated via carbonization treatment (A-HA) for employing as the negative electrode's active material. The P-doped NiS–NF delivers a considerable specific capacity of 486.7 mA h g−1 at 6 A g−1 and the A-HA–NF exhibits a specific capacitance of 163.3 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) benefits from a wide operating potential window (1.6 V), remarkable energy density (36.32 W h kg−1), and reasonable power density (199.95 W kg−1). The promising electrochemical behavior endows the ASCs with significant applications in electrochemical energy storage systems.
1. Introduction
The development of high-performance supercapacitors has strongly linked to the elaborate electrode material's architecture, which endows them with high electrical conductivity, high surface area, appropriate electrochemical activity, and chemical stability.1–3 Owing to superior charge storage performance such as high theoretical capacitance/capacity, thermal and mechanical stability, low electronegativity, and high electrical conductivity, transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have found widespread application in electrochemical energy storage devices.4–6 To date, a variety of metal sulfides such as nickel sulfide, zinc sulfide, cobalt sulfide, molybdenum sulfide, and copper sulfide have been widely studied as electroactive materials for supercapacitors.1 Receiving benefits from excellent capacitive behavior together with different phases and morphologies has made nickel sulfide a promising candidate for the fabrication of supercapacitors.7,8 Despite the high theoretical capacity/capacitance, nickel sulfides suffer from low electrical conductivity, which limits the kinetics of the electron transfer processes.2 A potential strategy to enhance the electrochemical features and conductivity of active materials is heteroatom doping in which nitrogen, boron, or phosphorus is incorporated into the host materials.9–11 Phosphorus embedded in the material's matrix can boost capacitive performance by improving the electrical conductivity and chemical and mechanical stability.12–14 Moreover, hetero-element doping provides the advantage of more active sites as a result of structural distortion and alteration according to computational and experimental reports.15–18 Additionally, direct deposition of active materials onto the current collector can guarantee high electrical conductivity, facile ion transport, remarkable capacitive performance, and chemical stability of the electrodes.4,11,19 Moreover, compared to the sulfur element, phosphorus benefits from higher atomic radius and lower electronegativity, which can enhance the redox activity and charge storage performance of the active materials. The simultaneous presence of sulfur and phosphorus in the active material's matrix may lead to high capacity/capacitance, high electrical conductivity, appropriate stability, and suitable electrochemical activity. Therefore, direct fabrication of P-doped nickel sulfide nanostructures onto the nickel foam (NF) can lead to high electrical conductivity, appropriate surface area, fast ion delivery, and remarkable charge storage behavior.
Although the positive electrode is mostly concerned in designing ASCs, the role of the negative electrode in the overall performance of the cell is critical as well.4,20 Carbonaceous matrices are predominantly employed as negative electrode materials, which secure long life expectancy and high power density of the ASCs.4,11 As a direct consequence of the depletion of fossil-based carbons and the dire environmental impact of their consumption, tremendous research attention has been paid towards finding renewable, eco-benign, and low-cost alternatives.21,22 Considering the carbon-rich structure, natural abundance, low-cost, environmental benignity, and renewability, HA can be regarded as an advantageous biomass-derived carbon-containing electrode material.23,24 HA can be abundantly found in lake sediments, soil, compost, and brown coal as a result of the bio-decomposition of plants and animal remains.23–25 HA is an organic macromolecule that consists of various oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic/aromatic groups, and serves as the carbon skeleton.23–25 Moreover, the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen and sulfur within the HA composition can increase the electroactive sites.26 In a study, Beall's group reported that HA has similar physical and structural properties such as wrinkled sheet-like structure, surface polarity, IG/ID value, C/O ratio, and particle size to those of graphene oxide (GO).27 Consequently, an electrode constructed from HA not only exhibits similarities to GO, but also is inexpensive, simple processed, and green.
In the present work, nickel sulfide nanostructures were directly grown on the NF via a one-step hydrothermal process. Afterward, phosphorus was doped into the NiS nanostructures through a hydrothermal step. This architecture provides more active sites for faradaic reactions due to increasing nonstoichiometric sites and structural distortion. Moreover, P-doped nickel sulfide benefits from the synergetic effect, which can enhance the electrochemical activity of the electrode. In addition, HA was used as an eco-friendly active material for the preparation of the negative electrode through a carbonization process. Electrochemical measurements were carried out for both positive and negative electrodes. The two-electrode asymmetric cell was assembled using the P-doped NiS–NF as the positive electrode, A-HA–NF as the negative electrode, and KOH (3 M) as the electrolyte solution. The obtained electrochemical results indicate that the prepared ASC benefits from superior specific capacity, high energy and power densities, wide potential window (1.6 V), and appropriate life stability as well.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals, instruments and devices
NF and commercial HA were obtained from Wuzhou HGP Advanced Materials Technology Corp., Ltd (China) and Barankood (Iran), respectively. Sulfur powder, ethylene glycol, ethylenediamine, NaH2PO2, NaOH, H2SO4, and KOH were purchased from Merck Company. Deionized (DI) water (Zolalan Sharif Pars water purification system ZU101-B, Iran) was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions in all steps.
Characterization and surface investigations were carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (TESCAN, MIRA III LMU, Czech Republic) coupled with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) probe, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Spectrum 100 Optica FT-IR Spectrometer, PerkinElmer, USA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) (X'Pert Pro MPD, PANalytical, using Cu Kα radiation), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5000 VersaProbe III, using an Al X-ray source, Physical Electronics, Inc, USA), Raman spectroscopy (BRUKER, SENTERRA, Germany), and a surface area analyzer (BET, Bel, Belsorp mini II, Japan). A tube furnace (Arta Co., Iran) was used for HA carbonization. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT 204 (Metrohm, Netherlands)).
2.2. Preparation of the P-doped NiS–NF
The preparation of the NiS nanostructures was carried out through a hydrothermal process. Briefly, a solution containing 5 mL ethylene glycol, 5 mL ethanol, and 5 mL ethylenediamine was prepared and mixed under magnetic stirring for 10 min. Afterward, 0.064 g sulfur powder was added to the prepared solution, and the stirring was continued for an additional 10 min. Then, the obtained solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, and a piece of 1 cm × 3 cm NF was dipped into the solution. The Teflon-lined autoclave was thoroughly sealed and maintained at 160 °C for 8 h. After the hydrothermal reaction was completed, the NiS–NF was taken out of the autoclave, washed with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight.
Phosphorus was introduced into the NiS–NF following a hydrothermal step. The prepared NiS–NF was placed into an autoclave containing a 10 mL solution of NaH2PO2 (0.146 mM). The P-doping reaction occurred in a sealed Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 °C for 6 h. Finally, the P-doped NiS–NF was rinsed with DI water and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The fabricated electrode was labeled as P-doped NiS–NF and the mass loading of the electrode active material was 2.53 mg cm−2 (Scheme 1).

2.3. Preparation of the A-HA–NF electrodes
To prepare A-HA as the negative active material, HA was washed with NaOH (1 M), H2SO4 (1 M), and DI water, respectively. Then the resultant solid was dried at 60 °C overnight. Afterward, the sample was carbonized in a tube furnace under an Ar atmosphere at 900 °C (heating rate of 7.5 °C min−1) for 4 h. Afterward, a mixture of the activated HA, carbon black, and 10% poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) with a mass ratio of 16:3:1 was prepared and coated on a piece of NF (1 cm × 1 cm). The prepared electrode was kept at 160 °C for 2 h. The fabricated electrode was labeled as A-HA–NF and the mass loading of the prepared electrode was 5.21 mg cm−2 (Scheme 2).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The positive electrode characterization

Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the FE-SEM images of the NiS–NFs at different magnifications. Direct construction of the NiS nanostructures on NF is obviously shown. At higher resolutions, the formation of sphere-like NiS–NF particles can be observed (Fig. 1(b) and (c)). Further zooming reveals channels within the nanostructures, which can facilitate ion transport during electrochemical reactions (inset of Fig. 1(c)).12,28 In addition, the mapping (Fig. 1(d)) and EDS (Fig. S1(a)†) results demonstrate the presence of Ni, S, and O on the surface of the electrode. The surface morphology of the P-doped NiS–NF was also evaluated by FE-SEM, and the images are provided in Fig. 1(e)–(g). As shown in the figure, after the doping step, a structural distortion was observed, and nanocones of P-doped NiS were formed. The EDS spectrum (Fig. S1(b)†) and the corresponding maps (Fig. 1(h)) reveal the existence of P, Ni, S, and O elements on the surface of the electrode, affirming the successful P-doping of NiS.

FT-IR analysis was carried out to investigate the functional groups within the electrodes' structures (Fig. 2(a)). Observation of the strong broad band at about 3200–3700 cm−1 is associated with the O–H groups in the spectrum of the NiS–NF.4,11 The peaks appearing at 2924, 2878, and 1454 cm−1 can be attributed to the C–H vibrations coming from ethylenediamine and ethylene glycol precursors.11,29 In addition, vibration bands at 1603 and 1277 can be ascribed to the C–N group bending and stretching modes, originating from the ethylenediamine precursor.11,30 The presence of the SO groups can be confirmed by the appearance of the stretching vibrations at 1397 and 1030 cm−1.4,11,31 The peaks observed at 654, 612, and 527 cm−1 in the NiS–NF spectrum correspond to M–S (Ni–S).4,11,31 The FT-IR spectrum of the P-doped NiS–NF exhibits a broad band of the O–H groups at 3429 cm−1.32 Besides, the stretching mode of the SO groups at 1366 cm−1 indicates the formation of sulfonated structures.31 Furthermore, the peak appearing at 1042 cm−1 belongs to the P–O IR absorption, while the peak for the vibrations of M–S (Ni–S) is located at about 602 cm−1.4,31

Fig. 2(b) shows the XRD patterns of the NiS–NF and P-doped NiS–NF in the range of 10–80 degrees. The diffraction peak at 51.9° in both spectra corresponds to the (200) crystalline plane of face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel with JCPDS 65-2865. The peaks appearing at 2θ values of 21.8, 31.4, 38, 40.1, 44.6, 49.7, 50.1, 55.1, and 76.4 match with the (101), (110), (003), (021), (202), (113), (211), (122), and (205) crystal planes of NiS with a rhombohedral phase (JCPDS 44-1418). The XRD spectrum of the P-doped NiS–NF exhibits a very similar diffraction pattern to the NiS–NF one with a hexagonal phase (JCPDS 71-1682).33 The diffractions at 21.9, 31.2, 37.9, 38.4, 44.6, 49.9, 50.2, 55.3, and 76.5° can be indexed to the (101), (110), (003), (202), (113), (122), and (205) crystal planes of P-doped NiS.33
The surface chemical composition and valence states of the P-doped NiS–NFs were further investigated using XPS measurements and the results are provided in the ESI (Fig. S2†).
3.2. Electrochemical measurements of the P-doped NiS–NF positive electrodes
Electrochemical measurements of the positive electrodes were carried out in a three-electrode system (Hg/HgO as the reference electrode and a Pt plate as the counter electrode) in KOH (3 M) at ambient temperature. Fig. 3(a) shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the P-doped NiS–NF at sweep rates of 1 to 100 mV s−1. The presence of the obvious faradaic peaks in the curves denotes the battery-type behavior of the electrodes.34 Moreover, the large ΔEPa,c, which increases by increasing the potential sweep rate, verifies the quasi-reversible faradaic behavior of the P-doped NiS–NFs.35 To evaluate the charge storage performance of the P-doped NiS–NF and NiS–NF electrodes, their CVs were overlaid at 20 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3(b), P-doped NiS–NF electrodes benefit from higher current densities and area under the CV curve, indicating the improved capacitive performance compared to the NiS–NF electrodes.11 The charge storage mechanism of the P-doped NiS–NFs was further investigated through the log–log plot of anodic peak current densities and potential scan rates (Fig. 3(c)). According to the inset of the figure, the almost linear plot with a slope close to 0.5 confirms the diffusion-controlled faradaic activities of the electrode materials.35Fig. 3(d) shows the Randles–Sevcik plot of the P-doped NiS–NF in which a relatively linear correlation between redox peak current densities and the square root of the potential sweep rates indicates the quasi-reversible diffusion-controlled electrochemical behavior of the prepared electrodes.20,35 Above the scan rate of 40 mV s−1, the plots deviate from linearity.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements of the electrodes were conducted at different current densities, and the results are provided in Fig. 4. As seen in Fig. 4(a), the GCD curves of the P-doped NiS–NF show plateaus, which demonstrate the battery-type behavior of the electrode materials through charge and discharge processes.4,11 For more accuracy, the specific capacity (mA h g−1) was calculated (based on eqn (1)) instead of specific capacitance (F g−1)36 (1)in which i (A) is the current,  is the area under the discharge curve, m (g) is the mass, and ΔV (V) is the potential range of the discharge curve.

Moreover, the quasi-symmetric GCD curves imply low polarization, suitable coulombic efficiency, and good reversibility during charge/discharge processes.35 Comparing the GCD curves of the P-doped NiS–NF and NiS–NF at 10 A g−1, the P-doped NiS–NF electrode shows a higher area under the discharge curve, denoting higher capacity, in comparison to the NiS–NFs.37 Accordingly, the introduction of phosphorus as a heteroatom into the NiS–NF boosted the capacitive properties of the electrode. Coulombic and energy efficiencies of the P-doped NiS–NF were calculated, and the results are provided in Fig. 4(c). Considering the obtained results, the positive electrode benefits from remarkable coulombic efficiency through a wide range of current densities. However, due to the quasi-reversible redox reactions at the interface of electrode materials/electrolyte and polarization effect, the energy efficiencies deviate from an ideal electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) behavior.11,38Fig. 4(d) shows the rate capability of the P-doped NiS–NF electrodes. The obtained plot shows that the P-doped NiS–NF is able to retain more than 46.8% of its capacity at 50 A g−1 compared to that at a current density of 6 A g−1.
Life durability of the P-doped NiS–NF electrode was evaluated through 10000 successive GCD cycles. The GCD cycles were performed while the current densities were changed from 6 to 20 A g−1 and then returned to 6 A g−1 with the intervention of 1000 cycles (Fig. 5(a)). The P-doped NiS–NF electrodes exhibited reasonable life stability since they lost 17.1% of their initial capacity after 10000 GCD cycles.

Investigation of the electron-transfer kinetics at the interface of the active materials/electrolyte was carried out via electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS). When the system was under the open circuit potential (OCP) conditions, an alternating 5 mV potential with frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz was applied. Fig. 5(b) shows the Nyquist plot of the P-doped NiS–NF and NiS–NF along with the magnified high-frequency region and the derived equivalent circuit of P-doped NiS–NF. The high-frequency area provides information about the charge-transfer processes, while the low-frequency region gives information about diffusion-limited processes.4,38 The first intercept at the real axis can be the estimated internal resistance Rs, which is the incorporation of the electrode material resistance, electrolyte resistance, and contact resistance between the active materials and current collector.11,38 The P-doped NiS–NFs exhibit lower Rs (1.35 Ω) compared to the NiS–NFs (1.50 Ω). Therefore, the introduction of P into the NiS–NF host enhanced the conductivity and capacitive behavior of the prepared electrodes. Due to the direct synthesis of the active materials on the current collector, the P-doped NiS–NF electrodes benefit from low Rs and trivial Rct (0.616 Ω) as well.4,11,38 In the low-frequency region, the frequency response of the P-doped NiS–NF exhibits a higher slope, indicating a small diffusion resistance in comparison to that of the NiS–NFs.11,38
3.3. A-HA–NF characterization
FE-SEM images of A-HA are provided in Fig. 6. As seen in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the A-HA structures benefit from both sheet-like and snowball-like nanostructures. Moreover, higher magnifications (Fig. 6(c)) show that there are nanoarrays on the surface of the snowball-like nanostructures. The mapping (Fig. 6(d)) and EDS spectrum (Fig. S2†) confirm the presence of O, C, Si, P, S, Ca, Mg, and Fe elements on the surface of the active materials.

The FT-IR spectrum in Fig. 7(a) shows the functional groups in the A-HA structures. The strong peak at 3427 cm−1 can be attributed to the O–H groups.31 The peaks appearing at 2800 and 2750 cm−1 correspond to the C–H vibration modes.4,11,31 Furthermore, the peaks located at 1632 and 697 cm−1 can be attributed to the CC stretching and bending modes.24,39,40 The peaks observed at 512 and 471 cm−1 can be attributed to the M–O, and M–S absorption of the existing metals within the HA matrix.11,20,31

The XRD pattern of the prepared A-HA is provided in Fig. 7(b). As seen in the figure, the observation of several fine and well-defined diffraction peaks provides evidence for the crystalline structure of A-HA. The characteristic peaks of HA-derived carbon appeared at 2θ values of about 26°, 42.5°, 44.6°, 50.8°, 71°, and 77.7°. The observed peaks can be attributed to the (002), (100), (101), (102), (104), and (110) crystal planes of carbon (JCPDS, card no 00-025-0284). As a direct consequence of inorganic residues, which remained in HA throughout the extraction process, several peaks were also observed in the XRD pattern of A-HA. According to the EDS mapping results (Fig. 6(d) and S2†), the complex XRD pattern can be attributed to the existence of Si, Al, and Fe inorganic elements, which were embedded in carbonized HA.41

Fig. 7(c) shows the Raman spectrum of A-HA. The characteristic peaks of the D and G bands of carbonaceous materials obviously appeared at 1318 cm−1 and 1575 cm−1, respectively.11,27,42 The ratio of the ID/IG can give some hints on the crystalline structure of the carbon-based materials and structural defects.43
The specific surface area and pore distribution of A-HA were investigated via N2 adsorption/desorption analysis, and the obtained BET and BJH plots are provided in Fig. 7(d). The observed isotherm can be attributed to type IVa in the IUPAC classifications.4,44 Furthermore, the appearance of hysteresis with an H3 loop shape indicates that A-HA benefits from a mesoporous structure.11,44 In addition, clear evidence is provided by the BJH plot to support the formation of the mesoporous structures.44 The SSA of A-HA was estimated to be 317.118 m2 g−1, which confirms the porous structure of A-HA.
3.4. Electrochemical measurements of the A-HA–NF
The entire electrochemical measurements of the A-HA–NF were conducted in a 3-electrode cell (vs. the Hg/HgO reference electrode), and a solution of KOH (3 M) was used as the electrolyte. Fig. 8(a) shows the CV curves of A-HA–NF at different sweep rates from 1 to 100 mV s−1. The semi-rectangular CV curves correspond to the EDL charge storage mechanism of the A-HA–NF electrodes.35,37,45 In addition, no obvious distortion was observed as the sweep rate was altered from 1 to 100 mV s−1, confirming the stable electrochemical behavior of the fabricated electrode.4,38 Since no visible redox peak appeared in CVs, the EDL mechanism mainly governs the charge storage of the A-HA–NF.36

GCD measurements were carried out at different current densities from 0.1 to 3 A g−1, and the results are provided in Fig. 8(b). The nearly linear charge/discharge curves denote the EDL behavior of the negative electrode's active materials.36 According to the obtained results, GCD curves of the A-HA–NF are in good agreement with CVs, which signifies that the EDL is the dominant charge storage mechanism in A-HA–NF. Coulombic efficiencies of the A-HA–NF were calculated at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 8(c). The obtained data exhibit a stable trend near-ideal amount, demonstrating remarkable reversibility of the A-HA–NFs.11,38 Based on GCD and CV, which show that the A-HA–NFs store charge through the EDL mechanism, the specific capacitance (F g−1) was calculated according to eqn (2) and (3) at different scan rates and current densities (Fig. 8(d))4,20,46 (2)In this equation idV (A.V) is the area under the CV curve, m (g) is the mass, ΔV (V) is the potential range, and ϑ (mV s−1) is the scan rate. (3)where i (A) is current density, Δt (s) is the discharge time, m (g) is the mass, and ΔV (V) is the discharge potential range.
As shown in the figure, the obtained specific capacitances from CV and GCD represent very close values and a similar downward trend. The achieved Csp from CV was 219.6 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1, and a Csp of 163.3 F g−1 was calculated at 0.1 A g−1 from GCD.
The cycle life stability of the negative electrode was investigated via 10000 GCD cycles (Fig. 9(a)). Cycle stability, in turn, was investigated by applying different current densities from 0.1 to 3 A g−1 and returning to 0.1 A g−1. Regarding the results, the A-HA–NF electrode maintained more than 88.7% of its initial Csp, which demonstrates the remarkable cycle stability of the negative electrode.

EIS measurements were conducted under OCP conditions. A 5 mV potential with a frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz was applied to assess the electron-transfer kinetics, and the obtained Nyquist plot is provided in Fig. 9(b). According to the inset of the figure, which is the zoomed-in high-frequency part, the plot intersects the real axis at about 0.656 Ω. Respectively, the A-HA–NF electrode benefits from low Rs and high electrical conductivity.36,38 In addition, the approximate Rct (0.831 Ω) along with the nearly vertical line in the low-frequency part verifies appropriate capacitive performance and low diffusion resistance of the A-HA–NFs.36
3.5. Electrochemical measurements of the P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASC
The ASC device was assembled in a 2-electrode cell in which KOH (3 M) was used as the electrolyte. The mass ratio of the positive and negative electrodes was calculated according to eqn (4):4,11 (4)where, m+ and m− (g) denote the mass of the positive and negative electrodes, Csp− and Csp+ are the specific capacitances of the positive and negative electrodes, and ΔV+ and ΔV− are the potential ranges of the P-doped NiS–NF and A-HA–NF electrodes.
As seen in Fig. 10(a), the CV measurements of the ASC were conducted at potential sweep rates ranging from 1 to 100 mV s−1. Upon increasing the sweep rate, the voltammograms retained their overall form, which demonstrates the stable capacitive performance and high power density of the P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASCs.4,20 The obtained linear Randles–Sevcik plot in Fig. 10(b) indicates that the fabricated ASC device benefits from a diffusion-limited mechanism.4,11 Moreover, the relation between the log–log plot of the scan rate and anodic peak current shows a linear correlation with a slope of about 0.65, signifying that the ASC mainly possesses a battery-type activity rather than a pseudocapacitive behavior (Fig. 10(c)).4,35

In addition to CV, the GCD measurements were carried out as well to evaluate the capacitive behavior of the ASCs. In this regard, during charge/discharge, various current densities were applied to the ASCs (Fig. 10(d)). The appearance of shoulders in GCD curves corresponds to the battery-type performance of the fabricated ASCs in conformity with the CV results.4,35,37 Furthermore, the low IR-drops imply suitable ionic conductivity and promising charge storage performance.20 The rate capability of the ASCs was assessed from the plot of capacities vs. current densities provided in Fig. 10(e). The specific capacity (C g−1) of the ASC was calculated based on eqn (5):4 (5)where, idV (A.V) is the area under the discharge curve, M (g) is the total mass of both positive and negative electrodes, and ΔV (V) is the ASC working potential. Accordingly, as the current density was increased by 28 fold, the ASC showed a 63% reduction in the initial capacity. Due to the importance of the lifetime of the supercapacitors, the life expectancy of the P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASCs was investigated through 10000 continuous charge/discharge cycles. The current density was increased every 1000 cycles from 0.18 to 5 A g−1 and then reduced to 0.2 A g−1. Exhibiting 21.6% loss after 10000 GCD cycles, the P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASCs benefits from reasonable cycle durability.
Energy and power densities of the supercapacitors are of great significance and determine the overall performance level of the devices.47 In this regard, the energy (W h kg−1) and power (kW kg−1) densities of the ASCs were estimated according to eqn (6) and (7)11,20 (6) (7)In the above equations, Csp (C g−1) is the specific capacity of the ASC device, ΔV (V) is the potential window of the device, and Δt (s) is the discharge time. The ASCs benefit from remarkable energy density in a wide potential range (1.6 V) and suitable capacity. Accordingly, the energy and power densities of the P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASCs were calculated at different current densities, and the results are provided in the Ragone plot in comparison to other conventional energy conversion and storage systems (Fig. 11(a) and (b)). The highest energy density was achieved at 0.2 A g−1, which was 36.32 W h kg−1; at this current density, the power density was 199.95 W kg−1. At the current density of 3 A g−1, the energy density was 15.12 W h kg−1, and the power density was calculated to be about 6921 W kg−1. The applicability of the fabricated devices was investigated via powering a digital thermometer (using an alkaline coin cell battery) with a 1.5 V potential window (Fig. 11(c) and (d)).

4. Conclusions
ASCs were assembled employing P-doped NiS–NFs and biomass-derived A-HA–NFs as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The P-doped NiS–NFs were prepared via two simple hydrothermal steps, and biomass-derived HA was activated through an annealing process. Before fabricating the ASC, the electrochemical performance of both positive and negative electrodes was investigated in a 3-electrode cell. The P-doped NiS positive electrode exhibited a superior specific capacity of 486.7 mA h g−1 at 6 A g−1. Upon increasing the current density to 50 A g−1, the P-doped NiS electrodes showed a specific capacity of 228 mA h g−1 (47% capacity retention). Moreover, the life stability of the positive electrode was evaluated through 10000 GCD cycles, and the P-doped NiS–NF electrodes were able to maintain more than 82.9% of the initial capacity. The estimated Rs and Rct of the P-doped NiS–NF were 1.35 and 0.616 Ω, respectively, showing promising electronic conductivity of the prepared positive electrodes. Besides, the biomass-derived A-HA–NFs exhibited a specific capacitance of about 220 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 and 163.3 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Cycle life stability of the negative electrode was investigated through 10000 GCD cycles at different current densities. The biomass-derived A-HA electrodes exhibited 88.7% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. According to the equivalent circuit, the A-HA–NFs showed an appropriate Rs of 0.656 Ω. The capacitive performance of the 2-electrode cell was evaluated as well. The ASCs exhibited a specific capacity of 103.78 C g−1 at 0.18 A g−1 and 35.47 C g−1 at 5 A g−1 (28 fold increase in current density). Besides the suitable capacity, the fabricated ASCs benefit from a wide operation potential window (1.6 V). In addition, the prepared P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASCs exhibited energy and power densities of 36.32 W h kg−1 and 199.95 W kg−1 at 0.2 A g−1. At 3 A g−1, and the energy and current densities of the ASCs were 15.12 W h kg−1 and 6921 W kg−1. The P-doped NiS–NF//A-HA–NF ASCs exhibited 78.4% life durability after 10000 GCD cycles, which indicates the appropriate ASC device stability. The remarkable capacitive performance of the fabricated electrochemical capacitors can be attributed to (1) the fabrication of thin layer nanostructures, enhancing the SSA and specific capacity, shortening the ion-diffusion path, and reducing Rs as well, (2) heteroatom doping into the electroactive material matrix provides more active sites along with reducing Rs and improving the electrical conductivity of the electrodes, (3) direct construction of transition metal composites on current collectors results in appropriate adhesion and mechanical stability of electrode materials and small Rs, which strongly affect the capacitive behavior of electrodes, (4) as a result of using heteroatoms, an appropriate energy density was obtained, and (5) employing the P-doped transition metal sulfides and carbon-based materials simultaneously ensures high energy and power densities of the ASCs. Moreover, using A-HA as a source of carbon materials is a promising strategy for developing environmentally benign and cheap electrodes. With regard to the appropriate energy and power densities, the prepared ASCs can be a suitable choice for application in renewable energy systems.
