    , Accepted 28th November 2018First published on 1st December 2018AbstractTo address the intrinsic issue of conventional porphyrin derivatives with a deficient absorption between Soret and Q bands, we designed and synthesized two porphyrin molecules (BDTP-1 and BDTP-2) bearing a meso-alkyl substituted porphyrin core, benzodithiohene (BDT) ethynylene π-bridge and end-capping ethylrhodanine derivatives. Apart from the characteristic Soret and Q bands of porphyrin macrocycle, an extra peak (521 nm for BDTP-1 and 536 nm for BDTP-2) was derived from the BDT units. Using the porphyrin small molecules as electron donors and PC71BM as an electron acceptor, the devices show broad spectral photocurrent generation with a significant contribution from greenlight-harvesting (490–550 nm), resulting in high performances with PCEs up to 7.97%.
1. Introduction
Organic electron donors have promising advantages such as light weight, large-area processing, mechanical flexibility, and low-cost for an organic solar cell (OSC).1–6 Together with fullerene or non-fullerene electron acceptor,7–9 the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer can be facilely fabricated with solution-processed technologies such as spin-coating or ink-jet printing. To date, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single heterojunction OSCs has exceeded 13%,10–12 which consists of polymers (PBDB-T-SF and PBDB-T-2F) as donors and small molecule acceptors (IT-4F and IT-2Cl) as acceptors. Furthermore, the PCEs for ternary heterojunction OSCs using small molecules such as PTB7-TH as donors along with COi8DFIC and PC71BM as acceptors have surpassed 13–14%.13,14 The design, synthesis and application of new organic materials with unprecedented properties will give impetus to the industrialization of OSCs. Porphyrin (P) is an 18π-electron planar and conjugated cycle that typically absorbs strongly in a range of 400–500 nm, and its electrochemical and photochemical properties can be finely tuned by varying the peripheral substituents and centered metals. With phenylene ethynylene as the π-linkage15 and 3-ethylrhodanine (R) as the electron deficient acceptor (A), we previously designed and synthesized a series of A-π-D-π-A type porphyrin-cored small molecules, and applied them as donors in BHJ OSCs with PCEs around 6.49–8.04%.16–19 It was found that the deficiency of green light absorption for these porphyrin small molecules significantly limited their solar light-harvesting capability in OSCs. Besides, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) conjugated porphyrin small molecules were reported to have panchromatic absorption. Record efficiencies up to 9.06–9.08% were achieved in single heterojunction OSCs.20–27 However, its narrow bandgaps (1.38–1.48 eV) and up-shifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (ca. −5.23 eV) resulted in a lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) (<0.8 eV). Despite the high potential of porphyrin derivatives as donors in OSCs, our previous study highlights the complexity in designing and synthesizing porphyrin small molecules that have a broad absorption spectrum and suitable energy level alignment.
Along this line, we synthesized two acceptor-π-donor-π-acceptor (A-π-D-π-A) structural porphyrin small molecules, BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 (Scheme 1), in which a meso-alkyl substituted porphyrin core was symmetrically conjugated to benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene ethynylene as π-bridges, and end-capped respectively with 3-ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine as electron-withdrawing moieties. The conjugation of benzodithiophene (BDT) would favor electron delocalization and intermolecular π–π stacking due to its planar and extendable conjugated structure, thus leading to efficient charge transport and high fill-factor (FF) values in OSCs.28–30 At the same time, the BDT units could compensate the green light absorption in porphyrin derivatives for enhanced light-harvesting capability.31 Additionally, BDT is a relatively weak electron donor, and the conjugation of BDT could usually lower the HOMO energy level of the resulting molecules,32 thus leading to a high VOC in OSCs. As expected, both porphyrin small molecules exhibited characteristic Soret and Q bands for the porphyrin macrocycle. An extra absorption peak at 521 nm for BDTP-1 and 536 nm for BDTP-2, which were derived from BDT units, was evidenced by the density functional theory (DFT). Their HOMO energy levels were much lower than those of A-π-D-π-A porphyrin molecules with phenylene ethynylene as the π-bridge.16–19 The BHJ OSCs using the two molecules as an electron-donor and PC71BM as an acceptor gave high performances with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 7.92%.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
As depicted in Scheme 1, the BDT-ethynylene moieties (2) were symmetrically conjugated to the porphyrin core (1) at meso-positions through conventional Sonogashira coupling reactions. Target molecules, BDTP-1 and BDTP-2, were prepared via a piperidine-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the dialdehyde intermediate (3) and the respective ethylrhodanine and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethyl-rhodanine. Both molecules consisted of the same porphyrin core and alkoxy-substituted BDT-ethynylene π-bridge, but differed in the end-capping moiety. The details of the synthesis and characterization for all the intermediates and target molecules are provided in ESI.†
2.2. Optical properties and computational calculation
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two molecules in chloroform are shown in Fig. 1a and Table 1. Both molecules showed a similar Soret band at 460 (462) nm. However, the BDTP-2 exhibited a red-shifted Q band (724 nm) in comparison with BDTP-1 (708 nm), indicating a stronger electron charge transfer induced by more electron-withdrawing character from 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine in BDTP-2. Specifically, an additional shoulder peak in the range of green light absorption (490–560 nm) was observed for BDTP-1 at 521 nm and for BDTP-2 at 536 nm, which arose from the conjugated BDT moiety (vide infra). The results were consistent with other porphyrin small molecules carrying thienylenevinylene or terthiophene units that could broaden their absorption in the visible region.19,33–37 Evidently, the conjugation of BDT to the porphyrin core through an ethynylene linker could effectively compensate for the absorption spectrum deficiency between the Soret and Q bands in conventional porphyrin molecules.38,39 In addition, their UV-vis absorptions in thin-films were significantly broadened and red-shifted because of the strong intermolecular π–π stacking (Fig. 1b).

The structural and electronic properties of the BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were simulated using the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/GENECP level using Gaussian.40 The geometries from DFT/B3LYP were demonstrated to be accurate in comparison to the experimental data.41 The spectra calculated by time-dependent (TD)-DFT retained the main characteristics with slightly overestimated wavelengths.19 The optimal molecular geometries from the front view and side view are shown in Fig. 2. Both BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 had a fully planar conformation with negligible dihedral angles (<2 Å) between the adjacent aromatic moieties, indicating negligible effects on molecular geometries from their different end-capping units.

However, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Table 2, BDTP-1 had calculated LUMO/HOMO values of −3.18/−5.02 eV with a band gap of 1.84 eV. BDTP-2 gave deeper LUMO/HOMO values of −3.31/−5.11 eV with a narrower band gap of 1.80 eV (Table 2) due to the stronger electron withdrawing 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine. The simulated data was very consistent with the experimental data.

The computational absorption spectra of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 are plotted in Fig. 1c. The characteristic Soret and Q bands for porphyrin core were observed at 435 and 736 nm for BDTP-1, and 436 and 778 nm for BDTP-2, respectively. In addition, a new peak appeared at 527 nm for BDTP-1 and 537 nm for BDTP-2. The computational absorption spectra were very consistent with their experimental spectra. The main contributions to the first excitations, oscillator strengths and the wavelengths are provided in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, Tables S1, S2 (ESI†). The Soret bands for BDTP-1 (453 nm, 2.74 eV) and BDTP-2 (455 nm, 2.72 eV) mainly arose from HOMO−3 → LUMO+2 transitions with a contribution of 43% for the former and 46% for the later. The Q bands of BDTP-1 (756 nm, 1.64 eV) and BDTP-2 (778 nm, 1.59 eV) were ascribed to the HOMO → LUMO transitions, with contributions of 97% and 97%, respectively. In addition, the greenlight absorption of BDTP-1 (527 nm, 2.35 eV) mainly depended on the HOMO−3 → LUMO transition with a contribution of 67%, while the greenlight absorption of BDTP-2 (537 nm, 2.31 eV) mainly originated from the transition of HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 with a contribution of 56%. At the same time, the orbital compositions involved in the HOMO−3 → LUMO transition for BDTP-1 and the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition for BDTP-2 were analysed by Hirshfeld method using built-in sphericalized atomic densities in free-states with Multiwfn.42 The fragments of BDT showed a contribution of 57% to HOMO−3 and 28% to LUMO in BDTP-1, and 71% to HOMO−1 and 33% to LUMO+1 in BDTP-2. The computational results confirmed that the greenlight absorption of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were mainly derived from the orbital contributions of the BDT unit. In other words, the conjugation of BDT could efficiently correct for the absorption deficiency from conventional porphyrin derivatives.

2.3. Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammetry curves of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 in acetonitrile are plotted in Fig. 1d, and the data is summarized in Table 1. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were estimated to be −5.29/−3.60 eV and −5.33/−3.67 eV, respectively. These values were based on the corresponding onset values of oxidative and reductive potentials of 0.55/−1.14 eV and 0.59/−1.07 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps (Eg) of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were respectively calculated to be 1.69 eV and 1.67 eV following the formula Eg = ELUMO − EHOMO (eV). The deeper HOMO and LUMO and narrower band gap for BDTP-2 compared to BDTP-1 was mainly due to the stronger electron-withdrawing end-capping moiety in the former.43 In addition, the larger Eg values compared to their optical band gaps (1.60 eV and 1.57 eV) can be ascribed to the existence of exciton binding energy.44 With respect to those previously reported porphyrin molecules,39,45 the HOMO of both BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were lowered by the conjugation of BDT to porphyrin core through an ethynylene linker. This finding is beneficial for high VOC when used as electron donor in OSC.
2.4. Photovoltaic performance
BHJ OSCs were fabricated using two molecules as electron donors blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester [PC71BM] as the electron acceptor. The details of the device fabrication are provided in ESI.† A systematical study of the device performances for different ratios of donor/PC71BM, thermal annealing temperatures, and solvent vapour annealing time was performed (Fig. S4, S5 and Table S4, ESI†). The optimal conditions for film processing were fixed to a 1:1.2 ratio of donor/PC71BM, at 100 °C TA for 5 min and SVA with dichloromethane for 20 s.46 For the optimal devices, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in Fig. 4a, and the key parameters are summarized in Table 3. Upon TA, the devices based on the BDTP-1/PC71BM active layer gave an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.79%, and the devices based on the BDTP-2/PC71BM active layer afforded a lower PCE of 5.39%. As expected,46 the photovoltaic performance of the devices was significantly enhanced after performing both TA and SVA processes on the active layers. The BDTP-1/PC71BM devices gave a higher average PCE of 7.92% while BDTP-2/PC71BM devices exhibited a lower average PCE of 7.89% under the same conditions. At the same time, the charge mobilities based on the optimal blend films were measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S3, ESI†). The BDTP-1/PC71BM exhibited hole/electron mobilities of 3.91 × 10−4/4.43 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1, which were higher than the hole/electron mobilities of 2.96 × 10−4/3.15 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 V−1 for BDTP-2/PC71BM. The result is consistent with the beter performance of the device based on BDTP-1/PCBM.

The benefit of the BDT conjugation was revealed in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the above optimal devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, those optimal devices showed a wide range of photocurrent generation from 300 to 800 nm, contributed by the greenlight absorption (490–560 nm). The optimal BDTP-1/PC71BM devices exhibited an EQE of 77.2% at 380 nm, 75.3% at 530 nm and 52.7% at 740 nm, while the BDTP-2/PC71BM devices showed a lower EQE of 51.3% at 340 nm, 73.5% at 470 nm and 64.3% at 730 nm.
2.5. Morphological investigation
The morphologies of the active layers were studied by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the root-means-square roughness (RMS) values from the thermally annealed BDTP-1/PC71BM and BDTP-2/PC71BM active layers were 0.6 nm and 0.7 nm, respectively. Upon subsequent SVA for 20 s, the BDTP-1/PC71BM and BDTP-2/PC71BM gave substantially high RMS of 0.9 nm and 1.0 nm, respectively. The large RMS values after the SVA process indicated a higher degree of crystallinities for both molecules in these active layers.
Then, the microstructures of the pristine BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 and their blend films with PC71BM were further examined using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The resulting 2D-GIWAXS patterns along with the in-plane and out-of-plane X-ray scattering profiles extracted from the 2D GIWAXD images are shown in Fig. 5 and the data is summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The pristine BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were predominant “edge-on” orientations, which showed lamellar-stacking peaks (100, 200, 300) within 11 nm−1 in the out-of-plane direction and a π-stacking diffraction peak (010) at ∼17 nm−1 in the plane direction. A bright ring could also be observed in the large q value (>20 nm−1) due to some large grains. The results confirmed the well-ordered crystal structures of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 in pristine films. The blend-films showed a random infraction peak at ∼14 nm−1 arising from PC71BM molecules and a disappearance of (300) diffraction, indicating that the high crystal structures of BDTP-1 and BDTP-2 were disturbed by the addition of PC71BM. Accordingly, the TA BDTP-1/PC71BM and TA BDTP-2/PC71BM showed relatively small coherence lengths of 8.59 nm and 6.35 nm, respectively, according to their (100) diffractions. With consequent TA and SVA processing, their coherence lengths could be improved to 9.13 nm and 10.07 nm, respectively, indicating the recovery of their high crystallinities after the SVA process. The results were consistent with the observation from AFM characterizations.

3. Conclusions
The symmetrical conjugation of ethylrhodanine-BDT-ethynylene to the porphyrin core allowed for the preparation of two new A-π-D-π-A structural porphyrin small molecules. The conjugation of BDT could not only compensate for the absorption deficiency of the conventional porphyrin derivatives, but also maintained appropriate wide bandgaps with deep HOMO energy levels. The devices using the porphyrin small molecules as electron donors and PC71BM as an electron acceptor showed a broad photoelectron generation with significant contribution from greenlight-harvesting (490–560 nm), leading to high photovoltaic performances with PCEs up to 7.97%. Although the efficiency cannot compete with the recently reported PCE record of 14%, the conceptual molecular design strategy should be helpful in addressing intrinsic absorption issues of porphyrin derivatives and fully unravelling their potential in highly efficient BHJ OSCs.
