    , Accepted 28th May 2008First published on 1st July 2008AbstractWe have successfully constructed fullerene-encapsulated porphyrin hexagonal nanorods in DMF–acetonitrile solution mixed with CTAB surfactant, which demonstrate efficient and characteristic photoinduced electron transfer and light energy conversion properties.
Construction of functional molecular assemblies with well-defined shapes and structures is of great interest because of a variety of applications such as optoelectronics.1 Porphyrins are major and promising building blocks for such organized nanoscale superstructures,2 which perform many of the essential light-harvesting and photoinduced electron/energy transfer reactions.3,4 Unidirectionally bar-shaped nanostructures of porphyrins (i.e.porphyrin nanorods and nanotubes) also have potential for fabrication of nanoscale materials, electronics and photonics because of the characteristic anisotropic structures.5 However, little attention has been given to the utilization of such structures in electronic and optical applications.5b
Fullerenes incidentally hold great promise as spherical electron acceptors on account of their small reorganization energy in electron transfer reactions.4,6 Combination of porphyrins and fullerenes seems ideal for achieving an enhanced light-harvesting efficiency of chromophores throughout the solar spectrum and a highly efficient conversion of the harvested light into the high energy state of the charge separation by photoinduced electron transfer (PET).4,6
Here we report a new type of molecular composites: fullerene-encapsulated porphyrin hexagonal nanorods composed of zinc meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin [ZnP(Py)4] and C60 [denoted as C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod], which are prepared with the aid of a surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in a DMF–acetonitrile mixed solvent (Fig. 1). The highly organized C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods demonstrate not only a broad absorption derived from the supramolecular aggregates, but also significant enhancement of solar energy conversion based on photoinduced charge separation (CS) yielding the radical ion pair [C60˙−–ZnP(Py)4˙+].
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of organization process of C60 and ZnP(Py)4 using CTAB in this study. CTAB is omitted for clarity. The electron micrographs show the time-dependent formation: (A) 1 min, (B) 3 min and (C) 6 min after injection. 

        ZnP(Py)4 (Aldrich) was purified by recrystallization before use. C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods were prepared as follows (Fig. 1).
A mixture of the appropriate ratio of ZnP(Py)4 and C60 in DMF solution (1. Basic monomers) was injected into 7.5 times volume of continuously stirred 0.20 mM CTAB acetonitrile solution at room temperature. The final concentrations of ZnP(Py)4 and C60 are 0.03 and 0.02 mM in DMF–acetonitrile (2/15, v/v), respectively. On injection, they largely form ZnP(Py)4 flake assemblies and C60-based nanoparticles (ca. 5–20 nm in diameter), separately (2. Building Blocks and Fig. 1A).7 With the diffusion of DMF into acetonitrile, the Zn–N axial coordination of pyridyl N-atoms to zinc atoms of ZnP(Py)4 promotes the growth of aggregates, which continue to grow into a flake structure.5c In this case, the organization process of ZnP(Py)4 moieties is derived from a coordination bond in contrast with C60assemblies based on relatively weak π–π interactions. Therefore, once the components are injected, two different types of assemblies are quickly observed. Fig. 1B shows the build-up of ZnP(Py)4 and C60 after 3 min (3. Built-Up Process).7 Then, after several minutes, C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods are finally formed (Fig. 1C). The reference ZnP(Py)4 hexagonal nanotube without C60 was also prepared in the same manner for comparison [denoted as ZnP(Py)4 nanotube]. It should be noted that the prepared samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm to remove CTAB by DMF–acetonitrile solvent repeatedly and filtrated to separate unbound ZnP(Py)4 and C60. The self-assembled structures can be maintained for many hours. ZnP(Py)4 nanotube shows a bar-like structure with a large hollow hole [see ESI: Fig. S1A†],5c whereas the hole is completely closed in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods (Fig. 1C). SEM analysis showed that C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods are 4.12 ± 0.94 μm in length and 490 ± 90 nm in outside diameter (Fig. S2†),8 as compared to ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes analyzed as 2.13 ± 0.27 μm in length and 540 ± 30 nm in outside diameter (Fig. S2†). The large increase in length from 2.13 to 4.12 μm relative to unchanged diameters (∼500 nm) indicates that anisotropic crystal growth largely occurs toward the length direction due to π–π interaction of encapsulated C60 moieties within the ZnP(Py)4 assembly.9–11
To examine electronic interaction in nanorod structures, we have measured steady-state absorption spectra of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod in DMF–acetonitrile (2/15, v/v) (Fig. 2). In the measurement of absorption spectra, we employed an integrating sphere to avoid a scattering effect on the apparent absorption. The absorption spectrum of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod exhibits much broader and more intense absorption in the visible and near infrared regions than those of the corresponding monomers: ZnP(Py)4 or C60 in DMF (spectrab and c). Additionally, the absorption spectrum of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod also becomes broader than that of ZnP(Py)4 nanotube because of aggregated interactions of C60assemblies or C60-ZnP(Py)4 interfaces (Fig. S4†). A quite broad absorption in the visible region is useful for solar energy conversion.
 Fig. 2  Steady-state absorption spectra of (a) C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods in DMF–acetonitrile (2/15, v/v), (b) 1.3 μM ZnP(Py)4 monomer in DMF, (c) 5 μM C60 monomer in DMF and (d) OTE/C60-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod film using an integrating sphere. 
The singlet excited-state quenching of ZnP(Py)4 by encapsulated C60 in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods was investigated to obtain the overall fluorescence intensity quenching behavior with respect to the reference ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes (Fig. 3). In steady-state fluorescence measurements, the fluorescence intensity of the porphyrin in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod (spectruma) is suppressed compared to that of the ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes (spectrumb). This quenching is largely because of efficient PET from 1ZnP(Py)4* to C60 in nanorods.4 Furthermore, additional quantitative electronic interplay on the photoexcited C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods could be evaluated by time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The insert of Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence decay profiles of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods, ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes and ZnP(Py)4 monomer, respectively. The fluorescence emission decay of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods (trace a) was found to proceed faster than that observed for the ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes (trace b) and monomer (trace c). By the biexponential fitting of the fluorescence decay of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods, the fluorescence lifetimes (τf) were evaluated to be 180 ps (85%) and 1100 ps (15%), which are considerably shorter than those of ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes [390 ps (65%) and 1870 ps (35%)] and ZnP(Py)4 monomer [2200 ps (100%)]. It is reasonable to assume that a photoinduced CS state [i.e.ZnP(Py)4˙+ and C60˙−] occurs in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods. By comparing the τf of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod with that of reference ZnP(Py)4 nanotube, the CS rate constant (kCS) in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods was calculated to be 3.0 × 109 s−1 (see: Fig. S5†).

Additional support for the above hypothesis comes from complementary transient absorption spectroscopy measurements performed after laser irradiation of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods at 532 nm (Fig. 4). The characteristic features of the triplet–triplet absorption of ZnP(Py)4 are missing in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods, thus suggesting the efficient quenching of the singlet excited state by the C60 moiety, which is in sharp contrast with PET via3ZnP(Py)4* in a reference non-organized system: (C60+ZnP(Py)4)n (Fig. S5–7†).8,12 Interestingly, the transient spectra of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods revealed transient bands corresponding to both C60˙− at 1080 nm and ZnP˙+ at 680 nm.6b Thus, considering all the above observations, it is reasonable to assume that the decay rates of the transient absorption bands can be attributed to charge recombination (CR), which occurs after the formation of a CS state in C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods. From the decay time profiles of these transient bands, the rate constants of the CR process are calculated to be 1.04 × 107 s−1 which corresponds to 100 ns for ZnP(Py)4˙+ and C60˙−.13 The difference in PET pathways (i.e., via excited singlet or triplet state)12 may have a great effect on light energy conversion properties (vide infra).

To evaluate the solar energy conversion properties of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods, we constructed a photoelectrochemical cell composed of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod-modified SnO2 optically transparent electrode (OTE) [denoted as OTE/C60-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod] by electrophoretic deposition (Fig. 5A).4
 Fig. 5  (A) Illustration of the photoelectrochemical solar cell. The insert shows photocurrent generation responses under white light illumination (AM 1.5). Input power: 82 mW cm−2. The bar is 0.3 mA cm−2. (B) Photocurrent action spectra of (a) OTE/C60-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod, (b) OTE/ZnP(Py)4-nanotube, (c) OTE/C60-assembly, (d) sum of spectrab and c, and (e) OTE/(ZnP(Py)4+C60)n. Electrolyte: 0.5 mol dm−3LiI and 0.01 mol dm−3 I2 in acetonitrile. 

Fig. 2d shows an absorption spectrum of OTE/C60-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod on an OTE film after deposition, which largely agrees with that in solution. The photocurrent response recorded following the excitation of OTE electrodes is shown in an insert of Fig. 5A. The photocurrent response is prompt, steady and reproducible during repeated on–off cycles of the visible light illumination. Fig. 5B shows photocurrent action spectra of these composite films. The incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE)4spectrum of C60-ZnP(Py)4 film (spectruma) shows a broad photoresponse in the visible region (maximum IPCE: ∼20% at 460 nm), which parallels the corresponding absorption (spectrumd in Fig. 2). In particular, the maximum IPCE value of OTE/C60-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod (∼20%: spectruma) is much larger than the sum of two individual IPCE values (spectrumd: ∼6.5%) of OTE/ZnP(Py)4-nanotube (spectrumb) and OTE/C60-assembly (spectrumc) under the same conditions. Additionally, the maximum value of OTE/C60-ZnP(Py)4-nanorod (∼20%) is much larger than that of a non-organized system: OTE/(ZnP(Py)4+C60)n (spectrume: ∼8%).8 These results clearly indicate that an organized structure between C60 and ZnP(Py)4 as well as the excellent electron acceptor property of C60 has a great effect on the light energy conversion property. Such control of an ultrafast PET pathway via1ZnP(Py)4* in a nanorod assembly largely contributes to the improvement of IPCE because of the occurrence of strong fluorescence quenching in a ZnP(Py)4 only assembly (average quenching quantum yield: ∼0.8 in Fig. S5†). Photocurrent generation in the present system may be initiated by photoinduced CS from 1ZnP(Py)4* (1ZnP*/ZnP˙+ = −1.0 V vs.NHE)4 to C60 (C60/C60˙− = −0.2 V vs.NHE)4 in ZnP(Py)4-C60 rather than direct electron injection to a conduction band of SnO2 (0 V vs.NHE).4 The reduced C60 injects electrons into the SnO2 nanocrystallites, whereas the oxidized porphyrin (ZnP/ZnP˙+ = 1.0 V vs.NHE)4 undergoes the ET reduction with the iodide ion (I3−/I− = 0.5 V vs.NHE).4
In summary, we have successfully constructed new fullerene-encapsulated porphyrin hexagonal nanorods prepared in DMF–acetonitrile. These organized assemblies demonstrate controlled PET and efficient solar energy conversion properties. Such systems could pave the way for the development of photoenergy conversion systems.

We cannot exclude the possibility of composite molecular aggregation between ZnP(Py)4 and C60 in Fig. 1A and B due to the strong interaction of porphyrins and C60 (see: ref. 2a). However, definite discrimination is hard since these steps proceed continuously in solution.
In the case of preparation of ZnP(Py)4 and C60 composite assemblies prepared without CTAB [denoted as (ZnP(Py)4+C60)n], non-uniform rectangular structures are observed. See: Fig. S1B and C†.
We have also measured XRD patterns of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorods and ZnP(Py)4 nanotubes to examine the internal structures (Fig. S3†). The pattern of C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod (pattern a) is approximately the same as that of ZnP(Py)4 nanotube (pattern b). This suggests that ZnP(Py)4 assemblies in the nanorods have quite similar structures to ZnP(Py)4 nanotube, and C60 moieties are encapsulated within the ZnP(Py)4 assemblies as shown in Fig. 1.
The crystal structure of ZnP(Py)4 was previously reported. Considering the unit cell structure, the growth direction of the rod-assembly is c axis. See: Fig. S3†, ref. 5c and   H. Krupitsky, Z. Stein, I. Goldberg and C. E. Strouse, J. Inclusion Phenom. Mol. Recognit. Chem., 1994, 18, 177 Search PubMed   and   L. Kuan-Jiuh, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 1999, 38, 2730 Search PubMed .
The final molar ratio between ZnP(Py)4 and C60 was determined to be 3 : 1 by absorption measurement.
In contrast with C60-ZnP(Py)4nanorod, PET via3ZnP(Py)4* occurs in (ZnP(Py)4+C60)n. See: Fig. S5–7†.
In the inset of Fig. 4, the minor and long lifetime species may be attributable to a migration process of C60˙− in the encapsulated C60assembly.
