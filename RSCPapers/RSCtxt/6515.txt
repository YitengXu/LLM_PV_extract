    , Accepted 15th February 2017First published on 16th February 2017AbstractDiffusion impediments in redox shuttles are a major limitation to realizing high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) using cobalt complexes. Mass transport limitations are strongly dependent on the pore size and the porosity of mesoporous TiO2 films. Herein, we examine the major factors responsible for mass transport limitations and identify ways to minimize them, achieving highly efficient cobalt based DSCs. Depending on the electrolyte and dye used, the pore size and the porosity of the TiO2 films must be modulated to facilitate diffusion of cobalt complexes through pores. The influence of porosity, pore size and viscosity of the electrolyte used on the performance of DSCs with different maximum obtainable JSCs are studied in detail. These effects were studied using two dye solutions, Y123 (0.2 mM) and a cocktail solution of SM342/Y123 (0.2 mM each, 7:1). The JSC is affected primarily by lowered pore sizes as a result of the TiCl4 post-treatment. Transient photocurrent decay measurements were performed on devices featuring photoanodes fabricated with differing porosities and pore sizes. This study indicates that in cells featuring only Y123, recombination rates decreased with decreasing porosity of TiO2 films (i.e. higher TiCl4 concentrations used in their post-treatment). Conversely, in DSCs fabricated with the SM342/Y123 dye cocktail, an intermediate TiCl4 post-treatment concentration (20 mM) afforded the lowest recombination rate, resulting in the preservation of a high open-circuit potential (VOC). It was found that this intermediate concentration regime is optimal in order to achieve an efficiency of over 12.7% at full sun intensity with the SM342/Y123 dye cocktail. Finally, it was concluded that the porosity and pore size must be modulated for different dyes and electrolytes to minimize diffusion limitations of the redox species.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have gained considerable interest due to the low cost materials and methods required for their fabrication. The finished electrodes can be semi-transparent and coloured to attain a desired aesthetic effect and the technology can be adapted to the use of flexible substrates.1 In the conventional DSCs, after photooxidation of the dye by electron injection into the conduction band of the mesoporous TiO2, an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox mediator is used to regenerate the dye.2–4 The major advantage of the I−/I3− redox couple is a slow recombination event between the electrons at the TiO2 surface and the redox mediator ascertaining a nearly quantitative collection of photogenerated charge carriers. However, the mismatch of the I−/I3− Nernst potential of the I−/I3− redox couple with that of the sensitizer produces a large loss in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of conventional DSCs which rarely exceeds half of the optical bandgap energy under AM1.5G standard sunlight. The use of alternative mediators exhibiting higher redox potential such as ferrocene,5 organic redox couples,6,7 copper8,9 and cobalt complexes10–14 enables an increase in the open-circuit potential of the DSCs, raising their overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).10–14 In addition, these couples provide other practical advantages compared to the I−/I3− redox couple, such as noncorrosive behaviour toward the metallic current collectors employed in large scale DSCs. However, these new redox couples have some drawbacks, such as faster recombination with the TiO2 conduction band electrons and slow diffusion through the mesoporous TiO2 network to the counter electrode as a result of their larger size and heavier mass in comparison to the I−/I3− redox couple.15,16 These limitations have a detrimental effect on the maximum possible photocurrent density in full sunlight, which correspondingly affects the overall cell performance.17–19 One way to retard the recombination of conduction band electrons with the oxidised redox species at the TiO2 surface consists in attaching a long alkyl chain to a sensitizer increasing its steric bulkiness, thereby inhibiting the redox mediator to access the TiO2 surface. However, these larger-sized dye molecules may aggregate, causing clogging of pores within the mesoporous structure of the sensitized TiO2 electrode which in turn limits the ability of the redox mediator to access the oxidized dye, causing diffusion limitation of the photocurrent and thus having a detrimental effect on the overall cell performance.
A few years ago, we reported a high-efficiency dye sensitized solar cell employing a Co(bpy)32/3+ based redox mediator along with a mixture of two sensitizers: a metalloporphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8) and an organic dye (Y123);20 while the PCE was 12.3% under full sunlight, it reached 13% upon lowering the light intensity by a factor of 2. In our other work, DSCs employing a porphyrin based sensitizer showed an average PCE of 12.75% under full sunlight, while at 64% sun intensity an average PCE of 13.25% was achieved.21 The origin of this sublinear response of JSC with light intensity is a diffusion restriction of the redox mediator. These mass transport limitations augment with increasing light intensity as a higher JSC requires enhanced mass transport in the electrolyte.22,23
To overcome these limitations, mesoporous TiO2 films with a larger pore size (32 nm) were employed in our previous study.20 However, for films of this type the PCE was found to be greatly affected by the TiCl4 post-treatment,24 traditionally applied to improve the PCE of DSCs. However, post-treatment results in a decrease of both the pore size and overall porosity of the TiO2 film.25–29 Moreover, TiCl4 post-treatment also induces morphological changes of the mesoporous oxide.27,28 Here, we investigate the effect of this post-treatment of the mesoporous TiO2 films on the PCE of the high-efficiency cobalt-based DSCs for TiCl4 concentrations in the 13–40 mM range. Devices without TiCl4 post-treatment perform poorly and were not investigated in this work.30 This study aims to minimize mass transport phenomena during photovoltaic operation by emphasizing the importance of photoanode optimization (preserving the nature of the graphene counter electrodes throughout the study). The influence of the TiCl4 post-treatment on the dynamics of charge recombination and transport as well as the conduction band edge position of TiO2 will also be analysed for the Co(bpy)32/3+ based redox electrolytes.
2. Results and discussion
We employed two different dyes, the previously reported Y12315 alongside SM342, an analogue of the previously reported YD2-o-C820 featuring longer alkoxy chains (C12 in SM342 and C8 in YD2-o-C8) on the porphyrin core. The structures and absorption spectra are shown in the Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. Commercially available TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NR-T) was used as the reference. The starting electrolyte contained 0.25 M [Co(bpy)3](TFSI)2 and 0.06 M [Co(bpy)3](TFSI)3 together with 0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.25 or 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile.

The initial experiments were carried out with the Y123 dye alone to simplify the elucidation of the factors responsible for the mass transport limitations. Mass transport limitations strongly depend on the porosity and the pore size of the TiO2 films used. The TiCl4 post-treatment, which is carried out to enhance the power conversion efficiencies, results in an increased particle size and a decreased surface area, pore size and porosity of the mesoporous TiO2 films.22,23 Post-treatment with different concentrations of TiCl4 (13–40mM) was carried out on the mesoporous films. BET measurements were performed on TiO2 films prepared using commercial 18NR-T paste, utilizing different concentrations of TiCl4 in the post-treatment step. Table S1 (ESI†) shows the BET data of the films prepared using different concentrations of the TiCl4 post-treatment. It is clear from the BET data that the surface area decreased from 88 m2 g−1 to 72 m2 g−1, the porosity of the films decreased from 65% to 55% and the pore size decreased from 22 nm to 17 nm after 40 mM TiCl4 post-treatment. Also employing a post-treatment with 40 mM TiCl4 showed an increase in the particle size from 17.7 nm to 21.6 nm.
2.1. Photovoltaic performance
Photovoltaic characterization of the complete cells was performed using the dye Y123 and the photoanodes prepared by varying the concentration of TiCl4 in TiCl4 aqueous post-treatment solution. Fig. 2 and Table S2 (ESI†) present the J–V data obtained with the complete cells made using the Y123 sensitizer and different concentrations of the TiCl4 post-treatment of the mesoporous TiO2 films. Fig. 3a and b show the photovoltaic performance with the Y123 dye using the photoanodes treated with different concentrations of TiCl4 during post-treatment at 10% and full sun intensity, respectively. From Fig. 3a, it is clear that regardless of the concentration of TiCl4 used in the post-treatment step, the photocurrent densities obtained at 10% sun intensity are comparable. However, in the full sun intensity case, the JSC obtained when using 40 mM TiCl4 post-treated photoanodes is much lower than the other three cases, employing lower concentrations. This limitation in the JSC is surmised to be a result of the mass transport limitations.

Reducing the concentration of TiCl4 in the post-treatment step from 40 mM to 27 mM resulted in an increase of the JSC, and thus the removal of the diffusion limitation. Moreover, reducing the concentration of TiCl4 from 40 mM to 27 mM had a minor impact on the particle size (21.6 nm to 21.3 nm) and the surface area (72 to 73 m2 g−1). However, the porosity and the pore size increased drastically from 55% to 59% and 17 nm to 20 nm, respectively. To explore this further, the current dynamics (Fig. S2 of ESI†) were measured by switching ON and OFF the light at different intensities. The photoanodes post-treated with 40 mM TiCl4 exhibited a spike in current upon turning ON the illumination at full sun intensity, reducing to a lower value as a result of the diffusion limitation of the redox species. Apart from 40 mM, in all the other cases, the JSC is found to be linear with the increasing light intensity. The porosity and pore size changes obtained by varying the concentration of TiCl4 were sufficient enough to eliminate the diffusion limitation.
Interestingly, it is not only the JSC that is affected by the TiCl4 treatment, but the VOC also experiences perturbations. The VOC is higher in the case of 40 mM TiCl4 treated films compared to that of the other concentrations regardless of the sunlight intensity. Thus, as the concentration of TiCl4 is lowered the VOC is lowered too. Since the JSC at low sun intensities is comparable at the different concentrations of the post-treatment and the VOC is higher at higher concentrations of the TiCl4 the overall power conversion efficiency at low sun intensities is higher at higher concentrations of TiCl4. Efficiencies of over 10% were obtained using the mesoporous TiO2 films post-treated with 40 mM TiCl4. But at full sun intensity, higher efficiencies were obtained at 27 mM due to the limitations arising from the diffusion of the redox species.
Transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay measurements were performed to determine the cause of the decreased VOC when a lower TiCl4 concentration was used in the post-treatment step, as this observation is contrary to that observed previously in the case of the I−/I3− redox couple22 and will be discussed in detail in the following sections. Thus, it is clear that by controlling the porosity and the pore size through optimization of the TiCl4 concentration during post-treatment, the diffusion limitations can be avoided in the case of the Y123 sensitizer. A minimum pore size of 20 nm and a porosity of 58% were found to be necessary when the photoanode was sensitized with Y123, which could generate a maximum JSC of 15 mA cm−2.
Generally, substituted pyridine derivatives are added to the electrolyte to reduce the back electron transfer process and to increase VOC; however these pyridine derivatives have higher viscosity compared to that of the pure acetonitrile. Viscosity measurements were carried out using pure acetonitrile and acetonitrile with different concentrations of the pyridine derivative. The viscosity of pure acetonitrile was found to be 0.4 mPa at 25 °C, while for the 0.25 and 0.5 M acetonitrile solutions of the pyridine derivative the viscosities were 0.7 and 1.5 mPa at 25 °C, respectively. Therefore, the question arises – what porosity and pore size are required when the viscosity of the electrolyte increases? Are 58% porosity and 20 nm pore size sufficient to avoid the mass transport limitations with a more viscous electrolyte? To elucidate the effect of the viscosity on the mass transport limitations, the composition of the electrolyte was modified by increasing the concentration of the pyridine derivative. The electrolyte composition was changed by introducing 0.25 M to 0.5 M 4-(5-nonyl)-pyridine in place of 4-(tert-butyl)-pyridine, leaving the concentrations of the remaining components unmodified. Fig. S3 of the ESI† shows the photovoltaic data obtained with cells made using different concentrations of TiCl4 in the post-treatment with 0.5 M 4-(5-nonyl)-pyridine additive.
In the case of this electrolyte, possessing higher viscosity, the maximum JSC is obtained using films post-treated with 13 mM TiCl4. In all the cases, the mass transport limitations were observed. With the 40 mM TiCl4 post-treated films, diffusion limitations of the redox mediator are already evident upon illumination of the cell with 50% sun intensity. Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI†) show the photovoltaic data obtained with the different concentrations of the TiCl4 post-treatment. The current dynamics, measured by switching ON and OFF the light at different intensities (Fig. 5) clearly shows that the diffusion limitations are observed even in the case of 13 mM post-treated TiO2 films due to the increased viscosity of the electrolyte. Except in the case of 40 mM post-treated samples, the diffusion of the redox species is only limited at full sun intensity.

Since the mass transport limitations are not completely eliminated even at the lowest TiCl4 (13 mM) concentration used, the spacing between the photoanode and counter electrode was shrunk to reduce the amount of the bulk electrolyte present. This can be done by changing the thickness of the spacer used for sealing the photoanode and counter electrode from 25 μm to 15 μm. With the change in the thickness of the spacer, the amount of the electrolyte present in between the photoanode and the counter electrode is reduced, which resulted in avoiding the diffusion limitations in the case of viscous electrolytes. Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the J–V curves obtained with the films post-treated with 20 mM TiCl4 and those fabricated with 25 μm and 15 μm thick spacers. Thus, the viscosity of the electrolyte is also one of the major factors responsible for the mass transport limitations. The VOC followed a similar trend as observed in the case of the electrolyte with 0.25 M pyridine derivative. As a result, in a DSC with a viscous electrolyte containing 0.5 M 4-(5-nonyl)-pyridine, using a 15 μm thick spacer yielded efficiencies over 10.05% in the case of the 20 mM TiCl4 post-treated samples (Table 1).

The maximum possible JSC that could be obtained for the dye Y123 is around 15 mA cm−2 due to the lack of absorption in the far visible region. For sustaining a JSC of 15 mA cm−2, the porosity change obtained with the TiCl4 treatment proved to be sufficient. However, at higher photocurrent densities optimized porosity may not be sufficient for higher flux of redox components. To further explore the limitation of the newly optimized parameters of porosity and pore size for the highest possible JSC, we have chosen the mixture of the porphyrin dye SM342 and the organic dye Y123 to sensitize a photoanode. We have previously shown that DSCs co-sensitized with a combination of high efficiency porphyrins and organic dyes possessing complementary absorption spectra can lead to PCEs of 12.3% at full sun intensity.16

Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves obtained with the cocktail dye solution of 0.2 mM SM342/Y123 (7:1) using the Co(bpy)32/3+ redox shuttle. In these studies, the electrolyte contained 0.5 M 4-(5-nonyl)-pyridine and a 15 μm spacer was used to minimize the electrolyte volume within the DSC. In a similar fashion to the results obtained with the dye Y123 alone, the concentration of TiCl4 in the post-treatment exerts a great influence on the obtained JSC in the finished cell. In particular, regardless of the concentration of TiCl4 used in the post-treatment, at low sun intensities all cells resulted in similar JSCs. However, at full sun light levels, the JSCs were affected and found to be non-linear with respect to the sun intensity. So, it is not only the bulk electrolyte that reduces the diffusion of the redox species but also the nature of the dye. The long alkoxy-chains attached to the dye to avoid the recombination retard diffusion of the redox species through the mesoporous TiO2 network. Fig. 8 and Table S4 (ESI†) show the photovoltaic data obtained with the different concentrations of TiCl4 using a mixture of SM342 and Y123 dyes in a ratio of 7:1. As opposed to the case of DSCs sensitized exclusively with Y123, no particular trend was observed with the VOC upon changing the TiCl4 concentration in the post-treatment step during photoanode preparation.

In this case, where the dye cocktail is used for sensitization, the JSC obtained at 10% sun intensity is 1.69 mA cm−2, but at full sun intensity only a maximum of 16.7 mA cm−2 could be obtained when 13 mM TiCl4 post-treated films were used, with the other TiCl4 concentrations providing lower JSC (Fig. 8). The measurement of the photocurrent action spectrum (incident photon-to-power conversion efficiency, IPCE) consolidated this observation, as the integrated photocurrent from the IPCE spectrum obtained matched satisfactorily with the JSC calculated from the J–V curve. A maximum IPCE of 85% was obtained in this case.
In order to determine whether the reduction of IPCE compared to that obtained previously16 is caused by the lower regeneration due to the limited availability of the redox species at the pores, the TiO2 paste was modified to increase the pore size and porosity. This was achieved by increasing the content of the ethyl cellulose polymer in the commercially available Dyesol 18NR-T paste by 10% (w/w). After the modification of the TiO2 paste, the porosity (observed from the BET nitrogen adsorption isotherms) of the corresponding mesoporous film increased from 65% to 69% and the pore size increased from 22 nm to 28.5 nm.
The effect of increasing the porosity and pore size of photoanodes fabricated with the modified 18NR-T TiO2 paste was investigated by measuring the photovoltaic performance of cells after post-treatment of the TiO2 films with solutions of different TiCl4 concentrations. This optimization step is crucial for determining the minimum porosity and the pore size required to maximize the performance when using the cocktail solution of dyes SM342 and Y123. The increase in porosity and pore size as a result of the modification of the commercially available 18NR-T TiO2 paste has been clearly demonstrated to have a strong influence on the JSC obtained at both full sun and lower sun intensities (Fig. 9 and Table S5, ESI†).
 Fig. 9  The short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit potential (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSCs under full solar irradiation (left) and at 10% solar intensity (right) prepared using different concentrations of TiCl4 during post-treatment of photoanodes fabricated with the modified 18NR-T TiO2 paste, sensitized with a 0.2 mM SM342/Y123 cocktail dye solution (7:1) and an electrolyte containing 0.5 M 4-(5-nonyl)-pyridine. 
The JSC obtained at 10% sun intensity was 1.77 mA cm−2 when the higher porosity/pore-size photoanode was post-treated with a 20 mM TiCl4 solution. Interestingly, upon increasing the concentration of TiCl4 to 40 mM in the post-treatment step, the JSC reduced from 1.77 mA cm−2 to 1.68 mA cm−2. The difference in the JSC upon post-treatment with higher concentrations of TiCl4 indicates that a reduction in porosity and the pore size of the TiO2 film reduces the charge collection efficiency compared to substrates possessing greater porosity and pore sizes as a result of the inability of the electrolyte to maintain the necessary redox environment within the mesoporous structure. Fig. 10 shows the J–V curves obtained for the TiO2 electrodes modified with a mixture of SM342 and Y123 dyes at 10% sun and full sun intensities using the Co(bpy)32/3+ redox couple.

It is not only the JSC that was reduced with the higher TiCl4 concentrations, but also the VOC was lowered by 100 mV (Fig. 10a). The same trend is observed at full sun intensity as well (Fig. 10b). Since both the JSC and VOC increased upon lowering the TiCl4 concentration to 20 mM, the highest efficiency was obtained with the 20 mM post-treated TiO2 films. The trend in the VOC was identical to that of films made from 18NR-T and modified 18NR-T pastes.
Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the photocurrent dynamics measured by switching the light ON and OFF at different sun intensities for the devices made using the mesoporous films with 18NR-T at different concentrations of TiCl4. The mass transport limitations were observed in all the cases, with an increase in limitations as the concentration of the TiCl4 post-treatment increases. In the case of the films prepared with the modified 18NR-T paste, at full sun intensity, the difference in the JSC was 1.7 mA cm−2. Mass transport limitations were only observed in the case of the films treated with 40 mM and 27 mM TiCl4. Fig. S5 of the ESI† clearly shows that the mass transport limitations can be minimized after modification of the TiO2 paste and reducing the concentration of the post-treatment to 20 mM. This shows that it is crucial to find the right porosity and pore size required for each dye system. Thus, a record efficiency of 12.76% was obtained at full sun intensity using the 20 mM post-treated TiO2 films.
It is not only the JSC that was reduced with increasing concentration of the TiCl4 post treatment but also the VOC was reduced drastically from the 951 mV to 843 mV when the concentration of TiCl4 was increased from 20 mM to 40 mM. To elucidate this effect, transient photocurrent decay measurements were carried out and are discussed in the following sections.
2.2. Influence of TiCl4 post-treatment on the porosity, pore size and the mass transport limitations
Treatment of TiO2 films fabricated with the commercially available 18NR-T titania paste with different concentrations of the aqueous TiCl4 solution during the post-treatment step influences the porosity and the pore size of the resulting photoanode. This modification of the TiO2 film morphology was found to impact the recombination and transport rate of charge carriers within the TiO2 photoanode thus impacting the overall device performance.
The TiCl4 post-treatment usually results in the growth of the small TiO2 nanoparticles onto the mesoporous TiO2 films and in the decrease in the overall BET surface area.21 The reduction in the overall surface area is dependent on the concentration of TiCl4 used during the post-treatment. Fig. 11 and Table S6 (ESI†) show the change in the surface area of both 18NR-T films and modified 18NR-T films upon exposure to different concentrations of TiCl4 during post-treatment. By reducing the concentration of TiCl4 in the post-treatment, the porosity and pore size increase, enhancing the transport rate of the cobalt species through the mesoporous TiO2 network and alleviating mass transport related restrictions of the photocurrent.
 Fig. 11  Comparison of the BET data for the mesoporous TiO2 films made using the commercially available Dyesol 18NR-T (left) and the modified 18NR-T (right) paste with different concentrations of the TiCl4 post treatment. 
Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†) show the current dynamics of devices made using different concentrations of TiCl4 on the TiO2 films sensitized with Y123 and higher concentrations (0.25 M to 0.5 M) of the pyridine additive in the electrolyte. With higher concentrations of the pyridine additive in the electrolyte, the resulting increase in viscosity requires the use of TiO2 films possessing greater porosity and pore sizes at full sun intensity. Also, the bulk electrolyte has to be reduced in volume to hasten shuttling of the redox species. A higher porosity and pore size are not only required when employing an electrolyte with a higher viscosity, but are also required for dyes with better absorption. The application of dyes that absorb more of the available light within a DSC device leads to higher JSC and the need for greater porosities and bigger pore sizes to ensure faster shuttling of the redox species between the photoanode and the counter electrode. This is evident upon changing the sensitizer in the cell from Y123 to a cocktail of SM342/Y123 (7:1), where the increase in pore size and porosity, achieved with the modified 18NR-T paste, enabled a higher JSC to be attained at full sun intensity.
The photocurrent action spectrum measurements indicate that the TiCl4 post-treatment affects the maximum attainable IPCE in the case of the SM342/Y123 cocktail. DSCs made from mesoporous films post-treated with 20 mM TiCl4 exhibited the highest increase in the IPCE spectral response. The IPCE action spectra recorded after 20 mM and 40 mM TiCl4 post-treatment are shown in Fig. 12. The narrowed pore size in films post-treated with a 40 mM TiCl4 solution obstructs the diffusion of the cobalt-based redox mediator, leading to regeneration, which in turn reduces the overall power conversion efficiency of the device.

2.3. Influence on the recombination rate in the case of cocktail dyes and one dye
Transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay measurements were performed to determine the cause of the decreased open circuit potential when decreasing the TiCl4 concentration used in the post-treatment step for the devices sensitized with Y123, as this observation is contrary to that observed previously in the case of the I−/I3− redox couple.22 The electron lifetime as a function of charge density for the dye Y123 utilizing photoanodes prepared using different concentrations of TiCl4 during the post-treatment step is presented in Fig. 13. The VOC was adjusted by varying the intensity of the bias light illuminated on the cell. The electron lifetime was observed to be 5 times longer for the films post-treated with 40 mM TiCl4 than the films treated with 13 mM TiCl4, with the difference becoming larger as the VOC increases.

Interestingly, the electron lifetime was observed to be higher when a higher concentration of TiCl4 was used in post-treatment, contrary to that reported previously.21–24
In the case of the devices made using a dye cocktail (SM342/Y123), the electron lifetime was found to be higher when an intermediate TiCl4 concentration (20 mM) was used during post-treatment, compared to the cases where higher and lower concentrations of TiCl4 post-treatment were applied. Fig. 14 shows the electron lifetime as a function of the charge density in devices sensitized with a cocktail of SM342/Y123 where different concentrations of TiCl4 are used in post-treatment. It was observed that devices using 20 mM TiCl4 post-treated films showed the lowest recombination rate. The same trend was observed in the case of the devices using TiO2 films fabricated with the 18NR-T paste and the modified 18NR-T paste, which indicates that the recombination rate is not influenced by changes in the porosity and pore size. At a fixed charge density, the recombination of electrons in the TiO2 films with Co(III)(bipy)3 in the electrolyte becomes faster when using TiCl4 concentrations higher than 20 mM during post-treatment. The faster recombination rate observed in examples where a higher concentration of TiCl4 is used could be attributed to the blocked voids and the narrowed pores, leading to a facilitated recombination rate and poor electron lifetime. In the case of the SM342/Y123 cocktail device, when lower concentrations of TiCl4 are used in post-treatment, i.e., less than 20 mM, the recombination rate is also higher, which could be attributed to increased recombination at the FTO surface.

2.4. Influence on the trap state distribution and the collection efficiency
The lower VOC observed upon lowering the concentration of TiCl4 during post-treatment in the case of the Y123 dye could be the result of the downward shift of the conduction band of TiO2. To check this possibility, the DOS of the films loaded with the sensitizer was determined from transient photocurrent decay measurements.31,32 The chemical capacitances of the Y123 dye-sensitized films employing different concentrations of TiCl4 during post-treatment as a function of the VOC are compared in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The chemical capacitance, Cμ is directly proportional to the density of states (DOS), Cμ = q(e) DOS, where q(e) is the charge of one electron. The Cμ values are very similar for the films with TiCl4 concentrations above 20 mM and below 20 mM a downward shift is observed. This demonstrates that there is no substantial contribution of a conduction band shift when using TiCl4 concentrations above 20 mM in post-treatment.
The trap state distribution as a function of the voltage has been measured for cells where different concentrations of TiCl4 have been used during post-treatment. Fig. 15 shows these results in cells sensitized with a cocktail solution of SM342/Y123 using both the 18NR-T paste and the modified 18NR-T paste. The modified 18NR-T paste (shown in Fig. 10b) shows a strong downward shift in the DOS curve as the concentration of TiCl4 is increased in the post-treatment. Conversely, the commercially available 18NR-T paste shows no observable change in the DOS. The lower VOC in examples where higher TiCl4 concentrations are used in post-treatment is also partly due to the downward shift of the trap states, as the VOC of the device is measured from the redox potential of the electrolyte to the conduction band edge of the TiO2 film. Upon increasing the concentration of TiCl4 in the post-treatment of films fabricated with the modified 18NR-T paste, the magnitude of the shift in the conduction band edge is approximately 100 mV. The downward shift in the conduction band edge can be attributed to the increase in the surface potential from the H+ generated with the increasing concentration of TiCl4 used during post-treatment.

(c) Collection efficiency as a function of the charge density of films made using the modified 18NR-T paste, post-treated with different concentrations of TiCl4. 
The electron transport rate within the TiO2 photoanode is also affected by the concentration of TiCl4 used during post-treatment. This effect can be seen in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Increasing the concentration of TiCl4 in post-treatment resulted in better electron transport within the photoanode, similar to that observed in the case of the iodide/triiodide redox mediators. Even though the electron transport rate through the photoanode is higher at greater TiCl4 post-treatment concentrations, the concomitant increase in the recombination rate resulted in a lowering of the collection efficiency. Higher collection efficiencies of around 95% were obtained in the intermediate concentration regime (20 mM) and deviation from this concentration resulted in lower collection efficiencies owing to higher recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.
By tuning of the TiCl4 concentration used in the post-treatment step during photoanode fabrication, diffusion limitations can be minimized in cobalt based dye sensitized solar cells. Especially in the event where higher currents are achieved through the use of a broadly absorbing dye cocktail (SM342/Y123), the simple addition of more ethyl cellulose during the paste preparation provides a TiO2 film with greater porosity and pore size which can further help to minimize mass transport limitations of the bulky redox couple through the photoanode.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that the concentration of TiCl4 utilized during post-treatment plays an important role in achieving high PCEs in dye-sensitized solar cells employing cobalt-based electrolytes. In the case of the dye Y123, where the maximum achievable JSC is lower than that in the case of a dye cocktail (i.e. SM342/Y123), simply reducing the concentration of TiCl4 used in the post-treatment step during photoanode fabrication resulted in an enhancement of the diffusion limited current and hence the observed JSC. Depending on the maximum achievable JSC, the porosity and pore size of the mesoporous TiO2 network must be optimized in order to facilitate the diffusion of the cobalt-based redox mediator through the mesoporous TiO2 network. The porosity and pore size of the mesoporous network can be easily modified through the addition of the excess ethyl cellulose polymer during the preparation of the screen printable TiO2 paste. As an example of the facile nature of this modification we have applied this concept to the commercially available Dyesol 18NR-T paste, thus achieving PCEs greater than 12.5% at full sun intensity. It is not only the porosity and the pore size that are influenced by the TiCl4 post-treatment, but also the recombination rate, electron transport rate within the TiO2 photoanode, trap state distribution, electron collection efficiency and the overall device performance are affected.
