    , Accepted 4th June 2013First published on 4th June 2013AbstractWe designed and synthesized two donor conjugated polymers (poly(2Z,2′Z)-2,2′-(2,5-bis(octyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)bis(3-(5-(3-(3-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] thiophen-1-yl)thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile (CN-PHTBTPB) and poly(2Z,2′Z)-2,2′-(2,5-bis(octyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)bis(3-(5-(3-(3-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophen-1-yl)thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile (CN-POTBTPB)), comprised of hexyl and octyl chains substituted at the 3-position of 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene moieties as a donor unit coupled with a 1,4-bis-(cyano-2-thienylvinylene) phenylene based precursor by means of Knoevenagel polycondensation followed by a chemical oxidative polymerization method. Both the synthesized polymers (CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB) exhibited reduced optical band gaps of about 1.86 eV. The resulting polymers were experimentally found to possess deep HOMO (about −5.50 to 5.78 eV) and high-lying LUMO (about −3.78 to 3.82 eV) energy levels. Theoretical calculations revealed that the variation in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are consistent with cyclic voltammetry measurements. Using these polymers, the bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Synthesized donor polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al was fabricated in open air. The device based on the CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB polymers delivered respectively power conversion efficiencies of 1.65% and 1.98% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, which indicates that this kind of conjugated polymer is a highly promising material for organic solar cell application. The clear correlation between the blend film morphology and the power conversion efficiency of the devices was observed via atomic force microscopic studies.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic solar cells based on π-conjugated polymers have been emerging as an attractive and cost-effective route to the wide use of solar energy for low-cost power generation.1 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, consisting of a light-absorbing narrow band gap conjugated donor polymer blended with acceptor fullerene derivatives in an interpenetrated network with nanoscale-sized domains, have emerged as the highest performance organic solar cells to date.2 Conceptionally, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) is the most represented electron donor polymer blended with [6,6]-phenyl- C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the photoactive layer in the organic BHJ solar cells, because it has delivered state-of-the-art power conversion efficiencies approaching 5–8%.3–5 The limitations of the rr-P3HT/PCBM system in further improving the efficiency of polymer solar cells is due to the (i) the relatively large band gap of rr-P3HT (∼1.9 eV) limiting the absorption of solar light with wavelengths below 650 nm, while a majority of the peak photon intensity of the solar spectrum is located at about 700 nm6 and (ii) a relatively small energy difference between the LUMO of PCBM and the HOMO of rr-P3HT results in a lower open-circuit voltage (Voc = 0.6–0.65 V), since Voc is linearly correlated to the energy level offset between the HOMO of the donor polymer and the LUMO of the electron acceptor.7 Therefore, maximizing the overall power conversion efficiency requires a delicate balancing of narrow band gap conjugated polymers in order to make the absorption spectra of the conjugated polymer match well with the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum. Furthermore, a low-lying HOMO energy level of the conjugated polymer represents one of the most efficient strategies to develop high performance solar cells.8,9
Currently, there are three main design considerations that could improve the narrow energy band gap, extend the light absorption in the near-infrared region and give a higher absorption coefficient of the conjugated donor polymer and improved charge mobility, which are rationally based on these approaches: (i) chemical rigidification of aromatic rings in the conjugated polymer systems,10,11 (ii) increasing the quinoidal character of the aromatic basic units12 (iii) creation of an photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) through the association of alternating conjugated electron rich and electron poor moieties in the conjugated molecular backbone.13 A major advantage in combining the donor–acceptor conjugated polymers allows the narrowing of the energy band gap to the desired magnitude and extending the absorption band to the near-infrared region, in addition to the introduction of electronic push-pull driving forces which facilitates electron delocalization by the creation of quinoid character (D = A → D+ = A−) over the conjugated backbone.14
Following these design rationales, great pieces of design strategy have been used by researchers to attain a reduced band gap (Eg = 1.5–2.0 eV) and narrow band gap (Eg = <1.5 eV)15,16 conjugated polymers consisting of alternating electronic push-pull motifs towards extending their light absorption into the near-infrared (NIR) region and show that the fabricated BHJ solar cells may have high efficiencies.17–21 Following the above concept, the electron-rich nature of alkyl, alkoxy side chain substituted thiophene ring based heterocycles incorporated into the 1,4-bis-(1-cyano-2-thienylvinylene) phenylene precursors (CN-PPV-based derivatives) have been developed to fabricate BHJ solar cells with efficiencies exceeding from 0.3 to 3.3% at AM 1.5G illumination.22–25 Although the results from the BHJ devices indicate that these conjugated polymers are promising photovoltaic materials, the performances of these materials are much lower than the theoretical values as expected from their optical band gap and frontier molecular orbitals energy values. This extensive deviation reveals that the photovoltaic performances of conjugated polymers are not exclusively determined by their optical band gap and molecular orbital energy levels. Besides the charge carrier mobility and solubility of the donor polymers in the processing solvent prior to device fabrication are also important for improving the photovoltaic performance of the polymers. Nevertheless, the properties of these conjugated polymers are highly sensitive for designing the molecular structure of the polymers, including the backbone and alkyl chain architectures, which can be used to fine-tune the optical band gap of the conjugated polymers. From this point of view, the introduction of a branched alkyl chain substituent on the oligobenzo[c]thiophene unit in the main chain of the conjugated polymer structures are of importance in increasing the charge carrier mobility, solubility, broadening the absorption spectrum via the strong π–π stacking ability26 and also the appropriate frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO energy levels), which serve as potential electron donors in polymer BHJ solar cells.
Recently, we designed a strategy based on a D–A conjugated donor polymer (poly(2-(4-{1-cyano-2-[5-(3-thiophen-2-yl-benzo[c] thiophen-1-yl)-thiophen-2-yl]-vinyl}-2,5-bis-hexyloxy-phenyl)-but-2-enenitrile, CN-PTBTBPB, with a wide optical band gap (Eg) ∼ 1.95 eV) and with the electron-rich nature of the 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene moieties incorporated into the 1,4-bis-(cyano-2-thienylvinylene) phenylene precursors which behaved as a promising electron donor polymer. The fabricated bulk heterojunction solar cell using the above polymer as a potential donor delivered a power conversion efficiency of 1.33% in combination with PCBM.27a Furthermore, in order to reduce the optical band gap of the conjugated donor polymer and to improve the co-planarity, additional branched alkyl side chains with different lengths were introduced into the polymer backbone of CN-PTBTBPB since the introduction of alkyl side chains helps polymer organization and intermolecular π–π stacking interaction in the solid state.28 Hence, two structurally related D–A conjugated donor polymers (Scheme 1) consisting of alkyl side chains (i.e., hexyl and octyl groups) substituted at the third position of the 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene donor moiety incorporated at the 1,4-bis-(cyano-2-thienylvinylene) phenylene precursors were used to investigate the influence of alkyl side chains on their photovoltaic properties.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and structural characterization

Scheme 1 summarizes the structures and the synthetic methods for the synthesis of the benzo[c]thiophene analogs of carbaldehyde compounds, monomers and polymers. The key monomers 10 and 11 were prepared according to the procedure described in the experimental section. As outlined in Scheme 1, the polymers were synthesized by a chemical oxidative polymerization with anhydrous FeCl3 according to the conditions described in the experimental section. The yielded crude polymers were washed extensively with methanol, followed by Soxhlet extraction with methanol and acetone successively to remove byproducts and oligomers. Finally, the polymers were extracted with chloroform, recollected by precipitation in methanol, and dried under vacuum. The isolated polymers were soluble in almost all common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, THF, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The molecular structures of the key monomers and polymers were confirmed by FT–IR, mass spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
Characterization of the CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB polymers
The synthesized polymers have relatively high molecular weights (CN-PHTBTPB: Mn = 42 kg mol−1, Mw = 46 kg mol−1 and CN-POTBTPB: Mn = 39 kg mol−1, Mw = 44 kg mol−1) and low polydispersity indexes (PDI) (CN-PHTBTPB:1.08 and CN-POTBTPB: 1.11), which were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) in THF relative to a narrow low molecular weight polystyrene standard and the data is summarized in Table 1. The molecular structures of the synthesized polymers were confirmed by 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The 1H-NMR spectra of the polymers show the chemical shift of the branched alkyl side chains at 0.78–2.67 ppm and the methyleneoxy protons (–CH2O–) appear in the range of 3.94–4.14 ppm. Furthermore, the aromatic phenyl ring protons appear at 6.95–7.06 ppm and the vinyl protons adjacent to the phenyl rings appear at 7.35–7.47 ppm. The protons of the 1.3-di(thiophene-2-yl) ring of benzo[c]thiophene moiety adjacent to the oligobenzo[c]thiophene rings and the aromatic phenyl protons on the oligobenzo[c]thiophene system are found in the range of 7.05–8.00 ppm. Finally, the aliphatic protons resonate at 0.84, 1.25, 1.56 and 2.64 ppm respectively. Thus from the 1H NMR spectral studies (See Fig. S1 and Fig. S2, ESI† in the supporting information), the assigned peaks are found to be consistent with the proposed structure.

Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers since it is one of the imperative parameters for photovoltaic device fabrication. The thermal properties of the CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB polymers were investigated by means of thermal gravimetric analysis in a nitrogen atmosphere using a 20 °C min−1 temperature ramp from 50 to 800 °C. The thermograms revealed that both the polymers exhibit a two-stage weight loss (See Fig. S5a and S5b, ESI† in the supporting information). The first stage weight loss occurs at 140 °C, which is assigned to aromatic ring degradation, and the second stage weight loss takes place at 330 °C, after which the polymer is then stable up to 455 °C, this can be attributed to decomposition of the conjugated polymer back bone. Thus, both the polymers exhibit good thermal stability and also less than 46% of material remains available at above 500 °C. Consequently, this assures us that these polymers are good potential candidates for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices.
Photophysical measurement
The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra and molar extinction coefficient spectra of polymers CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB were acquired in chloroform solution (1 × 10−5 M) and their absorption data is given in Table 2 (Fig. 1 (a and b). Both the polymers exhibit two distinct absorption bands: one broad absorption band in the far UV region (330–430 nm), which is probably ascribed to the π–π* electronic transition derived from the close analogues of the alkyl chain substituted 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene conjugated system, and the other longer wavelength absorption band is in the visible region (450–530 nm) with a relatively strong absorption peak which can be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of the conjugated polymer framework. Thus, both the polymers exhibit a reduced band gap of 1.86 eV based on their respective onset absorption spectrum. The absorption spectra of both CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB in chloroform solution were essentially identical to each other, with the latter having a small (ca. 5 nm) red-shift of the absorption maximum, as well as on onset.

Thus, the absorption spectrum of the synthesized conjugated polymers is linearly relative to the effective conjugation length induced steric hindrance due to the introduction of branched alkyl side chains at the third position. This approach significantly reduces the optical band gap (Eg) of the resulting polymers (CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB) by 0.1–0.11 eV, in comparison with the donor polymer without alkyl side chain substitution.26a Consequently, these polymers are suitable for improving the light-harvesting properties.
The florescence spectra of both the polymers were also acquired in chloroform (1 × 10−5 M) with an excitation wavelength at 400 nm (Fig. 2(a and b)) and the summarized data is collated in Table 3. Upon excitation of the polymer solution at 400 nm, both polymers exhibit single emission band. Additionally, the excitation spectra of both polymers have a vibronic structure, with peak maxima in the wavelength range of 420–435 nm and one shoulder peak at 385 nm, while fluorescence peaks appear at 530 nm. Time-resolved fluorescence recorded at the emission maxima (λmax = 525 nm) shows that the residual (charge transfer) emission of both polymers in chloroform has two-exponential decay functions (Fig. 2(c and d)).

Electrochemical analysis
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded using thin films of CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB polymers prepared via a drop-casted technique as described in the experimental section. The CV curves of both polymers showed three quasi-reversible reduction waves and three quasi-reversible oxidation waves at a moderately high reduction and oxidation potential respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. On the anodic sweep, both polymers showed an oxidation peak with an onset potential of 0.79 V for CN-PHTBTPB and 0.82 V for CN-POTBTPB respectively. In contrast, the cathodic sweep showed an onset reduction potential of −0.94 V for CN-PHTBTPB and −0.96 V for CN-POTBTPB. This was based on the standard redox potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+), which is assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV relative to vacuum level and the value of NHE was used as −4.74 eV for conjugated polymers throughout the study. We evaluated the energy parameters, the HOMO and LUMO levels, as well as the electrochemical band gap (Eg,ec) using the following equations:HOMO (eV) = −e (Eonsetox + 4.74) (eV)LUMO (eV) = −e (Eonsetred + 4.74) (eV)Eecg = Eonsetox − Eonsetred (eV)where Eonsetox and Eonsetred are the oxidation and reduction potentials relative to the Ag/Ag+ electrode. The estimated redox potentials and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO energy levels were thus estimated from the onset oxidation potentials to be −5.53 eV for CN-PHTBTPB and −5.56 eV for CN-POTBTPB respectively. Indeed, the incorporation of the electron pushing ability of longer alkyl chains at the 3-position of the 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene donor moiety in the main chain of conjugated polymer afforded significant changes in the HOMO energy level of the resulting polymers. It is worth mentioning that the alteration in the HOMO energy levels of these polymers is essential to achieve the expected higher open circuit voltage (Voc) values and also making them electron-donor polymers in BHJ solar cells. The estimated LUMO energy levels from the onset reduction potentials were −3.80 eV for CN-PHTBTPB and −3.78 eV for CN-POTBTPB respectively. The electrochemical band gap is found to be ca. 1.73 eV for CN-PHTBTPB and 1.78 eV for CN-POTBTPB respectively. A complete picture of the energy band diagram of both polymers (Fig. 4) was constructed based on the electrochemical results and shows the deeper HOMO energy level (ca. −5.53 eV for CN-PHTBTPB and ca. −5.56 eV for CN-POTBTPB) for the polymers, which is well below the cut-off for the ambient air stability to oxidation (i.e. ca. −5.2 eV).29 The energy level differences (LUMO offset) was greater than ∼ca. 0.5 eV between the LUMO levels of both polymers and LUMO of PCBM (−4.3 eV). This assures that the energy level differences of both the polymers could provide a sufficient driving force for the direct electron transfer from the photoexcited polymer to PCBM. Besides, the LUMO energy levels that CN-PHTBTPB (ca. −3.80 eV) and CN-POTBTPB (ca. −3.78 eV) possessed were higher than that of the parent CN-PTBTBPB polymer (ca. −3.87 eV) without alkyl side chain substitution,27a which indicates that the alkyl chains with different substituent lengths on the 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene analogs also have a significant effect on the LUMO energy levels (i.e., shifting the reduction potentials) of the resulting polymers. Consequently, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting donor polymers can be fine-tuned further by modifying the molecular structure of the conjugated polymers as the platform for highly efficient polymer solar cells.

Each measurement was calibrated with ferrocene at scan rate of 100 mV s−1.

Theoretical calculations
In order to support and clarify the experimental results further, the structural and electronic properties of CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB at the molecular level, DFT calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 09 programme suite polarized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The optimized geometries of CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB that are given in Fig. 5 and 6 indicate that both the CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB polymers look like asymmetric molecules. The computed results revealed that the all the C–C bonds in both the polymer backbones are partial double bonds, which is most important for comprehensive π-delocalization to occur on the polymer system. Fig. 7 and 8 show the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO, HOMO-1, HOMO-2 and HOMO-3, LUMO, LUMO + 1, LUMO + 2 and LUMO + 3) and the corresponding energy level diagram computed at B3LYP/6-31g(d) level. As clearly shown in Fig. 7 and 8, the HOMO, HOMO-2 and LUMO, and LUMO + 1 of both the polymers are evenly localized on the entire π-conjugated polymer system, whereas the HOMO-1, HOMO-3 and LUMO + 2 are mainly localized on the branched alkyl chain substituted 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene conjugated system. Nevertheless, the LUMO + 3 levels of both the polymers are localized on the alkyl side chain substituted 1,3-di(thiophene-2- yl)benzo[c]thiophene moiety, as well as the electron-withdrawing character of the cyano-phenylenevinylene unit. On the other hand, the HOMO-1, HOMO-3 and LUMO + 2 are predominantly localized on either ends of both the polymer systems which indicates that the HOMO → LUMO + 2, HOMO-1 → LUMO and HOMO-3 → LUMO + 2 transitions, as expected, arise from intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) and the other absorptions are mainly of a π → π* nature of polymer segments. The estimated band gap for both the polymers from the low energetic edge of the absorption spectrum appearing at 663 nm is Egopt = 1.87 eV for CN-PHTBTPB and at 666 nm is Egopt = 1.86 eV for CN-POTBTPB, respectively. The calculated band gaps from the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of both the polymers by DFT are found to be Eg,DFT = 1.72 eV for CN-PHTBTPB and Eg,DFT = 2.36 eV for CN-POTBTPB, respectively. Consequently, the calculated band gap is in line with the experimentally determined reduced optical band gap.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties, typical BHJ devices were made by sandwiching a mixture of as synthesized donor polymers (CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB) with a soluble fullerene-based component (PCBM) between the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO and Al electrodes, respectively. The BHJ device structures are represented as follows: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/CN-PHTBTPB:PCBM(100 nm)(1:1,w/w)/LiF(5 nm)/Al(110 nm)(D1)] and [ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/CN-POTBTPB:PCBM(100 nm)(1:1,w/w)/LiF(5 nm)/Al(110 nm) (D2)]. In order to examine the device performance, the semi-logarithmic current density (J)-voltage (V) characteristics (Fig. 9) of the fabricated devices were measured in the dark and under AM 1.5G illuminations from a calibrated solar simulator and also J–V curves of the devices (D1 and D2) are shown in Fig. S6, ESI†. The overall results of the maximum and average power conversion efficiency of the solar devices are summarized in Table 3. From Table 3, the device D1 delivered an open circuit voltage (Voc) of about 0.72 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of about 4.33 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of about 0.53, leading to a power conversion efficiency of about 1.65%. In contrast, the device D2 exhibited an efficiency of 1.98% with a short circuit current (Jsc) of about 4.89 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of about 0.74 V, and a fill factor of about 0.55.

The typical photoaction spectra (IPCE) of devices (D1 and D2) are depicted in Fig. 10. The figures show an onset at about 660 nm (1.87 eV) for CN-PHTBTPB:PCBM (D1) and at about 655 nm (1.89 eV) for CN-POTBTPB:PCBM (D2), which is relatively identical to their respective absorption spectra of the polymers. The calculated IPCE values of D1 and D2 in the wide wavelength range from 750 to 300 nm, indicates that both polymers contribute in the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy. The IPCE (%) of the D1 device exhibits a maximum of 34% at 465 nm, which is noticeably lower than that of device D2 (56% at 473 nm).
 Fig. 10  Photoaction spectra (IPCE) of the BHJ devices (D1 and D2) based on the CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB polymers. 
Both polymers have characteristic moderate open circuit voltages (around 0.70–0.74 V) due to the electron-pushing properties of the alkyl chain substituted at the 3-position of the 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene segment by the benzene ring system through the cyanovinylene linkage which plays a key role in fine-tuning the energy levels of the polymers. The exhibited open circuit voltage of the resulting polymers is 0.2 ± 0.01 V lower than the theoretical voltage value (0.93 V for CN-PHTBTPB and 0.96 V for the CN-POTBTPB polymer).30 The reason for such a difference is due to the dissociation of the geminate-polaron pair and subsequent losses in the relaxation of the electron and hole into their charge transfer state. From the IPCE spectrum of the polymer blend film (Fig. 10), it can be further seen that a relatively limited fill factor is observed in the case of the D1 device, which could be ascribed to the limited exciton dissociation rate compared to that of the D2 device.
AFM studies
The study of the topographic film morphology and phase images using AFM on the fabricated devices have provided deep insight into the significant distinction in the performance of the active layers of CN-PHTBTPB:PCBM (D1; Fig. 11a) and CN-POTBTPB:PCBM (D2; Fig. 12a) devices. However, both active layers surfaces are smoother, as evidenced by their low mean roughness (Ra) values less than 2 nm (i.e., 1.96 nm mean roughness for the CN-PHTBTPB:PCBM and 1.47 nm for CN-POTBTPB:PCBM blend film).

As seen clearly from Fig. 11a and 12a, the surface morphology of the D1 blend film exhibits phase separation into relatively large islands with domain sizes in the range of 30–110 nm and root-mean-square (rms) roughness (Rq = 3.259 nm for the CN-PHTBTPB:PCBM blend film), whereas the D2 blend film shows small islands with root-mean-square (rms) roughness (Rq = 2.389 nm for the CN-POTBTPB:PCBM blend film) which is well supported by their corresponding phase contrast image (Fig. 11b and Fig. 12b). This large degree of aggregation domains (domain sizes) is much larger than the exciton diffusion length of ca. 5–20 nm,31 which leads to charge recombination and low charge carrier generation at the polymer/PCBM heterointerfaces. The XRD analysis results of the polymer films prepared via a drop-cast technique are amorphous in nature (See Fig. S7, ESI†) and pronounced intermolecular π–π stacking peaks are observed at 2θ = 21.20° for the CN-PHTBTPB polymer film and at 2θ = 21.22° for the CN-POTBTPB polymer film.32
Experimental section
Materials synthesis
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. All solvents were freshly distilled prior to use: Tetrahedrofuran was distilled using Na/benzophenone; dichloromethane was distilled over anhydrous phosphorus pentaoxide (P2O5) and chloroform was passed through an alumina column to remove the ethanol before being distilled over K2CO3. The tert-butanol (t-BuOH) was freshly distilled over CaH2. All column chromatographic separations were carried out on Merck silica gel (230–400 mesh) and neutral alumina (Aluminium Oxide Active, neutral Activity I–II). Aqueous solutions of poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as such.

Characterization methods

1H-NMR spectra were realized on a 300/400 MHz BRUKER spectrometer in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K, unless specified otherwise. Chemical shifts (δ values) were recorded in units of ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. The average molecular weights and polydispersity index of the polymers were determined by a Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) method in THF as eluent by referring to polystyrene standards. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin Elmer Pyris-1 thermogravimetric analyzer with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a computer controlled AUTOLAB-potentiostat/galvanostat, Netherlands.
Photophysical measurements
The UV-vis absorption spectra and emission spectra were recorded on a double beam ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Model: T90+, PG Instruments Ltd, UK) and Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (RF-5301 PC), respectively. The optical band gap was calculated from the onset of the absorption spectra. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried out in a picosecond time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer with a tunable Ti-sapphire laser (TSUNAMI, Spectra physics, USA) as the excitation source of the 400–420 nm excitation wavelength. The fluorescence decay curves were analyzed using the software provided by IBH (DAS-6).
Electrochemical analysis
Electrochemical measurements were recorded on a computer controlled AUTOLAB-potentiostat-galvanostat in a conventional three-electrode configuration using polymer thin film drop-casting from chloroform on a glassy carbon disk as the working electrode (3.0 mm in diameter), platinum-wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M) as the reference electrode in argon-saturated acetonitrile (CH3CN, HPLC grade) solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The potential was internally calibrated using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the redox couple which was estimated to have an oxidation potential of −4.8 eV vs. vacuum. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the copolymer were estimated based on a value of −4.8 eV for Fc/Fc+ with respect to the zero vacuum level.
Film morphology
Topographic and phase images of the blend polymer (active material) were measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM, AFM, XE-100, Park Systems), operated in a non-contact mode with commercially available Si cantilevers (crystal silicon tip), with a resonant frequency (Fo) of 300–350 KHz) and a typical spring constant (K) of 20–100 N m−1. The scanner was a 100 micrometer scanner, and the scan rate was 0.50–1 Hz in air. The off-line image processing and analysis (i.e., roughness) were performed using DI off-line software (XEI Corp). Several locations of the film were examined to ensure uniformity and reproducibility.
Density functional theory
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 programme package.36 The polymers were optimized at the hybrid exchange–correlation B3LYP functional in conjugation with the 6–31 g(d) basis set. It has already been shown that B3LYP/6–31 g(d) gives decent ground state structures of conjugated polymers.37
Polymer solar cell fabrication and characterization
For the solar cell device fabrication, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated conducting glass substrates (15–20 Ω cm−2) were used as the anode and aluminium as the cathode. First, ITO substrates were patterned in isolated configuration, followed by ozonization for 90 min and then cleaned with detergent, ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min in each solvent and finally dried in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h. The thickness and roughness of ITO were 110 and 10 nm, respectively, measured using a Tencor Alpha Step 500 thickness profilometer. A hole transporting layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 1000 rpm for 1 min and was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min on a hot plate under vacuum. A blend mixture consisting of donor polymers (CN-PHTBTPB and CN-POTBTPB):PCBM was made in anhydrous chlorobenzene (1:1 weight ratio at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1). In order to attain homogeneity, the solution was stirred for 5 h at 60 °C and then filtered using a PTFE filter (0.2 μm pore size). Then the above mixture was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm for 1 min and the resulting films were dried at 100 °C under high vacuum for 30 min. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS (40 nm) and donor polymer:PCBM (100 nm) layers were measured using the above mentioned profilometer after the surface of the films had been cut with a diamond cutter to expose the substrate. Then, the lithium fluoride (LiF) and aluminium layer of thickness 5 nm and 110 nm was deposited on the polymer films by thermal evaporation at a pressure of less than 5 × 10−6 mbar to form the cathode. We fabricated a polymer solar cell device with the typical structures as follows: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/CN-PHTBTPB:PCBM (100 nm) (1:1,w/w)/LiF(5 nm)/Al(110 nm)(D1) and ITO/PEDOT-PSS(40 nm)/CN-POTBTPB:PCBM (100 nm) (1:1,w/w)/LiF(5 nm)/Al(110 nm)(D2). Such a fabricated device consisted of 4 isolated devices per substrate with an active area of 0.25 cm2 per device (Fig. 13) and the thickness of the photoactive layer was 100 nm. After encapsulation by UV-curing glue, the electrical characterization (such as the short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF)) of the encapsulated devices was performed in air using a Keithley 2400 semiconductor characterization system and an Oriel white light solar simulator operating at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5 G (air mass 1.5 global) condition.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was measured with an Oriel 300 W Xe Arc lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 260¼ monochromator. The number of incident photons was calculated for each wavelength using a calibrated monocrystalline silicon diode as reference.
Conclusion
In conclusion, conjugated donor polymers comprising alkyl side chains with different lengths substituted at the 3-position of the 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene donor moiety coupled with 1,4-bis-(cyano-2-thienylvinylene) phenylene precursors were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation reaction followed by chemical oxidative polymerization. The presence of the branched alkyl side chains with different lengths at the 3-position of 1,3-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzo[c]thiophene unit resulted in deeper HOMO and higher-lying LUMO energy levels and a reduced band gap which is propitious to increase the moderate VOC values and light-harvesting properties. The maximum PCE of the device based on the CN-POTBTPB polymer reached about 1.98%, whereas the device based on the CN-PHTBTPB polymer exhibited a PCE of 1.65%. Nevertheless, the fabricated device based on the CN-PHTBTPB polymer blend film renders a relatively limited fill factor and efficiency, which is due to the phase separation into relatively large island domains found via AFM study and thus, a clear correlation was revealed between the blend film morphology and the power conversion efficiency of the devices. Further, the AFM images of both the blend films also correlated well with the IPCE spectra of the respective active layer.
