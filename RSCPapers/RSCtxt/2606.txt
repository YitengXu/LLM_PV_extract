    , Accepted 24th June 2014First published on 24th June 2014AbstractOn a planar substrate the sequential deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is optimized by retarding the crystallization of PbI2. This strategy overcomes the problem of incomplete conversion and uncontrolled particle sizes of perovskite in the absence of mesoporous scaffolds, greatly increasing the film reproducibility. Highly efficient and reproducible planar-structured perovskite solar cells were obtained with the best efficiency of 13.5%, average efficiency of 12.5% and a small standard deviation of 0.57 from a total of 120 cells.

Broader context
Great progress has been made in thin film photovoltaics due to the emergency of organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites as efficient light harvesters. Due to their ambipolar semiconducting nature and good charge transporting ability, device structures of perovskite solar cells have been gradually transformed from sensitized mesoporous structure to planar or mesoporous-planar composite structures. Although a quick increase of power conversion efficiency has been witnessed in quite a short period, the film formation and crystal growth of such perovskites still need in-depth studies, especially for a bulk perovskite layer on the substrate. A two step sequential deposition of perovskite provides an efficient low-cost route to high performance perovskite solar cells. However, it suffers from incomplete conversion and uncontrolled crystal sizes as well as morphology of perovskite on planar substrates. Here, we use the strongly coordinative solvent DMSO for the processing of PbI2 to attain amorphous featured precursor films. Such amorphous films can efficiently generate uniform perovskite crystals with a full conversion. Planar-structured solar cells combining these perovskite films yielded highly reproducible performances. This study presents a universally useful strategy for preparing high quality perovskite films.

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have gained much attention in the past years because of their high efficiency, low cost, and the ease to make these materials solution processable.1–4 Organo-lead iodide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3 have been applied in solid state mesoscopic solar cells where they were found to act not only as a light harvester, but also as an electron and hole conductor.5–10 The ambipolar semiconducting nature of perovskite enabled the feasible construction of planar device architectures,11–13 which simplifies their fabrication and makes it easier to construct flexible14,15 and tandem solar cells. Planar-structured devices based on vapour deposited perovskite films have achieved high efficiencies of 12–15%.11,16 However, vapour deposition will greatly increase the cost of large scale fabrication with respect to the cost-effective solution process.
A two-step sequential deposition of perovskite provides an efficient low-cost route to high performance perovskite solar cells. It was first applied in mesoscopic-structured substrates,17,18 and soon after spread to planar substrates such as ZnO,19 TiO220 as well as PSS:PEDOT,15 enabling the successful construction of several kinds of planar-structured solar cells. However, two problems were found for the sequential deposition on planar substrates: one is the incomplete conversion of PbI2 and the other is the uncontrolled perovskite crystal sizes as well as surface morphology.12,17 Full conversion of a 200 nm thick PbI2 film to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite requires 2–3 h, which leads to the dissolution and/or peeling-off of the perovskite film into the solution.21 A short dipping time (seconds to tens of minutes) of a PbI2 in CH3NH3I solution only converts part of PbI2 and results in a CH3NH3PbI3–PbI2 mixture, which is not bad for cell efficiency20 but is not good for the device’s reproducibility because the relative proportion of CH3NH3PbI3-to-PbI2 will be inconstant from batch to batch. On the other hand, the crystal sizes of perovskite on the planar substrate without a mesoporous scaffold are difficult to control, which is also unfavourable for device reproducibility. A large deviation of device performance will limit the in-depth study for further improvements. Therefore, the sequential deposition on flat substrates for highly reproducible planar-structured solar cells still needs optimization.
Back to the two problems mentioned above, we found that both of them were caused by the easy crystallization of PbI2, which generated different sizes of PbI2 crystals on the substrate. On the one hand, large crystals of PbI2 greatly decrease the accessibility of organic ammonium iodide to the inner lead sites, resulting in incomplete conversions. On the other hand, different sizes of PbI2 crystals directly lead to different sizes of perovskite and an uncontrolled morphology. Bearing this in mind, we considered that inhibiting the crystallization of PbI2 may be beneficial to realize the full conversion and control of particle sizes of sequentially deposited perovskite. Here, we use a strongly coordinative solvent of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) instead of the commonly used N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF) to dissolve PbI2 and fabricate PbI2 films. The coordination between PbI2 and the solvent molecules, such as DMSO and DMF has been well studied in the literature.22,23 The coordination ratio between Pb and the solvent is 1:1 and 1:2 for DMF and DMSO, with the Pb–O bond length of 2.431 Å and 2.386 Å, respectively, indicating that DMSO has a stronger coordination ability with PbI2 than that of DMF. The strong interaction between DMSO and Pb2+ can retard the crystallization of PbI2 as illustrated in Scheme 1, resulting in a uniform PbI2 film showing an amorphous character. When used in sequential deposition, such films can efficiently generate perovskite crystals with a full conversion within 10 min. Moreover, the resultant perovskite showed a small distribution of perovskite particle sizes of 200 ± 20 nm. Planar-structured solar cells combining this perovskite film with atomic layer deposited (ALD) TiO224 and spiro-OMeTAD as the electron- and hole-selective contacts yielded the highest efficiency of 13.5%, average efficiency of 12.5% and a very small standard deviation of 0.57 from a total of 120 cells, exhibiting quite a high reproducibility.
 Scheme 1  Retarding the crystallization of PbI2 by using the strongly coordinated solvent DMSO. 
The dissolution of inorganic PbI2 in an organic solvent relies on the coordination between Pb2+ and the electronegative atoms (such as oxygen) of the solvent molecules. Several kinds of polar solvents that contain electronegative oxygen atoms, such as DMF, dimethylacetamide, DMSO and γ-butyrolactone, showed solubility to PbI2 in different extents. In a preliminary examination, we found that DMSO has the largest solubility (>2 M at room temperature) among these solvents, further indicating strong coordination of sulfoxide oxygen with Pb2+.24,25 On the other hand, DMSO has a low volatility due to its relatively high boiling point (189 °C) and low saturated vapour pressure (0.76 kPa at 60 °C), which should be a benefit to maintain solvent–PbI2 complexes stable in the films and inhibit PbI2 crystallization in a long time scale. Therefore, DMSO was selected to fabricate PbI2 films and compared to commonly used DMF ones.
PbI2 films were prepared on compact TiO2 substrates by spin-coating a solution containing 1 M PbI2 in DMF or DMSO. Their colour is apparently different as they have different absorption spectra (Fig. 1a). The DMF based PbI2 film features an absorption peak at around 500 nm, which is the characteristic band-gap excitation of crystallized PbI2 semiconductors. While the DMSO based PbI2 film does not exhibit such an absorption band, providing preliminary evidence of uncrystallized PbI2. Fig. 1b shows the XRD pattern of both PbI2 films. The DMF based PbI2 film shows a strong diffraction peak at 12.6°, corresponding to the 001 lattice plane of crystallized PbI2. However, this characteristic diffraction peak is not present in the DMSO based PbI2 film, further indicating its amorphous feature. We considered that such an amorphous character was attributed to the stable PbI2–DMSO complexes within the PbI2 film, which effectively inhibited PbI2 crystal formation as proposed in Scheme 1. Through a simple weighting experiment (see the ESI†), we estimated that the molar ratio between PbI2 and DMSO in the film is 1:5–6. It is not true that one Pb atom can coordinate with 5–6 DMSO molecules. As mentioned above, the coordination ratio between Pb and DMSO is 1:2. We considered that there are both coordinated and uncoordinated DMSO molecules in the film. Such a system plays an important role for retarding the crystallization of PbI2, and enabling an amorphous feature of the film. This amorphous film could be stored for several months at room temperature. Note that after heating the film at 120 °C under vacuum for 2 h, it recovered as crystallized PbI2 and showed similar XRD and absorption spectra to those of DMF based PbI2 films (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).

Fig. 2 compares the surface morphology of DMF and DMSO based PbI2 films. In the DMF case, PbI2 was found to form layered crystals with sizes of tens to several hundred of nanometres. In contrast, the DMSO based PbI2 film had a much more uniform surface due to its amorphous character. We know that the crystallized PbI2 can react with CH3NH3I efficiently as the ordered crystal structure already exists, only requiring the intercalation of CH3NH3I into the lattice to form CH3NH3PbI3. However, the conversion of amorphous PbI2 to ordered perovskite crystals has not been reported. Intriguingly, we found that the faint yellow DMSO based PbI2 film can turn to dark red quickly upon dipping the film into a CH3NH3I solution, indicating that uncrystallized PbI2 can also generate perovskite crystals. This may be attributed to the fact that CH3NH3I has a stronger binding capacity than DMSO molecules with Pb2+ and the former can substitute the latter to self-assemble into perovskite crystals. In the following, we examined the dynamics of perovskite formation from the DMF and DMSO based PbI2 films by optical absorption.

Fig. 3a shows the evolution of the absorbance at 750 nm (corresponding to the amount of perovskite) versus dipping time for both kinds of PbI2 films. We can see that the crystallized PbI2 in DMF based films indeed reacts very fast with CH3NH3I and the absorbance quickly increases from 0 to 0.4 upon dipping for 1 min. Prolonging the dipping time only slowly increased the absorbance until 40 min and after that it decreased to some extent. This can be rationalized by considering that PbI2 at the crystal surface can completely react with CH3NH3I within 1 min (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), while converting the inner PbI2 to perovskite needs quite a long time. The decrease of absorbance after 40 min is caused by the peeling-off of perovskite as black particles that could be found in the solution after long dipping times. Both the incomplete conversion and peeling-off of perovskite will limit its application in future reproducible devices. For the DMSO based PbI2 film, it reacted not as fast as DMF–PbI2 in the first 1 min and the absorbance only increased to 0.3. However, the absorbance continuously increased during dipping for 10 min, and then it slowly decreased upon further extending dipping time. The reason for the relatively slower conversion in the first minute may be that CH3NH3I needed to drive away the DMSO molecules on Pb2+ before the perovskite crystals could be formed. This will slow down the reaction dynamic to some extent. The continuous growth of absorbance in the first 10 min indicates that all the Pb2+ in the amorphous film has almost equal probability to react with CH3NH3I. Fig. 3b compares the XRD patterns of both kinds of films after dipping for 10 min. Note that these film were rinsed with 2-propanol and dried at 70 °C for 15 min before XRD characterization, which removed any residual solvent (DMSO) (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The DMSO–PbI2 based sample (red line) only showed a set of diffraction peaks of tetragonal structured perovskite at 14.08°, 28.5°, and 31.8°. For the DMF based sample, the PbI2 diffraction (2θ = 12.6°) still exists in addition to the perovskite diffractions, indicative of an incomplete conversion. Here, we emphasized that full conversion is crucial to the reproducibility of device performance because the amount of PbI2 is uncontrollable if it exists. The relative proportions of CH3NH3PbI3-to-PbI2 are inconstant from batch to batch, which increases the number of variable factors affecting the reproducibility of solar cell devices.

Except for the remaining PbI2, the morphology of perovskite film is another factor that affects the reproducibility of device performance. Fig. 4a and b show the SEM images of perovskite films obtained from DMF and DMSO based PbI2 films, respectively. The sizes of the perovskite crystals obtained from the DMF based PbI2 film are discretely distributed, which was analysed by software (Nano Measure) as shown in Fig. 4c. The particle sizes are broadly distributed from 50 to 330 nm. This is in agreement with the size distribution of the PbI2 crystals in the DMF based PbI2 films. In contrast, the perovskite crystals formed from the DMSO based PbI2 film have a smaller distribution, with more than 80% located in a small range around 200 ± 20 nm (Fig. 4d). This should be attributed to the controlled reaction dynamic and equal reaction probability of DMSO–PbI2 with CH3NH3I. Such a morphology of perovskite films with relatively uniform distributions of crystal sizes is expected to be beneficial to device reproducibility.

Two groups (A and B, 120 cells for each group) of planar-structured perovskite solar cells were constructed with assemblies of glass–FTO–compact TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3–spiro-OMeTAD–Au. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites in group A and group B were prepared from DMSO and DMF based PbI2 films, respectively. The compact TiO2 layer in the solar cell device is made by atomic layered deposition, which we have proved to be beneficial to device performance and reproducibility.24 The detailed fabrication procedure is described in the ESI.†Fig. 5a shows the SEM cross-section of a complete cell taken from group A. Clearly, it has a planar structure in which the poly-crystalline perovskite layer is sandwiched between the compact TiO2 layer and the spiro-OMeTAD base HTM layer. Fig. 5b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best cell in group A. It exhibited a high JSC (short circuit current density) of 20.71 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.02 V and a FF of 0.64, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 13.5% under standard AM 1.5 sunlight. More importantly, 87% of the cells showed efficiencies greater than 12%. For devices in group B, part of them can generate high efficiencies even up to 14% but efficiencies below 9% appeared frequently even when prepared under the same procedure. The efficiency distributions of both groups of devices are shown in Fig. 5c and summarized in Table 1. The average efficiency of group A (12.5%) is much higher than that of group B (9.7%), and the standard deviation of efficiency for group A (0.57) is significantly lower than that of group B (2.47), both of which reveal that the reproducibility of group A is greatly improved with respect to group B. In consideration of the same TiO2 and HTM layers used for the two groups of devices, the improved average efficiency and reproducibility of group A should be attributed to the optimized perovskite layer that fully converted perovskite with a mean distributed crystal size that can been maintained in different individual cells. As reported by H. J. Snaith and co-authors that planar-structured perovskite cells often give hysteresis in I–V curve measurements.26 In our research, DMSO-based and DMF-based perovskite solar cells showed a similar degree of hysteresis with a difference of 2–3% in the efficiency between the forward scan and reversed scan. Now, the reason for the hysteresis is still not very clear and the study on hysteresis is still undergoing in our group.

Conclusions
In summary, by inhibiting the crystallization of PbI2 we have successfully prepared highly reproducible perovskite films on a planar substrate via the sequential deposition method. Strong coordinative DMSO instead of DMF as the solvent for PbI2 resulted in extremely uniform and amorphous featured PbI2 films, which were fully converted to CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite crystals within 10 min. The resultant perovskite films showed a small distribution of crystal sizes and flat surface morphology. The highly reproducible perovskite films enabled reproducible planar-structured perovskite solar cells with the best efficiency of 13.5%, average efficiency of 12.5% and a small standard deviation of 0.57 from 120 specimens. The reproducible high performance devices provide a platform for in-depth device studies and the further optimization of photovoltaic performances. Moreover, the strategy of retarding the crystallization of precursor films is worth further study and can be applied to fabricating new perovskites as well as other planar substrates.
