    , Accepted 27th February 2017First published on 28th February 2017AbstractDithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) is used as a building block in several molecules having application in organic light emitting devices (OLED) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Delayed fluorescence (DF) is the preferred design principle employed currently in OLED research. DTBT has excellent delayed fluorescence properties which makes this moiety a potentially viable OLED material. Here, the dynamics of intersystem crossing (ISC) and reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) have been explored using fluorescence, phosphorescence, fluorescence lifetime and transient absorption measurements. Experimentally it is demonstrated that singlet and triplet states of DTBT are close lying or degenerate and after a certain time the molecules can stay in the singlet or the triplet state forming an equilibrium between the two states which hinders the identification of these two states that could be characterized by routine steady state fluorescence and phosphorescence studies. Similarly in OPV material research, DTBT is coupled with strong donors to form push–pull molecules to produce a prolonged charge separated state. In this study DTBT appended with carbazole at both ends (CDTBT) was used to study the dynamics of DTBT within a donor–acceptor–donor system. The study reveals similar kinds of ISC and RISC in CDTBT along with a competitive deactivation pathway of the singlet state and it was concluded to be through the formation of a charge separated species in CDTBT.
Introduction
Benzothiadiazole (BT), thiophene and carbazole are molecules being widely used to design OLED and OPV materials.1–3 The efficacy of dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) in optoelectronics is due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of benzothiadiazole which can be utilized in tuning the optical properties such as the absorption maxima, bandgap, and molecular orbital energy levels of the organic materials.4–7DTBT is a widely accepted OLED material especially because of its thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) property which can improve the quantum efficiency of the devices.8 TADF induced by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) due to energetically close-lying singlet and triplet states has become an important approach for the synthesis of new OLED materials with high efficiency,9–16 and several design principles are being developed to improve the efficiency of TADF.17–24 The absorption spectra of DTBT and bis-methyl substituted DTBT (Me-DTBT) typically consist of an intense band at a lower wavelength (∼300 nm) and a less intense broad peak centered at ∼450 nm.25,26 The fluorescence emission maxima are reported between 550 and 620 nm depending on the polarity of the solvent used.25,26 The fluorescence quantum yield of DTBT is inversely proportional to the quantum yield of the triplet state which implies a decrease in the triplet molecules because reverse intersystem crossing improves the fluorescence quantum yield of the singlet species.25 Despite a large number of literature studies on DTBT, proper characterization of the lowest singlet and triplet states of DTBT has been massively overlooked so far. Nanosecond transient absorption measurements of DTBT show a very weak transient absorption signal in deoxygenated THF due to the low triplet yield.25 Flash photolysis at 355 nm was used to measure the transient triplet–triplet absorption spectra of Me-DTBT26 which showed depletion of the ground state absorption at shorter wavelengths (∼300–400 nm) and a broad transient absorption band at longer wavelengths (∼450 to 700 nm). The triplet lifetime was estimated to be 3.38 μs and the fluorescence lifetime measured using a pico and nanosecond TCSPC method was 10.8 ns in methylcyclohexane.26
Push–pull molecules having donor moieties attached to DTBT are synthesised for application in polymer and small molecule organic semiconductors.27–30 A polymer of carbazole attached dithienyl benzothiadiazole having a bandgap of 1.97 eV and 0.6 eV difference in the LUMO levels of the molecule and the standard acceptor PCBM was reported as a promising donor molecule for application in solar cells.31,32 Carbazole–thiophene–benzothiadiazole copolymer (PCDTBT) showed good charge transfer properties when used with PCBM.33,34 Fluorescence up-conversion studies of PCDTBT in chlorobenzene at 500 nm excitation shows four lifetime components, 0.4 ps, 4.4 ps, 49.6 ps and 3.4 ns.35 The shorter components were ascribed to the relaxation processes and the longer components to the decay of the relaxed excited state.35 Parmasivam et al. reported a small donor molecule with carbazole attached to dithienyl benzothiadiazole with a D–π–A–π–D architecture using benzothiadiazole as the central acceptor unit, fluorene or thiophene as a π-spacer and carbazole or benzocarbazole as a donor. In a primary device fabrication study carried out with the molecule, CDTBT gave the highest power efficiency.36
In this paper the ultrafast dynamics of the small molecules DTBT and CDTBT have been investigated. It is demonstrated that for DTBT an accurate measurement of pure singlet and triplet state lifetimes is very critical (complex) due to the very fast equilibrium between S1 and T1. In the carbazole derivative CDTBT, despite the photoinduced charge transfer from carbazole to the singlet state of DTBT, similar degenerate singlet and triplet states were also observed. Transient absorption spectroscopy with a resolution higher than the S1 and T1 equilibrium dynamics is the most direct and unambiguous way to identify the nature of excited state species. In this work femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the relaxation of singlet and triplet states along with the equilibrium dynamics of degenerate S1 and T1 states of DTBT and CDTBT.
Materials and methods
Synthesis

BT, DTBT and CDTBT (Scheme 1) were synthesised using reported procedures36–38 and the details are given in the ESI.†
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of the molecules studied in this work. 
Steady state measurements
UV-Vis measurements were carried out on a Cary Series UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer, Agilent Technologies. Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer, with excitation and emission slits at 2.5 nm. Phosphorescence measurements were carried out using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog 3 Spectrofluorometer. UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence measurements were carried out in hexane, chloroform and acetonitrile. Phosphorescence spectra were recorded in a nitrogen purged 1:1 ethanol:methanol mixture which formed glass at 77 K (liquid nitrogen). All solvents used in this study were of HPLC grade. The solvents were purchased from Merck, India and were used without any further purification. The samples were dissolved at 1 × 10−3 M concentration in chloroform and diluted in the respective solvents to obtain the final concentration of 1 × 10−5 M in the cuvettes. The experiments were repeated at least on three different days with freshly prepared samples each time. The results were reproducible and the data shown is a representative set.
Time-resolved measurements
Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) was used to measure the fluorescence lifetime in the nanosecond time scale. The femtosecond pulses at 8 MHz repetition rate were obtained from a fractional part of the MaiTai output passing through a femtosecond Pulse Selector (3980-5S, Spectra Physics). The excitation pulses at 400 nm were generated by frequency doubling the 800 nm Ti:sapphire output with a 0.5 mm BBO crystal. The excitation pulses were focused on the sample using a fluorescence up-conversion setup (FOG100 system, CDP Systems). The time distribution data for fluorescence intensity were recorded on a SPC-130 TCSPC module (Becker & Hickl). The instrument response function was 250 ps.
Transient absorption studies were performed using a pump–probe using CDP Systems Corporation, ExciPro as described elsewhere. The output of the optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS prime) was used as a pump source at the required wavelength and fed into the spectrometer through a synchronized chopper at 1 kHz repetition rate. A lens (f = 200 mm) was used to adjust the pump diameter, while an iris and neutral density filter combination was used to adjust the pump energy. A Berek's variable wave plate was placed in the pump beam, and polarization was fixed at a magic angle with respect to the probe pulse. A part of the output of the Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace, Spectra Physics) with 1 kHz repetition rate and 100 mW average power at 800 nm was fed to the spectrometer. The power of the 800 nm beam was reduced to 20–25 mW using a neutral density filter and focused onto a thin rotating (2 mm) CaF2 crystal window to generate a white-light continuum. A fraction of this 800 nm beam was sent to a photodetector, which controls the speed and phase of the chopper rotation. The beam of white light was collimated with a parabolic mirror (f = 50 mm, 90°). Then this white light was reflected from a beam splitter and a mirror into two identical probe and reference beams. Two concave mirrors (f = 150 mm) were used to focus both probe and reference beams to the rotating sample cell. Two lenses (f = 60 mm) made probe and reference images at the entrance surfaces of two optical fibers, which are connected to the entrance slit of the imaging spectrometer (CDP2022i). This spectrometer consists of UV-Vis photodiode (Si linear photodiode) arrays and IR photodiode (GaAs linear photodiode) arrays in a spectral response range 200–1000 and 900–1700 nm, respectively. Quartz cells of 1 mm sample path length were used for all studies, and an IRF was estimated to be ≤150 fs. For sub-picosecond dynamics, a signal from a solvent system was recorded under the same experimental conditions and placed in respective figures in the text for comparison, where overlapping of the solvent induced transient with the transient signal from the sample is substantial. However, to minimize the solvent signal, pump pulse energy was kept below 3 μJ s−1 and probe pulse energy was from 0.1 to 0.5 μJ at the sample. For transient absorption spectra the group velocity dispersion compensation of the white light continuum (probe beam) was done using the studied solvent's two-photon absorption data for different picosecond delays.
The transient absorption spectra were fitted using the R-package TIMP software39 with the graphical interface Glotaran.40 Data were initially fitted using the global analysis component of the software. Global analysis fitting was carried out using a sequential model where the formation or decay of different excited state species occurs sequentially. The number of independent fitting components or exponentials is increased gradually to obtain effectively zero residuals. To obtain the spectra and kinetics of the different components within the transient absorption spectra SVD analysis was carried out for a set of temporal evolutions of the TA spectra to generate evolution associated spectra (EAS). The samples used for lifetime and transient measurements were prepared similar to the samples used for steady state measurements. Transient absorption measurements were carried out at 2 × 10−5 M concentrations.
Time resolved phosphorescence measurements were carried out in a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer using a flash lamp with 0.06 ms delay after flash at RT.
Results and discussion
The UV-absorption spectrum of benzothiadiazole (BT) is structured with maxima at 303 and 310 nm (ESI†). The molecule showed good optical density but weak fluorescence emission (ESI†). The observed emission at λmax = 400 nm did not undergo significant changes on changing the solvent polarity. The quantum yield of BT in hexane, chloroform and acetonitrile was calculated using anthracene as a standard and BT was found to be weakly fluorescent with a quantum yield of 0.03 in solvents of different polarities.
Due to the very low fluorescence quantum yield compared to good absorption, phosphorescence measurements of BT at 77 K were carried out. BT shows phosphorescence emission at ∼550 nm with a phosphorescence lifetime of 33 ms indicating an intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state (Fig. 1). Two thiophenes were attached to BT in order to obtain DTBT (4,7-di-2′-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole). DTBT shows a structure-less absorption spectrum with one peak centred at 300 nm similar to that observed for BT and an additional band at 450 nm (ESI†). The appearance of the 450 nm peak may be attributed to charge delocalisation and increased π-conjugation in the molecule due to the addition of thiophene. No significant wavelength shift was observed in the absorption spectra of DTBT on changing the solvent polarity. DTBT is highly fluorescent which is evident in the manifold increase in the fluorescence intensity in comparison to BT (Fig. 2). The emission maxima of DTBT in hexane, chloroform and acetonitrile are 530, 565 and 575 nm respectively. The red shift with a concomitant decrease in the fluorescence intensity with increasing solvent polarity clearly indicates charge delocalisation within the molecule brought about by the thiophene moieties. Compared to BT there was a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield of DTBT (Table 1). The fluorescence quantum yield of DTBT is relatively high in hexane and it decreases considerably in chloroform and acetonitrile. This decrease can be attributed to the charge delocalisation in the molecule in the excited state. However a significant decrease in the quantum yield accompanied by ∼75 nm red shift in the emission spectra of polar solvents could be indicative of a charge transfer state.

The absorption spectra of CDTBT appear similar to DTBT with a ∼50 nm red shift indicating the charge transfer nature of this donor–acceptor molecule in all solvents. The fluorescence spectra of CDTBT in hexane, chloroform and acetonitrile are red-shifted when compared to DTBT and the magnitude of the shift increases with increasing solvent polarity. An 85 nm shift on adding carbazole (CDTBT) to DTBT was observed in hexane, 95 nm in chloroform and 100 nm in acetonitrile. The decrease in fluorescence quantum yields on adding the donor carbazole confirms the charge transfer nature of the molecules.
The quantum yield of DTBT and CDTBT decreases with an increase in solvent polarity in agreement with the red-shifted spectra observed in solvents of higher polarity. Phosphorescence measurements at 77 K were also carried out for DTBT and CDTBT (Fig. 3). The peak at 550 nm observed in BT could not be observed in these molecules.

The phosphorescence peak observed was exactly overlapping with the fluorescence spectra. In E-type delayed fluorescence the populations of the singlet and triplet states are in thermal equilibrium and so the emission wavelength and lifetimes of delayed fluorescence and the concomitant phosphorescence are close (or not equal). The singlet and triplet energy difference, ΔEST, can be calculated from the onset of fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra. A very small ΔEST value can be obtained in donor–acceptor systems due to the energetically lower charge transfer states. A small ΔEST promotes delayed fluorescence via reverse intersystem crossing from triplet to singlet states. In DTBT the PH and PF emissions are very close indicating that ΔEST tends to be zero as reported in the literature for other DF molecules used in OLEDs.41 Further evidence of the negligible ΔEST value perhaps can be obtained using theoretical calculations and is planned to be explored soon. However, this observation is in accordance with the delayed fluorescence reported for the naphthyl-phenyl derivatives of DTBT elsewhere.8 The PH spectrum of CDTBT in hexane has lower intensity (almost half) than DTBT. In chloroform and acetonitrile CDTBT PH is significantly (almost 10 times) lower than DTBT indicating a possibility of alternate pathways in CDTBT relaxation to the ground state. It is very difficult to accurately assign this emission to the triplet or singlet species as the two states are degenerate which is demonstrated by the onset of the emissions (Fig. 3) and it may be perceived that the emission is due to a mixture of both the triplet and singlet emitting species simultaneously in the form of PF, PH and DF.
Earlier literature on DTBT derivatives shows that at 77 K the phosphorescence signal could not be detected26 and it was argued to be due to high fluorescence quantum yield or enhancement of non-radiative decay. The excited state fluorescence lifetimes of DTBT and CDTBT in chloroform were recorded using a time correlated single photon counting method (Fig. 4). Decays could be fitted biexponentially and the average fluorescence lifetimes are listed in Table 1.

The inset shows the kinetics of PH. Black lines running through the decays indicate the fitting of the data. 
The fluorescence lifetime of DTBT in hexane is ∼10 ns which increased with the solvent polarity (Table 1). Surprisingly, the fluorescence lifetime increases with polarity and the quantum yield remains constant on increasing the solvent polarity. An earlier report on Me-DTBT shows a decrease in the fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield on changing the solvent polarity from methylcyclohexane to ethanol.26 The extremely different behaviour in DTBT and Me-DTBT can be explained by the presence of 2 methyl groups which are known to significantly change the properties of an optical molecule.42,43 Some of the reported changes in the photophysical properties due to the addition of methyl groups are increase in the delayed fluorescence lifetime and decrease in the delayed fluorescence intensity in toluene for dibenzothiophene–phenothiazine molecules.44 The peak positions of fluorescence and phosphorescence for Me-DTBT are reported to be 565 and 520 nm respectively.26
The fluorescence lifetime of CDTBT is reduced to 3.74 ns in hexane which further reduces in chloroform and acetonitrile. The decrease in fluorescence intensity of CDTBT in comparison to DTBT with increasing polarity is an indicator of the stable charge transfer state. In order to confirm delayed fluorescence, the lifetime measurements at room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature were compared (Fig. 5). The biexponential fitting of DTBT at RT gives short components of 2.18 ns and 13.9 ns. The shorter lived component has a small amplitude (13.5%) when compared to the longer component (89.3%). At 77 K the fluorescence lifetimes of the two components remain almost the same at 2.35 ns and 11 ns. The amplitude of the shorter component is significantly increased to 38.4% at 77 K with a concomitant decrease in the amplitude of the longer component (65.6%) This short component may thus be assigned to the prompt fluorescence emission, and the origin of the longer component may be due to the contributions from DF. Unlike DTBT, temperature dependent decay of CDTBT hardly brings any observable change and the lifetime remains constant at 3.5 ns. These results point to the fact that in DTBT the singlet and triplet states are very close-lying whereas in CDTBT they are completely degenerate.
 Fig. 5  (a) Fluorescence lifetime profiles of (a) DTBT and (b) CDTBT at RT and 77 K. Black lines running through the decays indicate the fitting of the data. The decays of DTBT and CDTBT were collected at λex = 400 nm, λem = 565 and λex = 390 nm, λem = 655 respectively. 
To understand the respective formation and decay of the individual species transient absorption measurements were carried out for DTBT and CDTBT in acetonitrile. Fig. 6 shows a typical time evolution of TA spectra of DTBT in acetonitrile upon excitation at 350 nm. Immediately after excitation a positive peak appeared at 465 nm and then with time this band diminishes with a concomitant increase of two bands at 510 nm and above 650 nm along with ground state bleaching and stimulated emission at 450 and 570 nm, respectively (Fig. 6). Finally, at a longer time the stimulated emission band intensity increases at 570 nm abruptly and stays for a long time. The time profiles of these bands are shown in Fig. 6(b–e) in four different time windows. In a 2 ps time window, the decay of the initial 465 nm band nicely corroborates with the rise of 510 and 650 nm bands and the characteristic time was found to be 300 fs. This 465 nm excited state absorption (ESA) band can be attributed to Sn ← S2, and the lifetime of S2 was found to be ∼300 fs. The time profile of 510 and 650 nm shows a complex nature. In 50 and 500 ps time domains they show another rise component of 20 ps time constant followed by a very slow decay. Hence, these 510 and 650 nm bands can be assigned to Sn ← S1 transitions. Upon S2 excitation at 350 nm the molecules undergo internal conversion in a 300 fs time scale and give rise to the population of the hot S1 state which later relaxed to S1 with a time constant of 33 ps. Finally both the bands start decaying appreciably after 1 ns which is accompanied by the sudden increase in stimulated emission (SE) resulting from the delayed fluorescence emission owing to the reverse intersystem crossing or phosphorescence. As is seen in steady state studies that prompt fluorescence, delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence have exactly identical spectra due to the degenerate thermally relaxed S1 and T1 states; it is almost impossible to spectrally distinguish these three entities. However, the sudden increase in the negative signal in the fluorescence emission region in transient absorption spectra definitely tells about the intersystem crossing time scale. The whole TA spectra are dominated by a strong negative signal in-between 500 and 650 nm and the time profile at 650 nm in the 6 ns time domain is non-exponential in nature. A component with ∼1.5 ns of characteristic rise time can be extracted from this time profile followed by a very slow decay with approximately 5–6 ns of time constant. The observed rise time of 1.5 ns can probably be assigned to the reverse intersystem crossing time (or rise of delayed fluorescence) and 5–6 ns of decay time can be attributed to the decay of degenerate S1 and T1 states.

Due to a very intense negative signal at longer time scales the positive signals in the studied spectral window could apparently not be observed. On careful inspection a positive band at ∼500 nm can be observed (Fig. 6). This band is in accordance with the broad transient emission (∼450 to 700 nm) observed by Pina et al. (2013) in microsecond time scales which was assigned to the Tn ← T1 absorption.45
Due to the non-exponential nature of the time evolution of TA spectra especially in the longer time scale, global and target analysis could not be carried out. Nevertheless, the 3D surface plot of the TA spectra help to clearly visualise the time evolution of transient absorption spectra (Fig. 7), where after ∼1 ns a sharp trough pertaining to SE could be observed and it persists for a long time that is beyond our instrument delay time limit.
 Fig. 7  (a) 3D surface plot of TA spectra of DTBT in acetonitrile. The x-axis represents the wavelength, the y-axis represents the time in femtoseconds (linear scale) and the z-axis represents ΔOD and (b) heatmap of ΔOD observed in the TA spectra of DTBT indicated as a colour map. Zero level is coloured in light green, yellow to dark red indicates positive signals (i.e., photoinduced absorption), and blue denotes negative signals (i.e., decrease in absorption due to stimulated emission and/or ground-state photobleaching). 
Hence, TA data could clearly mark the identity of a pure singlet state up to 500 ps to 1000 ps in DTBT (Fig. 7). After this time window the molecule loses its spin identity due to degenerate lowest singlet and triplet states and this molecule does not require thermal activation for the triplet to singlet cross-over as observed in several TADF molecules. As a result, the pure singlet lifetime measured by the TCSPC method and the pure triplet lifetime measured using a phosphorimeter may get overestimated or underestimated, respectively.
Transient absorption spectra of CDTBT in different time delays are shown in Fig. 7(a). A strong negative signal at 525 nm due to ground state bleaching dominates the spectral region with excited state absorption below 450 nm and above 580 nm.
On carrying out global fitting using a sequential model, it is observed that the transient absorption spectra in the small time scale show a negative signal due to ground state bleaching (Fig. 8). The fluorescence emission of CDTBT is in-between 550 to 650 nm and a negative signal is observed up to 580 nm. At longer wavelengths the signal is positive and can be attributed to the S1 to Sn transition. Following this, evolution of a positive signal is observed between 510 and 540 which starts decaying after ∼3 ns (Fig. 8c) and the signal looks typically like the initial spectra with a slight red-shift which may be attributed to the appearance of the delayed fluorescence due to RISC in CDTBT. In support of the expected photoinduced charge transfer in the push–pull system CDTBT, evidence of excited state spectra arising from the formation of radical ions could not be observed per se due to the overlap of ground state absorption in the region studied. However, global analysis of transient data based on singular value decomposition using a sequential model implemented in Glotaran39,40 extracts the spectra and lifetime of each state as shown in Scheme 2. The spectra associated with the CT state (EAS3) consist of a positive peak at 540 nm (Fig. 8). This peak can be assigned to the carbazole cation peak as reported earlier for the carbazole–anthracene molecule.46 The lifetime of the so-obtained carbazole cation in acetonitrile was found to be between ∼5 and 10 ns. Although the exact rate of formation of the CT state yielding the carbazole cation could not be established from the sequential fitting model, it can be assumed that the CT formation will be close to the inverse of the fluorescence lifetime i.e. ∼2.2 ns. In view of the degenerate singlet and triplet energy levels in DTBT and the overlapping of prompt and delayed fluorescence it can be ensured that the S1, T1 and CT states in CDTBT are also energetically very close to each other. Due to the degenerate nature of S1 and T1, equilibrium between the triplet and the singlet states exists resulting in delayed fluorescence in CDTBT. At this point it is also important to note that the fluorescence lifetime of CDTBT measured using TCSPC does not get perturbed as observed for DTBT, and is in accordance with the singlet lifetime obtained from transient studies which may be due to less efficient RISC.

The most interesting observation in this study was the observation of the singlet to triplet to singlet conversion taking place within a few nanoseconds (Scheme 2). However, this is not the first report on very fast ISC and RISC, and several organic molecules have been reported earlier. Singlet and triplet states staying in equilibrium at room temperature have been observed earlier in aryl carbenes.47 Fluorenylidene in particular has a small singlet–triplet energy separation in cyclohexane and the spin flip from singlet to triplet (ISC) was reported to occur in 100 ps and the equilibrium between the two states was established within 500 ps.47 The fast rate of intersystem crossing from the singlet excited state of pyrimidine derivatives is well reported.48–52 The rate of ISC in 5-methyl-2 hydroxypyrimidine is 2 × 1010 s−1.53 Rapid triplet formation in perylenediimide-β-apocarotene takes place in less than 50 ps.54 Using ultrafast spectroscopy studies ISC was found to occur in 4.3 ps and RISC in 14.6 ps in triphenylphosphine oxide derivatives.55 A fast equilibrium between S1 and T1 is established when interconversion between the singlet and triplet states occurs several times before decay takes place through emission or non-radiative pathways.56 Due to this equilibrium the singlet lifetime gets overestimated as observed by the lifetime measurements by the TCSPC method of DTBT, and the millisecond lifetime of the triplet emission observed in benzothiadiazole is reduced to a few microseconds in DTBT and CDTBT.
Conclusions
In summary, it was demonstrated that DTBT possesses degenerate singlet and triplet states which makes it a strong photoluminescent molecule having exactly similar PF and DF spectra. The formation of another degenerate state in the form of a charge transfer state in CDTBT may lead to slow charge recombination rates which give good efficiency in solar cell devices reported by our group.36 The DF occurs in the molecule due to barrier-less triplet to singlet crossover that does not require any thermal activation. In such a situation measurement of the singlet state lifetime by the time correlated single photon counting method and the triplet state lifetime using a phosphorimeter with a microsecond time resolution is perturbed due to easy to and fro intersystem crossing. Femtosecond TA studies identify that the molecule retains its singlet identity up to 500–1000 ps. These results provide an insight into the poorly understood ultrafast photodynamics of DTBT and may form the basis for a well-informed design principle of optoelectronic molecules utilising this core moiety.
