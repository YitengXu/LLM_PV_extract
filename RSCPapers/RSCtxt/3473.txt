    , Accepted 30th August 2016First published on 15th September 2016AbstractLow-cost inorganic copper iodide (CuI) is introduced as a potential oxidizer for hole-transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Characterization of oxidizability and energy levels indicates that the CuI can effectively oxidize spiro-MeOTAD. Through solvent engineering and concentration optimization, the CuI (20% mole ratio) doped spiro-MeOTAD gives higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than that of the FK209 dopant. This work shows the promise of a state-of-the-art method using a low-cost dopant for hole transport material in perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a hot research topic because of their quickly increased performance and cost-effective fabrication technology.1–3 In principle, carriers are created in the perovskite after absorption of incident photons, and travel through transport pathways, including the electron or hole transport layer.4 Good hole transport materials (HTM) having efficient hole transport properties that do not affect the perovskite crystals are critically important to achieve high performance in PSCs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been enhanced from 3.8% to 19.3% using organic spiro-MeOTAD rather than liquid electrolyte in PSCs.5–7 However, there are still some obstacles to use of spiro-MeOTAD-based HTM. The hole mobility and the conductivity of spiro-MeOTAD without doping are very low (just 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 10−5 S cm−2, respectively), which is detrimental to performance of the PSC.6,7 Doping tBP and Li-TFSI to spiro-MeOTAD have resulted in good performance. The tBP can effectively restrain the charge recombination, while the Li-TFSI allows increment in carrier density and energy level shifts in the hole transport layer of spiro-MeOTAD.8–11 It is noted that the Li-TFSI is used as a catalyst to oxidize spiro-MeOTAD with oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere, making it difficult to control the degree of oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD. In attempts to control this oxidization, AgTFSI,12,13 cobalt compounds9,14–17 and SnCl418–21 have been added to spiro-MeOTAD to achieve good power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, most of the added oxidizers are organic, and require acetonitrile as a solvent, which can destroy the perovskite crystals structure. Furthermore, these oxidizers are generally expensive, owing to complicated preparation procedures and high purity requirements. Therefore, there is research interest in development of alternative HTM or oxidizers with low cost.
Previously, inorganic CuI has been employed as a HTM in fabrication of PSCs, which show pretty good efficiency compared with spiro-MeOTAD-based HTM.25 As a potential inorganic HTM, CuI allows for high hole mobility and is quite low cost.22,23 Rather than using the CuI as HTM in PSC, this study reports the use of cost-effective CuI as inorganic oxidizer for doped spiro-MeOTAD in PSCs. The CuI can be dissolved in chlorobenzene with a little di-n-propyl sulfide,23–26 with minimum influence on the perovskite film compared with the influence of acetonitrile. The oxidization property of CuI for spiro-MeOTAD HTM is proved to be effective. Through solvent and concentration engineering, the CuI (mole ratio of 20%) doped spiro-MeOTAD yields the best PCE of 12.8% in air atmosphere (0.983 Sun, AM1.5), which is higher than that achieved using the FK209 dopant.
2. Experiment section
The perovskite solar cells in this study have a mesoporous perovskite solar cell structure: FTO/bilayer TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Ag, with the perovskite layer formed by a one-step deposition method according to the literature.27–30 Three types of HTM were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere: (1) spiro-MeOTAD + Li: 60 mM spiro-MeOTAD in chlorobenzene with 80 mol% tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and 30 mol% of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) in acetonitrile; (2) spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co: 300 mg tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris-(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209) was dissolved in 1 ml acetonitrile, then added to spiro-MeOTAD + Li with 10% mole radio; (3) spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu: 0.5–1.0 M CuI was dissolved in chlorobenzene/di-n-propyl sulfide (0.2–2.5% vol% to chlorobenzene), then this was added to spiro-MeOTAD + Li to obtain CuI doped HTM with molar ratio CuI: spiro-MeOTAD = 10, 20, 50, 70 and 100%.
Multiple filtering was performed before use. All the experiments were performed under the same conditions, including the preparation process, testing environment and testing conditions.
Current–voltage (I–V) curves were recorded using a 2400 system source meter (Keithley) together with a sunlight simulator (Newport, AM 1.5, 98.3 mW cm−2) calibrated with a standard Si cell. The active area of the solar cells was defined as 0.07 cm2 by a black aperture. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured using a three-electrode system, using freshly distilled 1,2-dichlorobenzene with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as electrolyte (ESI 1†).31,32 UV-vis absorption spectra were conducted by a Cray 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of the Sb-X% films on glasses was checked by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA) using 532 nm incident light for excitation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Germany).
3. Results and discussion
During the experimental process, the color of the spiro-MeOTAD + Li solution gradually changed from light yellow to pink with no precipitation. The color of the spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co solution changed from light yellow to dark purple quickly and without precipitation as a result of Co3+ being reduced to Co2+. When CuI and Li-TFSI were add to spiro-MeOTAD, precipitation was generated in 1 h, and the color changed to claret (ESI 2†). Increasing the concentration of CuI doped spiro-MeOTAD caused the solution color to deepen with more precipitation generated. The precipitation did not dissolve in organic solvents or water. The composition of the filtered precipitation was analyzed to be Cu, as indicated in ESI 3.† Thus, it is deduced that oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD occurs as follows:  
Earlier reports emphasized that in the presence of p-type dopants, such as the Co(III) complex, spiro-MeOTAD reduces the Co(III) to Co(II) and itself is simultaneously oxidized to mono-cation radical spiro-MeOTAD (spiro-MeOTAD+), as illustrated by formation of new absorption peaks in the visible region.14 In the present study, the absorption spectra rose from 430 nm to 750 nm and an evident absorption peak appeared at 523 nm when CuI or FK209 were added to the spiro-MeOTAD solution (Fig. 1(a)). By comparison, the spiro-MeOTAD + Li and CuI doped spiro-MeOTAD without Li-TFSI (dark line in Fig. 1(b)) had almost no absorption peak over 450 nm. Thus, the absorption peak can be attributed to the presence of the mono-cation radical spiro-MeOTAD+ generated by charge transfer between host and dopant. Formation of the cation radical reveals the effective oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD by CuI, which is believed to create additional charge holes leading to increased charge carrier density. The UV-vis absorption peak of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu in Fig. 1(a) is higher than that of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co. Moreover, the height of the oxidization peak in Fig. 1(b), corresponding to the concentration of oxidized spiro-MeOTAD, improves approximately linearly with enhanced content of CuI. This observation suggests that the degree of oxidation can be controlled by changing the content of CuI. In all, the CuI has stronger ability to oxidize spiro-MeOTAD than does FK209, allowing control of degree of oxidation, and the oxidation process is independent on ambient air. Therefore, the CuI may accept electrons from spiro-MeOTAD and form a charge transfer complex in the solid film, resulting in spiro-MeOTAD with effective hole transport capacity, and in this reaction Li-TFSI acts as a catalyst.

CV was used to investigate the energy states of the spiro-MeOTAD with different additives, as shown in Fig. 1(c). It is clear that the oxidation peak is reduced by CuI, when compared with spiro-MeOTAD + Li. The oxidation peak of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu is similar to that of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co. The optical band gap (Eg) was calculated from the UV-vis measurements (Eg = hc/λonset) (Table 1). The EHOMO are derived from the onset oxidation potential, whereas the ELUMO are determined by ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg. The calculated Eg, EHOMO and ELUMO are shown in Fig. 1(d). The calculated EHOMO of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu is −5.23 eV, more negative than the −5.19 eV of spiro-MeOTAD + Li and similar to the −5.22 eV of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co. The band alignment shown in Fig. 1(d) in TiO2, CH3NH3PbI3, and spiro-MeOTAD doped by those three additives is energetically favorable for exaction dissociation and charge transfer at the interface. Hence, a driving force may be generated for hole transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 into the spiro-MeOTAD, explaining why the spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu achieves good PCE.

The optimal concentration of CuI for HTM was studied. The average PCS device performance parameters in air atmosphere as a function of the CuI concentration are shown in Fig. 2. Increasing the CuI doped concentration from 10% to 100%, the Voc first increases from 750 mV to 910 mV on addition of 20% CuI then, surprisingly, decreases to 720 mV when the doping ratio is further raised to 100% (Fig. 2(a)); the addition of CuI initially increases the Jsc from 20.2 mA cm−2 (10% CuI) to 21.4 mA cm−2 (20% CuI), followed by decrease to 18.5 mA cm−2 at the highest doping level (100% CuI) (Fig. 2(b)); the FF has no obvious change. Therefore, the average PCE first rises to 10.5% at CuI doping concentration of 20%, then decreases (Fig. 2(d)). Increasing the oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD by CuI, causes increment in performance to be achieved. With excess CuI, the decreased performance may be ascribed to higher hole density in the spiro-MeOTAD film, which leads to increased recombination between holes and conduction band electrons in perovskite.17 From the following equitation: , where fmax is the maximum frequency in the highest virtual step impedance (impedance measurement of three different CuI doped concentrations over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz under 0.983 Sun, AM1.5 illumination, perturbation 10 mA, as shown in ESI 5†). Here the fmax,10%doped < fmax,50%doped < fmax,100%doped, so the τe,10%doped > τe,50%doped > τe,100%doped. The increase in fmax for 10%, 50%, and 100% doped corresponds to a shorter electron lifetime, implying a higher charge recombination rate. Therefore, increasing the concentration of CuI doped will reduce the Voc.

To further illustrate the effects of spiro-MeOTAD + Li, spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co and spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu on charge collection efficiency, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite-based solar cells with different HTM are shown in Fig. 3(a). The PL quenching indicates that the photon-generated carriers transfer to the anode from the perovskite layer.33 The spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu exhibits the lowest PL spectra intensity, indicating that the CuI oxidizes the spiro-MeOTAD effectively and improves charge collection efficiency in the devices.
 Fig. 3  PL measurements of different HTM (a), J–V characteristics (b), IPCE spectra (c), and power conversion efficiencies of PSCs after 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h (d). 
The three devices were stored in air and dry atmosphere for over 6 h to achieve optimal efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the highest PCE is 12.8% with Jsc of 22.65 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.96 V, and FF of 58% of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu, which can be ascribed to efficient oxidation of the spiro-MeOTAD by CuI. The spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu outperforms the spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co device, with one reason being the better oxidation property of CuI. In addition, FK209 was dissolved in acetonitrile to dope the HTM, which may damage the perovskite crystal and is unfavorable for device performance. By contrast, the CuI was dissolved in dipropyl sulfide to dope HTM, which keeps the perovskite crystal complete (details given in ESI 4†). The IPCE spectra, which are consistent with the Jsc values of the devices, also show significant improvement of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu, as exhibited in Fig. 3(c). The effective oxidation property of CuI is indicated by the fast stabilized device performance in Fig. 3(d). Although the spiro-MeOTAD + Li shows optimal efficiency of 11.89% with Jsc of 21.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.97 V, and FF of 55%, it requires a relatively long time for the spiro-MeOTAD + Li to be oxidized. The average PCE varied greatly during prolonged oxidation time (0, 6, 12 and 24 h) in air, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The Li-TFSI doped spiro-MeOTAD had relatively low PCE at about 0 h (3.34%), because there was not enough time to oxidize the spiro-MeOTAD. The PCE increased greatly with prolonged time, with a maximal average performance of 9.48% at about 12 h, because the spiro-MeOTAD had been oxidized. However, the devices may be partially decomposed in a wet environment without encapsulation, which leads to a smaller average PCE (9.23%) at 24 h. Thus, the performance of spiro-MeOTAD + Li is varied a lot by air. That is to say, the oxidation process of Li-TFSI doped spiro-MeOTAD is uncontrolled. By contrast, the spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co and spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu achieved good PCE at 0 h, because the spiro-MeOTAD was immediately oxidized by FK209 and CuI, respectively. Notably, the spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu exhibits better performance than spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co, perhaps because CuI has better oxidation property than FK209 and the destruction of the perovskite is minimized by di-n-propyl sulfide with CuI doping than FK209 doping. Both the merits of CuI doping guarantee efficient electron transport between perovskite and HTM.
To further prove that the PCE of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu is better than that of other HTM, EIS studies were conducted. These studies can be used to reveal underlying carrier transport behavior in perovskite solar cells.34Fig. 4 shows the EIS of PSCs with different HTM over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz under 0.983 Sun, AM1.5 illumination, 10 mV perturbation. There are usually two arcs in the spectra with the left one ascribed to the contact resistance at the HTM/Ag electrode and the right one (lower frequency one) to the transport resistance (R) and chemical capacitance (C) of the system.25 Although the left arc is hard to resolve, the diameter change of the arcs can be found, which reflects the transport resistance of the solar cell. The diameter of the arc for spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu is the smallest of the three HTM in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 4). Therefore, the transport resistance of the device can be significantly reduced as the CuI doping can effectively oxidize spiro-MeOTAD and improve the hole transport ability of spiro-MeOTAD. The EIS spectra further prove that the oxidation property of the CuI effectively improves the performance of the PSCs.

4. Conclusions
This study reports use of cost-effective CuI as inorganic oxidizer for spiro-MeOTAD in PSCs. The CuI can be dissolved in chlorobenzene with a little di-n-propyl sulfide, which has smaller influence on the perovskite film compared with use of acetonitrile as a solvent. The oxidization property of CuI doped spiro-MeOTAD HTM is proven to be effective. CV shows that the spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu have a slightly changed energy level compared with spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Co, which is suitable for carrier transport. Concentration optimization of spiro-MeOTAD + Li + Cu (20% mole ratio of CuI) yielded the best PCE of 12.8%, higher than that achieved using FK209 dopant. This indicates effective oxidation of spiro-MeOTAD by the CuI. This work highlights the promise of a new state-of-the-art method for preparing high performance perovskite solar cells with low cost dopant.
