, Accepted 30th October 2015First published on 30th October 2015AbstractIn present study, a series of Zn, Mn co-doped titania (TiO2) photocatalysts with varying dopant concentrations (0.0, 1.0 and 2.0 at%) were synthesized via the sol–gel process. The co-doped photocatalysts were characterized using XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, Raman, FTIR and UV-vis DRS techniques, where methylene blue was used as a probe environmental pollutant. The photocatalytic performances of the synthesized photocatalysts were evaluated under very low (∼2 W) UV and visible power irradiation sources. Analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns suggests the multiphase structure of the photocatalyst, while XPS results demonstrate that in co-doped TiO2, the oxidation state of doped Zn metal ions is 2 (Zn2+), while Mn is in +2 and +3 (Mn2+/Mn3+) state. The optical study results reveal a red shift in the co-doped samples, where with an increase in co-dopant concentration, the band gap is reduced. The highest photocatalytic degradation of MB is obtained with 1.0 at% Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2, which is due to enhancement of light absorbance in the UV region caused by the additional impurity energy levels introduced in the bad-gap of TiO2 by the co-dopants. The as-synthesized 1.0 at% Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 provides a very high degradation efficiency (66.6 W−1 min−1) and thus may be practically used in the dye removal process efficiently.
1. Introduction
Recently, heterogeneous catalysts have shown great importance in many emerging fields, such as power conversion and storage, removal of pollutants, and synthesis of novel materials.1–4 Among these catalysts, titania (TiO2) based photocatalysts have attracted greater attention due to their high efficiency, nontoxicity, chemical inertness and high photostabilty.5,6 The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is based on the mechanism of the formation of electron/hole (e−/h+) pairs under the illumination of light. The e−/h+ pairs induced by these radiations initiate many chemical reactions by generating radical species on the surface of TiO2.7 However, due to high band gap (Eg = 3.2 eV), TiO2 can be stimulated only by UV light, which comprises only 4% of solar radiation.8 Moreover, during photocatalysis TiO2 shows a low quantum efficiency with a high recombination rate of e−/h+ pairs, and thereby reduces its applicability as an efficient photocatalyst.9 Therefore, to maximize the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, it is essential to reduce its band-gap, which eventually results in the enhancement of its sensitivity in the visible range of solar radiation.10 In view of this, a vast number of effective methods have been well explored in the past, which include doping with various metals and nonmetals or coupling with semiconductors.11 Among these methods, doping with transition metals reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated e−/h+ pairs in TiO2 and thereby shifts its optical response from the UV to visible spectral range.12–14 These doped metal cations temporarily trap the charge carriers and thus reduce the recombination probability of e−/h+ pairs during the photocatalysis process. Recently, the approach of doping TiO2 with more than one transitional metal ion has received considerable attention because it provides a finer control to the tuning of the band-gap. In addition, compared with single metal doping, it also improves the photocatalytic activity of the host material.15 Zhi et al. observed that as compared to pure or single doping, an optimum amount of Zn–Fe co-doping into TiO2 exhibits a twofold improvement in photocatalytic activity, which is attributed to the enriched electronic properties of TiO2 by the co-dopants.16 Another recent example has been demonstrated by Boningari et al., where they studied the effect of doping of different metals on Mn doped TiO2 for the catalytic reduction of NO with NH3.17 The authors have found the maximum catalytic degradation with Ni/Mn doped TiO2. It is found that the doping of transitional metals introduces new intrabands within the forbidden band gap of TiO2, which thereby narrows the band gap and subsequently improve the optical absorption of TiO2 in the UV and visible regions.18,19 Therefore, motivated by the need to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, herein the co-doping of Zn, Mn in TiO2 lattice is investigated. The transitional metal ions Zn and Mn are adopted as the co-dopants due to their striking compatibility with TiO2 for enhancing photocatalytic activity.19–21 Furthermore, the control of the amount of co-dopant ions into TiO2 lattice appears to be very important, because it decides the effectiveness of TiO2 for photocatalysis applications. Thus, for optimization of the proper distribution of co-dopants ions in TiO2, in present study, the co-doping of Zn and Mn in varying concentration is carried out using a simple sol–gel method because this process has been widely used for the incorporation of dopants into the TiO2 lattice. Subsequently, the effects of these co-dopants on the structural, optical and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the presence of UV, as well as in visible light irradiation are inspected. Herein, methylene blue (MB), an organic hazardous dye, is chosen as a model pollutant to explore the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. In addition, it is worth mentioning that in previous reports the photocatalytic activities of TiO2 based photocatalysts have been studied using high intensity irradiation sources, whose input powers vary between 20 and 1200 W. The use of such high power sources for photocatalytic degradation is neither energy efficient, nor commercially feasible. The catalytic performance using a very low intensity power source with intensity lower by at least two orders of magnitude has not been studied to the best of our knowledge. In view of this, instead of using intense power sources, the present study considers the use of a 2 W power source for the study of photocatalytic degradation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and method
Undoped and co-doped titanium oxide (Ti1−2xZnxMnxO2−2x) nanoparticles with x = 0.00 (undoped TiO2), 0.01 and 0.02 (Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2) were prepared by the sol–gel process. Titanium tetraisobutoxide (TTIB; Ti(OC4H9)4; Sigma-Aldrich), zinc nitrate (ZnNO3·6H2O; Loba) and manganous nitrate (Mn(NO3)2·6H2O; Loba) were used as the TiO2, Zn and Mn precursors, respectively. Ethanol (Merck; 99%) was used as the solvent, while HNO3 (Fischer Scientific; 98%) served as the peptizing agent. The detailed method for the preparation of TiO2 nanoparticles is mentioned elsewhere.22 In brief, 5 mL of TTIB was mixed with 12 mL of ethanol with vigorous stirring for 30 min to form solution A. Another solution (solution B) was prepared by mixing 0.9 mL HNO3 with 10 mL ethanol and 5 mL deionized water with vigorous stirring for 30 min. Furthermore, solution A was added dropwise to solution B at a rate of 0.25 mL min−1 with vigorous magnetic stirring. After mixing was complete, the resultant solution was stirred further for 30 min and maintained at room temperature for 24 h until the formation of a white gel. The prepared gel was dried at 100 °C for 10 h to remove volatile impurities and then grounded to obtain a powdered sample. Subsequently, further purification was carried out by centrifuging the powdered sample in ethanol for 2 h at 8000 rpm. Finally, the obtained powder was annealed at 500 °C for 4 h. The Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 (x = 0.01 and 0.02) powder was also prepared by a similar procedure. Here, another solution (solution C) was made by mixing desired amounts of ZnNO3·6H2O and Mn (NO3)2·6H2O with 5 mL ethanol with vigorous stirring for 30 min. Subsequently, solution C was added dropwise to solution A to form solution D, which was further added to solution B dropwise at a rate of 0.25 mL min−1. The subsequent steps were the same as those used to prepare the undoped TiO2. The co-doped TiO2 was also annealed at 500 °C. The description of the complete sol–gel experimental procedure is attached in the ESI (Fig. S1†). Hereafter, the annealed Ti1−xZnxMnxO2−x with x = 0.00, 0.01 and 0.02 are denoted as TP0, TP1 and TP2, respectively. To compare the effect of co-doping over single doping, Zn or Mn doped TiO2 samples, namely, Ti1−xZnxO2−x or Ti1−xMnxO2−x with x values of 0.01 (Zn1, Mn1) and 0.02 (Zn2, Mn2), were also prepared using a procedure similar to that adopted for the co-doped photocatalysts.
2.2 Photocatalysts characterization
The crystalline phase and variation in lattice constants of the undoped and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 were studied using X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8-Focus advance diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 1.5406 Å in the range of 20°–80° with a scanning rate of 1° min−1. Surface morphology was examined by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM, Model no.-Zeiss EVO MA-15) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI T12, operating voltage 120 V). The EDX elemental mapping of the photocatalyst was carried out by a JEOL, (JSM-6010LA) SEM. The chemical states of the co-doped nanoparticles were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), which were acquired using a PHI5000 (Versa ProbII, FEI Inc.) spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a LabRam Micro-Raman spectrometer (Jobin-Yuon HR 800 UV) using an He–Ne (632.8 nm) laser excitation source. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Bruker-FTIR instrument) was carried out using KBr pellets in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectral (UV-vis DRS) data were acquired on a (Varian Cary 500 Scan) UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating diffuse reflectance fixture in the range of 200–800 nm. The band gap of synthesized photocatalysts was calculated using Kubelka–Munk plots. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were obtained using an Edinburg Fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLSP 920) in the range of 385–600 nm at room temperature.
2.3 Evaluation of photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic activities of the undoped, single Zn, Mn doped and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 were evaluated using a 2 mM solution of MB in water as the active material. The photoactive Ti1−xZnxMnxO2−x was dispersed in an MB solution, where the concentration of the photocatalyst was kept constant at 62 mM for each sample. Prior to the photocatalytic experiment, the TiO2 dispersed MB solution was magnetically stirred in the dark for 30 min to attain adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the abovementioned solution was irradiated with UV and/or visible light with constant magnetic stirring. Commercial light emitting diode based light sources were used for both UV (λ = ∼360 nm, 2 W, Probtos LED) and visible light (λ > 400 nm, 2 W, DPLED) photoreactors. The wavelengths of the irradiation sources were measured by a high-resolution spectrophotometer (HR 4000; Ocean optics) with a wavelength range of 200–1100 nm. To study the degradation of MB with irradiation time, measured amounts of irradiated solution was collected at selected irradiation intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 h, respectively. Similar experiments were carried out with the Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2. The photodegradation of MB was investigated by measuring the absorbance of the collected MB solutions using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at λmax = ∼664 nm. The photodegradation of MB was determined by , where C0 (initial absorbance) and Ct are the concentrations of MB at time 0 and t, respectively. Subsequently, the photocatalytic activities of the photocatalyst were considered proportional to the relative degradation of MB.
3. Results and discussion
The phase structure and crystalline size of undoped and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2, annealed at 500 °C, were investigated by X-ray diffraction. As shown in Fig. 1A, multiphase TiO2 shows higher crystallinity with anatase as the prevailing phase along with a small fraction of rutile and brookite. The XRD patterns of the undoped and co-doped TiO2 indicate that the increasing amount of Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions inhibits the formation of other phases (brookite and rutile). This may be probably because of the suppressed crystallization of brookite and rutile phases due to the adsorption of Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions on the surface. Subsequently, TP1 and TP2 show clear peak broadening, which indicates their small crystalline size compared to TP0. The crystalline size of the phases in the synthesized photocatalysts was calculated by considering the FWHM values of anatase (200), rutile (110) and brookite (211) peaks (Table 1). The most intense peaks of anatase (101) and brookite (210) were not considered for this calculation, because these peaks were overlapped. The crystalline sizes (D) were calculated using the Scherrer formula: , where K is the shape factor (∼0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15418 nm), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the corresponding diffraction line and θ is the diffraction angle. It is worth noting that no other phases such as Zn, Mn rich oxides (ZnMnTiOx) are observed in the XRD patterns of the co-doped TiO2. The absence of such phases might be due to the small amount of co-dopants. This also indicates that the co-dopants, i.e., Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions, can replace Ti4+ from lattice sites (Fig. 1D).23 To confirm the Zn, Mn co-doping and to evaluate their effect on crystal structure, the lattice constants of the undoped and co-doped TiO2 were calculated using the relations  and  where dhkl is the interplanar distance with Miller indices h, k, and l, and a and c are the lattice constants. Fig. 1B shows the variation of lattice constants with different doping concentrations.

It is observed that with increasing co-doping concentrations, the value of lattice constant ‘c’ increases, while the lattice constant ‘a’ increases for TP1; however, for TP2, this value decreases. The variations in the lattice constant values are related to the larger ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.885 Å) and Mn2+ (0.81 and 0.96 Å for low and high spins, respectively) as compared to that of Ti4+ (0.745 Å).24 Despite the large variation in their ionic radii, Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions can replace Ti4+ ions in TiO2 because the Zn–O and Mn–O bond lengths of 1.93 (ref. 25) and ∼2.03 Å (ref. 26) are comparable to the Ti–O bond lengths of 1.93 and 1.98 Å for the distorted octahedral.27 The small variations of the order of 10−3 Å in the lattice parameters a and c of Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 are well justified with an average change of the order of 0.1 Å in the Zn–O and Mn–O bond lengths with a fractional doping of 0.01 and 0.02 (1.0 and 2.0 at%) (order of change in lattice parameters (10−3 Å) = order of change in average bond length (0.1 Å) × atomic fraction of dopants (10−2)). Thus, the variation in lattice constants (a and c) confirms that Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions replace the Ti4+ sites. Here, the change along the “c” direction is greater as compared to the “a” value; thus, it can be said that Zn2+ and Mn2+ are substituting Ti4+ mainly from the bcc and fcc lattice positions.28 Further, the lattice strain in TiO2, which is generated due to the incorporation of co-dopants, was also calculated using Williamson–Hall relation: , where η is the lattice strain.29 The lattice strain values of all the photocatalysts were obtained from the slopes of the plot of βcosθ versus 4sinθ, which gives a straight line (Fig. 2). The calculated lattice strain values for TP0, TP1, and TP2 are around 0.07, 0.49 and 0.31, respectively. Herein, TP1 shows a higher strain value than that of TP2, which may be due to the substitution of Ti4+ from the TiO2 lattice by the co-dopants ions. Same types of results have been also reported by Thurber et al., where with an increase in doping concentration, the lattice strain value decreases.30 Thus, the obtained results show that TP1 has a smaller crystalline size with an increase in anatase phase as well as the highest lattice strain, which indicates the easier uptake of co-dopants ions in the TiO2 lattice.31

To confirm the concrete presence of the co-dopants and to evaluate their chemical states in TiO2, XPS was performed. Here, to identify the difference due to co-doping on the TiO2 chemical states, an XPS study was also conducted with undoped and single Zn and Mn (Zn1, Mn1) doped TiO2. XPS spectra corresponding to the O1s, Ti2p, Mn2p, and Zn2p peaks were analyzed using the XPSPEAK version 4.1 program, where Shirley-typed background and Gaussian–Lorentzian (GL) distributions were used to fit the baselines and XPS peaks, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the survey spectra of TP0, TP1 and TP2, which reveal the presence of Zn and Mn in the co-doped samples. Although the amount of doping is less, the peaks related to co-dopants can still be observed in the XPS graph. In TP0 (Fig. 3b), the high resolution spectrum of O1s reveals peaks at 528.61 and 529.69 eV, which can be assigned to the lattice oxygen (Ti–O) and to the surface hydroxyl group of TiO2 (Ti–OH), respectively. In the co-doped TiO2, the XPS spectrum of O1s displays a center peak with another peak at 530.03 eV, which indicates the presence of oxygen and surface bound Ti–OH groups, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). Here, the third peak (530.89 eV for TP1 and 531.33 eV for TP2) is due to the presence of Zn and Mn (Ti–O–Zn/Ti–O–Mn) bonds, which originates from the co-doping of Zn and Mn. Furthermore, the higher binding energy of O in Ti–O–Zn/Ti–O–Mn bonds can be explained on the basis of the electronegativity of co-dopant ions, because Zn (1.64) and Mn (1.55) have a higher electronegativity than Ti (1.54). Thus, the O in Ti–O–Zn/Ti–O–Mn is less negative (electron cloud is more attracted towards Zn and Mn) compared to that in Ti–O–Ti.18 Fig. 3e shows the Ti2p spectra of TP0, TP1 and TP2, where compared to TP0, the Ti2p spectra of TP1 and TP2 shift towards a lower binding energy (0.4 eV). This shifting can be attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2. The energy difference between the doublets of all Ti2p spectra is found to be around 5.5 eV, which confirms that the core level Ti is in Ti4+ oxidation state. Fig. 3f shows the XPS spectra of the Mn2p core level of single Mn doped (Mn1) and co-doped TiO2, where the peaks observed in the range of 640.6–652.4 eV, can be ascribed to Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2. Because the XPS signal for Mn2+ and Mn3+ are very close to each other (∼640 eV), it can be concluded that Mn is present in a mixed state, which is formed due to the substitution of the Ti4+ ion from the TiO2 lattice by Mn2+/Mn3+ ions. Fig. 3g displays the high-resolution XPS spectra of single Zn doped (Zn1) and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2, which show the characteristics doublets of Zn2p in the range of 1020.9–1044.1 eV, with a spin orbit splitting of 23.2 eV, which correspond to the Zn2+ oxidation state.23 Here, with an increase in co-doping concentration, the peaks shift towards a higher binding energy, which is due to the formation of defect states in TiO2.

The morphology of the sol–gel synthesized undoped and co-doped TiO2 was investigated using SEM and TEM techniques, where the undoped as well as co-doped TiO2 exhibit an agglomerated surface, which resemble flat flakes with a rough morphology. SEM micrographs (Fig. S2†) reveal that the co-doping does not reflect any obvious influence on the morphology of the samples. The observed results indicate a rough morphology, which may be beneficial in the case of adsorption of dye onto the TiO2 nanoparticles due to their high surface roughness as well as high surface area. Fig. 4 shows the TEM micrographs of the photocatalysts, which further reveal the agglomerated nature of the samples. Fig. 4d shows the SAED pattern of TP0, which indicates the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized photocatalyst. As revealed from the XRD analysis (Table 1), the crystalline size varies between 15 and 50 nm, thus the larger size particles observed in the SEM images are of polycrystalline nature. Furthermore, to evaluate the distribution of Zn and Mn ions in TiO2 matrix, EDX elemental mapping was carried out. Fig. 5 shows the elemental mapping of TP0, TP1 and TP2, which reveals that in TP1 and TP2 the Zn and Mn ions are firmly incorporated into TiO2.

Here, (d), (j) and (p) show the combined elemental mapping images of TP0, TP1 and TP2, which reveal the distribution of Zn, Mn, Ti and O in the TiO2 matrix. 
The Raman spectra of TP0, TP1 and TP2 are displayed in Fig. 6. The Raman modes centered around 147, 200, and 642 cm−1 are named Eg(1), Eg(2) and Eg(3), while the other two modes at 401 and 522 cm−1 are termed B1g(1) and B1g(2) modes, respectively. These modes are characteristic of the anatase phase of TiO2.32 The Eg(1) band is the strongest band found in the anatase phase of TiO2. In addition, because the synthesized photocatalysts are polymorphic in nature, the weaker peaks between the region of 200–400 cm−1 (247, 325 and 357 cm−1) are due to the brookite and rutile phase of TiO2.33 With an increase in co-dopant concentration, a slight red shift is observed in the Eg(1) and Eg(2) modes of the co-doped photocatalyst (Fig. 6 inset graph). This red shift is probably due to the incorporation of co-dopants into TiO2 lattice. Thus, the obtained frequencies of TP0, TP1 and TP2, support the XRD results and also suggest that the anatase is the predominant phase in the sol–gel synthesized TiO2.

To investigate the effect of Zn, Mn co-doping on the vibration of TiO2 lattice, an FTIR study was carried out. Fig. 7 shows the FTIR spectra of the undoped and co-doped TiO2, where the strong absorption bands at 487 and 561 cm−1 might be due to Ti–O bond in the TiO2 lattice. Furthermore, a broad absorption band in the region of 3000–3500 cm−1 is observed for both the undoped and co-doped TiO2, which can be assigned to the surface-bound hydroxyl groups and their stretching vibration on the surface of TiO2.34 A second adsorption band at 1000–1700 cm−1 is assigned to surface-adsorbed water molecules (H–O–H bending, peak at 1628 cm−1).35 This confirms the strong interaction of water molecules towards the TiO2 surface, which results in a number of broad OH-stretching vibrations. The broad intense vibration region at 1000–1200 cm−1 is attributed to the Ti–O–Ti vibration. Additionally, the FTIR spectra of the TP1 and TP2 photocatalysts show some extra peaks in the 2800–2900 cm−1 region, which might originate due to the formation of Zn/Mn–Ti–O bonds. Moreover, it is also noticed that the position of the 724 cm−1 band of TP0, which corresponds to Ti–O vibrations, shifts towards a lower wavenumber with the increase in co-dopant content. This can be explained by the fact that in co-doped TiO2, Ti4+ ions are substituted by the co-dopant ions, thus forming oxygen vacancies to attain charge-neutrality. The absence of oxygen atoms in co-doped TiO2 may reduce the Ti–O or newly formed Zn/Mn–Ti–O bonds, which indicates the lowering of average force-constant value of the chemical bonds.36 Thus, in co-doped TiO2, the peak corresponding to Ti–O bonds shifts to a lower wavenumber. Thus, the FTIR analysis confirms that the Zn and Mn ions incorporated in TiO2 substitute Ti4+ from its lattice and create oxygen vacancies.

The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is primarily related to its band-gap properties. Thus, to evaluate the Eg value as well as the electronic properties of the undoped and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2, the UV-vis spectrum within the range of 200–800 nm wavelengths was obtained (Fig. 8a), where TP0 shows a sharp absorption edge around 402 nm (Eg = ∼3.1 eV). With the incorporation of co-dopant ions, the absorption edge is extended to the broader visible region (400–800 nm) and hence a red shift is observed in the co-doped TiO2. This red shift in TP1 and TP2 is attributed to the impurity levels created by the Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions within the band gap of TiO2. Due to the different valence states of the Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions compared to the host metal ion (Ti4+), oxygen deficiencies are generated in the co-doped TiO2.21 Subsequently, additional energy levels are created within the band gap of TiO2. The incorporation of these extra energy levels is considered to be responsible for the apparent red shift in co-doped TiO2. The Eg values of the undoped and co-doped TiO2 are evaluated from the plots of the square root of Kubelka–Munk function (αhν) against energy (hν). The relation between Kubelka–Munk function and energy is defined as (αhν)1/2 = A(hν − Eg)m, where A is a constant, hν is the photon energy (E) with h being Planck's constant (4.14 × 10−16 eV s). The value of the right side exponent (m) is taken to be 1/2 and 2 for indirect and direct band gap transitions, respectively. The calculated Eg value for TP0, TP1, and TP2 is 3.1, 2.9 and 2.86 eV, respectively (Fig. 8b–d). Thus, with an increase in co-doping content, the band gap is reduced.

The photocatalytic activities of TP0, TP1 and TP2 were evaluated by the degradation of MB under both UV and visible irradiation (Fig. 9a and b), where undoped TiO2 (TP0) showed obvious photocatalytic activity for MB degradation. Due to high band gap (∼3.2 eV), theoretically pristine TiO2 cannot absorb visible light, thus the visible photocatalytic activity of TP0 can be explained by the TiO2 photosensitization by MB dye molecules.37 Herein, the dye molecule can inject its photoexcited electrons into the conduction band of pristine TiO2, which initiate a number of redox chain reactions. The MB pollutant can be degraded by these redox reactions. The whole mechanism of the visible light degradation of MB over TP0 is provided in the ESI (S1; Fig. S3†). The degradation of MB was also studied in the absence of photocatalyst (blank), where it is noticed that MB can degrade naturally, however the degradation rate is found to be extremely slow. Furthermore, with both irradiation sources, TP1 exhibits the maximum photocatalytic activity. There are many factors that affect the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 such as crystallinity, morphology and electronic properties. Thus, the increased photocatalytic activity of co-doped TiO2 can be explained by considering the modification of these factors. It is evident that the polymorphic TiO2 provides a synergistic effect. Because in the present case the sol–gel synthesized TiO2 consists of anatase/rutile/brookite phases, the possibility of heterojunction formation among these phases is possible. Thus, during the photocatalysis process electron–hole pairs can be separated due to the different crystalline structures and band gap values of the TiO2 polymorphs.38 Moreover, the diverse crystal structure of these phases might also play a critical role in the photocatalysis process, because they determine the adsorption of intermediate products that are formed during the photocatalysis process. Furthermore, during photocatalysis process, holes produce hydroxyl radicals after reacting with the surface water, which is considered a dominant oxidant for the degradation of organic pollutants.39 In case of TP1 and TP2, FTIR analysis shows that the incorporation of Zn and Mn ions produces excess hydroxyl radicals. Nevertheless, in TP2, the decrease in the photocatalytic activity is possibly related to the excessive surface oxygen vacancies induced due to the higher doping concentration.21 The plausible mechanism of the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized photocatalysts can be explained by the energy band gap structure of TiO2 shown in Fig. 10. Because TiO2 has a high Eg (3.2 eV), the direct excitation of electrons from valance band (VB) to conduction band (CB) in the presence of visible light is not possible. Upon the incorporation of Zn2+ and Mn2+ ions into TiO2 lattice, the energy band gap of TiO2 decreases due to the formation of impurity levels below CB in the band gap, where electrons can transfer from VB of TiO2 to these energy levels. These electrons travel to surface and are adsorbed by O2 to produce ˙O2 ions, which can be further converted to strong redox species such as H2O2 and ˙OH ions.14 These redox ions are responsible for the degradation of the surface adsorbed hazardous MB dye. In case of TP2, as Zn, Mn co-doping concentration increases, the density of new energy levels also increases, which ultimately enhances the recombination possibilities of electron and holes because they can be easily trapped on these recombination centers. Thus, due to the reduction of the distances between the tapping sites, the increased recombination rate will compete with the photocatalytic redox process, which eventually slows down the photocatalytic rate.40 Generally, to understand the mechanism of recombination of electron–hole pairs in semiconductors, photoluminescence (PL) spectra are used because PL emission arises due to the recombination of free charge carriers. Fig. 11 illustrates the PL spectra of TiO2 and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 in the wavelength range of 385–600 nm, with an excitement wavelength of 355 nm. The PL spectra of the photocatalysts show two main peaks at around 414 and 434 nm, which can be attributed to the band-gap emission transmission and surface oxygen vacancies, respectively. In the co-doped photoctalysts, lowering of the PL intensity can be associated with the transfer of electrons from excited TiO2 to the new energy levels created by the co-dopant. Because PL emission is generated due to the recombination of free charge carriers, the decreasing PL intensity of the co-doped samples indicates a reduction in the recombination of electron and holes.41 It is found that the PL emission intensity of TP2 is higher than that of TP1, indicating the high recombination rate of charge carriers in TP2; this is probably the reason for the lower photocatalytic activity of TP2. Thus, although higher Zn, Mn co-doping narrows down the band gap, it fastens the recombination rate of e−/h+ pairs.42,43 Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of co-doped TiO2 was also compared with single Zn/Mn doped TiO2 (Fig. S4†), which shows that the co-doped TiO2 provides a higher degradation rate than single-doped TiO2. Besides MB dye, the visible photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts was also examined with a colorless pollutant, phenol. Fig. S5† shows the degradation of phenol with the synthesized TP0, TP1 and TP2, which reveals that phenol could be degraded over TiO2; however, due to the very good stability of this type of pollutant, the degradation rate was relatively low, and after 10 h of visible irradiation, the maximum degradation rate was about 60% with TP1 photocatalyst. Furthermore, to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of co-doped TiO2 with high power sources, photocatalytic experiments were also conducted with a 450 W visible light solar simulator (Oriel-Newport, Fig. S6†). The obtained results reveal that with a high irradiation power source, the co-doped TiO2 (TP1) was able to degrade 90% of MB within 50 minutes. This implies that the as-synthesized photocatalysts can be efficiently used with high power sources, as well. The degradation of MB under UV and visible light irradiation follows first-order kinetics. The reaction rate constants under UV and visible light irradiation (kUV and kvis) were calculated from the slopes of the semi-log plots of concentration C/C0 (Fig. 12) using the Arrhenius equation , where k represents the respective rate constants, kUV or kvis, for UV and visible irradiation, while Ct and C0 are the concentrations of MB at time t and 0, respectively. For both (UV and visible) irradiations, TP1 exhibits a higher reaction rate constant (Table S1†). Under UV irradiation, the kUV for TP0 is around 0.07, which with the incorporation of 1.0 at% Zn, Mn ions increases to 0.13. This enhancement can be associated with the band-gap modification of TiO2, which improves the degradation of MB organic molecules. The comparison of photocatalytic activities of Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 for UV and visible radiation was conducted further by correlating the photocatalytic rate constants for UV (kUV) and visible (kvis) radiation with absorbance (αλ) at λ = 300 and 700 nm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 13, a high correlation between the αλ and k values is observed for UV radiation, while the correlation for visible radiation remains poor. This suggests that for UV radiation, photoactivity is directly proportional to the number of absorbed photons. On the other hand, for visible radiation, with an increase in dopant concentration, k decreases, despite the increase in αλ, which suggests only a partial contribution of visible radiation photons in the photoactivity of the TiO2 photocatalysts. The decreased photoactivity of TP2 as compared to TP1 for both UV and visible radiation can be attributed to the decreased values of αλ in the UV region (Fig. 8a1). Additionally, from the application point of view, the synthesized photocatalyst should be stable.44 Thus, the stability and reusability of these photocatalysts were examined by reusing the TP1 photocatalyst. For this, the TP1 photocatalyst was reused for four times (Fig. S7†). After being used for four times, the dye degradation efficiency was found to be 70% in the presence of visible light irradiation. This implies the
good stability and reusability of the photocatalyst.

Apart from the structural parameters, such as surface area, crystalline size and electronic properties, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 also depends on the irradiation source intensity (Io). According to the Fermi–Golden rule, transition probability is proportional to the density of final states (ρf), i.e., the density of available states in CB. Again, under continuous illumination with a light source of fixed photon energies, the fraction of occupied states (δρf) in the CB is proportional to the Io. Thus, the effective density of the final states (ρf − δρf) decreases with an increase in Io, which consequently decreases the transition probability. Thus, the number of transitions does not increase linearly with an increase in Io but effectively decreases the photocatalytic degradation per unit Io. To compare the photocatalytic activity observed in the studies conducted using sources with varying intensities, the degradation efficiency per unit power (Φ) can be defined as Φ = S/(L0t) × 10−5, where S is the % degradation at time t (min) and L0 is the power rating of the illumination source in watts (W). Using the abovementioned formula, a comparison of the as-synthesized photocatalyst (TP1) with the photocatalysts reported literature was made, which suggests that the application of a low power source significantly enhances the degradation efficiency in the as-obtained photocatalyst (Table S2†). It is evident from Table S2† that with the low intensity visible irradiation source (2 W) the Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 provides the high degradation efficiency of ∼66.6 W−1 min−1 as compared to ∼37.5 W−1 min−1 for N doped TiO2.45
4. Conclusions
Undoped and Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized using sol–gel method and their photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB under UV and visible irritation were evaluated. Analysis of their XRD patterns shows the formation of polymorphic TiO2, where with an increase in doping, the anatase phase increases. The XPS analysis confirms the co-doping of Zn and Mn in TiO2. Furthermore, the band gap of TiO2 exhibits a red shift with an increase in dopant concentration. Although 2.0 at% Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 (TP2) shows the highest red shift, the maximum photocatalytic activity is observed for 1.0 at% (TP1) co-dopant concentration under both UV as well as visible light irradiation. This enhanced photocatalytic degradation by TP1 is attributed to its multiphase structure and increased absorption in UV range as well as the efficient transfer of electron hole pairs through the co-dopant ions in the subenergy bands of TiO2. With a low intensity visible irradiation source (2 W), 1.0 at% Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 provides a very high degradation of ∼66.6 W−1 min−1. Thus, due to the striking features, the as-synthesized Zn, Mn co-doped TiO2 can be efficiently used for the removal of organic pollutants.
