    , Accepted 17th April 2015First published on 20th April 2015AbstractA novel BODIPY-porphyrin triad PorCOOH-(BDP)2 (scorpion shaped) was prepared, in which two BODIPY molecules are covalently attached via a 1,3,5-triazine molecule to a free-base carboxyphenyl meso-substituted porphyrin. The chromophore was synthesized via stepwise substitution reactions of cyanuric chloride. Photophysical and electrochemical studies of this triad, in combination with DFT theoretical calculations, suggest that there is negligible electronic interaction between the porphyrin and BODIPY moieties in the triad's ground states, but the frontier orbital energy levels are suitable for use as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Solar cells sensitized by triad PorCOOH-(BDP)2 were fabricated, and were found to exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 5.17% under illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm2) and with a TiO2 film of 12 μm thickness, with a sensitization time of 3 h without any coadsorbent. The PCE value of DSSC was enhanced to 6.20% when a thin layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was incorporated between TiO2 and PorCOOH-(BDP)2 dye, which is attributed to the formation of an rGO–TiO2 Schottky barrier in the device, leading to efficient charge transport of injected electrons towards the external circuit, resulting in higher Jsc and FF. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) demonstrate that a photoelectrode with rGO–TiO2 exhibits shorter transport time of electrons, longer electron lifetime and lower charge transfer resistance.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), first reported by Grätzel in 1991, have attracted a lot of attention due to their low cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) values, in the aim of developing and improving renewable energy sources.1 A typical DSSC is constituted of a dye sensitized TiO2 electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and an electrolyte. The sensitizer plays an important role in the PCE value of the DSSC. A dye, which is anchored to the surface of the TiO2 nanocrystalline electrode, absorbs the solar radiation and transfers photoexcited electrons to the conduction band of the TiO2. In this respect, many sensitizers with donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) configurations have been developed.2 Among them, porphyrins have been used as sensitizers for DSSCs due to their strongly absorbing Soret band (λ = 400–450 nm) and moderately intense Q bands (λ = 550–650 nm), which cover the visible to near infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum.3 Moreover, their optical and electrochemical properties can be tuned easily by simple modification of their chemical structure. Recently, Diau and Yeh et al. designed a highly efficient porphyrin sensitizer, functionalized with two bis(ortho-alkoxy)-wrapped meso-phenyl groups for reducing dye aggregation, and an ethynyl benzoic acid group as the acceptor.4 More recently, the highest efficiency values of 13.0% and 12.75% for DSSCs, sensitized with porphyrins which have octyloxy-wrapped structures, utilizing a benzothiadiazole bridge between the ethynyl and benzoic acid moieties and using a cobalt based electrolyte, were reported by Grätzel and co-workers.5
Although the absorption spectrum of porphyrins is strong in the Soret and moderate in the Q band regions, it exhibits poor absorption intensity in the region between 475 nm to 550 nm. To compensate this poor absorption intensity of porphyrins, several research groups have investigated dyes in that region, extended π-systems in porphyrins. This approach can lead to a significantly broadened Soret band and a red shift of the Q band absorption peaks. For example, elongation of π-systems in meso- and β-naphthalene fused-porphyrins improves the PCE value by 50%, in comparison with the non-fused systems.6 Similarly, attaching a conjugated anchoring group at the β-position of the porphyrin ring has been successfully applied and the DSSC based on this porphyrin dye yielded a PCE value of 7.1%.7
One of the approaches for improving the absorption properties of porphyrin derivatives in the region of 450–550 nm is their linking with chromophores that strongly absorb in the above region. BODIPY fluorophores have been widely used as light harvesting antenna groups, whose derivatives have excellent photochemical properties with strong absorption bands from the visible to the NIR region8 and possess complementary properties with porphyrins. Moreover, recently Ziessel et al. reported a PCE value of 5.75% for DSSCs using BODIPY dyes.9 Also, molecules that consist of both porphyrin and BODIPY chromophores have been developed to enhance the optoelectronic properties of the resulting molecules.10 Some strategies have been developed to improve the limited photophysical profile of porphyrin derivatives in the blue-green region of the spectrum. Therefore, porphyrins were modified with BODIPY as an antenna chromophore for efficient intramolecular energy transfer.10b,11 A BODIPY-porphyrin conjugate, with an acetylide group as a bridge, has recently shown an improved PCE value compared to its parent porphyrin chromophore when used as a sensitizer in a DSSC.12 Lazarides and co-workers designed multi-chromophore arrays consisting of two BODIPY units axially bound to porphyrin complexes, which have been investigated in terms of their electron or energy transfer mechanism. Among all chromophore groups, one of the most effective light harvesting efficiency values was achieved by using a phenolate group as a linker.13
The 1,3,5-triazine moiety has been used as a linker for the synthesis of metal-free organic dyes as sensitizers for DSSCs and other photoconductive materials.14 The structural, chemical and electronic properties of this unit allow the synthesis of complex π-conjugated multi-chromophore dyes through simple organic reactions15 that offer improved light harvesting ability, as well as improved electron injection and transportation rates.16 Triad compounds where the triazine moiety is covalently connected with a BODIPY moiety have been synthesized and their fluorescent properties have been studied.15b,c Liu et al. reported a solar cell sensitized by a triazine-based metal-free organic dye with a D–π–A structure, that showed a PCE value of 3.63%.17 Triazine-bridged porphyrin arrays have been used as electron donors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells by Luechai et al.18 and recently by us.19 In addition, our research group synthesized a series of triazine-bridged porphyrin dyads and triads, and DSSCs based on these sensitizers showed moderate PCE values.20
In this work, we describe the facile synthesis of a BODIPY-porphyrin triad [PorCOOH-(BDP)2], using a triazine linker, and its application as a sensitizer for DSSCs. The DSSC based on that BODIPY-porphyrin triad attached onto a TiO2/FTO photoelectrode showed a PCE value of 5.17%, which was further improved to 6.20% when an rGO/TiO2/FTO (rGO: reduced graphene oxide) photoelectrode was used. The increase in the PCE value was attributed to the more efficient transport of injected electrons towards the FTO surface, due to the formation of a Schottky barrier formed between rGO and TiO2.
Experimental
General methods, materials, and techniques
All manipulations were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under nitrogen atmosphere. 2,4,6-Trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (cyanuric chloride), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and other chemicals and solvents were purchased from usual commercial sources and used as received, unless otherwise stated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was freshly distilled from Na/benzophenone. 4-Aminophenyl-4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (or 4-aminophenyl-boron dipyrrin or NH2-BDP) and 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-15-(4-aminophenyl)-10,20-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)porphyrin (PorCOOH) were prepared according to literature procedures.21,22
Synthesis of triad PorCOOH-(BDP)2 (3)
To a THF solution (2 mL) of cyanuric chloride (0.0098 g, 0.053 mmol) and DIPEA (11 μL, 0.064 mmol) a THF solution (2 mL) of porphyrin PorCOOH (0.040 g, 0.053 mmol) was added, under N2 at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 15 min, and upon reaction completion (monitored by TLC), it was left to warm to room temperature. Next, a THF solution (4 mL) of NH2-BDP (0.027 g, 0.08 mmol) and DIPEA (22 μL, 0.128 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Another excess of NH2-BDP (0.090 g, 0.265 mmol) and DIPEA (92 μL, 0.53 mmol) were added and the mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 24 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and after dilution in CH2Cl2; the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CH2Cl2). The desired product 3 was isolated as a purple solid.

NMR spectra

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 MHz and 13C NMR spectra on Bruker DPX-75 MHz spectrometer, as solutions in deuterated solvents by using the solvent peak as the internal standard.
Mass spectra
High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometer.
FTIR spectra
FTIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 16PC FTIR spectrometer.
Photophysical measurements
UV-vis absorption spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer using 10 mm path-length cuvettes. Emission spectra were measured on a JASCO FP-6500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a red sensitive WRE-343 photomultiplier tube (wavelength range: 200–850 nm). Emission lifetimes were determined by the time-correlated single-photon counting technique using an Edinburgh Instruments mini-tau lifetime spectrophotometer equipped with an EPL 405 pulsed diode laser at 406.0 nm with a pulse width of 71.52 ps and pulse periods of 50 ns and a high-speed red sensitive photomultiplier tube (H5773-04) as detector.
Electrochemistry measurements
Cyclic and square wave voltammetry experiments were carried out at room temperature using an AutoLab PGSTAT20 potentiostat and appropriate routines available in the operating software (GPES, version 4.9). Measurements were carried out in freshly distilled and deoxygenated CH2Cl2, with scan rate 100 mV s−1, with a solute concentration of 1.0 mM in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode cell setup was used with a platinum working electrode, a saturated calomel (SCE) reference electrode, and a platinum wire as counter electrode. The system was calibrated with ferrocene.
Computational methods
All the theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program suite.23 Density functional theory (DFT)24 with hybrid B3LYP functionals25,26 and the 6-31G(d) basis sets were used for gas phase geometry optimization of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 (Fig. 6 and Table S1, ESI†). TDDFT calculations were carried out using geometry optimized coordinates in the same level of theory and basis sets. Tomasi's Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM)27 was used for describing the solvent effect (dichloromethane) with standard dielectric constant ε = 8.93. The input geometries as well as the computed structures and molecular orbitals were modeled using ChemCraft software.28
Device fabrication and characterization
The working and counter electrodes consisting of TiO2 and thermally platinum films, respectively, were deposited onto F-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrates which were pre-cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and ethanol and then dried in air. For the working electrode, TiO2 paste, prepared as reported earlier,20 was deposited on the FTO substrate by the doctor blade technique. TiO2 films of different thicknesses were prepared (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 μm) in order to optimize the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. In all cases, the electrode was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, it was immersed in a 20 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 80 °C, washed with deionized water and ethanol, sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min, and cooled to 60 °C. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite powder according to a two-step oxidation protocol reported by Kovtyukhova et al.29 For reduction of GO, the thermal treatment method was adopted. GO (0.5 mg) was first dispersed in 2 mL ethanol followed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h to yield a yellow-brown solution. For the preparation of the rGO/TiO2/FTO photoanode, the above-prepared GO was spin-coated with an aqueous solution of GO on top of the above-prepared TiO2/FTO electrode for 30 s at 2500 rpm and then heated to 120 °C for 20 min, in ambient air. The GO was converted into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through the hydrothermal treatment. Finally, the photoelectrode i.e. TiO2/FTO or rGO/TiO2/FTO was immersed in a porphyrin solution (200 μM in THF for different immersing time periods) to give the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 working electrode. The platinum counter electrode was prepared by spin-coating drops of a H2PtCl6 solution onto a FTO-coated glass substrate and heating to 350 °C for 15 min. The working electrode was separated from the counter electrode by a 20 μm thick Surlyn hot-melt gasket to assemble the DSSCs. In the space between the working and counter electrodes, the electrolyte [consisting of 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M LiI, 0.6 M (dimethylpropyl)benzoimidiazole iodide, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in an acetonitrile solution] was introduced through a hole and sealed with Surlyn. The devices prepared with TiO2/FTO and rGO/TiO2/FTO were denoted as device A and device B, respectively.
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs under illumination were measured by a Keithley source meter and a solar simulator coupled with a 150 W xenon lamp and an AM optical filter to give 100 mW cm−2 illumination at the DSSC surface. The EIS spectra, in the dark and under illumination, were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT) with a frequency response analyzer. The frequency range was from 10 MHz to 100 kHz, and an alternative-current potential of 10 mV was used. A direct-current bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of DSSC was applied. The impedance data were analyzed using Z-View software with an appropriate equivalent circuit. The IPCE value was measured as a function of the wavelength with a xenon lamp, a monochromator, and a Keithley source meter under constant illumination intensity at each wavelength. The intensity calibration for the IPCE measurement was performed using a standard silicon photo-diode.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, the porphyrin triad PorCOOH-(BDP)2 (3) consists of a meso aryl-substituted free-base porphyrin unit PorCOOH (namely 5-(4-carboxyphenyl)-15-(4-aminophenyl)-10,20-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)porphyrin) and two BODIPY units, abbreviated as NH2-BDP, which are connected, through aryl-amino groups at their peripheries, by a central 1,3,5-triazine moiety. Specifically, the choice of that porphyrin unit was led by the fact that the sterically demanding mesityl moieties, presented as substituents in the 10,20-meso positions, exhibit the ability to afford trans–meso substituted porphyrins without scrambling, thus avoiding the formation of a complicated mixture of porphyrins.22 Also, the porphyrin moiety contains an anchoring group for the attachment onto the TiO2 surface of DSSC electrodes.
 Scheme 1  Triad porphyrin chromophore PorCOOH-(BDP)2. 
The synthesis of the triad, shown in Scheme 2, was accomplished via stepwise amination reactions of cyanuric chloride, which is the precursor of the bridging 1,3,5-triazine group of the triad. The potential of cyanuric chloride to provide access to a variety of triazine-bridged assemblies, such as macrocycles,30 dendrimers,31 and multiporphyrin arrays,21,32 has been demonstrated in the past. Furthermore, we have recently reported symmetrical and unsymmetrical triazine-bridged porphyrin dyads and triads.19,20
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route for the preparation of porphyrin PorCOOH-(BDP)2. 
The initial step for the synthesis of the triad involves the reaction of cyanuric chloride with Por-COOH in the presence of the base DIPEA at 0 °C in THF (Scheme 2). TLC, indicating the disappearance of the reactants, monitored the reaction and the formation of the PorCOOH-triazine adduct 1. The latter was not isolated but further reacted at room temperature with the NH2-BDP moiety affording the PorCOOH-triazine-BDP compound 2. The third chlorine atom of cyanuric chloride was substituted by another NH2-BDP moiety in a one-pot reaction at 65 °C, resulting in the desired PorCOOH-(BDP)2 product 3, as confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF spectrometry. In the 1H NMR spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)23, the signals of the aromatic H's ortho to the amino groups of the Por-COOH moiety, after attachment to the triazine ring, are downfield displaced compared to those of free Por-COOH.
Photophysical properties (Table 1)
The optical absorption spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 in THF solution is shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 exhibits characteristic absorption bands for free-base porphyrin (strong Soret band: λmax = 422 nm, weaker Q-bands: λmax = 552 nm, 596 nm and 652 nm). In addition to these bands, PorCOOH-(BDP)2 exhibits one more absorption band centered at 502 nm which is attributed to the π–π* transition of the BODIPY moiety.33 The absorption spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2, which shows the characteristic peaks of both porphyrin and BODIPY moieties, indicates negligible electronic interactions between the porphyrin and BODIPY units in the ground state of the triad.

The absorption spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 adsorbed onto the TiO2 film is similar (Fig. 1) to the absorption spectrum in solution, but exhibits a small red shift and broadening, reflecting slight aggregation.

In Fig. 2a the steady-state fluorescence spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 triad in THF solution is shown. It is known from the literature that BODIPY moieties exhibit a characteristic emission feature at about 510–550 nm.21 Irradiation of the triad at 460 nm, which corresponds to the selective excitation of the BODIPY moiety, results in emission peaks not only from the residual fluorescence of the BODIPY moieties at 515 nm, with a lifetime of 2.24 ns, but also from the porphyrin constituent at 655 and 717 nm, with a lifetime of 8.23 ns. Additionally, the excitation spectrum of the triad, monitord at the emission of the porphyrin constituent at 655 nm (Fig. 2b), shows apart from the absorption features of porphyrin, a slightly enhanced BODIPY absorption feature at 502 nm. This is an indication of the possible existence of energy or electron transfer between the BODIPY and porphyrin moieties, following excitation of the BODIPY unit.

FT-IR spectroscopy
ATR-FTIR spectra of pure PorCOOH-(BDP)2 and PorCOOH-(BDP)2 adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface were measured in order to explore the anchoring ability of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 on TiO2,34 and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The FTIR spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 shows a characteristic strong absorption band at around 1694 cm−1, which corresponds to the ν(CO) stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, whereas two other absorption bands at around 1402 cm−1 and 1598 cm−1 are also observed, corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibration νsym(COO−) and the asymmetric stretching vibration νasym(COO−) of the carboxylate group, respectively. However, in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2/TiO2, the absorption band of the stretching vibration ν(CO) of the carboxylic acid group is completely disappeared and a significant increase is observed in the bands that correspond to the symmetric νsym(COO−) and the asymmetric νasym(COO−) vibration stretching of the carboxylate group, at around 1402 cm−1 and 1598 cm−1, respectively. The disappearance of ν(CO) and the increased intensity of νsym(COO−) and νasym(COO−) indicate that a proton is detached from the carboxylic acid group during the adsorption of the porphyrin onto the TiO2 surface, leading to the bidentate binding of the carboxylate group to the TiO2 surface.

XPS spectroscopy
We have also performed the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement of PorCOOH-(BDP)2/TiO2 to gain more insight into the mode of the porphyrin binding on the TiO2 surface. The O 1s photoelectron spectrum (Fig. 4) exhibits two distinct oxygen peaks at 530.3 and 532.5 eV. The oxygen atom on the TiO2 surface gives the most intense peak at 530.3 eV and the moderate and broad peak at around 532.5 originates from the oxygen atoms of carboxylate groups that are attached onto the TiO2 surface through the bidentate mode of attachment.35

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the PorCOOH-(BDP)2 conjugate were investigated by cyclic and square-wave voltammetry measurements in dichloromethane. The corresponding cyclic and square-wave voltammograms are presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. S5 (ESI†), respectively, while the redox data are collected in Table 2.

 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammogram of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 in CH2Cl2vs. SCE. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple wave is observed at 0.56 V vs. SCE. 
There are three oxidation processes, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), where the first oxidation wave occurs at E1ox = +0.91 V vs. SCE and corresponds to the first porphyrin-based oxidation, while the second and the third oxidation waves, placed at E2ox = +1.12 V and E3ox = +1.22 V vs. SCE, respectively, are attributed to the overlapping second porphyrin and BODIPY-based oxidations, respectively. In addition, the reduction waves of the triad are reversible processes, observed at E1red = −1.19 V and E2red = −1.61 V vs. SCE, and are due to the overlapping BODIPY and first porphyrin-based reductions and to the second porphyrin-based reduction, respectively.21
For efficient electron injection from the excited state of the porphyrin dye into the conduction band of TiO2, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of PorCOOH-(BDP)2, which corresponds to its first reduction potential, should be more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−0.74 V vs. SCE). The first reduction potential of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 (E1red = −1.19 V vs. SCE) is more negative than the conduction band edge of TiO2; hence there is sufficient driving force for electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2. For efficient regeneration of oxidized PorCOOH-(BDP)2 by I− in the electrolyte, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of PorCOOH-(BDP)2, which corresponds to its first oxidation potential, should be lower than the potential of the redox couple I3−/I− (0.2 V vs. SCE) in the electrolyte. The first oxidation potential (E1ox = 0.91 V vs. SCE) of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 is more positive than the redox potential of I3−/I− in the electrolyte, implying that regeneration of the oxidized PorCOOH-(BDP)2 is energetically feasible.
Theoretical calculations
DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory were employed to further explore the molecular and electronic structures of the final compound.
The gas phase geometry optimized structure of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 is depicted in Fig. 6, while the optimized coordinates are provided in Table S1 in ESI.† From the optimized structure we observe that the triazine ring is almost co-planar with the two bridging phenyl groups of the BODIPY units and the bridging phenyl group of the porphyrin as well. The three peripheral units (BODIPY units and porphyrin) form a perpendicular framework with respect to the triazine ring, extending the central π-conjugated system. We can also notice that the phenyl and the 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups are perpendicular to the BODIPY and to the porphyrin ring respectively.

The LUMO and LUMO+1 are very close in energy and their electron density is predominantly located on the porphyrin unit, with some additional contributions on the benzoic acid group and the bridging phenyl group. The HOMO is spread over the porphyrin unit, while the HOMO−1 is entirely localized on the BODIPY unit. Consequently, PorCOOH-(BDP)2 could be described as a “push–pull” 2D–π–A system (D: donor, A: acceptor) system with the potential to act as a sensitizer in DSSCs. The electron density distributions on HOMO−1, LUMO, and LUMO+1 favor intramolecular electron transfer. More precisely, upon photoexcitation, electron transfer possibly occurs from the donor (BODIPY unit) to the acceptor (porphyrin unit) through the triazine π-conjugated system. The fact that the LUMO orbitals are located on the porphyrin unit and on the anchoring carboxylic acid group successfully promotes the electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band.

For the optimized structure of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energies, the HOMO–LUMO gap and the dipole moment are listed in Table 3. The HOMO–LUMO gap was calculated in CH2Cl2 solution and was found to be 2.67 eV. This value is similar to the experimentally observed HOMO–LUMO gap from our electrochemistry experiments (Table 2).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 have also been calculated at the TD-DFT/B3LYP level (Fig. S1, ESI†). At small wavenumbers we can observe that the compound exhibits a high intensity band with five peaks, while at larger wavenumbers two low intensity bands appeared around 540 and 580 nm. Furthermore, the intense band peaks are found to be at 375 nm (3.31 eV), 389 nm (3.19 eV), 397 nm (3.12 eV), 410 nm (3.03 eV), 422 nm (2.94 eV), 542 nm (2.29 eV) and 579 nm (2.14 eV).
Photovoltaic properties
We optimized the performance of the DSSC by investigating the immersion time of the TiO2 electrode during the sensitization process. We investigated the effect of immersion time of the TiO2 electrode into the porphyrin dye solution on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. The TiO2 electrode was sensitized by PorCOOH-(BDP)2 THF solution for 1–12 h and we found that maximum photovoltaic performance was observed when the immersion time was 4 h, beyond which the value of PCE starts to decrease slightly with the increase in immersion time, which can be reorganized by an increase in porphyrin aggregation with increasing immersion time.36 It is well known that dye molecules which are only chemisorbed on TiO2 by either chelating, monodense esteric linkage, bidentate bridging or hydrogen bonding, can inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2, contribute to the Jsc value of the cell. Therefore, the excess amount of dye, which does not contribute to the current generation, may be present either in multi-layers or physisorbed on TiO2. The difference in the immersion time for the maximal PCE value can be explained as a trade-off between the effect of the extent of porphyrin adsorption and that of porphyrin aggregation, which adversely affect the PCE value. We have only discussed the photovoltaic properties of the DSSC prepared in optimized conditions.

Fig. 8a and b show the current–voltage characteristics under illumination (100 mW cm−2) and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) for a DSSC based on PorCOOH-(BDP)2 (sensitization time 4 h) (device A) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4. The optimized DSSC showed a PCE value of 5.09% with Jsc = 10.86 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.67 V and FF = 0.70. The IPCE spectrum closely resembles the absorption spectrum of the PorCOOH-(BDP)2 sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode.

In most DSSCs, TiO2 is used as the photoelectrode, but the major drawback associated with the use of TiO2 is the random transport of the electrons, which causes the electron–hole recombination process and, hence, affects the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC.37 The problem about how to improve the PCE value of the DSSC could be overcome by designing a photoanode with an efficient transport pathway from the injected charge carriers to the external circuit. Several kinds of photoanode materials have been employed, such as doped TiO2,38 metal/metal oxide–TiO2 hybrid39 and TiO2–carbon materials,40 to improve and reduce the electron transport and recombination, respectively.
Graphene, a single layer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms, is a promising material for transparent electrodes based on a 2-dimensional (2D) planar structure and unique electronic properties, which include excellent optical transparency and high carrier mobility.41 Among many chemically modified graphene composites, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is the most used in nanoelectronics. Significant efforts have been devoted to using graphene composites for improving the overall performance of photovoltaic devices such as organic photovoltaic devices and DSSCs.42 Not only its remarkable electrical conduction, but also the matching conduction band of TiO2 and graphene, which serves as the charge transport medium, enhance the electron transfer from the conduction band to the FTO. Thus, integration of TiO2 with graphene derivatives could be highly promising in order to improve the photovoltaic performance of TiO2. Many reports have demonstrated that the incorporation of graphene onto TiO2 is an efficient way for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.43 We have used a rGO/TiO2 photoanode to improve the PCE of a DSSC sensitized with PorCOOH-(BDP)2.
Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the SEM images of TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 electrodes. There are more pores in the TiO2 electrode as compared to rGO/TiO2, and we assume rGO penetrates into the TiO2 and its pores are filled by the rGO during the spin-coating process and form the rGO/TiO2 composite. The surface areas of rGO/TiO2 and TiO2 are about 51.96 m2 g−1 and 52.08 m2 g−1, respectively, which are nearly the same indicating that the rGO/TiO2 electrode will not improve the dye adsorption. Moreover, the TiO2 nanoparticles can be easily attached to the penetrated rGO during the spin-casting, as a result of the electrostatic charges. This complete and continuous contact between components will facilitate the photoexcited electron transfer from the TiO2 to the rGO conducting layer and will contribute to the enhanced values of Jsc and FF, as discussed later.
The interaction between the TiO2 and rGO in the prepared photoanodes was investigated by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the pure TiO2 film shows typical and intense absorption in the UV region (less than 380 nm), resulting from the electron transitions from the valence band to the conduction band. However, when rGO was spin-coated onto TiO2, i.e. rGO/TiO2 film showed a broad band absorption in the visible region, which could be ascribed to the existence of reduced graphene oxide in the rGO/TiO2 film. Moreover, the introduction of rGO onto the TiO2 film, the hybrid film display a red shift of the absorption edge, which indicates the band gap of rGO/TiO2 has a tendency of narrowing. On the basis of the optical absorption, we assume that during the spin-coating of GO onto TiO2 from aqueous solution, the GO penetrates the TiO2 and after the hydrothermal treatment a rGO/TiO2 hybrid film was formed. On the basis of the above results, it was proposed that Ti–O–C bonds between TiO2 and rGO was formed.44
To further improve the PCE value of the DSSC sensitized by PorCOOH-(BDP)2 dye (device B), we employed a modified photoanode, i.e. rGO/TiO2 (as described in the Experimental). It is obvious that device B shows a PCE value of 6.20%, due to its high Jsc value and FF (Fig. 8 and Table 4).
The recombination of injected photoinduced charge carriers from the excited state of the dye into the semiconductor is crucial because it would significantly influence the photoelectrochemical properties and DSSC performance. The recombination of photoinduced charge carriers (electrons and holes) releases energy in the form of photoluminescence (PL). Hence a lower PL intensity indicates less charge recombination. We have recorded the PL spectra of TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 films and these are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). A broad peak with maximum emission at 575 nm was observed for both TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 films. The TiO2 film showed higher PL intensity due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. The PL intensity decreased when a thin film of rGO was introduced onto the TiO2 film. This is mainly attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier at the rGO/TiO2 interface, which acts as an electron sink to effectively prevent the charge carrier recombination. Moreover, the rGO could act as a bridge to accelerate the electron transfer from the TiO2 to the electrode.
The enhancement in the Jsc and FF values may be attributed to the higher electron transfer efficiency driven by the Schottky barrier (formed due to the difference in energy levels between TiO2 and rGO) and the improved interface contact in the dye/rGO/TiO2 junction of the DSSC. The potential of rGO was found to be higher than that of TiO2, indicating a potential drop to drive electrons from rGO to TiO2 in this junction. In device B, the quasi-Fermi level of the rGO is shifted upward after the injection of the photogenerated electrons from the LUMO level of dye molecules, which were adsorbed onto the rGO film through π–π interactions. As a result, on the dye/rGO/TiO2 interface, the electrons can easily be transported from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2, driven by the internal potential difference, and consequently enhancing the Jsc value. Therefore, we assume that a Schottky barrier formed between rGO and TiO2 plays an important role in enhancement of transport efficiency of photogenerated electrons from the dye.
To understand the different Jsc values of the DSSCs fabricated with different photoanodes, i.e. TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 hybrid, the IPCE spectra were measured. Fig. 8b shows the IPCE spectra of devices A and B. The IPCE values at each wavelength are higher for device B as compared to device A. In general, the IPCE value of the DSSC depends on the light harvesting efficiency of dye sensitized photoanode, the efficiency of electron injection, and the efficiency of collecting photoinjected electrons at the FTO surface. The IPCE spectra of both DSSCs closely resemble the absorption spectrum of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, indicating that Jsc and IPCE values mainly originate from the light harvesting of dye adsorbed by the photoanode films upon light illumination. The increase in the values of IPCE is consistent with the Jsc values.
It is well known that the Jsc value of DSSC is associated with the number of injected electrons collected by the FTO, while the Voc value corresponds to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 under illumination and the Nernst potential of the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte. Almost the same value of Voc for both devices reveals that the incorporation of rGO does not influence the Fermi level of rGO/TiO2, which is consistent with the other reports.45 On the other hand, the Jsc value has been significantly improved with the incorporation of the rGO layer between the dye and TiO2, which is attributed to the collection of electrons by the FTO electrode. Two possible factors may contribute to the increase in the number of electrons by the incorporation of the rGO layer: (i) increasing the amount of dye sensitizer adsorbed onto the photoanode and thus increasing the excited electrons from the dye sensitizer to the conduction band of TiO2, and (ii) enhancing the electron transfer from TiO2 to the FTO surface. We have measured the amount of dye loading for both photoanodes using a dye desorption method and found that the amounts of dye loading are almost the same, indicating that the introduction of the rGO layer does not increase the number of photoinjected electrons from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. In other words, the increase in the Jsc value may be attributed to the enhancement of electron transfer from TiO2 to the photoanode due to the formation of a Schottky barrier in device B.46
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a useful tool to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes occurring in DSSCs, such as charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte junction, electron transport in the TiO2 electrode, electron transfer at the counter electrode, and I3− transport in the electrolyte.47 We recorded the EIS data by subjecting the DSSC to illumination (100 mW cm−2) and using a forward bias at the Voc of the DSSC (under the condition of no current), to better manifest the process at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface of the device under operation. The Nyquist plots of EIS of the DSSCs under different conditions are shown in Fig. 9 and exhibit clearly three semicircles in the frequency range investigated (0.1 Hz to 100 kHz). The small semicircle, on the right side of the spectrum, occurs in the lowest frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 Hz and corresponds to the charge Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte. The larger semicircle, in the middle frequency range, is related to the charge transfer processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and another smaller semicircle, on the left side of the spectrum, at even higher frequencies, is associated with the charge transfer process at the platinum counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The DSSC with rGO/TiO2 photoelectrode shows a smaller middle semicircle, thus, a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) than that for the TiO2 photoelectrode. The smaller Rct of the DSSC based on rGO/TiO2indicates the more efficient generation of electrons and thus, the larger electron collection at the TiO2/rGO/dye/electrolyte interface, which results in higher Jsc and PCE values. We have also estimated the values of chemical capacitance (Cμ) for both the DSSCs and these are compiled in Table 5. The value of Cμ is higher for device B as compared to device A, consistent with the trends reported in literature.43d As shown in Bode phase plots (Fig. 9b), the characteristic peak for the electron transport process of rGO/TiO2 photoanode is shifted to lower frequency compared to the pristine TiO2 photoanode. Every shift of the peak from high frequency to low frequency reveals a more rapid electron transport process, because the characteristic frequency (fc) in the middle frequency region can be related to the inverse of electron lifetime (τn) in TiO2 film according to the equation: τn = ½πfc. The calculated electron lifetimes of TiO2 and rGO/TiO2 DSSCs were found to be 23 and 32 ms, respectively. This further confirms that incorporation of the rGO layer accelerates the electron transfer from TiO2 to the photoelectrode, leading to the reduction of the recombination of injected electrons with I3− in the redox couple. We have also plotted the Nyquist plots of EIS in the dark at a dc voltage equivalent to the open circuit voltage of the devices, and similar shapes of the plots to those obtained under illumination were observed (not shown); the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) values of both devices were estimated (compiled in Table 5). It was found that Rrec is higher for device B as compared to that of device A. The higher value of Rrec indicates that the recombination of injected electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 with I3− in the redox couple is suppressed. The electron transport time (τd) and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) were estimated from the expressions: τd/τn = Rct/Rrec, and ηcc = 1 − τd/τn, respectively. The values of Rct, Rrec, τn, τd and ηcc are summarized in Table 5. The values of electron transport time and charge collection efficiency are significantly lower and higher, respectively, for devices A and B, providing an explanation of the higher values of Jsc and PCE for device B as compared to those of device A.

It can be seen from Table 4 that FF has also been increased from 0.70 (device A) to 0.75 (device B). It is well known that the FF of a DSSC is affected by the series resistance arising from the internal resistance of the device.48 The increase in the FF for device B may be attributed to the reduction of recombination of the injected electrons with the redox couple due to the formation of a conductive layer, when rGO is inserted between TiO2 and dye.
Due to the excellent electrical conduction, the two-dimensional rGO bridges behave as an electron transfer channel, which can transport the photoinduced electrons quickly. Under illumination, the electrons depart from the photoexcited dye. Because the TiO2 is anchored with two-dimensional rGO, and rGO is homogeneous in the system, the injected electrons are captured by the rGO without any obstruction. The collected electrons can transport from TiO2 to the conductive surface quickly and effectively through the rGO bridges, and adverse reactions (recombination and back reaction) are suppressed, leading to the enhancement in FF.
Conclusions
We have synthesized a porphyrin-BODIPY triad PorCOOH-(BDP)2, in which a metal-free porphyrin unit is covalently bridged with two BODIPY chromophores by a 1,3,5-triazine moiety. The photophysical and electrochemical measurements of PorCOOH-(BDP)2 along with theoretical calculations reveal that it has suitable energy levels for efficient electron injection and regeneration processes, when used as a sensitizer for DSSCs. The DSSCs based on pristine TiO2 (device A) and rGO/TiO2 (device B) photoanodes sensitized by this porphyrin-BODIPY triad, resulted in PCE values of 5.17% and 6.20%, respectively. The higher PCE value for device B is attributed to the formation of a Schottky barrier between rGO and TiO2 which facilitates the electron transport towards the FTO surface more efficiently, due to the internal field as evidenced by the reduction of charge transfer resistance, and electron transport time. This PCE value for the DSSC based on the porphyrin-BODIPY triad is higher than that of a single porphyrin moiety. Furthermore, these results provide new directions and ideas for further improvement.
