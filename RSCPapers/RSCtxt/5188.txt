    , Accepted 23rd February 2023First published on 23rd February 2023AbstractThe vinylene-bridged helical perylene diimide dimer (PDI2) and its derivatives have manifested great promise for applications in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, their performance in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) has been somewhat overlooked and is underdeveloped. Here two PDI2 derivatives, namely MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2, were constructed by installation of a benzimidazole or difluorobenzimidazole group at one of the four imide groups. Compared with the parent PDI2, both MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2 exhibit bathochromic shifts of the absorption maxima and deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. Solution processed OFETs using these two compounds as well as PDI2 were demonstrated and a remarkable electron mobility of up to 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved for FMBI-PDI2.
1. Introduction
Perylene diimide (PDI) and its derivatives have demonstrated considerable applications in the past few decades, such as in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),1–6 organic solar cells (OSCs)7–12 and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)13–16 due to their large π-conjugated structure, paragon photochemical stability and excellent electron acceptability.17–23 Compared to the parent PDI, the PDI dimer (PDI2), which consists of PDI panels fused together by ethylene bridges, not only inherits the properties of PDI, which is a robust, versatile class of aromatic electron-transport material with excellent thermal and oxidative stability and high electron affinity, but also shows weaker self-aggregation, higher electron mobility and wider absorption range due to its twisted π-extension;24–26 therefore its derivatives have demonstrated respectable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in OSCs.27–33 Nevertheless, the performance of PDI2 in OFETs has been somewhat overlooked and is underdeveloped, because the large and planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were generally regarded as an ideal design for efficient charge transport in OFETs. Recently, non-flat polyaromatics have been considered to give co-facial packing due to the self-complementarity in shape and thus a strong electronic coupling, which is beneficial for charge transport.34,35 Also these materials are more soluble and less likely to excessively aggregate compared to flat aromatics, allowing for solution-based processing of materials.36–44 In recent years, most PDI2 derivatives with electronic mobilities have been reported with mobilities varying from 10−4 to 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 under different deposition methods.33,44–47 Besides, Zhaohui Wang's group reported a high electric mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1.48 Therefore, the systematic study of PDI2 and PDI2 derivatives is of great significance for the design of higher performance n-type channel materials.49–54 Besides, arisen as a novel design strategy, the installation of a benzimidazole group at the imide position of PDI with broken symmetry structure not only exhibits enhanced natural dipole moment and stronger intermolecular binding energy, but also results in a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level due to the electron-deficient imine (–N) moiety, which may enhance the performance of devices.49,55–66 Moreover, substitution with strong electron-withdrawing fluorine groups will facilitate the device stability due to extended π-systems with excellent channel activity.9,60,67
Based on the above considerations, in the present research, structures which were equipped with a mono-benzimidazole group or mono-difluorobenzimidazole group at one of the four imide groups of PDI2, namely MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2, were designed and synthesized (Scheme 1). Both MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2 demonstrate pronounced redshift of absorption maxima and deeper LUMO energy level compared with PDI2. The solution-processed OFET device of MBI-PDI2 gave a high electron mobility of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. Moreover, the difluorobenzimidazole substitution is obviously beneficial to improve the device performance and an electron mobility of up to 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for FMBI-PDI2. The outstanding charge transport ability of FMBI-PDI2 could be ascribed to the preferred molecular orientation and better π-stacking induced by fluorinated substituents, which has been confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).

2. Experimental
Materials
Unless otherwise noted, solvents and starting materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further treatment. All chemical reactions were carried out in oven-dried or flame-dried glassware.
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DRX 500 or Varian Mercury plus-400. The MALDI-TOF mass spectra were measured with an AB Sciex 5800 and the DCTB matrix of reflector mode and cationic mode were used in the MALDI-TOF experiment. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 or Shimadzu UV-3600 plus. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. A three-electrode one-compartment cell containing a solution of the analyte and supporting electrolyte (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, (nBu4NPF6), 0.1 M) in dry CH2Cl2 was utilized. The three electrodes were a 500 μm diameter platinum-disk as the working electrode, a platinum-wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The measurements were obtained under a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. We calculated the LUMO levels from the onset wave reduction potential using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple as a standard. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TA Instruments SDT Q-600 under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The AFM images were recorded by using a Dimension Icon AFM (Bruker) by using the scan mode. The XRD data were obtained by using a Bruker AXS D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, all the samples were spin coated on the substrates. GIWAXS was tested using a Xeuss 3.0 SAXS/WAXS with an Eiger2R 1M detector in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Fabrication of the OFET device
To evaluate the semiconducting properties of the compounds, bottom-gate–top-contact (BGTC) OFET devices with FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 as channel materials were fabricated. A highly doped silicon wafer, with 300 nm thickness SiO2, thermally grown (Ci = 11 nF cm−2), was pretreated by the following process: deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were used for ultrasonic cleaning of the substrate for 15 min, respectively; next, the clean SiO2/Si substrate was treated in piranha solution (composed of 7:3 H2SO4/H2O2, v/v) for 30 min and then was washed with deionized water and IPA; third, octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was deposited on the piranha solution-treated substrate to passivate the hydroxyl groups on the substrate. The FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 were prepared in solutions with the concentration of 5 mg mL−1 and the solvent was chloroform with stirring at room temperature for 5 h. Then, thin-films were spin-coated on the OTS-modified SiO2 dielectric layer at 5000 rpm for 50 s. The gold source/drain electrodes (W/L = 50 μm/6000 μm) with 30 nm thickness under a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa and a deposition rate of 0.1–0.2 Å s−1 were thermally evaporated onto the as-cast or thermally annealed (at 180, 220, and 260 °C for 10 min, respectively) semiconducting layers to accomplish the OFET fabrication.
Characterization of the OFET device
The OFET devices were tested using a Keithley 4200SCS analyzer under vacuum conditions. All the devices exhibited n-channel transporting characteristics and the saturation mobility was derived from the equation: , where ID is the drain current, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric, μ is the field effect electron mobility, and VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold voltages, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic process of FMBI-PDI2 is outlined in Scheme 2. The precursor 1 and MBI-PDI2 were synthesized according to the previous literature.33,63 Using the same synthesis procedure of MBI-PDI2, FMBI-PDI2 was synthesized by reaction between 1 and 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diamine in propanoic acid at room temperature for 4 h, with a 30% yield as a purple solid. Similar to other asymmetrical benzimidazole-modified PDIs, FMBI-PDI2 may have isomers as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). These two target compounds were fully identified using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and a DCTB matrix of a reflector and cationic mode were used in the MALDI-TOF experiment (Fig. S8–S10, ESI†). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere was carried out to investigate the thermal properties of these two compounds FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in the TGA curves, the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of these two molecules are all over 390 °C, implying that both of these two compounds possess great thermal stability.

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the chemical geometry structures and the molecular frontier orbitals of FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (Table S3, ESI†). The alkyl side chain was replaced with an isopropyl group to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 1, FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 molecules all display the X-shaped configuration with dihedral angles of 23.80° and 23.51° and are similar to the building block PDI2 (23.44°), indicating that installation of a difluorobenzimidazole or benzimidazole group at the imide group has little effect on the molecular configuration. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), these molecules show obvious differences in the frontier molecular orbital distributions and the calculated molecular orbital energy levels. For PDI2, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the LUMO are uniformly distributed on the entire molecular framework due to its symmetrical configuration. However, as for FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2, the LUMOs are mainly localized on the PDI subunit containing benzimidazole, while the contribution of the other PDI panels is negligible. The HOMOs of FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 are located on PDI2 and the contribution of the benzimidazole unit is inappreciable. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 are −5.90/−3.66, −5.81/−3.58 and −5.98/−3.58 eV, respectively.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized absorption and emission spectra of PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2 are shown in Fig. 2a and b, and the relevant parameters of these compounds are summarized in Table 1. These three molecules show a broad absorption in the range from 350 to 750 nm. For FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2, both of them feature three intense absorptions at around 400, 510 and 540 nm in the film state and a fluorescence maximum of around 590 nm. At the same time, redshifts of the absorption and emission spectra of FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 are observed compared with PDI2, and these larger redshifts in benzimidazole-based FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 can be explained by an effective extension of the π-system of PDI2.57 In comparison with those in the solutions, the absorptions of thin films show redshifts and broadening indicating reasonable intermolecular aggregation (Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, fused benzimidazole moieties better achieve bathochromic shifts in the absorption and emission spectra as compared to the imide group. Interestingly, MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2 have similar lengths of conjugation and exhibit similar absorption spectra, indicating that fluorine substituents at benzimidazole do not impact the electronics of the singular chromophore.15 According to the onset of absorption, the optical band gaps are 1.92, 1.92 and 2.15 eV with FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2, respectively, which coincide well with the DFT calculations.

To investigate the electrical properties of PDI2, FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were measured. All the compounds exhibit four reversible reduction waves, while no oxidation waves are observed upon an anodic scan up to 2.00 V (Fig. 2c). The LUMO energy levels derived from the onset of the reduction potential (Eonsetred) are −3.87, −3.87 and −3.79 eV for FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2, respectively (Table 1). Accordingly, the respective HOMO energy levels are deduced as −5.79, −5.79 and −5.94 eV for FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2, respectively, based on the equation HOMO = LUMO − Eoptg, in which Eoptg is the optical energy gap determined from the lowest-energy absorption onset. By attaching benzimidazole moieties at the imide positions for FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2, the LUMO energy levels are lowered by around 0.08 eV. The low-lying LUMO energy levels of FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 point out their remarkable potential for n-channel OFETs.68,69
OFET characteristics
Bottom-gate top-contact (BGTC) OFETs were fabricated to investigate the charge transport properties. FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 chloroform solutions (5 mg mL−1) were first spin-coated onto octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified SiO2/Si substrates (optimized thickness = 20–30 nm) and the resulting thin films were annealed for 10 min at different temperatures in a glovebox. Finally, gold source/drain electrodes were thermally evaporated onto the semiconductor film to define the channel region. The detailed device optimization process is elaborated in the experimental section. The transport characteristics of all the devices annealed at different temperatures are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Representative transfer and output characteristics of OFETs based on FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 are given in Fig. 3.

The electron mobilities shown in Table 2 are distinct in these three compounds. The devices fabricated with MBI-PDI2 showed better performance compared with PDI2, and the thin films of MBI-PDI2 displayed an electron mobility of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 when annealed at 220 °C. This can be rationalized by the fact that the installation of a benzimidazole group in MBI-PDI2 was beneficial to larger π-stacking. Interestingly, the performance of MBI-PDI2 dropped sharply when the temperature was higher, especially when the annealing temperature reached 260 °C, which may be caused by the inappropriate high temperature and there were adverse influences on the surface morphology of the films, such as the stacking morphology destruction (Table S1, ESI†). Moreover, the 220 °C annealed FMBI-PDI2 thin film exhibited an optimal mobility of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is competitive among the performances of perylene diimide-based devices (Table S2, ESI†).33,45–48 Due to the installation of benzimidazole and difluorobenzimidazole, the LUMO energy levels of PDI2 derivatives decrease and well match with the work functions of gold source and drain electrodes. In addition, FMBI-PDI2 showed not only an enhanced electronic mobility, but also a high Ion/Ioff ratio of 106 and a low threshold voltage of 14 V. During the device optimization, FMBI-PDI2 showed extraordinary thermal stability, enabling it to maintain excellent electronic mobility even at higher annealing temperatures (Fig. S4–S6, ESI†).

Thin film morphology characteristics
The microstructure morphologies of the semiconductor layer play an important role in determining the performance of OFETs. To better understand how the benzimidazole and fluorine group-fused molecules affect the OFETs’ characteristics, we used AFM to investigate the morphology of thin films of PDI2 and its derivatives under different annealing temperatures (Fig. 4 and Fig. S7, ESI†). The film morphology in the case of PDI2 does not exhibit the evident sharp grain boundaries. The crystallite sizes of FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 films tend to grow with increasing annealing temperature. As for Fig. 4b and c, there exist small different film morphologies between the films of FMBI-PID2 and PDI2 in their optimum annealing temperature, but the 260 °C thermally annealed MBI-PDI2 film gives a discontinuous grain morphology, resulting in attenuated electronic mobility (Fig. S7, ESI†). In the case of the FMBI-PDI2, a uniform and regular nanostructure of the surface is observed at an annealing temperature of 220 °C, which is conducive to carrier migration.
 Fig. 4  The AFM images of thin-films based on FMBI-PDI2, MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 at their respective optimum annealing temperatures (area size 5 μm × 5 μm). 
The electronic mobility was significantly increased by thermal annealing, which could be ascribed to improved semiconducting film crystallinity. The non-normalized XRD spectra of the substrates were obtained; as shown in Fig. 5, there exist different film morphologies between the films of benzimidazole-fused PDI2 derivatives and PDI2 at their different annealing temperatures. Although weak diffraction peaks are observed, thin films of FMBI-PDI2 show obvious fluctuation at 3.61°, while the other two materials MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 show no characteristic peaks, indicating that FMBI-PDI2 shows better crystallization performance compared with the other two materials. Therefore, the poor electronic mobilities may be rationalized by less crystallization of MBI-PDI2 and PDI2 films.

To further investigate the influence of fused benzimidazole and fluorine groups on the molecular packing and the orientation of PDI2, the GIWAXS analysis of out-of-plane and in-plane thin-films was performed. As shown in Fig. 6, the in-plane profiles of both films have the same (0h0) diffraction peaks, implying that the lamellar spacing remained unchanged upon installation of a benzimidazole or difluorobenzimidazole group. In addition, compared with PDI2, both FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 show the (100) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane direction and larger relative intensity of (100) signals versus (0h0) peaks were observed, which may demonstrate that edge-on and face-on molecular orientations coexist, but the ratio of edge-on molecular orientation is increased for MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2 films. These results indicate that the crystals in the films of FMBI-PDI2 and MBI-PDI2 became more preferable and the crystallinity and the π–π interaction were enhanced, which was beneficial to the charge transportation in the films.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized two asymmetric PDI2 derivatives MBI-PDI2 and FMBI-PDI2 as efficient n-type semiconductors. MBI-PDI2- and FMBI-PDI2-based OFET devices all showed enhanced electron mobility compared to the initial PDI2 and an optimal μe of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 was observed for FMBI-PDI2 due to its low-lying LUMO energy and rational microstructure morphology. The AFM, XRD and GIWAXS characterizations reveal that FMBI-PDI2 thin films exhibit higher crystallinity and typical lamellar crystallization behavior that may contribute to their excellent electron transport properties. In brief, this work introduced a facile modification strategy for PDI2 and the resulting compounds displayed promising potential in OFETs.
