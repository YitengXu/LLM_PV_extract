    , Accepted 2nd June 2012First published on 8th June 2012AbstractA new type of bilayered photoanodes with cubic CeO2 nanoparticles as mirror-like scattering thin layers was prepared via a screen-printing technique for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The light harvesting efficiency was significantly enhanced due to the mirror-like light scattering effect, resulting in noticeable ∼17.8% improvement of light-to-electric conversion efficiency.
Since the development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 DSSC technology has been regarded as one of the promising clean photovoltaic technologies due to their low cost and relatively high efficiency.1 Although numerous oxide systems have been tested in order to obtain efficient light-to-electric conversion in DSSCs,2–4 mesoporous crystalline TiO2 is still the most convincing material for DSSC photoanodes.5 However, due to the small size ranging from 20 to 30 nm, TiO2 nanoparticles are weak light scatters in the visible light region, hence a large portion of light passes through the TiO2 film, which results in low light harvesting efficiency.6 One effective method to increase power conversion efficiency is to increase the light harvesting capability of photoanodes by introducing an optical scattering layer.7,8 So far, bifunctional TiO2 structures such as mesoporous microspheres,9 hollow microspheres10 and hemispheres11 have been investigated because they can efficiently localize incident light within the electrodes. However, the light scattering effect and packing density of the bilayered structure are still not very sufficient due to the point-to-point contact of spherical scattering particles. Hence, more efficient light scattering materials and effective light scattering structure are still in need and TiO2 nano-facets with the planar scattering effect has been reported recently.12
Cerium dioxide normally possesses a cubic nanostructure and has long been considered as a useful material for high-refractive-index film in single and multi-layer optical coatings.13 Hence, novel bilayered photoanodes constructed from nanocubic CeO2 particles with large mirror-like facets are expected to be a good choice to achieve more efficient light harvesting for benefiting DSSCs performance. However, cubic CeO2 nanoparticles have not found wide application as light scattering materials because they tend to form large aggregates and the packing density in the films is often quite loose.13 In this communication, we introduce a sub-micrometer-sized CeO2 thin layer (1.5 μm) onto the top of a dense TiO2 layer via a screen-printing method for DSSCs application. It is expected that, when a back-illumination approach is used, such larger cubic nanoparticles with exposed mirror-like facets could act alike mirror reflecting/scattering, which will lead to high light harvesting efficiency. A proposed schematic diagram for the mirror-like scattering effect in the bilayered photoanode is shown in Fig. 1.

The hydrothermally prepared cubic CeO2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of ∼400 nm are coated onto the mesoporous TiO2 paste layer via a screen-printing technique. The bilayered DSSCs with CeO2 top layers of only 1.5 μm exhibit a 17.8% improvement in the power conversion efficiency: 8.6% versus 7.3% for the reference cell made of pure TiO2 photoanodes. We attribute this improvement to the efficient light harvesting via mirror-like light scattering despite the fact that the dye loading amount in bilayered photoanodes is slightly reduced.
Cubic CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O in alkaline solution at 180 °C for 24 h.14 The precipitated nanoparticles were then post-treated with H2O2 (37%)15 and annealed at 450 °C for 1 h. Finally, the as-obtained CeO2 particles were mixed with ethanol, ethyl cellulose and alpha-terpineol to make a viscous paste using a rotary evaporator. For photoanode preparation, briefly, TiO2 films were screen-printed on pre-cleaned FTO glass with commercial TiO2 paste. The printing processes were repeated until a thickness of 12 μm was obtained. Subsequently the resultant films were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, designated as control films. The CeO2 top layers were deposited onto the TiO2 control films using a standard 43 mesh screen-printing machine then annealed at 450 °C for 1 h to remove the organic solvent. This process was repeated for a double-layer CeO2 film. The resulting film is marked as modified film (1L) and (2L), respectively. More details are given in ESI.†
The crystallinity of the photoanodes was characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as shown in Fig. 2. It is clear that the control films were composed of the TiO2 anatase–rutile mixture,7 whist typical cubic-phase CeO2 peaks corresponding to the dominant 111, 200 and 220 facets16 were observed for the modified films. The surface and cross-sectional structures of the photoanodes were characterized using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the images are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The overview of a bilayered photoanode (Fig. 3a) clearly revealed that a thin CeO2 film was evenly coated on the surface of a dense TiO2 layer. High magnification images shown in Fig. 3b and c indicated that the average thickness of the cubic CeO2 layers for 1 layer and 2 layers were ca. 1.5 μm and 2.8 μm, respectively. The average size of the large CeO2 particles is about 400 nm, which are well fitted in the particle size range for visible light scattering theoretically.17 The CeO2 coatings are quite densely packed, which is expected to lead to reduced dye loading capacity due to the larger particle size of CeO2 compared to that of TiO2.

The specific surface areas were then measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the value for the control film and modified films are 59 m2 g−1, 57 m2 g−1 (1L), and 50 m2 g−1 (2L), respectively. The following dye loading measurement of the prepared photoanodes was carried out by desorbing the absorbed dye in a 0.1 M NaOH solution and then measured by using a UV-vis spectrometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu). The calculated dye loading amounts for the 3 types of photoanodes are listed in Table 1. With 1 layer coating, there is a slight decrease in the dye loading amount, while for the modified film with 2-layer coating, an ∼7% decrease in the dye loading amount was observed. The densely packed top layer of large CeO2 particles may make the dye molecules more difficult to diffuse into the TiO2 porous layers efficiently. As a result, even though the thickness of the TiO2 layer was unchanged, reduced dye-loading was obtained.

The light scattering effect was evaluated by measuring the diffuse reflectance of three types of photoanode films. The films prepared on FTO substrates were scanned on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere accessory. As shown in Fig. 4, in comparison with the pure nanocrystalline TiO2 control film, the modified films with CeO2 surface coating showed remarkable improvement of light reflectance in the visible light region from 400 to 800 nm. In particular, the light reflectance of over 70% was achieved for the 2-layer CeO2 coating. This remarkable reflectance is obviously attributed to the strong mirror-like scattering with the large cubic CeO2 facets (inset image), on which the incident light can directly be reflected backwards to the nanoporous TiO2 when illumination is applied, as proposed schematically in Fig. 1. The mirror-like scattering could reduce the reflective distance in comparison with the spherical scattering17 and provide a short pathway for the reflective light to reach the dye on the TiO2 surface. In other words, the reflective light flux was enhanced at the dye-anchored surface of the nanoporous TiO2 film. With the thickness increase of the CeO2 coating film, the scattering intensity was further enhanced (2L film).

The photoanodes with CeO2 scattering layers were subsequently assembled into DSSCs to investigate the scattering effect on the photovoltaic performance, in comparison to the DSSCs using TiO2 control films. The photoanodes with a sensitized area of 0.15 cm2 were immersed into N719 dye solution (3 × 10−4 M in butanol and acetonitrile, 1:1, v/v) for 24 h and then configured into a typical sandwich DSSC using an I−/I3− electrolyte and a platinum counter electrode.18,19 The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The photovoltaic properties are compared with the corresponding dye-loading capacity of each photoanode. Since the nanocrystalline TiO2 is too small to sufficiently scatter visible light,20 the DSSC with control photoanodes shows the lowest overall efficiency (η) of 7.3% with a current density (Jsc) of 16.23 mA cm−2. Upon adding a 1-layer CeO2 scattering layer onto the TiO2 film, Jsc is significantly enhanced to 19.30 mA cm−2 with a Voc (open-circuit voltage) value of 690 mV and η of 8.6%. Because the dye loading amount was slightly reduced in the l-layer modified film, the efficiency enhancement can be directly attributed to the improved light confinement within the photoanode. However, with more CeO2 coating layers, the Jsc value was decreased because of the less dye loading amount resulting from smaller surface area. Therefore a lower conversion efficiency of 7.9% was achieved with the 2-layer CeO2 coating, although the corresponding reflectance was the highest among the 3 types of photoanodes. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the 1-layer CeO2 coating provides the optimal dual effects of the dye loading and optical scattering enhancement, resulting in a noticeable improvement in Jsc and η among the prepared photoanodes. For comparison, the DSSCs performance of TiO2 mixed with 5 mol% and 10 mol% CeO2 in a single layer fashion was also studied. It was clear that both light scattering effect and conversion efficiency of mixed photoanodes were lower than those of the bilayered photoanodes (Fig. S2 and S3 and discussion in the ESI† section).

The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra offer detailed information on the light harvesting of the DSSCs and the light scattering efficiency can be explained by the IPCE value in the longer wavelength region.9 It is observed in Fig. 6 that the overall IPCE increases considerably by introducing a scattering layer, and the DSSCs with modified films (1L) possess the highest IPCE values than that of the control films over the whole spectral range. More interestingly, DSSCs with modified film (2L) showed the highest IPCE value from 730 nm to 800 nm among 3 kinds of photoanodes. This can be attributed to the strongest light scattering effect of the modified film in the longer wavelength region, where the light absorption is weak so that the light scattering effect becomes more dominant in the IPCE performance.

In summary, cubic CeO2 nanoparticles with an average size of ∼400 nm was used as the mirror-like light scattering layers for CeO2–TiO2 bilayered photoanodes in DSSCs application. It was revealed that with increasing CeO2 top layer thickness in the photoanodes, the diffused reflective intensity increases while the dye-loading capacity decreases. Compared with the reference cell composed of pure TiO2 control films, the DSSCs assembled with 1.5 μm CeO2 top thin layers exhibited a remarkable 17.8% improvement in the power conversion efficiency due to the sparkling light scattering. This new approach may shed light on the efficiency improvement of DSSCs using a thin layer of well-defined faceted nanoparticles.
