    , Accepted 21st February 2019First published on 22nd February 2019AbstractNon-precious bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a pivotal role in regenerative fuel cells and rechargeable metal–air batteries. In this contribution, less active CeO2 is introduced for regulating the ORR/OER bifunctional activity of Co3O4@N-doped carbon (NC). The introduced CeO2 plays essential roles in increasing the surface contents of Co2+, Co3+ and N species in CeO2/Co3O4@NC for ORR/OER processes, while still maintaining hierarchical porosity and large specific surface area. Furthermore, the surface acid–base properties for the adsorption of oxygen molecules (for the ORR) and activation of water molecules (for the OER) and the charge transfer efficiency are also improved by the introduced CeO2. As a result, significantly enhanced ORR/OER bifunctional activity is achieved for the optimal and desired electrocatalyst, i.e., CeO2/Co3O4@NC. Its bifunctional activity is comparable or even superior to that of the benchmarked 20 wt% Pt/C (for the ORR) and IrO2 (for the OER), respectively. In the applications of Zn–air batteries, the battery with CeO2/Co3O4@NC still exhibits higher performance than the battery with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2, due to its outstanding bifunctional activity toward the ORR and OER.
1. Introduction
Development of sustainable and renewable energy is gaining momentum. Although the global installed capacity of renewable energy is rapidly growing, the real challenge comes when integrating renewable energy sources onto the grid due to their intermittent and variable nature. Advanced energy storage and conversion technologies including water splitting, fuel cells and metal–air batteries are thus needed to balance and utilize renewable energy on a large scale. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the core electrochemical processes in these aforementioned technologies. However, the ORR and OER are kinetically sluggish, limiting the energy conversion efficiency and hindering their practical applications.1 Therefore, highly efficient electrocatalysts are urgently required to promote the ORR and OER.2 Platinum (Pt) based and iridium (Ir) based electrocatalysts are commonly utilized owing to their excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR and OER, respectively.3,4 Unfortunately, the scarcity and high prices of these noble-metal-based electrocatalysts have hampered their large-scale applications. Another drawback associated with Pt and Ir is the poor durability caused by complicated degradation mechanisms during long-term electrochemical operation.5 As a result, non-precious metal electrocatalysts for both the ORR and OER with high efficiency, durability and low cost are highly desired.
For rechargeable metal–air batteries and regenerated fuel cells, a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst that can efficiently catalyze the ORR process during discharging and the OER process during charging is of great importance.6 In the past few decades, earth-abundant non-precious metal oxides (Co3O4, MnO2, Fe2O3, etc.) have been widely studied as ORR and/or OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes due to their low cost and environmental merits.7–9 Among them, Co3O4 with mixed valences of Co cations (i.e., Co2+ and Co3+) is considered to be a promising candidate for promoting both the ORR and OER.10,11 The Co2+ ions reside on 1/8 of the tetrahedral ‘A’ sites and the Co3+ ions occupy 1/2 of the octahedral ‘B’ sites.12,13 The presence of mixed valences of Co cations in the crystal structure could provide donor–acceptor chemisorption sites for the reversible adsorption of oxygen, thus favoring both the ORR and OER processes.14 However, the ORR/OER bifunctional activity of pure Co3O4 is still far from meeting the requirements of replacing precious metal based electrocatalysts due to the insufficient conductivity, relatively low SSAs and porosity.15 More importantly, the intrinsic ORR/OER activity of Co3O4 is lower than that of precious metals.16,17 Therefore, regulating active structures or increasing density of active sites is urgently required, and it is still challenging to further enhance the ORR and OER activity of Co3O4 simultaneously.
Herein, we constructed a Co3O4@NC composite to improve the conductivity, SSAs and porosity by combining the Co3O4 core with a N-doped carbon shell. Most importantly, CeO2 was then introduced to regulate the structure of Co3O4@NC due to its unique features, including high oxygen storage capability (OSC), tunable vacancies and redox properties.18 In our practical work, the Ce2+ and Co2+ cations were first used to coordinate with 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, thus constituting the precursor (CoCe) through simple reflux, which ensured the intimate contact of Co and Ce species. The precursor (CoCe) was then annealed at 600 °C in N2 to obtain the desired CeO2/Co3O4@NC nanocomposite. Electrochemical and physicochemical characterization techniques demonstrate that although CeO2 exhibits rather low ORR and OER activity, it plays essential roles in boosting the ORR/OER bifunctional activity for CeO2/Co3O4@NC. The bifunctional activity of CeO2/Co3O4@NC is comparable or even superior to that of the benchmarked 20 wt% Pt/C (for the ORR) and IrO2 (for the OER), respectively. When applied in Zn–air batteries, the battery with CeO2/Co3O4@NC still exhibits higher performance than the battery with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2. The important roles of CeO2 are also discussed specifically in the following text.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of electrocatalysts
The precursor (CoCe) was prepared using Co(NO3)2 6H2O and Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as metal sources. In a typical synthesis, 6.7 mmol of Co(NO3)2 6H2O and 3.3 mmol of Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing 10 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solution A. 1,2,4-Triazole (30 mmol), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (10 mmol) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, 2.40 g, Mw = 58000) were dissolved in another mixed solvent containing 20 mL of anhydrous methanol and 110 mL of DMF as solution B. Then, solution A was added dropwise to solution B under vigorous stirring. After stirring for another 30 min, the resulting mixed solution was refluxed at 90 °C for 4 h. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the resulting precursor (CoCe) was filtered and washed with anhydrous ethanol several times and then dried at 60 °C overnight. For comparison, the reference precursors, the precursor Co and the precursor Ce were prepared with similar procedures. To obtain the electrocatalysts, the three precursors were annealed at 600 °C in N2 for 2 h and labeled Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2, respectively. For further comparison, the three precursors were also annealed at 600 °C in air for 2 h. The products were referred to as Co-600Air, CoCe-600Air and Ce-600Air, respectively.
2.2 Structural characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a diffractometer (D/max-2500/PC X-ray, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). The Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw in Via, Renishaw, UK), using a laser (633 nm) as the light source. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on an ESCALAB 250 XPS photoelectron spectrometer with an Al-Kα X-ray source (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) at a constant pass energy of 30 eV. The binding energies of elements were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on a microscope (JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using a sorption analyzer at 77.3 K (ASAP 2460, Micromeritics, US). The specific surface areas were determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model. The pore size distribution of mesopores was calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and the pore size distribution of micropores was calculated by the Horvath–Kawazoe (H–K) method. The CO2-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was carried out on a TPD apparatus (TP-5080, Tianjin Xianquan instrument, China). First, the sample was pretreated from room temperature to 200 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and then kept at this temperature for 1 h in pure Ar. After cooling to 100 °C, the atmosphere was switched to CO2 (5% vol)/Ar at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. After 30 min, the sample was purged with pure Ar for 1 h at 100 °C. When the baseline was stable, the sample was heated to 400 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was also performed on the same TPD apparatus as follows. Before each NH3-TPD measurement, the sample was pretreated in a flow of Ar at 600 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to 100 °C. The NH3 adsorption was performed by passing a gas mixture of NH3 (5% vol)/Ar at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. After 30 min, the sample was purged with pure Ar for 1 h at 100 °C. When the baseline was stable, the sample was heated to 300 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were conducted using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) or a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) apparatus (AFMSRCE, PINE, USA) with a typical three-electrode configuration in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution (pH = ∼13) at room temperature. The apparatus was connected to a computer-controlled 760E potentiostat (CH Instruments). An Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode and a carbon rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All potentials measured in this work were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), referred to RHE conversion (ESI†).19
Prior to the electrochemical measurements, the working electrode was prepared as follows. Briefly, 2.5 mg of the as-prepared electrocatalysts and 50 μL of Nafion (5 wt%, Alfa Aesar) were dispersed in 1 mL anhydrous ethanol. After ultra-sonication for 30 min, a homogeneous electrocatalyst ink was obtained. Before the preparation of the working electrode, the glassy carbon (GC) electrode was polished to a mirror finish. Then, ∼20 μL of the ink was dropped onto the glassy carbon (GC) electrode (∼0.196 cm2) as the RDE and ∼25 μL of the ink was dropped onto the GC (∼0.247 cm2) as the RRDE. The electrocatalyst loadings for both electrodes are ∼0.24 mg cm−2. For comparison, the working electrodes with 20 wt% Pt/C (∼0.24 mg cm−2, i.e., ∼48 μgPt cm−2) and IrO2 (∼0.24 mg cm−2) were prepared using similar procedures.
For the ORR measurements, the CVs were recorded from −0.04 to 1.16 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with N2 bubbled until a stable CV profile was obtained. The background currents in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution were obtained at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The LSV curves were collected at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 at 400, 625, 900, 1225, 1600 and 2025 rpm in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The ORR durability was determined through the chronoamperometric tests at 0.66 V at 1600 rpm. The Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots are determined using the K–L equation as follows: (1)where j is the measured current density (mA cm−2), jk and jd are the kinetic and diffusion-limiting current densities (mA cm−2), respectively, n is the electron transfer number per O2 molecule, F is the Faraday constant, k is the electron transfer rate constant for O2 reduction, CO2 is the bulk concentration of oxygen in the electrolyte,20DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of the oxygen molecule in the electrolyte,20v is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte,21 and ω is the electrode rotation speed (rad s−1). For the RRDE measurements, the HO2−% and the electron transfer number (n) were determined using the following equations: (2) (3)where Id is the disk current density (mA cm−2), Ir is the ring current density (mA cm−2), and N is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring (∼0.37).
For the OER measurements, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded from 1.16 to 1.96 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte until a stable CV profile was obtained. Then, the linear-sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves were collected from 1.16 to 1.96 V at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 at 900, 1600 and 2500 rpm in the O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. The OER durability was determined through the chronoamperometric tests at 1.56 V at 1600 rpm.
For the Zn–air battery performance tests, 6 M KOH with 0.1 M ZnCl2 was used as the electrolyte. The as-prepared electrocatalyst ink was cast onto the carbon paper (Toray TGP-H-060) with a loading of ∼1.2 mg cm−2 to obtain the air electrode. A polished Zn plate (∼0.2 mm of thickness) was used as the anode. The battery performance tests were conducted on a computer-controlled 760E potentiostat (CH Instruments). For comparison, the Zn–air battery with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2 as an electrocatalyst was also tested under similar conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization of the electrocatalysts
The synthesis procedure of the electrocatalysts is illustrated in Scheme 1. The precursor (CoCe) was first prepared with Ce2+ and Co2+ through reflux at 90 °C. For comparison, the precursor Co and the precursor Ce were prepared under similar conditions with pure Ce2+ or Co2+, respectively. Then the precursors were annealed at 600 °C in N2 or air to obtain the resulting electrocatalysts. The detailed procedures are described in the experimental section.
 Scheme 1  Illustration of the synthesis of the electrocatalysts in N2 and air. 

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2. The diffraction peaks for face-centered cubic (fcc) Co (PDF#15-0806) and the hexagonal close packed (hcp) Co (PDF#01-1278) are observed in Co-600N2. By comparison, the distinct diffraction peaks for fluorite-type cubic CeO2 (PDF#34-0394) and the peaks attributed to Co3O4 (PDF#65-3103) are observed in CoCe-600N2, suggesting the coexistence of CeO2 and Co3O4 in CoCe-600N2. Ce-600N2 shows the single phase of fluorite-type cubic CeO2. The samples prepared in air have similar XRD patterns (Fig. S1a†) to the ones obtained in N2 except that the Co3O4 is included in Co-600Air in contrast to the metallic Co in Co-600N2. Notably, the Co3O4 is also obtained in CoCe-600N2 under the inert N2 atmosphere. These results suggest that the introduced CeO2 with high OSC could induce the formation of Co3O4 even in a N2 atmosphere.22 The Raman spectra of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2 are shown in Fig. 1b. All the samples show two distinct peaks at ∼1335 cm−1 and ∼1597 cm−1 which can be assigned to the D-band and G-band of the carbon matrices, respectively. The D- and G-bands are attributed to the defective and the ideal sp2 carbons, respectively.23 In general, the intensity ratio of the D and G bands (ID/IG) is used to indicate the defect fraction originating from nitrogen doping or other effects.24 The ID/IG value of CoCe-600N2 is ∼1.209, higher than those of Ce-600N2 (∼0.714) and Co-600N2 (∼0.890), suggesting the existence of more defects in the carbon matrices of CoCe-600N2. In addition to the D and G bands of the carbon matrices, the sharp A1g and the weak Eg, F12g and F22g bands for crystalline Co3O47,25,26 are observed in Co-600N2, implying the existence of a few amounts of Co3O4. Notably, the XRD patterns of Co-600N2 (Fig. 1a) do not show any obvious diffraction peaks attributed to Co3O4, suggesting that the amount of Co3O4 in Co-600N2 is much smaller than that of the bulk metallic Co. The A1g, Eg, F12g and F22g bands for Co3O4 are considerably enhanced in CoCe-600N2, likely due to the formation of larger amounts of Co3O4 in it (also refer to its XRD pattern in Fig. 1a). In Ce-600N2, the typical F2g mode at ∼464 cm−1 for CeO2 is observed, which is consistent with the XRD patterns. It is noteworthy that the F2g band of CeO2 is very close to the Eg band of Co3O4 at ∼470 cm−1. Thus, the F2g band of CeO2 in CoCe-600N2 may be partially overlapped with the Eg band of Co3O4. The D and G bands are not observed in Raman spectra of the samples prepared in air (Fig. S1b†), suggesting that the pure oxides (Co3O4, Co3O4/CeO2 and CeO2 for Co-600Air, CoCe-600Air and Ce-600Air, respectively) are obtained via the pyrolysis in air.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2 are shown in Fig. 1c. The solid and hollow marks represent the adsorption and desorption branches, respectively. The isotherms of the three samples show the typical I-type adsorption–desorption characteristic at the low relative pressure, suggesting the existence of micropores in the samples. The H3-type hysteresis loops at high relative pressures of Co-600N2 and CoCe-600N2 indicate that they contain the slit-shaped mesopores. Obviously, Ce-600N2 shows a different hysteresis loop (H2 type), likely related to the in-bottle-shaped mesopores in it.27,28 Thus, these isotherms suggest that these electrocatalysts possess hierarchical pores, i.e., mesopores/micropores, which are also confirmed by their pore distributions (Fig. 1d and Table S1†). Within the micropore region, the average pore sizes are ∼0.45 nm, ∼0.50 nm and ∼0.55 nm for Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2, respectively, while their mean mesopore sizes are estimated to be ∼2.39 nm, ∼2.23 nm, and ∼2.56 nm, respectively. The BET SSAs of Ce-600N2 and Co-600N2 are ∼287.1 m2 g−1 and ∼165.4 m2 g−1, respectively. After the introduction of CeO2, the CoCe-600N2 sample shows a slightly lager BET SSA of ∼173.5 m2 g−1 than Co-600N2, but still lower than that of Ce-600N2. The pore volume of CoCe-600N2 (∼0.38 cm3 g−1) is smaller than those of Co-600N2 (∼0.72 cm3 g−1) and Ce-600N2 (∼0.50 cm3 g−1). Notably, the BET SSAs and pore volumes of the samples prepared in air are much lower than those of the counterparts prepared in N2 (Fig. S1c and d, Table S1 and Note S1†), which indicates that the pyrolysis in N2 may contribute greatly to the large BET SSAs and hierarchical porosity of the resulting electrocatalysts.
The Co 2p XPS spectra of Co-600N2 and CoCe-600N2 are shown in Fig. 1e. The Co 2p spectra show two split spin–orbit components, namely, Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2.29 In the Co 2p3/2 peak (∼779 eV), the deconvoluted peaks at ∼778.1 eV, ∼779.7 eV and ∼781.6 eV can be attributed to Co0, Co3+ and Co2+, respectively, while the ones at ∼784.0 eV and ∼787.2 eV correspond to the two satellite peaks of Co2+ and Co3+, respectively,30–32 also shown in Table S2†. The Co 2p1/2 peak (∼796 eV) can be deconvoluted into four components, specifically, Co3+, Co2+ and satellite peaks of Co3+ and Co2+, respectively. In the Co 2p3/2 spectrum of CoCe-600N2, the peak for Co0 is hardly deconvoluted, which is due to the predominant amount of Co3O4 in it (refer to the XRD and Raman results in Fig. 1a and b, respectively). Obviously, compared to Co-600N2, the binding energies of Co2+ and Co3+ in the Co 2p3/2 spectrum of CoCe-600N2 have some shifts toward the lower binding energies. Specifically, the binding energy of Co2+ is shifted by ∼0.5 eV, while the binding energy of Co3+ is slightly lowered by ∼0.2 eV. Similar shifts of binding energy of Co species are also observed in the samples prepared in air (Co-600Air vs. CoCe-600Air, Fig. S1e and Table S2†). Fig. 1f shows the Ce 3d XPS spectra of CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2. The deconvoluted v1 and u1 peaks can be assigned to Ce3+, while the v, v2, v3, u, u2 and u3 peaks are ascribed to Ce4+.33,34 Notably, compared with Ce-600N2, the binding energy of Ce species (Ce4+ and Ce3+) in CoCe-600N2 is shifted toward the higher binding energy (Table S2†). Similar binding energy shifts are also observed in the samples prepared in air (Ce-600Air vs. CoCe-600Air, Fig. S1f and Table S2†). Accordingly, in consideration of the shifts of the binding energy of Co and Ce species discussed above, there might be some interactions between Co and Ce species.35,36
The N 1s XPS spectra of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2 are shown in Fig. 1g and Table S2†. The spectra can be fitted with four different N species, which are ascribed to pyridinic-N (∼398.4 eV), pyrrolic-N (∼399.4 eV), quaternary-N (∼400.9 eV) and oxidized-N (∼406.5 eV), respectively. The pyridinic-N and oxidized-N are dominant in Co-600N2 and CoCe-600N2, respectively. The Ce-600N2 sample shows the higher concentration of pyrrolic-N relative to the other N species. The two samples containing Ce (i.e., CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2) show an apparent peak for oxidized-N, while the Co-600N2 shows a negligible amount of oxidized-N (less than 0.01 at%). This suggests that the surface of Ce-600N2 and CoCe-600N2 has been partially oxidized due to the OSC and the redox property of CeO2.37
The O 1s XPS spectra of the samples can be deconvoluted into three main sub-peaks, denoted as O1, O2 and O3 (Fig. 1h), respectively. The O1 peak at ∼532.8 eV is attributed to the hydroxyl species or adsorbed H2O. The O2 peak around 531.3 eV is associated with the oxygen vacancies. The peak at ∼529.9 eV (O3) corresponds to the lattice oxygen in CeO2 and Co3O4.38 Generally, the O 1s binding energy of Co-600N2 is higher than that of Ce-600N2, while the O 1s binding energy of CoCe-600N2 falls in between those of Co-600N2 and Ce-600N2 (Fig. 1h, S1g, and Table S2†). The samples obtained in air share the same features (Note S1†). Similar binding energy shifts were previously observed in the literature.39 As shown in Table S3†, the CoCe-600 samples (CoCe-600N2 and CoCe-600Air) display higher O2 contents (∼9.16 and ∼6.22 at%, respectively) than the corresponding Ce-600 samples (∼7.90 at% for Ce-600N2 and ∼4.58 at% for Ce-600Air, respectively). Meanwhile, the Ce3+/Ce4+ ratios increase from ∼0.19 in Ce-600N2 to ∼0.26 in CoCe-600N2 and from ∼0.21 in Ce-600Air to ∼0.28 in CoCe-600Air, which indicates that the interactions between Co and Ce species may lead to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+.40 As a result, the formation of oxygen vacancies is induced to maintain the charge neutrality. These oxygen vacancies are essential for the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs,41 which may modulate the acid–base properties of the resulting electrocatalysts. Notably, the emerged O3 peak in Co-600N2 indicates the existence of lattice oxygen originated from the surface crystalline Co3O4, which is consistent with the aforementioned Raman and the following TEM results.
The CO2-TPD was used to characterize the surface basicity of the resulting electrocatalysts in this study. CO2-TPD results are shown in Fig. S1h† and 1i for the samples prepared in air and N2, respectively. The CO2 desorption peaks of Co-600Air, CoCe-600Air and Ce-600Air center at ∼146.2 °C, ∼206.9 °C and ∼173.4 °C, respectively. The higher peak temperature of CoCe-600Air than that of Co-600Air suggests that the surface basicity of Co-600Air has been enhanced after the introduction of CeO2.42 The calculated basicity amount of Co-600Air (∼0.03 mmol g−1) is much lower than that of Ce-600Air (∼0.25 mmol g−1). After the introduction of CeO2, the CoCe-600Air exhibits a basicity amount of ∼0.15 mmol g−1, which is lower than that of Ce-600Air but much higher than that of Co-600Air. These results indicate that the introduction of CeO2 could increase the basicity and base sites for CoCe-600Air. In comparison with the samples prepared in air, the CO2 desorption peaks of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2 center at ∼111.1 °C, ∼129.8 °C and ∼141.7 °C, respectively. The higher peak temperature of CoCe-600N2 than that of Co-600N2 suggests the enhanced basicity in CoCe-600N2. The calculated basicity amount of CoCe-600N2 is ∼0.18 mmol g−1, lower than that of Ce-600N2 (∼0.27 mmol g−1), and much higher than that of Co-600N2 (∼0.08 mmol g−1). The results suggest that the introduction of CeO2 could increase the basicity and the base sites for CoCe-600N2. In consideration of the similar results observed for CoCe-600Air, it is obvious that the coupling of Ce and Co species could increase the basicity and base sites in both CoCe-600Air and CoCe-600N2 compared to the ones without Ce species.
The NH3-TPD was used to characterize the surface acidity of the resulting electrocatalysts. The NH3-TPD results are shown in Fig. S1i† and 1j for the samples prepared in air and N2, respectively. The NH3 desorption peaks of CoCe-600Air center at ∼181.1 °C, which is slightly higher than that of Co-600Air (∼166.3 °C) and Ce-600Air (∼174.3 °C), indicating that the surface acidity of Co-600Air has been increased after the introduction of CeO2.42 The calculated acidity amount of CoCe-600Air is ∼0.39 mmol g−1, which is higher than that of Co-600Air (∼0.04 mmol g−1) and lower than that of Ce-600Air (∼1.24 mmol g−1). The NH3 desorption peaks of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2 center at ∼168.9 °C, ∼179.2 °C and ∼186.1 °C, respectively. The higher peak temperature of CoCe-600N2 than that of Co-600N2 suggests the enhanced acidity in CoCe-600N2. The calculated acidity amount of CoCe-600N2 is ∼0.56 mmol g−1, higher than that of Co-600N2 (∼0.31 mmol g−1) but still lower than that of Ce-600N2 (∼3.50 mmol g−1). Considering the higher acidity amount observed for CoCe-600Air than that of Co-600Air, it is clear that the introduction of CeO2 could increase the acidity and acid sites in both CoCe-600Air and CoCe-600N2 compared to their counterparts free of CeO2.
The TEM and HRTEM images of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2 and Ce-600N2 are shown in Fig. 2. The TEM image of Co-600N2 shows that many nanoparticles are distributed on the carbon matrices (Fig. 2a). The fcc/hcp hybrid Co core and the outer N-doped graphitic carbon shell constitute the core–shell hybrid nanostructure of Co-600N2 as revealed by its HRTEM image (Fig. 2b). The d-spacing values of core nanoparticles are ∼0.20 nm and ∼0.22 nm, which correspond to the fcc Co (111) and hcp Co (100), respectively. In addition, a few Co3O4 nanoparticles are found next to the Co nanoparticles (also refer to the Raman and XPS results in Fig. 1b and e, respectively). The d-spacing of those Co3O4 nanoparticles (∼0.29 nm) are assigned to the (220) plane. In CoCe-600N2, a similar core–shell hybrid nanostructure is also observed as shown in its TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 2c and d). In contrast to Co-600N2 with the inner metallic Co nanoparticles, the inner core of CoCe-600N2 is composed of Co3O4 nanoparticles, still wrapped by the graphitic NC shells (Fig. 2d). Notably, in CoCe-600N2, the CeO2 nanoparticles grew onto the NC shell and linked to the Co3O4 core. In other words, the CeO2 nanoparticles bridge the inner Co3O4 core and the outer NC shell. The d-spacing of ∼0.19 nm corresponds to the (220) plane of the fluorite-type cubic CeO2. The nanostructure of the Ce-600N2 is different from those of the two samples mentioned above. Fig. 2e and f show that it does not include the typical core–shell nanostructure. The CeO2 nanoparticles and nanorods locate at the inside and the edge zones of the large matrix particles, respectively. The HRTEM (Fig. 2f) further shows well-defined fringes of the nanoparticles, where the lattice fringe with a d-spacing of ∼0.31 nm is consistent with the (111) crystalline planes of CeO2 surrounded by the porous NC. The TEM and HRTEM images of the samples prepared in air (Fig. S2 and Note S1†) do not show a well-defined carbon matrix compared to their counterparts prepared in N2. In contrast to the fcc and hcp Co included in Co-600N2 (Fig. 2b), Co-600Air contains Co3O4 nanoparticles (Fig. S2b†). CoCe-600Air has the Co3O4/CeO2 composite nanoparticles with irregular morphologies (Fig. S2d†). In addition, Ce-600Air has a sheet-like structure, consisting of the aggregated CeO2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2f†). Notably, these nanoparticles formed in N2 and air atmospheres have inhomogeneous sizes (Fig. 2, S2 and S3†).

According to the discussion on the structures of the prepared samples, the desired electrocatalyst, i.e., CoCe-600N2, contains the hybrid nanostructure of CeO2/Co3O4@NC, while the reference ones include the hybrid nanostructure of Co@NC for Co-600N2 and CeO2@NC for Ce-600N2. The samples prepared in air have different nanostructures and compositions from their counterparts prepared in N2. Specifically, the CoCe-600Air comprises a composite of Co3O4/CeO2, while the Ce-600Air and Co-600Air consist of pure CeO2 and Co3O4, respectively.
3.2 ORR/OER activity and durability

Fig. 3a shows the LSV curves for Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2, Ce-600N2 and 20 wt% Pt/C. The ORR activity of Ce-600N2 is much lower than that of the other samples with a low onset potential of ∼0.80 V and half-wave potential (E1/2) of ∼0.68 V. Co-600N2 exhibits a higher ORR activity than Ce-600N2 with a more positive onset potential of ∼0.92 V and E1/2 of ∼0.77 V. The considerably improved ORR activity is achieved by CoCe-600N2 with a high onset potential of ∼0.97 V and E1/2 of ∼0.86 V, which are comparable to those of 20 wt% Pt/C (∼1.00 V and ∼0.89 V, respectively). The limiting current density of CoCe-600N2 is also larger than that of Ce-600N2 and Co-600N2. Thus, their ORR activity trend follows the order: CoCe-600N2 > Co-600N2 > Ce-600N2. In addition, the LSV curves of the samples obtained in air (Fig. S4a†) show a similar ORR activity trend (CoCe-600Air > Co-600Air > Ce-600Air, also refer to Table S4†) to their counterparts prepared in N2. But, the onset potential, E1/2, and the limiting current density of the samples obtained in air are smaller than those of their counterparts prepared in N2, indicating their lower ORR activity. Moreover, these results also demonstrate that the dual-metal-based samples (i.e., CoCe-600N2 and CoCe-600Air) are more favorable for the ORR as compared with the single-metal-based samples (i.e., Co-600N2, Ce-600N2, Co-600Air, and Ce-600Air).

(g) The chronoamperometry responses obtained on CoCe-600N2 and IrO2 at 1.55 V in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. 

Fig. 3b shows the mass diffusion-corrected Tafel plots of the resulting electrocatalysts prepared in N2. CoCe-600N2 displays a lower Tafel slope (∼65.3 mV dec−1) than Ce-600N2 (∼85.0 mV dec−1) and Co-600N2 (∼69.9 mV dec−1), which is comparable to that of 20 wt% Pt/C (∼62.1 mV dec−1), demonstrating its favorable ORR kinetics.43 By comparison, the Tafel slopes of the samples prepared in air (Fig. S4b and Table S4†) are higher than the corresponding counterparts prepared in N2, indicating their relatively inferior ORR kinetics. Among them, the dual-metal-based CoCe-600Air shows a lower Tafel slope (∼68.6 mV dec−1) than those of the single-metal-based Co-600Air (∼79.0 mV dec−1) and Ce-600Air (∼88.9 mV dec−1). Given the similar Tafel slope trend observed for the samples prepared in N2, the coupling of Co and Ce species may be favorable for the ORR kinetics.
The ORR selectivity and electron pathways of the resulting electrocatalysts were determined by RRDE measurements. The measured percentage of peroxide yield and the electron transfer number (n) is shown in Fig. 3c (for the electrocatalysts prepared in N2) and Fig. S4c† (for the ones obtained in air). The average yield of HO2− for CoCe-600N2 is less than ∼3.9% within the applied potential range, lower than that for Co-600N2 (∼10.0%) and Ce-600N2 (∼28.2%) and comparable to that for 20 wt% Pt/C (∼3.7%). The average electron transfer number is ∼3.94 for CoCe-600N2, larger than those for Co-600N2 (∼3.76) and Ce-600N2 (∼3.27) and comparable to that for 20 wt% Pt/C (∼3.97). These results suggest that CoCe-600N2 could catalyze the ORR through a nearly four-electron pathway with high selectivity.5,44 In contrast, the samples obtained in air exhibit a higher yield of HO2− and a smaller electron transfer number than those of their counterparts obtained in N2, suggesting their poorer ORR selectivity. Moreover, the dual-metal-based CoCe-600Air also presents a lower HO2− yield and larger electron transfer number than the single-metal-based Co-600Air and Ce-600Air, respectively (Fig. S4c†). Considering the similar results observed for the samples prepared in N2, it can be concluded that the resulting Co/Ce dual-metal-based electrocatalysts could exhibit greater ORR selectivity than the corresponding single-metal-based ones, demonstrating the benefits of coupling Co and Ce species.
Fig. S5† shows the K–L plots within the potential range from 0.05 to 0.55 V for the resulting electrocatalysts. Good linearity and parallelism are observed for CoCe-600N2, Co-600N2 and 20 wt% Pt/C, which are associated with the favorable first-order reaction kinetics towards the concentration of dissolved oxygen during the ORR process.45 In contrast, Ce-600N2 shows inferior linearity and parallelism, indicating its more complicated ORR kinetics.46 The linearity and parallelism of Co-600Air, CoCe-600Air and Ce-600Air are poorer than those of the samples prepared in N2 and 20 wt% Pt/C, suggesting their inferior ORR kinetics. Notably, the dual-metal-based CoCe-600N2 and CoCe-600Air deliver better linearity and parallelism than the corresponding single-metal-based ones, demonstrating that the coupling of Co and Ce species is favorable for ORR kinetics.
Additionally, the ORR LSV curves of Co-600N2, Ce-600N2 and CeCo-600N2 scanned in the acid electrolyte (0.1 M HClO4) have been recorded to compare with the ones scanned in the base electrolyte (0.1 M KOH), as shown in Fig. S6†. The onset potentials and E1/2 of the ORR LSV curves scanned in the acid electrolyte are much more negative than those of the ones obtained in the base electrolyte, suggesting that the electrocatalysts may not remain stable in the acid electrolyte.47
As discussed above, among the as-prepared electrocatalysts (both obtained in N2 and air), CoCe-600N2 shows the optimized ORR activity and selectivity. In addition to the high activity, good long-term durability is also required for an electrocatalyst to be applied in a real-life device. The ORR durability of CoCe-600N2 was measured by the chronoamperometry at 0.65 V. As shown in Fig. 3d, after 12 h of operation, CoCe-600N2 can retain over 90.8% of its initial current density, whereas a lower current density of ∼75.8% was observed for 20 wt% Pt/C, demonstrating the superior ORR durability of CoCe-600N2.

Fig. 3e shows the OER LSV curves of Co-600N2, CoCe-600N2, Ce-600N2 and IrO2. The potential needed to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10) is a key metric for the solar water-splitting device with an efficiency of 10% and generally used to assess the OER activity.48,49 The Ej=10 for CoCe-600N2 is ∼1.504 V, which is lower than those for Co-600N2 (∼1.551 V), Ce-600N2 (not available within the examined potential range) and the benchmarked IrO2 (∼1.581 V). As shown in Fig. 3f, the Tafel slope of CoCe-600N2 is ∼58.3 mV dec−1, which is lower than that of Co-600N2 (∼73.8 mV dec−1), Ce-600N2 (∼190.1 mV dec−1) and the benchmarked IrO2 (∼79.8 mV dec−1). This reveals the favorable OER kinetics for CoCe-600N2. In addition, the samples obtained in air have a higher Ej=10 and higher Tafel slopes (Fig. S7 and Table S4†) than their counterparts prepared in N2, demonstrating their lower OER activity and inferior kinetics. However, it is noteworthy that the OER activity order (i.e., CoCe-600Air > Co-600Air > Ce-600Air) of the samples prepared in air remains the same as that of the samples prepared in N2 (i.e., CoCe-600N2 > Co-600N2 > Ce-600N2). These results indicate that the synergistic effect of Co and Ce species could favor the OER electrocatalytic activity and kinetics for the resulting electrocatalysts. The optimized CoCe-600N2 also shows good OER durability during the chronoamperometric measurements at 1.55 V (Fig. 3g). Specifically, after a 12 h test, CoCe-600N2 can retain ∼98.2% of the initial current density, which is higher than the value for IrO2 (∼75.5%).
Moreover, the difference of the potentials between Ej=10 and E1/2 (ΔE) was used to evaluate the overall bifunctional activity for the resulting electrocatalysts. A smaller ΔE value suggests higher overall bifunctional activity.43 CoCe-600N2 shows a ΔE value of 0.64 V, smaller than that of Co-600N2 (0.78 V) and Ce-600N2 (N.A), indicating its superior overall bifunctional activity. By contrast, the ΔE values of the samples prepared in air (Table S4†) are much larger than the samples prepared in N2. But, CoCe-600Air exhibits a smaller ΔE value of 0.92 V than Co-600Air (1.06 V) and Ce-600Air (N.A). Given the similar results observed for the samples prepared in N2, it can be concluded that the combination of Co and Ce species is essential for boosting the overall bifunctional activity. Notably, the ΔE value of CoCe-600N2 is the smallest among the values of recently reported ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S5†), demonstrating its outstanding overall bifunctional activity toward both the ORR and OER.
Furthermore, the mass activity normalized to the mass loading at 0.76 V (ORR) and 1.7 V (OER) was used to further evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the resulting samples (Table 2). Obviously, the samples prepared in N2 show higher ORR and OER mass activity than their corresponding counterparts prepared in air. The highest ORR mass activity of 18.88 A gcat−1 and the OER mass activity of 446.04 A gcat−1 were achieved by CoCe-600N2, demonstrating its superior bifunctional ORR/OER activity. Moreover, the ORR/OER mass activity of the samples obtained in N2 still follows the order of CoCe-600N2 > Co-600N2 > Ce-600N2. In addition, the samples prepared in air also follow the similar ORR and OER mass activity order of CoCe-600Air > Co-600Air > Ce-600Air (Table S6†). These results above demonstrate the advantages of combining Co and Ce species for boosting both the ORR and OER.
3.3 Zn–air battery performance
Based on the results above, it is revealed that combining CeO2 and Co3O4 could significantly enhance the ORR/OER bifunctional activity. Especially, CoCe-600N2 shows the optimized ORR/OER activity and kinetics, which is comparable or superior to that of the benchmarked 20 wt% Pt/C (for the ORR) and IrO2 (for the OER). Zn–air battery tests were conducted to further evaluate the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of CoCe-600N2. Fig. 4a shows the typical polarization curves (V–i) and the corresponding power density plots of the Zn–air battery with CoCe-600N2 and mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2. The one with CoCe-600N2 exhibits a higher open circuit voltage of ∼1.41 V and a peak power density of ∼116.8 mW cm−2 than that with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2 (∼1.40 V and ∼110.2 mW cm−2, respectively). The discharge plateau voltage for the Zn–air batteries with CoCe-600N2 and mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2 is ∼1.27 V (Fig. 4b). The Zn–air battery with CoCe-600N2 exhibits a specific capacity and energy density of ∼634 mA h gZn−1 and ∼805 W h kgZn−1, respectively, larger than that with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2 (∼587 mA h gZn−1 and ∼745 W h kgZn−1, respectively). Fig. 4c shows the cycling performance of the rechargeable Zn–air batteries with CoCe-600N2 and mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2, respectively. The initial round-trip efficiency of the rechargeable Zn–air battery with CoCe-600N2 is ∼66%, which outperforms the efficiency of the one with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2 (∼62%). After 350 cycles, this value decreased to ∼49% for the Zn–air battery with CoCe-600N2 but is still higher than that of the Zn–air battery with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2 (∼37%). Therefore, thanks to the high bifunctional activity of CoCe-600N2 toward the ORR and OER, the Zn–air battery with it exhibits good performance, which is comparable to the performance of Zn–air batteries with recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (Table S7†).

3.4 Brief discussion on the important effects of CeO2
The results discussed above demonstrate that the less active CeO2 plays important roles in the enhanced bifunctional activity of CeO2/Co3O4@NC. Fig. 3, Tables 1 and 2 show that Ce-600N2 delivers a much lower ORR/OER apparent activity and mass activity than Co-600N2. Similar results are observed in their counterparts prepared in air (Fig. S4 and S7, Tables S4 and S6†). A much lower ORR and OER activity was observed for Ce-600Air than that for Co-600Air. These results indicate that Ce-600N2 and Ce-600Air are relatively inert toward the ORR/OER compared with Co-600N2 and Co-600Air, respectively. The reported studies have shown promising bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4 during the ORR/OER.14,50–52 The outstanding ORR/OER bifunctional activity has been ascribed to that the surface Co2+ and Co3+ cations in Co3O4 could serve as the electronic donor–acceptor reduction sites for accelerating ORR and OER processes simultaneously.53–57 Thus, based on this hypothesis, increasing the amount of surface exposed Co2+ and Co3+ sites may be a feasible approach to further enhancing the bifunctional activity of Co3O4. The TEM and HRTEM observed core–shell structures of Co3O4@NC indicate that the Co3O4 may not directly come into contact with the reactants in the reaction. Recent studies regarding core–shell hybrids have implied that the Co3O4 core may change the arrangement of charges on the surface of NC shell through Mott–Schottky contacts and probably indirectly participate in the ORR/OER reaction.58–61 A more detailed study is needed and ongoing to clarify the specific active sites in the Co3O4@NC and CeO2/Co3O4@NC during the ORR/OER. In this study, the total surface content of Co2+ and Co3+ in CoCe-600N2 (∼11.6 at%) is significantly increased as compared with that of Co-600N2 (∼1.96 at%) after the introduction of CeO2 (Fig. 1e and Table S3†). Accompanied by this, the metallic Co in Co-600N2, which is usually regarded as the inert and unstable phase in the ORR/OER,62 is transformed to Co3O4 in CoCe-600N2, as confirmed by the XRD (Fig. 1a), Raman (Fig. 1b), HRTEM (Fig. 2b and d) and XPS (Fig. 1e and Table S3†) results. Similarly, the total surface content of Co2+ and Co3+ in CoCe-600Air (∼12.98 at%) is also higher than that in Co-600Air (∼10.97 at%) after introducing CeO2. The increased surface contents of Co2+ and Co3+ are in line with the increased oxygen vacancies and the Ce3+/Ce4+ ratios in CoCe-600N2 (∼9.16 at% and ∼0.26, respectively) and CoCe-600Air (∼6.22 at% and ∼0.28, respectively) in comparison with those in Ce-600N2 (∼7.90 at% and ∼0.19, respectively) and Ce-600Air (∼4.58 at% and ∼0.21, respectively), respectively. This suggests that the increased Co2+ and Co3+ may be associated with the redox processes between Co and Ce species (i.e., Co0 converts into Co2+/Co3+ and Ce4+ converts into Ce3+).63 These results demonstrate that although the ORR/OER activity of CeO2 is rather low, the introduced CeO2 could regulate the surface contents of Co2+ and Co3+ and promote the transformation of metallic Co to the active Co3O4. As a result, the enhanced ORR/OER bifunctional activity of CoCe-600N2 and CoCe-600Air is achieved through the introduction of less active CeO2, as compared with Co-600N2 and Co-600Air, respectively.

It is noteworthy that the pyrolysis in N2 is important to improve the ORR/OER activity, because an inert atmosphere is necessary to form the nitrogen-doped carbon shell and interconnected porous carbon matrices derived from metal–organic precursors, which are beneficial to charge transfer64 and could promote charge delocalization.65 Moreover, as mentioned in Section 3.1, the pyrolysis in N2 is also necessary for achieving hierarchical porosity and large BET SSAs. The numerous micropores and large BET SSAs are favorable for the formation and exposure of abundant active sites for the ORR/OER.66 The presence of mesopores can facilitate the mass transport of the electrolyte and oxygen during the ORR/OER process.67,68 Furthermore, the doped N species in NC including pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N and oxidized-N may also act as the active species and lower the overpotentials for both the ORR and OER.29,44,45,69–78 All of these features are favorable for accelerating ORR/OER processes. But the inert atmosphere may suppress the formation of Co3O4 and high valence Co species (Co2+ and Co3+). As mentioned in Section 3.1, the main Co species in Co-600N2 is metallic Co, in contrast to Co3O4 in Co-600Air. The total surface content of Co2+ and Co3+ in Co-600N2 (∼1.96 at%) is naturally much lower than that in Co-600Air (∼10.97 at%, Table S3†). However, unfortunately, Co-600Air without NC has a quite low BET SSA and low porosity (Table S1†), which is unfavorable for the ORR and OER activity. Fortunately, by introducing CeO2, on the one hand, the formation of the active Co3O4 is promoted (Fig. 1a and b) and the surface contents of Co2+ and Co3+ are also increased (Fig. 1e, Table S3†) even in a N2 atmosphere due to the high OSC and redox properties of CeO2.22,63 On the other hand, the obtained CoCe-600N2 with NC still has hierarchical porosity and large BET SSA (even slightly higher than that of Co-600N2) in addition to the formed Co3O4 and the increased surface contents of Co2+ and Co3+. Furthermore, the surface content of active nitrogen species in Co-600N2 (∼4.83 at%) has been also increased to ∼7.59 at% in CoCe-600N2 mainly due to the emerged oxidized-N species (Fig. 1g and Table S3†) after the introduction of CeO2, which may facilitate the ORR/OER processes.43,69 Thus, the introduced CeO2 benefits the formation of active Co3O4 having high surface contents of active Co2+, Co3+ and N species during pyrolysis in a N2 atmosphere, without losing the hierarchical porosity and large BET SSA.
As discussed above, the introduced CeO2 plays a role in improving the acid–base properties of Co3O4 (Fig. 1i–j, S1h and i†), which might be ascribed to the intimate coupling and interactions between Co and Ce species (Fig. 1e and f).70 Recent literature has noted the importance of the surface acid–base properties for the ORR/OER, since the oxygen and water molecules could be regarded as the Lewis base and Lewis acid during the ORR and OER, respectively.70,71,79 The increased basic sites and acidic sites may facilitate the chemisorption of oxygen molecules during the ORR and the activation of water molecules during the OER, respectively.70,71,79 Thus, the ORR/OER bifunctional activity could be enhanced.
Furthermore, the EIS results (Fig. S8†) show that the charge transfer resistances of Co-600N2 and Co-600Air have been lowered by the introduction of CeO2 probably due to the interactions and redox processes between Co3O4 and CeO2.80 As it is known, low charge-transfer efficiency due to low conductivity for an electrocatalyst is bad for ORR/OER processes. In other words, increasing charge-transfer efficiency can facilitate the transport of electrons and protons between electrocatalysts and reactants, thus facilitating the ORR/OER processes.
Accordingly, based on the discussion above, the benefits derived from introducing less active CeO2 for simultaneously boosting the ORR and OER can be summarized as follows: (i) regulating the surface contents of active Co2+, Co3+ and N species; (ii) facilitating the formation of active Co3O4, having high surface contents of active Co2+, Co3+ and N species during pyrolysis in N2, while still maintaining hierarchical porosity and large BET SSA; (iii) improving the surface acid–base properties for the facilitated adsorption of oxygen molecules (for the ORR) and activation of water molecules (for the OER); (iv) increasing the charge transfer efficiency. These favorable factors cause synergistic effects and thus result in significantly enhanced ORR and OER bifunctional activity in the optimized CoCe-600N2 (i.e., CeO2/Co3O4@NC).
4. Conclusions
In summary, the less active CeO2 was introduced for regulating the ORR/OER bifunctional activity of Co3O4@NC in this work. The essential roles of introduced CeO2 were figured out. Specifically, the introduced CeO2 can increase the surface contents of Co2+ and Co3+ in both CeO2/Co3O4 and CeO2/Co3O4@NC. Additionally, the introduced CeO2 benefits the formation of active Co3O4, having active Co2+, Co3+ and N species with high surface contents during pyrolysis in a N2 atmosphere, while maintaining hierarchical porosity and large BET SSA. Furthermore, the surface acid–base property for the adsorption of oxygen molecules (for the ORR) and activation of water molecules (for the OER) can be enhanced by the introduced CeO2. The charge transfer efficiency is also improved by the introduced CeO2. As a result, significantly increased ORR/OER bifunctional activity is achieved in the optimal CoCe-600N2 (i.e., CeO2/Co3O4@NC). Its bifunctional activity is comparable or even superior to that of the benchmarked 20 wt% Pt/C (for the ORR) and IrO2 (for the OER), respectively. When applied in Zn–air batteries, the battery with CeO2/Co3O4@NC still exhibits higher performance than the battery with mixed 20 wt% Pt/C + IrO2, due to its outstanding ORR/OER bifunctional activity. This work paves an efficient way to optimize the bifunctional activity of oxygen electrocatalysts via the introduction of less active materials.
