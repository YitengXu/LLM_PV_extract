    , Accepted 1st April 2016First published on 4th April 2016AbstractA dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), one of the present photovoltaic technologies, has always been associated with some problems that make them unsatisfactory for practical use. Among them, developing low-cost, durable, and highly active electrocatalysts such as platinum (Pt) alternatives is one of the urgent issues for practical and/or large-scale commercial applications. In this study, as one of the feasible Pt alternatives, edge-selectively antimony-doped graphene nanoplatelets (SbGnPs) were prepared by a simple eco-friendly mechanochemical reaction between pristine graphite and Sb powder for the use of a counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells, for the first time. The selective doping of metalloid Sb at the edges of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) and their structure were confirmed by various analytical techniques including atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AR-TEM). The resultant SbGnPs exhibited a much lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) compared to that of Pt as electrocatalysts toward a Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple, displaying ‘zero loss stability’ of electrocatalytic activity for the Co(bpy)33+ reduction reaction even after 1000 potential cycles. DSSCs employing Co(bpy)32+/3+ were systematically evaluated in a comparison with the N-doped graphene nanoplatelet (NGnP) CE as a reference. The SbGnP-CE-based DSSC employing an SGT-021 sensitizer based on a D–π–A structured zinc(II)-porphyrin showed better power conversion efficiency (12.08%) than the Pt (11.26%) or the NGnPs (11.53%). The outstanding electrocatalytic activity of the SbGnPs with an unusual electrochemical stability suggests that they could be a possible candidate as the best alternative to a Pt-CE for DSSCs in conjunction with cobalt electrolytes.
1. Introduction
Since its first development by O'Regan and Grätzel,1 a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been widely regarded as a next-generation photovoltaics, owing to its low fabrication cost, transparency, full color, flexibility, and high efficiency under weak light with respect to silicon-based solar cells,2 and a DSSC based on a D–π–A structured zinc(II)-porphyrin recorded a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% after two decades of concentrated efforts.3 However, this emerging photovoltaic technology always seems to be associated with unsatisfactory problems in practical uses. As an example, a platinum (Pt) catalyst is still the most efficient and widely used counter electrode (CE) in DSSCs, but it has some problems that make it unsatisfactory, such as its high manufacturing cost, due to scarcity, and poor long-term stability for the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple in a DSSC. Therefore, the development of low-cost, durable, and highly active electrocatalysts for large-scale commercial applications is a considerable challenge. As a result, significant efforts have been devoted to finding possible alternatives to Pt, including carbon blacks,4 carbon nanotubes,5 functionalized graphene,6 and heteroatom-doped GnPs,7–16 as efficient metal-free electrocatalysts. Among these candidates, heteroatom-doped GnPs, such as boron (B),7 nitrogen (N),8–11 phosphorus (P),12,13 sulfur (S),14 and halogens (F, Cl, Br, and I)15,16 have been intensively studied as efficient metal-free CEs for DSSCs.
Graphene, which is a two-dimensional sheet of a single layer of sp2 carbon with a honeycomb structure and a zero band-gap, has demonstrated many outstanding properties, including high carrier mobility, large surface area (2630 m2 g−1), excellent mechanical flexibility, and superior thermal/chemical stability.17,18 However, because the neutral polarity of graphene often restricts efficient charge transfer at the graphene/liquid interface, despite the high in-plane charge mobility, heteroatom doping of graphene is quite challenging with regard to both imparting efficient in-plane charge transfer and improving polarity and hence enhancing electrocatalytic activity. As the size and electronegativity of the heteroatoms are different from those of carbon atoms, the introduction of heteroatoms into carbon nanomaterials could cause electron modulation, changing the charge distribution and electronic properties.19 Further, edge-selective heteroatom-doping of the graphitic framework could be a pivotal factor for the overall enhancement of electrocatalytic activity.20 In this regard, our group has been able to devise a simple yet eco-friendly mechanochemical reaction for the efficient edge-selective functionalization of GnPs by a ball-milling process.7,10,15,16,21 The mechanochemical ball-milling approach to produce edge-functionalized GnPs has many advantages over that of the commonly used solution process in corrosive media.22 One of the salient features of the ball-milling approach is that the edge-functionalization reaction is induced by kinetic energy. Steel balls travelling at high speed deliver enough kinetic energy to graphitic layers, unzip graphitic C–C bonds, generate active carbon species at the broken edges, and activate the corresponding reactant. The process induces unzipping, edge-functionalization, and delamination at the same time, leading to minimal damage on the graphitic basal plane.
In this study, as an approach to improve the charge transfer kinetics of GnPs on the basis of well-optimized conditions, metalloid antimony (Sb)-doped graphene nanoplatelets (SbGnPs) were synthesized by simple ball-milling of graphite in the presence of Sb powder. Due to their peculiar structure and unique properties, the SbGnPs show eminent stability based on the effect of multiple oxidation states of the Sb atom and promising electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells.23 Here, we took full advantage of SbGnPs and applied them as the CE for a DSSC in conjunction with a Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple, showing a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared to that of an I−/I3− redox couple.24 As a result, SbGnPs were found to be far more active for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox reaction (CRR) than Pt, displaying ‘zero loss’ of CRR even after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) potentials. DSSCs employing Co(bpy)32+/3+ were systematically evaluated in a comparison with the N-doped graphene nanoplatelet (NGnP)11 CE as a reference. Ultimately, the SbGnP-CE-based DSSC with the D–π–A structured zinc(II)-porphyrin dye (SGT-021), which has been newly designed and synthesized through the structural modification of SM315 well-known as a world champion dye for efficient retardation of charge recombination and fast dye regeneration,3,25 showed a PCE of 12.08%, outperforming that of the Pt-CE (11.03%) and the NGnP-CE (11.53%).
2. Results and discussion
As schematically represented in Fig. 1, edge-selectively antimony (Sb)-doped graphene nanoplatelets (SbGnPs) were prepared by ball-milling of graphite and Sb in the solid state.20,21,23 As shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the flake-type graphite with a large grain size (<150 μm, Fig. 2a) was converted into SbGnP powders with a small grain size (<1 μm, Fig. 2b and S1b†). The dramatic size reduction implicates that cracking of the graphitic structure and Sb powders had occurred during ball milling, generating active carbon and Sb species, and could induce the formation of C–Sb bonds at the edges of GnPs. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of SbGnPs show a typical Sb peak as well as C, O, and Cl peaks (Fig. S1a†), and the corresponding element mapping images from the SEM image also display C, O, and Sb with Cl elements (Fig. S1†). The Cl peak is derived from physically adsorbed HCl and the formation of an Sb–Cl bond during the work-up with a warm concentrated HCl (∼37%).26 The content of Sb in SbGnPs according to SEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is 5.28 at% (Table S1†). High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images show that SbGnPs have a highly ordered structure on the basal plane (red box, Fig. S2†). Only some distortion in the edge region (sky blue arrow, Fig. S2b†) indicates that the formation of C–Sb bonds is provoked selectively at the edges of GnPs by the mechanochemical reaction. The result is in agreement with the reaction scheme proposed in Fig. 1. The corresponding Sb content in SbGnPs according to TEM-EDS was 3.94 wt% (Fig. S3c†). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF STEM) image with atomic Z-contrast (Fig. 2c) confirms the existence of individual Sb atoms (bright dots, sky blue arrows) rather than Sb clusters. Furthermore, it could be clearly observed that a single Sb atom is introduced only at the edges of GnPs (sky blue arrow, Fig. 2d), indicating the formation of edge-selective C–Sb bonds by the mechanochemical reaction. Moreover, the TEM results clearly support the proposition that the active carbon and Sb species generated from the broken graphite and Sb powder react spontaneously to form a covalent C–Sb–C bond and then Sb atoms are introduced along the broken edges of GnPs (Fig. 1).21

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further utilized to determine the element compositions of the samples. The survey spectrum of the starting graphite shows a main C 1s peak and a minor O 1s peak, which is due to physically adsorbed oxygen on the surface of the graphite (Fig. S4a†). On the other hand, the survey spectrum of SbGnPs clearly shows an Sb 4d peak and an Sb 3d peak, which overlap the O 1s peak.27,28 The content of Sb in SbGnPs was approximately 2.13 at%. High-resolution XPS survey spectra, together with the curve fittings and deconvolutions, indicate that the C 1s peak consisted of C–Sb (283.7 eV),29 sp2C–C (284.6 eV), C–O (285.7 eV), and CO (288.6 eV) (Fig. S4b†). The Sb 3d and O 1s peaks were divided into Sb 3d5/2 (530.4 eV) and Sb 3d3/2 (539.2 eV) peaks as well as CO (532.4 eV) and C–O (533.7 eV) (Fig. S4c†). In addition, the Sb 3d3/2 peak (centered at 539.6 eV) can be separated into two contributions; that is, the Gaussian lines are centered at 538.6 and 539.8 eV, corresponding to the Sb atoms with oxidation states of Sb3+ and Sb5+, respectively (Fig. S4d†).30,31
The specific surface areas of the starting graphite and SbGnPs were determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements by N2 adsorption isotherms (Table S2†). The BET surface area (302.06 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.3191 mL g−1) of SbGnPs were significantly increased after ball milling compared with those of the starting graphite (2.78 m2 g−1 and 0.0016 mL g−1). The surface area and pore volume of SbGnPs increased approximately 109- and 199-fold, respectively, indicating that effective delamination of graphitic layers occurred at the edges of the SbGnPs.32 Since the contribution to the surface area of the graphitic edges of the basal area in SbGnPs is too small and can thus be ignored, the average expected number of graphitic layers in SbGnPs can be simply deduced to be approximately 8.7 in the solid state by a simple calculation (maximum theoretical specific surface area of single layer graphene (2630 m2 g−1)/specific surface area (302 m2 g−1) of SbGnPs).33
In view of the well-defined structure and properties of the edge-selectively Sb-doped GnPs, we further evaluated the electrocatalytic activity of SbGnPs for potential applications in DSSCs. For use as the CE in a DSSC, thin films of SbGnPs were prepared on fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO)/glass substrates by using an electrostatic-spray (e-spray) technique,10 and their fabrication procedure is described in detail in the ESI.† The electrocatalytic activity of the SbGnPs was determined with symmetrical dummy cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (Fig. S5a†). As a reference, a conventional Pt-CE was also prepared by drop casting of ca. 20 μL cm−2 of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of H2PtCl6 in 1 mL of ethanol), followed by sintering at 400 °C for 15 min. The electrocatalytic activity of the SbGnPs was investigated with the Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox couple, whose standard redox potential is much higher than that of the traditional I−/I3− redox couple and therefore leads to an increase in the PCE of DSSCs by enhancing the Voc.34
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with an appropriate equivalent circuit (EC), is one of the powerful and useful tools to provide supporting evidence for the CE's performance in DSSCs.35,36Fig. 3a shows the typical EIS spectra, where the first semicircle, observed in the high-frequency regions, relates to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the second semicircle, observed in the low-frequency regions, represents the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple between the two electrodes,36 and its corresponding EC is shown in Fig. S5b.† The value of the real axis (Z′) at the onset of the first semicircle is the series resistance (Rs) comprised of contact resistance among two electrodes and bulk electrolyte solution. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which corresponds to the capacitance from the constant phase element (CPE) due to the charge accumulation at the CE/electrolyte interface, depends on the effective surface condition of the electrode.37 The fill factor (FF) of a DSSC is critically influenced by the total resistance (Rs + Rct + ZN). There are slight differences in the magnitude of the Rs and ZN between Pt and SbGnPs (Fig. 3a), but there is a considerable difference in the Rct between the two electrodes. Therefore, Rct can be a major factor of the electrocatalytic performance and can also significantly affect the FF; that is, the smaller Rct, the higher PCE that can be expected in DSSCs (Jsc × Voc × FF).

The electrocatalytic reduction of redox couples at CEs is responsible for the cathodic performance of DSSCs and affects photocurrent generation at the photoanode through dye regeneration. The rate of the redox mediator's reduction at the CE should be commensurate with the rate of reduction of oxidized sensitizers at the photoanode, which is expressed by the photocurrent density (Jsc). Hence, Jsc should be comparable to the exchange current density (J0) at the CE:38 J0 = RT/nFRct = Fk0(Cox1−αCredα),(1)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction reaction of the redox couple at the CE. Here, k0 is the rate constant of the electrode reaction under steady-state conditions. Cox and Cred are the concentrations of oxidized and reduced mediators, respectively, and α is equal to be 0.5 as the charge-transfer coefficient in symmetrical electrode kinetics. The Rct of SbGnPs is 0.094 Ω cm2, which is ca. 10 times lower than that of the Pt (0.9 Ω cm2), with corresponding exchange current densities (J0) of 273.3 and 28.6 mA cm−2 (Table 1). The Rct of NGnPs is 0.48 Ω cm2, which is also lower than that of Pt. Thus, a faster and more efficient reduction reaction of Co(bpy)33+ was obtained from NGnP- and SbGnP-CE. On the other hand, the diffusion resistances (ZN) of NGnPs (3.5 Ω cm2) and SbGnPs (3.5 Ω cm2) are slightly higher than that of Pt (3.0 Ω cm2), but which may not significantly affect the overall electrocatalytic performance of CEs, because electrocatalytic ability of CEs depends on the charge-transfer kinetics at the CE/electrolyte interface rather than diffusion of ions in bulk electrolyte solution. In addition to the EIS, Tafel polarization measurement is also one of the useful methods of evaluating the electrocatalytic activity of CEs in DSSCs. Tafel polarization curves demonstrate that the slope of a tangent at around 0 V to the SbGnP curve is steeper than that of the Pt. It shows that SbGnPs produce a higher oxidation/reduction current density (Fig. 3b), which can be confirmed through the lower overall cell resistance (RCV)10,35 of the SbGnP electrode (Table 1). The RCV values of Pt and SbGnPs are slightly higher than those of EIS results, but the general trend is similar to the above-mentioned EIS results.

Additional data related to the electrocatalytic activity were further examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with different scan rates (Fig. S6†). As can be seen, the CV curves show similar shapes and similar redox peak positions, but the SbGnP electrode possesses a high specific current density compared to that of the Pt counterpart (Fig. S6b†). Moreover, the linear relationship between redox peak currents and scan rates indicates that SbGnPs possess high electrocatalytic activity towards the redox of Co(bpy)32+/3+ (Fig. 3c), and the redox reactions on SbGnPs are controlled by both the Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface and ionic diffusion in the bulk electrolyte, as discussed below in potential-step chronoamperometry (CA), which is in good agreement with the EIS (Fig. 3a) and potential-step CA (Fig. 3d). That is to say, the SbGnPs electrode is favorable for fast electron transfer due to its lower Rct, which is helpful for improving the electrocatalytic activity of the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple. We also carried out the CA measurement to characterize the mass transport of Co(bpy)33+ ions in Pt and SbGnP dummy cells (Fig. 3d). Shortly after the potential step, semi-infinite Cottrell-like decay arose (eqn (2)).39 The current decreases linearly versus t−1/2 (t is time) as long as the concentration profiles in front of each electrode merge to form a single linear profile. At this stage, the current reached the steady-state, leading to the limiting current. Both linear components of the CA plots were extrapolated to intersect at the so-called transition time (t), which provides the diffusion coefficient D according to eqn (2) and (3):39 (2) (3)where n is the number of electrons, F is Faraday's constant, A is the area of the electrode, and C is the concentration of transport limited species.16 From the CA data in Fig. 3d and eqn (3), we can calculate the values of D = 3.8 × 10−6 and 3.3 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the SbGnPs and Pt dummy cells, respectively, whereas the limiting current of the SbGnPs is higher than that of Pt. This indicates that a higher photocurrent density (Jsc) can be obtained in the SbGnP-CE-based DSSC compared to that of the Pt counterpart.
The electrochemical stability of the CE in a DSSC is one of the critical factors for its practical uses. Since Pt-based CEs generally suffer from surface oxidation and aggregation in alkaline electrolytes, in addition, Pt may be dissolved in the I−/I3− redox couple, producing PtI4, which can lead to a terminated device life.40,41 This is a critical issue that needs to be specifically resolved for the construction of stable CEs in DSSCs. Based on this consideration, the electrochemical stability of the SbGnPs was tested in a Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple through 1000 consecutive potential cycles (Fig. S7†). There was no noticeable change in the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) arising in the low frequency region, which implies that the SbGnPs are stable for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple, even under severe conditions, but there is a considerable difference in the first semicircles, which correspond to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the case of Pt. Fig. 4a shows the changes in Rct with respect to the cycling potential. The Rct values were drastically increased from the fresh cell (0.90 Ω cm2) to the final cycle (51.04 Ω cm2) for the Pt, whereas they were 0.090 and 0.091 Ω cm2 for the SbGnPs, respectively. It was almost invariable after 1000 potential cycles, but Pt lost 83% of its capacity to drive the charge transfer reaction (Fig. 4b). The anodic current density for the fresh Pt dummy cell was 24.71 mA cm−2 and decreased to 3.31 mA cm−2 in the final cycle (Fig. 4c), which might cause the drop in FF and Jsc in the actual DSSCs, while SbGnPs were almost invariant in terms of cycling potential, which was 27.48 to 27.05 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d). Consequently, the SbGnP-CE was expected to be better than the Pt-CE in terms of the long-term stability of the DSSCs with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple.

On the basis of the in-depth evaluation of the SbGnPs, the electrocatalytic activity of the SbGnP-CE in actual organic DSSC devices was observed in the SGT-021 sensitizer-based DSSCs with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple. Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Furthermore, a series of DSSCs applying NGnP-CEs were certified for the comparison with the case of Pt- and SbGnP-CEs (Fig. S8 and Table S3†).10 The Pt- and NGnP-based DSSCs exhibited a Jsc of 15.95 and 16.69 mA cm−2, a Voc of 932.6 and 921.8 mV, an FF of 74.53 and 74.30%, and a PCE of 11.09 and 11.42%, respectively. As expected, the DSSC with the SbGnP-CE showed a much higher PCE of 12.08% with a Jsc of 17.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 930 mV, and an FF of 75.53%, indicating that the enhancement of Jsc and FF in the SbGnP-CE-based DSSC is due to its own lower Rct and thus leading to a higher PCE than in the Pt-based and NGnP-based devices. The characteristic resistance (Rch), defined as Vmax/Jmax (maximum voltage/current), is the output resistance of the solar cell at its maximum power point (Pmax).42,43 The Rch values are 58.50, 55.26 and 54.46 Ω cm2 for the Pt-, NGnP- and SbGnP-based DSSCs, respectively, indicating that high powers are dissipated by the output resistance in the Pt- and NGnP-based DSSCs. The photocurrent transient dynamics of the DSSCs with Pt- and SbGnP-CEs were also recorded to examine the influence of the mass transport limitation of Co(bpy)33+ ions in the complete devices. The photocurrent dynamics were determined using on/off modulation of the incident light under one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).11,44 Once the incident light had irradiated the devices, the maximum photocurrent was observed, and it decreased rapidly and reached a steady-state current, which is comparable to Jsc. The SbGnP-based device displays a higher current density than that of the Pt-based device (Fig. 5b). There are some spikes in the onset of each plateau, which originated in the slow diffusion of the large Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple. However, since all of the fabrication methods and conditions, except for the cathodes, were identical, diffusion resistance within the anode can be regarded as being nearly the same. Therefore, the photocurrent transient dynamics are contingent on the cathode changes. There were no fluctuations in the steady-state currents during the measurement in both DSSCs, and thus we can conclude that neither Pt- nor SbGnP-CEs cause any other mass transport problem.

To further ascertain the correspondence of the trend of Rct between symmetrical cells and complete DSSCs with Pt- and SbGnP-CEs, EIS measurements were carried out for DSSCs with Pt- and SbGnP-CEs from 106 Hz to 0.1 Hz at a forward bias of −0.93 V under dark conditions (Fig. 5c). The high-frequency regions of the Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5d. The first semicircle of the DSSC with the SbGnP-CE is smaller than that of the Pt-CEs. From the first semicircle the Rct of the SbGnP-CE was 0.32 Ω cm2, whereas the corresponding value of the Pt-CE was 0.75 Ω cm2. These results show the similar tendency of the Rct values obtained from the symmetrical cells. As mentioned above, the low Rct leads to high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of Co(bpy)33+ ions, whereby the enhancement of photovoltaic performances can be acquired, especially FF and Jsc.
Finally, the long-term stability of the DSSCs is a vital element for sustained cell operation, so to assure the long-term stability of the DSSCs, they were explored under repeated irradiation by an AM 1.5 solar simulator during 864 h. After 864 h, the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE performances of the SbGnP-based device remained at 98.3, 95.3, 94.7, and 88.7% of their highest values, respectively, but the performance of the Pt-based device declined substantially, sustaining a PCE of only 68% (Fig. 6). The enhanced long-term stability of the SbGnP-CE-based DSSC can be attributed to the high electrochemical stability of the SbGnPs for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple.

3. Conclusions
In summary, edge selectively antimony-doped graphene nanoplatelets (SbGnPs) were synthesized by a simple mechanochemcial reaction between graphite and Sb powder. The edge selectivity and the covalent bonding of the metalloid Sb with the graphitic carbon are visualized by using atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AR-TEM). The resultant SbGnPs were tested as the counter electrode (CE) for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). As a result, the SbGnP-CE exhibited extremely low charge-transfer resistance (Rct), with nearly zero loss of electrochemical stability even after 1000 potential cycles. Notably, the extraordinarily enhanced current–voltage characteristics (in particular, FF and Jsc) of the SbGnP-CE-based DSSC outperformed those of the Pt- and NGnP-based DSSCs. The SbGnP-CE-based DSSC displayed a PCE of 12.08%, which was much higher than that of Pt-CE (11.26%) and NGnP-CE (11.53%). SbGnPs may provide new insights and practical methods for the design and synthesis of low-cost and highly durable carbon-based electrocatalysts in DSSCs.
4. Experimental section
Materials
Graphite was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Natural, 100 mesh, 99.9995% metal basis, Lot #: 14735) and used as received. Antimony (Sb) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Inc. (Cat # 266329) and used as received. All other solvents were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Inc. and used without further purification unless otherwise specified.
Synthesis of SbGnPs
SbGnPs were prepared simply by ball milling of graphite in the presence of Sb in a planetary ball-mill capsule. Graphite (5.0 g) and antimony (Sb, 5.0 g) were placed into a stainless steel capsule containing stainless steel balls (500 g, diameter 5 mm). After the capsule was sealed, five cycles of charge (70 psi, argon gas)/discharge (0.05 mmHg) were applied to completely remove the air. The capsule was then fixed in the planetary ball-mill machine and agitated at 500 rpm for 48 h. The resultant product was repeatedly washed to get rid of any remaining metallic impurities and antimony with warm concentrated HCl (∼37%). The final product was Soxhlet-extracted with concentrated HCl and then freeze-dried at −120 °C under a reduced pressure (0.05 mmHg) for 48 h to yield dark black SbGnP powder.
Instrumentation
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed on an FEI Nanonova 230. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (AR-TEM) was carried out on a Titan Cubed G2 60-300 microscope. The TEM specimens were prepared by dipping carbon micro-grids (Ted Pella Inc., 200 Mesh Copper Grid) into well-dispersed samples in ethanol. The surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method on Micromeritics ASAP 2504N. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Fisher K-alpha XPS spectrometer.
