In dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells (DSCs) that composed of a dye-adsorbed mesoporous TiO2 layer on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as a window electrode, redox electrolytes as charge carrier and the counter electrode, unidirectional charge flow with no electron leakage at the interfaces is essential for the high energy conversion efficiency. The electrolytes, usually containing an I−/I3− redox couple in organic solvents are sealed between two electrodes. For the application requirement, organic liquid electrolytes cause a serious problem of low durability due to electrolyte evaporation. Recently, much attention1–3 has been paid to improve the performance of the ionic liquid-based DSCs because of the features of ionic liquid such as high ionic conductivity, non-volatility, electrochemical stability and non-flammability.4–6
According to the unidirectional electron transporting principle of DSCs, there are four important interfaces in the devices as shown in Fig. 1 when hydrophobic sensitizing dye Z-907 (cis-bis(isothiocyanato)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-di-nonyl) ruthenium(II)) is employed. These are, the interfaces of FTO/TiO2, TiO2/dye, dye/electrolyte, and electrolyte/counter electrode (usually platinized FTO electrode). Recently, many researchers have paid much attention to the interface of TiO2/dye especially through constructing core-shell structured electrodes by introducing Nb2O5,7 SrTiO3,8,9 Al2O310 and so on11 for TiO2 electrode surface modification. On the other hand, a few groups have investigated the effect of the interface of FTO/TiO2, revealing its effectiveness of employing a blocking TiO2 layer,12b,15,16 which is called compact TiO2.12–15
 Fig. 1  Schematic views of interfaces in the DSC device and the electron transfer of the new structured electrode. 
In our previous work,17 we first succeeded in introducing a nano-thick Nb2O5 layer by the spray pyrolysis method as a blocking layer at the FTO/TiO2 interface, obtaining some promising results (improvement of Voc and FF). However, the J–V curve of DSC gives some lower Jsc and less than 4% conversion efficiency as far as ionic liquid electrolytes are employed. In this communication, we report the preparation of a Nb2O5 blocking layer employing the sputtering method achieving over 5.5% energy conversion efficiency for ionic liquid-based DSCs. Since the surface modification of mesoporous TiO2 layers (electrode) is a well-known strategy to improve cell performance, the comparison between these two methods is undertaken to verify the effects on suppression of charge recombination at these two interfaces (FTO/nano-TiO2 and nano-TiO2/dye as motioned above) in ionic liquid DSCs. Through this study, we can get a comprehensive understanding of the importance of the controlling unidirectional charge flow at both interfaces in DSCs.
The improvement should come from the Nb2O5 blocking layer that create potential barrier between FTO and TiO2 layers, which can suppress back electron transfer from FTO to I−/I3− redox electrolytes in the vicinity of FTO/TiO2 interfaces without lowering electron injection between TiO2 and FTO as shown in Fig. 1.
The sputtering method was applied to form the thin Nb2O5 layer on FTO during the fabrication of the structure of FTO/Nb2O5/porous TiO2 (Nanoxide-T, Solaronix, 5.5 µm) electrodes. The general procedure was as follows:. The Nb2O5 modified FTO substrates were fabricated through depositing Nb2O5 onto FTO (Nippon Sheet Glass, SnO2: F, 10 ohm sq−1) with a radio frequency magnetron sputtering equipment (SPW-025S, ULVAC, Japan). The sputtering target was Nb2O5 (High Pure Chemicals, Japan) disk of 99.99% purity with the diameter of 100 mm. Different thicknesses of Nb2O5 layers were deposited onto FTO at dc power of 150 W under a working pressure of 0.5 Pa of a mixture of O2 and Ar (volume ratio was 1 to 4). The Ru dye, Z-907 (Ru-520 DN, Solaronix) and the ionic liquid electrolyte composed of 0.5 M tert-4-butylpyridine, 0.1 M LiI and 0.2 M I2 in PMImI (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) and EMIm-DCA (1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium dicyanamide) ([PMImI] : [EMIm-DCA] = 2 : 1) were employed for ionic liquid-based DSCs. Here ruthenium dye Z-907 with the long alkyl chain was employed because of its thermal stability of absorbed states.18 As far as the conversion efficiency is concerned, other ruthenium dyes such as N3 and N-719 give similar results during the examination of the Nb2O5 blocking layer effect. The ethanol solution of 0.005 M NbCl5 was prepared and used as a precursor for surface modification by the dipping method.7 The 4 µm thickness of 400 nm TiO2 (Catalysis & Chemicals Ind. Co. Ltd.) is used as a scattering layer of DSCs.
As shown in Table 1, when compared to the non-blocked electrode 〈nano-TiO2/dye〉, the Nb2O5 blocking electrode 〈Nb2O5-BL/nano-TiO2/dye〉 (obtained by sputtering for 2 min at 150 W being estimated around 5 nm) improves Voc about 50 mV with even higher Jsc, leading to an energy conversion efficiency of 4.5% without decreasing the fill factor, which is 20% higher than that of the non-blocked electrode. Fig. 2 presents the J-V curve of the interface-optimized DSC and that of the non-blocked DSC for reference under AM 1.5 irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. As similar to the nano-TiO2 electrodes with compact TiO2 layer as blocking layer, the novel electrode with the Nb2O5 blocking layer can decrease the dark current greatly. The dye Z-907 absorption on both the blocking Nb2O5 and the nano-TiO2 layers may block dark current, improving the unidirectional electron flow at FTO/Nb2O5 layer/nano-TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces.12b

It has recently been suggested19,20 that the charge recombination sites leading to a decrease of Voc should be mainly at nanocrystalline TiO2/redox electrolyte interfaces. The injected conduction-band electrons may recombine with oxidized dye molecules on the interfaces or with tri-iodide and poly-iodide redox species in the electrolyte. And generally, the former recombination is negligible because of the quick reduction of the oxidized dye molecules by I− ions in the electrolytes. Many attempts have been done to suppress such back electron transfer reaction that may take place at the interface between TiO2 and dye or redox electrolytes in the last several years using surface treatment7–11 of TiO2 electrode as mentioned in the introduction. On the other hand, the porous interfaces between FTO substrate and nano-TiO2 can also act as electron recombination sites, i.e., electron leakage sites exist especially when solid or quasi-solid state electrolytes like ionic liquid electrolytes once infiltrate into the interfaces. Therefore, the suppression of electron leakage at FTO/TiO2 interface is very crucial because photoelectron density at FTO/TiO2 is very high.
Our successful structured FTO/Nb2O5/TiO2 electrode should form 100 mV21 potential barrier between Nb2O5 and TiO2 particles, prohibiting effectively the recombination of injected electron in FTO with the redox couple in electrolytes, which means enhancement of the electron collection at FTO, giving an improvement of shunt resistance and Voc because of the minimized leakage of injected electrons at the interfaces. Meanwhile, the accumulated electrons lead to the increment of conduction band electrons as reflected by the Jsc increase.
On the other hand, the improved fill factor may be ascribed to the improved series resistance.22 Interestingly, the radius of Nb5+ (0.69Å) is almost the same as that of Sn4+ which is favourable for the Nb species to diffuse into the FTO layer, contributing to the decrease of resistance as verified in recent paper.23
It is interesting to note that the treatment of NbCl5 solution on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes will improve Voc and Jsc in liquid electrolyte DSCs, which was explained as due to core-shell structured mesoporous TiO2 electrode.7 The Nb2O5 layer was proposed to form potential barrier on mesoporous TiO2 electrode, contributing to suppress back electron transfer at interface between TiO2 and dye molecules. Considering the Nb2O5 blocking effects, FTO/TiO2 and TiO2/dye interfaces, the surface modification with NbCl5 was extended to ionic liquid-based DSC electrodes.

Table 1 shows the effects between the blocking method and nano-TiO2 surface modification. In the case of NbCl5 surface modification, it can improve Jsc greatly followed by more than a 10 mV increment of Voc. While the treatment was applied to the Nb2O5 blocked electrodes, both Voc and Jsc were improved drastically, leading to the respectable conversion efficiency in ionic liquid-based DSCs. In addition, the introduction of 4 μm of 400 nm-sized TiO2 as a scattering layer employed in ionic liquid-based DSCs, the cell gives 11.4 mA cm−2 of Jsc, 719 mV of Voc and 0.67 of FF, leading to a conversion efficiency of 5.5%.
In summary, we have demonstrated that the sputtering of Nb2O5 on FTO can form a nm-thick film, giving effective blocking layer at interstitial FTO and mesoporous TiO2 interfaces. The resulting mesoporous TiO2 anodes greatly improve Voc whilst keeping good fill factor, proving the importance of the blocking layer at FTO and TiO2 interfaces in ionic liquid-based DSCs. Compared to the previous spray pyrolysis method17 for making Nb2O5 blocking films, the present sputtering method will be the best way for introduction of the blocking layer on FTO. Through the combination with the surface modification of mesoporous TiO2 layer method, we verified that unidirectional charge transfer at the interfaces of FTO/nano-TiO2 and nano-TiO2/dye are very important for higher conversion efficiency in ionic liquid-based DSCs. Further investigations need to be done to study the interaction of Nb2O5 blocking layer with FTO and nano-TiO2 layers. Other facile methods for construction of the effective blocking layer and their comparisions are currently being undertaken.
