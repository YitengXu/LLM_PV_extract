    , Accepted 14th February 2016First published on 15th February 2016AbstractA series of Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped KLu2F7 nanoparticles (NPs) with different morphologies (hexagon and stick-like structures) and sizes are prepared by a facile additive-assisted hydrothermal route. The synergistic effects of ultraviolet (UV) light down-conversion and infrared (IR) up-conversion in Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped KLu2F7 NPs under the dual excitation of 377 and 980 nm simultaneously are investigated. The optimized emission intensity of Er3+ with the most regular morphologies under the dual wavelength excitation is 1.16 times of the total emission intensities under single excitation of 377 and 980 nm. More interesting, a sharp increase in the number of photons as a quasi-photon avalanche (QPA) phenomenon is observed by employing the dual wavelength excitation sources. Thermo-luminescence technique results experimentally verify that there are structure defects acting as deep traps capturing carriers, contributing to the QPA. The phenomenon of QPA disappears after the sample annealed at 300 °C and as a result of that most of the deep traps are eliminated, which provides further evidence of the roles that traps play in the photoluminescence process. We believe that this preliminary study will provide an important advance in grasping defects of NPs anticipating the up- and down-conversions processes involved in increasing photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells.
Introduction
Solar energy utilization requires effective means of capture and conversion of the solar radiation, and storage of the acquired energy, however, the energy transfer efficiency in commercial solar cells is just 15%, and most of sunlight energy is lost.1 The main energy loss in the conversion of solar energy to electricity is related to the so-called spectral mismatch: low energy photons are not absorbed by solar cells, while high energy photons are not used efficiently.2 The response spectrum wavelength of the solar spectrum is limited to 350–750 nm with a wide bandgap of Eg ∼1.75 eV, namely the solar cell is almost transparent for near-infrared (NIR 700–1100 nm) radiation, constituting a significant efficiency loss of solar spectrum. For photovoltaic efficiency of semiconductor solar cells, the sub-band gap and thermalization losses present a bottleneck effect. Thus, the modification of solar spectra aimed at improving the solar cells efficiency has evoked tremendous interests.3–8 Current studies of solar modification are mostly focused on up-conversion (UC) or down-conversion (DC) in rare-earth (RE) doped materials.9–13 UC is predicted to decrease the losses due to the energy mis-matches for the conversion that two or more sub-band gaps (<Eg) can be converted into one photon with energy >Eg, while DC may be beneficial by converting an absorbed higher energy photon into one or two lower energy photons that is more efficiently absorbed by the solar cells.14 However, it's hard to fully harvest solar energy, which has a continuous energy distribution due to the discrete characteristic absorptions of RE ions. Hence, it's necessary to find a new way to realize broadband excitation aimed at the complete utilization of solar energy. One effective approach is the synergistic effect of a combination of DC and UC processes, in that the DC and UC might simultaneously convert high-energy photons and low-energy photons into middle-energy photons whose energy is equal to or slightly greater than the semiconductor band-gap.15–23
Besides, it is recognized that various defects play an important role in the luminescence processes.24–29 Especially in a combination of the DC and UC processes, defects located around the luminescence centers in the band gap are very likely to be involved in the photoluminescence processes by capturing, transferring, and releasing carriers. Hence, the role of defects in these materials and their effect on device performance cannot be ignored. It is worth clarifying the vital role of defects in the DC and UC processes involved in the synergistic effect in solar cells.
Herein, KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs via a facile hydrothermal method were obtained.30–31 The regular and agglomeration-free samples with different morphologies of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs were deliberately controlled during the synthesis process. Then the synergistic effects of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs were carefully investigated under the dual-excitation of UV light (377 nm) and low power NIR (980 nm) laser diode (LD). Interestingly, a quasi-photon avalanche (QPA) related to defects was observed in these NPs under the dual-excitation of 377 and 980 nm. The vital role that defects in KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs played in the re-excitation of 980 nm LD was elucidated.
Experimental
All of the commercial available reagents were purchased and used as received; rare-earth oxides (Ln = Lu, Yb, Er) (99.99%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), absolute ethanol (>99.5%) and cyclohexane (>90%). For this initial step 0.41 mmol Lu2O3, 0.08 mmol Yb2O3 and 0.01 mmol Er2O3 were weighted and mixed together, after which the mixture were dissolved with moderately concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and stirred until the corresponding nitrate solution was formed and evaporated extra concentrated nitric acid. Deionized (DI) water was added into the mixture to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the mixture of 25 mL absolute ethyl alcohol (EA) and oleic acid (OA) were added to the solution of Ln(NO3)3. With the addition of KF solution the total resolution volume is adjusted to 75 mL and the pH value was kept to be 6.5. Afterwards, the above mixed solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature and then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 4 h. After the solution had cooled naturally to room temperature, nanocrystals were centrifuged from the solution with EA. The nanocrystals were precipitated without any size selection and washed several times with ethanol and cyclohexane, and could be easily redispersed in various nonpolar organic solvents (e.g., hexane, cyclohexane, and toluene). Samples with different DI:EA:OA ratio and hydrothermal reaction time of DI:EA:OA = 1:1:1, 4 h; DI:EA:OA = 1:1:1, 10 h and DI:EA:OA = 1:1:1.5, 10 h were labeled as s1 (sample 1), s2 and s3, respectively.
X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. The particle morphology and size were studied with field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution field transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), carried out using U.S. FEI Tecnai G2 F20 operating at 200 kV. The TEM, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) images were recorded to provide more information about the structure of KLu2F7. The UC or DC photoluminescence spectra of the samples under continuous excitation of 377 nm UV laser or 980 nm IR with different pump power excitation were recorded by HITACHIU-F-7000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The thermoluminescence (TL) curves were measured with a FJ-427 A TL meter (Beijing Nuclear Instrument Factory). Weight of the measured samples was constant (0.002 g). Prior to the TL measurement, the samples were first exposed to the radiation from UV light (254 nm) for about 10 min, then heated from room temperature to 650 K with a rate of 1 K s−1. The photoluminescence decay curves were measured with a FLSP-980 spectrophotometer under excitation of 980 nm LD.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the as-prepared KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ samples are given in Fig. 1(a–c). All the diffraction peaks of the three samples are in good agreement with the standard JCPDS card (Fig. 1(d)) of orthorhombic KYb2F7 (space group of Pna21) (JCPDS: 27-0459). The slight shift of 2θ to higher angle is contributed to the shrinkage of lattice constants of Lu3+ (R = 0.848 Å) in comparison with Yb3+ (R = 0.858 Å). No impurity peaks are observed, indicating that these KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ samples synthesized with different reaction conditions are of high purity and crystallinity.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) of the as-synthesized KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs are shown in Fig. 2. TEM images clearly present the regular shapes and mono-dispersed KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs are obtained. Obviously, with the changes of the reaction time and the volume of OA, the morphologies are various in a certain degree. The stick-like KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ changes to become a regular hexagon-like one with prolonged hydrothermal reaction time, while more regular and increased stick-like morphology could be obtained with increased concentration of OA. The HRTEM image displays an interplanar spacing of 0.670, 0.672 and 0.669 nm corresponding to the (011) plane of Fig. 2(a–c), respectively. The obvious lattice fringes confirm the high crystallinity of the NPs as shown in Fig. 2(a–c), correspondingly, which agree well with the XRD results. The single-crystalline nature of s1 and s2 and poly-crystalline of s3 is revealed by the corresponding SAED patterns below. Moreover, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) analyses (Fig. 2(e)) taken from Fig. 2(c) show the presence of K, Lu, F and doped Yb, Er elements, further verifying the constituent elements of the as-prepared sample. A possible formation process for the growth of rare earth fluorides NPs is proposed in Fig. 2(d). Firstly, a yellow clear rare earth oleate solution could be obtained when the RE3+ nitrate solution was mixed with a moderate concentration of OA. Then, a fast nucleation process occurs when a stoichiometric amount of K+ and F− are added and the solution becomes turbid. Subsequently, with prolonging time of the thermal insulation, the crystal grows. Finally, NPs with hexagon and stick-like structures are obtained, which is corresponding to the TEM results. It is clear that the process of nucleation is strongly dependent on the concentration of the stabilizing agent (oleic acid), which is related inversely to the number nuclei formed. OA is critical for directing the intrinsic shapes of the crystals due to its characteristic physical and chemical properties and structure, which will probably limit the growth rate of crystallographic planes dramatically, such as b-axis plane of (011). With different surface energies, narrower crystallite size and rod-like shape could be formed as depicted in Fig. 2(b) and (c). When a large excess of OA is added, fewer nuclei are formed, and the nuclei disperse very rapidly and indiscriminately. An amount of regular and stick-like KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs could be obtained finally.

The characteristic photoluminescence properties of Er3+ are investigated, which is shown in Fig. 3. Under excitation of 980 nm IR or 377 nm UV, KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs exhibit the green emissions centered at 525 and 543 nm and the red emission centered at 668 nm, which are assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. No significant changes in the emission location of Er3+ under the dual-excitation of 377 and 980 nm are observed, however, a synergistic effect is observed in that the emission intensity of Er3+ is enhanced in comparison with the sum intensity of 377 and 980 nm single excited. It is found that the emission intensity under dual excitation is 1.08, 1.04 and 1.16 times of the sum intensity under 377 and 980 nm single excitation in these samples. To exclude the influence of the measurement error in the photoluminescence spectrum, a scale error bar is supplied in the ESI† (Fig. S1(a)). The green to red emission ratio (GRR) of s1, s2 and s3 varies as shown in Fig. 3(d). s3 exhibits the most enhanced red emission intensity of these samples compared with s1 and s2. It is believed that the electrons non-radiated at the 4F9/2 from 4G11/2 of Er3+ could be re-excited to a higher energy level by absorbing a 980 nm photon, which indicates that the most enhanced red emission originated from the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ could be contributed to the most optimal synergistic effect as depicted in Fig. 3. The synergistic effect is possibly caused by energy migration from the non-radiative energy of 377 nm to the transition of 4I11/2 → 4F7/2 of Er3+ with the assistance of defect-mediated. There are various defects in these as-synthesized samples via the different hydrothermal conditions, contributing to the different synergistic effect results. The detailed information about the defects will be studied in the future.

To further study the UC and DC mechanisms, the pump power dependence of the photoluminescence intensity of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs is carried out. As shown in Fig. 4, the UC emission intensity (I) of these samples increases with increasing excitation power (P), with a power law of I ∝ Pn, where n represents the number of pumping photons absorbed per upconverted photon emitted. By fitting the data points of the samples excited by 980 nm, the slopes for the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions are 1.73, 1.79 and 1.78, respectively, indicating that the two-photon process involved in the red emission under single 980 nm excitation occurs as reported.32 However, it is interesting to find that the shape of these lines present as fold lines (black line) in the three samples when dual-excited by 377 and 980 nm. As shown in Fig. 4(a–c), the slopes are 1.04, 1.34 and 1.03 with the pump power lower than 429 mW, respectively, indicating that one-photon processes occur. With the assistance of the re-excitation to electrons populated in metastable states of Er3+ or captured in traps by 980 nm LD, one photon is needed to realize the photoluminescence. On the other hand, the energy released from the higher excited state of Er3+ to a lower energy level as motivated resource, could excite the electrons, which have already absorbed a 980 nm photon via energy migration. Then, the characteristic photoluminescence of Er3+ would be realized as well. Therefore, it would be speculated that both DC and UC processes are involved in the photoluminescence process of Er3+ under dual excitation of 377 and 980 nm. Hence, the synergistic effect could be realized under a lower power. However, with an increasing pump power of 980 nm LD, dramatic changes of the slopes in s1 and s3 were observed. The slopes in s1 and s3 reached 3.69 and 3.66, which indicates that a four-photon process occurs. A scale of error bars of the calculated photons of sample s1, s2 and s3 dual-excited by 377 and 980 nm in P980nm < 429 mW, P980nm > 429 mW and single 980 nm are supplied in Fig. S1(b–d),† respectively. Thus, a quasi-photon avalanche (QPA) mechanism is proposed, which is different from the photon avalanche (PA) process caused by the repeated cross-relaxation and absorption of excited states. It will be studied further with thermo-luminescence (TL) in the following section. Fig. 4(d) shows the influence of the synergistic effect on the trend is dependent on the pump power. Clearly, the optimal synergistic effect could be obtained with 462 mW of the pump power. As the adequate photons are absorbed preferentially and participate UC luminescence process, higher pump power in the exceeding 825 mW leads to the disappearance of the synergistic effect.

As is known, the TL technique is an effective method to detect the trapping property of defects in photoluminescence materials.33 The TL spectra of s1, s2, s3 and the sample of s3 after a heat-treatment are obtained after UV irradiation for 20 min, which are depicted as yellow, olive, violet and dark yellow lines, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(a). There are three thermal bands located at 358, 422 and 585 K corresponding to two shallow traps of TA and TB, and one deep trap of TC, respectively. The trap depths (E) of s3 are calculated. The classical fitting peak-shape methods have been used extensively and the trap depth of E is calculated from the glow-peak parameters by the following equation:34 (1)where, μg is symmetry factor. Tm, T1 and T2 are the peak temperature at the maximum and the temperatures on either side of the temperature at the maximum, corresponding to half intensity, respectively. k is the Boltzmann's constant. The following parameters can be defined: τ = Tm − T1 is the half width at the low temperature side of the peak, δ = T2 − Tm is the half width towards the fall-off of the glow peak, ω = T2 − T1 is the total half of width, and μg = δ/ω is the symmetrical geometrical factor. The calculated trap levels (E) of TA, TB and TC are 0.683, 1.224 and 3.103 eV for KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The 980 nm LD (1.26 eV) radiation could assist the carriers escaping from TA and TB, so it could be concluded that the electrons captured by the two shallow traps are involved in the UC process and could contribute to the synergistic effect. Furthermore, compared with s2, s1 and s3 exhibit stronger intensities in the TL spectra. As discussed above, a QPA is observed in s1 and s3. Therefore, the TL spectrum of s3 after heat treatment at 300 °C is recorded as shown in Fig. 5(a). It is found that deep trap TC disappears after the heat treatment and at the same time the QPA is eliminated as shown in Fig. 5(b). The slopes are 1.09 and 2.40 with the pump power increased under dual 377 and 980 nm excitation. A scale of error bars of slopes and XRD pattern of s3 after treatment are shown in Fig. S1(b–d) and S2,† respectively. It suggests that both UC and DC processes happen in the heat-treated sample under dual excitation of 377 and 980 nm with a lower power, while a two-photon process occurs with a higher power of 980 nm LD. Thereby, it is safe to say the deep traps located in 553 K of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs lead to the QPA phenomenon. The releasing of carriers from deep trap TC is probably with the assistance of shallow traps, which act as a bridge from the deep trap to energy levels under 980 nm LD leading to a multi-photon UC process. Moreover, nearly a third of the 980 nm (1.26 eV) photon energy may cooperate on kicking off the electrons. Both could be assumed to lead to the sudden increasing of the photons. To demonstrate the energy transfer interactions between deep traps and energy levels, decay curves of 2H11/2 and 4F9/2 states of s3 before and after heat treatment are recorded under 980 nm NIR LD excitation, as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. The decay curves can be well-fitted via the double-exponential equation: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2(−t/τ2)(2)where I is the photoluminescence intensity of Er3+; A1 and A2 are constants; t is time; and τ1 and τ2 are the luminescence lifetimes. Moreover, the average lifetime τ* can be estimated as: τ* = (A1τ12 + A2τ22)/(A2τ2 + A2τ2)(3) Fig. 5  TL spectra of the s1, s2, s3 and after heat-treatment of s3 after the irradiation 20 min by UV light (the inset shows the fitting curves of s3) (a), the power dependent photoluminescence intensity changes of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs under 980 nm excitation (red lines) and 377 and 980 nm dual excitation (black lines) of s3 after 300 °C heat-treatment (b), the decay curves of s3 before and after heat-treatment monitored the emission of 543 nm (c), and 668 nm (d).

A simplified energy level scheme for the synergistic effect of Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped KLu2F7 system with a possible photoluminescence mechanism is depicted in Fig. 6. In the sensitizer-emitter pair Yb3+ and Er3+ system, with the absorption of the excitation photons, the electrons are excited into the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ and then decay back to the ground state 2F7/2. Since the excited state of Yb3+ ion (2F5/2) is resonant with the 4I11/2 level of Er3+, highly efficient energy transfer takes place, leading to the excitation of a nearby electron from 4I15/2 into the 4I11/2 level of Er3+. Subsequently, a fraction of the electrons in the excited level of Er3+ decay to 4I13/2 level and get excited to the 4F9/2 level via energy transfer from a nearby Yb3+ ion, then a red emission centred at 668 nm occurs from 4F9/2 to 4I15/2. Before the decay of the electrons in the 4I11/2 level of Er3+, they will be excited to the 4F7/2 level and rapidly decay to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels non-radiatively. Then UC green emission occurs located at 525 and 543 nm. Upon excitation by 377 nm, the green and red emission originate from the energy transition of 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 of Er3+ after successive multiphoton nonradiative relaxation from the 4G11/2 to 4F9/2 state. One sees that the co-operative DC and UC of Er3+ combines 377 nm UV from 4G11/2 meta-stable state with the 980 nm IR UC, and populates simultaneously 4F9/2 state of Er3+ two times, giving enhanced 668 nm red emission of s3 as shown in Fig. 2(d). The electrons in the long lifetime state 4I11/2 of Er3+ ion from the nonradiative relaxation process in the DC route can be excited again by the 980 nm IR photons in the UC route. It is a possible reason for the synergistic effect (step 1). Energy obtained from the relaxation of the populated 4G11/2 to 4I9/2 acting as a resource of excitation could excite electrons at 4I11/2 to a higher excited level, which is probably devoted to synergistic effect as well (step 2). More interestingly, the existence of the trapping state near the excited states might increase the probability of capturing the electrons excited by 377 nm (step 3). Electrons captured in shallow traps could be released under the excitation of 980 nm LD, which participates in the synergistic effect. For carriers captured at deep traps, energy of three or more 980 nm photons is needed to kick off the electrons. After annealing, the deep traps eliminate and the UC photons are decreased from four to two. It indicates that the existence of deep traps results in the happening of QPA, which has been proved above. It suggests that trap states may act as a bridge or mediation, benefiting to the energy migration from the nonradiative process of 377 nm to the re-excitation of Er3+ with the transition of 4I11/2 → 4F7/2. Various defect structures could be formed in these samples, which strongly influences the upconversion processes of Er3+, hence, generating different synergistic effect results in these samples.

Conclusions
In conclusion, various morphologies of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ NPs were obtained via hydrothermal synthesis with different reaction conditions. The synergistic effect was observed under dual-excitation of UV light 377 and IR 980 nm LD, which benefitted from re-exciting electrons in 4I11/2 combination with 377 nm UV from 4G11/2 meta-stable state with the 980 nm IR UC as well as the released electrons captured by traps. The above process could contribute to making use of NIR spectrum as well as decreasing thermalization loss in amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells. Due to the existence of deep traps, the interesting phenomenon QPA occurred. It attempts to highlight the possibility of expanding the scope of the combination of luminescent materials and solar cells by manipulating the interplay of lanthanide and dual excitation source interactions at the nanoscale.
