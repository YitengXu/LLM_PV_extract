The concentration of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution influenced both the film thickness and the Zr4+ concentration in the resulting films. Zr doping was found to enhance the photocurrent for water splitting; the highest photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.33 mA cm−2) for the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 film was approximately 7.2 times higher than that for the undoped film (0.045 mA cm−2). Additionally, the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) at 360 nm and 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) increased from 3.8% to 13.6%. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy suggests that Zr doping may influence PEC performance by reducing the rate of electron–hole recombination.
Introduction
Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is considered to be a promising material for solar water splitting photoanodes1,2 due to its chemical stability, abundance, and non-toxicity. Additionally, its band gap is approximately 2.0–2.2 eV, which facilitates the absorption of about 40% of incident solar light.3 As a result, the maximum theoretical efficiency for solar energy conversion is 14–16.8% for α-Fe2O3 photoanodes.4,5 To date, the reported solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies for α-Fe2O3 films have not attained this value. The poor performance is mainly attributed to the material's intrinsically low conductivity and short hole diffusion length, which is associated with fast charge carrier recombination rates.6,7
Doping with metal atoms has been theoretically and experimentally proven to be effective for improving the electronic conductivity of α-Fe2O3.4,8–10 For application as a photoanode material, α-Fe2O3 has been doped with a number of metals: Ti, Zr, Pt, Sn, Cr, and Mo.11–15 In most cases, observed improvements in PEC performance were attributed to improved conductivity via the small polaron hopping mechanism.16,17 Recently, high efficiency was reported for Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes: the IPCE at 400 nm under an applied bias of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl for water splitting in alkaline solution was measured to be 27.2%.18 Carrier collection at interfaces can also be improved when the photoanode is designed to possess dimensions that match carrier diffusion lengths. For instance, a significant increase in water oxidation photocurrent was observed for dendritic nanostructures, where the distance for photogenerated holes to diffuse to the Fe2O3–electrolyte interface was minimized.19 A high IPCE of 46% at 400 nm was measured for a nanonet-based α-Fe2O3 electrode, in which the nanonets served a dual role as a structural support and an efficient charge collector.20 Efforts have also focused on one-dimensional α-Fe2O3 nanostructures (e.g., nanorods, nanotubes, etc.), which also reduce the transport distance required for charge carriers to reach the semiconductor–electrolyte interface.21–25 Recently, doped one-dimensional α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have been investigated.26–30 For example, urchin-like Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorods have shown much higher photocurrent density than undoped α-Fe2O3 nanorod films.31 The highest IPCE measured for the Ti-doped sample was about 60% (at 350 nm), which was comparable to the highest values in the literature.31 The high IPCE can be attributed to both the favorable morphology and Ti doping, which increases the effective surface area, reduces electron–hole recombination, and increases the donor density in α-Fe2O3.
Motivated by previous work conducted on metal dopants, this study reports the physical and PEC characterization of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. The effect of Zr doping on the α-Fe2O3 film morphology, charge carrier dynamics, and PEC properties was investigated in detail.
Experimental section
Fabrication of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays
Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were grown on FTO glass in an aqueous solution as reported by Vayssieres,32 with minor modification. Typically, two back-to-back FTO substrates (Pilkington, TEC7) were inserted into a cap-sealed glass bottle containing an aqueous solution of 0.15 M ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O), 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3), and desired amounts of zirconyl nitrate (ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O). The pH values of these aqueous solutions were set at 1.35 ± 0.05. The glass bottles were then transferred into a regular oven and kept at 100 °C for 24 h before naturally cooling to room temperature. The obtained yellow films were washed with distilled water and dried, then annealed at 750 °C for 5 min with a ramping rate of 25 °C min−1. The obtained Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were denoted ZrFe-x (x = 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1), where x represents the weight (g) of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O dissolved in the precursor solution.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a Hitachi environmental field emission scanning electron microscope (Model S-4300SE/N) operating in secondary electron detection mode. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were taken on a JEOL 7800F SEM with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Raman scattering studies were performed on a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer using 514.5 nm irradiation from an argon ion laser at 20 mW. Spectral transmittance measurements were taken on the samples using a commercial thin film metrology system (Scientific Computing International, FilmTek Par 3000 SE). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Kratos spectrometer (AXIS Ultra DLD) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.69 eV) and with a concentric hemispherical analyzer. The ultrafast laser system was based on a Quantronix-designed femtosecond transient absorption laser system,33 which consisted of an Er-doped fiber oscillator, a regenerative amplifier, and a diode-pumped, Q-switched, second-harmonic Nd:YLF pump laser (527 nm, 10 W capacity). After amplification, the as-generated fundamental beam (∼800 nm, 750 Hz repetition rate) was split in a 1:9 ratio to generate both a white light continuum (WLC) probe pulse as well as to feed an optical parametric amplifier, respectively. The optical parametric amplifier output was tuned to 500 nm with a pulse duration of ∼180 fs. Pump power was modulated by the use of absorptive neutral density filters before illuminating the sample. The pump and probe beams were overlapped spatially and temporally at the sample. The spectra were recorded after excitation with a 500 nm pump and interrogation with the WLC probe (450–800 nm) over a temporal delay interval of 0–1000 ps between the pump and probe pulses. The time delay between the pump and probe was varied by a motor-controlled translation stage with 1 μm resolution (3 fs resolution). The difference absorption of each sample was measured over the aforementioned interval four times and the data averaged to achieve lower overall noise.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
PEC measurements were performed using a three-electrode configuration in 0.5 M NaCl (pH 6.7) aqueous solution with a potentiostat (Pine Instruments Bipotentiostat), with Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays as the working photoanodes, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt as the counter electrode. A 1 cm2 masked-off, sealed area of the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp solar simulator with adjustable power settings through an AM 1.5 G filter (Oriel). The light intensity at the sample location in the PEC cell was 100 mW cm−2 as measured by a power detector (Newport). N2 gas was continuously bubbled through the solution before and during the experiment to remove any dissolved O2 and therefore suppress the reduction of O2 at the counter electrode.
IPCE measurements were performed using a 300 W Xe lamp integrated with a computer-controlled monochromator (Beijing Optic Instrument Factory), a photochopper (PARC) and a lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery) used for photocurrent detection. The absolute intensity of the incident light from the monochromator was measured with a radiometer/photometer (International Light). All IPCE measurements were carried out under potential-controlled conditions, with 0.65 V as the applied potential versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (i.e., 1.23 V vs. RHE, calculated from the Nernst equation ERHE = EAg/AgCl + EoAg/AgCl + 0.057pH).
Results and discussion
The crystal structure of the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), both the undoped and Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films displayed Raman bands typical of α-Fe2O3, A1g (222.6, 496.5 cm−1), Eg (242.7, 291.2, 408.6, 609.7 cm−1), and 2-magnon scattering (1314.2 cm−1) bands.34 For the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films, an additional band located at around 657.0 cm−1 was observed. This Raman band can be assigned to a disorder phase induced by Zr doping,35 but not the phase of FeO or Fe3O4, as no Fe 2p XPS peak assigned to Fe2+ species was observed (see below). Such disorder was also detected by Raman spectra in α-Fe2O3 films doped with Pt4+, Cr3+, or W6+.26,27,36
In this study, α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays with diameters of 50–80 nm were obtained after a high temperature annealing process, as shown in Fig. 1A. The influence of Zr doping on the morphology of α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was investigated by SEM. Fig. 1B–E demonstrate that Zr doping does not significantly change the morphology of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods. Doping leads to a more sparse distribution of nanorods with the increasing amount of ZrO(NO3)2, especially for ZrFe-0.02 (Fig. 1E). Further increase of ZrO(NO3)2 concentration results in partial destruction of the nanorods along with the emergence of nanosized particles on the surface of the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films (Fig. 1F and G). As shown in Fig. 1H, the nanoparticles on the surface of ZrFe-0.1 are ca. 300–450 nm in diameter. Grätzel et al. demonstrated that Si dopants in α-Fe2O3 acted as a structure directing agent, and led to the considerably smaller size of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 than undoped α-Fe2O3.19,37 It is accepted that the finer the particles, the larger the surface area that constitutes the photoanode films, and the less likely premature charge carrier recombination will be, which results in higher PEC activity.15,38 However, in the present study, Zr doping did not give rise to great morphological changes in the nanorods, which had diameters very similar to those of the undoped α-Fe2O3 nanorod film. Moreover, large sized nanoparticles emerged in the ZrFe-0.1 film at high doping level, which would not benefit the charge carrier separation and hence the PEC activity, as discussed below. Thus, the change in film thickness for these Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films should be taken into account.

The influence of Zr doping on the thickness of the α-Fe2O3 films was found to be somewhat complicated. The thickness of the undoped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was ca. 600 nm (Fig. 2A). With increasing ZrO(NO3)2 concentration, the thickness of Zr-doped nanorod films increased to ca. 800 nm (Fig. 2B and C), and then decreased to ca. 500 nm (Fig. 2D–F), and again increased to ca. 750 nm (Fig. 2G). Such notable changes in film thickness together with the morphology variation originate from the inclusion of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution utilized for Zr doping. It has been demonstrated that any adsorption phenomenon at the water–oxide interface will decrease the surface tension during nanocrystal nucleation and growth from aqueous solution.39 Thus, the addition of the Zr precursor will change the thermodynamic growth conditions and alter the physical properties of the crystal faces and interfaces.40 Although a detailed model for film growth is not possible here, it is predicted that Zr species are involved in the film growth process, which gives rise to the varied morphologies and thicknesses of the resultant α-Fe2O3 nanostructures.

Zr doping into the α-Fe2O3 nanorod films was confirmed by XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the binding energies of the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 levels for all the films are ca. 711.0 and 724.5 eV (see Fig. S2A, ESI†), respectively, with an energy difference of 13.5 eV, which indicates that the iron ions mainly exist as Fe3+ in the formation of α-Fe2O3. Sn4+ ions are also detected by XPS at the surface of both undoped and Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays (Fig. S2B, ESI†). The XPS observation of Sn at the surface of α-Fe2O3 films has been reported, and is likely due to Sn diffusion from FTO to α-Fe2O3 during high temperature annealing.25,41 In Fig. S2C (ESI†), all the Zr-doped films show clear Zr 3d peaks at 182.2 and 184.5 eV. The positions of these two peaks are consistent with Zr in the fully oxidized Zr4+ state.42 The surface molar ratios of Zr:Fe and Sn:Fe for Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were also determined by XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), with the increasing concentration of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution, the molar ratio of Zr:Fe at the surface of the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays first increased then leveled out at ∼0.030–0.035. The molar ratio of Sn:Fe is ∼0.010–0.015 for both undoped and doped α-Fe2O3 films, due to Sn diffusion from the FTO substrates.
The depth and lateral distribution of Zr in the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films were examined by an XPS Ar+ etching measurement and SEM-EDS elemental mapping. We consider ZrFe-0.005 as a representative sample. XPS measurements were conducted during controlled Ar+ etching from 0 to 1270 s. As shown in Fig. 3, one can observe that the molar ratio of Zr:Fe decreases dramatically, and then remains near 0.01 after etching for longer than 20 seconds. The high concentration of Zr dopants at the surface of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods may be due to the absorption of Zr4+ ions on the surface of the β-FeOOH film initially grown on the FTO substrate in the precursor solution. The Zr concentration is uniform in the bulk, suggesting the homogeneous incorporation of Zr into the β-FeOOH lattice during the solution-based growth process. It is reasonable that Sn shows the gradient distribution along with the increasing depth (Fig. 3) due to Sn diffusion from the FTO substrate during the high temperature annealing process.41 Furthermore, SEM-EDS mapping (Fig. 4) shows a Zr signal that spatially correlates with the Fe and O, indicating the homogenous lateral distribution of Zr over the entire α-Fe2O3 nanorod film. Similar depth and lateral distribution of Zr were again observed in the ZrFe-0.1 film (Fig. S4 and 5, ESI†), indicating that Zr species do not exist as discrete nanoparticles, even though Zr alters the morphology of the films.

The spectral transmittance of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The spectra of both undoped and Zr-doped films show features typical of α-Fe2O3, with a transmittance onset of about 575 nm. The band gap energy, as calculated from the spectral transmittance in Fig. S6A (ESI†) using the Kubelka–Munk equation, was ca. 2.1 eV for all α-Fe2O3 samples (Fig. S6B, ESI†), which is very close to the reported values.43 This is attributed to the well-known indirect Fe3+ 3d–d transitions. No obvious changes in the optical transmittance of α-Fe2O3 caused by Zr incorporation could be observed at different doping concentrations. The negligible effect of Zr doping on the band gap has been reported for α-Fe2O3 films doped with other metal ions, such as Ti4+, Sn4+.44,45
The PEC performance for both undoped and Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays was examined by current–potential scans in 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte (pH = 6.7) under illumination with solar simulated light (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 5. Here, as previously reported,46–48 NaCl aqueous solution has been used as the electrolyte to decrease the effect of O2 overpotential for PEC water splitting, mainly because Cl− ions, competing with OH− ions, could be oxidized by photogenerated holes at the photoanode.49 Zr doping is found to improve the PEC activity of the α-Fe2O3 films. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5, increasing the concentration of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution increases the photocurrent by a factor of 7.2, from 0.046 mA cm−2 for the undoped α-Fe2O3 film to a maximum value of 0.33 mA cm−2 for the ZrFe-0.005 film. Further increasing the concentration of Zr results in a rapid decrease in the photocurrent to a minimal value of 0.12 mA cm−2 for the ZrFe-0.02. Surprisingly, a further increase in the ZrO(NO3)2 concentration again results in an increase in the PEC activity, with photocurrent measured at 0.26 mA cm−2 for the ZrFe-0.1 film. The IPCE for these Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays shows a similar trend with ZrO(NO3)2 concentration. As shown in Fig. 6, the IPCEs of α-Fe2O3, ZrFe-0.005 and ZrFe-0.1 nanorod arrays as photoanodes at 360 nm are estimated to be 3.8%, 13.6% and 9.6%, respectively.

As discussed previously, the mass of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution mainly influences the film thickness and Zr doping concentration of the obtained Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. It is well known that film thickness is an important factor for PEC activity since it affects light absorption and carrier collection.50 In previous studies,34,51 optimized film thickness was found to be necessary for efficient PEC water splitting by balancing the light absorption and the carrier extraction. On the other hand, metal ion doping improves electrical conductivity and hence promotes charge transfer ability for enhanced PEC activity.1 Furthermore, the positive effects of large sized nanoparticles on the PEC activity could be excluded for the high Zr doping level (ZrFe-0.1), as small sized nanoparticles, rather than large ones, are believed to shorten the diffusion distance that holes must transfer to the α-Fe2O3–electrolyte interface.15,19,37,38 It is thus expected that either film thickness or Zr concentration should be responsible for the enhancement of PEC performance.
Fig. 7 shows the film thickness, Zr doping concentration, as well as photocurrent (at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) plotted versus the amount of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution. The relationship in lineshape among these curves indicates that thickness is an important factor influencing PEC performance. In order to understand the mechanism by which Zr incorporation influences efficiency, we conducted additional studies that should yield information independent of electrode thickness.

Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of Zr doping on the charge carrier dynamics in α-Fe2O3 films following photoexcitation with a 500 nm pump. The spectral evolution of the transient absorption for each film is presented in Fig. 8. As can be seen for each sample, there is a blue shift of the maximum transient signal, from ∼590 nm to ∼580 nm, over the full 1000 ps delay time. This indicates that initial relaxation processes occur at a lower energy than those of longer time scales. Fig. 9 shows the normalized, single wavelength ultrafast transient absorption profiles of undoped and Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 (ZrFe-0.005 and ZrFe-0.02) films for 0–10 and 0–300 ps time windows. These kinetic traces were fitted to a triple-exponential convolved with a Gaussian, representing the cross-correlation of the 500 nm pump and 587 nm probe pulses. Time constants of 0.55 ± 0.05, 8.5 ± 4.5, and 3300 ps were obtained for α-Fe2O3. Time constants of 0.40 ± 0.05, 11 ± 2.5, and 7000 ps, and 0.50 ± 0.05, 12.0 ± 3.0, and 7000 ps were obtained for ZrFe-0.005 and ZrFe-0.02, respectively. It should be noted that in each case, the longest time constant is not considered an accurate value as it exceeds the time delay at which the data was collected. The overall charge carrier decay for α-Fe2O3 is very fast, with relatively low transient absorption levels remaining after 300 ps. Indeed, there is a rapid loss of photoexcited electrons within the first few ps for each of the three films, indicating significant and swift electron–hole recombination. This observation is commonly observed for α-Fe2O3 nanostructures and is typically attributed to the high density of electronic states in the band gap caused by both internal and surface defects. Thus, the early time dynamics of each system are dominated by the intrinsic properties of α-Fe2O3 and not strongly influenced by the morphology or thickness of the films.4 Indeed, the time constants extracted for each decay profile were approximately equivalent. At timescales above a few ps, however, the absorption intensities of both Zr-doped films are higher than that of the undoped sample. This result may indicate a reduction in electron–hole recombination in Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films at long time scales. Reduced electron–hole recombination could contribute significantly to the enhanced PEC performance associated with doping, a result which was previously reported for Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films.15 Further comparison between the two Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 films shows that the absorption signal on the 100 ps time scale for the ZrFe-0.005 sample is higher than that of ZrFe-0.02 sample, which also correlates with their PEC performance.

A pulse-width-limited (<180 fs) rise is followed by a triple exponential fast decay and illustrates the probe wavelength-dependence of the transient absorption kinetic decay processes across part of the visible spectrum.

The decay profiles are fitted simultaneously using a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm to a triple-exponential decay convolved with a Gaussian, representing the cross correlation of the 500 nm pump and 587 nm probe pulses. 
Briefly, the proposed mechanism for the enhanced PEC performance could be explained by a reduced electron–hole recombination, mainly due to the increased electrical conductivity induced by Zr doping. Meanwhile, film thickness also affects the optical absorption and charge extraction. Thus, the PEC performances of the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays as photoanodes were reasonably altered depending on the mass of the Zr dopant precursor (ZrO(NO3)2).
Conclusions
In this study, we presented the influence of Zr incorporation on the physical and PEC properties of α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. The concentration of Zr species in the precursor solution influenced both the film thickness and the Zr concentration in resulting films. Zr doping was found to be effective in enhancing the photocurrent for water splitting. The photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (0.33 mA cm−2) for the Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 film was approximately 7.2 times higher than that for the undoped film (0.045 mA cm−2); IPCE at 360 nm and 1.23 V vs. RHE increased from 3.8% to 13.6%. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show that there is significant decay of photoexcited charge carriers, indicative of significant electron–hole recombination, on early time scales regardless of morphology or thickness. However, the results also suggest that Zr doping may influence PEC performance by reducing the rate of electron–hole recombination on a longer time scale.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Top view SEM images of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. (A) α-Fe2O3, (B) ZrFe-0.002, (C) ZrFe-0.005, (D) ZrFe-0.01, (E) ZrFe-0.02, (F) ZrFe-0.05, (G and H) ZrFe-0.1.	 

 	Fig. 2  Cross-sectional SEM images of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. (A) α-Fe2O3, (B) ZrFe-0.002, (C) ZrFe-0.005, (D) ZrFe-0.01, (E) ZrFe-0.02, (F) ZrFe-0.05, (G) ZrFe-0.1.	 

 	Fig. 3  XPS etching profile of the ZrFe-0.005 film showing the distribution of Zr and Sn as a function of depth.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM-EDS mapping of the ZrFe-0.005 film showing the lateral distribution of Fe, O and Zr.	 

 	Fig. 5  Current vs. potential curves of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays as photoanodes. The inset shows the photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl plotted as a function of the mass of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution.	 

 	Fig. 6  IPCE of α-Fe2O3, ZrFe-0.005, and ZrFe-0.1 nanorod arrays as photoanodes at 0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.23 V vs. RHE).	 

 	Fig. 7  Photocurrent at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, Zr:Fe molar ratio, and film thickness of Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays as a function of the amount of ZrO(NO3)2 in the precursor solution. (A) α-Fe2O3, (B) ZrFe-0.002, (C) ZrFe-0.005, (D) ZrFe-0.01, (E) ZrFe-0.02, (F) ZrFe-0.05, (G) ZrFe-0.1.	 

 	Fig. 8  Three-dimensional representation of the transient difference absorption of (A) α-Fe2O3, (B) Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 (ZrFe-0.005) and (C) Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 (ZrFe-0.02) films. A pulse-width-limited (<180 fs) rise is followed by a triple exponential fast decay and illustrates the probe wavelength-dependence of the transient absorption kinetic decay processes across part of the visible spectrum.	 

 	Fig. 9  Normalized ultrafast transient absorption decay profiles of undoped and Zr-doped α-Fe2O3 (ZrFe-0.005 and ZrFe-0.02) films in 0–10 ps (inset) and 0–300 ps windows. The decay profiles are fitted simultaneously using a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm to a triple-exponential decay convolved with a Gaussian, representing the cross correlation of the 500 nm pump and 587 nm probe pulses.
