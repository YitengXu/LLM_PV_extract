    , Accepted 4th March 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractA ∼70% improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) is observed for the devices fabricated with a binary hybrid composite of graphitic carbon nitride and zinc oxide nanorods, i.e., (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) [η ≈ 2.43%, for an optimized weight ratio (0.5:1)] as compared to the pristine ZnO NR device (η ≈ 0.65%). Systematic investigations reveal that g-C3N4 boosts the light harvesting ability of the photovoltaic devices primarily by impeding photo-induced electron interception to the redox couple and injecting electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis shows a reduced tunneling of photo-induced electrons to the sulfide–polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox shuttle in the case of (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices. Higher recombination resistance (Rk) indicates that the g-C3N4 sheet acts as a barrier for photo-induced electron interception at the working electrode/electrolyte interface. Preliminary investigation using steady state and dynamic photoluminescence analyses suggest a similar fact about the photo-induced electron injection from g-C3N4 sheets to ZnO, contributing to the enhanced light harvesting ability of (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices.
Introduction
The exploration of non-toxic, low cost, environmentally benign semiconductor materials with high solar energy conversion abilities is a fascinating subject of research amongst the scientific community, due to their potential applicability toward resolving the overuse of fossil fuels as well as fulfilling the demand for clean energy.1–3 To date, a number of UV or visible light responsive materials have been introduced for harvesting the most abundant renewable energy source — solar energy — to produce electrical energy or chemical fuels, such as hydrogen, on a large scale.4–7 Recently, Wang et al. introduced a low cost, photoactive polymeric organic semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), as a solar energy harvester with high efficacy showing promise for practical use in hydrogen production by photocatalytic and photo-electrochemical methods.8–10 g-C3N4 is an analog of graphite having a tectonic structure with tri-s-triazine repeating units. It has a medium optical band gap (∼2.77 eV) along with unique stability, including heat endurance (as high as 600 °C) and chemical resistance.11–13 However, the radiative recombination rate of photogenerated electrons (e−) and holes (h+) in pure g-C3N4 is very high, resulting in high fluorescence yield, limiting its beneficial effects in photovoltaic device performance.14,15 One of the practical approach to reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated (e−–h+) pairs or the excitons is the coupling of g-C3N4 with semiconductor materials like ZnO, TiO2, WO3, SrTiO3, CdS, etc., with well-matched band edge alignments.16–20 The low-lying conduction band (CB) edge of these semiconductors as compared to g-C3N4, facilitates a favorable excited state electron transfer process from g-C3N4 to the semiconductor, leading to a reduction in the radiative annihilation of photogenerated excitons. In particular, the tunable optical and charge transport properties of ZnO established it as a suitable material to design a composite with g-C3N4 for solar energy harvesting. The optical and charge transport properties of ZnO can be tuned by tailoring it into various architectures of different dimensions such as nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods (NRs), nanodisks, nanosheets, microspheres, cages etc.21–26 For example, ZnO NRs endowed with a minimum density of grain boundaries and charge trapping sites relative to its counterpart ZnO NPs, wherein photo-generated electrons have to interact repeatedly with the grain boundary induced trap sites.27,28 Diverse morphologies of ZnO having unique electrical and optical properties can be achieved by varying the synthetic procedure which opens up its potential application in a wide spectrum of areas such as photocatalysis, gas sensing, optical devices, dye sensitized or quantum dot sensitized solar cells (DSSC/QDSSC).29–33 Various research groups have reported an enhanced photocatalytic performance by (g-C3N4–ZnO) composites with different ZnO morphologies which demonstrates a facile electronic interaction within the composite.34,35 However, a systematic investigation on the effect of g-C3N4 on photovoltaic device performance is still scarce and needs to be explored.36 In view of the appropriate band edge alignments of g-C3N4 and ZnO, as well as the high stability of g-C3N4, a composite (g-C3N4–ZnO) is utilized as a photoanodic material sensitized with CdS, for the first time in the present work. Previously, our group has also reported various methodologies for utilization of coupled semiconductor composites and materials with different dimensions in QDSSC devices to enhance the light harvesting ability.37–40
Herein, we have performed a systematic study on the effects of g-C3N4 on the photovoltaic performance parameters of ZnO NR based CdS QD sensitized solar cell devices by introducing a binary hybrid composite of g-C3N4 and ZnO, i.e., (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) in the photoanodic segment. To optimize the g-C3N4 loading in the photoanode, a systematic evaluation of the photovoltaic parameters for (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites by varying the g-C3N4 to ZnO weight ratio has been performed. The addition of g-C3N4 sheets to the photoanodes is found to reduce the reverse tunneling probability of photo-induced electrons to the redox couple, leading to a better light harvesting ability. Moreover, the injection of photoexcited electrons from g-C3N4 sheets to ZnO increases the charge collection at the external load. A comparative study of (g-C3N4–ZnO) devices based on various morphologies (i.e., NR and NP) shows that the performance parameters of ZnO NR based devices are superior, suggesting a better/smoother electron pathway.
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals and reagents used in the synthetic processes were of analytical grade and no further purification was performed. The chemicals used were: urea (from Loba Chemie), ethanol (TMEDA), terpineol (Himedia), a triblock copolymer: poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG-PPG-PEG (Sigma Aldrich), chloroplatinic acid (Sigma Aldrich) and all other chemicals such as, zinc nitrate hexahydrate, zinc chloride (anhydrous), ammonium hydroxide, hexamethylenetetramine, cadmium nitrate hexahydrate, sodium sulfide, methanol, sulfur powder, potassium chloride, hydrochloric acid, 2-propanol, acetone were obtained from Merck, India. Thermoplastic sealant material with low melting point was procured from Dyesol, Australia. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates having sheet resistances of 10–15 Ω cm−2 were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, USA and used as a substrate for both electrodes. For all the experiments high grade Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm−1) was used.
Synthesis of g-C3N4
The polymeric g-C3N4 sheets were synthesized by thermal polycondensation of urea followed by the decomposition.41 In a typical synthesis process, 2 g of urea was taken in a mortar pestle and it was ground for about 10 min. The ground urea was then put into an alumina crucible with a cover and placed in a muffle furnace for heat treatment. The furnace temperature was raised up to 500 °C at a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1 and maintained at this temperature in air for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature in normal condition, the product was taken out and again ground into fine powers in an agate mortar.
Synthesis of ZnO NRs
For the synthesis of ZnO NRs, 10 mmol of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (2.97 g) was dissolved in 50 mL of Milli-Q water with constant stirring. An equimolar amount of hexamine (0.7 g) was added into the reaction mixture and the solution was heated at a temperature of 90 °C for 4 h with constant stirring. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant precipitate was centrifuged and purified by washing with water and ethanol several times. The as obtained product was dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C for 6 h and then calcined it at 450 °C for 1 h to get the final product.
Synthesis of ZnO NPs
ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by adopting a previously reported procedure.42 In this synthetic procedure, 40 mmol of ZnCl2 (1.1 g) was dissolved in Milli-Q water (40.0 mL) and heated up to a temperature of 90 °C with constant stirring. An aqueous solution of NaOH (5 M, 3.2 mL) was added slowly into the reaction mixture with constant stirring at the same temperature for another 30 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature normally and the precipitate was separated out by discarding the supernatant liquid. For purification, this precipitate was washed with distilled water several times and dispersed in isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min at room temperature. The solution was centrifuged and dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C for 6 h. Finally, ZnO nanoparticles are obtained via calcination at 450 °C for 1 h in a muffle furnace.
Preparation of (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) and (g-C3N4–ZnO NP) composites
The g-C3N4 composites of ZnO NR and ZnO NP were prepared by ultra-sonication treatment of g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO heterostructures (i.e., NR and NPs). In detail, an appropriate amount of as synthesized g-C3N4 was dispersed in ethanol under ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. The as synthesized ZnO NRs or ZnO NPs were added into solution and the ultrasonic treatment was continued for another 1 h. Finally, the solution was placed inside a hot air oven to evaporate the solvent to obtain the composite product which was named as (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) or (g-C3N4–ZnO NP). A series of (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites were prepared by following same methodology with different weight ratios of g-C3N4 to ZnO NR.
Fabrication of photoanodes and devices
The photoanodes with (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites were fabricated by preparing a homogeneous paste of the composite powders. For the preparation of the paste, appropriate amounts of terpineol and the triblock copolymer, “PEG-PPG-PEG”, were added to the powders as binder materials and they were mixed well in an agate mortar. This homogenous paste was applied to a pre-cleaned conductive glass substrate, i.e. FTO, via the doctor blade technique and was then dried in a hot air oven at 90 °C for 3 h. After cooling down to room temperature normally, all the films were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the binder. The thicknesses of the photoanodic films were measured by surface profilometer and they were found to be in the range of 10–12 μm. The photoanodes were sensitized with the CdS QDs via the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. In the sensitization process, the electrodes were first dipped into an ethanolic solution of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.5 M) for 5 min, rinsed with ethanol, and dried using a hot air drier. Again they were dipped into a Na2S (0.5 M) solution in methanol for 5 min, rinsed with methanol and dried at 70 °C on a hot plate. The amount of CdS grown onto the photoanodes was controlled by the number of repeated SILAR cycles. A pictorial presentation of the step by step composite preparation and photoanode fabrication processes along with expected energy transfer processes in the device is shown in Scheme 1.

Similarly, the (g-C3N4–ZnO NP) composite based photoanodes were fabricated by following the same procedure used for the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by spin coating a solution of chloroplatinic acid (5 mM in isopropanol) on a pre-cleaned FTO substrate followed by the calcination at 450 °C for 30 min (heating ramp of 5 °C min−1) in a muffle furnace and naturally cooling down to room temperature. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated by sandwiching the photoanodes and counter electrodes. An electrolyte solution of sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) was added after sealing the device by using low-temperature thermoplastic sealant, (thickness ∼ 50 μm). The sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 1 M sulfur powder, 1 M Na2S and 0.2 KCl in Milli-Q water. The active area for all fabricated devices was fixed and it was found to be 0.5 cm2. Before the photovoltaic measurements the fabricated devices were kept under dark conditions for 24 h.
Measurements and material characterization
The crystal structures of as synthesized materials were determined by the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements and for this analysis, a Bruker D2 PHASER X-ray diffractometer with (Cu-Kα) X-ray generator (λ = 1.54 Å) was used with an operating voltage of 30 kV and current of 10 mA. The scan rate was fixed at 0.1° s−1 for recording the PXRD patterns in a wide range of 2θ (i.e., 5–80°). Surface morphological characteristics of the as synthesized materials were investigated by FESEM analysis which was performed using a Zeiss (Gemini) instrument operated at the voltages of 3 and 4 kV. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out in a JEOL JEM 2100 microscope with an operating voltage of 200 kV. The optical properties of as synthesized materials were investigated with a JASCO Model V-650 spectrophotometer which was equipped to record diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra (DRS). The spectrometer has a 150 mm integrating sphere wherein BaSO4 was used as an internal standard. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out using a Horiba-Jobin Yvon Fluoromax 4C spectrophotometer. To determine the exciton lifetimes of as synthesized materials, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were performed by using a LifeSpec II Edinburgh instrument at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis was carried out by nitrogen (N2) adsorption at liquid N2 temperature with a Beckman-Coulter SA 3100 N2 adsorption apparatus. Prior to the surface area analysis, samples were degassed at 150 °C for 4 h. A Veeco Dektak-150 surface profilometer was used to estimate the thickness of the photoanodic films. Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements for the photovoltaic devices were recorded using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under an AM 1.5G solar simulator with a power of 100 mW cm−2. The incident to photon current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was evaluated on a Newport ORIEL IQE-200 instrument fitted with a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp calibrated by standard Si and Ge diodes. CH instruments model CHI680E was used to perform EIS measurements for the similar devices.
Results and discussions
Powder X-ray diffraction analysis

Fig. 1 depicts powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns for the as synthesized ZnO NRs, g-C3N4 and their composites. Trace (a) represents the PXRD pattern of ZnO NRs which is defined to be hexagonal wurtzite phase with (100), (0002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) crystal planes. The space group symmetry for ZnO NRs is P63mc and Zn atoms are in tetrahedral sites according to the JCPDS card No. 36-1451. Traces (b)–(f) are PXRD patterns for the g-C3N4–ZnO NR composites with varying g-C3N4 to ZnO NR ratio while trace (g) is the PXRD pattern for pure g-C3N4. No impurity peaks are detected in the PXRD patterns which implies that the products are pure and have no crystalline impurities.

From the PXRD pattern of pure g-C3N4 [trace (g)], two broad diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈ 11.2° and 27.5° with d-spacing values of 0.714 nm and 0.316 nm respectively are observed, which are indexed to (001) and (002) crystal plane reflections for amorphous graphitic material. The diffraction peak at the lower 2θ value corresponds to the characteristic in-plane repeating pattern of tri-s-triazine or melem units while the peak at the higher 2θ value indicates interplanar stacking of conjugated aromatic segments, as in graphite.8,41 Structural information obtained from the analysis of the PXRD pattern of g-C3N4 is presented in Scheme 2.

It should be noted that, as the weight ratio of g-C3N4 to ZnO NR increases from (0.25:1) to (2:1), the intensity of the g-C3N4 diffraction peaks increases simultaneously as we have seen from Fig. 1. This observation is symptomatic of the retention of the crystal structures of both the components, namely g-C3N4 and ZnO NR, in all the composite ratios, even after the composite preparation process.
Material morphology
Morphological and microstructural analysis of as synthesized g-C3N4 is carried out by performing FESEM and TEM studies are shown in Fig. 2. The lower and higher magnification FESEM images of g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 2(A) and (B) respectively. FESEM analysis demonstrates a porous, flake-like layered structure of g-C3N4, similar to graphitic materials. From Fig. 2(B), we can see that the size distribution of most of the g-C3N4 flakes appears to be in submicron range (i.e., 0.5–1 μm). Furthermore, TEM analysis was performed to confirm the layered structure of g-C3N4. Fig. 2(C) and (D) are the TEM image of g-C3N4 and the corresponding selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern respectively. Note that the synthesized g-C3N4 powder was dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic treatment for 30 minutes prior to the TEM sample preparation process.
 Fig. 2  (A) & (B) are FESEM images of g-C3N4 showing flake like features at different magnifications. Trace (C) shows the TEM image of g-C3N4 sheet formation and trace (D) corresponds to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showing a diffused ring pattern, confirming the nano-sized sheet structures. 
The layered structure of g-C3N4 sheets is divulged through the TEM image in Fig. 2(C). g-C3N4 sheets in the TEM image are observed to be bigger in size than they appear in the FESEM images. The probable reason for this observation could be the unfolding and exfoliation of the g-C3N4 flakes during the ultrasonic treatment. The SAED pattern in Fig. 2(D) for the indicated part of TEM image (Fig. 2(C), marked by the blue circle) showing a diffused diffraction ring which implies an amorphous characteristic of the material, consistent with the PXRD analyses.
The morphological characteristics of as synthesized ZnO NRs were investigated by performing FESEM analysis as shown in the images in Figs. 3(A) and (B). A hexagon shaped morphology of the ZnO NRs is evident from the FESEM images and the size distribution is observed to be ∼500 nm. It should be mentioned that, we have synthesized ZnO NPs to evaluate and understand the morphology dependant photovoltaic characteristics of ZnO. Figs. 3(C) and (D) show the FESEM features of the as synthesized ZnO NPs at low and high magnifications respectively. From Fig. 3(C), the homogeneous size distribution of ZnO NPs is observed, while the size range is confirmed to be ∼(50–100) nm from Fig. 3(D).
 Fig. 3  FESEM images (A) and (B) show the as synthesized hexagonal ZnO nanorods (NRs) while traces (C) and (D) represent the ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) at low and high magnifications respectively. 
The formation of two distinct morphologies of ZnO in two different reaction conditions can be explained from the anisotropic growth behaviour of crystal planes.39 It is well known that wurtzite ZnO is a ploar crystal phase with altrenatively stacked O2− and Zn2+ ions along the c-axis, which results in O-terminated (000) and Zn-terminated (0001) crystallographic planes with a high surface energy.43 In general, ZnO nuclei tend to grow faster along these polar crystal planes relative to the non-polar crystal planes such as ±(100), (100), (010), etc., having lower surface energies, those surfaces being composed of an equivalent number of O2− and Zn2+ ions. The faster growth rate of ZnO nuclei along the c-axis results in hexagon shaped ZnO NRs. In the present hydrothermal reaction conditions for the synthesis of ZnO NRs, we have used hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as a base, which readily undergoes hydrolysis in water and gradually produces ammonia (NH3) as well as formaldehyde (HCHO) molecules (step 1, Scheme 2). NH3 molecules produce a basic environment in the reaction for the formation of ZnO growth units such as [Zn(OH)4]2− and [Zn(NH3)4]2+ (step 2, 3, 4, and 5). These growth units preferentially adsorb onto the O-terminated (000) and Zn-terminated (0001) polar surfaces of newly formed ZnO nuclei, leading to a faster growth along the ±(0001) directions and consequently ZnO NRs are formed (step 6).44
In addition, nonionic HMTA molecules can act as a bidentate Lewis base that coordinate two Zn2+ ions.45 As the reaction progresses, unhydrolysed HMTA molecules in the reaction mixture favorably bind to the Zn2+ ions in non-polar crystal facets of ZnO nuclei, which facilitates oriented anisotropic growth along the ±(0001) directions and encourages the formation of ZnO NRs.46 Previously, it was reported that the rate of HMTA hydrolysis (step 1) decreases with increasing pH and vice versa.44 Therefore, it is expected that concentration of unhydrolysed HMTA molecules increases in the reaction mixture as the reaction progresses (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Schematic representation of plausible formation mechanism of ZnO nanorods. 
However, in alkaline medium (i.e., aqueous NaOH) a large amount of OH− ions are released in the reaction mixture within a short period of time. Consequently, due to the high pH environment, Zn2+ ions in the solution would precipitate out quickly as water insoluble Zn(OH)2 and prohibit the oriented growth of ZnO crystal planes.47 As the temperature of the reaction increases, Zn(OH)2 dehydrates to form numerous ZnO nanoparticles, as we have confirmed from the FESEM images shown in Figs. 3(C) and (D).
The traces shown in Figs. 4(A) and (B) depict the FESEM images of the as prepared (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites while traces Figs. 4(C) and (D) represent the (g-C3N4–ZnO NP) composites at different magnifications. From the FESEM images of the composites it is clear that the ZnO NRs and ZnO NPs are well embedded in the g-C3N4 sheets. This may be due to unfolding and exfoliation of g-C3N4 sheets during the ultrasonic treatment. Additionally, a probable preference between polar wurtzite ZnO crystals and delocalized π-electrons as well as non-bonding electrons in the g-C3N4 sheets might have facilitated the embedding process. From the FESEM images in Figs. 4(B) and (D), we can seen a number of bare ZnO NRs and ZnO NPs in the composites, which is beneficial for the optimum loading of CdS QDs onto the ZnO heterostructures for efficient photoexcited electron injection. Note that, photoexcited electron injection from CdS QDs to g-C3N4 sheets is not energetically favorable according to their conduction band (CB) edge alignments whereas charge transfer from the CB of the g-C3N4 sheets to the CdS QDs and ZnO are favorable processes. For confirmation of connection between the two materials (i.e., g-C3N4 and ZnO NR) in the composite, we have performed TEM analysis as depicted in Fig. 5.

 Fig. 5  TEM images of as prepared (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite at lower magnification (image A) and higher magnification (image B) respectively. 

Fig. 5 shows TEM images of the hybrid composite (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) at different magnifications. From the low magnification image (A), it is clear that g-C3N4 sheets are wrapped around the ZnO NRs. The high magnification image (B) further confirms the connection between the g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NRs in the composite. The connection between the two materials in the composite is favorable for electronic interactions and plays a significant role in the better performance of the device.
Diffuse reflectance UV-visible absorption spectra analyses
Diffuse reflectance UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the as prepared (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites with varied g-C3N4 to ZnO NR ratios along with the pristine materials, i.e., g-C3N4 and ZnO NR, are compiled in Fig. 6(A). Fig. 6(B) represents a plot of the optical band gap values estimated from corresponding Tauc plots vs. pristine materials and composites. The inset shows the Tauc plot derived from the absorption profiles of all the materials. From Fig. 6(A), the absorption edges of the as synthesized pure g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NR are observed to be at ∼430 nm and ∼398 nm respectively, corresponding to a band gap of 2.89 eV and 3.1 eV, which are also consistent with the approximate values obtained from the Tauc plots (2.95 eV and 3.17 eV) as well as the band gap values reported previously.41 Moreover, we have observed a distinct blue shift of adsorption edges for all (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites as compared to the pristine materials. This blue shift is also reflected in the increasing sequence of optical band gap values for the composites as shown in Fig. 6(B). The observed sequence is: pure ZnO NR (3.17 eV) < 0.25:1 (3.18 eV) < 0.5:1 (3.19 eV) < 1:1 (3.20 eV) < 1.5:1 (3.205 eV) < 2:1 (3.21 eV). The band gap values are increasing steadily as the weight ratio of g-C3N4 to ZnO increases from (0.25:1) to (2:1). This observation suggests a possible electronic interaction between g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NRs.48 In the absorption spectra, there appears to be a distinct progressive blue shift for the composites consisting of g-C3N4 and ZnO, indicative of a strong electronic coupling due to the migration of population from g-C3N4 to ZnO.

The red line represents the UV-Vis absorption profile for pure ZnO NRs.

Steady state and time resolved photoluminescence analyses
Excited state charge transfers and recombination processes in the photoactive electrode materials are monitored by steady-state and dynamic photo-luminescent studies. Fig. 7(A) shows the steady state PL spectra for pure g-C3N4 (black line) and its composites with ZnO NR varying g-C3N4 to ZnO NR weight ratios, namely; 0.25:1 (dark red line), 0.5:1 (blue line), 1:1 (magenta line), 1.5:1 (olive line), and 2:1 (violet line), recorded at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm corresponding to g-C3N4. The as-synthesized pure g-C3N4 sheets exhibit a strong PL emission peak at around 432 nm due to the radiative annihilation of excitons or photogenerated (e−–h+) pairs.14 A normalized PL spectra shows a gradual static quenching of PL intensity for the composites with decreasing g-C3N4 to ZnO NR weight ratios, signifying an inhibited recombination of (e−–h+) pairs, possibly due to photogenerated charge transfer at the heterojunctions of the g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NRs.34,35,49 This observation is evocative of photogenerated charge injection from the CB edge of g-C3N4 sheets (−3.62 eV) to the more positive CB offset of ZnO NRs (−4.24 eV) as shown in the inset to Fig. 7(A). Consequently, photogenerated charges would be primarily localized at the ZnO NRs in the composites during the excitation process which is divulged by the monotonous blue shift of emission peaks (∼20 nm) observed for all the composites. However, the normalized PL intensity for the composite ratio (2:1) is observed to be comparable with pure g-C3N4, which is due to the presence of an excess amount of g-C3N4 relative to the ZnO NRs.

(B) Dynamic PL spectra for pure g-C3N4 (black spectrum), (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites with weight ratios 0.25:1 (dark red spectrum) and 0.5:1 (blue spectrum). Inset shows the variation of average life time (〈τ〉) for all the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites. 
To further gain insights into the synergistic effects between g-C3N4 and ZnO NRs and charge transport kinetics in the composites, we have performed dynamic PL spectroscopy for the pristine materials and their composites as shown in Fig. 6(B), measured at the emission peak with an excitation wavelength 350 nm. Fig. S3 (see ESI†) shows all the decay curves recorded for the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites. PL decay traces are fitted with a tri-exponential function using fast software provided by Edinburgh instruments to calculate the exciton lifetime values. Observed multi-exponential decay patterns for all the materials infer that multiple processes are involved during the decay of emissive excitons or the radiative transitions. The values of fitting parameter (χ2) and detailed spectroscopic results such as, exciton lifetimes (τ1, τ2, τ3), pre-exponential factors (α1, α2, α3), average exciton lifetimes (〈τ〉) etc. are summarized in the Table S1 (see ESI†).
The average lifetime values are derived from eqn (1).50 (1)
The inset in Fig. 7(B) shows the variation of average exciton life time (〈τ〉) for all the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites. Exciton lifetimes are observed to be faster in all the composites as compared to pure g-C3N4 which confirms the role of ZnO NRs in the decay process of excitons. However, a substantial decrease in exciton lifetimes for the composites, namely; 0.25:1 (dark red spectrum) and 0.5:1 (blue spectrum), are noted, as evident from Fig. 7(B). Calculated 〈τ〉 values are found to be ∼5.1 ns (for 0.25:1) and ∼5.3 ns (for 0.5:1) which are significantly lower than the average lifetimes estimated for their counterparts 8.5 ns (for 1:1), 8.3 ns (for 1.5:1), and 8.6 ns (for 2:1) as well as for pure g-C3N4 (〈τ〉 ≈ 14.4 ns). This observation confirms strong excited state electronic interactions between g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NRs in the both the composites. The faster exciton life times observed for the composites are also symptomatic of photogenerated electron injection from g-C3N4 to the lower CB offset of ZnO NR. Considering photoexcited electron transfer is the only pathway for deactivation of excited g-C3N4, the rate constants of electron injection (kei) from g-C3N4 to ZnO NRs is calculated from eqn (2) and listed in Table 1:50 (2)

From Table 1, the kei values for the composites (0.25:1) and (0.5:1) are found to be 1.26 × 108 s−1 and 1.18 × 108 s−1, which are significantly higher than the other composites. Faster charge injection dynamics in both the composites confirm an efficient charge transfer and optimum g-C3N4 to ZnO NR ratio. As the g-C3N4 to ZnO NR weight ratio increases from (1:1) to (2:1), the amount of bare or unbound g-C3N4 sheets in the composites increases which are incapable of photogenerated charge transfer to the ZnO NRs. Consequently, the number of excitons undergoing radiative decay are higher in the composites, namely, (1:1), (1.5:1), and (2:1); which is reflected in slower charge injection dynamics from g-C3N4 to ZnO NR. Therefore, photogenerated charge transfer is believed to be facilitated by probable attraction forces between polar wurtzite ZnO NRs40 and delocalized π-electrons as well as non-bonding electrons in the g-C3N4 sheets. For further confirmation of electronic interaction between ZnO NRs and g-C3N4 sheets we have performed Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses for the composites and this is discussed in the ESI (Fig. S6, see ESI†).
In addition, we have found that electronic interaction between g-C3N4 and ZnO NR is stronger in the composites than their counterpart ZnO NP composites. A comparative PL analyses for both the g-C3N4 composites of ZnO [weight ratio (0.5:1)] is performed and discussed in the ESI (Fig. S7, see ESI†).
Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis absorption spectra of the photoanodes

Fig. 8 shows normalized UV-Vis absorption profiles for all the CdS QD sensitized photoanodes fabricated with pristine ZnO NR (red line) and (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites namely; 0.25:1 (dark red line), 0.5:1 (blue line), 1:1 (magenta line), 1.5:1 (olive line) and 2:1 (violet line). The absorption profiles were recorded against blank FTO as a reference and the scan range is 200–800 nm for all the samples. The absorption range for all the photoanodes are observed to be in the visible region (380–520 nm), which infer a successful anchoring of CdS QDs onto the pristine ZnO NR as well as (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite scaffolds. Moreover, with increasing g-C3N4 to ZnO NR weight ratio in the photoanodes, we have noted a gradual red shift of absorption onsets (indicated with a black arrow) in the absorption profiles. The observed red shift is due to the subsequent growth of CdS QDs in the photoanodes with increased deposition cycles.51 Note that we have carried out five SILAR cycles for sensitization of all the photoanodes with CdS QDs in order to have a match with the fabrication process. A steady increase in absorbance for the photoanodes with composite ratios, (0.25:1), (0.5:1), and (1:1) as compared to the pristine ZnO NR photoanode is attributed to the increased deposition amount of CdS QDs in the presence of g-C3N4 sheets. However, the absorbance of the photoanode with the composite ratio (1.5:1) is comparable to the photoanode (0.5:1), but less than the photoanode (1:1), possibly due to the inhibited deposition caused by the higher content of sheet-like g-C3N4 in the (1.5:1) photoanode. The presence of excess g-C3N4 sheets in the photoanode offer more adsorption sites for the loading of CdS QDs onto their surfaces and with repeated deposition cycles the QDs tend to form bigger agglomerates which is not so in the case of the other aforementioned photoanodes. These bigger CdS agglomerates might have clogged the pores in the photoanodic film to inhibit further penetration of precursor ions (i.e., Cd2+ and S2−) which would impede the smooth and uniform deposition of CdS QDs. This conclusion is in accordance with the comparable absorbance observed for the photoanodes (2:1) and (1:1). Hence, the effective surface area for CdS QD deposition in the photoanodes is increased only up to an optimum weight ratio of (1:1); i.e., g-C3N4 relative to ZnO NRs.

Photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells
To understand the effects of g-C3N4 in terms of the light harvesting ability of the as prepared (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites, photovoltaic devices sensitized with CdS QDs were fabricated and we systematically analysed the performance parameters. Fig. 9(A) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for all the CdS QD sensitized (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite and pristine ZnO NR devices. The performance parameters for all the photovoltaic devices such as, short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) are summarized in Table 2.

From Table 2, it is clear that the PCE values for all the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices are superior to that of the pristine ZnO NR [device (a), η ≈ 0.65%], which confirms the beneficial role of g-C3N4 sheets in enhancing the light harvesting ability of the devices. The photovoltaic parameters, i.e., Jsc, Voc and FF values are found to be ∼5.4 mA cm−2, ∼410 mV and ∼29% respectively for the device (a). Upon introduction of g-C3N4, as we can see in case of device (b) with (0.25:1) composite ratio, the performance parameters are increased to Jsc ≈ 7.1 mA cm−2, Voc ≈ 500 mV, and FF ≈ 36%. The increase in Jsc is might be due to the higher loading of sensitizer particles (CdS QDs) in the (0.25:1) photoanode as compared to the pristine ZnO NR photoanode. The improved Voc and FF are symptomatic of a minimum recombination of photogenerated charge and faster regeneration kinetics of oxidized CdS QDs respectively.52 The faster regeneration kinetics of the sensitizer particles implies a better functioning of the redox couple facilitated by a maximum pore availability in the photoanodic film. The minimum content of g-C3N4 sheets in the photoanodic film of device (c) is the most probable reason for the maximum pore availability after sensitization. As the g-C3N4 content increases in the photoanodes, CdS QDs tend to agglomerate and clog the available pores in the mesoscopic films during the sensitization process, as we have discussed in the diffuse reflectance UV-Vis analyses. Lower estimated values of FF for the devices with a higher content of g-C3N4, i.e., ∼34% [for device (c)], ∼31% [for device (d)], 29% [for device (e)] and ∼30 [for device (f)] are also in accordance with our explanation. Nevertheless, optimum PCE (η ≈ 2.43%) is exhibited by the device (c) with composite ratio (0.5:1), which is due to higher Jsc ≈ 11.1 mA cm−2, and Voc ≈ 650 mV recorded for the device. The enhanced Jsc value is in agreement with the higher loading of CdS QDs in the photoanode as well as better electronic interaction between g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NR in the (0.5:1) composite, which might have increased the flux of photoinduced electron injection. However, a further increase in CdS QD loading in the photoanodes of devices (d), (e), and (f), is not observed to be beneficial in the improvement of photovoltaic parameters. The current density values of device (d) with a composition of (1:1) of g-C3N4 to ZnO, exhibited low values ∼7.8 mA cm−2 [for (d)] and the trend continued for the devices (e) Jsc ≈ 6.3 mA cm−2 and (f) Jsc ≈ 6.0 mA cm−2, which infers a higher recombination rate of photoinduced electrons due to agglomeration of sensitizer particles, i.e., CdS in the photoanodes. Moreover, the decrease in Voc values observed for the respective devices of ∼625 mV [for (d)], ∼461 mV [for (e)], and ∼452 mV [for (f)] also supports our claim of a higher recombination rate in the devices. It is noteworthy that Voc of the highest performing device [i.e., device (c) with (0.5:1) composite ratio] is increased significantly up to ∼650 mV which is about a 60% improvement over the pristine ZnO NR device (Voc ≈ 410 mV). This is a clear indication of inhibited photoinduced electron interception to the redox couple (S2−/Sn2−) in the presence of g-C3N4 sheets.53 To probe the minimum reverse tunneling probability of photoinduced electrons in the devices with (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites we have performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses and this will be discussed later. In the present work, the low FF values observed for the devices may be due to the slower intrinsic hole recovery rate of the sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sn2−) redox couple and poor diffusion of electrolyte at the photoanode.54,55 This inference is also in accordance with the increase in FF values observed for the devices having porous g-C3N4 sheets, i.e., device (b) with g-C3N4 to ZnO weight ratio (0.25:1) [FF ∼36%] and device (c) with weight ratio (0.5:1) [FF ∼34%] in contrast to the pristine ZnO NR device [FF ∼ 29%]. This observation is primarily due to the porous g-C3N4 assisted acceleration of electrolyte diffusion at the photoanodes. However, the choice of polysulfide electrolyte is justified, as it is reported to be more suitable for stabilization of the CdS QDs.56

Fig. 9(B) illustrates the corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plots for all the as fabricated photovoltaic devices. The better light harvesting ability of the device with the composite ratio (0.5:1) [i.e., device (c)], is attributed to the optimum loading of g-C3N4 sheets and CdS QDs, which resulted in a reduced recombination rate of photoinduced electrons. In Fig. 9(B) the composition of (0.5:1) exhibits an IPCE of ∼55% in the wavelength range of 380 nm to 520 nm. The IPCE plots are observed to follow the similar increasing trend of Jsc values as in the case of the (J–V) curves of the devices [i.e., (a) < (f) < (e) < (b) < (d) < (c)]. A minimum IPCE (∼22%) for device (a) with pristine ZnO NR is symptomatic of a higher recombination rate in the device apart from lower CdS QD loading as compared to the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices. Hence, the photovoltaic boosting ability of g-C3N4 is confirmed by the enhanced light harvesting by the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices in contrast to the pristine ZnO NR device.
To monitor electron transport and charge recombination kinetics in the photovoltaic devices we have performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10(A) shows the Nyquist plots recorded under dark conditions in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at the applied bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltages. All the Nyquist plots are comprised of two semicircles, one in the medium frequency region and another one in the higher frequency region. The semicircle in the medium frequency region encompasses the charge-transfer process at the working electrode/electrolyte interface, while the smaller semicircle in the higher frequency region is attributed to the counter electrode/electrolyte interfacial redox reactions.57 The diameter of the right semicircle (Rk) is primarily contributed to from electron recombination resistance and is partly due to the transport resistance.58 From Fig. 10(A), we can see that Rk is significantly higher in the case of the best performing device (c) [i.e., with (0.5:1) composite ratio (blue line)] in contrast to the pristine ZnO NR device (a). This observation confirms our claim of retarded backward redox reactions or inhibited recombination at the ZnO NR/electrolyte or ZnO NR/CdS/electrolyte interfaces in the device (c) with optimum loading of g-C3N4. The increasing trend of Rk for the devices is: (a) < (f) < (e) < (b) < (d) < (c) which is the similar order observed for the increase of Voc values. Therefore it can be concluded that enhanced Voc values in the devices with (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites are mainly due to the minimized reverse tunneling probability of photoinduced electrons in the presence of g-C3N4 sheets.

Higher (τe) values furnished by the devices with (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites are a result of inhibited electron interception to the redox shuttle (S2−/Sn2−) at the working electrode/electrolyte interfaces, i.e., ZnO/electrolyte and ZnO/CdS/electrolyte interfaces. Appropriate band edge alignments of g-C3N4 to that of CdS QDs and ZnO NRs for favorable charge transfer process is the most probable reason for the minimum recombination rate in the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices. Energy level alignments of the CdS QD sensitized (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite devices showing charge transfer pathways are depicted in Scheme 4. From Scheme 4, we can see that the CB position of g-C3N4 (−3.62 eV) is more negative than that of CdS (−4.05 eV) and ZnO NR (−4.24 eV). Hence, the back transfer of photoinduced electrons from ZnO NR to the CdS QDs and g-C3N4 is an energetically unlikely process. Moreover, due to the higher band gap of g-C3N4 sheets as compared to CdS QDs, they are acting as a barrier for electron interception at the ZnO/electrolyte and ZnO/CdS/electrolyte interfaces which is not the case in the pristine ZnO NR based device (a). We have shown the impeded electron recombination pathways with red crossed black dotted lines in Scheme 4. It is noteworthy that sensitization of CdS QDs in the photoanodes leads to the probability of deposition on both the scaffolds, i.e., g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NRs; therefore, two pathways for charge transfer processes are possible in the devices. The charge transfer pathway (1) represents the condition when CdS QDs are primarily adsorbed on the g-C3N4 sheets while pathway (2) signifies preferential adsorption of CdS QDs on the exposed surface of ZnO NRs. As the g-C3N4 to ZnO weight ratio increases in the composite, the CdS QDs are adsorbed mainly on the g-C3N4 sheets due to the lack of exposed ZnO surface. Consequently, probability of charge transfer according to pathway (1) is increased in this situation, wherein electron injection from CdS to ZnO is hindered by the g-C3N4 sheets resulting in a decrease in the photoinduced electron density in the photoanode. Lower values of (τe) as well as PCE (η) for the (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composites with a high content of g-C3N4, i.e., [(1:1), device (d)], [(1.5:1), device (e)] and [(2:1), device (f)] are reflective of the impeded photoinduced electron injection from CdS QDs to ZnO. However, the tunneling possibility of far less photoinduced electrons from CdS QDs to ZnO across the g-C3N4 barrier cannot be nullified; as the CB level of CdS QDs is energetically well above the CB offset of ZnO. It is believed that, at the optimum g-C3N4 to ZnO weight ratio, i.e., [(0.5:1), device (c)], the charge transfer pathway (2) surpasses its counterpart pathway (1) and hence increases the photoinduced electron density in the photoanode. The maximum electron lifetime (∼43 ms) observed for the device (c) is indicative of increased photoinduced electron density which eventually leads to higher values of Voc ≈ 650 mV, Jsc ≈ 11.1 mA cm−2 and η ≈ 2.43%.

Morphology dependent photovoltaic properties of ZnO are evaluated by performing a comparative photovoltaic study between the highest performing (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite device and a similar device fabricated with the g-C3N4 composite of ZnO NP. For better clarity, we have also compared the performance parameters of pristine ZnO NR and ZnO NP devices. Fig. 11(A) illustrates the characteristic (J–V) curves for the optimized (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite device [device (a)], the similar device fabricated from (g-C3N4–ZnO NP) composite [device (b)], along with the pristine ZnO NR [device (c)] and ZnO NP [device (d)] devices. Fig. 11(B) shows the IPCE plots for the respective devices. From Figs. 11(A) and (B), we can observe the better light harvesting ability of the ZnO NR based devices over the ZnO NP. Table 4 summarizes all the recorded and calculated performance parameters for the compared devices in Fig. 11.

From Table 4, we have seen that Jsc (∼9.02 mA cm−2) and Voc (∼575 mV) values for the device (b) with (g-C3N4–ZnO NP) composite are lower than the optimized device (a); (Jsc ≈ 11.1 mA cm−2 and Voc ≈ 650 mV). Interestingly, similar inferior performance is also observed in the case of the pristine ZnO NP based device (Jsc ≈ 4.83 mA cm−2 and Voc ≈ 400 mV) as compared to the pristine ZnO NR device (Jsc ≈ 5.44 mA cm−2 and Voc ≈ 410 mV). The higher Jsc values recorded for the ZnO NR based devices may be due to stronger synergistic effects between g-C3N4 and ZnO NR, the minimum population of grain boundary induced trap sites and the longer diffusion length of photoinduced electrons as depicted in the inset of Fig. 11(B). The minimum distribution of grain boundaries is expected in ZnO NR based photoanodes due to the larger size of the as synthesized single crystalline ZnO NRs (∼500 nm) than the ZnO NPs [∼70 nm]. It is well known that grain boundaries minimize the diffusion length of photoinduced electrons in QDSSCs and facilitate recombination processes. In addition, a steady state PL analysis for pristine ZnO NR and ZnO NP reveals that the density of oxygen defect sites in ZnO NP is higher than ZnO NR which is also in favour of better charge transportation in ZnO NR (Fig. S8, see ESI†). To compare the sensitizer particle loading in the photoanodes, we have performed diffuse reflectance UV-Vis analysis for all the CdS QD sensitized ZnO NP and ZnO NR based photoanodes (Fig. S9, see ESI†). Quantitatively, CdS QDs have a greater loading in the ZnO NP based photoanodes due to the higher specific surface area provided by the ZnO NPs (Fig. S10, see ESI†). Therefore, the flux of electron injection by the CdS QDs is more in case of the ZnO NP based devices. Despite this, lower values of Jsc, Voc, as well as IPCE are observed for the ZnO NP based devices which supports our claim of maximum recombination in the respective devices. From Table 4, it is noteworthy that the FF values of the ZnO NP based devices, namely devices (b) and (d), are lower than those of the ZnO NR based devices [i.e., (a) and (c)]. This observation suggests the slower regeneration kinetics of CdS QDs in the devices (b) and (d). The higher loading of CdS QDs in the ZnO NP photoanodes might have clogged the pores and obstructed the diffusion of electrolyte, causing an inefficient regeneration of sensitizer particles.
Recombination processes and charge transfer kinetics in the ZnO NP based devices are further monitored in the EIS analyses. Figs. 12(A) and (B) show the Nyquist and Bode phase plots for the devices, namely: (a) optimized (g-C3N4–ZnO NR) composite device, (b) similar device fabricated with (g-C3N4–ZnO NP) composite, pristine (c) ZnO NR and (d) ZnO NP devices.

(B) Bode phase plots for all the respective devices. 
From Fig. 12(A), we can observe smaller semicircles with lesser Rk values in the medium frequency region for the ZnO NP based devices (b) and (d), in contrast to the ZnO NR devices (a) and (c). Higher electron interception to the redox shuttle (i.e., S2−/Sn2−) in the case of the ZnO NP based devices is confirmed from this observation as we have discussed in the performance parameter analysis part of this paper. Furthermore, our claim is validated by the larger fmax values exhibited by the devices (b) [9.5 Hz] and (d) [14.4 Hz] which in turn yield lower values of τe relative to the devices (a) and (c). The corresponding τe values for the device (b) is found to be 16.8 ms while for device (d) it is 11.1 ms. The smaller τe values for the ZnO NP based devices infer minimum photoinduced electron density due to shorter diffusion length of electrons which are reflected in the poor values of the performance parameters, i.e., Voc, Jsc, and overall power conversion efficiencies. In essence, the stronger electronic interaction between g-C3N4 and ZnO NR, longer diffusion length, and minimum recombination rate of electrons in ZnO NRs have contributed to the higher light harvesting ability of the devices, which is not so in the case of ZnO NPs.
Conclusions
In summary, a facile approach for an enhanced charge injection and separation in ZnO based CdS QD sensitized solar cell devices is demonstrated by introducing a low cost and easily available organic semiconductor g-C3N4. It is found that g-C3N4 sheets act as a barrier for reverse tunneling of photoinduced electrons at the interface of the working electrode/electrolyte, and boosts the photovoltaic efficacy. Synergistic effects between g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NR in the composites with varied g-C3N4 to ZnO NR weight ratios [i.e., (0.25:1), (0.5:1), (1:1), (1.5:1) and (2:1)] have been investigated. Stronger excited state electronic interactions are noted in the case of optimized weight ratios; (0.25:1) and (0.5:1), which have confirmed photoinduced electron injection from the CB edge of g-C3N4 to the low-lying CB offset of ZnO NR. Photovoltaic characterizations of the materials have revealed that the light harnessing capability of the device with the composite ratio (0.5:1) is optimum in contrast to all other devices. The reduced probability of photoinduced electron interception, the optimum loading of sensitizer particles as well as g-C3N4, and the stronger electronic interactions between g-C3N4 sheets and ZnO NR, are the key factors for the observed enhancement of photovoltaic parameters in the (0.5:1) composite device. In addition, similar devices fabricated with ZnO NPs have exhibited lower light harvesting abilities. The higher rate of electron interception at the working electrode/electrolyte interfaces owing to the shorter diffusion length of electrons in ZnO NPs, and the weaker excited state electronic interactions between g-C3N4 and ZnO NP, are concluded as the primary reasons for the lower performance in contrast to the ZnO NR devices.
