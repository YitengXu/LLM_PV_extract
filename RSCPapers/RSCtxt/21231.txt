Herein, we report the fabrication of tubular-structured orthorhombic CoSe2 (o-CoSe2) and cubic CoSe2 (c-CoSe2) by calcining monoclinic Co3Se4 nanotubes (Co3Se4 NTs) prepared by a facile precursor transformation method. Benefiting from advantageous structural features, including functional shells and well-defined interior voids, the tubular-structured o-CoSe2 showed a high power conversion efficiency of 9.34% as a counter electrode catalyst for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), superior to that of a Pt counter electrode (8.15%), under AM 1.5 G irradiation. In addition, the o-CoSe2 nanotubes also demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity in terms of low onset overpotential (∼54 mV) and small Tafel slope (∼65.9 mV per decade) as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst in alkaline medium. Hence, this work provides a promising strategy to selectively design and synthesize highly active electrocatalysts for energy conversion.
Introduction
In the wake of growing global energy demand and environmental degradation, it is increasingly necessary to develop clean and renewable energy sources based on sustainable electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies.1–4 Among various energy conversion technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and water electrolysis have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable merits, such as low cost, high efficiency, and environmentally friendly characteristics, which are highly dependent on the catalytic properties of the electrode materials.5–10 Traditionally, Pt-based electrode materials have performed well in catalytic processes for both DSSC and water electrolysis; however, the problems of high cost and low reserves restrict the applications of these materials on a large scale.11–14 Therefore, developing highly efficient and promising substitutes based on Earth-abundant elements to replace Pt-based catalysts for both DSSC and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great importance and desirability.
In the past few years, driven by their superior magnetic, electrical, optical and catalytic properties, transition metal chalcogenides (TMC) have been regarded as promising precious metal substitutes for various applications.15–19 Among these, cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) is known for its two main crystal structures, including orthorhombic marcasite-type (denoted as o-CoSe2) and cubic pyrite-type (denoted as c-CoSe2); these have been widely investigated in the fields of DSSCs and HER owing to their fascinating characteristics.20–24 Usually, o-CoSe2 is fabricated at low temperature and is further converted to c-CoSe2 with increasing transition temperature.25 This phase transformation in CoSe2 give rise to interesting changes to a series of chemical and physical characteristics; therefore, it could be used to tune these characteristics without changing the chemical composition of the material. In view of the outstanding electrocatalytic properties of CoSe2 when used as the counter electrode (CE) for DSSCs, CoSe2 is an effective material for catalyzing the reduction of triiodide; thus, it is a potential low cost substitute for Pt CE.20,21 Moreover, CoSe2 also exhibits high efficiency as an HER catalyst in acidic conditions because of its excellent catalytic activity and good chemical stability.26–28 For example, the orthorhombic CoSe2 nanorods synthesized by Dong et al. through a hydrothermal method produced a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.38%, which is superior to that of a Pt CE (7.83%).21 In addition, Zhang et al. reported polymorphic CoSe2 (p-CoSe2) with mixed orthorhombic and cubic phases as a highly active electrocatalyst for HER in acidic solution.25 However, despite the fact that great progress in DSSCs and acidic HER has been achieved, no report of the two different phases of CoSe2 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst has yet demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity comparable to that of Pt-based catalysts for both DSSC and HER in alkaline medium. Moreover, the growth mechanisms of the two different phases of CoSe2 have seldom been discussed in detail.
In addition to the change in crystal structure, the catalytic performance of an electrode material also deeply depends on its unique morphology.29 To date, numerous efforts have been devoted to designing and preparing highly efficient electrocatalysts with diverse, well-defined hollow structures.30,31 Due to their advantageous structural features, such as high surface-to-volume ratio, large surface area and low density, these hollow structures have been the subject of extensive research interest for supercapacitors,32 water electrolysis,33,34 DSSCs35,36 and lithium-ion batteries.37 Particularly, one dimensional (1D) hollow tubular structures, possessing functional shells and well-defined interior voids, are considered to be promising hollow structures. For example, Lou and co-workers reported the design and synthesis of uniform 1D MxCo3−xS4 (M = Ni, Mn, Zn) hollow tubular structures using soft polymeric nanofibers as a template; these structures exhibited exceptional electrochemical performance for hybrid supercapacitors.38 However, it is still a sizeable challenge to develop an effective approach for the fabrication of metal selenides with hollow tubular structures, although many efforts have been made. Significantly, tubular structures with massive nanoscale-sized pores can shorten diffusion pathways and improve the total surface area exposed to the electrolyte, thus endowing the structures with high power conversion efficiency for DSSCs.39,40 With respect to HER, porous tubular structures embedded with numerous tiny nanostructures can provide large surface areas and rich electroactive sites for electrochemical reactions and thereby enhance the catalytic activity of the structures for HER.41 Due to these unique structural merits, various tubular-structured functional materials have been widely researched to further improve their performance in different applications; these include Co9S8,40,42 Mo2C,41 CoS1.097,43 Co0.85Se44 and WS2(1−x)Se2x.45 To the extent of our knowledge, the fabrication of hollow tubular-structured CoSe2 and Co3Se4 has not been reported by other research groups. Therefore, it is highly desirable to fabricate tubular-structured CoSe2/Co3Se4 and study their applications in DSSCs, especially in alkaline-medium HER.
Herein, we report the synthesis of o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 tubular structures by calcining monoclinic Co3Se4 nanotubes (denoted as Co3Se4 NTs) fabricated by a facile precursor transformation method. First, the monoclinic Co3Se4 NTs were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanorods (denoted as Co precursors) in selenide solution. The as-obtained Co3Se4 NTs were then converted to o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 tubular structures after being calcined at different temperatures in Ar atmosphere. In the synthetic process, it was found that the crystal structure and surface morphology of CoSe2 can be adjusted by the calcination temperature. As expected, benefiting from their unique structural merits, the o-CoSe2 nanotubes showed higher catalytic activity for DSSCs and HER in alkaline medium in comparison with c-CoSe2 NTs, Co3Se4 NTs and Co3Se4 nanoparticles (denoted as Co3Se4 NPs). When used as the counter electrode in DSSCs, the o-CoSe2 nanotubes exhibited an impressive PCE of 9.34%, superior to that of a Pt CE (8.15%). In addition, the o-CoSe2 nanotubes also delivered exceptional efficiency as an HER catalyst with an onset overpotential of ∼54 mV and a Tafel slope of ∼65.9 mV per decade in 1.0 M KOH solution.

The deionized water used throughout all the experiments was purified using a Millipore system. The N719 dye was obtained from Solarinox Ltd. (Switzerland). The sheet resistance of the FTO glass purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass (Japan) was 15 Ω sq.−1. The used FTO glasses were cut into small plates (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) before ultrasonic cleaning (using cleaner, acetone and alcohol).

In a typical procedure, 1.2 g of CoCl2·6H2O and 0.30 g of urea were firstly dissolved in 60 mL deionized water, and the solution was stirred intensely for 15 min. Then, the above solution was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 100 mL and heated at 140 °C in an air oven for 10 h. After cooling naturally to ambient temperature, the pink precipitates were centrifuged and washed respectively with distilled water and ethanol three times.

In a typical procedure, 0.10 g of the Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanorods and 0.30 g of Na2SeO3 were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. After that, 10 mL of N2H4·H2O (80%) was added to the solution, and the solution was stirred for 15 min. Then, the above solution was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 100 mL and heated at 180 °C in an air oven for 8 h. After cooling naturally to ambient temperature, the black precipitates were centrifuged and washed respectively with distilled water and ethanol three times. Finally, after being dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h, 0.098 g of Co3Se4 NTs was obtained (yield: 82%).
Synthesis of Co3Se4 nanoparticles
The Co3Se4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method without adding urea. Typically, 0.10 g of CoCl2·6H2O and 0.30 g of Na2SeO3 were dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water. After that, 10 mL of N2H4·H2O (80%) was added to the solution, and the solution was stirred for 15 min. Then, the above solution was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 100 mL and heated at 180 °C in an air oven for 10 h. After cooling naturally to ambient temperature, the black precipitates were centrifuged and washed respectively with distilled water and ethanol three times. Finally, after being dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h, 0.058 g of Co3Se4 NPs was obtained (yield: 84%).
Synthesis of orthorhombic CoSe2 nanotubes
Typically, 0.10 g of the as-synthesized Co3Se4 NTs was transferred into a porcelain boat and placed in the centre of a tube furnace; the NTs were then heated to 300 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 2 h in Ar atmosphere. After the furnace was cooled to ambient temperature, 0.088 g of orthorhombic CoSe2 was collected (yield: 88%).
Synthesis of cubic CoSe2 nanotubes
Typically, 0.10 g of the as-synthesized Co3Se4 NTs was transferred into a porcelain boat and placed in the centre of a tube furnace; the NTs were then heated to 600 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and maintained for 2 h in Ar atmosphere. After the furnace was cooled to ambient temperature, 0.083 g of the cubic CoSe2 sample was collected (yield: 83%).
Electrode preparation

(1) Dye-sensitized solar cells. 
The counter electrodes were prepared on FTO glass substrates (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) by a spin-casting technique. To directly compare the catalytic activity of the as-obtained samples, the loading amount and thickness of the CE films should be approximately controlled. Briefly, 0.1 g of the as-obtained samples were dispersed in 10 mL of ethyl alcohol (0.01 g mL−1) and sonicated for 30 min to form a homogenous ink suspension. Then, 50 μL of suspension was coated on a FTO glass substrate by spin-casting at 500 rpm for 12 s and subsequently heated at 150 °C for 15 min to remove ethanol. Finally, the resulting CE films were obtained after the second layer was coated using the same processes. The loading mass for each sample was approximately 0.45 mg cm−2 on a FTO glass substrate. In addition, as a reference, Pt CE was prepared by spin-casting 20 mM chloroplatinic acid (isopropanol solution) on the FTO glass and then annealing at 450 °C for 30 min in air.


(2) Hydrogen evolution reaction. 
Typically, 2 mg of catalyst and 40 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) were dispensed in 460 μL of water/ethanol (v/v = 4:1) and then sonicated for 30 min to form a homogenous ink solution. Subsequently, 5 μL of ink catalyst was dropped onto a glass carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) and dried at room temperature. The loading mass of the catalyst was about 0.283 mg cm−2. In addition, commercial 20% Pt/C was used as a reference in HER.

Fabrication of DSSCs
TiO2 photoanodes containing a transparent nanocrystalline layer (∼12 μm) and a scattering layer (∼4 μm) were prepared by the screen-printing method described in our previous work.46,47 The resulting TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 dye ethanol solution and sensitized at room temperature for 12 h. Then, the N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the CE were spaced with a thermoplastic Surlyn film (50 μm) and sealed via hot-pressing. The redox electrolyte was an acetonitrile solution consisting of 0.3 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine; the electrolyte was injected into the interspace between the CE and the TiO2 photoanode. Finally, a DSSC with a geometric active area of 0.16 cm2 was obtained.
Characterization and electrochemical methods
The crystal structures of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, Cu Kα, λ = 0.1542 nm). Raman spectra of the samples were acquired on a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, inVia Reflex) with a 532 nm excitation laser. The surface morphologies of the samples were measured with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, TECNAI G2F20, FEI) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). The valence states of c-CoSe2, o-CoSe2 and Co3Se4 were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis (ESCALAB 250, Mg Ka, USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TG 209 F3, NETZSCH) was performed under a N2 atmosphere from ambient temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The surface area of the samples was examined with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020M, USA).
All electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation.

(1) Dye-sensitized solar cells. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs were measured with a standard solar simulator (XM-500W, Trustech) under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (91150V, Newport Corporation). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a three-electrode electrochemical system (soaked in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution consisting of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 100 mM LiClO4) and conducted over the scanning potential range from −0.5 V to 0.9 V at different scanning rates. The resulting CE, a Pt sheet and an Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Tafel polarization curves were conducted on symmetrical dummy cells with a sandwich-like structure (CE/electrolyte/CE). The frequency range, bias voltage and AC amplitude of the EIS measurements were 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, 0 V and 10 mV, respectively. In addition, the Tafel curve tests were performed in the voltage range of −1.0 to 1.0 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. A black mask was applied on the surface of the DSSCs to avoid stray light, and all solar cell tests were performed at room temperature.


(2) Hydrogen evolution reaction. 
The HER activity was evaluated in a three-electrode electrochemical system using a graphite plate as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, a glass carbon electrode (GCE, 3 mm in diameter) as the working electrode and 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. All the potentials were referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + (0.059pH + 0.205)V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), corrected using iR compensation, was conducted in the potential range from −1.8 V to −0.8 V (vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The EIS measurements were performed at an overpotential of 150 mV with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The long-term stability tests were performed using continuous CV sweeps with a potential range from −0.4 V to −0.1 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was determined using cyclic voltammetry in a non-faradaic region from 0.1 to 0.2 V vs. RHE at different scan rates ranging from 10 to 120 mV s−1. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was estimated by plotting j = janodic − jcathodic at 0.15 V vs. RHE against the scan rate. The linear slope is twice the double-layer capacitance (Cdl).48,49 The amount of hydrogen produced during electrochemical water splitting was measured via an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu).

Results and discussion
The synthetic process of the c-CoSe2 and o-CoSe2 nanotubes is shown in Fig. 1. In the first step, CoCl2·6H2O was reacted with urea in deionized water at 140 °C for 10 h to produce Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanorods. In detail, in the initial stage of the reaction, urea was hydrolyzed in the aqueous solution to yield OH− and CO32−; also, CoCl2·6H2O provided Co2+ and Cl−. Then, OH−, CO32− and Cl− reacted with Co2+ to form a large number of random nuclei at low temperature. As the reaction temperature and time increased, the high concentration of nuclei was beneficial for accelerating the velocity of nucleation and boosting the growth of crystals. Subsequently, numerous tiny Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O crystals aggregated to nanorods. The reaction route in the hydrothermal process can be expressed as follows:50 CO(NH2)2 + H2O → CO2 + 2NH3(1) CO2 + H2O → CO32− + 2H+(2) NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−(3) Co2+ + 0.20Cl− + 0.35CO32− + 1.10OH− + 1.74H2O → Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O(4)
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the preparation of the o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 nanotubes. 
In the next step, the as-prepared Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanorods acted as a sacrificial template to fabricate Co3Se4 nanotubes through a hydrothermal process in Na2SeO3 solution. The formation mechanism of the hollow structures can be explained by the Kirkendall effect.51,52 First, water-soluble Na2SeO3 was used as the Se source; this can quickly be reduced to Se by hydrazine hydrate, and the newly produced Se is further transformed to Se2−. In this system, much elemental Se is still present due to the excess added Na2SeO3 and the relatively low pH value in alkaline solution; as a result, not all of the Se was transformed to Se2−.53 Subsequently, Se2− ions reacted with the Co2+ on the surface of the Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O nanorods to form a thin layer of Co3Se4. The thin layers, which are composed of plentiful nanocrystallites with many grain boundaries, not only enable the diffusion of materials through the Co3Se4 layer but also promote further reaction between Se2− and Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O. According to the Kirkendall effect, where the different diffusivities of atoms in a diffusion couple may give rise to the formation of “Kirkendall voids” close to the interface, the formation of the hollow Co3Se4 tubular structures in our case can be ascribed to the fact that the outward diffusion of cobalt ions from the core is faster than the inward diffusion of Se2− from the shell phase through the produced Co3Se4 layer.42 The corresponding reaction process can be expressed as follows: SeO32− + N2H4·H2O → Se + N2 + 2OH− + 2H2O(5) 3Se + 6OH− → 2Se2− + SeO32− + 3H2O(6) Se + 3Se2− + 3Co2+ → Co3Se4(7)
Finally, the o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 samples were synthesized by a chemical transformation method from monoclinic Co3Se4 at different calcination temperatures. A possible growth mechanism for o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 is proposed below. At a lower temperature of 300 °C, the monoclinic Co3Se4 was transformed to o-CoSe2 with well-defined hollow interiors, likely due to the different diffusion rates of cobalt and selenium.37 When the temperature increased to 600 °C, the resulting o-CoSe2 was further converted to c-CoSe2 through a phase transformation process. In this process, the tubular-structured o-CoSe2 was recrystallized, and a small amount of Se element in the c-CoSe2 sample was gradually evaporated after being heated to a certain temperature; at the same time, the increase of the calcination temperature also resulted in crystal growth and agglomeration of the primary particles in the shells of the nanotubes, realizing the formation of the necklace-like structure of c-CoSe2. In reality, o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 possess structural similarity and a small lattice mismatch, leading to facile epitaxial growth between them.54,55 In addition, TGA was performed under N2 atmosphere to understand the decomposition process and relevant phase transitions in cobalt selenide (Fig. S1†). The possible reaction process can be expressed as follows: Co3Se4 + 2Se → 3o-CoSe2, 300 °C(8) o-CoSe2 → c-CoSe2, 600 °C(9)
The structural information of the as-prepared samples was investigated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), it is clear that all the diffraction peaks in this pattern can be assigned to Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O (PDF 00-038-0547). After hydrothermal treatment in selenide solution, all the diffraction peaks of the sample are highly consistent with the monoclinic phase of Co3Se4 (PDF 96-901-2805), according to the blue curve in Fig. 2a. For comparison, the XRD pattern of Co3Se4 NPs is also presented in Fig. 2a (the olive curve); all the characteristic peaks in this pattern are almost identical to those of the Co3Se4 NTs, indicating that they have the same crystal structure. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the intensities of the diffraction peaks of the Co3Se4 NTs are stronger than those of the Co3Se4 NPs, which implies the Co3Se4 NTs possess better crystallinity. When annealing at 300 °C in Ar atmosphere, the monoclinic Co3Se4 nanotubes are converted into pure o-CoSe2, as evidenced from the XRD pattern (the black curve in Fig. 2a), where the main peaks at 30.8, 34.5, 40.0, 47.7, 50.2 and 53.5 can be attributed to the (101), (111), (120), (211), (002) and (031) planes of orthorhombic CoSe2 (PDF 00-053-0449). When the calcination temperature is increased to 600 °C, prominent reflection peaks are found at 30.5, 34.2, 37.6, 51.7, and 58.9 (the red curve in Fig. 2a), corresponding to the (200), (210), (211), (311), and (321) planes of cubic CoSe2 (PDF 00-010-0409). The XRD results indicate that the o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 samples were successfully prepared via chemical transformation of monoclinic Co3Se4 NTs at different calcination temperatures.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2 and Co3Se4 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs. (b) Raman spectra of the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2, and Co3Se4 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs. 

Fig. 2b shows the Raman spectra of the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2, and Co3Se4 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs. It can be seen that the Raman spectra for all the samples are similar in shape. In detail, the peak at 173 cm−1 can be assigned to the Se–Se stretching mode of o-CoSe2, while the first peaks at 189, 201 and 196 cm−1 of the c-CoSe2 and Co3Se4 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs can also be observed, respectively.56,57 It is well known that a shift in the first peak can be attributed to a change in the Se–Se bond lengths. In addition, the Raman spectra for c-CoSe2 exhibit three other characteristic peaks located at 468, 510, and 670 cm−1; these are very close to previous reports.58 Clearly, the peak position of o-CoSe2 shows a slight shift towards the negative direction in comparison with c-CoSe2. Similarly, the difference in the values of the major peaks of the Co3Se4 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs is about 4 cm−1. The phenomenon may be attributed to the quantity effect and the different morphologies of the as-obtained samples.59 Furthermore, the similarity of the Raman curves for the five samples is probably due to the fact that all the samples contain cobalt selenide-based phases.

Fig. 3 and S3 (ESI†) show FESEM images of the samples at different magnifications. As shown in Fig. 3a, the panoramic FESEM images show that the Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O sample consists of highly uniform nanorods. Clearly, the high-magnification FESEM image (Fig. 3b) exhibits that each nanorod has a smooth surface with an average diameter of about 150 nm. After hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 8 h, it can be seen that the Co3Se4 sample was successfully synthesized based on the Kirkendall effect and is composed of relatively regular nanotubes with lengths of several micrometers (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, Fig. 3d and e clearly show that these Co3Se4 nanotubes have extremely rough surfaces with densely embedded short nanoclusters. Meanwhile, the tubular structures of Co3Se4 have diameters of around 300 nm, pore sizes of 200 nm, and wall thicknesses of 50 nm. After the calcination treatment at 300 °C in Ar atmosphere for 2 h, the as-prepared o-CoSe2 samples still show tubular structures; however, numerous aggregated nanoparticles are assembled on the surface (Fig. S3a† and 3f and g), reflecting that the tubular structure possesses good thermal stability. Furthermore, by comparing Fig. 3e and g, it can be found that the pore size of these samples becomes smaller after annealing. When the calcination temperature is increased to 600 °C, it is clearly observed that the necklace-like c-CoSe2 inherits the tubular structure and uniformity from Co3Se4 and comprises slightly large hollow nanoparticles connected to one another (Fig. 3h and i); this unique necklace-like structure may be related to the fast reaction between the monoclinic Co3Se4 nanotubes and selenium vapor at a high calcination temperature.22,24 It is noteworthy that the increase of the calcination temperature results in an increase in the particle size of the surfaces of the nanotubes due to the growth and agglomeration of crystal particles.25 In addition, in order to understand the effects of urea on the morphology, CoCl2·6H2O and Na2SeO3 were used directly as reactants in the absence of urea to synthesize monoclinic Co3Se4. As can be seen in Fig. S3b,† the resulting samples are composed of abundant irregular nanoparticles, implying that urea plays a critical role in the formation of the tubular structures. In this system, these hollow tubular structures constructed of numerous tiny nanostructures can provide more active sites and charge transfer channels, endowing them with higher electrocatalytic activities.

The morphologies and detailed crystal structures of o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 were further investigated by TEM (Fig. 4 and S4, ESI†). The TEM image in Fig. 4a clearly reveals that the as-obtained o-CoSe2 has a well-defined tubular structure. Furthermore, it can be seen that this well-defined tubular structure is highly porous and has a shell thickness of around 20 to 30 nm (Fig. S4a†), which is consistent with the FESEM images of o-CoSe2. Fig. 4b exhibits the TEM image of c-CoSe2, which has a necklace-like structure constructed of nanoparticles connected to one another. Additionally, it can be clearly seen that the white points are distributed in every nanoparticle, indicating that these nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼250 nm are hollow but possess relatively thick shells (Fig. S4b†). The high resolution TEM images of o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 are presented in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. The lattice spacing of 0.290 nm is indexed to the (101) crystal plane of orthorhombic CoSe2, while the lattice spacing of 0.336 nm corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of cubic CoSe2. These results are in good agreement with the above XRD results. As shown in Fig. 4e, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images of o-CoSe2 clearly reflect that the Co and Se elements are uniformly distributed on the shells of the nanotubes.

The valences and chemical compositions of o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2, and Co3Se4 were investigated and compared through X-ray photoelectron (XPS) measurements. The survey spectra of the three samples are shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†), indicating the existence of Co, Se, C (as the reference) and O elements in the surface of this samples; the presence of O elements in all the samples can be ascribed to exposure of the samples to air. Fig. 5a and b reveal the XPS spectra of Co 2p and Se 3d, respectively, for the three samples. It can be found that o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 exhibit similar curves in the Co 2p and Se 3d XPS spectra due to their similar elemental valences and chemical compositions. Meanwhile, compared to the XPS spectra of o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2, Co3Se4 has two spin–orbit doublets in the Co 2p spectrum; also, the binding energy of Se 3d for Co3Se4 is slightly shifted to the positive direction, which is attributed to the chemical state change between Co and Se. More precisely, for the o-CoSe2 sample, the Co 2p spectrum in Fig. 5c demonstrates that the dominant peaks at 780.9 eV in Co 2p3/2 and 796.7 eV in Co 2p1/2 correspond to the Co2+ cations in CoSe2, of which the peak at 780.9 eV can be ascribed to Co2+ cations coordinated with Se ions.25,60 As shown in Fig. 5d, the two peaks at 54.5 eV and 55.3 eV can be attributed to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 of the Co–Se bonds, respectively; the broad peak at 59.1 eV indicates the presence of SeOx, which is consistent with previous reports.55,61 In the case of the Co3Se4 NTs, the Co 2p emission spectrum (Fig. 5e) can be fitted into two spin–orbit doublets and two shakeup satellites (marked “sat.”). The peaks at 779.2 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 794.2 eV (Co 2p1/2) are the first doublet corresponding to Co3+, and the peaks observed at 781.1 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 797.3 eV (Co 2p1/2) are the second doublet corresponding to Co2+.62,63 presented in Fig. 5f, the binding energies of Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2 are positively shifted to 54.7 eV and 55.6 eV, respectively, in comparison with that of o-CoSe2. The broad peak at 59.1 eV is the same as that of o-CoSe2. This phenomenon shows the obvious chemical state change of Se in the Co3Se4 sample. In addition, the high resolution XPS spectra of c-CoSe2 are presented in Fig. S5b and c;† these spectra exhibit similar XPS characteristics to o-CoSe2 because they have the same element valences.

The specific surface area and porosity properties of the as-obtained samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, and the results are presented in Fig. 6 and S6 (ESI†). All the isotherms can be classified as type-IV curves with type-H3 hysteresis loops at a relative pressure of 0.8 to 1.0p/p0, suggesting the existence of mesoporous structures in the samples. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the Co3Se4, o-CoSe2, and c-CoSe2 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs are 32.4, 27.5, 22.1 and 6.2 m2 g−1, respectively. Clearly, the Co3Se4 NTs have a larger specific surface area than other samples, which may be related to their well-defined tubular structures with shells composed of numerous tiny nanoclusters (as can be seen in the FESEM images of the Co3Se4 NTs). In addition, the pore size distributions of the as-obtained samples were calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method from the two branches of the isotherms. As shown in the inset of Fig. 6, the pore size of c-CoSe2 is 29.9 nm, which is larger than that of o-CoSe2 (28.8 nm) and the Co3Se4 NTs (23.0 nm). This result can be ascribed to the crystal growth of the nanostructures in the shell with increasing calcination temperature.64 Additionally, the three samples show extremely broad pore size distributions in the range of 5 to 100 nm, indicating that these samples possess massive mesopores and macropores. This tubular structure with a broad pore size distribution can provide a high electroactive surface area and benefit the contact of electroactive materials and electrolyte ions, which is beneficial to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the materials.65

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs assembled with the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2, and Co3Se4 NTs, Pt, and the Co3Se4 NPs, the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the cells were measured (Fig. 7a). Meanwhile, the corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table 1; these include open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). Remarkably, the DSSC based on o-CoSe2 delivered the highest PCE (9.34%) compared to c-CoSe2 (8.91%), the Co3Se4 NTs (8.44%), Pt (8.15%) and the Co3Se4 NPs (7.48%) under the same conditions; the Jsc values of the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2 and Co3Se4 NTs, Pt, and the Co3Se4 NPs were 17.35, 16.60, 16.10, 15.52 and 14.66 mA cm−2, respectively. The improvement in the PCE can be mainly ascribed to the increase of Jsc due to the fast electron transport at the CE/electrolyte interface and the low charge transfer resistance for I3− reduction. In detail, the DSSC assembled with the o-CoSe2 CE yielded a higher PCE and FF (0.70) in comparison with c-CoSe2 (FF = 0.69), revealing that o-CoSe2 is a more efficient electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity and charge transfer ability for the reduction of I3−; this may be ascribed to the different structural characteristics of the two phases of CoSe2. Moreover, the tubular nanostructured o-CoSe2 surface embedded with more tiny nanoparticles can enhance the surface area that is exposed to the electrolyte. On the other hand, the PCE value of the Co3Se4 NTs was higher than that of the Co3Se4 NPs because the well-defined tubular structure contributed to higher electrocatalytic activity compared with the amorphous particles, emphasizing the importance of morphology to the electrocatalytic activity.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to elucidate the electrochemical characteristics of the different CEs; the EIS measurements were conducted on symmetrical dummy cells fabricated with sandwich-like structures (CE/electrolyte/CE). As shown in Fig. 7b, all the Nyquist plots consist of two semicircles in the lower (right) and higher (left) frequency regions, and the equivalent circuit diagrams contain four impedance performance parameters. The high frequency intercepts on the real axis are assigned to the series resistance (Rs), whereas the high frequency semicircle is assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE) at the CE/electrolyte interface. The semicircle in the low frequency range corresponds to the Nernst diffusion limited impedance (Zn) of the redox couple of in the electrolyte.66 The relevant parameters were obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots and are listed in Table 1. Apparently, all the CEs reveal very similar Rs values, which manifests that the effect of the Rs values of the different CEs on their photovoltaic performance can be ignored.11 Therefore, Rct is a very important parameter for assessing the catalytic activity of the counter electrodes. According to Table 1, the sequence of the Rct values is o-CoSe2 (0.82 Ω) < c-CoSe2 (0.91 Ω) < Co3Se4 NTs (1.62 Ω) < Pt (2.05 Ω) < Co3Se4 NPs (3.15 Ω), demonstrating that the catalytic activity decreases in the order of o-CoSe2 > c-CoSe2 > Co3Se4 NTs > Pt > Co3Se4 NPs, which is consistent with the CV data given below. The lowest Rct value was found for the o-CoSe2 CE, which indicates that it possesses the highest electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction and the fastest electron transfer from the CE to the electrolyte.
The electrocatalytic activities of the different CEs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 8a). Apparently, all the curves are composed of two typical pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks (Ox-1/Red-1, Ox-2/Red-2). The left and right pairs can be assigned to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I3− (eqn (10)) and I2/I3− (eqn (11)), respectively.67,68 I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(10) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(11)

(c) The relationship between the redox current densities and the square root of the scan rates. (d) Tafel polarization curves of the symmetric dummy cells with different CEs. 
The catalytic ability of the CEs for the reduction of I3− to I− can be evaluated by the left pair of peaks (Ox-1 and Red-1) in the CV curves. Therefore, the peak-to-peak potential separation (Epp) between Red-1 and Ox-1 and the absolute value of peak current intensity (|JRed-1|) are two important parameters for assessing the catalytic activity of a CE (Table 2). The higher |JRed-1| value reflects the faster catalytic reaction speed, whereas the Epp value is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of a redox reaction. Namely, the higher |JRed-1| value and lower Epp value indicate better catalytic activity for the reduction of I3−.69 Compared with the Pt CE, the DSSCs with o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2 and Co3Se4 NTs CEs exhibited higher |JRed-1| and lower Epp values, signifying that the electrocatalytic activities of the three electrodes were superior to that of the Pt electrode; this may be due to the fact that the high specific surface areas of the three samples with massive mesopores and macropores are beneficial to the contact and fast diffusion between the CE and the electrolyte. In particular, the o-CoSe2 CE showed the highest |JRed-1| value and lowest Epp value, suggesting that o-CoSe2 possesses the best electrocatalytic activity as a CE material for DSSC. Furthermore, considering the lower |JRed-1| and higher Epp values, the Co3Se4 NPs are inferior to Pt and the other Co-based materials and are expected to demonstrate the lowest electrocatalytic activity toward I3− reduction. Taking the Co3Se4 NTs and o-CoSe2 as examples, a post-mortem study showed that the tubular morphologies of the Co3Se4 NTs and o-CoSe2 remain almost unaltered after DSSC tests, except that the surface becomes slightly smoother (Fig. S7a and c†).

To elucidate the relationship between the peak current densities (Ox-1 and Red-1) and the scanning rates, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the o-CoSe2 electrode were conducted at different scan rates and are shown in Fig. 8b. As the scanning rates were increased from 10 to 100 mV s−1, the peak current densities increased accordingly; a linear relationship between the peak current density and the square root of the scanning rate can be observed in Fig. 8c, indicating that the surface of the o-CoSe2 CE represents the diffusion limitation of the redox reactions and that there is no specific interaction between the I−/I3− redox couple and o-CoSe2 CE, according to the Langmuir isotherm principle.70
The Tafel polarization curves of the different CEs were measured for the symmetric cells used in the EIS experiments. As shown in Fig. 8d, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim, the intersection of the anodic branch with the y axis) and the exchange current density (J0, the slope for the anodic or cathodic branch) are closely correlated with the catalytic ability of the CEs (Table 2). A higher Jlim reveals a larger ionic diffusion coefficient between the two electrodes based on eqn (12), while a higher J0 indicates better catalytic activity for I3− reduction; also, there is a positive correlation between J0 and Rct based on eqn (13).71 D = lJlim/2nFC(12) J0 = RT/nFRct(13)where D is the diffusion coefficient, l is the distance between the two electrodes, F is Faraday's constant, n (n = 2) is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, C is the I3− concentration, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (298 K), and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. The Jlim decreased in the order of o-CoSe2 (1.93 log(mA cm−2)) > c-CoSe2 (1.89 log(mA cm−2)) > Co3Se4 NTs (1.83 log(mA cm−2)) > Pt (1.79 log(mA cm−2)) > Co3Se4 NPs (1.70 log(mA cm−2)), indicating that the diffusion coefficients of triiodide for these CEs varied in the positive sequence. On the other hand, the J0 values also followed the order of o-CoSe2 > c-CoSe2 > Co3Se4 NTs > Pt > Co3Se4 NPs, which is consistent with the Rct trend in the EIS results. This result also demonstrates that the as-obtained o-CoSe2 electrode has promising potential applications in the field of DSSCs.
A number of Co-based materials have been developed in recent years as non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for various applications, especially for alkaline-medium HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes, owing to their outstanding catalytic activities and exceptional stabilities.72–74 Therefore, the as-obtained o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2, and Co3Se4 NTs and Co3Se4 NPs were also tested as electrocatalysts for HER in 1.0 M KOH solution at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. Fig. 9a shows the typical polarization curves for all the samples within a cathodic potential, using commercial Pt/C as a reference, which gave an onset overpotential (ηonset) of nearly zero at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. It can be observed that the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2 and Co3Se4 NTs exhibited outstanding HER activity in 1.0 M KOH solution based on the overpotentials. Remarkably, o-CoSe2 delivered a low ηonset of 54 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, while higher ηonset values of 66 and 75 mV were acquired for c-CoSe2 and the Co3Se4 NTs, respectively. Additionally, we tested the HER performance of the Co3Se4 NPs; the corresponding ηonset was 140 mV at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, reflecting that this sample demonstrated the lowest HER activity. For HER catalysts, it is necessary to compare the overpotential demands to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The corresponding overpotentials (η10) are 124, 149, 184, and 259 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2, and Co3Se4 NTs and the Co3Se4 NPs, respectively. Impressively, the lowest overpotential for o-CoSe2 indicates that it has superior electrocatalytic properties for HER in alkaline medium; it also outperforms many other non-noble metal-based catalysts, including Ni2P nanoparticles,75 Ni–Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocubes,76 CoP nanowire arrays,77 and cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen–carbon.78 A detailed comparison is presented in Table S1.†

(f) Calculated (solid line) and measured (red dot) amounts of hydrogen at different times for o-CoSe2 at an overpotential of 250 mV in 1.0 M KOH.85 
The inherent properties of the different catalysts were probed by corresponding Tafel plots, in which the linear portion of the Tafel plot is fitted by the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where b is the Tafel slope and j is the current density).33 Usually, a small Tafel slope will result in more advantageous electrochemical reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 9b, the Tafel slope of commercial Pt/C is 35.2 mV per decade, which is close to the reported value.79 Moreover, the Tafel slope for o-CoSe2 is ∼65.9 mV per decade, which is smaller than that of c-CoSe2 (79.1 mV per decade), Co3Se4 NTs (103.7 mV per decade) and Co3Se4 NPs (114.7 mV per decade), confirming that o-CoSe2 possesses favorable reaction kinetics.
To further investigate the kinetics of the as-obtained catalysts at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the HER process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in 1.0 M KOH solution (Fig. 9c). Clearly, the Nyquist plots for all the electrodes consist of semicircles; the diameter of the semicircle indicates the charge transfer resistance (Rct). A smaller Rct indicates a faster charge transfer capacity.76 The Rct value of o-CoSe2 is 105 Ω, much smaller than the values of 129 Ω, 155 Ω and 269 Ω for o-CoSe2, Co3Se4 NTs and Co3Se4 NPs, respectively; this signifies that o-CoSe2 has favorable kinetics toward H2 (g) evolution and consequently shows enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, durability is a vital criterion for a good electrocatalyst. Fig. 9d shows a comparison of the polarization curves of o-CoSe2 before and after CV scanning for 2000 cycles. At the end of cycling, it can be seen that the o-CoSe2 exhibits similar polarization curves, with a small shift of only around 14 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2; this indicates that o-CoSe2 possesses good durability for long-term electrochemical processes. The physical stabilities of the Co3Se4 NTs and o-CoSe2 were further characterized by SEM and XRD (Fig. S7 and S8†). Satisfyingly, the tubular structures of the Co3Se4 NTs and o-CoSe2 were retained. In addition, it can be seen that the surfaces of the Co3Se4 NTs and o-CoSe2 after the HER stability tests were rougher, which may be associated with the stripping of H2 during the tests. Fig. S8† shows the XRD patterns of Co3Se4 NTs and o-CoSe2 after the HER stability tests. The peak positions can be indexed to Co3Se4 NTs (PDF 96-901-2805) and o-CoSe2 (PDF 00-053-0449). Therefore, the morphologies and compositions of the catalysts were well preserved after the stability tests.
To further investigate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrode, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was estimated by measuring cyclic voltammograms in a non-faradaic region from 0.1 to 0.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. S9†).80,81 Typically, the Cdl is linearly proportional to the ECSA, which can be derived from the slope of the linear relationship between current density and scan rate (Fig. 9e).82,83 Apparently, the Cdl of o-CoSe2 (7.38 mF cm−2) is larger than that of c-CoSe2 (6.45 mF cm−2), the Co3Se4 NTs (4.87 mF cm−2) and the Co3Se4 NPs (3.16 mF cm−2), indicating that o-CoSe2 possesses more active sites at the solid–liquid interface, which is beneficial for the electrocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, the exchange current densities (J0) of the different samples were also obtained by the extrapolation of Tafel plots (Fig. S10†) and listed in Table 3, which reflects the intrinsic rate of electron transfer under reversible conditions.84 The o-CoSe2 sample shows an exchange current density of 0.15 mA cm−2, outperforming the values of 0.13 mA cm−2, 0.11 mA cm−2 and 0.08 mA cm−2 for c-CoSe2, Co3Se4 NTs and Co3Se4 NPs, respectively.

We further confirmed the hydrogen generation by gas chromatography (GC) to quantitatively measure the generated hydrogen. Cathodic electrolysis was performed by maintaining an o-CoSe2-loaded glassy carbon plate at a static overpotential of 250 mV (vs. RHE) for 180 min. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of the HER process can be obtained by dividing the measured amount of hydrogen with theoretically calculated hydrogen (assuming 100% FE). The agreement of the calculated and measured values (Fig. 9f) indicates that o-CoSe2 has a FE of nearly 100%.85,86
The above results display the superior electrocatalytic activity of the o-CoSe2 nanotubes for the DSSC and HER. This superior performance can be chiefly ascribed to the advantageous structural features of the o-CoSe2 nanotubes. Particularly, the hollow tubular space can be regarded as a reservoir for electrolytes, which is conducive to increase the interior reaction space for fast diffusion and reaction between the electroactive materials and the electrolyte.87 Meanwhile, the well-defined tubular structure, with a shell composed of numerous tiny nanoparticles, gives rise to a relatively large surface area and offers abundant electroactive sites for electrochemical reactions, resulting in high electrochemical activity.41,88 In addition, the open spaces between the nanoparticles and the massive mesopores and macropores existing in the shell can shorten the diffusion paths for both mass and charge transport, thus accelerating the charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.19
Conclusions
In summary, we report an effective and promising approach for the synthesis of o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 tubular structures from Co3Se4 nanotubes. The process involves a facile precursor transformation method and a subsequent annealing strategy in Ar atmosphere. As a reference, we also prepared amorphous Co3Se4 NPs without adding urea; our results show that urea has an important effect on the morphologies of the samples and ultimately reinforces their electrocatalytic activities. The as-obtained samples were then used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both DSSCs and HER in alkaline medium, with high catalytic activity. Benefiting from advantageous structural features, the tubular-structured o-CoSe2 showed particularly excellent electrocatalytic activity for DSSC, producing a PCE of 9.34%; this value is much higher than that of a Pt CE (8.15%). In addition, the tubular-structured o-CoSe2 also demonstrated a low onset overpotential (∼54 mV) and a small Tafel slope (∼65.9 mV per decade) as a HER catalyst in alkaline medium. As a demonstration, we expect that this effective and promising approach can be extended to fabricate other advanced electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy conversion technologies by tuning their crystal structures and surface morphologies.
