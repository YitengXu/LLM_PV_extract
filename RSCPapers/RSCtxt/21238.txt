In this article, we analyze the electronic and optical properties of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 with Cmcm space group based on the first-principles calculations, which are rarely studied experimentally and theoretically. In addition, we also analyze the properties of the cubic and orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 with Pmm and Pnma space groups for comparison, respectively.

The calculated bandgap values of the cubic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, and the orthorhombic (Pnma) CsPbBr3 are in good agreement with the experimental data. The results show that the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are direct bandgap semiconductors with bandgap values of 2.358 eV and 2.062 eV, respectively, which are close to the bandgap values of their orthorhombic (Pnma) counterparts. In addition, the optical properties in the photon energy range of 0–4 eV indicate that the potential of the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 as light-absorbing materials is close to that of the orthorhombic (Pnma) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively.
1. Introduction
Energy is closely related to the sustainable development of human society. How to utilize solar energy with efficient, environmentally friendly, and low-cost technologies is one of the efforts of mankind to solve the energy crisis. Recently, due to the excellent physical and chemical properties, halide perovskite materials have been extensively studied to explore their applications in solar cells, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes, etc. In the process of research and development of solar cells, halide perovskite materials have shown excellent application prospects. Among the halide perovskite materials, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites represented by CH3NH3PbX3 and HC(CH2)2PbX3 (X = Br, I) have attracted the attention of many researchers. These perovskites have the potential to become ideal light-absorbing materials for low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells due to their advantages in optoelectronic properties.1–4 Recently, the certified record of power conversion efficiency of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells has reached 25.2%5 from 3.8%6 at the lab scale. However, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are easy to decompose under environmental conditions such as humidity, heat, light and oxygen, resulting in poor stability. The poor long-term stability hinders the commercialization of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells to a certain extent.7–9 In recent years, by replacing the CH3NH3+ and HC(CH2)2+ with Cs+, the all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites have also attracted wide attention because of their better stability than their organic–inorganic counterparts containing highly hygroscopic and volatile organic cations.2,10–14 They have been widely studied as light-absorbing materials for solar cells and have shown promising power conversion efficiency in experiments. Wang et al. reported that the power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell is 15.07%, which is remarkably stable under ambient conditions.15 Later, Chang et al. enhanced the power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cell to 19% via an additive strategy.16 Compared with CsPbI3, CsPbBr3 has a larger bandgap value. However, CsPbBr3 has also attracted considerable attention in tandem and semitransparent perovskite solar cells.17 Up to now, CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency of more than 10% with an ultrahigh open-circuit voltage of 1.70 V.18 In addition, in semitransparent photovoltaic applications, CsPbBr3 quantum dot solar cells delivered an efficiency exceeding 5% together with an open-circuit voltage of 1.65 V, which exhibit excellent stability, ultrahigh voltage and high transparency over the entire visible spectrum region.19 At present, researchers are trying to improve the performances of CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells by introducing a variety of additives and interface materials.
Recently, Malyshkin et al. used a combination of in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry methods to study the phase behavior of CsPbBr3 in the temperature range of 25–200 °C.20 They found that there is a new phase transition in CsPbBr3. The new phase of CsPbBr3 has an orthorhombic structure with Cmcm space group and is stable at least in the temperature range of 57–62 °C.20 Although the temperature range is narrow, it is of great significance for revealing the phase transition behavior of CsPbBr3. In this article, we report a detailed investigation of the electronic and optical properties of the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 with Cmcm space group by using first-principles calculations, which can provide important information for whether the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbBr3 can be used in solar cells. Considering that CsPbI3 shows excellent application prospects in the field of solar cells, we also predict the properties of the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbI3 by replacing Br with I atoms. In addition, for comparison, we calculated the electronic and optical properties of the cubic and orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 with Pmm and Pnma space groups, respectively. This work is helpful to understand the similarities and differences in electronic and optical properties between the different phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3.
2. Computational methods
In the present study, all calculations were carried out by using the CASTEP module in Materials Studio package, which employs the density functional theory plane-wave pseudopotential method.21,22 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)23 was used as the exchange–correlation functional. The norm-conserving pseudopotentials were used to describe the interactions between ions and electrons. The plane-wave cutoff energy and SCF convergence threshold were specified as 1050 eV and 5.0 × 10−7 eV per atom, respectively. In order to obtain stable crystal structures to calculate the electronic and optical properties, the crystal structures of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 were optimized by using the Monkhorst–Pack k-point grids of 12 × 12 × 12, 6 × 4 × 6 and 4 × 4 × 4 for the cubic, orthorhombic (Pnma) and orthorhombic (Cmcm) phases, respectively. At the same time, the BFGS minimizer24 was used. The geometry optimization convergence thresholds were given as follows: 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom for energy change, 0.02 GPa for maximum stress, 0.01 eV Å−1 for maximum force, and 5.0 × 10−4 Å for maximum displacement. The PBE functional and norm-conserving pseudopotentials were also used to calculate electronic and optical properties of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, and the corresponding Monkhorst–Pack k-point grids were 12 × 12 × 12, 9 × 6 × 9 and 9 × 9 × 6 for the cubic, orthorhombic (Pnma) and orthorhombic (Cmcm) phases, respectively. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect was not taken into account in all calculations. It is found that the bandgap values of the cubic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, and the orthorhombic (Pnma) CsPbBr3 calculated by the above methods are in good agreement with the experimental data. This is mainly caused by fortuitous error cancellation from two aspects. On the one hand, the GGA-PBE method often underestimates the bandgap values of materials due to the discontinuity of exchange–correlation energy,25–27 and on the other hand, the SOC effect can significantly lower the calculated bandgap values of Pb-based halide perovskites.28,29 The valence electron configurations considered in all calculations were 5s25p66s1 for Cs, 5s25p65d106s26p2 for Pb, 4s24p5 for Br and 5s25p5 for I.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties
It is well known that CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 exist in different phases at different temperature ranges.30 In this article, we only focus on the cubic and orthorhombic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. According to the reference,20 we built the crystal structures of the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 (cm-CsPbBr3, cm-CsPbI3), as shown in Fig. 1. The crystal structures of the cubic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 (pm-CsPbBr3, pm-CsPbI3) and the orthorhombic (Pnma) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 (pn-CsPbBr3, pn-CsPbI3), which have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically,31–34 are also shown in Fig. 1. All the crystal structures are fully relaxed before calculating the electronic and optical properties. The obtained crystal parameters of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are listed in Table 1. For the lattice constants of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, it can be found that the calculated results are in good agreement with the available experimental results. The maximum error between theoretical and experimental results is 1.93%, which is acceptable for calculating the electronic and optical properties. For the cubic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, the length of Pb–X bonds are the same, indicating that Pb and X atoms form regular octahedrons with Pb as the center. For the two orthorhombic phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, because the six halogen atoms connected to the Pb atom do not form equal-length Pb–X bonds, there are no regular octahedrons in the crystals. In addition, it can be found that the calculated Pb–X bond length of the cubic phase of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are less than that of the two orthorhombic phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively.

3.2. Electronic properties
The band structures and density of states (DOS) of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 were calculated based on the optimized crystal structures. The selected k-paths in the Brillouin zone are X–R–M–G–R, G–Z–T–Y–S–X–U–R and G–Z–T–Y–G–S–R–Z for the Pmm, Pnma and Cmcm space groups of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, respectively. The calculated band structures of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding bandgap values are listed in Table 2. Experimentally, the bandgap values of the pm-CsPbI3 and pm-CsPbBr3 are 1.73 eV12,39 and about 2.3 eV,40–42 respectively. It can be seen from Table 2 that the calculated bandgap value of the pm-CsPbI3 is greater than the experimental value, while the calculated bandgap value of the pm-CsPbBr3 is less than the experimental values. But in general, the calculated bandgap values agree well with the experimental values for the cubic phase. The difference between the calculated and experimental bandgap values of pn-CsPbI3 is greater than that of pm-CsPbI3. This is because the increase in the number of atoms in the unit cell leads to unsatisfactory error cancellation. However, the calculated bandgap value of pn-CsPbBr3 agrees very well with the experimental value, which indicates that the calculated bandgap value of cm-CsPbBr3 has more guiding significance for experimental research. It can be seen from Table 2 that the calculated bandgap values of the cm-CsPbBr3 and cm-CsPbI3 are 2.358 eV and 2.062 eV, respectively. In addition, as we can see from Fig. 2, all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are direct bandgap semiconductors. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the cubic phase are located at the R (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) point in the Brillouin zone, while the VBM and CBM of the two orthorhombic phases are both located at the G (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) point.

For further studying the electronic properties of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, the total and partial DOS are depicted in Fig. 3 to understand the participation of all states and each state in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. In this study, although the components or space groups are different, it is clear from Fig. 3 that all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 share many characteristics with each other. The most important point is that the VBM is mainly composed of the X-p (Br-4p or I-5p) states, while the CBM is dominated by Pb-6p states, which shows the dominant transitions near the Fermi level take place from Br-4p or I-5p states in the VBM to the Pb-6p states in the CBM. Comparing the partial DOS of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, the contribution levels of the different states of each element have similar competitive relationships. In addition, the contribution of Cs to the VBM and CBM is negligible.

3.3. Optical properties
In order to explore whether the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 have the potential as light-absorbing materials in solar cells, we calculated the optical properties of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 in the photon energy range of 0–4 eV, which is a very significant range for the light-absorbing materials of solar cells. The optical properties of light-absorbing materials can be explained in terms of the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), where the ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively.43–45 The curves of ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) for all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are presented in Fig. 4(a and b), respectively. The static dielectric constant ε1(0) values are 4.57, 4.47 and 4.45 for pm-CsPbBr3, pn-CsPbBr3 and cm-CsPbBr3, and 5.70, 5.45 and 5.39 for pm-CsPbI3, pn-CsPbI3 and cm-CsPbI3, respectively. The values of ε1(ω) increase with increasing photon energy and reach the maximum values at about 2.69 eV and 2.14 eV for the pm-CsPbBr3 and pm-CsPbI3, 2.97 eV and 2.44 eV for the pn-CsPbBr3 and pn-CsPbI3, and 2.93 eV and 2.43 eV for the cm-CsPbBr3 and cm-CsPbI3, respectively. The static and maximum values of ε1(ω) for all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are summarized in Table 2. For both CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, it can be concluded that the ε1(0) of the cubic phase is greater than that of the two orthorhombic phases, and the two orthorhombic phases with the Pnma and Cmcm space groups have very close ε1(0) and peak positions in the photon energy range of 0–4 eV. For ε2(ω), it can be found that all phases of CsPbI3 have a complete peak, which is mainly formed by electron transitions from I-5p states in the VBM to Pb-6p states in the CBM. In addition, the peak of pn-CsPbI3 is slightly higher than that of cm-CsPbI3.
 Fig. 4  The calculated (a) real and (b) imaginary parts of the dielectric function, (c) reflectivity, and (d) absorption coefficient for all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. 
Other related optical properties, such as reflectivity R(ω) and absorption coefficient α(ω), can be calculated by the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function.43–45Fig. 4(c) shows the curves of reflectivity R(ω) for all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 with the change of photon energy. To facilitate comparison, the static values of R(ω) are summarized in Table 2. It can be found that for both CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, the values of R(0) gradually decrease with the order of the Pmm, Pnma and Cmcm space groups, and the difference in the value of R(0) between the two orthorhombic phases is only 0.001. The absorption coefficient α(ω) is an important indicator for evaluating whether the material can be used as a light-absorbing material for solar cells. Fig. 4(d) shows the curves of α(ω) for all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. For both CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, it can be found that the cubic phase has a better light absorption capacity than the two orthorhombic phases in the visible light range. In addition, in the visible light range, the two orthorhombic phases of each compound have the same light absorption capacity, while in the near ultraviolet range, the orthorhombic phase with the Pnma space group has a slightly higher light absorption capacity than its orthorhombic phase with the Cmcm space group. In short, the light absorption capacity of cm-CsPbBr3 and cm-CsPbI3 is close to that of pn-CsPbBr3 and pn-CsPbI3, respectively.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, the first-principles calculations have been performed to obtain the electronic and optical properties of the cubic (Pmm) and orthorhombic (Pnma and Cmcm) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. The optimized lattice constants of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are very close to the previous experimental results. For the two orthorhombic phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, because the six halogen atoms connected to the Pb atom do not form equal-length Pb–X bonds, there are no regular octahedrons in the crystals. The bandgap values of the orthorhombic (Cmcm) CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are 2.358 eV and 2.062 eV, respectively, and they are both direct bandgap semiconductors. For all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, the VBM is mainly composed of the X-p (Br-4p or I-5p) states, while the CBM is dominated by Pb-6p states. The optical properties of all phases of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, such as dielectric function, reflectivity, and absorption coefficient, in the photon energy range of 0–4 eV are presented. The results show that the ε1(0) and R(0) of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 gradually decrease in the order of phase change from Pmm, to Pnma, to Cmcm. In addition, the optical properties indicate that the potential of cm-CsPbBr3 and cm-CsPbI3 as light-absorbing materials is close to that of pn-CsPbBr3 and pn-CsPbI3, respectively. This work is meaningful for understanding the influence of phase transition on the electronic and optical properties of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3.
