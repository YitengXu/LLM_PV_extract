    , Accepted 16th July 2018First published on 16th July 2018AbstractA structurally stable silicon allotrope is predicted by means of first principles calculations. This new structure is composed of a six-membered ring, a five-membered ring and a three-membered ring with the space group PA and fvs topology, which is named fvs-Si48. The calculations of geometrical, vibrational, and electronic and optical properties reveal that fvs-Si48 has good mechanical stability with a mass density of 1.86 g cm−3. More importantly, it is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.15 eV. From the analysis of its optical properties, there is the possibility of its synthesis in theory. This fvs-Si48 could have a wide range of applications in photo catalysts, optoelectronics, hydrogen storage and aerospace engineering.
Introduction
With the rapid developments in the semiconductor industry, silicon, which is the second most abundant element, has now become indispensable in many fields.1 After purification, the element silicon is widely used in making electronic components and solar panels. Under standard conditions, silicon allotropes exist in the form of a cubic diamond phase, which is named dia-Si in this paper, as it is the most thermodynamically stable phase. Similar to carbon, the energy landscape of silicon is very complex, and a great number of hypothetical allotropes could be found within small energy differences from the ground state.2–4
In the semiconductor industry, there are many reasons why silicon is the most important element, including abundance, stability, durability and relatively low economic costs. However, there are also severe shortcomings. As an indirect bandgap material, the direct gap of dia-Si (3.2 eV) is much wider than its indirect gap (1.17 eV), which requires phonons to mediate electronic excitations from visible and infrared light. The absorption efficiency of sunlight is not high enough under these conditions. Therefore, this kind of indirect bandgap material is not a good choice to make next-generation semiconductors, such as light-emitting diodes,5,6 high-efficiency transistors7 and photovoltaic devices.4 Though there exist other possible photovoltaic materials, such as CIGS8,9 and perovskites,10–12 they are either unaffordable or unstable and are precluded from industrialization.
The development of research approaches towards a new silicon allotrope with a direct band gap is, therefore, an emerging task in the photovoltaic industry. As indicated in the Shockley–Queisser limit,13 the maximum solar conversion efficiency of single p–n junction cells could be expressed as a function of the band gap, which reached 33.7% near a band gap of 1.34 eV.13 Therefore, the target allotrope is required to have a direct band gap of ∼1.3 eV.13 However, none of the existing silicon structures has met this requirement. The visible light absorption ability of probable silicon allotropes with a lower direct band gap should be prominently improved. In addition, it should also have quasi-direct band gaps, in which the indirect and direct gaps are nearly degenerated.3,4
Besides the most stable dia-Si (diamond silicon), there are a variety of Si allotropes that are proved to be metastable, such as (β-Sn)-Si (Si-II),14 the BC8 structure (Si-III),15 lonsdaleite Si (Si-IV),15 R8-Si (Si-XII),16 allo-Si,17 two-dimensional silicene18 and the open frame oC24-Si1111. However, several shortcomings19 precluded them from industrialization. To date, the desired optical properties are still difficult to achieve in most of the silicon allotropes. There are numbers of theoretical designs and predictions for accessing direct gap silicon allotropes, such as cubic Si.20,21,33
To find new silicon allotropes with direct or quasi-direct band gaps, some other chemical frameworks, like carbon networks, have been implemented to provide various topological networks.22–27 With a high similarity between silicon and carbon, silicon allotropes could also be investigated by using the same symmetry of carbon networks. As investigated, a three-membered ring silicon allotrope has been theoretically proposed but never experimentally synthesized.28,29 Recently, T-carbon,30 a triple ring carbon structure, has been successfully experimentally realized,31 which proved that the triple ring structure could be one of the stable configurations in carbon. Inspired by this method, we investigated a semiconducting silicon with 48 atoms per cubic cell belonging to the PA (No. 205) symmetry group which also has a triple ring silicon structure (Fig. 1).

Methodology
The topology analysis and classification of the underlying net have been implemented into the software TOPOS32 with the database of RCSR (Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource24) and TOPOS TTD (Topology Type Database). Examination of the topology gives the structure containing two kinds of silicon, and the point symbols for each silicon are {53;63} and {3;52;63}. Connection of these two kinds of silicon results in a 3D 4-connected 2-nodal net, with the point symbols for the net {3;52;63} and {53;63}, which indicates that its topology type is fvs33 in the RCSR database after searching.
In this simulation, fvs-Si48 is generated by combining the genetic algorithm with an inverse band property design. It is called fvs-48 because there are 48 silicon atoms in a single unit cell, and fvs is the RCSR symbol of the topology type that was determined by topology analysis. This genetic algorithm is combined with Quantum Espresso codes here, which has already fulfilled some tasks such as predicting stable structures, determining space groups and calculating the features of the structures. Since the DFT method will output the bandgap data simultaneously, an inverse band gap design is combined to this algorithm. When a structure is simulated, its bandgap properties will be judged based on its calculated band energies and k-points, in which case only the structures of direct bandgap properties will be collected as the final structure. The total energy calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT), using the Quantum Espresso code,10 the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)34 functional for the exchange–correlation functional is used to calculate the ground state wavefunction, and we use the scalar-relativistic norm-conserving pseudopotentials12 with a 60 Ry kinetic energy cut-off applied. The G0W0 approximation was used for the self-energy operator to apply quasi-particle bandgap corrections to the PBE function. The screening is treated by the plasmon-pole approximation.35 To calculate the exciton binding energy related to the electron–hole interactions, we resolve the BSE (Bethe–Salpeter equation) approach for the two-particle Green function36 embedded in the Yambo code.37
Properties
Based on the method introduced above, a new candidate of silicon allotropes with a direct band gap has been explored. The atomic crystal structure of the stable fvs-Si48 silicon allotrope is shown in Fig. 2(a). This structure is primitive. It contains three-, five-, and six-membered rings. It can be generated from two neighbors’ six-membered rings. In this new structure, the lattice constant is about 10.56 Å. These silicon atoms occupy the Wyckoff position 24d1 (x, y, z) with x = 0.28, y = 0.050, z = 0.82, and 24d2 (x, y, z) with x = 0.16, y = 0.38, and z = 0.95. The space group (SG), mass density (ρ), lattice constant (l), bulk modulus (B), cohesive energy (Ecoh), and energy band gap (Eg) at zero pressure of dia-Si, oC12-Si, tP16-Si, oF16-Si, tI16-Si, hP12-Si, mC12-Si, Si20-T, and fvs-Si48 are computed and summarized in Table 1 for comparison. Note that all data presented here, apart from the sources indicated, were obtained by this work using the same method, which can thus be compared reasonably at the same level. The cohesive energy Ecoh is defined as Ecoh = (Etot − n × ESi)/n, where Etot is the total energy of a structure and ESi is the cohesive energy of a single silicon with spin. As shown in Fig. 2(b), there are four distinct bonds with a length of 2.39 Å (not connected with one of the silicons in the three-membered rings), 2.36 Å and 2.35 Å (connected with one of the silicons in the three-membered rings), and 2.34 Å (the bond length of the three-membered rings) for fvs-Si48, where not-connected-with-ring bonds are longer, and the bonds of the rings are shorter than those of dia-Si. It is also found that the bond angles, 60°, in the three-membered rings and 3 in 5 angles in the five-membered rings are smaller than that in dia-Si (109.5°), while other 2 angles are nearly the dia-Si angle, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Compared with the small increase of angles in the neighboring six-membered rings, this structure led to an increase in the total energy. Due to the torsion of the bonds and angles, the mass density of fvs-Si48 is the smallest (1.86 g cm−3) among dia-Si, oC12-Si, tP16-Si, oF16-Si, tI16-Si, hP12-Si, mC12-Si, Si20-T, and Si-24. Note that this mass density is smaller than 2 g cm−3.

Elastic constant
The elastic constant tensor Cij of fvs-Si48 is calculated to grasp the mechanical stability. Due to the criteria of mechanical stability, a positive crystal deformation energy is required, leading to the positive determination of Cij. Due to the crystal symmetry, the elastic constants of the tetragonal phase should satisfy the following.38
The calculated elastic constant matrix Cij isC11 > 0, C44 > 0,C11 > |C12|, (C11 + C12) > 0  
The results of the elastic moduli for the fvs-Si48 structure satisfy the mechanical stability criteria, demonstrating that it is mechanically stable. Furthermore, with the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximation,34 the estimated bulk modulus is 67.78 GPa, which indicates that the fvs-Si48 structure could be softer than other silicon allotropes. Fig. 2(c) shows the energy–volume relations per atom for the fvs-Si48 structure and the other allotropes that have been discovered before oC24-S, dia-Si and tP16-Si.21 From the physical properties as listed in Table 1 and the E–V curve shown in Fig. 2(c), it can be observed that the new silicon allotrope is metastable with an energy higher than that of dia-Si of about 0.25 eV per atom. These results indicate that this new silicon allotrope is thermodynamically favorable than the most widely used dia-Si and is similar to other direct and quasi-direct bandgap silicon allotropes. From the quadratic E–V relation, we can see that all of them are thermodynamically stable and protected by obvious energy barriers in their individual local states. If we compare the E–V curve of Si-48 with that of dia-Si, it can be easily concluded that the geometrical structure is more stable than dia-Si. Furthermore, the two E–V curves of fvs-Si48 and dia-Si have an intersection, which indicates that it is possible to synthesize the new silicon by dia-Si in the experiment.
To further investigate the kinetic stability of fvs-Si48, we investigate the phonon spectra and phonon density of states (pDOS), as shown in Fig. 3. There is no imaginary frequency appearance in the phonon spectra or in the pDOS. The frequency of the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon branch of fvs-Si48 is 16 THz, larger than that of the dia-Si phase (15 THz),30 and this frequency difference is caused by the bonding states of silicon, the silicon atom of the 24d1 Wyckoff position is located on the three-membered ring and the 24d2-type silicon atom is on the six-membered ring. As shown in Fig. 3(a and b), the LO mode in the dia-Si structure originates from the vibrational movement along the sp3 hybridization direction, and in the fvs-Si48 structure, it originates from the 24d1 silicon atoms in the three-membered ring, which has higher energy than the typical tetrahedron silicon atoms, and different from the dia-Si; it is noted that in the fvs-Si48 structure, there is a direct band gap of phonons between frequencies 14.6 THz and 16 THz at the Γ point. To verify the thermal stability, the ab initio MD simulation is performed to calculate the change in the potential energy in NVT at 500 K and 1000 K. The time step is set as 1 fs, and the total potential energy is averaged in every picosecond as shown in Fig. 4. The potential energy fluctuated in a converge way at 500 K, illustrating the stability of the fvs-Si48 structure. However, when the temperature increases up to 1000 K, the energy fluctuates more significantly indicating weak stability at high temperature.

Density of states analysis
The band gap is a critical parameter for functional materials in photovoltaic devices because the conversion efficiency from sunlight into electrical power is closely dependent on light absorption. Therefore, we calculated the electronic band structures of fsv-Si48 with the PBE function. The band gaps of different structures are listed in Table 1. Within the PBE function, our calculation indicates that the band gap of fvs-Si48 is direct, whose maximum bound of the valence band and minimum bound of the conduction band are located at the G point in the Brillouin zone. The direct band gap of fvs-Si48 is 2.15 eV, which is larger than that of dia-Si, tI16-Si, mC12-Si, and Si20-T. Fig. 5(a) shows the G0W0-corrected band structure with Projected Density of States (PDOS), with contributions from s and p orbitals. The 3P components are more dominating than the 3S states, the typical sp3 hybridization type as in dia-Si is broken in fvs-Si48, with the 3S and average 3P orbital splitting at 30 meV, respectively, and the 3P orbitals occupy the valence and conduction band edges near the Fermi level. Fig. 5(b) shows the absorption spectrum by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE),9 and the first absorption peak lies at 2.13 eV, indicating a 20 meV exciton binding energy, slightly larger than that of dia-Si (14 meV). The exciton lifetime can be calculated as39 (1)where e, me, p, c, and n are the charge and rest mass of electrons, the Planck constant divided by 2π, the light speed, and the refractive index (hereafter n = 13 for silicon). Taking the environment dielectric constant ε to be 3.2, and using the calculated absorption energy Ea and the corresponding oscillator strengths (f), we estimate that the radiative lifetime is longer than 10 s, which is longer than that of the diamond silicon.40 More robust optical performance can be expected compared with the dia-Si structure.

XRD analysis
To collect more characteristic information of the fvs-Si48 structure for the potential possible experimental indentation, we also simulate the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of dia-Si and fvs-Si48 with a copper K-α wavelength of 1.54 Å. The simulated XRD spectra are shown in Fig. 5 with selected typical peaks as presented. The peaks can be observed as [111] at 2θ = 14.5° that has the strongest intensity, [210] at 18.8°, [220] at 23.8°, and [311] at 28.0°. Compared with dia-Si and the oC24-Si structure, there is a distinct pattern between the fvs-Si48 and dia-Si phases, the [111] peak of the fvs-Si48 and the [220] peak of the oC24-Si are very similar, and these two phases can be well separated from the [440] peak around 50° in the oC24-Si phase. These features may be useful for identifying the new fvs-Si48 structure in the experiment (Fig. 6).

Summary
In summary, in this work, using the property-selected genetic algorithm, we have predicted a direct bandgap silicon allotrope named fvs-Si48, which has the cubic space group Pa with a lattice constant of 10.56 Å and investigated the electronic and optical properties using ab initio DFT calculations with many-body corrections. This new structure is composed of a six-membered ring, a five-membered ring and a three-membered ring with a mass density of 1.86 g cm−3, and the mechanical and kinetic stability is checked well via elastic moduli and phonon calculations, and the calculation of its electronic properties shows that it has a direct band gap of 2.15 eV and an exciton binding energy of 20 meV, similar to that of dia-Si. The XRD pattern shows the unique features compared with the two experimental silicon phases. Due to the direct bandgap type of the fvs-Si48 structure, it will have a wide range of applications in photocatalysis, adsorption, hydrogen storage, and aerospace materials.
