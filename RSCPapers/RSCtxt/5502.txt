1. Introduction
TiO2 nanomaterials have attracted tremendous interest due to their main applications in photocatalytic hydrogen generation and environmental pollution removal.1–10 There are three main crystal phases for TiO2: anatase, rutile and brookite,9 and many other minor phases such as monoclinic TiO2 (B).10–12 All of them have large electronic bandgaps of 3.0–3.2 eV.9–14 This limits their optical absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the solar spectrum. This part, however, only accounts for less than 5% of the entire solar energy.15 Even if TiO2 is very efficient in utilizing the UV light, its overall solar activity is thus very limited. The photocatalytic activity depends on the amount of working electrons and holes on the surface of the photocatalyst for the reaction. In the photocatalytic process, TiO2 absorbs light with energy larger than its bandgap and produces excited electrons in the conduction band and excited holes in the valence band.7,14 These excited charges may separate from each other and migrate to the surface to perform photocatalytic reactions. During the charge separation and migration processes, some of the excited charges may recombine and disappear. Nevertheless, the amount of excited charges on the surface is generated from the absorption process. The more light TiO2 can absorb, the more excited charges are likely to be on the surface. Therefore, it has become a common sense to improve the optical absorption properties of TiO2 in order to enhance its overall activity.
During the past few decades, much effort has been devoted to making TiO2 colorful for better optical absorption through metal or non-metal doping. For example, a series of metal ions have been used to replace the Ti4+ ions in the TiO2 lattice to bring about visible-light absorption since the early 1990s,16–39 non-metal elements have been adopted to replace the O2− ions in the TiO2 lattice since 2001,40–66 and metal and non-metal elements have been combined to replace partial Ti4+ and O2− ions in the TiO2 lattice recently.67–74 All these efforts have brought about the absorption of TiO2 into the visible-light region and improved photocatalytic activity has been frequently reported.
Thermodynamically, the water splitting potential is only 1.23 V. So in the ideal case for photocatalytic water splitting, the bandgap of a semiconductor should be around 1.23 eV, assuming that the overpotentials for the oxygen and hydrogen evolutions are successfully removed and the electronic structures of the semiconductor align perfectly with the water redox potentials. This bandgap corresponds to 1000 nm in wavelength. So, ideally, the color of TiO2 should be tuned to black, with an energy gap of 1.23 eV and optical absorption near 1000 nm in the near infrared region. In 2011, hydrogenation has been reported as an effective approach in shifting the bandgap of TiO2 to around 1.5 eV with an optical onset around 1.0 eV and color of black.75 Unsurprisingly, this discovery has triggered world-wide research interest in black TiO2 nanomaterials.76–78 Indeed, it is well known that heating TiO2 under vacuum or in a reducing atmosphere leads to color changes.6 Ti3+ or/and oxygen vacancies turn white TiO2 into yellow, blue or black material.6
Here we would like to summarize the recent research progress on the black TiO2 nanomaterials. Specifically, in this review, we focus on the formation of black TiO2 nanoparticles. Traditional reduction treatments of TiO2 bulk crystals or surfaces and those that lead to apparent phase transformations are not reviewed here. If a material absorbs 100% light across the whole visible-light, it shows a completely black color. If only certain percentage across the entire visible-light region is equally absorbed, it is partially black or gray. If no light is absorbed across the entire visible-light region, the color is white. If the light across the entire visible-light region is not equally absorbed, certain color (e.g., yellow, brown, green) will be observed. In this review, we focus only on the recent synthesis of black or partially black TiO2 nanomaterials, especially on their detailed synthetic conditions, as these conditions strongly affect the properties and performance of the obtained TiO2 nanomaterials. Those studies introducing other elements into the lattice or surface of TiO2 to obtain black color will not be reviewed. Then we briefly summarize their chemical and structural properties and various applications. Although the change in optical absorption properties is the one main reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activities, however, this does not mean that the color change plays the same role for all applications, such as in batteries, supercapacitors, and catalytic reaction of ethylene to polyethylene (new application of TiO2 nanoparticles). Nevertheless, we hope this review will inspire more advancements in this area in the future.
2. Synthesis of black TiO2 nanomaterials
2.1 Hydrogen thermal treatment
Intuition tells us that hydrogen thermal treatment of TiO2 nanocrystals is simple and straightforward as hydrogen will reduce TiO2 into other chemical species where Ti4+ should become Ti3+ or other reduction states, and their lattice structure and other physical/chemical properties change accordingly. However, this reaction seems not as simple as we thought. (1) As seen from this reaction scheme (1), the amount of reactants, the chemical properties of the starting TiO2 nanomaterials, the pressure and concentration of the hydrogen gas, the reaction temperature and the reaction time will possibly play roles in the final compound of this reaction. The reaction pathways and thus the final properties of the hydrogen treated TiO2 nanomaterials will be different depending on the hydrogen treatment conditions. The chemical properties of nanomaterials are also affected by their size, shape, morphology, surface facet, and defect content.79–81 These variables make this reaction even more complicated. Experimentally, black TiO2 nanomaterials reported in the literature are normally prepared from different groups under different conditions. It is thus reasonable to see variations of their properties and performance and the accompanying explanations. These variations and complexities, on the other hand, also provide us a large extent of flexibility and many opportunities in tuning the chemical/physical properties and performance of black TiO2 nanomaterials towards our different needs.
Interaction of hydrogen with TiO2 crystals and surfaces has been studied for a long time.82–97 For examples, in 1951, Cronemeyer and Gilleo found that hydrogen reduced rutile single-crystals had long wavelength absorption,82 and in 1958, Cronemeyer found that rutile single-crystals reduced with hydrogen at 700 °C had the increased electrical conductivity due to the ionization trapped electrons in oxygen vacancies.85 Hasiguti et al. suggested that the electrical conductivity were mostly Ti interstitial defects.94,95 Sekiya et al. found that the color of TiO2 changed to pale blue or dark blue when annealed in hydrogen, due to the absorption bands from the oxygen vacancy defect states below the fundamental absorption edge.97 While TiO2 surfaces were found not to strongly interact with molecular hydrogen,88 additional emission peaks in the valence band region were observed with high doses of H2 even at room temperature,87 and atomic hydrogen stick to TiO2(110) surfaces at room temperature.90 Reduction occurred when a TiO2 surface was annealed in a H2 atmosphere under high vacuum conditions.89,92 In the following, we will focus on recent studies on the formation of black TiO2 nanoparticles.

2.1.1 High-pressure pure hydrogen treatment. 
Chen et al. reported the preparation of black TiO2 nanoparticles by treating pure white TiO2 nanoparticles under a 20.0-bar pure H2 atmosphere at about 200 °C for 5 days.75 The pure TiO2 nanocrystals were obtained by heating the mixture of titanium tetraisopropoxide, Pluronic F127, hydrochloric acid, deionized water, and ethanol, with the molar ratio of 1:0.005:0.5:15:40 at 40 °C for 24 hours, followed by drying at 110 °C for 24 hours and calcinating at 500 °C for 6 hours.75Fig. 1 shows the schematic illustration of the concept of making black TiO2 nanomaterials (Fig. 1A), along with the pictures (Fig. 1B) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1C and D) of white and black TiO2 nanoparticles.75 Black TiO2 nanoparticles featured with a well-crystallized lattice core surrounded by a lattice-disordered shell from the hydrogenation treatment.75,95–97 The disordered shell was believed to host the possible hydrogen dopant, form the Ti–H and O–H bonds, and contributed to the midgap states and the black color of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles.75,95–97 The black hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles had an onset of optical absorption of about 1.0 eV (∼1200 nm) and an optical gap of around 1.54 eV (806.8 nm) from the UV-visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 1E).75

Sun et al. made black TiO2 nanoparticles and investigated the hydrogen incorporation into facet-defined anatase TiO2 nanocrystals under high pressure.101 They found that hydrogenated TiO2-(101) and TiO2-(001) nanocrystals were black (Fig. 2A) and blue (Fig. 2B), respectively.101 The amount of hydrogen stored in TiO2 nanocrystals depended on their facets.101 Under an initial hydrogen pressure of 7.0 MP at 450 °C, TiO2 nanocrystals with a predominant (101) surface had a storage capacity of 1.4 wt% (Fig. 2A), while TiO2 nanocrystals with (001) surface terminations had a storage capacity of 1.0 wt% (Fig. 2B).101 Hydrogen occupied the interstitial sites between titanium–oxygen octahedra in the lattice and the energy barrier for hydrogen incorporation was lower through the anatase(101) surface than that through (001) (Fig. 2C and D).101

Lu et al. prepared black TiO2 nanoparticles at room temperature in a high-pressure H2 environment and studied the color change of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles over time.102 The hydrogenation reaction was conducted by hydrogenating commercial P25 TiO2 powders (0.5 g) under 35 bar hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature (about 15 °C) for 0–20 days.102 The color of the white P25 turned into pale yellow after hydrogenation for 3 days' hydrogenation.102 Its color became much darker with a longer hydrogenation time and turned gray after treatment for 15 days.102 Black TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained after hydrogenation for more than 15 days.102 The black TiO2 has a crystalline disordered core–shell structure.102 The corresponding visual and optical absorption property changes are shown in Fig. 3.102 The onset of the optical absorption of the black TiO2 nanoparticle was about 1.0 eV and an abrupt bandgap absorbance occurred at about 1.82 eV (680 nm).102

Liu et al. compared the color change of anatase TiO2 nanotubes hydrogenated under various conditions: (i) an anatase TiO2 nanotube layer (air); (ii) this layer converted with Ar (Ar) or H2–Ar (H2–Ar); (iii) a high pressure H2 treatment (20 bar, 500 °C for 1 h) (HP-H2); and (iv) a high pressure H2 treatment but mild heating (H2, 20 bar, 200 °C for 5 d).103 After the reduction treatments, the color of the TiO2 nanotubes turned from white into black in H2–Ar, deep purple in pure Ar (500 °C for 1 h), light blue in pressurized H2 at high temperature (20 bar, 500 °C for 1 h), and gray in pressurized H2 at mild temperature (H2, 20 bar, 200 °C for 5 d), as shown in Fig. 4, which also displays their UV-visible absorption spectra.103 Apparently, the hydrogenation condition played a critical role in the final color and optical properties of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes.103 The original TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by anodizing a Ti foil with a Pt counter electrode in ethylene glycol with addition H2O (1 M) and NH4F (0.1 M) at 60 V for 15 min, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 1 h.103

Qiu et al. prepared blue hydrogenated rutile TiO2 nanoparticles by heating rutile TiO2 nanoparticles (40 nm) under 40 bar hydrogen pressure at 450 °C for 1 h.104 The white rutile TiO2 nanoparticles turned into blue color after 5 min of hydrogenation.104 Its blue color became more intense with increased reaction time and subsequently steady after 30 min of the reaction.104 The blue color changed into gray after the hydrogenated rutile TiO2 nanoparticles were exposed to the air.104 Qiu et al. also fabricated blue hydrogenated lithium titanate by treating lithium titanate at 500 °C for 1 h under a 40 bar H2 atmosphere.105 The blue color of the hydrogenated lithium titanate was stable in air.105
Wang et al. studied the hydrogenation of F and N–F doped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles dominated with {001} facets.106–108 The hydrogenation was performed at 400 °C for 2 h under 10 bar pure H2 atmosphere to create hydrogenated F and N–F doped TiO2 (TiO2-HF and TiO2-NHF).108 The F doped TiO2 (TiO2-F) were prepared by reacting Ti(OBu)4 (25 mL) with HF (6 mL) and water (9 mL) at 180 °C for 24 h in an autoclave.108 The N dopant was introduced by reacting with urea at 400 °C for 2 h in air to obtain N–F doped TiO2 (TiO2-NF).108 As shown in Fig. 5, the colors of TiO2-F, TiO2-NF, TiO2-HF, and TiO2-NHF were white, yellow, blue and brown color, respectively.108 TiO2-F only showed absorption in the UV region, TiO2-NF had an onset of absorption at around 590 nm, TiO2-HF showed increased visible-light absorption from 500 nm to 1000 nm, and TiO2-NHF had a small and flat visible-light absorption from 400 nm to 1000 nm.108

Leshuk et al. conducted hydrogenation under a 300 ± 5 psig pure H2 gas environment at 200 °C for 5 days or under a 10% H2 + 90% Ar gas flow at 400–500 °C for 24–102 h on various TiO2 nanomaterials.109,110 They found that under both hydrogen gas environments the color of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanomaterials changed to yellow or black, depending on how the original TiO2 nanomaterials were prepared.110


2.1.2 Ambient or low-pressure pure hydrogen treatment. 
Rekoske et al. reported that reduction of anatase and rutile TiO2 with H2 at 300–500 °C under ambient hydrogen pressure, however, they did not mention the optical properties.111 In 2003, Liu et al. treated anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (30 nm in diameter) under pure H2 flow with a general grade from 20 to 700 °C for 2 h, however, no report was available on the optical and color property changes.112 Yu et al. performed hydrogenation on anatase TiO2 nanosheets under a H2 gas flow (50 sccm) at atmospheric pressure in a quartz tube at 500–700 °C for various time.113 The TiO2 nanosheets were prepared by treating tetrabutyl titanate (25 g) with HF (4 mL) at 200 °C for 24 h.113 The color of the nanosheets changed from white to blue, then finally to gray, depending on the hydrogenation temperature and time, as shown in Fig. 6A.113Fig. 6B shows their corresponding UV-visible absorption spectra.113

Li et al. prepared hydrogenated mesoporous anatase TiO2 microspheres via a hydrogenation treatment process.114 The hydrogen thermal treatment was performed by calcining the TiO2 microspheres under ambient hydrogen pressure at 400 °C for 1 h.114 The color of the TiO2 microspheres changed to gray from white after hydrogenation and the hydrogenated TiO2 microspheres exhibited a high and broad light absorption band towards the infrared region in contrast to the UV absorption of the original TiO2 microspheres from the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra.114 Lu et al. performed the hydrogenation on anodized TiO2 nanotubes in an ultrahigh purity hydrogen atmosphere (ambient pressure) between 300 to 600 °C for 1 h.115 However, no information on the color or optical properties was available for the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes.115 The TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by anodizing Ti fiber at 30 V for 3 h at room temperature with a graphite rod as a cathode in a glycerol aqueous solution (90 vol% glycerol: 10 vol% H2O) containing 0.75% NH4F, followed by drying at 80 °C.115 Similarly, Li et al. prepared hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes (mainly rutile, 95%) via the anodization of a titanium sheet followed by a hydrogenation process conducted at 450 °C for 2 h in a hydrogen atmosphere (ambient pressure).116 The TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by anodizing a Ti foil in 1,2,3-propanetriol containing NH4F (1.0 wt%) and H2O (15 vol%) at 25 V for 2 h with a platinum mesh as a cathode, followed by heating at 700 °C for 1 h.116 Zhang et al. fabricated hydrogenated anatase TiO2 nanotubes by annealing the anatase TiO2 nanotubes in a ultrahigh purity H2 atmosphere at 200–600 °C for 1 h.117 The anatase TiO2 nanotubes were synthesized by anodizing a Ti sheet at 50 V for 3 h at room temperature in glycol aqueous solution (90 wt% glycerol: 10 wt% H2O) containing NH4F (0.5 wt%).117
Wang et al. prepared hydrogenated rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays by annealing in an ultrahigh purity hydrogen atmosphere (ambient pressure) for 3 h at 200–550 °C.118 The color of the hydrogenated rutile TiO2 nanowires turned into yellowish green (350 °C) and black (450 °C or above), depending on the hydrogen annealing temperature (Fig. 7).118 This suggested that the hydrogenated rutile TiO2 nanowires had visible light absorption as a result of hydrogen treatment.118 The original rutile TiO2 nanowires were obtained by treating titanium n-butoxide (0.5 mL) in HCl (18.25%) solution at 150 °C for 5 hours, followed by annealing in air at 550 °C for 3 h.118

Naldoni et al. prepared black TiO2 nanoparticles by heating amorphous TiO2 under H2 stream, followed by fast cooling in an inert environment until room temperature.119 They treated amorphous TiO2 powders under vacuum (10−5 mbar) and then heated at 200 °C for 1 h under flowing O2, and then heated 500 °C for 1 h under a hydrogen atmosphere.119 They found that the use of very slow cooling rate or instantaneous exposure to air resulted in a gray coloration, and that reducing crystalline samples generated only pale blue colored powders with unmodified absorption spectra.119
Barzan et al. conducted the hydrogenation reaction on P25 under a pure hydrogen atmosphere (pressure of 200 mbar) at 500 °C for 1 h and obtained TiO2 with blue color.120 Jiang et al. performed hydrogenation on commercial P25 powders in a tube furnace filled with ultrahigh purity hydrogen gas (99.99%) under atmospheric pressure at 400 °C for 10 h and found that the color of P25 turned into gray.121 Liang et al. reported the hydrogenation of an anatase TiO2 inverse opal structure.122 The hydrogenation reaction was conducted at 500 °C for 2 h under a reduced hydrogen pressure of 80 Torr.122 However, no information of the optical properties of the hydrogenated TiO2 was readily available.122


2.1.3 Ambient hydrogen–argon treatment. 
Shin et al. prepared hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles from commercial anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (50 nm in diameter).123 The hydrogenation reaction was conducted at 450 °C for 1–7 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar gas flow.123 They found that the color of pristine TiO2 changed from pure white (Fig. 8A) to light yellowish after 1 h of hydrogen thermal treatment and after 7 h of hydrogen thermal treatment, the color turned to dark yellow (Fig. 8B).123 No color change was visible after the same time of thermal annealing under an inert atmosphere.123

Zhu et al. conducted hydrogenation on anatase TiO2 nanotubes in a quartz tube under a continuous hydrogen (8 sccm) and argon (10 sccm) flux for 5 h at 400–600 °C.124 The anatase TiO2 nanotubes were obtained from anodization of Ti foil in an ethylene glycol solution containing NH4F (0.25 wt%) and HF (0.02 wt%) at 40 V at room temperature for 40 min.124 However, no information on the optical properties was provided in this study.124 Lu et al. reported hydrogenation on anatase nanoparticles, anatase nanotubes and rutile nanorods.125 The hydrogenation was carried out by annealing various TiO2 nanomaterials at 450 °C for 1 h in a reducing 5% H2 and 95% Ar atmosphere (100 sccm flow rate).125 The hydrogenated TiO2 nanomaterials turned into black from white (Fig. 9).125 The original TiO2 nanotubes were prepared by anodizing Ti foil in ethylene glycol with 0.5 wt% ammonium fluoride and 4–6 vol% water at a constant potential of 60 V for 0.5 h, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 3 h.125 The starting rutile TiO2 nanorods were made by heating titanium n-butoxide (0.5 mL) in HCl (18.25%) solution at 150 °C for 5 hours, followed by annealing in air at 550 °C for 3 h.125 The anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were bought from Aldrich with a grain size of 50 nm (Fig. 9).125

Zhang et al. prepared hydrogenated rutile TiO2 nanorods by treating rutile TiO2 nanorods in a H2–Ar flow.128 The hydrogenation process was carried out in a hydrogen (20 sccm) and argon (80 sccm) atmosphere at 350 °C in a tubular furnace under ambient pressure for 1 h.128 The starting TiO2 nanorods were prepared on a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass slide by reacting titanium butoxide (0.48 mL) in HCl solution (40 mL 18.25 wt%) at 170 °C for 6 h.128 The hydrogenated TiO2 nanorods had a stronger absorbance in the visible light region (ca. 50%) than and a slight enhancement in the UV light region (ca. 4%), compared to pristine TiO2 nanorods.128
Zeng et al. carried out hydrogenation on pure and C-doped TiO2 nanoparticles under a flow of H2–Ar mixture at 300 °C for 2 h,129 however, did not report on their optical properties. Wang et al. synthesized a hydrogenated TiO2–reduced-graphene oxide nanocomposite.130 Typically, tetrabutyl titanate was added into ethanol containing graphene oxide and reacted at 90 °C for 8 h.130 The powder was treated at 450 °C for 4 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar flow.130
Hoang et al. prepared N,H-doped rutile TiO2 nanowires via hydrothermal synthesis followed by hydrogenation treatment.131 The rutile TiO2 nanowires were prepared in 50 mL n-hexane, 5 mL HCl, and 5 mL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide at 150 °C for 5 h on seeded fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates.131 The nanowires were annealed at 500 °C (i) in air for 1 h (denoted as TiO2), (ii) in NH3 for 2 h (N-TiO2), (iii) in a mixture of H2 and Ar (5% of H2) for 1 h (H-TiO2), and (iv) in a mixture of H2 and Ar for 1 h followed by annealing in NH3 for 2 h (H,N-TiO2).131 As shown in Fig. 11, the color of the pristine TiO2 nanowires did not change after hydrogen treatment; however, it turned green after nitridation and dark green after hydrogenation–nitridation treatment.131 The hydrogenated TiO2 nanowires increased absorption in both UV and visible light regions compared to the pristine TiO2 nanowires, and the absorption edge of the H,N-TiO2 nanowires shifted ∼20 nm to the longer wavelength region compared to the N-doped TiO2 nanowires.131

Wang et al. conducted hydrogen treatment on rutile TiO2 nanorods with anatase nanoparticles.133 The hydrogenation reaction was conducted at 400 °C for 30 minutes in a mixed gas of 90% N2 and 10% H2.133 The color of the film changed from white to gray after annealing.133 The TiO2 nanorods were prepared by heating 1.5 mL mixed solution of hydrochloric acid (47.2 vol%), deionized water (51.5 vol%), and tetrabutyl titanate (1.3 vol%) in an autoclave at 150 °C for 10 h, followed by heating at 450 °C for 30 minutes.133 The anatase nanoparticles were then loaded in a 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 12 h in an autoclave.133 Zheng et al. hydrogenated anatase TiO2 nanowire microspheres at 500 °C for 4 h under a flow of H2 (5% in N2, 300 sccm).134 The color of the hydrogenated anatase TiO2 nanowire microspheres was dark brown compared to the white color of the pristine microspheres, and had enhanced visible-light absorption.134 The nanowire-microspheres were obtained by heating Ti(OBu)4 (5.1 g) in ethanol (75 mL) with sulfuric acid (0.33 mL, 98%) and water (0.3 mL) at 180 °C for 4 h in an autoclave, followed by heating at 150 °C for 24 h in 10 M NaOH aqueous solutions and ion-exchanged in 0.1 M HCl aqueous solution for 12 h.134

Myung et al. prepared black TiO2 nanoparticles by annealing a yellow TiO2 gel in Ar gas at 400–600 °C for 5 h.136 The TiO2 gel was obtained by stirring high-purity TiCl4 dropwise to a distilled water–ethanol mixture with HF and urea at 0 °C for 4 h, and then evaporating the solution slowly at 80 °C.136 The color of the annealed TiO2 nanoparticles depended on the annealing temperature and the amount of HF added in the preparation of the TiO2 gel.136

2.2 Hydrogen plasma
Wang et al. prepared hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles in a thermal plasma furnace by hydrogen plasma for 4–8 h at 500 °C.137 The plasma input power was 200 W and the starting TiO2 was P25.137 The hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles had a significant absorption in the visible and near infrared light (Fig. 14).137 Their absorption in the visible and infrared light region increased drastically and monotonously with wavelengths longer than 400 nm.137 Teng et al. prepared black TiO2 nanotubes by hydrogen plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition.138 The hydrogenation was performed in a hot-filament chemical vapor deposition apparatus with hydrogen as reaction gas (Fig. 15A).138 The TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by heating 2 g of Degussa P25 nanoparticles (2 g) in 10 M NaOH solution (50 mL) at 120 °C for 12 h, followed by washing with HCl and water, and drying at 110 °C.138 During the treatment process, the TiO2 was loaded in a corundum boat under the filament.138 The temperature of the filament was maintained at 2000 °C, and the samples were treated for 3 h at 350–500 °C (TiO2-350, TiO2-500).138 Some Cr fragments were mixed in the TiO2 during the treatment process to study the effect of Cr (TiO2-Cr-350, TiO2-Cr-500).138 All the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles had black color (Fig. 15B) and enhanced absorption in the visible-light region (Fig. 15C).138 Yan et al. also prepared hydrogenated black anatase TiO2 nanoparticles by a H2 plasma treatment.139 The H2 plasma treatment was performed at 390 °C for 3 h, with the inductively coupled plasma power of 3000 W, the chamber pressure of 26.5–28.3 mTorr, and the H2 flow rate of 50 sccm.

Cui et al. prepared black anatase TiO2 nanotubes by the melted aluminum reduction of pristine anodized and air-annealed TiO2 nanotube arrays.141 In the reduction process, TiO2 nanotubes and aluminum powder were heated to 500 °C and 850 °C for 4 h, respectively.141 The TiO2 nanotubes were prepared by anodizing a Ti foil with a copper plate as the cathode in a glycol electrolyte containing 0.4 wt% NH4F and 3 wt% H2O under 100 V for 5 min, after peeling off the first layer obtained under 100 V for 25 min and followed by annealing at 500 °C for 4 h in air.141 The black anatase TiO2 nanotubes had large absorption from visible-light to near-infrared regions.141
Yin et al. prepared gray anatase TiO2 nanowires by treating protonated titanate nanowires (0.5 g) under vacuum at 200–900 °C for 4 h in a two-zone furnace under an Al atmosphere where aluminum powder was put in the zone set at 800 °C.142 The protonated titanate nanowires were prepared with a hydrothermal reaction of anatase powder in 10 M NaOH solution at 200 °C for 18 h.142 The gray nanowires exhibited stable visible-light and even infrared light absorption.142
Similarly, Zhu et al. synthesized black brookite TiO2 nanoparticles in a two-zone vacuum furnace with the Al reduction method.143 The Al powders and brookite TiO2 were separately heated at 800 °C (Al) and 300–600 °C (brookite) for 4 h in a two-zone evacuated furnace under a pressure of 0.5 Pa.143 The brookite TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by heating at 220 °C for 48 h under pH 12.5 the precipitates from the reaction of TiOSO4·xH2O (3 g) and 10 M NaOH (6.25 mL) in water (50 mL).143 The black brookite TiO2 drastically enhanced visible and infrared light absorption.143
Yang et al. synthesized black core–shell rutile TiO2 nanoparticles with sulfided surface (TiO2−x:S) from both anatase and rutile nanoparticles.144 Rutile (route 1) and anatase (route 2) TiO2 with sizes of ∼30 nm in diameter were first reduced by molten Al to form a disordered TiO2−x shell (Fig. 17A).144 The Al powders and pristine TiO2 were separately heated at 800 °C (molten Al) and 500 °C (TiO2) for 6 h in an evacuated two-zone furnace under 5 × 10−4 Pa pressure.144 The modified TiO2 nanoparticles were treated at 600 °C for 4 h in a 1000 Pa H2S.144 This sulfided rutile TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited remarkably enhanced absorption in visible and near-infrared regions (Fig. 17B and C).144 The color of the sulfided rutile TiO2 nanoparticles was brown or black, depending on the crystal phase of the starting TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 17C).144 The black color changed into gray after annealing.144

Lin et al. further synthesized a series of nonmetal-doped black titania with this two-step strategy (Fig. 18).145 First, reduction by molten Al introduced oxygen vacancies on the amorphous surface layer surrounding the crystalline core in TiO2 (Degussa P25) nanocrystals.145 Then incorporation of the nonmetal element X (X = H, N, S, I) in the oxygen-deficient amorphous layers of Al-reduced titania nanocrystals (TiO2−x) induced color change.145 The P25 (0.5 g) and aluminum powders were treated at 500 °C and 800 °C for 6 h, respectively, in a two-zone evacuated furnace, under the pressure of 0.5 Pa, to obtain black TiO2−x nanoparticles.145 The hydrogenation was then performed in a thermal plasma furnace by hydrogen plasma at 500 °C for 4 h.145 The TiO2–S and TiO2–I were prepared by reacting black TiO2−x nanoparticles with S and I2 at 500 °C for 4 h, respectively, followed by dispersed in CS2 (ethanol for I2) solution to remove residual S (I2) to obtain TiO2–S (TiO2–I) nanoparticles.145 The black TiO2–N nanoparticles were obtained by heating black TiO2−x nanoparticles in a NH3–Ar (2:1) gas flow at atmospheric pressure at 500 °C for 4 h.145 All the TiO2–X nanoparticles displayed enhanced absorption in both visible-light and near-infrared regions.145 The amount of light absorbed followed this order: TiO2–N > TiO2–S > TiO2–I > TiO2−x > TiO2–H > TiO2.145

2.3.3 Imidazole reduction. 
Zou et al. prepared reduced gray TiO2 nanoparticles by calcining a mixture of a porous amorphous TiO2 precursor (0.5 g), imidazole (1 g), and hydrochloric acid (37 wt%, 3 mL) in a preheated muffle furnace (450 °C) for 6 h.147 The amorphous TiO2 precursor was obtained by photodecomposing titanium glycolate (2.0 g) dispersed in water (60 mL) under UV-light irradiation (for 1 h).147 The reduced TiO2 had a broad and strong absorption through the entire visible-light region.147


2.3.4 NaBH4 reduction. 
Kang et al. synthesized reduced black TiO2 nanotubes by chemical reduction with NaBH4.148 The starting TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by anodizing a Ti foil in an ethylene glycol solution containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% H2O under 80 V for 30 min at 5 °C with a graphite cathode, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 3 h.148 The reduction was performed in 0.1 M NaBH4 solution for 10–60 min at room temperature.148 The reduced TiO2 nanotubes had strong absorption from the visible-light region to the near-infrared.148


2.3.5 CaH2 reduction. 
Tominaka et al. found that black corundum Ti2O3 nanoparticles were obtained by reduction of rutile TiO2 nanoparticles with CaH2 powder at 350 °C for 10–15 d with the same morphology.149,150

2.4 Chemical oxidation
Liu et al. prepared reduced TiO2−x nanoparticles by a hydrothermal method by oxidizing TiH2 powder (0.60 g) in H2O2 solution (60 mL 25 wt%) at 160 °C for 20–27 h after stirring for 5 h at room temperature.151 The TiO2 nanoparticles had blue or light-blue color.151 The particles showed a strong absorption across the UV to the visible light region and retained their light-blue color upon storage in ambient atmosphere or water for one month at 40 °C.151 Grabstanowicz et al. prepared TiO2 black powders with a two-step strategy as shown in Fig. 20.152 First, H2O2 (15 mL) was added into TiH2 powders (0.96 g) aqueous suspension (10 mL) and stirred for 3 h at room temperature to obtain a miscible gel-like slurry, followed by additional H2O2 (12 mL and 15 mL) and stirring (4 h and 16 h) in forming a yellow gel.152 Second, the gel was vacuum-desiccated overnight, placed in an oven at 100 °C for 12–20 h to become a yellow powder, and then finally at 630 °C for 3 h in Ar.152 The black TiO2 had a rutile phase and remarkably enhanced absorption in the visible-light and near-infrared regions.152 Pei et al. prepared gray TiO2 by oxidizing TiO powder with a hydrothermal method.153 In a typical procedure, titanium monoxide (400 mg) was reacted with HCl solution (20 mL 3 M) at 160 °C for 24 h.153 The formed gray TiO2 showed enhanced and stable absorption across the entire visible-light region.153 Kako et al. prepared colorful rutile TiO2 by heating Ti2O3 at 550–900 °C for 3 h.154 The samples had colors ranging from grayish green to yellowish off-white and large visible-light absorption.154

2.5 Electrochemical reduction
Xu et al. prepared hydrogenated black TiO2 nanotubes by electrochemical reduction.155 The nanotubes were obtained by two-step anodization at 150 V for 1 h in ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 10 vol% H2O with a carbon rod as the cathode and Ti as the anode.155 The nanotubes formed after the first-step were removed with adhesive tape to the second anodization.155 The nanotubes after the second-step were treated at 150 °C for 3 h and at 450 °C for 5 h.155 The electrochemical reductive doping process was performed under 5 V for 5 to 40 s in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at room temperature with the nanotubes as the cathode and a Pt electrode as the anode, respectively.155 Zhang et al. fabricated black TiO2 nanotubes with a similar strategy.156 The TiO2 nanotubes were obtained by anodizing a Ti sheet at 60 V for 30 min in EG solution containing 0.5 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% H2O with a Pt counter electrode, followed by sonicating, another anodizing at 80 V for 5 min, and calcination at 450 °C for 1 h.156 The reduction was conducted under negative potential (0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in 1 M Na2SO4 for 30 min.156
Similarly, Li et al. prepared black TiO2 nanotubes using anodization followed by electrochemical reduction as illustrated in Fig. 21.157 TiO2 nanotubes were first prepared with a Pt gauze as the counter electrode and a Ti foil as the working anode under a constant voltage or current (typically, 80 V for 7200 s, or 4 mA for 5000 s) in an “aged” ethylene glycol solution under 60 V for 12 h with 0.2 M HF and 0.12 M H2O2.157 The nanotubes were treated at 450 °C in air for 4 h.157 The electrochemical reduction was conducted under 40 V for 200 s in an ethylene glycol solution containing 0.27 wt% NH4F after a brief activation treatment (typically, at 60 V for 30 s, or 4 V for 600 s).157 Zhou and Zhang adopted similar strategy in making black TiO2 nanotubes.158 The pristine nanotubes were made by anodizing Ti foil in a Ti–platinum two-electrode system under 20 V for 2 h as 25 °C in ethylene glycol containing 0.5 wt% NH4F and 10 wt% H2O, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 2 h.158 Zheng prepared black TiO2 films with a multipulse anodization method.159 The fabricated TiO2 films had tens of well-defined layers with long-range structural periodicity and photonic band gaps in the visible wavelengths.159 The color was electrically switchable between green and black.159

2.6 Anodization-annealing
Dong et al. prepared black TiO2 nanotubes by anodization followed by annealing as shown in Fig. 22.160 TiO2 nanotubes were first obtained after two 10 h anodizations on a Ti foil at 60 V in ethylene glycol containing 0.25 wt% NH4F and 2 vol% distilled water.160 The TiO2 nanotubes after the first anodization were removed before the second anodization.160 The anodized Ti foil was cleaned in ethanol and distilled water, dried at 150 °C, and then sintered at 450 °C for 1 h in ambient atmosphere.160 A layer of black TiO2 was obtained on the substrate after removing the top oxide layer.160

3. Properties of black TiO2 nanomaterials
Since the fabrication methods and conditions of black TiO2 nanomaterials in the literature vary from one another, it is commonly reported that the various black TiO2 nanomaterials displayed different chemical and physical properties, as briefly summarized in the following sections. Some of these properties, if not all, have been used to explain the black color of the reported TiO2 nanomaterials.
3.1 The existence of structural disorder near the surface
Disordered structural features have been reported near the surface of black TiO2 nanoparticles with a crystalline/disordered core–shell structure in some studies,75,98,99,102,106,119,121,134,137,140 however, different observation has also been reported.125 For examples, a disordered surface layer was observed surrounding the crystalline core by Chen et al. in the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles obtained under 20 bar at 200 °C,75,98,99 by Lu et al. in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals obtained by treating the commercial Degussa P25 under 35 bar hydrogen and room temperature up to 20 days,102 in the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanosheets by Wang and Xu,106 in hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals by Naldoni et al.,119 in black TiO2 nanoparticles by hydrogen plasma,137 and in black TiO2 nanocrystals obtained by reducing with aluminum by Wang et al.,140etc. Lattice contraction in the disordered layer was reported by some groups,98,99,106,119 however, a weak lattice expansion was also suggested by the hydrogenation treatment.114 On the other hand, Lu and Zhou et al. found that the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes had a very clear surface.125
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) has been commonly used to differentiate the disordered phase from the crystallaine phase in the black TiO2 nanoparticles.75,98,99,102,106,119,121,137,140 For example, Fig. 23 shows the HRTEM and line analysis of one normal white TiO2 nanoparticle in comparison with one black TiO2 nanoparticle.99 The white TiO2 nanoparticle displayed clearly-resolved and well-defined lattice fringes, even at the surface of the nanocrystal (Fig. 23a), and the distance between the adjacent lattice planes was typical for anatase (0.352 nm) and uniform throughout the whole nanocrystal (Fig. 23b).99 The black TiO2 nanoparticle had a crystalline-disordered core–shell structure (Fig. 23c),99 and a structural deviation from the standard crystalline anatase was readily seen at the outer layer, where the straight lattice line was bent at the edge of the nanoparticle, and the plane distance was no longer uniform (Fig. 23d).99 Sometimes, electron diffraction (ED) has also been used to identify the amorphous structure from the crystalline phase.161 The nanoparticles containing only a crystalline phase gave clear diffraction patterns made of diffraction dots or rings, but the nanoparticles having both crystalline and disordered phases produced cloudy diffraction patterns instead.161 Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM images is also a useful technique to reveal the crystalline and amorphous structures in black TiO2 nanoparticles.119

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a commonly used technique to analyze crystalline phase structures in black TiO2 nanoparticles;75,102,106,119 however, it is a bulk analysis technique and is only sensitive to the crystalline phase. In the XRD pattern, the diffraction peaks might shift to the higher diffraction angles in black TiO2 nanoparticles, suggesting the reduction of the interplanar distance of the crystalline phase.98,106 Raman spectroscopy has been used as a complimentary structural characterization to XRD for probing the amorphous or disordered structures in black TiO2 nanoparticles.75,106 In the Raman spectroscopy, the scattering peaks became much weaker in intensity,75,106,121,124,125 broader in width,102,110,119,124,129,134,136,140 shifted to higher wavenumbers,101,110,113,119,124,129,140,141 and additional small vibrational modes were observed in black TiO2 nanoparticles.75,121,134,147 Both XRD and Raman techniques provide the assemble information of the overall properties. Combining XRD with HRTEM, estimation of the volumes and percentages of disordered phase over the crystalline phase in black TiO2 nanoparticles has also been attempted.98
3.2 The existence of Ti3+ ions
Depending on the synthetic conditions of black TiO2 nanomaterials, Ti3+ ions can be observed or not seen experimentally. In some black TiO2 nanomaterials from hydrogen reduction or by hydrogen plasma, Ti3+ ions were not detected in hydrogenated black TiO2 nanocrystals with conventional X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),75,117–119 synchrotron X-ray absorption, emission and photoelectron spectroscopies,99 and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR).103,137,161,162 For example, Wang et al. suggested the absence of Ti3+ in the black hydrogenated TiO2 nanowires treated at 450 °C based on the almost identical Ti 2p XPS spectra of pure and hydrogenated TiO2 nanowires.118 However, in some reports, the existence of Ti3+ ions in the black TiO2 nanomaterials was found from hydrogen treatment,106,113,115,119,121,125 chemical reduction,141,142,146 chemical oxidation,141,152 and electrochemical reduction.155,160 For example, Ti3+ ions were detected with XPS in the black TiO2 nanotubes obtained by electrochemical reduction156 and from the oxidation of TiH2.152
3.3 The existence of oxygen vacancies
Oxygen vacancies have been constantly reported in black TiO2 nanomaterials with hydrogen thermal treatment,106,111,116,118,121,163,164 electrochemical reduction,152,165 chemical reduction142,143,147 and chemical oxidation.166 For example, oxygen vacancies were seen with ESR spectroscopy in the black TiO2 nanoparticles from Al reduction,142,143 in the black TiO2 nanotubes from thermal hydrogen treatment103,105 and electrochemical reduction.160 However, in some cases, oxygen vacancies were not observed. For example, no oxygen vacancy was detected with ESR in the black TiO2 nanoparticles prepared with thermal treatment in the studies by Xia et al.161,162
3.4 The existence of Ti–OH groups
In the black TiO2 nanomaterials treated with hydrogen, the OH content changed after the hydrogenation treatment. A shoulder peak of Ti–OH in the O 1s XPS spectrum was found in hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles treated at 200 °C for 5 d,75 in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanowires118 and in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes with ultrahigh purity H2 atmosphere at 200–600 °C for 1 h.115,117 However, no change of Ti–OH in the O 1s spectra was observed in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotube arrays treated at 450 °C for 1 h in a reducing 5% H2 and 95% Ar atmosphere,125 and a decreased OH signal was observed in the O 1s XPS spectrum, for the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles treated at 450 °C for 4 h under 5 bar H2.161,162
In the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanomaterials showed the intensity change of the OH vibrational band.99,106,125,134,137,161,162 More surface OH groups were observed on hydrogenated TiO2 nanosheets treated at 400 °C for 2 h under a 10 bar pure H2 atmosphere.106 Hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles treated by hydrogen plasma at 500 °C for 4–8 h displayed extra peaks at 3685, 3670, and 3645 cm−1 and at 3710 cm−1.137 In hydrogenated TiO2 microspheres treated at 500 °C for 4 h under a flow of H2 (5% in N2, 300 sccm), the intensity of the OH peak was much lower than pure TiO2.134 Less adsorbed water and/or hydroxyl groups were present in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes treated at 450 °C for 1 h in a reducing 5% H2 and 95% Ar atmosphere based on the weaker bands at 3446 and 1645 cm−1.125 A decreased O–H intensity was observed for hydrogenated black TiO2 treated at 200 °C for 5 d,99 and no OH absorption bands was found in hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals treated at 450 °C for 4 h under 5 bar H2.161,162
In the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, a higher peak at 5.5 ppm from bridging hydroxyl groups was observed in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals groups treated by hydrogen plasma at 500 °C for 4–8 h, and extra signals at 0.01 and 0.4 ppm from the internal and terminal hydroxyl.137 A slightly broader peak at chemical shift +5.7 ppm with two additional small and narrow peaks at chemical shifts −0.03 and 0.73 ppm was seen in the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanocrystals treated at 200 °C for 5 d.99 However, much smaller OH signals were found for the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals heated at 450 °C for 4 h under 5 bar H2.161,162
3.5 The existence of Ti–H groups
The appearance of Ti–H groups was sometimes reported in hydrogenated black TiO2 nanomaterials.106,117,134,137 A shoulder peak at around 457.3 eV in the Ti 2p XPS spectrum due to the surface Ti–H bonds was found in hydrogenated TiO2 nanowire microspheres treated at 500 °C for 4 h under a flow of H2 (5% in N2, 300 sccm)134 and in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals treated by hydrogen plasma at 500 °C for 4–8 h.137 Ti–H bonds were suggested to cover the surface of hydrogenated TiO2 nanosheets obtained at 400 °C for 2 h under a 10-bar pure H2 atmosphere.106 The formation of the Ti–H bond was also suggested from the diffraction peak at approximately 59.28° in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes treated in ultrahigh purity H2 atmosphere at 200–600 °C for 1 h.117
3.6 The modifications of the valence band edge
Shift in the valence band was sometimes observed in the black TiO2 nanomaterials.75,119,125,141,143,144,148,157,167 For example, a red shift of the valence band was observed from the valence-band XPS spectrum for the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles treated at 200 °C for 4 d under 20 bar H275 or heated at 500 °C for 1 h under a hydrogen atmosphere,119 in the black brookite TiO2 nanoparticles,143 rutile TiO2 nanoparticles,144 and TiO2 nanotubes141 prepared with the Al reduction method, in the black anatase TiO2 nanotubes by NaBH4 reduction,148 in the black TiO2 nanoparticles by electron beam treatment,167 in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes treated at 450 °C for 1 h in a reducing 5% H2 and 95% Ar125 and in the black TiO2 nanotubes electrochemically hydrogenated.157 Ti3+ ions were found to not contribute to extra bandgap states of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals,99 as when Ti3+ showed up, these midgap states disappeared.99 On the other hand, similar valence-band structures were seen for pure and hydrogenated TiO2 nanowires treated with ultrahigh purity hydrogen atmosphere (ambient pressure) at 200–550 °C for 3 h.118 Similar observations were reported on hydrogenated TiO2 nanosheets as well.106,137

Table 1 summarizes the various black TiO2 nanomaterials with a different method and their properties. It is clearly seen that the structural, optical, chemical and electronic properties largely depends on the preparation methods and conditions. Thus it is important in our practice to pay attention to the experimental procedures and details in order to obtain the desired properties that we are targeting.

3.7 Theoretical consideration of hydrogenated black TiO2 nanomaterials
First-principles calculations by Aschauer and Selloni suggested that hydrogen migration from the anatase(101) surface to subsurface sites had smaller kinetic barriers than desorption.170 The H adsorption energy at subsurface sites was about 0.4 eV smaller than at surface sites and was entropically favored.170 Atomic hydrogen was likely to diffuse into the subsurface and further into the bulk, especially at higher coverage.170 Subsurface vacancies were stable in reduced anatase and favorably accommodated hydrogen.170 Highly reduced anatase enhanced hydrogen incorporation in the bulk.170
Periodic density functional theory calculations by Raghunath et al. suggested that both H atoms and H2 molecules that migrated into the TiO2 near subsurface layer from the TiO2(101) surface were equally favorable.171 The dissociative adsorption of H2 on the surface was the controlling step for H migration.171 The presence of H atoms on the surface and inside the subsurface layer promoted both H and H2 penetration into the subsurface layer, and prevented the escape of the H2 from the cage.171 The H2 molecule inside a cage readily dissociated and formed 2HO-species exothermically, which further transformed into H2O and resulted in the formation of O-vacancies and surface disordering.171 The interstitial H, H2, and H2O brought in density of states within the TiO2 band gap and induced a shift of the band gap position notably towards the conduction band.171
In the study by Chen et al.,75 the H atoms were suggested to bond to O and Ti atoms.75 Two groups of midgap states were predicted at about 3.0 and 1.8 eV, with the higher-energy group made of Ti 3d orbitals, and the lower-energy group mixed of O 2p and Ti 3d orbitals.75 The hydrogen 1s orbital mainly passivated the dangling bonds and stabilized the lattice disorders, which contributed to the midgap states.75 In the DFT-PBE calculations by Lu et al., hydrogen atoms were chemically absorbed both on Ti5c and O2c atoms for (101), (001), and (100) surfaces by taking into account the synergistic effect of Ti–H and O–H bonds.168 The hydrogenation-induced lattice distortions on (101) and (100) surfaces of nanoparticles enhanced the intraband coupling within the valence band, while the (001) surface was not largely affected.168 The atoms not only induced the lattice disorders but also interacted strongly with the O 2p and Ti 3d states, resulting in a considerable contribution to the midgap states.168 The optical absorption was dramatically redshifted due to the midgap states and the photogenerated electron–hole separation was substantially promoted as a result of electron–hole flow between different facets of hydrogenated nanoparticles.168
Liu et al. later pointed out that hydrogenated black TiO2 required not only hydrogen passivation of Ti and O dangling bonds on the surface.100 The conduction band minimum (CBM) did not change upon the O distortion, redshifted upon the Ti-sublattice distortion; the valence band maximum (VBM) blueshifted in either case.100 The little effect of the O distortion upon CBM was attributed to the nature of Ti 3d orbital featured CBM.100 The lattice disorder was mainly due to the O distortion.100 Hydrogenation played an important role in reducing the distortion energy in raising the VBM.75,100 The CBM electrons were not sensitive to local lattice distortions nor to H bonding induced changes.100 The midgap states changed upon both lattice distortion and H bonding.100 The lattice distortion caused by H in bulk anatase was not most stable and might release hydrogen from the lattice even at room temperature.100
Pan et al. found that H-doping had different effects on the electronic properties of three TiO2 polymorphs – anatase, rutile, and brookite.169 Although the incorporation of hydrogen was important for n-type TiO2 formation, interstitial hydrogen caused bandgap narrowing, but substitutional hydrogen did not reduce bandgap of anatase.169 (H,N)-co-doping narrowed the bandgap of anatase and brookite TiO2, but had little effect on rutile TiO2.169 Based on density functional–pseudopotential calculations by Sotoudeh et al., O/Ti termination was the most stable surface on anatase(001) TiO2, the valence band comes from p-states of deep and surface O atoms and d-orbitals of surface Ti atoms, and the conduction band comes from the d-orbitals of deep Ti atoms.172 H doping injected electrons to the clean (001) surface, created an empty mid-gap state below the conduction band and removed the mid-gap state in the (001) surface with O vacancy.172
Deng et al. found that real-hydrogen–passivated (RH-passivated) passivation of the nanostructured semiconductors could either increase or decrease the band gap, depending on the ionicity of the nanocompounds.173 For anatase TiO2, occupied gap states from the Ti–H bond with H s and Ti s and d characters were created at about 0.7 eV above the host VBM and the effective band gap was reduced.173 The position of the occupied H-induced state (bonding cation-H state) near the VBM state was not affected much by the anion.173 The first-principle calculations by Liu et al. suggested that the absolute value of the O2 adsorption energy was increased by H atoms on the anatase(101) surface or at subsurface sites.174 The dissociation barriers of O2 on an anatase surface were further decreased with two H atoms at the subsurface sites or with an H surface adatom and a subsurface atom.174 After the dissociation, OH, H2O, and O adatoms might form on the surface.174
4. Application examples of black TiO2 nanomaterials
4.1 Photocatalysis
Before the report of hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles, hydrogen thermal treatment on TiO2 has already been shown in enhancing its photocatalytic activities. Harris and Schumacher found that hydrogen reduction at high temperatures reduced recombination centers and increased the lifetime of the holes in the bulk TiO2.175 The improved photoactivity was likely due to the presence of oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ species, and hydroxyl groups induced by this treatment.175 Heller et al. found by treating it in H2 at 550 °C that the photoactivity of rutile TiO2 was enhanced due to the increased EF and the energy barrier which pushed electrons away from the surface.176 Liu et al. reported that anatase TiO2 nanoparticles treated with H2 at 500–600 °C had enhanced performance in sulfosalicylic acid's photodecomposition.112
Chen et al. found that the hydrogenated black TiO2 nanoparticles obtained by treating at 200 °C for 5 d under 20 bar H2 had much higher photocatalytic activities in decomposing organic pollutants (methylene blue and phenol) and generating H2 from water–methanol solution.75 Wang and Li et al. reported that hydrogenated black TiO2 nanowires treated under ultrahigh purity hydrogen atmosphere (ambient pressure) for 3 h at 200–550 °C displayed enhanced photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance.118 Zheng et al. found that hydrogenated black anatase nanowire microspheres prepared at 500 °C for 4 h under a flow of H2 (5% in N2, 300 sccm) improved enhanced photocatalytic activity in photodecomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol in the visible-light region.134 Wang and Xu et al. reported that hydrogenated black TiO2 nanosheets obtained at 400 °C for 2 h under 10-bar pure H2 atmosphere had an enhanced photocatalytic activity in decomposing methylene blue.106 Wang and Jiang et al. produced black TiO2 under hydrogen plasma which yielded large improvement in photocatalytic decomposition of methyl-orange.137 Danon et al. reported that the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes under a flow of 5% H2 in Ar at atmospheric pressure at 350 °C for 3 h had better photocatalytic activity in removing acetaldehyde under visible light.127 Yu et al. demonstrated that by tuning the hydrogenation conditions (under a H2 gas flow (50 sccm) at atmospheric pressure in a quartz tube at 500–700 °C for various times), the photocatalytic activity of hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals in decomposing methylene blue under UV light was flexibly controlled through the control of the bulk to surface defect distribution.113 Lu et al. showed hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals by treating the commercial Degussa P25 under 35 bar hydrogen and room temperature up to 20 days, displayed improved photocatalytic activity in hydrogen generation.102 Hoang found that hydrogenation and nitridation on TiO2 nanowires improved the visible-light performance in photo-oxidation of water.131 However, Leshuk et al. found that hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles prepared at 200 °C under a 300 ± 5 psig pure H2 gas environment for 5 days or at 400–500 °C for 102 h under a 10% H2 + 90% Ar gas flow showed worse photocatalytic activities in decomposing methylene blue than pure TiO2 nanocrystals.109,110
Liu et al. compared the cocatalyst-free photocatalytic activities in generating hydrogen from water of hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes and nanorods treated under several conditions: (i) an anatase TiO2 nanotube layer (air); (ii) this layer converted with Ar (Ar) or H2–Ar (H2–Ar); (iii) a high pressure H2 treatment (20 bar, 500 °C for 1 h) (HP-H2); and (iv) a high pressure H2 treatment but mild heating (H2, 20 bar, 200 °C for 5 d) (Sci ref).103 They found that hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes from high pressure H2 treatment had a high open circuit photocatalytic hydrogen production rate without the presence of a cocatalyst, in comparison to the nonactivity of those from atmospheric pressure H2–Ar annealing and the hydrogenated rutile nanorods (Fig. 24).103 The high H2 pressure annealing induced room-temperature stable, isolated Ti3+ defect-structure was created in the anatase nanotubes.103 They suggested that clearly an adequate H2 treatment was needed to form these centers and the detailed experimental procedure seems to be crucial.103 A considerable difference in reactivity existed with respect to the hydrogenation conditions and the phase of the TiO2 nanomaterials.103

Xu et al.155 and Zhang et al.156 reported that electrochemically reduced black TiO2 nanotubes obtained with an electrochemical reduction method showed improved performance in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Li et al. showed the electrochemically reduced black anatase TiO2 nanotubes with a largely improved photocatalytic activity in decomposing rhodamine.157
Wang et al. found that black anatase nanoparticles from Al reduction showed enhanced photocatalytic activity in decomposing methyl orange under both UV and visible-light irradiations.140 More complete degradation of MO by Al-reduced TiO2 suggests the high mineralization efficiency of black titania, revealing a improved photooxidation.140 Cui et al. demonstrated that black anatase TiO2 nanotubes from Al reduction had improved photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance.141 Yin et al. showed that gray anatase TiO2 nanowires from Al reduction displayed higher photocatalytic activity in decomposing methyl orange under sunlight irradiation.142 Zhu et al. showed that black brookite nanoparticles from Al reduction had enhanced photocatalytic activities in decomposing methyl orange and methylene blue under sunlight.143 Yang et al. showed the black rutile TiO2 nanoparticles from Al reduction with improved photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance under both UV and visible-light irradiations (Fig. 25).144 Lin et al. found that the black P25 nanoparticles with non-metal dopants had increased photocatalytic activity in hydrogen generation under both UV and visible-light irradiations.145

Zhao et al. reported that black rutile TiO2 nanorods from Zn reduction had improved photocatalytic activity in producing hydrogen from water–methanol solution under both UV and visible-light irradiations.146 Zou found that gray TiO2 nanoparticles by imidazole reduction improved photocatalytic activity in producing hydrogen from water–methanol solution under both UV and visible-light irradiations.147 Kang showed enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of the black anatase TiO2 nanotubes by NaBH4 reduction.148 Black TiO2 nanoparticles from the oxidation of TiH2 by H2O2 had enhanced photocatalytic activities in both methylene blue decomposition and hydrogen generation under visible-light irradiation by Liu et al.151 and Grabstanowicz et al.152
Gallo et al. reported that Pt–Au nanoparticles supported on reduced anatase TiO2 nanocrystals showed remarkable photocatalytic activity in generating hydrogen from water–ethanol or water–glycerol solutions under both UV and simulated sunlight irradiations.177,178 The Pt–Au nanoparticles were loaded on the TiO2 nanoparticle surface by an impregnation method with (NH4)2PtCl6 and HAuCl4 solutions, followed by heating in flow O2 gas at 200 °C for 1 h. The hydrogen reduction was conducted in flow H2 gas at 250 or 500 °C for 1 h.177,178 The good photocatalytic activity was attributed to the presence of bimetallic Pt–Au nanoparticles, Ti3+ sites/O2− vacancies in the bulk, for maximizing light absorption and feedstock activation.177,178
The enhanced photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activities of black TiO2 nanomaterials have been frequently attributed to the existence of more oxygen vacancies,118,140–148,151 Ti3+ ions,140–145,151,153 surface Ti–OH groups,75,118 surface Ti–H groups,75,117,134 narrower bandgap,134 better charge separation140–145 and possibly the combination of these species.140–145,151 These reasons have also been adopted for pure or doped TiO2 nanomaterials as well.179–186 For example, Wang attributed the enhanced photocatalytic activity of {001}-facets-dominated anatase TiO2 nanosheets to the existence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ defects from the hydrothermal reaction.179 Pan et al. found that TiO2 nanoparticles with oxygen vacancies spontaneously reduce gold or Pd on the surface and have enhanced visible light photoactivity toward rhodamine B (RhB) degradation or reduction of nitroaromatics.180,181 Kong found that decreasing the relative concentration ratio of bulk defects to surface defects in TiO2 nanocrystals significantly improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes and the photocatalytic efficiency.182
4.2 Photoelectrochemical sensor
Zhang et al. reported hydrogenated black TiO2 nanorods as a photoelectrochemical sensor for organic compounds under visible light.118 The hydrogenated TiO2 nanorods were obtained by treating TiO2 nanorods in H2–Ar flow (20:80 sccm) at 350 °C for 1 h under ambient pressure.118 The starting TiO2 nanorods were prepared on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slide by reacting titanium butoxide (0.48 mL) in HCl solution (40 mL 18.25 wt%) at 170 °C for 6 h.118 Under UV and visible light, the hydrogenated TiO2 nanorods showed a highly sensitive and steady photocurrent response on several organic compounds: glucose, malonic acid and potassium hydrogen phthalate (Fig. 26), due to introduction of oxygen vacancy and mid-gap energy levels.118 The increase of the photocurrent was suggested mainly due to the improvement of electronic conductivity that resulted from the creation of mid-energy levels, rather than the enhancement in the UV and visible-light absorption after the hydrogenation process.118 The improved electrical conductivity was beneficial to the separation of electron–hole pairs and electron collection from the oxidation of water and organic compounds.118

4.3 Catalysis
Barzan et al. recently reported that hydrogen reduced TiO2 displayed excellent catalytic activity in the conversion of ethylene to high density polyethylene (HDPE) under mild conditions (room temperature, low pressure, absence of any activator).120 The hydrogenation reaction was conducted under a pure hydrogen atmosphere (pressure of 200 mbar) at 500 °C for 1 h.120 Upon H2 reduction, a broad and featureless absorption appears throughout the whole visible, near infrared, and mid infrared regions due to the creation of shallow-trapped defect sites (Ti4−n and oxygen vacancies).120 Their UV-visible and infrared spectroscopic studies of the reaction process suggested that ethylene polymerization occurred on the Ti4−n defect sites in the reduced TiO2 nanoparticles.120 The defects behaved as shallow-trap defects located in the band gap.120 These results opened valuable new applications for TiO2 nanomaterials as catalysts.120
Zeng et al. reported that hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles could decompose gaseous formaldehyde without light irradiation at room temperature.129 On the other hand, pure TiO2 nanoparticles did not show good activity in decomposing gaseous formaldehyde without light irradiation at room temperature.129 The hydrogenation was carried out under a flow of H2–Ar mixture at 300 °C for 2 h.129 The oxygen vacancies induced by hydrogenation were believed to be responsible for the catalytic activities of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles in the dark.129
4.4 Lithium-ion rechargeable battery
TiO2 has been suggested as a safer lithium-ion battery anode material over graphite, since the insertion/extraction of lithium proceeds within 1.5–1.8 V vs the Li+/Li redox couple in TiO2.187–190 It has a theoretical capacity value of 335 mA h g−1.187,188 Shin et al. reported that hydrogenated black TiO2 nanocrystals treated at 450 °C for 1–7 h under a 5% H2/95% Ar gas flow displayed excellent rate performance for lithium storage.123 The high performance was attributed to the well-balanced Li+/e− diffusion in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals from the oxygen vacancies and increased electronic conductivity induced by the hydrogen reduction reaction.123 Lu et al. reported that substantially improved high-rate performance was obtained by annealing anodized TiO2 nanotubes or rutile nanowires at 450 °C for 1 h in a 5% H2 and 95% Ar atmosphere (100 sccm flow rate) from the increase of electronic conductivity induced by a large number of oxygen vacancies produced from the hydrogenation treatment.125 Shen et al. found that by introducing Ti3+ through hydrogenation for higher electrical conductivity hydrogenated Li4Ti5O12 nanowires treated at 500–700 °C for 1.5 h in 5% v/v H2/Ar had high capacity (173 mA h g−1 at C/5), excellent rate performance (121 mA h g−1 at 30 C), and good stability.126 Li et al. found that hydrogenated mesoporous TiO2 microspheres proceeded under ambient hydrogen pressure at 400 °C for 1 h showed twice the rate capability of mesoporous TiO2 microspheres due to the combination of the short lithium-ion diffusion path and the high electronic conductivity.114 Improved lithium battery performance in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals was reported by Xia et al. as well by heating TiO2 nanoparticles at 200 °C for 5 d under 20 bar H2.191 The suggested reasons for the improved performance was attributed to reduced charge diffusion resistance within the disordered TiO2 lattice in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles.191
Myung et al. found that nanostructured black TiO2 had a superior performance with a capacity of 127 mA h g−1 at 100 C (20 A g−1) and approximately 86% retention after 100 cycles at 25 °C (Fig. 27).136 The black TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained by annealing a yellow TiO2 gel in Ar gas at 400–600 °C for 5 h.136 The white TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained by annealing the gel in air.136 The TiO2 gel was obtained by stirring high-purity TiCl4 dropwise to a distilled water–ethanol mixture with HF and urea at 0 °C for 4 h, and then evaporating the solution slowly at 80 °C.136 Yan et al. reported that hydrogenated anatase TiO2 nanoparticles prepared by a H2 plasma treatment had a fast lithium storage performance due to the enhanced contribution of pseudocapacitive lithium storage on the particle surface, possibly from the combined effect of the disordered surface layers and Ti3+ species of H–TiO2.139

The suggested explanations for the enhanced performance as electrode materials in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries of the black TiO2 nanomaterials included the creation of oxygen vacancies,123,125 the existence of Ti3+ ions,126 the well-balanced Li+/e− diffusion in the hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals,123 the increased electronic conductivity,114,123,125,126 short lithium-ion diffusion path,114 reduced charge diffusion resistance,191 and pseudocapacitive lithium storage on the disordered particle surface.136
4.5 Supercapacitor
Lu et al. reported that hydrogenated black TiO2 nanotube arrays obtained by heating anodized TiO2 nanotubes under a hydrogen environment between 300 to 600 °C displayed improved performance as supercapacitors due to increased densities of carrier and hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface from the hydrogenation.115 When scanned at a rate of 100 mV s−1, the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes had a capacitance of 3.24 mF cm−2, 40 times better than the air-annealed sample.115 They showed 68% capacitance retention when the scan rate increased from 10 to 1000 mV s−1, and had a good long-term cyclic stability (96.9% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles).115 Li et al. also found that black anatase TiO2 nanotubes from electrochemical reduction displayed much higher performance as a supercapacitor electrode, possibly due to their high conductivities.157 In summary, the increased performance as electrode materials in supercapacitors of the black TiO2 nanomaterials was suggested due to increased densities of charge carrier and hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface,115 and the higher electrical conductivity.157
4.6 Fuel cell
Zhang et al. reported that hydrogenated black TiO2 nanotube obtained by annealing the anatase TiO2 nanotubes in a ultrahigh purity H2 atmosphere at 200–600 °C for 1 h significantly improved fuel cells' performance and durability.117 Their electrical conductivity (1.7 mS cm−1) increased 10 times with increased numbers of oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups from hydrogenation for uniformly depositing a greater number of Pt nanoparticles.117 The hydrogenation reduced the decrease in the electrochemical surface area.117 When used as an anode in fuel-cell testing, they delivered a maximum power density of 500 mW cm−2, and gave a specific power density of 2.68 kW g Pt−1 when loaded with Pt and used as the cathode.117 The increased performance as electrode materials in fuel cells of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotube was suggested due to the increased electrical conductivity, oxygen vacancies, surface hydroxyl groups, and more uniformly deposited Pt nanoparticles.117
4.7 Field emission
Hydrogenated black TiO2 nanotube arrays treated under a continuous hydrogen (8 sccm) and argon (10 sccm) flux for 5 h at 400–600 °C displayed a dramatically improved performance in field emission due to the increased conductivity and decreased work function.124 Hydrogenation treatment reduced the turn-on field from 18.23 to 1.75 V μm−1.124 The black TiO2 nanotube hydrogenated at 550 °C showed a low turn-on field, a high current density (4.0 mA cm−2 at 4.50 V μm−1), and an excellent field emission stability over 480 min.124 The substantially enhanced field emission properties was attributed to the reduced work function and the improved conductivity.124 Hydrogenation created oxygen vacancies as electron donors and increased the donor density of TiO2.124 The introduced oxygen vacancy states lifted the Fermi level and reduced the work function to decrease the field-penetration barrier at the surface resulting in easy electron emission.124 Meanwhile, the oxygen vacancies from hydrogenation improved the electrical conductivity and charge mobility, and injected electrons transport easily to emission sites.124
4.8 Microwave absorption
Xia et al. showed that hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals displayed excellent microwave absorption performance, although TiO2 is traditionally a good microwave absorption material, due to its low absorption in the gigahertz region.161,162 Complex permittivity and permeability values are used to evaluate the microwave absorption properties.161,162 The real and imaginary part of permittivity, ε′ and ε′′ are related to the stored and dissipated electrical energy within the medium. Their ratio, tgδε = ε′′/ε′, is called the dielectric dissipation factor, which indicates the ratio of the lost electrical energy over stored.161,162 Similarly, the real and imaginary part of permeability, μ′ and μ′′, are related to the stored and dissipated magnetic energy within the medium. Their ratio, tgδμ = μ′′/μ′, is called the dielectric dissipation factor, which indicates the ratio of the lost magnetic energy over stored.161,162 The hydrogenated TiO2 nanocrystals–epoxy composites displayed larger ε′ values in the frequency range 1.0–18.0 GHz with the average value about 4.3 times of the pure TiO2 nanocrystals.161,162 The ε′′ value (5.9–10.6) was around 70 times larger than that of TiO2 nanocrystals–epoxy composites (0.03–0.3),161,162 and the tgδε value was 15 times bigger.161,162 The μ′ and μ′′ values were slightly changed.161,162 The hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles had much stronger microwave absorption property than pristine TiO2 nanoparticles.161,162 A material with a reflection loss (RL) value less than −30 is regarded as an excellent absorber.162 Apparently, hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles had excellent microwave absorption performance (Fig. 28A).162Fig. 28B shows the simulations of the power reflection ratio of the pristine and hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles.162 Apparently, pristine TiO2 nanoparticles didn't display much microwave absorption, while all the hydrogenated TiO2 nanoparticles had 99.9% reflection loss in certain microwave frequency ranges.162

5. Summary and prospective
Various synthetic methods: hydrogen thermal treatment, hydrogen plasma, chemical reduction, chemical oxidation, and electrochemical reduction have been developed to make black TiO2 nanomaterials with various sizes, shapes, and morphologies. These different synthetic methods and conditions directly determine the various properties and performances of black TiO2 nanomaterials originated from different research groups and published literature. Black TiO2 nanomaterials apparently have demonstrated excellent optical, chemical and electronic properties. These modified properties have been explained with either structural or chemical alterations or both in the black TiO2 nanomaterials compared to white TiO2 nanomaterials, such as lattice disorder near the surface layer, oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ ions, Ti–OH and Ti–H groups. These various explanations are the natural extensions from the difference in the synthetic approaches and chemistries involved for black TiO2 nanomaterials. Black TiO2 nanomaterials have shown superior performance in photocatalysis and lithium-ion battery over white TiO2 nanomaterials, and have also opened new applications with promising prospect in supercapacitors, fuel cells, photoelectrochemical sensors, field emission electrodes, and microwave absorbers. However, their activities in the visible-light region are still far from satisfactory, although black TiO2 nanomaterials have shown large capabilities in absorbing a large amount of sunlight and have been sometimes reported with visible-light photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical activities. Managing the amount and spatial distributions of the sources of the blackness in the black TiO2 nanomaterials, such as surface lattice disorder, oxygen vacancies, Ti3+ ions, Ti–OH and Ti–H groups, may also provide new opportunities and higher performance. While the black color only tells us the optical bandgap or the difference of the CBM and VBM, there is likely a mismatch between the electronic structures of the black TiO2 nanomaterials and the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical reactions we target for. Thus adjusting these potential matches either from the materials point of view or chemical reactions may provide new opportunities for efficiently utilizing the large amount of light being absorbed by these black TiO2 nanomaterials, especially in the visible-light region. Apparently, more efforts are needed from synthesis to property and application in order to finally improve the efficiency of black TiO2 nanomaterials for practical applications in renewable energy, environment and others.
