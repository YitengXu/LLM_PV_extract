    , Accepted 30th September 2011First published on 2nd November 2011AbstractHollow core–mesoporous shell carbon (HCMSC) with hierarchical nanoarchitecture was prepared and explored as an anode with ultra-high Li storage capacity in Li ion batteries. Compared with commercial graphite and ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3), the HCMSC not only demonstrates higher Li storage capacity, but also better cycling performance and rate capability. HCMSC possesses unique structural characteristics such as large surface area and mesopore volume. Particularly the hierarchical macro-scaled hollow core/mesoporous shell nanostructure along with 3D large interconnected interstitial volume guarantees fast mass transport in HCMSC, resulting in ultra-high Li storage capacity and excellent cycling performance and rate capability. Furthermore, the hollow macro-scaled core encapsulated in a well-developed 3D interconnected mesoporous shell serves as an efficient Li storage and buffer reservoir to reduce volume change during the charge–discharge cycling especially at high rates, which contributes greatly to the enhanced cycling performance and rate capability.
Introduction
In recent decades, Li ion batteries have been considered as leading candidates for electric/hybrid vehicles and high-end consumer electronic products as well due to their high electromotive force and high energy density.1,2 However, presently many potential electrode materials are experiencing slow Li ion diffusion and high resistance at the interface of electrode/electrolyte at high charge–discharge rates,3,4 and their rate capability, dominated mainly by the diffusion rate of Li ions and the electron transfer in electrode materials, must be improved considerably.5 To date, extensive research work has been done to improve transport of Li ions and electrons.6 Recently, in order to improve the transport of Li ions in the electrode, various nanostructured materials with high surface area, nanoscale size and/or nanoporous structure have been widely investigated.7–9 Particularly nanostructured porous carbon materials have received great attention.10–18 Nanostructured carbon materials have demonstrated good electrode properties in diversified energy storage and/or conversion systems, such as in low temperature fuel cells,19–26hydrogen storage systems,27,28 solar cells,29–31 and lithium ion batteries as well.32–37
Some of these nanostructured carbon materials such as ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) have demonstrated greatly enhanced Li storage capacity and/or improved rate capability compared with commercial graphite anodes.10–14 However, it is still highly desired to explore new materials with further enhanced Li storage capacity especially at high charge–discharge rates.
In this paper, hollow core–mesoporous shell carbon (HCMSC) spheres with hierarchical nanostructure were explored as an anode in Li ion batteries. Compared with the commercial graphite and CMK-3, the HCMSC not only demonstrates higher Li storage capacity, but also better cycling performance and rate capability. The enhanced capacity and improved cycling performance and rate capability are mainly attributable to the unique structural characteristics such as large surface area and mesopore volume of HCMSC, particularly the multimodal porosity composed of well-developed 3D interconnected hollow macropores and mesopores embedded in the shells along with 3D large interconnected interstitial volume between HCMSC particles, facilitating fast mass transport. The macroporous hollow core serves as an efficient Li storage and buffer reservoir, which not only shortens the diffusion path of Li ions but also reduces the volume change during the charge–discharge cycling especially at high rates.
Experimental section
Preparation of HCMSC
Spherical carbon capsules with hollow macroporous core/mesoporous shell nanostructure were synthesized by a “nanocasting” technique using the submicrometre-size solid core/mesoporous shell (SCMS) silica spheres as templates.38,39 A typical synthesis route for SCMS is as follows. First, 40 mL of aqueous ammonia (32 wt%) was added to a solution containing 1 L of ethanol and 80 mL of deionized water. After stirring at 30 °C for ca. 15 min, 60 mL of TEOS (98%, ACROS) was added to the above-prepared mixture and the reaction mixture was further stirred for about 6 h to yield uniform silica spheres. A mixture solution containing 50 mL of TEOS and 20 mL of C18–TMS (90% tech., Aldrich) was added to the colloidal solution containing the silica spheres and further reacted for 1 h. The resulting octadecyl group-incorporated silica shell/solid core nanocomposite was retrieved by centrifugation, dried at room temperature, and then further calcined at 823 K for 6 h under an oxygen atmosphere to produce the final SCMS silica material.
Aluminium was incorporated into the silicate framework through an impregnation method to produce acidic points on the surface of SCMS silica, which would catalyze polymerization of phenol and paraformaldehyde.40 A total of 1.0 g of SCMS silica was added to an aqueous solution containing 0.27 g of AlCl3·6H2O in 0.3 mL of water, and the resulting slurry was stirred for 30 min, and the precipitate was retrieved and washed. The residue was dried in air at 353 K. Finally, the Al-impregnated SCMS silica was calcined at 823 K for 5 h in air to yield SCMS aluminosilicate.
A typical synthesis route for HCMSC capsules is as follows. A total of 0.374 g of phenol was incorporated into the mesopores of 1.0 g of SCMS template by heating at 100 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The resulting phenol-incorporated SCMS template was reacted with paraformaldehyde (0.238 g) under vacuum at 130 °C for 24 h to yield a phenol-resin/SCMS aluminosilicate composite. The composite was heated at 1 K min−1 to 160 °C and held for 5 h under a nitrogen flow. The temperature was then ramped at 5 K min−1 to 950 °C and held for 7 h to carbonize the cross-linked phenol resin inside the mesopores of the SCMS structure. The dissolution of the SCMS template using 2.0 N NaOH and washing in EtOH–H2O solution (volume ratio of EtOH to H2O = 1:1) produced HCMSC.
The CMK-3 was fabricated by replication through nanocasting of SBA-15 silica and using furfuryl alcohol as the carbon source. SBA-15 silica was synthesized according to the protocol described in our previous paper.41 Prior to the nanocasting step, aluminium was incorporated into the silicate framework through the similar impregnation approach to that for SCMS silica to generate acidic sites on the surface of SBA-15 silica.42 Details about synthesis of CMK-3 can be found elsewhere.35
Surface characterization of various carbon materials
The surface morphologies and structures of various carbon materials such as HCMSC and CMK-3 were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Ultra High Resolution-Scanning Electron Microscopy (UHR-SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The SEM and UHR-SEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4700 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV, and a Hitachi S-5500 microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 30 kV. The TEM analysis was operated on an EM 912 Omega at 120 kV.
N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on a KICT SPA-3000 Gas Adsorption Analyzer after the carbon was degassed at 150 °C to 20 μTorr for 12 h. The specific surface areas (SBET) were determined from nitrogen adsorption using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. The total pore volume (VTotal) was determined from the amount of gas adsorbed at the relative pressure of 0.99. Micropore volumes (VMicro) and micropore size of the porous carbons were calculated from analysis of the adsorption isotherms using the Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method. The pore size distribution (PSD) was derived from analysis of the adsorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.

          Cell construction and electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical behavior of Li ion batteries based on the various carbon anode materials was studied in coin-type cells which had been prepared in a CR2032 press (Hohsen Corp., Japan). The complete cell preparation steps were performed in an argon glove box with the oxygen and the humidity level of 1 ppm or less, respectively within the chamber. A pure Li metal foil (purity, 99.9% and 150 μm thick) was used as a reference electrode and counter electrode. Carbon powder such as HCMSC, CMK-3 or graphite was mixed with acetylene black (as a conductivity enhancer) and PVdF (as a binder) at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 in a solvent (i.e., NMP). The slurry was uniformly pasted with 30 μm thickness on Cu foil. The as-prepared working electrodes were dried at 120 °C in a vacuum oven and pressed under a pressure around 4000 psi. For all the coin cells, 1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)–dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 in volume) was used as an electrolyte, and a typical polypropylene–polyethylene material (Celgard 2400) used as a separator. The charge–discharge behavior of the coin cells was characterized in a BaSyTec multichannel battery test system at a constant room temperature. The instrument was programmed to read in each 10 s step. The cells were cycled in the voltage range 3.0–0.01 V at a rate of 100 mA g−1 during an initial formation process and at different rates in the following cycles. CV measurements were conducted with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a zero-bias potential and 10 mV of amplitude. Impedance spectra were analyzed by fitting the spectra to the proposed equivalent circuit using Zview software.
Results and discussion
Surface and structural characteristics of HCMSC

Fig. 1 shows representative SEM and TEM images of the HCMSC. From the SEM image shown in Fig. 1a it is evident that the HCMSC capsules are generated as uniform individual discrete particles with a particle size of 120 ± 10 nm. The TEM image (Fig. 1b) reveals that the HCMSC has a hollow macroporous core of ca. 60 nm in diameter and a shell thickness of ca. 30 nm, which are slightly smaller than the core size (i.e., 65 nm) and the mesoporous shell thickness (i.e., 33 nm) of the SCMS silica. The slight shrinkage in the core size and shell thickness of the HCMSC compared with those of the parent SCMS silica was mainly caused by the heat treatment at high temperature. Evidently, the core size and shell thickness of the HCMSC can be controlled independently and easily through the control of the core size and shell thickness of the SCMS template, which can be realized by two separate synthesis processes, consisting of the solid core formation by the Stöber method and the subsequent formation of the mesoporous shell by the Kaiser approach. The solid core size is mainly controlled by the amount of added TEOS and the reaction time at the Stöber step, while the shell thickness is adjusted by the amount of TEOS and C18-TMS at the Kaiser step. TGA shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) reveals a residue of ca. 2 wt% for the as-prepared HCMSC, suggesting the solid core–mesoporous shell (SCMS) silica as structure-directing template has been almost completely removed during the etching step.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms shown in Fig. 2 can be classified as a type IV isotherm with a type H2 hysteresis typical of mesoporous materials according to the IUPAC nomenclature and discloses a narrow PSD for the HCMSC, proving again that the HCSMC has mesopores in the shell. This is in good agreement with that observed from the TEM images (Fig. 1b). The pore size was estimated to be ca. 3.5 nm from the PSD maximum, and the HCMSC capsules show a BET surface area of 2418 m2 g−1. In addition to the mesopores generated from the removal of the mesosize-thick silica walls in the silica/carbon composite, a fraction of micropores (ca. 22% of the total volume) formed during the carbonization of the carbon precursor and in part from the microsize-thick silica walls in the silica/carbon composite were also found in the shell of the HCMSC as indicated by a big increase of the amount of adsorbed nitrogen at the low pressure micropore range of the isotherms. Thus, it is clear that each HCMSC capsule possesses hierarchical nanostructure composed of macropores (i.e., hollow macroscopic core) in combination with mesopores and micropores in the mesoporous shell. In contrast, there was no well-defined hierarchical nanostructure observed for the CMK-3 from the SEM and UHR-SEM images shown in Fig. S2† and the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI†, even though it also has a large BET surface area of 1228 m2 g−1. BET measurement also reveals a microporous volume of 0.56 cm3 g−1 for CMK-3 which is ca. 32 v/v% of the total pore volume (i.e. 1.77 cm3 g−1), and mesopores of ca. 3.6 nm. The large surface area and mesopore volume particularly the unique hierarchical nanostructure are expected to provide HCMSC with enhanced Li storage capacity and improved rate capability.

          storage in various porous carbon materials
The Li+ insertion/extraction reactions of the HCMSC electrode were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 3 depicts the CV plots of HCMSC capsule electrodes measured between 2.5 and 0.0 V at the scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In the first scanning cycle, there is a broad cathodic reduction wave starting from ca. 1.25 V with a peak located at around 0.75 V, which could be attributed to the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) passivation layer on the surface of the carbon electrode,43,44 due to the reaction of lithium with the electrolyte. The SEI layer becomes stable under subsequent lithium insertion and extraction, which is evidenced by the considerably reduced current response and the disappearance of these peaks from the second cycle.

Fig. 4 shows galvanostatic charging–discharging plots at 100 mA g−1 for the first 10 cycles. A voltage plateau starting from around 0.9 V (vs.Li/Li+) was observed with a specific capacity of ca. 1500 mA h g−1 at the first lithiation, which corresponds to the electrolyte decomposition and SEI formation. Evidently, the large initial irreversible capacity of ca. 1728 mA h g−1 observed in the first cycle is mainly attributable to the SEI formation resulting from the ultra-large surface of the HCMSC. A reversible Li storage capacity of ca. 1431 mA h g−1 was observed for the HCMSC, and a slight decrease in the specific capacity was observed from the 2nd cycle to the 10th cycle, suggesting a good cycling performance for the HCMSC electrode.
 Fig. 4  Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves at 100 mA g−1 for HCMSC capsules. 
Although the initial coulombic efficiency is only 42% for the first cycle, it increases to the 86% during the 2nd cycle. The coulombic efficiency reaches over 90% after the 10th cycle and over 95% after the 30th cycle. Low initial coulombic efficiencies have been frequently reported in the lithium ion batteries for porous carbonaceous materials with high specific surface areas, which are mainly attributed to their high specific surface areas and the irreversible lithium insertion into the special positions such as at the vicinity of residual H atoms, resulting in the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the SEI films at the electrode/electrolyte interface.36

Fig. 5 shows representative galvanostatic plots obtained in the second charging–discharging cycle for various carbon materials, i.e., HCMSC, CMK-3, and the commercial graphite at a charge/discharge rate of 100 mA g−1. The reversible Li storage capacities determined from the delithiation process are ca. 1387, 748, and 305 mA h g−1 for the HCMSC, CMK-3, and the commercially available graphite, respectively. Evidently, the Li storage capacities for the HCMSC correspond to 3.7 times that of the theoretical capacity of graphite (i.e., 372 mA h g−1),45 and also much higher than that observed for the CMK-3. In general, nanostructured porous carbon materials have exhibited Li storage capacity in the range of 200–1100 mA g−1.10–18 Zhou et al. reported 1100 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 for ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) as a Li ion battery anode material.10Steinet al. achieved a Li ion battery capacity of 435 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C rate (1 C = 372 mA g−1) using three-dimensionally ordered macroporous carbon.15 Ordered multimodal porous carbon as an anode material revealed a capacity of ca. 900 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1.35 To the best of our knowledge, the HCMSC demonstrates the largest Li ion storage capacity among all the nanostructured carbon materials studied so far as anodes.

Fig. 6 shows the galvanostatic cycling behaviour at 100 mA g−1 for various carbon materials. HCMSC was found to be very stable up to the 80th cycle with a slight decrease in the reversible Li storage capacity. Compared with other carbon materials, HCMSC not only reveals a much higher initial reversible capacity but also much higher Li storage capacity at the 80th cycle (i.e., the HCMSC, CMK-3 and graphite electrode retain a specific capacity of ca. 1141, 513 and 245 mA h g−1 after the 80th cycle). Although the initial coulombic efficiency is as low as 41.3% due to very large irreversible capacity loss from the formation of a SEI film,46 the coulombic efficiency increases sharply to 86% during the 2nd cycle, and reaches over 95% after the 30th cycle, which is in the same level as the other carbon materials.

A good rate capability is one of the mandatory electrochemical features of Li ion batteries to power the high energy applications such as hybrid electric vehicle and electric vehicle. Fig. 7 illustrates the rate performance of the commercial graphite, the CMK-3, and the HCMSC anode materials at different current densities. The battery based on the HCMSC anode demonstrates an excellent rate capability, still delivering a high fraction of its total capacity even though it operates at a rate as high as 1000 mA g−1. Furthermore, after returning to the initial 100 mA g−1 regime, the electrode resumes near the full original capacity, further confirming the exceptional capacity of this electrode to keep its integrity not only for a long number of cycles, but also well at high rates.

          Li ion battery performance depends mostly on the three major parameters, namely, Li ion storage capacity, cyclability and rate capability, which are strongly dependent on the pore structure of the active electrode materials. To further understand the possible relationship between the Li ion storage performance and the pore structure of the active electrode material, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted after the 10th charge–discharge cycle at a rate of 1000 mA g−1 for active electrode materials, i.e., HCMSC and CMK-3. Representative Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 8 for the two materials. It is evident that both electrodes reveal a depressed semicircle in the regime of high-medium frequency along with an inclined line at low frequency. The semicircle is mainly attributable to the summation of the contact resistance, the SEI resistance (RSEI) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) while the inclined line corresponds to the typical Warburg behavior, which is related to the diffusion of lithium within the porous carbon material.36,47 Generally, the contact resistance is small, which can be neglected.48 An equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. S4† is proposed for analysis of the impedance spectra. In addition, by fitting the impedance spectra to the proposed equivalent circuit using the code Zview, some significant kinetic parameters are derived and listed in Table 1 including RSEI, Rct and Warburg impedance (ZW). Although HCMSC exhibits a close RSEI to CMK-3, it reveals a much smaller Rct than the latter (i.e., ca. 16% of the Rct of CMK-3), implying a faster charge transfer reaction for lithium insertion/extraction and facile charge transfer at the HCMSC electrode/electrolyte interface. Furthermore, much smaller ZW revealed by HCMSC suggests much faster mass transport for lithium within the pore network of HCMSC compared with CMK-3. The smaller Rct and ZW observed for HCMSC are mainly attributable to its unique nanostructure, which consists of a well-developed 3D interconnected macroporous core with an open mesoporous shell, not only facilitating fast mass transport due to the shortened Li ion diffusion distance, but also reducing the volume change during the charge/discharge cycling due to the buffering effect from the unique core/shell nanostructure. Yang et al. also reported an excellent cycling performance for a 3D porous material with macro–mesoporosities due to the small volume change and almost complete preservation of the 3D pore structure.36 In addition, the large surface area of HCMSC and the abundant micropores provide large quantities of sites for Li ion adsorption, resulting in high Li storage capacity especially at relatively low charge/discharge rates, in which most of the micropores are accessible to Li species (ions, atoms) if the sizes of the micropores are larger enough than Li species. However, at a high rate, only small portion of these micropores are still accessible to Li species and would contribute to Li storage if there is no fast pathway constructed for fast mass transport by larger pores (i.e., mesopores and macropores, especially macropores). This is one of the main reasons why HCMSC outperforms greatly CMK-3 at high rate because the latter lacks macropores. Due to their large surface areas and the abundant micropores in HCMSC and CMK-3, the capacitive contribution to the high Li capacity and high rate capability is also of our interest, and further research work will be conducted along this direction.

Conclusions
In this study, HCMSC with a hierarchical nanostructure has been explored as an anode material with ultra-high Li storage capacity. The as-prepared HCMSC possesses fantastic structural characteristics such as highly developed macro–meso–microporosity and a unique core/shell nanostructure along with 3D large interconnected interstitial volume between HCSMC particles, favouring fast mass transport for the Li species and the considerably reduced volume change during the charge–discharge cycling due to the superior buffering effect from this architecture. HCMSC exhibits much higher Li storage capacity, better cycling performance and rate capability than its counterparts, CMK-3 and commercial graphite, demonstrating ultra-high Li ion storage capacity higher than those of nanostructured carbon anode materials reported so far in Li ion batteries.
Through the control of the size of SCMS silica template, HCMSC materials with varied core size and shell thickness can be tailored,28 and further enhancement in Li storage can be expected. The development of HCMSCs with various core sizes and shell thicknesses and their application in Li storage are in progress. In addition, high-surface-area nanostructured carbon materials (i.e., HCMSCs) will be modified with graphite or metal oxide (i.e. SnO2) to reduce their initial irreversible capacity and improve initial coulombic efficiency. In addition, due to the abundant micropores and a similar storage mechanism to Li storage, HCMSC is also expected to have high charge storage when it is used as an electrode for electrochemical capacitors. This work is in progress.
