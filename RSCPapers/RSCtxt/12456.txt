The lanthanide ions are free of coordinated solvents, and the resulting NIR-MOFs are highly emissive and exhibit long luminescence lifetimes.
Near-infrared (NIR) emitting materials have shown great promise for a variety of applications, ranging from optical telecommunication, biological imaging, sensing, lasers, to solar energy conversion.1–9 NIR luminescence is often obtained by employing lanthanide ions (Ln3+); among which, Yb3+, Nd3+, and Er3+ are the most used lanthanides displaying NIR emission. The inherent features of Ln3+ that make them highly attractive for practical applications include their narrow bandwidth emission, high resistance to photobleaching, and the independence of the positions of the emission bands on environmental conditions.
In recent years, NIR emitting metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have drawn much attention for their unique properties that bring together the high porosity and structural tunability of MOF platforms into lanthanide luminescence, resulting in novel multifunctional materials. Besides, MOFs are superior to molecular complexes in terms of chemical, light, and thermal stability, and mechanical properties, facilitating their use for applications.10 Up-to-date, there have already been dozens of reported MOFs based on Yb3+, Nd3+, and Er3+ that emit NIR luminescence, and a few with less common NIR emitting Ln3+ such as Pr3+, Ho3+, and Sm3+.11 Lanthanide-based MOFs exhibit luminescence via the ‘antenna effect’, in which the chromophoric ligands absorb a large amount of photon energy under light irradiation and transfer the corresponding energy to the accepting electronic levels of the lanthanide ion. This effect allows for addressing the limitation of low molar extinction coefficients of lanthanide ions (<10 M−1 cm−1) that often results in very low luminescence intensities when the lanthanide compounds are directly excited.12 It is worth noting that the NIR luminescence emission is significantly quenched when the lanthanide ions are located close to N–H, O–H, and C–H oscillators present on ligands and coordinated solvents due to nonradiative relaxation.13 One of the strategies adopted to enhance NIR luminescence quantum yield of lanthanide compounds is based on the necessity to protect the lanthanide ions from these oscillators, which is to exclude coordinated solvents, as demonstrated in lanthanide complexes.14–16 To further increase NIR emission, substitution of C–H bonds with lower energy and less quenching oscillators such as C–F and C–D by using perfluoro and perdeuterated ligands is a well-known approach.17–20
Within the MOF field, efforts to design NIR emitting MOFs with long lifetimes and high quantum yields are rather rare. A notable attempt is the work of Chen and coworkers, which demonstrated that the enhancement of NIR emission (λex = 808 nm) of an Er3+-based MOF could be achieved by replacing the ligand 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC2−) with its fluorinated counterpart tetrafluoroterephthalate (F4-BDC2–).21 Yan and coworkers post-synthetically modified MIL-121 (Al(OH) (H2btec)·H2O, H4btec: pyromellitic acid) by doping the MOF with Ag+ and Ln3+ ions to utilize the heavy atom effect that enhances the energy transfer process. Consequently, the NIR emission of Ag+/Ln3+@MIL-121 MOFs improved compared to the corresponding Ln3+@MIL-121 samples.22 Nevertheless, we believe that a more direct approach to design highly NIR emitting MOFs should at first address the issue of the solvent coordination. This represents a synthetic challenge due to the large size of Ln3+ ions, resulting in the high probability of binding of small solvent molecules (Fig. 1a).23 In fact, the presence of coordinated solvent molecules in the first coordination sphere of Ln3+ is common in most reported lanthanide-based MOFs.24–28 Therefore, our group has been developing synthetic strategies to generate lanthanide-based MOFs with exclusion of solvent coordination.29

Herein, we report the use of a sterically bulky carboxylate ligand, tris(p-carboxylic acid)tridurylborane (H3tctb) (Fig. 1b), to construct a new MOF family, named HL1-Ln. This approach harnesses the bulkiness and hydrophobicity of the methyl CH3– substituents adjacent to the carboxylate groups to form a protective shell around the Ln3+ ions and block the coordination of solvent molecules. The syntheses, structural features, effects of metal doping, and photophysical properties of the MOFs will be presented and discussed.

HL1-Ln MOFs were synthesized using a microwave synthesizer. Nitrate salts of Ln3+ were mixed with H3tctb (1:1 molar ratio) in a solvent mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O (2:1 v/v) at room temperature. The clear solution was then transferred to a microwave vial, sealed, and heated under microwave irradiation (power = 200 W) for 40 min at 180 °C. Crystals of HL1-Ln formed at the end of the reaction were collected by filtration, washed with DMF, and dried in air. This procedure allows for obtaining a series of isostructural lanthanide-MOF analogues, including those of the common NIR emitting lanthanide ions such as Yb3+ and Er3+, as well as Eu3+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Tm3+, and Y3+. MOFs of Ln3+ larger than Eu3+, such as Nd3+ and Sm3+, however, were not formed. It is worth noting that the reaction temperature of 180 °C is required to form pure HL1-Ln MOF products; a similar reaction with Eu(NO3)3 and H3tctb at 120 °C gave a mixture of HL1-Eu and SION105-Eu, which was previously reported by our group.30 The short reaction time of 40 min, compared to days for the solvothermal method, exemplifies the advantage of the microwave-assisted synthesis. Longer microwave radiation time, e.g. 2 hours, was investigated, but the products of HL1-Ln remain the same.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on HL1-Eu as a representative MOF for the HL1-Ln family. HL1-Eu crystallizes in the trigonal space group P1c, with the asymmetric unit consisting of one third of the tctb3− ligand and one Eu atom situated on a special 2d position with 1/6 occupancy, and a chemical formula of [Eu(tctb)]. The 3-dimensional framework (Fig. 1c) is based on 1-dimensional chains of Eu3+ ions (Fig. 1d) linked together by the tctb3− ligands, within which the Eu3+ ions are separated by 4.6313(3) Å. Every two subsequent Eu3+ ions are bridged within the chain by three syn–syn bridging carboxylate groups, and each Eu3+ ion is six-coordinate with a trigonal antiprismatic geometry which is rather unusual for Ln3+ ions due to the steric bulkiness of the CH3– substituents adjacent to the carboxylate groups that prevents higher coordination numbers. As a consequence, solvent molecules do not participate to the coordination sphere of the Eu3+ ions (Fig. 1d). Considering the tctb3− ligands, 6-coordinated nodes, and the Eu3+ ion as 6-coordinated nodes, HL1-Ln has a nia net topology (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The needle-shape crystals of HL1-Ln MOFs, with sizes ranging from 10–300 μm (Fig. 2b and S2, ESI†), were collected and submitted for powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies, elemental analysis, and inductively coupled plasma – optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to confirm their phase purity. As shown in Fig. 2a, the experimental PXRD pattern of HL1-Eu can be indexed, and using the Le Bail fit, its cell parameters can be refined. The PXRD patterns of all HL1-Ln MOFs are in excellent agreement with the simulated ones derived from the crystal structure of HL1-Eu. (Fig. S4, ESI†). In addition, the FTIR spectra of all the MOFs are nearly identical (Fig. S8, ESI†). The MOF materials are stable in aqueous solutions for at least 24 hours as confirmed by PXRD (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is expected due to the strong interaction between the hard-acidic Ln3+ ions and the hard-basic O atoms of the ligand. The thermogravimetric (TGA) profile of HL1-Eu shows that the MOF is stable up to 400 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†), which justifies the retention of its crystallinity upon heating up to ∼400 °C during variable temperature PXRD studies (Fig. S6, ESI†).

The photophysical properties of H3tctb and HL1-Ln were investigated by collecting the UV/vis absorption spectrum of H3tctb, and excitation and emission spectra of the NIR-emitting MOFs. H3tctb in DMF exhibits a broad absorption band attributed to π → π* transitions located at energies corresponding to the UV region up to 380 nm, with a molar extinction coefficient of ε = 14299 M−1 cm−1 at 326 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†). To assess the organic electronic structure of the MOFs, elucidating the energies of the triplet states located on the tctb3− ligands, the HL1-Gd MOF was studied since the Gd3+ ion possesses a high-energy accepting electronic level (6P7/2, ∼32000 cm−1) that prevents energy transfer from the donating electronic levels of the tctb3− ligands, leading to pure ligand-centered emission. Upon excitation of the HL1-Gd at 360 nm, the long-lived phosphorescence originating from the triplet state located on the ligand was observed by recording emission spectra in time-resolved mode, in the solid state at 77 K and using a 50 μs delay after the excitation flash (Fig. S10, ESI†). The zero-phonon component of the phosphorescence spectrum most accurately represents the energy of the triplet state (T1) and was determined to be ∼21680 cm−1 (461.3 nm). The T1 level is substantially higher in energy than the emissive states of the NIR emitting lanthanides such as Yb3+ (EYb(2F5/2) = 10300 cm−1), Er3+ (EEr(4I13/2) = 6700 cm−1), and Ho3+ (EHo(5F5) = 15500 cm−1 or EHo(5I6) = 8580 cm−1),31 suggesting that their luminescence in the corresponding HL1-Ln can be generated by energy transfer from the T1 (Fig. S13, ESI†).
Luminescence excitation and emission spectra, quantum yields (QLLn) and lifetimes (τobs) of the NIR emitting HL1-Ln (Ln = Ho, Er, Yb) were measured. HL1-Ho exhibits emission bands at 950 − 1050 nm and 1150 − 1250 nm (Fig. 3a), which can be assigned to 5F5 → 5I7 and 5I6 → 5I8 transitions, respectively. Unfortunately, the emission signal of HL1-Ho was too weak for a reliable quantitative study. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that NIR emission from Ho compounds is rarely observed.32HL1-Er exhibits a typical long wavelength emission in the range of 1450 − 1600 nm, which originates from the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition (Fig. 3b), whilst HL1-Yb displays the characteristic emission band at 980 nm due to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition (Fig. 3c). The quantum yields and luminescence lifetimes are summarized in Table 1. Notably, only a few studies of NIR emitting Ln-based MOFs report quantum yield and luminescence lifetime values. The luminescence decay curves were fitted for the bi-exponential model, which might be due to the presence of both inner and surface Ln3+, and/or the exchange interactions between the lanthanide ions within the framework (dLn–Ln ∼4.6 Å). Both HL1-Er and HL1-Yb are highly emissive MOFs, with the latter exhibiting higher QLLn and longer τobs. These values collected for HL1-Yb are also superior to some other Yb-based MOFs; for example, the MOF-1114-Yb compounds were reported to have QLYb = 2.8 × 10−2−4.3 × 10−2%, τobs = 0.62–0.67 μs.25 However, although τobs values for HL1-Yb are comparable with those reported by our group previously for SION-100 MOF, QLYb is still lower for the former.29 This is probably due to the relatively low sensitization efficiency of the tctb3− ligands.

To investigate the effect of metal doping on the photophysical properties of HL1-Ho, HL1-Er, and HL1-Yb, we doped the MOFs with 50% of Y3+ (confirmed by the ICP-OES measurements, ESI†). PXRD studies showed that HL1-Ln/Y are isostructural to HL1-Ln (Fig. S4, ESI†). The inter- and intra- chain Ln3+–Ln3+ distances in the undoped structure are around 14.5 and 4.6 Å, respectively. Doping with 50% Y3+ theoretically allows for an increase of the Ln3+–Ln3+ distance along the chain from ∼4.6 Å to ∼9.2 Å if the Ln3+ and Y3+ ions occupied alternating positions in a periodic fashion (Fig. S11†). This distance is expected to significantly decrease the exchange interactions between the Ln3+ ions. As shown by the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping image, the Y3+ ions are homogeneously distributed within the MOF bulk crystals (Fig. S3, ESI†). Photophysical measurements showed that HL1-Ho/Y, HL1-Er/Y, and HL1-Yb/Y exhibits superimposable emission spectra as those of the undoped MOFs (Fig. 3). However, when comparing the QLLn and τobs values of HL1-Er/Y and HL1-Yb/Y with the original values of the undoped MOFs, two opposite trends were observed (Table 1). For HL1-Er/Y, the τobs slightly increases, but the QLEr is nearly six times lower than the one obtained for HL1-Er, indicating that the sensitization process in HL1-Er is very sensitive to the small change in environment around the Er3+ ion, whereas the concentration quenching is not as significant. For HL1-Yb/Y, however, both the τobs and QLYb are convincingly increased, suggesting the presence of concentration quenching.33 In addition, the percentage contribution of the long lifetime reaches near unity (96%). It is worth noting that the luminescence lifetime of ∼18.9 μs is among the highest values reported so far for Yb-based MOFs.25,29,34 This result clearly illustrates that by simply doping with Y3+, the NIR luminescence efficiencies of Yb-based MOFs can be significantly increased.
Conclusions
In conclusion, by employing ligand steric hindrance, we were able to obtain new and highly-emissive lanthanide-based MOFs that are free of solvent coordination. We demonstrated that the NIR luminescence efficiency can be further improved by doping the MOFs with Y3+. Future work will be the use of perdeuterated or perfluorinated ligands to prevent the quenching from the C–H groups. The strategies applied in this work can be generalized and used for other MOFs systems, and we believe that many lanthanide-based MOFs with high quantum yields and long luminescence lifetimes will soon be discovered. Our work presents a step forward towards the development of MOFs with enhanced NIR emission.
