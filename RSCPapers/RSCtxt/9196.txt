    , Accepted 1st October 2018First published on 2nd October 2018AbstractZnO/CdS-based nanorod arrays (NRs) are an excellent class of photoanode materials, which possess high photoelectric response for solar-driven water splitting. A highly efficient photoanode system consisting of Al-doped ZnO NRs as effective electron-transfer layers and CdS as a light harvesting layer was rationally designed. Al doping increased the conductivity of ZnO NRs and simultaneously coarsened the surface of ZnO due to expansion of ZnO lattice. The rough surface favoured the growth of a CdS coating layer on it through a successive ionic layer adsorption reaction. The integrated ZnO/CdS photoanode exhibited photocurrent of 10.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen potential) and conversion efficiency of 5.75% at 0.38 V versus RHE for 60 SILAR CdS cycles. The coating of a protective Al2O3 passivation layer through the direct current magnetron sputtering technique significantly improved the stability of the electrode, and it was better than that of the conventional atomic layer deposition method.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes is a promising strategy for conversion and storage of solar energy into a chemical fuel to obtain a permanent renewable energy supply for the future.1–6 The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is the most important parameter in evaluating the efficiency of a PEC system. Some popular semiconductors (e.g., BiVO4, Ta3N5, and Fe2O3) have attracted great attention for PEC water splitting because of their narrow band gaps and corresponding high theoretical ABPE efficiencies (9% for BiVO4 and 15% for Ta3N5 and Fe2O3).7,8 Regrettably, the conversion efficiency reported to date is far below the theoretical value of the electrodes due to several factors such as photogenerated electron–hole recombination and large onset potential.9–13 Obtaining high photocurrent with significant ABPE (10%) is still challenging for practical PEC water splitting.11,14
A CdS/ZnO heterojunction-based photoanode shows superior conversion efficiency, and it is regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar PEC water splitting.15–18 The superior PEC properties of CdS/ZnO are due to advantages of ZnO, with excellent electrical transport property, and CdS, which significantly extends solar utilization into visible light region.19,20 In addition, as an effective electron-transfer layer, ZnO possess dozen times electron mobility than TiO2.21 CdS/ZnO shows a low onset potential and good low-bias performance, which are essential for assembling spontaneous water splitting devices with photocathodes.2,22,23 Additionally, the typical type II band alignment between CdS and ZnO improves the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs.15,24 Efforts were further made to enhance the PEC performance of the ZnO/CdS photoanode including (1) adoption of IrOx or Ni(OH)2 water oxidation cocatalyst for acceleration of the water oxidation kinetics,25,26 (2) coating of ZnFeO4 or CdSe nanoparticles as hole receptors of CdS,15,27 and (3) deposition of Au nanoparticles between CdS and ZnO to facilitate charge transfer.28,29 However, the conversion efficiency of ZnO/CdS photoanode reported to date is not more than 5%.15,21,23,25–30 In this study, an integrated photoanode consisting of Al-doped ZnO nanorod (NR)-CdS nanoparticles was constructed for PEC water splitting, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The Al-doped ZnO NR array was first synthesized on FTO substrates. CdS nanoparticles were subsequently deposited onto ZnO NRs via a successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR).31 A detailed formation process of CdS is described in the Experimental section and Fig. S1.† Here, introduction of Al ions into ZnO improved the conductivity of ZnO. Al doping also expanded the ZnO lattice and thus coarsened the surface of ZnO NRs, providing more adsorption sites for absorption of Cd and S ions.31 The Al doping amount and SILAR repeat cycles were optimized for obtaining the best PEC performance parameters of ZnO/CdS photoanode. With this configuration, photocurrent of 10.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE and conversion efficiency of 5.75% at 0.38 V versus RHE were achieved for 60 SILAR CdS cycles, which are the maximum values among those of reported ZnO/CdS photoanodes. The coating of a protective Al2O3 passivation layer through direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) significantly improved the stability of Al-ZnO/CdS photoelectrode, which was better than that of the conventional atom layer deposition (ALD) method.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of ZnO NRs
FTO glasses (7 Ω per square) were first cleaned using acetone, ethanol, and deionized water. Aligned ZnO NRs were grown using a simple two-step process: synthesis of nanoparticle (NP) seed layers, followed by synthesis of ZnO NRs using hydrothermal growth. The seed layer solution was obtained by dissolving 5 mmol zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) in 10 mL deionized water. ZnO seed NPs were synthesized using spin coating, and the obtained substrates were heated to 350 °C in air for 20 min. The thickness of ZnO seed NPs was about 100 nm. Subsequently, ZnO nanorods were synthesized in a hydrothermal reactor, which contained 50 mM of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 50 mM of hexamethylenetetramine ((CH2)6N4), by keeping the temperature at 95 °C for 6 h. Al-Doped ZnO nanorods were synthesized by placing aluminum diacetate hydroxide in corresponding mole ratios (1%, 2%, 3% and 5%) into the above solution. The obtained nanorods were then rinsed with deionized water for several times and then annealed in a muffle furnace and maintained at 350 °C for 30 min.
2.2. Deposition of CdS nanoparticles
The SILAR method was used to deposit CdS nanoparticles on Al-ZnO NRs.31 To complete a SILAR cycle, the Al-ZnO NR films were successively soaked in 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2 ethanol solution for 30 s and then in 0.2 M Na2S solution, which contained methanol and deionized water (v:v = 1:1), for 30 s. The samples with 10, 30, 50, 60, 70 cycles of CdS deposition were referred to as Al-ZnO/CdS-10, Al-ZnO/CdS-30, Al-ZnO/CdS-50, Al-ZnO/CdS-60 and Al-ZnO/CdS-70 NRs, respectively. To reduce the charge transfer resistance across the interface, a two-step low-temperature thermal treatment was then conducted in a muffle furnace to anneal the Al-ZnO/CdS NR photoelectrodes at 150 °C for 10 min and then at 250 °C for another 10 min.31
2.3. Deposition of Al2O3 protective layer
Al2O3 was deposited on Al-ZnO/CdS photoanodes using the DCMS technique under Ar atmosphere. The sputtering power and pressure were 140 W and 0.25 Pa, respectively. The thickness of the protective Al2O3 film could be controlled by adjusting the sputtering time. Roughly, 1, 3 and 5 nm thicknesses were obtained with sputtering times of 2, 5 and 8 s, respectively. For comparison, 1 and 3 nm amorphous Al2O3 layers (10 and 30 cycles of ALD deposition) were deposited on Al-ZnO/CdS photoanodes by a Picosun SUNALE™ R-150B ALD reactor (Picosun, Finland), in which pulsed chemical precursors of Al(CH3)3 (Al precursor) and H2O (oxygen precursor) were supplied alternately in an N2 carrier gas at 150 °C.
2.4. Characterization
The morphologies of samples were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230 FEI Co) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, Hillsboro, OR). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Rigaku Ultima III diffractometer operating at 40 kV, 40 mA for Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out by using a Thermo ESCALAB 250 XPS system. The binding energy was calibrated by C 1s (284.6 eV). The UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu). Hall effect measurement was conducted using a HMS-3000 VER 3.51.5 system. The evolved H2 was detected via a gas chromatograph (Agilent 490 Micro GC).
2.5. Photoelectrochemical property measurements
Photoelectrochemical properties were measured in a three-electrode cell using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI-660E, Shanghai Chenhua). An aqueous solution containing 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 (PH = 12.5) was employed as an electrolyte. An AM1.5G sunlight simulator (100 mW cm2, oriel 92251A-1000) was used as a light source for measurements. A sample we prepared, a Pt sheet and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Potentials of the working electrode were shifted at an RHE scale by the formula VRHE = VAg/AgCl + V0 + 0.05916 × pH, where VRHE is the potential vs. reversible hydrogen potential, VAg/AgCl is the potential vs. Ag/AgCl electrode, V0 = 0.1976 V at 25 °C and pH is the pH value of electrolyte. The film area exposed to the light was 0.28 cm2. The conversion efficiency (η) is calculated from the LSV curve of the photoelectrode:  
Here, Jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Vbias is the bias applied between the working electrode and counter electrode, and Plight is the power density of the incident light. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was determined under irradiation of different wavelengths of light generated by monochromatic filters. The IPCE was calculated as follows:  
Here, Iph is the photocurrent density (μA cm−2), and P and λ are the incident light intensity (μW cm−2) and wavelength (nm), respectively. The incident light intensity was measured by a photometer (Newport, 840-C, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples were measured under illumination at the bias of the open-circuit voltages in three-electrode configuration with the frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of various as-prepared photoanodes. For pristine ZnO NRs, the strong diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO (JCPDS: 36-1451).20 After doping with Al ions, all the recorded diffraction spectra revealed only the diffraction peaks of ZnO without any additional diffraction peaks related to Al. This finding indicated that Al3+ ions were substituted into Zn2+ ion sites or incorporated into the interstitial sites in the ZnO lattice.32,33 Due to the smaller ionic radius of Al3+ (0.054 nm) compared with those of Zn2+ (0.074 nm) and O2− (0.14 nm),34 the diffraction peak of ZnO clearly shifted toward a low angle after Al ion doping (Fig. 2b). After combination with CdS through different deposition cycles, new diffraction peaks at 26.6°, 30.8° and 44° appeared, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of CdS.

Fig. 3a displays the top view of the FE-SEM image of primary ZnO NRs with hexagonal structures and 150–200 nm diameter, which are uniformly distributed on the FTO substrate. Compared with undoped ZnO NRs, Al-ZnO is more favourable for SILAR process for Cd2+ and S2− ion adsorption with respect to the growth of the CdS coating layer due to a rough surface (Fig. 3b and Fig. S2†), which originates from the lattice expansion caused by doping of Al ions. After deposition of CdS for 60 cycles, the hexagonal nanorod structure exhibits almost no change, and the surface is uniformly covered with CdS (Fig. 3c and d). The TEM image further reveals that Al-ZnO displays a rough surface compared with pristine ZnO (Fig. S3†). The HRTEM image in Fig. 4b shows that the interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm of Al-ZnO corresponds to the (002) plane of the wurtzite ZnO, which is consistent with that of pristine ZnO (Fig. S3†). With 60 SILAR repeating cycles, ZnO NRs are coated with a thin layer (about 20 nm) of CdS nanoparticles (Fig. 4c). The spot and ring patterns observed in the SAED pattern correspond to the single crystal structure of ZnO NRs and polycrystalline structure of CdS (Fig. 4d). The lattice spacings of 0.34 and 0.29 nm in the CdS layer correspond to (111) and (200) planes.20,35

The influence of Al-doped concentration on the PEC performance of ZnO was investigated. The photocurrent density reached a vertex of 1.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE with 2% Al-dopant concentration (Fig. S4†), which was about twice that of pristine ZnO (0.8 mA cm−2). UV-vis absorption spectra, Mott–Schottky curves and Hall effect measurements were conducted to investigate the effect of doping of Al ions on the performance of ZnO (Fig. S5 and S6†). Doping of Al ions narrowed the band gap of ZnO, enlarged the range of light response, and increased the charge mobility and carrier concentration. The presence of Al3+ in lattice interstitial positions led to the generation of free electrons to maintain charge neutrality, thus increasing the charge carrier concentration.36,37 Further increase of dopant concentration to 3% led to evident decline of the photocurrent response. Excess dopants may cause crystal lattice defects and inhibit the movement of carriers through ZnO, which negatively decreases the mobility and conductivity (Fig. S6†).38 Thus, ZnO NRs with optimized 2% of Al ion doping were chosen as the substrates for the following CdS deposition.
UV-visible absorption spectra show that pristine ZnO and Al-ZnO NRs only absorb light of wavelengths shorter than 400 nm (Fig. 5a). The light absorption of ZnO/CdS NRs is extended to the visible-light region, and red-shift range increases with increasing number of SILAR cycles. The corresponding colour changes from gray to orange, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows the comparison of linear sweep voltammagram (LSV) curves of pristine Al-ZnO and Al-ZnO/CdS with different SILAR cycles under light illumination. The photocurrent density of Al-ZnO/CdS exhibits great enhancement in the whole potential range and increases significantly with the deposition cycle number up to a maximum value of 10.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE for 60 SILAR cycles for the photoanode. The introduction of CdS boosts the visible light absorption, and the type-II band alignment between ZnO and CdS benefits the separation of photogenerated carriers.20,31 Further increase in deposition cycles results in a thicker CdS layer, which leads to reduction of the photocurrent. Due to very thick CdS, the photogenerated electrons may transport through the CdS layer and inject into ZnO NRs with difficulty, causing electron–hole recombination within CdS nanoparticles.20,39Fig. 5c presents a light on/off experiment. Both photoanodes show a fast and reproducible photoresponse per each cycle, demonstrating fast charge generation and transfer. Moreover, the quantitative value is identical to that of LSV. Conversion efficiency is calculated from the chopped-light curves in Fig. S7.† High photoanode conversion efficiency of 5.75% is achieved at 0.38 V versus RHE for 60 SILAR cycles, and it is significantly superior to those of existing ZnO/CdS photoanodes (Table S1†). The corresponding transient photocurrent density–time (I–t) curves of all photoelectrodes are obtained under chopped light illumination at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl (Fig. 5d). All electrodes exhibit fast photoresponse and excellent photoswitching properties during light illumination on/off cycles. The current density is detected to be 9.7 mA cm−2 for SILAR 60 cycles, and it is consistent with the values obtained from LSV curves.

To demonstrate the accuracy and repeatability of the measurement data, ten Al-ZnO/CdS photoanodes were tested (Fig. 6a). Negligible difference between the LSV curves of each sample was observed. The photocurrent at 1.23 V versus RHE was amplified and listed in Fig. 6b and c. The current value was in the range of 10.1–10.8 mA cm−2, which verified good repeatability of the experiment. The IPCE of the Al-ZnO/CdS photoanodes were tested and its values up to 80% in the range of 420–480 nm (Fig. 6d). An integral photocurrent density of 10.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE was also calculated by integrating the IPCE values over the standard solar spectrum of AM 1.5 G (ASTM G173-03), which was consistent with the measured value shown in Fig. 6a.

To stabilize PEC photoelectrodes, the prevailing strategy is to introduce a protecting layer to isolate the photoactive surface from the corrosive electrolyte.40–42 In the present case, direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) was used to deposit the metal Al on the surface of the photoanodes, which was then self-oxidized to Al2O3. The thickness of the protective film was controlled by adjusting the sputtering time. Fig. S8† shows the HRTEM image of the 5 s-DCMS-treated Al-ZnO/CdS photoanode. The surface of CdS was clearly coated with a uniform Al2O3 protective layer of thickness of about 3 nm. While the photocurrent decreased significantly with ALD deposition, relative to pristine photocurrent, the photocurrent of Al-ZnO/CdS with DCMS treatment could be maintained and it slightly increased (Fig. 7a and b). Even when the thickness of DCMS-deposited Al2O3 increased to 5 nm (Fig. S9†), the PEC performance of photoanode was still superior to that of ALD. The possible reason may be the existence of partially unoxidized metal Al in the DCMS sample, which facilitated the hole transfer from the Al-ZnO/CdS film interior to the water–electrode interface; this will be investigated in detail in our later study. This can be confirmed from the test results of EIS (Fig. S10†). The arc radius of the EIS spectrum of Al-ZnO/CdS/Al2O3 was larger than that of Al-ZnO/CdS, which indicated that the charge transfer resistance increased after deposition of Al2O3 due to its low charge mobility.43,44 The increase in Al2O3 deposition by ALD was more clear even with only 1 nm thickness. This resulted in poor performance by ALD for Al2O3 when compared with that for DCMS. The result of sputter XPS confirmed the possible existence of unoxidized metal Al. After Ar sputtering (about 1.5 nm), the XPS characteristic peak of Al 2p shifted towards low binding energy, which indicated the increase in Al–Al bond (Fig. S11†).45,46 Photostability was identified by measuring photocurrent under continuous light illumination at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl; we observed drastic decrease in photocurrent (Fig. 7c). The photocurrent density of untreated Al-ZnO/CdS electrode decayed to 52% of the initial photocurrent after continuous illumination for 1800 s (Fig. 7d) due to hole-induced anodic corrosion. The photostability of the electrode could be improved significantly through DCMS deposition of the Al2O3 protective layer. The electrodes with the Al2O3 protective layers of ∼1 and ∼3 nm maintained 75% and 83% of the initial photocurrents after illumination for 1800 s (Fig. 7d). Due to the electron–hole generation and recombination in the bulk and the holes in the bulk causing CdS degradation, the current declined with time. With 3600 s of illumination, the electrode with ∼3 nm Al2O3 protective layer still maintained 71% of the initial photocurrent. The faradaic efficiency of H2 production was also tested and calculated to be 93% for the Al-ZnO/CdS DCMS 1 nm Al2O3 photoanode (Fig. S12†). For comparison, only about 60% of the initial photocurrent was maintained for the same Al-ZnO/CdS electrode with 1 and 3 nm-thick Al2O3 passivity layers deposited through conventional atomic layer deposition (ALD) after continuous illumination for 3600 s (Fig. 7d). The better photostability of the photoanode obtained through DCMS treatment than through the ALD technique may be because the generated Al2O3 layer via DCMS is quite compact and smooth,47 which can strictly sequester direct interaction of CdS with O2 and H2O from the electrolyte solution, thus considerably retarding the photocorrosion of CdS upon visible-light exposure.48

4. Conclusions
A highly efficient Al-ZnO/CdS photoanode system for solar water oxidation has been constructed. A current density of 10.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE and conversion efficiency of 5.75% at 0.38 V versus RHE were obtained, which were derived from high electron transport of the Al-doped ZnO nanorod array and the appropriate bandgap of CdS significantly extends solar utilization into visible light region. More impressively, the stability of Al-ZnO/CdS photoanode was extensively prolonged with coating of Al2O3 protective layer through the DCMS process. The strong photostability was due to the oxidation of fresh metal aluminium at the surface layer of the photoanode treated with DCMS to aluminium oxide, which exhibited liquid-like superplasticity and smoothness. We not only put forward a photoanode system with high conversion efficiency and high photocurrent, but also provide a new blueprint of using DC magnetron sputtering-coated Al2O3 to improve the stability of the photoelectrode system while maintaining pristine photocurrent.
