    , Accepted 18th October 2017First published on 18th October 2017AbstractHollow optical fiber induced dye-sensitized solar cells are made by twisting Ti wire/N719-TiO2 nanotube photoanodes and Ti wire/Pt (CoSe, Pt3Ni) counter electrodes, yielding a maximized efficiency of 0.7% and good stability. Arising from optical energy storage ability, the solar cells can generate electricity without laser illumination.
Solar cells are considered as one of the promising solutions to the energy crisis and environmental problems.1–3 Among various solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have raised growing interests because of their simple preparation, environmental-friendliness, scalable materials, technique, etc.4–9 The state-of-the-art planar DSSCs always have high-efficiency, heavyweight, inflexibility, etc. Application-specific requirements for future DSSCs include being lightweight, mechanical resilience and persistent power generation for multi-purpose utilizations ranging from intertexture for clothes to mineral exploration in extreme environments. For example, the long-term operation in undersea and other extreme conditions requires constant electricity supply for devices. However, the as-developed photovoltaics cannot meet these demands in the absence of solar energy. In recent years, newly structured fiber solar cells have experienced a booming development and aroused widespread concerns. Notably, an innovative hybrid solar cell structure was developed by Wang et al. through integrating optical fibers with ZnO nanowire arrays for three-dimensional (3D) DSSCs. Arising from the decoration of ZnO nanowires on optical fibers for enhanced absorption ability to solar energy, these devices have a significantly enhanced energy conversion capacity, yielding a maximized efficiency as high as 0.6%.10 This success led to follow-up explorations of optical fiber based solar cells as a new research idea. The new design concept demonstrates possible applications at remote locations such as underground, deep sea etc. inside the volume of the units. Another great challenge for state-of-the-art DSSCs is the zero-electricity outputs when removing sunlight illumination. The photosensitizers cannot produce electrons in the absence of solar excitation, therefore there is no power generation in dark-light conditions. Therefore, the weather-independent solar cells tailored with optical fibers may persistently convert optical energy into electricity even when removing illumination. Long persistence phosphors (LPPs) are optical storage materials that can store wide-spectra optical energy and release photofluorescence lasting for hours. The incorporation of LPPs into photovoltaics makes LPPs store unabsorbed optical energy and then release energy, acting as a “sun” in dark-light conditions.11–13 Guided by this concept, the optical fiber induced solar cells with optical energy storage and conversion can meet application-specific requirements.
In the current work, we have successfully made hollow optical fiber induced DSSCs by setting the hybrid Ti wire/N719-TiO2 nanotube photoanode and twisted Ti wire/Pt counter electrode structure into the LPP decorated hollow optical fiber and filling with liquid I−/I3− electrolyte. Pt electrode has been an economic burden for DSSCs, therefore high-performance CoSe and Pt3Ni counter electrodes have been developed to replace precious Pt.14,15 The optical fiber induced solar cells have high power conversion efficiency, remote handling, flexibility, and persistent power generation when removing illumination.16–19 By sealing two ends of these solar cells, the liquid electrolyte cannot leak and external environments do not affect photovoltaic performances. Therefore, the so-called optical fiber induced solar cells are expected to have good long-term stability even for underground and deep sea applications.

Fig. 1a illustrates the application in deep sea conditions as well as the structural diagram of optical fiber induced DSSCs. This solar cell is waterproof unlike state-of-the-art planar or fiber-shaped solar cells. Fig. 1b shows the XRD profile of the anode from the TiO2 nanotubes, giving diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.2, 37.8, 47.9, 53.9, 55.1, 62.7 and 68.7° for anatase (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (116) planes, respectively. SEM images in Fig. 1c and d demonstrate that the TiO2 nanotubes with a length of about 22 μm (see Fig. S1, ESI†) have an outer diameter of about 85 nm and a wall thickness of around 30 nm. The rough surface and abundant surface sites increase dye loading, while the vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes accelerate electron transportation and significantly reduce electron trapping by crystal boundaries.

Before electrochemically depositing Pt, Ti wires are thoroughly rinsed and subsequently polished to remove TiOx species and to create rough Ti surface. In this fashion, the Pt nanoparticles can be closely attached on the Ti substrate. Precious Pt is relatively expensive for commercialization of DSSC devices and compound and alloy counter electrodes are good choices to reduce solar cell costs without sacrificing cell efficiency. Therefore, CoSe and Pt3Ni counter electrodes are prepared according to a similar method, as shown in Fig. 2. Both CoSe and Pt3Ni electrodes are stacked with loose nanoparticles. These extraordinary structures provide gigantic channels for electrolyte diffusion and absorption, therefore, they are expected to have superior catalytic activity toward the I3− reduction reaction. As shown in Fig. 3a, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of various counter electrodes are recorded in liquid I−/I3− redox electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Since a counter electrode can catalyze the I3− + 2e− = 3I− reduction reaction, the peak current density of Red1 (JRed1) and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red1 and Ox1 can be used to assess its catalytic activity. The CV curves for CoSe and Pt3Ni electrodes have a similar shape to that of the standard Pt electrode, showing the same catalytic mechanism toward the I3− reduction processes. From Fig. 3a it can be found that JRed1 follows an order of CoSe > Pt3Ni > Pt, while Epp follows CoSe < Pt3Ni < Pt. Enhanced JRed1 and reduced Epp indicate that the counter electrodes from the Pt-free CoSe compound and low-Pt Pt3Ni alloy have increased catalytic activity and lower potentiometric losses for the I3− reduction process. Therefore, CoSe and Pt3Ni electrodes are crucial in achieving high solar cell efficiency. From the stacking CV curves of the Pt3Ni alloy electrode recorded at varied scan rates, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S2, one can conclude that the charge diffusion obeys a diffusion-controlled mechanism due to the linear relationship between the square root of the scan rate and the peak current density (ESI,† Fig. S3). The results show that the diffusion layer of I3− ions is thinned and the electrochemical polarization is high at the elevated scanning rate, resulting in an increase in overpotential and poor reversibility.

In addition, we compared the Bode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of symmetric dummy cells to calculate the lifetime of electrons at counter electrodes. Once the electrons migrate from the external circuit to the counter electrode layer, they participate in a I3− reduction reaction, therefore the reaction kinetics of the Red1 process can be compared using electron lifetime. As shown in Fig. 3b, the electrons at the CoSe electrode have an average lifetime of 5.0 μs according to τ = 1/2πfp, where fp is the peak frequency. This lifetime is shorter than that for Pt3Ni and Pt electrodes, demonstrating that the CoSe counter electrode has superior catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the corresponding Nyquist EIS plots and Tafel polarization curves are shown in Fig. 3c and d, presenting the smallest interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct, see Table S1, ESI†) value and the largest exchange current density for CoSe CEs compared to Pt3Ni and Pt CEs. In conclusion, the higher peak current density, lower Epp and shorter τ indicate that CoSe alloy electrodes have maximized catalytic activity in reducing I3−.
Upon assembling into optical fiber induced DSSCs, the characteristic J–V curves under optical fiber irradiation are shown in Fig. 4a. The solar cell device with the CoSe electrode yields a maximized power conversion efficiency of 0.70% (Jsc = 2.15 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.566 V, FF = 57.5%), while power conversion efficiencies for DSSCs with Pt3Ni and Pt counter electrodes are 0.50% and 0.23%, respectively. Notably, the Jsc follows an order of CoSe > Pt3Ni > Pt because of the total catalytic activity. In detail, a superior counter electrode can accelerate the conversion from I3− to I− ions, therefore more electrons may be generated by recovered dye molecules, leading to increased Jsc output. The theoretical Voc is determined by the energy difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of I−/I3− couples, while the real Voc output is lower than its value in theory because of backward recombination reactions at the N719-TiO2/electrolyte interface. Arising from the deviated catalytic activity, electronic conductivity and morphologies of three counter electrodes, the final Voc outputs are also changed. The photovoltaic performances can be cross-checked by Nyquist EIS plots of DSSCs, as shown in ESI,† Fig. S4. In addition to the high power conversion efficiency, the so-called optical fiber induced solar cells have fast start-up and multi-start capabilities. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the on-off switches of solar cells with three counter electrodes by alternating the irradiation (100 mW cm−2) and darkening (0 mW cm−2) of the devices. An abrupt increase in photocurrent means rapid start-up of these solar cells under the stimulus of sunlight, while the similar photocurrent values upon several switches suggest a relative stability. Additionally, the efficiency outputs for three solar cells remain unchanged for 168 h in atmospheric conditions, as shown in Fig. 4b. The outstanding durability is beneficial to their practical applications in remote locations.

To realize experimental electricity generation in dark conditions, the optical fiber is decorated with LPPs. Intriguingly, the corresponding LPP tailored solar cell with Pt electrode yields increased efficiency from 0.23% to 0.61%, as seen in Fig. 4c. The main reason behind this enhancement is the simultaneous illumination of the optical fiber and LPPs, enhancing the dye excitation and therefore electron generation (Fig. S6, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4d and ESI,† Fig. S8, the dark J–V curve starts from the coordinate origin, representing zero value for current and voltage outputs. Upon decoration with the LPP layer, surprisingly, the recorded J–V curves do not pass the coordinate origin when the optical fiber irradiation is removed. It is known that LPPs can store optical energy and emit photofluorescent light for hours when removing irradiation. In this fashion, the fluorescent light released from the LPP layer can be re-absorbed by N719 dyes for persistent electricity generation.20,21
In summary, we have demonstrated the experimental realization of three-dimensional hollow optical fiber induced DSSCs by utilizing Ti wire supported TiO2 anodes and alternative counter electrodes. A power conversion efficiency as high as 0.7% is determined on the solar cell with the CoSe counter electrode. Moreover, this device has relatively stable power conversion efficiency over 168 h and persistent power generation when removing optical fiber illumination. This work represents a significant step forward in the struggle for building weather-independent solar cells for remote location applications.
