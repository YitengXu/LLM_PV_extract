    , Accepted 10th September 2020First published on 10th September 2020AbstractHerein, we report the design and synthesis of four new thiophene-bridged D–π–A configured organic dyes T1–4 comprising different donors, π-spacers and anchoring units, as potential sensitizers and co-sensitizers for DSSCs. The current work also highlights their structural, photophysical, thermal, electrochemical, theoretical, and photoelectrochemical studies, including evaluation of their structure–property relationships. The optical results revealed that the dyes T1–4 display λabs and λemi in the range of 402–461 nm and 556–575 nm, respectively, with a bandgap in the order of 2.31–2.58 eV. Furthermore, the results showed that the dyes possess all the pre-requisites to act as sensitizers/co-sensitizers. Among the tested dyes, the device based on sensitizer T2 achieved the highest PCE compared to the other three dyes, under the standard conditions. Furthermore, their co-sensitized devices were fabricated by co-adsorbing them with the well-known Ru-based MH-12 sensitizer and interestingly the co-sensitizer T3 carrying an alkoxy group and a barbituric acid anchor displayed the highest PCE of 8.79%, which is much higher than that of MH-12 alone (8.18%). Conclusively, the study furnishes a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in the structural modification of sensitizers/co-sensitizers in achieving an enhanced performance of the devices.
Introduction
Over the past three decades, the quest for clean and low-cost energy production from renewable energy resources has gained much importance to address the problem of the energy crisis.1–4 The new third-generation photovoltaic devices, especially dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted substantial interest in energy material research due to the possibility of generating energy from low-cost and eco-friendly devices.5–7 Besides, these devices show an excellent performance in a non-ideal light atmosphere such as dim, diffuse, and indoor light.8 Typically, a DSSC is composed of a simple sandwich structure containing a dye-adsorbed wide band-gap metal oxide semiconductor electrode (TiO2) and a platinum counter electrode filled with an electrolyte containing an I−/I3− redox couple.9–11 Based on their working principle, one can understand that the dye as a photosensitizer plays a vital role in achieving high photon-conversion efficiency (PCE), as it regulates photons harvesting and initiating the electrochemical processes in the cell.12 Consequently, the cell performance can be tuned by controlling the chemical structure of the dye, while keeping the other components unchanged. To date, the ruthenium(II) complexes have been demonstrated to yield very high PCE values and possess long term stability due to their attractive photophysical and electrochemical properties.13,14 Nevertheless, their high cost, the environmental hazards posed, and problems associated with their purification have restricted their further development. In contrast, the metal-free organic dyes triggered greater interest than Ru(II) based dyes because of several advantages such as the versatility of design, high molar extinction coefficients, tuneable photophysical spectral behavior, and cost-effectiveness in their synthesis, but their PCE values in the devices are relatively low.15–17
In the literature, a wide range of design strategies have been reported for the development of effective organic sensitizers/co-sensitizers.18 One such approach is making use of a simple D–π–A strategy, where D/A and π refer to the electron donor/acceptor and π-bridge groups, respectively. This type of structure facilitates intra-molecular charge transfer on photoexcitation with the help of a conjugated spacer acting as a bridge to enable the transfer of electrons generated by the donor unit to the acceptor/anchor group.19 The electron-accepting anchor grafts the dye onto the TiO2 surface; subsequently, the excited-state electrons from the dye can be injected into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 by appropriate energy alignment of the dye/TiO2 interface system.20
But, the most common problems associated with the dye, i.e. its aggregation and charge recombination with the oxidized electrolyte (dark current), bring about a decrease in their photovoltaic parameters.21,22 To suppress these issues, a small amount of an anti-aggregation agent is added. Another major issue is the solubility of dyes in classical solvents, which further limits their practical applications. The poor solubility of dyes in solvents generally tends to aggregate the dye during the fabrication process resulting in less stable and hence, less efficient solar cells.23 Indeed, the π-bridge group is crucial in enhancing the performance of DSSCs because it can primarily affect the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and thus, the absorption spectrum that is important for light-harvesting.24–26 Among the various organic sensitizers/co-sensitizers reported in the literature, the thiophene and its derivatives have been proved to be good π-bridged conjugated skeletons as well as electron donors because of their small resonance energy, high polarizability, stability, and excellent charge transporting capability.27 The introduction of thiophene moieties is expected to facilitate the bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra and broaden the spectral region of absorption in the visible region. Also, the incorporation of thiophene linkers enhances the molar absorptivity of the materials and makes the whole molecule occupy a larger surface area than the molecule linear shape, thereby leading to the reduction of the loading capacity.28 The presence of thiophene between donor and acceptor moieties not only extends the π-conjugation of the chromophore, but also increases the overall stability.29 Interestingly, the introduction of the cyanovinylene group in between two conjugated donors is a smooth approach to further enhance the π-conjugation and thereby shift the absorption maxima of the resulting molecule to higher wavelengths with an enhanced molar extinction coefficient.2 Furthermore, in the field of sensitizers, many research efforts, dedicated to constructing diverse organic dyes, have employed the conventional cyanoacetic acid (CA) as an acceptor unit due to its excellent electron-withdrawing ability.3 Also, the biologically important heterocycle-based barbituric acid was shown to be an effective acceptor/anchoring unit due to its effective binding on the surface of TiO2 through –NH or –OH functional groups.30–32
Co-sensitization is one of the most important alternative techniques to fulfil the limitations of a single dye approach. Since an organic dye possesses a characteristic sharp and narrow absorption spectrum, it has a poor photon-harvesting ability.33 In this strategy, a combination of two or more dyes is used to improve the overall light-harvesting ability of the cell. For example, Ru(II) dye has a lower absorption power with a low molar extinction coefficient in a higher wavelength region, which can be complemented with the high molar extinction coefficient dye, thereby imparting panchromatic behavior and hence, high PCE values to the DSSCs.34 Recently, a number of reports have appeared in the literature on co-sensitization studies of several new D–A and D–π–A type organic dyes along with Ru-based complexes and they have been shown to exhibit enhanced photovoltaic performance when compared to single sensitizers.35 Here, the increased performance is mainly due to their ability to adsorb into pores and voids of the TiO2 semiconductor surface, while the three-dimensional bulky ruthenium-based dye fails to get adsorbed fully. Hence, it is necessary to understand the importance of simple co-sensitizers and the factors which optimize the interfacial charge transfer. To date, as we know, there is only limited literature available which addresses the impact of the incorporation of long alkoxy chains into the simple dye and how it correlates with the device performance as a sensitizer as well as a co-sensitizer.
Encouraged by this, in the present work, we have designed four new D–π–A configured dyes T1–4, carrying O-alkyl substituted phenyl groups (dodecyloxyphenyl and bisdodecyloxyphenyl) as the electron donor, cyanovinylene together with the thiophene system as the π-spacer, and cyanoacetic acid and barbituric acid groups as the electron acceptor/anchoring units, for DSSC applications. The use of these dyes as active sensitizers and co-sensitizers along with the renowned Ru(II) complex MH-12 dye (Fig. 1) in the devices was contemplated. It is assumed that these new organic dyes when employed as active co-sensitizers along with the MH-12 dye cover the surface of TiO2 more efficiently than MH-12 alone, leading to enhanced photovoltaic performance.

These target molecules were prepared in good yields by adopting simple synthetic methods, viz. O-alkylation and Vilsmeier–Haack reaction followed by Knoevenagel condensation protocols (Scheme 1). Their structures are shown in Fig. 1. The new dyes and their intermediates were well-characterized using spectroscopic and elemental analyses. The photophysical properties and FMO energy levels were evaluated via UV-Visible absorption and photoluminescence (PL) studies. Their electrochemical data along with parameters related to thermodynamic driving forces for the processes involved during energy conversion were determined by cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies. Also, their thermal behavior was evaluated by TGA and DSC. Furthermore, the molecular geometry, electron distributions, energetic properties and absorption spectra of T1–4 were theoretically investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using Turbomole 7.2 V software. Finally, the synthesized dyes were applied as sensitizers as well as co-sensitizers with MH-12 dye towards the fabrication of new DSSCs and their photovoltaic performance data were obtained. Also, their EIS studies were carried out to understand their interfacial charge recombination and carrier transportation processes in depth.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic pathways of four new metal-free organic dyes T1–4 are shown in Scheme 1. The required alkoxy benzaldehydes 2a–b were synthesized from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1a) or 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (1b) by reacting it with 1-bromododecane in the presence of potassium carbonate. Subsequently, the aldehydes 2a–b were condensed with thiophene-2-acetonitrile using the Knoevenagel reaction protocol to obtain the substituted thiophenyl acrylonitriles 3a and 3b as intermediates. Furthermore, these intermediates were formylated using the standard Vilsmeier–Haack reaction protocol to yield precursors 4a and 4b. In the final step, the target molecules T1–4 were obtained by following the Knoevenagel condensation protocol, wherein the precursor 4a or 4b was condensed with an active methylene compound, viz. cyanoacetic acid and barbituric acid. All the synthesized compounds were purified using recrystallization or column chromatography techniques. The molecular structures of the newly synthesized target dyes and their intermediates were confirmed by using various spectroscopy methods (Fig. S1–S16, ESI†) and elemental analysis.
Theoretical studies
To gain a much deeper understanding of the geometrical configurations and frontier molecular orbitals of T1–4, molecular orbital calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT). The Turbomole 7.2 software package was used to execute the theoretical calculations. Using a semiempirical AM1 basis with MOPAC in Tmolex, we have optimized the ground state geometries of the dye molecules in the gas phase. The aforesaid geometries were further optimized using the C1 point group symmetry via Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional and Lee–Yang–Parr's gradient-corrected correlation functional (B3LYP) program and the basis set def-TZVPP was used for all the calculations.13 The electronic cloud distributions in the FMO levels of dyes T1–4 are depicted in Fig. 2 and Fig. S17 (ESI†) and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Here, the LUMO+1, LUMO+2, and LUMO+3 levels correspond to second, third, and fourth lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, whereas HOMO−1, HOMO−2, and HOMO−3 represent the second, third, and fourth-highest occupied molecular orbitals, respectively.

As seen from Fig. 2, in the case of HOMO levels, electron densities of T1–4 are primarily distributed along with the donor unit, which clearly indicates the electron-donating capacity of the dodecyloxyphenyl/bisdodecyloxyphenyl group along with the thiophene unit. Nevertheless, the electron density distribution in LUMOs is found in the acceptor part, i.e. cyanoacetic acid/barbituric acid and π conjugated spacer containing the cyanovinylene group. Furthermore, it can be observed that as we move from HOMO to HOMO−3, the electron density is sharply localized on the electron donor and thiophene unit omitting the electron cloud on the cyanovinylene unit. The theoretical HOMO energy levels obtained for dyes T1–4 are −6.06 eV (T1), −6.00 eV (T2), −6.07 eV (T3), and −6.01 eV (T4), which are significantly lower than that of the redox potential of the I3−/I− electrolyte system (−5.2 eV) confirming that the synthesized dyes can undergo a quick ground state regeneration process. The theoretical LUMO energy levels obtained for dyes T1–4 are −3.21 eV (T1), −3.18 eV (T2), −3.28 eV (T3), and −3.26 eV (T4), which are significantly higher than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−4.2 eV) indicating their fast electron injection. The theoretical bandgap obtained for T1 and T2 is almost the same, i.e. 2.85 (T1) and 2.82 (T2), whereas band gaps of T3 and T4 are 2.78 and 2.75, respectively, which may be due to the different anchoring abilities of the molecules. Conclusively, the well-overlapped HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the dyes T1–4 can guarantee a fast charge transfer between donor and acceptor units and the efficient interfacial injection of electrons from the excited state of the dye molecule into the conduction band of the semiconductor.
Furthermore, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) studies were performed in order to investigate the electronic excitations of the dyes in the presence of time-dependent perturbations. According to adiabatic approximation, TD-DFT temporal nonlocality is neglected, which postulates at any point of time that the exchange–correlation (xc) function depends exclusively on instantaneous density. Consequently, it can be used for the xc functional derived for ground-state DFT, i.e. BP (Beck-Perdew) and hybrid functional (B3LYP). In TD-DFT calculations, the accuracy of assimilated results mainly relies on the functional and basis set employed for the calculations.36 Fig. S18 (ESI†) depicts the simulated absorption spectra of the dyes T1–4, obtained by employing the B3LYP functional and def-TZVP basis set. These calculations precisely predict the energies related to long-range charge-transfer states due to the self-interaction error embedded in TD-DFT. Furthermore, the simulated spectra of T1–4 display two distinct peaks, corresponding to the mixed π–π* transition and charge-transfer process within the molecules. In all the molecules, there occurs a strong intra-dye electronic excitation, owing to the HOMO → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO+3 transitions. Here, the excitations at the longer wavelengths are due to the electronic transitions from the HOMO to LUMO+1 and LUMO+3. Accordingly, the lower-energy excitations are ascribed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions from T1–4 to TiO2. These details of TD-DFT results demonstrate that the functional and basis set chosen for the studies are well in agreement with experimentally obtained results. Furthermore, the simulated IR-absorption spectra of the dyes T1–4 are depicted in Fig. S19 (ESI†). As expected, both the simulated and experimentally obtained results are well in accordance with each other.
To enlighten the distribution of total charge density at any point in space around the dye molecules, we have plotted ESP maps of T1–4 as shown in Fig. 3. The cavity boundaries in the molecules resemble the density isosurface in the ESP plot, which is associated with total charge distribution including electronegativity, dipole moment, and site of chemical reactivity of the molecule.37–39 The electrostatic potential values represent different colors and they increase in the order, blue > green > yellow > orange > red. The electron-rich and electron-deficient regions are represented by red and blue colours on the plot, which induce positive and negative charges on the cavity surface, further giving rise to local electric fields inside the cavity. From Fig. 3, it is evident that in dyes T1 and T2, the total electron density is mainly concentrated on cyanovinylene, and the carbonyl moiety of cyanoacetic acid, whereas in dyes T3 and T4, the electron density is focussed on cyanovinylene, and the carbonyl moiety of barbituric acid. Thus, the ESP plots clearly demonstrate the movement of electron density from the donor moiety to the anchoring unit via spacer units, thereby favouring the useful electron transfer in T1–4.

According to quantum mechanics, the density of states (DOS) of a system mainly corresponds to the energy levels per unit energy increment. It determines the number of states per specific interval of energy at each energy level that are free to be occupied.40,41 In a simpler way, a high DOS at a particular energy level indicates that there are many states which are available for occupation, whereas zero DOS represents that there are no free states that can be occupied at that particular energy level. In general, the DOS is an average over the time and space domains occupied by the system, and it describes the contribution of different orbitals over different ranges of energy. The DOS plots of T1–4 are depicted in Fig. S20–S23 (ESI†). All the dyes T1–4 exhibit significant charge transfer from donor to acceptor units confirming that they meet the basic prerequisites of an ideal sensitizer.
Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of synthesized dyes (T1–4) were recorded in 10−5 M conc. N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) solution at room temperature. Their spectra are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding spectral data are summarized in Table 2. The spectra exhibit two distinct absorption peaks, in which the lower maximum represents π–π* electronic excitation in the range of 280–370 nm, whereas the higher maximum (400–470 nm) corresponds to the electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO and HOMO−1 to LUMO. As shown in Fig. 4a, the organic sensitizers T1 and T2 exhibit similar types of absorption profiles in the range of 402–410 nm, whereas T3 and T4 show absorption profiles in the order of 453–461 nm. The observed major λmax at 402 nm (T1), 410 nm (T2), 453 nm (T3), and 461 nm (T4) are attributed to the mixed intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT)/π–π* transition of the chromophores, which was further confirmed by TD-DFT calculations.3 From the results, we emphasize that T2 and T4 show a bathochromic shift when compared to the data of T1 and T3. This redshift is probably due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of barbituric acid and increased alkoxy chain numbers which further extend the conjugation of T2 and T4. So, they show an improved light-harvesting ability in the devices.

The fluorescence emission spectra of the dyes T1–4 are measured in 10−5 M DMF solution by excitation at their respective absorption maxima. Fig. 4b portrays the normalized emission spectra of T1–4 and their resultant spectral data are tabulated in Table 2. All the dyes exhibit a characteristic single emission band in the region of 556–575 nm. The molecule T4 displays λemi of 575 nm, that is slightly more redshifted than that of T1 (556 nm), T2 (566 nm), and T3 (564 nm), which may be due to the presence of strong electron-withdrawing barbituric acid. Furthermore, we calculated Stokes shift values as well as the optical bandgap from the obtained absorption and emission spectral data. The acquired bandgaps of T1–4 are decreasing in the order, 2.58 eV (T2) > 2.51 eV (T1) > 2.37 eV (T3) > 2.31 eV (T4), whereas Stokes shifts are in the increasing order, T3 (111 nm) < T4 (114 nm) < T1 < (154 nm) < T2 (156 nm). It is noted that the Stokes shift values of barbituric acid bearing molecules (T3–4) are smaller than those of cyanoacetic acid based dyes (T1–2), which could result from their higher planarity, and also illustrating smaller conformational changes in the excited state.42,43 Amongst T1–4, T2 has the highest Stokes shift with an appropriate band-gap and thus, it plays a pivotal role in the light-harvesting phenomenon of solar cells.
Furthermore, in order to comprehend the light-harvesting ability of dyes in the fabricated devices, the dyes were adsorbed on the TiO2 surface in a separate experiment and the UV-vis spectra of adsorbed dyes were obtained. The absorption spectra of T1–4 adsorbed on TiO2 films are depicted in Fig. 5. From the spectra, it is evident that all the dyes have displayed somewhat broader bands than their corresponding absorption peaks in the solution state. Besides, the λmax of T1 and T2 are effectively redshifted by 118 and 120 nm, respectively, when compared to the results obtained from their DMF solutions. However, T3 and T4 exhibit a hypsochromic shift of 23 nm and 33 nm, respectively, in comparison to the results obtained from their DMF solutions. This observation may be due to the deprotonation of the anchoring moiety as well as the possible formation of H-aggregation of dye on the TiO2 surface.44 The broadened absorption bands and bathochromic shift (redshifted spectra) are ascribed to the interaction of the anchoring group of the dye molecule with titanium ions on the electrode surface and delocalisation of the molecules that effectively reduces the overall energy of the π* orbital.8 Among all dyes, T2 exhibits the highest redshift in an extended region, indicating that it has a strong tendency to form J-type aggregation on the TiO2 surface. This is mainly accredited to the close interaction of the carboxylic functionality of the anchor and Ti4+ ions of the semiconductor. Convincingly, the dye molecule T2 can be considered as a potential candidate in terms of the light-harvesting ability due to its superior anchoring strength as well as alkoxy chain strength.22
 Fig. 5  UV-vis absorption spectra of T1–4 adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. 
In any sensitizer, the donor–acceptor capabilities can be altered by treating it separately with an acidic and basic medium. In order to figure out the acid–base equilibrium of T1–4 in the respective dye solution, the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in 10−5 M DMF solution containing 30% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA for acidic) and 30% triethylamine (TEA for basic). Their absorption and emission spectra are shown in Fig. S24–S31 (ESI†). When dyes T1–4 are dissolved in an acidic medium such as TFA-DMF, there is a possibility of protonation of carboxylate ions of dyes into the neutral form causing a redshift in the absorption spectrum of the dyes. On the other hand, in basic medium (TEA-DMF), generally, deprotonation of the dye molecule occurs and hence it minimizes the withdrawing ability of the acceptor, resulting in a blueshift of the spectra. Thus, the results reveal that the donor–acceptor ability of the dyes T1–4 is very sensitive to the acidic and basic medium.
In order to get a deeper insight into the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) phenomenon inside the dye molecule, the solvatochromic behavior of T1–4 in solvents with different polarities was examined. The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of all the dyes were measured in four different solvents with varying solvent polarities such as THF, chloroform, acetonitrile, and DMSO media at a concentration of 10−5 M in an ambient atmosphere. The solvatochromic absorption spectra of T1–4 in four solvents with different polarity ratios starting from the less polar THF to the highly polar DMSO are shown in Fig. 6a–d. It was noticed that there is only a slight variation in the absorption spectra of the dye molecules with increasing polarity, indicating an effective dipole moment and a non-polar ground state associated with it. Nevertheless, all the dyes exhibit a monotonic bathochromic shift with the increasing polarity of solvents. As seen in the spectra, the dye T4 (481 nm) shows an enhanced positive solvatochromic absorption in all the solvents, especially in the most polar DMSO, when compared to T1 (436 nm), T2 (438 nm), and T3 (480 nm). From the results, it is worth noting that there exists a prominent intramolecular charge-transfer from the donor moiety towards anchoring units in the excited state of the molecule, demonstrating that the dyes T1–4 exhibit a polar excited state with a large associated dipole moment.

Fig. 7a–d displays the fluorescence emission spectra of T1–4 in four solvents having different polarity ratios. With increasing solvent polarity, there is a significant change in the emission spectra of all the dyes. Seemingly, the dye T4 (578 nm) shows the maximum emission intensity when compared to the rest of the molecules T1 (558 nm), T2 (563 nm), and T3 (568 nm) in DMSO, which can be observed through the naked eye with the colors changing from pale yellow (T1) to orange-red (T4) as shown in Fig. 7e. The increased emission in T4 is likely due to the presence of barbituric acid as a strong electron acceptor and increased alkoxy chain strength in the donor moiety which further boosts the conjugation to a greater extent. The Stokes shift values of T1–4 in all the four solvents were calculated and the corresponding results are tabulated in Table 3. Hence, the results demonstrate that all the molecules display satisfactory positive solvatochromism and can be used as an efficient light harvesting source in solar cells.45Fig. 7f shows the emission of the dyes under 360 nm UV light.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the dyes T1–4 were studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The TGA plots of T1–4 are shown in Fig. 8 along with the DSC plot of dye T3 (Fig. S32, ESI†). All the synthesized dyes exhibit satisfactory thermal stability with high thermal decomposition (Td) temperatures at 244 °C (T1), 298 °C (T2), 340 °C (T3), and 338 °C (T4). The quantity of carbonized residue was found to be less than 50% at 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere, due to their moderate aromatic content. The dyes T3 and T4 carrying barbituric acid show higher thermal stability than T1 and T2. Thus, because of their promising thermal properties, their application as sensitizers would result in a good stability of the devices.

Electrochemical characterization
The feasibility of thermodynamically allowed transfer of electrons from the excited state of the dye molecule to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and its easy regeneration by avoiding the charge recombination between photo-injected electrons in the CB of TiO2 and oxidized dye molecules can be effectively studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV).5,22 The experiments were performed using a conventional three-electrode system, in which a platinum disc, glassy carbon, and Ag/AgCl serve as the passive, working, and reference electrodes, respectively.36 The potentials were measured in acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a supporting electrolyte, i.e. tetra n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in an ambient atmosphere. The generated voltammograms of T1–4 are depicted in Fig. S33 (ESI†). Using the experimental CV data, we have calculated GSOP/HOMO energy levels from the onset oxidation potential of the oxidation peak using eqn (1) and the values obtained for all the dyes are summarized in Table 4. Accordingly, they were found to be −5.43 eV (T1), −5.45 eV (T2), −5.44 eV (T3), and −5.41 eV (T4). HOMO = −[Eoxdonset + 4.7 eV](1) LUMO = E0–0 + HOMO(2)

The experimental GSOP/HOMO values were found to be lower than that of the redox potential of the I3−/I− electrolyte system (−5.2 eV), suggesting that all the dyes can provide a driving force for their quick ground state regeneration. The dye T2 has the highest positive potential among all, which may be due to the presence of the better electron-donating bisdodecyloxyphenyl group along with a strong acceptor. Furthermore, the exited state oxidation potential (ESOP) values were calculated from their ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) values and optical band gaps E0–0 and respective values in volts (V) against NHE were converted into electron volts (eV) using eqn (2). Table 4 depicts the estimated ESOP values of all the dyes and Fig. 9 shows the pictorial representation of their energy level diagram. As seen from the table, their ESOPs are −2.92 eV (T1), −2.87 eV (T2), −3.07 eV (T3), and −3.1 eV (T4), which are greater than the potential of the CB of TiO2 (−4.2 eV) indicating good electron injection from the excited state of the dye molecule to the CB of the TiO2.46 Thus, the dye T2 satisfies the stringent requirement which is mandatory for the affirmative transition of charges throughout the photo-electronic conversion cycle. Furthermore, it is observed that T2 has the lowest GSOP and ESOP values among the dyes and thus, provides an adequate thermodynamic driving force for the electron injection as well as dye regeneration. This may be attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of cyanoacetic acid along with the increased alkoxy chain strength of T2. Its D–A strength thermodynamically drags electrons from the LUMO energy level, and injects into the CB edge of the TiO2 and HOMO energy level towards the redox electrolyte. Thus, T2 satisfies the basic requirements which facilitate the affirmative transition of charges throughout the photo-electronic conversion cycle.

To investigate the thermodynamic feasibility of dye injection, recombination, and regeneration processes of T1–4, the free energies (ΔGinj, ΔGrec, and ΔGreg) were estimated using eqn (3)–(5) and the corresponding data are given in Table 4. ΔGinj = EOX* − ECB(3) ΔGrec = ECB − EOX(4) ΔGreg = EI3−/I− − EOX(5)
The free energy values for electron injection into the CB of TiO2 of the dyes T1–4 were calculated from the difference between the LUMO level of the dyes and the CB of TiO2 and are in the order T2 (−1.33 eV) > T1 (−1.28 eV) > T3 (−1.13 eV) > T4 (−1.10 eV). From these results, one can predict that the dye T2 can inject electrons into the CB of TiO2 more efficiently than the other dyes. The calculated ΔGrec values of dyes T1–4 are −1.23 eV (T1), −1.25 eV (T2), −1.24 eV (T3), and −1.21 eV (T4). Similarly, ΔGreg values of dyes T1–4 are in the order, T2 (−0.35 eV) > T3 (−0.34 eV) > T1 (−0.33 eV) > T4 (−0.31 eV). From the results, it is clear that the dye T2 comprising two alkoxy chains shows the highest negative free energy for the electron regeneration process to resist its recombination between injected electrons and photo-oxidized dye molecules, indicating the thermodynamic spontaneity of this step. As reported earlier, the presence of two alkoxy chains in its structure would form a hydrophobic layer over the dye in order to protect it against water ingression from the electrolyte.8,47 Thus, the increased alkoxy chain strength may function as an electrically insulating barrier, thereby minimizing interfacial charge recombination in the DSSCs. Conclusively, all the dyes show nearly the same negative values of free energy changes demonstrating a good balance in the thermodynamic properties of various electronic processes.
Photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance studies
In order to evaluate the structure–performance correlations of the dyes in-depth, the photoelectrochemical parameters of the DSSCs sensitized with T1–4 were determined as per the procedure described in the ESI.† All the devices were fabricated and characterized under similar conditions in order to get accurate and reliable comparisons. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics curves of the DSSCs fabricated with T1–4 sensitizers and a liquid electrolyte in acetonitrile under AM 1.5 full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) illumination are shown in Fig. 10a and the relevant device performance data are tabulated in Table 5. The overall PCE of the sensitizers T1–4 was derived by means of eqn (6). (6)where Pin is the power of incident light, JSC is short-circuit current density, VOC is the open-circuit voltage and FF is the fill factor. The I–V measurements of DSSCs were performed using a black metal mask with an active area 0.18 cm2 to resist current overestimation due to the multiple irradiations. It is apparent that the device fabricated using dye T2 as the photosensitizer displays the highest PCE of 1.19% (JSC = 3.64 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.51 V, and FF = 64.49%) among the other devices T1 (JSC = 2.26 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.47 V, FF = 50.09% and η = 0.54%), T3 (JSC = 0.64 mAcm−2, VOC = 0.45 V, FF = 74.33% and η = 0.22%), and T4 (JSC = 0.66 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.48 V, FF = 74.63% and η = 0.24%). The higher PCE of T2 can be assigned to significant electron extraction from the electron-rich donor moiety followed by electron injection into the CB of TiO2 by a strong cyanoacetic acid anchoring group. Besides, the presence of long alkoxy chains significantly reduces the extent of hydration on the TiO2 surface. Remarkably, T2 shows the highest JSC among all, which can be attributed to the enhanced charge collection at the adjacent contacts and the favorable negative free energy of electron injection (ΔGinj) from the sensitizers to the CB edge of TiO2 as explained earlier (Table 5). The lower JSC of T1, T3, and T4 may be ascribed to the poor adsorption of dyes on the TiO2 surface, resulting in the low light-harvesting capacity of the cell. Indeed, the presence of long alkoxy chains in the structure can retard the recombination dynamics, resulting in a significant increase in the VOC value and overall device performance. The enhanced VOC of T2 is mostly due to the relative minimization of interfacial electron recombination losses. From the results, it is evident that all the dyes exhibit FF in the range of 50–75%. The substantial reduction of FF in the case of T1 and T2 could be attributed to the minor interfacial charge recombination, which may be a result of the relatively higher series and lower shunt resistance.

In general, the various above-said photovoltaic parameters significantly depend on the interfacial charge recombination, carrier transport processes, electron lifetime in the CB of semiconductor TiO2 (τeff) and IPCE of the fabricated DSSCs.23 The origin of the change in photocurrent density is investigated by measuring the IPCE spectra of the fabricated devices using a QEX10 spectral response measurement system. Fig. 10b displays the IPCE spectra of DSSCs fabricated using T1–4 dyes. The IPCE values are calculated using eqn (7). IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ϕreg × ηcc(7)where LHE corresponds to the light-harvesting efficiency of the DSSC and is given by LHE = 1 − 10−A, A is the absorbance of the photoanode which is the same as the oscillator strength, and Φinj, Φreg, and ηcc are the electron injection, regeneration, and charge collection efficiencies, respectively.13 The integrated current calculated from the IPCE spectra were found to be 2.06, 3.61, 0.637 and 0.658 mA cm−2 for dyes T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively (Fig. S34, ESI†). The measured JSC values of all devices are well consistent with the integrated current density values estimated from the IPCE spectra indicating that the emission of our solar simulator is in coordination with the spectrum of standard air mass 1.5 illumination.48,49 From Fig. 10b, it is clear that the dye T2 exhibits the highest JSC value, which may be due to the good adsorption capacity of the dye onto the TiO2 surface through the strong cyanoacetic acid acceptor, which in turn directly influences the electron injection. Besides, the increase in the alkoxy chains can modulate the energetics of electron injection, and hence the increase in the alkoxy chain strength together with the strong anchoring unit yields the best overall performance in DSSCs. Also, the increased IPCE nature of T2 in a longer wavelength region is correlated with its better current density value. Similarly, the IPCE maximum of T1 is 41% (310–471 nm), T2 is 34% (300–450 nm), T3 is 47% (300–405 nm), and T4 is 37% (300–410 nm). Nevertheless, T3 and T4 exhibit relatively lower IPCE values compared to T1 and T2, which can be attributed to the insufficient adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface due to the weak anchoring nature of barbituric acid. The observed IPCE behavior of all the dyes is in accordance with the UV-vis absorption spectra of T1–4 adsorbed on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we infer that the hydrophobic bisdodecyloxy chains of T2 are capable of furnishing enhanced spatial separation between electrons and holes, resulting in the retardation of electron recombination kinetics and thereby increasing the device performance.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the techniques used to characterize the interfacial charge transfer process across the interfaces and is predominantly used to investigate the interfacial charge recombination and the carrier transport process, and to measure the electron lifetime (τeff) in the fabricated DSSCs. In this study, the electron transfer in the TiO2 electrode, I3− transport in the electrolyte and the charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface are noteworthy. The impedance spectra of dyes T1–4 were measured under the light conditions of AM 1.5G illumination over a frequency range of 100–200 kHz at 298 K and the applied forward bias voltage was set at the VOC with amplitude 10 mV. Fig. 11a depicts Nyquist plots obtained at the open-circuit voltage for fabricated devices measured under air mass 1.5 Sun illumination and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). In the case of sensitization, the capacitance (Cμ) and CPt in the equivalent circuits have been replaced with the constant phase element (CPE).50 In the Nyquist plots (Fig. 11a), the series resistance (Rs) represents the higher frequency intercept on the real axis of the semi-circle, whereas the high-frequency region gives the interface capacitance (CPt) and charge-transport resistance (RPt) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface.51,52 Generally, the higher the RPt value, the more difficult it is for the injected electrons to transfer from the TiO2 semiconductor to the electrolyte, which indicates the suppression of back recombination in the process. Hence, the large RPt value of dye T2 facilitates enhanced VOC (Table S1, ESI†).53 The Nyquist traces of all the dyes show that a single semicircle appears in the middle of the frequency range, which corresponds to the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In a simpler way, it is a measure of electron transfer through the semiconducting TiO2 and back electron transfer from TiO2 to the redox electrolyte.54–56 Usually, a larger radius of the semicircle indicates superiority in the recombination resistance (Rct) from the TiO2 electrolyte (Nernst impedance), whereas a smaller radius of the semicircle represents a resistance to charge diffusion (Rd) under Gerischer impedance.13 From Fig. 11a, it is evident that T3 and T4 follow the Nernst impedance, whereas T1 and T2 show the Gerischer impedance. In the present study, the radius of the semicircle obtained for T1–4 is increasing in the order, T1 < T2 < T4 < T3, indicating that the electron recombination resistance decreases in the order of T1 > T2 > T4 > T3 since the type of impedance involved is Greischer impedance. The VOC values of the DSSCs were found to be decreasing in the order of T2 (0.51 V) >T4 (0.48 V) > T1 (0.47 V) > T3 (0.45 V). According to the principle of Nernst and Gerischer impedance, the VOC of T1 and T2 are higher than that of T3 and T4, and these values are well in accordance with the experimentally obtained values (J–V data). Hence, dye T2 achieved the highest VOC value due to the increased electron injection, high resistance towards recombination rate and thus the highest PCE.
 Fig. 11  EIS spectra of devices sensitized with T1–4: (a) Nyquist plots, (b) Bode phase plots, (c) Bode magnitude plots. 
Furthermore, Fig. 11b and c depict the Bode angle phase plots and Bode amplitude plots obtained for the fabricated devices using T1–4. The effective lifetime (τeff) of the electron in the CB edge of TiO2 can be calculated with the help of Bode frequency plot using eqn (8), and the corresponding results are tabulated in Table 5. (8)where fmax is the frequency of the corresponding midpoint in the Bode angle phase plot.13 Here, the longer τeff represents a lower electron recombination rate and thus leads to an improved VOC. From the results, it is clear that the lifetimes of T1–4 are decreasing in the order, T4 (0.564 ms) > T3 (0.557 ms) > T2 (0.531 ms) > T1 (0.345 ms). So, we can infer that the dyes T3 and T4 bearing barbituric acid display slightly higher electron lifetimes than those of T1–2, indicating a suppressed recombination rate. However, the observed lower VOC of T3–4 may be due to the reduced electron injection and regeneration rate. T1 exhibits the smallest electron lifetime, demonstrating insufficient coverage of dye on the TiO2 surface. The dye T2 bearing hydrophobic alkoxy chains and a strong anchor, because of its V-shaped structure can orient more perpendicularly to the TiO2 surface, facilitating a fast electron injection. Thus, among the dyes, T2 with favorable molecular structure exhibits the highest photovoltaic performance, which can be explained on the basis of the electron injection and regeneration process. Furthermore, from Fig. 11c, we can conclude that T1 exhibits the lowest magnitude at lower frequency region evidencing an increased recombination rate, whereas T3 exhibits the highest magnitude because of the high recombination resistance offered by it. Bode magnitude plots display a similar trend to Bode phase plots, but this has not been reflected in their PCE due to the poor anchoring nature of T3 and T4.
To study the anchoring behaviour of the dyes T1–4 on the TiO2 surface, FTIR spectral analysis was carried out for both free and adsorbed dyes. A set of empirical rules was proposed by Deacon–Phillips to examine the binding mechanism of anchoring groups of sensitizers on the TiO2 surface. This rule introduces an important parameter Δν, which is the frequency splitting of surface-bound stretching bands, asymmetric, and symmetric vibrations. Here, two cases are compared, Δν for dyes in the solid state, Δνsolid, and Δν for adsorbed dyes, Δνads. If Δνads > Δνsolid, the dye molecule follows a monodentate binding mode; if Δνads < Δνsolid, then the bidentate bridging mode is preferred; if Δνads ⋘ Δνsolid, the chelating mode is most likely to be present. In the study, we have recorded the FT-IR spectra of dyes T1–4 both in the free form as well as adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. Fig. S36 (ESI†) shows the FTIR spectrum of T2 adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. It shows clear bands at 1570 cm−1 and 1511 cm−1 corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the carbonyl group of the anchoring unit and confirms that the dye is chemisorbed rather than physisorbed. Furthermore, it has been proposed that T2 adsorbs on TiO2 in a bidentate bridging mode rather than the ester-type linkage. These observations confirm the deprotonation mechanism as well as the participation of the carboxylic acid moiety in the adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 surface. Interestingly, the cyano group does not participate in the dye adsorption mechanism, as its peak position remains unchanged in both free and adsorbed states. Furthermore, the FT-IR spectra of the adsorbed dyes T1, T3, and T4 on the TiO2 surface display similar trends as shown in Fig. S37–S39 (ESI†), respectively.
Co-sensitization studies
The photocurrent–voltage curves of DSSCs fabricated using T1–4 dyes as co-sensitizers along with a ruthenium-based dye MH-12 are shown in Fig. 12a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 6. The detailed experimental procedure is given in the ESI.† The J–V measurements were performed by using a black metal mask with an aperture active area of 0.18 cm2 to avoid current overestimation due to its multiple irradiations. Interestingly, the co-sensitizer T3 (i.e.T3 + MH-12) shows a higher PCE of 8.79% (JSC = 21.69 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.632 V, and FF = 64.27%) than the MH-12 dye alone (η = 8.18%, JSC = 20.26 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.644 V, and FF = 59.10%). Nevertheless, the dye T1 (i.e.T1 + MH-12) exhibits a PCE of 8.01% (JSC = 20.64 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.613 V, and FF = 63.21%),T2 (i.e.T2 + MH-12) shows a PCE of 6.80% (JSC = 16.67 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.616 V, and FF = 66.21%), and T4 (i.e.T4 + MH-12) displays a PCE of 8.17% (JSC = 20.07 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.629 V, and FF = 64.25%). It is worth noting that the device fabricated by co-sensitization with T3 shows an excellent performance with more than ∼7% increment compared to the MH-12 sensitized device (8.18%). This may be attributed to the fact that the recombination of photo injected electrons is significantly hindered by the hydrophilic dodecyloxy chain barrier of T3. Generally, the bulky molecules of MH-12 dye adsorb inadequately on the surface of the semiconducting metal oxide leaving behind the larger voids between adsorbed molecules. These created voids would now be covered uniformly by the small molecules of the co-sensitizer, providing a larger surface area for light harvesting. Furthermore, the uniform dye adsorption on the TiO2 surface drastically reduces dye aggregation of MH-12 as well as back-reaction of the I3−/I− on the TiO2 surface inside the device.

The enhanced JSC and FF values of T3 may be attributed to its strong intermolecular interactions causing efficient electron injection and charge transport towards the electrodes. On the contrary, the minor reduction in the VOC compared to control can be attributed to the lowering of the TiO2 Fermi level. Furthermore, the poor device performance in the case of T2 and T3 is ascribed to reduced electron injection which is because of inhomogeneous dye loading on the TiO2 surface caused by the folding of long bisdodecyloxy chains. Also, in T4 alkoxy chains failed to orient perpendicularly onto the TiO2 surface in the voids created by MH-12, and thereby providing a reduced surface coverage on the TiO2 surface.
The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE, 0–100%) of the fabricated DSSCs using T1–4 dyes as co-sensitizers along with the reference dye MH-12 are shown in Fig. 12b. The calculated integrated JSC values of MH-12 alone and co-sensitized using T1–4 were found to be 20.43 mA cm−2 (MH-12), 20.68 mA cm−2 (T1), 16.59 mA cm−2 (T2), 21.55 mA cm−2 (T3), and 19.86 mAcm−2 (T4), respectively (Fig. S35, ESI†). The measured JSC values of all devices are in good consistency with the integrated current density values as estimated from the IPCE spectra of co-sensitized devices indicating that the emission of our solar simulator is in coordination with the spectrum of standard air mass 1.5 illumination.48 The results obtained from the IPCE spectra are in agreement with current–voltage measurements. The spectrum of the device with T3 + MH-12 shows the most intense external quantum efficiency in a broad spectrum of 300–800 nm with a maximum value of 55.4% at 421 nm compared to the reference dye MH-12 (46% at 442 nm). Similarly, the IPCE maximum of T1 is 47% at 428 nm, T2 is 36% at 419 nm, and T4 is 51% at 420 nm. Among the dyes, T2 exhibits the lowest IPCE and PCE values. The possible reason for this is an increased spatial separation of the dye LUMO level occupied in the excited state from the TiO2 surface as well as the poor orientation of T2 in between bulky MH-12 dye molecules adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface. Interestingly, T3 with a mono dodecyloxy chain shows superior anchoring onto the TiO2 surface compared to MH-12, which may be due to the greater flexibility in binding orientation. This kind of reorientation effect caused by T3 and wrapping the Ru-centre of MH-12 with aliphatic long-chains could account for the enhancement in the irradiative process as well as the retardation of the recombination reaction.
Furthermore, EIS measurements of co-sensitized devices with T1–4 as well as the reference device sensitized with MH-12 were made to understand various electronic processes involving in energy-conversion. As explained in the earlier section, EIS spectra were obtained (100–200 kHz at 298 K) in terms of Nyquist plots, Bode phase plots, Bode magnitude plots of the devices sensitized with MH-12 alone and co-sensitized using T1–4 and are depicted in Fig. 13. According to the literature, the larger semicircle in Nyquist plots represents the high charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which further indicates the reduced electron recombination at that junction.57 From Fig. 13a, it is clear that the radius of the semicircles is decreasing in the order, MH-12 > T3 + MH-12 > T4 + MH-12 > T1 + MH-12 > T2 + MH-12, which is in accordance with the corresponding order of open-circuit voltage (Table 6) and opposite to the order of dark currents. This trend supports that the dye MH-12 and the dye combination T3 + MH-12 display relatively higher Rrec than other dyes, indicating decreased dark current and thereby resulting in enhanced open-circuit voltage (Table S1, ESI†).58 The RPt value of dye T3 + MH-12 is higher than that of MH-12 alone, showing the efficient filling of voids in between Ru-based MH-12 molecules. Among the dyes T1–4, the co-sensitizer T3 shows enhanced JSC, VOC, and FF values, resulting in excellent device performance, and hence it can be considered as the best co-sensitizer for the MH-12 dye.
 Fig. 13  EIS spectra of devices sensitized with MH-12 alone and co-sensitized using T1–4: (a) Nyquist plots, (b) Bode phase plots, (c) Bode magnitude plots. 
The EIS Bode phase plots of devices sensitized with MH-12 alone and co-sensitized using T1–4 are shown in Fig. 13b. The electron recombination lifetime values were calculated using eqn (8) and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 6. The lifetime of the electron calculated from the Bode phase plot is related to the charge recombination rate at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The electron recombination lifetime values are decreasing in the order MH-12 (1.06 ms) > T3 + MH-12 (0.72 ms) > T4 + MH-12 (0.65 ms) > T2 + MH-12 (0.57 ms) > T1 + MH-12 (0.56 ms), and are in good accordance with experimental VOC values (Table 6). From the results, it is clear that MH-12 and T3 + MH-12 display the longest lifetime, which can be attributed to the back reaction of injected electrons in the TiO2 band with the I3−/I− electrolyte.

Fig. 13c depicts the Bode magnitude plots of devices sensitized with MH-12 alone and co-sensitized using T1–4 and the observed trend is similar to that of the Bode phase plot. From the figure, we can infer that the magnitude of the dyes is increasing in the order T3 + MH-12 < MH-12 < T1 + MH-12 < T4 + MH-12 < T2 + MH-12. From the observed trend, we can conclude that the combination T3 + MH-12 shows the lowest magnitude which in turn exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance through the interface layers and a similar trend is reflected in its PCE value. Conclusively, the addition of the dye T3 as a co-sensitizer of the MH-12 based DSSC effectively suppresses the undesirable charge recombination, resulting in enhanced performance when compared to other dyes.
Reproducibility of devices
In order to ascertain the reproducibility of device performance data, a set of 15 devices were fabricated using the same procedure (as given in the ESI†) and tested. The thickness of each layer was kept constant. The statistical distribution of various photovoltaic parameters (JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE) recorded for the tested devices is shown in Fig. 14. Evidently, among all the solar cells fabricated, the devices made using T3 as a co-sensitizer are found to be much superior in terms of performance and reproducibility, due to the facts explained in earlier paragraphs.

Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized four new push–pull type thiophene-based chromophores T1–4 carrying the dodecyloxyphenyl/bisdodecyloxyphenyl group as the electron donor, cyanovinylene linked with the thiophene system as the π-spacer, and cyanoacetic acid/barbituric acid as the electron acceptor/anchoring unit, for DSSC application. Based on their in-depth optical, electrochemical, thermal, and theoretical studies, dyes T1–4 were shown to possess all the prerequisites to act as worthy sensitizers/co-sensitizers in the devices. Accordingly, the devices were fabricated by employing each of them as a sensitizer and a co-sensitizer along with a Ru-based MH-12 dye and their device performance parameters were evaluated with emphasis on the structure–performance correlation studies. Amongst T1–4, the dye containing a bisdodecyloxy phenyl donor unit connected to a cyanoacetic acid acceptor (T2) displayed the highest PCE of 1.19% (JSC = 3.64 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.51 V, and FF = 64.49%). The superiority of T2 can be assigned to the presence of two long alkoxy chains on the donor part that significantly reduces the extent of hydration of the TiO2 surface, and enhances the electron-donating strength and presence of powerful electron-withdrawing cyanoacetic acid favoring the thermodynamic feasibility of dye injection, recombination, and regeneration processes. Furthermore, the co-sensitization results of T1–4 (0.2 mM) in the devices revealed that T3 bearing barbituric acid as an anchoring group displayed the highest PCE of 8.79% (JSC = 21.69 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.632 V, and FF = 64.27%) with IPCE < 55%, which is much higher than that of MH-12 dye alone (8.18%). Since its molecules orient perpendicularly and cover the voids created by MH-12 uniformly on TiO2, T3 provides a larger surface area for light-harvesting in the cell. Besides, its uniform adsorption on the TiO2 surface drastically reduces dye-aggregation of MH-12 as well as back-reaction of I3−/I− on the semiconductor surface inside the device. Thus, we strongly believe that this work paves the way to a better molecular design strategy of organic dyes to further ameliorate DSSC performance.
