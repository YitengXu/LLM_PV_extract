Introduction
Graphene is currently a rock star material in nanotechnology, stealing centre stage from its nano-carbon sibling, the carbon nanotube, with a Nobel Prize win (Physics 2010, awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov) and riding high on a landslide of publications dedicated to its study. However, to successfully graduate from the laboratory and fulfill its promised destiny as a revolutionary of the energy, semiconductor, and thermal management industries, graphene needs to become relevant at larger scales. This requires increasing the size of graphene itself and developing large-scale industrial metrology techniques. Graphene was first synthesized as micron-sized flakes in 2004 through mechanical exfoliation of graphite. Although the size limitation of mechanically exfoliated graphene inhibits its industrial application, many promising alternative synthesis techniques have been developed that can create larger graphene sheets. These techniques include chemical reduction of graphene oxide (rGO), thermally induced epitaxial growth, and growth of graphene through chemical vapour deposition (CVD), among many others. While rGO produces small graphene flakes, epitaxial- and CVD-growth can produce large graphene sheets. Epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) substrates has shown promise for radio-frequency graphene-based transistors due to high charge carrier mobility.1–3 However, controlling the thickness of epitaxial graphene over a large region is still a challenge. Currently, CVD-growth of graphene appears to be the most promising synthesis technique for industrial applications, such as transparent and flexible contacts, allowing high-throughput production of large, uniform graphene sheets.4
With the addition of high-throughput synthesis to graphene's repertoire, the primary obstacle for widespread industrial use is now large-scale industrial metrology. There are many techniques for characterizing graphene that measure a wide range of properties. In industry, the primary need is for characterization of specific properties against metrics of interest. For the energy, semiconductor, and thermal management industries, the most important metrics are: layers, edge structure, defects, Fermi level, and thermal conductivity. When a characterization method measures one of these metrics, it can be considered a metrology technique.
The challenge in graphene metrology is mainly due to the dimensionality of the graphene sheet. Although the topic of whether nanomaterials should be officially defined is highly contested,5,6 the widely accepted definition states that materials with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm can be considered nanomaterials. Graphene qualifies as a nanomaterial because the height of a single sheet is ∼0.4 nm.7 However, the width and length of a graphene sheet can vary drastically. Production of CVD graphene sheets up to nearly 1 m has been reported,8 although centimetre scale sheets are more common. The large discrepancy between the height and the expanse of CVD graphene makes the task of graphene metrology very challenging. Currently, most metrology techniques focus on the small scale, where they can resolve the chemical structure of graphene. However, some large-scale metrology techniques that detect enhanced optical contrast of graphene have been introduced.
For industrial applications, metrology techniques must be quick, repeatable, and conclusive. Additionally, they should allow measurement of the entire region of interest on the substrate required for the given industrial application (e.g. glass substrates for solar cells). Therefore an industrial metrology technique should be high-throughput, scalable to allow characterization of entire large-area CVD graphene samples, insensitive to environmental factors or substrate interactions, and quantified for automated decision making, in addition to measuring the metrics of interest.
For the semiconductor and energy industries, the electrical performance of a graphene sheet, such as charge carrier mobility and sheet resistance, is of primary concern. These properties can be probed through electrical characterization, typically performed on a graphene field effect transistor (FET).7,9–11 Additionally, the thermal conductivity of graphene can be measured for the thermal management industry by integrating graphene into a thermal circuit.12 However, these characterization techniques require an extensive fabrication process to create the desired device, making them extremely low-throughput. This introduces the need for faster and easier metrology solutions which do not require fabrication steps. In this review, we introduce and summarize these metrology solutions, describing which metrics they measure and their suitability for an industrial metrology technique. Although each technique has benefits, none of the current metrology techniques meet all of the requirements for industrial applications. Recently, we developed and demonstrated a graphene metrology technique that allows repeatable, quick, and easy identification of layer thickness and uniformity of large-area CVD graphene sheets on arbitrary substrates. This technique, and its promise for industrial graphene metrology, is covered in detail. With the development of this industry-ready metrology technique, graphene is one step closer to wide-spread adoption in industrial applications.

Electron microscopy
Electron microscopy employs an electron beam and is performed in a vacuum chamber to minimize random electron scattering. The two primary forms of electron microscopy are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Typical results obtained from electron microscopy investigation of graphene are shown in Fig. 1. In TEM, electrons passing through sample are detected. TEM offers a sensitive, atomic-resolution imaging solution for characterizing graphene at the cost of extensive sample preparation. Due to the sensitivity of this technique, graphene must be suspended over a gap or hole in the imaging substrate. TEM imaging of graphene is further complicated because the electron energy must be reduced to avoid damaging the graphene sample. This has lead to many creative TEM imaging solutions, such as aberration-corrected TEM13–15 and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM).16

TEM has been used to show the atomic structure of suspended exfoliated graphene (Fig. 1A),17 rGO,18 and CVD graphene19 membranes and can study edge structure.20 Further, TEM can investigate graphene layer stacking faults,21 defects in graphene15,22 and even reveal charge-transport effects of doping.23 Combining image processing techniques with TEM imaging has enabled the effect of nitrogen doping on CVD graphene to be studied.23 TEM can also identify graphene layers by imaging a cross-section of the graphene sheet (XTEM). XTEM is achieved by imaging a fold in the graphene sheet (Fig. 1B)17 or cutting the graphene sheet (e.g. using a focused ion beam).24,25 XTEM is considered the most dependable method for identifying graphene layer thickness. Electron diffraction, a TEM technique performed by shifting the imaging focus from the sample to the back focal plane of the microscope, allows observation of the lattice structure through the interference pattern.15,17,26 Interestingly, it has been discovered that graphene makes an excellent support substrate to enable high-resolution TEM investigation of other samples.22
In SEM, the electron beam is raster-scanned over the sample surface and the backscattered or secondary electrons are detected. SEM is a simple and relatively fast imaging technique and is primarily used to visualize graphene sheets and measure their size and uniformity (Fig. 1C and D).27–30 When graphene was first discovered, SEM was used to identify few-layer graphene, which was not distinguishable from single-layer graphene by optical characterization methods available at the time.7 SEM has also been used to identify edge structure in high-quality exfoliated graphene sheets.31 SEM imaging of graphene requires a conductive support substrate. Although it cannot identify layer thickness, SEM is an excellent technique for measuring the size of exfoliated graphene sheets and identifying cracks in the sample due to its fast image formation.
Recently, a new form of electron microscopy, low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) has emerged as a promising technique to allow spatially resolved measurement of graphene thickness. In LEEM, low-energy electrons elastically back-scattered from the sample surface are detected. The electron reflectivity of the graphene sample depends on the electron energy and graphene thickness, indicating that graphene layer thickness can be determined by varying the electron beam energy and recording the reflected intensity.26,32–35 Because the LEEM imaging conditions are compatible with the growth conditions for epitaxial graphene, LEEM is capable of in situ characterization of epitaxial graphene during the growth process.36,37 Like TEM, LEEM can be modified to measure the reciprocal lattice structure by detecting low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) patterns.34,35
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) is a chemically sensitive electron microscopy technique. In AES, the sample is ionized by the electron beam. In the resulting internal relaxation process, electrons are emitted from the sample with energies equal transition energies of the sample. The resulting spectrum reveals the chemical structure of the sample. AES has been used to determine epitaxial graphene layer thickness on the SiC growth substrate by measuring the intensity ratio of the carbon and silicon peaks.38,39 Careful analysis of the AES spectrum along with calibration of the electronic beam has been used to determine of graphene layer thickness on alternate substrates and detect chemical impurities.40
Scanning probe microscopy
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) refers to any microscopy technique that utilizes a probe scanned over the surface of the sample. The most widely used SPM technique is atomic-force microscopy (AFM). Although the lateral resolution of AFM is limited by the probe dimensions (practical limit ∼10 nm), the vertical resolution can reach 0.1 nm and atomic-scale height variations can be detected. AFM is commonly used to identify individual layers in exfoliated (Fig. 2A)7,11 and CVD (Fig. 2B)30,41 graphene. However, drift in the probe height feedback and height variations in the substrate can introduce measurement error over large areas. Additionally, it has been discovered that graphene does not always lay flat against the substrate, with the gap between graphene and the substrate reaching 5–10 Å. This height is significant given that a single layer graphene is ∼4 Å and bi-layer graphene is ∼8 Å.7 Therefore, AFM identification of layers is most reliable at edges, where sharp height variations are easily discernible. In addition to measuring layer height, AFM is also a helpful tool in studying the surface structure of functionalized graphene through both height and phase measurements.42–44 For the most part, AFM is slower than SEM and therefore only used over SEM when layer thickness is of interest.

Another SPM technique that is used for high-resolution imaging of graphene is scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). STM is the famous older sibling of AFM. The inventors of STM (Ernst Ruska and Heinrich Rohrer) shared their 1986 Nobel Prize win with the inventor of the electron microscope (Gerd Binnig) and went on to develop the first AFM. In STM, a conductive tip is kept at a constant bias voltage as it is scanned over the sample. Electrons that tunnel through the vacuum between the probe and the surface are detected as the tunnelling current. This tunnelling current is sensitive to the surface work function and density of states.45,46 Like TEM, the resolution offered by STM allows direct study of the structure of exfoliated graphene (Fig. 2C),47,48 epitaxial graphene,9,38,49 CVD graphene,19,24 and graphene oxide.42 Since STM current depends on density of states,50–52 it has become a very useful technique for studying defects in epitaxial graphene (Fig. 2D),53 CVD graphene,19,24,54 and rGO42 and for studying defects at the edge.55 STM can also be used to measure dopant concentration on the graphene sheet.54 Additionally, scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), where the bias voltage is scanned, allows direct measurement of the Fermi level53,56 and determination of edge structure.57
Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy, which measures inelastic Raman scattering, is a characterization technique with fame to match graphene, having won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 (awarded to Sir C. V. Raman). In Raman spectroscopy, laser light is shone onto the sample and the wavelength shift in the reflected light is recorded. This wavelength shift occurs when the excited molecules in the sample relax to a different vibrational energy level in the ground state, emitting a photon with greater or, more commonly, less energy than the incident photon. The intensity of light versus the wavelength shift is measured as the Raman spectrum. In the case of a homogeneous sample, peaks appear in the Raman spectrum that correlate to bond energies.
Raman spectroscopy has become a gold-standard for graphene characterization. This is due to the sheer quantity and quality of the chemical information given by a Raman spectrum. Raman spectroscopy of graphene was first described by Ferrari et al. in 2006 (Fig. 3A and B).58 There are a number of thorough reviews on the applications and basics of Raman spectroscopy of graphene.59–64 Raman spectroscopy is nearly the perfect tool for graphene metrology because it is sensitive to all of the industrial metrics. Raman can be used to study the change in the Fermi level due to chemical or electrical doping (Fig. 3D)54,65–68 and study edge structures.69,70 Primarily, however, Raman is used study the structure of the graphene sheet and the layer thickness.58,71–75 The ability to quantify defects through Raman has made it an essential tool for studying the quality of CVD graphene, where defects are a common problem (Fig. 3C).24,27,76–79 Finally, Raman can be used to study the thermal conductivity of graphene.80,81 Recently, it was discovered that the sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy can be extended by incorporating graphene into the experimental setup. Single- and few-layer graphene was found to enhance the Raman signal from molecular adsorbates.82

Raman is largely insensitive to substrate and temperature effects (large temperature shifts slightly affect the G peak position).71,83,84 The only limitation that keeps Raman from becoming the gold standard for industrial graphene metrology is its low throughput. While the excitation laser used in Raman spectroscopy can be scanned over the sample to collect spatial Raman maps (Fig. 3E),27–29,72,74,85,86 scanning Raman measurements take a long time because at each collection point 0.5–1 minute is required to collect the Raman spectrum. Mapping a 20 × 20 μm2 exfoliated graphene flake at 1 μm resolution requires nearly 7 hours of continuous Raman scanning. In this sense, Raman is one of the slowest characterization techniques for graphene and cannot adequately characterize an entire large-area CVD graphene sheet.
Photoemission spectroscopy
Photoemission spectroscopy measures the kinetic energy of the sample surface. From the kinetic energy, binding energies can be calculated. In X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray photons are utilized to study atomic core electrons of the sample. XPS joined the rank of distinguished metrology techniques in 1981, when Kai Siegbahn, the inventor of XPS, won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Through the presence and relative height of peaks in the XPS spectrum, the relative composition of elements and electronic structure of graphene can be determined.87 Because the type and concentrations of chemical impurities can readily be measured, XPS is an excellent tool for studying the chemical state of chemically doped CVD graphene8,54,88 and rGO.44,89,90 In the case of doped graphene, the Fermi level can be determined from the dopant type and concentration.54 Generally, spatial maps are not generated from XPS data. Instead, one to three studies on a graphene sample are considered adequate to characterize the chemical state.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a photoemission spectroscopy technique where both the energy and momentum of electrons within the sample are recorded.91 Although ARPES has not attained widespread usage, it is a promising characterization technique because it allows direct mapping of the electronic band structure of the graphene sample.92–94
Optical transmission
The optical transmittance attenuation per graphene layer is 2.3% within the visible spectrum, regardless of the imaging wavelength.95 Therefore, measuring optical transmission through large-area graphene samples on transparent substrates is a promising technique for identifying graphene layer thickness. Generally, transmission measurements are performed utilizing spectrometers which investigate the entire large-area sample with a large spot size. Furthermore, due to limited contrast, exact identification of graphene layer thickness is difficult. However, the high-throughput and simplicity of optical transmission measurements make it a useful technique for estimating the layer thickness of large-area graphene samples.8,10,29
Ellipsometry
Ellipsometry measures the change in polarization in light reflected from the sample surface. Linearly polarized light is used to illuminate the sample at a set angle of incidence. Interaction with the sample causes the resulting reflected light to become elliptically polarized. Comparing the amplitude and phase of the s- and p-polarized components of the incident and reflected light allows calculation of the complex reflection coefficient of the sample. In spectroscopic ellipsometry, the wavelength of the incident light is varied and the complex reflection coefficient spectrum is recorded. While spectroscopic ellipsometry provides more insight into the optical properties of the sample, compared to single-wavelength ellipsometry, achievable resolution is compromised. Achievable resolution of single-wavelength ellipsometry is still less than axial imaging techniques, with 30–50 μm typical resolution and 3–5 μm resolution representing the state of the art for imaging graphene.96 Because ellipsometry can be performed on large regions at low resolution, it can provide averaged information which is helpful in industrial processes where high spatial detail is not needed. Although ellipsometry can provide insight into the optical properties of graphene,97,98 it is primarily used to measure the thickness of graphene sheets, determined from the amplitude of the polarization angle shift. Graphene layer thickness measurements can be performed on many different substrates, although the substrate does change the polarization amplitude shift per layer.96,99,100 Recently, in situ ellipsometry measurements of CVD graphene during the growth process have been reported.101
Optical reflection
Optical reflection is used to identify graphene through differences in refractive index between the graphene and substrate. It is an excellent visualization tool, with the ability to study large areas quickly, and played a key role in the experimental discovery of graphene.7 The imaging substrate used to discover graphene is still the most popular – a silicon (Si) wafer covered with a 300 nm thick silicon-dioxide (SiO2) layer. This oxide layer is instrumental in creating a Fabry–Perot type cavity which maximizes the visibility of graphene through optical interference. Studies on the colour contrast between graphene and the Si/SiO2 substrate and between graphene layers measured the maximum contrast between layers to be 12%.30,74,102–104 Colour contrast in the optical reflection has been used to segment images of exfoliated graphene according to layer thickness103 and to statistically determine the uniformity of CVD graphene.30 In optical reflection, the thickness of the oxide layer is a critical parameter for enhancing contrast.105 At an imaging wavelength of 560 nm, which provides optimal contrast with a 300 nm thick oxide layer, single-layer contrast is reduced from 12% to ∼6% with a 25 nm change in the oxide layer thickness. A change of 37 nm effectively voids contrast enhancement, reducing single-layer contrast to ∼2.3%, the optical transmission attenuation of a single graphene layer.95,106 The silicon wafer also has an impact on the reflected contrast and replacing it with another material changes the contrast.105,107,108
Although some industrial applications, such as semiconductors, utilize Si/SiO2, many require different substrates, such as glass substrates for solar energy. There have been a few studies on characterizing graphene layers through reflection using different substrates, including glass109 and the copper growth substrate.110 These studies demonstrate the promise of reflectance microscopy on alternate substrates, but still fall short of being suitable for reliable layer identification, with only 1% contrast between graphene layers on copper and 7% contrast on glass.
Fluorescence quenching for industrial graphene metrology
In industrial applications, graphene will be embedded as a component of a wide variety of devices, from semiconductor devices to solar cells. Therefore, graphene metrology must be performed in-line with production and on arbitrary substrates. To fit into the production workflow, an industrial metrology technique must be: (1) high-throughput, (2) scalable to allow characterization of entire large-area graphene samples, (3) insensitive to environmental factors or substrate interactions, and (4) quantified for automated decision making. The suitability of the current metrology techniques for industrial metrology according to these criteria is summarized in Table 2. Although all of the metrology techniques covered thus far measure metrics of interest for industry, they fall short of meeting all criteria for industrial applications. Of the techniques covered thus far, optical reflection is the only high-throughput metrology technique. Recognizing the benefit of high-throughput optical reflection metrology, Nolen et al. developed a method for segmenting the optical reflection image of small-area, high-quality exfoliated graphene flakes according to layer thickness to provide quantified results.103 The small size and uniformity of exfoliated flakes simplifies the task of identifying layers, allowing even Raman mapping to achieve layer identification of the entire flake.72 However, the small size of exfoliated graphene also means that industrial interest in the material is limited. Reina et al. were the first to expand quantified optical reflection metrology to CVD graphene, bringing the technique one step closer to industrial use.30 The characterized region was still limited to a subset of the CVD graphene sheet and they did not attempt to segment the image according to layer thickness, instead limiting their analysis to statistical determination of uniformity. This decision may have been due to the difficulty in identifying CVD graphene layers with high confidence. Although it is high-throughput, optical reflection metrology is limited by the achievable contrast between graphene layers, which makes layer identification difficult on a large scale. Furthermore, it is highly sensitive to the imaging substrate, which limits its usefulness in industrial applications.

Recently, we have developed a new graphene metrology technique which is based on fluorescence quenching microscopy (FQM), a novel visualization technique that detects fluorescence quenching by graphene. By quantifying the contrast measured by FQM, we achieved high-throughput metrology of layer thickness and uniformity on arbitrary substrates. We then achieved large-area metrology and quantified results by employing image processing techniques. The resulting metrology technique is well suited to industrial applications (Table 2) and has the following capabilities:
(1) Identification of layer thickness and uniformity.
(2) Characterization of entire large-area CVD graphene sheets.
(3) Repeatable across imaging microscopes and imaging sessions.
(4) Fast collection time.
In the following section we provide a brief introduction to fluorescence quenching by graphene and give an overview of the industrial graphene metrology technique we developed that relies on this property.
Fluorescence quenching by graphene
Fluorescence quenching occurs whenever an energy acceptor is introduced to a fluorescent system. The acceptor provides additional non-radiative pathways for an excited fluorophore (donor) to release its energy, reducing fluorescence radiation. Electrons in the sp2-hybridized orbitals in graphene are easily excited and have π–π* transition energies that fall within the energy range of visible light, making graphene an excellent energy acceptor.111 The two primary mechanisms through which energy is transferred to graphene from a fluorophore in the excited state are Dexter electron transfer and Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET). Dexter electron transfer occurs when the excited fluorophore comes into molecular contact with graphene and their electron wave-functions overlap, allowing electron exchange.112 FRET, on the other hand, is a long-distance quenching mechanism, occurring due to spectral overlap between the fluorophore and graphene. In FRET, the fluorophore and graphene are coupled through a dipole–dipole interaction. Unlike Dexter electron transfer, FRET does not require molecular contact between the fluorophore and graphene and therefore is not sensitive to the electrostatic interaction between the molecules.113 There have been many studies on fluorescence quenching by graphene through Dexter electron transfer114,115 and FRET.116–118 Although these studies do not compare the quenching rates of these processes to determine which is dominant, FRET can be considered to be the dominant process for distances greater than 2 nm due to the short-range interaction required for Dexter electron transfer.
FRET efficiency is based on three factors: (1) distance between the fluorophore and graphene, (2) spectral overlap of the fluorophore emission and graphene absorption, and (3) relative orientation of the fluorophore emission dipole moment and the graphene absorption dipole moment.93–95 In extended systems, the relative dipole orientations can be considered random and an average value can be used, reducing the quenching parameters to distance and spectral overlap. These factors are taken into account in the Förster distance parameter, R0, which is the distance at which quenching is 50% effective. The FRET quenching efficiency E, defined as the fraction of excited molecules that undergo energy transfer from the fluorophore to graphene, is expressed in terms of the Förster distance as113–121 (1)
Although the distance dependence of FRET between two dye molecules (dipole–dipole interaction) is d−6, it is reduced to d−4 between a dye molecule and graphene due to non-localized acceptor states across the two-dimensional graphene plane.113,118,122 Therefore, while classical FRET is usually restricted to 10 nm, FRET involving graphene can occur up to distances of 30 nm.117
Due to the highly effective, long-distance quenching of fluorescence by graphene, it is a promising acceptor material for fluorescence-intensity based biosensors123,124 developed to detect DNA,125–127 proteins,128–130 and other biomolecules.131–134 Additionally, resonant energy transfer to graphene has been used to harvest energy from fluorescent quantum dots135–137 and dye molecules.138,139 Because it is capable of near-absolute quenching of the fluorescence signal that interferes with Raman measurements, graphene can also be used as a substrate to enable Raman measurements of fluorescent materials.140 Recently, however, it has been discovered that a powerful application of fluorescence quenching by graphene is visualizing the graphene itself.
Industrial metrology of CVD graphene using fluorescence quenching microscopy
Fluorescence quenching was first utilized to visualize graphene immobilized on a fluorescent dye-functionalized substrate (Fig. 4A).141 Kim et al. built on this concept, introducing the fluorophores in the form of a fluorescent dye-polymer layer deposited on the graphene and substrate by spin-coating and introduced the term “fluorescence quenching microscopy” to describe this technique (Fig. 4B). FQM allows the contrast of fluorescence quenching to be customized by controlling the dye-polymer layer thickness and can be performed on arbitrary substrates.142,143 Around the same time, Sagar et al. used quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence in PMMA to create a hybrid graphene visualization/fabrication technique, demonstrating the applicability of a fluorescence-based graphene metrology technique in industry.144

Due to its high throughput and controllable contrast, FQM had great potential to be extended beyond the state of other metrology techniques and become truly relevant for industry. To develop FQM into an industrial metrology technique, we made three major improvements: (1) quantification of quenching contrast to identify graphene layers, (2) image segmentation for quick and easy graphene layer identification, and (3) large-scale image collection to measure entire CVD graphene sheets.145 A detailed review of these three improvements is given below. Our industrial graphene metrology technique allows quick and easy identification of thickness and uniformity of entire CVD graphene samples on arbitrary substrates. It is well suited to many industrial applications due to its repeatability and flexibility.

Quantification of graphene layer quenching contrast. 
The conversion of FQM from a visualization technique to a metrology technique required developing a repeatable method for identifying graphene layers. The fluorescence intensity of the graphene layers and the substrate can vary between images due to variations in the illumination intensity. However, the contrast between the graphene layers and the substrate is determined by the quenching factor, which is constant across samples and microscopes and depends only on the dye layer thickness. Therefore, our metrology technique identifies graphene layers based on their contrast compared to the substrate instead of using absolute intensity values.
To achieve consistent quenching contrast across multiple graphene samples and subsequent measurements of a single sample, the dye layer thickness must be repeatable and photobleaching must be avoided. We create a dye layer with controllable and repeatable thickness by spin-coating a dye-polymer solution over the graphene sample. The dye-polymer solution use we use is 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM-pyran) mixed with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in toluene. This dye-polymer solution provides complete dispersion and low evaporation during spin-coating, allowing formation of a uniform layer with repeatable thickness. Additionally, the excitation energy of DCM-pyran is well below the absorption energy of PMMA and the spin-coating behaviour of PMMA dissolved in toluene has been well-studied.146–148 Finally, PMMA is already used as a protection layer during CVD graphene transfer and as the protection film during photolithography. Therefore, it is well known that PMMA does not damage the graphene sample, it is easily washed away with acetone, and many advanced techniques have been developed to ensure complete contaminant removal, if necessary.48,149 Photobleaching of the FQM dye layer is avoided by limiting the illumination intensity of the light source (∼10%), enabling consistent fluorescence contrast for multiple measurements of the same sample.142
In FQM, quenching contrast is controlled by the dye layer thickness. For identification of multiple graphene layers, a 30 nm thick dye layer is ideal. Contrast between graphene layers is reduced with a thinner dye layer, while contrast between graphene and the substrate is reduced with a thicker dye layer. Fig. 5A shows a fluorescence image of CVD graphene. The contrast ranges for graphene layers compared to the substrate with a 30 nm thick dye layer are:

(1) 0.35 ≤ C <0.58, 1 layer.
(2) 0.58 ≤ C <0.75, 2 layers.
(3) 0.75 ≤ C <0.80, 3+ layers.
These ranges are indicated in the histogram of the fluorescence image (Fig. 5C) and show that the contrast per layer decreases as the layer count increases. This decrease in quenching by subsequent layers was also predicted theoretically and observed experimentally in a study on the quenching of fluorescent nanocrystals by graphene.135
Although quenching contrast is determined by the dye layer thickness, its sensitivity to layer thickness is attenuated by the large contrast between graphene layers. Multiple measurements of a single graphene sheet with different dye layer thicknesses found the quenching contrast of single layer CVD graphene increases from 39% to 74% when the dye layer thickness is reduced from 30 nm to 18 nm, resulting in an average contrast dependence of ∼3% per nm. Alternatively, when the dye layer thickness is increased to 39 nm, contrast is reduced to 33%, or ∼1% per nm on average. The contrast range of single layer graphene is 35–58%, therefore these results indicate that single layer graphene would be correctly identified for a dye layer thickness within 24–35 nm. This is well within the accuracy of the spin-coating technique; therefore contrast sensitivity to thickness does not induce measurement error or impose strict dye layer preparation procedures.


Segmentation of images of entire CVD graphene sheets. 
To allow quick and easy identification of graphene layers, our industrial graphene metrology technique performs segmentation of the FQM image according to graphene layers. Since we already quantified the contrast ranges that define layers, segmentation of the image is performed by assigning individual pixels to graphene layers according to their contrast relative to the substrate. Fig. 5B shows the result our image segmentation of the original fluorescence image (Fig. 5A).
Because fluorescence quenching contrast is repeatable across microscopes and samples, our segmentation technique based on contrast is very reliable. In addition to enabling quick decision making based on the uniformity and thickness of a large-area CVD graphene sample, image segmentation also introduces the potential for automated industrial metrology of graphene.


Large-area image creation. 
One of the many benefits of CVD-grown graphene is that large-area graphene sheets can be synthesized. Therefore, for high-resolution metrology of entire CVD graphene sheets, large-area image creation is required. In our metrology technique, we collect large-area images of an entire CVD graphene sheets by forming a montage of individual images collected using a microscope equipped with a mechanical imaging stage. This large-area image creation technique is easy to implement and highly scalable. The segmented image of an entire centimetre scale CVD graphene sample is shown in Fig. 5D. The original collected montage consists of 1656 individual images and contains 142 million pixels, each covering a 1.24 × 1.24 μm2 region. Collection time for the fluorescence image was 40 minutes and the image correction and segmentation steps were completed in approximately 10 minutes on a standard desktop computer. Sample preparation takes just over one hour (5 minutes to spin-coat the graphene sample and one hour to evaporate the solvent). Therefore, the entire FQM process was completed within two hours. This represents a drastic improvement over Raman characterization, which would take approximately 2 × 106 hours to perform the same measurement. Many industrial applications of large-area CVD graphene, such as transparent electrodes in solar cells, require the quality of the entire graphene sample to be known. With our industrial FQM graphene metrology technique, large-scale metrology for these applications is now possible.

Conclusions and future prospects
In this review, we have covered currently available graphene metrology techniques, identifying the metrics they probe and summarizing their potential for use in industrial metrology. We found that they all fall short of meeting all of the criteria for industrial applications. To increase the use of graphene in industry, high-throughput metrology techniques still needed to be developed. To fill this need, we developed a metrology technique based on fluorescence quenching, which is briefly described in this review. Our graphene metrology technique allows quick and easy identification of graphene layers on arbitrary substrates and is well-suited for many industrial applications.
Some industrial applications may require information about the graphene sheets other than the layer thickness and uniformity. Therefore, incorporation of graphene in industry could be improved by the development of additional high-throughput metrology techniques. Development of new industrial metrology techniques will involve a combination of creating new optical methods for probing the characteristics of graphene and employing advanced digital image processing techniques. While a great deal of work has been put into developing graphene metrology techniques, novel image processing has remained mostly unexplored even though image processing has already benefited current graphene metrology techniques. Frequency filtering enhanced the atomic contrast of graphene in TEM16,23 and STM24 images and simulation allowed determination of density of states in STM images of graphene.53 To aid in image processing of SPM images, an open-source software package was developed and is widely used.150 There are many ways image processing can aid in the development of industrial graphene metrology techniques. The minimum contrast variation visible to the human eye is 1–2%,151 approximately equal to the contrast between graphene layers on glass and copper substrates.109,110 Therefore, optical reflection metrology on these substrates could be improved by employing image processing techniques to digitally enhance contrast. Furthermore, as industry acceptance of graphene becomes wider and graphene metrology is performed regularly, image processing techniques, such as the segmentation employed in our metrology technique, will become more important for automating these metrology techniques for production-line metrology of graphene. While our metrology technique employed contrast thresholding for segmentation, other metrology techniques could benefit from alternate segmentation techniques, such as boundary detection, region growing, and watershed identification.151
