    , Accepted 19th May 2022First published on 25th May 2022AbstractUnderstanding the functionality of the modification layer in regulating the charge transfer process at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is of great significance to the rational design of photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation systems. Herein, by systematically investigating and comparing the charge transfer kinetics behaviors over ferrihydrite (Fh)- and cobalt phosphate (CoPi)-modified hematite (Fe2O3) photoanodes, we unveiled the essential relation between photocurrent enhancement and the charge transfer process. With the hole-storage material Fh as a reference, it was found that CoPi demonstrates high hole-storage capacity at a low bias region (<1.0 V vs. RHE) due to the effective release of Fermi level pinning. Afterwards, the stored holes would be timely injected into the electrolyte for water oxidation, caused by the enhanced charge separation in the presence of CoPi. In contrast, the decoration of Fh can only slightly passivate the surface states and promote hole injection in the high potential region. Subsequently, superior hole-storage capacity in the low-potential region is recognized as a crucial factor for photocurrent enhancement. These combined results provide new insights into the understanding of interfacial charge transfer kinetics.
1. Introduction
The efficient utilization of abundant sunlight via photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells for water splitting is a promising but challenging route to directly convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel.1–3 However, considering the serious interfacial recombination of photogenerated carriers and sluggish kinetics of the surface reaction, the elaborate design of a semiconductor–liquid interface (SCLI) is a great concern for promoting the charge separation process.4–8 To date, numerous studies have demonstrated the factors that suppress PEC performance, including photostability and charge separation efficiency, which are highly related to interfacial issues.9–12
In view of the extremely high reaction barrier for PEC water oxidation due to the complex 4-hole process, tremendous efforts had been devoted to surface modification with water oxidation cocatalysts, which can accelerate the interfacial charge transfer kinetics.13,14 However, the roles of these cocatalysts in integrated photoelectrodes with different underlying light-absorbers are always distinct, ranging from regulating the charge transfer kinetics to altering the interfacial energetics, both of which are decisive in the device performance.8,12,15 However, there has been no unified understanding of the roles for an identical modification layer. For instance, for the typical CoPi-modified Fe2O3 system, Grätzel et al. observed an appreciable cathodic shift of photocurrent onset and considered that the fast hole transfer may contribute to the improvement of the PEC performance.16 By transient absorption measurements, Durrant et al. ascribed the cathodic shift of photocurrent onset to the increased lifetime of surface holes, rather than fast hole transfer kinetics.17 Hamann and Bisquert et al. thought that CoPi may possess dual functionalities, namely charge transfer promotion and enhanced hole concentration accumulation.18 As it is still unclear how the modified layers alter the photogenerated carrier kinetics, it is of significance to understand the origin of photoelectrode performance enhancement by probing the interfacial kinetics.19,20
Hole-storage-layer (HSL) materials including ferrihydrite (denoted as Fh), Ni(OH)x/MoO3, Ni(OH)x/CoOx, and Ni(OH)x/Fh have been demonstrated to be effective in extracting and storing photogenerated holes from the semiconductor, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the PEC durability and activity.21–26 Moreover, some typical water oxidation cocatalysts, such as cobalt phosphate (CoPi) and the NiOOH/black phosphorene bilayer, have also been identified to possess superior hole-extraction ability.27,28 In this regard, it is important to reveal the intrinsic roles of the modification layers in terms of the charge carrier kinetics and interfacial energetics at the SCLI. In addition, the deeper understanding toward the hole-storage behavior is also essential for rationally designing highly efficient photoanode systems.
Herein, we deposited the typical hole-storage material Fh as well as the traditional water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi over Fe2O3 and investigated the underlying mechanisms leading to the enhanced photocurrent upon surface modification. With Fh as a reference, it is found that CoPi can largely promote the extraction and storage of the photogenerated holes in the low-potential region due to the release of Fermi-level pinning and the subsequent suppression of charge recombination. In contrast, Fh can enhance the charge transfer but hardly affects the hole storage capacity of Fe2O3 due to its faint passivation effect for the surface states. Finally, superior hole-storage capacity at low bias is recognized as the crucial reason behind photocurrent enhancement. This work clearly reveals the coupling effect between hole storage and interfacial charge transfer.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as purchased. Solutions were prepared using high purity water (Millipore Milli-Q purification system, resistivity >18 MΩ cm). Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Company (Japan). The FTO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 30 min each in sequence prior to use.
2.2. Sample preparation
The hematite photoanode was prepared in two steps, which is basically consistent with a previous report.29 Firstly, FeOOH was deposited by immersing the FTO substrate in a mixed aqueous solution containing 0.15 M FeCl3·6H2O and 1 M NaNO3 at 90 °C for 3 h in an oven. Afterward, the films were washed with water and then transformed into hematite by annealing in air at 750 °C for 15 min.
The Fh film was decorated on hematite or FTO substrate by a simple chemical bath method.21,30 The thickness of the Fh film was controlled via the reaction time.
The decoration of CoPi film on hematite or FTO substrate was conducted by a previously reported electrochemical deposition method,31 which was held at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a solution containing 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.1 M KH2PO4 at pH = 7.0. The thickness of the CoPi film was controlled via the electric quantity.
2.3. Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were measured by a Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (accelerating voltage of 20 kV). The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/Max 2500/PC powder diffractometer under 40 kV and 200 mA using Cu Kα radiation, with a scan rate of 5 °C min−1. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550). The UV-visible measurements were also coupled with an electrochemical workstation for revealing the reaction intermediate species of the modified layers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done with a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi with a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (accelerating voltage of 12.0 kV, power 240 W).
2.4. Photoelectrochemical measurement
The photoelectrochemical performance was studied using a three-electrode system with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) under the irradiation of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with the prepared electrode, a platinum electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) being used as the working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively.
Light shines into the front side of the photoelectrodes in all the cases. 1.0 M NaOH (pH = 13.6) was used as the electrolyte through this study, and all the measured potentials referring to the SCE or Ag/AgCl were transferred to the reversed hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to eqn (1) and (2). E(RHE) = 0.242 + E(SCE) + 0.059 × pH(1) E(RHE) = 0.196 + E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH(2)
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured under monochromatic light irradiation using a tungsten lamp with a calibrated silicon photodiode.
The stability of the fabricated electrode was measured under illumination at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M NaOH solution under the chronoamperometry model with the same setup mentioned above for the PEC test.
Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) was conducted under the irradiation of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at a series of applied potentials ranging from 0.7 to 1.4 V (vs. RHE) with an amplitude of 5 mV and an AC potential frequency ranging from 105 to 0.1 Hz. The Zview software was used for fitting the obtained data.
IMPS measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (IM6ex, Zahner Company) in a three-electrode configuration. Modulated illumination was provided by a high intensity light-emitting diode (LED: 525 nm) controlled by an LED driver (PP211) that allowed the superimposition of sinusoidal modulation (∼10%) on a DC illumination level.
Faraday efficiency tests of oxygen production for Fe2O3-based photoanodes were carried out in a closed three-electrode system configuration. The applied potential was set as 1.23 V vs. RHE with a CHI 760E potentiostat. The produced gases were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC), where an Ar carrier gas was flowed over the cell at a constant flow rate. The fabricated photoanode, a platinum electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. A 300 W Xe lamp (light intensity adjusted to ca. 100 mW cm−2) was used as the light source and the light shines into the front side of the photoanodes during measurements.
2.5. Transient absorption (TA) spectra measurement
The TA spectra were recorded using the third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (EKSPLA, NT 342B, 355 nm, 5 ns pulse width, 0.9 Hz, ∼200 μJ per pulse) as the pump light, and a 100 W tungsten lamp (Bentham, IL 1) coupled to a monochromator (Zolix, Omni-λ 300) as the probe light. The variation in the optical density (ΔOD) of the photoanode was calculated by measuring the transmitted probe light using an Si photodiode (Hamamatsu) and an amplification system coupled to both an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS 2012C) and a data acquisition card (National Instruments NI-6221). The data were averaged over 300 laser shots. The experiments were carried out using a three-electrode setup controlled by a CHI 760 C electrochemical workstation in 1.0 M NaOH solution (pH ∼ 13.6) with the photoanode, Pt, and Ag/AgCl as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. During TA spectra measurements, a constant potential was maintained by chronoamperometry.
3. Results and discussion
The Fe2O3 electrode was prepared as previously reported,29 which shows a nanorod-like morphology, as displayed in Fig. S1a.† After being decorated with an ultrathin layer of Fh and CoPi, there are so minor morphology changes and the XRD patterns only display the characteristic peaks of raw Fe2O3 and FTO substrate (Fig. S1 and 2†). Furthermore, there are also little changes in Fh or CoPi-modified Fe2O3 photoanode in the XPS Fe 2p spectra (seen in Fig. S3†), as compared with pristine Fe2O3, and the presence of Co(II) species is also confirmed for the CoPi-modified Fe2O3 photoanode.32,33

Fig. 1a shows the current–potential curves for the Fe2O3 photoanodes with different modified layers. To avoid the negative effect of the surface overlayers due to their high electric resistance, the loading amount of the Fh and CoPi films were optimized for better comparison (Fig. S4†), which were used throughout this study. The pristine Fe2O3 exhibits a relatively low photocurrent density of 0.704 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, while the modification of both the Fh-2 min and CoPi layers lead to PEC performance enhancement, reaching 0.841 mA cm−2 and 1.10 mA cm−2, respectively. The current–potential curve of Fh-12 min-modified Fe2O3 is also given for comparison, and a suppressed photocurrent was observed. Furthermore, the increase of fill factor in the current–potential curve and the negative shift for the photocurrent onset (Fig. S5†) are more obvious after the addition of CoPi in comparison with that of Fh. In addition, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values of both the Fh/Fe2O3 and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanodes also exhibit conspicuous increase in the wavelength region from 350 to 550 nm (Fig. S6†), which is consistent with the performance enhancement presented in Fig. 1a.

(d) Stored hole quantity versus potential curves of the Fe2O3, Fh/Fe2O3 and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanodes. 
In order to evaluate the hole storage capability of the Fh and CoPi layers intuitively, the steady state chopped photocurrent–time curves under stepped bias were measured (Fig. S7†). Steady state photocurrent curves of Fe2O3, Fh/Fe2O3, and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode tests at 0.8 and 1.2 V were carried out for understanding the charge transfer evolution process with increasing potential. As displayed in Fig. 1b, the photocurrent rapidly decreases to a negligible value within less than 2 s for all the Fe2O3-based photoanodes at 0.8 V under irradiation, reflecting the serious charge recombination process in the low-potential region. Meanwhile, upon turning off the irradiation at 60 s, there are characteristic cathodic current peaks. This phenomenon suggests that the stored holes would in turn recombine with the photogenerated electrons in the absence of a driving force.37 Therefore, the CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode displays a more obvious cathodic current than that of the pristine or Fh-decorated Fe2O3 photoanode, demonstrating that the deposited CoPi layer can largely promote the hole extraction and storage capacity of Fe2O3 in the low potential region. This is also consistent with the negative shift of the photocurrent onset displayed in Fig. S5.† However, as shown in Fig. 1c, when the applied potential is increased to 1.2 V, there is only a feeble photocurrent decay (0–60 s); the photocurrent indicates the order CoPi/Fe2O3 > Fh/Fe2O3 > Fe2O3. Upon turning off the irradiation, weaker cathodic current peaks can be observed for Fh/Fe2O3 and CoPi/Fe2O3 compared with that of pristine Fe2O3. Therefore, we deduce that the high applied bias can largely suppress charge recombination and thus facilitate water oxidation.
By integrating the cathodic photocurrent peak, we plotted the quantity of the stored holes (ΔQ) against the applied potential, as displayed in Fig. 1d. It can be clearly seen that all the curves demonstrate a “volcano-shaped” tendency within the applied potential window, while there are different behaviors for Fh and CoPi-modified Fe2O3 photoanodes. For pristine Fe2O3, the ΔQ gradually increases from 0.7 V and reaches a maximum of 0.04 mC cm−2 at 1.1 V, indicating that there is gradual increase in the photogenerated holes being accumulated at the interface of the semiconductor and electrolyte with the increasing bias. Afterward, the stored holes will participate in the water oxidation reaction under a strong driving force within the potential window of 1.1–1.4 V, thus presenting a gradual decrease in ΔQ. Upon being modified with Fh-2 min, the ΔQ of Fe2O3 increases slightly only in the potential region of 0.8–1.0 V, implying a hole transfer process from Fe2O3 to Fh. However, the ΔQ of Fh-2 min/ Fe2O3 photoanode shows an obvious decay compared with that of pristine Fe2O3 at potentials above 1.0 V, uncovering that the addition of Fh-2 min can promote the release of holes accumulated on the Fe2O3/electrolyte interface rather than storing holes temporarily in the high-potential region. In contrast, the modification of CoPi on Fe2O3 demonstrates a predominant improvement of ΔQ in the potential region of 0.7–1.0 V. Typically, the ΔQ increases from 0.0085 mC cm−2 for pristine Fe2O3 to 0.057 mC cm−2 for CoPi/Fe2O3 at 0.8 V, by a factor of 6.7. Meanwhile, the potential of the ΔQ peak is shifted negatively from 1.1 V (for Fe2O3 and Fh/Fe2O3) to 0.8 V for CoPi/Fe2O3. Afterward, the ΔQ of CoPi/Fe2O3 decreases rapidly. This may indicate that the holes stored in CoPi/Fe2O3 would be more quickly injected into the electrolyte for the water oxidation reaction than those of Fe2O3 and Fh/Fe2O3 in the high potential region. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the decoration of the thick Fh film (Fh-12 min) on Fe2O3 results in a conspicuous enhancement of ΔQ compared with the rest of the Fe2O3-based samples, in accordance with the cognition of the “hole-storage-layer” for effectively storing photogenerated holes.21,22 However, a suppressed performance is observed for Fh-12 min/Fe2O3, possibly due to the high charge transfer resistance within the thick layer of Fh-12 min. On the other hand, we also found that the PEC performance of Fe2O3-based photoanodes is no longer directly related to the stored hole quantity. Despite the fact that CoPi has been commonly recognized as an active cocatalyst,34–36 it is essential to further study the functions of CoPi from the aspect of hole-storage and charge transfer kinetics with ultrathin Fh layer as a comparison.
After excluding the effects of morphology, light absorption, and work function changes in photocurrent improvement upon loading Fh and CoPi (Fig. S2, S8 and 9†), we propose that the different hole-storage behaviors between Fh- and CoPi-decorated Fe2O3 photoanodes may be responsible for PEC performance enhancement.
Furthermore, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was conducted to get an insight into the charge extraction and transfer kinetics of the studied Fe2O3 photoanodes. In principle, the IMPS response in the first quadrant reflects the competition issues between charge transfer and charge recombination, while the value of the high-frequency photocurrent intercept with the real axis corresponds to the flux of holes arriving at the surface before they have a chance to recombine.12,25 By fitting a series of Nyquist plots at potentials ranging from 0.7 to 1.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. S10†), we obtained the rate constants of charge transfer (Kt) and charge recombination (Kr) versus applied bias. Fig. 2a represents the typical Nyquist curves of the Fe2O3-based photoanodes at 1.0 V, where the higher intercept of the CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode at horizontal axis suggests that there is a higher concentration of photogenerated holes arriving at the electrode/electrolyte interface than that of the Fh-modified and pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes. From Fig. 2b, one can observe that Kt is similarly increased for ultrathin Fh and CoPi-modified Fe2O3 photoanodes, indicating that charge transfer enhancement for Fe2O3 upon the decoration of Fh and CoPi layer is indistinguishable. As presented in Fig. 2c, it is worth noting that the Kr of Fe2O3 is almost unchanged upon loading ultrathin Fh at potentials below 1.0 V, while it slightly decreases in the high potential region of 1.0–1.3 V, where more remarkable water oxidation occurs. Most notably, upon the decoration of CoPi on the Fe2O3 photoanode, the Kr is suppressed overall the entire potential range by a factor of 4–20, which is especially obvious in the potential region below 1.0 V. In general, the phenomenon that Kt increases continuously but Kr remains constant with applied bias can be ascribed to the Fermi level pinning of the semiconductor.12 Therefore, the distinct photocurrent enhancement of CoPi/Fe2O3 may be ascribed to the prominent role of CoPi in effectively suppressing charge recombination. As a result, CoPi/Fe2O3 demonstrates a higher charge transfer ratio than that of Fh/Fe2O3 or pristine Fe2O3, as presented in Fig. 2d, which is consistent with Fig. 1a.

(c) Charge-recombination kinetics rate constants (Kr) of the above studied photoanodes versus applied potential. (d) The percentage of charge-transfer kinetics rate constants (Kt) versus (Kt + Kr). 
In addition, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was used to further investigate the roles of Fh and CoPi layers in regulating the kinetics of photogenerated carriers. Typically, the TA signal of Fe2O3 consists of a bleach band and an absorption band at the wavelength of ∼580 nm and >650 nm, respectively (Fig. S11†). The bleach band is assigned to trapped electrons, while the absorption signal is ascribed to the photogenerated holes.38–40 It is apparent that as the potential increases, the absorption band curves indicate a remarkable retardation of fast decay, indicating that the applied potentials can suppress charge recombination and thus prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated holes. As shown in Fig. 3a, CoPi/Fe2O3 displays the most long-living hole signal under 0.9 V vs. RHE, suggesting that the decoration of CoPi induces the most effective charge separation compared to Fe2O3 and Fh/Fe2O3, especially at a low potential.41 On the other hand, the bleach signal measured at 580 nm shows a distinct difference for the Fe2O3, Fh/Fe2O3, and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanodes (Fig. 3b). Thus, pristine Fe2O3 displays a positive absorption signal at a low potential of 0.7 V, which will transform to the bleach signal at a potential above 0.8 V (Fig. S11†). The increased absorption amplitude of Fh/Fe2O3 demonstrates that the introduction of Fh may reduce partial trap states, in line with the previous report of Fh/BiVO4.42 Interestingly, the CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a bleach signal at 580 nm emerging at 0.7 V, further confirming that CoPi can facilitate the extraction of photogenerated electrons in the low-potential region,19 which may be primarily ascribed to the broadening of the depletion region. Consequently, we conclude that the decoration of CoPi can efficiently promote the charge separation efficiency and the lifetime of photogenerated holes is thus largely prolonged, while the function of Fh in enhancing charge separation is limited.

Furthermore, the interfacial charge transfer resistance and the capacitance of the photogenerated holes were measured by EIS at a series of applied potentials under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight. As is clearly seen in Fig. 3c, all the Nyquist curves of the studied Fe2O3-based photoanodes at 0.8 V display two semicircles, suggesting that the charge transfer process can be modeled by a typical two-units equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 3c, which has been widely used for the Fe2O3 photoanodes.18,43 It is found that the interfacial charge transfer resistance (R2) related to the surface states dramatically decreases from 12848 Ohm cm2 for pristine Fe2O3 to 3112 Ohm cm2 and 479 Ohm cm2 for ultrathin Fh- and CoPi-decorated Fe2O3 photoanode, respectively (Table S1†). Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 3d, there are two phase peaks for all the Fe2O3, Fh/Fe2O3, and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanodes, representing both the bulk charge-transfer (high frequency) and electrode/electrolyte interface charge-transfer (low frequency). Compared with pristine Fe2O3, the decoration of the Fh layer can only make the low-frequency phase peak shift toward the high frequency direction, while the modification of CoPi can shift both these two peaks toward the high frequency direction. This further reveals that compared with the role of the Fh layer in promoting interfacial charge injection, the CoPi layer can further accelerate the bulk charge separation process at 0.8 V. Fig. 3e demonstrates that the decoration of CoPi on Fe2O3 can decrease interfacial charge-transfer resistance (R2) significantly only in the low-potential region. As the applied potential increases, the effects of the Fh and CoPi layers in promoting charge-transfer process are no longer obvious (Fig. S12, Tables S2 and 3†). An alternative explanation is that water oxidation takes place predominantly from the holes trapped in intermediate-surface states (i-SS) but not directly from the valence band holes at low potential;43 consequently, the surface states’ charging process will be enhanced after the decoration of the Fh and CoPi layer, resulting in effective hole-storage and charge separation promotion. With the increase of the potential, however, surface states’ charging becomes saturated and the concentration of interfacial holes is largely increased; thus, the prominent holes for water oxidation will directly come from the valence band of Fe2O3 rather than the surface state charging, similar to the previous report.44 Interestingly, these proposes can be further proved by the energetic distribution of the density of surface states (DOS, denoted as g(EFn)), which can be calculated using the following eqn (3).43,45,46 CPE2(E) = q × g(EFn)(3)
Here, CPE2 represents the surface states’ capacitance at the electrode/electrolyte interface during PEIS measurement.43 By eqn (3), we can obtain the DOS curves, as indicated in Fig. 3f. Both Fh and pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibit similar DOS with the peak located at about 1.1 V, except that the DOS is increased for the Fh/Fe2O3 photoanode in the low potential region. This may be attributed to partial surface states’ charging, as shown in the TA results (Fig. 3b). Afterward, Fh/Fe2O3 has comparable DOS with that of pristine Fe2O3 in the high potential region. As for CoPi/Fe2O3, the DOS shows an increase in the potential region of 0.8–0.9 V. This result reveals an evident charging process due to the loading of CoPi, which should be responsible for the facilitated charge transfer process. At potentials above 1.0 V, CoPi/Fe2O3 possesses very limited DOS values, in comparison with Fh-modified and pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes. Correlating the distinct reduction of DOS at the high potential region with the decreased ΔQ (Fig. 1d) and enhanced photocurrent, an alternative explanation is given out. As CPE2 is related to the intermediate-surface states (i-SS) and is included in the Helmholtz capacitance, the potential applied on the space charge region and Helmholtz layer will be regulated with the DOS turning. Accordingly, the decrease of CPE2 in the high-potential region may decrease the applied potential drop in the Helmholtz layer, and the applied potential on the space charge layer will be increased in turn, thus resulting in enhanced charge separation. Therefore, i-SS charging is deduced to be responsible for efficient charge separation and transfer process at a low bias, while at a high potential, an alternative charge transfer pathway may dominate—the valence band holes directly participate in water oxidation without transferring to CoPi.
Open circuit potentials under dark (OCP-dark) and irradiation conditions (OCP-light) were also conducted for investigating the possible band bending changes upon the decoration of Fh and CoPi (Fig. S13†). In principle, the OCP-dark reflects the water oxidation potential under ideal conditions, whereas the OCP-light is close to the flat-band potential (Vfb) of the studied photoanode, which is consistent with a previous report.47 The difference between them is determined as the photovoltage (Vph).
As shown in Fig. 4a, the OCP-light of Fe2O3 increases by 40 mV upon the decoration of Fh or CoPi, which may be ascribed to the surface potential changes of these two outermost layers (Fig. S9†). Anyway, there are negligible differences between the Fh and CoPi layers. On the contrary, the OCP-dark values of the Fh/Fe2O3 and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanodes demonstrate a difference of 60 mV, reaching 0.781 V and 0.841 V, respectively. Consequently, CoPi/Fe2O3 exhibits larger Vph than those of both the Fh/Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 photoanodes, which is consistent with the negative shift of photocurrent onset presented in Fig. S5.† Therefore, we conclude that band bending may turn out to be more aggravated in the case of CoPi modification than Fh, which is consequently more beneficial for the charge separation and hole-storage processes.

(b) CV curves of the Fe2O3, Fh/Fe2O3 and CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanodes under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. The inset shows the CV curves of the FTO, Fh/FTO and CoPi/FTO electrodes under dark condition. (c) In situ UV-visible absorbance changes of the CoPi/FTO electrode with increasing potential at 500 nm, using the spectrum measured at 0.9 V as a reference. The CV curve of CoPi/FTO is also given for comparison. (d) The relationship between the stored hole quantity and photocurrent versus the applied potential for PEC water oxidation reaction based on the CoPi-modified Fe2O3 photoanode system. 
CV tests were also conducted to investigate the reaction intermediate species of Fh and CoPi layers, as shown in Fig. 4b. Unlike the unremarkable CV curves for Fe2O3 and Fh/Fe2O3, there is a distinct redox peak located at 0.72 V for the CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode. Two pairs of redox peaks located at 1.05 V and 1.45 V for the CoPi film on the FTO substrate were also observed (the inset of Fig. 4b and Fig. S14†), which may be ascribed to the high valence Co species. Furthermore, there is an initial photocurrent enhancement for Fh and CoPi film-modified Fe2O3 photoanodes during oxygen production; the relevant Faraday efficiencies are slightly lower than 100%. These demonstrate that high-valence species might be formed, although the vast majority of photogenerated holes are used for the water oxidation reaction (Fig. S15 and 16†). In situ electrochemical UV-visible experiments were also conducted to reveal the possible intermediate species of Fh and CoPi films during the PEC water oxidation reaction (details in Fig. S17–19†). The reversible light absorption curves of CoPi/FTO versus applied potential indicates the reversible changes of the Co species formed during the PEC water oxidation reaction, while there is negligible absorption change for the Fh layer. The representative plots of the ΔAbs500 and CV polarization curves for CoPi/FTO are shown in Fig. 4c. The redox peaks located at 1.05 V and 1.45 V represent Co(II)–Co(III) and Co(III)–Co(IV) processes, respectively, similar to a previous report.24 During the formation of high-valence Co species, the ΔAbs500 curve indicates a successive and reversible increase, implying that photogenerated holes are stored in the form of high-valence Co species for CoPi-modified Fe2O3 photoanode in PEC water oxidation.
Therefore, the accumulation of surface-trapped species or surface-charging process at the electrode/electrolyte interface may be responsible for the photocurrent enhancement. The ultrathin Fh film deposited on Fe2O3 can hardly enhance ΔQ in the low-potential region, while ΔQ indicates a slight decrease compared with pristine Fe2O3 after 1.0 V. As for the CoPi-decorated Fe2O3 photoanode, there is a superior enhancement of ΔQ in the low potential region (<1.0 V); afterward, ΔQ largely decreases in the high-potential region, where a more remarkable water oxidation reaction occurs (Fig. 1d). Anyway, the decoration of both ultrathin Fh and CoPi can result in distinct photocurrent improvement of the Fe2O3 photoanode but CoPi performs better in promoting efficient water oxidation. Consequently, we established the relationship between ΔQ and photocurrent versus applied potential based on the CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode, as shown in Fig. 4d. The potential region below 1.0 V is recognized as the hole-storage region and that beyond 1.0 V is recognized as the hole-injection region. The CoPi/Fe2O3 photoanode delivers higher photocurrent density than that of Fe2O3 in the whole potential region. However, it possesses more superior stored holes only in the hole-storage region. This highlights the key factor of the hole storage capacity at the early bias stage for achieving favorable photocurrent enhancement.
Finally, the different mechanisms of the Fh and CoPi layers in enhancing the photocurrent of Fe2O3 is proposed and shown in Scheme 1. As for the ultrathin Fh layer, its role in promoting bulk charge separation is suppressed due to its limited effect in the band bending of Fe2O3 and subsequent weak hole storage capacity. In the low potential region where the quasi Fermi level of the holes may be pinned by recombination surface states (r-SS), the charge recombination is comparable with that of pristine Fe2O3. As the potential increases, Fermi level pinning would be partly released and Fh can act as an efficient “hole-injector” for enhancing charge transfer. On the contrary, the existence of the CoPi layer can result in a higher degree of band bending compared with Fh modification, which is due to the effective release of Fermi level pinning (caused by r-SS) and the full activation of i-SS. Subsequently, photogenerated holes will be efficiently extracted and stored in the low potential region, and charge recombination is largely suppressed. Afterward, in the high potential region, the stored holes accumulated in the form of Co(IV) species are then continuously released for water oxidation. As the concentration of interfacial photogenerated holes is high enough and i-SS may become saturated, the prominent holes for water oxidation will directly come from the valence band of Fe2O3. Here, the role of CoPi is primarily reflected in the enhanced charge separation instead of hole injection.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we found that the decoration of both Fh and CoPi films over Fe2O3 can generate photocurrent enhancement for PEC water oxidation. In the present case of a low loading amount (i.e., ultrathin layer), CoPi modification is more beneficial for improving the PEC activity than Fh. Systematic studies show that the role of CoPi is reflected primarily in the superior hole-storage and charge separation ability at an applied potential below 1.0 V, which can be ascribed to the effective release of Fermi level pinning. Afterward, the stored holes will subsequently transfer to the electrode/electrolyte interface for efficient water oxidation; at this point, charge separation rather than charge injection is enhanced in the presence of the CoPi layer. By comparison, Fh possesses very limited hole extraction and storage capacity due to its negligible passivation effect in the surface states and only acts as an efficient “hole-injector” for enhancing charge transfer in the high potential region. Therefore, we conclude that the coupling effect between hole storage and rapid charge transfer should be responsible for photocurrent improvement with the surface modification of traditional cocatalysts. This study broadens the understanding on the roles of ultrathin layers in manipulating the charge transfer process, also highlighting the importance of the semiconductor/modification layer interface in the PEC system.
