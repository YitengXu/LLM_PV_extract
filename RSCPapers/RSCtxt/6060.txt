1. Introduction
Biological imaging and quantitative sensing of biological targets are crucial for gaining in-depth insights into various cellular pathways. Bioimaging is perceived as a versatile tool for an explicit understanding of cellular functions, such as specific localizations, interactions, and sub-cellular events in living systems. In the past decade, many noninvasive imaging techniques, including optical imaging microscopies, positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (USG), have been used for clinical diagnosis. Recently, photoacoustic (PA) imaging is garnering interest as an emerging technique owing to its potential in clinical diagnosis.1 Fluorescence (FL) imaging is widely used in the histologic examination of cells and has gained attention owing to its noninvasiveness, fast response time, and ease of handling.2 Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) emerges as a key technique to monitor the interactions of specific probes in living cells and changes in the surrounding environment.3 Other techniques such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy have also gained prominence recently in cell-based assays owing to the advantages of label-free analysis and the ability to provide first-hand molecular fingerprint information for physiological or pathological discrimination.4 Biosensing as an important research field covers a wide range of sensing capabilities, including pulse, heart rate, blood pressure, antibodies, nucleic acids and other important biomarkers in the human body.5 The development of highly sensitive devices and new approaches which can offer efficient point-of-care testing with high accuracy and low cost is an urgent need in the healthcare industry.6 The numerous reported approaches include potentiometric biosensors, colorimetric biosensors, fluorescent biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, electrogenerated chemiluminescence biosensors and Raman spectroscopy biosensors. Among them, electrochemistry (EC), fluorescence (FL), and chemiluminescence-based (ECL) biosensing nanoplatforms attract more attention because of the relatively high sensitivity and detection of a wide range of substances, fast response–recovery time and low detection limits. Moreover, other advanced biosensing approaches such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), SERS and wearable sensing as well as colorimetric sensing have drawn increasing attention in recent years.
With the increasing demands of bioimaging and bioassay, it becomes significant to stimulate the rational design and construction of a wide range of functional nano-platforms. 2D layered nanosheets have drawn huge attention in past decades owing to their superlative physical features including large surface area and minimal thickness as well as easy surface modification, which endow them with a plethora of potential applications in the field of biomedicine. Among them, graphene and dichalcogenides (TMDs) drew much more attention in the early age of 2D nanoplatforms due to their more readily tunable properties, better biocompatibility and higher photothermal conversion efficient (PCE).7,8 However, graphene features excellent carrier mobility (2 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) but zero bandgap and a low on–off current ratio, while TMDs possess a high on–off current ratio but a narrow and finite bandgap as well as low carrier mobility, hindering their applications in bioimaging and biosensing.9,10 As new layer-structured two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, MXenes and black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) developed following the discovery of graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hBN, etc. have left a remarkable impact on scientific communities with new technological advancements, being commonly applied in biomedical applications in the past few years.11,12
2D layered MXenes are produced by selective etching of A elements from 3D MAX phases, which have a metallic M–A bond and a mixed covalent/metallic/ionic M–X bond. The obtained MXene offers rich surface chemistry, high metallic conductivity, outstanding thermal/mechanical and hydrophilic surface properties, a large specific surface area and high carrier mobility.13–15 BPNSs, in which different layers of BP are connected by van der Waals forces, exhibit a high ON/OFF current ratio, high carrier mobility, and a layer-dependent bandgap that is tunable from ∼0.3 eV in the bulk to 2 eV in the monolayer.16–19 These two emerging semiconductor nanostructures (multielement MXenes and monoelement BPNPs) thus have common features of unique excitation-dependent FL properties, delivery capability, fluorescence quenching capability, carrier mobility and transport anisotropy, light absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency. In addition, combining some common features with different properties which are complementary, MXenes and BP can form useful composites.20 The distinct performances can remedy the deficiency of graphene and TMDs, which renders them capable of initiating the next 2D age and makes them prospective candidates in bioimaging and biosensing. We therefore consider them together in this review. There are some other reviews published on a similar topic.11,12,21–23 However, the previous reviews mainly summarized solo MXenes or BPNSs in the field of various biomedical applications, covering therapeutics, theranostics, antibiosis, drug delivery, 3D printing, etc. Bioimaging and/or biosensing are discussed as a small part in the overall review. In addition, the working principle is usually less mentioned and discussed. Given the paramount importance of MXene and BPNS-based nanomaterials for bioimaging and biosensing, a timely comprehensive summary of emerging 2D MXenes and BPNSs along with their working principles for bioimaging and biosensing applications is urgently required.
In this review, a comprehensive summarization and comparison of both MXenes and BPNSs designed for bioimaging and biosensing is provided. A bridge between multielemental MXenes and monoelemental BPNSs is set up for gaining in-depth insights into the current advances for understanding the fundamental physics and stimulating the design of new nanoplatforms for further development. We mainly focus on the important results of 2D MXenes and BPNSs designed for bioimaging and biosensing applications during the past three years. A summary of 2D MXenes and BPNSs along with their working principles for bioimaging and biosensing applications is presented in Fig. 1. After a brief introduction, the bio-applied synthetic methods, surface functionalization and biocompatibility of MXenes and BPNSs are discussed. Furthermore, the significant advancements for bioimaging applications along with their working mechanisms including PA, multicolor fluorescence (FL), MRI, SERS, FLIM and multimode (MR + FL, MR + PA, FL + PA, PA + CT, MR + CT, and MR + PA + CT), and biosensing applications along with their working mechanisms such as EC, FL, ECL, SPR, SERS and strain based wearable as well as colorimetric biosensors are highlighted. Finally, the main challenges that nanoplatforms currently confront for further clinical trials are provided to show hints for future work. Bioimaging and biosensing applications are not only emphasized in our review; their corresponding working mechanisms are also discussed, which have not been presented in the published reviews.

2. Synthetic methods and surface functionalization
The methods used to prepare MXenes and BPNSs have been discussed in earlier reviews, typically categorized into top-down and bottom-up methods. Therefore, we will mainly focus on the preparation methods in the field of bioimaging and biosensing applications. Furthermore, surface functionalization is necessary to enhance their stability and biocompatibility as well as versatility. Accordingly, a summary of the strategies of preparation and surface functionalization of MXenes and BPNSs is given below (Table 1).

2.1 Synthetic methods

Top-down synthesis. 
The Mn+1Xn layers are interleaved with layers of A atoms and the strong M–X bond has a mixed covalent/metallic/ionic character. However, the M–A bond is a metallic bond leading to too strong bonds to be broken by mechanical methods; thus, being different from other 2D materials, top-down preparation of MXenes means liquid exfoliation excluding mechanical exfoliation. Liquid exfoliation for MXenes is carried out by selectively etching A from 3D MAX phases. Typically, two basic steps are required for the transformation from the MAX phase to MXenes, as shown in Fig. 2A. The precursor is firstly handled with etching reagents (HF or acid-fluorides) to produce multilayer MXenes. A single-layer or few-layer MXene is subsequently obtained by intercalants or the disruption of mechanical forces. Most MXenes featuring nanoscale-lateral size and atomic-scale thickness can be generated through this methodology. Additionally, MXenes can also be produced using high-temperature assisted molten fluorides24 and a sonication-assisted F free method in the presence of intercalants.25 From the perspective of bio-applications, the biosafety of the etchants must be considered.23 Consequently, instead of direct employment of HF, in situ generation of HF through the reaction of acids and less harmful fluorides or an F-free etching process is more favorable. Recently, Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets with an average lateral size of 2–3 μm and thickness of 1.6 nm were successfully synthesized by using HCl/LiF as an etchant.26 In addition, MXene quantum dots (QDs) with an average lateral size of 4.9 ± 0.6 nm and thickness of 1.2 ± 0.3 nm were developed via an F-free method with the assistance of powerful probe sonication in the presence of the tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) intercalant.25 F-free construction of mono-layer Ti3C2 sheets by etching Ti3AlC2 with KOH and water was also reported.27 As presented in Tables 2 and 3, it can be found that, for bioimaging and biosensing applications, HF or HCl/LiF etching followed by delamination/intercalation with polar aprotic solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), TMAOH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide), TBAOH (tetrabutylammonium hydroxide) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is a common method to prepare 2D layer MXenes. In addition, the hydrothermal method is generally further utilized to obtain MXene QDs.28

Compared to MXenes, BPNSs are a family of van der Waals materials composed of individual layers, in which the atomic sheets are vertically stacked together by van der Waals forces.29 Hence, top-down preparation of BPNSs involves mechanical cleavage and liquid phase exfoliation (Fig. 2B). Thin layer BP is initially exfoliated via mechanical cleavage. A plasma etching process is sometimes subsequently introduced to adjust the number of layers by reducing structural defects.30 In practice, liquid-phase exfoliation is predominantly utilized due to its advantages of scale-up synthesis and favorable hybrid production for further biomedical applications. Conversely, mechanical exfoliation typically suffers from limited scalability and morphology control. Brent and co-workers exfoliated few-layer BPNSs by liquid exfoliation for the first time.31 This group inspired more researchers to optimize the liquid exfoliation method for high-quality BPNSs.32 To guarantee effective transportation within the blood-circulation, high accumulation/penetration into the lesion location and prompt excretion out of the body, modification turns towards the development of BPQDs (Fig. 2B) with small lateral size and ultrathin thickness.33–37 BPQDs are generally constructed by a second step exfoliation of multilayer BPNSs with additional assistance such as solvothermal or pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in polar aprotic solvents.38,39 However, these organic solvents are generally harmful and biologically incompatible. Attempts have been made to exfoliate BPNSs in water.40 Nevertheless, the BPNSs may experience significant degradation in water due to the low stability in aqueous solution. Therefore, improved strategies including surfactant-assisted exfoliation and post-processing of BPNSs in deoxygenated water or a surface passivation-assisted process and then solvent exchange with deionized water38,41,42 are currently proposed. The preparation methods of BPNS or BPQD based bioimaging and biosensing platforms are shown in Tables 2 and 3.


Bottom-up synthesis. 
Aside from the top-down methods, bottom-up preparation (e.g. chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and wet-chemistry) is also used for synthesizing MXenes and BPNSs. In brief, CVD synthesis generally involves the production of small organic or inorganic molecules/atoms induced by high pressure or temperature, followed by assembling them into 2D ordered structures via crystal growth (Fig. 2C). Wet-chemistry synthesis using liquid-phase precursors involves a chemical reaction of nucleation followed by the formation of nanomaterials. The method is typically performed under ambient conditions and using simple equipment (Fig. 2D). Compared to the top-down method, the bottom-up technique can provide distinct advantages of manipulation of the thickness, morphology, doping level and surface chemistry, which is beneficial to the generation of ultrafine nanosheets with good crystallization. Unfortunately, the method is not very successful for the construction of these two emerging 2D materials in the field of bioimaging and biosensing (Tables 2 and 3).
Hitherto, only a few studies about the synthesis of MXenes and BPNSs using bottom-up methods were reported. As a paradigm, ultrathin 2D α-Mo2C sheets were prepared via CVD at 1085 °C. Specifically, 2D ultrathin α-Mo2C crystals grew on Cu/Mo foil under a methane atmosphere (C source), in which Mo atoms reacted with decomposed methane by diffusing onto the surface of the liquid Mo–Cu alloy. The successful preparation of the 2D α-Mo2C MXene offered great potential for developing other high-quality 2D ultrathin MXene crystals such as WC and TaC crystals.43 However, the CVD method has yet to be successfully applied for synthesizing Ti3C2. Moreover, the preparation of MXenes through the wet-chemical method has not been reported up till now. With regards to BPNSs, more paradigms using the bottom-up method are reported.44–47 Se-doped BP crystals with controllable doping contents and high crystallinity were prepared by a mineralizer-assisted gas-phase transformation method.45 Moreover, Zhang et al. developed a BP-based nanosheet by wet-chemical solvothermal processing.44
It can be concluded that most MXene- and BPNS-based nanomedical systems are synthesized by the top-down methodology. It is expected that appropriate bottom-up approaches will be developed as the strategies can provide well-controlled morphology and crucial parameters for 2D nano-platforms, which demonstrate great potential in future biomedical applications.

2.2 Surface functionalization

Surface functionalization of MXenes. 
It is reported that MXenes are highly stable in water-based colloidal solutions even without surfactant protection due to the highly hydrophilic and charged surface (–OH, –O and/or –F).48,49 Nevertheless, like most nanoplatforms in biological applications, ultrathin MXenes readily aggregate and precipitate in complex physiological environments, limiting further application. In addition, it is important to construct a multipurpose surface for targeted molecule decoration. Therefore, surface functionalization is essential to improve the stability under physiological conditions and endow them with a multipurpose surface to ensure their efficacy as bioimaging and biosensing nanoplatforms. Two main modification approaches including biocompatible polymer-based (Fig. 3A) coordination or noncovalent interactions (physical absorption and electrostatic attraction), and inorganic nanoparticle-based (Fig. 3B) surface chemistry are usually applied.
 Fig. 3  Surface functionalization strategies for MXenes including polymer-based modification (A) and inorganic nanoparticle (NP)-based modification (B), taking SP + Fe3O4 (C) and SP + MnOx (D) as a representative paradigm.

Polymer-based modification. 
Thereinto, the modification by introducing polymer-based coordination or noncovalent interactions mainly aims at improving the stability and biocompatibility. Meanwhile, the utilization of inorganic nanoparticle-based surface chemistry is to attach functional molecules for achieving bioimaging or biosensing. For instance, Dai constructed a MnOx/Ti3C2–SP composite by anchoring paramagnetic MnOx and subsequently grafting soybean phospholipid (SP) to further improve the stability and biocompatibility for efficient pH-responsive MRI-guided tumor hyperthermia.50 Inspired by this strategy, a series of MXene bio-nanoplatforms were functionalized with SP by physical absorption to guarantee highly efficient theranostic and therapy applications against cancer.50–56 In addition to SP, other biocompatible polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by physical absorption,57 polyethylene glycol (PEG) via electrostatic attraction,58 polyethylenimine (PEI),59 and poly(dopamine) (PDA)26 have also demonstrated outstanding ability for inhibiting the aggregation and sedimentation of MXene nanosheets. Among them, SP extracted from natural soybean was demonstrated to be favorable owing to its excellent biocompatibility and inexpensive and scalable preparation. It was reported that grafting poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) by strong coordination between the carboxyl group in PAA and titanium of the Ti3C2-MXene can not only enhance the stability, dispersity, and interface performance of Ti3C2, but also endow Ti3C2 with covalent linkage sites for subsequent dual signal tagged chimeric DNA functionalization to simultaneously map dual cancer biomarkers in living cells.60 Moreover, PAA was utilized to highly stabilize the Ti3C2 MXene surface and provide linkage sites for cystamine by an amidation reaction.61


Inorganic nanoparticle-based modification. 
In addition to polymer-based modification for improving the biocompatibility and stability, inorganic nanoparticle-based surface functionalization aiming at augmenting the multifunctional properties of MXenes is prevalent for constructing a bioimaging model or biosensing system. For example, Fe3O4 and MnOx with paramagnetic properties are typically applied to anchor on the surface of Ti3C2 nanosheets, which imparts them with the ability of magnetic resonance imaging for concurrent diagnostic imaging and therapeutics. The integration of the paramagnetic Fe3O4 (Fig. 3C) or MnOx (Fig. 3D) species on the MXene surface was achieved by an in situ redox reaction between FeSO4·7H2O or KMnO4 precursors and surface termination groups.50,51,55 Noble metal Au is currently employed in the construction of a multifunctional 2D core–shell MXene@Au nanoplatform with dual-modal imaging performance (PA/CT) for enhanced photo-radio combined therapy in the second biological window.62 Other studies investigating the integration of GdW10-based polyoxometalates (POMs) for CT and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for drug delivery have also been conducted.63 Additionally, modification with C nanotubes,64 TiO2,65 Pt,66 Ag,34 Au,67–69 Pd,26 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),34 Si,70,71 and N and P doping28 for biosensing has also been examined. Tables 2 and 3 present the surface modification methods of MXenes in bioimaging and biosensing applications in the past three years.


Surface functionalization of BPNSs. 
Compared to MXenes, BPNSs are more unstable and readily degrade when exposed to air because of the chemical reaction between the lone-pair electrons in BPNSs and oxygen, leading to the formation of oxidized BPNSs, followed by conversion to phosphoric acid in the presence of water, which leads to difficulties in potential applications. Therefore, surface engineering is essential to prevent degradation and aggregation. Primarily three protection strategies are used, namely, surface encapsulation such as with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polydopamine (PDA), styrene–acrylamide (St–AAm), lipid–PEG, etc. (Fig. 4A), chemical modification (noncovalent and covalent bonding, and coordination) (Fig. 4B) and doping (Fig. 4C). Owing to the ability of covalent/noncovalent linkage formation by additional organic/nonimmunogenic/cellular targeting molecules onto the surface of BPNSs, chemical modification is widely used in the field of bioimaging and biosensing, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. Consequently, chemical modification will be mainly discussed in this part.

Polymer-based noncovalent modification. 
Surface functionalization of BPNSs by conjugating with polymer PEG paves the way for chemical modification, i.e. PEGylation (polyethylene glycol treated BP).72 This modification method is still prevalent nowadays.73–76 Cationic polymer poly-L-lysine (pLL) was also used to modify the BPNS surface via hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions; the obtained pLL–BP hybrid can play a role of a biocompatible building block for the construction of novel bioelectronics, biofuel cells and biosensors.41 Zhao et al. presented a functionalized BP nanocomposite synthesized by non-covalently combining an ionic liquid (IL) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) with BP, which exhibited electrochemical biosensing activity.42 However, these modification strategies with electrostatic interactions are susceptible to disturbance in the in vivo complex microenvironment including biomolecule adsorption and high ionic strength, leading to self-aggregation and degradation.


Covalent bonding modification. 
To address the problem, surface engineering approaches were established further, in which organic groups were introduced by coordination or covalent bonding rather than electrostatic interactions. For example, the titanium sulfonate ligand (TiL4) was introduced to coordinate with BPNSs to form P–Ti coordination bond, of which the lone pair electrons of phosphorus are occupied by the ligand, therefore the BPNSs are prevented from oxidizing in the presence of moisture.77,78 Through covalent functionalization and passivation of BPNSs via aryl diazonium chemistry such as 4-nitrobenzene-diazonium (4-NBD), and 4-nitrophenyl diazonium tetrafluoroborate (4-NPD), chemical degradation of BPNSs was significantly hindered even after three weeks of ambient exposure.37,79 Controllable modification of the BPNS properties was also achieved via tunable p-type doping to form covalent bonds using aryl diazonium.80 Long et al. utilized EtOH to passivate BPQDs. It showed prominently high fluorescence and stability (70% fluorescence quantum yield in water and 150 d stable FL under ambient conditions), which originated from the intrinsic band-to-band excitation states and the P–OH and P–O–CH2CH3 covalent bonding on the surface.38


Coordination modification. 
Recently, a novel modification strategy was developed utilizing aromatic 1-pyrenylbutyric acid by a π–π stacking interaction (Fig. 4B), which not only enhanced the stability of BPNSs but also achieved concurrent anchoring of the carboxyl rich groups. The method eliminated the problem of the lack of functional groups on the surface of BPNSs, and initiated the trend of introducing other active biomolecules in a convenient way to extend the applications in bioimaging and biosensing.73 By taking advantage of the excellent chelation of natural polyphenol tannic acid (TA), Guo et al. constructed a nanoplatform with highly efficient MR + PA dual-modal imaging-guided photothermal therapy via simultaneous chelation of TA with BPNSs and paramagnetic Mn2+ to form TA–Mn2+ chelate-coated BPNSs.81 Moreover, methods such as amino modification,82 PDA coating,83 and small organic molecular dye chemical modification were also employed to surmount the disadvantages of BPNSs for the development of potential in bioimaging and biosensing. Similar to MXenes, inorganic nanoparticle-based surface functionalization such as with Au,82,84 Ag,34,76 MnO2,74,81 and mSiO240 is also important to construct a multifunctional BPNS based bioimaging model or biosensing system.

3. Biosafety
Preliminary studies demonstrate that rising star 2D nanoplatforms MXenes and BPNSs have great potential as nanoplatforms for drug delivery, photothermal therapy, bioimaging, and biosensing. Substantial efforts have been devoted to investigating their efficiency. However, scientific research is still in its infancy and certain concerns such as biocompatibility persist. Consequently, it is important to gain insights into the biological effects of these nanoplatforms for further clinical translation. In this part, the biocompatibility of multielement MXene and monoelement BPNSs was discussed.
Recently, Nasrallah et al. proposed a protocol to evaluate the toxicological effect of Ti3C2Tx using a widely accepted zebrafish model. Based on the results, the Ti3C2 MXene was classified in the “practically nontoxic” group according to the Acute Toxicity Rating Scale by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).85 In practical bio-applications, MXenes are utilized in the functionalized form, such as PEGylated MXenes, PVP@MXene, and SP@MXene. Therefore, the validation of the biocompatibility of the original MXenes does not guarantee the biosafety of MXene based composites. Accordingly, the in vitro cytotoxicity of Ti3C2–SP composites on breast 4T1 cancer cells was evaluated using a standard Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the in vivo biocompatibility on healthy Kunming mice was evaluated with the intravenous injection of Ti3C2–SP (Fig. 5). Negligible effects were observed on the survival of 4T1 cells even at a concentration of 400 μg mL−1 (Fig. 5A); the confocal image can also support it (Fig. 5B). Based on the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining results after one month of treatment administration, no acute or chronic pathological toxicity or adverse effects were observed in the major organs (Fig. 5C). More importantly, no abnormal blood indices (including key biochemistry parameters) were observed while comparing the control and the treatment group.86 These results demonstrated that Ti3C2–SP was biocompatible. The evaluation of the in vitro/vivo biocompatibility of Ta4C3–SP also demonstrated negligible toxicity, which was desirable for dual-mode PA/CT imaging diagnosis and photothermal therapy (PTT) application.54 With a similar evaluation protocol, the biocompatibility of MnOx/Ti3C2–SP nanosheets was also validated.50 Recently, in vitro/vivo biocompatibility assessment of modified MXene composites such as MnOx/Ta4C3,53 Ti3C2–IONP–SP,51 Ti3C2@Au–PEG,62 Ti3C2–PVP,57 Ta4C3–IONP–SP,55 and Ta4C3–SP54 showed no evident hepatic and kidney toxicity, or damage or inflammation in the primary organs of the experimental mice. Preliminary cytotoxicity and tissue toxicity studies demonstrated promising potential of both MXenes and MXene-based composites for biomedical application and further clinical translation.

With respect to the biocompatibility of BPNSs, systematical evaluation of the toxicities of BPQDs at the cellular, tissue, and whole-body levels was carried out by the Mu group in 201788 for the first time through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results demonstrated that BPQDs did not induce any significant long-term toxicological responses. The dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity of BPNSs on both the cell metabolic activity and membrane integrity was assessed against L-929 fibroblasts. The results suggested that the cytotoxicity of BPNSs was proportional to their concentration and exposure time assessed by the oxidative stress-mediated enzyme activity reduction and membrane disruption.89 It was reported that the biocompatibility of functionalized BPNSs was higher than that of raw BPNSs.39,90 TiL4-modified BPNSs demonstrated lower cytotoxicity and proinflammation than unmodified BPNSs, as shown in Fig. 5(D and E). In the detection of the CD68 (a marker for assessment of inflammation in organs) level in organs, negligible accumulation of CD68+ cells in the lungs after 7 days and 28 days treatment was observed; however, bare BP generates an obvious increase in CD68+ (Fig. 5D). In addition, increased collagen in the bronchioles can be observed for the bare BP group compared to the TiL4@BP group (Fig. 5E), confirming that TiL4 modification improved the biocompatibility of BP. These results might be due to the reversed zeta potential and improved stability against oxidation and degradation post-TiL4 modification, resulting in fewer cells being taken up by the macrophages and a lower degree of reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis in cells.87 It was also reported that, compared to the unmodified BPNSs, the cytotoxic effect was significantly reduced when the BPNSs were coated with a protein.91 The in vitro/vivo toxicity evaluation of PEGylated BP–AuNP (BAP) demonstrated no apparent toxic effect on different cell lines.92 Wu et al. constructed BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres by encapsulating with a PEGylated lipid for in vitro and in vivo NIR-II imaging, which presented excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability.75 The biosafety of functionalized BPNSs was further evaluated in recent studies.38,73,83
4. Bioimaging
In this section, the working principles and unique analytical features of 2D MXene and BPNS-based PA, multicolor fluorescence (FL), MRI, SERS, FLIM and multimode (MR + FL, MR + PA, FL + PA, PA + CT, MR + CT, and MR + PA + CT) bioimaging are discussed.
4.1 Photoacoustic imaging
As an emerging imaging modality, photoacoustic (PA) imaging draws attention due to its outstanding spatial and temporal resolution, high sensitivity, and good tissue penetrability; it is an effective tool for real-time noninvasive imaging in biomedical applications. In principle, a broadband ultrasonic (US) wave is first generated by an instant and local thermoelastic expansion when endogenous or exogenous contrast agents within the tissue absorb light energy. The US wave is then detected by a US transducer and converted into electric signals. Finally, a PA image is obtained by processing the electric signals.1 Typically, due to the absence of contrast agents in some tissues and exponential attenuation of the PA contrast ratio with increasing tissue depth, exogenous PA-imaging contrast agents are necessary to improve the signal-to-noise.93 Since the generated PA signal is closely related to the light absorption and thermoelastic properties of the absorbing agent, the injected PA-imaging contrast agents with high PA-imaging performance primarily depend on the molar-extinction coefficient and photothermal conversion efficiency in the biomedical window. Compared to the conventional PA contrast agents (i.e., Au nanocrystals/assemblies, C-based nanoparticles, melanin, and indocyanine green), the rising stars of MXenes and BPNSs are expected to be promising next-generation PA contrast agents in clinical applications owing to their desirable extinction coefficient and photothermal conversion efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) window, as well as good biocompatibility.
Since the 2D Ti3C2 MXene was used as a mediator-free biosensor for H2O2 detection,94 the door was opened for the biomedical application of MXenes. Subsequently, different strategies were developed to design MXene based nanoplatforms for biomedicine applications.23,95 It shows great promise as a PA-imaging contrast agent for tumor diagnosis. 2D Ti3C2-MXene quantum dots (MQDs) prepared by an effective F-free method showed an increase of 0.7-fold in the in vivo PA signal intensity when irradiated by a pulsed laser at 680 nm, compared to that of the pre-injection.25 Ultrathin 2D Ti3C2–SP with distinctive absorption at around 808 nm and high photothermal-conversion performance was prepared by Han and co-workers,52 which indicated that MXenes were desirable candidates for PA imaging contrast agents for diagnostic PA-imaging guidance and monitoring the PTT therapeutic process. Modification with SP results in high dispersity and easy transport of MXenes in blood vessels. The PA signal of Ti3C2–SP nanosheets under excitation with an 808 nm wavelength was observed with increasing Ti3C2–SP concentration (Fig. 6A), which was further confirmed by in vitro PA imaging (the inset image). Additionally, the in vivo PA-imaging of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice via the intravenous injection of Ti3C2–SP nanosheets demonstrated that the PA-imaging contrast was significantly enhanced with gradual accumulation in the tumor within 4 h, followed by decaying of the signal after 24 h, which might result from the gradual excretion of Ti3C2–SP nanosheets (Fig. 6B). The result demonstrated in vivo histocompatibility and easy excretion from the body, thus providing evidence of potential biosafety for further clinical translation. Additionally, the distinct surface chemistry and photothermal-conversion properties endowed the ultrathin Ti3C2–SP platforms with high drug-loading capability (211.8%), furthermore, pH-responsibility and NIR-assisted drug release can synchronously achieve using the platforms.

BPNSs also show great potential in PA imaging due to their distinctive absorption properties in the NIR region and photothermal conversion abilities. Functionalizing BPNSs by noncovalently binding 1-pyrenylbutyric acid and further anchoring arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RP-p-BPNSs) was proposed,73 which exhibited strong in vivo PA-imaging signals in the tumor after 24 h injection of RP-p-BPNSs. On the contrary, a very weak PA signal with the injection of raw BPNSs was detected, demonstrating that the RP-p-BPNSs were an ideal candidate for the development of a nano-platform for PA imaging. Recently, Li et al.76 constructed an Ag+ coupled BP vesicle (BP Ve-Ag+) with NIR-II window PA imaging capability for guiding cancer immune-dynamic therapy and fast wound healing. As presented in Fig. 6C, BPQDs were simultaneously grafted with hydrophilic PEG, PAA featuring an Ag+ ion-trapping function, and ROS-sensitive polypropylene sulfide (PPS) for the first time. The modified BPQDs were then self-assembled into vesicles with BPQDs and Ag+ ions (BP Ve-Ag+), which revealed significantly enhanced light absorption in the NIR-II region. The in vivo NIR-II PA imaging showed improved signals at the tumor site with increasing time, which peaked at 24 h after simultaneous treatment with BP Ve-Ag+. By comparison, no significant NIR-II PA signal was observed at the tumor site of mice treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and BP Ve (Fig. 6D).
4.2 Multicolor fluorescence imaging
Fluorescence microscopy is widely used in the molecular and histological examination of cells to obtain a better understanding of various cellular activities and functions. The interest in the clinical applications of FL imaging has drawn wide attention due to its noninvasiveness and time-resolved sensitive imaging as well as good specificity.96 Fluorescence is an optical phenomenon based on the emission of a photon with a longer wavelength than the absorption wavelength. Typically, when fluorescent molecules absorb photons at an appropriate energy, the molecules will jump from the ground state (S0) to a higher energy state (S1 or S2),97 and then return to the ground state following a process of internal energy relaxation, e.g. internal conversion or vibrational relaxation, fluorescence, intersystem crossing, and phosphorescence. The fluorescence signal can be detected only if the fluorescence efficiency is sufficiently high.
Multicolor fluorescence microscopy is a significant technique in biological imaging due to the ability to monitor complex processes. As rising stars of 2D layered nanoplatforms, MXenes and BPNSs demonstrate huge promise in multicolor fluorescence imaging due to their unique excitation-dependent FL performance. For example, Xue et al.98 prepared monolayer Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots (MQDs) with different sizes (Fig. 7A). For MQD-100, MQD-120, and MQD-150, the average lateral particle sizes were 2.9, 3.7, and 6.2 nm, and the average thicknesses were 0.99, 0.91, and 0.89 nm, respectively, which revealed that most of the MQDs corresponded to monolayer QDs. Due to the strong quantum confinement effect, excitation dependent FL spectra and enhanced quantum yields of around 10% were detected. As shown in Fig. 7B, the in vitro FL bioimaging of RAW264.7 cells incubated with the MQDs displayed bright blue, green, and red color images when irradiated with lasers at 405, 488, and 543 nm, respectively. The result demonstrated the potential of MQDs for multicolor fluorescence cellular imaging.

On account of the excellent fluorescence quenching property and delivery capability of Ti3C2 MXenes, simultaneous mapping of dual cancer biomarkers (MUC1 and miRNA-21) in living cells by dual-color FL imaging was recently achieved by utilizing a dual-signal-tagged chimeric DNA-functionalized titanium carbide MXene probe (dcDNA). This dual-responsive fluorescence nanoplatform was based on a fluorescence “off/on” mechanism.60 To be specific, the dual-color fluorescence produced from Tamra-AP (MUC1 aptamer) and FAM-HP (miRNA-21 aptamer) was quenched when anchored to the PAA–Ti3C2 surface, owing to the superior broad-spectrum and fluorescence quenching capability of the Ti3C2 MXene (Fig. 8A). The membrane MUC1 with red fluorescence and the cytoplasm containing miR-21 with green fluorescence were recovered when Tamra-AP/FAM-HP on the nanoprobe was dissociated from the Ti3C2 MXene and subsequently combined with the MUC1/miRNA-21 aptamer (Fig. 8B). FL imaging of MUC1 and miR-21 in living cells incubated with the dcDNA–Ti3C2 nanoprobe exhibited a bright red membrane and green cytoplasm, which suggested the feasibility of simultaneous detection of plasma membrane glycoprotein MUC1 and cytoplasmic miR-21 via Ti3C2 MXene based in situ multicolor fluorescence imaging (Fig. 8C). In order to visualize the long noncoding RNA of prostate cancer gene 3 (lncRNA PCA3), which is a specific biomarker for androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer, Wang et al. designed TAT peptide-functionalized titanium carbide MXenes loaded with an entropy-driven RNA explorer; this platform can realize long noncoding RNA PCA3 imaging in live cells and simultaneous nucleus-targeted delivery.61

Similarly, multicolor fluorescence imaging was achieved by BPNSs owing to the unique property of layer-dependent fluorescence.99 Substantial efforts have been devoted to BPQDs with intense and stable FL signals as well as excellent biocompatibility in live-cell imaging.38,39,90 Ren's group38 prepared black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) using a pulsed laser ablation method. The obtained BPQDs exhibited stable blue-violet light emission and a high PL quantum yield (20.7%), which is 3 times higher than that of BPQDs prepared by employing ultrasonic probe exfoliation. Furthermore, the potential cell imaging of BP nanodots was also investigated by Shin and co-workers.90 As displayed in Fig. 9A, the BP nanodots exhibited bright green fluorescence and low cytotoxic effects incubated with the cytoplasm of C2C12 myoblasts. These results indicated that the BP nanodots are promising intrinsic fluorescent probes for bioimaging applications.

Noticeably, BPQDs with a significantly improved fluorescence quantum yield and photostability were constructed via ethanol liquid exfoliation (Fig. 9B). A fluorescence quantum yield of 70% was obtained in water, which is comparable to that of the strongest fluorescent carbon dots and fluorescent molecules. In addition, the BPQD solution displayed a highly stable FL signal for 150 days under ambient conditions, which was better than that displayed by many heavy metal semiconducting nanostructures and organic fluorescent dyes with intense FL properties. With experimental and theoretical evaluation, the optical transitions on the stable surface of the P–OH and P–O–CH2CH3 bonding states were considered to be associated with the FL enhancement mechanism. The hydroxyl groups in the ethanol molecule played the role of reducing the number of nonradiative surface defects and promoting the integration of π conjugation. Live cell imaging revealed bright blue fluorescence distinguishing the nucleus from the cytoplasm (Fig. 9C).38 In addition to serving as a fluorescent probe, BPQDs could also serve as the loading platform for fluorescent molecules, which allowed reliable imaging of cancer cells to further expand their biomedical applications.83,100
4.3 Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in the presence of a strong magnetic field and radiofrequency waves. The hydrogen atoms of H2O in the human body are nuclei that act as microscopic compass needles. This is owing to the fact that two-thirds of the human body weight consists of H2O and its ability to stand “at attention” in a strong magnetic field.101 When exposed to specially designed radio frequency pulse sequences, the magnetic alignment of hydrogen atoms is disrupted, and the differences in how they relax to the previous state are used to generate images. MR contrast agents enhance the tissue contrast by catalyzing the process of returning to the relaxed ground state and adding significant morphological and functional information. MRI is currently considered one of the most powerful diagnostic imaging technologies in clinics owing to its noninvasive and nonionizing properties, deep tissue penetration, and the ability to facilitate a detailed examination of the anatomical structure with soft tissue. Therefore, developing novel MR contrast agents with superior NMR characteristics for efficient imaging-guided therapy has drawn growing attention.
To evaluate the readily functionalized MXenes and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, Liu and coworkers51 constructed a 2D magnetic Ti3C2-MXene nanoplatform by in situ growth of Fe3O4 nanocrystals onto the surface of the Ti3C2 MXene and simultaneous modification with SP (Ti3C2–IONP–SP). The obtained Ti3C2–IONP–SP demonstrated excellent T2 relaxivity as high as 394.2 mM−1 s−1, which results in high-quality tumor MRI and high photothermal conversion efficiency (48.6%) for the efficient photothermal killing of cancer cells as well as ablation of tumor tissues. A BPNS based MRI nanoplatform was also developed by assembly of Fe3O4 and Au nanoparticles with a broad light absorption band and a photodegradable character. The nanoplatform was anticipated to suppress tumor growth by visualized synergistic therapy assisted by MRI.102
4.4 Surface-enhanced Raman scattering imaging
The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique can provide first-hand molecular fingerprint information for physiological or pathological examination owing to its highly efficient, non-invasive, and versatile nature. It is a promising label-free analytical approach for determining small quantities of molecules and targeted cancer imaging with cells and tissues.103 The development of SERS originated from the intrinsically low detection sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy in the mid-1970s.104 The enhancement of the local electromagnetic (EM) field and chemical effect (CE) is a commonly accepted SERS mechanism. The enhanced local EM field results from the strong interactions between light (both incident and scattered light) and the nanostructured metallic substrates, which are typically Au, Ag, and Cu, rather than the specific molecules adsorbed on the SERS substrates.105 The CE, i.e. surface chemistry and/or photon-driven electron transfer, may be the result of the adsorption-induced modification of the polarizability of analytes, which depends on the molecular specificity.106 Noble metal modified 2D nanocomposites are promising SERS substrates due to the simultaneous enhancement of the EM field and CE.107 The EM enhancement is attributed to abundant “hot spots” in the fixed metallic nanoparticles, and the additional CE enhancement is attributed to the charge transfer between the 2D nanosheets and the analyte. Moreover, the surface enrichment of molecules on the 2D nanosheets through π–π stacking or electrostatic interactions may also contribute to the intense SERS signals.108 The emerging BPNSs with a large carrier mobility and high signal-to-noise ratio are a promising alternative substrate for bio-SERS sensing and bio-SERS imaging, which are superior to other 2D materials such as TMDs and graphene.109,110
Liu et al. prepared black phosphorus–Au nanoparticle hybrids (BP–AuNP) through a facile one-pot method.92 The in vivo SERS bioimaging of HepG2 cells co-cultured with BP–AuNP showed relatively strong and stable SERS signals acquired in a short time, whereas the SERS signals induced by AuNPs were barely detected, suggesting that BP–AuNP could be a promising label-free SERS probe for both biosensing and bioimaging (Fig. 10A). In addition, the label-free SERS images in three types of tumor cells exhibit unequivocal signals of cellular components in cytoplasmic regions, illuminating the extensive applications of BP–AuNP on multiple types of cancer cells (Fig. 10B). Moreover, the distinct SERS mapping of HepG2 cells performed at different time points after the addition of BP–AuNP demonstrated that the intracellular microenvironment changed during the endocytosis process (Fig. 10C). The outstanding bio-SERS activity of BP–AuNP benefited from the multiple Raman enhancement effects and low inherent background. Furthermore, the nanocomposites also exhibited superior NIR photothermal transduction efficiency and drug delivery performance. These results proved that it is a desirable candidate for multifunctional bio-applications (Fig. 10D). In comparison, the use of MXene-based SERS substrates utilized as label-free live-cell bioimaging probes has rarely been reported.

4.5 Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
The working principle of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is based on measuring the mean fluorescence lifetime of a chromophore at each spatially resolvable element of a microscope image. It is an ideal tool for a quantitative examination of the cellular environment due to the parallel readout, non-invasiveness, and independence of fluorescence lifetimes from the probe concentration. Compared with fluorescence imaging (FL) based on intensity measurements, the intrinsic or exogenous fluorescence lifetime of fluorophores based on the differences in the exponential decay rate of the photoluminescence can provide unique or complementary information.
Meng and coworkers constructed BPNSs and utilized them for FLIM in living cells.40 The BPNSs showed unique photoluminescence emission at ∼690 nm with a 110.5 ps photoluminescence lifetime when irradiating with a 640 nm pulsed laser. In addition, more than two times longer photoluminescence emission was obtained by coating a silica layer (BPNP@mSiO2, 267 ps) which resulted in improved stability and dispersibility (Fig. 11A). The live-cell FLIM incubating HUVECs with BPNPs or BPNP@mSiO2 revealed high contrast images, whereas no signal was observed in the cells without incubation with these probes. Moreover, compared with FL imaging, FLIM could not only offer enhanced contrast and brightness of live cell images but also readily distinguish the BPNP and BPNP@mSiO2 probes via the detection of differences in the fluorescence lifetime (Fig. 11B and C). The results demonstrated the promise of BPNPs and BPNP@mSiO2 in FLIM. The use of MXenes in FLIM has yet to be reported.

4.6 Multi-model imaging
With the increasing demand for imaging techniques in diagnosis, significant improvements in imaging technologies for preclinical or clinical applications have been made in the past decade. Prevalent imaging modalities including MRI, CT, FL imaging, PET, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), US imaging, and PA imaging have been developed. Each imaging modality has its advantages; therefore, in order to enhance the diagnosis accuracy, multimodality imaging microscopies emerge as a powerful tool for comprehensive and synergetic analysis of living subjects. However, the rational integration of three or more different theranostic functional components into one nano platform has limitations such as complicated synthetic procedures, high cost, low production yield, and instability, which significantly hinder their clinic translation. Recently, emerging MXenes and BPNSs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique properties. The construction of multimodal imaging nanoplatforms with simple components, low cost, high sensitivity, and accuracy can be achieved by utilizing MXenes and BPNSs.

Dual-modality MR imaging and FL imaging. 
MR imaging can facilitate the imaging of 3D anatomical structure. While FL imaging does not offer the same advantage, it can lead to highly sensitive and selective detection as well as visualization in vivo, which is not offered by MR imaging. Thus, the MR and FL imaging modalities compensate each other. Low oxygen supply in solid tumors is a limitation to the O2-dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT) technique. Taking advantage of a BPNS-based nanocomposite, Liu and coworkers74 constructed a hybridized nanoplatform by the electrostatic assembly of functionalized BPNSs with Rhodamine B (RhB) and manganese dioxide (R-MnO2-FBP). Hypoxia associated PDT resistance was overcome by in situ generation of O2 resulting from the dissociation of R-MnO2-FBP under the acidic and H2O2-rich environment of cancer cells (Fig. 12A). MR + FL dual-modal imaging of the oxygen supply process and subsequent optimal timing of laser irradiation was achieved by the release of RhB dye and Mn2+ leading to fluorescence recovery and strong T1-weighted MR contrast, respectively. MR + FL dual-modal imaging of the oxygen supply process in HeLa tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice injected with R-MnO2-FBP presented a high contrast in cancer imaging from the RhB fluorescence and Mn2+ MR imaging at 28 h, which demonstrated the ability of R-MnO2-FBP to supply oxygen and optimize the laser irradiation time with dual-mode tracking (Fig. 12B). Imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in hypoxic cells displayed 51.6% cell apoptosis at the optimized time of laser application, which could also be confirmed by the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence recovery induced by the activated caspase-3 in apoptotic cells. The result suggested highly efficient BPNS mediated imaging-guided PDT in vitro. The design of the multifunctional BP nanoplatform provided a promising tracing approach throughout the treatment process.

Dual-modality MR imaging and PA imaging. 
The PA imaging modality can achieve real-time detection of biological structure and provide functional information. While MRI does not offer the same advantages, it can provide higher anatomical structure information on soft tissue. In addition, the emerging PA imaging breaks the penetration limit of optical imaging but with poor spatial resolution. The combination of MRI and PA imaging can compensate the imaging contrast efficiently by synchronously providing high anatomical structure information on soft tissue with MRI and high ultrasonic spatial resolution with in vivo PA imaging.
Based on the superparamagnetic property of Mn, which is an important essential trace element in the human body, and the outstanding photothermal-conversion performance of the 2D Ti3C2-MXene, a novel dual-modality MR + PA imaging nanoplatform was designed50 by triggering a simple redox reaction, in which small MnOx nanosheets were grown in situ on the surface of Ti3C2 to produce a MnOx/Ti3C2-MXene composite. SP was further used to improve the stability of the MnOx/Ti3C2 nanoplatform (MnOx/Ti3C2–SP). Multifunctional diagnosis and therapy in the all-in-one hybridized nanoplatform were achieved by efficient MR + PA dual-modality imaging and subsequent guided PTT against cancer. Importantly, the integrated MnOx components displayed unique pH-responsive T1-weighted MR imaging capability due to the prompt cleavage of Mn–O bonds for releasing the Mn2+ ions, thus further improving the T1-weighted MRI properties by maximizing the interaction chances between paramagnetic Mn centers and water molecules. In addition, the high photothermal-conversion of MnOx/Ti3C2–SP not only endowed it with a desirable contrast-enhanced PA-imaging property but also resulted in highly efficient tumor ablation and tumor-growth suppression. The in vivo T1-weighted MRI of nude mice bearing a 4T1 breast tumor xenograft with intravenous administration of MnOx/Ti3C2–SP composite nanosheets showed gradually enhanced MRI signals in tumors with prolonged imaging duration. It was noteworthy that the remarkable brightening effect of PA was also observed after the injection of MnOx/Ti3C2–SP for 24 h. According to the efficient PA + MR dual-modality imaging-guided therapeutic evaluation of in vitro/vivo PTT tumor ablation and tumor-growth suppression by MnOx/Ti3C2–SP composite nanosheets, it proved that the 2D MXene based multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform had great potential benefits in personalized biomedicine.
As another emerging 2D material, BPNSs play an equally important role in biomedicine applications. However, compared to MXenes with rich surface chemistry, BPNSs with a single element and a lack of abundant functional groups on the surface are still limited in modification for use as MRI contrast agents. In a recent study,81 taking advantage of the excellent chelation ability of the natural polyphenol tannic acid (TA), enhanced MRI contrast performance of a BPNS based nanoplatform was achieved by directly coating TA onto the surface of BPNSs and simultaneously chelating with paramagnetic Mn2+ ions (Fig. 13). The resulting TA–Mn2+ chelate-coated BPNSs (BPNS@TA–Mn) showed an enhanced longitudinal relaxation (r1) value of BPNS@TA–Mn (6.1 ± 0.4 mM−1 s−1) compared with that of Gd–DTPA (4.6 ± 0.3 mM−1 s−1). Moreover, BPNS@TA–Mn also displayed high PA imaging contrast performance owing to its strong absorption and excellent photothermal conversion ability in the NIR region. The in vivo dual-modality MR + PA imaging of HeLa tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice injected with BPNS@TA–Mn exhibited bright MR and PA signals in the tumor region (Fig. 13). It is anticipated that this BPNS@TA–Mn nanoplatform integrating desirable MR + PA dual-modal imaging capability and high photothermal conversion efficiency has great potential in imaging-guided interventional PTT.

Dual-modality FL and PA imaging. 
The advantages of FL and PA are also integrated by constructing BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres;75 as shown in Fig. 13, the resultant BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres (Fig. 14A) exhibited broad emission from 900 to 1650 nm under excitation by an 808 nm laser (Fig. 14B), and the quantum yield of the BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres is 8% of the quantum yield of the standard dye (IR-26). The performance for NIR-II fluorescence imaging was assessed by intravenously injecting an aqueous solution of BP@lipid-PEG nanospheres into a normal nude mouse. Fig. 14C presents the images captured with the NIR-II imaging system (λex = 800 nm, λem = 1400 nm) before and 30 s post injection. Compared with the negligible NIR-II fluorescence signal before injection of BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres, the surficial blood vessels and liver can be immediately observed due to the strong NIR-II fluorescence of the nanospheres. The enlarged part of the image revealed the vessels in the legs of the mouse; even the small branched vessels labeled with yellow dotted line 1 were clearly observed. The BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres can not only be used for in vivo NIR-II fluorescence imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio and low background, but also can be applied for in vivo PA imaging to semi-quantify their biodistribution and pharmokinetics. As shown in Fig. 14D, BP@lipid–PEG nanosphere aqueous solutions used for in vitro PA imaging showed that the signal intensity was linearly dependent on the concentration of BP@lipid–PEG nanospheres. Further in vivo PA imaging revealed that the PA signal intensity in the liver was increased to the maximum after 8 h post injection, and then decreased to 41.5% of the maximum, which was close to that in the NIR-II fluorescence imaging (Fig. 14E).

Dual-modality PA imaging and CT. 
The combination of PA bioimaging and CT based on MXenes is a promising dual-modal imaging technique because of the following advantages. On one hand, 3D volumetric structure examined in vivo with PA imaging and 3D anatomical information obtained from CT can enhance the real-time 3D image contrast and simultaneously verify the results of each other for more accurate lineation of disease lesions. On the other hand, dual-modal imaging-guided therapy can be performed using only one component such as the Ta4C3-MXene without introducing an additional component, thus avoiding a series of problems such as complicated synthetic procedures, high cost, low production yield, and instability. Hence, it is highly advantageous to develop such an efficient PA + CT dual probe.
The 2D Ti3C2-MXene was the first discovered member and has gained the most attention in the MXene family. With growing research efforts, more and more MXene members have been developed successfully. Among them, tantalum carbide (Ta4C3) nanosheets, as a new member of 2D MXenes, not only show higher photothermal-conversion efficiency than the Ti3C2 MXene but also possess additional superior X-ray CT contrast resulting from the biocompatible Ta element with high atomic number (Z = 73) and high X-ray attenuation coefficient.54,111,112 Encouraged by the exceptional properties, Ta4C3 nanosheets modified with SP were prepared by a two-step liquid exfoliation strategy (Ta4C3–SP), which acted as all-in-one nanoplatform integrating dual-mode PA + CT imaging and effective imaging-guided in vivo photothermal ablation of tumors in mouse tumor xenografts.54 The intensity of the PA signal (1.0 a.u.) at the tumor site injected with Ta4C3–SP nanosheets increased 2.5 times compared with that of pre-injection (0.39 a.u.). Similar to the PA signals, the CT signals evaluated by Hounsfield unit (HU) values also showed a sharp enhancement with increased Ta4C3–SP concentrations. It is important to note that a much higher HU value for Ta4C3–SP was obtained (155.28 HU L g−1) than that of the commercial iodine-based CT contrast agent (CA) iopromide used in the clinic (44.765 HU L g−1). In vivo PA and CT imaging of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice exhibiting remarkably enhanced contrast was observed after 24 h post-injection of Ta4C3–SP. Furthermore, the obtained probe presented outstanding NIR photothermal performance in in vitro/vivo photothermal therapeutic experiments, which was attributed to the reasonable extinction coefficient of 4.06 L g−1 cm−1 at 808 nm, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and good photostability. Recently, 2D core–shell Ti3C2@Au nanocomposites with enhanced optical absorbance and X-ray attenuation were also constructed for PA + CT dual model imaging simultaneously with radiotherapy, which enriched the members of MXenes for multi-model imaging-guided therapy.62


Dual-modality MR imaging and CT. 
Early diagnosis and treatment are of significant value to breast cancer patients. MRI is a universally recognized technique in the detection, evaluation, and diagnosis of early breast lesions due to its high sensitivity and soft-tissue contrast. CT is regarded as one of the most powerful modalities for detecting metastases with high resolution. Both of them play important roles in diagnosing and evaluating breast cancer. Consequently, the development of MR + CT dual-modality imaging agents with imaging capabilities as well as intrinsic therapeutic properties is highly crucial. Based upon the redox reaction ability and the contrast-enhanced CT performance of the Ta4C3-MXene, Liu and coworkers55 constructed a Ta4C3-based composite by in situ growth of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) with T2-weighted MR imaging capability onto the surface of the 2D Ta4C3 MXene. The obtained Ta4C3–IONP–SP showed much stronger in vitro MR and CT signal intensity than commercial T2 contrast agents (ferumoxsil and ferumoxide) and commercial CT iodine-based contrast agents. Furthermore, the in vivo diagnostic imaging of 4T1 bearing breast-cancer nude mice allografts assisted by Ta4C3–IONP–SP composite nanosheets showed contrast-enhanced T2-weighted MR imaging capability and CT images, indicating the potential of Ta4C3–IONP–SP as MR + CT dual-modality imaging contrast probes in diagnostic imaging of breast tumors or monitoring the therapeutic process during photothermal ablation.


Tri-modality MR imaging and PA imaging and CT. 
Compared with dual-modality probes, tri-modality probes are more challenging to design, as it is difficult to integrate three different contrast agents with distinctive properties into a single nanoprobe assembly without affecting the individual functions. The Ta4C3 MXene with the additional ability of contrast-enhanced CT performance has been utilized for PA + CT and MR + CT dual-modality imaging.54,55 Owing to the advantage of the Ta4C3-MXene, a novel Ta4C3-based nanoplatform with tri-modality PA + MR + CT imaging properties was successfully developed53 by in situ growth of MnOx nanoparticles on the reducing surface of the Ta4C3-MXene, followed by modification with SP (Fig. 3D). The concept of MR + PA + CT tri-modality imaging-guided-PTT is shown in Fig. 15A. In this system, tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive T1-weighted MR signals were produced from the integrated MnOx component. Noticeably, both contrast-enhanced PA and CT imaging were achieved in the Ta4C3 MXene nanoplatform owing to the photothermal-conversion performance of Ta4C3 (for PA imaging) and high atomic number (Z) as well as high X-ray attenuation coefficient (for CT imaging). The in vitro CT signals obtained from MnOx/Ta4C3–SP were nearly three fold higher than those obtained from clinically used iodine-based iopromide (Fig. 15B, left), which indicated the potent contrast-enhanced CT imaging capability of the prepared nanosheets. The in vitro T1 relaxation time in buffer solutions at different glutathione (GSH) concentrations and different pH values showed contrast-enhanced pH- and GSH-responsive MRI performance (Fig. 15B, middle), which suggested the potential of MnOx/Ta4C3–SP as a tumor microenvironment-triggered T1-weighted MRI contrast agent. In addition, the positive correlation of the PA signals and the concentration of MnOx/Ta4C3–SP nanosheets indicated the desirable PA-imaging capability of the composite (Fig. 15B, right). The in vivo multiple imaging (CT, MR and PA) of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice intravenously injected with MnOx/Ta4C3–SP displayed remarkable contrast enhancement compared to that pre-injection (Fig. 15C). The results demonstrated the great potential of MnOx/Ta4C3–SP for tri-modality imaging and tumor therapy within a simple nanoplatform.

5. Biosensing
Compared with the current diagnostic assays, biosensing is a crucial field owing to its extensive range of sensing applications from the subtle variation of human activities such as heart rate, blood pressure, and target molecule concentration to the detection of agriculture toxins in food products and heavy metals in drinking water.113 2D layered materials with large surface area and anisotropic electron transport characteristics are promising transducer materials for biosensing applications via immobilizing biorecognition molecules on the 2D layered surfaces.114,115 In this section, the working principles and unique analytical features of 2D MXene and BPNS-based EC biosensing, FL biosensing, and ECL biosensing are highlighted. Moreover, other advanced biosensing approaches such as SPR, SERS, and wearable and colorimetric sensors are also discussed.
5.1 Electrochemical sensing
The study of the electrochemical behavior of bioactive molecules is one of the most rapidly developing scientific fields. In principle, a biosensing signal is produced and recorded via voltammetry, which is an analytical device that converts a biological response into electric current signals. To be specific, when an analyte reacts electrochemically with the surface of the working electrode, a quantitative analyte response is converted into the current signal by an electrochemical biosensor followed by the measurement of the resulting current.116 In order to detect the target analyte with high accuracy in a short response time, modification of the working electrode is typically in demand.
As an emerging 2D multipurpose nanoplatform, MXenes are reported to be a promising biosensor due to their huge specific surface area and outstanding electrical conductivity.117 Simultaneous on-line quantification of three biomarkers (uric acid, urea, and creatinine) in whole blood was achieved by implementing an MXene-modified screen-printed electrode (SPE) in a microfluidic chip.118 In order to maximise the potential of MXenes for biosensing applications, modification of MXenes to form composites to further improve the sensitivity and stability has drawn wide attention. An ultrasensitive label-free biosensor for the detection of cancer biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA) was developed by uniformly functionalizing an ultrathin Ti3C2-MXene with aminosilane.119 Recently, a second-generation electrochemical glucose biosensor was developed by utilizing the Ti3C2-MXene as a transducer platform.120 The proposed biosensing system exhibited a wide linear detection range from 50 to 27750 μM and a low limit of detection of 23.0 μM. Amyloid-β having 42-amino-acid-peptide (Aβ42) proteins is a polypeptide and is widely recognized as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. Electrochemical detection of the Aβ42 protein was achieved by using a delaminated MXene/multi-walled carbon nanotube composite (d-Ti3C2Tx/MWCNT),121 as shown in Fig. 16A. Multiple and sensitive detection of oncomiRs for accurate cancer diagnostics is still a challenge. Recently, the Mohammadniaei group proposed a synergetic amplification strategy by combining Au modified MXene electrochemical signal amplification and a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-based amplification system.69 By this synergetic strategy, the DSN-based biosensors’ assay time was shortened to 80 min, and a low limit of detection for microRNA-21 and microRNA-141 was obtained (respectively 204 aM and 138 aM) with a wide linear range from 500 aM to 50 nM. Moreover, other MXene based composites for the detection of osteopontin122 and mycobacterium tuberculosis,123 and amperometric detection of superoxide anions from HepG2 cells124 have also been reported. The continuous emergence of different applications demonstrates the great potential of MXene based biosensing and diversified diagnostics.

As the other emerging 2D materials, BPNSs is also considered to be a promising candidate for biochemical analysis. An enzymatic electrochemical biosensor with a hemoglobin–poly-L-lysine–black phosphorus (Hb@pLL–BP) nanoplatform was developed for H2O2 determination.41 A rapid rate constant (kET, 11.24 s−1) of direct electron transfer and broad response range (10 μM to 700 μM) of H2O2 concentration demonstrated that it was a promising building block for biosensing. An Hb enzymatic electrochemical biosensor for NO2− detection was also constructed from an IL and PDDA by non-covalent interactions with BPNSs.42 The modification and synergy strategies are likewise applied for constructing BPNSs in order to maximise the potential in biosensing applications. For instance, an Ag modified BPNS–glassy carbon electrode (Ag/BPNS–GCE) presented a wider linear range (0.1 nM to 10.0 μM) and a lower detection limit (0.03 nM) for the detection of mycotoxin patulin (PAT), compared with the BPNS–GCE.84Fig. 16B displays the detection of PAT based on aptamer–BP NSs; the electron transfer resistance was high when the PAT aptamer was attached on the surface of the BPNS–GCE by π–π stacking between the aptamer and BPNSs. The electron transfer resistance was decreased after adding PAT, and the detection of PAT was achieved based on the changes of impedance. The detection of PAT based on aptamer–AuNP–BPNS/GCE is shown in Fig. 16C; the thiolated aptamer was self-assembled on AuNP–BPNS/GCE by Au–S bonds. AuNP–BPNS/GCE was then subsequently incubated with 6-mercaptohexanol (MCH). Low electron transfer resistance is detected on the electrode surface in the absence of PAT. By contrast, increased electron transfer resistance was obtained in the presence of PAT due to the specific recognition of PAT by the aptamer and the release from the surface.
5.2 Fluorescent biosensing
The effect of the fluorescent probes on the detection of biomolecules in clinical diagnostics has been significantly strengthened due to their high sensitivity and selectivity. The principle of fluorescent sensing primarily depends on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the fluorophore and the quencher. The quenching efficiency is typically proportional to the concentration of analyte, which could be detected by UV-vis absorption spectra. Fluorescence quenching and recovery occur due to different affinities between the fluorophore and the quencher. MXenes and BPNSs were developed for fluorescent biosensors that not only could act as fluorophores but also could play a role of efficient nano-quenchers. The detection of an extensive range of biomolecules is achieved by MXene and BPNS based fluorescent biosensing nanoplatforms.
MXenes with fascinating electronic and optical properties have been proven to possess great potential as biosensing devices. Generally, fluorescent sensing platforms decorated with MXenes work via the quenching mechanism. The MXenes act as fluorophores or fluorescent quenchers based on the tunable photoluminescence, rich surface chemistry, and large carrier mobility for efficient FRET. Ratiometric photoluminescence pH sensors used in the dual excitation mode usually suffer from a complicated detection system and poor time resolution.125 Therefore, achieving ratiometric fluorescence detection with a single excitation mode will have a great advantage of simplifying the equipment and enhancing the time resolution. In 2018, a ratiometric fluorescent intracellular pH sensor of Ti3C2-MXene QDs applied in single excitation mode was developed by Chen,59 combining the highly pH-depend PL response of Ti3C2 QDs with the pH insensitive [Ru(dpp)3]Cl2, and quantitatively monitoring intracellular pH values was achieved. Meanwhile, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Ti3C2 MXene QDs (18.7%) was devised by doping nitrogen (N-MQDs), which showed efficient detection of H2O2 and Fe3+.126 The PLQY was further enhanced to 20.1% when Ti3C2 MXene based quantum dots were functionalized by co-doping nitrogen and phosphorus (N,P-MQDs);28 the N,P-MQDs presented bright green fluorescence for macrophage labeling and Cu2+ ion sensing (λex = 488 nm, λem = 560 nm). In these “on–off” situations, the detection depends on the specific quenching property of the MXene fluorophores.
In addition to acting as fluorophores, MXenes can also play a role of a fluorescence quenching platform due to their superior fluorescence quenching capability. Wang et al.56 devised an effective chimeric peptide-functionalized titanium carbide MXene (Pep-Ti3C2) biosensor for the detection of post-translational modification (PTM) enzymes. Fig. 17A shows the assembly of Pep-Ti3C2 and quenching-recovery principle for activity sensing of PTM enzymes. Ti3C2 MXenes were modified with SP to offer a scaffold for functional peptides. In the fluorescent nanoprobe (Pep-Ti3C2), the peptide can resist digestion catalyzed by carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) due to the modification of the C-terminal amino acid in the peptide, and thus its fluorescence was effectively quenched by the Ti3C2 MXenes. The fluorescence recovered as soon as the fluorophore moved far away from the surface of the Ti3C2 MXenes, which resulted from the removal of the modification group by a PTM enzyme-catalyzed reaction and then the digestion of the fluorophore peptide by CPY. Therefore, detection of the PTM enzyme activity can be realized by the “off–on” fluorescent nanoprobe. Other magnified fluorescent “switch-on” sensors based on MXene Ti3C2 have also been reported in recent years.127,128 These studies demonstrated the potential of MXenes as platforms for hybridization-based biosensing and related bio-applications.

Constructing a fluorescent sensing platform for the detection of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or microRNA is of interest due to the intrinsic target specificity, high sensitivity, etc.129,130 BPNSs consist of phosphorus, an essential element in the maintenance of health in humans, which imparts them with better biocompatibility and higher biosafety. In addition, the unique properties including high carrier mobility and transport anisotropy as well as layer-dependent fluorescence make them promising candidates in fluorescent biomolecule sensing systems. The identification of miRNA36 and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)79 has been realized by BPNS based biosensors. Recently, a novel BPQD based dual-signal ratiometric FL biosensor of baicalin (BAI) was developed by doping metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and silver nanoclusters (AgNCs).34 As presented in Fig. 17B, a solvothermal method was used to produce BPQD/MOF, followed by assembly with Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs) to prepare AgNC/BPQD/MOF nanohybrids. The detection of BAI was based on an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Specifically, the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by catalase was promoted after adding BAI to the aqueous suspension of nanohybrids containing catalase and H2O2, and thus the oxidation capability of H2O2 was restrained, which leads to the increment of the red-FL (630 nm) of the AgNCs. Meanwhile, negligible changes of the blue-FL (reference signal, 535 nm) were observed for BPQD/MOF. By plotting a linear relationship between IBPQDs/IAgNCs (I535/I630) and the BAI concentration (CBAI),  this biosensor enables the detection of BAI in the range of 0.01–500 μg mL−1, with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 3 ng mL−1. Guo et al.37 developed a biosensor for ultrasensitive and selective detection of dopamine (DA) utilizing BPQDs as an efficient fluorescent quencher, with a broad detection range encompassing physiological DA concentrations and a low detection limit of 0.33 nM (pH 5–9), demonstrating the promise of BPQDs in fluorescent sensing.
5.3 Electrogenerated chemiluminescence biosensing
Electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) is a powerful method combining the electrochemical and luminescence techniques to generate luminous species via an electrochemical reaction for the determination of molecules in biological and environmental analysis. It involves a light emission process with a redox reaction of electrogenerated reactants. Among various reactants, tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)32+) is the most frequently used coreactant.131,132
2D MXenes with rich transition metal chemistry and unique termination groups have high electrical conductivity (6500 S cm−1) and a negatively charged surface. This not only promotes the redox reaction but also enhances the adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the electrode surface, thus leading to magnified ECL signals. An MXene-based solid-state ECL sensor for label-free single-nucleotide mismatch discrimination in human urine was reported by the Fang group in 2018.133 A low detection limit (SN ≥ 3) of 5 nM, good reproducibility, and high stability were achieved because of the high conductivity and excellent adsorption of Ru(bpy)32+ on the surface of the MXene modified electrode. The detection of exosomes in serum with high sensitivity (125 particles per μL) was realized by using a co-reactant-free aptamer-modified Ti3C2 MXene ECL biosensor.134 Besides the pristine MXenes, MXene based composites have also been devised for maximising the potential of MXenes for biosensing. A TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystal (IOPC)/Ti3C2 QD composite film was designed as an ECL sensor for glutathione (GSH) detection.65 Liu et al.68 developed an ultrasensitive ECL biosensor for exosomes and their surface proteins by the in situ formation of an Au nanoparticle decorated Ti3C2 MXene hybrid with aptamer modification (AuNP–MXene–Apt). The construction and the working principle of the ECL biosensor for exosome detection are presented in Fig. 18A. CD63 Apt was respectively immobilized onto the surface of the MXene and the SA–PAM/GCE electrode. Based on the high specificity between Apt and the CD63 protein on the exosome surface, the exosomes were incubated in the MXene–Apt solution after the exosomes were captured by the electrode. Finally, AuNP–MXene–Apt/exosome/Apt/SA–PAM/GCE was formed by immersing in HAuCl4 solution. The obtained biosensor showed a significantly decreased detection limit (30 particles per μL), which was over 1000 times lower than that of the conventional ELISA method and the linear range was from 102 particles per μL to 105 particles per μL. The superior capability of detection was ascribed to the synergistic effects of the large surface area, excellent conductivity, and catalytic effects of AuNP–MXene–Apt.

Being different from MXenes, BPNSs can serve as a co-reactant to generate strong emission besides acting as a carrier and catalyst, owing to the ability to form positively charged BPQDs (BPQDs˙+) via hole injection.135 In consideration of the large specific surface area and outstanding conductivity of MXenes, and the excellent photothermal effect possessed by both BPQDs and MXenes, an ECL and photothermal dual-mode biosensor was fabricated by functionalizing MXenes with BPQDs (MXene–BPQD), which showed a high efficiency of exosome determination.20 As exhibited in Fig. 18B, the Ru(dcbpy)32+@BPQD ECL system can produce a strong ECL signal due to the oxidization of Ru(dcbpy)32+ catalyzed by BPQDs, while the MXene employed as a support increased the immobilization amount of Ru(dcbpy)32+ and BPQDs. Moreover, BPQDs and MXenes were judiciously used as a thermal conversion device to develop a photothermal biosensor due to their excellent photothermal effect. The detection of lysozyme in the range of 0.1–100 pg mL−1 with a detection limit of 0.029 pg mL−1 (3σ) was also achieved using the BPNS based ECL sensor.35
Exploring efficient luminophores in the ECL system is highly desired to pursue a sensitive ECL sensing platform. Recently, a novel paper-based AuNP/BPNS biosensor with excellent ECL properties was constructed,82 in which BPNSs served as the luminophore and AuNPs as a donor–acceptor. Highly sensitive microRNA (miRNA) detection was achieved according to the effective resonance energy transfer (RET) between the BPNSs and AuNPs. As exhibited in Fig. 19A, the energy transfer from BPNSs to AuNPs took place when AuNP–DNA was closely located at the surface of BPNSs, leading to the “off” ECL emission of BPNSs. After adding the DSN nuclease and target analyte, the ECL emission of BPNSs will be recovered when the AuNPs detach from the BPNS surface driven by the specific DNA–RNA binding and DSN (duplex specific nuclease) enzyme. Moreover, the formed DNA–RNA binding can be cleaved by the DSN enzyme and then the miRNA-107 was released. The other DNA hairpin was further opened, and then new DNA–RNA binding was formed and this can also be cleaved by the DSN enzyme. Therefore, the target recycling signal amplification can be detected. In this way, highly sensitive detection of miRNA-107 with a range from 0.1 pM to 15 nM was realized. The ECL responses, selectivity and stability of the sensing platform are presented in Fig. 19B–E. In order to achieve the portability and miniaturization of the platform, a paper-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) device was fabricated to use as the power source instead of the generally applied costly and unwieldy EC workstation.

5.4 Other advanced biosensing

Surface plasmon resonance based biosensing. 
Due to the extraordinary abilities of real-time and label-free detection, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has become a primary technique for in situ bio-affinity assay of diverse targets. It is based on the principle of detecting changes in the effective refractive index (RI) of the sensing medium.136 2D layered material-enhanced SPR sensors have been developed rapidly and widened the application scope of SPR sensing technology due to the large surface area and anisotropic electron transport behavior.
As an emerging 2D material, MXenes have a large hydrophilic-biocompatible surface which makes them ideal for SPR biosensing.137 An MXene-based SPR biosensor for ultrasensitive CEA detection was constructed by Wu and co-workers.138 Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)–polydopamine (PDA)–Ag nanoparticle (AgNP) was used as a signal enhancer. A detection limit of 0.07 fM with a dynamic range for CEA determination of 2 × 10−16 to 2 × 10−8 M was achieved by using this biosensing approach. Recently, an amino-functionalized Ti3C2-MXene (N-Ti3C2-MXene)-based SPR biosensor was also designed for detecting CEA applying a sandwich format signal amplification method.139 The detection procedure of the prepared SPR biosensor is displayed in Fig. 20A. The fabricated N-T3C2-MXene-based SPR biosensor exhibited a linear detection range of 0.001–1000 PM with a detection limit of 0.15 fM. These results demonstrated a promising MXene-based SPR biosensor for evaluating CEA in human serum for early diagnosis and monitoring of cancer.

Label-free detection of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization draws widespread attention in bioscience research because of its high efficacy in diagnosing complex fatal diseases such as hepatitis B and cancer and genetic disorders.140 BP/WS2 heterostructure, graphene-coated BP, and BP/graphene/TMD based SPR biosensors have been reported for the detection of DNA hybridization.141,142 Pal et al.143 further investigated the influence of BPNSs on the performance of an SPR biosensor. It demonstrated higher sensitivity than that of the graphene-based SPR biosensor owing to the unique electronic and optical properties of BPNSs, such as the direct band gap, smaller work function, higher charge carrier mobility, and better binding of molecules on the sensor surface. The vertical hybrid architectures obtained by stacking HNTs, MoS2, BPNSs, and gold films were theoretically proved to be anisotropic, ultrasensitive SPR biosensors (Fig. 20B).144 Recently, the potential of a layered BP heterostructure in an optical fiber-based SPR sensor for biosensing applications was demonstrated; the heterostructure showed higher sensitivity compared to that of the conventional fiber-optic SPR sensors.145 In addition, a guided-wave surface plasmon resonance (GWSPR) biosensor based on a BP–graphene hybrid structure with enhanced sensitivity was also reported.146 Saini et al. proposed that MXene and BPNS–MXene based SPR sensors with silicon showed significant sensitivity enhancement compared with conventional SPR and proposed SPR without silicon.70,71


Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy-based biosensing. 
The EM enhancement on the surface of target analytes typically leads to an enhanced Raman signal of adsorbed molecules, which is called surface-enhanced Raman (SERS). The long-distance EM enhancement and short-distance CE enhancement associated with the plasmonic effects and surface roughness of the substrates are the two commonly accepted major mechanism models.
2D layered materials attract tremendous attention in SERS applications due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, exploiting new 2D materials with both EM and CE enhancements for visible/NIR SERS applications is still in demand. The emerging MXenes with good metallic conductivity and rich surface chemistry are promising for SERS applications.148 Satheeshkumar149 reported a highly sensitive SERS sensor constructed by supporting a noble metal (Ag, Au, Pd) on Ti3C2Tx. This study opened the gateway for extending visible-range SERS applications of novel 2D hybrid materials. A pristine MXene was also successfully developed as a SERS substrate which showed large Raman signal enhancement of organic dyes (Fig. 20C); the highly effective SERS sensing property might be attributed to the synergy between EM and CE enhancements of the Ti3C2Tx SERS substrates.147 In addition, a BPNS based nanoplatform was also reported to be a promising 2D fingerprint probe for bio-SERS analysis. Liu et al.92 proposed a potent strategy for the construction of BP–Au nanoparticle hybrids (BP–AuNP), which exhibited superior SERS activity under NIR laser excitation with a low Raman background.


Wearable biosensors. 
A wearable biosensor is a kind of piezoresistive sensor; it works based on the characteristics of changed interlayer distances under external pressure to monitor phonations and substantial movements of the human body under different motion states such as walking, jumping, running, or other exercises. Cai and coworkers64 prepared a stretchable piezoresistive strain sensor of a Ti3C2Tx MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid, which allowed for the detection of a broad range of sensing signals from tiny deformations (phonation) to large-scale muscle movement. A novel bio-inspired Ti3C2Tx–AgNW–PDA/Ni2+ wearable sensor was also constructed via a nacre-mimetic microscale “brick-and-mortar” architecture.26 The sensing platform displayed a gauge factor greater than 200 over a range of working strains up to 83% and a high gauge factor exceeding 8700 in the strain region of 76–83%, which overcame the challenge of simultaneously retaining large stretchability (strain >55%) and high sensitivity (gauge factor >100). This remarkable performance was attributed to the combination of the Ti3C2Tx/1D Ag nanowire “brick” and poly(dopamine)/Ni2+ “mortar”, and the synergistic toughening effects from interfacial interactions. Noninvasive biomarker monitoring was also achieved with the modification of wearable electrochemical biosensors based on MXenes. For instance, a stretchable, wearable, and modular multifunctional biosensor for durable and sensitive detection of biomarkers (e.g., glucose and lactate) in sweat was designed by incorporating a novel MXene/Prussian blue (Ti3C2Tx/PB) composite. Typical electrochemical sensitivities of 35.3 μA mm−1 cm−2 for glucose and 11.4 μA mm−1 cm−2 for lactate were achieved using this artificial sweat sensor.150 By sandwiching porous MXene-impregnated tissue paper between a biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) thin sheet and an interdigitated electrode-coated PLA thin sheet,151 a flexible wearable transient pressure sensor with a low detection limit (10.2 Pa), broad range (up to 30 kPa), fast response (11 ms), low power consumption (10−8 W), great reproducibility over 10000 cycles, and excellent degradability was constructed (Fig. 21A). This sensor can be used for predicting the potential health status of patients and act as an electronic skin (E-skin) for mapping tactile stimuli (Fig. 21B). These studies demonstrated the potential of MXene based wearable biosensors for personalized health monitoring, clinical diagnosis, and next-generation artificial skins.

Colorimetric biosensing. 
As an advanced optical analysis, colorimetric biosensing has drawn tremendous attention due to its advantages of budget, convenience, high sensitivity and selectivity.152,153 The working principle of quantitative colorimetric detection is based on a color change which originates from the oxidation or reduction of some particular reagents in the presence of the analyte. The signal of the color change can be readily identified with the naked eye or a simple absorption spectra device.154
It is reported that the surface termination groups (–O, –F, –OH) of a delaminated MXene endow it with a variety of unique properties such as excellent hydrophilic, adsorption and reduction properties etc.155,156 Taking advantage of the properties, the Wang group fabricated an AgNP@Ti3C2–PAA colorimetric biosensor for label-free nanoplasmonic detection of Ag+.157 In the colorimetric nanoplasmonic strategy, PAA was utilized to improve the stability of the MXene in aqueous solution, and the excellent adsorption affinity toward Ag+ and reductive property of Ti3C2 MXenes mediated the in situ generation of plasmonic Ag NPs (Fig. 22A). The photograph of the final reaction solutions was captured by a smartphone, and the RGB (R – red, G – green, B – blue) value corresponding to the color of the photograph was output; significant color changes could be visually seen with increasing Ag+ concentrations (Fig. 22B). Moreover, the relationship between the array's response patterns (R, G, B) and the concentration of Ag+ was examined (Fig. 22C). From the best linear performance of the blue channel, the Ag+ concentration was obtained in the range of 1–150 μM with a limit of detection of 0.746 μM (Fig. 22D). Recently, self-reducing Prussian blue on Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (PB–Ti3C2Tx) with peroxidase-like activity was reported for use as a facile colorimetric biosensor for H2O2 detection.158 In addition, Li et al. reported that an MXene-Ti3C2/CuS nanocomposite presented enhanced peroxidase-like activity and sensitive colorimetric cholesterol detection.159

The history of BPNS based colorimetric biosensing is longer than that of MXenes. Inspired by the strong reducibility and excellent electron-donor capacity of stability-limited BPNSs in air, Peng et al. constructed a few-layer BP/Au (FL-BP/Au) colorimetric sensing platform;160 the sensor showed a wide detection range (1 pg mL−1 to −10 μg mL−1), high sensitivity (0.20 pg mL−1), and selectivity for detecting CEA. Furthermore, the biosensor has been used to detect CEA in colon and breast cancer clinical samples with satisfactory results. In the strategy, high catalytic activity for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction achieved by BP–Au provided a colorimetric signal output from yellow 4-NP to colorless 4-aminophenol (4-AP), as shown in Fig. 22E. The detection of CEA was thus achieved by switching off and on the catalytic activity, which resulted from adsorption of anti-CEA onto the Au surface (switched off), and then “switching on” when CEA was added. The adsorption affinity toward anti-CEA is attributed to the hydrophobic interaction and the van der Waals force between the protein and Au NPs, while the high catalytic activity of 4-NP reduction is attributed to the electron reservoir and electron-donor properties of FL-BP and the synergistic interaction of Au NPs and BPNSs.

6. Conclusions and perspectives
Briefly, the present review provides a comprehensive compilation of the advances on 2D MXene and BPNP nanomaterials for bioimaging and biosensing studies, which covers the preparation methods, surface functionalization, biosafety, and bioimaging and biosensing applications along with the corresponding working principles. Their unique physicochemical properties give them superior performance in bioimaging and biosensing. However, there exist some significant differences arising from the fundamental dissimilarities of MXenes and BPNPs. Moreover, owing to certain loopholes and insufficient information, further development and clinical trials are limited.
MXenes are composed of polyelements; the most widely studied MXene nanostructure for bioimaging and biosensing applications is Ti3C2, and the Ta4C3 MXene is generally used for multimodal imaging. They are mainly prepared by etching A from 3D MAX phases, thus introducing rich surface chemistry. The mechanical method doesn’t work for the fabrication of MXenes due to the strong and unique bond between the elements or layers. By contrast, BPNSs with a single chemical element are a family of van der Waals materials in which each atomic sheet is vertically stacked together by van der Waals forces. Hence the exfoliation process of BPNSs is much easier; both mechanical cleavage and liquid phase exfoliation can be used to prepare BPNSs, and liquid phase exfoliation is the most widely applied in the bioimaging and biosensing fields.
Surface functionalization is indispensable to enhance their stability and versatility for bioimaging and biosensing. Due to the excellent hydrophilic and negatively charged surface, MXenes are more stable than BPNSs in water-based colloidal solutions. Moreover, profiting from the rich surface terminations (–OH, –O and/or –F) with strong redox ability, functionalization molecules can easily anchor or attach to achieve multiple purposes. In comparison, due to the lack of reactive functional units, the functionalization of BPNSs by the lone-pair electrons on the BPNS surface is much more difficult; multistep modification processes are required in some cases. In comparison with MXenes, BPNSs possess better biosafety due to the abundant phosphorus element in the human body and its superior biodegradation in a moist environment. Despite the indication of desirable biosafety of MXenes and BPNSs by in vitro/vivo studies, as most in vitro/vivo toxicity studies have only conducted experiments on the cellular level or short-term hematological assay, the long-term biosafety has not been systematically explored. Moreover, the assessment of the genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity is also deficient. Therefore, further comprehensive assessment of long-term biosafety and testing in primates is in demand for clinical translation.
Although having a shorter history compared with MXenes, bioimaging using BPNSs is more advanced than that of MXenes. BPNSs or BPQDs for PA, FL and multicolor imaging, MRI, SERS, FLIM and multi-model imaging (MR + FL, MR + PA, and FL + PA) have been developed. These imaging technologies have also been achieved in MXene nanoplatforms except for FLIM. In addition, both MXenes and BPNSs have great potential in imaging-guided interventional PTT due to their excellent NIR photothermal performance. However, MXenes with rich surface chemistry and various members in the MXene family provide some additional advantages over BPNSs, for example, the Ta4C3 MXene containing the Ta element with a high atomic number (Z) and a high X-ray attenuation coefficient can be used for CT imaging without adding additional CT contrast agents, which significantly simplifies multi-model imaging assembly. With respect to biosensing, EC, FL, ECL, SPR and SERS as well as colorimetric biosensing platforms have been constructed using both MXenes and BPNSs. They show high sensitivity, selectivity, and excellent stability for the detection of various biomarkers. When being used as an ELC based sensing platform, Ti3C2Tx plays a role of endowing the composite film with a much higher conductivity and adsorption amount of Ru(bpy)32+ on the electrode surface. By contrast, BPNSs simultaneously play a role of a coreactant, carrier and catalyst. According to the unique complementarity and common photothermal effect, an MXene–BPQD composite was constructed for an ECL and photothermal dual-mode biosensor. However, research work on MXene–BPQD hybrids is rarely reported, and further study is still needed to maximise the potential of MXene–BPQD composites. It is noteworthy that there is growing interest in the fabrication of piezoresistive wearable sensors based on MXenes; however, there is no report on BPNSs being used for piezoresistive wearable sensors.
The field of MXene and BPNS related bioimaging and biosensing applications is still very new. There is ample scope for future improvements. Preparing termination-free MXenes is a promising method to impart them with magnetic properties, which can be used for MRI contrast agents without adding enthetic magnetic nanomaterials. Furthermore, the development of other MXenes such as Ti3CNx, Nb2C, and V2C for bioimaging and biosensing applications is intriguing as only Ti3C2 and Ta4C3 were used up till now. Moreover, the development of MXenes for FLIM and BPNSs for wearable biosensors may be promising.
