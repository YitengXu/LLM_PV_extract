    , Accepted 21st March 2017First published on 22nd March 2017AbstractSuccessful conversion of diatomites (SiO2) into silicon diatoms was achieved via the magnesiothermic reduction method followed by deposition of MnO2 nanosheets to fabricate unique 3D silicon-diatom@MnO2 electrodes and demonstrate their application for high-performance supercapacitors. The synergy between the microporous diatom structure and layered MnO2 nanosheets was found to produce excellent electrochemical performance evidenced by high specific capacitance (341.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1), good rate capability (47.7% retention with current increases around 20 times) and steady cycling performance (84.8% remained after 2000 cycles). The prepared asymmetric supercapacitor based on silicon diatom@MnO2 nanosheets as a positive electrode and active graphene oxide (AGO) as a negative electrode delivered a maximum power density of 2.22 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 23.2 W h kg−1, which is superior to many other silicon-based and MnO2-based materials. These outstanding performances are attributed to the unique 3D microstructures, good conductivity of silicon diatoms and the highly porous surface formed by interconnection of MnO2 nanosheets. Considering the low cost of initial materials and simplicity of the fabrication process, these silicon diatom@MnO2 nanosheet electrodes have significant potential to be used as an electrode material for inexpensive and high-performance supercapacitors.
Introduction
In the last few decades, the fabrication of complex 3D materials with unique morphologies, such as those with micro- and nano-size dimensions, large surface areas, controllable porosity and chemical composition, and have multifunctional properties, such as conductive, optical, magnetic and catalytic behaviour has been recognized as a challenging problem. A range of different lithography-based fabrication techniques developed in the microelectronics industry, including deep UV-vis, electron beam writing, X-ray, and focused ion beam have not been suitable to create these complex structures at low cost as they require high capital and operational costs resulting in low throughputs.1–3 These techniques also are not able to provide the necessary chemical composition and structural complexity to achieve desired material properties. Another approach to address these limitations is to create these 3D materials using low cost, widely available natural materials that already comprise complex 2D and 3D morphologies.4–10 It is well known that many organisms are able to synthesize inorganic structures with intricate architectures with highly ordered and complex micro- and nanoscale structures that are not possible to be produced by existing fabrication technologies.11–14 A templated synthetic approach is normally used to enhance the morphologies of these natural materials and increase their properties by their conversion into metallic, metal oxide, semiconductive and polymer structures.15–17
One of the most outstanding examples of biologically created 3D microstructures with ordered patterns of nanopores and nanostructures are single celled algae diatoms. The diatom cell wall is composed of amorphous silica which has unique photonic, mechanical, transport, catalytic and adsorption properties.18,19 So far, greater than 10000 different species of diatoms with different 3D structures containing hierarchical layers of pores of different shapes, sizes and patterns have been found. This material is relatively cheap ($200 per tonne) and is abundantly available from the mining industry as a diatomite or diatomaceous earth (DE) mineral created from fossilised diatoms. Therefore, it is not surprising that these diatom structures with their remarkable properties have attracted enormous attention to fabricate functional materials for a broad range of applications, which include filters for water purification, membranes for molecular separation, adsorbents, drug delivery, bio-encapsulation, optical and electrochemical biosensors, catalysts, and more recently for energy production.20–26
On the other hand, pseudo capacitor materials are still the most popular electrode materials all around the world. Among these materials, transition metal oxides, especially MnO2 and Mn-based materials, have gained great attention due to their high theoretical specific capacitance and low price. Zhao et al.27 fabricated Sn-doped Mn3O4/C nanocomposites, which exhibited good capacitance together with remarkable capacity retention (93% remained after 10000 cycles). Besides, a low-cost high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) delivered excellent capacitive performance, where novel γ-MnS served as a positive electrode and an eggplant-derived activated carbon as a negative electrode.28
The first MnO2-modified diatomite as an electrochemical capacitor electrode was demonstrated by Zhang et al.9 exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 202.6 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 with good stability (95.92% remained after 5000 cycles). However, the application of diatoms for energy conversion and storage is limited by the low electrical nature of the silica material, which restricts its use in processes involving electrochemistry. To address this conductivity problem for different applications, several approaches have been explored to increase the electrical properties of 3D diatom silica structures through the modification or coating of metals (Au, Ag, Pt),17,29 metal oxides and semiconductors (TiO2, MnO2, Fe3O4, NiO),9–11,14 conductive polymers, carbon and graphene.13,30 For supercapacitor application, Wen et al.13 developed a method to improve the conductivity of the diatomite material by modifying the diatom structures with graphene, followed by a growth process of MnO2. The nanocomposite synthesized by this method delivered a high specific capacitance, good rate capability and steady cycling performance. From this study and our previous work9 on the modifications of diatom silica MnO2, we observed some limitations in the surface modification approach for supercapacitors, hence came with the idea to use silicon (Si) diatoms converted from diatomites, since Si is considered to be a an excellent semiconductor material and is a desired platform for supercapacitors. Conversion of diatom silica into silicon by the magnesiothermic reduction method was successfully demonstrated by Sandhage et al.31 and adopted by our group showing promising applications of Si diatoms as photovoltaic electrodes for solar cells and degradable micro- and nanocarriers for delivery of therapeutics.14–16,30
Here, we report the conversion of nanostructured diatom frustules into nanostructured silicon semi-conductors with 3D diatom structures to be used for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor applications. Our approach is presented in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of Si-diatom@MnO2 (the magnification images show the structure of pores). 
The proposed fabrication involves two steps, including shape-preserving conversion of diatom silica into nanostructured silicon by the magnesiothermic reduction method, followed by surface modification of the silicon diatoms with MnO2 through a hydrothermal reaction and an annealing process to generate two different MnO2 morphologies (nanosheets and nanorods) of Si-diatom@MnO2 electrodes. These prepared electrodes were characterized and used to fabricate supercapacitors to demonstrate their electrochemical properties.
Experimental
Materials and chemicals
Diatom silica in the form of diatomaceous earth was obtained from Mount Sylvia Pty Ltd (Queensland, Australia). The other chemical reagents such as KMnO4, Mg and HF of analytical purity were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
Preparation of silicon diatoms
Briefly, a purified whole diatom silica material was mixed thoroughly in a tungsten boat and then heated to 650 °C for 7 h at a ramp rate of 10 °C per minute in a tube furnace under a constant flow of argon gas. The MgO/Si composite formed was treated with 2 M HCl for 5 h to remove MgO. The material was rinsed with ethanol (EtOH, 5×) to remove the formation of any residual magnesium chloride. Following the rinsing process, the silicon diatom frustules were treated with a HF/EtOH solution (1 HF (48% aq):2 EtOH) for 2 min to remove any oxide layer formed on the silicon surface, then dried and stored.
Synthesis of Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets
Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, 30 mg of the as-prepared silicon diatoms were dispersed in a KMnO4 solution (30 ml, 0.025 M) to form a homogeneous precursor through continuous ultrasonic stirring. Then the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was subsequently maintained at 120 °C for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h. After the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, the precipitates were rinsed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 6 h to obtain the product.
Preparation of Si-diatom@MnO2 nanorods
The as-prepared Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets were annealed in air at 500 °C for 4 h to obtain the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanorods.
Materials characterization
The crystalline structure and chemical composition of the samples were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (D/max 2500, Cu Kα). The morphological structures of the synthesized materials were investigated using a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Auriga FIB/SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy (NicoLET 6700 Thermo Fisher, Australia) was used for FTIR characterizations. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K with a micromeritics ASAP 2020 porosimeter. The specific surface area was calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation, and the pore size distributions were calculated from the adsorption curve by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical tests were performed on a CHI 660 Electrochemical workstation at room temperature in a three-electrode system, where 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution served as the electrolyte. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a mass ratio of 7:2:1, and painting the slurry onto a nickel foam (1 × 1 cm2) as a current collector, followed by a heat treatment at 120 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The mass of active materials on each working electrode was about 5 mg. On the other hand, a platinum plate and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The properties of the asymmetric supercapacitor were measured in a two-electrode system, where the Si-diatom@MnO2 acted as the positive electrode, AGO acted as the negative electrode, and a filter paper soaked with 1 M Na2SO4 acted as the separator and the electrolyte. The electrodes were prepared the same way as mentioned above.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were carried out to investigate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared samples. The applied potential window ranged from −0.2 to 0.8 V. CVs were measured at scan rates of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mV s−1. GCD curves were recorded at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 A g−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in the frequency range between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz with a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV versus the open-circuit potential. The specific capacitance is calculated by the following equation:  where I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the potential drop during discharge, and m is the mass of the active material in a single electrode.
Results and discussion
Characterization of diatom silica structures and chemical composition

Fig. 1 summarizes the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results to confirm the shape-preserving magnesiothermic conversion of silica to silicon diatoms. Fig. 1a and b show comparative SEM images of the typical hollow diatom structure of Aulacoseira sp. frustule before (a) and after (b) the conversion process confirming no changes in the diatom morphology. The chemical composition of the initial silica diatom structure determined by EDX analysis showed the disappearance of the oxygen peak after conversion (Fig. 1c and d) confirming the reduction of diatom silica into silicon. The small oxygen peak observed in the converted Si diatoms is due to the presence of the native oxygen layer on the silicon surface, formed upon contact with atmospheric oxygen during sample transport and handling. Fig. 1e and f present the XRD patterns of the diatom structures before and after the magnesiothermic conversion. The amorphous SiO2 of diatom silica before conversion is evident by the prominent silicon peaks (JCPDS card number 27-1402) observed for the converted diatom frustules (Fig. 1f), which indicate that the SiO2 has been converted to silicon during the conversion reaction.

Characterization of MnO2 silicon diatom composites
The structures and morphologies of the prepared Si-diatom@MnO2 composites with two different morphologies are shown in Fig. 2. The high resolution SEM (Fig. 2a) shows a typical structure of the silicon diatoms, before MnO2 modification with an average pore size of 380 nm diameter. As can be seen in Fig. 2b–d, the sizes of these pores are reduced because of the modification of MnO2 nanosheets, and the dense degree depends on the processing time (6–24 h). Initially, the MnO2 nanosheets are randomly dispersed on the surface of the silicon diatoms. Extending the reaction time causes the ultra-thin MnO2 nanosheets to interconnect with each other, and eventually form a highly porous surface. We propose that these unique MnO2 nanosheet structures can significantly enhance the specific surface area of the composite material, and consequently could create more active sites for the pseudocapacitive reaction, which is important to achieve high supercapacitor performance.

However, the mass loading of the MnO2 nanosheets should not be increased beyond its threshold as this could contribute to the agglomeration and hinder the contact between the inner active materials and the electrolyte. This example is shown in Fig. 2d, where the silicon diatom structure is covered by a large amount of MnO2 nanosheets blocking the pore structures, which is expected to have negative influence on the electrochemical performance. The SEM images shown in Fig. 2e and S1† confirm that both the lateral and inner surfaces of the diatoms are decorated with MnO2 nanosheets, which demonstrate the uniformity of the coating. The SEM image of Si-diatom@MnO2 nanorods presented in Fig. 2f indicates the successful conversion from nanosheets to nanorods via the heat treatment process. Besides, it has been proved that silicon can stay stable at such a high temperature.32,33 Thus, in the annealing process, there is only morphology conversion of MnO2 without the oxidation of Si.
However, the density of MnO2 nanorods decorated on the surface of the diatoms was much lower compared to the MnO2 nanosheets before the annealing process. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the nanorods fell from the surface of the Si-diatoms in large amounts and accumulated together outside the Si-diatom substrate. Lack of support from the substrate and improvement in conductivity of the silicon diatom@MnO2 nanorods were speculated to have a negative impact on the electrochemical performance.
In order to confirm the crystalline structure and chemical composition, the XRD patterns of the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets and Si-diatom@MnO2 nanorods were measured (Fig. 3). The diffraction peaks observed at 28.4°, 47.3°, 56.1°, 69.1° and 76.4° can be assigned to the (111), (220), (311), (400) and (331) planes, respectively, which is in accordance with the standard XRD pattern of Si (JCPDS no. 27-1402). This confirms that the diatomites were reduced to Si, which is beneficial to the electrical conductivity and plays an important role in enhancing the rate capacity of supercapacitors. The other diffraction peaks at 2θ = 12.5°, 25.2°, 37.3° and 65.6° were indexed to (001), (002), (−111) and (020) planes of a birnessite-type manganese oxide crystal (JPCDS no. 80-1098). Compared to the pure silicon diatoms, the diffraction peaks of Si didn't change much, showing a good decoration of MnO2 on the diatom surface. Furthermore, Fig. 3b shows the XRD patterns of the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanorods. Excluding the diffraction peaks of Si, the other peaks are perfectly assigned to α-MnO2 (JPCDS no. 72-1982). It is worth noting that the intensity of the diffraction peaks assigned to MnO2 was enhanced remarkably indicating the improvement in crystallinity, which could benefit the electrochemical performance.

Comparative FTIR spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) obtained from initial diatoms and their silicon replicas confirmed the successful reduction process. Fig. S2† shows a silica diatom spectrum with a strong peak around 1100 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching mode of Si–O–Si until the silicon diatom replica sample showed vibrations around 2200 cm−1, which are associated with Si–H stretching.15
The surface area and porosity of Si-diatom decorated with MnO2 nanosheets or nanorods were investigated through nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements and presented in Fig. 4. It is obvious that both isotherms follow type IV according to the IUPAC classification, suggesting the presence of mesopores formed by self-assembly of nanosheets or nanorods. According to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis, the specific surface area of the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets (41.9 m2 g−1) is much larger than that of the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanorods (24.3 m2 g−1), which is due to the loss of MnO2 nanorods from the diatom surface during the annealing process. The transition from the nanosheets to the nanorods also decreases the specific surface area of the nanocomposites because of the morphology change.

Electrochemical properties
Different structures or crystal forms will result in diverse electrochemical properties, which can be measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) tests. A comparative study of the cyclic voltammetry of Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets and pure silicon diatoms at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was carried out as shown in Fig. 5a. The pure silicon diatoms showed hardly any capacity property while Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets delivered a good electrochemical performance. In order to investigate the impact of the reaction time on the electrochemical properties, the GCD curves of Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets were obtained at different reaction times and are displayed in Fig. 5b. It is obvious that the composites with a reaction time of 12 h produced the best electrochemical properties. This phenomenon can be attributed to two reasons. On the one hand, Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets obtained at 6 h didn't exhibit the entire potential capacitive ability, which can be due to the scattered distribution of MnO2 nanosheets on the silicon diatoms. On the other hand, as the reaction times are prolonged, the MnO2 nanosheets gradually cover the surface of the silicon diatoms that eventually blocks the entire substrate. In addition, the abundant MnO2 nanosheets also cause overlapping and aggregation of the nanosheets. These two factors cause great restriction on the capacitive ability; therefore, the samples prepared at 12 h were the optimum nanocomposites for the further investigation of the electrochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 5c, cyclic voltammograms at scan rates ranging from 2 to 200 mV s−1 were firstly tested. Although there are no distinct redox peaks in the CV curves, the shape of the curves obviously deviated from the perfect rectangle, showing the nature of the MnO2 electrode. In a typical charge–discharge process of a MnO2 electrode, the pseudo-capacitance arises from the III/IV oxidation state changes on the surface of the MnO2 nanostructures as shown by the following equation:MnO2 + C+ + e− ↔ MnOOCwhere C+ represents the monovalent cations such as H+, Li+, Na+ and K+. In this charge–discharge process, the pseudo-capacitance was actually achieved by adsorption/desorption of electrolyte cations, which differ from the direct redox reaction. However, this adsorption/desorption process takes place near the surface of MnO2, showing substantial distinction from those with double-layer capacitance, since the cations are embedded in the MnO2 lattice that further change the valence of Mn. GCD curves with current densities ranging from 0.5 to 10 A g−1 are exhibited in Fig. 5d. It is clear that all the discharge curves were of great linearity and mirror symmetrical to the corresponding discharge curves, indicating a high coulombic efficiency of Si-diatom@MnO2 together with outstanding electrochemical properties.

Further analysis of the GCD curves showed that the inner resistances reflected by the IR drop were very small, which benefits from the good conductivity of the silicon diatom substrate. Based on these results, it was discovered that the unique structure of Si-diatom@MnO2 displayed superior electrochemical properties than other diatom-based materials for supercapacitors that have been reported.
With the exception of different reaction times, the morphology of the material also has an impact on the electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance curves of MnO2 nanosheets and nanorods are displayed in Fig. 6a. The results show that although both of the curves are symmetrically mirrored, the discharge time of the nanosheets is much longer than that of the nanorods, inferring better electrochemical properties. This can be attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, according to the BET results, the specific surface area declined from 41.9 m2 g−1 to 24.3 m2 g−1 during the annealing process. It is possible that some MnO2 nanosheets have fallen from the silicon diatom substrate and aggregated together during the conversion process (nanosheets to nanorods). Secondly, the crystal phase of MnO2 has also changed during the transformation as mentioned above. Typically, δ-MnO2 nanosheets turn into α-MnO2 nanorods under high temperatures, which is in accordance with crystallography. α-MnO2 is made up of double chains of MnO6 octahedra, which form two types of 1D tunnels ((1 × 1) and (2 × 2)) in the unit cell. The sizes of the (1 × 1) and (2 × 2) tunnels are about 1.89 Å and 4.6 Å, respectively, which inhibit the electrolyte ions to pass into the spaces of the α-MnO2 lattice. In contrast, δ-MnO2 is actually a layered structure with an interlamellar spacing of about 7 Å, which is much wider than the spacings in α-MnO2. This unique structure ensures the superior electrochemical properties of δ-MnO2 as an electrode material for supercapacitors, even though the crystallinity of δ-MnO2 is not as good as α-MnO2. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was also used to measure the performance of these two structures (Fig. 6b). It can be clearly seen that Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets have a better performance over Si-diatom@ MnO2 nanorods in terms of Rct at high frequency, which is 0.83 Ω vs. 1.62 Ω. These results confirm that the nanosheets provide greater contact with the electrolyte and offer more active sites during the charge–discharge process, thus showing exceptional electrochemical properties. In the low-frequency region, the linear section of MnO2 nanosheets is steeper, indicating a typical capacitive characteristic. A comparison showing the effectiveness of the Si-diatom@MnO2 against other Si-based materials for supercapacitors is presented in Table 1.34–40 The results show that the synthesized Si-diatom@MnO2 materials delivered better performance by virtue of the unique porous microstructure of silicon diatoms.

Based on these positive results, the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets were further characterized to investigate their long-term cycling performance. As shown in Fig. 7a, the specific capacitance declined from 230 F g−1 to 195 F g−1 after 2000 cycles using a current density of 5 A g−1, where 84.8% of the initial value remained. The electrochemical impedance curves before and after 2000 cycles for the electrode are also displayed in Fig. 7b. The internal resistance values of the electrode (Rs) before and after the cycles were about 2.3 and 2.4 Ω, respectively, showing minor variation. Meanwhile, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) slightly increased from 0.83 (before) to 5.4 Ω after the cycles. These results provide evidence that the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets can be an ideal material for high-performance supercapacitors.

In order to further investigate the capacitive ability of the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets electrode for real applications, an asymmetric supercapacitor using 1 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte was fabricated where Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets served as the positive electrode and activated graphene oxide (AGO) acted as the negative electrode. In the asymmetric supercapacitor, the mass of Si-diatom@MnO2 and AGO was 1.92 mg and 3.12 mg, respectively, according to the charge balance theory.41Fig. 8a displays the CV curves with the potential window ranging from 0–1 to 0–2 V, which illustrated that the curves exhibited an ideal capacitive performance with a nearly rectangular shape without any obvious redox peaks and polarization when the potential window was raised to 1.6 V. Furthermore, the CV curves with scan rates between 5 and 200 mV s−1 at the potential window of 1.6 V displayed in Fig. 8b, demonstrated a good rate capability for the asymmetric supercapacitor device. The specific capacitance based on the total weight of the positive and negative electrodes was calculated to be 65.1 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 from the GCD curves shown in Fig. 8c. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor delivered a maximum power density of 2.22 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 23.2 W h kg−1, which are higher than many other MnO2-based materials reported in the literature (Fig. 8d).42–50 Si-diatom@MnO2 shows greater and improved electrochemical properties compared with the graphitic carbon spheres@MnO2//graphitic carbon sphere asymmetric device (20 W h kg−1 at 100 W kg−1),45 NiCo2O4–MnO2//AG asymmetric cell (9.4 W h kg−1 at 175 W kg−1),44 graphene/MnO2 symmetrical device (5.0 W h kg−1 at 300 W kg−1),43 and MnO2@Ni//AC asymmetric device (7.66 W h kg−1 at 600 W kg−1).47

Finally, to demonstrate the practical application, the two as-prepared devices were connected with a green LED, which was successfully lit for over 7 min after it was charged for only 11 s (Fig. S3†). From the presented results, we can conclude that the new electrodes developed in this work based on silicon diatom@MnO2 nanosheets show great advantages over other Si-based and MnO2-based materials. The superior properties are due to the following reasons: (1) the unique 3D microstructure of silicon diatoms, (2) high specific surface area resulting from the interconnection of MnO2 nanosheets, and (3) the layered structure of δ-MnO2 allows easier intercalation for the electrolyte ions. We believe that these performances can be further improved by optimization of the preparation process and the nanosheet structure, which is the subject of the ongoing study and will be reported as a separate study.
Conclusion
In summary, the fabrication and performance of a new electrode for supercapacitors based on silicon with a 3D biologically derived morphology from diatoms (Si-diatom@MnO2) covered with a MnO2 nanostructured layer are presented. The conversion of diatom silica derived from single-celled algae diatoms into silicon diatoms is confirmed to retain their unique porous structure and cylindrical morphology by the magnesiothermic reduction method. These Si diatom structures were successfully modified with MnO2 layers comprising nanosheet and nanorod morphologies by the hydrothermal method. The fabrication of a new 3D Si-diatom@MnO2 electrode for high performance supercapacitor applications was also demonstrated.
Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets obtained at 160 °C for 12 h showed the best electrochemical performance, which delivered a high specific capacitance of 341.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, good rate capability (47.7% retention with current increases around 20 times) together with steady cycle properties (84.8% remained after 2000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor based on the Si-diatom@MnO2 nanosheets as the positive electrode and AGO as the negative electrode delivered a maximum power density of 2.22 kW kg−1 and an energy density of 23.2 W h kg−1. These outstanding electrochemical properties can be attributed to the good electrical conductivity of silicon diatoms and their unique nanostructure, which enlarged the surface area and increased the active sites exposed in the electrolyte. Considering that silicon diatoms can be obtained from inexpensive and available natural resources using the scalable conversion process, these results suggest that Si-diatom@MnO2 electrodes showed great potential to be used as a low-cost and high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors.
