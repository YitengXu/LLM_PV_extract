    , Accepted 17th May 2018First published on 17th May 2018AbstractIn order to tune the band positions of the hole-transporting material (HTM) in an interfacially engineered perovskite solar cell (PSC), random copolymers of poly(3-thiopheneacetic acid) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3TAA-co-P3HT) with different compositions were produced by oxidative polymerization. The copolymers were characterized using 1H NMR, FTIR, and UV-vis spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. Here, ZnO nanoparticles were used as the electron-transporting material (ETM) and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite was used as the light-absorbing material to form an FTO/ZnO/MAPbI3/copolymer/Ag device, of which the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was found to be dependent on the copolymer composition and reached a maximum (∼10%) at a P3TAA content of 43 mol% in the copolymer (P3). The band gaps of the copolymers as determined from UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry exhibit a staggered-gap hetero-interface configuration in which the HOMO and LUMO of P3 closely match those of MAPbI3 and give rise to the maximum PCE. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of MAPbI3/HTM samples indicate that charge transfer across the perovskite/copolymer interface was faster with a reduced recombination rate for a P3 sample. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PSCs exhibit Nyquist plots with two semicircles, which correspond to an equivalent circuit consisting of two parallel R-C and R-CPE circuits connected in series. Analysis of the data indicates that the effective electron lifetime was longest for the P3 copolymer, which indicates that the charge recombination was lower than that in the components and other copolymers. The copolymers exhibited an intermediate stability with respect to their components, and amongst the copolymers P3 exhibited the highest stability.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite materials have attracted much attention in the field of photovoltaics research as effective light-absorbing materials owing to their outstanding efficiency in thin-film solar cells.1 This can be attributed to the excellent charge carrier mobility, light absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy (∼2 meV), wide range of electron–hole diffusion lengths and tunable band gaps of lead halide perovskites.2–7 Over a period of only a few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased from 3.8%8 to a certified PCE of 22.1%.9 Despite their high efficiencies and low manufacturing costs, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have some major drawbacks, which create obstacles to their commercialization. The main issue with PSCs is a lack of long-term stability, as they are very hygroscopic in ambient conditions.10,11
The architecture of a PSC encompasses an electron transfer material (ETM, n)/perovskite, an intrinsic semiconductor (i)/a hole-transporting material (HTM, p) with an n–i–p or inverted p–i–n configuration.12 Usually, a dense metal oxide film such as TiO2 or ZnO is used as the ETM to transport electrons from the perovskite absorber, as well as blocking hole transfer. Although TiO2-based PSCs have exhibited the highest efficiency, ZnO is also an excellent ETM owing to its suitable band gap (∼3.3 eV) and high electron mobility,13 which facilitate the transport of photogenerated electrons within the cell, which is conducive to high cell performance. Besides, highly crystalline ZnO films have been developed at low temperatures without sintering, which enables ZnO to be employed as an effective ETM in much wider fields.14–17
Furthermore, the HTM plays a crucial role in determining the performance of PSC devices. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis[N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) is a common HTM and is extensively used.18,19 However, spiro-MeOTAD suffers from several limitations that make it impracticable from an industrial point of view, as (i) it is expensive because of a multi-step synthetic process involving a complex purification procedure, and (ii) for ideal cell performance it requires p-type doping, which increases the fabrication cost. Hence, further research is necessary to develop alternative HTMs with high performance, low cost, and ease of fabrication without doping for convenient application.20 Other HTMs that have been used include p-type inorganic semiconductors such as CuSCN, CuPc, CuI, Cu2O and NiO,21–26 small organic molecules (pyrene-core arylamine derivatives, triphenylamines, etc.),27,28 and conjugated polymers (e.g., poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),29,30 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),26,31 poly(3-thiopheneacetic acid) (P3TAA),32 poly[2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl[4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]] (PCPDTBT),33 and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA)),33–35etc. Among conjugated polymer-based HTMs, polythiophene and its derivatives are mostly used in organic photovoltaics owing to their considerable hole mobility, conductivity and long-term stability. At present, the PCE of P3HT-based PSCs has reached 15.3% via doping P3HT with an Li salt and pyridine derivative.36 However, the doping of P3HT with a hygroscopic Li salt and corrosive pyridine derivative is destructive to perovskite materials, as both materials decrease the stability and cell performance. Therefore, the search for a suitable undoped polythiophene derivative as an effective HTM is essential to increase the cell performance and stability. In most cases, PSC devices have been fabricated under dry or inert conditions inside a glove box, which is not viable for real outdoor applications. A maximum PCE of 13.7% has been achieved with an undoped P3HT HTM-based device in a glove box.37 Previously, Namboothiry et al. reported a PSC with a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/P3HT/Ag architecture that achieved a maximum efficiency of 5.67% under ambient conditions.38 In another work, a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI2Br/P3HT-based cell in ambient conditions exhibited a maximum PCE of 6.64%,30 which confirmed the strong effect of the fabrication conditions on the PCE of PSCs. Until now, most research on PSCs has focused on achieving higher PCEs, but the majority of studies have omitted to highlight the effects of the ambient processing conditions of all the active layers on the performance of PSCs. In our previous work, we have pointed out that the interfaces between the different layers of PSCs have substantial effects on the PCE. We have shown that the –COOH groups of poly(3-thiopheneacetic acid) (P3TAA) interact with perovskites via their –NH3 groups, which results in better mixing at the interface to facilitate easy hole transfer and increases the efficiency of the PSC from 5.85% (with P3HT as the HTM) to 7.38% when operating under the same ambient conditions.32
In order to increase the PCE, the band positions of the HTM may play a crucial role, and, to tune the band positions of the HTM in interfacially engineered PSCs, random copolymers of poly(3-thiopheneacetic acid) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3TAA-co-P3HT) with different compositions have been produced. The idea behind this is that the acetic acid substituent in P3TAA used to engineer the interface of the perovskite solar cell32 has the property of withdrawing some electrons from the thiophene ring and hence reducing the conjugation of the polymer chain, which thus affects the charge transfer process. It is hence reasonable to think that if another substituent (e.g., a hexyl group) is additionally introduced along the chain the conjugation would increase and the band positions could be matched with that of perovskite, which would induce the PCE to increase. Here, we report the successful fabrication of PSCs based on ZnO as the ETM and P3TAA-co-P3HT as the HTM with an MAPbI3 absorber, which achieved a PCE of 10% in ambient conditions (relative humidity of 70–80%) and also exhibited good stability.
Experimental section
Synthesis of copolymers
The monomers 3-thiopheneacetic acid (TAA) and 3-hexylthiophene (HT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The TAA monomer (1) was esterified with methanol by refluxing with a catalytic amount of concentrated H2SO4 for 24 h to protect the carboxylic acid group during polymerization. The HT monomer and different mole fractions of the protected monomer 3-thiophene methyl acetate (3TMA, 2) were dissolved in chloroform and then added slowly to an oxidant solution of anhydrous ferric chloride in anhydrous chloroform under an N2 atmosphere at 0 °C in a two-necked round-bottomed flask and kept under stirring for 24 h. The molar ratio of the oxidant and monomer was maintained at 4:1 in all cases. After the polymerization, a dark red copolymer, namely, P3TMA-co-P3HT (3), was precipitated by adding an excess amount of methanol. Oligomers and residual oxidant were removed by repeated washing of the precipitate with methanol and deionized water, respectively. A deprotection reaction was performed by heating P3TMA-co-P3HT (0.5 g) in 50 mL of a 2 M NaOH solution for 72 h, and it was then filtered to remove insoluble components. The water-soluble part (4) was neutralized by adding a dilute HCl solution. The resulting precipitate (P3TAA-co-P3HT, 5) was washed with deionized water, collected by centrifugation and dried in a vacuum. The whole procedure of synthesizing the copolymers with different compositions is presented in Scheme 1, and the component polymers were also synthesized via the same procedure for comparison purposes.

The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters Instruments) equipped with an ultra-Styragel column with polystyrene as a standard using THF as the eluent at 40 °C. 1H NMR spectra were used to determine the chemical structures of the copolymers and the mole percentages of the components in the copolymers. The 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1(a–d), ESI†) were in agreement with the structures of the copolymers.39–41
Synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles
ZnO NPs were synthesized via a previously reported procedure.32,42,43
Preparation of methylammonium iodide (MAI)
MAI was prepared using a method reported in the literature.44 Methylamine (40% in water, Spectrochem) was mixed with the dropwise addition of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a molar ratio of 1.2:1 at 0 °C with stirring. After being stirred for 2.5 h, the solvent (water) was removed by a rotary evaporator at 60 °C. Then, the product that was obtained was washed using diethyl ether and recrystallized from ethanol. The resulting white powder was dried at 60 °C for 24 h in a vacuum and stored in a vacuum desiccator.
Solar cell fabrication
Firstly, glass coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) (sheet resistance of 8 Ω sq−1, Dyesol) was etched by zinc dust and concentrated HCl. It was then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using a soap solution, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, each for 10 min, respectively. Then, a thin layer of ZnO nanoparticles was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The procedure was repeated three times to obtain a continuous film. Next, 461 mg lead iodide (PbI2) and 159 mg MAI were dissolved in 1 mL γ-butyrolactone (GBL) at 70 °C overnight. The MAPbI3 solution was spin-cast on the ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Later, the substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The polymeric HTM in a THF solution (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite film at 2500 rpm for 40 s. In addition, one reference device was fabricated using spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM and ZnO as the ETM. To prepare a spiro-MeOTAD solution, 80 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL of a solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene and coated on the perovskite film by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s.45 Finally, a cathode layer of 100 nm Ag was deposited on the polymeric HTM layer by thermal evaporation at an evaporation rate of 2.5 Å s−1 under vacuum conditions of 1 × 10−6 mbar. All steps of the device fabrication were carried out in ambient conditions.
Materials characterization
The 1H NMR spectra of samples were recorded with a 500 MHz Bruker instrument using DMSO-d6 as a solvent. X-ray diffraction data were recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation and fitted with a Lynx Eye detector. The data were recorded with a step size of 0.05° (2θ). The morphology and microstructural images were studied using a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EVO MA 10). The FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded on a silicon wafer using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 instrument. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded in the solid state on a quartz plate using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 8454). The PL spectra of the solid films on a quartz surface were recorded using a Fluoromax-3 instrument (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements of the MAPbI3 film with different HTMs were made with a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system (Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH). Samples were photoexcited using a 440 nm laser beam. The lifetime was calculated by fitting the decay plot generated for the MAPbI3/HTM films with a biexponential decay function of the following form:  
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 6002E) consisting of a platinum wire counter electrode, platinum working electrode, and Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode in a three-electrode cell configuration with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) internal standard at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. P3TAA-co-P3HT dissolved in THF was cast on the working electrode, which was followed by coating with Nafion. The measurements were carried out with 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the background electrolyte in dry acetonitrile. All solutions were degassed with ultrapure nitrogen, and throughout the experiment a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained.
Device characterization
The J–V characteristics of the PSCs were studied in ambient conditions using a Keithley 2401 source measurement unit. The cells were illuminated by a 150 W solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel Instruments, Newport) at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The effective cell area was limited to 0.32 cm2 using a non-reflective mask. IPCE measurements were carried out with a Newport 67005 150 W Xe lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator and a Keithley 236 source measurement unit operated by Visual Basic software. EIS measurements were performed using a Solartron SI1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz under an open-circuit DC bias and at a voltage perturbation of 10 mV. All the device formation and characterization was carried out under ambient conditions (temperature 30 °C, humidity 70–80%).
Results and discussion
Random copolymers of P3TAA and P3HT (P3TAA-co-P3HT) were synthesized according to the procedure illustrated in Scheme 1, which was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†), in which the characteristic peaks for P3TAA and P3HT are clearly observed. The yield of the product was ∼80% for all the copolymers. The intensity ratio of the areas under the peaks for the α-protons in both acetic acid and hexyl groups (signals 3 and 4) was used to calculate the mole fractions of P3TAA in the copolymers, which are presented in Table 1. It is interesting to note that at a lower feed fraction of TAA the mole fraction of TAA units in P1 and P2 was greater than the feed fraction. This may be because the reactivity of the TAA unit was higher in comparison with that of the HT unit during the oxidative polymerization. However, with an increase in the feed fraction of TAA to 50% and 75% the mole fraction of P3TAA in the copolymer was found to be lower than the feed fraction.39 The GPC traces of the synthesized polymers are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the Mw values and polydispersity indices (PDIs) of the synthesized copolymers are presented in Table 1.

The FTIR spectra of both polymers, namely, P3TAA and P3TAA-co-P3HT, are shown in Fig. 1. P3TAA displayed vibration bands at 3485 (νO–H, carboxylic acid), 2927 (νC–H, aliphatic), 1746, 1695 (νCO, carboxylic acid and H-bonded), 1168 (νC–O), and 857 (νC–H out-of-plane, thiophene ring) cm−1.32,41 P3HT exhibited characteristic vibration peaks at 2940 (νC–H, thiophene ring) and 2853 (νC–H, hexyl chain) cm−1, 1450 cm−1 for skeletal vibrations of the thiophene ring and 820–830 cm−1, which corresponds to the out-of-plane deformation vibrations of aromatic C–H bonds.40 The FTIR spectra of the copolymer P3TAA-co-P3HT display characteristic vibration bands of both units, with very wide O–H vibration peaks in the region from 3400 to 2400 cm−1. In Table S1 (ESI†) the peak positions of CO and –OH groups and thiophene rings are presented for comparison purposes. The CO group gave rise to two peaks in each case, of which one was centered at 1740 cm−1 and the other at ∼1700 cm−1, of which the first peak is usually ascribed to the stretching vibrations of non-H-bonded CO groups, whereas the other peak appears to be due to interchain H-bonded CO groups, as shown in Scheme 2. The –OH group peak appeared at lower frequencies for the copolymers than for P3TAA, which indicated a decrease in interchain H-bonding due to the incorporation of intermediate hexyl chains on thiophene moieties. It is apparent from the table that the frequency of the peak due to interchain H-bonded CO groups increased with an increase in the P3HT content of the copolymer, which indicated a decrease in the formation of interchain H-bonds.39,40 One important observation is noted, namely, that for P3 the first peak due to CO groups displayed a marked shift to a lower energy than that for P3TAA. A possible reason may be that the occurrence of intrachain H-bonding in this copolymer reached a maximum for this composition, which mostly behaves as an alternating copolymer (see Table 1). This may cause some bending of the copolymer chains, which facilitates partial stacking of the rings in the chain and may be deduced from the position of the peak due to skeletal vibrations of the thiophene unit in P3, which occurred at a lower frequency (1412 cm−1) than those of its components and also those of the other copolymer compositions, and causes better delocalization of the π electrons in the ring.

The optical properties of the copolymers were further investigated via UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The spectra of the copolymers displayed the same shape, with a broad band having a peak in the range of 416–465 nm, which arose from π–π* transitions in the conjugated polythiophene backbone. The peak positions of all the copolymers were mostly blue-shifted (Table 1) in comparison with the absorption peaks of P3HT (504 nm) and P3TAA (451 nm).32 The blue shift in the absorption peak of P3 was greater in comparison with the other peaks. This blue shift may be attributed to intrachain H-bonding in this composition of the copolymer, which makes the thiophene rings more stacked, mainly with adjacent rings of the chain, and increases the band gap. In summary, the formation of a copolymer of P3TAA with P3HT enabled the modulation of the band gap of P3TAA, and the band gap varied with the copolymer composition and reached a maximum for P3, which almost has an alternating structure. This variation of the band gap of the copolymer from those of pristine P3TAA and P3HT may arise because of the presence of intrachain hydrogen bonds among acetic acid side chains, which induced the formation of a non-planar conformation (Scheme 2) and thus affected the conjugation length.39,40

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the perovskite on a glass surface. The perovskite sample exhibited prominent diffraction peaks of MAPbI3 particles at 13.97°, 19.81°, 23.53°, 24.33°, 28.18°, 30.74°, 31.58°, 40.26°, 42.83° and 50.02°, which correspond to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), (411) and (404) Miller planes, respectively, of the tetragonal crystal structure.44,46 The absence of an XRD peak of PbI2 in the diffractogram confirms the complete conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 under the conditions used for device preparation.

The current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of optimized PSCs based on pristine P3HT, P3TAA and the copolymers are shown in Fig. 5, and the device parameters with the average PCEs of 8 different devices based on all the polymers/copolymers are given in Table 2. The PSC based on a pure P3HT HTM exhibited an average short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of 11.67 mA cm−2, 0.863 V and 0.59, respectively. With an increase in the P3TAA concentration in the copolymer, the Jsc, Voc and FF values of the devices increased to 15.68 mA cm−2, 0.952 V and 0.67, respectively, and the maximum PCE (9.98%) was achieved at 43 mole percent of P3TAA (P3), followed by a decrease with a further increase in the P3TAA concentration in the copolymer.

For comparison purposes, we made a perovskite solar cell using spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM under the same conditions, and a plot of the J–V characteristics is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), whereas the device parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). It displayed a Jsc value of 12.69 mA cm−2 and a Voc value of 0.99 V and exhibited a PCE value of 6.53%. Other workers who used spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM and ZnO NPs as the ETM achieved PCE values of 5.0%,47 5.4%,45 and 5.54%48 under ambient conditions. However, a greatly improved PCE (∼15%) was also observed with the same architecture under an inert atmosphere in a glove box,49,50 which indicated the strong effect of the fabrication and measurement conditions on the photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs. Nevertheless, for common practical applications under ambient conditions the present P3TAA-co-P3HT is an efficient HTM for fabricating PSCs.

Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the copolymer-based PSCs. The devices based on the copolymers exhibited a clear improvement in IPCE across the entire wavelength range (from around 320 to 800 nm) with a maximum conversion efficiency of 71% at 540 nm for the P3 sample, which was much higher than those for copolymers with other compositions (54–64%). Because the Jsc value of a device can also be determined from the IPCE spectra, a higher IPCE value was achieved with the P3 HTM. The integrated Jsc values calculated from the IPCE spectra for the PSCs fabricated with pristine P3TAA, P1, P2, P3, and P4 copolymer and pristine P3HT films were 11.92, 12.48, 13.32, 14.83, 11.47 and 10.81 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in agreement with the measured Jsc values determined from plots of J–V characteristics.51 This satisfactory agreement of the integrated IPCE spectra of the PSCs with their J–V characteristics confirms the relationship of the J–V curves with the IPCE spectra. The wavelength-independent improvement in IPCE suggests that the copolymer HTMs improved the charge transfer process with respect to their components over the entire wavelength region.

The working principle of the device can be well understood from the relative energy levels of each component of the device (Fig. 7). Owing to the absorption of incident photons in the perovskite absorber, excitons are generated and are separated into electrons and holes in the perovskite layer. The electrons flow from the perovskite absorber to the ZnO layer, and concomitantly the holes are transported from the perovskite layer to the copolymer HTM. The energy levels at the perovskite/HTM interface (Fig. 7) have a strong effect on the hole extraction process, which becomes feasible when a staggered-gap hetero-interface is produced. This controls hole extraction and prevents electrons from passing through the HTM layer.52 Here, the energy levels of ZnO, MAPbI3, P3HT and P3TAA were obtained from the literature.32,53–55 The corresponding energy levels of the copolymers were calculated from the oxidation onset potential in cyclic voltammetry experiments and the optical band gap determined from a Tauc's plot (ESI,† Fig. S4(a–e) and S5(a–d)). Considering the negative sign of the energies, it is evident that in comparison with the valence band of MAPbI3 the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the copolymers are higher, as is evident from the band diagram (Fig. 7), and also in comparison with the conduction band of MAPbI3 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the copolymers are higher. It is to be noted from Fig. 7 that the HOMO levels of the copolymers are much lower than those of their components P3HT and P3TAA. A probable reason for this lowering of the HOMO of the P3TAA-co-P3HT copolymers with respect to those of their components may be the occurrence of intrachain H-bonding (see the FTIR and UV-vis spectra), which causes the main chain to bend more and facilitates intrachain π-stacking of adjacent thiophene moieties, which is most extensive in P3 owing to its almost alternating structure (Scheme 2). This intrachain π-stacking facilitates additional delocalization of electrons, which makes the structure more stable in addition to the interchain stacking present in the components and causes a much greater lowering of the HOMO in the copolymers with respect to the components.

The conduction band of ZnO is in closer proximity to the conduction band of the perovskite layer, and the HOMO of the copolymer HTM is well matched with the valence band of perovskite for the separation of holes, which facilitates the charge separation process.55 The band positions of the different components facilitate successful electron transport from the conduction band of MAPbI3 to ZnO and then to the FTO electrode, and hole transport occurs from the valence band of perovskite to the copolymer HTM and finally to the Ag electrode. Interestingly, with an increase in the P3TAA content in the copolymer the HOMO level is lowered (except in P4) and becomes closer to the HOMO level of the conventional HTM spiro-MeOTAD (−5.22 eV),56 in particular in the case of P3 (−5.20 eV). Thus, the HOMO level of P3 becomes more closely matched to the valence band (−5.43 eV) of MAPbI3 than those of P1 (−5.08 eV) and P2 (−5.15 eV), which facilitates easier hole transfer to the Ag electrode. The LUMO energy (−2.72 eV) of P3 is higher than those of P1 (−2.76 eV) and P2 (−2.73 eV) with respect to the conduction band of MAPbI3 (−3.93 eV), and thus the energy difference between the conduction band of MAPbI3 and the LUMO of P3 is the greatest (1.21 eV). Hence, electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the Ag electrode is strongly inhibited, which causes less recombination in the case of P3 than in those of P1 and P2. This result implies that P3 can be used as an efficient HTM for MAPbI3-based PSCs. Our idea of introducing P3HT along the P3TAA chain therefore modulates the band positions of the HTM and increases the PCE to ∼10% under ambient conditions. In spite of the close match between the HOMO level of spiro-MeOTAD and the valence band (−5.43 eV) of MAPbI3, it exhibits a lower PCE than P3. To explain this, we measured the dc conductivity of P3, and its value is 3.8 × 10−5 S cm−1, whereas spiro-MeOTAD has a conductivity of 2.5 × 10−5 S cm−1.57 The fact that the conductivity of P3 is 1.5 times higher than that of spiro-MeOTAD may be a reason why P3 has higher hole mobility than that of spiro-MeOTAD, which contributed to the higher PCE value.
To understand the diffuse nature of the interface between MAPbI3 and the P3TAA-co-P3HT copolymer HTMs, the FTIR spectra of their mixtures are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). From the figure, it is apparent that with the increase in the P3TAA concentration in the copolymer from P1 to P4, the position of the peak due to H-bonded CO groups decreased from 1698 to 1682 cm−1, which was much lower in comparison with those for the pure copolymers (1716–1707 cm−1). Thus, remarkable shifts (18–25 cm−1) to lower frequencies occurred in the peaks due to CO groups in the copolymers, which indicated the presence of interactions between P3TAA-co-P3HT and MAPbI3.32 In turn, the peaks due to N–H stretching and bending vibrations of MAPbI3 at 3171 and 1584 cm−1,58 respectively, shifted to higher frequencies (Table S3, ESI†), which indicated that N–H bonds became H-bonded with CO groups in the copolymers, as well as the acid–base interaction between NH3 groups in MAPbI3 and –COOH groups in the copolymers. For the MAPbI3/P3TAA-co-P3HT hybrids it was observed that with an increase in the P3TAA content in the copolymers the shifts in the peaks due to –NH stretching and bending vibrations increased (as also occurred for the peak due to CO vibrations), which indicated an increase in the interaction. This interaction would cause a more diffuse interface between MAPbI3 and the P3TAA-co-P3HT copolymer with an increase in the P3TAA content.
To investigate the interfacial charge transfer process between the copolymer HTM and the MAPbI3 perovskite, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed. Quenching behavior in PL spectra is an indication of the flow of photogenerated carriers (holes) to the HTM and has been used to describe interfacial charge transfer processes in PSCs. As shown in Fig. 8, pure MAPbI3 exhibits a strong PL spectrum with an emission maximum at around 770 nm due to the creation of photogenerated excitons at a high density.55,59 It is observed from the figure that the PL intensity is very responsive to the HTM. The intensity of this peak decreased when P3HT and P3TAA were combined with the perovskite film owing to the transfer of holes from the perovskite material to the HTM, which decreased the opportunity for the recombination of excitons with holes required for radiative decay. Further quenching of PL intensity was observed when HTM layers containing copolymers were interfaced with the perovskite layer, and the maximum quenching was exhibited by P3, which suggested improved hole transport across the perovskite–HTM interface, which caused the increase in the PCE of the PSCs.

In order to understand the influence of the copolymer HTMs on the charge dissociation and charge recombination processes, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of MAPbI3/HTM samples are plotted in Fig. 9. For analysis, the TRPL curves were fitted with a biexponential decay function consisting of fast decay (τ1) and slow decay (τ2) processes, and the relevant parameters are presented in Table 3. The fast decay process results from the quenching of free charge carriers in the perovskite domain that are transported to the HTM or ETM. The slow decay process corresponds to radiative decay that arises from the recombination of free charge carriers before charge transfer.60,61 For pristine P3HT the fast-decay lifetime was 6.39 ns with a fraction of 0.32 and the slow-decay lifetime was 46.39 ns with a fraction of 0.46, which indicates that charge transfer is dominated by radiative recombination rather than charge transfer through the interface. With an increase in the P3TAA content in the copolymer up to P3, both the fast-decay lifetime and slow-decay lifetime decreased and the fraction for the fast decay process increased. This result indicates that charge transfer across the perovskite/copolymer interface is faster with reduced recombination in the P3 system.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PSCs were recorded to get a deeper insight into the differences in performance between the devices with different contents of P3TAA in the copolymer HTM at their respective open-circuit potentials. Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plots for all the PSCs. The data in the Nyquist plots can be well fitted to two distinct arcs, and the radius of the arc in the lower-frequency region clearly increases with an increase in the P3TAA concentration, except for the P4 copolymer. The experimental data were fitted to an equivalent circuit (Fig. 10 inset) consisting of parallel R-C and R-CPE elements connected in series, together with an additional contribution from the series resistance (Rs). In this equivalent-circuit model, the high-frequency arc in Nyquist plots is ascribed to the hole diffusion process through the HTM, which gives rise to the HTM resistance (RHTM) in parallel with the HTM capacitance (CHTM). The lower-frequency arc arises from the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and recombination resistance (Rrec) of the system. The recombination of photogenerated carriers in the device mainly occurs as a result of interfacial electron transfer from the ZnO nanoparticles or the perovskite material to the HTM.21,62–65 The data fitted using ZView software are shown in Table 4, in which an increase in the Rrec value of the PSCs with an increase in the P3TAA content up to 43 mol% (P3) is observed. The Rrec value of the cells fabricated with pristine P3HT, P3TAA and copolymers with other compositions was lower than that of the device based on P3. Beyond this value, the Rrec value decreased with a further increase in the P3TAA content in the copolymer to 64 mol% (P4). The increase in the Rrec value and reduction in the RHTM value indicate improved transport properties, which suggests that the Voc value and fill factor were increased by increasing the P3TAA content in the copolymer, except for P4. On the other hand, the chemical capacitance (Cμ) gradually increased from P1 to P3, which indicates that the interface capacitance is more perfectly electrically aligned for P3. These results indicate that the P3 device has enhanced charge transfer properties in comparison with the other devices.59 The effective electron lifetime (τn) (τn = Rrec × Cμ) controls the charge recombination rate in PSCs.62 P3 has the longest τn, which indicates that charge recombination is lowest, whereas the device based on pristine P3HT has the shortest electron lifetime, which suggests that the degree of charge recombination is highest.62 It is observed that the increasing trend in the electron lifetime for the different devices with the variation in the P3TAA content is in good agreement with the different PCE values of the cells. These results also suggest that changes in the electron recombination process in the different devices may be responsible for the variation in device performance, which is supported by the analysis of TRPL data.

It is interesting to understand the variation in the longevity of the cell with the copolymer composition. The longevity of PSCs is measured by exposing the cell to ambient conditions without encapsulation and measuring the PCE at different time intervals. In Fig. 11, the normalized PCE values for copolymers with different compositions are plotted against the storage time. After 10 days, a PCE retention of 55%, 36%, 38%, 48%, 42% and 31% was observed for P3TAA, P1, P2, P3, P4 and P3HT, respectively. It is necessary to mention here that a diffuse interface makes the cell more stable;32 hence, the longevity of the P3HT-based device was the lowest and that of the P3TAA-based device was the highest. The copolymers exhibited an intermediate stability with respect to their components, and amongst them the P3 copolymer exhibited the highest stability. The PCE retention a ZnO/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD device measured under ambient conditions (Fig. S7, ESI†) was 59% after ten days, which is comparable to that of the present P3TAA-co-P3HT system. These results therefore indicate that the stability of the P3TAA-co-P3HT-based cells under ambient conditions was fair, which may be ascribed to the controlled passivation of PbI2.66 The relevance of this work is that the band positions may be tuned to increase the PCE of a cell by forming a copolymer of P3TAA with P3HT, and we find that although the stability of copolymer-based cells was somewhat lower than that of a P3TAA-based cell, the PCE increased significantly.
 Fig. 11  Normalized cell efficiency plotted against storage time for PSCs containing different HTMs under ambient conditions without encapsulation. 
At present, PSCs with a monolithic architecture without an HTM have been proven to achieve high stability.67 Therefore, we made PSCs with ZnO and MAPbI3 perovskite without using any HTM and achieved a PCE of 4.08%, and the stability decreased very significantly (retention of 20% after ten days)63 (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). Our systems that included a P3HT–P3TAA copolymer as an HTM in the ZnO/MAPbI3 system exhibited much better performance (PCE of ∼10%) and higher stability (retention of 48% for P3 after 10 days). Hence, the present ZnO/MAPbI3/P3TAA-co-P3HT architecture is better than the monolithic ZnO/MAPbI3 PSC architecture in ambient conditions.
Conclusion
We have therefore been able to tune the band positions of interfacially engineered PSCs by producing P3TAA-co-P3HT copolymers with different compositions, which were used as an HTM. In an FTO/ZnO/MAPbI3/copolymer/Ag device, the PCE varied with the copolymer composition and reached a maximum at a P3TAA content of 43 mol% in the copolymer (P3). The band gaps of the copolymers exhibited a staggered-gap hetero-interface configuration, in which the HOMO and LUMO of P3 closely matched the valence and conduction bands, of MAPbI3, respectively, which caused a higher PCE in comparison with other copolymers and also the components. The EIS of the PSCs give rise to Nyquist plots with two semicircles, which correspond to an equivalent circuit consisting of parallel R-C and R-CPE elements connected in series. Analysis of the data indicates that the effective electron lifetime was longest for the P3 copolymer, which indicates that charge recombination was lower than that in the components and other copolymers in the cell. Photoluminescence spectra also suggest that the flow of holes from the perovskite layer to the P3 copolymer was easier. TRPL spectra of MAPbI3/HTM samples indicate that charge transfer across the perovskite/copolymer interface was faster and the greatest reduction in recombination occurred for the P3 sample.
According to our proposal, as mentioned in the introduction, to alleviate the problem that the acetic acid group may decrease the flow of charge in polythiophene and reduce the PCE, we used copolymers of P3TAA with P3HT as an HTM while maintaining the diffuse nature of the interface. By varying the copolymer composition, the band positions were tuned to achieve a good match with the band positions of MAPbI3, which enhanced the flow of charge and hence increased the PCE in ambient conditions. In the search for an alternative low-cost high-performance HTM, the main objective of the present study has been fulfilled, at least to a very great extent.
