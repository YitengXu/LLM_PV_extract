    , Accepted 6th November 2013First published on 6th November 2013AbstractPb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) film with a band gap of 3.6 eV was prepared on In2O3:Sn (ITO) coated glass, and then an amorphous silicon (a-Si) film with a narrow band gap of 1.8 eV was deposited on the PZT/ITO/glass. The short-circuit current of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is 2.56 mA cm−2, about 50 times greater than that of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. The energy level of the a-Si film is well matched with that of PZT film, which is beneficial to the transport of UV-visible light-induced charges in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample. The photovoltaic output can be tuned by changing the dopant type of the a-Si film, and the maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency is measured to be up to 1.25% in the PZT film with an n-type a-Si film (phosphorus doped).
Introduction
Recently, the photovoltaic mechanism of ferroelectrics, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT),1–5 (Bi,Nd)4Ti3O12 (BNT),6,7 BaTiO3 (ref. 8 and 9) and BiFeO3 (BFO),10–12 have attracted a great deal of attention because ferroelectric films are promising photovoltaic (PV) materials with switchable behavior and low cost. Many groups have put their efforts into studying the ferroelectric PV effect and enhancing the PV output of ferroelectric-based solar cells. The maximum open-circuit voltage (VOC, above 15 V) was reported in BFO films,12 however, the short-circuit current (JSC) of BFO film10 was very low (about dozens of μA cm−2). So far, the PZT film shows the highest photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) among the ferroelectric-based solar cells, due to its large remnant polarization4 and high Schottky barrier at the film–electrode interface.5 However, the reported maximum η of pure PZT film (about 0.01% (ref. 2)) is still far less than that of a crystalline silicon solar cell, which is mainly attributed to the poor conductivity and large band gap of the ferroelectrics.10 We have reported that an n+-type semiconductor Cu2O layer2 could improve the conductivity of PZT film, and the embedded Ag2O nanoparticles with a narrow band gap1 were helpful for the absorption of visible light. In these earlier works, the JSC of PZT film was enhanced greatly at the cost of the remnant polarization, which was indicated by the decrease of the VOC.
Some novel ferroelectric materials13,14 with narrow band gaps were reported, presenting a very low photovoltaic output due to their poor polarizations. Some works have focused on minimizing the band gap of typical ferroelectric material with a large polarization,15,16 however, the actual performances of photovoltaic effect have not been verified by experiment results. To improve the spectrum response at the visible light band for a typical ferroelectric film with a large band gap, it should be effective that a semiconductor material with a narrow band gap is combined with the ferroelectric film if their energy levels can match each other. The amorphous silicon film (a-Si) is an important semiconductor, which has widely been used in the area of photovoltaic power generation.17 The Fermi level of a-Si film varies from 4.0 eV to 5.3 eV,18,19 which is close to 4.6 eV of PZT film deposited by a sol–gel method.2 Therefore, the a-Si/PZT heterojunction device with enhanced photovoltaic performance is worthy of verifying.
Results and discussion
In this work, PZT film with a thickness of 330 nm was prepared on transparent In2O3:Sn (ITO) coated glass by a sol–gel method, and then an a-Si film with a thickness of 400 nm was deposited on the PZT/ITO/glass structure by sputtering, as shown in Fig. 1. The ITO layer is adopted here not only to act as a window layer for the incident light, but also to form a large Schottky barrier at the PZT/ITO interface.2,5 For the collection of the light-induced charges, Ag dot electrodes were sputtered on the top surface of the a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample (ESI Fig. S1†). As a reference sample, a typical Pt/PZT/ITO/glass capacitor was prepared under identical conditions. The XRD pattern of the PZT/ITO/glass sample shows that the PZT film is polycrystalline with a pure tetragonal perovskite phase (ESI Fig. S2†). The Raman spectrum of a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample shows a good short-range order of the amorphous silicon network and some defects in the a-Si film (ESI Fig. S2†). The remnant polarization (2Pr = 36.3 μC cm−2) of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is slightly smaller than that (2Pr = 40.7 μC cm−2) of the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. The voltage offset of polarization loop in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is much higher than that of the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. Detailed discussion can be found in ESI Fig. S3.†

Fig. 2 shows typical photovoltaic current–voltage (PVIV) characteristics of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass and Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples illuminated under simulated standard sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). When the photocurrent was recorded, the PZT films were as-grown state, remnant polarization up-state, and remnant polarization down-state, respectively. The measured values in JSC of 0.04 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.6 V can be obtained in the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample when the PZT film is in the as-grown state, as shown in Fig. 2a (black line), which is comparable to that of our previously reported work.2 This photovoltaic output can be mainly attributed to the bottom Schottky barrier (Ebi-bottom) at the PZT/ITO interface because the Ebi-bottom is much higher than the top Schottky barrier (Ebi-top) at the top Pt/PZT interface.5 Since the Ebi-bottom and Ebi-top are back-to-back and the direction of the Ebi-bottom is pointed towards the bottom ITO electrode, the light-induced holes are expelled to the bottom ITO electrode and the light-induced electrons drift to the top metal Pt one, subsequently, a positive photocurrent from Pt to ITO can be obtained. A decreased photocurrent (blue line in Fig. 2a) can be observed when the PZT film is in a remnant polarization-down state, in other words, the direction of the depolarization field due to the alignment of remnant polarization is opposite to that of the Ebi-bottom. On the contrary, an increased photocurrent (red line in Fig. 2a) occurs when the PZT film is in the remnant polarization-up state. The maximum JSC and VOC are 0.05 mA cm−2 and 0.62 V, respectively, and the maximum η (ηmax) is about 0.011% in the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample (fill factor FF = 0.37 when PZT film is in the remnant polarization-up state). The minimum η (ηmin) is about 0.006% when PZT film is in the remnant polarization-down state. If the modulation index of η is defined as γ = (ηmax − ηmin)/ηmax, the γ in the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample is about 0.45.
 Fig. 2  Photovoltaic current density–voltage (PVIV) characteristics of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass and Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples illuminated under simulated standard sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) when the PZT films were in the as-grown state (no poling voltage), remnant polarization pointing to the top Pt electrode (up-state, +10 V poling for 5 s), and remnant polarization pointing to the bottom ITO electrode (down-state, −10 V poling for 5 s), respectively. Here, the reference voltage was defined as a positive voltage applied on the bottom ITO electrode. 
As shown in Fig. 2b, it can be concluded that the photocurrent is modulated as well by the switching of remnant polarization in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample. When PZT film is in the remnant polarization-up state, the VOC and JSC of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample are 1.28 V and 2.56 mA cm−2, respectively, about 2 and 50 times greater than those of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. Note that the VOC of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is much higher than the theoretical maximum (0.7 V) of a pn homojunction in a crystalline silicon solar cell. When PZT film is in the remnant polarization-down state, the VOC and JSC decrease to 1.13 V and 2.05 mA cm−2, respectively. The calculated ηmax and ηmin are about 1.12% and 0.78% (both of FFs are about 0.34), respectively. As a result, the γ in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is about 0.30, which is slightly lower than that (0.45) in the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. It could be attributed to the decrease of the remnant polarization in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample (ESI Fig. S3†). Moreover, in an ITO/a-Si/Ag structure without PZT film (not shown), only the photocurrent can be observed and the photovoltage is zero, so, there is no photovoltaic output because the electric power is derived by the product of photocurrent and photovoltage.
The transmissivity spectra of PZT/ITO/glass and a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples show that a red shift of the absorption edge occurs when the a-Si layer is introduced to the PZT/ITO/glass sample (ESI Fig. S4†). The band gaps of a-Si and PZT film are about 1.8 and 3.6 eV, respectively. It is reasonable that the enhancement of photovoltaic output in the a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is tentatively attributed to the expansion of the spectral response range. In order to verify this assumption, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass (black line) and Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass (red line) samples were measured, as shown in Fig. 3. The spectral response range of the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample is from 280–400 nm, and the center of spectral response is about 340 nm, corresponding to the band gap of PZT film. The peak of the EQE for the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample is about 7% at about 340 nm. For the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample, two obvious changes can be seen in the EQE spectrum. One is that the peak of the EQE at 340 nm is enhanced up to 45%, which reflects that more light-induced charges in the PZT film can be collected by the external electrodes (top Ag or bottom ITO), compared with those in the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample. This result shows that the recombination rate of UV light-induced electron–hole pairs is improved greatly, which means a presence of a larger built-in field in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample. The other is that the cut-off wavelength of the spectral response band at the long wavelength region is extended to the visible light band (about 500 nm), beyond all doubt, which is not attributed to the band-to-band absorption of PZT film because the photon energy of visible light is lower than the band gap of PZT film. It is apparent that the effective photovoltaic output of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample in the visible light region (400–500 nm) is directly due to the existence of the a-Si layer.
 Fig. 3  EQE spectra of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass and Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples. Both PZT films in two the samples were in the remnant polarization-up states. The wavelength of incident monochromatic light was modulated step by step from 200 nm to 700 nm. The step value was 10 nm. 
It is confusing that the EQE of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample decreases sharply with the increase of the incident monochromatic light wavelength changing from 340 nm to 500 nm. There is an obvious shoulder at about 380 nm in the EQE curve of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample, which can not be attributed to the band gap of the a-Si layer. As we know, the EQE is obtained when the sample is illuminated under the incident monochromatic light, in other words, each value of the EQE corresponds to a certain wavelength of incident light. There are two photoactive layers in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample. One is the a-Si film responding to the UV-visible light, and the other is the PZT layer, only absorbing the UV light. For the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample, hence, it is incomplete that the performance of photovoltaic effect is evaluated by only using the monochromatic light source. When the wavelength of incident monochromatic light is 450 nm, for example, only the a-Si film is a photoactive layer is responsive, while the PZT layer can not respond to this incident light.
To analyze in-depth the photovoltaic effect of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample, a standard simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with a full spectrum was used as the light source, again. Then, four filters, named as K9, ZWB2, JB400 and JB420, respectively, were added in turn between the sample and the light source. The transmissivity of these filters are seen in ESI Fig. S5.† When the K9 filter was adopted, the wavelength band of incident light includes UV light (290–400 nm) and visible light (400–700 nm). The time-dependant photocurrent shows, as shown in Fig. 4 (black line), that the steady JSC of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is about 2.42 mA cm−2, which is close to that (2.56 mA cm−2) obtained without the K9 filter. When the K9 filter was replaced by the ZWB2 filter and the wavelength of incident light is from 280 to 400 nm (only UV light), the steady JSC (violet line) of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is about 0.91 mA cm−2, which is about 18 times greater than that of the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample (0.05 mA cm−2). Considering that the VOC of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is about 2 times greater than that of the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample (seen Fig. 2), it can be seen that the net built-in field in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is enhanced. The increment of the net built-in field can only be attributed to the contact of a-Si/PZT interface because the bottom Schottky barrier of PZT/ITO interface remains almost unchanged and the top contact of Ag/a-Si interface is ohmic in nature. When the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample was illuminated by only visible light (JB420 filter used, green line in Fig. 4), the JSC decreases to about 0.75 mA cm−2, which is about one third of that obtained with the K9 filter. Note that the photocurrent of the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample is almost zero when the JB420 filter is added between the sample and the light source. When the JB420 filter is replaced by the JB400 filter, the cut-off wavelength of illuminating light shifts a little from 400 nm to 380 nm (ESI Fig. S5†). However, it is very interesting that the JSC of the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is enhanced to about 1.72 mA cm−2, about 2.3 times more than that obtained with the JB420 filter. This fact indicates whether the visible light-induced charges in the a-Si layers can be drifted efficiently to the PZT film or not depends on the UV light-induced charges in the PZT layer.
 Fig. 4  Time-dependent short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass illuminated under incident light with different wavelength, in which the PZT film was in the remnant polarization-up state. The light source is still standard simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). When the photocurrent was recorded, K9, ZWB2, JB420, and JB400 filters were added in turn between the sample and the light source. 
In order to understand the contact nature of the a-Si/PZT heterojunction, we determined the energy levels of the a-Si film using an inelastic secondary electron cutoff of the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) energy distribution curve (ESI Fig. S6†). The work function of the a-Si film is about 4.8 eV and the Fermi level (EF) of the a-Si film is at the center of the band gap (1.8 eV, ESI Fig. S4†), which are similar to those in other published works.18,20 The energy levels of the PZT film measured by the same method can be seen in our previous work.2 The schematic energy diagram for the a-Si/PZT layers is shown in Fig. 5. Here, the difference (about 0.2 eV) of Fermi levels between the a-Si film and the PZT film is neglected. The conduction band of the PZT film is higher 0.7 eV than that of the a-Si film, however, the valance band of the PZT film is lower 1.1 eV than that of the a-Si film.
 Fig. 5  Schematic energy diagram of the a-Si/PZT heterojunction deduced by the UPS data. There is a favorable energy level alignment for the light-induced electrons moving from the PZT layer to a-Si layer. 
In the Pt/PZT/ITO/glass sample, the top and bottom Schottky barriers are back-to-back (ESI Fig. S7†), a portion of UV light-induced electrons are expelled back to the PZT film at the Pt/PZT interface and can not be collected by the top Pt electrode. Considering the Schottky barrier on ITO/PZT and the Ag/a-Si ohmic contact, the barrier ΔEe, defined as the difference of the conduction bands between the a-Si layer and PZT layer, is helpful for drifting the light-induced electrons in the a-Si layer (ea-Si) or the PZT layer (ePZT) from ITO film to Ag electrode, as shown in Fig. 5. So, it is interpretable that the photocurrent of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass is enhanced greatly when illuminated solely under UV light or visible light. As shown in Fig. 5, there is a large barrier (ΔEh) of the valance bands between the a-Si layer and PZT film. The UV light-induced hole in the PZT layer (hPZT) can move away toward the ITO electrode drifted by the Ebi-bottom and the depolarization field due to the alignment polarization. However, the ΔEh is a hindrance for the visible light-induced holes in the a-Si layer (ha-Si), as a result, there are a great number of ha-Si accumulated at the side of the a-Si layer near the a-Si/PZT interface. As is well known, the a-Si film is an indirect gap semiconductor,20 which is similar to crystalline silicon. In an indirect gap semiconductor, the light-induced electron–hole pairs are produced along with the presence of phonons for meeting the momentum conservation when the energies of the photons are larger than the band gap of the semiconductor. The excess energies beyond the band gap are released in the form of the thermal energies by the phonon, which lead to the lattice vibration near the light-induced charge, as a result, the temperature of the local region is enhanced temporarily. This is helpful for a part of those accumulated holes overcoming the ΔEh by the diffusion from a-Si layer to PZT film due to the huge difference of the holes concentration between in the a-Si layer and in the PZT film, which is similar to that in the TiO2/crystalline silicon system.21 Obviously, the shorter the wavelength of incident visible light is, the more the thermal energy is released, which can be used to explain the EQE performance at the visible light band (400–500 nm). Although the a-Si layer can also absorb the visible light with a long wavelength (500–700 nm), the ha-Si can not diffuse from the a-Si layer to PZT film due to the ΔEh, as a result, the light-induced electron–hole pairs in the a-Si film are quickly recombined again. It is easily explained that the EQE at the 500–700 nm band is almost zero in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample.
When the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is illuminated under the UV and visible light together, the ePZT and hPZT are generated in the PZT layer, at the same time, the ea-Si and ha-Si are presented in the a-Si film, as shown in Fig. 5. Both ePZT and ea-Si can be collected effectively by the top Ag electrode drifted by the ΔEe and Ebi-bottom. In the PZT layer, the hPZT and a part of the ha-Si diffused from the a-Si layers can also move away toward the bottom ITO electrode. At the side of the a-Si layer near the a-Si/PZT interface, it is unavoidable that a part of the accumulated ha-Si are recombined with a part of the ePZT, which is beneficial to minimizing the recombination probability for the hPZT in the PZT layer and the ea-Si in the a-Si film. This is analogous to the back surface field of a solar cell that has shown larger photocurrent by adding a heavily doped region adjacent to the contact.22 Therefore, it is understandable that a shoulder at the 380 nm of the EQE spectrum occurs in the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample.
According to the above mechanism of photovoltaic effect for the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass, the photovoltaic output should be modulated by adjusting the value of the ΔEe (or ΔEh), which is closely related to the Fermi level of a-Si film. In order to verify this deduction, an n-type amorphous silicon film (n-a-Si, phosphorus-doped) and a p-type one (p-a-Si, boron-doped) were deposited on the PZT/ITO/glass substrates by sputtering, respectively (ESI Fig. S8†). The doping concentrations of n-a-Si and p-a-Si are 4.6 × 1017 cm−3 and 7.4 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. When an n-a-Si layer is contacted with PZT films, the ΔEe increases and the ΔEh decreases due to the Fermi level of the n-a-Si layer shifting to the conduction band, which is beneficial to the light-induced charges transport. On the contrary, the situation is worse in the Ag/p-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample. Fig. 6 shows the PVIV curves of Ag/n-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass (red line) and Ag/p-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass (blue line) samples illuminated under simulated standard sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). As expected, the JSC and VOC of Ag/n-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample are enhanced to about 3.07 mA cm−2 and 1.36 V, respectively, and those of Ag/p-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample are about 1.05 mA cm−2 and 1.10 V, respectively. The η of the two samples are 1.25% and 0.33%, respectively. It needs to be pointed out that the VOC of Ag/n-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample is greater than that (0.83 or 1.27 eV) of a single or double junction amorphous silicon solar cell,23 which is beneficial to lowering the cost and simplifying the processing of a solar cell with a high VOC.

As a reference, the PVIV curve of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass is shown here, which is the same as that in Fig. 2. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, an a-Si film with a narrow band gap (about 1.8 eV) was successfully deposited on the top surface of ferroelectric PZT film with a wide band gap (3.6 eV). Although the difference of the band gaps between the a-Si film and the PZT film is large, the a-Si/PZT heterojunctions can effectively enhance the photovoltaic output of solar cells based on the ferroelectric PZT film. In the Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample, the photoelectric conversion efficiency reaches above 1%, which is attributed to the absorption of visible light and the matching of the energy level at the a-Si/PZT heterojunction. Our results suggest that the solar cell based on the ferroelectric is promising for photovoltaic applications.
Experimental
The In2O3:Sn (ITO, Sn/In ratio of 90/10) films were grown by sputtering under Ar pressure of 5 mTorr at a deposition temperature of 400 °C and annealed at 550 °C for 30 min in vacuum. The ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) films were prepared by a sol–gel method on the ITO/glass substrates. The PZT films were crystallized in oxygen atmosphere at 580 °C for about 2 h. The thicknesses of PZT films were controlled by repeated spin-coating times.
The amorphous silicon films were deposited by sputtering in a mixture of argon (Ar) and hydrogen (H2) plasma (the ratio of H2:Ar is fixed 1:9). The sputtering target is an undoped silicon monocrystal for the intrinsic amorphous film growth (a-Si). The deposition pressure, substrate temperature, and sputtering power are 10 mTorr, 300 °C, and 150 W, respectively. A boron-doped p-type silicon monocrystal (with a resistivity of 0.01–0.001 Ω cm, and boron concentration of 1 × 1019 cm−3), as well as a phosphorus-doped n-type silicon monocrystal (with a resistivity of 0.01–0.001 Ω cm, and a phosphorus concentration of 1 × 1019 cm−3) were used as the targets for the preparation of p-type and n-type amorphous silicon films (p-a-Si, n-a-Si), respectively. The n-a-Si and p-a-Si films were deposited under the same conditions as that of a-Si film preparation. The thicknesses of all amorphous silicon films were fixed at 400 nm modulated by sputtering times.
The crystal structures of the films were evaluated by measuring X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) cross-sectional image was generated using a Hitachi S-570. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were obtained on a modified Physical Electronics photoemission system (Kratos Axis Utra Dld) that has been incorporated into a custom-built ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) with a base pressure of 10−10 Torr. A SPECS UVS 10/35 He lamp at 21.21 eV was used as the UPS source. UV-visible light transmission and absorption characteristics were measured by a JASCO UV/VIS 550.
Polarization–voltage (P–V) hysteresis loops were examined using a precision ferroelectric analyzer from Radiant Technology. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PZT films with and without an a-Si layer were recorded by a Newport 91160 instrument under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a Newport IPCE/QE 200 within the wavelength of 200–700 nm. For Raman analysis, the samples were analyzed by a JY HR800 spectrometer. The time-dependent short-circuit current (JSC) under the illumination of standard simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5) with the optical filters were recorded by a Keithley 6517 A.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Cross-sectional SEM image of an a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass sample.	 

 	Fig. 2  Photovoltaic current density–voltage (PVIV) characteristics of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass and Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples illuminated under simulated standard sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) when the PZT films were in the as-grown state (no poling voltage), remnant polarization pointing to the top Pt electrode (up-state, +10 V poling for 5 s), and remnant polarization pointing to the bottom ITO electrode (down-state, −10 V poling for 5 s), respectively. Here, the reference voltage was defined as a positive voltage applied on the bottom ITO electrode.	 

 	Fig. 3  EQE spectra of Pt/PZT/ITO/glass and Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples. Both PZT films in two the samples were in the remnant polarization-up states. The wavelength of incident monochromatic light was modulated step by step from 200 nm to 700 nm. The step value was 10 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  Time-dependent short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass illuminated under incident light with different wavelength, in which the PZT film was in the remnant polarization-up state. The light source is still standard simulated sunlight (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). When the photocurrent was recorded, K9, ZWB2, JB420, and JB400 filters were added in turn between the sample and the light source.	 

 	Fig. 5  Schematic energy diagram of the a-Si/PZT heterojunction deduced by the UPS data. There is a favorable energy level alignment for the light-induced electrons moving from the PZT layer to a-Si layer.	 

 	Fig. 6  PVIV curves of Ag/n-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass and Ag/p-a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass samples illuminated under simulated standard sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) when the PZT films were in the remnant polarization up-state (+10 V poling for 5 s). As a reference, the PVIV curve of Ag/a-Si/PZT/ITO/glass is shown here, which is the same as that in Fig. 2.
