    , Accepted 30th September 2019First published on 30th September 2019AbstractHerein, for the first time, we find that the surface mass transport properties of catalysts play critical roles in determining the electrocatalytic NRR selectivity over the competitive HER in aqueous media on metallic Cu. In particular, by controlling the monolayer thickness of Cu nanoparticles with a minimum mass transport barrier, the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the NRR can be dramatically enhanced to 33% in the H-type cell test and even to 59% in a new-type Zn–N2 aqueous battery.
Nitrogen (N2) fixation for ammonia (NH3) synthesis is one of the most challenging and significant chemical transformation processes demanded for fertilizers, pharmaceuticals and many industrial production areas. Current industrial NH3 production heavily relies on the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch (H–B) process, which consumes a huge amount of energy and causes severely hazardous carbon emission.1,2 Recently, as a potential alternative to the traditional H–B method, the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has emerged as a sustainable approach for producing NH3 from N2 and H2O under ambient conditions, which can be powered by renewable electricity.3
During the electrocatalytic process of the NRR, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) always occupies most of the protons and electrons, leading to a severe selectivity issue of the NRR (low faradaic efficiency, FE),4,5 as seen in the following reaction mechanisms of the HER and NRR under alkaline conditions (relatively low proton concentration):6,7 H2O + e− → H* + OH−(1) HER: H2O + e− + H* → H2 + H2O(2) H* + H* → H2(3) NRR: N2 + H* → *NNH(4) *NNH → NH3 (multistep reactions)(5)
From the perspective of thermodynamics, due to the much higher energy barrier of N2 activation (reaction (4)) than that of generation of H2 (reaction (2) or (3)),8 most of the produced H* through reaction (1) is involved in the HER rather than the NRR, resulting in the extremely low selectivity of the NRR. For improving NRR selectivity, a number of electrocatalysts have been recently developed, including noble metals,9 non-noble metals,10 transition metal oxides,11 metal nitrides,12 metal sulphides,13 metal carbides,14 metal-free compounds,15 carbons16etc. Unfortunately, most of them failed to boost the selectivity of the aqueous NRR, with a low FE of less than 10% and even less than 1%.
Therefore, developing suitable catalysts for the electrochemical NRR in aqueous media with high selectivity is extremely important but still challenging. To this end, designing a catalyst with relatively low activity for reaction (1) to decelerate the generation of H* could reduce the concentration of H* (c(H*)), and thus effectively decrease the interference of the HER. On the other hand, the existence of a diffusion gradient caused by a surface transport barrier significantly lowers the local concentration of N2 (c(N2)) near the catalyst surface compared with the bulk concentration.17–19 Additionally, the HER in (alkaline) aqueous solution is mainly limited by the rate of reaction (1), rather than the proton availability.20,21 Hence, reducing the transport barrier may increase the local c(N2) around the catalyst surface. Therefore, in an aqueous system, the ideal method for achieving high NRR selectivity is to develop a suitable catalyst with a surface transport-favorable structure to decelerate the generation of H* as well as increase the local c(N2), as shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  (A) Under general conditions, high c(H*) but low local c(N2) leads to low NRR selectivity; (B) with a suitable catalyst but unfavorable surface transport structure, both low c(H*) and low local c(N2) lead to the low NRR selectivity; (C) with a suitable catalyst and favorable surface transport structure, low c(H*) and high local c(N2) lead to high NRR selectivity. 
As a common metal element, copper (Cu) has been found to be a necessary cofactor for the symbiotic nitrogen fixation process in nitrogenase during legume nodulation.22 Additionally, Cu has also been proved to possess relatively high ability to suppress the HER,23 and thus the Cu catalyst may provide a relatively low H* concentration condition. Herein, for the first time, we studied the electrocatalytic behavior of metallic Cu toward the NRR. In this study, by controlling the thickness of Cu layers and thus tuning the surface mass transport properties, the effect of Cu nanostructures on the electrocatalytic efficiency for N2 reduction was investigated. To study accurately the reaction process and mechanism of N2 reduction, a 15N isotopic labeling experiment and in situ FTIR measurements were carried out. Moreover, the NRR mechanism on Cu nanostructures was further revealed by DFT calculations.
Experimentally, the Cu-based catalysts were constructed by facile galvanostatic electrodepositing methods on carbon paper (CP) substrates (see the Experimental section for details). The thickness of the surface nanostructure was simply controlled by tuning the deposition time from 2, 10, 30 to 60 min, and the obtained samples are denoted as Cu-2, Cu-10, Cu-30 and Cu-60, respectively. Along with the increase in the electrodepositing time, the thickness of the nanoparticle layer gradually increases, as revealed by the increase of the diameter of the carbon fibre in CP from 8, 10, 12 to 14 μm (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). In particular, the Cu-2 sample exhibits a nearly monolayer of copper nanoparticles with almost complete coverage on the surface of the carbon fibres. With the electrodeposition time less than 2 min, the surface of the carbon fibres cannot be fully covered with Cu nanoparticles (Fig. S2, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the prepared Cu nanoparticles presents a pure metallic phase of copper (Cu #04-0836).

To investigate the electrocatalytic performances of these Cu-based materials toward the NRR, a gas-tight H-type electrochemical cell equipped with a piece of 211 Nafion membrane was employed (Fig. S4, ESI†). The produced NH3 in the electrolyte was determined by the indophenol blue method with pre-established calibration curves (Fig. S5A and B, ESI†).24 The possible product of N2H4 was detected through the spectrophotometric method put forward by Watt and Chrisp (Fig. S5C and D, ESI†),25 and the results showed that no N2H4 was produced in all NRR tests in this work. Additionally, the blank CP exhibits negligible activity toward the NRR (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†).
It should be noted that at potentials higher than 0 V, no N2 reduction occurs (Fig. S8, ESI†). Therefore, in this work, the NRR is studied at potentials below 0 V. As an important indicator of catalytic selectivity, the FE values of all the samples decrease with the decrease of working potential, as presented in Fig. 2A and Fig. S9 (ESI†). This may be caused by the increase of local c(H*) at more negative potentials, due to the enhanced driving force (over-potential) toward the H* generation process (reaction (1)). As a result, the maximum FE values of all the Cu-based samples are achieved at 0.0 V, with values of 33.0% (Cu-2), 11.0% (Cu-10), 2.5% (Cu-30) and 1.3% (Cu-60), respectively. The Cu-2 sample with a nanoparticle monolayer has the minimum surface mass transport barrier, and thus exhibits the best NRR selectivity with the highest FE of 33.0% among all the samples. Meanwhile, as seen in Fig. S9B, D, F and H (ESI†), the UV-Vis absorption peak intensities of the electrolyte after electrolyzation in Ar at 0 V for all the Cu-based materials are much lower than those obtained in an N2 atmosphere at 0 V, indicating that the external interference is negligible and the NH3 molecules indeed originate from the electrocatalytic NRR.

(A) FE values obtained from the studied Cu-based catalysts at different potentials; (B) mass normalized R values on the Cu-based catalysts at different potentials; (C) 1H NMR spectra of the 15N isotopic labeling experiment; (D) the cycle test results of Cu-2 at 0 V; (E) the scheme of a Zn–N2 aqueous battery; and (F) polarization and power curves of the Zn–N2 aqueous battery with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. 
To better understand the influence of mass transport on the reaction activity, the intrinsic activity can be expressed by the NH3 formation rate (R) normalized with the mass (confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, Table S1, ESI†) and electrochemically active area (ECSA) of the Cu metal,26 as shown in Fig. 2B and Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†). Apparently, for all the samples, the intrinsic activity also decreases with the increase of over-potential and surface nanostructure thickness, agreeing with the above trend of FE. It is obvious that the largest mass activity is also achieved from Cu-2 (12.0 μg h−1 mg−1) at 0.0 V, which is much larger than those of Cu-10 (6.3 μg h−1 mg−1), Cu-30 (4.4 μg h−1 mg−1) and Cu-60 (2.1 μg h−1 mg−1). Similarly, the mass activity of Cu-0 decreases from 12.0 to 2.1 μg h−1 cm−2 with the potential changing from 0.0 to −0.4 V. Notably, the selectivity and activity of these Cu-based catalysts are much higher than those of most of the previously reported catalysts under the same conditions (Table S2, ESI†). These results strongly demonstrate the remarkable ability of Cu toward catalyzing the NRR, and removing the surface transport barrier indeed greatly promotes the NRR selectivity. This also strongly confirms the critical role of local c(H*) and c(N2) in tuning NRR selectivity.
On the other hand, upon removing the deposited surface Cu nanoparticle layer, the charge transfer resistance (RCT) of the Cu-based catalysts shows a significant increase, as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S12A, ESI†). The increased RCT means the limited electron availability at the catalyst surface, which could significantly restrict the HER kinetics but with negligible impact on the NRR reaction rate, since the determining factor for the HER is the electron transfer step while the rate-limiting step for the NRR is the local c(N2) on the catalyst surface. Thus, the increased RCT is beneficial for the NRR selectivity by weakening the HER.27 In addition, the decrease of surface nanostructure thickness not only promotes the NRR performance but also the HER activity (Fig. S12B, ESI†). This may be caused by the local pH change at large working current, which is different from the change in local c(N2) for the NRR.28
Considering the possible disturbance in the atmospheric environment, the 15N isotopic labeling experiment was also carried out. In the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra (Fig. 2C), the doublet coupling of 15NH4+ is detected in the electrolyte with 15N2 as the feeding gas, which agrees well with the 1H NMR spectrum of the standard sample of 15NH4Cl. However, when 15N2 was replaced by 14N2 during the electrocatalysis, only triplet coupling for 14NH4+ was detected. These isotopic labeling experimental results strongly confirm the electroreduction of N2 to NH3 on the surface of the as-synthesized Cu-based catalysts. To assess the stability of these Cu-based catalysts, in consideration of the highest FE of Cu-2, it was employed as the representative sample for the five recycling tests at 0 V. As seen in Fig. 2D, the FE and NH3 synthesis rate show no apparent decrease after five cycle tests (totally 10 h), indicating the good stability of the synthesized Cu catalysts for the NRR.
Finally, a primary Zn–N2 battery for simultaneous NH3 synthesis and electricity generation was successfully assembled as a new application for the NRR (Fig. 2E and Fig. S13, ESI†). It should be noted that such a Zn–N2 battery has rarely been constructed in aqueous systems. The electrochemical reactions on each electrode are described as follows: Cathode: N2 + 6H2O + 6e− → 2NH3 + 6OH−(6) Anode: Zn + 2OH− − 2e− → ZnO + H2O(7) Overall reaction: 3Zn + N2 + 3H2O → NH3 + 3ZnO(8)
As seen in Fig. 2F, the cell with Cu-2 as the NRR catalyst delivers a maximum current density and power density of 280 μA cm−2 and 10.1 μW cm−2, respectively, which are even much larger than those of the reported H2–N2 battery catalyzed by nitrogenase.29 The FE for the NRR of the Zn–N2 battery was calculated to be 59%, which is two times higher than that of the reported enzyme catalyzed H2–N2 battery.29 It should be pointed out that as shown in Fig. S13C (ESI†), the absorbance of the electrolyte after the battery test in Ar is negligible compared to that in N2, indicating almost no N2-to-NH3 conversion in the Ar atmosphere.
In order to recognize the active sites and gain atomistic insight into the NRR processes on the copper surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed based on the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (see the Experimental section for details). As seen in Fig. 3A, Fig. S14, S15 and Table S3 (ESI†), the N2 molecule can be effectively adsorbed on the (220) face in the end-on mode, with a much higher N2 adsorption energy of −0.41 eV than that of −0.13 eV for (111) and −0.14 eV for (200) faces. Additionally, the NN bond also slightly elongates from 1.11 Å to 1.127 Å with a transferred charge of 0.1e. These calculations strongly demonstrate the activation of the N2 molecule on the Cu(220) face. Hence, the (220) face is identified as the most possible active site for the electrocatalytic NRR in this work.

(A) The optimized structure of N2 adsorption on Cu(220); (B) the in situ FTIR spectra of the Cu-2 catalyst in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH; (C) the enlarged partial view of the in situ FTIR spectra; and (D) the Gibbs free energy diagram of the NRR on Cu(220) and the suggested pathway. 
To make clear the reaction pathway of the NRR on these Cu-based catalysts, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy tests were conducted to detect the reaction intermediates. Fig. 3B and C shows a series of IR spectra collected during the electrochemical NRR from 0.05 to −0.4 V, with the spectrum at 0.2 V as the background. The weak band observed at 1445 cm−1 is attributed to the H–N–H bending.30,31 Another two weak peaks appearing at 1701 cm−1 and 1557 cm−1 belong to the surface NH4+ species.32,33 These N-related peaks are only found under the N2 conditions (Fig. S16, ESI†), strongly indicating the successful reduction of N2 to NH3 with the existence of –NH2 intermediates.
Based on the above analysis of active sites and reaction intermediates, the energy profiles of electrocatalytic NRR processes on Cu(220) were calculated. The Gibbs free energy profile and reaction mechanism of the NRR on Cu are presented in Fig. 3D and Fig. S17 (ESI†). The N2 molecule is firstly adsorbed and then activated (*N2) on the Cu(220) face with a small energy gap of 0.1 eV. The rate-limiting step is identified to be the subsequent protonation step, i.e., *N2 → *NNH, which needs to overcome an energy barrier of 1.3 eV. The following steps of proton and electron pair addition on the adsorbed *NNH species are free of energy barriers. In particular, the H–N–H bending detected by in situ FTIR agrees well with the calculated *NH2 intermediate, further confirming the reasonable calculated reaction mechanism.
In summary, an extraordinary ultrahigh FE of 33% has been achieved over metallic Cu toward the NRR in aqueous medium by tuning the surface mass transport structure. Additionally, an innovative Zn–N2 battery has been fabricated for the first time for simultaneous NH3 synthesis and electricity generation, which delivers an unprecedented FE of 59% for the NRR in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, an associated mechanism of the NRR over the highly selective Cu-based catalyst was put forward based on the DFT calculations and in situ FTIR results. The present work not only develops a highly selective Cu-based NRR electrocatalyst, but also experimentally demonstrates the critical role of surface mass transport in determining the NRR selectivity, which is of great significance for designing highly effective NRR electrocatalysts and understanding the NRR process.
