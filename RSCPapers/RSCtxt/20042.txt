    , Accepted 15th January 2018First published on 15th January 2018AbstractQuinoxaline (Qx) has an easily modifiable structure, which allows for fine-tuning its properties through optimizing the length of side chains and the kinds of aromatic rings in conjugated side chains. Qx based polymer PBDTT-ffQx with alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene side chains shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.47% in nonfullerene solar cells. In this work, we change the alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene side chains to alkyl substituted fluorothiophene in the Qx unit and employ the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit with different lengths of alkyl thiophene side chains to obtain two new Qx based polymers, named TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2, respectively. The TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film has clear nanoscale phase separation and a suitable domain size, and the device with the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film shows lower geminate recombination and higher charge mobility than those with TTFQx-T2:ITIC. Therefore, the TTFQx-T1:ITIC based device exhibits a higher PCE of 10.52% than that based on the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend with a moderate PCE of 7.22%. The inverted devices from TTFQx-T1:ITIC blends with a larger active area of 16 mm2 than the conventional device (4.5 mm2) show a good PCE of 9.21%. The results highlight that the alkyl lengths and the kinds of aromatic rings in side chains are significant for the development of high performance photovoltaic polymers. Optimizing the conjugated side chains of Qx based polymers is an efficient way to improve photovoltaic properties, and Qx based polymers are potential candidates for fabricating highly efficient polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
With the continuous increase of global carbon emission, fuel and coal resources have been gradually depleted and environmental pollution is getting more serious.1 Sustainable and renewable energy resources such as solar energy have been broadly investigated.2–4 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most efficient devices to utilize solar energy due to their low cost, lightweight, flexibility and ability to fabricate semitransparent devices.5–7 Generally, BHJ PSCs use conjugated polymers as electron donor materials and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) or ITIC (3,9-bis[2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)]-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) as electron acceptor materials.8,9 Conjugated polymers are commonly obtained from the copolymerization of an electron-donating (D) unit and electron-accepting (A) unit.10,11 In recent years, a library of polymer donor materials have been designed and synthesized to match PC71BM and ITIC with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% in single junction devices.12–16
Quinoxaline (Qx) is a typical electron deficient building block which is used to synthesize many D–A conjugated polymers due to its unique advantages.17 Qx has an easily modifiable structure which allows for fine-tuning its properties through structural modifications,18,19 for example, introducing side chains to tune the solubility and aggregation and introducing aromatic rings to expand the vertical conjugation and functional groups such as strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms to modulate the molecular energy level.20,21 Qx monomers are also easily synthesized with high yields. Our group has performed some research studies on Qx based polymers towards high performance PSCs. Firstly, we synthesized a Qx unit with meta-position fluorine benzene side chains to obtain a tetrafluoroquinoxaline based polymer PBDTT-ffQx (Fig. 1); the PCE of PBDTT-ffQx:PC71BM and PBDTT-ffQx:ITIC based devices reached 8.3% and 8.47%, respectively.22 Then, we changed the fluorine position in the benzene side chains of the Qx unit from meta-position to para-position to synthesize EHFQx-T, with PCE reaching 8.44% while blending with PC71BM.23 Through introducing two more fluorines into Qx side chains, a hexafluoroquinoxaline based polymer HFQx-T was synthesized; HFQx-T showed a higher PCE up to 9.4% when blending with ITIC.24 Optimization of the conjugated side chains of Qx based polymers is an efficient method towards high performance PSCs.

As well known, thiophene possesses higher electron density and smaller steric hindrance than benzene, providing better absorption and charge transport. Optimizing the position and the numbers of thiophene in the conjugated backbone and side chains can increase absorption and tune the torsion angle to increase coplanarity.25 In addition, the length of alkyl chains can change intermolecular interactions to affect the interchain π–π stacking and the charge mobility.26–28 Therefore, we change the Qx side chains from alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene to alkyl substituted fluorothiophene yielding a new Qx based monomer, which copolymerizes the benzodithiophene (BDT) building block with different alkylated thiophene side chains((4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane)) or (4,8-bis(5-(2-butyloctyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) to obtain two new Qx based polymers, named TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2, respectively. The molecular structures of the polymers are shown in Fig. 2. In this work, the optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 have been well characterized. The PCE of TTFQx-T1:ITIC based devices got improved to 10.52% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.88 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69 while the PCE of TTFQx-T2:ITIC based devices reached 7.22% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 13.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.56 with a simple thermal annealing (TA) treatment. Moreover, the inverted devices made of TTFQx-T1:ITIC with a larger active area of 16 mm2 show a good PCE of 9.21%. Changing the conjugated side chain from alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene to alkyl substituted fluorothiophene in the Qx unit indeed efficiently improves the performance of PSCs. Shorter alkyl side chains in the BDT donor unit are beneficial for improving photovoltaic properties. The results indicate that the alkyl substituted fluorothiophene Qx is a promising electron accepting block in constructing highly efficient optoelectronic polymers.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the monomers, TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 are shown in Scheme 1 and experimental details are given in the ESI.† Compound 2 was obtained by a classical alkylation reaction using lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) as a non-nucleophilic strong base. Compound 3 was synthesized by introducing trimethylsilyl as a protective group. Compound 4 was obtained from compound 3 using N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as a fluorinating reagent. Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) was used as a desilication agent to obtain compound 5. Compound 6 was synthesized via a nucleophilic substitution reaction as a yellow liquid. Compound 8 was obtained from compound 7 through a reduction reaction using NaBH4. Compounds 6 and 8 were dissolved in glacial acetic acid at 90 °C overnight to get compound 9. Compound 10 was synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction at 110 °C using PdCl2(PPh3)2 as the catalyst. The monomer (M1) was prepared by a bromination reaction using NBS as the brominating reagent. The target polymers TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 were obtained by Stille coupling polymerization in toluene at 110 °C with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. All crude products were purified by silica gel column chromatography, and the intermediates and target products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy (as shown in Fig. S1–S11†). The polymers were purified by continuous Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, acetone and chloroform (CF), respectively. Both TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 have good solubility in common organic solvents such as CF, chlorobenzene (CB), toluene, etc. The molecular weights of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 were determined by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C and polystyrene as the standard. The GPC curves are shown in Fig. S13a;†TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 24.8 kDa and 13.7 kDa, with the dispersity (Ð: Mw/Mn) of 2.87 and 2.31, respectively. The thermal properties of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA curves are shown in Fig. S13b.† The onset temperatures at 5% weight loss for TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 are both 406 °C under nitrogen, which demonstrates that the thermal stability of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 is good enough for device applications.29 The related data including the molecular weights and thermal properties of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 are summarized in Table 1.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 in dilute chloroform solution and in films are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The absorption coefficients of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 are displayed in Fig. S14.† The normalized absorption spectra of pure TTFQx-T1, TTFQx-T2, ITIC and PC71BM films are shown in Fig. 3c. The characteristic optical data are summarized in Table 2. Three absorption peaks can be observed in TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 in the range of 300–800 nm. The broad and intense absorption band in the range of 500–800 nm of the TTFQx-T1 film is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the D–A unit while the low absorption in the range of 400–500 nm belongs to the π–π* transition of the polymer backbone.30 As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the two long-wavelength maxima of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 films are red-shifted compared to those in CF solution spectra, which indicates more planarity and aggregation in the solid state.31 We further investigated the relationship between temperature and absorption to explore the aggregation of polymers in solution. As shown in Fig. S15,† with the temperature increasing from 30 °C to 90 °C, the long-wavelength absorption peak of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 in chlorobenzene (CB) solution is slightly blue-shifted which could be associated with changes in the chain conformation.32 The absorption onset wavelengths (λonset) of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 films are 736 nm and 724 nm corresponding to the optical bandgap (Eg = 1240/λonset) of 1.69 eV and 1.71 eV, respectively. The maximum absorption coefficient for TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 is 4.73 × 104 and 4.64 × 104 cm−1, respectively. The relatively better light harvesting can be partially beneficial for higher Jsc for TTFQx-T1 based devices.

The electrochemical energy levels of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as the standard and tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile) as the supporting electrolyte.33 The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3d and the related electrochemical data are listed in Table 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eoxon) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were calculated using the equation of ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg(eV).34 The HOMO levels of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 are −5.31 eV and −5.38 eV, and the LUMO levels of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 are −3.62 eV and −3.67 eV, respectively. Commonly, the band offset between the LUMO energy level of acceptor materials and the HOMO energy level of donor materials is in proportion to the Voc.35 The HOMO level of TTFQx-T2 is a little lower than that of TTFQx-T1 which probably leads to higher Voc.
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements (Fig. 4) were used to check the exciton dissociation and charge transport in the polymer/acceptor blend films.36 The pure TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 show broad PL emission ranging from 650 to 870 nm with 640 nm excitation. The PL emission is quenched by 86.1 and 73.7% in TTFQx-T1:PC71BM and TTFQx-T2:PC71BM blend films, respectively, and by 92.5 and 90.2% in TTFQx-T1:PC71BM and TTFQx-T2:PC71BM blend films with DIO additive. The DIO treatment can obviously improve the quenching efficiency which contributed to better exciton dissociation and charge transport towards higher Jsc. The PL emission of TTFQx-T1:ITIC and TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend films is quenched by 95.9 and 95.8%, respectively, and after TA treatment by 96.8 and 96.6%. TA treatment also shows some effects on exciton dissociation and charge transport to improve the Jsc.37

2.3. Photovoltaic properties
To further investigate the photovoltaic properties of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2, conventional photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC71BM/zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac)/Al or ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:ITIC/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al. Through carefully modulating the D/A weight ratio, solvent additives and TA conditions, the photovoltaic performance was well studied. The photovoltaic data are shown in Table 3 and more detailed data are summarized in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. S16 and S17,† when the TTFQx-T1:PC71BM weight ratio is 1:1.5, the device shows a low PCE of 2.52% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 7.02 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.39 while the device with 0.5 vol% DIO treatment shows a higher PCE of 8.30% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 14.22 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.70. Similarly, the PCE of the TTFQx-T2:PC71BM device has increased from 2.49% to 7.47% with DIO treatment, which is due to the improvement of Jsc and FF 2.1 times and 1.5 times, respectively. The J–V and EQE curves in nonfullerene solar cells are shown in Fig. 5. The TTFQx-T1:ITIC based device without any treatment shows a high PCE of 9.24% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 14.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.66. After simple TA treatment, a higher PCE up to 10.52% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 16.88 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.69 is obtained. Similarly, the PCE of the TTFQx-T2:ITIC based device is improved from 5.76% to 7.22%, and the Jsc of 11.62 mA cm−2 and the FF of 0.51 are increased to 13.75 mA cm−2 and 0.56, respectively, after TA treatment. Inverted devices usually have better stability, combined with the higher photovoltaic performance of TTFQx-T1 based regular devices, and therefore, we fabricated TTFQx-T1:ITIC based inverted devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/poly[9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl] (PFN)/TTFQx-T1:ITIC/MoO3/Ag.38,39 These inverted devices show a moderate PCE of 7.95% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 16.69 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.55 while after solvent vapor annealing (SVA), a higher PCE of 9.21% was reached with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 16.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.63. Compared to conventional devices, the PCE of inverted devices gets slightly decreased, but it should be stressed that they have a larger device area of 16 mm2 than the conventional devices with the area of 4.5 mm2. The J–V curves and EQE curves of inverted PSCs based on TTFQx-T1:ITIC are shown in Fig. S23† and detailed data are listed in Table 4.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 based devices prepared under different conditions are shown in Fig. 5 and S17.† The TTFQx-T1:ITIC based device has a maximum EQE value of 69.5% while the maximum EQE gets increased to 75% after TA treatment. Similarly, the TA treatment also improves the EQE value of the TTFQx-T2:ITIC based device; the maximum EQE increases from 51.4% to 66.4%. The Jsc calculated from the EQE is 16.09 mA cm−2 and 13.57 mA cm−2 for TTFQx-T1:ITIC and TTFQx-T2:ITIC based optimized devices, respectively. The deviation between the integral of the EQE and the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves is less than 5%.40
The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to investigate the hole and electron mobilities through the hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and the electron-only device of ITO/ZnO/active layer/ZrAcac/Al, respectively. The dependences of the square root of current density (J1/2) on voltage are displayed in Fig. 6 and S18,† and the detailed mobility data are summarized in Table S2.† The hole and electron mobilities of the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film are 3.19 × 10−5 and 1.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while 1.13 × 10−4 and 1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after TA treatment. The hole and electron mobilities of the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend film are 7.55 × 10−6 and 5.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and 1.39 × 10−5 and 6.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 after TA treatment. TA treatment can efficiently improve the hole mobility of TTFQx-T1:ITIC 3.5 times; the hole and electron mobilities of TTFQx-T2:ITIC get improved 1.8 and 1.3 times with TA treatment. TTFQx-T1:ITIC exhibits almost one order of magnitude higher mobility, which can explain higher Jsc and FF in TTFQx-T1:ITIC devices. For the TTFQx-T1:PC71BM and TTFQx-T2:PC71BM blend films, the DIO additive improves the hole and electron mobilities (in Fig. S18†). The hole and electron mobilities of TTFQx-T1:PC71BM films reach 6.41 × 10−6 and 4.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 0.5 vol% DIO treatment; the hole and electron mobilities of TTFQx-T2:PC71BM films reach 2.50 × 10−6 and 1.99 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 0.5 vol% DIO treatment. The μh/μe value is the parameter to estimate the exciton recombination and formation of space charge density. The μh/μe value of TTFQx-T1:ITIC is 0.18, and after TA treatment, the μh/μe value gets improved to 0.75. Similarly, the μh/μe value of TTFQx-T2:ITIC is increased from 0.14 to 0.20 with TA treatment. The more balanced μh/μe value is beneficial to obtain higher Jsc and FF which agrees with the device results.41

In order to have deeper insight into the charge recombination in devices, we analyzed the dependence of Jsc on light intensity (Plight) using the relation Jsc ∝ Pαlight to determine the degree of geminate charge recombination.42 If α is equal to 1, the geminate recombination can be ignored.43 As indicated in Fig. 7, TA treatment can increase the α value from 0.946 to 0.983 in the TTFQx-T1:ITIC based device and the FF correspondingly gets improved from 0.66 to 0.69. The α value increases from 0.950 to 0.979 in the TTFQx-T2:ITIC based device with TA treatment and FF gets improved from 0.51 to 0.56. The results demonstrate that TA treatment can reduce the geminate charge recombination to balance charge transport, therefore increasing the FF.

2.4. Morphological characterization
To gain more insights into side chain effects on photovoltaic performance, we use tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to carefully explore the morphology of the active layers. The AFM and TEM images of TTFQx-T1:ITIC and TTFQx-T2:ITIC with or without TA treatment are shown in Fig. 8 and S22,† respectively. The AFM and TEM images of TTFQx-T1:PC71BM and TTFQx-T2:PC71BM with or without DIO treatment are shown in Fig. S20 and S21.† For the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film, the AFM images show a smooth morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.30 nm while a smoother and uniform surface with a RMS roughness of 1.17 nm with TA treatment. In the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend film, similar RMS roughness values of 0.90 nm without TA treatment and 0.89 nm with TA treatment are obtained. For the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend film, TA treatment can optimize aggregation to modulate the morphology in film states while TA treatment doesn't have obvious influence on the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend film.44 The shorter side chains of TTFQx-T1 lead to smaller steric hindrance which can have better molecular arrangement and aggregation in film states, and a clearer and suitable morphology can be produced to promote the exciton separation and charge transport in the polymer donor and ITIC acceptor to obtain higher Jsc and FF. The larger RMS values are 2.69 and 6.17 nm for the TTFQx-T1:PC71BM and TTFQx-T2:PC71BM blend films without DIO, while RMS values are 2.13 and 3.35 nm for TTFQx-T1:PC71BM and TTFQx-T2:PC71BM blend films with DIO additive, respectively, which manifests that the TTFQx-T1/TTFQx-T2:PC71BM blend films have serious aggregation compared to their nonfullerene counterpart which is probably not good for the exciton dissociation and charge transport. The PCEs of TTFQx-T1/TTFQx-T2:ITIC based devices are higher than those of TTFQx-T1/TTFQx-T2:PC71BM based devices. As shown in Fig. S22,† the TEM images indicate that the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend films have clearer nanoscale phase separation and a domain size which can form a D/A interpenetrating network for better charge transport than that of the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend, which can partially explain higher photovoltaic properties in the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend.

3. Conclusion
In summary, through the optimization of side chains, we synthesized two new Qx based polymers, TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2, respectively. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of TTFQx-T1 and TTFQx-T2 were well characterized. TTFQx-T1 with shorter alkyl side chains in the BDT unit can improve the absorption and charge transport to achieve higher Jsc and FF, and TTFQx-T1:ITIC based devices have lower geminate recombination, higher charge mobility and better film morphology than those with the TTFQx-T2:ITIC blend. Therefore, a high PCE of the TTFQx-T1:ITIC based device up to 10.52% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 16.88 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.69 is obtained while the PCE of TTFQx-T2:ITIC based devices reaches 7.22% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 13.75 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.56. In addition, the inverted devices based on the TTFQx-T1:ITIC blend with an active area of 16 mm2 show a high PCE of 9.21%. The results indicate that the different alkyl side chains have great effects on photovoltaic properties. Moreover, in comparison to previous work, changing alkoxy substituted fluorobenzene to alkyl substituted fluorothiophene in the Qx acceptor unit can also improve the photovoltaic performance. Considering that TTFQx-T1 and ITIC have not perfect complementary absorption, much improvement can still be made in the near future. Side chain engineering in Qx based polymers can be well desired for obtaining highly promising photovoltaic materials.
