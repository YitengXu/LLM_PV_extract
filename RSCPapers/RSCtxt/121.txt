    AbstractWe report on the properties of inverted polymer solar cells using an ultrathin Al2O3 buffer layer on indium tin oxide (ITO). The ultrathin Al2O3 layer, deposited by the atomic layer deposition method, was found to reduce the work function of ITO and turns ITO into an electron-collecting electrode. The current density–voltage characteristics of unexposed devices showed an s-shape kink. The kink was eliminated upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) illumination. Inverted solar cells based on P3HT:PC60BM yielded a fill factor of 0.64 and a power conversion efficiency of about 2.8% estimated for 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 illumination.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells are attracting considerable attention due to their potential for low cost, flexible and large-area applications.1–6 Recently power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in the range of 5 to 7% have been reported through the use of novel polymers and the control of the active layer morphology.7–9 Most solar cells generally comprise a low work function top electron-collecting electrode and exhibit poor air stability. Polymer solar cells with an inverted structure typically have better air stability because of the use of a high work function metal as the top hole-collecting electrode. A possible approach in making inverted polymer solar cells is to construct a low work function bottom electron-collecting electrode. Up to now, transparent electron-collecting electrodes were commonly constructed by depositing semiconducting metal oxides such as ZnO10–12 and TiOx,13,14 onto indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. In a few reports, thin insulators (around 1 nm), such as cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3)15 and polyethylene oxide (PEO)16 have been used to modify ITO because they reduced its work function. However, the spin coating or thermal deposition methods used, do not allow for precise control over the thickness of such thin layers and most likely do not provide conformal coverage.
Here, we report on efficient inverted polymer solar cells that use an ultrathin Al2O3 layer to modify the work function of ITO. The thin Al2O3 layer was prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The ALD method can produce dense, highly conformal and pinhole-free thin films.17 The film thickness can also be accurately controlled in the nanometre scale by varying the number of the deposition cycles. The work function of ITO was reduced upon deposition of the Al2O3 layers. Polymer solar cells with a structure of ITO/Al2O3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Ag as shown in Fig. 1 exhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.57 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 7.7 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 64%, and a PCE of 2.8% estimated for 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination.

Experimental
Patterned ITO coated glass substrates (Colorado Concept Coatings LLC, 15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned in sequential ultrasonic baths of detergent water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The Al2O3 thin films were deposited at 110 °C using alternating exposures of Al(CH3)3 and H2O vapor at a deposition rate of approximately 0.1 nm per cycle in a Savannah 100 ALD system (Cambridge Nanotech Inc.). Each deposition cycle lasted 25 s. Three different thicknesses (0.1 nm, 0.5 nm and 1 nm) of Al2O3 were deposited on ITO substrates. The work function of ITO modified by Al2O3 was measured in air by a Kelvin probe (Besocke Delta Phi). A highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) sample with a work function of 4.5 eV was used as the reference. The active layer of P3HT (Rieke Metals):PC60BM (Nano-C) (1:0.7, weight ratio) was spin-coated on each substrate from a 17 mg ml−1 chlorobenzene solution and annealed at 150 °C for 20 min on hot plate in a glove box under nitrogen. The thickness of the active layer was 110 nm. PEDOT:PSS CPP 105D (H. C. Starck), instead of the commonly used PEDOT:PSS P VP AI 4083, was spin-coated on top of the P3HT:PCBM layer because of its better wetting properties. The samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate to dry the PEDOT:PSS in the glove box. The thickness of PEDOT:PSS was 80 nm. Then, the samples were transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporation system (SPECTROS, Kurt J. Lesker) and 150 nm of Ag were deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer through a shadow mask at a base pressure of 4 × 10−8 Torr. The effective area of the active layer was 10 mm2. Solar cells without Al2O3 were also made with the same procedure as reference devices. Devices with conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS 4083 (40 nm)/P3HT:PC60BM/Al were also made for comparison. The P3HT:PC60BM mixture was identical to the one used in the inverted devices. An ultraviolet (UV) lamp (Electro-Lite Bondwand UV Flood System, 365 nm) was used to expose the devices through the ITO glass side. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a source meter (Keithley 2400) controlled by a LabVIEW program. To test the solar cell properties under illumination, filtered light from a 175 W Xenon lamp (ASB-XE-175EX, CVI) was used as a broadband light source with an irradiance of 67 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the dependence of the work function of the modified ITO as a function of the thickness of the Al2O3 buffer layer. Each data point was averaged over three samples. The work function of clean ITO was 4.64 ± 0.04 eV. After modification by the ultrathin Al2O3 layers, its work function was reduced and stabilized at 4.30 ± 0.04 eV for Al2O3 layers thicker than 0.5 nm. This value is close to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PC60BM, which indicates that the combination of ITO/Al2O3 is a good candidate to be used as a transparent electron-collecting electrode in organic solar cells.

Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves under illumination of newly fabricated devices. The photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. For all the ITO/Al2O3 devices, an s-shape kink is observed near VOC in the J–V curves. Devices with the thicker Al2O3 layer show a more pronounced kink and consequently yield smaller FF and PCE. The short-circuit current densities of the devices with different thicknesses of Al2O3 are similar. The reference device exhibits poor photovoltaic performance under white light illumination and poor rectification characteristics in the dark (Fig. 3a). This is the case because the work function of bare ITO, 4.64 eV, lies between the LUMO energy level of PCBM and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of P3HT (5.0 eV) and, therefore, is not expected to work as an efficient electron-collecting electrode. In contrast, when an ultrathin Al2O3 is inserted between ITO and the active layer, the work function of the electron-collecting electrode is shifted closer to the LUMO of PCBM improving the electron selectivity of the electrode. Fig. 3a shows that the dark J–V curves of the devices with modified ITO electrodes show increasingly better rectification properties and smaller reverse saturation currents with increasing Al2O3 thickness.

J–V characteristics in the dark of (a) newly fabricated devices and (b) devices treated by 10 mW cm−2 UV illumination for 3 h except the device with 1 nm Al2O3 for 6 h. 
The kinks in the J–V curves were found to be eliminated by illuminating the devices through the glass/ITO side with a UV lamp. The devices with 0.1 and 0.5 nm thick layers of Al2O3 were treated for 3 h with an UV irradiance of 10 mW cm−2 and the device with a 1 nm thick layer of Al2O3 was treated for 6 h. Fig. 2b shows that UV treatment removed the kinks in the current–voltage characteristics, considerably improving device performance. In particular, values of the fill factor increased significantly from values as low as 0.24 to values as high as 0.64, leading to increased PCE values. A summary of the photovoltaic parameters of the different devices before and after UV treatment is given in Table 1. Note that we report PCE values measured with the CVI Xenon lamp, as well as calculated values based on the convolution of the measured external quantum efficiency spectra for these devices and standard AM 1.5 illumination. In the dark, the J–V curves of newly fabricated devices (Fig. 3a) show lower current density with thicker Al2O3 layers. However, after sufficient UV exposure the dark current of all the devices converges to a similar value under forward bias (0.6–1.0 V) as shown in Fig. 3b.

Fig. 4a shows the dynamics of the effects of the UV exposure on the J–V curves of a device with a 0.5 nm thick layer of Al2O3 under illumination. The kinks become less pronounced and finally disappear as the UV exposure time increases. The values of the FF, VOC and PCE are enhanced considerably within the first 20 min of exposure and slowly reached steady state. The JSC is quite consistent regardless of the UV exposure time (Fig. 4b).

This phenomenon where UV exposure is found to enhance the efficiency of solar cells has been observed previously in inverted and tandem solar cells comprised of ZnO18–20 and TiOx.21,22 The reason for the observed improvements was attributed to an enhancement of the electrical conductivity of ZnO and TiOx upon UV treatment. Furthermore, for some metal oxide semiconductors, such as ZnO23,24 and SnO2−x,25 the UV-enhanced conductivities were reported to return to their initial values after the samples were exposed to air. This reversible phenomenon was ascribed to the UV-induced desorption of negatively charged oxygen molecules trapped within the grain boundaries of the metal oxide, leading to an increased conductivity; followed by their readsorption upon air exposure, leading to a decreased conductivity. Fig. 5 shows that a similar phenomenon was observed in our devices, where the kink in the J–V curves was removed by UV exposure, restored upon air exposure, and removed again after subsequent UV exposure. These changes in the bulk conductivity of ultrathin films of Al2O3 would be difficult to measure with our current characterization capabilities. However, a similar mechanism to the one described could also apply to our samples if the band gap of such ultrathin Al2O3 layers would be significantly smaller than the one found in the bulk. Recent measurements on ALD-grown Al2O3 layers in the range of 10–20 nm yielded a band gap of around 6.4 eV.26 The band gap of these layers would still be too large to be optically excited through the glass/ITO interface. However, in ultrathin amorphous Al2O3 films with a thickness of 0.35 nm band gap values as low as 2.6–2.9 eV have been reported.27 If the morphology of films is amorphous, as in those films, they could well be excited by the UV light. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the observation of UV photoconduction in α-Al2O3 crystals with excitation at 3.7 eV.28 Unfortunately, due to very small film thickness of our Al2O3 layers, a characterization of their morphology using X-ray diffraction experiments is challenging.

Reversible changes of conductivity in metal oxide semiconductors have also been reported in memory devices.29,30 In devices with ZnO nanoparticle24 it was shown that photogenerated holes were causing the desorption of oxygen that was acting as electron traps. Holes produced by biasing the device electrically were found to have the same effect on the increase of conductivity as holes produced by UV exposure. To further clarify the effects of UV exposure on the ultrathin Al2O3 layers in our solar cells, continuous electrical bias experiments were conducted in devices that were previously exposed to oxygen. Keeping the devices under constant forward bias of 2.5 V for 5 min resulted in the removal of the kink in the J–V characteristics, a result similar to the one obtained by UV exposure. Hence, while further studies will be required to clarify the origin of this phenomenon, it seems very likely that the ultrathin Al2O3 layers in our solar cells become more conductive due to oxygen desorption, eliminating the kinks in the J–V characteristics and enhancing the photovoltaic performance.

Fig. 6 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of inverted devices with different thicknesses of Al2O3. It can be seen that the EQE measured in all devices is nearly similar. The EQE can be used to evaluate the current density that would be obtained under AM 1.5 illumination using the following equation: (1)where Nph(λ) is the spectral photon flux density under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 solar illumination. The corresponding PCE under AM 1.5 illumination (PCEAM1.5) is then estimated by: PCEAM1.5 = (JSC−AM1.5 × VOC × FF)P−1in(2)where we used the values of VOC and FF listed in Table 1. This way, JSC−AM1.5 yielded values of 7.5, 7.7 and 7.9 mA cm−2 for the devices with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 nm thick Al2O3 buffer layers, respectively. The PCEAM1.5 of the inverted devices with 0.1, 0.5 and 1 nm thick Al2O3 was estimated to be 2.64, 2.80 and 2.62%, respectively after UV treatment (see Table 1).

Inverted organic solar cells were found to show better air stability than devices with a conventional structure.12,31 The stability of our inverted cells with ITO/Al2O3 (0.5 nm) transparent electron-collecting electrode and a device with the conventional structure [ITO/PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI 4083)/P3HT:PC60BM/Al] was compared by storing the devices in the dark in ambient air and periodically testing their photovoltaic performance. We mentioned that the kinks in the J–V curves of devices with Al2O3 were reversible to UV exposure and air exposure. The photovoltaic data of devices with Al2O3 for stability comparison were measured in devices stored in ambient air. Before each J–V characterization experiment, the samples with Al2O3 were inserted in a glove box under nitrogen and first treated with UV for 3 h (10 mW cm−2) to remove the kink. Fig. 7 shows measurements taken at discrete temporal intervals that illustrate the change in JSC as a function of exposure time to air. After 278 h of storage in air, the inverted cells retained 87% of their initial value of JSC while the conventional cells degraded to 9.1% of their original value. In inverted solar cells, the value of the PCE dropped to 70% of its initial value while in conventional cells it degraded to 9% of its original value. Since our solar simulator operates in inert atmosphere, we could not test if the combined effects of UV radiation from the solar spectrum and the effects of holes created in the device during photovoltaic operation are sufficient to prevent the adsorption of oxygen and allow for continuous efficient operation in air without the need of encapsulation.

In summary, we demonstrated inverted organic solar cells where an ultrathin Al2O3 was used as the buffer layer. ITO was coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 layer which reduced its work function and turned it into an electron-collecting electrode. The solar cells with Al2O3 showed a kink in the J–V curves measured under illumination. The kinks could be removed by UV exposure or electrical bias and reappeared upon air exposure. This fully reversible phenomenon is tentatively ascribed to the desorption and adsorption of oxygen. The desorption of oxygen in the Al2O3 layer is induced by holes that are either photogenerated by UV illumination or electrically injected. After removal of the kinks, the solar cells exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 2.8% estimated for 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5 illumination. The inverted solar cells showed better stability in ambient air compared to conventional solar cells with a low work function top electron-collecting electrode.
