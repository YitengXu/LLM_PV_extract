    , Accepted 20th December 2021First published on 21st December 2021AbstractAu nanochains with a coupled plasmonic nanostructure were first introduced into PEDOT:PSS used as a hole transport layer to fabricate mixed tin–lead PSCs. The improved electrical properties and the promotion of optical absorption contributed to a high PCE of 19.2%. Moreover, the PSCs show substantial enhancement in stability.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most promising emerging photovoltaic technology.1–3 With recent advances, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of pure lead halide PSCs have increased dramatically to a current record of 25.5%. However, the heavy metal lead (Pb) is not eco-friendly. Tin (Sn) is considered as a suitable alternative to Pb.4 So far, many efforts have been focused on full or partial Pb-replacement by Sn.5–14 Notably, the Sn–Pb mixed perovskite has a narrow bandgap and generally 50%–60% Sn substitution can contribute to the lowest bandgap of 1.2–1.25 eV.7,8 In this case, the maximum theoretical efficiency of a single-junction device could be increased to over 30% compared to that of a Pb-based medium-bandgap perovskite.15 Besides, the narrow-bandgaps of perovskites open opportunities for tandem PSCs, the most promising approach to push the PCEs beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit.9–11 Although remarkable progress of Sn–Pb mixed PSCs has been achieved in the last few years,6–12 the performance of such devices is not particularly satisfactory. Thus, further exploration is yet needed for high-performance Sn–Pb mixed PSCs to compete with Pb-based ones. In an attempt to improve the PCE, most of the reported strategies were related to the optimization of the Sn–Pb mixed perovskite layer, especially the use of additives to inhibit the Sn2+ oxidation, passivate the defects at grain surfaces and improve the uniformity of perovskite films,10–12 while few studies are relevant to hole transport layers (HTLs) or electron transport layers (ETLs),13,14 which are also a potential route to enhance the device performance of Sn–Pb mixed PSCs.
Nowadays, the inverted p-i-n planar structure prevails and shows promising performance for Sn–Pb mixed PSCs. Typically, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a HTL and a C60 or fullerene derivative as the ETL. In the inverted device structure, the HTL plays a dramatic role in charge extraction, transport and influencing interfacial interactions.6 Although PEDOT:PSS is widely used as a HTL in Sn–Pb mixed PSCs, there is still much room for improvement in the device performance through further modification of the HTL. Noble metal nano-materials have received a great deal of attention due to their ability to support localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR),16–18 and their excellent optical and electrical properties make them suitable candidates in photovoltaic applications.18–22 At present, several nanostructures have been successfully applied in enhancing the photovoltaic performance by coordinating with functional layers, such as Au nanoparticles (AuNPs),20 Au nanospheres,21 Au nanorods,22etc. However, there is no relevant report on the utilization of Au nanochains (AuNCs) in solar cells. The AuNCs with coupled plasmonic nanostructure can give rise to highly intensive electromagnetic-fields.23 The chain shape connected by NPs can serve the purpose of enhancing the scattering effect. Besides, the elongated nanochains can form an excellent network structure with PEDOT:PSS to intensify interactions.
So in this study, we successfully synthesized and introduced AuNCs into PEDOT:PSS as the HTL to fabricate FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 PSCs. The composite network structure improved the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS effectively, which contributed to the hole extraction, transport and collection in the device. The AuNC-doped PEDOT:PSS also mildly improved the interfacial interaction and hence reduced the trap-state density at interfaces between the HTL and perovskite. In addition, the plasmonic light scattering and some near-field effect of AuNCs facilitate more light to be trapped and enhance light absorption. As a result, the Sn–Pb mixed PSCs with the PEDOT:PSS-AuNCs structure showed significantly improved PCE of 19.2%. Importantly, these devices also exhibited good reproducibility and efficient improvement in stability.

Fig. 1a and b and Fig. S1a (ESI†) depict the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of AuNCs and show the spatial arrangement of AuNPs in the Au-chains. The AuNPs exhibit relatively uniform shapes with an average diameter of about 10 nm, and they connect with each other regularly forming a structured chain shape. Some branches can be observed in the image, but all the AuNPs are closely packed. The morphology of AuNCs determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). Additionally, the plasmon resonance peaks are located at 515 nm and 650 nm obtained from the absorption spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†), which originates from the transverse and longitudinal resonance mode of the Au-chains, respectively. It has previously been reported that light scattering is the dominant process in large plasmonic nanostructures (>50 nm);22 therefore, the Au-chains with elongated nanostructure will be able to scatter light efficiently.

Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the transmission spectra of PEDOT:PSS films blended with Au-chains on ITO glass substrates. All of these films are found to be highly transparent with > 90% average transmittance in the wavelength range. It should be noted that there is an obvious wavelength-dependent increase in the transmittance even exceeding 100% for the samples containing AuNCs. By comparison with the basically identical transmittance spectra of these films on quartz substrates (Fig. S3b, ESI†), and the peak position and spectral shape of transmittance of the ITO glass (Fig. S3a, ESI†), we can speculate that the addition of AuNCs into PEDOT:PSS has some shielding effect on the light absorption of ITO glass as a substrate when compared to pure PEDOT:PSS, which leads to the spectral increase when subtracting the background signal of the substrate. This may be caused by the strong light scattering effect of AuNCs.
The S (2p) spectra of PEDOT:PSS films obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The binding energies (BEs) of sulfur atoms of PEDOT and PSS are, respectively, below and above ∼166 eV. Intriguingly, the mass ratio (r) between PSS and PEDOT was observed to be reduced slightly as the content of AuNCs increased, according to the fitting result of the BE peak. This phenomenon may be caused by the change in Coulombic interaction between PEDOT and PSS upon the addition of AuNC aqueous solution,24,25 leading to the decrease of PSS during film formation. Generally, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films is enhanced benefiting from the increased connections between conductive PEDOT chains as PSS decreases.26
Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the surface AFM images of PEDOT:PSS films containing various amounts of AuNCs. There is little change in the morphology among all the samples. The slightly decreased root-mean-squared (RMS) surface roughness from 2.01 nm (0 wt%) to 1.83 nm (1 wt%) shows that the introduction of a small amount of AuNC solution is in favour of film flatness. The flat surface can guarantee that there is a good interface contact with the perovskite, avoiding the charge recombination derived from the interfacial trap states.6 Then, the RMS surface roughness of the film rose again to 2.06 nm as the AuNC content reached 2 wt%, which indicated that the high concentration of AuNC solution could cause the transformation of uniformity of the PEDOT:PSS films.
We then investigated the photovoltaic performance of PSCs based on FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 absorber. Fig. 2a plots the current density–voltage (J–V) curves. Notably, 1 wt% AuNCs is an optimal quantity for the HTLs, giving a substantial increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Consequently, the device achieved the highest PCE of 19.2%, while the control device fabricated with pure PEDOT:PSS only exhibited a PCE of 17.5% (Table 1). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2b) of both PSCs demonstrated integrated Jsc values (30.3 mA cm−2 and 29.1 mA cm−2) that are in good agreement with those obtained from J–V curves. As a whole, the relatively broad and uniform EQE enhancement implied that the composite HTLs largely improved the electrical performance of the solar cells. Otherwise, a more wavelength-dependent change would be achieved.22 The maximal steady-state output power exhibited a value of ∼18.8% close to its related PCE obtained from the J–V curve in the reverse scan (Fig. 2c). The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the optimal AuNC device is shown in Fig. 2d, and the large grains of the perovskite result in perpendicular and negligible grain boundaries.7 The histogram in Fig. S7a (ESI†) demonstrated the good reproducibility of the device performance. Fig. S7b (ESI†) shows that the PSC device with AuNCs has better stability compared to that based on pure PEDOT:PSS. The network structure formed by incorporating AuNCs probably weakened the chemical action of PEDOT:PSS on the perovskite to some extent.27

Then, the correlations between the HTLs and the resultant PSC performance were investigated systematically. The negligible change in the perovskite morphologies obtained from SEM (Fig. S8, ESI†) indicates that the PEDOT:PSS-AuNCs have little effect on the consequent perovskite film growth. We investigated the hole mobilities of whole devices by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 3a). It is clear that the device with 1 wt% AuNCs has a higher mobility than that without AuNCs, indicating that the presence of AuNCs is more efficient in promoting hole extraction/transport. The higher mobility can be attributed to the improved conductivity of the HTL, thanks partly to the decrease of PSS in PEDOT:PSS and the metallic character of the AuNCs. The current–voltage characteristics of films in Fig. S9 (ESI†) verified that the introduction of AuNCs improved the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 3b shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The AuNC-introduced HTL showed more efficient PL quenching than the pristine PEDOT:PSS film, which means that the carrier extraction across the interface is more efficient.6 We further characterized the devices by means of transient photocurrent decay (Fig. 3c). The photocurrent decay time is significantly reduced when the AuNC-introduced PEDOT:PSS serves as the HTL, confirming the faster charge extraction and more efficient charge transport. The highly intensive plasmon-induced local electromagnetic field from AuNCs can facilitate the charge dynamic process.23 Notably, the TPC measurement result is consistent with that of the steady-state PL and hole mobility, which jointly account for the higher Jsc and FF values of the AuNC-included devices.

(d) J–V curves of hole-only devices for measurements of trap-state density. 
The dependence of Jsc and Voc on various light intensities (Plight) were measured. As shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†), the AuNC device showed a slightly increased α value (0.985) closer to unity compared to that (0.943) of the device without AuNCs. This result indicated that more free carriers in the AuNC device were swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to bimolecular recombination owing to the improved electrical properties of the HTLs and efficient coupling interfaces, which consequently contributed to the increase of FF. As shown in Fig. S10b (ESI†), the slightly smaller slope (n = 1.603) of the AuNC device suggests reduced interfacial trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination owing to the mildly improved interfacial interaction. The onset voltage of the trap-filled limit (VTFL) region of the PSC device was reduced from 0.28 V to 0.20 V after incorporating AuNCs (Fig. 3d), confirming that the new HTL can impose a moderately positive effect on reducing the interfacial hole trap-state density, which is consistent with the result of dependence of Voc on Plight. The effect of AuNCs on the band structure of HTLs was also determined. The result of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the work function (WF) of HTLs is slightly elevated from −4.97 eV to −4.86 eV as the content of AuNCs is increased (for more details see Fig. S11, ESI†).
Fig. S12 (ESI†) depicts the UV-vis absorption spectra of HTL/perovskite films. A small increase of absorption in the region nearly from 500 to 700 nm is observed after depositing the PEDOT:PSS film with 1 wt% AuNCs. In addition, the reflection spectrum (R) of the entire AuNC device was also measured. As shown in Fig. 4a, the device based on AuNC-included PEDOT:PSS shows a relatively lower reflectance than the pristine one. The absorption spectra derived from A = 1 − R are plotted in Fig. 4b, demonstrating that the AuNC device exhibits slightly enhanced light trapping in the range roughly from 450 nm to nearly 800 nm. This optical enhancement should mainly originate from the plasmonic light scattering of AuNCs and some near-field coupling of LSPR into the adjacent active layer,18,22 which partly contributes to the higher Jsc of the corresponding PSCs. Fig. 4b also displays that the IQE spectrum of the AuNC device is clearly higher than that of the device based on the pristine PEDOT:PSS. This result indicates that the improvement of electrical properties of HTLs and more benign interfaces are one of the most important reasons for the increase in device efficiency. Besides, we compared the hysteresis behavior of PSCs in Fig. S13 and Table S1 (ESI†). The device with 1 wt% AuNCs showed reduced hysteresis ascribed to the improved HTL and interface.

In summary, the AuNCs with a strongly coupled plasmonic nanostructure are successfully introduced into PEDOT:PSS and used as HTLs for the partial Sn-based PSCs. The increased connections of conductive PEDOT chains after introducing AuNCs and the intensive plasmon-induced local electromagnetic field from AuNCs contribute to the electrical properties improvement of HTLs, and that together with the efficient coupling interfaces facilitates the hole extraction, transport and collection in the device. The functionalized PEDOT:PSS also reduced the interfacial trap-state density between the HTL and perovskite owing to the mildly improved interfacial interaction. In addition, the plasmonic light scattering and some near-field coupling effect of AuNCs can facilitate the optical absorption. As a result, the optimized device based on PEDOT:PSS-AuNCs showed a promising PCE of 19.2%. Moreover, these devices also exhibited excellent reproducibility and substantial enhancement in stability.
