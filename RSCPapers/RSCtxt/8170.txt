    , Accepted 11th January 2021First published on 13th January 2021AbstractLead halide perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) nanocrystals (NCs) are widely used in the newest generation of lighting display equipment because of their excellent optical properties. However, their poor stability remains an urgent issue to overcome. Encapsulation has become a significant and effective strategy to promote the stability of perovskite NCs, particularly by the package coating of polymer and porous materials. Herein, a simple two-step encapsulation strategy is adopted to fabricate CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA composite films to replace the previous preparation methods of perovskite films. A highly efficient and stable red-emitting material with great colour purity and excellent PLQY of ∼53.9% is manufactured by this simple and effective packaging method. Furthermore, because of the first-encapsulation with zeolite, the CsPbBrI2@zeoite/PMMA composite films not only reduced the agglomeration of NCs but also obtained better optical performance and environmental stability compared to that of pure CsPbBrI2/PMMA. Ultimately, WLEDs constructed by the red-emitting CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA composite material achieve an outstanding colour rendering index, luminous efficiency and correlated color temperature (CRI = 94.5, LE = 77.22 lm W−1 and CCT = 5354 K), and realize tunable colour coordinates of (0.3359–0.32912, 0.3455–0.3336) in the white light area, implying that CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA is very promising for obtaining a high CRI of WLEDs instead of traditional phosphor. The facile two-step encapsulation method proposed in this study provides a prospect for obtaining high-quality perovskites.
Introduction
As an emerging commercial field in the lighting industry, white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) have been attracting significant attention for their high luminous efficiency (LE), long lifetime, and low energy consumption.1–3 At present, all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) nanocrystals (NCs) have been developed and studied by the scientific community due to their simple synthesis method and excellent optical properties, such as high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), tunable wavelengths and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM).4–10 These excellent photoelectric properties of CsPbX3 NCs enable them to have a wide range of applications, such as in solar cells,11,12 lasers,13–15 bioimaging,16–18 and particularly white LEDs.19–21 However, CsPbX3 NCs would have a structural collapse, resulting in fluorescence quenching without encapsulating in any other cladding materials,21,22 making it difficult to improve their photoelectron conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a top priority to achieve environmental stability for perovskite NCs. To overcome these issues, numerous encapsulation methods have been proposed to protect the perovskite NC structure from damage by air, water, heat and light while maintaining the outstanding optical properties.
Nowadays, encapsulation has become the most effective way to promote the stability of CsPbX3 NCs, which mainly involves the use of a sealed solid inorganic matrix or stable organic polymer. In general, emerging encapsulation materials include transparent ceramic glasses,23,24 mesoporous silica,25,26 polymer films,27–29 inorganic salts,30 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)31 and core/shell materials.32 Moreover, the synthesis of hyper-stable perovskite NCs is carried out at a high temperature, causing a serious consumption of energy.23,24,33 As a porous crystalline aluminosilicate salt, zeolite is also widely used as an effective material with an open frame-structured [AlO4]5− and [SiO4]4− tetrahedron bridged with oxygen atoms to form a regular three-dimensional structure to encapsulate perovskite NCs.32,34 Zhang et al.35,36 synthesised CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I)@zeolite-Y by a two-step process. However, the composite material performed poorly in moisture and heat resistance because only a small number of NCs was coated in zeolite-Y. Wang et al.37 synthesized an ultrastable perovskite-zeolite composite by in situ passivation in air. Nonetheless, the perovskite-zeolite composite prepared by this method is not optimistic for application prospects with a weak PLQY of 18.3%.
As an organic polymer with great processability, low density, high flexibility and transparency, PMMA has great potential to package CsPbX3 NCs.38 The dense polymer chain could passivate the surface of the perovskite as well as avoiding direct contact between perovskite NCs and environment, particularly in water.29,39 Previously, red-emitting NCs have been demonstrated to significantly improve the colour rendering index (CRI) of LEDs,40,41 which were conducive for obtaining high-quality WLEDs. The quenching of perovskites at high temperature/current would lead to a change in colour rendering and a reduction in the LE of WLEDs. Therefore, it is extremely vital to enhance the thermal stability of red-emitting NCs in LED applications.
In this study, we proposed a simple two-step encapsulation to embed CsPbBrI2 NCs in zeolite and PMMA in sequence. After two effective encapsulation protection, robust CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA films were prepared, which exhibited great optical performance, including narrow FWHM (∼34.6 nm), high PLQY (∼53.9% for PMMA-15), excellent thermal stability and water resistance, and it could still maintain 78% of its original emission intensity after being soaked in water for 20 days and 94.7% after being exposed to air for two months. Also, under the stimulation of an InGaN blue-chip, a WLED based on red-emitting PMMA-15 and yellow-emitting Ce3+:YAG phosphor was assembled, realizing an outstanding high CRI of 94.5, LE of 77.22 lm W−1 and CCT of 5354 K under 10 mA forward current. The study proved that a simple synthesis of the red-emitting film provides a reference for the production of perovskite composite materials with high stability and high repeatability.
Results and discussion
The red-emitting CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder was obtained via a one-step strategy, which was similar to that reported by Yu et al.19 and Duan et al.42 (Fig. 1, follow the experimental section for details). First, the red-emitting powder was prepared by injecting the Cs-OA solution into a PbX2 (X = Br, I) solution (130–170 °C) in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 1, i). Zeolite was used as a coating material for perovskite in the solution to control the nucleation of CsPbBrI2 NCs. After cooling in an ice bath, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for another half hour so that the zeolite framework and CsPbBrI2 perovskite anions could be effectively connected.37 The high-efficiency CsPbBrI2@zeolite was acquired by washing the crude product twice (Fig. 1, ii). It is noteworthy to mention that the zeolite-encapsulated perovskite composite material fabricated by this simple one-step method is achievable and the cladding result is excellent. To obtain evenly dispersed perovskite films, we proposed a strategy in which a certain amount of powder was dispersed in 10 mL of a PMMA-toluene solution by stirring for 10 min and then placing it in a circular Petri dish (Fig. 1, iii). When the quantity of the added CsPbBrI2@zeolite-powder is x g, the synthetic composite film is named as PMMA-x (the quantity of CsPbBrI2@zeolite to PMMA in PMMA-3, PMMA-6, PMMA-9, PMMA-12, and PMMA-15 films is 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.15, respectively). Based on the transparency and compactness of the PMMA film, PMMA-x films were successfully prepared through curing by air drying (Fig. 1, iv). The simple and ingenious two-step encapsulation strategy proposed in this study for obtaining high emission. A long-term stable perovskite film will expand the application of perovskite NCs in lighting and flexible materials.

To analyse the structure of CsPbBrI2@zeolite composites, XRD patterns of CsPbBrI2@zeolite prepared at different reaction temperatures of the PbX2 (X = Br, I) solution were studied. It can be seen in Fig. 2a that the XRD patterns of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite successfully confirmed the formation of the CsPbBrI2 perovskite (the pink line; CsPbBr3, PDF#54-0752, black-blue bars; CsPbI3, PDF#80-4039, gray bars). All the diffraction peaks of the commercial zeolite are consistent with those of the standard zeolite (the black curve). The diffraction peaks of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite at 14.8, 21.3, 29, 36, and 42, corresponding to the diffraction peaks of (100), (110), (200), (211), and (220) planes, imply the formation of CsPbBrI2 NCs. Besides, the diffraction peaks of CsPbBrI2 NCs shift towards a smaller angle as the reaction temperature increases, which is perhaps related to the size effect.43 As shown in Fig. 2b, the photographs of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite with different reaction temperatures under room light (the above) and UV light are depicted, showing strong red emission. Fig. 2c, g display SEM images of the original zeolite and CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 composite powder. By comparison, the morphology of CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 is consistent with that typically observed of original zeolite, consisting of a slice layer of 0.6–1.0 μm in diameter and smooth surfaces. In addition, there was no presence of any crystalline particles on the surface of the sample, indicating that CsPbBrI2 NCs may be existing inside the zeolite, which is consistent with previous reports.35,36

In order to further explore the coating of CsPbBrI2 NCs with zeolite, TEM and EDX elemental mappings were recorded. The presence of CsPbBrI2 NCs can clearly be observed in the TEM image of CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 (Fig. 2d, dark part of the red circle). Moreover, Fig. 2h–j shows the CsPbBrI2@zeolite prepared at different reaction temperatures on the edge of the zeolite matrix. The TEM image of pure CsPbBrI2-150 NCs shows that NCs are singly-dispersed and distributed with an average size of ∼8 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). The corresponding particle size distribution histograms of the CsPbBrI2 NCs at 130 °C, 150 °C and 170 °C show their average sizes as ∼7.5 nm, ∼9 nm and ∼13.5 nm, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). Due to the restriction of porous zeolite, the CsPbBrI2 NCs coated with zeolite are in a globular shape. Furthermore, Fig. 2e shows that the lattice spacing of CsPbBrI2 NCs is 3.03 Å, which matches well with the (200) plane of the cubic CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3. HAADF-STEM and EDX element-mapping images of CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 are shown in Fig. 2f, with Si, Al, Cs, Pb, Br, I, O elements distributed throughout the image, confirming that the CsPbBrI2 NCs are successfully encapsulated into the zeolite matrix.
Excellent optical properties of CsPbBrI2@zeolite are revealed by optical characterization. For comparison, we prepared CsPbBrI2@zeolite with a temperature gradient of 10 °C in the range of 130–170 °C and the emission spectra with a slight red-shift are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Therefore, we selected reaction temperatures of 130 °C, 150 °C and 170 °C for the samples to study the specific optical properties. It can be seen in Fig. 3a that the samples show intense red emission around ∼647 nm. The illustrations of different samples under daylight and UV light are shown in Fig. 3a. Similarly, along with the increase in the reaction temperature, the PL peaks and the absorption peak slightly redshifted (Fig. 3a and b), which could be a temperature-induced quantum scale change,43–45 and is consistent with XRD results. Moreover, both PLQY and FWHM increase and then decrease. It is obvious that CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 powder possesses the highest PLQY of 54.2% with the best optical properties (Fig. 3c and Table S1, ESI†).

(c) The changing curve of the PLQY and FWHM values of CsPbBrI2@zeolite with different reaction temperatures (all the measurements of PLQY are under the same excitation wavelength of 460 nm). 
Since the as-prepared CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 had excellent optical properties, we used it as the first choice material to obtain CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA films. The photographs of the as-prepared film samples are shown in Fig. 4a and b. With the increase in the amount of CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder, the transparency of the composite perovskite film decreases, and they display outstanding red emission under UV light (Fig. 4b). In order to research the PL properties of PMMA composite films, we obtained the emission spectra of PMMA films mixed with different qualities of CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder. In Fig. 4c, the obvious red emission of each film sample at around 640 nm is detected. When a large number of NCs are injected into the thin film, the film that has limited chains could not effectively prevent the agglomeration of NCs.27,46 Therefore, the encapsulation by zeolite in the first step provides effective dispersion preparation for subsequent film encapsulation. Moreover, the emission intensity and PLQY increase with an increase in the amount of CsPbBrI2@zeolite (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†) due to the effective encapsulation caused by the uniform dispersion of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite perovskite in the composite.47 It means that a larger number of NCs can be encapsulated in PMMA films during the toluene solvent volatilisation process when more CsPbBrI2@zeolite was added to the high viscosity PMMA/toluene solution. Compared with the optical properties of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder (PLQY ≈ 54.2%, Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†), the CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA films exhibited almost no fluorescence attenuation (PLQY ≈ 53.9%). Moreover, the average FWHM of the obtained CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA composite films is about 34 nm (Table S1, ESI†), which is smaller than that of both CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder and commercial red phosphor powder CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (∼78 nm)48 (Fig. 4c, Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†), indicating outstanding colour purity.42 Thus, PMMA film is a kind of effective coating material for encapsulating CsPbBrI2@zeolite. In order to investigate the surface morphology of both pure CsPbBrI2/PMMA film and CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA composite film, SEM images were recorded. The SEM images (Fig. 4d and e) prove that the CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA film after packaging it twice has a relatively compact and smooth surface. By contrast, the surface of CsPbBrI2/PMMA is full of holes, surrounded by not confirmed dust or uncoated NCs. The difference in the surface morphology is due to the first effective encapsulation of the porous zeolite. The CsPbBrI2 NCs dispersed in the toluene solution were uniformly mixed with the PMMA gel, so the three situations could occur under solvent volatilization: (i) some CsPbBrI2 NCs were retained by the PMMA film; (ii) some CsPbBrI2 NCs evaporated into the air with the toluene solvent; (iii) other CsPbBrI2 NCs with large particles occupying positions on the film surface were adsorbed because there was not enough time for them to volatilize, which may result in a relatively uneven surface. In contrast, CsPbBrI2@zeolite powders were deposited in the bottom layer of the PMMA gel for their certain weight, and adsorption rarely occurred. Thereby, red-emitting CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA film with higher quality prepared by a facile two-step encapsulation provides a great basis for obtaining better-stimulated emission and environmental stability.

We also tested the effects of numerous organic solvents, including toluene, chloroform, acetone, DMF (dimethylformamide), on the emission performance of CsPbBrI2@zeolite. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the images of CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 in different solvents over different durations under daylight and UV light. It is quite clear that the CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 powder still has excellent red emission under 365 nm UV light after 5 h immersion in toluene and chloroform solvents compared to that in other solvents. The CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 powder is immediately quenched when it is added to acetone or DMF solvents, displaying yellowish under UV and daylight. Under sunlight, the CsPbBrI2@zeolite-150 powder in the toluene solvent emits a clear and bright red light to the naked eye. However, the powder in the chloroform solution becomes turbid with noticeable precipitation, which may be the result of the surface ligand loss and damage.49,50 This phenomenon also confirms the instability of the perovskite in polar solvents (polarity ordering: toluene < chloroform < acetone < DMF). Therefore, the toluene solvent was used as the best solvent to dissolve PMMA to obtain the CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA films with more outstanding optical properties and stability. In addition, full-spectrum CsPbX3@zeolite/PMMA films are prepared, proving the feasibility of compositing perovskite PMMA films by this two-step encapsulation method (Fig. S5, ESI†).
In order to compare the chemical stability among CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder, CsPbBrI2/PMMA and PMMA-15 films, their hydrothermal stability was researched. It can be seen from Fig. 5a that the emission intensity of CsPbBrI2/PMMA and PMMA-15 films remained 78% and 59% after soaking in an aqueous solution for 20 days. As a reference, the CsPbBrI2 NCs display non-fluorescence after 2 min in water (Fig. 5a, black line and illustrations), which exhibited extreme instability of CsPbBrI2 NCs in water. However, the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder gradually sinks after absorbing water slowly as the structure of the powder collapsed after 5 h (Fig. 5a and b), resulting in complete luminescence quenching. Further, the PMMA-15 film does have excellent hydrophobicity with a water average contact angle of 90.6° (Fig. S6, ESI†). The temperature-dependent PL spectra of CsPbBrI2@zeolite, CsPbBrI2/PMMA film and PMMA-15 film are shown in Fig. 5e–g. Because the crystal lattice expanded and the boundary of non-phase edge states tended to be steady at the Brillouin zone boundary,44 we also found that the emission wavelength of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder and CsPbBrI2/PMMA has a blue shift when the temperature was increased, and the PL peaks of the PMMA-15 film change in the opposite way probably because the CsPbBrI2 size increases with the increase in temperature.44 To explain this phenomenon, we studied TEM images along with the particle size distribution of PMMA-15 before and after heating at 120 °C. It is a challenging task to obtain the structure of CsPbBrI2 NCs in double-layer encapsulation materials. Therefore, to explore the particle size distribution, CsPbBrI2 NCs, PMMA-15 was ultrasonically treated the in toluene solution for 5 min to disperse the CsPbBrI2@zeolite in toluene. The same procedure was performed with PMMA-15 after heating it at 120 °C. As shown in Fig. S10a and b (ESI†), the generated CsPbBrI2 NCs (black spots) could be clearly seen, and there was an evident variation of the particle sizes between PMMA-15 and PMMA-15 after heating it at 120 °C. Furthermore, the particle size distribution histograms show the average size of PMMA-15 as ∼8.3 nm and the PMMA-15 after heating at 120 °C as ∼9.4 nm, similarly confirming the change (Fig. S10c and d, ESI†). Hence, we attributed the red-shift of the PMMA-15 emission peak with a temperature rise to the growth of CsPbBrI2 NCs, which was benefited from the multiple protection of zeolite and the PMMA film. The emission intensities of CsPbBrI2/PMMA and the PMMA-15 film drop sharply when the temperature reaches the softening temperature of PMMA (∼120 °C, Fig. S8, ESI†), which leads to the CsPbBrI2@zeolite without a protective layer. It can be seen in Fig. S9 (ESI†) that PMMA-15 shows optimal thermal stability. Effective heat dissipation is of great significance for the realization of high-quality LED.51,52 Adding a certain amount of alumina powders to the PMMA film has been a proven to improve the thermal conductivity of the PMMA film.53 Therefore, we tested the thermal conductivities of the pure PMMA film, CsPbBrI2/PMMA film and PMMA-15 of 0.1 mm thickness at 120 °C, and their values are 0.192 W (m K)−1, 0.197 W (m K)−1 and 0.247 W (m K)−1, respectively, predicting better heat dissipation of PMMA-15 due to the addition of the zeolite. Therefore, it is feasible and effective to structure WLED devices at high temperatures by assembling PMMA-15 with improved thermal conductivity. As predicted, PMMA-15 has stronger thermal stability than that of CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder and CsPbBrI2/PMMA due to the second encapsulation of polymer. In addition, the stability comparison of powders and films in air was also researched. After storing in the air for two months, the high red emission can also be observed in both PMMA-15 and CsPbBrI2@zeolite (Fig. S11, ESI†). As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the emission wavelength and FWHM values of PMMA-15 and powder samples are recorded before and after storage in air. Importantly, the original optical properties of the PMMA-15 perovskite composite film are almost completely retained compared to those of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder. Therefore, the outstanding environmental stability of the red-emitting PMMA-15 film indicates that two-step encapsulation can effectively restrain the decomposition of the perovskite by water, oxygen, temperature, etc.

Based on the excellent optical properties (∼34.6 nm of narrow FWHM for PMMA-15) and excellent stability of the PMMA-15 film, we studied the suitability of this composite material in actual white LED applications. In general, the most popular method for manufacturing WLEDs is combining a yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) phosphor with a LED chip. However, due to the lack of red light emission, this method is difficult to achieve a high CRI.40 In this study, the WLEDs were constructed from a commercial yellow-emitting Ce3+:YAG phosphor and red-emitting PMMA-15 powder based on a blue-emitting InGaN chip at 460 nm (as illustrated in Fig. 6f). The blue-chip, yellow-green Ce3+:YAG and red-PMMA-15 PL spectra are shown in the figure. The PL spectrum of the assembled WLED device driven by 20 mA forward current exhibited a relatively narrow emission peak appearing at 648 nm (Fig. 6d), which belongs to the PMMA-15 composite material. In order to explore the output stability of perovskite NCs in WLED, the CIE coordinates and PL spectra of the WLEDs were fabricated by the coupling Ce3+:YAG phosphor and PMMA-15 under different driving currents, as shown in Fig. 6e, g. It can be seen from Fig. 6e, g and Table S3 (ESI†) that when the current increases the white coordinates shift towards the blue-green light, and the red emission gradually weakens, realizing the tunable colour coordinates of (0.3359–0.2912, 0.3455–0.3336) in the white light area. The corresponding spectral power distribution curves of different currents are given in Fig. S12 (ESI†). When the work currents increase from 10 mA to 120 mA, the optical power intensities continuously increase without luminescence saturation and the ratio of the two emission bands (Ce3+:YAG and PMMA-15) gradually changes. At a low forward current, the red part of the spectrum resulting from PMMA-15 is dominant. On the contrary, the yellow-green emitting band from Ce3+:YAG plays a leading role in the lifting of the forward current. Table S3 (ESI†) records the specific performance parameters of WLED assembled at different currents. Also, we have calculated CCT theoretically with the CIE obtained by testing, and there is hardly a deviation between the testing data and theoretical one as we expect. It is quite clear that the synthetic CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA has an ideal stability, which is expected to be used in high current WLEDs. In order to compare the performance parameters of other WLEDs based on different red-NCs, we offer a direct comparison of the device structure, PLQYs, LE, CRI, CCT, CIE, and the corresponding work current of different red-NCs for WLEDs (Table 1). These data strongly prove that CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA is very promising for obtaining the high CRI of WLEDs.

Conclusion
In conclusion, highly efficient red-emitting CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA composite materials were obtained by a continuous two-step encapsulation method. The key to effective encapsulation for the two-step strategy was that we coated the perovskite in the zeolite using a one-pot method, avoiding the agglomeration of perovskite NCs during subsequent encapsulation. Furthermore, after the first-covering by the zeolite, the CsPbBrI2@zeoite composite materials provided a great basis for obtaining better-stimulated emission performance and stability of perovskite films. The simple and effective packing method greatly preserved the optical properties of PMMA-15, which have high colour purity, great PLQY of 53.9% by increasing the proportion of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder and improved the hydrothermal and air stability of CsPbBrI2 NCs. The moisture resistance of CsPbBrI2/PMMA and PMMA-15 allowed the composites to maintain 78% and 94.7% of the initial PL emission after storage in water for 20 days or in the air for two months, respectively. In addition, a high-performance WLED (CRI = 94.5, LE = 77.22 lm W−1, CCT = 5354 K) with the standard coordinate of (0.3359, 0.3455) under 10 mA of operating current was combined by the InGaN blue chip with the red-emitting CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA film and the yellow-emitting Ce3+:YAG phosphor. Therefore, we believe the as-prepared CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA films that have the advantages of the facile preparation process, excellent long-term stability, will become a potential application in WLEDs devices and lasers.
Experimental
Materials and chemicals
The following reagents were used in this study: cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, Aladdin, 99.99%), lead bromide (PbBr2, Aladdin, 99.99%), lead iodide (PbI2, Aladdin, 99.99%), 1-octadecene (ODE, Aladdin), oleic acid (OA, Aladdin,), oleylamine (OAm, Aladdin), toluene (J.T. Baker, low water), ethyl acetate (Aladdin, 90%), zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 5.1, Alfa Aesar), trichloromethane (Aladdin, 99%), acetone (Aladdin, 99.5%), N, N-dimethylformamide (Aladdin, 90%) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, Aladdin). All the raw materials were not further processed.
Preparation of Cs-oleate precursor
0.4 g of Cs2CO3, 5 ml of OA, and 15 ml ODE were mixed in a 50 mL three-neck flask. The mixture was heated and stirred at 120 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the temperature was increase to 130–150 °C in an atmosphere of nitrogen until Cs2CO3 reacted with OA. The mixture was used as a cesium source to synthesize CsPbBrI2 NCs.
Preparation of CsPbBrI2@zeolite
10 ml of ODE, 0.0367 g of PbBr2, 0.0922 g of PbI2, 0.3 g zeolite-Y, 0.8 ml of OA, 0.8 ml of OAm were mixed in a 50 mL three-neck flask. The mixture was heated and stirred at 120 °C for 1 h. Then, the temperature was increased to 150–170 °C for 10 min under N2 until PbBr2 and PbI2 had completely dissolved. Furthermore, pre-heated 0.6 ml of the CS-Oleate precursor was injected into the mixture. After 5 sec, the three-necked flask was immediately transferred to an ice-water bath and cooled to room temperature. After the ice bath treatment, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for another half hour in order to obtain more effective packaging products. The crude solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the crude product. Finally, the crude product was washed with toluene and ethyl acetate twice to wash away the excess OA and OAm. The composites were dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 1 h.
Preparation of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA film
10 ml toluene was added to 3g PMMA and dissolved by heating at 60 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 0.03–0.15 g of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder was added to the colloidal solvent and stirring for 10 min. The as-prepared colloidal solvent was placed in a circular Petri dish and naturally solidified at room temperature. The perovskite concentration of prepared films was decided by adding different qualities of the CsPbBrI2@zeolite powder.
Material characterization
The structural analysis of CsPbBrI2@zeolite and CsPbBrI2@zeolite/PMMA was performed via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Germany, Cu Kα under 40 kV and 40 mA). The microstructure and accessory energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) measurements were performed via TEM (JEM-2100F, Japan). SEM images were recorded using a Nova 200 NanoSEM. A Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluromax-4P spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh, FS5) was used to record the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 750). The contact angle was measured using a Drop Shape Analyzer-DSA25. The thermogravimetry (TGA) curves were recorded using a Diamond TG-DTA/Spectrum GX. The laser thermal conductivity meter (LFA457) was used for surveying the thermal conductivity.
