1. Introduction
Since the 20th century, grid electrical power has been mainly generated by burning fossil fuels worldwide.1 Consequently, increasing concerns about global warming, environmental deterioration and energy crisis have spawned the development of sustainable alternative energy sources, including wind and solar energy. Controlling wind power efficiently is not easy, and solar energy is only available during daylight hours and often varies with weather changes. To facilitate access to clean energy, it is urgent to explore advanced technologies that can store and convert energy from these intermittent sources for continuous applications.2,3 Among all currently available devices, batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) show impressive potential for electrochemical energy storage. Various electrode materials or catalysts have been applied to improve the storage performance, among which graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based materials have aroused heated discussions especially in recent years due to their unique structures, properties and outstanding performance.4,5
Carbon nitride (C3N4) has been regarded as one of the earliest reported artificial polymers in scientific fields. Seven possible phases of C3N4 have been reported including α-C3N4, β-C3N4, cubic-C3N4, pseudocubic-C3N4, g-h-triazine, g-o-triazine, and g-h-heptazine.6,7 Among all the above-mentioned structures of the C3N4 allotrope, g-C3N4 attracts the most interdisciplinary attention as a robust metal-free material. Due to earth-abundant carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) elements as well as facile synthesis, low cost and environmentally friendly characteristics of g-C3N4,8 research into this material has become a fascinating hotspot in the fields of photocatalysis,9–12 water purification,13,14etc. For example, Ong et al. reported a significant review on g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis and environmental remediation.15 Additionally, there have been several research studies concentrating on the fabrication and application of g-C3N4 electro- or photocatalysts.8,16,17 Nevertheless, research into g-C3N4 was once stagnant for an extended time because of its chemical inertness, insolubility in all solvents and relatively low electrical conductivity. Therefore, much work is required for a fully intensive study of g-C3N4-based materials in more potential fields.
Batteries and SCs are both widely used devices to store and convert energy. These devices share similar superiorities of long life span and environmentally benign advantages and have been applied to electric vehicles, portable devices and solar cells to efficiently store and convert energy.18–20 However, these two types of devices still face some challenges and limitations that hinder their future improvements. The energy density of SCs is relatively low while batteries have unsatisfactory power density and rate performance.21–23 Therefore, it is urgent to further investigate suitable electrode materials and effective catalysts for batteries or SCs, and g-C3N4-based materials are an important and new candidate. Since pristine g-C3N4 shows inevitable poor conductivity and serious irreversible capacity loss, much work has been done to overcome these issues. For instance, Chen and co-workers successfully synthesized an N deficient g-C3N4 anode with a promising reversible lithium storage capacity of 2753 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles.24 As demonstrated in Fig. 1a, controlling structures and the introduction of conductive materials also largely optimize the electrochemical storage performance of g-C3N4-based materials in batteries and SCs.25,26

(c) Line chart of the research trend of g-C3N4-based materials for various batteries and SCs in recent years. 
Especially in recent years, various g-C3N4-based materials have been manufactured utilizing innovative synthesis methods and manifested great potential for electrochemical energy storage;1,27 however, only a handful of reviews have focused on this field. Thus, it seems timely to offer a review providing insight into this theme. In this review, we survey the research progress of g-C3N4 and its composites applied in different batteries (Li-ion battery (LIB), Li–O2 battery, Li–S battery, zinc–air battery (ZAB), vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), Na-ion battery (SIB), etc.) and SCs (Fig. 1b and c). Material synthesis schemes, charge/discharge mechanisms of different devices and the electrochemical performance of these materials are included. The structural advantages and drawbacks of g-C3N4-based materials are also elaborated in detail. At the same time, we briefly introduce the challenges and future prospects of applying these types of materials.
2. History, structure and properties of g-C3N4
The earliest history of C3N4 can be dated back to the year 1834, when a linear polymer of interconnected tri-s-triazine was synthesized by Berzelius and was later referred to as “melon” by Liebig.28 In 1989, A. Y. Liu and M. L. Cohen predicted a new covalent compound β-C3N4 according to the crystal structure of β-Si3N4 (ref. 29) and subsequently prepared β-C3N4 in 1993 was surprisingly found to be even harder than diamond. In 1996, Teter et al. reported 5 possible phases of C3N4 (α-C3N4, β-C3N4, g-C3N4, cubic-C3N4 and pseudocubic-C3N4) through first-principles calculations. Compared with other phases, g-C3N4 was proven to be more energetically favorable.6,7 Although the utilization of g-C3N4 for batteries and SCs was brief, beginning just in the 21st century, this topic has become unprecedentedly hot in recent years.
As an n-type semiconductor, g-C3N4 possesses a unique structure similar to graphite (Fig. 2c). g-C3N4 features a stacked, two-dimensional (2D) structure with each planar sheet consisting of sp2 hybridized conjugated C and N atoms (Fig. 2b), establishing π-conjugated electronic structures. Impressively, the stacking distance between the aromatic layers of g-C3N4 (0.319 nm) is lower than that of graphite (0.335 nm). Thus, the enhanced packing density of g-C3N4 results in stronger binding between the layers and more satisfactory charge transport perpendicular to the planes than graphite.30 Moreover, in each layer, it is widely recognized that condensed tri-s-triazine (C6N7 in Fig. 2e) is the basic subunit for the typical formation of g-C3N4 since this kind of possible structure is more stable and energetically favorable than another proposed s-triazine unit (C3N3 in Fig. 2d).31–33 The N content in g-C3N4 is calculated to be up to 57.1 at% and three N species are identified in its structure, including graphitic-N, pyridinic-N and bridge-N.

g-C3N4 also manifests special physical and chemical properties, exhibiting yellow-colored polymers in powder form, as shown in Fig. 2a.15,24,31,33 Aromatic C–N heterocycles enable g-C3N4 to be thermally stable even up to 600 °C in air. In addition, g-C3N4 cannot be dissolved in alkali, acidic or organic solvents, making it a robust material with promising chemical stability.34,35 However, the large contact resistance, band gap, and low surface area of bulk g-C3N4 lead to its poor conductivity and catalytic activity, thus affecting the storage performance.36
3. Battery
Versatile batteries are typical in an electrochemical energy storage system. Batteries can be commonly divided into three categories: rechargeable batteries, flow batteries and ultra-batteries. Rechargeable batteries are also known as secondary batteries, since they can be charged/discharged into a load and recharged many times. They accumulate and store energy through different reversible electrochemical reactions. Low environmental impact and long lifetime enable their large-scale applications, with the issues of relatively high cost, large weight and size still existing.38,39 Flow batteries work by passing a solution over a membrane on which ions are exchanged and the voltage of them is chemically determined by using the Nernst equation. Flow batteries have the advantages of a flexible layout and quick response times while the energy densities of them are lower compared to rechargeable batteries. In addition, ultra-batteries newly combine the fast charging rates of ultra-capacitor technology with the energy storage potential of lead-acid battery technology in a hybrid device. Therefore, applying ultra-batteries is another effective option to store and convert intermittent energy.
3.1 Lithium-ion battery (LIB)
LIBs were first commercialized to the public sector in 1991 and subsequently have been utilized in electric vehicles and portable devices worldwide. Owing to their long cycle life, light weight and high energy density, LIBs have gradually become one of the most important energy storage devices. LIBs consist of three parts (a cathode, an anode, and a solid-state electrolyte) and operate via the movement of lithium ions (Li+) between the cathode and anode. Much effort has been made to optimize the electrode materials, especially anodes. Negative electrode materials of LIBs can be mainly divided into two categories, one is commercial C-based materials such as graphite or hard carbon, and the other is still in the developmental stage, namely, non-carbon materials like silicon-based materials and alloy materials.

3.1.1 Lithium storage principles and pristine g-C3N4 optimization. 
Pure g-C3N4 has been proven as a potential LIB electrode; however, some shortcomings still exist in practical applications.39 Thus, based on the properties of g-C3N4 and Li storage principles, considerable effort has been made to optimize g-C3N4-based materials.33 This work will greatly help maximize the advantages of g-C3N4-based materials for high-performance LIBs.
Carbon-based materials, especially graphite, have been dominant anode materials in commercial rechargeable LIBs over the last few decades. Since g-C3N4 and graphite share an analogous layered structure, comparisons between them are beneficial for obtaining deep insight into more complex g-C3N4-based electrodes. Graphite electrodes in LIBs show advantages of low cost, a flat voltage range, good cyclability and a modest volume change upon Li insertion.27,40 Graphite anodes can accommodate one Li atom for every six C atoms (LiC6) in LIBs, and show a specific theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1.41
In addition, N doping has been analyzed as an efficient way to further improve the reversible capacity, cycling performance or coulombic efficiency of various carbon-based anodes. For instance, Ren and co-workers investigated a series of N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNx-NTs) to conclude the effects of the N content on the performance of LIB anodes. In Fig. 3j, higher discharge capacities and improved rate capabilities were observed with increasing N concentration. These researchers ascribed the impressive electrochemical performance to the increasing electrical conductivity and more defect sites caused by the incorporation of N atoms.42 Afterwards, a material with an N-doping content of approximately 3.15% (dominated by pyrrolic- and pyrindic-N) proved the findings. Liu et al. successfully prepared N-doped graphene nanosheets (NGNSs) through a clean and scalable mechanochemical approach. As shown in Fig. 3e, these authors obtained the material via all solid-state ball-milling graphite with urea. When tested as an anode for LIBs, the NGNSs showed an initial discharge capacity of 895 mA h g−1, remarkably higher than that of graphite (372 mA h g−1). The rate capabilities of the NGNS electrodes also stood out when compared to pristine graphite or GNS anodes (Fig. 3k).43 N doping can provide extra active sites for Li storage and an enhanced affinity to other integrants.

As an N-substituted graphite material with a quite high N-doping level, g-C3N4 should be an ideal anode material for LIBs in theory. Additionally, compared with graphite, the more open structure of g-C3N4 may lead to improved rates of Li+ exchange. In fact, a pristine g-C3N4 electrode showed a relatively low initial discharge capacity at 134.9 mA h g−1 and an irreversible capacity loss up to 90% after only 7 cycles.24 Both the poor conductivity and low reversible capacity limit the direct application of pristine g-C3N4 in LIBs. Veith33 and Hankel41 pointed out that the large amount of graphitic-N as well as the irreversible reactions of graphite-like C3N species with Li in g-C3N4 anodes are responsible for the serious irreversible capacity loss. In addition, compared with the superior conductivity of graphite, g-C3N4 shows poor conductivity due to the considerable replacement of C atoms by N atoms in the benzene ring. In contrast, pyridinic-N in g-C3N4 favors high Li uptake and reduces irreversible reactions, thus improving Li storage performance. The N content and N type largely determine the performance of C-based electrodes in LIBs.
A suitable LIB anode material should meet several requirements as follows. The Li adsorption energy should be above 1.6 eV (bulk Li) to avoid clustering and below 3 eV to enable desorption. For practical applications, the specific capacity of the LIB anode material should be superior to that of graphite anode materials, and the volume change during Li insertion should be small. In addition, the material should maintain its structural integrity.44 Hence, pristine g-C3N4 has been optimized to satisfy certain Li storage principles.
The porous structure is of great significance for improving the performance of negative electrodes in LIBs. Based on a first-principles study, Pan et al. investigated g-C3N4 nanotubes with porous structures. As shown in Fig. 3f–h, when the g-C3N4 nanotubes intercalate with Li, every Li atom is positioned in the center of the nanotube pore at an energy minimum, and the Li density in the nanotube bundles is calculated to be 0.57 (Li4C3N4). Due to the porous structures of the g-C3N4 nanotubes, the diffusion pathways for Li+ are shortened during lithiation/delithiation processes; thus, this material shows a relatively high specific capacity of up to 1165.3 mA h g−1.45 In addition, Chen and co-workers synthesized an N deficient g-C3N4 (ND-g-C3N4) anode derived from g-C3N4via a magnesiothermic denitriding method (Fig. 3b). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of g-C3N4 and ND-g-C3N4 in Fig. 3c and d exhibit the formation of porous and thin sheet-like structures. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of ND-g-C3N4 material shows a specific surface area as high as 579.8 m2 g−1, which is about 10 times that of g-C3N4, suggesting more Li storage sites. Therefore, when tested in LIBs, the ND-g-C3N4 anode reveals a promising reversible capacity of 2753 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles (Fig. 3i) along with enhanced rate capability and cycling stability. Though sharing a similar porosity, the ND-g-C3N4 electrode's superior Li storage performance compared with that of the g-C3N4 nanotubes can be attributed to an additional increase in the intrinsic conductivity and a reduction in the N ratio (especially graphitic-N) from 23.03% to 17.8% after the magnesiothermic denitriding route. Meanwhile, Li residing in the increscent pores can relatively minimize the volume change during charge/discharge processes and help improve the cycle stability.24
Except for changing the morphologies and N content of g-C3N4 electrodes, lithiation was also reported to be an effective approach for optimizing pristine g-C3N4. Veith et al. successfully fabricated lithiated C3N4 through electrochemical and solid-state reactions. In Fig. 3a, after the lithiation process, the initially yellow colored C3N4 powder turned orange. This phenomenon indicated that reactions occurred, which were subsequently explained as follows: Li and the quaternary C3N species in C3N4 reacted irreversibly, while the other C–N bonds were less reactive. These findings revealed that the concentrations of conductive sp2-type C backbones should be maximized and the concentrations of the C3N species must be minimized simultaneously for suitable N-doped C-based anodes in LIBs.33 Moreover, functionalized g-C3N4 was prepared by Wu and co-workers. After functionalizing g-C3N4 with Li atoms, the resultant single-layer Li2C3N4 material contains a relatively high density of Li+, thus becoming a promising candidate for LIB anodes. This material has a high specific capacity of 524 mA h g−1, which is nearly twice that of graphite.46 To briefly summarize the above research, the materials after lithiation have added advantages for Li storage in that they are more stable in terms of avoiding Li clustering and do little harm to the environment.


3.1.2 Binary g-C3N4-based composite. 
Though 2D layered g-C3N4 materials exhibit great potential to act as anodes for LIBs, there still exist several challenges for Li+ storage owing to their relatively low electrical conductivity, the aggregation and pulverization of electrodes and the formation of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during lithiation/delithiation processes. To some extent, other materials (metal oxides,47 metal sulfides,48 C-based materials,49etc.) can help overcome these drawbacks. Hence, the advantages of both g-C3N4 and other materials are expected to be integrated in hybrid systems. The superior Li storage performance of the resultant composites compared with that of any ingredient can be ascribed to both synergistic and complementary effects during synthesis.
Tuning the properties of bulk metal oxides with g-C3N4 polymers to improve the materials is quite common. Lim et al. previously reported that Zn2GeO4 nanowires have a high capacity of 342 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles in LIBs due to alloy formation reactions of Zn and Ge with Li as well as the following conversion reactions: ZnO + 2Li+ + 2e− → Zn + Li2O and GeO2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Ge + 2Li2O.47 As a comparison, another Zn2GeO4/g-C3N4 composite prepared by Li and co-workers delivers an even more remarkable performance (a reversible capacity of 1370 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 140 cycles and a rate capability of 950 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 4j). This effect is because the added ultrathin g-C3N4 layers and their synergy with Zn2GeO4 expose vacancies with doubly bonded N for extra Li+ diffusion pathways, which effectively alleviate the strain of particle expansion. The facile solution method for hybridizing Zn2GeO4 and g-C3N4 is illustrated in Fig. 4f, and the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Fig. 4d clearly shows that numerous Zn2GeO4 nanoparticles (NPs) are homogeneously encapsulated among the extensive g-C3N4 layers.50 Notably, the same synthesis strategy can be utilized to guide the rational design of similar hybrid systems, such as anatase TiO2/N-rich carbon nanosheet (TiO2@CNS), N-doped Li4Ti5O12/C (NCLTO) and SnO2 nanosheets/g-C3N4 (SN/CN) composites. TiO2@CNS with core–shell nanostructures was fabricated by Senthil et al. via a robust self-assembly method involving CNS and titanium alkoxide under hydrothermal conditions with subsequent heat treatment(Fig. 4e). In LIBs, the TiO2@CNS anode delivered an impressive capacity of 303 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 125 cycles and a rate capability of 136 mA h g−1 at 5C in the 500th cycle.51 Another cauliflower-like SN/CN composite (Fig. 4c) was also synthesized via a hydrothermal approach, showing enhanced cycling stability.52 In addition, Zhou et al. prepared NCLTO through an easy and large-scale solid-state reaction. The reversible capacity (122 mA h g−1 at 10C after 500 cycles with 102% capacity retention) of this as-obtained material in LIBs53 is excellent when compared to a typical LTO anode.54

Various C-based materials such as porous carbon,55 carbon nanosheets,56 carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)49 have been investigated as LIB anodes because of their low cost, nontoxicity and good energy density. If g-C3N4 is composited with other highly conductive C-based materials, it may be ideal for high-performance LIBs. For example, by utilizing filter paper as a precursor, Tao et al. successfully manufactured interwoven and flexible N, P dual-doped CNFs/g-C3N4 (huCP/g-C3N4) materials as self-supporting anodes for LIBs. As demonstrated in Fig. 4b, the CNFs with a typical hollow structure and large pores were closely coated with a thin g-C3N4 network, which offered rich defects and active sites for Li insertion. For LIBs, the huCP/g-C3N4 electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 1030 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 along with a promising rate capability of 133 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1.57 Moreover, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrodes show an initial discharge capacity of 1200 mA h g−1 with only a 33% coulombic efficiency. To draw on the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of rGO at the same time, Fu et al.1 and Subramaniyam et al.58 both proposed hybridizing rGO with 2D layered g-C3N4. Two types of g-C3N4–rGO hybrids shared a similar Li storage mechanism (C3N4 + zLi+ + ze− = LizC3N4, 1 < z < 2) and improved the electrical conductivity along with the electrochemical reactivity; however, several differences still exist in many aspects. Fu et al. utilized an in situ chemical method for the fabrication of covalently coupled hybrids, while 3D g-C3N4–rGO was obtained by Subramaniyam et al. through a different hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 4i and g, Fu et al. emphasized the unprecedentedly high reversible capacity (1525 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles) of a g-C3N4–rGO-1 electrode (14.2 at% N-doping) and the other investigated the cycling performance of g-C3N4–rGO composites with various g-C3N4/rGO ratios at 50 mA g−1, respectively. The comparison showed different perspectives when studying the structures and properties of g-C3N4–rGO anodes in LIBs.
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) demonstrates a high capacity of approximately 670 mA h g−1,48 and several MoS2/C-based materials have emerged as promising candidates for stable LIB anodes.59,60 These materials have stimulated more thought regarding the application of MoS2/g-C3N4 composites for Li storage. Senthil and co-workers synthesized 3D N-rich g-C3N4/MoS2 scaffolds via a novel two-step method using sonication and hydrothermal processes. When tested as an anode in LIBs, the resultant material manifested a high reversible capacity of 857 mA h g−1 at a 0.1C rate after 50 cycles.61 In addition, Tang et al. fabricated another 2D composite with MoS2 nanocrystals coupled on N-enriched graphene (MoS2/NGg-C3N4) for high-performance Li storage. As shown in Fig. 4a, the synthesis was realized by growing MoS3 nanoparticles on the assembled GO and g-C3N4-H+ nanosheets to obtain a precursor with subsequent mild temperature pyrolysis at 550 °C. An exceptional reversible capacity of 1450 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles and an outstanding rate capability of 1200 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 were observed when applying MoS2/NGg-C3N4 to LIB anodes (Fig. 4h). Apart from the high concentration of N dopants and more active sites offered by MoS2, the architecture of the mesoporous nanosheets with large surface areas is crucial to the electrode–electrolyte contact and accelerates Li+ diffusion.62 Hence, MoS2/NGg-C3N4 showed superior performance to N-rich g-C3N4/MoS2.


3.1.3 Ternary g-C3N4-based composite. 
More complex ternary composites were also studied, which add abundant, interconnected and porous g-C3N4 to accommodate the lattice strain and restacking during the Li insertion process. Hou et al. synthesized a novel 3D N-doped graphene/g-C3N4 nanosheet supported layered-MoS2 composite (C3N4/NRGO/MoS2) based on a formerly reported method with slight modifications.34 The as-obtained material had a peculiar structure, featuring large interfacial contacts between crumpled C3N4/NRGO nanosheets and 2D layered MoS2. Thus, when the cycling performance was evaluated (Fig. 5f), the C3N4/NRGO/MoS2 electrode delivered a high discharge capacity of 938 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 77% during the 1st cycle and retained 91% of its initial capacity up to 100 cycles. This material also showed superior rate capability (maintaining an 83% capacity ranging from 50 to 500 mA g−1) when compared to MoS2 or NRGO/MoS2 electrodes.18 In addition, iron oxide/C-based hybrids have been demonstrated as a class of promising anode materials for LIBs, such as previously fabricated yolk–shell-structured FeOx@C63 and α-Fe2O3-graphitic carbon (α-Fe2O3@GC) microspheres64 by Zhang and co-workers. To further inhibit the natural aggregation tendency of the abovementioned materials, Shi et al. proposed the fabrication of active Fe2O3 nanoparticles encapsulated in sandwich-like g-C3N4/graphene hybrid nanosheets (Fe2O3/CN-G) (Fig. 5c). The resultant anode material exhibited a remarkable specific capacity of up to 980 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a 50 mA g−1 current density. In Fig. 5e, Fe2O3/CN-G also revealed a promising rate performance of approximately 730 mA h g−1 even at a current density of 1000 mA g−1, which was much higher than that of Fe2O3/G (495 mA h g−1). The striking electrochemical performance of the Fe2O3/CN-G electrode in LIBs is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5b, which can be ascribed to g-C3N4 (brown slice) with abundant pores and highly conductive graphene (black slice) along with active Fe2O3 (blue spheres).65 Moreover, graphite coated cobalt and cobalt sulfide nanoparticles coupled to sulfur (S) and an N dual-doped mesoporous carbon (Co@Co9S8/S–N–C) hybrid were obtained by Zhu et al. based on a combination of hydrothermal reactions with a pyrolysis approach (Fig. 5a). When tested in LIBs, great retention capacities of 652.1 mA h g−1 after 610 cycles at 0.2 A g−1 and 432.1 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1 were observed.66 Furthermore, a ternary nanocomposite of rGO, SnS2 and g-C3N4 (GSC) (Fig. 5d) was manufactured through a one-pot hydrothermal technique,67 while another g-C3N4 nanosheet-coated SnO2–TiO2 nanocomposite (SnO2–TiO2–C3N4) was synthesized via a simple self-assembly deposition process.68 These two materials both delivered high specific capacities and promising rate capabilities along with ultra-long cycling stability (Fig. 5g) during Li storage.

Overall, g-C3N4-based materials (pristine g-C3N4 and related composites) revealed great potential for high-performance LIBs. As listed in Table 1, various g-C3N4-related anode materials have been applied in LIBs. The benefits of g-C3N4 for Li storage can be attributed to the following aspects: (1) as a pore-forming agent, g-C3N4 has a unique porous structure, which offers efficient channels for both the Li+ and the electrolyte;18 (2) bulk g-C3N4 can be easily tuned to 2D multilayered nanosheets with a strong template effect,58 thus obtaining a larger surface area for the dispersed decoration of Li+ compared with 0D or 1D nanomaterials; (3) g-C3N4 plays the role of a crystal size controlling agent, thus influencing the morphologies of the resultant electrodes. Compositing g-C3N4 with other materials also provides inspiration for future studies. Doping-type carbon matrixes (e.g., N, P, and S-doped C-based materials) are effective for enhancing the relatively poor conductivity of g-C3N4.27,57,66 In addition, the usage efficiency of the active materials along with g-C3N4 in the composites should be significantly enhanced simultaneously. Compared with the morphologies, properties or synthesis methods of other anode materials, there still exists much room for the development of g-C3N4-based electrodes. The morphologies of g-C3N4-based materials are mostly nanosheets, while other materials own more special morphologies which largely enhance the performance. Besides, g-C3N4-based composites should be further explored in terms of their components, since different ratios of each component may cause great impacts. Thus, we summarize that an ideal g-C3N4-based electrode for LIBs should (1) undergo minimum strain; (2) well maintain its structural integrity; (3) have a high Li+ diffusion coefficient and (4) properly tune the properties of both g-C3N4 and the other ingredients.50

3.2 Lithium–sulfur battery (Li–S battery)
In addition to lightweight LIBs, Li–S batteries have also become a promising candidate to meet the increasing need for advanced batteries.69 In a fundamental Li–S battery system, elemental S is utilized as the cathode coupled with a metal–Li anode. Therefore, the overall reaction upon cycling can be denoted as S8 + 16Li+ + 16e− → 8Li2S (cathode) and 16Li → 16Li+ + 16e− (anode).70,71 Compared with LIBs, Li–S batteries deliver a higher theoretical capacity of 1672 mA h g−1 and an unparalleled energy density of 2567 W h kg−1.3,72 Impressively, S element is abundant on earth, and the devices are inexpensive and environmentally friendly.73–75 Despite these advantages, there still exist some challenges that hinder the commercialization of Li–S batteries, namely, (1) low electrical conductivity of a pure S cathode, (2) poor utilization of the cathode due to the insulating properties of the final discharge product (Li2S), (3) high solubility of polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) resulting in a severe shuttling effect,74,76 and (4) low areal loading of S hindering real applications. To remove these stumbling blocks, tremendous efforts have been devoted to this work.77
Designing novel cathode materials69,70 or electrolytes78,79 and passivation of anode materials80,81 have all been reported as effective methods. In addition, among these methods, optimizing a pure S cathode is quite common. For instance, Ji et al. synthesized a CMK-3 (a kind of mesoporous carbon)/S electrode,69 and Li et al. fabricated another smaller S@ordered meso-microporous core–shell carbon (S/MMCS) composite.82 The resultant two materials both demonstrated improved performance (Fig. 6g) in Li–S batteries. Afterwards, in a review by Yang and co-workers, various nanostructured S-based cathodes (nanoporous C/S, graphene/S, and conductive polymer/S composites, porous oxide additives, nanostructured Li2S, etc.) and the mechanisms behind their operation were discussed systematically.70 As a unique C-based material, g-C3N4 could also be a promising S anchoring material for the Li–S battery cathode. A graphene-like g-C3N4 nanosheets/S (GCN/S) composite with 70.4 wt% S loading was obtained by Meng et al. via a facile chemical deposition approach. Acting as a cathode in the Li–S battery, GCN/S delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 1250 mA h g−1 at 0.05C and a discharge capacity of 578.0 mA h g−1 at 0.5C even after 750 cycles. The impressive performance can be ascribed to the high specific surface area and sheet-like structure of GCN; thus, active materials such as S, Li2S2 and Li2S can be homogeneously distributed. This effect largely increases the utilization of S.76

Porous g-C3N4 not only enhances the cathode properties but also acts as a C-based matrix or an absorptive host material to mitigate the dissolution of LiPSs. The redox process of LiPSs is quite fundamental since it determines the electrochemical performance of a Li–S battery to a great extent. First, the use of physical barriers for trapping the LiPSs has been proven to be effective.83,84 Fan et al. blended g-C3N4 with a certain amount of carbon black (g-C-coated separator) to obtain a LiPS-trapped separator at the molecular level. As shown in Fig. 6b, the functional mechanism and cell configuration of the g-C-coated separator are compared to those of a C-coated separator. Due to the unstable physical adsorption of carbon black, LiPSs still shuttle through the C-coated separator after cycling. In contrast, the g-C-coated separator effectively intercepts the LiPSs under the same cycling conditions. The satisfactory result can be attributed to the formation of N–Li and C–S chemical bonds in the cathode region and the coating layer with a great mechanical strength offered by g-C3N4. Hence, a pure S cathode retains a superior reversible capacity of 840 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 400 cycles.85 Second, the conductive matrix can be utilized to adsorb and anchor the LiPSs.73,75 Song et al. reported that a carbon-nanotube-interpenetrated mesoporous N-doped carbon sphere (MNCS/CNT) framework with a spherical morphology (Fig. 6c) could act as an excellent S host.86 Large amounts of similar porous C-based hosts provide guidance for applying g-C3N4-based hosts in Li–S batteries. A g-C3N4 coated carbon fiber mesh (C3N4@CFM) composite was fabricated by Liao and co-workers through an in situ coating method. The SEM image in Fig. 6d evidently shows that g-C3N4 was uniformly distributed on the surface of CMF. As demonstrated in Fig. 6e and f, the discharge/charge capacities of a pristine CFM cell and the as-obtained C3N4@CFM cell were compared. The CFM cell manifested a poor discharge capacity of 635 mA h g−1. In contrast, the g-C3N4@CFM cell delivered an initial discharge of approximately 905 mA h g−1 as well as superior capacity retention. The better performance of g-C3N4@CFM could be attributed to its slightly larger surface area. This larger surface area facilitated the adsorption of LiPSs along with under coordinated N atoms in g-C3N4, which formed bonds with the Li atoms to stabilize the LiPSs.3 Polymeric g-C3N4/rGO (CNG),72 3D porous C3N4 nanosheets@rGO(PCN@rGO)74 and C3N4/rGO aerogels87 were fabricated by Liang et al., Gong et al. and Song et al., respectively. All these materials are g-C3N4/rGO composites that share several similarities; however, their synthesis methods and cycling performance are different. Acting as hybrid S hosts, CNG was obtained via a facile cyro-drying and annealing method (Fig. 6a), while PCN@rGO and C3N4/rGO were both synthesized via a hydrothermal method with a subsequent freeze-drying process. When assembling the three types of materials as well as pristine rGO into Li–S batteries for contrastive analysis, pristine rGO not only delivered a significantly lower capacity but also faded more quickly (0.542% rate decay per cycle). In contrast, CNG maintained a stable capacity of up to 700 mA h g−1 after 280 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 100% and PCN@rGO delivered a specific capacity of 680 mA h g−1 at 0.5C even after 800 cycles. Moreover, a promising initial capacity of 1146 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and an excellent rate capability of 752 mA h g−1 at 1C could be obtained utilizing the C3N4/rGO host. Though pristine rGO can play the role of boosting the electrical conductivity, its combination with g-C3N4 provides more benefits. The integration between g-C3N4 and LiPS species largely enhances the kinetics and stabilization of their redox process, thus suppressing the abovementioned shuttling effect.72 Abundant N functional groups can provide more active sites, endowing g-C3N4 with an inherent adsorption and accommodation capacity for LiPSs in electrolytes.74 It is also believed that g-C3N4 can stabilize the structure of the rGO host and further improve ion diffusion and charge transfer in Li–S batteries.87
In summary, various types of g-C3N4-based materials can play different roles in Li–S batteries. The related research results are briefly demonstrated in Table 2, including necessary comparisons. Importantly, another reported Li–S battery device with hierarchical porous carbon rods (HPCR)–S composite acting as the cathode shows a sulfur loading of up to 88.8 wt%, ensuring much higher energy density.88 In contrast, a main drawback of the current g-C3N4-based materials is the relatively low S loading compared with others. The areal S loading not only affects the capacity, but also determines the gross specific energy of a packaged Li–S battery, as it strongly affects the weight percentage of active materials. Therefore, the S loading is expected to be increased by developing a substrate with a high specific surface area in the follow-up study.89

3.3 Lithium–oxygen battery (Li–O2 battery)
Currently, rechargeable Li–O2 batteries have drawn unprecedented attention since their theoretical specific energy (approximately 3560 W h kg−1) far exceeds that of state-of-the-art LIBs.90,91 Composed of a Li anode, a porous cathode and a Li+ conducting electrolyte, a non-aqueous Li–O2 battery operates well based on an overall reaction of 2Li + O2 + Li2O2.92 The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, 2Li+ + O2 + 2e− → Li2O2) during discharge and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, Li2O2 → O2 +2Li+ + 2e−) upon charging are both significant processes that determine the performance of the Li–O2 cells.93,94 g-C3N4-based materials have been utilized in Li–O2 batteries to address overpotential issues91,95 and promote the sluggish kinetics of both the ORR and OER.96–99
Theoretically, the standard thermodynamic potential for the formation and decomposition of solid Li2O2 is 2.96 V vs. Li+/Li. However, due to the insolubility and poor conductivity of Li2O2, the actual charging voltage can reach approximately 4 V, which seriously restricts the energy efficiency and thus hampers the practical use of Li–O2 batteries. To solve overpotential issues, using a dissolved redox mediator (RM) as the charge carrier between Li2O2 and the electrode surface has been proven effective.91,100 In Fig. 7c, Liu et al. employed a g-C3N4 photocatalyst along with an I− RM in a photoassisted Li–O2 battery. The results indicate that g-C3N4 dramatically reduced the charging voltage to 1.9 V, whereas a Li–O2 battery without I− RMs demonstrated a quite high charging voltage of 4.1 V. This effect is because I− can be oxidized to I3− with the help of the g-C3N4 photocatalyst, and I3− can subsequently oxidize Li2O2 on the O2 cathode. Meanwhile, photoexcited e− reduces Li+ to Li on the anode. Thus, the photovoltage generated on the photoelectrode compensates for the charging voltage of the Li–O2 battery to a great extent, resulting in an enhanced energy efficiency as high as 142%.91

g-C3N4-based materials not only act as excellent photocatalysts but also deliver good electrocatalytic activity to improve the ORR and OER kinetics of Li–O2 batteries. The O2 cathodes commonly play the role of supporting the catalysts or promoters, holding solid products as well as promoting the sole medium to transfer e− from an external circuit to the reaction areas. Hence, finding suitable cathode catalysts for Li–O2 batteries is crucial. In recent years, various materials (noble metals, C-based materials, transition metal oxides, TiN, Fe3C, etc.)101–106 have all shown superior electrocatalytic performance, among which C-based materials have been most widely explored. For instance, derived from WO3@g-C3N4, an N-doped defective carbon layer-encapsulated W2C composite (W2C@NC) was fabricated by Gao and co-workers. The schematic diagram in Fig. 7b illustrates the synergistic effect of the W2C@NC catalyst for the ORR and OER.106 As a novel C-based material with low cost and durability, g-C3N4 catalysts have been developed rapidly to replace traditional metal-based electrocatalysts. Luo et al. successfully synthesized a 3D graphene@g-C3N4 (G@CN) air electrode through a hydrothermal approach. It was formerly reported that a macroporous graphene cathode delivered a discharge capacity of nearly 13000 mA h g−1, whereas the as-obtained G@CN electrode exhibited an enhanced discharge capacity of over 17000 mA h g−1 when tested in Li–O2 batteries. As shown in Fig. 7i, the voltage of G@CN was above 2.4 V and below 4.4 V at the discharge and charge terminals after 105 cycles, respectively, manifesting superior cycling performance compared with pure graphene.96 Instead of a graphene network, another C-based material was also combined with g-C3N4 to act as a metal-free cathode. g-C3N4@carbon paper (GCN@CP) was prepared by Yi et al. via an in situ route, as shown in Fig. 7g. When tested in a Li–O2 battery, the GCN@CP cathode delivered a discharge capacity of approximately 500 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with an average voltage of 2.7 V. SEM images in Fig. 7d–f evidently demonstrate the morphologies of the resultant GCN@CP in a pristine state after discharge and recharge.99 As indicated by the two similar electrodes, the conductive C-based materials (graphene and CP) with porous structures were significant for e− transfer and rapid O2 diffusion, while g-C3N4 acted as a feasible ORR and OER electrocatalyst. The analysis also revealed that the formation and decomposition process of the nanocrystalline products (Li2O2) greatly affected the reversible discharge and charge capacities of high-energy Li–O2 batteries.
Coupled with other types of materials, g-C3N4 delivers more satisfactory electrocatalytic activity. A new sol–gel and pyrolysis method has been demonstrated (Fig. 7a) for the fabrication of a g-C3N4–LaNiO3 (CNL) catalyst, which was first proposed by Wu and co-workers. As one of the perovskite oxides (ABO3), LaNiO3 demonstrates intrinsic advantages to promote both the OER and ORR because Ni3+ at the B site has a single electron-filled eg orbit, which offers favorable M–O bond energy. Meanwhile, porous g-C3N4 has an ability to complex with abundant metal ions with a subsequent structural adjustment, which further enhances the as-obtained catalyst.98 Moreover, a ruthenium oxide nanoparticle decorated boron-doped C3N4 (RuO2@m-BCN) hybrid was manufactured by Lou et al. via thermally induced condensation followed by a solution process. In this resultant composite, labile C–C bonds do not exist, and the RuO2 lattices with many O2 vacancies offer substantial active sites for the ORR and OER processes. Thus, RuO2@m-BCN shows superior electrochemical stability over a wide voltage range from 2.5 V to 4.5 V and an excellent cycling performance, even up to 126 cycles(Fig. 7 h).97
In conclusion, a desired Li–O2 battery cathode should have all the following features: (1) a porous structure to offer more active sites; (2) impressive electronic conductivity for e− transfer and Li+ conduction; and (3) stability and catalytic activity for both the ORR and OER. Notably, suitable catalysts not only can accelerate the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 but also can restrict the occurrence of undesired Li2CO3 species or other side reaction intermediates. Therefore, the existing problems of high overpotential and kinetic limits in Li–O2 batteries can be partly solved by g-C3N4-based materials.
3.4 Zn–air battery (ZAB)
Among the versatile metal–air battery technologies, a rechargeable ZAB is an ideal device due to its security, low cost, durability of Zn in solutions and superb specific energy density (1086 W h kg−1).107 Despite their early start and great potential, to some extent, the development of ZABs has been impeded by problems associated with the metal electrodes and air catalysts. The schematic representation in Fig. 8b clearly shows that a primary ZAB consists of a metal–Zn anode and an air cathode with catalytic action as well as a separator and an electrolyte. Analogous to the mechanisms of Li–O2 batteries, the ORR and OER processes are also critical for the performance of ZABs.108

Much effort has been made to design stable and efficient bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts for flexible ZABs. Noble metal-based materials (such as Pt and Ir-based materials) and metal oxides (such as RuO2 and MnO2) are traditional and common catalysts in this sphere.108–110 To further overcome the disadvantages of metal-based electrocatalysts, Zhang et al. innovatively fabricated N, P co-doped porous carbon (NPMC) foams.111 This investigation set the stage for applying similar g-C3N4-based catalysts. A novel g-C3N4@multi-walled carbon nanotube supported Mn3O4 (g-C3N4@MWCNTs/Mn3O4) composite was prepared by Li and co-workers. When testing this composite in ZABs, the battery exhibited a peak power density of 192.4 mW cm−2 and large discharge current densities.26 Additionally, P, S co-doped g-C3N4 fibers (PS-CNFs)112 and P, S co-doped g-C3N4 sponges (P, S-CNS)113 were both synthesized by Shinde and co-workers. 3D PS-CNFs were obtained by a simple polymerization reaction, while P, S-CNS was synthesized via pyrolysis followed by similar polymerization (Fig. 8c). SEM and TEM images in Fig. 8e–g show that the cross-linked fibrous frameworks were densely in situ grown on carbon cloth and the diameters of the interconnected fibers varied from 130 to 173 nm for the PS-CNFs. A primary ZAB utilizing this cathode demonstrated a specific capacity of 698 mA h g−1, a high open circuit potential of 1.49 V and outstanding robustness for over 240 h after a couple of mechanical recharges. In contrast, a ZAB based on a P, S-CNS electrode manifested a higher specific capacity of 830 mA h g−1 along with an open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V. Though the resultant PS-CNF and P, S-CNS electrodes exhibited analogous energy densities and other superior characteristics to typical Pt-based catalysts (Fig. 8i), the performance of P, S-CNS was more satisfactory. This performance can be attributed to the controllable dimensions of the g-C3N4 sponge and the formation of a C–N polymeric complex (Fig. 8d), which endowed P, S-CNS with more active sites.
To attain more favorable metal-free bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR in ZABs, a series of g-C3N4-based materials play nonnegligible functions. Doping C-based materials with heteroatoms (N, S, P, F, etc.) is a promising strategy to boost catalytic activity, and manufacturing g-C3N4 with a rational structural design offers additional benefits.
3.5 Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB)
In addition to various rechargeable batteries, redox flow batteries also have unique superior characteristics for energy storage. Particularly, VRFBs have been proven to be suitable for large-scale applications because of their long life, high reliability and flexible design.114–116 Meanwhile, a relatively poor energy-to-volume ratio is the main disadvantage of this technology. Two electrolyte tanks with VO2+/VO2+ (positive) and V3+/V2+ (negative) redox couples, two pumps and a battery cell constitute a typical VRFB system.115
The electrodes are where the electrochemical reactions take place, so it is significant to find efficient catalysts for the VRFB electrodes. Based on previously explored carbon-based catalysts such as N-doped CNT/graphite felt,117 Huang and co-workers modified carbon felt (CF) with g-C3N4 to obtain C3N4-CF for catalyzing couple reactions. As demonstrated in Fig. 8h, carbon fibers were wrapped in wrinkled g-C3N4 with electrocatalytic redox reversibility; thus, an energy efficiency (EE) for C3N4-CF reaching 85% was achieved, which is higher than that for the CF electrodes.5
As a pivotal component in VRFBs, an ion exchange membrane (IEM) plays the role of separating ion pairs, avoiding the penetration of vanadium ions and accelerating proton transportation during charge/discharge processes.118 Commercial Nafion-based membranes,119 a polysulfone-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PSF–PVP)120 composite and a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) reinforced sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK/PTFE)115 membrane were all formerly reported. To further integrate the advantages and overcome the drawbacks of these membranes, novel g-C3N4-based hybrids are attracting increasingly more attention in this field. SPEEK/g-C3N4 (ref. 121) and oxidized g-C3N4 (OCN)-modified SPEEK122 were fabricated by Niu et al. and Wang et al., respectively. Two similar hybrid membranes were obtained via the same solution-casting approach. SPEEK/g-C3N4 showed a structure with roughness, which could be ascribed to extensive 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets. When tested in VRFBs, this as-obtained membrane delivered an impressive coulombic efficiency (CE) of 97% and an EE of 83.6% at a current density of 30 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, an excellent CE of approximately 98% along with decent ion selectivity (66000 S min cm−3) was observed when assembling the other OCN-modified SPEEK membranes. These two optimized hybrids both demonstrated higher CE and EE, lower vanadium ion permeability and superior ion selectivity than common SPEEK (CE: 90% and EE: 76%) or Nafion 117 (CE: 90% and EE: 74%) membranes.121 The mechanisms proposed in Fig. 8a reveal that laminar and porous g-C3N4 contributed more stable proton pathways as well as ion barriers; thus, g-C3N4-based materials exhibit great potential for enhancing the performance of traditional membranes in VRFBs.
3.6 Others
In recent years, g-C3N4-based materials have also been utilized in other batteries, including Na-ion batteries (SIBs),41 Li/Mg-ion batteries,123 Li metal batteries (LMBs)124 and fuel cells.27,125,126
Notably, the earliest studies of SIBs accompanied LIB research in the late 1970s. Due to the relatively low cost and abundance of Na in nature, SIBs have been utilized in large-scale applications. As shown in Fig. 9b, e− transfer and ion diffusion mechanisms in LIBs and SIBs are similar, thus making the design of dual materials a hot topic.41,127 The huCP/g-C3N4 composite represents a dual anode for both LIBs and SIBs. In addition to the aforementioned Li storage performance, this material also displays an excellent reversible capacity of 345 mA h g−1 after 380 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 in SIBs.57 In addition, 3D N-doped graphene was fabricated by Li and co-workers and the synthesis process contained the utilization of a g-C3N4 “microreactor” (Fig. 9a). The resultant anode delivered a superb reversible capacity of 305 mA h g−1 even after 500 cycles at a 0.2 A g−1 current density.128 Moreover, Hu et al. applied a nanostructured g-C3N4 electrolyte in LMBs. The schematic illustration in Fig. 9c clearly presents Li dendrite growth and inhibition based on Li symmetric cells with or without g-C3N4 addition. The added g-C3N4 endowed the Li/FeS2 battery with very stable and long-term cycling performance (Fig. 9d and e).124

4. Supercapacitor (SC)
4.1 SC storage principles and pristine g-C3N4 optimization
SCs, also known as ultra-capacitors, are reliable energy storage devices that combine the features of traditional capacitors and rechargeable batteries.129 Due to the high power density, large capacitance, and long cycle life along with environmental benefits, SCs have drawn increasing attention from researchers during recent years.130–132 On the basis of different energy storage mechanisms, SCs are typically classified into two categories: electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. With charge storage occurring both on or near the surface of the active electrode materials, the former is based on charge adsorption, while the latter focuses on reversible redox reactions.133,134
As demonstrated in Fig. 10b, an SC device consists of two electrodes, current collectors, a separator and a filled electrolyte.135 The essential factor that determines the electrochemical performance of SCs is the electrode material. Apart from common transition-metal oxides22 or conducting polymers, C-based electrodes136,137 exhibit the most potential. Impressively, g-C3N4 not only integrates the advantages of C-based materials (easy availability, abundant sources, and low cost) and the N-doping technique (enhanced surface polarity and improved surface wettability)138,139 but also offers unique benefits for SC storage. Schematic illustrations in Fig. 10a and e clearly show that g-C3N4-based electrodes can effectively act as negative electrode and positive electrode materials, respectively, in asymmetric SC devices.

Compared to various synthesis methods for doping N on C-based electrodes, g-C3N4 can be derived easily from melamine treatment,15,140 which largely avoids complexity and high expense. Additionally, the larger surface areas and more suitable bandgaps endow g-C3N4 with more active reaction sites, improved electron acceptor/donor properties and additional pseudocapacitance. To further utilize the majority of the pristine g-C3N4 material, a nanostructured electrode replaced its bulk counterparts with regard to certain applications. Tubular g-C3N4 (ref. 140) and g-C3N4 nanofibers (GCNNFs)141 were both fabricated by Tahir and co-workers. The SEM and TEM images in Fig. 10c and d exhibit uniform and dense tubular-structured g-C3N4 with a diameter of 0.8 mm on average. The manufacturing of these two materials' distinctive morphologies results from melamine pretreatment with HNO3 (breaking the electroneutrality of the aromatic ring and polymerizing) in the presence of alcohol. When applied in SCs, the tubular g-C3N4 electrode showed a specific capacitance of 233 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 90% after 1000 cycles in a 6 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 10g). At the same time, the GCNNF electrode demonstrated a higher capacitance of 263.75 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and maintained approximately 93% of its capacitance after 2000 cycles in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 10f). The contrast in the performance of this structure compared to the cycling performance of bulk g-C3N4 clearly proved that the structural optimization of g-C3N4 is an effective option for SC storage.
4.2 Binary g-C3N4-based composite

4.2.1 Metal oxide (MO)/g-C3N4. 
To date, pseudocapacitive transition-metal oxides such as MnO2, Fe3O4, NiO, RuO2 and Co3O4 (ref. 142–144) have been extensively explored as electrode materials for SCs.145 The hybridization of these metal oxides with g-C3N4 has been demonstrated to yield highly improved performance when compared with any individual component.
The synthesis of different MnO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites has been reported, and the strategies mainly include a soft chemical route146 and hydrothermal methods.147,148 Chang et al. fabricated a sandwich-like MnO2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (NC) and another MnO2/graphene oxide (GO) NC using a nearly identical approach. When tested in SCs, the MnO2/g-C3N4 NC electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 211 F g−1 at a 1 A g−1 current density in 0.5 M Na2SO4, while the capacitance of MnO2/GO NC was only 190 F g−1 under the same conditions.146 In addition, C-doped g-C3N4@MnO2 (CCNM),147 K-doped g-C3N4@MnO2 (K-CNM) and Na-doped g-C3N4@MnO2 (Na-CNM)148 were all obtained via facile hydrothermal reactions. All these nanocomposites showed higher capacitances along with better cycle stability than the formerly reported pure MnO2 (ref. 149) or MnO2/C-based150 electrodes. These findings indicate that based on the advantageous features of MnO2 (low cost, high theoretical specific capacitance, natural abundance, etc.), the integration of g-C3N4 could further promote the formation of hierarchical structures, thus facilitating the enhanced electrochemical performance of the SCs.
Hybridizing g-C3N4 with Fe2O3 is also an effective option in SC applications. Novel g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 hollow microspheres were prepared by Xu and co-workers through a solvothermal method. Importantly, the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachlorideferrate(III) [Bmim]FeCl4 not only played the role of an Fe source but also acted as the template and dispersing medium during the synthesis processes. As shown in Fig. 11f and e, respectively, the as-obtained g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 samples delivered a high specific capacitance of 260 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and stable cycling performance at 1 A g−1 with a common three electrode system in 2.5 M Li2SO4.151 Moreover, a single-step pyrolysis method was designed by Liu et al. for the fabrication of a g-C3N4/nanostructured α-Fe2O3 composite. Cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 11d) at different scan rates clearly presented the pseudocapacitive characteristics of the g-C3N4/α-Fe2O3 electrode.152 In contrast to individual α-Fe2O3 nanostructures153 for the SCs, the interaction between the added g-C3N4 and α-Fe2O3 can facilitate better a morphology and crystallinity, higher surface area and lower electronic resistance.

The above-mentioned electrodes show potential applications of similar metal oxide/g-C3N4 materials in SC storage. Nanoneedle (Fig. 11c) and nanosheet-like NiCo2O4/g-C3N4 materials were obtained by Guan and co-workers via two different synthesis routes (Fig. 11a). The nanoneedle-like composite possessed a higher specific capacitance of 253 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, while the other nanosheet-assembled electrode revealed a superior cycling stability of 101.4% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles.154 In addition, the TiO2/C3N4 hybrid was prepared by Zhao et al. through a hydrothermal method with subsequent heat treatment (Fig. 11b); the hybrid delivered a capacitance retention of almost 100% even after 1000 cycles.155
In summary, manufacturing metal oxide/g-C3N4 composites can address the existing large volume change, agglomeration and limited surface area deficiencies of metal oxide electrodes, as well as simultaneously protecting the g-C3N4 layers from restacking or expanding. Hence, these electrode materials with a large number of active sites and optimized conductivity show extraordinary performance.


4.2.2 Metal sulfide (MS)/g-C3N4. 
Transition metal sulfides such as CoS, Mo2S, NiS or CuS156–158 generally present better mechanical durability and higher conductivity compared to their oxide counterparts; however, the possible structural degradation during cycling hinders their superiority in SC applications. Integrating metal sulfides with inorganic functional materials has been proven to be a feasible strategy to solve this shortcoming. A layered g-C3N4 nanomaterial is an ideal option.
A g-C3N4/cobalt sulfide (CN/CS) nanosheet-on-nanosheet composite was successfully fabricated by Jiang et al. via a simple solvothermal method. The as-obtained samples were tested as positive electrodes in SCs. Fig. 12d demonstrates the cyclic voltammograms measured in a potential window between 0 and 0.4 V vs. SCE at the same scan rate (10 mV s−1). The 50%-CN/CS sample delivered the highest specific capacitance of 668 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of up to 98% after 5000 cycles (Fig. 12e)159. In another report, Ansari et al. synthesized a novel MoS2–g-C3N4 heterojunction via a mechanical milling method, and the resultant electrode manifested a capacitance of 240.85 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.160 Furthermore, as a ternary transition metal sulfide, NiCo2S4 tends to display superior performance to its binary counterparts, which can be ascribed to abundant redox reactions as well as synergetic effects derived from its complex chemical constitution. Hydrothermal methods were utilized to fabricate two types of NiCo2S4/g-C3N4 composites (Fig. 12a). Carbon self-repairing porous g-C3N4 nanosheets/NiCo2S4 nanoparticles (CPCN-NSs/NCS-NPs)161 and NiCo2S4 nanosheets/porous g-C3N4 (NiCo2S4 NSs/P-g-C3N4)162 were prepared by Guo et al. and Li et al., respectively. The CPCN-NSs/NCS-NPs delivered an excellent capacitance of 1557 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintained a 92.6% capacitance retention up to 10000 cycles. A specific capacitance of 506C g−1 at the same current density with nearly no attenuation after 1500 cycles could be observed when testing the NiCo2S4 NSs/P-g-C3N4 electrode in a 2 M NaOH electrolyte.

There is no doubt that the strong interfacial interaction between the metal sulfides and g-C3N4 largely optimizes the specific capacitance and cycling stability of SCs. With metal sulfides functioning as conductive linkers, porous g-C3N4 provides a high surface area and shows improved electron donor and wettable properties. Therefore, these reports may be meaningful for the exploration of additional metal sulfide/g-C3N4 electrode materials with enhanced electrochemical activity for high-performance SCs.


4.2.3 Metal hydroxide (MOH)/g-C3N4. 
Transition metal hydroxides are also one of the most widely used pseudocapacitive materials in SCs due to their low cost as well as impressive redox activity. Among them, nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) manifests a superior theoretical specific capacitance of approximately 3750 F g−1163 and can be further optimized by combining it with g-C3N4. A new hydrothermal approach introducing g-C3N4 to Ni(OH)2 nanoplates has been proposed by Shi et al. for the fabrication of a unique flower-like composite (Fig. 12b and c). When tested as a SC electrode material, the resultant g-C3N4/Ni(OH)2 electrode delivers a capacitance of 505.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1.164 In addition, a much higher specific capacitance (1768.7 F g−1 at 7 A g−1) can be observed when applying another g-C3N4@Ni(OH)2 (CN/Ni) honeycomb electrode in asymmetric SCs. Dong and co-workers prepared this electrode via sonication and heat treatment. Impressively, CN/Ni also exhibited an excellent energy density of 43.1 W h kg−1 along with a power density of 9126 W kg−1.25 The attractive performance of these two electrodes indicates that controlling the morphology or structure of the electrodes is quite crucial. The interconnected flower-like or honeycomb architectures both shorten the diffusion path lengths for the electrolyte ions and e−, thus enabling higher mass transfer efficiency. Besides, the presence of g-C3N4 provides additional pseudocapacitance and improves the limited cycle life of conventional Ni(OH)2 electrodes. Moreover, based on the feasibility of introducing conductive carbon,165,166 layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be innovatively hybridized with C-based semiconductors. g-C3N4/NiAl-LDH prepared by Zhang et al. presented decent supercapacitive performance.167

4.2.4 C-based material/g-C3N4
With regard to commercial electrode materials for SCs, C-based materials168–171 such as activated carbon, graphene and rGO, are the most universal. These materials mostly feature decent electrical conductivity and excellent cycle lifetime, whereas their intrinsic electrostatic surface charging mechanisms and severe agglomeration impede the specific capacitance and energy density. To address this, constructing g-C3N4/C-based material composites has been proposed.
Three types of g-C3N4 functionalized graphene composites have been successfully fabricated via facile solvothermal or hydrothermal methods. (Fig. 13a).172 Wen et al. explored asymmetric SC devices using rGO/g-C3N4 as the negative electrode in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. Impressively, this device revealed an energy density of 36.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 480 W kg−1, and excellent cycling durability (95% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) was also observed4 (Figure 13e). Another g-C3N4@G composite with supercapacitive properties was obtained by Chen and co-workers.135 Afterwards, by placing carbon self-repairing g-C3N4 (C-C3N4) in contact with GO, Ding et al. innovatively prepared a 3D C-C3N4@rGO hybrid.172 From Fig. 13c and d, it can be concluded that the g-C3N4/graphene composites show a greater specific capacitance than pristine graphene-based electrodes. Furthermore, C-C3N4@rGO (379.7 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1) demonstrates a higher capacitance than g-C3N4@G (264 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1), which can largely be attributed to a self-repairing technique.

Inspired by the abovementioned g-C3N4/C-based material composites, the range of g-C3N4-based electrodes for SCs can be ulteriorly extended. With highly conductive graphene matrices serving as a current collector, g-C3N4 adhered to the graphene surface not only alleviates aggregation but also effectively increases the wettability of the electrolytes due to its N-rich characteristic.

4.2.5 Others. 
g-C3N4 can be coupled with some other materials to form binary composites. Ansari et al. proposed the synthesis of red phosphorus-g-C3N4 (RPh-g-C3N4) heterostructures via a mechanical ball milling method. The electrochemical performance is decent with a high specific capacitance of 465 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1 and a stable capacitance retention of 90% after 1000 charge/discharge tests.173 In addition, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/g-C3N4 (PEDOT/g-C3N4) binary electrode was manufactured by Chen et al. through a layer-by-layer assembly approach.174 The synergistic effects between the two constituent parts largely contribute to the property enhancement.

4.3 Ternary g-C3N4-based composite
Zhang et al. proposed the synthesis of a novel 3D RuO2/g-C3N4@rGO aerogel composite (RCGA) through facile hydrothermal and freeze-drying processes (Fig. 13b). When tested in an SC device, RCGA manifested an admirable specific capacitance of 704.3 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with nearly no capacitance loss up to 2000 cycles175 (Fig. 13f). In addition, with g-C3N4/rGO (CNRG) serving as an immobilization substrate, a CNRG/Ni(OH)2 composite was obtained by Li and co-workers. The resultant CNRG/Ni(OH)2 electrode showed a high capacitance of 1785 F g−1 at 2 A g−1.176 These results all highlight the potential applications of ternary g-C3N4-based composites for high-performance SCs. g-C3N4 can be highly dispersed and can increase the electrochemical activity center, thus significantly improving the synthesis performance of ternary composites.
In summary, various types of g-C3N4-based materials above can play the role of electrodes in SCs, delivering enhanced electrochemical performances. The related research results are briefly demonstrated in Table 3. Furthermore, concerning the conditions of real applications, some problems still exist. Most of the SCs use aqueous electrolytes, but the working voltage of such electrolytes is relatively low, thus the devices cannot reach a high working voltage. Long-term cycling causes irreversible side-reactions, deteriorates the electrochemical performance, and increases the internal pressure of the device. Repeated cycling is confirmed as a more harmful technique for the electrode integrity compared to the voltage holding in a floating test.177 More research on g-C3N4-based electrodes should focus on voltage floating tests in SC applications.

5. Conclusions and outlook
This review offers an updated overview of g-C3N4-based materials applied in batteries (LIBs, Li–O2 batteries, Li–S batteries, ZABs, VRFBs, SIBs, etc.) and SCs. The synthesis methods, morphologies, and electrochemical performance of the materials are elaborately introduced.
With a unique structure analogous to graphite, g-C3N4 has attracted increasing attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Notably, on the surface of g-C3N4, numerous surface defects induced by N atoms and high concentrations of C–N–C species both contribute to improved electrochemical performance. Hence, based on the mechanism of different devices, versatile g-C3N4-based materials have been synthesized. For batteries, g-C3N4 plays multiple roles, namely, as an electrode material in LIBs and Li–S batteries and as a photocatalyst/electrocatalyst in Li–O2 batteries, ZABs and VRFBs. Modified g-C3N4-based materials show larger surface areas, better structural integrity and catalytic activity, thus fulfilling its practical advantages. For SCs, the N-rich skeleton of g-C3N4 is crucial since it largely enhances the charge mobility and surface wettability of the electrodes. In summary, the introduction of conductive materials and the fabrication of desirable g-C3N4 structures are two typical pathways to overcome the drawbacks of pristine g-C3N4 and obtain electrochemical stability for both of the abovementioned devices.
Apart from the new achievements, certain challenges and bottlenecks of g-C3N4-based materials still exist: (1) the electrochemical storage mechanism of g-C3N4 may affect the electrochemical performance of the batteries and SCs, and investigation in this respect should be a focus; (2) research into the actual mechanisms of surface phenomena on g-C3N4 is underway, but there is still a long way to go; (3) the synthesis of pure g-C3N4 is diverse and easy; however, effective ways to further control its ordered morphology is quite limited; and (4) the interaction force between g-C3N4 and other conductive materials may interfere with charge transfer, and related research should be conducted to avoid the existing drawbacks.
To explore more satisfactory electrochemical characteristics, future prospects in the study of g-C3N4-based materials are proposed as follows: (1) apart from the reported morphologies of g-C3N4 (nanosheets, nanofibers and nanotubes), the synthesis of other unique nanostructures with higher surface areas such nanowires or nanorods is also possible; (2) the synergistic effects in g-C3N4-based composites are significant, and the advantages of g-C3N4 and conductive materials should be better integrated; (3) based on the innovative idea for the fabrication of ND-g-C3N4 by Chen and co-workers, more investigations regarding an adjustment of the N content and N types in g-C3N4-based materials should be made. It is anticipated that g-C3N4-based materials will have broader applications for electrochemical energy storage in the near future.
