    , Accepted 5th June 2018First published on 6th June 2018AbstractLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries have recently attracted enormous attention in the energy-storage sector owing to their high theoretical capacities (1675 mA h g−1), high theoretical energy densities (2600 W h kg−1), and cost-effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Despite these merits, the practical application of Li–S battery technology is hindered by certain severe drawbacks. Therefore, current challenges need to be diagnosed in order to find effective solutions to these Li–S battery-commercialization obstacles. To help direct future work, we not only summarize current research trends, but also highlight an effective solution for the practical applications of Li–S batteries. In this review, we thoroughly summarize current research work on three kinds of Li–S battery systems based on different cathode materials, namely sulfur (S8), lithium sulfide, and sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile. In addition, we also provide insight into the current challenges associated with Li–metal anodes in Li–S batteries. We then summarize and discuss an effective solution to these issues, namely the use of Li–metal-free anodes or all-solid state electrolytes in Li–S full cell systems.
1. Introduction
Rapidly growing population and associated energy problems are currently major global issues. An increase in the use of traditional fossil-fuel energy raises further concerns about environmental pollution. To reduce the dependence on fossil fuel and to mitigate its environmental impact, renewable energy sources urgently need to be developed, including solar power, geothermal energy, and wind energy.1–4 However, these types of energy sources only provide power intermittently, therefore cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy-storage devices need to be developed. Rechargeable batteries, such as metal-hydride, lead-acid, and Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have played significant roles for more than a century in applications that include portable electronic appliances and as backup power supplies, owing to their high energy densities, good cycle lives, user-friendliness, and low maintenance costs.5–7
Over the past three decades, LIBs have dominated the energy-storage market due to their high energy densities (e.g., 387 W h kg−1 for a LiCoO2/graphite battery). However, as a result of rapidly developing electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), further increases in the energy densities of LIBs are urgently being sought. Hence, electrode materials with either higher charge-storage capacities or higher cell operating voltages are required. However, existing cathode materials, including LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4, are mainly based on insertion-type mechanisms and have low specific capacities of less than 200 mA h g−1, which limits the ability to improve LIB energy density.8–15 Sulfur cathode materials, present in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, perform two-electron conversion reactions and have high theoretical specific capacities (1675 mA h g−1).16 As a consequence, Li–S batteries possess high energy densities and are among the most promising energy-storage devices. Moreover, the low cost of sulfur and its environmental friendliness make Li–S batteries better candidates than the state-of-the-art LIBs.17–21
In spite of these merits, the practical application of a Li–S system is still hindered by the following challenges: (1) the large volume change (80%) associated with conversion reactions that take place in sulfur cathodes; (2) the insulating nature of sulfur and its reaction products (Li2S2/Li2S); (3) the shuttle reaction resulting from dissolved Li polysulfides (Li2Sx, x > 2) in electrolytes;22–24 (4) the highly active Li metal anode, which changes its morphology and structure through dendrite formation during continuous cycling, causing short circuiting and serious safety issues;25–28 and (5) the evolution of gasses such as N2 and N2O, in addition to CH4 and H2, as volatile products, which results in the degradation of electrochemical performance.29 In order to solve these problems, various strategies have been implemented, including: (1) the design of porous and highly conductive carbon host materials that encapsulate sulfur;30 (2) the preparation of polar host materials that chemically trap polysulfides;31 (3) the exploitation of robust multifunctional binders;32 (4) the use of functional interlayers/separators that restrain the shuttle effect;33 (5) the construction of specially structured electrodes including 3D current collectors, as well as sandwich and layer-by-layer structured cathodes;34 (6) the exploitation of solid-state electrolytes for preventing polysulfide dissolution;35 (7) the preparation of anodic protection layers;36 and (8) the use of Li–metal-free anodes that tackle safety concerns involving metallic Li.37
Although numerous approaches that address current cathode issues in Li–S batteries have been explored by both the scientific community and industry, problems surrounding Li–metal anodes still remain and urgently need to be overcome for the practical application of Li–S batteries. Several approaches, such as the application of electrolyte additives,38 gas-phase doping on the Li metal,39 atomic layer deposition on the Li metal,40 and polymeric coatings,41 have been used in attempts to protect the Li–metal surface. However, these strategies fail at high charge–discharge currents in high-sulfur-loaded Li–S batteries. Meanwhile, the assembly of Li–S batteries with highly active Li–metal anodes is a major commercialization challenge. For this reason, Li–metal-free anodes are more suitable for the construction of reliable Li–S battery systems, and to avoid the challenges associated with Li–metal anodes. Furthermore, when a high-specific-capacity anode is used, the full cell system can possess an energy density that is six-to-seven times higher than that of the existing LiCoO2/graphite system.42 Hence, this battery technology can fulfil the demands of sophisticated electronic equipment, technological advances in electric vehicles (travel ranges of up to 500 km), and high-energy-storage grids.43–48
In this review, we first present recent developments and operating mechanisms of three types of Li–S system composed of sulfur (S8), lithium sulfide (Li2S), and sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile (SPAN). We then summarize and discuss the challenges associated with Li–metal anodes in Li–S battery systems. Finally, we discuss strategies for enhancing capacity and energy density, and for overcoming safety issues involving Li–S batteries, and provide suggestions for future guidance. This review provides important insight into the scientific and practical issues involved with the development of Li–S batteries.
2. Cathodes for Li–S batteries
In this section, we summarize current research and the major issues associated with Li–S batteries based on three kinds of cathode materials (i.e., S8, Li2S, and S–PAN). Fig. 1a–c reveals steadily increasing numbers of papers published since 2010, demonstrating that this is an actively researched field. The most commonly used cathode material in Li–S batteries is elemental sulfur, among which cyclo-S8 is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope under ambient conditions. To enable this kinetically sluggish reaction, a series of soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sx, x > 2) are produced during the reaction, as displayed in Fig. 2a.49 In this system, Li metal is oxidized to produce Li ions and electrons at the anode during the discharge process. The Li ions then move to the cathode via the electrolyte while the electrons travel through the external circuit to generate an electrical current. At the cathode side, sulfur reacts with the Li ions and electrons, and is reduced in a stepwise manner, as shown below.

For the charging process:52 2S42− − 2e = S82−/S8(6) S82−/S62− − 2e = S8(7)
Li2S, as the discharge product, can also be used as an active material for Li–S batteries. Fig. 2b shows that an activation potential is first required to charge the cell in a Li–S system.50 After charging, Li2S is converted into elemental sulfur and Li ions, and electrons are produced at the positive electrode. During the discharge process, Li ions and electrons react with sulfur to produce Li2S again. The reactions are described as shown below.
Charging process: 8Li2S → S8 + 16Li+ + 16e−(8)
Discharging process: S8 + 16Li+ + 16e− → 8Li2S(9)

Fig. 2c displays charge and discharge curves for a SPAN-based cathode.51 The sulfur particles are in situ embedded in PAN-based carbon, which has a high melting point and electrical conductivity. This assembled Li–S cell is in a charged state and therefore cell operation begins with a discharge process. The reaction mechanism for SPAN during charging and discharging is as follows:53 During discharging, the –Sx– chain is first broken to form –SyLi and –Sx−yLi segments, whose ends are covalently bonded to polymer backbones. Insoluble Li2S is formed on the conducting carbon surface as discharge progresses, and the values of y and (x − y) in the SPAN gradually decrease toward unity, at which point further discharging results in the breakdown of the C–S bonds and the formation of conjugated bonds to carbon. The final discharge products are mixtures of conjugated polymer backbones and Li2S. Following charging, the conjugated polymer backbone first loses electrons to form delocalized radical cations that immediately trap Li2S to form C–SLi seeds; further charging results in the growth of sulfur chains from these C–SLi seeds. When no Li2S is available around the reaction sites, two grown C–SLi segments close electrochemically to form a ring that is similar to the original structure. The SPAN redox reaction takes place between solid SPAN and solid Li2S during the entire discharging/charging process.
2.1 S/C-composite cathodes
Owing to the insulating natures of sulfur and Li2S2/Li2S, a conductive host or matrix is required for improved electron transport.54,55 A sulfur–carbon composite is synthesized by the melt-infiltration method in which elemental sulfur is melted between 119–159 °C. Following infiltration, the electrode materials are post-treated at 300 °C to remove non-adsorbed sulfur. This method provides precise control of sulfur loading.19 Vapor infiltration is another promising method for the synthesis of a C–S composite. Rings of molecular sulfur (S6–8) are formed at 445 °C, while smaller allotropes of sulfur (S2–4) dominate at 550 °C; these allotropes show valuable electrochemical properties that are different to those of S8. This method is beneficial for the infiltration of sulfur into microporous materials.56 Apart from liquid and vapor infiltration, a C–S composite can also be synthesized by solution infiltration. In this method, carbon materials are added to a sulfur-CS2 solution at room temperature, followed by solvent evaporation at room temperature. The residual powder is then ground and heated at 155 °C to enhance sulfur distribution inside the carbon matrix.57
Nazar's group initially demonstrated the encapsulation of sulfur (sulfur content < 55 wt%) in a CMK-3 carbon host, and reported a high specific capacity of 1320 mA h g−1.19 Many publications have since appeared that report improvements in the capacities and cycle lives of Li–S batteries using conductive carbon matrices,58–66 while numerous S/C-composite cathodes exhibit stable cycling performance up to 500 cycles.67–72 Despite these achievements, the areal mass loadings of sulfur in the reported S/C-composite cathodes are normally less than 2 mg cm−2.73–79 To increase the energy densities of Li–S batteries, one trend involves enhancing the mass loading of sulfur on the electrode, and increased sulfur mass loadings (2–10 mg cm−2) have been reported in recent years.80–111 However, these areal mass loadings are still incapable of generating sufficient energy density to meet the requirements of modern technological applications. As state-of-the-art LIBs require 2 mA h cm−2 to operate HEVs, whereas EVs require 4 mA h cm−2, and considering that the operating voltage of a Li–S battery is 2.1 V, a Li–S battery requires a higher areal specific capacity to achieve the same travel range as an LIB. To further increase the transportation, range beyond 500 km, the areal capacity of a sulfur cathode needs to be more than 7 mA h cm−2, which can be achieved by increasing the sulfur areal mass loading to more than 10 mg cm−2. Fig. 1d displays the relationship between areal capacity and mass loading of sulfur over the 0.4–60 mg cm−2 range. The areal capacity increases with increasing sulfur mass loading. However, such remarkable improvements in Li–S battery performance with extremely high sulfur loadings have only been achieved in coin-type half-cells. Moreover, the amount of electrolyte used in these Li/S systems is usually 10–15 times the weight of sulfur in the cell; this lowers the practical energy density and impedes Li–S-battery commercialization.112,113
To mitigate these issues, recent research efforts have focused on reducing the electrolyte volume or the use of lean electrolyte conditions;114,115 however, several drawbacks, such as poor electrode wetting, electrochemical reaction kinetics, and charge transport between the interface also occur simultaneously.100,113 Therefore in order to achieve good electrochemical performance as well as high energy density, investigations into optimizing the E/S ratio are very important.115,116 Even though high energy densities comparable to those of commercial LIBs can be obtained, research into preventing electrolyte depletion and controlling the volatile electrolyte solution (DME/DOL-based electrolyte) is also needed.

Table 1 demonstrates that sulfur mass loadings of greater than 10 mg cm−2 have been achieved by several groups in recent years, through the use of various filling techniques and electrode architectures. Li et al.117 developed three-dimensionally aligned porous-carbon microchannels fabricated through the carbonization of wood and its subsequent filling with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), in order to achieve high sulfur mass loadings (Fig. 3a). The Li–S cell delivered areal capacities of 6.7 and 12.6 mA h cm−2 at increased sulfur mass loadings of 7.8 and 15.2 mg cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3b). A remarkably high areal capacity of 15.2 mA h cm−2 was also obtained at a sulfur mass loading of 21.3 mg cm−2 at 1.56 mA cm−2. Luo et al. reported the preparation of functionalized carbonized mesoporous wood fiber as a sulfur host electrode by atomic layer deposition, which delivered a reversible capacity of 859 mA h g−1 over 450 cycles, and a capacity-decay rate of 0.046% per cycle.120 Fang et al. prepared hollow carbon-fiber foam (HCFF) by the carbonization of natural cotton and used it as a 3D current collector that accommodated large amounts of sulfur multiwall-carbon-nanotube–carbon-black (MWCNT–CB) hybrids.118Fig. 3c–e reveals that sulfur–MWCNT–CB clusters are located in the voids between the long carbon fibers. Void space still remains even at a high loading of 10.8 mg cm−2, which is beneficial for electrolyte uptake and the accommodation of volume expansion during cycling. Therefore, the HCFF-S electrode with a sulfur mass loading of 10.8 mg cm−2 exhibited an areal capacity of 7.74 mA h cm−2 at 0.1C after 50 cycles (Fig. 3f). A high initial areal capacity of 23.32 mA h cm−2 was achieved with a further increase in mass loading to 21.2 mg cm−2 when the cell was cycled at 3.55 mA cm−2; improved stability, with a high areal capacity of 14.8 mA h cm−2, was demonstrated after 150 cycles (Fig. 3g). We prepared a modified high-sulfur-loaded electrode (MHSE) by mixing functionalized CNTs, chitosan binder, and acetylene black, followed by casting onto aluminum foil. Through the use of elemental sulfur, this electrode had a high sulfur loading of 10 mg cm−2, and was divided into three separate components: (i) a scaffold made of a uniform mixture of N-doped acetylene black (AB) and N-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), (ii) the chitosan binder, and (iii) nitrogen-doped MWCNTs of a netting carbon film (NCF), as shown in Fig. 3h–j.119

Owing to the synergetic effects of these three components, the MHSE cell exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1332 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, a stable efficiency of 98% throughout cycling, and a capacity fade of only 1.9 mA h g−1 per cycle (Fig. 3k). Fig. 3l shows that good rate performance was also obtained. The cells were cycled at rates between 0.1C and 2C, and their capacities did not plummet, even at high currents (2C discharge capacity, 845 mA h g−1; 2C/0.1C, 63%).
2.2 Li2S/C-composite cathodes
Fully lithiated Li2S, with a high theoretical capacity (1160 mA h g−1) and energy density, is also a promising candidate for cathode materials in Li–S cells. Li2S possesses a high decomposition temperature (>900 °C); therefore, to improve conductivity, Li2S/C composites can be synthesized through pyrolysis with a carbon precursor. Moreover, lithiated sulfur can easily be paired with Li–metal-free anodes. Although a Li2S-based cathode has these advantages, the electronic- and ionic-insulating nature of Li2S requires a high activation potential during the first charging process, which leads to low active-material use in subsequent cycles.132–138 In addition, the Li2S-based cathode also suffers from an 80% volume change and the shuttle effect during cycling. In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li2S cathodes, numerous developments in the design of advanced electrodes have taken place; high capacities in excess of 500 mA h g−1 and long cycle lives of 1000 cycles, have been achieved.139–146 However, to further improve the capacities and energy densities of Li2S-cathode-based Li–S batteries, optimized cell-design parameters are required. The Li2S–C composite is synthesized by a solution-based chemical process. A solution of Li2S is mixed with carbon to form the Li2S–C composite, after which it is dried at 40–60 °C inside a glove box.147 The Li2S–C composite can also be synthesized through a one-step solid-state reaction, in which lithium–metal foil is reacted with CS2 vapor carried by argon gas in a tubular furnace at 650 °C.148 In this section, we highlight recent research progress on Li2S cathodes for use in Li–S batteries. The electrochemical performance of a Li2S cathode-based Li–S cell is usually related to the mass loading and content of Li2S, the electrolyte dosage, and the starting active materials. Low Li2S mass loadings (<2 mg cm−2) and contents (<60 wt%), and abundant electrolyte dosages were initially used.24,133,149–151 In order to obtain high energy densities, many research groups have reported good cell performance with high mass loadings.139,152–158Fig. 1e displays the relationship between Li2S mass loading and the areal specific capacity, which increases with increasing mass loading, suggesting that the energy density of the cell increases. Table 2 lists the performance of several Li–S batteries with high Li2S mass loadings (>3 mg cm−2).

Recently, Yu et al.156 designed a low-cost freestanding and flexible Li2S-based paper electrode, which was prepared by an electrospinning method. This flexible paper was carbonized by a carbothermal reduction process, in which Li2SO4 was reduced to Li2S (Li2SO4 + 2C → Li2S + 2CO2) to form Li2S-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (Li2S@NCNFs), as shown in Fig. 4a. The electrochemical performance of Li2S@NCNF between 1.7 and 2.8 V, at a rate of 1C, is shown in Fig. 4b. An initial discharge capacity of 560 mA h g−1 (3.36 mA h cm−2) and a capacity retention of 76% were obtained after 200 cycles with a Li2S loading of 6.0 mg cm−2. Even with a Li2S loading of 9.0 mg cm−2, a high initial capacity of 520 mA h g−1 (4.68 mA h cm−2) could still be achieved with stable capacity retention (>65%) over 200 cycles. A higher Li2S mass loading of 10.7 mg cm−2 was achieved by Balach et al.158 Li2S 15 nm nanoparticles were formed by the full lithiation and irreversible decomposition of MoS2 at a low potential (Fig. 4c).

The charge/discharge curves for the first few cycles following activation are shown in Fig. 4d, which are similar to those of the SPAN composite and sulfur-confined ultramicroporous carbon-cathode systems that are governed by solid-state chemical reactions. This behavior explains the lack of soluble polysulfide formation and, therefore, its good performance in a carbonate-based electrolyte. Consequently, the Li2S–Li cell delivered an average areal capacity of 7.5 mA h cm−2 cycled between 0.8 and 3.0 V at a rate of 0.1C (Fig. 4e). Although Li2S/C based cathodes with high mass loadings and superior electrochemical properties for use in Li–S batteries have been reported in the literature,134,152,159,160 approaches that use Li2S as the cathode material in Li–S batteries still need further modification in terms of morphological control, uniform lithiation, and cost-effective scalable synthesis.
2.3 S/PAN-composite cathodes
Liquid sulfur infiltration, which involves the melting of elemental sulfur at 155 °C and its subsequent infiltrate into porous carbon architectures, has been widely used to prepare carbon–sulfur-based composites. Apart from liquid infiltration, vapor infiltration has also been used to synthesize sulfur–carbon composites; however, this method results in weak interactions between elemental sulfur and the carbon matrix, leading to unevenly distributed sulfur and poor electrochemical performance of the corresponding Li–S battery.161,162 In addition, polysulfide dissolution causes the viscosity of the electrolyte to increase, while lowering ionic conductivity and clogging the separator membrane. In order to resolve these issues, sulfurized polymer-composite-cathode materials show great promise for incorporation into high-performance Li–S cell designs. The SPAN composite, which is a sulfurized polymer, uses interactions between the nitrile groups of the polymer and elemental sulfur to destabilize PAN and promote dehydrogenation and ring formation.163 After thermal treatment at high temperature in an inert atmosphere, sulfur species are covalently bound throughout the composite, which results in a combination of physical entrapment and chemical conjugation of elemental sulfur in the host PAN matrix.164 In addition, the lone electron pairs present in the nitrile groups of PAN readily interact with Li through coordination bonding. Interactions between Li2S and the PAN polymer result in a stiffening of the PAN framework as the Li2S is uniformly dispersed. Here Li2S acts as a cross-linking agent that interconnects the PAN network. Such a material-design strategy improves the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries. In this section, we present recent developments in the field of SPAN-based composite cathodes for Li–S batteries.
Low sulfur content in SPAN-based composites is a major barrier to achieving high areal capacity and energy density. In addition, the low operating voltage of 1.8 V further reduces the energy density of SPAN-based Li–S batteries. In this context, an optimized cell design with a high mass loading of sulfur that improves the specific areal capacity, or a reduction in additional electrode weight in order to increase gravimetric specific capacity, is required. Research on SPAN-cathode-based Li–S batteries began with Wang et al. who delivered a battery with a specific capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 using a 65% sulfur content in the composite.165 The same group explored SPAN composites in a PVDF-gel electrolyte that delivered a specific capacity of 600 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which is five times higher than that of a LiCoO2-based cathode.166 Yu et al. also synthesized conducting sulfur-containing electrodes by heating PAN with sulfur at a high temperature, which delivered a specific capacity of 480 mA h g−1 after 240 cycles with a capacity retention of 92%.167,168 Fanous et al. showed that a SPAN composite synthesized at 330 °C with S–C bonds delivered a specific capacity of more than 1000 mA h g−1, based on the sulfur mass, after 40 cycles in carbonate-based electrolytes.169 Other SPAN-based cathode materials for Li–S batteries have also been employed in order to further enhance capacity and cycling stability.51,170–172
Recently, Frey et al.173 developed a simple and scalable synthesis method for poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(acrylonitrile) (PMMA/PAN) fibers. Fibrous SPAN was obtained by the thermal conversion of PMMA/PAN with sulfur at a high temperature and a 46% mass-loading of sulfur. The fibrous morphology with cylindrical macropores helped to form electronic conduction networks in the cathode, providing directed diffusion pathways for ions. As compared to particulate SPAN (400 mA h g−1 at 2C), the fibrous SPAN composite exhibited a better rate capability (800 mA h g−1 at 2C), and a good capacity retention of >800 mA h g−1 at 0.5C was observed after 1200 cycles. Konarov et al.174 prepared a dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile–sulfur (S/DPAN) composite attached to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (S/DPAN/rGO) for use in Li–S batteries. The S/DSPAN composite was attached to rGO through a self-assembly method. The attachment of reduced graphene oxide helped to improve the conductivity to ∼10−4 S cm−1 (from ∼10−12 S cm−1) and improve electrochemical performance. The S/DPAN/rGO composite exhibited a capacity of 1490 mA h gS−1 in the second cycle, whereas the S/DPAN composite produced only 1000 mA h gS−1. Capacity retentions of 92% and 94% for the S/DPAN/rGO and S/DPAN composites, respectively, were achieved after 100 cycles, which is ascribable to C–S bonds present in the S/DPAN composite even after extensive cycling. Guo et al. provided experimental evidence that soluble LiPS reacts with PAN/DMF solution to form a gel-like structure that is cross-linked by Li2S.175 Due to the uniform dispersion of Li2S in the carbon and the trapping of the high-order Li polysulfide, the composite materials prepared by this strategy show high electrochemical performance. Recently, our group proposed a novel cell design that included a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) binder for improved integrity of the composite electrode, and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an electrolyte additive that stabilized the surface of the lithium metal.176 A sulfurized PAN electrode was synthesized by the mixer milling of PAN and sulfur at 350 °C, followed by carbonization at 600 °C. By applying this strategy, the resulting battery delivered an initial specific capacity of 1500 mA h g−1 and a 98.5% cycling stability after 100 cycles at 0.5C with a sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm−2. In order to examine the viability of Li–S cells prepared using this strategy under more realistic conditions, we assembled pouch cells for further testing. Furthermore, different types of SPAN–C-composite electrodes have been fabricated by many research groups; Table 3 summarizes SPAN-based cathode materials that have recently been used in Li–S batteries.

3. Lithium metal anode: challenges
Li–metal foil is generally used as the anode in a Li–S battery due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 3860 mA h g−1 and its low negative electrochemical potential of −3.040 V. However, some serious problems associated with Li–metal anodes used in Li–S batteries remain; they include: (1) the formation of solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) layers at Li/electrolyte boundaries during electrochemical reactions that are not mechanically robust, leading to continuous formation/dissolution and inefficient Li–S-battery performance. (2) Exothermic reactions between Li metal and non-aqueous flammable electrolyte solvents that create risks of overheating, while the low melting point of Li may cause thermal runaway or battery explosion. (3) The formation of Li dendrites and their detachment from the Li metal can cause losses of active material and coulombic efficiency. (4) Dendritic Li growth can pierce the separator and extend to the cathode, resulting in short circuiting and the risk of explosion.
3.1 S–CPAN-composite cathodes
The Li–metal anodes used in Li–S batteries suffer from huge volume changes, a consequence of the heterogeneous deposition of Li during continuous cycling, which results in changes in surface morphology. The degradation of the Li–metal anode also generates a rough surface and Li-dendrite growth in random directions. Changes in the surface properties of the Li metal cause the formation of dendrites that grow further and can pierce the separator, resulting in a short circuit; this is a serious safety issue for Li–S batteries.
Generally, low sulfur mass loading masks the Li–metal-anode issue. When a high-loaded sulfur cathode is used to generate high energy density, the instability of the Li–metal anode is more pronounced. The interphase growth of Li metal has been demonstrated to be extremely porous, and this condition becomes more severe with increasing current density. Moreover, the interphase grows toward the inside of fresh Li metal and accumulates on the Li–metal anode, which can cause an increase in cell impedance.88,200 Cracks appear and Li-anode corrosion takes place. The formation of a thick interphase due to side reactions between the newly formed porous Li metal, the electrolyte, and the soluble polysulfides lead to the loss of sulfur, an increase in cell impedance, and electrolyte consumption. This is a major drawback and a key challenge that needs to be addressed when improving the energy densities of Li–S battery systems.6
Furthermore, the role of the Li–metal anode is much more important when a Li–S pouch cell is constructed. In such a pouch cell, the high areal mass loading of sulfur generates high current and causes serious polysulfide shuttling, which damages the Li–metal anode. The high current generated in a pouch cell creates an inhomogeneous distribution on the surface of the Li–metal anode, where some specific sites accumulate more current, resulting in the formation of more dendritic Li and electrolyte decomposition.201–204 High areal current also leads to a large Li-ion concentration gradient at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which damages the SEI layer on the Li–metal surface, intensifies dendritic Li growth, and also diminishes the role of the LiNO3 additive.205,206 As this process is repeated, the contact area between the electrolyte and the Li metal increases, which causes further electrolyte consumption, which enhances the viscosity of the electrolyte while increasing Li-ion diffusion resistance and cell polarization.201 Irreversible electrolyte consumption during continuous cycling can also dry the cell, resulting in severe capacity fading. Even if the cell is refilled with electrolyte, the Li–S pouch cell remains inoperative due to the fatal deterioration of the Li–metal anode. In addition, dendritic Li becomes detached from the anode surface and dead Li powder is formed, which reduces reactivity during cycling when side reactions between the electrolyte/Li polysulfide and the Li–metal anode take place.207–210 Various research groups have proposed growth mechanisms for dendrite formation.208,209 Bai et al.208 grew Li dendrites in a glass capillary cell and demonstrated that a change of mechanism, from root-growing mossy Li to tip-growing dendritic Li, occurs at the onset of limited electrolyte diffusion. They also showed that mossy Li is blocked by nanoporous ceramic separators, while dendritic Li can easily penetrate nanopores, resulting in a short circuit. Lopez examined the morphological transition of a Li–metal surface, from flat and smooth into a rough structure.209 This study revealed that three different surface morphologies form during the cycling process, namely a dendritic layer at the top, a porous intermediate layer, and a residual layer. This study also showed that cell failure is related to electrolyte depletion and the production of a porous layer during the reaction of active metallic Li.
Even if SPAN-based cathodes can avoid the shuttle phenomenon and polysulfide dissolution, thereby preventing the loss of active sulfur, the high mass loadings of sulfur in SPAN composites still present problems similar to those encountered in conventional Li–S batteries. The practical application of Li–S batteries requires high sulfur mass loadings that generate high charge–discharge currents, which (again) causes Li–metal degradation. A variety of techniques have been used to resolve the dendrite issue, including electrolyte additives that form stable SEIs on Li–metal surfaces. The formation of an SEI layer can reduce the precipitation of Li2S- and Li2S2-reaction products on the surface of the Li–metal anode and alleviate dendritic growth, thereby enhancing the cycling performance of a Li–S battery. Electrolyte additives such as lithium nitrate (LiNO3),24,28,211,212 phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5),145 lithium iodide (LiI),213 and indium iodide (InI3),214 among others, have recently been used to protect Li–metal anodes and prevent dendritic growth. An anodic protection layer has also been used to cover the Li–metal surface and produce a stable artificial SEI layer. Li nitride (Li3N),87 PEDOT-co-PEG,112 and Al2O3 layers,215 have all recently been used to protect Li anodes.
Electrolyte additives and the formation of an anodic protection layer can reduce Li–metal corrosion from polysulfides and alleviate dendritic growth through the formation of a stable SEI layer, however assembling Li–S batteries using Li–metal anodes is a major challenge for the commercialization of Li–S batteries. Furthermore, future requirements of high-energy-density Li–S batteries require high areal sulfur mass loadings, which enhance the polysulfide concentration in the electrolyte and the current density on the anode surface. Therefore, it is very difficult to commercialize Li–S batteries based on Li–metal anodes for applications in high power and energy equipment. Consequently, the development of Li–metal-free anodes for Li–S batteries is a worthwhile objective.
3.2 Prevention of lithium-dendrite growth
The lithium–metal anode is important for the safe operation of a Li–S battery; therefore, its degradation and dendritic growth, which deteriorate electrochemical performance, need to be prevented. Dendritic lithium growth is suppressed by circumventing lithium dendrite nucleation, which can be inhibited at the root.24,216 Modification of the three-dimensional anode architecture by tuning the surface energy is another way of suppressing dendritic growth.218,227 Surface treatment of the anode circumvents potentially active dendritic-growth sites. Recently, a multi-layered graphene (MLG) coating improved lithium-anode performance due to the separated formation of the SEI layer and the suppression of lithium-dendrite growth.219 A Li3PO4 thin-film coating also suppressed lithium-dendrite growth,220 while a cross-linked polymer, as an interfacial layer, was also employed to suppress lithium-dendrite formation through surface coverage.221 A protective film of Li3N, which is formed through the reaction of lithium and nitrogen gas at room temperature, has also been used to suppress lithium-dendrite formation, while Ma et al.87 showed that a three-dimensional porous anode architecture is another modification that improves Li–S battery performance.222,223 In contrast, the growth of 3D atomic crystals of boron nitride and graphene on copper has been used to hinder lithium–metal dendrite formation. Metallic Ni foam has also been employed to pre-store lithium, which formed a Li–Ni-composite anode and prevented lithium-dendrite growth;224 this three-dimensional architecture provided an abundant electrode/electrolyte interface that lowered current density and enhanced electron transfer and ion diffusion. A novel, mechanically strong, porous separator was also employed to prevent lithium-dendrite formation.217,225,226 Recently, PE separators coated with ZrO2/POSS multilayers, through layer-by-layer techniques, have been used to improve cycle lives. This novel separator reduced electrode polarization and suppressed lithium-dendrite growth, which increased coulombic efficiency.227 Cellulose-based membranes containing nanopores and nanofibers have also been used as separators that inhibit lithium-dendrite formation and improve electrochemical performance.228
4. Electrolytes for Li–S batteries
Apart from the electrode, the electrolyte is another important component in a Li–S battery. The main function of an electrolyte is the transfer of ions between the electrodes, while also facilitating the formation of an SEI layer on the electrode. An organic liquid electrolyte mainly consists of solvents, salts, and some additives. The voltage window in a Li–S battery is less than 3 V, which facilitates the use of organic solvents as electrolytes. Numerous polysulfides are formed during the charging and discharging processes, and these polysulfides can react with organic solvents. Consequently, the available range of solvents for Li–S batteries is very narrow. One approach to improving Li–S battery performance involves the design of effective electrolytes that provide good capacity and cycling stability. Electrolyte species, such as the type of solvent, concentration, nature of the lithium salt, and functional additives, can improve the performance of Li–S batteries. Generally, electrolytes consisting of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([(CF3SO2)2N]Li, LiTFSI) in a solvent mixture of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), containing lithium nitrate (LiNO3) as an additive, have been used. The advantage of TFSI is mainly associated with its highly delocalized negative-charge distribution, which increases the dissociation and solubility of LiTFSI and improves ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the DOL-based solvent forms an SEI layer, which prevents dendritic growth and accommodates electrode volume changes, resulting in good cycling performance. The lithium nitrate additive used in the Li–S battery facilitates SEI-layer formation on the surface of the lithium–metal anode, which stabilizes the lithium metal and suppresses polysulfide redox shuttling, thereby increasing the battery's coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. Recently, Zhang et al.229 demonstrated the catalytic effect of LiNO3 on the conversion of highly soluble polysulfides into slightly soluble sulfur. Different concentrations of the lithium nitrate additive have been used to enhance battery performance.230–233 Furthermore, the low solubilities of lithium polysulfides in fluorinated electrolytes, which limit parasitic reactions of lithium and alleviate self-discharge, have seen these electrolytes recently used in Li–S batteries. The use of the LiNO3 additive in a fluorinated electrolyte also suppresses self-discharge owing to the formation of SEI layers on the lithium anode and the sulfur cathode. The synergistic effect between the additive and the fluorinated electrolyte prevents redox shuttling, thereby improving the coulombic efficiency of the Li–S battery.234–236
Organo-fluorine compounds, such as 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE), have been applied as electrolyte solvents in Li–S batteries, leading to reduced shuttling, and improved cycling stability and coulombic efficiency. The SEI was formed through the participation of TTE in redox reactions on both electrodes, which inhibited parasitic reactions and resulted in the better use of electrode materials.234 A fluorinated-electrolyte mixture composed of TTE and LiNO3, as the additive, was used by Azimi et al.;236 this electrolyte combination exhibited good electrochemical performance with no self-discharges observed after long hours of rest at elevated temperatures. A fluorinated bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-ether-containing (BTFE-containing) electrolyte also alleviated self-discharge at elevated temperatures, at both low and high sulfur loadings, due to the formation of a vigorous protective film on the anode.235 Recently, Gao et al.237 demonstrated a Li–S battery containing a porous carbon/S-composite electrode and a symmetrical fluorinated diethoxyethane electrolyte. The electrolyte solvent, composed of a mixture of 1,2-bis(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy)ethane (TFEE) and DOL suppressed polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, resulting in a capacity retention of 99.5% per cycle over 100 cycles. Talian et al.238 compared Li–S battery performance using a tetraglyme electrolyte with that using a TFEE-based electrolyte at low electrolyte loading. Polysulfide solubility was lower in the TFEE-based electrolyte owing to the different Li+-solvation mode. 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether (HFE), 1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl ethyl ether (HEE), and ethyl 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl ether (ETE) have also been used in Li–S batteries.239 Apart from fluorinated electrolytes, the development of highly concentrated electrolytes for use in Li–S batteries has also been studied. The salt concentration in a liquid electrolyte is usually less than 1.2 mol L−1. Recently, Suo et al. introduced a high-concentration electrolyte, referred to as a “solvent-in-salt” electrolyte, which exhibited a high lithium-ion transference number (0.73) in a Li–S battery. This electrolyte synergistically enhanced cycling performance and safety by inhibiting dendritic lithium growth. In addition, the inhibition of lithium polysulfide dissolution further enhanced the cycling performance and coulombic efficiency of the Li–S battery.240
5. Li–S full cells
In this section, we highlight current Li–S full-cell configurations with Li–metal-free anodes such as carbon, silicon (Si), and tin (Sn), in combination with elemental sulfur, Li2S, or SPAN-composite cathodes, in order to overcome safety issues and enhance the electrochemical performance of the battery.
5.1 Li–S full cells: S/C-composite cathodes
Safety is the main reason for replacing high theoretical-capacity Li–metal anodes in Li–S batteries. A variety of carbonaceous materials that have been used as anode materials in LIBs, due to their low lithiation voltages, small volume changes, high coulombic efficiencies, and long cycle lives, are good candidates as Li–S-battery anodes. High capacity Si- and Sn-alloy electrodes are superior for use as high-energy-density Li–S-battery anodes; however, they undergo huge volume expansions during cycling, which damages the electrode structure and thickens the SEI layer on the anode, resulting in impeded performance. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been directed toward achieving high-energy-density and long-cycling-life Li–S full cells that are also very safe. Li–S full cells that are based on sulfur cathodes and Li–metal-free anodes are summarized in Table 4.

Recently, Xu et al.241 studied electrochemically pre-lithiated graphite anodes for the preparation of a Li–S full cell with a MWCNT–S cathode; such a full cell exhibited a charge capacity of 1113 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, with a specific energy of 485 W h kg−1. Zeng et al. reported Li–S full-cell performance using a pre-lithiated graphite anode and a sulfur–carbon-composite cathode in a super-concentrated ether electrolyte; this full cell delivered a capacity of 686 mA h gsulfur−1 at 0.1C after 105 cycles.252 The sulfur–carbon-composite cathode was prepared by melt diffusion 155 °C. Graphite was pre-lithiated by electrochemical cycling in an electrolyte. Agostini et al.244 fabricated a Li–S full cell using a graphite anode, a S/C-composite cathode, and a DOL–DME–LiTFSI electrolyte, with LiNO3 and Li2S8 as additives. Li2S8 suppresses the dissolution of sulfur and LiNO3 reduces polysulfide shuttling. This full cell exhibited a stable capacity of 500 mA h g−1 and operated at about 2 V. To improve the performance of Li–S full cells with graphite-based anodes, polyacrylic acid sodium salt (PAA-Na) was applied to the anode as a protective binder, which impedes graphite exfoliation and acts as a protective layer with better surface coverage at the electrode–electrolyte interface. Therefore, the cell prepared with the PAA-Na binder provided improved cycling performance and coulombic efficiency (99%) when compared to the cell with the poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder (>95%).253 Brückner et al.37 demonstrated improved wettability of the cathode by optimizing the carbon nanotube/PTFE ratio. Hard carbon, with a small amount of MWCNT pasted on a carbon-fiber network, was used as the anode in a full cell Li–S battery. a-Si on a carbon-fiber anode was prepared by the DC-magnetron sputtering of p-doped silicon onto carbon fiber. The anode was combined with a hollow carbon-sphere/MWCNT–S composite with 53% sulfur content and delivered a capacity of 1470 mA h g(sulfur)−1 (720 mA h gcathode−1) in a minimal amount of electrolyte. Recently, Chen et al.242 demonstrated a Li–S full cell composed of a pre-lithiated graphite anode and a sulfur cathode in a multifunctional fluorinated ether-based (BTFE-based) electrolyte (1.0 M LiTFSI in DOL/BTFE (1:1, v/v)). The cathode was prepared by the thermal treatment of elemental sulfur and a commercial Ketjenblack mixture at 159 °C. Such an electrolyte has low viscosity and good wettability, which improves reaction kinetics and leads to high sulfur usage; it also diminishes polysulfide solubility and impedes polysulfide shuttling, thereby improving the cyclability of the electrode. In addition, it facilitates the formation of a stable SEI on the graphite anode, leading to improved cyclability of the anode. A discharge capacity of 950 mA h g−1 (3 mA h cm−2) in the second cycle, with >95% coulombic efficiency and a capacity retention of >65% after 450 cycles, were obtained. A hierarchal porous carbide-derived carbon (DUT-107), which has a high surface area and pore volume, was used as a scaffold for sulfur impregnation. A Li–S full cell was assembled using DUT-107-S as the cathode and pre-lithiated hard carbon on carbon paper (LIHC@GDL) as the anode.243 DUT-107 was prepared by a template-assisted method, in which a silica template was infiltrated with polycarbosilane, after which it was pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere and then chemically etched. Fig. 5a shows a SEM image of the DUT-107/S composite, while Fig. 5b displays the cycling performance of the full cell in an electrolyte containing 1 M LiTFSI and 0.25 M LiNO3 (E/S = 12 μL mg−1), which delivered a final specific capacity of 422 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. This result corresponds to an overall capacity decay of only 48.1%, or 0.0118% per cycle (over 4076 cycles), relative to the capacity at the 24th cycle. To further verify stable capacity by electrolyte pre-saturation, a full cell with a PS-additive electrolyte (0.8 M LiTFSI + 0.25 M LiNO3 + 0.15 M Li2S6, E/S = 12 μL mg−1) was also prepared; this full cell delivered a specific capacity of 1134 mA h g−1 over the first 24 cycles and 554 mA h g−1 after 4100 cycles at 0.1C. Even though ultralong cycling performance can be obtained, the low capacities of Li–S full cells using these carbon anodes is the main drawback to their use in high-energy-density applications.

In addition to carbonaceous anode materials for Li–S full-cell batteries, Sn is another very promising anode material, due to its high theoretical capacity and ability to form different Li–Sn intermetallics, including Li22Sn5, Li7Sn2, Li3Sn, Li5Sn, LiSn, and Li2Sn5. Pairing the high capacity of a Sn anode with a sulfur cathode enhances the overall capacity and energy density of a Li–S full-cell battery. In this section, we shed some light on Li–S full cells based on tin- or tin-oxide-anode materials paired with sulfur cathodes that have recently been published. Mohan et al.250 studied a Li–S full cell composed of a 3D porous Sn/G/rGO composite as the anode and S/C as the cathode. The anode was fabricated by a method involving electroplating and drop casting onto a carbon-paper substrate. The advantage of pristine graphene in the anode is enhanced electron conduction, while the addition of rGO sheets protects the surface of the electrode from direct contact with the electrolyte and minimizes SEI formation. A Li–S full cell (Sn/G/rGO–S) devoid of anode or cathode lithiation was constructed with a thin piece of Li–metal foil on the anode side. The mass loadings of the Li–metal foil, anode, and cathode were 2, 4.8, and 1.6 mg cm−2, respectively. The fabricated cell delivered a specific capacity of 413 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 90%. It operated at 1.6 V and delivered specific energies of 660 W h kg−1, 336 W h kg−1, and 146 W h kg−1 based on the mass of sulfur, the total mass of the cathode (S/C), and the total mass of both electrodes, respectively. Moreno et al.251 also demonstrated the fabrication of a Li–S full cell consisting of a lithiated nanostructured tin–carbon anode (Li4Sn–C) and an activated mesoporous carbon–sulfur cathode (AOMC–S) in an electrolyte composed of 1 M LiTFSI and 0.4 M LiNO3 in DME/DOL (1:1, v/v). AOMC was synthesized by sol–gel polymerization and high-temperature carbonization followed by CO2 activation. The S–carbon composite was formed by in situ sulfur deposition from an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate acidified with hydrochloric acid. The full cell operated at 1.7 V and delivered a specific capacity of 600 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency, and a practical energy density of 280 W h kg−1.
A SnO2 anode was also paired with a sulfur cathode to prepare a Li–S full cell. SnO2 has advantages over Sn as an anode material due to its conversion and alloying mechanism, its ability to be reduced to Sn, and the formation of a Li2O scaffold that buffers the volumetric changes experienced by Sn during Li-ion insertion/extraction. Liu et al.35 reported a Li–S polymer battery composed of a lithiated SnO2 anode, a CMK-3-S cathode, and a bifunctional gel-polymer electrolyte (GPE). A SnO2/LE/S full cell was first constructed with an ether-based electrolyte, graphene as the conducting agent, and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as the binder. The formation of a passivation layer and polysulfide dissolution restricted the ability to achieve high capacity and long-term cycling. The GPE-based full cell exhibited enhanced capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability, due to the prevention of polysulfide dissolution in the electrolyte. The surfaces of the SnO2 anodes were examined by XPS following disassembly of the SnO2/LE/S and SnO2/GPE/S cells after cycling. Fig. 5c reveals two peaks in the S 2p spectrum, at 165.9 and 162.1 eV, which are assigned to sulfur signals from Li2S–SO3 and sulfide (Li2S) deposited on the surface of the anodic SEI. The sulfur signals from the SnO2/LE/S cell show clearly stronger peak densities, indicating that the side deposition of sulfur species is much more severe than in this cell that in the SnO2/GPE/S cell. This explains why the SnO2/GPE/S cell delivered a specific capacity of 755.7 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.3C after 300 cycles with a capacity retention of 83.3%, whereas the SnO2/LE/S cell retained only 49.1% (Fig. 5d). In addition, the SnO2/GPE/S cell exhibited superior rate capability (608.2 mA h g−1 at 5C) and good cycle retention at 1C (82.1% after 500 cycles).
Silicon electrodes have been widely studied due to their high theoretical capacities (4200 mA h g−1), low discharge potentials (∼0.2 V vs. Li/Li+), the abundance of Si in the Earth's crust, and its environmentally friendly nature. The combination of a Si anode and a S cathode, in a full cell, can theoretically provide a seven-fold increase in specific capacity compared to a graphite–LiMO2 system. Si anodes perform well in carbonate-based electrolytes; however, the S cathode performs very poorly in these electrolytes due to side reactions between polysulfides and the electrolyte, which causes abrupt fade in capacity. Si–S full cells also exhibit poor electrochemical performance even in ether-based electrolytes. The failure mechanism for Si–S full cells has been described by Shen et al.179 During the cycling process, Si becomes lithiated because it has a lower potential than a polysulfide. The reaction between lithiated Si (LixSi) and a polysulfide results in the transfer of Li ions from LixSi to the polysulfide, which leads to capacity fading during cycling. One strategy that protects the Si anode from this polysulfide reaction involves coating the surface of the Si anode with a fluoropolymer-copolymer based on Nafion. The negatively charged sulfonate groups electrostatically repel the negatively charged anions. A Si–S full cell composed of a Nafion-coated lithiated porous Si anode and a S cathode delivered a specific capacity of 330 mA h g−1 and an energy density of 590 W h kg−1 based on the total mass of S and Si after 100 cycles. Krause and co-workers fabricated Si nanowires on a 3D carbon-mesh current collector and used them as anode materials.248 This anode was coupled to a C/S cathode to fabricate a Li–S full cell in an ether- and Li-triflate-based electrolyte; such a full cell delivered an areal capacity of 2.3 mA h cm−2, a cyclability that surpassed 450 cycles, and a capacity retention of 80% after 150 cycles (capacity loss < 0.4% per cycle). The low degradation during cycling is ascribable to a lower level of polysulfide self-reduction, as determined by in-operando X-ray diffraction. Hassoun et al. reported a Li–metal-free full cell composed of a sulfur–carbon-composite cathode formed by hard carbon spherules, a lithiated silicon–carbon-nanocomposite anode, and a glycol-based electrolyte. The battery delivered an average specific capacity of 300 mA h gS−1 when operated at 2 V, and exhibited a long cycle life and high safety.256 A room-temperature ionic-liquid electrolyte (N-methyl-N-allylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (RTIL P1A3TFSI)) was also used in a Li–S full-cell battery system (pre-lithiated Si/C microspheres as the anode and a S/C composite as the cathode).27 This cell delivered a high specific discharge capacity of 926.4 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, which remained as high as 670 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Weinberger et al.249 demonstrated a Li–S full cell that consisted of a Si-nanoparticle anode and a carbon–sulfur cathode. Si nanoparticles were prepared by ball milling and the anode was prepared by mixing carbon black, Si nanoparticles, and aqueous lithiated polyacrylic acid. The cathode was a carbon/sulfur composite prepared by the melt impregnation of sulfur into activated charcoal. The full-cell configuration exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 400–500 mA h g−1, based on the mass of the cathode, and was stable up to 50 cycles. They further demonstrated a pouch-cell configuration with an effective electrode area of 24 cm2, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 45 mA h at a current density of 20 mA g−1. A full cell that employed a honeycomb-like sulfur copolymer on 3D graphene (3D cpS-G) as the cathode (with a sulfur mass loading of 5 mg cm−2) and a 3D lithiated Si–G network as the anode (with a Si mass loading of 3.9 mg cm−2) was fabricated.254 A three-dimensional lithiated Si/graphene anode with ultrathin nanowalls was fabricated by a template-assisted method; this anode exhibited good electrical conductivity and accommodated a large Si-volume change during prolonged cycling. As shown in Fig. 5e, the sulfur copolymer was attached to a honeycomb-like three-dimensional graphene network with multi-sized pores as a cathode material, in order to facilitate the fast diffusion of electrons and Li ions; this structure also efficiently trapped polysulfides with strong covalent bonds, and accommodated large volume changes during lithiation/delithiation processes. The cycling performance of this lithiated Si–S cell is shown in Fig. 5f; the capacity remained at 578 mA h g−1, even after 500 cycles at 0.27 A g−1, and demonstrated very low capacity decay (86% capacity was maintained after 500 cycles). Zhou et al.245 fabricated a Si–S full cell with an optimized solid-like electrolyte (OSE). The OSE was prepared by the organic-template method. The Si@graphite anode was prepared by mixing Si@graphite powder, carbon black, and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) binder in DI water, followed by coating onto Cu foil. The S-CMK-3 cathode was prepared by the melt-diffusion method. The electrolyte consisted of two functional components: a hollow SiO2-nanosphere layer and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in an ether-based solvent. The hollow SiO2 layer prevented the diffusion of polysulfides while the FEC additive reduced the anode/electrolyte interface resistance through the formation of a thin, dense SEI. The assembled Si–S full cell, which was composed of S@CMK-3 mesoporous carbon (as the cathode) and Si@graphite (as the anode) in OSE (S@CMK-3/OSE/Si@graphite cell), delivered a high reversible capacity of 824.2 mA h g−1 (with a capacity retention of 76.7%) after 200 cycles at 0.3C. In contrast, a S@CMK-3/liquid-electrolyte/Si@graphite cell only exhibited a specific capacity of 361.6 mA h g−1 and a cycling retention of 46.2%. In addition, the rate performance of the S@CMK-3/OSE/Si@graphite cell was far superior to that of the S@CMK-3/liquid-electrolyte/Si@graphite cell in all current ranges examined. Moreover, the OSE-based cell has the advantage of high safety, which is attributed to its low flammability through the elimination of Li metal.
In Sun's group, Si–SiOx-nanosphere materials were prepared by the pyrolysis of hydrogen silsesquioxane nanospheres that were obtained by the sol–gel reaction of triethoxysilane, and a Li–S full cell was constructed by employing this lithiated Si–SiOx-nanosphere anode with a dual-type sulfur cathode, composed of a solid sulfur electrode and a polysulfide catholyte.246 Such a Li–S full cell displayed good electrochemical performance, with an estimated energy density of 497 W h kg−1 at a rate of 1C based on the weight of the electrode materials. The energy density of this full cell was more than twice that of a commercially available LIB. More importantly, Fig. 6a reveals that the full cell maintained about 85.5% of its specific capacity over 500 cycles with cycling efficiencies in excess of 98.2%, except for the first cycle (86%), indicating that the cycle life of this full cell was almost that of a commercial LIB. The better cycling performance of the cell arises from both the newly designed anode, as well as the dual-type sulfur cathode used in this work. Cross-sectional images of the Si/SiOx electrode show that it was about 4 μm thicker following pre-lithiation (Fig. 6b and c), due to Si/SiOx-nanosphere expansion. The dimensional stability of the lithiated Si/SiOx electrode was also investigated by observing thickness changes in the electrode after cycling. Fig. 6c and d reveal that the lithiated Si/SiOx electrode retained almost its original thickness, even after 20 cycles, and exhibited no cracking. These results clearly demonstrate that the nanoscale engineering of Si, and the use of amorphous SiOx as the matrix, effectively mitigated the mechanical strain induced by the huge volume changes experienced by Si during cycling. The strains and stresses induced by periodic volume changes are very significant and potentially detrimental because the total active material per unit geometrical area increases with increasing Si/SiOx areal loading; therefore a relative low loading of 1 mg cm−2 was applied in this study. To further accelerate the practical application of Li–S full cells, we concentrated on the challenges of upscaling Li–S battery prototypes from small laboratory coin cells to much larger pouch cells containing C-coated Si/SiOx anodes with an increased loading of 4.3 mg cm−2.255Fig. 6e displays the cycling performance of these pouch cells using a Li–metal anode (average sulfur loading of 2.8 mg cm−2) at a rate of 0.5C between 1.8 and 2.7 V over 60 cycles. The pouch cells delivered high discharge capacities of around 1170 mA h g−1 during initial cycling, and were stable up to the 40th cycle. However, the cell showed dramatic capacity fading (capacity decay rate of 1.4% per cycle) beyond the 40th cycle.

Fig. 6f also reveals that these pouch cells suffer from fast capacity fading at high rates, which is mainly due to the morphological failures of their Li anodes, which is not as pronounced in small coin cells. The Li–S pouch cell with a Si/SiOx anode (Si–Li–S cell) delivered an initial capacity of around 800 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of sulfur) at a rate of 0.5C. As seen in Fig. 6g, the cell capacity decreased to around 500 mA h g−1 during initial cycling, and then exhibited stable capacity retention during hundreds of cycles (62.7% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles), with coulombic efficiencies higher than 99.5% during prolonged cycling. This study demonstrated that the use of highly loaded pre-lithiated C-coated Si/SiOx anodes that do not suffer from dendritic Li growth, can be upscaled to Li–S pouch cells with long cycling lives; we encourage further research in the upscaling of battery prototypes after initial studies on the small scale, in order to understand real and important bottlenecks involved in the commercialization of battery technology.
5.2 Li–S full cells: Li2S/C-composite cathodes
Li2S is introduced into Li–S-battery systems as a cathode material can easily be paired with Li–metal-free anodes to avoid the safety issues. In this section, we focus on Li–S full-cell batteries fabricated with carbon-, Si-, and Sn-based electrodes paired with Li2S-based cathodes; Table 5 summarizes such Li–S full cells.

Li et al.257 reported a Li–S full cell constructed with a graphite anode and a Li2S cathode (mass loading of 2.2 mg cm−2) in a solvate ionic-liquid electrolyte ([Li(G4)1]-[TFSA]/HFE). A schematic diagram depicting the charging process in such a Li2S–graphite full cell is shown in Fig. 7a. The CV trace (Fig. 7b) displays an initial oxidation peak at 1.9 V, which corresponds to Li extraction from Li2S. The peaks at 2.8 and 3.5 V correspond to different electrochemical-activation processes. A peak at 2.4 V, corresponding to Li2S oxidation, appeared in subsequent scans, while the two peaks at 2.1 and 1.9 V correspond to the stepwise reduction of sulfur. The composition of the electrolyte ([Li(G4)x][TFSA]/HFE, x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1) was further optimized by varying the G4-to-LiTFSA molar ratio. Cells containing [Li(G4)1][TFSA]/HFE, [Li(G4)0.8][TFSA]/HFE, and [Li(G4)0.6][TFSA]/HFE electrolytes delivered specific capacities of 343, 410, and 231 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a 1/12C rate. The improved electrochemical performance of the [Li(G4)0.8][TFSA]/HFE-based electrolyte is attributed mainly to balanced ionic conductivity and the Li+ intercalation/deintercalation properties of the electrolytes. Wang et al.258 developed a Li–S full-cell battery with graphite as the anode, a Li2S@porous-carbon (Li2S@PC) composite as the cathode, and DOL/DME with LiNO3 as the electrolyte. The Li2S@PC composite was prepared by reacting Li2SO4 and pyrolytic carbon from sucrose. Li2S nanoparticles were uniformly distributed into the porous-carbon matrix, which was capable of trapping dissolved polysulfide. The process for the synthesis of the Li2S@PC composite is schematically depicted in Fig. 7c. The cycling performance and charge–discharge profile of the full cell is shown in Fig. 7d, which reveals voltage plateaus at 1.9 V. The full cell delivered a specific discharge capacity of 268 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 30 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 82%, and 173 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 100 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 95%. Tan et al.148 reported a Li2S cathode with Li2S nanoparticles enclosed by few-layer graphene sheets (Li2S@graphene nanocapsules) (Fig. 7e). The cathode, with a high Li2S mass loading (10 mg cm−2), in a half-cell configuration, delivered a reversible capacity of 1160 mA h g(Sulfur)−1 and an aerial capacity of 8.1 mA h cm−2. Fig. 7f displays the cycling performance of the full cell assembled using this Li2S@graphene-nanocapsule cathode and a graphite anode. The full cell delivered an initial specific charge capacity of 1600 mA h g−1 and a discharge capacity of 730 mA h g−1 when it was charged and discharged between 3.5 and 1.4 V. After the first cycle, the cell delivered 90% coulombic efficiency with cycling stability, retaining a specific capacity of 440 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 160 mA g−1 with a Li2S mass loading of 2 mg cm−2.

Hassoun and Scrosati et al.259 first introduced the Sn–Li polysulfide polymer Li–S battery, which consists of a Sn/C anode, a Li2S/C cathode, and a gel-polymer electrolyte (GPE). The electrolyte was composed of an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate solution of Li hexafluorophosphate (EC:DMC LiPF6) saturated with Li2S in a polyethylene oxide/Li trifluoromethanesulfonate (PEO/LiCF3SO3) polymer matrix. The polymer electrolyte has several advantages, including the prevention of Li polysulfide dissolution and the avoidance of capacity loss. The use of a Sn/C-composite anode, with a nanostructured morphology of Sn particles confined in an amorphous carbon matrix, circumvented the volume changes associated with nanometric Sn, which helped to achieve high energy densities. The test cell was operated at 60 °C and no polysulfide dissolution was observed. The conversion reaction of Li polysulfide is as follows: 2.2Li2S/C → 2.2S + C + 4.4Li+ + 4.4e−(10)
In addition, the Li ion reacts with the tin/carbon composite to forms alloys, as shown in the following equation: 4.4Li+ + Sn/C +4.4e− → Li4.4Sn + C(11)
The cell delivered an initial specific capacity of 600 mA h g−1 at a C/20 rate and was cycled 33 times. Hassoun260 also reported a Sn–C/Li2S polymer battery that operated at about 2 V and exhibited specific capacities of 600 mA h g−1 and 1200 mA h g−1 based on the Li2S–C and Li2S masses, respectively. The cell delivered a total energy density of 1200 W h kg−1 and was cycled 110 times. In situ XRD of the cell revealed that Li2S is converted into sulfur during the charging process, while the sulfur is converted back to sulfide during the discharging process. Liu et al.38 developed a Li–S full cell equipped with a SnO2 anode, a Li2S cathode, and a LiTFSI-based electrolyte with a bifunctional electrolyte additive (indium triiodide (InI3)), which not only acted as a redox mediator to activate the Li2S cathode, but also formed an in situ passivation layer that protected the anode from polysulfide corrosion. Li2S nanoparticles were incorporated into commercial wipe-derived carbon, as the cathode host, by an infiltration method (Fig. 7g). The SnO2/Li2S cell delivered a stable specific capacity of 647 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 200 cycles, which corresponds to an energy density of 352 W h kg−1 based on the mass of the entire material (Fig. 7h). The non-uniformity of each unit cell in a practical battery pack results in the overcharging or overdischarging of certain cells in some cases, which is a common issue under real working conditions. The cycle life and capacity of a battery are shortened by overcharging or overdischarging in some cases, especially for a lithium-based battery. Therefore, a comparative study of SnO2/Li2S full cells and Li/Li2S half-cells under abusive test conditions (overcharging and overdischarging) was also conducted. After such testing, the cycling time dropped to only 1.47 h for the Li/Li2S cell, which represents a large capacity loss, whereas a steady cycling time (2.8–2.9 h) was maintained by the SnO2/Li2S full cell. These results demonstrate the fragile responses of traditional Li–S batteries to overcharging and overdischarging, while establishing the advantages of combining a Li–metal-free anode and a Li2S cathode.
Balach et al.158 prepared a Li–S full cell composed of a Mo/Li2S cathode and a nanostructured Si anode in a carbonate-based electrolyte. Li2S nanoparticles were synthesized by the electrochemical decomposition of MoS2 at a low potential. The advantages of the Mo/Li2S cathode include the avoidance of soluble polysulfides and the ability to operate in carbonate-based electrolytes. A Si@C–Li2S full cell, with a Li2S mass loading of 10.7 mg cm−2, delivered an initial discharge capacity of 780 mA h g−1 and areal capacity of 7.5 mA h cm−2, based on the mass of sulfur. A reversible capacity of 410 mA h g−1 was retained at a current density of 250 mA g−1 after 150 cycles, with a degradation rate of 0.32% per cycle. The advantages of using nanosized Li2S over microsized Li2S include its higher specific capacity, cycling stability, and capacity retention. Furthermore, the cell was operated in a carbonate-based electrolyte without any additive and in the absence of polysulfide shuttling, which is ascribable to the formation of a stable polymer gel-like SEI layer. Such an SEI layer protects against the loss of active materials, while allowing Li-ion permeation. In addition, Yang et al.262 demonstrated a Li–metal-free Li–S full cell consisting of a Si-nanowire anode and a Li2S/mesoporous-carbon-composite cathode with a theoretical specific energy of 1550 W h kg−1. The mesoporous carbon composite was prepared by the infiltration of resorcinol-formaldehyde into the pores between close-packed nanospheres at 85 °C, followed by carbonization. The silicon nanowires were directly synthesized on a stainless-steel substrate by a vapor–liquid–solid method. An initial specific discharge energy of 630 W h kg−1 was obtained. They constructed a Li–S full cell based on the combination of a high-capacity Si–O–C anode and a high-rate Li2S–MCMB (mesophase-carbon-microbead) composite in a tetraglyme electrolyte.140 The Li2S–MCMB cathode was prepared by high-energy ball milling. A 500–650 nm-thick thin film containing silicon (content: ∼60%), oxygen, and carbon, was prepared through an electrodeposition method and used as the anode, as shown in Fig. 7i. Fig. 7j reveals that this full cell delivered a stable capacity of 280 mA h gLi2S−1 for over 50 cycles, which corresponds to an energy density of the order of 390 W h kg−1.
5.3 Li–S full cells: S/PAN-composite cathodes
In this section, we focus on the merits of a Li–S full cell composed of a sulfurized-polymer cathode coupled with a Li–metal-free anode. Sulfur-based cathodes are chemically incompatible with carbonate-based electrolytes, which severely reduces Li–S-battery performance in a carbonate-based electrolyte. Carbonate-based electrolytes react with Li polysulfides by nucleophilic addition or substitution reactions, resulting in the loss of active sulfur material and, consequently, capacity fading of the battery. However, polysulfides have very low solubilities in carbonate-based electrolytes; hence the shuttle effect can be avoided. SPAN-polymer-cathode materials are compatible with carbonate-based electrolytes; they exhibit high specific capacities, good conductivities, and good cycling stabilities. Shi et al.263 demonstrated a Li–S full-cell battery consisting of a pre-lithiated SiOx/C anode and a S@pPAN cathode in a carbonate-based electrolyte. The charge and discharge processes are schematically illustrated in Fig. 8a. The TEM image of a S@pPAN composite is shown in Fig. 8b, which reveals that the S@pPAN has a regular nanospherical morphology with an average diameter of about 200 nm. The S@pPAN particles are also seen to agglomerate to some extent, which is probably due to interconnecting sulfurized polyacrylonitrile molecular chains that form larger particles during heating. The full cell delivered a highly reversible capacity of 616 mA h g−1 and relatively good cycling stability, with a capacity retention of about 84% after 100 cycles, compared to the 2nd cycle (Fig. 8c). Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of this cell remained at almost 100% during cycling. The energy density of this full cell is estimated to be about 661 W h kg−1 (based on the active materials on the cathode and anode) after 100 cycles, which is more than twice that of a commercial LIB. Similar to S/CPAN chemistry, the sulfur/lithium-ion battery has been constructed by employing a lithium/Sn–C composite anode, a carbyne polysulfide cathode, and a carbonic ester electrolyte solution.261 This full cell exhibited a reversible capacity of 500 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles, with a specific energy of 410 W h kg−1; carbyne polysulfide possesses a higher electrical conductivity than elemental sulfur. The half-cell configuration with a carbyne polysulfide cathode delivered a specific capacity of 520 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 50 cycles, with a capacity retention of 96%. The carbyne polysulfide electrode has a unique discharge profile, exhibiting only one discharge voltage plateau at 1.8 V; it also reacts with Li+ ions to form Li2S2 and Li2S without polysulfide dissolution.

6. All-solid-state Li–S batteries
Solid-polymer electrolytes (SPEs), with and without filler, have been reported by various groups.267–270 In order to enhance conductivity, nanosized inorganic fillers have been used to balance charge-carrier mobility, which are attributed to interactions between the surface groups of the filler and the PEO oxygen atoms.268 Recently, Li–S batteries containing SPEs, with nanosized ZrO2 (10 wt%) as the electrolyte additive, have been reported by Hassoun et al.271 these batteries exhibited enhanced ionic conductivities and lithium-ion transference numbers. An all solid-state lithium–sulfur battery (ASSLSB) composed of an S/C-composite cathode, ZrO2, and a Li2S-doped LiTf-PEO CPE, delivered a specific capacity of 900 mA h g−1 with a cycling efficiency of 100% up to 50 cycles.
Liang et al. reported the use of an all-solid-state PEO18Li(CF3SO2)2N–10 wt%–SiO2 electrolyte in a Li–S battery composed of mesoporous carbon spheres.272 The cell delivered a reversible discharge capacity of 800 mA h g−1 after 25 cycles. Apart from solid-polymer electrolytes in ASSLSBs, various research groups have developed highly conductive glassy solid-state electrolytes for use in Li–S batteries. Numerous inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs), such as Li2S–P2S5 glass ceramics,152,264,266,273,274 Li2S–SiS2 glass,275,276 and thio-LISICONs (lithium superionic conductors) in Li4GeS4–Li3PS4 systems,277 with high Li+-ion conductivities of over 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, have been reported for use in all-solid-state Li/S batteries. Further improvements in lithium-ion conductivity, to values in excess of 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, have been reported with SEs such as Li7P3S11,278 Li2S–P2S5–LiI,279 Li2S–P2S5–LiBH4,280 and Li2S–GeS2–P2S5.58 Recently, Nagao et al.152 reported all solid-state cells composed of Li2S–C-composite electrodes and Li2S–P2S5 glass–ceramic SEs. These cells delivered charge capacities of 1000 mA h g−1 at 0.064 mA cm−2 (25 °C). Trevey et al.281 reported a PAN–S-based electrode with a sulfide-based solid electrolyte for use in an all-solid-state battery that delivered a specific capacity of 605 mA h g−1 over 50 cycles. An inorganic solid electrolyte, a-60Li2S·40SiS2, was also employed with a sulfur electrode in an all-solid-state lithium battery.276 When the Li10GeP2S12 SE electrolyte was used, this battery exhibited higher discharge capacities at higher current densities than that using the 75Li2S·25P2S5 glass electrolyte.265 The main limitations of solid-state Li–S batteries are the insufficient amount of sulfur and the use of very small current densities, which limits practical applications. Recently, a high mass loading of electrode materials in an ASSLSB was reported by Nagata et al.282 this battery was composed of a positive composite electrode with a high P/S (number of phosphorus atoms/number of sulfur atoms) ratio and the Li1.5PS3.3 solid electrolyte. The cell delivered an energy density of 500 W h kg−1 at a mass loading of 7.5–9.0 mg cm−2. A high power density at 50% state-of-charge was achieved in an all-solid-state Li/S cell prepared with a positive activated-carbon-based composite electrode. The cell delivered a good reversible capacity of 1600 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1.3 mA cm−2 (1C) and 25 °C.283 However, ASSLSB performance is till far below those required for high-power applications because of their low electrical conductivities at room temperature and complex synthesis processes compared to those of liquid electrolytes. The major problem associated with low conductivity is the impediment to fast C-rate charging and discharging, which restricts the ability to deliver the high energy and power required from all-solid-state Li–S batteries. Apart from these drawbacks, the main benefits of these electrolytes includes low polysulfide solubility and shuttling, fundamental safety owing to a lack of leakage and thermal stability, better lithium–metal-ion stabilities, and the lack of dendrite formation.
7. Conclusions and perspective
In conclusion, we summarized recent progress in Li–S batteries based on three types of cathodes, namely S8, Li2S, and SPAN, which are either paired with Li–metal anodes or Li–metal-free anodes. We emphasize the various kinds of electrolytes used in Li–S batteries and also discuss all-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries that use solid electrolytes. For practical application, high-loading electrodes are a precondition to achieving high energy densities. Hence, we first presented recent developments in high-loading sulfur cathodes based on S8, Li2S, and SPAN. Although numerous approaches have been used to address current cathode issues, problems associated with Li–metal anodes still remain and urgently require solutions in order for Li–S batteries to be applied in practical settings. We summarize and discuss challenges facing Li–metal anodes and the prevention of lithium–metal-dendrite growth in Li–S-battery systems. Finally, we focus on issues related to all-solid-state lithium–sulfur batteries and the current status. We conclude that the use of Li–metal-free anodes for the construction of Li–S full cells is an effective solution that alleviates the issues associated with Li–metal anodes, and summarize and discuss various scenarios for the commercial development of Li–metal-free Li–S full cells.
However, Li–S full-cell research remains at the laboratory scale. In depth understanding is required in order to provide guidance on which electrode designs, electrolytes, separators, and binders lead to batteries that are competitive with state-of-the-art LIBs, and to help tackle high future energy demand. From the viewpoint of Li–S full-cell battery configurations, numerous challenges regarding cycle life and energy density still need to be addressed. These include: (1) the need for a high mass loading of sulfur in sulfur cathodes to enhance energy densities. (2) The need to further optimize a high-loading anode, with high capacity and long cycling life, for use as a Li–metal-free anode. A good three-dimensional Li–metal-composite electrode needs to be designed. Strategies that are beyond those conventionally used, such as high-temperature melting and pre-lithiation by electrochemical methods, need to be investigated. The mass balance between the lithium–metal anode and the sulfur cathode needs to be optimized in order to achieve a high-energy-density Li–S battery, since excess lithium on the anode side reduces the energy density of the entire Li–S battery. (3) The extra weight and volume related to host materials, conducting agents, electrolyte, and binder, among others, need to be minimized in order to improve the overall energy density of the cell. (4) SPAN-based Li–S full cells have only been reported once in the literature; therefore, further research is required in this area. Different types of lithiated and high-conducting anodes should be paired with SPAN cathodes to provide good energy densities and cycle lives. (5) Polysulfide dissolution and the shuttling effect are major issues in Li–S batteries. The replacement of the organic liquid electrolyte with a solid-state electrolyte is therefore an effective solution; consequently, all-solid-state Li–S batteries should be further developed. However, the low C-rate during charging and discharging hinders their practical application; improved highly conducting electrolytes and better charge-transport ions are required. There appear to be no studies into Li–metal/solid-state electrolytes, consequently more research is required. (6) The electrochemical performance of the coin-cell format does not precisely reflect the performance of pouch-cell-type Li–S batteries. Therefore, more research based on the pouch-cell configuration is required for the development of a practical Li–S battery. The all-solid-state Li–S battery is a promising alternative that is safer for practical applications.
