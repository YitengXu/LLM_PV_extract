    , Accepted 5th April 2023First published on 7th April 2023AbstractThis work reports on hybrid hexamethylenediaminium lead halide perovskites. The materials were prepared using wet synthesis and the subsequent precipitation from aqueous solution. Structural and morphological charactarization studies show their high degree of crystallinity and phase purity. The determined perovskites’ structural parameters agree well with the literature reports. The recorded XPS and DRS data allowed for the first schematic representation of the perovskite band structures. The latter match well the results of DFT modeling. It is shown for the first time that the increase in the perovskite bandgaps is solely due to the increase in the anion electronegativity. Namely, as the anion electronegativity increases, the corresponding valence band energy decreases. In contrast, the electronegativity of the anions has no effect on the perovskite conduction band energies. The presented study deepens our understanding of the relationship between the crystal and electronic structures of low-dimensional hybrid halide perovskites.
1. Introduction
An ever-increasing demand for energy experienced by the modern human society has led to intense research in the area of power generation. Due to environmental issues, nowadays, particular focus is on clean and renewable energy sources among which the solar energy being practically unlimited plays a unique role. A number of materials are known to convert solar light into electric power. In this regard, halide perovskites are especially promising due to their inexpensive synthesis and high solar light to electric power conversion efficiency reaching ∼25.2%.1 Their applications, however, extend beyond energy generation and include light-emitting diodes,2–7 lasers,8 and photo- and X-ray detectors.9–11 The research on halide perovskites is not limited to advanced technological applications. These materials demonstrate a range of physico-chemical phenomena which are fundamental for understanding the interaction of photoactive media with electromagnetic radiation.
Halide perovskites comprise all-inorganic and organometal subfamilies and form conventional 3D as well as pseudo 1D and 2D structures. Their valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) are composed of occupied p-orbitals of halide anions and vacant p-orbitals of metal cations, respectively. The successful formation of a hybrid 2D perovskite structure is subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. For instance, the presence of hydrogen bonds between the cation(s) and anion(s) is highly desirable.12 The properties of hybrid 2D perovskites with various organic cations were studied earlier.13–21
Perovskite crystal and electronic structures are closely related. According to earlier reports, in some hybrid perovskites bandgaps decrease as the angles Pb–X–Pb between neighboring PbX6 octahedra increase.14,15 For instance, (DMAPA)PbBr4 (DMAPA = 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine) possessing an average angle Pb–Br–Pb of 163.9° features a bandgap of 2.88 eV, while (DMABA)PbBr4 (DMABA = 4-dimethylaminobutylamine) with an average angle Pb–Br–Pb of 168.6° shows a bandgap of 2.85 eV.13 A large set of hybrid 2D perovskites [NH3–(CH2)n–NH3]MX4 (M = Cd, Mn, Pb, Cu, Pd; X = Cl, Br; n = 1–12) was investigated in ref. 20. Among other issues the work addresses conformational changes in the organic cations and the corresponding phase transitions. It was shown that the diaminobutane cation may occur in one of the three molecular conformations – ttt, ttg, and gtg′, while diaminohexane (M = Pb, Pd) coexists in two different molecular conformations. Unfortunately, the authors offered no link between the perovskite structure and its electronic properties.
Yet another work reports on the structure and properties of low-dimensional hybrid diaminohexane-based lead halogenides.21 Only the iodide crystals were of high enough quality to provide reliable XRD data. The XRD studies showed that this compound is in fact a 2D material whose PbI6 octahedra are separated by diaminohexane layers. Notably, within its structure diaminohexanes occur in ‘extended form,’ i.e. they bind to neighboring inorganic layers through hydrogen bonds between –NH3 groups and iodide anions. The perovskites show a clear correlation between bandgaps (I: Eg = ∼2.726 eV; Br: Eg = ∼3.346 eV; Cl: 3.940 eV) and the type of halogen anion.
2. Experimental techniques and computational methods
2.1. Synthesis
The perovskite synthesis was achieved according to the methodology described elsewhere.21

2.1.1. Materials. 
PbBr2 (98%, Acros Organics), PbI2 (99%, Acros Organics), PbCl2 (99%, Acros Organics), HI (aqueous, 56%, Iodobrom), HBr (aqueous, 40%, Iodobrom), HCl (aqueous, 36%, NevaReaktiv), and hexamethylenediamine (HMDA 99.5%, Acros Organics) were used as received without further purification.


2.1.2. Synthesis of C6H18N2PbBr4. 
PbBr2 (2.00 g; 5.45 mmol) was dissolved in HBr (9 ml). Separately, HMDA (0.63 g; 5.45 mmol) was dissolved in HBr (9 ml). The precipitate formed within a few minutes upon mixing of the solutions was filtered, washed with acetone, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C.


2.1.3. Synthesis of C6H18N2PbI4. 
PbI2 (2.00 g; 4.34 mmol) was dissolved in HI (9 ml). Separately, HMDA (0.50 g; 4.34 mmol) was dissolved in HI (9 ml). The synthesis is similar to that of C6H18N2PbBr4.


2.1.4. Synthesis of C6H18N2PbCl4. 
PbCl2 (2.00 g; 7.19 mmol) was dissolved in HCl (47 ml). Separately, HMDA (0.83 g; 7.19 mmol) was dissolved in HCl (9 ml). Then, the resulting solutions were mixed. The formation of the crystalline precipitate C6H18N2PbCl4 took several days. The product was filtered, washed with acetone, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C.

2.2. Characterization
The powder diffraction data of HDMAPbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I) for Rietveld analysis were collected at room temperature with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE powder diffractometer (Cu-Kα radiation) and a linear VANTEC detector. The step size of 2θ was 0.02° and the counting time was 35.4 s per step. The data were analyzed using TOPAS 4.2.22
The full profile X-ray analysis of HDMAPbCl4 single-crystals was performed using the single-crystal diffractometer “SuperNova” (Agilent Technologies) at 100 K.
The sample morphologies were determined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEI Scios 2, Thermo Scientific). The elemental composition and its distribution were established by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX, Octane Elite, Amitek).
TEM sample characterization was carried out on a JEOL JEM 2100 (Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a resolution of 0.19 nm. The transmission electron microscope is equipped with an Aztech X-Max 100 analytical attachment for energy dispersive analysis.
The elemental surface composition of the perovskites and their valence band positions were determined using an ultra-high vacuum X-ray photoelectron spectrometer Omicron with a half-spherical electrostatic analyzer (with a curvature radius of 125 mm) and irradiation source MgKα (1253.6 eV). The obtained spectra were post-processed using the CASA XPS program.23 The calibration of electron binding energies was performed using the intrinsic standard technique (C1s; 285.0 eV). Complex spectra were represented by superpositions of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions.
The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded in the range of 375–775 nm under ambient conditions using a Cary 5000 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a DRA 2500 external diffuse reflectance accessory. Optical grade BaSO4 powder served as a reference standard.
2.3. Computational approach
The electronic structures of HDMAPbX4 were modeled using a periodic DFT approach. This was accomplished employing the Plane Augmented Wave (PAW) approach24 in conjunction with the PBE25,26 density functional as implemented in the VASP 5.4.4 program.27–30 The P21/c space symmetry of the perovskite crystal lattices determined by XRD was employed. The perovskite unit cells correspond to the chemical formula Pb2X8C12N4H36 (X = Br, I). The chloride unit cell is twice as large. The reason for this is given later in the text. The SCF energy convergence criterion was set to 1.0 × 10−7 eV. The atomic kinetic energy cutoffs were set to their default values. Brillouin Zones (BZ) were sampled over the Monkhorst–Pack grid31 of 7 × 9 × 9 k-points (9 × 9 × 3 k-points for the monocrystalline chloride). Electronic band structures were computed at 181 k-points along the path Γ-A-C-D-D1-E-X-Y-Y1-Z of monoclinic BZ. The optical absorption spectra were computed using the mBJ density functional32,33 and according to the methodology described elsewhere.34 The electronic band structures and density of states were plotted using the Gnuplot 5.2 software package.35 Throughout the study, chemical structures are visualized using the program VESTA.36
3. Results
3.1. XRD and SEM characterization
The crystallinity and phase purity of the perovskites were studied by powder (PXRD) and monocrystalline (MXRD) XRD methods. Fig. 1 compares the experimental and simulated PXRD patterns and shows that the chosen synthesis route allows for the preparation of well-formed crystals of the perovskites. Moreover, no significant phase impurities were detected. The data used here for PXRD simulation were deposited to the Crystallography Open Database earlier.37 All three compounds possess a monoclinic crystal lattice of P21/c symmetry. The corresponding lattice parameters are listed in Table 1. The results of Rietveld refinement are collected in the table as well. As can be seen, the perovskite lattice parameters determined at room temperature (PXRD) are nearly identical to those from the earlier report.21 The same is true for the lattice parameters of bromide and iodide single crystals determined at 77 K. In contrast, the lattice parameters of the monocrystalline HMDAPbCl4 are very different. As Table 1 shows, the unit cell of chloride perovskite prepared in the present work is roughly twice larger than the one available in the literature.20,21 It is worth noting that ref. 21 reports no atomic positions of the chloride perovskite which were unresolved due to ‘twinning’ providing only crystal lattice parameters.

Fig. S1† demonstrates the SEM images of typical microcrystals of HMDAPbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I). As one can see, the microcrystals demonstrate clear morphological anisotropy. The chloride (Fig. S1a†) and iodide (Fig. S1c†) microcrystals are represented by microrods of ∼10 μm size which are elongated along the direction of growth, whereas the bromides (Fig. S1b†) are formed from ∼60 μm long and ∼5–15 μm thick microscales.
3.2. TEM characterization

Fig. 2a–4a show TEM images of the studied perovskites. It can be seen that, in addition to microcrystals, which were registered by SEM, some perovskites are presented in the form of nanoparticles of much smaller sizes from a few to hundreds of nanometers. Obviously, they represent the initial stages of the formation of microcrystals. The three perovskites are characterized by nearly identical interplane distances: 0.39–0.37 nm, 0.35 nm, 0.29–0.28 nm, 0.25–0.23 nm, 0.21–0.2 nm, 0.18 nm, 0.15 nm, and 0.12 nm (Fig. 2b–4b). The high-resolution images (Fig. 2c–4c) illustrate the largest interplane distances.

In the case of iodine perovskites, the corners (indicated in Fig. 4a) formed by the growing nanocrystal faces are clearly visible. Measurements show that the angle between these faces is 106.8 ± 0.3°, which is in good agreement with the unit cell angle β (see Table 1).
3.3. XPS spectra
Elemental XPS spectra of HMDAPbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites are illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. S2.† The narrow lead signals Pb4f7/2 and Pb4f5/2 feature half widths of 1.8 eV (Fig. S2a†). Each of them can be approximated by just one Gaussian function. Energies of Pb4f5/2 signals for HMDAPbCl4, HMDAPbBr4, and HMDAPbI4 equal 139.0 eV, 138.4 eV, and 138.2 eV. The observed drift towards lower binding energies is in accordance with the literature data.38
 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of HMDAPbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I) in the range of characteristic binding energies of N1s for Cl (a), Br (b), and I (c) samples. 
Similar to the lead signals, the carbon C1s (Fig. S2b†) having a maximum at 285 eV can also be approximated using a single Gaussian function. Thereby, neither the position nor the shape of the signal is affected by the halogen atom.
Each Cl2p, Br3d, and I4d halogen signal has two components (Fig. S2c†), corresponding to different electrons in their respective orbitals. Each of these components is simple and well described by a single Gaussian.
In contrast, the nitrogen signal (Fig. 5) is complex and can be approximated by the superposition of three Gaussian functions. Therein, for the signal N1s of the HMDAPbI4 perovskite on the X-axis one can see computed MO energies. Other halogenides demonstrate similar energies. The complex shape of the nitrogen signals is due to chemical shifts. They arise from interactions of the nitrogen atoms with both HMDA (N–C) and halogen (N–I). This is due to the fact that nitrogen atoms participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds –N–H⋯X stabilizing the low-dimensional hybrid perovskite structure.20
To determine the work function (WF), ionization potentials and the secondary electron cut-off (SEC) and VB spectra were utilized (Fig. 6).

The work function (WF) and energy of VB top (EVB) can be computed using the method proposed in ref. 39. The obtained values are listed in Table 2.

3.4. Diffuse reflectance spectra
The diffuse reflectance spectra of HMDAPbX4 are demonstrated in Fig. 7a. It shows an increasing drift of the edge of intrinsic absorbance towards shorter wavelengths in the sequence Cl–Br–I. That is HMDAPbCl4 features an intrinsic absorbance edge at 320 nm, while that for HMDAPbI4 lies at 600 nm. Besides, all the perovskites show a narrow absorption band close to the intrinsic absorbance edges. Presumably, the former is related to exciton absorption.
 Fig. 7  Diffuse reflectance spectra (a), of HMDAPbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I), and the result of their differentiation (b). 
In order to determine optical bandgaps the reflectance spectra (Fig. 7a) were transformed into absorption ones (A = 1 − R) and then differentiated (Fig. 7b). For each perovskite, the plots demonstrate two peaks. The lower energy peaks in the pairs correspond to optical bandgaps (see Table 2) and agree well with the earlier report.21 The nature of the second peaks that shifted towards higher energies is explained further in the discussion section.
3.5. Band structures
Optical bandgaps derived from diffuse reflectance spectra together with the XPS data on the tops of valence bands (Table 2) suggest perovskite band structures schematically illustrated in Fig. 8. It shows that the perovskite optical bandgaps decrease with an increase in halogen atomic numbers. In the same sequence potentials of VB tops increase, whereas the conduction band potential does not change significantly.
 Fig. 8  Band structures of HMDAPbX4 (X = Cl, Br, I). The blue, red, and yellow lines correspond to the VB top, CB bottom, and WF, respectively. The energy axis is given according to the vacuum scale. 
To complement the above schematic picture of the perovskite band structures, DFT modeling of their electronic structures was performed. Since iodide and bromide perovskites are isostructural, their electronic band structures (BS) and density of states (DOS) are similar. For this reason, BS and DOS of only one of the two perovskites (HMDAPbBr4) are presented in the main text (see Fig. 9). The corresponding data for the iodide are presented in Fig. S3 of the ESI.† According to Fig. 9, the bromide and iodide perovskites feature direct electronic transition between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) at the Γ-point. Compositions of the bands are typical of most HOIPs. Namely, the perovskite VBs consist mainly of contributions from halogens, whereas their CBs mostly contain contributions from lead. As expected, contributions of the aliphatic chains of the organic subsystem to VBs and CBs are negligible. Typical of many HOIPs, the computed electronic bandgaps increase in the sequence I–Br: 2.24 eV, 2.83 eV. A comparison of the computed electronic bandgaps with optical bandgaps in Table 2 shows that the largest discrepancy is 0.41 eV (HMDAPbBr4). Its origins are well-known. First, as was noted in the Introduction, PBE bandgaps of semiconductors are known to suffer from underestimation. Second, diffuse reflectance spectra used to derive optical bandgaps are recorded under ambient conditions, whereas electronic bandgaps correspond to 0 K neglecting the effects of temperature on the crystal lattices.
 Fig. 9  Electronic PBE BS (left) and DOS (right) of HMDAPbBr4. 
As was mentioned above, despite the same crystal symmetry, the structure of the monocrystalline chloride perovskite is different from those of the bromide and iodide perovskites. Its electronic band structure is demonstrated in Fig. 10a.
 Fig. 10  Electronic BS of the actual monocrystalline (a) and hypothetical (b) HMDAPbCl4. 
Just like the bromide and iodide perovskites, the chloride perovskite features a direct transition from the VB to the CB at the Γ-point showing an electronic bandgap of 3.27 eV. It is interesting to compare the presented chloride band structure with a hypothetical one corresponding to the crystal symmetry of the bromide and iodide. The latter is presented in Fig. 10b. It demonstrates that the band structure of the hypothetical chloride perovskite is similar to those of the bromide and iodide species while being different from that of the actual chloride perovskite. The distinct feature of the latter is the presence of the plateau in the vicinity of the k-points Y and Y1 in both the VB and the CB.
4. Discussion and concluding remarks

Fig. 9a compares the DFT optical absorption spectrum (curve 1) of HMDAPbBr4 with the corresponding experimental one (curve 2) obtained from the diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 4). One can see that the computed spectrum features several characteristic transitions denoted as ‘I’, ‘II’, and ‘III’. They can be interpreted using the perovskite density of states illustrated in Fig. 9b. The low-energy absorption ‘I’ corresponds to the VB to CB transition. The higher energy transitions ‘II’ and ‘III’ feature increased optical absorption. Similar to the conduction band edge, transition ‘II’ occurs between the electronic states of lead and halogens, while transition ‘III’ occurs between the carbon and the nitrogen. Thus, the optical absorptions ‘I’ and ‘II’ correspond to electronic transitions from Br− to Pb2+, whereas the optical absorption ‘III’ is due to the electronic transitions from Br− to HMDA2+.
Thus, the observed features of the diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 7a), demonstrated as an anomalous increase in the reflectance in the intrinsic absorption region and in the presence of two maxima in the derivative plots (Fig. 7b), can be explained as follows. The first, lower energy peak in Fig. 7b, corresponding to the optical band gap, is due to the VB to CB electronic transitions. This transition is labeled “I” in Fig. 11. The second peaks that shifted towards higher energies are due to the VB to CB + 1 electronic transitions. As exemplified by HMDAPbBr4 later in the text both the CB and CB + 1 bands are mainly composed of unoccupied orbitals of lead. These transitions are labeled “II” in Fig. 11.

In Fig. 8 we have illustrated how band structures of the perovskites change with halogen atomic numbers. Taking into account the fact that the halogens feature different electronegativities it is interesting to see whether they correlate with the band structures. Fig. 12 demonstrates the dependence of VB tops, CB bottoms, and optical bandgaps of the perovskites on halogen electronegativity. It should be noted that here and further in the text the Mulliken electronegativity scale is used. The figure shows a linear increase in optical bandgaps and a linear decrease in VB tops. The observed correlations can be approximated using the following system of linear equations. The coefficients k and b are given in the inset of Fig. 12. (1)

In our opinion, the coefficients b of the above system of equations are the most interest-evoking. It follows from the system of eqn (1) and data in Fig. 12 that and kVB = 0. Thus, the bandgap increase observed in the studied perovskites is exclusively due to an increase in their anion electronegativity. In contrast, the CB energy levels are unaffected by the latter quantity.
Presumably, the differences in the perovskite band structures are related to the peculiarities of their crystal structures. Protonated amino groups in the iodide, bromide, and hypothetical chloride perovskites are located at different sides of the PbX6 octahedron axial plane (Fig. 13a). In contrast, in the monocrystalline chloride perovskite they reside at the same side of that plane (Fig. 13b). Besides, in the monocrystalline chloride perovskite equatorial X− anions lie within the planes formed by Pb2+ cations which is not the case of the iodide, bromide, and hypothetical chloride perovskites.
