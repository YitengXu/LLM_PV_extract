    , Accepted 8th December 2014First published on 9th December 2014AbstractA series of new metal-free panchromatic organic photosensitizers based on a strong electron-deficient thiadiazole[3,4-c]pyridine core has been prepared and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. The incorporation of the auxiliary thiadiazole[3,4-c]pyridine unit can effectively adjust the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, to design small band-gap photosensitizers with panchromatic absorption. The impacts of various π-conjugated spacers on the absorption properties, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performances have been investigated systematically. The sensitizer Y3 with a benzene unit adjacent to the anchoring cyanoacrylic group produces a higher photocurrent and photovoltage in cell performance, as compared to Y1 and Y2 with thiophene and n-hexylthiophene unit adjacent to the anchoring group, respectively. Further structural optimization in Y4 with a n-hexylthiophene π-conjugated spacer inserted between the donor and thiadiazole[3,4-c]pyridine core results in the best photovoltaic performance. For comparison, the sensitizer Y5 with thiophene instead of n-hexylthiophene in the molecule exhibits the most inferior performance; this demonstrates that the long alkyl chains can effectively improve the cell performance by suppressing the dye aggregation on TiO2 film, enhancing electron injection efficiency, and retarding charge recombination by shielding the surface of TiO2 from I3− ions. The overall conversion efficiency of liquid–electrolyte DSSC based on Y4 shows the highest efficiency of 6.30% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 12.54 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.749 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.671, under standard global AM 1.5 solar light condition. Density functional theory calculations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of these sensitizers provide further insight into the molecular geometry and the impact of the different π-conjugated spacers on the photophysical and photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has received remarkable attention as an alternative technology to conventional semi-conductor silicon-based solar cell since the pioneering work reported by Grätzel and O'Regan in 1991,1 owing to their low production cost and potential mass manufacturing application. In a typical DSSC, the photosensitizer exerts a significant influence on the light-harvesting and power conversion efficiency (PCE). During the past two decades, keen interests have been concentrated on the development of metal-free organic dyes, which have been one of the most promising candidates in DSSCs due to the low material cost, high molecular absorption extinction coefficient, and structural design flexibility.2–7 However, metal-free organic sensitizers exhibit a relatively poor absorption spectral response in the red and near infrared (NIR) region. One strategy of extending the spectral coverage to enhance the light harvesting efficiency is to reduce the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of sensitizers. For this purpose, a series of D–A–π–A structured sensitizers for DSSCs have been prepared by incorporating electron-deficient fragments into the π-conjugated spacer of organic dyes, such as, benzothiadiazole,8 quinoxaline,9 diketopyrrolopyrrole10 and benzotriazole,11 which can conveniently tune the molecular energy gap, modulating the absorption spectral response to match the solar emission spectrum. Moreover, the incorporated electron-deficient fragment was demonstrated to facilitate the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor end.12 Thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PyT), recognized as a strong electron-deficient unit due to its two symmetric unsaturated nitrogen atoms and pyridine N-atoms, has been widely applied to construct pull–push copolymers with narrow band gaps in the field of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics.13 These materials containing PyT unit display good thermal stability, narrow band gaps, and broad optical absorption extending into the NIR region. In our previous work, we developed three D–A–π–A structured panchromatic photosensitizers incorporating PyT unit as an additional acceptor and applied them in DSSCs.14 As expected, the spectral response of the DSSCs based on those three dyes covered the whole visible region and reached above 800 nm. However, the PCEs obtained were lower than 4.20%. A further molecular optimization of these types of panchromatic sensitizers based on PyT unit is emerging and achieving superior photovoltaic performance.
In this study, we designed a series of new organic photosensitizers (Y1–Y5) incorporating the electron-deficient PyT unit in the framework of π-conjugated spacer, and dihexyloxy-substituted triphenylamine as the donor, with cyanoacrylic acid as both the acceptor and anchoring part (Fig. 1). Moreover, the impacts of various π-conjugated spacers on the absorption properties, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performances have been investigated systematically. Spectroscopic, electrochemical, theoretical calculation and electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy analysis were performed to understand how the subtle structural variations on the sensitizers affect the photovoltaic performance in DSSC.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic procedures for sensitizers Y1–Y5 starting from 4,7-dibromo-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine are depicted in Scheme 1. The key precursors were synthesized according to the methods described in the literature. The target compounds Y1–Y5 were obtained in moderate yields via bromination, Suzuki cross-coupling reaction and Knoevenagel condensation. All the new compounds were well characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as HRMS spectroscopy.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of Y1–Y5 in dichloromethane solutions are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding spectroscopic data are summarized in Table 1. They exhibited similar broad and strong absorption spectra covering a wide range of 300–800 nm. The short wavelength peaks correspond to the π–π* transitions of the conjugated system, and the long wavelength peaks can reasonably be assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor. The absorption responses of Y1–Y5 were effectively broadened due to the incorporation of the strong electron withdrawing thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine unit in the π-conjugated spacer. As listed in Table 1, the absorption spectra of Y1–Y3 displayed maximal absorption peaks at 554 nm with molar extinction coefficients (ε) of 1.78 × 104 M−1 cm−1, at 548 nm with ε of 1.89 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and at 540 nm with ε of 2.03 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Notably, the maximal absorption peaks for the three sensitizers were blue-shifted in the order of Y1 > Y2 > Y3, indicating that the co-planarity of the molecules with different π-spacers decreased in the order of benzene > n-hexylthiophene > thiophene. However, Y4 and Y5 showed obvious red-shifted absorption peaks as well as higher molar extinction coefficients as compared with those of Y1–Y3, which can be attributed to the increased π-conjugation length by the incorporation of an additional n-hexylthiophene or thiophene in the π-spacer. The sensitizer Y5 with two thiophene units adjacent to PyT instead of n-hexylthiophene in Y4 exhibited larger bathochromic shifts of the maximum absorption peaks and onset, which resulted from the good coplanar structure due to the less steric hindrance between the thiophene and PyT. When adsorbed on a transparent thin TiO2 film, all sensitizers showed slight hypsochromic shift of the absorption maxima and broad absorption spectra (Fig. 3), which can be probably attributed to the formation of dye–dye aggregation or the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid when adsorbed on TiO2 film. Notably, the shift was less pronounced for Y4 on TiO2 film relative to other sensitizers, which indicated that the intermolecular aggregation has been effectively suppressed because of the resistance of the long alkyl chains attached.

Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the feasibility of electron injection and the possibility of dye regeneration, cyclic voltammograms have been recorded in CH2Cl2 solutions (Fig. 4) to determine oxidation potentials (Eox). The voltammograms for Y1–Y5 showed well symmetrical and reversible behaviors, indicative of high redox stability. Their HOMO and LUMO levels are summarized in Table 1. Their HOMO levels were more positive than iodide/tri-iodide redox couples (∼0.4 V), indicating that the oxidized dyes can be efficiently regenerated by the electrolyte. The zero–zero band gaps (E0–0), estimated from the onset of the UV-visible absorption spectra, were in the range of 1.68–1.92 eV. Apparently, the incorporation of the strong electron-deficient PyT unit can effectively adjust the HOMO and LUMO levels, resulting in narrow energy band gaps and broad absorption spectra. Subsequently, the LUMO levels for Y1–Y5, as calculated from EHOMO − E0–0, were in the range from −1.03 to −0.83 V, considerably more negative than the conduction band edge energy level (ECB) of TiO2 semiconductor (−0.5 V vs. NHE), energetically allowing an efficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band from the excited sensitizers. Therefore, the processes of electron injection and dye regeneration in the DSSCs based on the sensitizers are feasible.

Molecular calculations
To gain insights into the geometrical and electronic properties of the five sensitizers, density functional calculations (DFT) were performed using the Gaussian 03 program package at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)*. As shown in Fig. 5, the electron densities of LUMO orbitals of Y1–Y5 were mainly delocalized across the entire π-conjugated spacer and the cyanoacrylic acid segment. Moreover, the HOMO orbitals of Y1 and Y2 were delocalized over the entire π-conjugation systems from the donor to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, while the HOMOs of Y3–Y5 were primarily located at the donor groups and π-conjugated spacer, which were broken at the benzyl segment adjacent to the PyT core. For Y1–Y5, the dihedral angles formed between the π-conjugated spacer (PyT and n-hexylthiophene/thiophene) and the different π-linked spacers (thiophene, n-hexylthiophene and benzene) adjacent to the anchoring group, were computed to 5.6°, 9.3°, 37.8°, 38.2°, and 36.3°, respectively. Obviously, the large steric conformation may interrupt the conjugation system and weaken the ICT interactions, resulting in a blue-shift of the maximum absorption band in the order of Y3 < Y2 < Y1, which was consistent with the experimental observation of the absorption spectra in solutions. In brief, the benzyl segment adjacent to the PyT core in Y3–Y5 led to a well segregated HOMO and LUMO orbitals without the exclusion of sufficient overlap between them, which guarantees a fast charge transfer transition from the donating group to the terminal acceptor, and finally into the conduction band of TiO2.

Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs

Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of DSSCs based on the five sensitizers. Overall, the cells based on Y1–Y5 exhibit remarkably broad IPCE action spectra covering the entire visible region and part of near-infrared (NIR) region. The IPCE value at around 560 nm for Y3 (52%) is higher than that of Y1 (31%) or Y2 (46%). The IPCE as a function of wavelength is directly related to the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), charge injection efficiency (Φinj) and charge collection efficiency (Φcol).3c Disregarding the similar LUMO level and LHE values as well as the same anchoring group for the three sensitizers Y1–Y3, a higher IPCE value for Y3, with phenyl group adjacent to the PyT as π-conjugated spacer, should be ascribed to the higher charge collection efficiency. Apparently, the charge collection efficiency follows the spacer order of benzene > n-hexylthiophene > thiophene. The result indicates that the introduction of the phenyl group instead of thiophene or n-hexylthiophene in the π-conjugated spacer has a positive effect on IPCE value. Impressively, Y4 with a more extended π-conjugation network shows a much broader IPCE spectrum with the value at 560 nm above 60%. For comparison, Y5 based device shows a little broader IPCE response than that of Y4, but the IPCE plateau decreases dramatically to around 20%. The most inferior IPCE value for Y5 probably arises from the intermolecular π-stacked aggregation on TiO2 surface due to the lack of long alkyl chains as well as its unsuitable LUMO level, which leads to a reduction in the yield of electron injection owing to intermolecular energy transfer.15

The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of liquid DSSCs based on Y1–Y5 are shown in Fig. 7 and the photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2. Y1 and Y2 sensitized solar cells exhibit short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc) of 6.47 and 8.42 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.655 and 0.657 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.672 and 0.694, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiencies (η) of 2.89% and 3.84%, respectively. With a relatively higher Jsc and Voc, DSSC based on Y3 exhibits much higher conversion efficiency of 4.46%. The three sensitizers Y1–Y3 have a similar chemical structure, but their photovoltaic performances exhibit much difference. The higher photocurrent and photovoltage of the device sensitized with Y3 should be mainly attributed to the more efficient charge collection efficiency and less dye aggregation occurring on the TiO2 film because of the decreased co-planarity of the π-conjugation system, which was also supported by the DFT molecular calculation. The DSSC based on Y4 shows the best photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 12.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.749 V, and a FF of 0.671, corresponding to the η value of 6.30%, which reaches 87% of the referenced N719-based DSSC (7.27%) fabricated under similar conditions. Though the efficiencies of DSSCs based on these dyes could not compete with that of N719 dye, the systematic study of structure–property relationships of these new dyes sheds light on optimizing D–A–π–A configuration metal-free organic dyes for highly efficient DSSCs. Among the five sensitizers, Y4 shows the highest molar extinction coefficient and IPCE value in DSSC. In general, Jsc is related to the molar extinction coefficient of the sensitizer, in which a higher molar extinction coefficient correlates with good light-harvesting ability and a higher Jsc value. Moreover, the introduction of a twisted benzene spacer and the long alkyl chains in the π-conjugated bridge can interrupt the co-planarity of molecular dye and inhibit the back electron transfer, as a result the dye aggregation and charge recombination rate can be slowed down to a large degree. All in all, it is not surprising that Y4 gives the highest Jsc and Voc values in this study. For comparison, the cell sensitized with the dye Y5, without n-hexyl chains on the thiophene units, shows the most inferior Jsc (3.24 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.650 V), leading to a significantly low η value of 1.32%, even though it shows much broader absorption spectral response above 800 nm in solution. Three DSSCs were also fabricated from the Y5 containing the co-adsorbent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) at different concentrations (0, 10 and 30 mM). The efficiency of DSSC based on Y5 and 10 mM CDCA was improved to 2.11% (Fig. S1†). The inferior photocurrent for Y5 should be attributed to the good co-planarity of its π-conjugated spacer, which is liable to form intermolecular π–π stacked aggregation on the TiO2 surface, leading to a significant decrease in electron injection efficiency.9a,15

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis has been performed to elucidate the interfacial charge recombination process under a forward bias of −0.73 V in the dark (Fig. 8). Some important parameters (Rs, Rrec, and RCE) can be obtained by fitting the EIS curves using Z-view software (Table 2). In general, Rs, Rrec, and RCE represent series resistance and charge transfer processes at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and counter electrode (CE), respectively.16RS and RCE corresponding to the smaller semicircles show almost the same values in all the DSSCs due to their same electrode and electrolyte. Moreover, the Rrec corresponding to the larger semicircle is related to the charge recombination rate between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte. Generally, a smaller Rrec value indicates a faster charge recombination; thus, giving a lower Voc.8 The Rrec values for DSSCs based on these sensitizers increase in the order of Y5 < Y1 < Y2 < Y3 < Y4. The trend observed here is consistent with the results yielded for the Voc values. Among Y1–Y3, Y3 sensitized DSSC shows the highest Voc of 0.717 V, indicating that the twisted benzene unit in Y3 could be more efficient for electron injection and back reaction suppression of the injected electron with I3− ion in the electrolyte. Moreover, n-hexylthiophene-bridged sensitizer Y4 was more effective than the thiophene-bridged one Y5 for blocking I3− ions approaching the TiO2 surface; thus, retarding the charge recombination between TiO2 film and the electrolyte, resulting in the highest Voc value (0.749 V) among the five sensitizers. It can be concluded that these dyes containing benzene unit as the π-linker and n-hexylthiophene unit as π-conjugation should be beneficial to the device performances.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-cored metal-free panchromatic organic sensitizers has been synthesized and applied in DSSC applications. It was demonstrated that the introduction of PyT unit in the π-conjugation frameworks could effectively tune the energy levels and produce a narrow band-gap sensitizer with a panchromatic spectral response. For Y1–Y3, the dihedral angles formed between the π-conjugated spacer (PyT and n-hexylthiophene) and the different linkers (thiophene, n-hexylthiophene and benzene) adjacent to the anchoring group increase in the order Y1 < Y2 < Y3. As a result, Y3 featuring the largest steric hindrance between the π-conjugated spacer and the phenyl linker produces higher photocurrent and photovoltage, which is attributed to the effective inhibition of intermolecular π–π stacked aggregation on the TiO2 surface as well as the charge recombination. Impressively, the sensitizer Y4 further optimized with an n-hexylthiophene inserted between the donor and PyT segment exhibits the best photovoltaic performance mainly owing to the good light-harvesting property, the inhibition of π–π stacked dye aggregation on TiO2 film, the efficient electron injection from the excited sensitizers, and the effectively retarded charge recombination by shielding the surface of TiO2 from the I3− ions with long alkyl chains. For comparison, Y5 with thiophene instead of n-hexylthiophene in Y4 shows much broader absorption spectral response above 800 nm in solution, however, the most inferior photocurrent and photovoltage values, which should be attributed to its highly co-planar π-conjugated spacer, which is liable to form intermolecular π–π stacked aggregation on the TiO2 surface, leading to a low electron injection efficiency and rapid charge recombination. The primary findings will facilitate the development of new metal-free PyT-cored organic dyes with panchromatic absorption for efficient DSSC applications.

Measurement and characterizations

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Ultrashield 400 Plus NMR spectrometer. The UV-visible absorption spectra of these dyes were measured in CH2Cl2 solutions with a Varian Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were obtained using a Photon Technology International (PTI) Alpha scan spectrofluorimeter. High-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were obtained with a Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The cyclic voltammograms (CV) were measured with Versastat II electrochemical work station using a normal three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammoniumhexafluorophosphate in DCM solution. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated by ferrocene after each set of measurements, and all potentials mentioned in the work were against normal hydrogen electrode.
Cell fabrication and characterization
To make a reasonable comparison, all the anode films for the DSSCs were made with the same standard manner; they were composed of 12 μm thick transparent layer (TiO2 with diameter of 20 nm) and 6 μm thick scattering layer (TiO2 nanoparticles with diameter of 200 nm). In particular, a doctor-blade technique was utilized to prepare photoanode (TiO2) films. First, a layer of ca. 6 μm TiO2 paste (20 nm) was doctor-bladed onto the FTO conducting glass and then relaxed at room temperature for 3 min before heating at 150 °C for 6 min, this procedure was repeated once to achieve a film thickness of ca. 12 μm and the resulting surface was finally coated by a scattering layer (ca. 6 μm) of TiO2 paste (200 nm). The electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 275 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 470 °C for 30 min to remove polymers and generate a three-dimensional TiO2 nanoparticle network. Subsequently, the sintered films were soaked in 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 45 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, and further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to ca. 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed into a 5 × 10−4 M dye bath in CH2Cl2 solution for Y1–Y5 dye series maintained in the dark for 16 h. Then, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and dried in air. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by sputtering method at 15 mA for 90 s at a power of 150 W. Two holes (0.75 mm in diameter) were pre-drilled in the FTO glass for introducing electrolyte. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt parafilm at about 100 °C. The liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio, 1:1) was introduced into the cell through the drilled holes at the back of the counter electrode. Finally, the holes were sealed by parafilm and covering glass (0.1 mm thickness) at an elevated temperature. The effective areas of all the TiO2 electrodes were 0.24 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled DSSCs were measured by a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. IPCEs of DSSCs were recorded in Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) using DC mode. CHI 660D electrochemical work station was used to characterize the electrochemical properties of the DSSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded under dark condition over a frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV, and the parameters were calculated from Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner AssociatNe, Inc.).
