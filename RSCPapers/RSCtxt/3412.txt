    , Accepted 21st May 2014First published on 21st May 2014AbstractA set of novel 1,2,3-triazolium based ionic liquid crystals was synthesized and their mesomorphic behaviour studied by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), POM (polarizing optical microscopy) and SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering). Beside the variation of the chain length (C10, C12 and C14) at the 1,2,3-triazolium cation also the anion has been varied (Br−, I−, I3−, BF4−, SbF6−, N(CN)2−, Tf2N−) to study the influence of ion size, symmetry and H-bonding capability on the mesophase formation. Interestingly, for the 1,3-didodecyl-1,2,3-triazolium cation two totally different conformations were found in the crystal structure of the bromide (U-shaped) and the triiodide (rod shaped).
Introduction
Ionic liquids (ILs), salts with a melting point below 100 °C, offer unique chemical and physical properties and property combinations.1 Properties such as negligible vapour pressure, wide liquid range, good thermal stability, considerable electric conductivity, and large electrochemical window are advantageous for a number of applications.2 ILs have been described as “designer solvents”, because variation of the cation and anion leads to adjustable properties.3 ILs which can adopt a liquid crystalline state of matter are called ionic liquid crystals (ILCs). Thus, ILCs combine the properties of ionic liquids and liquid crystals.4 Apart from their IL features such as low vapor pressure and ion conductivity, they show anisotropy: numerous physicochemical and mechanical properties highly depend on the direction. Compared to molecular, uncharged mesogens the ionic interactions in ILCs favor the formation of higher ordered phases, often smectic or even higher ordered phases.4,5
In recent years, a number of cation types for ionic liquids have been developed, but still by far the most commonly used are imidazolium cations. As a consequence, most of the ionic liquid crystals studied so far are based on imidazolium as well. Mesomorphic behavior has been reported for bicationic imidazolium based salts6–8 and 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium salts with long alkyl chains.9,10 The dependency of the thermal properties on the chain length of this cation was investigated frequently.11–13 The role of the anion was analyzed for different imidazolium based ILs and ILCs.2,14–16
A typical application of ionic liquids is their use as an alternative solvent. Quite often an enhancement of the selectivity, yield or activity of catalytic reactions is observed.17 No wonder that recently also the use of imidazolium ILCs and ILC films has been explored for catalysis. When immobilizing an imidazolium based ILC on porous silica supports an ILC–SILP material was obtained where the temperature-induced reorganization of the ILC still can be observed. ILC–SILPs are a new class of material with temperature-switchable physical properties which have been proposed for use in optical, catalytic, electronic, and separation technologies.18,19 The use of ILCs as electrolytes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was discovered later.20–22 DSSCs are promising low-cost alternatives to commercial silicon based solar cells.23 One of the biggest problems of the DSSC is the limited lifetime which is due to volatile electrolytes.24 To circumvent this ILs have been tested as electrolytes and other problems arise: high viscosity and low conductivity.23,25 Improvement of the conductivity was achieved with ILCs although they have larger viscosity.20,22 Higher photocurrent density and higher light to electricity conversion efficiency were observed for 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium, which exhibits a smectic A phase, compared to the ionic liquid 1-undecyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide. These results can be explained by the self-assembled structure of the liquid crystal, where two-dimensional electron conductive pathways are formed.22 For 1,3-didodecylimidazolium iodide the advantage of using an ionic liquid crystal as the electrolyte in DSSC was shown as well.26
However, with imidazolium ionic liquids problems due to the acidic C-2 imidazolium proton are encountered, e.g. in the Baylis–Hillman reaction.27 To circumvent deprotonation at the imidazolium C-2 position under basic conditions and decomposition of the ionic liquid, inert 1,2,3-triazolium based ionic liquids have been developed.28 In the context of the application of ILCs the question arises what happens to the mesophase if we abstain from the acidic proton and replace the imidazolium by 1,2,3-triazolium? For that reason we synthesized a set of different new ILCs based on the triazolium cation (Fig. 1) and explored their temperature dependent phase behavior. Beside the variation of the chain length at the 1,2,3-triazolium cation also the anion has been varied and its influence on the mesophase has been investigated (Table 1). Anions of different size, symmetry and hydrogen bonding capability were chosen. Finally, the results were compared to the equivalent imidazolium ILCs.29,30

Results and discussion
Synthesis
To obtain the different triazolium salts, the respective alkylazide was reacted with an excess of vinyl acetate to the 1-alky-1,2,3-triazole (Scheme 1). These (1a–3a) were alkylated at the N-3 position with the corresponding alkylbromide to the different desired triazolium bromides (1–3). The compounds 4–9 were prepared via anion metathesis with the sodium or potassium salt of the desired anion. All compounds were obtained as white or brown (iodide and triiodide) solids. In contrast to the respective imidazolium salts which are highly hygroscopic,1,10 astonishingly none of the produced substances is air sensitive or hygroscopic. Thus, no protective atmosphere is required for the synthesis.

Crystal structure analysis
Single crystals of 1,3-didodecyltriazolium bromide ([C12C12Tr][Br], (2)) could be grown successfully from a dichloromethane solution. It was not possible to obtain crystals of the other compounds by this conventional method, but in situ crystallization on the diffractometer, a procedure which successfully has been applied to growing crystals of ionic liquids,31,32 allowed us to grow single crystals of 1,3-didodecyl-triazolium triiodide([C12C12Tr][I3], (5)) of sufficient quality for structure analysis (Table 2).

Refined as a racemic twin




[C12C12Tr][Br] (2) crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (no. 2) with two formula units in the unit cell. The two alkyl chains of one cation point to the same direction with respect to the triazolium head group and run nearly parallel leading to U-shaped cationic entities. The conformation of the alkyl chain is all trans except the bond from the first to the second carbon of the chain which is gauche. This allows the bromide anions to build hydrogen bonds to the first carbon–H of the chain. In addition, the two CH-groups of the triazolium ring also form C–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds to (different) bromide anions (Table 3). Hence one bromide anion is connected via hydrogen bonds to three different cations (Fig. 2). In the crystal the cations form a bilayer structure with head-to-head arranged triazolium head groups (Fig. 3). However, the triazolium cations are not facing each other directly but alternate with bromide anions. In contrast to many imidazolium ionic liquid crystals for which the crystal structure has been reported, the alkyl chains are not interdigitated. However, a clear structural segregation of charged, polar domains made up of the triazolium head group and the hydrogen bonded bromide anions and the apolar, hydrophobic alkyl tails of the triazolium cation can be observed.

 Fig. 3  Crystal structure of 1,3-didodecyltriazolium bromide (2). 
The corresponding triiodide 5 crystallizes at room temperature in the monoclinic space group P21/c with four formula units in the unit cell. In contrast to the bromide compound the 1,3-didodecyltriazolium cations have an elongated rod shape with the alkyl chains stretched outward into opposite directions along the imidazolium core plane (Fig. 4). The cation is nearly linear with an angle between the triazolium-ring centroid and the terminal dodecyl chain carbon atoms of 179°. The alkyl chains are in all trans conformation. The cationic rods alternate with the linear triiodide anion and form parallel rows of ions. The dodecyl chains are strongly interdigitated. The triiodide anion forms hydrogen bonds to one of the hydrogen bearing carbon atoms of the triazolium ring and to the first carbon of the alkyl chain leading to a parallel orientation of the triode anion and the triazolium cation (Fig. 5). The hydrogen bonding interactions are summarized in Table 3. The triazolium rings alternate in orientation along the c axis. This means the nitrogen atoms at the top of two neighboring triazolium rings point in opposite directions within the layers (Fig. 6).

Upon heating the crystal to 50 °C on the diffractometer a structural transition occurs: the triazolium rings turn around and all point to the same direction (Fig. 5). In this phase the crystal changed to the monoclinic space group P21 with two formula units in the unit cell. In this structure the triiodide anion builds I⋯H–C bonds to one triazolium-carbon and to the first C-atom of the chain as well (Fig. 5).
In the case of the didodecyltriazolium bromide (2) and the triiodide salt (4) the influence of the anion on the crystal structure is obvious. The anion geometry affects the molecular conformation of the cation. This is linear or rod like for triiodide and U-shaped for the bromide.
Thermal investigations
The thermal properties of all compounds were examined by polarizing optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The transition temperatures, enthalpies and phase transition assignments are listed in Table 4. For the symmetric N,N-dialkyl-1,2,3-triazolium bromides with different alkyl chains (decyl, C10, dodecyl, C12, and tetradecyl, C14) two phase transitions can be observed in the DSC. Fig. 7 shows the DSC-traces of the first heating cycles from all three bromides. Temperature dependent POM identifies the first transition to be the flow point (S → LC) and the second one belongs to the clearing point (LC → LISO). The cooling cycles reveal that two thermal events might overlap strongly. In addition the DSC traces of compounds 2 and 3 show one additional thermal event at room temperature, which can be attributed to a solid–solid phase transition.

 Fig. 7  DSC-traces of the bromide salts 1, 2 and 3. 
For the bromides an increase in the liquid crystalline temperature range with the decreasing chain length is observed (Fig. 8). Compound 3 melts with an endothermic transition to a mesophase at 68 °C, which clears at 115 °C with a smaller endothermic transition.
 Fig. 8  Effect of chain length on mesogenic properties. 
For substance 2 the clearing point lies roughly at the same temperature, while the flow point clearly increases to 82 °C. The mesophase range for compound 1 is relatively small, 13 °C, compared with 34 °C and 47 °C for 2 and 3.
In contrast to the bromide (2), the analogous iodide salt (4) exhibits a more complex phase behavior (Fig. 9). The thermal changes at lower temperature (T < 60 °C) are due to a solid–solid phase transition. Upon heating compound 4 adopts a highly ordered mesophase at about 75 °C and around 92 °C a transition to a smectic A phase occurs (as confirmed by SAXS, see below). All these transitions are reversible and reappear during cooling, albeit at slightly lower temperatures (Fig. 9).
 Fig. 9  DSC-thermogram of compound 4. 
The thermal behavior of the triiodide salt 5 is totally different from that of the simple iodide 4 and bromide 2 which is expected considering the different crystal structures. The DSC thermogram of compound 5 shows two phase transitions as observed for the bromide 2 (Fig. 10), but when comparing the thermal events it already becomes clear that the transition enthalpy for the second phase transition of the bromide (corresponding to a change from the LC to the isotropic liquid phase) is much smaller than the enthalpy of the transition occurring at lower temperatures whereas in the triiodide the enthalpy of the second phase transition is much higher than the enthalpy of the first transition. The reason is that compound 5 does not form a LC phase but undergoes a solid–solid phase transition at 44 °C before it melts to an isotropic liquid at 51 °C. The nature of the phase transition and the corresponding structural changes were unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction.
 Fig. 10  DSC-thermogram of compound 5 showing the different crystal structures at the respective temperatures. 
The DSC thermograms of substances 7, 8 and 9 with different anions (SbF6−, N(CN)2−, Tf2N−) look similar to those of the C12-bromide 2. They all show two exothermic peaks upon heating where the enthalpy content of the first transition is always much larger than that of the second. The first thermal event is also much narrower whereas the second stretches over a wide temperature range (Fig. 11). Indeed, as observed for the bromide 2, the hexafluoroantimonate 7 and the dicyanamide 8 form a mesophase upon heating at around 82 °C. However, probably because of the ion size, the clearing temperatures of 7 and 8 are slightly lower (∼10 °C) than that of the bromide salt 2. For the largest and less symmetric salt (Tf2N) the transitions are shifted even to lower temperatures (Fig. 13).
 Fig. 11  DSC-heating-traces of compounds 7, 8, and 9 in comparison to 2. 
The DSC thermogram of compound 6 with the tetrafluoroborate anion distinctly differs from those of the bromide (Fig. 12). With five phase transitions it is more similar to the iodide 4. Upon cooling the isotropic liquid a smectic A phase occurs at 92 °C. This phase was identified on the basis of its optical defect textures: oily streak textures were observed by POM (Fig. 12). During further cooling a transition to a higher ordered mesophase takes place at 80 °C. The crystallization process is split into three transitions. After the first crystallization the compound undergoes two more solid–solid phase transitions until the room temperature solid state is reached.
 Fig. 12  DSC-traces of compound 6 with POM pictures. 
 Fig. 13  Effect of the anion on the phase transition temperatures. 
The identification of transition temperatures and the proof of mesophase formation was undertaken by POM (polarizing optical microscopy). Fig. 14 shows some representative POM textures for observed mesophases obtained by heating and cooling of the compounds.

Small angle X-ray scattering
To identify the mesophase and to comprehend the molecular arrangement of the triazolium salts temperature dependent SAXS measurements were carried out. All compounds display a similar SAXS pattern with one sharp peak between 2 and 3° corresponding to (001), hence, the interlayer distance of a layered phase, and in most cases smaller second order (002) and third order (003) peaks. The layer distances, calculated from Bragg's law, are listed in Table 5.

The distance of 35 Å of compound 2 can be identified as the bilayer spacing in the crystal structure of this salt. This distance increases proportionally with the increasing chain length (3: 30 Å, 2: 35 Å, 1: 40 Å) (Fig. 15). After phase transition to the mesophase the layer distance decreases significantly by 3–4 Å in all three compounds (1, 2, 3). The cations themselves supposedly keep their U-shaped conformation with end-to-end packing of the alkyl chains. The diffraction pattern of the mesophase with diffraction peaks with reciprocal spacing in the ratio 1:2:3 suggest a layered structure. The decrease in layer spacing occurs either because of interdigitation or torsional distortion of the alkyl chains or because of tilting of the ions. Since the crystal structure of compound 2 shows no interdigitation and a very small distance between the parallel alkyl chains of the molecules it is reasonable to assume that the interdigitation is irrelevant and either the alkyl chain mobility or interdigitation is the reason for the decrease in layer spacing. Within the limits of the measuring accuracy the decrease of the layer spacing from the crystal to the mesophase is independent of the alkyl chain length. As the POM pictures do not show any homeotropic alignment and the enthalpy change for the transition to the isotropic liquid is much higher than usual for smectic A to isotropic liquid transitions a smectic C arrangement is assumed. The bromides adopt a smectic C phase shown in Fig. 15. In the case of the hexafluorophopsphate 7 and dicyanamide 8 salts the POM pictures and the SAXS pattern are similar to the respective bromide salt 2 indicating a similar phase behavior and these compounds form smectic C phases as well.

The DSC thermogram of the triiodide salt 5 exhibits two phase transitions whereas no formation of a LC phase but instead a solid–solid phase transition with a reorientation of the triazolium rings was observed. Not astonishingly this is also reflected in the SAXS measurement where the layer distance in the crystal which is totally different from the distances measured for the bromide is observed. The crystal structure confirms this observation. The measured layer spacings of about 22 Å can be identified in both crystal structures (low temperature and 50 °C, Fig. 3) as the distance between the triazolium cores.
Compound 4 with iodide as the anion has in the crystalline state the same layer distance as the bromide, but while heating it behaves quite differently. The four phase transitions that can be observed via DSC and POM also influence the layer spacing. During the solid–solid transition the layer spacing decreases to 33 Å and on further heating it changes to 31 Å. At 90 °C the existing peaks in the SAXS-pattern do not change but an additional peak which corresponds to a layer distance of 26 Å (see ESI†). This is due to the coexistence of a smectic A phase at this moment.
The behavior of compound 6 also differs from that of the bromide 2. It exhibits two different liquid crystalline phases. The one at higher temperatures can clearly be identified as smectic A by the oily streak textures (Fig. 12). In the other mesophase the SAXS pattern shows additional peaks, which cannot be related to higher order reflections. This indicates a higher ordered liquid crystalline phase. The different features of the POM image of the Tf2N salt 9 already indicate another structural arrangement. This is confirmed by SAXS measurements: as the observed layer spacing in the mesophase is 28 Å whereas for a U-shaped cation in the smectic C phase a distance of 32 Å is anticipated. Neither does the observed distance fit to a linear conformation of the cation, which should be around 22 Å as observed in the triiodide (5). More likely for the cation is a V-shape (Fig. 16), like it was observed for the didodecylimidazolium pentaiodide.30

Instrumentation
The water content of the samples was determined with a 831 KF coulometer (Metrohm, Filderstadt, Germany).
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a computer-controlled PhoenixDSC 204 F1 thermal analyzer (Netzsch, Selb, Germany). Measurements were carried out at a heating rate of 5 K min−1 in a sealed aluminum crucible with an argon flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The samples were placed in aluminum pans which were cold-sealed. The given temperatures correspond to the onset of the respective thermal process.
Optical analyses were made by heated-stage polarized optical microscopy (POM) with an Axio Imager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen, D) equipped with a hot stage, THMS600 (Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd, Surrey, UK), and a Linkam TMS 94 temperature controller (Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd, Surrey, UK). Images were recorded at a magnification of 100× as a video with a digital camera during heating and cooling the sample which was placed between two cover slips. Heating and cooling rates were 5 K min−1.
Temperature-dependent SAXS experiments were carried out at the BW4 Beamline of DORIS III, Hasylab (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) at a fixed wavelength of 1.38 Å. The data were collected with a MarCCD detector. The detector was calibrated with silver behenate and the sample–detector position was fixed at 455 mm. For measurements, the samples were placed between aluminum foil in a copper sample holder, the sample chamber was evacuated and the temperature was controlled via a JUMO IMAGO 500 multi-channel process and a program controller. The program “a2tool” (Hasylab) was used for data reduction, analysis and correction.
Powder-XRD measurements were carried out using a HUBER G670 diffractometer with a molybdenum source. The samples were situated in a class capillary with a diameter of 0.5 mm. For high temperature measurements a U-shaped ceramic heating fork was placed above the capillary. The temperature was regulated via a high temperature controller HUBER HTC 9634.
Crystals of 1,3-didodecyl-1,2,3-triazole bromide (2) were obtained by recrystallization of the compound in cold dichloromethane. These data were collected on a Rigaku XTaLAB mini diffractometer at 170 K. Crystals of 1,3-didodecyl-1,2,3-triazolium triiodide (5) of sufficient quality for single crystal X-ray structure analysis were grown from the melt in situ on an X-ray diffractometer. Therefore the ionic liquid was loaded into a Lindeman glass capillary, sealed and mounted vertically on the diffractometer. The sample was carefully cooled by a nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryosystem) until the triiodide solidified as a polycrystalline material. An IR laser was focused on the capillary and the laser power was adjusted to melt the product in the area of the laser focus. The laser was slowly moved upwards along the capillary and then the power was slowly reduced. The polycrystalline material melts in the area of the laser focus. When the molten zone moves along the capillary a single crystal starts to grow from the bottom. This procedure was repeated several times until a single crystal of sufficient quality for structure analysis was grown. Crystal growth and intensity data were carried out on a Stoe IPDS-I single-crystal X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å at 170 K). Crystal structure solution by direct methods using SIR 9234 yielded the heavy atom positions. Refinement with SHELXL-9735 allowed for the localization of the remaining atom positions. Hydrogen atoms were added and treated with the riding atom mode. Data reduction was performed with the program package X-Red36 and numerical absorption correction was carried out with the program X-Shape.37 To illustrate the crystal structures, the program Diamond38 was used.
Conclusion
A set of nine different new symmetrical 1,3-bis alkyl-triazolium based salts has been synthesized. On one hand the alkyl chain length of the cation was varied symmetrically ([C10C10Tr]+, [C12C12Tr]+, [C14C14Tr]+) for bromide as the counteranion. The aim was to reveal the influence of the cation size on the mesophase formation. It was found that all three salts are thermotropic liquid crystals and form a smectic C phase. In addition various anions (Br−, I−, I3−, BF4−, SbF6−, N(CN)2−, Tf2N−) in combination with the [C12C12Tr]+ cation were investigated. By means of the crystal structure analysis the anion influence on the conformation of the cation was shown. In the solid state the [C12C12Tr]+ cation forms either a U-shaped or a rod-shaped conformation depending on the anion geometry. Six of the prepared compounds exhibit smectic C phases with a bilayer arrangement of the cations. The mesophase range within the bromides increases with a decrease in the alkyl chain length. A smectic A phase and higher ordered mesophases were observed for the [C12C12Tr]+ cation with tetrafluoroborate and iodide as the anion. Only the triiodide did not show liquid crystalline behavior, which is justified by the different crystal packing. What happens to the mesophase if we do not use the acidic proton and replace the imidazolium core by a 1,2,3-triazolium group? The formation of mesophases are stabilized by this structural change, compounds that do not form a liquid crystalline phase when they have an imidazolium core ([C12C12IM]I, [C12C12IM][N(CN)2], [C12C12IM][SbF6])31 exhibit smectic C phases when the imidazole functionality is replaced by triazole. Apparently the absence of the acidic proton leads to fewer hydrogen bonds which promotes the formation of mesophases. On the other hand compounds that form a smectic A phase when they have an imidazolium core ([C10C10IM]Br, [C12C12IM]Br, [C14C14IM]Br) (ref. 39) exhibit smectic C phases when the imidazole is replaced by triazole. This is due to the U-shaped conformation the triazole cation adopts with the bromide anions. In contrast to the didecylimidazolium bromide which shows a layer spacing of 23 Å in the smectic A phase, indicating an interdigitated rod-like structure, the didecyltriazolium bromide has a layer distance of 27 Å in the smectic C phase. This might be an explanation for the opposite behavior observed for the triazolium bromides. The mesophase stability decreases with the increasing chain length. The imidazolium bromides show the contrary trend,40 which has been regarded as common for many ionic liquid crystals with long alkyl chains.16,40–42
