    , Accepted 3rd October 2010First published on 11th November 2010AbstractHighly crystallized boron-doped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles are prepared by a facile synthetic route and successfully used as the photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). We have observed that the boron doping could improve the crystallinity of TiO2. Moreover, the highly crystallized anatase boron-doped TiO2 were analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-vis spectroscopy, and the internal resistances of the boron-doped DSCs were studied by measuring the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The improved photocurrent density of the boron-doped DSCs is due to a significant enhancement of IPCE in the range 370–650nm in comparison with that of the undoped DSC. Meanwhile, the energy-conversion efficiency of the cell based on the B-doped TiO2 electrode is enhanced significantly, by about 9%, compared to that of the undoped DSC. Overall, DSCs based on B-doped electrodes show good stability and remain over 95% of their initial efficiency under visible light soaking for more than 2400 h.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are currently attracting widespread scientific and technological interest because they are a high-efficiency, simple to fabricate and low-cost alternative to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices.1–6 As one key component in DSCs, TiO2 has been extensively studied due to its high thermal stability, availability, and environmental friendliness. Recently, great efforts have been directed to exploring new photoanodes in place of the single porous TiO2 films, in the hope of further enhancing the performance and understanding the inner working of DSC systems.7–13 Some studies include TiO2 doping,8–10 core–shell structures,11or coatings.12 In particular, doping with other elements, as a simple and feasible method, has been widely used for TiO2 modification to improve DSC performance.
In recent years, a great of attention has been devoted to nitrogen doping in DSCs.13,14 Doping nitrogen into the TiO2 photoanode of DSCs can replace the oxygen deficiency in TiO2 resulting in an improvement of the stability of DSCs.13,14 Di Valentin et al. also discussed the open question about the important role of oxygen vacancies in the photoactivity of N-doped TiO2.15 While the N-TiO2 system has been widely investigated and a fairly unified conclusion has been reached, little is known about boron-doped TiO2. The corresponding literature sometimes is controversial.16–18 Recently, Pawar et al. prepared a boron-doped zinc oxide (BnZnO) electrode for potential application in dye-sensitized solar cells,19 but there is no detailed study about the B-TiO2 electrode of DSCs. In particular, the photoelectrochemical performance and photostability of DSCs based on B-doped TiO2 electrodes has not been reported yet.
Herein, we have demonstrated the application of a B-doped TiO2 electrode in DSCs which enhanced the photovoltaic performance of DSCs. A procedure for preparing B-TiO2 paste with controlled phase composition and good morphology used in DSCs was introduced, and the influences of boron doping on crystallinity and oxygen vacancies in the TiO2 electrode were researched. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical performance and the photostability in DSCs based on a B-TiO2 photoanode were investigated in detail.
Experimental
Preparation of boron-doped nanoporous TiO2

Titanium isopropoxide (30 ml, Fluka) was added dropwise to a prepared solution containing boric acid, formed by different amounts of boric acid (TiO2:boric acid = 4/1 or 5/1 weight ratio) dissolved in 70 ml deionized water mixed with 30 ml ethanol solution under vigorous stirring, and the boric acid solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Synthesis of B-TiO2 nanocrystals entails the dropwise addition (2 mL min−1) of titanium isopropoxide. The formed precipitate solution was stirred vigorously for 2–4 h, and then stirred for 8–15 h at 80 °C to form a transparent sol and heated at 200 °C in an autoclave for 10 h to obtain a gel. The remaining procedures were the same as described by our group in ref. 20.

DSC
assembly

The undoped and B-TiO2 pastes were printed on conducting glass substrates (F-doped SnO2) by using a screen-printing technique, and then sintered in air at 450 °C for 30 min to form nanostructured TiO2 and boron-doped TiO2 films about 11.8, 10.6 or 10.9 μm in thickness measured by a profilometer (XP-2, AMBIOS Technology Inc., USA). The nanostructure films were immersed in an 0.5mM ethanol solution of dye N719 [cis-dithiocyanate-N,N′-bis-(4-carboxylate-4′-tetrabutylamonium-carboxylate-2,2′-pyridine)ruthenium(II)] at room temperature for 12 h. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich cell by heating with a 60 μm thermal adhesive film (Surlyn, Dupont). The electrolyte solution, which consists of 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M benzimidazole (BI) and 0.1 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) in MePN, was injected into the interspaces between the photoanode and the counter electrode. The active areas of DSCs were 4.0 cm2.
Sample characterization
The particle morphology of B-TiO2 and the B-TiO2 electrode microstructure were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, sirion200, FEI Corp., Holland). The crystallinity of the B-TiO2 film was determined using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, TTR-III, Rigaku Corp., Japan) measurement with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The crystallite size D was calculated by using the Scherrer equation. Crystallite sizes, phases, and shapes were observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (TEM,JEOL-2010, Japan). The interstitial and substitution of the oxygen sites with boron atoms in the titania structure was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Electron Corp., USA). The UV-vis spectrum was taken on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, PGeneral Instrument Inc., China). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were performed on a JEOL JES-FA200 EPR spectrometer (EPR, 9064 MHz, X-band., Japan). Impedance measurements were carried out with an IM6ex electrochemical workstation (Zahner-Elektrick, Germany) in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 1000 kHz at room temperature. The working electrode was a dyed TiO2 electrode of DSC, and the auxiliary electrode and the reference electrode were a platinized counter electrode of DSC. The amplitude of the alternating signal was 5 mV.
The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) characteristics of DSCs with an active area of 4.0 cm2 were measured under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination which was provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, USA) with a Keithley 2420 source meter (Keithley, USA). During a successive one sun light soaking experiment, the solar cells covered with a 50 μm thick polymer film as a UV cutoff filter (up to 394 nm) were irradiated at open circuit under a 450 W xenon lamp (XQ3000, 100 mW cm−2, Shanghai B.R. Science Instrument Co., Ltd, China). During the experiments the air temperature was set to 50 °C and the temperature of the devices during testing and stress under illumination was constant.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the cross-section micrographs of the TiO2/FTO electrode and boron-doped TiO2/FTO electrode. The micrographs of the B-TiO2 and undoped TiO2 nanoparticles show that the average particle sizes of undoped and B-TiO2 nanoparticles are around 22 nm. The nanoparticles in the TiO2 film printed on conducting glass substrates (F-doped SnO2) are well connected to make a compact film with the porous structure. Such a well-connected nanoparticle network is desirable for efficient functioning of DSCs to improve the electron percolation of the system. It is found that the addition of boron acid in this modified sol–gel method does not obviously influence the TiO2 crystallite size and the adherence between the B-TiO2 particles and the conducting glass substrates (F-doped SnO2) compared to the undoped TiO2.

In Fig. 2, the XRD patterns of B-TiO2 and undoped TiO2 illustrate that the crystal structures of all three samples correspond to the anatase phase of the undoped TiO2 and B-TiO2 at 2θ = 25.3° after annealing at 450 °C. The result implies that the boron-doped and undoped samples consist of anatase-phase TiO2. The XRD patterns do not show any boron phase in Fig. 2, which could be attributed to the boron being uniformly dispersed among the anatase crystallites, or the quantity of the doping boron being too low to be observed. The (101) anatase peak intensity of B-TiO2 is larger than that of undoped TiO2, as observed in Fig. 2. It confirms that the crystallinity of TiO2 could be improved by boron doping.21 The results are consistent with the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation. Fig. 3 shows that the B-doped nanocrystals are highly crystallized with a well-resolved lattice structure. The observed spacing between the lattice planes of the sample is obtained as 0.35 nm for the (101) plane of the anatase crystal, and the crystal lattice shown in Fig. 3d was very clear, indicating no obvious defects. However, oxygen vacancies as one kind of defect might exist in the samples due to the charge imbalance caused by anionic boron (B). The average size of nanoparticles was estimated from the Scherrer equation on the anatase diffraction peak (101): (1)where Dhkl is the crystal size, λ the X-ray wavelength (1.54056 Å), β the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak and θ is the diffraction angle. Average crystal sizes of undoped TiO2 and B-TiO2 calculated are all around 16.0 nm, in good agreement with the FE-SEM results (see ESI, Table S1†). The results indicate that the addition of boron in the study basically did not obviously influence the crystal size of TiO2 but improve the crystallinity of TiO2. The crystal structure and BET results in the present data (see ESI, Table S1†) have a small difference compared with those of some other researchers,22 which could be related to the fact that the preparation of crystallized TiO2 was performed under different conditions including the temperature conditions in the autoclave.

As seen in Fig. 4, there are three peaks at 191.3, 188.2 and 181.7eV for B 1s. In the B 1s XPS spectra, the maximum amount of B in the B-doped TiO2 sample was estimated as about 0.9 at.% (<1 at.%). It is well known that B-TiO2 often exhibits a peak of the B 1s level about 192 eV.17,23,24 The standard binding energy of B 1s in boron oxide, B2O3, is around 194 eV.21 In some cases the B 1s peak around 192 eV coexists with other peaks at higher binding energies, indicating the possible formation of B2O3 into or at the surface of the titania structure,25 while in TiB2 the B 1s level shifts to smaller binding energies, about 188 eV.17 In Fig. 4, three peaks at 191.3, 188.2 and 181.7eV for B 1s and the absence of the peak at 194 eV are signatures of the fact that B has entered into the structure as a diluted impurity, not in the form of B2O3. Finazzi et al. indicated that the B 1s peak at 181.7eV was ascribed to the substitutional boron [BTi3]˙.26 The peaks observed at 188.2 and 191.3 eV should be attributed to the B–Ti–B and Ti–O–B structure, respectively, and the Ti–O–B structure illustrates that the doping boron is likely to weave into the interstitial TiO2 structure.17,18,21

The UV-vis spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The UV-vis spectrum shows that the doping of boron induces a blue shift, as also reported in Chen's work on B-doped TiO2 by the sol–gel method.18 B doping results in a blue shift of the absorption spectra due to a small increase of the band gap when boron is in interstitial positions.18 The results indicate that B-TiO2 had a larger band gap than that of undoped TiO2. In Fig. 5, it could be concluded that the slight blue shift in the UV-vis spectrum may be attributed to the changes of chemical environment in TiO2 due to boron doping, and the following process could be happening upon boron doping: B + 3Ti4+ → B3+ + 3Ti3+(2)Boron doping reduces the valence of the titanium ion and concomitantly suggests an increase in the oxygen vacancy.26 Gopal et al. also proposed that boron doping favors formation of an oxygen vacancy with two excess electrons, which would further reduce two Ti4+ ions to form Ti3+.27

In order to further investigate the influence of boron doping on the oxygen vacancies, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an accurate probe was used to study the doping state and the oxygen vacancies in TiO2. Fig. 6 shows the EPR spectra of the undoped and boron-doped TiO2 powder. Both spectra were recorded at 120 K. Compared to the undoped TiO2 powder, more obvious, sharp signals for boron-doped TiO2 appear as shown in Fig. 6. In particular, for the both boron-doped samples analyzed, more prominent signals at g = 2.004 and g = 1.990 account for the larger signal area. A similar EPR signal has been observed in another nonmetal doped anatase TiO2.28 It is well known that g-values between 1.93 and 1.99 are due to Ti3+ species.28–30 Serpone et al. also assigned the signal at g = 2.003–2.005 to one electron trapped on the oxygen vacancy.31 In Fig. 6, it can be seen that the intensity of this signal for the B-doped sample became stronger after introducing boron species. The result suggests that B doping favors the formation of oxygen vacancy, as also reported in Wu' work on B-doped TiO2 prepared by the sol–gel method combined with a solvothermal treatment.32

Furthermore, the solar cell (active area of 4.0 cm2) characteristics of the B-TiO2 films as working electrodes were analyzed under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination. Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves of the DSC based on the boron-doped and undoped TiO2 photoelectrodes. The boron-doped DSCs exhibit better energy conversion efficiency than the undoped one. In Table 1, it is shown that the solar energy conversion efficiencies of the DSCs using the B-TiO2 photoanodes are 6.1% and 6.0%,which are larger than the undoped value, 5.6%. Remarkably, the short circuit current density, Jsc, of the boron-doped photoelectrode significantly increased from 13.0 to 14.1 mA cm−2, corresponding to a 7% improvement. The largely increased Jsc led to the superior energy-conversion efficiency of boron-doped DSC, which is about 9% higher than that of the undoped one.

Moreover, in order to investigate the reason why the higher photocurrent for the dye-sensitized boron-doped TiO2 solar cells was obtained, we measured the action spectra of the undoped and B-doped DSCs. We found a significant enhancement in IPCE of the dye-sensitized boron-doped TiO2 solar cells compared with the undoped DSC in the range 370–650 nm, as shown in Fig. 8. The peak located at 340 nm in the action spectrum for the DSC without dye is due to the band gap excitation of TiO2 under UV light,33 and we also observed it (see ESI, Fig. S1†). IPCE at this position increased slightly which was attributed to the boron doping in dye-sensitized boron-doped TiO2 solar cells indicating that doping of boron allows band-gap excitation of TiO2 under UV light. The significant enhancement of IPCE in the range 370–650 nm is in good agreement with the increased photocurrent density of the boron-doped DSCs compared with that of the undoped DSC. The photocurrent density (Jsc) improvement can be related to the charge-transfer ability, and the conductivity of TiO2 increases with increasing concentration of oxygen vacancies in porous anatase TiO2.34 and at the same time, the improved crystallinity for B-TiO2 film favors the injected electrons. The higher value of IPCE of the dye-sensitized boron-doped TiO2 solar cells compared with that of the undoped DSC could be attributed to the oxygen vacancies favoring electron transfer in the TiO2 nanoparticle network35 and the high crystallinity favoring the injected electrons. In addition, Voc shifts slightly to lower values with increasing concentration of boric acid. It is concluded that the oxygen vacancy could influence the electron recombination reaction, but overall the influence on the Voc by the presence of boron (<1 at.%) in the TiO2 electrode is not apparent.

In order to research the effect of boron doping on the DSCs further, EIS was applied to investigate the interface performance. Fig. 9 shows the Nyquist and Bode plots of DSCs with boron doping measured at a forward bias of −0.72V in the dark. In Fig. 9, the Nyquist plots and the Bode plots fitted by the ZView software are illustrated. In Fig. 9, the responses in the frequency regions, which consist of four parts around 104 (ω1), 103 (ω2), 10 (ω3) and 0.1 to 1 (ω4) Hz, are assigned to charge transfer processes at the Pt/electrolyte interface, the TiO2/TiO2 particles interface, the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion within the electrolyte, respectively.10,36–38 It is observed that the semicircles at the frequency range ω2 become smaller with increasing boron content, owing to the enhanced electron conductivity between the TiO2 particles,10 and the fitted Nyquist plot data indicate that the interfacial charge recombination resistance, Rct, of the undoped and the boron-doped DSCs are 5.5, 5.2 and 5.0 Ω, respectively. In the Bode plots, it could be seen that the addition of boron into the TiO2 electrode shifts the mid-frequency peak to higher frequencies a little, and increased their amplitude. The calculated electron lifetimes of the undoped and the boron-doped DSCs are 88.0, 82.7 and 80.0 ms (see ESI, Table S2†). The decrease of electron lifetime could be explained by the drop of Voc in B-doped DSCs, which is consistent with the photovoltaic data, as shown in Table 1. It is indicated that the conductivity between the TiO2 particles in the TiO2 electrode could be improved after B doping, and the boron doping (<1 at.%) into the TiO2 photoanode increases the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface slightly.
 Fig. 9  Nyquist (a) and Bode (b) impedance plots of undoped and boron-doped DSCs obtained at a forward bias of −0.72 V in the dark.; The TiO2 films had a thickness of ca. 11 μm. The lines show the fitted results in Nyquist plots. 
The stability of DSCs based on B-TiO2 (0.9 at.% B) and undoped TiO2 photoanodes covered with a 50 μm thick polymer film as a UV cutoff filter (up to 394 nm) under one sun light soaking are shown in Fig. 10. Both devices show good stability following 2400 h of aging under the visible light soaking and retain over 95% of their initial efficiencies. Compared with the undoped DSC, a larger decrease is observed in the power conversion efficiency of the boron-doped DSC due to the drop in Voc. The result confirms that the increase of oxygen vacancies upon addition of boron slightly enhances the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Overall, the DSCs based on B-doped electrodes have a good stability and high efficiency, which offer new insight into the design of high performance solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a modified sol–gel method was developed to incorporate B into the nanostructure of the TiO2 electrode of DSCs. The prepared boron-doped TiO2 having controlled phase composition exhibited good surface morphology. Boron doping could improve the crystallinity of TiO2, which favors the injected electrons. Meanwhile, the boron doping in TiO2 reduced the valence of the titanium ion, and caused an increase in the oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, we found that the dye-sensitized boron-doped solar cell had a significant enhancement of the IPCE in the range 370–650 nm. Higher energy conversion efficiency, improved by 9%, was achieved for the dye-sensitized boron-doped TiO2 solar cell, and overall, the device based on the B-doped TiO2 electrode shows good stability following 2400 h of aging under the visible light soaking and retained over 95% of its initial efficiency.
