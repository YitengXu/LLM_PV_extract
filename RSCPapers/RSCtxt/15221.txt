    , Accepted 6th July 2022First published on 8th July 2022AbstractDeveloping ambient air and light stable metal halide perovskites could lead to tremendous progress in reducing energy waste and environmental damage through photocatalysis. In this work, we systematically investigated the structural stability of three all-inorganic lead halide perovskites (CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3) towards ambient air (O2); in particular, the role of light (photo-generated electrons and holes) in the perovskites' structural degradation was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation methods. We find that the adsorbed O2 molecule is strongly activated on these perovskite surfaces even in the dark. Our results show that the presence of photo-generated electrons and holes increases the strength of O2 adsorption; specifically, photo-generated electrons enhance the electrostatic interactions of these perovskite surfaces with O2, resulting in a larger activation effect. AIMD simulations clearly show that adsorbed O2 is readily activated on the surfaces of CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3, and Pb–O bonds form spontaneously in the presence of photo-generated electrons. Although the CsPbCl3 perovskite surface has greater adsorption strength and activation effect towards O2 in the presence of photo-generated electrons, it does not undergo light-induced structural degradation. Based on these results, we suggest that CsPbCl3 perovskite can be a promising photocatalyst material.
1. Introduction
The development of all-inorganic lead halide perovskites in the past decade has enabled the low-cost fabrication of a wide range of next-generation optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and photodetectors.1–4 Moreover, perovskite materials have recently emerged as a viable alternative to advanced functional materials in photocatalytic applications because of their ease of preparation, adjustable bandgaps, and high power conversion efficiencies.5–7 However, the inherent instability of fully inorganic perovskites during operation severely impedes their industrialization and commercialization.8,9 Poor stability is widely assumed to be the result of degradation caused by interactions with moisture in the ambient environment, and thus significant efforts have been made in the past to improve moisture stability.10–14
Bryant et al.15 previously demonstrated that exposure to light and oxygen is the primary cause of metal lead halide perovskite instability, and they have shown that light and oxygen induced degradation occurs faster than moisture induced degradation. Aristidou and co-workers16,17 have also shown that the photoactive layers of perovskites rapidly decomposed when exposed simultaneously to dry air and light. Similar phenomena have been reported in other studies.18–21 A recent theoretical study by the Prezhdo group revealed that a neutral oxygen molecule had little influence on the perovskite stability, whereas the superoxide (O−2) and peroxide (O2−2) species interact strongly with perovskites, forming O–Pb bonds and thereby accelerating perovskite surface degradation.22 It has also been shown that perovskite exposure to light enhances electron transfer to molecular oxygen, resulting in an increase in the rate of O−2 species formation.23,24
However, the interaction of perovskites with oxygen in the presence of light has been highly controversial. In earlier research, perovskites under an oxygen environment have been shown to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices by suppressing nonradiative electron–hole recombination.25–27 Brenes et al.28 reported that O−2 species are formed in the presence of light, and aid in the removal of shallow trap states at the perovskite surface, thereby increasing the device performance. Similarly, Kong et al. found that O–Pb bonds are primarily formed on the perovskite surface but are constrained to avoid the formation of PbO compounds and benefit the improvement of solar cell stability.29 Therefore, atomic-level understanding of the interaction of perovskite surfaces with oxygen in the presence of light is highly important for developing efficient photocatalysts for oxidative decomposition reactions, as they should maintain structural stability after producing stable O−2 and O2−2 radicals from the adsorbed molecular oxygen.30
In this work, we present a detailed investigation of the stability of all-inorganic perovskites (CsPbX3, where X = Cl, Br, and I) upon O2 exposure in the presence of light using first-principles calculations. In general, photocatalytic materials generate electron and hole pairs when they absorb a photon and undergo chemical oxidation and reduction mediated by photogenerated holes and electrons.31 Hence, here in particular to understand the effect of light on CsPbX3 perovskites in ambient air, we considered the presence of excess hole and electron polarons and explored the perovskites' structural stability using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations.
2. Computational details
In this study, all the spin-polarized first-principles calculations were carried out in the framework of DFT using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).32–34 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to describe the electron–ion interactions.35 The non-local optB86b-vdW exchange–correlation functional was used in this study, which explicitly includes effects of van der Waals forces.36–38 The cut-off energies of 550 and 400 eV were used for bulk and surface CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites, respectively. For the Brillouin zone integration, Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 6 × 4 × 6 and 6 × 6 × 4 were used for bulk CsPbCl3 and CsPbX3 (X = Br, I), respectively, and 3 × 2 × 1 and 3 × 3 × 1 K-points were used for CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br) and CsPbI3 perovskite surfaces, respectively.39 All the geometrical parameters are relaxed until the total energy is converged to 10−4 eV and the forces on each atom are smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1. A vacuum space of 15 Å was inserted along the z-direction to avoid the unnecessary influence of periodic atoms. The O2 adsorption energy (Eads) on the CsPbX3 surface was calculated as follows:Eads = (Etotal − Esurface − EO2)where Etotal, Esurface and EO2 are the overall energy of the O2 molecule adsorbed on the CsPbX3 surfaces, the energy of the clean slab surface, and the energy of the isolated oxygen molecule, respectively. Bader charge analysis was performed to calculate the electron transfer upon O2 adsorption.40,41 The calculated net atomic charges were used to calculate the electron transfer between the adsorbed O2 and the perovskite surfaces. The total number of electrons in the simulation cell was adjusted to simulate the perovskite systems with excess (less) electrons.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bulk and surface modeling of CsPbX3
Initially, we carried out structural relaxation of the orthorhombic bulk structures of CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I), and the optimized geometries are shown in Fig. 1S in the ESI.† The calculated lattice parameters and band gaps are given in Table 1. The optimized lattice parameters for CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskites are in good agreement with the respective experimental values.42–44 The calculated band gaps for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 perovskites are 2.65, 2.14, and 1.60 eV, respectively, which reasonably agree with the experimental values of 2.98, 2.20 and 1.69 eV.45–47 However, this fortuitous agreement is the result of error cancellation.48 To further understand the electronic properties of these three structures, we investigated the projected density of states (PDOS), which is shown in Fig. 2S.† It can be seen that the major contribution to the valence band maximum (VBM) for each system comes from the respective halogen atoms (Cl, Br, and I), whereas halogen atoms and Pb atoms contributed to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Furthermore, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were simulated to determine the phases of CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite materials. Fig. 3S† depicts the simulated and experimental XRD patterns,49–51 which clearly show that (121), (112), and (220) are the preferred planes for the orthorhombic CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 perovskite surfaces, respectively. Hence, the slab models of the CsPbCl3 (121), CsPbBr3 (112), and CsPbI3 (220) perovskite surfaces were constructed with three molecular layers by cleaving the corresponding optimized orthorhombic bulk structures and an appropriate stable termination of each perovskite surface was chosen based on the surface energy. The most stable CsPbCl3 terminated (121), CsPbBr3 terminated (112), and CsPbI3 terminated (220) perovskite surfaces are shown in Fig. 1. In all cases the adsorbate and the top two molecular layers of the slab were fully relaxed.

3.2. O2 adsorption on the perovskite surfaces in the dark
The analysis of O2 molecule adsorption on the perovskite surfaces is essential and can provide crucial information needed to improve the photocatalysts' structural stability. Therefore, we begin with the O2 adsorption on the perovskites in the absence of light (dark). The adsorption configurations of the O2 molecule on CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) surfaces were modeled by placing it on different possible sites of each surface, including top-Pb, top-Cs, and top-halide ions, and the hollow site. For the adsorption of O2, both side-on and end-on configurations were considered, and the adsorption energies (Eads) were calculated to determine the most energetically favorable adsorption sites. According to our computations, the side-on adsorption of O2 is preferred on the surfaces of all three considered perovskites. Table 2 provides the calculated Eads values, the shortest adsorption distance of O2 to the surface (dO2–S), the O2 interatomic distances (dO–O) and charge transfer (ΔQ) between O2 and the surfaces for the most stable adsorption configurations. Our calculation results indicate that the O2 molecule prefers to stably adsorb on the top-Pb sites of CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 surfaces, while it adsorbs on the hollow site of the CsPbI3 surface. The calculated O2 adsorption energies are −0.20, −0.22, and −0.17 eV for CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 surfaces, respectively. The most stable optimized structures of adsorbed O2 on the CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 perovskite surfaces are shown in Fig. 2. The calculated O2 adsorption energies for the other least stable configurations are given in Table 1S of the ESI.† We also tested the O2 adsorption energies with dipole corrections on the CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 surfaces for the most stable adsorption configurations and found that the values are similar. To validate our slab model, we also calculated the O2 adsorption on the CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 surfaces with four molecular layers, in which the top two molecular layers were fully relaxed. The calculated O2 adsorption energies on the four layers of CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 surfaces (Table 2S†) are identical to those on the three layer slab; thus, we considered these perovskite surfaces with three molecular layers for the subsequent calculations to reduce computational time. As can be seen from Table 2, the O2 molecule is more strongly adsorbed on the CsPbBr3 perovskite surface than on the other halide (Cl and I) perovskite surfaces, resulting in the electron transfer to the O2 molecule from the CsPbBr3 surface being significantly larger (0.082 |e|) than from the other surfaces. Due to the strong interaction between O2 and the perovskite surfaces, the bond length of O2 is elongated from 1.208 Å to 1.237, 1.240, and 1.235 Å on CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3, respectively. The O–O bond length (1.240 Å) in the CsPbBr3 surface is much longer than that in all other surfaces, implying stronger interactions between O2 and the CsPbBr3 perovskite surface and a large activation effect of CsPbBr3 on O2.

3.3. O2 adsorption on the perovskite surfaces in light
To better understand the role of light, the adsorption of O2 on CsPbX3 surfaces in the presence of light was studied. The complex photo-excited system was simplified in this study by considering the addition (removal) of an electron from the most stable CsPbX3 perovskite surfaces to simulate a photo-generated electron (hole), similar to recent studies on hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites.24,52,53 As the electron density difference (EDD) map can more clearly show the electron accumulation and depletion in the presence of excess electrons and holes, we also calculated the EDD. The obtained EDD plots for the three perovskite surfaces in the presence of excess 2e− and 2h+ are shown in Fig. 3, where the electron accumulation and depletion are indicated in yellow and blue, respectively. The electron densities are found to be largely accumulated on the Pb atom of all three perovskite surfaces, with more electron accumulation observed in CsPbCl3 perovskite than the others, implying that the Pb atom exhibits electron-rich behavior when exposed to light and is expected to interact strongly with O2. The appearance of blue around the surface halide ions indicates that the electron densities decrease in the presence of excess holes. The most stable O2 adsorption sites of all three perovskite surfaces in the dark are considered here; however, after structural optimization, O2 adsorption on the CsPbI3 surface is moved to the top-Pb site from the hollow site. The calculated Eads values, the shortest adsorption distance of O2 to the surface (dO2–S), and the O2 interatomic distances (dO–O) in the presence of excess electrons and holes are given in Table 3. The optimized geometrical structures of the most stable O2 adsorption on CsPbX3 surfaces in the presence of excess electrons and holes are shown in Fig. 4S–7S of the ESI.† It is seen that the presence of excess electrons and holes increases the adsorption energy of the O2 molecule on all three perovskite surfaces. The presence of excess electrons, in particular, significantly increases the O2 adsorption energy on perovskite surfaces when compared to excess holes. The largest O2 adsorption energy (−2.75 eV) is found on the CsPbCl3 surface with excess 2e−, which is approximately thirteen times more negative than that found in a dark environment (Table 2). The O–O bond length in the resulting complex is significantly increased to 1.523 Å from 1.208 Å, implying a stronger affinity of the CsPbCl3 perovskite surface and enhanced activity towards the O2 molecule in the presence of light. This observation is consistent with the previous theoretical study of Prezhdo et al., in which they demonstrated the conversion of superoxide (O−2) into peroxide (O2−2) upon gaining electrons, with O–O bond elongation to 1.522 Å.22 However, the CsPbI3 perovskite surface interacts with O2 less strongly than other surfaces in the presence of excess electrons, with O2 adsorption energies of −0.93 and −1.26 eV for excess 1e− and 2e−, respectively.

To gain further insights into the interaction of O2 with CsPbX3 surfaces in the presence of light, we have analyzed the electronic properties through the projected density of states (PDOS) and Bader charge analysis. Fig. 4 shows the PDOS of an O2 molecule adsorbed on the CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) surfaces both in dark and light environments (excess 2e− and 2h+). As can be seen from Fig. 4, the PDOS of an O2 molecule adsorbed on the three perovskite surfaces in the presence of 2 excess electrons are significantly different from that in the dark and in the presence of excess holes. The peak, in particular, corresponding to the O2 antibonding orbital 2π*, is shifted downward (below the Fermi level) and broadened with decreasing intensity, indicating more electron gain from the surface upon O2 adsorption in the presence of excess 2e−. Notably, the larger downshift of the 2π* band is observed in the case of O2 adsorption on CsPbCl3 (Fig. 4a) than on other surfaces, implying that O2 gains more electrons and thus the O–O bond is strongly activated. Table 3 also provides the amount of electron transfer between O2 and the three perovskite surfaces in the presence of excess electrons and holes, where negative and positive values represent the electron gain and loss, respectively. The Bader charge analysis reveals that the presence of excess electrons increases the electron transfer from the perovskite surfaces to the O2 molecule, whereas the presence of excess holes slightly decreases it when compared to that in the dark, indicating that the oxygen molecule is reduced to a larger extent upon its interaction with the perovskite surface in the presence of excess electrons. Furthermore, it is seen that the O2 molecule gains more electrons when the excess electrons are increased, and larger electron (−1.329 |e|) transfer is observed in the CsPbCl3 perovskite with excess 2e−, which agrees with the above PDOS results. The amount of electron transfer between O2 and the three perovskite surfaces is in accordance with the strength of their respective interactions (Eads) and O–O bond elongation (Table 3). These results indicate that the photo-generated electrons enhanced the electrostatic interactions of these perovskite surfaces with the O2 molecule, which is consistent with previous results.15,16

3.4. AIMD simulations
Gaining atomic level understanding of the structural degradation of perovskite surfaces induced by ambient oxygen and the photogenerated electrons/holes is experimentally challenging. However, the dynamic behavior of the O2 activation and the resulting structural changes of the perovskite surfaces under realistic conditions can be accurately predicted with the aid of AIMD simulations. Hence, we performed AIMD simulations on the O2 adsorbed on CsPbX3 (where X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite surfaces with photogenerated electrons under the canonical NVT ensemble within the DFT framework, as the presence of excess electrons enhanced the interactions between the perovskite surfaces and O2 molecule. In addition, AIMD simulations for O2 adsorbed on these three perovskite surfaces in the neutral case are performed for comparison. The optimized most stable adsorption configurations of O2 on the three perovskite surfaces for the neutral and excess 2e− cases are considered in AIMD simulations, with the one molecular layer of the slab model being fixed and the rest of the layers relaxed during the simulations. The Brillouin zone was sampled at the Γ-point, and the simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble (NVT) with the Nose–Hoover thermostat54 at 350 K for a time period of 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs. Selected snapshots of the simulated structural evolution of the three perovskite surfaces upon O2 adsorption with excess 2e− are shown in Fig. 5–7, respectively and their corresponding neutral case snapshots are shown in Fig. 8S–10S of the ESI.† A visual inspection of a series of snapshots extracted during the AIMD simulations at different time intervals ranging from 0 to 10 ps (Fig. 8S–10S†) reveals that, despite the interaction between O2 and surfaces, no superoxide species are formed and no noticeable structural degradation is observed following O2 adsorption on the surfaces in the neutral case. In contrast to the neutral case, the adsorbed O2 interacts strongly with the surface Pb atoms, which leads to the formation of Pb–O bonds and results in the deformation of the inorganic scaffold upon photogeneration of electrons (Fig. 5–7). This structural transformation does not occur immediately in CsPbCl3 perovskite upon its simultaneous exposure to O2 and excess electrons, as we observed the formation of Pb–O bonds only at 6 ps in our simulations. However, the Pb–O bonds are spontaneously formed when the CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 surfaces are exposed to O2 and excess electrons (within 4 and 2 ps, respectively), indicating that they are less stable against ambient air and light than the CsPbCl3 perovskite. To elucidate how the photogenerated electrons affect the O2 adsorption and thereby facilitate the perovskite structural degradation, we further analyzed the time evolutions of the distances between O2 and the surface Pb atoms (referred to as Pb1 and Pb2) and the nearby inter-atomic distances of perovskite surfaces, and they are shown in Fig. 8 and 9. The time evolution of Pb1–O1 and Pb2–O2 distances in Fig. 8b and c confirms that the Pb–O bonds form readily in the CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 surfaces, whereas it takes longer in the CsPbCl3 perovskite (Fig. 8a). The time evolution of the inter-atomic bond distances of perovskite surfaces plotted in Fig. 9a shows that after being exposed to O2 in the presence of excess electrons, the nearby surface atom distances in CsPbCl3 perovskite (Pb1–Cl1, Pb1–Cl2, and Pb1–Cs) basically remain at their positions at the end of the simulations (10 ps), whereas the interatomic bond distances in CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 surfaces (Fig. 9b and c) are gradually elongated from their equilibrium value with simulation time, revealing structural deformation at the end of the simulation. A novel photocatalyst perovskite material should maintain its structural stability after producing the O−2 radical from adsorbed molecular oxygen.30 Based on our calculated results (Table 2), the CsPbCl3 perovskite surface is more likely to activate adsorbed O2 and convert it into superoxide species. However, it is structurally more stable than the other two surfaces, as no visible degradation is observed in AIMD snapshots, suggesting that the CsPbCl3 perovskite could be a potential catalyst material for photocatalysis applications.

4. Conclusions
In this work, the structural stability of three all-inorganic metal halide perovskites (CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3) upon their simultaneous exposure to ambient air and light has been investigated by DFT calculations and AIMD simulations towards developing novel photocatalytic materials. Our calculations show that when these perovskite surfaces were exposed to an oxygen-only environment, they strongly activated O2. The presence of photo-generated electrons and holes increased the O2 adsorption strength, and we find that the photo-generated electrons significantly enhanced the electrostatic interactions of these perovskite surfaces with O2 compared to holes. Our AIMD simulations show in detail that adsorbed O2 is easily activated on the CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 surfaces, and Pb–O bonds formed spontaneously in the presence of photo-generated electrons, indicating their poor stability towards O2 in the presence of light. The calculated results show that the CsPbCl3 perovskite surface has greater adsorption strength and activation effect towards O2 in the presence of photo-generated electrons, and it is also structurally stable under light illumination. Thus, it is expected that the CsPbCl3 perovskite surface could be a stable catalyst for photocatalysis applications.
