    , Accepted 17th July 2022First published on 18th July 2022AbstractHere, a scheme that aptly describes the reduction of gold nanoparticles’ crystalline size on the surface of MWCNTs in an aqueous phase to generate a LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure, employing an Nd:YAG laser (energy = 505 mJ and λ = 1064 nm) is developed. Such a LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure results in the development of an easy electrochemical procedure based on voltammetry analysis for ultra-sensitive glutathione sensing. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to examine the composition and morphology of laser-ablated adhesion of AuNPs over the MWCNT heterostructure. With a wide dynamic range of 0.1–9 μmol L−1, the LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure can detect glutathione with a high sensitivity of 0.1186 μA (μmol L−1)−1 at the low limit of detection (LLOD; 0.93 μmol L−1). It improves electron transfer and promotes redox reactions by increasing the conductivity and surface area. The findings show that the fabricated LAMWCNT-Au/GCE is an effortless and potent biosensing prototype for the identification of glutathione (GSH) at a negative potential in a neutral medium. The substantial synergistic surface impact produced by the introduction of AuNPs over MWCNTs exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic activity in comparison with individual MWCNT and AuNP. Moreover, the LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure has excellent selectivity, long-term stability, and reproducibility, and it can easily separate target molecules that were identified using various voltammetric analyses.
1. Introduction
Thiols, sulphur-containing compounds with a low molecular weight, have long been known to be a vital family of molecules that perform intracellular and extracellular functions as well as modulate a wide range of physiological activities in life forms. The sulfhydryl group (also called the thiol group, –SH) is an integral part of redox-mediated or controlled processes, including antioxidant defense, protein synthesis, human metabolism, cofactors for thiol-based enzymes, and so on.1 Glutathione is a nonprotein thiolated peptide with lower molecular weight thiol comprising three peptides glycine, cysteine, and glutamate (γ-glutamyl cysteinyl glycine) abundantly distributed in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, in a concentration range of 0.5–10 mM.2 Sulfhydryl and disulphide are the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione, respectively, which remain in a redox equilibrium. In healthy tissues and cells, the reduced form stands for above 90% of the whole glutathione pool, whereas the disulphide form stands below 10%.3 GSH plays a crucial role in defense against oxidative/nitrosative stress, protein and DNA synthesis, bio-reductive processes, and cell growth and function, and assists in the regulation of cell communication across gap junctions, enzyme activity, detoxification metabolism, amino acid transport, and typically inhibits the oxidation of protein-SH groups and crosslinking to name a few.4
Numerous clinical investigations have investigated the connection between GSH and various disorders, including diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, psychiatric disorders, aging, arthritis, epilepsy, atherosclerosis, HIV infection, neurotoxicity, and macular degeneration, in addition to a variety of cancers like colorectal and breast cancer.5 These pathologies are often identified by alterations in GSH concentration levels. The reliable and precise analysis of GSH is vitally crucial in delivering suitable treatment to patients, based on the correlation between the GSH content and the aforesaid numerous medical issues. Various critical evaluation techniques have been effectively established in this regard, including spectrophotometry,6,7 titrimetry,8 high-performance liquid chromatography,9,10 spectrofluorimetry,11–13 proton nuclear magnetic resonance,14 enzymatic methods, capillary zone electrophoresis,15 and flow injection analysis.16 Such procedures, on the other hand, are lengthy and/or expensive, and frequently necessitate complicated sample pre-processing. Electrochemical techniques17–19 are a significant tool for simple determination due to GSH's electrochemical activity. Because of their economical nature, miniaturized adaptability, and effortless operation, such approaches have intrinsic selectivity over GSH and overcome the drawbacks of spectral and separation methods.
Due to poor signal responsiveness caused by metal electrode passivation, poor heterogeneous rates of electron transfer, and overpotential, the use of bare electrodes has drawbacks in precise, sensitive, and efficient studies of GSH. Modifying the electrodes is one of the most fundamental solutions to tackle all the challenges listed above during the analysis of GSH. The electrode is fabricated by employing a range of redox-active mediators that facilitate electron shuttling across electrodes and analytes, electrode surface fouling, and reducing overpotential.1 Furthermore, due to certain exceptional characteristics such as an increased surface area, mechanical strength, and enhanced catalytic performance, nanostructured materials have attracted huge attention over the last couple of decades due to their exceptional qualities and have since been constantly and consistently employed as excellent electron intermediaries for the design and manufacture of immensely selective and sensitive electrochemical biosensors.20,21 Consequently, thorough use of a selection of nanoparticles and chemical regulators results in a fundamental and practicable prototype for GSH electrochemical analysis by exhibiting significant differentiation over conventional electrodes, such as greater absorption on reaction sites, highly effective surface areas, enhanced mass transport and catalysis, and high porosity.22–27
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were widely employed in the fabrication of surface modified working electrodes for the measurement of GSH, including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). CNTs are by far the most actively used nanotechnology building components after their invention in 1991.28 In comparison to conventional materials, carbon nanotubes are well-suited for practically every application requiring properties like high strength, durability, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and light weight. CNTs could increase the electrochemical reactivity of key analytes while also protecting surface fouling.29 CNTs’ astounding electrochemical qualities make them appropriate for use in faradaic processes like MWCNTs' rapid electron transfer kinetics attributed to the prevalence of edge plane graphitic sites at the ends and inside the walls of MWCNTs as well as non-faradaic processes like huge variations in conductance when MWCNTs can withdraw/accept charges from/to compounds in their surrounding environment.30 MWCNTs' combined strong electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, chemical stability, and biocompatibility, and simplicity of modification improves the intensity and resolution of electroanalytical signals on working platforms.31,32
Numerous methods for functionalizing carbon nanotubes are particularly important for developing novel sensor and biosensor devices with specific electrochemical performance. This can be accomplished by combining CNTs with noble metals i.e., a metal (Ag, Au, Pt, etc.) NP/CNT composite, which is shown to increase various electrochemical outputs like high surface area, excellent conductivity, low toxicity, and biocompatibility of the derived sensing devices when used with a variety of analytes.33–37 AuNPs are recognized to generate a favourable microenvironment for biomolecule immobilization, keeping their biological activity while guaranteeing appropriate distribution and closeness to the surface of the electrode.38 Each of these characteristics has resulted in improved biocompatibility, sensitivity, and stability of biosensors built using these hybrid nanocomposites over comparable techniques that use only CNTs.
Several studies have been published on the employment of CNTs as an excellent support because of their mechanical strength, massive electrical conductivity, stability, and large surface area.39 This has been enhanced by the collaborative usage of AuNPs anchored to MWCNT scaffolds, which have the combined features of both.40 Electrodeposition, microwave methods, direct evaporation coating, sonochemical methods, a variety of chemical functionalization methods, electrostatic force driven assembly, and ball-milling procedures are time-consuming, result in toxic by-products, require stabilizing or reducing agents, result in low purity of synthesized nanostructures, compared to preparation of nanostructuces via laser ablation (LA).41–46 Laser ablation in liquids for the production of nanomaterials is a modern technique, and has been established recently.47 Laser ablation is a unique method for the nanofabrication of nanoparticles, and it is one of the green approaches for manufacturing metal nanoparticles. The nanosecond pulsed laser-ablation (ns-PLA) methodology is regarded as a green, low-cost, and adaptable approach due to its tight liquid confinement for laser ablation. Besides, it does not need an ultra-high vacuum or inert environment and does not produce any harmful by-products. It uses a pulsed laser beam to ablate a particle contained in a solvent, which is commonly utilized for the fabrication of NPs in heterogeneous disciplines. The essential parameters to produce metal nanoparticles are energy, wavelength, repetition rate of the laser, ablation time, and absorption of an aqueous solution. Higher wavelengths lead to significantly higher ablation efficiency and finer nanoparticles, whereas high laser power can allow the penetration more quickly and thereby the higher rate of generation of nanoparticles. Also, the process can be fine-tuned to produce NPs of various properties and sizes, NPs may be produced in a range of solvents, the NPs can be exceedingly pure, mainly no surfactant is necessary to stabilize the colloid, and high production rates, good particle size control and good monodispersity can be achieved.48,49
Herein, a one-step and facile technique established on ns-PLA directed self-assembly of a high-density array of AuNPs over MWCNTs was used to fabricate an easy and customizable electrochemical GSH biosensor. The conducting laser-ablated multiwalled carbon nanotube–gold (LAMWCNT-Au) nanocomposite was generated by the reduction method with the assistance of a laser. The LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and square wave voltammetry (SWV) to investigate its morphology, elementary composition, electrochemical performance, and stability, and interference study. Moreover, the fabricated LAMWCNT-Au/GCE biosensor was utilized to determine GSH in biological matrices. The platform provides consistent and strong reliability when it comes to electrochemical biosensing of GSH.
2. Experimental section

Analytical grade chemicals have been used and were utilized without being purified further. Deionized water with a resistivity of at least 18.2 M cm−1 was used to make all the solutions.
2.2. Instrumentation

2.2.1. Electrochemical instrumentation. 
GSH was detected electrochemically using the CHI 650C electrochemical workstation (Austin, DX, USA), which consists of three electrodes (a glassy carbon electrode (fabricated) as the working electrode (3 mm diameter), Ag/AgCl saturated with KCl as the reference electrode (3 M KCl), and a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode) in contact with the analyte solution in the electrochemical cell, and all the tests were conducted at ambient temperature (27 ± 3 °C).


2.2.2. Physicochemical instrumentation. 
Morphology observations were employed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), model FEI Tecnai 20 G2. The absorption spectra in the UV-vis range 200–800 nm were measured utilizing a Specord 600S diode array ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Jena, Germany). The Raman spectrum was recorded with a Horiba Raman spectrometer, the Lab RAM HR Evolution. For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) research such as the chemical states of the elements studied, a Physical Electronics PHI 5600 with monochromatic Al Kα (photon energy = 1361 eV) was employed.

2.3. Synthesis of the nanosecond pulsed laser-ablated multiwalled carbon nanotubes-gold (LAMWCNT-Au) heterostructure
This study attempts the laser ablation method to synthesize a LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure, which is a streamlined and ecologically benign technique. The pulsed laser ablation of LAMWCNT-Au is schematically presented in Scheme 1. The laser beam transformed Au3+ to AuNPs in the first step. Finally, the produced AuNPs adhered to the MWCNTs’ surface. More detailed descriptions are provided in the paragraph that follows.
 Scheme 1  A schematic illustration for the synthesis of laser-ablated MWCNT-Au nanoparticles. 
A standard solution of HAuCl4·3H2O (5 mmol L−1) was prepared. In a flask containing 15 mg of MWCNT, 20 mL of the HAuCl4·3H2O standard solution was added. The weight ratio between Au and MWCNT is taken as 2:1. This prepared suspension was irradiated for 1 hour with a second harmonic wavelength of 1064 nm and an energy of 505 mJ from an Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, Quanta-Ray, Model Pro 230-10; unfocused ray with a repetition rate of 10 Hz, pulse duration 10 ns) and prevent gravitational settling by allowing carbon particles to circulate at a rotating speed of about 450 rpm.50,51 The laser beam has an energy density of 0.131 J cm−2 and a diameter of 0.95 cm. The laser-ablated Au nanoparticles adhering to multiwalled carbon nanotubes (LAMWCNT-Au) were first washed with deionized water, and then with ethanol by centrifugation. The filtered catalyst was dried overnight in an air oven at 80 °C to expel excess moisture. Pristine laser-ablated Au nanoparticles (LAAu) without MWCNT and laser-ablated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (LAMWCNT) suspended in an aqueous medium without Au were prepared using a similar method for control experiments, maintaining all other experimental parameters constant.
2.4. Fabrication of the LAMWCNT-Au GC electrode
The electrochemical assays were performed at ambient temperature in a pH 7 0.1 M PBS solution. The surface of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was delicately polished to a mirror-like finish prior-to studies utilizing alumina (α-Al2O3) slurries with pore sizes of 1, 0.3, and 0.05 μm. After that, Millipore water was utilized to rinse the electrode. The electrode was then fabricated by drop-casting a 10 μL aliquot of the produced LAMWCNT-Au suspension (1 mg of LAMWCNT-Au in 1 ml of deionized water) onto the surface of pre-treated bare GC electrodes and the substance was mounted onto the GCE surface after the working electrode was dried in the air at room temperature. Finally, before obtaining electrochemical measurements, each fabricated GCE was coated with the binder, 2 μL of a Nafion solution, and dried under ambient conditions. For comparison, a bare GCE, LAAu/GCE, and LAMWCNT/GCE were also fabricated likewise for GSH oxidation.
2.5 Electrochemical detection conditions
In a 10.0 mL suspension containing 5 mmol L−1 [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− in 0.1 mol L−1 KCl as an electrochemical probe, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment were performed. CV was carried out at a pace of scan of 50 mV s−1 in a potential range from −0.2 to 0.6 V. EIS was performed using a potential of 0.3 V and an amplitude of 5 mV throughout a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz. CV measurements were also performed in 5.0 mL PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) containing 0.05 mmol L−1 GSH in a scan range of −0.8 V to 0.6 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to quantify various GSH concentrations in a 5.0 mL PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) solution. The scan range was −0.4 V to 0.4 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, and the pulse duration, pulse width, and quiet time were 0.5 seconds, 0.05 seconds, and 2 seconds, respectively. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) readings were recorded in a 5.0 mL PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) solution containing 0.05 mmol L−1 GSH in the scan range from −0.6 V to 0.4 V at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1, with a frequency of 15 Hz and a quiet time of 2 s, respectively. Before the studies, the electrolyte PBS buffer must be well purged with nitrogen gas. The measurement was conducted a minimum of three times for each GSH concentration.
2.6 Actual sample collection and analysis
For accurate GSH identification, GSH supplements available on the market (with a labeled quantity of 500 mg of GSH per capsule) were employed. A licensed medical facility in India provided GSH supplements. Lactose monohydrate, triacetin, croscarmellose sodium, diethyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate are the key ingredients in the tablet, in addition to GSH. Ultrasonication was used to dissolve the tablets in water. As a stock solution, 10 mL aqueous solution of 0.1 M GSH was prepared. Then, for GSH identification, a specified quantity of GSH stock solution was introduced to a PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) electrochemical vessel.
The recovery percentage was evaluated by examining spiked stock solution as per the recommended measurement methods: (1)where SSpiked is the measured GSH quantity (μg mL−1) in the spiked stock and RReal is the measured GSH quantity (μg mL−1) in the actual sample solution
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Mechanism, microstructure, morphology, and characterization of synthesized materials
The absorption of the incident photon, which can result in the warming up and photoionization of the bombarded region, is the primary step in the laser ablation of the target. Replacement reactions generated by lasers, fast nucleation, and development processes all play a role in the reduction of metals. As a result of inverse Bremsstrahlung or photoionization processes, many electrons are pulled out when a powerful laser pulse encounters the metal. Thus, the sample will be depleted of electrons, resulting in the existence of excess ions. The expelled electrons undergo oscillation and interact with target spots, releasing some energy to the lattice surrounding them. Thus, due to inverse Bremsstrahlung or photoionization processes, gold precursors were reduced to Au nanoparticles after laser ablation. Generally, in an aqueous solution, laser irradiation produces radicals (H˙) and electrons (e−), thereby reducing the Au precursor to Au nanoparticles. Au3+ + 3e−aq → Au0(2) Au3+ + 3H˙ → Au0 + 3H+(3)
After the mixtures were laser irradiated, the MWCNT was decorated with gold metal nanoparticles due to the laser-heating of the nanosized particles causes boiling or melting, as well as sub-division into small units and atoms, thereby adhering to the MWCNTs. Like the interaction that occurs when the surface of the carbon material is subjected to a flow of metal atoms or their clusters through evaporation coating, the mechanism of adhesion is perhaps most probably physical rather than chemical.52–55
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses were used to investigate the microstructure and morphology of produced LAMWCNT-Au. The findings of AuNP incorporation on MWCNT are shown in Fig. 1. The different lattices of AuNPs indicate that they are crystalline in nature. The Au nanoparticles are tightly bonded to the MWCNTs during laser ablation and have a 5 ± 2 nm crystalline size with a d-spacing of 0.22 nm, indicating that gold nanoparticles with a spherical shape are uniformly scattered across the MWCNT surface without undergoing any fusion into bigger particles (Fig. 1a–c). The tube structure of the MWCNT is retained, and high-density deposition of Au nanoparticles occurs, resulting in a highly sensitive and selective GSH biosensor. Fig. 1d shows the diffraction pattern produced from AuNPs, with circles equivalent to gold's face-centered cubic (fcc) structure's (111), (200), (311), and (220) reflections.56,57Fig. 2 shows a bright-field TEM image of fabricated LAMWCNT-Au with appropriate elemental colour mapping of C and Au. Carbon and gold signals were detected in the LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure in the EDX spectrum, implying that gold nanoparticles are coupled to carbon nanotubes. This attests to the target material's (LAMWCNT-Au) successful preparation.

 Fig. 2  The first image is the EDX spectra of LAMWCNT-Au and the remaining are the elemental color mapping of Au and C. 
The absorption spectra of LAAu nanoparticle solution and as-prepared LAMWCNT-Au nanocomposites are depicted in Fig. 3. The typical maximum absorption peak at 560 nm (spherical morphology) in the UV-Vis spectra of pristine AuNPs, as shown in Fig. 3a, was caused by its surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A noticeable widening and minor redshift of the plasmon resonance spectrum was found in AuNPs decorated with MWCNTs, which can be related to covalent interactions between the walls of MWCNTs and gold NPs (Fig. 3b). Interparticle plasmon coupling is responsible for the minor redshift in the SPR band, which can be seen even when only a few AuNPs remain close.58,59 As indicated by the TEM scans of the LAMWCNT-Au nanocomposite, a few of these surface-fabricated gold nanoparticles are in immediate contact with one another but are not agglomerated. Thus, the manufacture of LAMWCNT-Au through laser ablation is proved by the absorption spectra. These results are in line with those obtained by the TEM examination, indicating that nanoparticles were created by adopting a laser ablation method.
 Fig. 3  UV-visible absorption spectra of laser ablated gold nanoparticles (a) and laser ablated gold nanoparticles decorated with MWCNT (b). 
Raman spectroscopy was utilized to evaluate the development of LAMWCNT-Au nanoparticles generated by the laser ablation method. Results of the Raman analysis of LAMWCNT and LAMWCNT-Au are depicted in Fig. 4. LAMWCNT has two major peaks at 1340 cm−1 and 1562 cm−1, which correspond to the unique D and G bands, respectively, which are typical Raman characteristics for carbon nanotubes (Fig. 4a). The degree of graphitization can be addressed using the G band, which is associated with the E2g vibration mode of sp2 carbon domains, whereas the D band is linked to the partially disordered sp2 domain structure and other structural flaws.60 LAMWCNT-Au has two notable peaks, as shown in Fig. 4b, at 1340 cm−1 and 1586 cm−1. In the LAMWCNT (overtone of the D mode; 2D band), disorder generated by the tube curvature has a prominent and wide peak at around 2660 cm−1.61 When MWCNT is laser-ablated, plasma creates high pressure, which disrupts the C–C links in different regions of the MWCNT.62,63 It seems like destruction took place in MWCNTs, as evidenced by the presence of comparable intensity of D and G bands with nearly merged peaks. In the Raman spectra, a disorder in carbon materials is commonly measured in terms of the ID/IG ratio. The ID/IG ratios of LAMWCNT and LAMWCNT-Au were determined to be 1.01 and 0.9790, respectively. The lowered ID/IG ratio indicates that the structural integrity of the graphitic scaffolding has been successfully restored. In addition to the three peaks (D, G, and 2D), LAMWCNT-Au exhibits a fourth peak at 794 cm−1, which corresponds to the Au–C vibrational mode caused by Au adhering to the MWCNT surface.64 Furthermore, the lowered intensity of the G band in the LAMWCNT-Au heterostructure is due to the alignment of Au nanoparticles on the MWCNT surface. These data well match the TEM results.

XPS tests were performed to fully understand gold adhering to multiwalled carbon nanotubes, including the chemical nature of LAMWCNT-Au. Fig. S1(A)† illustrates survey spectra of LAAu, that exhibit Au 4f peaks. Fig. S1(B)† includes two Au 4f peaks at 83.20 eV and 86.91 eV, which are designated as Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively. Fig. 5a illustrates the survey spectra of LAMWCNT-Au, that exhibit Au 4f and C 1s peaks with no impurities. Fig. 5b includes two Au 4f peaks at 83.29 eV and 87.98 eV, which are designated as Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively.65 The C 1s high-resolution XPS spectra of LAMWCNT-Au in Fig. 5c highlight the key peaks of binding energies at 284.64 eV (applies to the C–C bond) and 285.71 eV (relates to the C–O bond), denoting that the morphological characteristics of MWCNT have been preserved.

These characterizations demonstrated the effective synthesis of AuNPs decorated MWCNTs, implying that they will have a reliable surface for purposes such as biosensors or biomolecule sensors.
3.2. Electrochemical characterization of fabricated electrodes towards GSH oxidation
The electrochemical studies of the surface-modified working electrode were explored utilizing CV and EIS. The transformation of the bare/GCE and fabricated electrodes was examined using the CV method (Fig. 6). A couple of redox peaks proportional to the redox couple [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− were visible in the CV of all fabricated working electrodes and bare GCE. At the bare/GCE, a couple of clear-cut quasi-reversible peaks are included in Fig. 6A, and the peak potential (ΔEp) separation is comparatively higher with the minimal baseline current, owing to the poor electronic conductivity and thereby obstructing electron transfer. The present peaks significantly increase when the GC working electrode surface is fabricated with the as-synthesized LAAu and LAMWCNT, particularly in comparison to the bare electrode, but ΔEp does not change significantly, implying a substantial peak-to-peak separation. The LAMWCNT-Au fabricated GC working electrode has a smaller peak-to-peak separation i.e., anodic and cathodic peaks, and the high baseline currents imply that the rate of electron kinetics has been enhanced, resulting in better electrochemical catalytic behaviour. These findings indicate that the LAMWCNT-Au fabricated GC electrode's greater surface area dramatically increases the electron and mass transfer by introducing an additional conduction path. Following that, Fig. 6B features a set of CV curves acquired in the KCl-ferricyanide medium at different scan rates (10–100 mV s−1) to investigate the redox behavior of the fabricated electrode, with the inserted graph showing the development of current density vs. the square root of the scan rate. The LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode shows a spectacular rise in peak current in proportion to the square root of the scan rate, when compared to other fabricated working electrodes, implying a diffusion-controlled process.66–68 Using the Randles–Sevcik equation, the electrochemically active surface area (EASA) of the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE is measured utilizing eqn (4):69 ip = 2.69 × 105n3/2AD1/2C υ1/2(4)where ip denotes the peak current, C denotes the [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− molecule concentration in mol L−1, D denotes the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), n denotes the electron transfer number, A denotes EASA (cm2), and υ denotes the scan rate (V s−1). For the bare/GCE, LAAu/GCE, LAMWCNT/GCE, and LAMWCNT-Au/GCE, the EASA values were found to be 0.0708, 0.1060, 0.1280, and 0.3958 cm2, respectively. Such findings confirmed that the manufactured LAMWCNT-Au/GCE had a greater EASA than other fabricated working electrodes and was expected to support the glutathione electrochemical reaction. As a result, LAMWCNT-Au/GCE was responsible for transporting electrons and was a promising candidate for enhancing GSH's electrochemical oxidation behaviour.

(B) The variation of peak current as a function of the scan rate (10–100 mV s−1). The inset graph shows the variation of peak current vs. square root of the scan rate. 
EIS was also utilized to clarify the features like electron transfer occurring at the surface-fabricated working electrodes and, as a result, to scrutinize the interfacial features of the fabricated electrode, i.e., the electron transfer kinetic parameter of the synthesized electrocatalyst samples. This strategy has gained significant popularity in the analytical field of sciences due to its ability to provide extra information about the reaction kinetics and membrane/solution structure. The outcomes of the EIS evaluation and the corresponding Nyquist plots are illustrated in Fig. 7. Meanwhile, in the inset of Fig. 7, the impedance data were fitted based on the Randles equivalent circuit model, where Rs denotes the solution resistance, Ret denotes the electron transfer resistance between the working electrode and the solution, C denotes the electrode double-layer capacitance at the electrode/solution interface, and W denotes the Warburg impedance.70 At higher frequencies, a semicircle part relates to the electron transfer-limited process, while a linear portion in the lower frequency range correlates to the diffusion-limited process in the Nyquist plot of the impedance profile. The diameter of the semicircle in the impedance profile represents Ret. At the electrode interface, the electron-transfer kinetics of the redox pair is governed by this resistance. As a result, the Ret value can be utilized to characterize the fabricated electrode's interfacial properties.71 Table S1† summarises the resistance values obtained. The area at low frequency is related to Warburg impedance because of the diffusion process of substances. Warburg resistance (W) is the linear portion at low frequencies that is related to a diffusion process in the electrolyte and thereby transport towards the working electrode. The lower the Rs value, the better the electrode/electrolyte interface's ionic conductivity. The ionic and electronic resistances, as well as the diffusion and contact resistances of the equipped electrodes, all contribute to the solution resistance.72 Because of the MWCNT's excellent conductivity, the Ret value of MWCNT/GCE decreased noticeably, and the semicircle region is almost non-existent. Also due to the conducting nature of MWCNT and its large surface area, analyte diffusion is made possible. As a result, Ret for LAMWCNT was lower than bare GCE. In agreement with the CV results, the modification of GCE with LAMWCNT-Au produced a pretty-much straight line denoting negligible electron-transfer resistance, indicating a synergetic effect of these two nanomaterial modifiers. The following is a list of the measured Ret values: bare/GCE > LAAu/GCE > LAMWCNT/GCE > LAMWCNT-Au/GCE, suggesting that the conductive fabricated LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode can improve electron transfer of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−i.e., the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE has greater efficacy than the other working electrodes, indicating that the LAWMCNT-Au/GCE has a higher number of active sites. All the results indicate that the LAMWCNT-Au with magnificent conductivity can significantly increase the rate of electron transfer between the redox probe and the electrode surface. The findings indicate that the manufactured materials could be used to monitor GSH.

GSH CV responses were investigated further under ideal working conditions. Initially, the bare/GC electrode fails to generate any characteristic redox peaks against the analyte in the selected potential window (Fig. 8). The sluggish electron transfer kinetics may be to blame for the poor voltammetric response at the bare GCE. This indicates that bare/GCE shows very little electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of GSH (curve a). A small broad peak was observed at 0.04 and −0.03 V for LAAu/GCE and LAMWCNT/GCE, respectively (curves b and c). As a result, when compared to the bare electrode, such nanomaterials display enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to GSH oxidation by providing multiple active sites that successfully speed up the amount of electron transfer between the analyte and electrodes. This evidence suggests that MWCNTs and AuNPs play an important role in the oxidation of GSH using fabricated electrodes. Similarly, a distinguishable anodic peak appeared at −0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the LAMWCNT-Au constructed GC electrode (curve d), with a negative shift and substantial increase in the current. And a distinguishable cathodic peak appeared at −0.25 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) during the reverse scan.73–75 The CV anodic peak current at the LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode is 1.76, 28, and 145 times greater than those at the LAMWCNT/GCE, LAAu/GCE, and bare/GCE, respectively. This finding implies that LAMWCNT-Au had strong electrocatalytic activity for GSH oxidation that could be explained by the synergistic effect of AuNPs and MWCNTs, which accelerated electron transfer between the working electrodes and analyte. Hence, the synergistic effect of distinct and combined functionalities of AuNPs and MWCNTs in the fabricated LAMWCNT-Au nanocomposite is responsible for the significant progress in the LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode performance. Based on the findings, it can be stated that LAMWCNT-Au can increase the rate of electron transfer for the oxidation of GSH and have greater electrocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 8  Evaluation of GSH oxidation on differently modified electrodes using CV studies in 0.1 mol L−1 PBS (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1: (a) bare/GC, (b) LAAu/GC, (c) LAMWCNT/GC, and (d) LAMWCNT-Au/GC. 
At a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, Fig. S2† includes the response of the peak current values of fabricated working electrodes with and without adding 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH in a 0.1 M PBS solution. In the absence of GSH, LAAu/GCE, LAMWCNT/GCE, and LAMWCNT-Au/GCE show a negligible number of redox peaks. In the presence of GSH, LAAu/GCE shows remarkable oxidation capability at around 0.04 V, while LAMWCNT/GCE exhibits substantial oxidation capability at around −0.03 V (Fig. S2A and B†). For the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE different concentration studies (0.05, 2, 3, and 5 mmol L−1 GSH) are performed. Current values of each peak were proven to increase as the concentration of GSH in the electrochemical cell continued to increase. In the presence of GSH, however, a sharp anodic (oxidation) peak at −0.05 V and a cathodic (reduction) current peak at −0.23 V were observed for the fabricated LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode, which was associated with the oxidation of GSH and a subsequent reduction of disulfide, respectively (Fig. S2C†). The LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode nanocomposite, in contrast, showed a distinct response for electrooxidation, implying that it had significant electrocatalytic activity for the GSH biomolecule. The electrooxidation response of the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE to GSH is typical, indicating that this nanoparticle composite has excellent electrocatalytic performance for GSH sensing. As previously stated, the incorporation of gold onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes has a synergistic effect in LAMWCNT-Au, which is a key element for boosting electron transfer and facilitating redox reactions.
The sensing of GSH was also carried out using DPV, which has a better resolution and is much more sensitive than CV (Fig. 9). In 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH at pH = 7, only a mild baseline current was measured at the bare GCE (curve a). LAAu/GCE has a relatively broad and less well-defined peak at 0.03 V (curve b), whereas LAMWCNT/GCE has a wider peak at −0.1 V for the oxidation of GSH (curve c). LAMWCNT-Au/GCE, on the other hand, has a sharply defined peak at −0.01 V (curve d) with a much greater current than both LAAu/GCE and LAMWCNT/GCE. The CV peak intensities at the LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode are 2.62, 5.14, and 9.61 times greater than those at the LAMWCNT/GCE, LAAu/GCE, and bare/GCE, respectively. The fact that the fabricated LAMWCNT-Au/GCE has a lower applied potential, and a greater current indicates that it has good electrocatalytic performance for glutathione oxidation.
 Fig. 9  Evaluation of GSH oxidation on differently modified electrodes using DPV studies in 0.1 mol L−1 PBS (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1: (a) bare/GC, (b) LAAu/GC, (c) LAMWCNT/GC, and (d) LAMWCNT-Au/GC electrodes. 
Furthermore, square wave voltammetry was used to investigate this claim. This technique is frequently used to improve the voltammetric resolution of the working electrode processes.76Fig. 10 illustrates a detailed SW voltammetric response of GSH (0.5 mmol L−1) documented in pH 7.0 0.1 M PBS. The gross SW component, which is measured as the significant gap between the cathodic and anodic currents, includes details for both the reduction and oxidation half-cell reactions and appears as a separate bell-shaped graph having a peak potential of Ep = 0.016 V. The LAMWCNT/GCE working electrode had a significantly greater current response than the LAAu/GC and LAMWCNT/GC working electrodes, according to the findings. The synergy effect and high electrochemical surface area of LAMWCNT-Au/GCE especially in comparison to other working electrodes, which considerably enhanced the electrocatalytic GSH oxidation, could explain the increased current.

The influence of the scan rate at the LAMWCNT-Au fabricated GCE was investigated employing CV in 0.1 M PBS pH = 7.0 solution by adding 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH (Fig. 11), which shows both cathodic and anodic GSH peaks, demonstrating that the oxidation of GSH on the manufactured working electrode is reversible. Current values of redox peaks of GSH are shown to increase linearly as steadily increasing the scan rate from 10 to 200 mV s−1. In the range observed, redox peak intensity is uniformly increased proportionately to the square root of scan rate (ν1/2), as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 11. The following linear regression formulas were achieved for both the anodic and cathodic zones: y = 121.76x − 11.703; R2 = 0.9902 and y = −123.63x + 8.3884 (R2 = 0.9910), respectively. The electro-oxidation/reduction of GSH at the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE, as shown by the linear correlations shown in Scheme 2, is a surface-controlled process, as it is represented by eqn (5)–(7). GSH ↔ GS− + H+(5) GS− → GS˙ + e−(6) 2GS˙ → GS–SG(7)

Detection conditions: 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH in 0.1 mol L−1 PBS (pH 7.0). The inset graph shows the variation of peak current as a function of the square root of the scan rate.

The reaction involving electron transfer at the modified working electrode and thus the response confirms the redox peak in the CV and DPV curves.
With the increase in the concentration at the LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode, dynamic range and low limit of detection of GSH were examined utilizing DPV, as shown in Fig. 12. GSH concentrations in 0.1 mol L−1 PBS solution ranging from 0.1 to 9 μmol L−1 are verified at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. As the concentration of the analyte increases, so does the response current (Fig. 12A). Current values of each peak were proven to increase in a linear manner as the concentration of GSH in the electrochemical cell continued to increase. The inset graph in Fig. 12B proves that redox peak currents in the measured range are proportional to increasing concentration. The following peak linear regression equation was acquired: I(GSH) (μA) = 0.1186 C(GSH) (μmol L−1) + 1.924; R2 = 0.9913. The linear range for GSH sensing is 0.1–9 μmol L−1, with a low limit of detection of 0.93 μmol L−1 and sensitivity of 0.1186 μA (μmol L−1)−1. A strong linear response, detection limit, and sensitivity to various GSH concentrations are obtained. As a result, the proposed LAMWCNT-Au/GCE could be used for the selective and sensitive identification of GSH. Table S2† shows a reference of dynamic range and detection limit using the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE demonstrating the improved dynamic range and LOD for GSH that is similar to previously reported working electrodes. This resemblance demonstrated the LAMWCNT-Au/GCE sensor's capability to detect GSH.

One of the most important factors affecting a sensor's reliability is its anti-interference capability. Selectivity is among the most crucial attributes of an ideal sensor. Numerous interfering species can create an interfering atmosphere, resulting in an incorrect estimation of the analyte. Thus, the selectivity of the LAMWCNT-Au manufactured working electrode for selective and sensitive identification of GSH was analyzed, and a few significant biological interferents and metal ions might disturb the current results. The consequences of such biological interfering species were monitored by studying 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH in the PBS (pH = 7) electrolyte in the presence of interferents (5 mmol per L each) (Fig. S3†). Urea, dopamine, uric acid, ascorbic acid, cysteine, glucose, and inorganic ions such as K+, Fe3+, Ca2+, and Na+ had no impact on the response of its peak current, verifying that there was no influence of such comparable species (signal change <5%). The new prototype LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode does seem to be a possible future for detecting GSH in biological matrices due to its anti-interference properties. As a result, it is believed that the proposed matrix can selectively provide the signal for GSH in the presence of other feasible interfering molecules.
Stability, reproducibility, and repeatability analyses were conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. S4.† The prolonged storage stability of the prepared LAMWCNT-Au/GCE was explored for five weeks while the fabricated composite working electrode was maintained at 4 °C, as shown in Fig. S4(A).† The studies were conducted using a 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH solution in 0.1 M pH 7.0 PBS. The constructed working electrode retained 89 percent of its original GSH current response for five weeks, suggesting that the electrode's stability is sufficient for a set period. These findings could be described by the chemical stability of LAAu and LAMWCNT in the re-designed LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode. It implies that the constructed working electrode is indeed very durable over a long period. In Fig. S4(B),† the reproducibility of the biosensor (LAMWCNT-Au/GCE) is illustrated by sequential identification of 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH in 0.1 M pH 7.0 PBS solution. For GSH, the relative standard deviations (RSD) using five individually constructed working electrodes were estimated to be 1.23 percent (n = 5), affirming that the fabrication technique was highly reproducible. The repeatability study of the assembled composite working electrode (LAMWCNT-Au/GCE) was evaluated by replicating five times with the same working electrode voltammetric responses, as shown in Fig. S4(C),† as well as its impacts on peak currents of 0.5 mmol L−1 GSH. The RSD for GSH was reported to be 1.89 percent after five straight measurements.
Actual glutathione identification in marketing tablets is studied using the recently formulated LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode. Table S3† illustrates the summary of evaluation of spike recovery executed on the analyte at five distinct concentrations. The recovery was confirmed using the standard addition procedure. For all concentrations tested, better recovery results were calculated. The pharmaceutical tablet's values of recovery are in the range of 98.3–103.2 percent, having an RSD below 5% (n = 3). This interesting finding confirmed that in the presence of interfering species, the LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode's capability as an appropriate electrochemical sensor for assessing GSH possesses good efficiency and selectivity in actual-world samples.
4. Conclusions
This article describes a simple laser-ablation method for producing impurity-free LAMWCNT-Au, LAMWCNT, and LAAu nanoparticles. Because of the synergistic surface impact arising from the introduction of AuNPs on MWCNTs, the fabricated LAMWCNT-Au/GCE showcases immensely desirable electrocatalytic activity in the identification of GSH at a negative potential in a neutral medium, leading to the production of a LAMWCNT-Au/GCE with an elevated conductivity and large surface area, boosting electron transfer thereby facilitating redox reactions. In aqueous solution, laser-ablation aids in the release of radicals (H˙) and electrons (e−) due to photoionization or inverse Bremsstrahlung processes, thereby reducing Au precursor to Au nanoparticles. MWCNTs serve as a catalytic surface for the reduction of Au on its surface. By tweaking a few experimental settings, this synthesis method will lead to the development of a large new group of materials with improved characteristics like laser wavelength and energy. AuNPs on MWCNTs have a spheroidal form and a diameter of 5 ± 2 nanometres on average. The LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode has a strong electrocatalytic activity as well as outstanding analytical features such as vast linearity and good selectivity for glutathione sensing, according to the results. In addition, the generated electrochemical sensor demonstrates incredible stability, exceptional reproducibility, and great repeatability when used with major inhibiting biomolecules. The recently constructed LAMWCNT-Au/GC working electrode displays its operating flexibility and high rate of recovery in the identification of GSH in actual sample analysis. In summary, we report a new approach for manufacturing zero-dimensional carbon nanostructures, and a new route for launching innovative types of materials for the selective analysis of thiols.
