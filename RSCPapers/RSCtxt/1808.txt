    , Accepted 30th July 2019First published on 5th August 2019AbstractNiMo based materials have been widely recognized as the most promising alternatives to noble Pt electrocatalysts used in alkaline electrolytes for the hydrogen evolution reaction. However, it is difficult to construct a nanostructure, especially 1D morphology, for NiMo materials via an electrochemical method. Herein, a novel Li electrochemical tuning method, for the first time, is introduced to synthesize 1D NiMo nanowires by insertion of lithium ions into parent NiMoO4 nanorods. The as-prepared NiMo catalyst exhibits high HER activity in 1 M KOH, in terms of low overpotential (73 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope (37.2 mV dec−1) and charge transfer resistance (11.3 Ω). Furthermore, no decay in catalytic performance is observed for this material when it is operated at −0.125 V (vs. RHE) for 1250 min and a high Faraday efficiency (96%) is achieved. The high activity of NiMo is ascribed to the synergistic interplay between Ni and Mo and its unique nanostructure, which can expose more active sites and facilitate the mass transfer and hydrogen bubble release.
Introduction
Escalating concerns about the shortage of energy and the worsening environment have directed the spotlight to an abundant element that produces no carbon emissions when burned and has much higher energy density than fossil fuels: hydrogen.1 Electrochemical water splitting has long been envisioned as an efficient and eco-friendly technology for massive hydrogen production, especially when powered by renewable energy, such as wind, hydro, solar, and tidal energy.2–4 At present, one of the daunting challenges to the widespread adoption of this technology is to boost the slow sluggish kinetics of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).5 Pt-Based materials exhibit a close-to-zero hydrogen adsorption/desorption free energy and thus are universally acknowledged as the benchmark catalysts for the HER.6,7 However, the high cost of Pt presents a virtually insurmountable barrier to their practical application. Therefore, it is urgent to exploit affordable materials with Pt-like activity and robust stability toward the HER.8–14
Among various non-noble candidates, particular attention of the scientific community is paid to NiMo-based alloy materials due to their electronic structures resembling those of Pt and abundant reserves.15–21 Currently, various methods have been developed to fabricate NiMo materials, in which the electrochemical deposition approach is the most facile and fast one.22 Nevertheless, it is hard to control the morphology of the resulting NiMo materials by using this method, and usually densely packed films are formed onto the surface of current collectors.23,36 This kind of morphology is known to be adverse to electrolyte penetration, diffusion of ionic species, H2 bubble release, and active site exposure. As a result, the catalytic performance of NiMo materials has not been fully disclosed, suggesting that constructing a nanostructure is highly desired. The H2 annealing method is also an effective method to prepare NiMo.21 However, such a method is not mild, in consideration of the use of a strong and unsafe reducing agent (H2) and consumption of a large amount of energy (high temperature).
Recently, a new electrochemical method (commonly known as the Li electrochemical tuning method), which makes the target materials into lithium ion batteries and then regulates their chemical and physical properties through charging and discharging these batteries, has gained increasing interest.24 By fine controlling the charge–discharge potential, current density, and cycle number, the target materials can be precisely and continuously tuned so as to obtain optimized structures and compositions and thus enhanced catalytic performance.25,26 Until now, related work has mostly focused on the insertion type materials, such as MoS2,27,28 LiCoO2,29 and LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni),30 and paid less attention to conversion type materials.31,32 Actually, as early as 2000, Tarascon's work on lithium ion batteries has demonstrated that transition metal oxides will experience a conversion process and be reduced to metals during discharging.33 Moreover, numerous experimental results have shown that with limited cycles, transition metal oxides can maintain their original structures or change them slightly.34 Therefore, it is highly possible to apply this electrochemical method for preparing nanostructured metal materials as long as the parent materials are nanostructured. However, this field is seldom touched.
In this context, herein we discovered that 1D NiMo nanowires could be achieved when a lithium ion battery made with NiMoO4 nanorods was discharged to 0.01 V. The as-prepared NiMo nanowires displayed much better HER activity in alkaline media than parent NiMoO4 nanorods and the conventional electrochemical method prepared NiMo, with a mere overpotential of 73 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, no detectable fade in the catalytic performance was observed for this material when the potential was held at −0.125 V (vs. RHE) for 1250 min. This finding highlights the importance of design of electrode architecture for electrocatalysis and may promote widespread application of the Li electrochemical tuning method in more materials.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4·2H2O), sodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7·2H2O), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), ammonia solution (NH3·H2O, 25%), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1, by weight) was purchased from Suzhou Fosai New Material Co., Ltd (Suzhou, China). Nafion solution (5 wt%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Pt/C (20 wt% Pt) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All the chemicals were used as received without purification, unless otherwise specified. Nickel foam was obtained from Shanxi Lizhiyuan Battery Material Co., Ltd (Shanxi, China). Carbon cloth was obtained from Shanghai Hesen Electric Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm) used throughout all experiments was produced with a Millipore system.
Preparation of NiMoO4/Ni foam
First of all, a piece of Ni foam (1 cm × 3 cm) was ultrasonically cleaned with 3 M HCl for 15 min and 95% ethanol for 15 min. Meanwhile, 1 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 1 mmol of Na2MoO4·2H2O were completely dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water under sonication. Subsequently, the as-prepared solution and Ni foam were transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was then tightly sealed and maintained at 160 °C for 5 h in an electric oven. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, the Ni foam coated with light green precursors was taken out and mildly sonicated in deionized water to remove the unstable products on the surface. Finally, the precursors were transformed to light yellow NiMoO4 nanorods after annealing at 350 °C for 1 h under a pure argon atmosphere.
Preparation of NiMo/Ni foam
The NiMoO4/Ni foam was evenly cut into 1 cm × 1 cm in a quadrate shape and then directly used as a working electrode to assemble a lithium-ion half battery in an argon-filled glovebox. A pure Li foil was employed as both the reference and counter electrodes. A solution of 1 M LiPF6 in a mixed solvent of EC, DMC, and EMC (1:1:1, by weight) served as the electrolyte. Subsequently, the abovementioned lithium-ion half battery was discharged to 0.01 V at a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 and then manually dismantled. To obtain the NiMo/Ni foam, the discharge product was carefully washed with 95% ethanol and deionized water to remove lithium oxide. Note that the mass loading of NiMo on Ni foam is calculated to be about 0.88 mg cm−2.
Preparation of C-NiMo/Ni foam
The conventional electrochemical deposition was conducted in a two-electrode system with Ni foam as the working electrode and a carbon rod as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was made of NiCl2·6H2O (47.1 g L−1), Na2MoO4·2H2O (72.9 g L−1), and Na3C6H5O7·2H2O (88.0 g L−1) and its pH was set to be 10.5 by adding NH3·H2O. The C-NiMo was obtained by applying a constant current of 0.1 A cm−2 for 20 s. Note that the mass loading of C-NiMo on Ni foam is calculated to be about 1.08 mg cm−2.
Instruments and measurements
FESEM measurements were performed on a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7100F). TEM images were acquired using a transmission electron microscope (FEI tecnai G2 F3). XRD patterns were obtained using a powder X-ray diffractometer (X'pert PRO, PANalytical B.V.) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) as the X-ray source. XPS measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermal Fisher Scientific) with Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source and the C 1s value was set at 284.60 eV for charge corrections. The amount of H2 produced during electrolysis was measured using a SP7820 gas chromatograph with Ar as the carrier gas.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in 1 M KOH solution using a typical three-electrode system, in which the as-prepared NiMo sample, a carbon rod, and an Hg/HgO electrode were employed as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The electrochemical workstation was a CHI 660E potentiostat (Shanghai Chenhua Co.) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 was chosen to test HER performance. All LSV polarization curves were iR-corrected and the potentials versus Hg/HgO were calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.095 V + 0.059 V × pH. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were executed by applying a 5 mV potential modulation at an overpotential of 146 mV with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The chronoamperometry curve was recorded at a potential of −0.125 V (vs. RHE) for 1250 min.
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of NiMo nanowires anchored on the Ni foam is illustrated in Fig. 1a (see the Experimental section for details). In the first step, NiMoO4 nanorods were grown onto the surface of Ni foam via a typical hydrothermal reaction followed by a heat treatment under a pure argon atmosphere. Subsequently, the as-grown NiMoO4 on Ni foam was directly used as a working electrode to assemble the lithium-ion half battery. The discharge/charge mechanism of NiMoO4 can be revealed by cyclic voltammetry measurement (Fig. S1a†), which shows that NiMoO4 is reduced by lithium ions from the electrolyte to form lithium oxide and metallic Ni and Mo upon discharge. On charge, the discharge products are oxidized to the corresponding metal oxides and lithium ions.35 Therefore, to obtain the NiMo nanowires in the second step, the above battery was discharged to 0.01 V for only one cycle at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. S1b†). The successful synthesis of NiMoO4 and NiMo could be mirrored by the color change of Ni foam, which turned from shiny silver to light yellow and finally deep grey (Fig. S2†). For simplicity in the following discussion, the products prepared in these two steps are denoted as NiMoO4/Ni foam and NiMo/Ni foam, respectively. Moreover, a conventional electrochemical method was also employed to prepare NiMo on Ni foam, which is denoted as C-NiMo/Ni foam. The diffraction peaks of C-NiMo match the Ni4Mo phase (Fig. S3†), consistent with the previous report.36

The as-synthesized products were first scrutinized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Fig. 1b, c, S4a, and S4b† show that densely packed NiMoO4 nanorods with smooth surfaces and flat edges are uniformly grown on the entire Ni foam framework. Their mean diameter is analyzed to be 194.5 nm based on measuring 100 randomly selected nanorods (Fig. S5a†). After the Li electrochemical tuning process, the 1D nanostructure remains intact. However, the surfaces become rough and nearly all the nanorods turn into wire-like morphology, as evidenced by the distinct curved feature (Fig. 1d and S4c†). Furthermore, the mean diameter of NiMo nanowires increases by 17.9% to be 229.4 nm (Fig. S5b†), indicating that the insertion of lithium ions induces volume expansion to some extent. Volume expansion leads to severe mechanical strains, which can be accommodated by bending the nanorods to nanowires in this work. This is quite a common phenomenon in lithium ion batteries, especially for transition metal oxides, such as Co3O4 and MoO3.37,38 For C-NiMo/Ni foam, only densely packed films composed of numerous particles are observed (Fig. S6†), indicating that the newly developed electrochemical method possesses an obvious advantage over the conventional one to construct nanostructured materials without any templates. Like FESEM results, low-magnification TEM images also verify that the surface of NiMo is much rougher than that of NiMoO4 (Fig. 2a and b). Close inspection of Fig. 2b discloses a thin layer (red dotted area) covering on the surface of NiMo, which can be ascribed to the solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) film. The SEI film is widely observed in lithium ion batteries and its formation is mainly ascribed to the irreversible electrolyte decomposition during charging and discharging.39 The STEM-EDX elemental mapping images of NiMo exhibit the uniform presence not only of Ni and Mo signals, but also those of C, F, and O elements (Fig. 2c–h). In addition, an obvious Li 1s peak centered at 54.9 eV is detected in the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrum of NiMo (Fig. S7†). The co-existence of these four elements affirms the formation of a SEI film, which is known to be primarily made of (CH2OCO2Li)2, LiCO3, LiF, polycarbonates, etc.40

After analyzing the morphology, we resorted to other techniques to demonstrate the successful transformation of NiMoO4 to NiMo. The high-magnification TEM image of NiMoO4 reveals clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.202 nm (Fig. 3a and Fig. S8†), in good agreement with one of the d-spacing values presented in the JCPDS no. 13-0128 file. Moreover, the sharp diffraction spots in the SAED pattern indicate the single-crystalline nature of NiMoO4·xH2O (Fig. 3c). In striking contrast, the ordered crystalline lattice of NiMoO4 obviously collapses after intake of lithium ions and a few nanograins (red dotted area) that are embedded in an amorphous structure (blue dotted area) are formed (Fig. 3b). Further careful analysis of the SAED result of NiMo reveals that all the diffraction rings can only be attributed to NiMoO4·xH2O (Fig. 3d). The drastic phase change of NiMoO4 was also captured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. As shown in Fig. 3e, five peaks are observed in the XRD pattern of NiMoO4/Ni foam, in which three strong peaks (marked with clubs) are attributed to Ni foam and the other two weak peaks located at 27.1° and 29.7° well match with the standard pattern of NiMoO4·xH2O (JCPDS no. 13-0128).41 However, only the three peaks from Ni foam are observed in the XRD pattern of NiMo/Ni (Fig. 3e). To exclude the background interference of Ni foam, NiMoO4 was deposited onto the surface of carbon cloth and then experienced the same electrochemical treatment. Similarly, no XRD peaks of any products can be found, except for the two broad graphite carbon peaks (Fig. S9†). Based on the above results, we can infer that these nanograins in Fig. 3d are some unreacted NiMoO4·xH2O and the Ni and Mo products may exist in an amorphous nature. These unreacted NiMoO4·xH2O are so small (less than a few nanometers) that they are invisible in the XRD pattern and their diffraction rings are much diffused.42,43

The NiMo/Ni foam sample was etched with Ar ions before conducting the XPS measurement. 
To prove the existence of Ni0 and Mo0, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) test was also carried out. Some studies have shown that the surface of NiMo is easily oxidized when exposed to air,44 and thus Ni0 and Mo0 may not be detected if this material is directly characterized by XPS without any treatments. Another issue that aroused from directly conducting XPS characterization is likely to obtain a very weak signal of Ni and Mo due to the coverage of the SEI film onto the NiMo surface. Based on the above consideration, the NiMo/Ni foam sample was subjected to an Ar ion etching process to remove the surface oxide and SEI film before conducting XPS measurement. As shown in Fig. 3f, the XPS survey scan of NiMoO4/Ni foam and NiMo/Ni foam validates the existence of Ni, Mo, and O elements. The F element, which is present in the untreated NiMo/Ni foam sample (Fig. S10†), almost totally vanishes after Ar ion etching treatment. Fig. 3g and h show the high resolution of Ni 2p and Mo 3d spectra of NiMoO4 and NiMo, respectively. In the Ni 2p region, the spectrum of NiMoO4 is deconvoluted into four component peaks, in which two peaks at 855.9 eV and 873.7 eV are indexed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, and the other two peaks at 861.5 eV and 879.7 eV are ascribed to shake-up satellite peaks.45 This result proves the +2 state of Ni. However, for the NiMo sample, its Ni 2p spectrum reveals that the dominant peaks belong to Ni0 (852.6 eV and 869.8 eV) and small amounts of Ni2+ (Fig. 3g). In the Mo 3d region, NiMoO4 only exhibits the peaks of Mo6+ (Fig. 3h). For NiMo, other low-valence states of Mo, such as Mo4+ and Mo0, can also be detected.46,47 These XPS results corroborate that NiMoO4 was partly reduced to metallic Ni and Mo, consistent with TEM analysis.
The HER performance of NiMo/Ni foam was investigated in 1 M KOH solution using a conventional three-electrode system. Other samples, such as Ni foam, NiMoO4/Ni foam, C-NiMo/Ni foam, and commercial Pt/C, were also tested for comparison. The discharge current density and cut-off potential are believed to affect the composition and structure of NiMo and thus its catalytic activity. In order to obtain the most active NiMo catalyst, NiMoO4 was electrochemically treated at different discharge current densities and cut-off potentials. As shown in Fig. S11,† when the current density and cut-off potential are set to be 0.1 mA cm−2 and 0.01 V, the as-prepared NiMo sample exhibits the best HER performance. In the following discussion, we will focus on this sample. Fig. 4a presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves with iR compensation. Pure Ni foam displays very low activity for the HER due to its strong water adsorption ability.48 When NiMoO4 nanorods are deposited onto the Ni foam surface, very limited improvement of HER activity is achieved, in line with previous studies.16,19 A similar phenomenon is observed for the C-NiMo sample. Surprisingly, NiMo/Ni foam presents much more enhanced HER performance, with only an overpotential of 73 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This value is much closer to that of the noble Pt/C catalyst (11 mV) and comparable to that of many recently reported NiMo catalysts, like MoNi microspheres (72 mV),49 Mo0.6Ni0.4 (65 mV),50 NiMo-EDA (72 mV),51 NiMo nanoclusters (76 mV),52 NiMo nanopowder (89 mV),21 and NiMo hollow nanorods (92 mV)23 (more comparisons can be seen in Table S1†). In addition, the Tafel slope of NiMo/Ni foam (37.2 mV dec−1) is much smaller than that of Ni foam (93.7 mV dec−1), NiMoO4/Ni foam (95.2 mV dec−1), and C-NiMo/Ni foam (67.5 mV dec−1), and is similar to that of Pt/C (30.7 mV dec−1), indicating that the rate-determining step on NiMo is the Tafel step and the widely recognized sluggish water dissociation kinetics in alkaline solutions is speeded up.53 The high HER activity of NiMo could also be reflected from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra. The charge transfer resistances of Ni foam, NiMoO4/Ni foam, and NiMo/Ni foam are 43.5 Ω, 42.0 Ω, and 11.3 Ω, respectively, suggesting a much faster electron transfer process on the NiMo catalyst (Fig. S12†).

Why does NiMo prepared by the Li electrochemical tuning method exhibit excellent HER activity? Two following reasons should be considered. First, the synergistic interaction between Ni atoms and Mo atoms contributes to high intrinsic activity of NiMo. The intrinsic activity is usually expressed by turnover frequency (TOF), which can be roughly estimated according to a published study.16 As shown in Fig. S13,† a TOF value of 1.01 s−1 is obtained for NiMo at an overpotential of 140 mV, much higher than that of Ni foam (0.49 s−1), indicating that co-presence of Ni and Mo can enhance the per-site activity. Previous studies also suggested that a synergistic interaction existed in NiMo materials, as Ni atoms facilitated the adsorption of water and Mo atoms accepted the bound hydrogen atoms, leading to a faster water dissociation kinetics.21 Second, 1D nanowire morphology of NiMo offers a large electrochemical surface area (ECSA). As shown in Fig. S14,† the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) in a non-faradaic potential window is calculated to be 29.6 mF for NiMo, which is 22.77 times as high as that of C-NiMo (1.3 mF). Since the Cdl value is proportional to the ECSA,54 NiMo thus can expose more active sites than C-NiMo. Furthermore, other merits for constructing a 1D nanowire structure, such as faster mass transfer and hydrogen bubble release, are highly expected.
Except for activity, stability is another important parameter to assess a catalyst. Fig. 4c presents the chronoamperometry curve of NiMo/Ni foam at a fixed potential of −0.125 V (vs. RHE). This curve is rather steady and no significant loss of current density is observed for at least 1250 min. The SEM images of NiMo after a long-term HER test show (Fig. S15†) that its nanowire morphology can be well maintained, further proving its excellent stability. The faradaic efficiency is also extracted by comparing the amount of experimentally measured H2 with theoretically calculated ones and a value of 96% is obtained after 60 min electrolysis (Fig. 4d). The deviation of faradaic efficiency from 100% might be ascribed to the leakage of H2 due to the limits of our electrochemical cell or unknown side reactions that consume some charges. Overall, the NiMo/Ni foam exhibits high activity and excellent stability toward the HER in alkaline solutions, making it a promising alternative to Pt for use in future electrochemical water splitting systems.
Conclusions
In summary, we introduced a new electrochemical method to fabricate NiMo nanowires by inserting lithium ions into the NiMoO4 nanorods. SEM, TEM, XRD, and XPS results showed that the composition, structure, and valence states of NiMoO4 had experienced huge changes after intake of lithium ions, demonstrating its successful conversion. Electrochemical measurements suggested that the as-prepared NiMo exhibited excellent HER performance in alkaline solutions, in terms of high activity and superior stability, rendering it a potential alternative to noble Pt for practical electrolysis water devices. This method holds great promise to prepare other hierarchical electrodes for various electrochemical applications.
