, Accepted 1st August 2016First published on 1st August 2016AbstractSulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) with strong electronegativity and adhesion ability of S/C compounds was prepared by a homogeneous reaction as the binder for the sulfur cathode of Li–S batteries compared to the conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. The binder and its applications to lithium sulfur batteries were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammogram (CV) and charge–discharge tests. The results show that this functional binder exhibits promising characteristics for lithium sulfur batteries with a capacity of 552.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1600 mA g−1 and 268.5 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 300 cycles.
1. Introduction
With the growth of population and economy and the improvement of living standards, the energy demand is increasing rapidly. As the use of energy increases, the environmental problems are becoming increasingly serious. Furthermore, fossil fuel is a non-renewable energy. In order to cope with these issues and reduce our reliance on fossil fuel, available clean renewable energy need to be developed, e.g., water energy, solar energy, wind energy, and lithium ion batteries. Lithium ion batteries are one of the most viable choices for electrical energy storage, portable electronic devices and electrical vehicles. A high energy density is of considerable technological importance due to the increasing power requirements. From this point of view, lithium sulfur batteries have attracted interest because sulfur offers a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mA h g−1 and a high theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg−1. In addition, sulfur also has advantages such as abundant resources, low cost, environmentally friendliness, and favorable safety. Nevertheless, the widespread application of the lithium sulfur battery is impeded by its typically low sulfur utilization, low rate capacity, and poor cycle life, essentially because of the ion and electron insulating nature (5 × 10−30 S cm−1, 25 °C), the large volumetric expansion and the solubility of the reductive polysulfide in organic electrolyte.1–3
Various experimental strategies have been developed to tackle these issues, e.g., by embedding sulfur in porous carbon, which can provide a well conduction framework for sulfur and suppress polysulfide dissolution in the electrolyte.4–6 Another promising method is replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid or gel electrolyte to prevent the dissolution of lithium polysulfides.7–10 As for the anode, an efficient approach is to protect the lithium surface by physical methods plating a layer of thin film or by the application of a LiNO3 electrolyte additive to obtain a SEI layer on the lithium surface.11,12 It is found that the binder also has a great influence on the performance of sulfur electrode.13–17 Above all, the binder acts as a bridge whose adhesion ability will directly affect the electron conduction effect between the electrode material and current collector. In addition, as the active material and the conductive carbon are dispersed evenly in the polymer binder, the binder also has an important influence on the electrochemical activity of the electrode. For example, the use of a binder containing functional groups with strong electronegativity will restrict the polysulfide anions in the cathode area by inhibiting their dissolution in the electrolyte, so that the dissolution loss of the active substances will be reduced. Recently, Nafion with the functional group, –SO3H, has been used to improve the electrochemical performance of the lithium sulfur battery, and it has the advantage of Nafion for suppressing polysulfide diffusion.18,19 For example, Holger Schneider et al.20 investigated three different binders, one of which is Nafion. They found that it is useful to enhance the sulfur retention and suppress the polysufide shuttle for electrodes containing Nafion as the binder material. However, Nafion has some disadvantages such as high price and difficult to synthesize, which limits its large-scale applications.
In a previous study, we found that the traditional PVDF binder used in lithium ion batteries is not very suitable for the sulfur electrode in our study, as the cathode material falls off the current collector after several cycles, which leads to poor electrochemical performance of the sulfur electrode. Therefore, an appropriate binder with strong adhesion ability, easy to synthesize, and can reduce the dissolution of the active material is particularly important for the sulfur electrode.
In this work, we synthesized a novel binder SPEEK and applied it to the sulfur electrode of lithium sulfur batteries. Compared to the traditional PVDF binder, the SPEEK has better adhesion ability and apparently improves the electrochemical performance of the lithium sulfur battery.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
SPEEK was synthesized using a homogeneous reaction. 10 g PEEK powder was dried at 100 °C and then dissolved in 250 ml of concentrated (95–98% H2SO4) sulfuric acid in a three-neck flask at 60 °C with powerful mechanical stirring for 5 h. After the reaction was completed, the solution was poured into excessive ice-water mixture so that SPEEK was precipitated. SPEEK was collected by filtration, washed with deionized water until the filtrate was neutral, dried at room temperature for 2 days and then in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h.21–23
2.2 Preparation of the cathodes
Ketjen black (KB, EC-600JD) and sublimed sulfur with a weight ratio of 1:4 were mixed by ball milling for 30 min. The mixture was then heated at 155 °C for 6 h and then at 300 °C for 2 h in a sealed reactor.10
The obtained S/C composite, acetylene black and the as-prepared binder, SPEEK, (10 wt% SPEEK in N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent) with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 were magnetic stirred for 4 h in N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP) solvent to form a uniform slurry. The slurry was cast onto aluminum foil substrates and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. The composite loading was approximately 2.4 mg cm−2. For comparison, the slurry using PVDF as the binder was prepared by the same method.
2.3 Cell assembly
Coin-type (CR2025) cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, in which the H2O and O2 contents were less than 1 ppm. A sulfur electrode was used as the cathode, a lithium foil as the counter and reference electrode, Celgard 2400 as the separator, and 0.65 mol L−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in a solvent mixture of dimethoxy ethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) (1:1, v/v) as the electrolyte. After being assembled, the cells were stood for 5 h before testing to ensure the immersion of the electrolyte into the electrodes.
2.4 Structural characterization
The crystal structure was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-rB, Rigaku) from 10° to 70° with Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphologies were identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SPA400 Seiko Instruments), the sulfur content of S/C composite was detected by thermogravimetric analysis (TG, TA Instruments, Q600) by heating with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 450 °C under an N2 atmosphere. The FT-IR spectra were obtained on a Nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. 1H NMR spectra were obtained on an Avance III 400 (Bruker), the SPEEK polymer solution was prepared in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). The degree of sulfonation (DS) of the SPEEK used in this work was determined by the 1H NMR measurements.
2.5 Electrochemical characterization
Galvanostatic charging–discharging tests were operated on a LANDCT 2001 (NewareCo. Ltd) battery tester between 1.0 and 2.8 V at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured over the frequency range from 10 mHz to 1 MHz with an amplitude of 5 mV using the Autolab Electrochemical Workstation. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were performed on an Autolab Electrochemical Workstation with a voltage range of 1.0–2.8 V and a scanning rate of 0.1 mV S−1.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 and 2 depict the structure of SPEEK and its 1H NMR spectra, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of each –SO3H group results in a distinct signal for protons at the E position. The intensity of this HE signal yields estimates of the HE content, which is equivalent to the –SO3H group content. The ratio between the peak area of the distinct HE signal (AHE) and the integrated peak area of the signals corresponding to all the other aromatic hydrogens (AHAA*BB*CD), is expressed as  where x is the number of HE per repeat unit. An estimate of the degree of sulfonation y is obtained as y = x × 100%.21

According to this method, it can be calculated that the DS of SPEEK is 0.93. The FT-IR spectra of SPEEK are shown in Fig. 3. For the spectrum of SPEEK, the ether bond and carbonyl group are identified by the peak at 1647 cm−1 and 1190 cm−1. The aromatic ring skeleton stretching vibrations are observed at 1600 cm−1 and 1470 cm−1. In addition, the absorption peaks of sulfonic acid groups are assigned as follows: OSO stretching vibrations of the sulfonic acid group at 1080 cm−1 and 1190 cm−1, S–O stretching vibration at 714 cm−1 and SO stretching absorption peak at 1022 cm−1, indicating the introduction of sulfonic acid groups.24

The electrochemical performance of Li–S cells is shown in Fig. 5. The current density and the capacity are calculated in terms of sulfur. The sulfur content of the S/C composite is 77.32%, which can be noted from the thermo-gravimetric analysis shown in Fig. 4. As seen in Fig. 5a, the initial capacities of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK at different current densities are 784.28 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 714.6 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, 650 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1, 609 mA h g−1 at 800 mA g−1 and 552.6 mA h g−1 at 1600 mA g−1, and it is 737 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 569.8 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, 510.8 mA h g−1 at 400 mA g−1, 468.4 mA h g−1 at 800 mA g−1 and 380.3 mA h g−1 at 1600 mA g−1 for the sulfur cathode with PVDF. The ratio performance of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK is better than that of the sulfur cathode with PVDF. The coulombic efficiencies of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK are higher than that of the sulfur cathode with PVDF from 200 mA g−1 to 1600 mA g−1 in Fig. 5b, which indicates the more severe “shuttle effect” of the polysulfides in the sulfur cathode with PVDF. The 1st, 50th, and 300th charge–discharge process curves at 1000 mA g−1 of the sulfur cathode with different binders are shown in Fig. 5c and d. There are two potential plateaus in the discharge curves of the sulfur cathode in the lithium battery, which can be attributed to the multiple electrochemical reactions in the Li/S battery. The first plateau in the discharge curve at around 2.3 V corresponds to the reduction of elemental S to a high-order Li polysulfide (Li2Sn, n ≥ 4). The second plateau at around 2.0 V reflects the conversion of these polysulfide anions to lithium sulfide Li2S. Notably, the second plateau in the 50th and 300th discharge curves of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK is longer than that of the sulfur cathode with PVDF, respectively. The sulfur cathode with SPEEK also shows better stability after 300 cycles under a current density of 1000 mA g−1 than the sulfur cathode with PVDF, as shown in Fig. 5e.

In order to understand the influence of SPEEK on the electrochemical performance of Li–S batteries, further investigations are carried out. Fig. 6a presents electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK and the sulfur cathode with PVDF after 30 cycles, in which a depressed semicircle at high frequency and an inclined line at low frequency can be seen clearly. The semicircle corresponds to charge transfer resistance in high frequency and the inclined line at low frequency reflects the Li+ diffusion into the active mass. It is obvious that the charge transfer resistance of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK is smaller than that of the sulfur cathode with PVDF. The reason may be that SPEEK contains functional groups with strong electronegativity such as benzene, carbonyl and sulfonic groups, which can increase the electron cloud density of SPEEK and promote Li+ migration, so that the electrochemical reaction activity of the electrode is increased.

Cyclic voltammogram curves of the Li/S cells with the sulfur cathode with SPEEK and the sulfur cathode with PVDF at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6b. Both the curves show two distinct reduction peaks and one oxidation peak. In the anodic scan, only one oxidation peak can be observed at a potential of 2.5 V, which corresponds to the transformation of lithium sulfide into high-order polysulfides.
In addition, the reduction and oxidation peaks of the sulfur cathode with SPEEK appear much sharper than the sulfur cathode with PVDF. For the sulfur cathode with SPEEK, ΔE (voltage difference) between the reduction and reduction peaks is also smaller. This explains that the sulfur cathode with SPEEK has better kinetics characteristics, and the lower ΔE and the sharper peak also shows an improvement of electrochemical reversibility of the cell in the sulfur cathode with SPEEK system.14
The macrocosmic surfaces of different cathodes were investigated after 300 charge–discharge cycles to further explore the effect of SPEEK binder.
As shown in Fig. 7, many active materials fall off from the current collector for the sulfur cathode with PVDF (Fig. 7a). However, the sulfur cathode with SPEEK is much better (Fig. 7b). This suggests that the adhesion ability of PVDF decreases and then causes the loss of active materials during cycling. In contrast, the strong adhesion property of SPEEK contributes to the integrated surface of sulfur cathode.

The microcosmic surfaces and morphology of the sulfur cathodes with different binders before and after cycling were examined by SEM and XRD, as shown in Fig. 8 and 9. An irregular surface with abundant pores of the sulfur cathodes before cycling can be observed in Fig. 8a1 and b1. The surfaces of the sulfur cathodes with different binders after 300 cycling are shown in Fig. 8a2 and b2. As a type of long chain polymer material, the binder can form a network structure so that active material and conductive carbon will be evenly dispersed therein. As mentioned before, the functional groups, such as carbonyl group, benzene ring and sulfonyl, make SPEEK has the strong electronegativity. As a result, the dissolution of polysulfides into electrolyte will be suppressed during the charging–discharging process. The sulfur electrode using PVDF as the binder presents a sparse granular morphology after 300 cycles, due to dissolution loss of the active material polysulfide ions from the cathode zone into the electrolyte. In contrast, the electrode with SPEEK as a binder shows a dense surface morphology. On account of the strong electronegativity of SPEEK, the active material polysulfide ions will be limited in the cathode area and be fully oxidized to the final product Li2S2/Li2S, which is deposited on the electrode surface, making it dense. SEM also explained why the cycle performance of the SPEEK electrode is better than that of the PVDF electrode.

The XRD patterns of the sulfur cathodes with different binders before and after cycling are shown in Fig. 9. The two XRD patterns were similar to each other before cycling, whereas the sulfur/SPEEK cathode presents two distinct characteristic peaks at 23.4° and 26.9°, which corresponds to elemental sulfur and Li2S, respectively.13 The XRD results demonstrate the existence of Li2S in the dense surface of sulfur/SPEEK cathode shown in Fig. 8b2, indicating the restriction effect of SPEEK for polysulfides from dissolving into the electrolyte during cycling.
4. Conclusions
A functional binder, SPEEK, for the lithium sulfur battery was prepared using a homogeneous reaction to improve the cycle performance with a high sulfur content. It shows better electrochemical performance for the sulfur cathode with the functional binder SPEEK. The electrochemical tests suggest that the sulfur cathode with SPEEK has a smaller charge transfer resistance and better kinetic characteristics than the sulfur cathode with PVDF. The visual image, SEM images and XRD indicate that the sulfur cathode with SPEEK has high adhesion ability and can suppress the dissolution of the reductive polysulfide in the organic electrolyte, which is the main challenge in the application of Li–S batteries. We can conclude that the functional binder SPEEK is not only a strong adhesion additive for the sulfur cathode, but also plays an important role in restraining the loss of polysufide lithium. Based on this study, SPEEK is a promising type of binder in lithium sulfur battery applications.
