    , Accepted 11th January 2021First published on 11th January 2021AbstractCesium lead halide perovskites as ideal photovoltaic and optoelectronics materials have attracted more and more attention. Here, we investigated the structure and electronic properties of halide perovskite CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) by particle swarm optimization and first principles methods at hydrostatic pressure. For CsPbI3, the structure phases and corresponding phase transitions of non-perovskite orthorhombic Pnma (non-Pv-Pnma), monoclinic C2/m (C2/m-I), and another different monoclinic phase C2/m (C2/m-II) are found in the pressure range 0–120 GPa. The largest piezochromic effect in the perovskites can be predicted in CsPbI3 under a pressure below 10 GPa. The band gap is reduced under pressure and the C2/m-II phase becomes a metal under pressures larger than 65 GPa. For CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3, the same phase sequence under pressure, i.e. from perovskite Pnma (Pv-Pnma), to non-Pv-Pnma, C2/m-I, and then to another orthorhombic Cmcm phase, is found. The newly discovered non-Pv-Pnma phase gives an excellent explanation of previous measurements at low pressure for CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3. Furthermore, the calculations of electronic properties show that pressure is an effective means to tune the band gap. Our calculations and results extend the applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics of halide perovskites.
I. Introduction
Halide perovskites are intensively studied because of their potential applications in photovoltaics and optoelectronics.1–5 Most of all, inorganic halide perovskites with cation Cs+ exhibit excellent thermal stability compared with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.6,7 Experimentally and theoretically, CsPbI3 adopts a cubic perovskite structure at high temperature (>310 °C), and has an ideal value of the band gap (Eg = 1.73 eV) for photovoltaic applications. However, at room temperature, the orthorhombic non-perovskite phase with a wide band-gap of 2.82 eV is undesirable for photovoltaics and optoelectronics.8–10 In addition, cesium lead halides CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 adopt an orthorhombic phase at room temperature with a large band-gap, lacking effective absorption in the visible light region.11,12 It is known that the power conversion efficiency of solar cells is highly dependent on the band gap of photovoltaic materials; tuning the band gap to the appropriate band gap range for solar cells is one fundamental method to improve the power conversion efficiency of solar cells.
The pressure effect, as an effective approach of modifying crystal structures, thus enhancing the photoelectric properties, has been widely studied for halide perovskites.13–21 For example, the emission and phase transition of Cs2AgBiCl6 and (BA)4AgBiBr8 (BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3+) under pressure were investigated, and a reduced band gap and enhanced electron–phonon coupling were discovered in these materials.19,20 For CsPbI3, a pressure-induced structure transition from the orthorhombic Pnma to the monoclinic P21/m phase has been observed at 3.9 GPa, and the residual crystalline state disappeared at a pressure up to 15 GPa.13 However, Liang et al. discovered another phase transition at 6.9 GPa from the orthorhombic Pnma phase to the monoclinic C2/m structure. Meanwhile, they observed that the band gap of CsPbI3 experienced a large red-shift from 2.5 to 1.2 eV as the pressure increased from 0 to 15 GPa, and an insulator–metal transition at 39.3 GPa.14 In research on pressure effects for CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3, the band gaps of CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 were found to be initially red shifted at low pressure and then blue shifted under larger pressure, and there is a sharp increase in the pressure range of 0–5 GPa. An explanation of the change of the band gap was given.15–17 However, the origin of the change of the band gap and the structure phases are still unclear under pressure. Furthermore, the structure phase and properties at high pressure are still unknown.
The goal of this article is to positively answer all these open questions by performing and analyzing particle swarm optimization (CALYPSO)22–24 and by first principles methods. The structure and electronic properties of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) under pressures of 0–120 GPa are investigated.
This article is organized as follows. Section II provides computational details. Section III reports our results for CsPbI3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbCl3, respectively, and a summary is given in Section IV.
II. Computational methods
In our work, structure searching simulations under hydrostatic pressures were performed by the Crystal structure Analysis using Particle Swarm Optimization (CALYPSO) method.22–24 The CALYPSO code is a very powerful code for predicting structures which has been highly used in the structure prediction community and many predictions by CALYPSO were consistent with earlier experiments.25–27,33 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method, implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP),28,29 was adopted for computing the lowest-energy structure and corresponding electronic properties in a pressure range of 0–120 GPa. Cs 5s25p66s1, Pb 6s26p2, I 5s25p5, Br 4s24p5, and Cl 3s23p5 have been treated as valence electrons. We used the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof-type (PBE) exchange correlation potential.30 Brillouin zone integrations were sampled with Monkhorst–Pack k meshes of 0.1 Å−1 for the electronic structure calculations. An energy cutoff of 300 eV was used for CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3, while 350 eV was used for CsPbCl3 (note that these energy cutoffs are 1.3 times larger than the default values). The structural optimizations were stopped when the forces were less than 0.001 eV Å−1.
III. Results and discussion
Structure prediction and analysis of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) using CALYPSO and first principles methods have been performed with 1–4 formula units (f.u.) per supercell (they are 5, 10, 15, and 20 atoms, respectively) at 0, 20, 50, 70, and 100 GPa. Five low energy states are found (Fig. 1), and their structural stabilities under other different pressures are investigated by first principles. Note that the phonon dispersions of all the ground states under pressure are calculated and no negative phonon frequency is found as detailed in Fig. S1–S3 of the ESI,† indicating that our predicted phases under pressure are indeed stable.

A. Structure and electronic properties of CsPbI3 under pressure

Fig. 2 presents the enthalpy ΔH = E + PV as a function of pressure for different phases. For CsPbI3, at 0 GPa, the ground state is a non-Pv-Pnma structure with lattice constants of a = 10.85 Å, b = 4.88 Å, and c = 18.23 Å, which is consistent with the experimental results.8 The energy of Pv-Pnma is larger than the ground state by 0.19 eV f.u.−1. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the atomic structures. Fig. 1(b) clearly shows the edge-sharing octahedra in the non-Pv-Pnma structure. This non-Pv-Pnma structure with edge sharing octadedra is the so-called post-post-perovskite31–33 and it is the ground state until 11 GPa. At 11 GPa, CsPbI3 experiences a first-order phase transition from orthorhombic non-Pv-Pnma to monoclinic C2/m-I (Fig. 2(a)) with lattice parameters of a = 8.15 Å, b = 3.83 Å, c = 18.18 Å, and β = 102.698°. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the bonding between atoms and the connection between polyhedra in the structure of C2/m-I have a striking variation compared with the non-Pv-Pnma structure. There are 10 atoms in one unit cell of C2/m-I and nine Pb–I bonds in one polyhedron, which connects with other polyhedra via edge sharing, while the polyhedra are connected via sharing the surface between the adjacent cells in the ab plane and reveal sandwich stacking order along the c axis, similar to experimental investigations.14 At 52 GPa, a second-order phase transition from C2/m-I to C2/m-II in CsPbI3 is discovered in our calculations (Fig. 2(a)), while it was not observed at high pressures of up to 64 GPa in the experimental results of X-ray diffraction.14 This inconsistency between calculation and experiment may result from the influence of temperature (first principles can only be performed at zero temperature). Thus, our results provide a prediction for research on low-temperature structures in CsPbI3. As shown in Fig. 1(d), there are 10 atoms in one-unit cell of C2/m-II, and the polyhedra between neighboring cells along the c axis display a staggered distribution different from the layered monoclinic C2/m-I. From a low pressure of zero GPa to a high pressure of 120 GPa, CsPbI3 undergoes phase transitions from Pv-Pnma → C2/m-I → C2/m-II, with reducing cell volume and shortening bonds of polyhedra, implying that the crystal structure can be densified under high pressure with a structural reconstruction.

The evolution of the band gap of CsPbI3 under pressure is shown in Fig. 3(a). It can be found that the band gap (Eg) decreases with an increase in pressure and finally decreases to zero at high pressure. For the structure phase of non-Pv-Pnma, the indirect band gap is 2.5 eV at 0 GPa, in good agreement with the experimental value, and decreases to 1.75 eV, which is perfect for photovoltaic applications in tandem solar cells, at 9 GPa.1,2 At a pressure of 20 GPa, the monoclinic C2/m-I phase with an indirect band gap of 1.4 eV appears, which is really ideal for high power conversion efficiency single solar cells.34,35 The band gap can be reduced to zero at pressures larger than 65 GPa where the C2/m-II phase undergoes an insulator to metal transition. Furthermore, with the large variation of the band gap under pressure, the piezochromic effect in CsPbI3 is remarkable. It is calculated that the piezochromic parameter is as large as 0.083 eV GPa−1 for CsPbI3 below 10 GPa, which is much larger than 0.058 eV GPa−1 of perovskite BiFeO3,36,37 which suggests an advantage for application in optical response devices.

To further understand the electronic properties of CsPbI3 under pressure, the partial density of states (PDOS) of CsPbI3 at a certain pressure is shown in Fig. 4. The states at the valence band and conduction band near the Fermi level are mainly contributed by I(5p) and Pb(6p), respectively, in good agreement with the reported results of ref. 38. Fig. 4(a)–(c) show the PDOS of CsPbI3 at 0 GPa, 20 GPa, and 70 GPa, respectively. One can see that the band gaps are 2.52 eV at 0 GPa, 1.43 at 20 GPa, and 0 eV at 70 GPa, clearly indicating that the band gap decreases with an increase in pressure. This is because the bands delocalize and broaden the energy range as the pressure increases. As shown in Fig. 4, I(5p) and Pb(6p) near the Fermi level are localized in the energy range from −2.5 eV to 0 eV at zero pressure, while they are delocalized at energy from −5.5 eV to 0 eV at 20 GPa, and further delocalized from −8.2 eV to 0 eV at 70 GPa. For the conduction states of Pb(6p), they are localized at 2.5–4 eV at 0 GPa, while they broaden to the energy range of 1.5–4.5 eV at 20 GPa and further broaden to the energy range of 0–6 eV at 70 GPa, inducing the closing of the band gap and metallic states at high pressure.

B. Structure and electronic properties of CsPbBr3 under pressure

Fig. 2(b) shows the enthalpy of CsPbBr3 as a function of pressure. The ground state at 0 GPa is the Pv-Pnma state (Fig. 1(a)), which is consistent with the measurements.15,17 However, the non-Pv-Pnma (Fig. 1(b)) state has very close enthalpy with the ground state of Pv-Pnma. Non-Pv-Pnma becomes the ground state at 0.35 GPa until about 9 GPa. At 9 GPa, one can see that a phase transition from non-Pv-Pnma to monoclinic C2/m-I occurs in CsPbBr3, similar to CsPbI3 where this phase transition occurs at 11 GPa. However, CsPbBr3 has a phase transition from monoclinic phase C2/m-I to the orthorhomobic Cmcm phase (Fig. 1(e)) at a high pressure (which is 85 GPa), rather than the phase transition from C2/m-I to C2/m-II which occurs in CsPbI3. This may be because of the greater number of Pb–X bonds in the Cmcm phase than that in the C2/m-II phase, which makes it easier for phase Cmcm to endure high pressure for CsPbBr3. As shown in Fig. 1, the polyhedron in the Cmcm phase indeed has more Pb–X bonds than that in the C2/m-II phase. Thus, the pressure induced phase transitions in CsPbBr3 are Pv-Pnma → non-Pv-Pnma → C2/m-I → Cmcm subsequently.
We investigate the electronic structures of different phases of CsPbBr3 under pressure. Fig. 3(b) displays the band gaps of CsPbBr3 as a function of pressure. The ground state of Pv-Pnma at 0 GPa possesses a direct band gap of 2.09 eV and the band gap decreases with an increase in pressure, which is similar to the experimental results.15,17 However, the isostructural phase transition from Pv-Pnma to non-Pv-Pnma at 0.3 GPa leads to a sharp increase from 2.07 to 2.87 eV. The discovered new phase of non-Pv-Pnma here explains very well the measurement of a phase transition at 2.5 GPa.15,17 Given the close enthalpy between the Pv-Pnma and non-Pnma states at low pressure, we calculate the variation of the band gap of Pv-Pnma at low pressure from 0–5 GPa. One can see from Fig. 5(a) that the band gap of the Pv-Pnma phase first decreases and reaches a minimum at 2 GPa, and then increases with increasing pressure until 5 GPa, which is consistent with the results of experiments. It is known that the band gap generally decreases with an increase in pressure. To further understand this abnormal phenomenon, we calculate the lattice parameter at different pressures and the partial density of states (PDOS), as shown in Fig. 5(b)–(d). The lattice parameter of a reaches a minimum at about 1.5 GPa in the pressure range of 0–5 GPa, showing a similar variation to the band gap when the pressure increases (Fig. 5(b)). The shrinkage and expansion of lattice parameter a may shift the bands and change the band gaps. The minimum of lattice parameter a is at about 1.5 GPa, rather than 2 GPa where the band gap reaches the minimum. The small inconsistency in the pressure of the minima of the band gap and lattice parameter is related to the detailed change of the structure under pressure, such as the bond lengths. As shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI,† we found that the average in-plane Br–Pb bond length reaches its minimum at about 3.5 GPa, leading the pressure at which the band gap reaches a minimum to be close to the average of the pressures at which the lattice parameter and average in-plane Br–Pb bond length reach their minimum.

(c) The px, py, and pz states of Br 4p of the valence states and (d) px, py, and pz of Pb 6p of the conduction states in the Pv-Pnma phase at pressure 0 GPa, 1 GPa, 2 GPa, and 3 GPa. 

Fig. 5(c) and (d) display the valence states and conduction states, respectively (where the Fermi levels are set to zero). One can see that the valence states are indeed red/blue shifted at different pressure (see the peaks at different pressure), similar to the conduction states. Under pressure 0–2 GPa the valence state peaks at about −1.2 eV shift to lower energy, while they shift to higher energy at 3 GPa (Fig. 5(c)). The conduction states near the Fermi level shift to lower energy under pressures from 0 to 2 GPa with similar contributions of px and pz orbitals. At 3 GPa, the conduction states near the Fermi level shift to higher energy. Furthermore, the main px states (at about 2.7 eV) are blue shifted compared with the main pz states (at about 2.5 eV). The blue shift of px and the increase of the band gap result from the increased lattice parameter along the x direction compared with that at lower pressure. Thus, the change of the lattice parameter a leads to the shift of the electronic states and change of the band gap.
Under pressures larger than 9 GPa, the band gap of C2/m-I decreases with increasing pressure, apart from the pressure of 80 GPa where the band gap is higher than that at 70 GPa. Our calculations show that the increase of the band gap also comes from the increase of lattice parameter a, similar to the increase of the band gap of the Pv-Pnma phase at 3 GPa (Fig. 5(a)). There is a sharp decrease at 90 GPa at the phase transition from C2/m-I to Cmcm, and the band gap further decreases when the pressure increases from 90 to 120 GPa. Then the band gap may change to zero and CsPbBr3 becomes metallic when the pressure further increases.
C. Structure and electronic properties of CsPbCl3 under pressure
For CsPbCl3, the structural phase transitions under pressure are shown in Fig. 2(c). It can be found that CsPbCl3 with a Pv-Pnma structure is the ground state at 0–1.5 GPa (see the inset of Fig. 2(c)), with its band gap decreasing from 2.5 to about 2.4 eV (Fig. 6(a)) when the pressure increases. At about 1.5 GPa, the Pv-Pnma phase transforms into non-Pv-Pnma, with the band gap sharply jumping from about 2.4 to 3.3 eV. Then the band gap for non-Pv-Pnma slowly decreases as the pressure increases in the range 1.5–12 GPa (Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 3(c)). Note that the jumping of the band gap at pressure 1.5 GPa is highly consistent with the measurement.16 Here, we give an explanation of the sharp change of the band gap, which is induced by the phase transition from Pv-Pnma to non-Pv-Pnma with the change of octahedra or polyhedra. Under a pressure of 12 GPa, the orthorhombic non-Pv-Pnma transforms into monoclinic phase C2/m-I (Fig. 2(c)). C2/m-I has the lowest enthalpy and is the ground state until the pressure increases to 80 GPa, with the band gap decreasing from about 3.3 to 2 eV (Fig. 3(c)). The phase C2/m-I transforms into Cmcm at 80 GPa, and Cmcm is the ground state until 120 GPa, with the band gap decreasing from 2.0 to 1.2 eV (Fig. 3(c)).
 Fig. 6  (a) The band gaps of the non-Pv-Pnma and Pv-Pnma phases and (b) the lattice parameters of the Pv-Pnma phase for CsPbCl3 as a function of pressure 0–5 GPa. (c) The px, py, and pz states of Cl 3p of the valence states and (d) px, py, and pz of Pb 6p of the conduction states in the Pv-Pnma phase at pressure 0 GPa, 2 GPa, 3 GPa, and 4 GPa. 
In order to study the metastable phase of Pv-Pnma which may be synthesized at low pressure, we calculated the structure and electronic structure of Pv-Pnma at pressures of 0–5 GPa. Fig. 6 shows the band gap, lattice parameters, and the PDOS of Pv-Pnma. The band gap first decreases from 0 GPa and reaches a minimum at 3 GPa, and then increases in the pressure range of 3–5 GPa. The variation of the band gap is related to the lattice parameter a, which slightly decreases from 0 to 2.5 GPa, and then increases with increasing pressure in the pressure range of 2.5–5 GPa. Fig. 6(c) and (d) further show the PDOS under pressure. From Fig. 6(d), px orbitals show a blue-shift compared to pz orbitals. Furthermore, px orbitals give lower contributions to the CBM than pz orbitals at 3 GPa and 4 GPa, leading to the blue-shift of the band gap at high pressure from 3 to 5 GPa.
IV. Conclusions
The crystal structures and electronic properties of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) under pressure have been investigated in our work by using the particle swarm optimization method and first-principles calculations. A sequence of structure phases of non-Pv-Pnma, C2/m-I, and C2/m-II is found for CsPbI3 under pressures of 0–120 GPa. Meanwhile, Pv-Pnma, non-Pv-Pnma, C2/m-I, and Cmcm are found for CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 in the same pressure range. Generally, the band gap is reduced gradually under pressure for different phases except Pv-Pnma. Furthermore, the largest piezochromic effect in the perovskites is found in CsPbI3 under pressure 0–10 GPa. Our results give an ideal explanation of previous measurements and provide a valid way to tune the band gap, which can extend the practical application of metal halide perovskites in photovoltaics and optoelectronics.
