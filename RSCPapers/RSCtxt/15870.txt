    , Accepted 21st September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractNowadays, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation is evaluated as an encouraging technology for the production of renewable H2 fuels. The design or foundation of efficient photoelectrodes is regarded as one of critical keys to realize highly efficient devices for H2 production. Due to their high light absorption, visible absorbing materials have been widely investigated to achieve high PEC performance. Recently, tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) with a band gap of ∼2.1 eV has been actively investigated because it can capture the entire visible light. In the present study, an n-type Ta3N5 nanotube (NT) film in a fluorinated-based electrolyte was developed by a two-time electrochemical anodization technique using a Ta foil. To improve the electronic conductivity and retard chemical dissolution, tin cations (Sn4+) were incorporated into the amorphous TaOx NT, followed by a high-temperature treatment in a N2/NH3 gas mixture environment to obtain enhanced crystallinity and quality of films. Inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) was performed to remove the blocking layer made on the top surface region after the electrochemical anodization reaction probably resulting from reaction remains and some oxide contaminants. The Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrodes showed an improved photocurrent density (JSC) of ∼1.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode, briefly VRHE), which was comparatively higher (∼0.84 mA cm−2) than that of a bare Ta3N5 NT film, which could be ascribed to the enhanced charge transfer/separation yield as well as the suppressed defect state. When transition metal sites were substituted by Sn doping, the electrical conductivity improved, promoting bulk charge separation and transfer with enhanced water reduction ability and a lower onset potential of Ta3N5 NTs. Moreover, to obtain a stable Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrode, thin gallium nitride (GaN) was passivated onto a Ta3N5 NT film as a hole storage layer to prevent a quick electron–hole recombination process. As an alternative, anchoring a layer of Co(OH)x co-catalyst on Ta3N5 NT substantially enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, showing a Jsc value of ∼4.58 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under solar light irradiation with more sustainable stability.
Introduction
Due to rapid exhaustion of fossil fuels and increasing global demands for future energy, supplying optimal energy is one of the most important issues nowadays. Furthermore, the consumption of fossil fuels is associated with air pollution and inflation of greenhouse effects responsible for climate change.1,2 Therefore, it is necessary to find clean, renewable, and eco-friendly energy sources to survive on Earth.3–6 Solar energy is one of the most substantial alternatives to fossil fuels. It satisfies the global energy challenge due to its abundance and renewable characteristics. It is also carbon-free, storable and environmentally friendly, thus minimizing the environmental crisis of energy. The conversion of solar energy into chemical energy is an encouraging way for renewable energy production and storage.7–12 There are various methods, such as photovoltaic power generation, electrolysis, photothermal energy conversion, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, available to produce renewable energy from solar energy.13–16 Among these energy techniques, PEC water splitting is environmentally friendly. It is a promising artificial photosynthetic sustainable energy conversion technique that can convert solar energy into storable hydrogen energy fuels and oxygen without CO2 emission. In a PEC water splitting system, water is split photoelectrochemically into hydrogen and oxygen gases in a PEC cell composed of a photosensitive semiconducting photoelectrode, a counter electrode, and a reference electrode. The PEC cell is the essential part of the photosensitive semiconducting photoelectrode that can generate photogenerated charge carriers (electrons–holes) by absorbing incident sunlight, separating charges, and inducing water reduction–oxidation reactions on its surface with an aqueous electrolyte contact.17–22 The solar water splitting concept was reported for the first time by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 using a TiO2 photoelectrode to split water under ultraviolet (UV) illumination.23 As a semiconducting material, TiO2 is still the most studied photoelectrode due to its durability in an aqueous electrolyte medium. However, TiO2 has a low PEC water splitting performance because it can only utilize 5% of the solar spectrum wavelength due to its large band gap. From the first observation of PEC water splitting, it is important to develop efficient semiconducting photoelectrode materials to attain the utilization of effective solar power. Although many materials have been surveyed for PEC water oxidation, all of them have poor sunlight absorption due to a large band gap or poor photocorrosion resistance, leading to a short lifetime of electrode.24–31 Owing to its suitable bandgap (2.1 eV) and proper band edge positions, Ta3N5 has recently drawn extensive attention as a promising semiconductor photoelectrode material for visible-light-driven PEC H2O water oxidation with a theoretical maximum solar to hydrogen (STH) separation efficiency of 15.9%. Without any external bias, Ta3N5 can utilize the maximum wavelength of visible light more than (≤600 nm) because of its narrow band gap.32–35 Besides, it has proper valence and conduction band edge orientation for PEC water reduction and oxidation to produce both oxygen and hydrogen gases. To improve the PEC performance of the Ta3N5-based photoelectrode, various approaches have been initiated and a photon-to-current efficiency of 3.46% has been still recorded, which is so far to reach the expected maximum STH conversion efficiency value of 15.9% because of its unfavorable crystal defects persuaded by high-rise-temperature nitridition process and insufficient charge separation and low carrier transportation.36,37 Accordingly, a well-aligned Ta3N5 nanotube (NT) structure can yield high concentrations of reaction sites and increase the surface area with a reduced radial size. A well-aligned Ta3N5 nanotube (NT) structure can also improve the photon absorption efficiency with the decrease in carrier diffusion distance, which can also increase charge carrier separation and transportation between electrode–electrolyte interfaces.38,39 Additionally, doping of metal ions onto a target element lattice site is an effective way to significantly improve the properties of Ta3N5 photoanodes. Previously, various metal cations such as Na+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Sc3+, Ge4+ and Zr4+ were effectively doped into the Ta3N5 lattice site.40–45 The introduction of metal cation dopants into Ta3N5 NTs can suppress the charge recombination rate by lowering the onset potential due to the formation of an internal electric field. Although metal ion dopants can enhance the PEC activity of the Ta3N5 photoanode, the PEC activity is still far below its theoretical value because of its poor carrier transport rate.46 Besides, in Ta3N5 photoanodes, most nitrogen anions undergo self-oxidative decomposition to produce N2 by photogenerated holes and exhibit poor PEC activity and stability, thus suppressing its theoretical value. To improve the PEC performance and photostability of Ta3N5, an approach that can promote effective transport of photogenerated charge carriers in the Ta3N5 film is needed for PEC water oxidation reactions.47,48 Coupling the Ta3N5 photoanode with another nitride base semiconductor is an effective method to improve the electron–hole pair lifetime and block photodegradation to obtain sustainable PEC performance.49–54 Recently, GaN has attracted attention as a surface passivation layer to improve the PEC water oxidation performance due to its more negative conduction band than Ta3N5 and stability against photocorrosion in alkaline media than other nitride materials. Moreover, it has a long hole lifetime that is better than that of the other nitride materials.55–58 To develop efficient nitride photoanodes, GaN has critical semiconducting properties such as reduced charge recombination and improved hole mobility.59–64
In this work, an n-type Ta3N5 NT thin film was developed in a fluorinated-based sulfuric acid electrolyte using a two-time electrochemical anodization technique of the Ta foil. Sn4+ doping was processed into amorphous TaOx NTs, followed by high-temperature nitridation in a N2:NH3 mix gas environment to enhance the crystallinity and quality of films. ICP-RIE (inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching) was additionally carried out to clean up the surface blocking oxide layer and to obtain well-adherent and open Ta3N5 NT arrays with large surface areas. This type of NTs provided a remarkably higher PEC water oxidation efficiency due to their open nature than a blocked nanotube morphology. To obtain a stable Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrode, GaN passivation layer and Co(OH)x co-catalysts were adapted in this system to suppress photocorrosion, increase active sites, improve charge separation and surface reaction dynamics, and enhance oxygen evolution reactions, thus improving the overall PEC water splitting performance.
Experimental section
Cleaning of tantalum (Ta) foil substrates
First, a tantalum foil (0.127 mm thick, 99.95% metal basis, Alfa Aesar, United States) was cut into a rectangular shape of dimension 1.5 cm × 2 cm and cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized (DI) H2O for 15 min each by sequential ultrasonication processes to remove surface impurities. It was then dried under a N2 gas flow and kept in a seal vacuum packet to prevent further contamination before use.
Preparation of Ta3N5 NT films by a two-time electrochemical anodization technique
The method of preparing Ta3N5 NTs is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, after cleaning Ta foil substrates, tantalum oxide NTs were grown by an electrochemical anodization technique in a dilute H2SO4 electrolyte containing 14 wt% of DI water and 1 wt% of NH4F (SIGMA-ALDRICH, 98%) at a constant voltage of 30 V for 20 min at room temperature of 25 °C. For electrochemical anodization, a two-electrode system with a Ta substrate foil and a Pt foil as the anode and cathode respectively was used. A 2 cm of constant gap was maintained and a constant volume (50 mL) of electrolyte was used for each reaction. After the reaction, the as-anodized Ta foil was subjected to water sonication to completely remove TaOx NTs. Finally, TaOx NTs were grown applying the same anodization technique, immersed in absolute ethyl alcohol for 2 min to stabilize them, and then dried under a nitrogen gas flow. To obtain high crystalline Ta3N5 NT films, as-anodized TaOx NTs were annealed in a tubular furnace at 950 °C with a mix flow gas of N2 and NH3 (90:10, v/v) at a constant rate of flow (50 mL min−1) for 2 h.

Preparation of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films
Sn4+ dopants were successfully doped into Ta3N5 NT films by a dipping method. Briefly, the as-anodized amorphous TaOx NT sample was dipped in a 25 mM optimized tin(IV) chloride solution for 16 h. After that, the Sn-doped amorphous TaOx NT sample was dried under a N2 gas flow and annealed at 950 °C with a mix flow gas of N2 and NH3 (90:10, v/v) at a constant rate of flow (50 mL min−1) for 2 h.
ICP-RIE etching of Ta3N5 NT films
The annealed Ta3N5 NT film contained a thin surface blocking oxide layer on the top surface area, which could block nanotube pores and suppress PEC performance. To obtain an open and oxide-free fine Ta3N5 NT surface, ICP-RIE (Sentech SI-500) was performed to remove the surface blocking layer. ICP and RF plasma were produced from two sources with an ICP power of 400 W and an RF power of 200 W. The base pressure during the etching time was kept lower than 2 × 10−5 Pa. BCl3 and Cl2 were used as the main etchant for the ICP-RIE plasma. Etchant BCl3 and Cl2 gas flow rates were maintained constant at 30 sccm and 10 sccm, respectively, using mass flow controllers. Each etching time was kept fixed at 20 s and etched approximately 50 nm.
Deposition of GaN by an electrodeposition technique
To obtain a thin GaN passivated film, the Ga(OH)x thin film was first electrodeposited on a Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film. First, a 25 mM precursor solution of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O material (Aldrich, 99.9%) containing a KNO3 sacrificial agent was used without further purification. A 3-electrode electrochemical cell was used, with a Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film as the working electrode, an SCE (saturated calomel electrode) as the reference electrode, and a Pt foil as the counter electrode. A constant potential (−1.2 V vs. SCE) was applied on the photoelectrode for 180 s in a stirred electrolyte solution. Afterwards, it was rinsed in water and dried under a N2 gas flow. The Ga(OH)x-deposited Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film was then annealed at 950 °C with a mix flow gas of N2 and NH3 (90:10, v/v) at a constant rate of flow (50 mL min−1) for 2.5 h to obtain a GaN-deposited Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film (briefly marked as GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5).
Deposition of Co(OH)X co-catalysts
The Co(OH)X co-catalyst was deposited by an impregnation method. For the deposition of the Co(OH)X co-catalyst on the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, the Co(OH)X precursor was prepared by mixing 0.1 M CoSO4 and 0.1 M NaOH in a volume ratio of 1:1 and stirred for 2 h. The GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film was then immersed in the Co(OH)X precursor solution for an hour. After that, DI water was used to rinse it, which was then dried under the flow of N2.
Characterization
An FE-SEM (field emission scanning electron microscope, HITACHI Inc., S4800) was used to determine the surface morphology and cross-section of bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x co-catalyst-deposited GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 (briefly marked as Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs) NT films operating at 10 kV and 20 mA. To investigate the crystalline characteristics of films, HR-XRD (high-resolution X-ray diffraction) was carried out using a PANalytical X' Pert PRO MRD instrument operating at 30 mA and 40 kV. HR-TEM was carried out to affirm the crystalline features of bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films using a JEOL-3010 instrument operating at 300 kV. The optical characteristics of bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films were studied using a spectrophotometer (LAMBDA-900 UV/vis/IR Spectrometer, PerkinElmer) at a wavelength of 350–750 nm. Moreover, to analyze the chemical states of elements in bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a NEXSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with mono-chromatic radiation ultrahigh vacuum (<10−7 Torr).
Photoelectrochemical characterization
PEC assessments were conducted in a 3-electrode system, operating a potentiostat with illumination of light (CHI Instruments, USA). Bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 N GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrodes were applied as working electrodes (area 0.2 cm2) and KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl and Pt (area: 10 cm2) as reference and counter electrodes. In this work, the potential refers to RHE, that is associated with the KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and pH of the electrolyte using the following equation:65 ERHE = EAg/AgCl (sat.) + EAg/AgCl (sat.) + 0.0591 pH(1)For the PEC measurements, a 0.5 M NaOH (pH 12.5, adjusted by HCl) electrolyte was used after N2 purging to be free of dissolved oxygen. As a source of light, a 150 W Xe lamp was used with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 filter). As a function of wavelength (400 to 700 nm), IPCE (incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency) was measured with an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to measure the cell resistance of each film component using a standard potentiostat (AUTOLAB/PGSTAT, 128 N) with the range of frequency from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz at an amplitude of ±10 mV. To estimate the charge carrier densities and flat-band potentials (VFB) of films, the Mott–Schottky plots (Auto-lab PGSTAT128N, Nova) were obtained with a frequency of 1 kHz using the same electrochemical configuration and electrolyte.
Results and discussion
To analyze the phase compositions and crystalline properties of Ta3N5 NT photoanode films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2(a). Base peaks denoted by asterisks in this figure came from the Ta substrate. All Ta3N5 NT films exhibited a well-crystallized orthorhombic structure, with N phases showing excellent agreement with the standard data (JCPDS 79-1533).66 Diffraction peaks of Ta3N5 NT films at 17.31°, 24.47°, 26.00°, 30.12°, 31.45°, 35.01°, 36.04°, 46.71°, 53.71°, 57.40°, 62.74°, 69.07°, and 84.66° well corresponded to the (202) (110), (111), (112), (023), (130), (113), (200), (152), (223), (242), (117), and (084) reflection planes, respectively. An enlarged view of the diffraction peak around the (110) plane (Fig. 2(b)) clearly showed that peaks of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films were slightly shifted to a lower 2θ degree, demonstrating partial substitution of Sn cations into the Ta3N5 lattice. That is, the enlargement of the d-spacing lattice of the corresponding crystal plane stemmed from the substitution of Sn cations into Ta5+ lattice sites of Ta3N5 because the ionic radius (69 pm) of Sn4+ cations was a little bit larger than that (64 pm) of Ta5+ cations. However, no other peaks on GaN or Co(OH)x-loaded Ta3N5 NT films were found, probably due to the small loading of GaN and Co(OH)x layers. It was also noticed that the XRD intensity of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films was slightly reduced after the incorporation of Sn cations into Ta5+ lattice sites of Ta3N5. After deposition of GaN, the XRD intensity was steadily enhanced again due to the two-time nitridation process to convert Ga(OH)x into GaN, which could reduce pore diameters of nanotubes and enhance the crystallinity of the film via more incorporation of nitrogen source.

To understand the morphological variations of samples, surface and cross-sectional FE-SEM views of Ta3N5 NT films were compared, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a and b) clearly shows that the annealed Ta3N5 NT film after the 1st and 2nd anodizations was covered with a thin surface of blocking layer which almost blocked nanotubes' pores. To obtain an open fine Ta3N5 NT film surface without a blocking layer, ICP-RIE was carried out for the Ta3N5 NT film. It was found that surface containments were completely removed with the open-nanotubular structure shown on the top surface, as displayed in Fig. 3(c). The pore diameter of about ∼70 nm and a cross-sectional length of ∼2.5 μm were achieved for Ta3N5 NTs. Cross-sectional views of Ta3N5 NTs (Fig. 3(g–i)) showed a well-ordered nanotubular structure closely interconnected with each other. The small diameter of Ta3N5 NTs might be due to the more incorporation of N phase in the grain boundary with a high-temperature displacement of lattice oxygen ions, which can enlarge the active area of surface by creating smaller-diameter NTs. In the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film (Fig. 3(d)), there was no change in surface morphology or cross-sectional thickness. It was found that the pore diameter was slightly reduced to ∼65 nm. In the case of the GaN-passivated film, a uniform coating of GaN layer formed by electrodeposition for 3 min via Ta3N5 NTs was definitely observed, as shown in Fig. 3(e). With the increase in time to 5 min, the GaN layer was thicker and partial agglomeration was observed, with partial blocking on the top surface region (not shown here). Furthermore, a deposition time of less than 3 min was not long enough time to achieve a uniform deposition. Finally, after surface deposition with Co(OH)x as a co-catalyst, the two-dimensional (2D) sheet-like layer was uniformly deposited on the GaN/Ta3N5 NT surface (Fig. 3(f)).

To evidently investigate the microstructured crystalline features and chemical compositions of Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, HR-TEM was performed to measure SAED patterns. To confirm the proportion and orientation of elements, EDX spectra of each film were recorded from BF (bright-field) TEM images. Fig. 4(a1, b1, c1 and d1) show the HR images of Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, respectively. The nanotubular structure was similar to that shown in the FE-SEM images (Fig. 3). Bare Ta3N5 NT films (Fig. 4(a1)) showed a well-ordered porous NT-like crystal structure. The presence of Sn was observed in Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films (Fig. 4(b1)). Meanwhile, the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film was completely covered with the GaN layer and the heterogeneity of Ta3N5 NT crystals and the GaN phase was clearly observed, as shown in Fig. 4(c1). After surface deposition with Co(OH)x as a co-catalyst, it was noticed that a 2D sheet-like amorphous layer was uniformly deposited on the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT surface (Fig. 4(d1)). Fig. S1† shows the exact thickness of GaN. The bright-field HR-TEM image was used to calculate the GaN thickness and it was almost 24 nm. Moreover, from the bright-field HR-TEM image of Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, we can clearly differentiate the crystalline GaN phase and amorphous Co(OH)X phase (Fig. S1†). HR lattice fringe images (Fig. 4(a2, b2, c2 and d2)) confirmed that the d-spacing of the (110) plane was assigned to the orthorhombic phase of the anodic Ta3N5 NTs and that widths between lattice fringes were 0.362, 0.363, 0.365, and 0.365 nm for Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, respectively, revealing almost the same value. For GaN-deposited Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films (Fig. 4(c2)), the GaN layer completely covered the whole Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, which affords excellent mechanical stability promoting the separation and transformation of electron–hole carriers. In case of Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, a shadow layer of amorphous Co(OH)X co-catalysts was clearly noticed. Furthermore, to ensure the crystalline phase at the interface, the SAED pattern of each film was measured, as shown in Fig. 4(a3, b3, c3 and d3). The SAED pattern of the Ta3N5 NT film (Fig. 4(a3)) revealed a single-crystalline diffraction ring indexed to the (110) plane, which explained its monocrystalline nature. Meanwhile, the concentric broad ring with several distinct spots revealed the presence of mixed polycrystalline phases from the Ta3N5 NT film, as shown in Fig. 4(b3) and (c3), under doping and post-treatment conditions, respectively. The distinct bright dots in the SAED pattern shown in Fig. 4(d3) assured that randomly oriented crystallites were mixed with the Ta3N5 NTs and GaN phase in Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films. Bright-field HAADF images (Fig. 4(a4, b4, c4 and d4)) showed the mapping of elements. Fig. 4(a5–a7) shows the well-defined element distribution of Ta and N through the Ta3N5 NT film. Homogeneous distribution of Ta, N and Sn elements was also detected, proving the uniform incorporation of Sn elements into Ta3N5 NTs (Fig. 4(b5–b8)). Additionally, the color intensity in the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film (Fig. 4(c5–c9)) was increased with the increase in the loading of each element. Particularly, the color intensity of N element was the maximum in the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, indicating the existence of more N elements. The mapping distribution of each element in the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film showed an induced crystallinity with an exclusive morphology possibly due to the two times of nitridation. Furthermore, the color intensity of Ta elements was comparatively weak, indicating a minor presence of Ta due to the uniform coverage of GaN.

Tables in the inset show atomic percentage (at%) of each element detected in the EDX spectra. 
Moreover, from the mapping distribution of each element in the Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film (Fig. 4(d5–d10)), a uniform distribution of Ta, N, Sn, Ga, and Co elements was confirmed. EDX analyses of the Ta3N5 NT film revealed that atomic percentages (at%) of Ta and N elements were 46.48 and 53.50, respectively, confirming the formation of a stoichiometric Ta3N5 NT film. The atomic percentages (at%) of Ta, N, and Sn elements in the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film were 44.08, 54.40, and 1.42, respectively, confirming the existence of Sn ions in the Ta3N5 NT lattice. In the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, atomic percentages (at%) of Ta, N, Sn, and Ga elements were 38.15, 56.86, 1.22, and 3.67, respectively. The GaN-deposited Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film exhibited the highest N content due to the deposition of the GaN layer. After deposition of Co(OH)x co-catalysts in the Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, atomic percentages (at%) of Ta, N, Sn, Ga, and Co were 37.78, 55.05, 1.06, 2.38, and 3.15, respectively, confirming the incorporation of Co-based co-catalysts.
XPS was conducted to assure the compositions and bonding states of Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films. Fig. 5 shows the core-level XPS spectra of Ta, N, Sn, Ga, and Co species in Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films. In the case of core-level Ta 4f spectra, two sets of double-peak structures were shown due to the orbit–spin splitting to two states of Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2. Compared with neutral Ta (21.7 eV), Ta 4f peaks in Ta3N5 NTs were shifted to high BE sites at 24.80 eV (Ta 4f7/2) and 26.68 eV (Ta 4f5/2) attributed to the incorporation of the electron-drawing N phase.67 In the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, BEs of Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 were at 25.79 eV and 27.67 eV, respectively. They were up-shifted to the high BE sites due to Sn doping. Evidently, the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs exhibited a higher BE than that of the bare Ta3N5 NTs, resulting in a higher electronegativity of Sn (1.96) than that of Ta (1.5). Due to the higher electronegativity of Sn compared to Ta, it can draw more electrons toward it and lower electron cloud around Ta, which shifts the peak to the high BE side. After deposition of a GaN passivation layer onto the Ta3N5 NT film, Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 components had BEs of 25.86 eV and 27.75 eV, respectively, showing more up-shift to high BE sites due to more incorporation of the electron-drawing N phase. As for the deposition of Co(OH)x, the peak shift toward a lower BE side indicated the incorporation of lower electronegative Co at grain boundaries of the Ta3N5 NT film. In the core level of Ta 4p and N 1s spectra (Fig. 5(b)) of the Ta3N5 NT film, the BEs of Ta 4p and N 1s were about 403.60 eV and 396.42 eV, respectively. As shown in (Fig. 5(b)), the Ta 4p peak was distinctive. The N 1s peak usually originates from Ta–N bonding. In the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs, BEs of the N 1s peak moved to maximum BE levels, leading to more electronegativity of Sn compared to Ta. In GaN-deposited films, BEs of the N 1s peak were slightly shifted to higher BE, notifying a gradually increased incorporation of more electronegative nitrogen (3.04) compared to Ga (1.81) in the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film. In the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, Ga–N bond peak appeared at BE of 398.74 eV. However, for the Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, the peak shifted toward the lower BE direction. It might be attributed to the accumulation of lower electronegative Co oxide at grain boundaries. Fig. 5(c) shows the fitted core-level Sn 3d XPS spectrum of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films. Sn 3d peaks were decomposed into two peaks with BEs of 496.11 and 487.62 eV assigned to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 components, respectively, confirming successful doping of Sn(IV) cations into the Ta3N5 NT film. In addition, there were small higher BE shifts occurring in both Sn 3d peaks in GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film with more N incorporation and Ga LM4 orbit resonance peak. After deposition of Co(OH)x, the peak shifts toward a lower BE side, indicating the incorporation of lower electronegative Co at grain boundaries of the Ta3N5 NT film. In the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, the spectrum obtained for Ga 2p consisted of Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 at 1118.94 and 1145.89 eV, respectively (Fig. 5(d)). In the Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 peaks showed almost identical BE at 1118.16 and 1145.06 eV. Fig. 5(e) shows the fitted core-level Co 2p XPS spectra of Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film. Co 2p peaks were decomposed into two peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 with BEs of 781.22 eV and 797.43 eV, respectively, which confirmed the successful deposition of Co(OH)x. Satellite peaks for Co 2p at about 786.44 eV and 803.01 eV are good indicators of the existence of Co ion. Satellites are due to a sudden change in the coulombic potential as the photoejected electron passes through the valence band.68 Moreover, the XPS spectra of the Co(OH)X/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film were measured after the PEC test (Fig. S2†). After the PEC test, the XPS spectra are almost identical to the previous XPS spectra except the Co 2p peak. Moreover, this confirms the presence of GaN after PEC, which is giving high performance and stability. The satellite peaks for Co 2p are a good indicator of the existence of Co ions. Satellites (shake-off and shake-up) are due to a sudden change in the coulombic potential as the photoejected electron passes through the valence band. Satellites arise when a core electron is removed by photoionization. There is a sudden change in the effective charge due to the loss of shielding electrons. This perturbation induces a transition in which an electron from a bonding orbital can be transferred to an anti-bonding orbital simultaneously with core ionization.

To understand the optical property of Ta3N5 NT-based films, absorption spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer, and the results are displayed in Fig. 6. All Ta3N5 NT-based films exhibited significant absorption of light from a wavelength of about 600 nm. Onset wavelengths of intrinsic Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films were around 610, 602, 596, and 598 nm, respectively, showing a small difference in the absorption edge. Such difference was attributed to the band-to-band transition from N 2p orbitals to Ta 5d orbitals, in agreement with a previous report.69–71 To estimate the exact optical bandgap energy (Eg) of each film, the Tauc plots (Fig. 6(b)) were constructed using the following formula:72 Ahν = A(hν − Eg)n(2)where α is the coefficient of absorption, A is a constant, h is the Planck constant (eV), and Eg is the band gap energy. From the Tauc plot, it was observed that the Ta3N5 NT film exhibit a band energy gap of 2.05 eV. The optical band gap energy (Eg) value of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films was estimated to be 2.08, which were moderately larger than that of the bare Ta3N5 NT film, with the orbital hybridization of lower-energy O 2p and N 2p resulting in a downshift of VBM with a wider band gap. The Co(OH)x loaded film exhibited no change in the band gap energy.

To analyze the photoelectrochemical behaviors of Ta3N5 NT-based films, the PEC measurements were performed in 0.5 M NaOH solution of pH = 12.5 under one sun-simulated (AM 1.5 G) illumination with light on–off states using a three-electrode system. To obtain more reliable data, results from the 1st LSV run were excluded. Fig. S3† shows the LSV curve of the Ta3N5 NT film annealed at 950 °C for 2 h under light on/off illumination. Two-time-anodized Ta3N5 NT films showed an improved photocurrent density (Jsc) of ∼0.61 mA cm−2 compared to that (∼0.36 mA cm−2) of the one-time-anodized Ta3N5 NTs at 1.23 VRHE. The one-time-anodized Ta3N5 NT film contained the thick surface blocking oxide layer compared to the two-time anodized Ta3N5 NT film, blocking nanotube pores on the top surface to induce unfavorable charge and electrolyte transport. Due to the surface blocking oxide layer, obvious anodic spikes decayed abruptly with the fast recombination of electron–hole pairs. To obtain open and oxide-free fine Ta3N5 NT film surface, ICP-RIE was performed to remove the tube surface blocking oxide layer, yielding a high surface area with a high Jsc value of ∼0.84 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. However, the Jsc value of the stripped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrode was still rapidly down because of the low hole separation kinetics and surface oxidation in water from the Ta3N5 valance band.

Fig. 7a displays the PEC responses of all samples, revealing that all samples exhibited a fast photoresponse in the scanned potential range. The Jsc value of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs was steadily increased to 1.49 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE compared to that (0.84 mA cm−2) of T3N5 NTs. Its onset potentials were negatively shifted from 0.81 VRHE (Ta3N5 NTs) to 0.65 VRHE (Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs). However, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films showed low hole extraction, which induced self-oxidation as a result of low photostability. To improve the photostability of the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrode, GaN was deposited onto the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, leading to significant Jsc improvement. Fig. S4† shows the LSV curves of GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films at different electrodeposition time points from 1 min to 5 min by a chronoamperometric method. With 3 min of deposition, the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film showed a significantly enhanced Jsc value of ∼2.85 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE compared to ∼2.12, ∼2.57, ∼2.23, and ∼1.74 mA cm−2 after 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, and 5 min of deposition. With the increase in electrodeposition time from 3 min to 5 min, GaN layers were densely deposited over the Ta3N5 NT surface and agglomerated, blocking the exposed tube pores of Ta3N5 NTs. The GaN layer with 1 min of deposition exhibited insufficient coverage through the entire surface of Ta3N5 NTs. These results indicated that the properly thin GaN layer with a thickness of ∼24 nm (as shown in S1†) played an important role in enhancing the Ta3N5 NT-based PEC performance. In fact, bare Ta3N5 NTs undergo severe photocorrosion due to their active surface oxidation during the PEC reaction mainly ascribed to photogenerated holes. However, the GaN layer can partially suppress active photocorrosion, thus enhancing the long-term stability of PEC because photogenerated holes could migrate to the surface region, the GaN layer where they are entrapped.

Thus far, co-catalyst loading is considered the effective way to suppress self-oxidation by promoting hole extraction and supplying catalytic active sites for water oxidation.49,73–75 In the present study, with spatial distribution of Co(OH)x as co-catalysts, the photostability as well as the PEC activity is greatly improved. The Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoelectrode (Fig. 7(a)) exhibited a more negative shift (0.42 VRHE) of onset potential with a maximum JSC value of ∼4.58 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under solar light irradiation.
To determine the bulk and interfacial properties of Ta3N5 NT-based films, the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were obtained with EI measurements. In Fig. 7(b), flat-band potentials (EFB) and carrier densities (ND) were deduced using the M–S plots. These were measured using a 3-electrode configuration depending on the applied potential under dark conditions at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz. The x-axis of M–S plot was denoted as the flat-band potential (EFB). dV/d(C−2) reflected that all films had an n-type conductivity. To obtain the exact values of EFB and ND, the following equations were applied:69,76 1/C2 = [2/(e0εε0A2ND)] × [E − EFB − kT/e](3) ND = 2/e0εε0 × [dV/d(1/C2)](4)where ε, e0, ε0, V, and ND are the dielectric constant (∼24) of the Ta3N5 film, electronic charge, vacuum permittivity, applied potential, and carrier density, respectively. EFB and ND values of the bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films are summarized in Table 1. The flat-band potential (∼0.103 VRHE) of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films showed a more cathodic shift relative to that (∼0.287 VRHE) of the bare Ta3N5 NT film. This shift of flat-band potential is probably due to the incorporation of more cationic ions Sn(IV) than Ta5+. In this regard, more band-bending can stimulate a charge carrier transfer to the electrode–electrolyte interface. Sn doping can also introduce defect sites into the lattice of Ta3N5 NTs for charge compensation, leading to a larger carrier concentration and concurrently decreasing surface nitrogen vacancy (VN) defects. This can directly increase the carrier concentration in the film, deducing to a favorable charge transport phenomenon.41 The GaN-deposited film showed a lower slope than that of the Sn-doped film, giving higher carrier densities (5.421 × 1018 cm−3). However, the EFB value (∼0.094 VRHE) was hardly changed relative to Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs due to the extremely thin GaN layer. Furthermore, among all films, the co-catalyst Co(OH)x-loaded film with the lowest slope exhibited more enhanced carrier density at 1.791 × 1019 cm−3, which influenced effective charge transfer/transport events. High carrier densities can also shift the EFB of the Ta3N5 NTs toward the CBM, leading to a larger band bending at the interfacial region between the Ta3N5 NT film and electrolyte. This can result in a rapid charge transfer and separation in the interface.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the overall interfacial charge transfer kinetics of the optimized Ta3N5 NT-based photoanodes in the frequency range from 10 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The Nyquist plots of the bare Ta3N5 NTs, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs and GaN and co-catalyst Co(OH)x-deposited Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoanodes were measured under one sun (AM 1.5 G) illumination with applied (OCP) conditions in a N2-purged 0.5 M NaOH (pH = 12.5) electrolyte. The results are shown in Fig. 7(c). To determine the fitted values of each component, the equivalent circuit was used to simulate raw data (presented in the inset of Fig. 7(c)). Quantitative simulated data and total resistance for each sample are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, there was not much difference in the series resistance value between samples. On the contrary, R1 (9529 Ω) of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films was quite lower than that (17273 Ω) of the bare Ta3N5 NT film. That is, the bare Ta3N5 NT film was in a non-supportive condition for charge separation/transfer in the semiconductor depletion region around the electrode–electrolyte interfacial region. Meanwhile, the succeeding deposition of GaN as a passivation layer resulted in a more reduced interfacial R1. Furthermore, the Co(OH)x-loaded film exhibited the lowest arc radius, representing the lowest interfacial R1 (2354 Ω), lower than those of bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, thus promoting a more favorable charge transfer to the electrolyte under an electrocatalytic cascading medium. These results indicated that reductions of GaN and Co(OH)x layers induced charge transfer resistances, which could be understood by EIS analyses, resulting in increased JSC values for the PEC cell.

Fig. 7(d) shows the IPCE (at 1.23 VRHE) results of bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoanodes to examine the quantum efficiency to show the extent of J as a function of wavelength range. The value of IPCE was determined using the mentioned equation compared to the quantitative J–V curve:77 IPCE = (1240·JSC)/(λ·Plight)(5)where JSC is the photocurrent density, Plight is the incident light (mW cm−2), and λ is the illuminating light wavelength. The IPCE of the Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoanode was stronger than that of other films. In particular, an IPCE of nearly 39% was found at a wavelength of 465 nm for Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film, higher than IPCE values of 6%, 12%, and 19% for bare Ta3N5 NT, Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT, and GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films, respectively. It was also confirmed that the IPCE values of all samples were directly proportional to the J values shown in Fig. 7(a). The J values were clearly enhanced by the absorption of visible light. Moreover, the previous reported Ta3N5-based photoanodes are compared in Table S1† (see also ref. 79–84).
Furthermore, to clearly identify the passivation effect of the GaN layer to support the charge transfer phenomenon, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was measured where photoelectrons accumulated on the surface of the Ta3N5 NT film. Upon stopping the illumination, photogenerated charges were rapidly decreased and electrons were scavenged with acceptor species in the electrolyte as well as undergoing the recombination with trapped holes was corresponded. Fig. 8 shows the open-circuit voltage–time (V–t) spectra of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT and GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films. The decay lifetime of each V–t profile was determined by fitting to a biexponential function with a two-time constant calculated using the following equations:78 y(t) = A0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2(6) τm = (τ1τ2)/(τ1 + τ2)(7)where τm is the harmonic mean of the lifetime and the total half-life is log(2 × τm). The total half-life time of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT and GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films was estimated to be 1.52 and 0.47 s, respectively, indicating that GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films showed a shorter decay lifetime than the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film ascribed to the passivation of surface states or trap sites by the deposition of a controlled thick GaN layer. We also obtained information about the electron–hole recombination process from the high voltage region and the exponential increase region. As a result, the GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film exhibited a higher (VOC) open-circuit voltage (0.118) than that of the Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film (VOC = 0.065). This result indicates that GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film has a much longer carrier lifetime and a lower interface recombination rate than those of Sn-doped Ta3N5 NTs.

The faradaic efficiency and quantity of evolved O2 gas are presented in Fig. S5.† The faradaic efficiency was calculated as ρ = nO2/(Q/4F), where nO2 is the amount of generated oxygen, Q is the total amount of charges passed through the cell and F is the Faraday constant. In this system, the Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoanode was used as the working electrode under an applied voltage of 1.23 VRHE. The faradaic efficiency and quantity of the evolved O2 gas were measured for 150 minutes. The initial faradaic efficiency of the Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film during the initial 30 minutes is about 85%, and it increases with time, reaching 94.19% after 150 minutes for O2 under continuous illumination. It also shows a steadily increased O2 evolution rate up to 150 minutes. This means that the faradaic efficiency and quantity of the evolved O2 gas are both high, probably resulting from the higher photocurrent density and lower onset potential.
To investigate the long-term photostability of the optimized Co(OH)x co-catalyst-loaded GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoanode, chronoamperometric measurements were conducted at a constant potential of 1.23 VRHE for 20 h under constant light irradiation, as reflected in Fig. 9. Compared with the bare Ta3N5 NT film, the Co(OH)x/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT film showed a moderate photostability for the time illuminated with a moderately reduced JSC value owing to the stability of Co(OH)2 and GaN in an aqueous electrolyte medium. Furthermore, the JSC value after the stability test was still higher than the initial value of the bare Ta3N5 NT photoanode. In the future, we will investigate strategies to further enhance the stability of the Ta3N5 NT film based on poor bonding of Co(OH)2/GaN/Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT films.

Conclusions
In summary, highly efficient Ta3N5 NTs have been synthesized using a two-time electrochemical anodization technique in a fluorinated-based electrolyte followed by a high-temperature nitridation in a N2/NH3 gas mixture environment. After ICP-RIE, surface blocking and oxide layer-free open tubular Ta3N5 NT surfaces were acquired. The extended surface area from the opened nanotube structure, the improved charge transfer ability induced by oxygen defects, and the accelerated surface water oxidation simultaneously contributed to the improvement of PEC activity. In the meantime, a Sn4+ cation was incorporated into the lattice of Ta3N5 NT photoanode to make the doped Ta3N5 NT film. The Sn-doped Ta3N5 NT photoanode exhibited a moderate Jsc value of 1.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, higher than that of the bare Ta3N5 NT photoanode. The Ta3N5 NT photoanode showed a poor long-term stability in the PEC cell because of its self-oxidation reaction under solar light irradiation. To minimize it, a thin layer of GaN was introduced onto the Ta3N5 NT photoanode as a hole storage layer, which greatly enhanced PEC performance and stability. The Co(OH)x co-catalyst-loaded photoanode further enhanced the JSC value to 4.58 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE owing to the negatively shifted onset potential and the beneficial charge transfer phenomenon in the interfacial region. This work provides beneficial modifications to develop effective and photostable Ta3N5 photoanodes in terms of morphological control and doping effect.
