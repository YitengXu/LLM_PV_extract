    , Accepted 29th May 2013First published on 29th May 2013AbstractThe synthesis, characterization, electrochemical and photophysical properties of a novel D–π–A indoline organic dye, VCL01, are described. Its performance characteristics in dye sensitized solar cell (DSC) devices under standard AM 1.5G illumination are also investigated. VCL01 incorporates a cyclopentadithiophene unit as the π-bridge between the indoline donor and cyanoacetic acceptor units. In comparison with the reference dye LS-1 containing only one thiophene unit in the π-bridge, VCL01 shows a 40 nm red shift in adsorption, an increase in molar absorptivity and a 0.17 V lower oxidation potential, all consistent with the more conjugated nature of this sensitizer. The efficiencies of VCL01 and LS-1 DSC devices were 4.81% and 6.23%, respectively, which upon >100 min continuous light soaking under AM 1.5G illumination rose to 7.21% and 6.95%, representing an unprecedented 50% increase in efficiency for the VCL01 device. This increase is overwhelmingly due to an increase in photocurrent but, remarkably, Voc also increases by 50 mV upon illumination reflected in transient photovoltage data which indicate that electron lifetime increases considerably also. Time-correlated single photon counting data indicate that the light soaking effect can be partly attributed to improved TiO2/dye interaction leading to enhanced electron injection.
Introduction
Development of dye sensitised solar cells (DSCs) based on organic D–π–A sensitizers1–3 is an active area of research as the properties of these sensitizers can be easily tailored by judicious selection of each individual unit and can be exploited commercially as efficient solar cells for indoor applications4 and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV).5 Compared to those containing triphenylamine donor groups,6–14 D–π–A sensitizers containing indolines15–22 have been much less investigated despite the superior donating ability of these groups and the well-known stability they impart, which is a pre-requisite for long term device stability.
In this present work, we perform a comprehensive study of the novel sensitizer VCL01 (Scheme 1) using the dye LS-1 reported by Li et al.23 as a reference. VCL01 consists of an indoline and cyanoacetic acid and, in addition, a cyclopentadithiophene unit is used in the π-bridge to increase conjugation and the light-harvesting dye properties. Moreover, the long alkyl chains are expected to block the recombination loss reactions between TiO2 electrons and the oxidised electrolyte. Cyclopentadithiophene is used in many efficient D–π–A dyes and for this reason it was coupled with an indoline donor group here for the first time. A dramatic 50% increase in efficiency is observed for VCL01 devices upon continuous light soaking for over 100 min. We ascribe this increase to the improved interaction between the dye layer and TiO2 film leading to an enhancement in electron injection.

Device preparation and characterization
The working and counter electrodes consisted of TiO2 and thermalized platinum films, respectively, and were deposited onto F-doped tin oxide (FTO, Pilkington Glass Inc., with 15 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance) conducting glass substrates. Two different types of TiO2 films were utilized depending on the measurements being conducted. Highly transparent thin films (8 µm) were utilized for L-TAS measurements. On the other hand, efficient DSC devices were made using 9 µm thick films consisting of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (Dyesol© paste) and a scattering layer of 4 µm of 400 nm TiO2 particles (CCIC, HPW-400). Prior to the deposition of the TiO2 paste, the conducting glass substrates were immersed in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) for 30 minutes and then dried. The TiO2 nanoparticle paste was deposited onto a conducting glass substrate using the screen printing technique. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min. The heated TiO2 electrodes were immersed again in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled before dye adsorption. The active area for devices was 0.16 cm2. The counter electrode was made by spreading a 5 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in isopropyl alcohol onto a conducting glass substrate containing a small hole to allow the introduction of the liquid electrolyte using vacuum, followed by heating at 400 °C for 15 minutes. All films were sensitized in 0.125 mM dye solutions in 1:1 acetonitrile:tert-butanol containing 1 mM chenoxydecholic acid overnight at room temperature. The sensitized electrodes were washed with 1:1 acetonitrile:tert-butanol and dried under air. Finally, the working and counter electrodes were sandwiched together using a thin thermoplastic (Surlyn) frame that melts at 100 °C. The electrolyte used consisted of 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile.
The IV characteristics of cells were measured using a Sun 2000 solar simulator (150 W, ABET Technologies). The illumination intensity was measured to be 100 mW m−2 with a calibrated silicon photodiode. The appropriate filters were utilized to faithfully simulate the AM 1.5G spectrum. The applied potential and cell current were measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The IPCE (incident photon to current conversion efficiency) was measured using a home made set up consisting of a 150 W Oriel xenon lamp, a motorized monochromator and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter.
Transient photovoltage (TPV) and charge extraction (CE) measurements were carried out and have been reported before by our own group.26 In CE measurements, white light from a series of LEDs was used as the light source. When the LEDs are turned off, the cell is immediately short circuited and the charge is extracted allowing the electron density in the cells to be calculated. By changing the intensity of the LEDs, the electron density can be estimated as a function of cell voltage. In TPV measurements, in addition to the white light applied by the LEDS, a diode pulse (660 nm, 10 mW) is applied to the sample inducing a change of 2–3 mV within the cell. The resulting photovoltage decay transients are collected and the τ values are determined by fitting the data to the equation exp(−t/τ).
Laser-transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) measurements were similar to those carried out previously.26 Kinetics were recorded in a blank electrolyte consisting of 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and the iodide/tri-iodide electrolyte was used for optimized 0.16 cm2 devices.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route of VCL01 is shown in Scheme 2. VCL01 is obtained by the Suzuki coupling of indoline borate with 6-bromo-4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and K2CO3 in dry THF. The respective aldehyde Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine in CHCl3 and all the intermediates and targeted dyes were fully characterized.
The absorption and emission spectra of LS-1 and VCL01 in solution are shown in Fig. 1 and their photophysical and electrochemical values are collected in Table 1.

LS-1 and VCL01 both show absorption bands in the UV-Vis region of the solar spectrum which are assigned to π–π* transitions. The increase in the molar extinction coefficient and the 40 nm red-shift in the absorption maximum of VCL01 with respect to LS-1 are attributed to the increase in conjugation in this sensitizer afforded by the insertion of the cyclopentadithiophene unit. We note that the absorption maximum of LS-1 at 523 nm is different to that reported at 483 nm by Li et al.23 This can be explained due to the dependence of the absorption spectra of D–π–A organic dyes on their degree of protonation in different acid/base media, as we have observed previously.7 This can be demonstrated by adding triethylamine (TEA) and trifluroacetic acid (TFA) to a solution of LS-1 which shows a blue shift and a red shift, respectively (Fig. S5†). A blue-shifted spectrum corresponds to the deprotonated state and a red-shifted spectrum to the protonated state; therefore, LS-1 as reported in the study by Li et al.,23 would appear to be in the deprotonated state. In any case, both studies show similar absorption maxima for LS-1 immobilized onto the TiO2 film (≈450 nm). It is noted that the absorption spectrum of VCL01 also changes when it is in its protonated or deprotonated state.
Cyclic voltammetry studies (Fig. S6†) indicate that there is a significant difference of 0.17 V in the ground state oxidation potential (Eox) between LS-1 and VCL01 and again the effect of the cyclopentadithiophene unit is apparent in the reduction of the Eox of VCL01. The EHOMO and ELUMO values in eV were calculated using the data in Table 1. The EHOMO and ELUMO values indicate that efficient dye regeneration by the iodide/tri-iodide redox electrolyte (Eredox = −4.75 eV) and also efficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band (ETiO2 = −4.0 eV) is energetically possible for these sensitizers.

LS-1 and VCL01 were used to fabricate DSC solar cells and the device properties are listed in Table 2. Devices were measured after periods of 0 and 120 min of continuous illumination. The best efficiencies were found using 1 mM chenoxydecholic acid as the co-adsorbent. With higher concentrations of chenoxydecholic acid (10 mM), though LS-1 devices increased somewhat in efficiency (also observed by Li et al.),23 that of VCL01 dropped sharply (see Table S1, ESI†). For this reason, a compromise was sought by using a lower concentration of 1 mM chenoxydecholic acid.

Following 0 min illumination, LS-1 shows a superior power conversion efficiency of 6.23% compared to only 4.81% for VCL01. However, following a period of 120 min of continuous illumination, the efficiency of the VCL01 device manifests a dramatic increase in efficiency to 7.21% compared to LS-1 which shows a smaller increase in efficiency to 6.95%. This phenomenon was always observed, however, the time necessary for the efficiency maximum to be reached varied somewhat. This was probably due to small differences in the quantity of dye being adsorbed onto the TiO2 films after sensitization and/or small differences in the TiO2 film thickness. The increase in efficiency is primarily due to an increase in Jsc upon light soaking and was not observed if the cell was left for the same period of time, either in the dark or at a temperature of 40 °C (see Table S2, ESI†), the temperature during device measurement under our solar simulator. The nature of the increase in efficiency is discussed later. It should be noted that the efficiency of the LS-1 device is higher than that reported by Li et al.,23 however, the electrolyte used is different in both studies.
The I–V curves recorded under AM 1.5G radiation and IPCE spectra of the LS-1 and VCL01 devices are shown in Fig. 2. The IPCE spectra show broad absorption in the UV-vis region and a notable spectral red-shift for VCL01. Following light soaking, the increase in device IPCE is consistent with the Jsc data in Table 2. Moreover, the integration of the IPCE data agrees with the Jsc data in Table 2 within an error of 5%.
 Fig. 2  (a) I–V curves recorded under AM 1.5G radiation and in the dark and (b) IPCE spectra for the LS-1 and VCL01 DSC devices. 
The electron density and electron lifetime in these devices were probed using charge extraction (Fig. 3(a)) and transient photovoltage measurements (Fig. 3(b)), respectively. Following 0 min illumination, the LS-1 device shows a slightly higher charge density than the VCL01 device but almost an order of magnitude longer electron lifetime at the same electron density. This explains the 40 mV higher Voc for the LS-1 device. Upon illumination for 120 min, charge extraction data shows an increase in charge density for both devices suggesting a downward shift in the conduction band. Moreover, charge density is now similar in both devices. Transient photovoltage data show that light soaking increases the device electron lifetime, with the increase notably more pronounced for the VCL01 device (over 1 order of magnitude). The difference in the lifetime between LS-1 and VCL01 is, however, narrowed significantly upon light soaking. The similar charge densities and electron lifetimes in the LS-1 and VCL01 devices explains their very similar Voc values following illumination.

Transient absorption spectroscopy was then used to probe charge recombination and regeneration by the I−/I3− redox couple in transparent DSC devices (Fig. 4). The data recorded in the absence of the redox active electrolyte (black) show long-lived decays assigned to the dye cation formed following photo-excitation and charge separation. These kinetics are similar to those which we have observed for D–π–A organic sensitizers previously.7 In the presence of the redox couple, the kinetics become bi-phasic with the loss of the cation signal due to the regeneration by I− and the appearance of a long-lived signal assigned to the TiO2 injected electrons and/or I2˙− (red decay). The t50% (time taken for 50% of the signal to disappear) for the regeneration reaction is estimated as 5 and 200 µs for LS-1 and VCL01, respectively. This difference can be explained by the difference in the ground state oxidation (Eox) potential for these dyes, with the more positive potential of LS-1 of 0.17 V, providing a greater driving force for the regeneration reaction. Such dependence on Eox has been observed before.27
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption kinetics of (a) LS-1 and (b) VCL01 recorded for 1 cm2 area devices comprising 8 µm TiO2 films in the presence of a blank electrolyte (black) and an iodide/tri-iodide redox electrolyte (red). Kinetics were recorded at 800 nm following excitation at 490 nm. 
Returning to the effect of light soaking on device efficiency, generally, for most DSCs regardless of the sensitizer employed, from our experience28,29 and that of other groups,30–32 an increase in efficiency is observed. In an exhaustive study by Listorti et al.33 involving DSC devices prepared with different materials (dyes, pastes, electrolytes, etc.) in different laboratories, the effect of up to 150 hours of light soaking on device parameters was investigated. In all cases, an increase in both efficiency and Jsc was observed and explained due to a downward shift in the TiO2 conduction band resulting in lower Voc. Luminescence lifetime studies indicated that this shift resulted in both faster electron injection and improved injection efficiency leading to higher Jsc and cell efficiency despite the lower Voc. Moreover, the device electron lifetime measured by transient photovoltage measurements was also found to increase with light-soaking.

LS-1 and VCL01 devices also show an increase in efficiency and Jsc following light soaking coupled with a small downward shift in the TiO2 conduction band and an increase in the device electron lifetime. Emission lifetime studies of the LS-1 and VCL01 devices measured using time-correlated single photon counting (Fig. 5) before and after light soaking show negligible differences in lifetimes (see Table S3, ESI†); however, a notable quenching of emission intensity is observed after light soaking. This indicates that light soaking improves the TiO2/dye interaction resulting in improved quenching of the dye excited states by TiO2 electron injection. This also helps to explain the increase in the device electron lifetime following light soaking as the improvement in the TiO2/dye interaction would improve the blocking of the recombination of TiO2 electrons with the electrolyte, with the much larger increase in electron lifetime for the VCL01 device compared to the LS-1 device due to the more bulky cyclopentadithiophene units. It is worth repeating that no such effect was observed by leaving the cells in the dark indicating the positive effect of light soaking over device efficiency in these devices.
 Fig. 5  Emission lifetime decays for (a) LS-1 and (b) VCL01 devices after 0 and 100 min AM 1.5G illumination light soaking measured at a 300 seconds acquisition time. Excitation wavelength was 470 nm and emission wavelengths were 565 nm (LS-1) and 600 nm (VCL01). 
We therefore conclude that the improvement in device efficiency upon light soaking is less due to a change in the TiO2 energetics, as indicated in the study by Listorti et al.,33 and more to do with improved TiO2/dye interaction resulting in a higher injection yield and larger Jsc on the one hand and an improved blocking effect and larger Voc on the other. It should be noted that in this study, light soaking was conducted over a relatively short period of time compared to the study by Listorti et al.33 (150 hours) and the LS-1 and VCL01 devices may also manifest similar device characteristics upon longer periods of light soaking. This work is ongoing.
Conclusions
The synthesis and characterization of a novel indoline D–π–A sensitizer, VCL01, with a cyclopentadithiophene unit in the π-bridge was described and its performance determined in DSC devices. Though initially it showed an efficiency of 4.81%, this rose to 7.21% upon 120 min of light soaking under AM 1.5G illumination, representing an increase of 50%. This increase is mainly due to an increase in Jsc which is reflected in the improved IPCE spectra of devices following light soaking. Charge extraction data indicate a downward shift in the TiO2 conduction band upon light soaking and transient photovoltage data show that the device electron lifetime increases by over one order of magnitude. Time-correlated single photon counting data explain partly that the light soaking effect is due to an improvement in the TiO2/dye interaction leading to enhanced electron injection. Further studies to uncover the nature of the light soaking effect are ongoing.
