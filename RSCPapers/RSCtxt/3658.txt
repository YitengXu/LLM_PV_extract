    , Accepted 7th September 2017First published on 27th September 2017AbstractIntroduction of Lewis acid–base adducts is an efficient way for achieving high quality perovskite films. In this work, we investigate the influence of Lewis bases on the annealing process of perovskite films, and three Lewis bases with different melting points and boiling points including DMSO, urea and thiourea are chosen. The interaction between the Lewis base and PbI2 as well as the residual time of Lewis bases in perovskite films while annealing has been investigated. In the meantime, directly spin-coating urea or thiourea on perovskite films is also performed to study the effect of Lewis bases on the perovskite crystallinity and morphology during annealing. It is found that the existence of Lewis bases in the annealing process could significantly promote the perovskite grain growth. DMSO can be removed within a few minutes whereas the residual time of thiourea is longer than that of DMSO and urea, consistent with their boiling points. As a result, the grain sizes of the thiourea-based perovskite film increase continuously whereas the DMSO-based sample shows an obvious ripening effect only in the first few minutes. To take advantage of the ripening effect, synergistic systems of DMSO and a small amount of urea or thiourea are further adopted for fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The device based on DMSO/urea presents the best PCE of 20.06%, higher than 18.8% for the device based on DMSO and 8.35% for the device based on urea.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and potential low cost. In only a few years, their PCEs have rapidly increased from 3.8% to over 22%.1–8 Generally, perovskite films can be fabricated by a solution-processed method, vapor phase deposition or the two together.6 Therein, the solution-processed method has been widely used due to its low-cost and facile process, and PSCs with PCEs of over 22% have been based on this method so far. Currently, two main strategies are usually adopted for improving the crystal quality of solution-processed perovskite films: composition engineering and effective fabrication process control. Compared with the widely studied CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as the standard perovskite composition, a mixed perovskite can exhibit better cell performance and stability by partially replacing I− or MA+ ions.8–10 And these mixed perovskite compositions can influence the properties of perovskite films including band gaps,11 trap state density, stability, etc.8,12 Fabrication process control mainly focuses on the modification toward the perovskite nucleation and crystallization processes without changing the perovskite composition, which will strongly influence the film morphology, crystallinity, grain size, etc. And several methods have been reported such as solvent engineering,13,14 the Lewis acid–base adduct approach15–17 and solvent annealing.18
In the early stage of the Lewis acid–base adduct approach, PbI2 or PbBr2 acts as a Lewis acid while polar aprotic solvents (mainly dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)) are used as Lewis bases in the perovskite precursor solution.17 Subsequently, other Lewis bases containing lone pairs on oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen atoms such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) and thiourea17,19 are also employed.20–22 Perovskite films with desired morphologies are obtained when the adduct as an intermediate is decomposed. Lewis bases are generally removed through intramolecular exchange,23 solvent extraction19 and thermal annealing.8 Intramolecular exchange does not basically lead to volume expansion; therefore, Lewis acid–base adducts by weak chemical interaction have been an efficient way to control reaction and nucleation processes.23–25 In the meantime, in this concept, the Lewis base works mainly before the adduct decomposition, and the residual Lewis base is generally considered to have a negative effect on the cell performance.19
DMSO is the most widely used Lewis base in perovskite fabrication technology. For example, a MAI–PbI2–DMSO adduct is involved in the MAPbI3 precursor for a one-step method.15 DMSO molecules can react with PbI2 to afford PbI2(DMSO) or PbI2(DMSO)2, which have been used in a two-step sequential method.24 Besides, the solvent annealing approach can also increase the crystallinity by introducing DMSO vapor while annealing, in which DMSO is supposed to interact with the adjacent perovskite grains to form a liquid or a quasi-liquid phase, leading to the recrystallization of perovskite grains.26,27 In the solvent annealing process, Lewis acid–base adducts also play a crucial role. However, to some Lewis bases with a high boiling point (i.e. thiourea), this effect while annealing is still unclear. And, it is necessary to intensively investigate the effect of different Lewis bases on the properties of perovskite films, which can help us better understand the formation mechanism of perovskite films as well as further controlling the fabrication process.
In this work, we focus on the influence of Lewis bases on the crystallinity and morphology of perovskite films in the annealing process. The residual time of Lewis bases during annealing is compared. It is found that the grain growth obviously occurs before the Lewis base is completely removed. Further investigation reveals that Lewis bases could promote the ripening process. Here, a strategy of combined Lewis bases is highlighted in the fabrication of perovskite films. DMSO/urea-based PSCs can give better cell performance than devices derived from individual DMSO or urea. A PCE of 20% and a steady-state output PCE of 19% have been achieved.
Experimental
Materials
Urea and thiourea were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., PbI2, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and PbBr2 were from Aldrich, methyl ammonium iodide (MAI), methyl ammonium bromide (MABr) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were from Shanghai Materwin New Materials Co. Ltd., N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile and chlorobenzene were from Alfar Aesar, spiro-OMeTAD was from Luminescence Technology Corp., Taiwan. The TiO2 slurry (Dyesol 30 NR-D) for mesoporous scaffolds was from Dyesol. All the chemicals were directly used without further purification. Spiro-OMeTAD chlorobenzene solution was prepared according to the literature.28 The electrode substrates were fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO, thickness: 2.2 mm, Pilkington, sheet resistance: 14 Ω per square). Before use, the FTO glass was first laser-patterned, then cleaned with a mild detergent, rinsed with distilled water several times and subsequently with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, and finally dried under an air stream.
Fabrication of perovskite films and PSCs
Al2O3 substrates for PL measurement were prepared via 100 deposition cycles on the glass substrate by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD).29 A compact TiO2 layer was obtained by spin-coating an n-butyl alcoholic solution containing 0.125 M titanium isopropoxide and HCl on the FTO glass, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 60 min. A 150 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer was further deposited on the top of the compact TiO2 layer by spin-coating a 30 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticle dispersed solution in ethanol, and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. TiO2 films were further treated with aqueous TiCl4 solution (25 mM) at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by spin-coating acetonitrile solution of LiTFSI (0.1 M),28 and finally sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
Perovskite precursors were prepared by dissolving 1.32 M PbI2, 0.12 M PbBr2, 1.08 M FAI, 0.24 M MAI, 0.12 M MABr and different Lewis bases in DMF. The mixed perovskite was described as (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08. A total of six precursor solutions were involved. The precursor solution with DMSO was prepared by dissolving the mixture in 0.8 mL DMF and 0.2 mL DMSO, the precursor solution with urea or thiourea was prepared by dissolving the mixture and 1.44 M urea or thiourea in 1 mL DMF, and the precursor with a mixed Lewis base of DMSO and urea (or thiourea) (defined as DMSO/urea and DMSO/thiourea, respectively) was prepared by dissolving the mixture and 5% molar ratio of urea or thiourea in 0.8 mL DMF and 0.2 mL DMSO. For comparison, the precursor without the Lewis base was also prepared by dissolving the mixture in 1 mL DMF.
Perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating precursors with DMSO, DMSO/urea and DMSO/thiourea on the top of mesoporous TiO2 films first at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 5000 rpm for 30 s. During the second step, 120 μL chlorobenzene was dropped after 15 s to remove extra DMF/DMSO and facilitate the perovskite crystal growth. For the precursors with urea or thiourea or without the Lewis base, the film fabrication processes were the same as the above except for 100 μL chlorobenzene was dropped on the substrate after 6 s. Perovskite films for devices and PL measurement were heated at 150 °C for 10 min and then at 100 °C for 40 min. A 200 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited on the surface of the perovskite layer by following the literature.28 Finally, an 80 nm-thick Au photocathode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a vacuum of 10−7 Torr. Perovskite films for the ripening test were heated at 100 °C for 1, 10 or 40 min. The samples for the Lewis base post-treatment test were first heated at 100 °C for 10 min and cooled down, then spin-coated with isopropanolic solutions of urea or thiourea (5 mg mL−1) and finally annealed for 30 min. All the precursor preparation and spin-coating processes were carried out in a glovebox.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4800. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer using CuKα as the radiation source. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured on a Bruker TENSOR 27. Time-resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a PL spectrometer, FLS 900, Edinburgh Instruments, excited by a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-640) with a wavelength of 638.2 nm and measured at 775 nm after excitation. Carrier lifetimes were estimated by fitting PL curves with a bi-exponential decay model. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics (I–V) were measured on a Keithley 2602 SourceMeter under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from an Oriel Solar Simulator 91192. Devices are masked with a black mask to define the active area of 0.1 cm2. Reverse scan J–V curves (from the open circuit to the short circuit) are adopted here with a scan speed of 30 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
DMSO, urea and thiourea as Lewis bases are chosen in this work, DMSO and urea belong to the O-donor type while the thiourea belongs to the S-donor type (Fig. 1(a)). And the perovskite (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08 is composed of PbI2, FAI, PbBr2, MAI and MABr. First of all, the interaction between the Lewis base and PbI2 is investigated. Fig. 1(b)–(d) show the FT-IR transmittance spectra of Lewis bases, Lewis bases/PbI2 and Lewis bases/perovskites. The SO stretching vibration in pure DMSO is observed at 1058 cm−1, which is shifted to 1022 cm−1 when it is mixed with PbI2.17 This peak is further shifted to 1017 cm−1 when the DMSO is mixed with the perovskite. In the urea system, the CO stretching vibration of urea is observed at 1682 cm−1, which is shifted to 1677 and 1653 cm−1, respectively, when mixed with PbI2 and the perovskite. Similarly, a CS stretching vibration in thiourea appears at 730 cm−1, which is shifted to 713 cm−1 when mixed with PbI2 or the perovskite.17,19 Obviously, these peak shifts of CO, CS and SO stretching vibrations indicate that, there is indeed coordination between Lewis bases and PbI2 or the perovskite.

PbI2–Lewis base adduct films are fabricated by spin-coating the precursor with an equimolar amount of PbI2 and the Lewis base, which are dried in a vacuum for 10 min. Then, these adduct films are annealed at 100 °C for some time. As we know, DMSO is liquid at room temperature with the melting point of 19 °C and boiling point of 189 °C, whereas urea and thiourea are solid at room temperature with the melting points of 133 and 182 °C, respectively. Therefore, the volatilization temperature of these three Lewis bases while annealing is supposed to be in the order of thiourea > urea > DMSO. Here, the corresponding XRD patterns are also shown in Fig. 2. We can see that, the PbI2 sample without using the above three Lewis bases shows a typical peak at 12.7° with no obvious change before and after the annealing process. In the PbI2–DMSO adduct, however, its main peak is around 10° when the film just forms, which will disappear during annealing while the PbI2 peak gradually emerges at a dominant position as well. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the PbI2–urea sample shows relatively complicated XRD patterns including PbI2 at 12.7° and urea at 22.3° as well as the adduct at 6.4° before annealing, indicating relatively weak interaction between PbI2 and urea. After annealing for 1 min, the peak assigned to the adduct disappears whereas the urea peak still exists. Both PbI2–DMSO and PbI2–urea adducts can show pure PbI2 peaks after annealing for 10 min; however, the adduct peak of PbI2–thiourea still dominates even after being annealed for 40 min, indicating good thermal stability (Fig. 2(d)). Therefore, according to the XRD patterns, the residual time of Lewis bases in perovskite films irrespective of whether they are in the form of adducts or Lewis bases themselves, is in the order of thiourea, urea and DMSO. Moreover, DMSO and urea can be removed by annealing, however, thiourea cannot.

Mixed perovskite (FAPbI3)0.75(MAPbI3)0.17(MAPbBr3)0.08 is further fabricated as the light absorbing layer for PSCs. In order to reveal the effect of Lewis bases on the formation of perovskite films, the same perovskite composition and different Lewis bases are dissolved in DMF as precursors, which are spin-coated on mesoporous TiO2 layers by solvent engineering treatment.13,14 The as-prepared films are subsequently annealed at 100 °C for different times. For comparison, perovskite films derived from the precursor without the Lewis base are also fabricated. Fig. 3 presents the SEM images of four perovskite films annealed for 40 min. We can see that different Lewis bases have distinctive effects on the perovskite film morphology and crystallinity. In the perovskite film fabricated from the precursor without one of the three Lewis bases, small grain sizes, some cracks and unclear boundaries are found. When DMSO is introduced into the precursor, larger grains form with clear grain boundaries and no obvious cracks or pinholes are found. When DMSO is replaced by thiourea, the largest grain sizes are obtained, and a lower-resolution SEM image is presented since perovskite grain sizes are much larger than those of the other three samples. In the urea-based perovskite film, grain sizes are larger than DMSO-based films but smaller than the thiourea-based film. Details regarding perovskite film morphologies and crystallization behaviour in the annealing process are given in Fig. S1–S4 in the ESI.†

For films prepared without using Lewis bases, the perovskite grain size is about 100 nm after 1 min annealing; however, the grain boundaries are not clear. When the annealing time is prolonged to 10 min, the perovskite grains only grow a little without obvious change in XRD peak intensity. A similar phenomenon is also observed even after 40 min, indicating that annealing has a very limited effect on the crystal ripening process of the perovskite film without the aid of Lewis bases. The perovskite film shows a preferred (110) orientation; however, a PbI2 peak appears after 10 min heating and a small peak assigned to the non-perovskite phase is also observed in the annealing process, see Fig. S1.†30 For perovskite films from the DMSO-based precursor, a compact perovskite film without cracks or pinholes is obtained after 1 min annealing, which grain sizes are about 100–200 nm with clear grain boundaries. Besides, a strong XRD peak is found at 35°, corresponding to the (312) orientation, as shown in Fig. S2(d).†31 While being annealed for 10 min, the grain sizes increase to 200–500 nm. Compared with the control group, the ripening effect can be observed in the first 10 min annealing; however, after 40 min of annealing, the grain sizes do not increase anymore. No PbI2 peak is found for the sample annealed for 10 min; however, a small PbI2 peak appears after 40 min annealing, indicating that slow perovskite decomposition may occur while prolonging the annealing time.
Fig. S3† shows the SEM images and XRD spectra of perovskite films from the thiourea-based precursor. The XRD peak intensity at 14.1° assigned to the perovskite, increases by three orders of magnitude (see Fig. S3(d) and (f)†). Perovskite grain sizes are about 1 μm after 1 min annealing, then increase to 2–3 μm after 10 min annealing and finally to 4–5 μm after 40 min annealing. Besides, grain boundaries eventually disappear in the annealing process. The perovskite film shows a preferred (110) orientation and its XRD peak intensity gradually increases during the annealing as well. Compared with the control group, the ripening effect of thiourea-based samples is more pronounced. However, some impurities (i.e. PbI2, TiO2 and adducts between thiourea and the perovskite) can also be found, as shown in Fig. S3(d),† suggesting that thiourea is not completely removed in the annealing process.
Different from thiourea-based perovskite samples, the perovskite grain sizes from urea-based precursors are in the range from 100 to several hundred nanometers after 1 min annealing, and some pinholes are also found on the surface of the perovskite film. With the annealing time prolonging, the grain sizes increase, grain boundaries become clear and pinholes eventually disappear, as shown in Fig. S4(a)–(c).† According to the XRD patterns in Fig. S4(d),† the perovskite film prefers the (110) orientation, no non-perovskite peaks are observed and perovskite peak intensities increase while annealing. However, a small PbI2 peak also appears after 10 min annealing, which becomes much stronger than that of the control group after 40 min annealing.
Based on the above investigation, we can see that the morphology, the crystallization behaviour and ripening process of the perovskite film are strongly influenced by different Lewis bases. For the sample not using these three Lewis bases, a small grain size is observed with a preferred (110) orientation; however, no obvious ripening effect is found even under thermal treatment. For the DMSO-based sample, a relatively large grain size (200–500 nm) with a preferred (312) orientation is obtained, and the ripening effect can be observed in the first 10 min. For the urea-based sample, a relatively stronger ripening effect is observed for the first 10 min annealing than that for the next 10 min annealing. The thiourea-based sample exhibits high crystallinity with much stronger XRD peak intensity increased by three orders of magnitude, especially the (110) and (220) peaks, and a strong ripening effect occurs in the whole annealing process. In fact, in our experiments, all fabrication processes of these four perovskite films are almost the same except for using Lewis bases or not. Therefore, the grain growth or ripening process of perovskite grains are specifically affected by the residual time of Lewis bases in the perovskite film during annealing.
Recently, it was reported that the treatment of DMSO toward the perovskite film can promote ripening process.18,27 Here, whether the urea or thiourea have the same effect is also investigated. Perovskite films derived from the DMSO-based precursor are employed for further treatment by spin-coating urea or thiourea isopropanolic solutions on perovskite surfaces, which are subsequently annealed at 100 °C for 30 min. We can see from Fig. S5† that, in comparison with the dense film without post-treatment, some cracks appear in the urea treated sample and a strong PbI2 peak is also found in the XRD patterns (Fig. 4(a)), indicating that the post-treatment of the urea will lead to poor crystallinity and unsatisfactory thermal stability of the perovskite. Instead, for the thiourea treated sample, a good quality polycrystalline perovskite with grain sizes of 1–2 μm, no cracks and a non-perovskite phase is obtained, which also prefers a (110) orientation, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Obviously, the post-treatment of urea or thiourea as Lewis bases toward perovskite films can strongly influence the perovskite crystallization behaviour including the ripening process and the crystal growth orientation.
 Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns of perovskite films from the DMSO-based precursor without and with the post-treatment (first annealed for 10 min, then spin-coated with a urea or thiourea isopropanolic solution and finally annealed for another 30 min); (b) I–V curves of devices based on perovskite films obtained from different precursors with DMSO, urea, thiourea and no Lewis base, respectively. 
In terms of the above results, it is thus supposed that spin-coating urea or thiourea on the surface of perovskite films may have a similar effect to the solvent annealing approach.18,27 A preliminary dynamic grain growth (ripening) process is also proposed. An ultrathin urea or thiourea layer is first deposited on the perovskite film surface. Unlike DMSO, urea and thiourea themselves are solid at room temperature; therefore, thermal treatment is necessary to facilitate the interaction between perovskite and thiourea/or urea. Therefore, under annealing at 100 °C, some weak coordination bonds are formed between Pb2+ and thiourea/or urea to afford a kind of “perovskite-Lewis base-intermediate” (Lewis base refers to thiourea or urea). With the annealing time prolonging, gradual escape of Lewis bases simultaneously occurs, which will lead to the decomposition of “perovskite-Lewis base-intermediates” to afford the perovskite film with a reshaped morphology. Accordingly, the crystallinity and grain size of the perovskite film will also change. In our case, as the decomposition temperature of urea is lower than that of thiourea, urea can be more easily removed, thus leading to a relatively shorter ripening process and an unsatisfactory film morphology. Besides, based on our assumption, when the perovskite film is treated with Lewis bases, perovskite grain boundaries may have to experience the regeneration and recrystallization to afford a dense film with larger grains.26
Devices based on perovskite films obtained from precursors with different Lewis basses are fabricated. Fig. 5(a) shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the DMSO-based device. Our device structure in this work is a typical sandwiched structure with a compact TiO2 layer on FTO glass, a 150 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer mixed with the perovskite, a 450 nm-thick perovskite layer, a 200 nm-thick spiro-OMeTAD layer and an 80 nm-thick Au counter electrode. I–V curves and the corresponding device parameters are presented in Fig. 4(b) and Table 1. For the device derived from the precursor without these three Lewis bases, the porous TiO2 film is still filled with yellow PbI2 instead of the mixed perovskite; therefore, the PSC derived from the precursor without the Lewis base gives a poor PCE of 2.63%. When thiourea or urea is involved in the precursor, the PCEs of devices are improved to 3.93% and 8.35%, respectively. However, the device derived from the DMSO-based precursor can give 18.84% PCE. Therefore, all the devices with three Lewis bases can enhance the cell performance to some degree, and the device based on the widely used DMSO shows the highest PCE. Obviously, the introduction of Lewis bases into the formation process of mixed perovskite films is crucial for high quality films.

In order to further investigate the effect of Lewis bases on the properties of perovskite films, time-resolved transient photoluminescence (PL) measurement is carried for different perovskite films deposited on Al2O3 or TiO2 substrates. Fig. 6 shows PL decay curves of perovskite films on Al2O3 substrates, which are derived from the precursors with DMSO, urea and thiourea or without Lewis bases, and the fitted PL carrier lifetimes are given in Table 2. We can see that, when deposited on Al2O3 substrates, the perovskite film from the precursor without three Lewis bases gives relatively short lifetimes of 68.5 and 281.3 ns. When the urea is involved in the precursor, both τ1 and τ2 increase to 162.6 and 429.7 ns, respectively. When DMSO is involved in the precursor, the longest lifetimes can be obtained. However, the thiourea-based perovskite film exhibits the shortest lifetime (τ2) of 123.1 ns although it has the largest grain sizes and impressive perovskite crystallinity, mainly due to the residual thiourea in the perovskite film.19 That is, a small quantity of thiourea in the perovskite film will increase trap densities and recombination possibility, in good agreement with its poor PCEs. A similar variation tendency of the three perovskite films is found on the TiO2 substrate, however, all the three perovskite films show relatively shorter lifetimes due to the charge extraction ability of TiO2 at the perovskite/TiO2 interface, as shown in Fig. S6(a)† and Table 2. For the perovskite film derived from the precursor without these three Lewis bases, similar carrier lifetimes are found on the two substrates, probably due to the existence of non-perovskite compounds in the porous TiO2 film, that is, some electrons are blocked which cannot be rapidly extracted by TiO2, so that the carrier lifetime does not obviously decrease.

Based on the above investigation, an effective way is further adopted in our work by taking advantage of simultaneously using two Lewis bases for ripening. Specifically speaking, in the perovskite precursor solution, DMSO and urea (or thiourea) are dissolved in DMF with DMSO/PbI2 of 2:1 and urea/PbI2 of 0.05:1 in molar ratios. DMSO could help to afford a high quality perovskite film without cracks, which will be completely removed after annealing in a few minutes, but urea or thiourea still exists in the perovskite film at this time. The residual urea or thiourea can further promote the ripening process of perovskite films. That is, DMSO mainly works in the crystallite process while urea/thiourea plays an important role in the ripening process. Fig. 5(b)–(d) show the top-view SEM images of perovskite films derived from precursors with DMSO, DMSO/urea and DMSO/thiourea, respectively. It is found that, a small amount of urea or thiourea involved in the DMSO-based precursor indeed can increase grain sizes, especially for the DMSO/thiourea sample; in the meantime, no obvious pin-holes or cracks are observed. The devices based on these perovskite films are fabricated, which I–V curves are shown in Fig. 7(a) and device parameters are provided in Table 1. Compared with the DMSO based device, the device with DMSO/urea can give as high as 20.06% PCE, mainly due to an improved Jsc and fill factor (FF); however, the DMSO/thiourea composite system gives a lower PCE mainly due to lower FF and Voc.
 Fig. 7  (a) I–V curves of devices based on perovskite films derived from DMSO, DMSO/urea and DMSO/thiourea as Lewis bases; (b) steady-state outputs in photocurrent and corresponding power conversion efficiency and (c) IPCE spectra and integrated photocurrent densities of devices from DMSO and DMSO/urea as Lewis bases; (d) histograms of PCEs measured for a total of 30 devices. 
As we know, the hysteresis phenomenon is widely found in perovskite solar cells and the PCE is different when I–V characterization is carried out in different scan directions. In our I–V characterizations, the hysteresis effect of the devices is also observed (Fig. S7†). Here, to avoid inaccurate estimation of the cell performance, the steady-state output efficiencies of devices based on perovskite films derived from the precursors with DMSO and DMSO/urea are also presented in Fig. 7(b).32,33 We can see that, the steady-state efficiency is slightly lower than I–V curves. The output photocurrent density and corresponding PCE of the DMSO-based PSC are 19.6 mA cm−2 and 17.8%, respectively, when the device is measured at 911 mV, while the output photocurrent density and corresponding efficiency of the DMSO/urea-based device are 20.9 mA cm−2 and 19.0%, respectively, when measured at 908 mV. The IPCE spectra and integrated photocurrent densities of these two devices are also shown in Fig. 7(c). We can see that, the integrated photocurrent densities of the DMSO and DMSO/urea-based devices are 20.87 and 22.0 mA cm−2 with the deviation of 7.6% and 5.2%, respectively, basically in agreement with our experimental data. To further confirm the influence of different Lewis bases on the cell performance, histograms of PCEs of devices based on DMSO and DMSO/urea are shown in Fig. 7(d), and a total of 30 samples for each condition are presented. The average PCE of the control devices is 18.41%, increasing to 19.85% when mixed DMSO/urea is used.
Further time-resolved PL decay investigation is carried out to elucidate the effect of the DMSO/urea or the thiourea composite system on the cell performance. As shown in Fig. 6(b) and Table 2, when the perovskite films are deposited on an insulated Al2O3 substrate, the perovskite film derived from the DMSO/urea precursor system shows longer carrier lifetime than that from the DMSO/thiourea precursor system. And this variation tendency is in good accordance with that on TiO2 substrates, see Fig. S6(b).† It is thus suggested that the DMSO/urea system has a positive effect on carrier lifetime whereas the DMSO/thiourea system has a negative effect. Surprisingly, on the TiO2 substrate, the carrier lifetime of the perovskite film derived from DMSO/urea is shorter than that of the DMSO based sample. As we know, in PL measurement, excitons are quenched either by the recombination in the perovskite film or by extraction at the interface. As the sample from DMSO/urea on insulated Al2O3 shows a longer carrier lifetime, it is thus suggested that the extraction effect is more significant for the DMSO/urea based sample, also indicating its much better charge transportation ability.
Conclusions
In this work, the effect of Lewis bases on the ripening process of perovskite films has been investigated. DMSO, urea and thiourea are used to control the fabrication process. Infrared spectra confirm the interaction between the Lewis base and PbI2/or perovskites. It is found that the residual times of the three Lewis bases in the perovskite film during annealing are different. That is, DMSO can be removed in a few minutes, leaving behind relatively small perovskite grains while annealing; however, thiourea shows the longest residual time with continuous increment in both the grain size and perovskite crystallinity. Further investigation on post-treatment toward annealed perovskite films by spin-coating thiourea/or urea has also been carried out, indicating that the introduction of Lewis bases can further promote the ripening process and help grain growth, and a preliminary mechanism is also suggested. Finally, an effective method by simultaneously using a DMSO and urea/or thiourea mixed system is developed for high quality perovskite films. As high as 20.06% PCE has been achieved by the system based on DMSO/urea, with a steady-state output PCE of 19.0%. It is suggested that in this Lewis base composite system, DMSO mainly plays a role in the crystallite process while the urea plays an important role in the ripening process. Therefore, developing synergistic mixed Lewis base systems is a promising way to further improve the performance and stability of PSCs.
