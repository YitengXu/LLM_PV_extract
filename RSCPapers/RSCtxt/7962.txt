    , Accepted 7th July 2020First published on 8th July 2020AbstractThe irreversible formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film on semimetal/semiconductors impedes the electrochemical migration of K+ in potassium-ion batteries due to the inevitable volume expansion of the anode materials. Herein, we report the in situ exsolution of Ag in metastable nanostructured AgBiS2 to spontaneously assist cycling for K+ intercalation. The in situ XRD and ex situ HRTEM techniques revealed unique phase transitions during the uptake of K+ on account of the mixed ion storage mechanism. During the initial reduction process, AgBiS2 underwent K+/AgBiS2 displacement, K+/BiS2 conversion, and K+/Bi alloying reaction. The exsolution of Ag was electrochemically reduced in the process of K+ insertion and remained as an intermediate charge transmitter to sustain a high reversible capacity of 420 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, superior rate performance of 210 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 and long-term (over 300) cycle stability. This work presents a strategy to resolve the issues of single-element anodes in metal-ion batteries.
Introduction
Potassium ion batteries (KIBs) have received increasing attention due to their advantages of high operating voltage since K has standard a redox potential (−2.936 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) close to that of Li (−3.040 V) and lower than that of Na (−2.714 V), and thus a high energy density is expected for KIBs.1–4 However, compared with Li-ion batteries, large-sized K+ (2.76 Å in size) results in the easier formation of an irreversible SEI film, which covers electrodes and lead to difficult contact with the electrolyte due to the inevitable huge volume expansion. Accordingly, this seriously impedes the electrochemical migration of K+ from semiconductor/semimetal anodes in KIBs. Thus, building a KIB to overcome the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of K+ in the anode reactions is a challenge for material design. In the case of metal sulfide semiconductors, they present a high theoretical capacity, but rapid capacity fading occurs because of their low conductivity and easy structural changes.5–8 Consequently, carbonaceous materials have been proposed to improve the performance of KIBs by either assisting charger transfer or providing additional capacity to the anode in composites, such as SnS2/graphene,9 Bi2S3/N-doped graphene10 and CoS/graphene.11 Another way to help promote the electrochemical performance is to introduce the synergistic effect, i.e. the solid-state alloying strategy has been applied to obtain a homogeneous distribution of Bi and Sb and accurate ratio of Bi/Sb in an alloy.12 Moreover, a more stable SEI film on Bi-based anodes has been achieved to maintain their electrochemical performance via electrolyte salt chemistry, considering the electrochemical properties of potassium salts, electrolyte types and electrode materials.13 However, carbon material-containing hybrids show inefficient acceleration of the ion diffusion rate due to the non-synergistic effect provided by the physical compositing method compared to the synergic effect by the in situ chemical reaction strategy.14,15 The other strategies involve severe synthetic conditions and very complicated routes to obtain suitable potassium salts and corresponding electrolytes. Therefore, the development of better strategies to improve the performance of Bi-based anodes for KIBs is highly necessary.
Bismuth, as the last element of group-VA, is a typical semimetal, which has good affinity with alkali metals especially the large-sized K+.13,16 Li et al. revealed that porous Bi could deliver a capacity of 321.9 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 1.2 A g−1. However, porous networks gradually developed in the pristine Bi, leading to the irreversible formation an SEI film and increase in the contact resistance due to volume expansion.17 Furthermore, in the case of stress/strain caused by volume changes, a nanosized Bi@carbon composite was fabricated to ensure efficient alleviation of the contraction and fast kinetics of the electrochemical reaction.18 Consequently, reducing the particle size and increasing the conductivity of electrodes should be good solutions.19 Silver is a superior conductor, which has been widely employed as a dopant to enhance the memristor performance and efficiency of solar cells.20,21 Inspired by this, we synthesized Bi-containing ternary metal sulfide AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) to combine the superior conductivity of Ag in situ reduced from the AgBiS2 NC matrix. Generally, AgBiS2 crystallizes in a trigonal structure at room temperature and transforms into a cubic phase when heated to 473 K. However, a fascinating cation order-disorder transition occurs in nanocrystals due to the higher numbers of Ag vacancies, which can be kinetically stabilized in the Ag/Bi ordered cubic phase at room temperature coupled with strong Bi–S bond anharmonicity, indicating easier cation migration and more active sites for displacing/alloying in electrochemical reactions.22,23 Thus, AgBiS2 NCs are suitable for boosting the electrochemical performance of KIBs.
Herein, we reveal the critical role of the in situ exsolution of Ag from an AgBiS2 NC anode, enabling high performance potassium-ion batteries. We fabricated and applied AgBiS2 NCs as the anode material for KIBs. Further, we identified that AgBiS2 undergoes K+/AgBiS2 displacement, K+/BiS2 conversion, K+/Bi alloying reactions during the reduction process. However, in the charging process, the host structure cannot be recovered, but the cycling of the battery is stable, and this phenomenon is seldom observed. To the best of our knowledge, the in situ exsolution of Ag from the matrix on account of a mixed reaction mechanism (more than two) in the anode electrochemical reaction to spontaneously assist cycling for K+ intercalation and boost the electrochemical performance is reported for the first time for KIBs. Moreover, this methodology may provide a new direction of designing materials for high-performance KIBs.
Experimental
Preparation of N,N′-diphenylthiourea/diphenyl ether solution
Briefly, N,N′-diphenylthiourea (1 mmol) was added to diphenyl ether (10 mL) and stirred for 30 min with continuous heating at 145 °C under an air atmosphere. Only when the temperature increased, the ice gruel-like diphenyl ether thawed to yield a bright light yellow solution for the subsequent injection.
Synthesis of AgBiS2 nano-octahedrons and Bi2S3 nanorods
Matildite octahedral AgBiS2 was synthesized using a green hot-injection method. Typically, 1.0 mmol AgNO3 and 1.0 mmol BiCl3 were loaded in a 100 mL three-neck flask fitted with a reflux condenser containing 1 mL oleylamine (OAm), 1 mL oleic acid (OA) and 8 mL octadecene (ODE). The mixture was heated to 115 °C and purified under an alternating vacuum and argon atmosphere three times to eliminate adventitious water and dissolved oxygen. Afterwards, the system was heated up to the transition temperature of 170 °C, followed by the injection of 4.5 mL N,N′-diphenylthiourea/diphenyl ether solution at the dissolving temperature of 145 °C via a syringe, and the color of the solution instantly turned black. The reaction proceeded for 30 min with stirring. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the mother liquor was added to 15 mL of hexane and 10 mL of ethanol and sonicated for 15 min to redisperse the NCs and remove all the free ligands in the precursors. Then the solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. The product was purified by several centrifuging cycles and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h.
The fabrication of the Bi2S3 nanorods followed a similar procedure, which is described in the ESI.†
Ligand exchange of OAm, OA-capped AgBiS2 and Bi2S3
The ligand exchange process was carried out according to a reported method. Firstly, a mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)–ethanol solution was prepared by adding 0.6 mL of MPA, 0.5 mL of 30% NaOH aqueous solution, and 1 mL of ethanol to a bottle. Then it was transferred to 5.0 mL toluene solution containing 1 mmol AgBiS2 or Bi2S3 NCs sonicated for 15 min to transfer the NCs from the superincumbent toluene to the underlying solution. The MPA-capped AgBiS2 NCs were precipitated through the addition of 5.0 mL of acetone by centrifugation and washed with the double distilled water and acetone three times.
Material characterization
X-ray power diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/Max 2500V/PC X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromated Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1518 nm). Morphological characterization of the material was performed using a Hitachi SU8020 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken with an FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin F20 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with a Thermo ESCALab 250 analyzer operating in the constant analyzer energy mode.
Electrochemical measurement
Electrochemical measurements were performed using CR2032 coin-type cells. For the preparation of the electrode, the active material, super P, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 were dissolved in deionized water to obtain a homogeneous slurry, and then the resulting mixture was cast on a copper foil. The as-prepared electrode films were dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven, and were divided into small plates with the loading mass of 1.2–1.4 mg cm−2. Glass fiber and potassium foil were employed as the separator and counter electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 M potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) dissolved in dimethyl ether. The half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove-box. Galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles were tested in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V using a Land-2001 (Wuhan, China) automatic battery tester. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were evaluated on a multichannel potentiostatic/galvanostatic system (Bio-Logic SAS, France).
Results and discussion
Pure AgBiS2 NCs with a well-controlled size and novel octahedral morphology were prepared via an eco-friendly hot-injection colloidal approach using N,N′-diphenylthiourea as a sulfur source. According to our previous studies on IV–VI group materials including Cu–Sb–S and Cu–Bi–S, the pre-formed Cu2−xS and Sb/Bi–S nucleus will form and grow to be ternary metal sulfides.24,25 The detailed synthesis process of AgBiS2 is shown in Fig. 1a and the Experimental section. The XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) reveals that all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the cubic phase of AgBiS2 (JCPDS 89-2045). The lattice constants were calculated to be a = b = c = 5.648 Å, and the corresponding crystal structure of cubic AgBiS2 nano-octahedrons projected along [100] was plotted in the inset of Fig. 1b. For comparison, we used the same fabrication method to synthesize Bi2S3, which is described in the ESI.† The corresponding XRD pattern in Fig. S1a† is consistent with the orthorhombic phase of Bi2S3 (JCPDS 75-1306). Also, according to the SEM image in Fig. S1b,† the prepared sample exhibited a nanorod morphology with a length of about 100 nm. The surface chemistry of the AgBiS2 nano-octahedrons was analyzed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. S2a† demonstrates the presence of two symmetric peaks for silver at 367.7 and 373.7 eV with a splitting energy of 6 eV, which are consistent with the reported positions for Ag(I).26 As shown in the Bi 4f core level spectrum in Fig. S2b,† the two characteristic binding energy peaks located at 158.0 and 163.3 eV indicate that Bi exhibits a tri-valence state in the Ag–Bi–S structure.24 The weak peak at 160.9 eV is due to the S 2p electrons, as previously reported.25 These binding energies are in accordance with the reported positions for AgBiS2 NCs with an offset of less than 0.1 eV. The difference in binding energy due to the changes in chemical bonding environment suggests the existence of vacancies, which can provide additional K storage, and thus optimize the performance of KIBs.27

To observe the structure and size of a single unit, both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization were employed. Fig. 1c shows that the octahedral particles with an edge length of 15 nm were uniformly dispersed. The observed lattice spacings of 0.284 nm, 0.328 nm and 0.330 nm correspond to the (200), (111) and (11) planes of AgBiS2 NCs, respectively, as shown in the HRTEM image, indicating the highly crystalline nature of the as-synthesized NCs. The bright spots in the FFT pattern (Fig. 1d) are assigned to the same reflections of the AgBiS2 NCs, as shown in the HRTEM image, which reveals a characteristic octahedral nanostructure, as viewed along the c-axis of the AgBiS2 NCs. Due to the uniform size and shape of the nanoparticles, the NCs form randomly assembled superstructures, as illustrated in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. S3a†). The elemental composition analysis was performed by SEM coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The EDX spectrum of a selected field of NCs (Fig. S3b†) shows that the Ag/Bi/S ratio is close to 1:1:2, which reveals the pure phase of the AgBiS2 crystal structure.
To date, there are no reports on more than two reactions occurring in the same potassium ion cell. Firstly, it is very important to study the detailed electrochemical reaction process to demonstrate our hypothesis. Also, the potassiation–depotassiation behavior of the AgBiS2 NCs prepared by the hot-injection method was comprehensively investigated via a half-cell configuration. Fig. 2a depicts the cyclic voltammograms of the AgBiS2 NCs in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In the first cathodic scan for the AgBiS2 NCs, there is a small peak at 1.03 V, which disappeared in the following scans. This may be attributed to the displacement reaction of AgBiS2 (discussed below). Three distinct couples of redox peaks located at 0.27/0.53, 0.9/1.19 and 1.34/1.88 V can be found in the subsequent cycles, which should originate from the reversible alloying–dealloying reactions of K3Bi, K3Bi2 and KBi2, respectively. Also, the peak existing above 2.0 V is derived from the oxidation of Bi. After the initial scanning, the overlapping peaks in the CV curves indicate the highly reversible reaction between AgBiS2 and K.28

(h) Schematic of the electrochemical reaction process. 
To explore the detailed reaction mechanism during the electrochemical processes, in situ XRD measurement was performed on a potassium half-cell under a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V. Fig. 2c depicts the contour maps in the selected 2-theta angle range, and the corresponding XRD patterns are presented in Fig. S4–S7.† It should be noted that the peak at 46.0° is derived from the Be window, and the peaks at 38.5°, 41.4° and 43.9° are derived from BeO. The peak at 44.8° is attributed to the aluminum current collector. As shown in the Experimental section, copper foil was applied as the current collector. However, X-rays cannot penetrate the copper foil, thus we applied Al foil as the current collector for the in situ XRD test. As shown in Fig. S8,† the discharge/charge curves using the Al current collector are similar to that in Fig. 2b. Combining the reaction sequence depicted in the CV curves in Fig. 2a, a possible reaction mechanism can be concluded. During the initial discharge stage, the intensity of the peaks at 27.2° (102) and 31.5° (104) for AgBiS2 decreased, which disappeared as the discharge further proceeded.
After the electrode was discharged to ∼1.2 V, two new broad peaks at 37.1° and 39.6° were observed from the contour maps, which are ascribed to the in situ exsolution of Ag and Bi, corresponding to the displacement reaction, where AgBiS2 reacts with K to form Ag and KBiS2, and the diffraction peaks of KBiS2 (JCPDS 04-005-3293) are demonstrated in Fig. S9.† Then KBiS2 further reacts to produce Bi and K2S. Due to the poor crystallization of K2S, we could not observe any diffraction peaks from K2S. As the voltage decreased to below 1.0 V, a new phase appeared at 29.5°, which can be ascribed to K3Bi, suggesting the alloy reaction in the lower voltage range. Unlike the first discharge, the following charge reaction process showed a cascade-like characteristic, demonstrating a multistep phase transition. During the charge process, K3Bi was converted to K3Bi2. The charge plateaus at 0.6 V and 1.2 V correspond to the K3Bi–K3Bi2 and K3Bi2–KBi2 transitions, respectively (Fig. 2c).17,29 During the second discharge and charge, the alloying and de-alloying reaction dominate the whole reaction process.28 Therefore, after the first cycle, the main active material of the anode is Bi. We observed that as the reaction proceeded, the phase of Bi disappeared and the phase of KxBiy appeared. Also, after charging, the phase of Bi was formed again. Interestingly, the intensity of in situ exsolution of Ag decreased after discharging and increased after charging, which was repeated with the potassium/de-potassium process, as demonstrated obviously in Fig. 2c. This can be attributed to the rapid constant formation of KxBiy during the discharging process, which showed a strong signal by X-ray detection but overlapped with that of most of the reduced Ag nanoparticles, indicating the in situ exsolution of Ag dispersed and wrapped in the anode materials during the discharging process. Upon charging, K goes to the counter electrode, leaving a high intensity of Ag and Bi. According to the above mentioned phenomenon, we assume that the in situ formation of Ag nanoparticles from the matrix dispersed around KxBiy may instantly help increase the ion diffusion rate by maintaining the contact between the electrolyte and electrode even after the structural change, thus promoting the electrochemical kinetics of K+ in the anode reactions. Consequently, the three couples of the redox peaks in the CV (Fig. 2a) can be attributed to the formation/de-formation of KBi2, K3Bi2, and K3Bi. The small peak at 1.03 V can be attributed to the displacement reaction of AgBiS2.
The alloying reaction occurred at a lower voltage, which was also confirmed by the microstructure transition via ex situ HRTEM. After being discharged to 0.01 V, the HRTEM image of the AgBiS2 electrode (Fig. S10a†) displays clear lattice fringes of 0.37 nm, corresponding to the interplanar distances of K3Bi along the (102) plane. In addition, the lattice fringe of 0.24 nm is related to the d-spacing value of (111) for metallic Ag. When the electrode was fully de-potassiated, the lattice fringe of 0.24 nm observed in Fig. S10b† can be indexed to the d-spacing value of the (104) plane of Bi, whereas, Ag exhibited a quantum dot-like structure after being discharged to 0.01 V. Moreover, ex situ XPS was conducted to test the valence of Ag and Bi during the electrochemical process. When it was discharged to 0.01 V, the main peak located at 377.6 eV corresponds to K 2s due to the large amount of overlapping K+ electrolyte.30 Therefore the symmetric peaks located at 373.4 eV and 367.5 eV (Fig. 2d) of zero-valence Ag are relatively weaker than that in Fig. 2e since most of the K+ moved to the cathode after being charged to 3.0 V.22 Similar to Ag in Fig. 2f, very small peaks of Bi(III) were detected and the overlapping peaks of S 2p are due to the high concentration of K2S on the top layer. Moreover, in Fig. 2g, the peaks of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 located at 163.2 eV and 157.9 eV indicate metallic Bi after being charged to 3 V.13 The valance change in Ag and Bi is in accordance with the XRD patterns in Fig. 2c. Combining the above-mentioned results, the AgBiS2 NCs undergo displacement, conversion and alloy reaction in the initial charge–discharge processes, and a schematic of the reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 3h. Therefore, the detailed reaction is as follows:1st discharge: AgBiS2 + K+ + e− → KBiS2 + AgKBiS2 + K+ + e− → K2S + BiBi + K+ + e− → KBi2 → K3Bi2 → K3Bi1st charge: K3Bi → K3Bi2 → KBi2 → Bi

Also, after the initial cycle, only Bi alloyed with K to form KBi2, K3Bi2 and K3Bi, gradually.
The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves in Fig. 3a and b were recorded at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 to study the electrochemical properties of the material. Fig. 3a displays the charge–discharge profiles for the AgBiS2 NCs, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 560 mA h g−1. The platforms of the profiles are consistent with the redox peaks in the CV curves, exhibiting the electrochemical reaction with high reversibility. During the first 10 cycles, the specific capacity of the AgBiS2 NCs decreased (Fig. S11†), which can be possibly attributed to the continuous occurrence of the Ag displacement reaction. After ten cycles, an increase and stabilization of the capacity was observed as the reaction tended to be stable and the active material changed into a smaller nanosized structure, which is favorable for the reaction process by shorting the ion/electron transfer path.11 Finally, the discharge specific capacity of 420 mA h g−1 was obtained (Fig. S11†). Fig. 3b shows the voltage polarization curves, revealing that the capacity increase in the AgBiS2 NCs is mainly derived from an increase in discharge capacity at high (<1.75 V) and low (<0.3 V) potentials and charge capacity at high (>2.1 V) potentials. This capacity growth can be attributed to the “quasi-reversible” formation of an SEI film, as reported previously for other materials.31 Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of the AgBiS2 NCs increased and stabilizes to over 99% after the fourth cycle, demonstrating their high reversibility. To observe the morphology of the charged state, the ex situ TEM was conducted after the 1st cycle and 45th cycle. As shown in Fig. 3c, only a few original NCs still existed (in the rectangle) after the 1st cycle, indicating the regular octahedrons collapsed to form a smaller nanostructure. After the 45th cycle, the electrode crumbled to nano-cracks (Fig. 3d), which are favorable to promote the electrochemical reactions.32 With the phase and structure transition of the electrode materials, the AgBiS2 NCs act as a promising electrode material with great long-term cycling performance. As shown in Fig. 4a, the specific capacity of the AgBiS2 NCs at the current density of 2 A g−1 was over 300 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. Since the radius of the potassium ion is larger than that of the sodium ion and lithium ion, the electrochemical reaction of KIBs is supposed to be more sluggish than that of SIBs and LIBs, respectively.12 However, the AgBiS2 NCs exhibited a superior electrochemical performance, which can be attributed to the in situ formation of Ag. In contrast, the cycling stability and rate capability of Bi2S3 were poor, as shown in Fig. S12,† which faded quickly, even though the initial capacity of Bi2S3 was higher than that of AgBiS2 due to its higher theoretical capacity with greater electron transfer. These results well demonstrate the role of Ag in stabilizing the capacity and enhancing the electronic conductivity. Moreover, EIS was performed in different cycles for the AgBiS2 NCs and Bi2S3 nanorods. As shown in Fig. S13,† the Rct of the AgBiS2 NCs in the 1st cycle and 5th cycle is much smaller than that of the Bi2S3 nanorods, showing that the electron transfer of AgBiS2 is much faster. The EIS results further confirmed our hypothesis that the in situ exsolution of Ag acts as an intermediate charge transmitter to sustain the high performance and long cycling stability of the AgBiS2 anode.

As reported previously, Ag rarely participates in the electrochemical reaction. It has been also elucidated that the in situ generation of a highly conductive Ag matrix within the electrode during anode reduction will accelerate the ion diffusion rate in the electrochemical reaction.26,33 Ag is reported to be a type of special metal, which can be extracted easily from metal sulfides.34 Here, in terms of AgBiS2, as the reaction proceeds, the in situ formed Ag during the first cycle dispersed around the surface of the electrode material, helping to increase the conductivity of the electrode and relieve the volume expansion. Moreover, the in situ formation of Ag can overcome the sluggish feature of KIBs by activating the reactivity of the whole electrochemical reaction.35
The excellent rate capabilities of the AgBiS2 NCs at various current densities ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 A g−1 are plotted in Fig. 4b. As the current density increased to 1.0 A g−1, the specific capacity of the AgBiS2 NCs remained roughly unchanged with a stable CE. Moreover, the AgBiS2 NCs electrode delivered a reversible capacity of 210 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 5 A g−1. To the best of our knowledge, few K-ion battery anode materials can reach a high current density and exhibit a value of over 200 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4b). Additionally, a reversible capacity of 420 mA h g−1 could be recovered when the current was lowered back to 0.5 A g−1. Fig. S14† displays the charge/discharge curves at various current densities, showing stable voltage profiles as the current density increased. The excellent rate capability of the AgBiS2 NCs can be ascribed to the in situ formation of Ag, which increased the electronic conductivity and improved the reactivity of the whole reaction. Moreover, the nanostructure of the active material is favorable for the contact among particles, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transportation.
Thus, to better understand the excellent rate performance of the AgBiS2 NCs, we conducted a kinetic study through cyclic voltammetry (CV) at various scan rates. Generally, the total charge storage of K ions consists of two parts, diffusion and (pseudo)capacitive-controlled charge storage. The pseudocapacitive contribution can be calculated from the CVs. Fig. 4c shows the CV curves of the AgBiS2 NCs at various sweep rates ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 with similar shapes, indicating minor polarization at these rates. The relationship between the measured current (i) and the sweep rate (v) can be described as the following power law: i = avb(1)where both a and b are adjustable parameters, and b determines the potassiation and de-potassiation types. The b-value of 0.5 indicates total diffusion-controlled behavior (semi-infinite linear diffusion). If the potassium storage is dominated by pseudocapacitive behavior, the b-value will approach 1. Fig. 4d shows the b-value, which was acquired by fitting the slope. For sweep rates ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1, the b-value for R 1 and R 2 were determined to be 0.73 and 0.70, and for O 1 and O 2 0.80 and 0.62, respectively, suggesting that both diffusion-limited charge storage and capacitive behavior contribute to the observed capacities. Fig. 4e shows a comparison of the rate capabilities of the previously reported anode materials for KIBs with our work. Consequently, AgBiS2 presents a superior performance compared with other materials.36–41
To evaluate the potential of the as-prepared AgBiS2 NCs for practical application, we assembled an asymmetric hybrid K-ion capacitor by applying the AgBiS2 NCs as the anode and commercial active carbon as the cathode (with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 1414 m2 g−1, as shown in Fig. S15†). Fig. S16† shows the XRD pattern of active carbon. As shown in Fig. 5a, the working mechanism of the asymmetrical device is based on the (de)intercalation of K+ in the anode side and absorption/desorption of PF6− in the cathode side. Before assembling the potassium-ion capacitors (KICs), the electrochemical performance of AC was evaluated by applying metallic potassium as the counter electrode, and the CV curves, charge–discharge profiles, cycling and rate performance are shown in Fig. S17–S20,† respectively. To obtain an enhanced energy density, enlarged working potentials (1.0–4.0 V) were applied. Fig. 5b shows the CV curves of the KICs, where the first three cycles overlapped, demonstrating the good reversibility of the device. As shown in Fig. 5c and S21,† the galvanostatic charge–discharge ranging from 0.04 to 6.0 A g−1 was measured. The voltage profiles at these current densities are somewhat different from the linear behavior exhibited in an ideal supercapacitor, which can be attributed to the charge storage mechanism based on a combination of faradaic and non-faradaic reactions. Both the energy and power densities of the device were calculated based on the total mass of the cathode and anode. As depicted in Fig. 5d, a high energy density of 118.5 W h kg−1 was delivered at a power density of 98.8 W kg−1. Even at a high-power density of 8216 W kg−1, it still exhibited 21 W h kg−1. Moreover, the device could also output 40.8 W h kg−1 after 3000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 (based on the total mass of the cathode and anode). Thus, the above results highlight that the AgBiS2 NCs are suitable for practical application. Table S1† shows a comparison of the energy densities of recently reported cathode materials for potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (KIHCs).17,42–47 Considering previous reports on KICs, Liu et al. disclosed the reversible stage transition potassium storage mechanism in graphite intercalation compounds.48 Herein, we introduced the mixed potassium storage mechanism for KIHCs of AgBiS2 NCs, which demonstrated a relative high energy density compared with non-carbon cathodes using commercial active carbon as the counter electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the critical role of the in situ exsolution of Ag from the AgBiS2 NC anode in boosting the performance of K-ion batteries. The whole potassium-ion cell exhibited long cycle stability with a displacement/conversion/alloying mixed reaction of AgBiS2–Ag/Bi–KBi2–K3Bi2–K3Bi. The performance faded during the initial ten cycles, and then continually increased based on the gradual formation of Ag, which was reduced from the matrix, thus promoting the electrochemical kinetics of K+ in the anode reactions. The cycling performance tended to be stable after the 45th cycle, delivering a high reversible capacity of 420 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, superior rate capability with discharge capacity of 210 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 and long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 78% at 2 A g−1 over 300 cycles, which is better than the Bi electrode and the state-of-the KIB anode electrode. Thus, these findings open a new direction in designing and developing high-performance electrode materials for KIBs.
