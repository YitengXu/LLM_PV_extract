Introduction
Mankind's rising standard of living and exponential population growth are dramatically increasing global energy demand. Although this escalation might be countered using existing, fossil-fuel related technology, concerns that such practices may prove unsustainable or ecologically detrimental have seeded a worldwide research initiative to develop alternative energy sources. The sun is our most plentiful energy source, supplying 1.2 × 105 TW of radiation to the surface of the earth. Therefore, solar energy is a logical alternative to fossil fuels, and is the basis for the vast majority of contemporary renewable energy operations.1 While the harvesting of indirect solar energy in the forms of wind, water currents, and biomass has been well developed, direct solar conversion remains prohibitively expensive.
The intensity of incident sunlight fluctuates for all locations on earth, and consequently, associated schemes rely on energy storage in order to provide steady power. One strategy to offset the variability of sunlight is to drive an energetically uphill reaction with radiative energy, analogous to natural photosynthesis. The product could then be preserved, just as plants store carbohydrates, to be utilized at a later time. Rather than carbohydrates, however, dihydrogen is being considered for direct combustion, use in fuel cells, or conversion into liquid fuel through hydrogenation of various substrates. There are many potential hydrogen feedstocks, including alkanes, alcohols, and acids (outlined in Scheme 1), but water is an extremely low energy form of hydrogen, and is likewise the most accessible reservoir on the planet.
 Scheme 1  Potential sources of hydrogen for the formation of H2 fuel. 
The energy required to spontaneously dissect water into its elemental constituents at 298K is 237 kJ/mole. When divided into balanced half reactions as shown in Scheme 2, the overall 474 kJ process of splitting two moles of water involves four electron transfers (ETs) per molecule of O2 produced. If each ET is driven by a single photon, then a minimum energy of 119 kJ is required per mole of photons, corresponding to wavelengths less than 1000 nm. This limit will only suffice if all four ETs happen to be equivalently demanding. In the more likely scenario that sequential ETs occur at different potentials, significantly shorter wavelengths may be required. However, roughly 50% of all photons from the sun are of wavelengths less than 1000 nm, and their combined power accounts for approximately 70% of the solar energy that penetrates the earth's atmosphere.2 Although the energy needed to directly cleave water with sunlight is available, the absorbance of water at such wavelengths is negligible, and more importantly, contemporary catalysts operate at potentials that greatly exceed the thermodynamic requirement. Consequently, current research in photodriven water cleavage focuses on designing A) species that efficiently convert solar radiation into electrochemical potential, and B) catalysts to facilitate H–H and OO bond formation.

Many systems are reported to split water using ultraviolet radiation, but photosynthesis is not useful unless the sun's energy can be recovered with some appreciable efficiency. Since the fraction of available solar power with ultraviolet wavelengths is comparably small, there is pressure on the scientific community to extend our existing ultraviolet limit into the visible region of the spectrum and power water photolysis with more abundant, lower energy light. While there are many approaches to artificial photosynthesis that utilize semiconductors,3 organisms,4 and electrolysis,5 the development of molecular species offers unique insights into the relevant electron transfer processes, and is therefore a field of contemporary intrigue. Additionally, the insights obtained from the development of homogeneous catalytic systems can be extended to fabricating supramolecular materials of practical significance, such as polymers, that provide the desired chemical reactions.
Benchmarks of photocatalysis
The most popular figure of merit for any catalytic system is the catalyst's ability to turn over, or perform the same reaction multiple times. The turnover number (TON) reflects a catalyst's stability under the employed conditions, and thus describes the material's ability to produce a product, irrespective of rate or energetic efficiency. In photochemical reactions, light absorption and charge transport are likewise essential. Full operating efficiency is therefore determined by A) a system's molar absorptivity at the useful wavelengths, B) its quantum yield, or the reaction's competence at making the desired product once a photon is absorbed, and C) its longevity, or TON.
The monetary expense of a photosynthetic operation is equal in importance to its functionality. For this reason, great emphasis has fallen on the development of catalysts derived from inexpensive starting materials, maximizing the power output per cost of fabrication. Accordingly, the final measure of a system's success is the ratio of its full operating efficiency to its inherent costs. Bearing in mind these considerations, the development of a complete photosynthetic system becomes complicated by the need to simultaneously address many criteria.
Compartmentalization
Owing to the inevitable complexity of both powering and directing multiple charge transfers during water photolysis, researchers separate the overall water cleavage reaction into two half cells, allowing independent study of water oxidation and reduction, shown in Scheme 2. Separating the two halves is made possible by introducing sacrificial electron donors or acceptors as surrogates for the missing complementary half reaction. The specific choice of these moieties dictates the energetic potential of the net reaction, and is therefore relevant in developing a system that truly converts photonic energy into a chemical fuel. Typical sacrificial reductants for the formation of dihydrogen are tertiary amines such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), triethylamine (TEA), and triethanolamine (TEOA), which decompose after a one electron oxidation, allowing for maximal cage escape yield.6 Meanwhile, typically chosen oxidants include persulfate, cobalt(III), and cerium(IV), all of whose oxidative potentials are strong enough to be considered irreversible. There are very few examples of molecular catalysts that have been successfully employed in photochemical oxygen production.7 Instead, most water oxidation experiments have employed the sacrificial oxidant, rather than light, as the source of energy.
The intricate problems associated with molecular solar conversion can be further simplified by regarding each reaction criterion in turn, rather than in concert. Fundamentally, photosynthesis is the two step process of absorbing light and forming a fuel/oxidant pair. By independently developing species capable of absorption or catalysis, it becomes possible to fine tune each component individually before reassembling them into a complete catalytic cycle. This modular approach has led to many recent contributions, categorized by these same key disciplines in the following report.
Light absorption and charge separation
Typically, light-driven water photolysis starts with photoinduced charge separation. A molecular photosensitizer (PS) may absorb a photon to generate a vibrationally and electronically excited state, which quickly relaxes to the lowest-lying excited state, PS*. This excited state may then be quenched by another species via electron transfer, provided PS* is sufficiently long-lived. While conjugated organic molecules have been used as photosensitizers,8–10 the majority of employed molecular dyes rely on metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitations of transition metal complexes that exhibit considerable absorbance and excited state lifetimes. Some of the most studied molecular architectures in solar energy absorption are polypyridyl complexes of ruthenium(II). Tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+) possesses strong absorbance in the visible spectrum (ε ≈ 14000 M−1cm−1, λmax ≈ 450 nm) and microsecond lifetimes at room temperature.11 However, it was found that the emission energy of ruthenium(II) tris-diimine complexes cannot be adjusted through ligand modification due to the presence of a low lying triplet metal centered (3MC) excited state.12 The detrimental effect of this very short-lived and accessible 3MC state is further compounded by the fact that its populated anti-bonding, eg*-like molecular orbital (MO) weakens the metal–ligand bond, promoting photosensitizer degradation through ligand dissociation.
In an effort to alleviate the constraint of the 3MC state, third row transition metals such as iridium and platinum have been targeted as more tunable photosensitizers, since their greater ligand field splitting allows for a broader range of populated/unpopulated MO gap energies. Additionally, the absolute energies corresponding to the highest populated and lowest unpopulated MOs of heteroleptic iridium complexes incorporating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) and bpy can be adjusted independently of each other through chemical substitution on the peripheries of the ppy and bpy ligands, respectively.13–15 This ability to selectively tune the critical MOs may prove indispensable in reuniting the PS with a pair of optimized catalysts.
To advance the discipline of water splitting, the Bernhard group has synthesized a variety of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes of the general structure [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ that exhibit a broad range of photophysical properties (C^N = cyclometalating ligand and N^N = neutral diimine ligand). By fabricating a high-throughput photoreactor that illuminates samples with blue light emitting diodes (LEDs), it was shown that the heteroleptic cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes significantly outperform ruthenium(II) tris-diimine photosensitizers in photocatalytic systems that utilize a [Co(bpy)3]2+ catalyst and TEOA as a sacrificial reductant.16 The thermodynamics of charge transfer between PS* and sacrificial reductant were determined by fluorimetry and electrochemistry to be identical for the parent dyes (E0′ *Mn+/M(n−1)+ = +0.68 V vs. SCE for [Ir(ppy)2bpy]+ and [Ru(bpy)3]2+). However, the authors demonstrate that a reductive quenching mechanism, shown in Fig. 1, is exclusively available to the iridium complexes. This was first substantiated through flash photolysis quenching experiments, and later justified computationally. By observing the orbital density of the highest singly occupied molecular orbital (HSOMO) and the lowest singly occupied molecular orbital (LSOMO) of each complex obtained through DFT calculations (Fig. 2), the difference in quenching susceptibilities between the two luminophores was rationalized: in the triplet state of [Ir(ppy)2bpy]+, significant LSOMO orbital density lies along the phenylpyridine-defined periphery of the complex, whereas the LSOMO of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ is almost exclusively metal centered, and is thus guarded by the nonparticipating ligand framework.17 It is concluded that the differing availability of the PS*’s LSOMO to the surrounding environment explains the observed variation in quenching behavior and photocatalytic efficiency.

Bottom: reductive quenching pathway, in which PS* accepts an electron from a sacrificial reductant (Red) to produce PS−. Two analogous pathways can be envisioned for photocatalytic water oxidation.

The lowest singly occupied molecular orbital (LSOMO) is exclusively metal centered in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (95 percentile), while the analogous orbital of the Ir(III) complex exhibits mixed metal-based 5d and ppy-based π character. The highest singly occupied molecular orbitals (HSOMO) of both complexes are exclusively localized on the bpy ligand(s). 
Equipping the high-throughput LED photoreactor with pressure–voltage transducers in combination with residual gas analysis allowed the Bernhard group to achieve time-resolved quantification of the hydrogen produced. This in turn provided kinetic analysis of these reactions, in which the catalytic rate and decomposition lifetime of various catalytic systems are probed.18 Furthermore, real-time mass spectrometry and pressure analysis of a simplified catalytic system, employing an [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ photosensitizer, colloidal platinum catalyst, and TEOA sacrificial reductant, demonstrate that the decay in catalytic activity over time corresponds to bipyridine dissociation from the photosensitizer.17
Recently, it was reported by Eisenberg et al. that 2,2′:6′,6″-terpyridyl (tpy) complexes of platinum, as shown in Fig. 3, are effective photosensitizers in catalytic systems that use TEOA as a sacrificial reductant in conjunction with a methyl viologen electron relay (ER) and a colloidal platinum catalyst.19 Such complexes demonstrate a MLCT band around 430 nm with considerable extinction coefficients of approximately 4500 to 7700 M−1cm−1.20 Catalytic hydrogen evolution is believed to primarily result from oxidative quenching of PS* by methyl viologen, although reductive quenching by TEOA is also observed. By varying the diquat electron relay, it was shown that the rate of hydrogen production is correlated to the reducing power of singly reduced ER, and therefore, electron transfer from the reduced ER to the platinum catalyst is believed to be rate limiting.21

While it is important that a tunable photosensitizer be developed, the high cost of ruthenium, iridium, and platinum has led researchers to explore photosensitizers that use more available metals in order to reduce the cost of converted energy. One approach towards synthesizing a functional chromophore from abundant materials is to model the dyes found in nature. Metalloporphyrin complexes are used by plants during natural photosynthesis, and have therefore served as an architectural theme in a wide variety of artificial photosensitizers for water photolysis.22 Although the use of porphyrin ligand structures allows for strong visible light absorption when coordinated to metals such as zinc and magnesium, their synthesis and modification can be difficult and low yielding. Recent work has demonstrated that the arrangement of metalloporphyrins in the natural photosynthetic system allows for energy transfer through quantum coherence.23 While it is beyond the scope of this article, there have been considerable efforts to synthesize antennae type systems that use large arrays of photosensitizing units, as described in other recent reviews.24,25
Molecular catalysis
When a photosensitizer becomes electronically excited by a photon, the absorbed energy must be precisely controlled in order to effect only the desired transformations. In this respect, molecular catalysts have a distinct advantage over heterogeneous systems, since their electronic properties and steric bulk can often be judiciously tailored to facilitate charge transfer from the PS or to eliminate side reactions. Another advantage of a bottom-up, molecular approach is the optimal availability of active catalytic sites, in contrast to the unavailable core atoms of a bulk material. Also, since each catalytic environment is identical in homogeneous catalysis, the number of active species involved is minimized, which greatly simplifies attempts at studying the reaction mechanism. In contrast, solid or colloid supported catalysts often contain multiple types of surface sites that greatly complicate mechanistic interpretation. Finally, molecular catalysts do not generate a chemical concentration gradient during reaction, as is formed during heterogeneous catalysis. Electrolysis of water, for example, forms a pH gradient around each electrode that increases the potential at which molecular oxygen and hydrogen are formed, and in turn increases the energetic requirement to split water at a given rate. In contrast, a homogeneous system does not form such a gradient, and consequently the catalysts can operate under identical pH conditions of choice.
There are nevertheless drawbacks to implementing homogeneous water photolysis that must also be considered. Reaction homogeneity allows both catalysts to operate under identical conditions, but this can also cause complications when it comes to illumination; since the photosensitizer must be exposed to intense visible light radiation, so must the catalysts. It is undesirable for the catalysts to absorb light that would otherwise be absorbed by the photosensitizer, as this energy would be lost as heat, rather than stored as fuel. Also, catalyst excitation can be destructive for some motifs, since ligand photodissociation is a prevalent degradation pathway for strongly absorbing transition metal complexes. From this perspective, if the catalyst and PS are separate species, the catalyst should have low molar absorptivity in the visible spectrum.
Often it is difficult to identify the active state of a catalyst and the in situ formation of a secondary catalyst must be considered. This is particularly important in the homogeneous photolysis of water, as many of the discovered molecular species contain the precursors to catalytically active colloids that are known to be capable of H2 and O2 formation. For example, Pt and Pd colloids are well known hydrogen forming catalysts, and there is also evidence that many other transition metal surfaces are likewise capable of catalyzing water reduction.26 While colloid formation can often be examined by TEM, a variety of experimental methods are required to probe the formation of catalytically active colloids. Such techniques include colloid surface passivation though adsorbing compounds,27 colloid amalgam formation with mercury,28 and molecular catalyst inhibition by strongly coordinating ligands.
Water reduction catalysts (WRCs)
Synthesis of H2 requires the combination of two hydrogen atoms, but because the formation of free hydrogen radicals (H˙) is energy intensive,29 the use of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) is necessary for avoiding what would otherwise be a prohibitive energetic barrier. In order to reduce protons from water, a candidate reduction catalyst must be capable of single-electron reduction, followed by charge transfer to an accessible proton. If the hydrogen evolving catalyst is only singly reduced, catalytic H2 formation requires the interaction of two such reduced species, while if the catalyst is doubly reduced, H2 formation can be unimolecular. A vast number of water reducing catalysts have been developed, but the coupling of such catalysts to photosensitizing species has proven more difficult. The efforts toward effecting this interaction will be discussed herein, as such endeavors exemplify the next progressive step toward artificial photosynthesis, following catalyst discovery.
Group 9 metal complexes
For several decades it has been known that cobalt tris-diimine complexes are capable of reducing protons when reduced by [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in an electronically excited state.30,31 The reduction of [Co(bpy)3]2+ by the excited photosensitizer may induce bipyridine labilization, and the resulting species can react with H3O+ to form [Co(bpy)2(H2O)H]2+.29 Interaction of this hydride with a proton, or a bimolecular reaction of two hydrido complexes then results in H2 evolution. Recently, cobaloximes with the general structure shown in Fig. 4 have received renewed attention due to their previously known catalytic ability.32–36 Altering the substituents of the glyoxime ligand has been shown to modify the overpotential required for hydrogen evolution.37 The incorporation of these catalysts in light-driven H2 evolution has been accomplished when photosensitized with terpyridyl complexes of platinum as described previously (Fig. 3, R1 = Me, R2 = H), and when covalently bound to a ruthenium(II) or iridium(III) based photosensitizer as shown in Fig. 6D.38–40

Moving down the Periodic Table from [Co(bpy)3]2+, it is also known that [Rh(bpy)3]3+ can function as a H2 evolving catalyst. Mechanistic work demonstrated that an electronically excited [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer is capable of singly reducing the rhodium(III) species, which leads to dihydrogen production with minimal turnovers (<10). It was also shown that the addition of a platinum colloid dramatically improves the catalytic nature of the system (TON ≈ 100).41,42 When a platinum colloid is introduced, the rhodium complex functions more as an electron shuttle, and the actual H2 evolving catalyst is the platinum. It is believed that in the absence of platinum, bipyridine dissociation from the singly reduced [Rh(bpy)3]2+ and subsequent disproportionation affords [Rh(bpy)2]+ which may form the hydrido complex, [Rh(bpy)2(H2O)H]2+. Further reduction generates [Rh(bpy)2H]+, which is considered to be the active catalytic species that liberates hydrogen either through reaction with a proton, or in a homolytic bimolecular reaction.43 Recently, Cline and Bernhard demonstrated that [Rh(bpy)3]3+ complexes are capable of reducing protons photocatalytically when coupled with [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ photosensitizers affording greater than 5000 turnovers without the use of a colloidal catalyst.18 The excited photosensitizer is reductively quenched by TEA, and the resulting species is capable of triply reducing the rhodium catalyst to form a Rh(II) hydride. The triply reduced rhodium hydride may then produce H2 through: A) a homolytic bimolecular reaction between two rhodium hydrides, B) the subsequent formation of a dihydride that forms H2 by reductive elimination, or C) a heterolytic bimolecular pathway. In addition, time resolved analysis of the photocatalytic systems clearly reveals an induction period when [Rh(bpy)3]3+ is used as a catalyst, which is ascribed to the formation of the active [Rh(bpy)2]+ species. Generation of a rhodium colloid was firmly ruled out through a series of careful control and poisoning experiments.
Biomimetic structures
Some research groups have turned their attention to naturally occurring iron-based hydrogenase enzymes, which exhibit catalytic activities similar to Pt and Pd for the oxidation of H2.44 The active site of such enzymes has served as a blueprint for the development of molecular hydrogen evolving catalysts, shown through comparison in Fig. 5.45,46
 Fig. 5  A: Active site in Fe-hydrogenase, (X = H2O, H). B: Synthetic mimic of A as prepared by Rauchfuss et al.46 
Sun and coworkers recently employed [Fe2S2] based catalysts in light driven systems using a ruthenium(II) tris-diimine photosensitizer, and have yielded minimal turnovers (<5) with respect to the proton reducing catalyst in solutions of ascorbic acid.47 It is believed that the excited ruthenium photosensitizer is reductively quenched by the ascorbate anion and then proceeds to singly reduce the [Fe2S2] catalyst. The reduced ruthenium complex is not thermodynamically capable of reducing the catalyst a second time, therefore it is believed that the singly reduced catalyst is either: A) doubly protonated to form a [(η2-H2)Fe2+Fe1+] species that evolves H2 by reductive elimination, or B) singly protonated and then reduced a second time to form a hydride that can react with a proton to form H2. Current works demonstrate low catalytic turnover capacity, but such systems may be useful in solar energy conversion as they present an interesting structural development into water reducing catalysts that use plentiful materials.
Orchestrating electron transfer
Since the photolysis of water requires the transfer of redox equivalents, and typically light absorption is separated from the actual catalysis process, there has been a considerable amount of recent work invested in linking a photosensitizing unit to a water reduction catalyst. Such bridged systems allow for increased electron transfer rates, while the adjustment of orbital energies and overlap allows for a long-lived charge-separated state. Many systems use the same catalyst and photosensitizer archetypes that have been previously discussed, and several of the resulting products are depicted in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Bridged structures for the light driven evolution of hydrogen.39,40,48–50 Light is absorbed by a MLCT from the ruthenium or iridium to the bridging ligand and is then passed to the water reducing catalysts. 
Connecting the photosensitizer to a water reducing catalyst might prove to be advantageous, but knowing for certain the nature of the active catalyst can be difficult. Since several recent examples of bridged systems use Pt2+ or Pd2+ based catalysts for proton reduction, the formation of a metallic colloid by reduction of the catalytic site is plausible. Recently, the photoinduced decomposition of a catalyst similar to structures A and B in Fig. 6 was shown by ESI-MS, while the formation of a Pd colloid was observed by TEM and XPS during hydrogen production.51 While the catalytic activity of the molecular species cannot be ruled out, the formation of a potentially more efficient colloidal catalyst must be considered. In addition, the active state of such bridged catalysts could actually be a dissociated form of the precatalyst, thus functioning as a bimolecular system. Therefore, such systems must be studied in detail with carefully selected comparisons to determine the nature of the catalytic species. However, the possibility of bridged catalysts dissociating upon reduction can be used as an advantage in maximizing cage escape and minimizing back electron transfer. Photoinduced electron transfer was observed for the complex shown in Fig. 7, which may lead to the dissociation of the Zn–pyridine bond. Resulting hydrogen production was demonstrated by this complex from trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride.52 Although this system has not been demonstrated to be catalytic with respect to the [Fe2S2] based catalyst or to reduce protons from water, the conceptual framework could be useful in the development of future systems.

Water oxidation catalysts (WOCs)
Oxidation of water remains a substantial catalysis challenge, requiring multiple uphill proton-coupled electron transfers. The catalytic activity of metal oxides for water oxidation has been investigated for several decades, with specific emphasis on manganese, iron, cobalt, ruthenium, and iridium oxides in the form of electrodes and colloids.53–58 Molecular analogues designed to avoid the pitfalls of heterogeneous catalysis have mainly arrived in the form of complexes containing these same transition metals, and are generally divisible into two categories: A) biomimetic structures that replicate the tetramanganese core of photosystem II, and B) complexes that employ rarer metals to realize simpler or more versatile architectures than are possible in nature.59
Poisoning and side reactions
Coordination of water molecules to a metal center is a crucial step of homogeneous water oxidation with contemporary catalyst designs. As a consequence, the presence of stronger ligating species is detrimental. Acetonitrile and other coordinating cosolvents were shown to be disruptive to water oxidation during bulk electrolysis at an iridium oxide electrode and during homogeneous water oxidation from an iridium-based complex.60,61 Meanwhile, other cosolvents are known to oxidize at lower potentials than water, such as dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide, and must likewise be avoided. The least detrimental cosolvents were found to be 1,2-propanediol carbonate and tert-butyl alcohol.
Irreversible catalyst oxidation is also a valid concern in most reported systems. Aside from the class of catalysts known as polyoxometalates, molecular WOCs can be universally described as small clusters of metal ions, whose geometry and electronics are governed by organic scaffolds. EPR studies have evidenced the formation of radical organic species during water oxidation catalyzed by ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, underlining the highly reactive conditions in which these catalysts operate.62–64
Catalyst design
The principal frustration for homogeneous water oxidation research is the sheer mechanistic complexity of the reaction. In contrast to the double ET process involved in homogeneous water reduction, the act of oxidizing water requires a catalyst capable of mediating four highly energetic ETs from associated water molecules to an external electron sink. With two exceptions,65,66 the active catalytic species for water oxidation, when adequately characterized, have always contained at least two metal centers, and often four or more.67 This multi-metal structural archetype is mirrored in nature's own tetrameric manganese design, perhaps indicative that simpler, mono-metallic catalysts are infeasible due to electronic or geometric constraints. Recognizing this consideration, researchers have responded by designing novel catalysts whose structures integrate two or more metal centers in various defined geometries.
The first of these complexes to materialize was the µ-oxo-bridged, bis-diimine ruthenium dimer, whose structure is shown in Fig. 8. Originally studied in the early 1980s by Meyer et al.,68 this molecule has long been the golden standard for water oxidation kinetics with a maximum turnover frequency approaching 250 h−1, and was demonstrated to be a promising catalyst in light-driven water oxidation.7 Accordingly, the catalytic mechanism has been heavily investigated.69,70 More recently, substantial EPR-based studies have indicated the presence of organic radicals forming during this molecule's catalytic cycle. This observation has opened new avenues of thought concerning the role of the catalyst's organic scaffold in this and similar systems, especially with regard to hydroxylated radical intermediates. Two mechanisms have been proposed for water oxidation in this system, one involving a more conventional peroxide bond formation between the ligated hydroxyls,71 and the other involving endoperoxide formation on the bipyridine periphery.62–64,72
 Fig. 8  Ruthenium dimer for catalytic water oxidation first described by Meyer et al. in 1982.68 
In 2008, the Meyer group reported oxygen evolution from a monoruthenium analogue of their aforementioned dimeric catalyst (Fig. 9). When this species was combined with aqueous ceric ion, the resulting reaction's first-order dependence on ruthenium concentration, lack of induction period, and straightforward kinetic decay profile all suggest that the active species in solution contains only a single metal center.65 While this is not the first instance of water oxidation from a single metal complex,66 this communication directly attacks the multiple metal paradigm of earlier generation catalysts, and may signify a growing trend toward a simpler, single metal structural motif.

In 1999, Yagi and Kaneko reported activity similar to the Meyer dimer from the amino-substituted ruthenium dimer depicted in Fig. 10.73 Catalyst degradation in this system was accompanied by dinitrogen evolution, suggesting that ligated ammonia is slowly oxidized during the oxygen evolution experiments.

Another interesting architecture for catalytic water oxidation is commonly referred to as the “pacman” structure, shown in Fig. 11. These ligands have been coordinated to many metals, including manganese, iron, ruthenium, palladium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, primarily as targets for oxygen reduction catalysts, and more recently for the reverse reaction of oxygen evolution.74–78 The design of these catalysts uses a variety of linker moieties to hold two metal centers within a few angstroms of each other. The most commonly used linkers have been anthracene and biphenylene, although more recently dibenzofuran and xanthene have also been employed in a successful effort by Nocera's group to tune the intermetallic distance in these complexes.79 However, it was ultimately determined that the porphyrin-based molecules prefer to form a µ-oxo bridge between the two metal centers, rather than the desired peroxide bond, irrespective of the intermetallic distance.80 On the other hand, water oxidation catalysis from a tpy-bound ruthenium based species at a modified electrode, as well as from the molecular species in nonaqueous solution, has been demonstrated by Tanaka and coworkers.78
 Fig. 11  The pacman ligand motif, explored for water oxidation, is designed to bring two metal-bound waters into close proximity. These interesting molecules were met with only modest success, primarily due to complications involving the formation of an intermetallic µ-oxo bridge.80 
Electronic tuning
The ability to control the absolute MO energies of catalysts for water photolysis, without loss of functionality, may be a key advantage in completing the photosynthetic cycle. To our knowledge, only two reports have highlighted redox-tunable catalysts for which structure–property relationships are investigated. The first was the diruthenium complex described in 2005 by Zong and Thummel (Fig. 12A).66 Notably, the architecture of this complex confines the metal centers within a more rigid spatial arrangement than the ruthenium dimer studied by Meyer and coworkers. Oxidation potentials over a range of roughly 600 mV were obtained through structural alteration of the axial pyridine ligands, giving consequential differences in oxygen evolution kinetics.81 The work of the Bernhard group has focused on similar redox tuning of a cyclometalated iridium design, whose parent structure is shown in Fig. 12B.61 By substituting the periphery of the 2-phenylpyridine ligands, the catalysts' highest occupied molecular orbital energies can be tuned within a similar half-volt window. The resulting species are reported to sustain catalytic activity much longer than previous systems.

Photosystem II mimics
In 2000, the Dismukes group described a cubic, tetramanganese complex for use as a water oxidation catalyst, shown in Fig. 13. Designed to replicate the natural architecture of the active site in photosystem II, which also contains a tetrameric manganese oxide core, this catalyst was ultimately unsuccessful in solution due to kinetic limitations. Dismukes et al. ascribe this lack of activity to the reluctance of the phosphinate ligands to dissociate during the reaction, preventing a conformational change which would then lead to liberation of dioxygen.82 More recently, a similar manganese-based approach was studied by Brudvig and Crabtree. While their tpy-bound bis(µ-oxo)-bridged dimanganese complex is suggestive of Meyer's dimeric ruthenium structure, it was not met with the same level of success as its second row transition metal predecessor.83

Recently, a new architectural theme was reported, this time composed entirely of metal oxide bonds, and devoid of organic content. This polyoxometalate, whose structure is shown in Fig. 14, consists of an adamantane-shaped, tetraruthenium oxide active site, sandwiched between two stabilizing decatungstosilicate clusters. Under low pH conditions, this species was observed by Bonchio's group to catalyze oxygen evolution at a rate 50% faster than anything previously reported (Table 1) for similar systems, and was also observed to be stable under the employed reaction conditions.84 It was demonstrated by Hill and coworkers that this catalyst is likewise active when oxidized by [Ru(bpy)3]3+ (the singly oxidized state of the well known photosensitizer [Ru(bpy)3]2+).85 Together, these contributions highlight this polyoxometalate as a very promising candidate for water oxidation catalysis, and validate its use in future, light-driven photosynthetic systems.

Conclusion
Worldwide renascent interest in solar conversion research is primarily driven by the projection that the demand for energy will continue to increase, and sustainability concerns regarding the continued combustion of fossil fuels. Sunlight driven photolysis of water to make a portable fuel is a complicated challenge that requires the conversion of photonic energy into electrochemical potential, followed by the careful orchestration of multiple charge transfer steps. In the face of such complexity, creative solutions have been devised to solve the separate elementary needs of the overall reaction utilizing contemporary chemical, physical, and biological understanding. A significant research effort has demonstrated the need for chromophores with strong visible light absorption that could ideally be tuned in terms of absorbance wavelength and excited/ground state redox potentials. Homogeneous catalysis of water reduction and oxidation has demonstrated the advantage of storing multiple redox equivalents in a single catalyst. However, there is still a great deal of research necessary to understand the mechanism behind H–H and OO bond formation. While a functional and competitive solar energy conversion and storage strategy has yet to be developed, the field is nevertheless steadily progressing.
