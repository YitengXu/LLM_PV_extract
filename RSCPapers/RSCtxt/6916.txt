    , Accepted 20th September 2018First published on 24th September 2018AbstractStable and cost-effective catalysts with low kinetic overpotentials for both the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are indispensable for the large-scale implementation of electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we developed an efficient, stable and bifunctional Ni–Co–S/Ni–Co–P bistratal electrocatalyst on Ni foam (NF) using simple electrodeposition methods. The efficient contact at the Ni–Co–P/NF interface along with the porous Ni–Co–S surface results in the superior electrocatalytic activity of the bistratal layer in a basic solution for both the OER and HER. Only −0.11 V vs. RHE is required at a current density of −20 mA cm−2 for the HER and 1.47 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm−2 for the OER, significantly outperforming bare Ni–Co–S or Ni–Co–P on NF. Most crucially, when functioning as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, a small cell potential of 1.49 V can drive 10 mA cm−2 which can be sustained for more than two days. Subsequently, 10.8%-efficient overall solar water splitting was achieved when driven by three ordinary Si solar cells. Such a bistratal structure is expected to provide a new platform for the design of highly efficient, low-cost and durable catalysts for water electrolysis systems.
Electrochemical/photoelectrochemical water splitting offers an ideal approach for hydrogen and oxygen production via the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).1 The key point is to develop electrocatalysts with minimal kinetic overpotentials for both the HER and OER. Although Pt-group metals and Ru/Ir-based compounds are currently considered as the best HER and OER electrocatalysts, respectively, their high cost and scarcity severely limit their application in water splitting systems on a large scale. Therefore, researchers are inspired to design and synthesize low-cost non-noble metal electrocatalysts.2,3
There are some basic rules to design a low-cost electrocatalyst. (1) It should be both stable and efficient for the HER and OER in a basic solution. Such bifunctionality can prominently simplify the system and reduce costs.4 To date, the commonly reported bifunctional catalysts are mostly phosphides, sulfides and selenides of Fe, Co and Ni in various forms.5–8 (2) At the substrate/catalyst interface, fast carrier transfer is required and the catalyst should attach to the substrate firmly to ensure a high level of stability. And (3) on the catalyst surface, a porous nano-structure is preferred to ensure the presence of active sites for accelerating the reactions. Previous research studies have indicated that adequate structural design provides the possibility of combining two different kinds of catalysts for the preparation of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.9 A MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructure on nickel foam (NF) has been reported to be an alkaline bifunctional electrocatalyst which delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.56 V during full water splitting but with a poor stability of less than 10 hours.10 Eutectic NiSe/Ni3Se2 on NF can drive a 10 mA cm−2 current density at ∼1.6 V in 1 M KOH.11 Interwoven NiS/NiS2 is also an efficient bifunctional catalyst, yielding a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 1.62 V.6 In this study, we have developed Ni–Co–S/Ni–Co–P bistratal nano-structures on NF to tune the substrate/catalyst interface and catalyst surface, and have demonstrated a highly active, durable and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.
Recently, Ni–Co–P (NCP), being enriched with the synergistic effect of the most admirable transition metals Ni and Co, has shown richer faradaic redox reactions and higher electrical conductivity and stability than their mono-metallic counterparts.12,13 However, it forms a condensed layer when fabricated using a simple electrodeposition method.14 On the other hand, porous Ni–Co–S (NCS) can easily be obtained by the electrodeposition method, showing good catalytic activity for the HER in an alkaline solution.15,16 Although extensive studies showed that NCP and NCS had good HER and/or OER activity, in this study we plan to further improve their electrochemical activity by combining their respective advantages, i.e., the condensed NCP layer may form good contact with the substrate and the porous NCS may increase the number of active sites and thus be beneficial to the catalytic activity. In addition, the coupling of the interface between NCS and NCP may also improve its catalytic properties. Notably, such a construction of an electrode system for water splitting has seldom been reported. We deposited a NCS/NCP bistratal layer on NF using cost-effective electrodeposition methods. As expected a dense NCP layer is first obtained, which forms good contact with the substrate. Subsequently NCS is deposited on NCP, and exhibits a porous surface structure. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the efficient contact at the NCP/NF interface and the porous NCS surface, the resulting NCS/NCP catalyst can be directly employed to accelerate the electrolysis of water with its remarkable electrochemical activity, when compared with the single NCP or NCS layer. By employing NCS/NCP electrocatalysts as a bifunctional catalyst, i.e., as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, we have demonstrated that a cell potential as small as 1.49 V is sufficient to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with excellent stability for more than two days of continuous water splitting. Significantly, a 10.8% efficiency of overall solar water splitting is achieved when driven by three ordinary Si solar cells.
NCP, NCS and NCS/NCP were integrated on NF by an electrodeposition method (see ESI† experimental section for further details). The surface morphologies of NCP, NCS and NCS/NCP are presented in Fig. 1. NCP and NCS exhibit quite a different surface microstructure when electrodeposited on NF. NCP shows a surface with densely packed spheres (Fig. 1a). On the other hand, NCS shows a porous surface morphology, resembling a honeycomb (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c presents the honeycomb-like nanostructure grown on the NCP particles when NCS is electrodeposited on NCP, indicating that the surface morphology of the NCS/NCP bistratal structure is inherited and topotactically converted from those of NCP and NCS. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization of the NCS/NCP sample is given in Fig. 1d and S1† (the enlarged one), showing different orientations of lattice planes. The lattice spaces of 0.207 nm and 0.203 nm are in accordance with the distance from the (111) and (002) lattice planes of NCP, respectively.14 The other spaces are about 0.198 nm and 0.258 nm, correlating well with the nominal data of the NCS (102) and (103) crystal faces.17 This can also be verified from the inset selected area electron diffraction pattern in Fig. S1,† revealing diffraction rings containing fewer bright spots, which suggests poor crystallinity. This also explains why the lattice fringes are hard to observe in Fig. 1d. The crystal structures of the as-synthesized samples were also checked using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Similar to previous studies,14,15 there are no XRD peaks observed for the as-electrodeposited NCS or NCP, again indicating their poor crystallinity (Fig. S2†). High-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping were further employed to investigate the elemental distribution on the NCS/NCP sample (Fig. 1e). It can be seen from Fig. 1f–i that Co, Ni, P and S are uniformly distributed on the surface.

XPS technique is employed to determine the surface composition and chemical states of NCS/NCP on NF. The XPS survey can be found in Fig. S3,† and indicates the existence of Ni, Fe, P, S and O in the NCS/NCP sample. The Co 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 2a displays two peaks: one at 778.3 eV and the other at 793.4 eV, corresponding to the Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 states, respectively.18 The peaks in Fig. 2b at 872.2 eV and 854.7 eV correspond to Ni 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively.19 The P 2p spectrum (Fig. 2c) exhibits its primary peak at 130.0 eV, indicating the phosphide signal.17,20 However, this peak is very weak since NCP is covered by NCS. In the case of the S 2p region, the broad peak centered at 161 eV as shown in Fig. 2d is due to S in the metal sulfide, whereas the weak peak in the higher energy side corresponds to the sulfur ion with an oxide state.21 In Fig. S4 and S5,† we also check the status of Co, Ni, S and P when NCS and NCP are deposited on NF, respectively. The XPS peak positions for Co, S and P are almost the same with those of NCS/NCP; however, for Ni in NCP, there are additional peaks at 852.3 and 869.5 eV, which can be ascribed to metallic Ni.22 Note that such peaks are not found in NCS/NCP, indicating that the metallic Ni may be oxidized to Ni2+ during the deposition of NCS, or the bottom NCP layer may be covered by the top NCS. The surface molar ratios of the samples are measured by EDX (shown in Fig. S6†). They are: Ni:Co:P = 0.23:0.68:0.09 for NCP, Ni:Co:S = 0.45:0.23:0.30 for NCS and Ni:Co:P:S = 0.30:0.47:0.06:0.16, respectively. Although the element Ni may be influenced by the NF substrate, the ratio for S or P in all the samples is much smaller than that of (Ni + Co). Therefore we propose that there are oxides of Ni and/or Co in the catalyst. Then we present the O 1s XPS peaks in Fig. S7,† which can be denoted as O1 and O2.23 The peak O1 at 531.4 eV is usually associated with oxygen in OH− groups,24 illustrating the presence of Ni and/or Co oxides. The peaks at 532.3 eV is attributed to adsorbed water or possibly adsorbed O2.25 As a result, the current NCS/NCP catalyst is a mixture of Ni–Co-sulfide, phosphide and oxide with poor crystallinity.

With the successful electrodeposition of NCS/NCP films on NF, its performance in water splitting is studied. We first analyze the HER catalytic activities of NCS, NCP and NCS/NCP using a three-electrode system in an alkaline solution (1 M NaOH). We include the J–V curve of a bare Pt electrode as the standard catalytic material (Fig. S8†). The cathodic current is observed at 0 V vs. RHE, confirming that the actual potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode does not deviate from 0.197 V. Fig. 3a clearly shows the poor catalytic activity with pure NF below −0.3 V vs. RHE. However, both NCS and NCP show HER catalytic effect. NCP has better HER catalytic activity than NCS between 0 and −40 mA cm−2. At −20 mA cm−2, the overpotential for NCP is only −0.14 V vs. RHE, while that for NCS is −0.38 V vs. RHE. However, the Tafel slope of NCP (110.4 mV dec−1) is much higher than that (70.6 mV dec−1) of NCS, as shown in Fig. 3b. Surprisingly, the bistratal NCS/NCP presents improved HER activity when compared to both NCP and NCS, i.e., the lowest overpotential of −0.11 V vs. RHE at −20 mA cm−2 and also the lowest Tafel slope of 62 mV dec−1. A smaller overpotential means less energy is needed to drive the HER. The Tafel slope signifies how much potential is required to achieve a tenfold current density, the smaller the better.26 The overpotential and Tafel slope are both related to the catalytic ability, the electrochemically active surface area of the catalyst or the catalyst mass.27 Obviously, the HER merits of both NCP and NCS are inherited by the bistratal NCS/NCP structure. Note that the catalytic performances in Fig. 3 for NCS, NCP and NCS/NCP are optimized by changing the electrodeposition time or cycles (Fig. S9†).

The OER plays another central role during overall water splitting. As shown in Fig. 3c, we characterize the OER activity of the different catalysts under the same solution conditions (1 M NaOH, pH = 13.6). Prior to the water oxidation, the oxidation peaks at around 1.4 V vs. RHE on the pure NF electrodes can be attributed to the transformation of Ni/Ni2+ → Ni2+/Ni3+.28 This peak moves to ∼1.33 V vs. RHE when NCP is deposited on NF, originating from the transformation of Ni2+ → Ni3+, which is also found in NiSe/NF.29 In Fig. 3c, the iR corrected OER polarization curves reveal the excellent OER activity of NCS/NCP, requiring 1.47 V vs. RHE at an OER current density of 50 mA cm−2, which is much superior to those of NCP (1.63 V vs. RHE) and NCS (1.52 V vs. RHE). In addition, the Tafel slope shown in Fig. 3d for NCS/NCP is calculated to be 83.4 mV dec−1, obviously lower than those of NCP (144.0 mV dec−1) and NCS (124.3 mV dec−1), further confirming the excellent OER performance of the bistratal NCS/NCP in an alkaline solution. It is very important that both the HER and OER catalytic activities for NCS/NCP are improved relative to the respective NCS and NCP catalytic activities, since such superiority ensures the high-efficiency of full solar water splitting, as will be demonstrated below. Note that the polarization curves without iR correction are also shown in Fig. 3a and c, to exclude the possibility that the performance enhancement comes from a different iR drop.
To probe the reason for the high performance of NCS/NCP catalysts, we first record the EIS Nyquist plots to elucidate the charge transfer resistances in different electrodes.30 The EIS data can be fitted to the different equivalent circuits for different samples (Fig. S10†).31 For NCS or NCP catalysts on NF, we use two series-connected RC circuits to represent the interface-junctions of the catalyst/NF and catalyst/electrolyte. For NCS/NCP on NF, we add a RC circuit to represent the interface-junction between NCS and NCP. The charge transfer resistances R1 (Table S1†) for NCP and NCS/NCP are very close (0.29 and 0.30 Ω), indicating that R1 is from the catalyst/NF interface. This corresponds to the semicircles of the high frequency region on the left, which can be seen in the enlarged inset picture of Fig. 4a. We note that the charge transfer resistance between NCS and NF is larger than those of NCP and NCS/NCP, demonstrating that NCP has a better contact with NF than NCS. The large semicircles of the low frequency region on the right change obviously after the loading of the different catalyst, indicating that they are related to the catalyst/electrolyte junction. In this case, the charge transfer resistance (7.19 Ω) between NCS and the electrolyte is less than that (8.78 Ω) of NCP/electrolyte, illustrating that the surface of NCS is favorable for the catalytic reaction. What's more, the charge transfer resistance between NCS and the electrolyte decreases significantly to 2.16 Ω when NCS is deposited on NCP, while that between NCS and NCP is as low as 0.23 Ω. Obviously, the NCS/NCP bistratal nanostructure results in the decrease of the total charge transfer resistance between the electrode and electrolyte, due to the effective charge transfer on the NCP/NF, NCS/NCP and electrolyte/NCS interfaces. Therefore, on comparing with single NCS and NCP, NCS/NCP has improved charge transport from NF to the electrolyte, thereby leading to the best catalytic activity as shown in Fig. 3.

As shown in Fig. 1b and c, NCS exhibits more porosity on NCP than on NF. This is suggested to be the main reason for the low charge transfer resistance and faster reaction rate between NCS and the electrolyte, since high porosity means a high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). To ascertain the ECSAs of the catalysts, they are evaluated using the double-layer capacitances (Cdl) in the CV potential range where no apparent faradaic process occurs. The ECSA is proportional to Cdl based on ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs is the specific capacitance and is considered to be a constant, which is reported to be between 0.022 and 0.130 mF cm−2 in an alkaline solution. In this study, we assumed the value of Cs to be 0.040 mF cm−2 based on previously reported Ni-based OER catalysts.32Cdl can be calculated according to the following equation: idl = Cdl × v.33 The capacitive current idl is plotted as a function of the scan rate v to obtain the Cdl values, as shown in Fig. 4b, where the capacitive currents of the different electrocatalysts at different scan rates are all collected at 1.07 V vs. RHE (Fig. S11†). It can be observed that NCS/NCP has the largest Cdl of 5.46 mF compared to the other samples (1.39 mF for NCP and 3.48 mF for NCS) with a 1 cm2 surface area in contact with the electrolyte. The corresponding ECSAs are then calculated to be 136.50, 34.75 and 87.00 cm2, respectively (Table S2†). The NCS/NCP structure has the largest ECSA, revealing that it can provide more catalytically active sites. This is a remarkable contribution to its excellent electrocatalytic performance. In addition, the thickness and surface area would largely have an effect on the electrode impedance. Thus we change the electrodeposition time for NCP and the deposition cycles for NCS to modify the layer parameters, and then measure the surface area and impedance (Table S2, Fig. S12†). We found that the current NCS (deposited in 10 cycles), NCP (deposited in 60 min) and NCS (deposited in 10 cycles)/NCP (deposited in 60 min) show the largest ECSAs and the smallest diameters in cole–cole plots, respectively, illustrating that the improved charge transport of NCS/NCP/NF shown in Fig. 4a is truly due to the bistratal structure which is related to the improved ECSA.
The current density normalized to the ECSA is a better comparison for the intrinsic catalytic activity of the catalyst. Both the HER and OER polarization curves for the NCS, NCP and NCS/NCP catalysts normalized by their ECSAs are drawn in Fig. S13.† In this case, NCP has the best HER activity, while that of NCS/NCP is between that of NCS and NCP. To further study this, the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used to perform the first-principles calculations. The calculated free-energy diagram of the HER at equilibrium potential on the surface of various catalysts is shown in Fig. S14,† which shows that NCP has the best HER activity, and that of P doped NCS is better than that of NCS. Therefore, the enhanced HER activity for NCS/NCP shown in Fig. 3a mainly originates from its high ECSA. Different from the case of HER, NCS/NCP still exhibits the best OER activity after ECSA normalization (Fig. S13b†). Based on the above discussion, we can conclude that the high ECSA of NCS/NCP, the efficient NCP/NF and NCS/NCP interfaces for charge transfer, and the improved catalytic activity obtained in P doped NCS exert their synergetic contribution to the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of NCS/NCP/NF.
Inspired by the outstanding HER and OER performance of NCS/NCP/NF, we assemble an overall water splitting device using NCS/NCP/NF as both the anode and cathode in 1 M NaOH. The I–V curve in Fig. 5a shows that it only requires a cell voltage of 1.49 V (without iR correction) to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with excellent stability for about two days (Fig. 5b). Note that we also measured the polarization curves at different scan rates. Fig. S15† presents the coinciding curves in the case of 2, 5 and 20 mV s−1, excluding the contribution of non-faradaic processes to the corresponding polarization curves. In Fig. S16,† the surface morphology of the NCS/NCP sample after long-term electrolysis is given, which shows no significant changes when compared with that of the sample before electrolysis (Fig. 1c). The electronic structure of the sample is also tested (Fig. S17†). The Ni 2p and Co 2p peaks show no observable changes; however, the S and P peaks shrink obviously while the O 1s peak is enhanced. It is quite interesting that the stability is maintained while the concentrations of S, P and O change during the long-time measurement. This may be due to the fact that porous Ni and/or Co oxides have similar catalytic activity to NCS/NCP. It will also be our further work to clarify this point.
 Fig. 5  (a) Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for the overall electrocatalytic water splitting using NCS/NCP/NF for both the anode and cathode (red curve), and the three series-connected ordinary single-crystal Si solar cells (blue curve). The estimated STH conversion efficiency is marked on the crossing point. (b) The chronopotentiometric measurement of the overall water splitting at 10 mA cm−2. (c) Unassisted water splitting using NCS/NCP/NF as the electrodes and Si photovoltaic cells as the light absorber. (d) Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of water electrolysis under one-sun illumination. The true STH conversion efficiency is marked. 
Three series-connected solar cells with a total size of ∼3 cm2 are used to match the electrocatalytic cell for unassisted water splitting. The I–V curve for the individual solar cell is presented in Fig. S18,† along with the fabrication processes of the solar cells. The open-circuit voltage of the individual Si solar cell is about 0.57 V under one-sun illumination and its efficiency is about 14.4%. The I–V curve for three series-connected solar cells is presented in Fig. 5a, which produce 1.67 V of Voc under the same illumination condition. The theoretical solar-to-H2 (STH) conversion efficiency ηSTH (11.1%) can be estimated by the current at which the two I–V curves cross, using ηSTH = 1.23 V × jop/Psun, where jop is the current density and Psun is the power of the illumination per unit area.34 We then design a combined system (Fig. 5c) for unassisted solar-driven water splitting. In this system, the coupling of the NCS/NCP/NF electrolyzers with the Si photovoltaic cells determines the overall water splitting performance. The actual current density with varying potentials is presented in Fig. 5d. We get a current density of 8.8 mA cm−2 under the unassisted condition, and the practical ηSTH can be obtained as 10.8%, which is quite close to the prediction shown in Fig. 5a. The I–V curve obtained after 2 days of continuous solar water splitting at 0 V almost overlaps with the one obtained before the stability measurement, again indicating the good stability of the electrocatalyst. We also performed H2 quantification measurements to confirm the occurrence of water splitting (Fig. S19†). The H2 amounts obtained from the theoretical calculation and actual measurement are determined to be very close, with a faradaic efficiency of ∼96.8%. Finally, we compare our catalyst with some state-of-the-art bifunctional Ni-based catalysts in Table S3.† It can be noted that the catalytic activity of the current NCS/NCP on NF is among the best ones.
In summary, the NCS/NCP bistratal structure is fabricated on NF using simple electrodeposition methods. On comparing with those of NCS and NCP on NF, a considerably superior electrocatalytic activity is achieved for both the OER and HER. Only −0.11 V vs. RHE is required at −20 mA cm−2 during the HER and 1.47 V vs. RHE at 50 mA cm−2 during the OER. The Tafel slopes are as small as 62 mV dec−1 for the HER and 83.4 mV dec−1 for the OER. Such superiority is ascribed to the fast charge transport from the NF to the electrolyte due to the efficient contact between NCP/NF and the porous NCS surface. As a result, only 1.49 V is required to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 when NCS/NCP/NF is used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting in an electrocatalytic cell. Finally, overall solar water splitting with a high STH efficiency of 10.8% is achieved when the electrocatalytic cell is driven by three external Si solar cells.
