    , Accepted 10th February 2022First published on 10th February 2022AbstractThe ternary strategy has been identified as a feasible and effective way to obtain high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the voltage loss (Vloss) lies between those of the two binary devices, which inevitably limits the further efficiency improvements. Herein, a non-fullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl, possessing complementary absorption spectra and forming a cascade LUMO energy level alignment with the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, was introduced as a third component to fabricate ternary OSCs. Compared to the binary blends, the ternary system exhibits reduced density of trap states, improved molecular ordering, and suppressed non-radiative recombination, and thereby yields an obviously lower Vloss than either of the binary OSCs. As a result, high efficiencies of 18.69% (certified as 18.2%) and 16.07% are obtained for the rigid and flexible OSCs, respectively. This work highlights the importance of suppressing non-radiative recombination in OSCs by using a ternary strategy and expands an effective avenue for the realization of efficient wearable electronics as novel photovoltaic power sources.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention as a new generation of photovoltaic technology due to their advantages of low cost, solution processability and mechanical flexibility. However, the open-circuit voltage, as an important parameter that determines the performance of OSCs, is still significantly lower than that of the inorganic or perovskite solar cells due to the large voltage loss (Vloss). The ternary strategy is one of the widely used approaches to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. However, for most ternary OSCs, the Vloss values are between those of the binary devices. To address this issue, we herein introduce a non-fullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl to regulate the microstructure and molecular packing of the donor/acceptor blend. The corresponding ternary OSC exhibits reduced density of trap states and suppressed non-geminate recombination, thus obtaining an obviously lower Vloss than either of the binary OSCs. As a result, high PCEs of 18.69% and 16.07% are achieved for the rigid and flexible PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl OSCs, respectively. The flexible devices can maintain more than 95% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles. This work highlights the importance of suppressing non-radiative recombination in realizing high-performance OSCs.

Introduction
In the past few decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention as a new generation of photovoltaic technology due to their advantages of solution processability and mechanical flexibility, which enables the low-cost and large-area manufacturing of wearable electronic devices.1–9 By virtue of novel molecular design, appropriate morphology optimization and interfacial engineering, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the best-performing OSCs have exceeded over 18%.10–15
The ternary blend strategy is one of the widely used approaches to improve the PCEs of OSCs.16–20 Utilizing the ternary strategy to enhance light harvesting of the blend films can effectively increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc). But there is not much room for Jsc improvement since the non-fullerene acceptors mostly possess excellent light-harvesting capability. On the other hand, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ternary OSCs is typically limited to ∼0.9 V, significantly lower than that of inorganic or perovskite solar cells. The relatively low Voc achieved in OSCs is mainly due to the high voltage loss (Vloss). Therefore, suppressing Vloss is the key in further improving the performance of OSCs.21–26 In general, the Vloss for a solar cell originates from the radiative and non-radiative recombination of charge carriers.27 Non-radiative recombination is the main recombination mechanism for OSCs, and the trap states usually act as non-radiative recombination centers.28,29 Trap states and the associated density of trap states can exert a significant impact on the charge transport, carrier diffusion and photovoltaic performance, particularly the Voc.30,31 Moreover, there is more conspicuous Vloss related to defect states in flexible electronic devices, posing a daunting challenge for the PCE improvement of flexible OSCs.32–34 In this perspective, effectively decreasing the density of trap states to suppress the non-radiative recombination is of vital importance for realizing both high-efficiency rigid and flexible OSCs.
In this contribution, efficient ternary OSCs were fabricated by incorporating a non-fullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl into the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend. Compared to the binary counterparts, the ternary blend exhibits a cascade LUMO energy level alignment and complementary absorption. Moreover, the ternary blend shows reduced density of trap states and optimized active layer morphology, which promotes charge extraction and transport. The reduced density of trap states also gives rise to suppressed voltage loss, allowing a high Voc to be achieved in the ternary OSC. As a result, the optimized ternary device shows a PCE of 18.69%, much higher than that of the host binary device (17.72%). It is worth noting that the Vloss of the ternary OSC is lower than either of the binary OSCs, unlike most ternary OSCs reported in the literature, of which the Vloss values lie between those of the binary devices. Finally, flexible OSCs based on the ternary blend were fabricated. A high PCE of 16.07% with excellent flexural endurance is realized for the flexible devices.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of PM6, BTP-eC9, and ZY-4Cl, and the corresponding absorption spectra of the neat and blend films are presented in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. From Fig. 1b, it can be seen that ZY-4Cl exhibits well complementary absorption with PM6 and BTP-eC9. The incorporation of ZY-4Cl enhances the spectral response of the blend film for the entire visible wavelength range, which is beneficial for light harvesting in the solar cell. The frontier energy levels of the active materials are presented in Fig. 1d. ZY-4Cl expresses an up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, −3.67 eV) in relation to BTP-eC9 (−3.98 eV), lying between those of PM6 (−3.48 eV) and BTP-eC9. The cascade LUMO energy level alignment formed in such a ternary blend is conducive to producing high Voc, and facilitating charge transfer and extraction in the corresponding device.35,36

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, solution-processed OSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag were fabricated. The weight ratio of the donor and acceptor was kept at 1:1.3, and the active materials were dissolved in chloroform solution with 0.3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. Fig. 2a and Fig. S1 (ESI†) present the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized solar cells, and the corresponding photovoltage performance parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†). From the J–V curves, it can be found that the Voc of the ternary OSCs gradually increases with increasing the ZY-4Cl content. The highest PCE of 18.69% (certified as 18.2%, Fig. S2, ESI†) is achieved in the ternary solar cell with a ZY-4Cl concentration of 12 wt%, which is among the highest results reported for OSCs (Table S2, ESI†). In contrast, the PCEs of the binary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:ZY-4Cl are 17.72% and 2.32%, respectively. Note that despite the very low PCE, the solar cell based on PM6:ZY-4Cl shows a Voc as high as 1.012 V. This is the main reason for the increased Voc of the ternary device, as compared to that of the binary PM6:BTP-eC9 device. Reproducibility of the high-efficiency solar cells is also evaluated, as shown in Fig. 2b by the statistical PCE distribution histograms generated from 30 independent devices. Meanwhile, the reliability of the reported photovoltaic parameters is verified by the external quantum efficiency (EQE, QE-R3011, Enlitech) measurements (Fig. 2c): the Jscs calculated by integrating the product of the EQE spectra match well with the Jscs obtained from the J–V curves for all the solar cells studied in this work. The photostability of the solar cells under continuous illumination (100 mW cm−2) is also evaluated. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the photostability of the ternary solar cell is slightly better than that of the PM6:BTP-eC9 device. The ternary solar cell can retain 80% of its initial PCE value after 3750 min of continuous illumination, while the residual PCE of the host binary solar cell is reduced to 72%.

To understand the reason for the higher Jsc of the ternary solar cell, we first investigate the exciton dissociation efficiency by performing steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. From the steady-state PL spectra of the neat and blend films (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†), we can see that the quenching efficiency of donor emission in PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl is 99.2%, higher than that in PM6:BTP-eC9 (97.9%). This suggests that exciton dissociation is indeed more efficient in the ternary blend, giving rise to a higher Jsc. The weakened PL intensity at around 900 nm is probably due to the fact that the PL spectrum of ZY-4Cl apparently overlaps the absorption spectrum of BTP-eC9 (Fig. S4c, ESI†), which may lead to energy transfer between the two acceptors.37 Furthermore, from the TRPL measurements (Fig. S4d, ESI†), we find that the average fluorescence lifetime (τ) of BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl (678.28 ps) is significantly longer than that of BTP-eC9 (341.45 ps), further pointing out that energy transfer may occur from ZY-4Cl to BTP-eC9.38,39 We have also prepared acceptor-only devices, and the parameters are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The Jsc value of the BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl device (0.060 mA cm−2) is between that of neat BTP-eC9 (0.112 mA cm−2) and ZY-4Cl (0.023 mA cm−2), indicating no charge transfer existence between the two acceptors (Fig. S4e, ESI†). In addition, after blending PM6 with BTP-eC9 and BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl, the emission of PM6 is largely quenched with a shortened τ from 64.92 ps to 43.21 ps and 40.14 ps (Fig. S4f, ESI†), respectively, which further reveals the more efficient charge transfer in the resulting ternary device.
Then, we investigate the charge transport properties in the solar cells by measuring the electric field dependent photocurrent (Jph) extraction. As shown in Fig. 2d, for the PM6:ZY-4Cl device, the charge extraction efficiency is extremely low and the photocurrent does not reach a saturation value even at the effective voltage of 3 V. The inefficient exciton dissociation could be ascribed to the inferior phase separation in the PM6:ZY-4Cl device, which will be discussed in the following morphology section. On the other hand, for the PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl devices, Jph reaches saturation values at Veff of ∼1 V, and the charge dissociation probability P(E,T) (defined as the ratio of Jsc/Jsat, where Jsat represent the current saturation values) is 0.973 and 0.988, respectively. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to further gain insight into the charge recombination behaviour. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 2e) of the binary and ternary devices all display only a single semicircle, which reflects the charge recombination resistance (Rrec).40–42 The extracted Rrec in the ternary OSC is around 5112 Ω, higher than those of PM6:BTP-eC9 (4795 Ω) and PM6:ZY-4Cl (2431 Ω), suggesting that the addition of ZY-4Cl into PM6:BTP-eC9 can suppresses charge recombination. This result is consistent with the higher parallel resistance of the ternary device observed in the dark current–voltage characteristic (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, the reverse current density of the ternary blend is lower than that of binary blends, indicating the restrained leakage current and higher rectification ratio in the ternary device.
To further understand the charge recombination behaviour in the binary and the ternary OSCs, light intensity (Plight) dependent Jsc measurements were performed.43 From the Jscvs. Plight curves (Fig. 2g), a power law relation between Jsc and Plight, i.e., Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where α is the exponential factor, can be achieved. The α value of the ternary device (0.993) is higher than those of the binary devices (0.989 and 0.930), implying that bimolecular recombination in the ternary device is effectively suppressed. From the Vocvs. log(Plight) plots (Fig. 2h), the slope is 1.11 kT/q for the ternary device (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the Kelvin temperature, and q is the elementary charge), which is smaller than those of the binary ones, suggesting that the trap-assisted recombination is suppressed in the PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl device.44,45 The trap-assisted recombination can lead to reduced FF and Voc, due to the accelerated non-radiative recombination loss through the trap states.45
The charge carrier mobilities of the binary and ternary blends are determined by measuring the space-charge limited current (SCLC) in the single carrier devices.46 The J–V curves of the hole-only and the electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 2i and Fig. S5 (ESI†). The hole mobility (μh) and the electron mobility (μe) values are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). For the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, the μh and μe mobilities are 3.70 × 10−4 and 2.99 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.24, while for the PM6:ZY-4Cl blend, the μh and μe mobilities are 2.21 × 10−4 and 1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.74. In contrast, for the ternary device, the μh and μe mobilities are 3.84 × 10−4 and 3.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, higher than the binary blends and the μh/μe ratio is 1.19, indicating a balanced charge carrier transport in the ternary blend. This can contribute to the high Jsc and FF achieved in the ternary device. Moreover, the trap state density (nt) can be calculated by the equation of VTFL = entL2/(2ε0), where VTFL, e, L, ε and ε0 represent the trap-filled limited voltage, the elementary charge, active layer thickness, the relative dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity, respectively, and the nt of the PM6:BTP-eC9 device is 1.136 × 1016 cm−3, which is reduced to 1.089 × 1016 cm−3 for the ternary device.47
To investigate the morphological evolution in the binary and ternary blends, the atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing incident wide angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) were performed. The AFM height images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding phase images are depicted in Fig. 3b. From the AFM images, we find that all the blends contain fibrillar structures. The PM6:ZY-4Cl film shows a much rougher surface with larger aggregation than the PM6:BTP-eC9 film, which can also be confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. S6, ESI†). The large phase separation in the PM6:ZY-4Cl blend limits the exciton dissociation efficiency, and is thus the reason for the very low Jsc.48,49 Furthermore, the PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl film has a smooth surface, similar to the PM6:BTP-eC9 film, suggesting that the good compatibility between ZY-4Cl and BTP-eC9 can suppress the aggregation of ZY-Cl molecules in the ternary blend. Water and glycerol contact angle measurements of the neat films were performed for the determining of the surface tension (γ) values, following Wu's model (Fig. S7 and Table S5, ESI†). The γ values of PM6, BTP-eC9, and ZY-4Cl are 20.9, 27.1, and 24.4 mN m−1, respectively. We further investigate the degree of molecular miscibility by means of the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ, which is calculated via applying the equation χ = ( − )2.50,51 The extracted χ value for BTP-eC9/ZY-4Cl is 0.071 mN m−1, indicating the extremely good miscibility of the two acceptors. Fig. S8 (ESI†) presents the 2D GIWAXS patterns of the pristine films. The crystalline correlation lengths (CCLs) associated with the lamellar and π–π stacking peaks are listed in Table S6 (ESI†). It is found that both BTP-eC9 and ZY-4Cl exhibit preferential face-on orientations, evidenced by the strong (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction and (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane direction. From Fig. 3 and Fig. S9 (ESI†), it can be clearly seen that ZY-4Cl forms highly ordered packing in PM6:ZY-4Cl with several diffraction peaks located at 0.227, 0.303, and 0.450 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, which are very similar to Y6 in the optimized PM6:Y6 with a few characteristic diffraction peaks in the low q region (0.20–0.50 Å−1).52 We further compared the GIWAXS of PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl. We can see that the ternary blend shows slightly enhanced π–π stacking. The lamellar stacking is hard to compare since it contains multiple diffraction peaks. In the ternary blend, the changes of packing motif are found (the peak at q = 0.227 Å−1 in PM6:ZY-4Cl shifts to q = 0.250 Å−1 in PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl). The diffraction peak located at 0.300 Å−1 summarizes the lamellar information of PM6, BTP-eC9 and ZY-4Cl. In this case, the ternary blend shows a similar intensity with PM6:BTP-eC9, and its intensity is reduced compared to PM6:ZY-4Cl. These results indicate that ZY-4Cl in the ternary blend shows reduced lamellar order, which probably interacts with BTP-eC9 to form a new packing structure (the appearance of a diffraction peak at q = 0.250 Å−1). The detailed CCLs associated with the lamellar and π–π stacking peaks in the binary and ternary blends are summarized in Table S7 (ESI†).

The photocarrier generation and recombination dynamics in the binary and ternary blends were further analyzed by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements. The pump fluence was kept at a low level of 0.7 μJ cm−2 to minimize the effect of exciton–exciton annihilation. Fig. 4a and b show the 2D TA spectrogram and TA spectra recorded at several time delays of the PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl film, in which the excitation wavelength at 400 nm mainly excited the donors to initiate electron transfer processes. Simultaneously after excitation, the signals at around 630 nm, 700 nm and 830 nm can be attributed to the ground-state bleach (GSB) of PM6, ZY-4Cl and BTP-eC9 (Fig. S10, ESI†), respectively, corresponding to the PL spectra in Fig. S4a (ESI†). We compared the decay characteristics by calculating the corresponding phosphorescence lifetime with a tri-exponential fit (Fig. 4c and Table S8, ESI†). In general, the τ1 reflects the ultrafast exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interfaces, whereas τ2 is related to the exciton diffusion from the donor phase towards interfaces.53–55 Compared to PM6:BTP-eC9, the shorter τ1 and τ2 parameters corroborate the faster and more efficient electron transfer processes in the ternary blend. Furthermore, the τ2 values, closely associated to the donor phases, present the following order: PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl < PM6:BTP-eC9, in line with the AFM and GIWAXs results, implying that the domain size of the polymer donor may be positively correlated with the charge diffusion behaviour. It is worth mentioning that although the PM6:ZY-4Cl blend has the shortest τ1 and τ2, indicative of quickly transferring excitons from PM6 to donor/acceptor interfaces, the poor mobility of the blend (Table S4, ESI†) inhibits the effective electron transfer in the acceptor domain and thus causes more active non-geminate recombination of spatially separated charges in the resulting device,56 which can be reflected by the much lower τ3 value in comparison with those of the binary films. Normally, the τ3 value in the time range of hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds has far exceeded the time required for charge generation and extraction so that it tends to reflect the dynamics of free charges.55 In the absence of an external electric field, the relatively larger amorphous donor domain and efficient exciton dissociation yield slower trap-free bimolecular recombination,56 which is the root cause of the longest τ3 of PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl (Table S8, ESI†). We also chose the pump light of 800 nm to investigate hole transfer dynamics, as shown in Fig. 4d–f. The appearance of PM6 GSB signals can intuitively reveal the obvious hole transfer processes in PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl and PM6:BTP-eC9 blends (Fig. S11, ESI†). In contrast, inadequate signals can be collected in ZY-4Cl and PM6:ZY-4Cl films, which may originate from the lower photoluminescence efficiency in ZY-4Cl. This may be another crucial reason for the inefficiency of the PM6:ZY-4Cl device in addition to recombination losses. By comparing the relevant lifetimes for the hole transport processes (Table S9, ESI†), the ternary blend exhibits a significant reduction in τ1 and τ2, and a slightly larger τ3 value in comparison with those of the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, manifesting the deterred interfacial geminate recombination and facilitated charge collection.

Now we investigate voltage losses (Fig. 4g–i), defined as the difference between optical bandgaps (Eg) and Voc in the binary and ternary solar cells. First, the Eg of the three blends are determined by taking the derivative of the EQE spectra (dEQE/dE, Fig. S12, ESI†),57 and the calculated Vloss values are summarized in Table 2. We find that Vloss of the ternary solar cell is 0.520 V, lower than those of the binary solar cells based on PM6:BTP-eC9 (0.532 V) and PM6:ZY-4Cl (0.679 V). This is unexpected since the Vloss in a ternary solar cell is usually found to be in between those of the two binary devices.17,57 To understand the reason for the lower Vloss of the ternary device, we evaluate Vloss by dividing it into three different loss terms, following the expression:Vloss = Eg − qVoc = (Eg − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc)= (Eg − qVSQoc) + qΔVbelowgaprad + qΔVnon-rad = ΔV1 + ΔV2 + ΔV3(1)where VSQoc is the upper limit for Voc derived using the Shockley–Queissor theory, Vradoc is the radiative recombination limit for the Voc, and ΔV1, ΔV2, and ΔV3 represent the radiative voltage loss above the bandgap and below the bandgap, and the non-radiative voltage loss, respectively.

First, we calculate VSQoc, using the Shockley–Queissor theory. We find that VSQoc of the binary solar cell based on PM6:ZY-4Cl is 1.411 V, higher than that of the ternary device (1.124 V) or the binary device based on PM6:BTP-eC9 (1.123 V). This is due to the significantly higher Eg of the PM6:ZY-4Cl device. Then, we determine the ΔV1 values, which are 0.261, 0.282, and 0.261 V for the OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9, PM6:ZY-4Cl and PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl, respectively. To determine Vradoc for these OSCs, we calculate the Jrad0, the radiative recombination limit for the dark saturation current density, by performing highly sensitive EQE measurements, since (2) Vradoc = kT/q ln(Jph/Jrad0)(3)where BB is the blackbody photo flux at 300 K. The sensitive EQE spectra are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Because the sensitive EQE spectrum of the binary solar cell based on PM6:BTP-eC9 is similar to that of the ternary solar cell, the Vradoc of these solar cells are also similar (1.039 vs. 1.045 V). Accordingly, the ΔV2 of the solar cell based on PM6:BTP-eC9 is found to be very close to that of the ternary solar cell (0.084 vs. 0.079 V). On the other hand, the Vradoc of the solar cell based on PM6:ZY-4Cl is higher (1.275 V), due to the larger Eg of the PM6:ZY-4Cl blend, as compared to those of the ternary blend and the PM6:BTP-eC9 binary blend, and the ΔV2 is also higher (0.136 V), due to the higher degree of broadening of the tail of the EQE spectrum. The evaluation of ΔV2 reveals that the higher Vloss of the PM6:ZY-4Cl device, compared to those of the ternary and PM6:BTP-eC9 binary devices, is partially due to the high radiative recombination loss. Nevertheless, it does not explain the reason for the lower Vloss of the ternary solar cell, compared to that of the PM6:BTP-eC9 device. Thus, we calculate the ΔV3 for the binary and ternary solar cells, by measuring the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL), since ΔV3 = kT/q ln(1/EQEEL)(4)
The EQEEL measurement results are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). We find that the EQEEL of the ternary solar cell is 3.7 × 10−4 (determined at the injection current density close to the Jsc of the device), considerably higher than that of the binary solar cell based on PM6:BTP-eC9 (1.9 × 10−4); thus, the ΔV3 of the ternary solar cell (0.198 V) is lower than that of the binary device (0.214 V). This difference in ΔV3 of the ternary solar cell and the PM6:BTP-eC9 binary solar cell is 0.016 V, agreeing well with the Vloss difference of these solar cells (0.012 V). Therefore, the lower Vloss of the ternary solar cell could be ascribed to the lower non-radiative recombination voltage loss, which is due to the suppression of trap-assisted non-radiative decay channels in the ternary active layer.58,59
We further used this ternary blend to fabricate flexible OSCs (F-OSCs). The flexible device is based on Ag NWs/PH1000, acting as the bottom transparent anode and PFNDI-Br/Ag, acting as the top cathode.60 A schematic picture of the device architecture is shown in Fig. 5a, and the J–V characteristic curves of the flexible devices based on the PM6:BTP-eC9 and PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl are shown in Fig. 5b. From the J–V curve, we find that the ternary device shows a PCE of 16.07%, which is one of the highest efficiency values for F-OSCs. Compared to the solar cell based on PM6:BTP-eC9, the higher efficiency of the ternary OSC could also be ascribed to the higher Voc, as a result of the reduced Vloss. The histograms of the PCE values for 30 F-OSCs are also provided, as shown in Fig. 5c. Finally, we evaluate the mechanical stability of the flexible devices, by repeatedly bending the device to a certain curvature radius (r), as shown in Fig. 5d. We show that after 1000 consecutive bending cycles with a r of 5 mm, the PCE of the flexible device remained 95.6% of the initial value, and when r is reduced to 2.5 mm, the PCE value remained 90%. This demonstrates that the flexible ternary OSC based on PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl has a high flexural endurance.

Conclusions
In summary, we report highly efficient ternary OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl, and further applied this ternary system to the fabrication of flexible devices. The systematic characterizations indicate that the addition of a small amount of ZY-4Cl into the host PM6:BTP-eC9 leads to reduced density of trap states, optimized morphology and a more ordered structure of the materials, which can effectively promote charge extraction/collection, and thus suppress the voltage loss caused by trap-assisted recombination. As a result, the optimal PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl device shows a PCE of 18.69%, among the highest efficiencies for OSCs reported in the literature. Moreover, the flexible OSC based on the ternary blend also exhibits a high efficiency of 16.07% and the PCE can retain more than 95% of its initial value after 1000 bending cycles. These results manifest the great potential of this ternary system in the fabrication of high-performance OSCs, especially the flexible devices.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention as a new generation of photovoltaic technology due to their advantages of low cost, solution processability and mechanical flexibility. However, the open-circuit voltage, as an important parameter that determines the performance of OSCs, is still significantly lower than that of the inorganic or perovskite solar cells due to the large voltage loss (Vloss). The ternary strategy is one of the widely used approaches to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. However, for most ternary OSCs, the Vloss values are between those of the binary devices. To address this issue, we herein introduce a non-fullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl to regulate the microstructure and molecular packing of the donor/acceptor blend. The corresponding ternary OSC exhibits reduced density of trap states and suppressed non-geminate recombination, thus obtaining an obviously lower Vloss than either of the binary OSCs. As a result, high PCEs of 18.69% and 16.07% are achieved for the rigid and flexible PM6:BTP-eC9:ZY-4Cl OSCs, respectively. The flexible devices can maintain more than 95% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles. This work highlights the importance of suppressing non-radiative recombination in realizing high-performance OSCs.
