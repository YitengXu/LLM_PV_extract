    , Accepted 23rd March 2017First published on 29th March 2017AbstractPerovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) have attracted great attention in the past 7 years. Boosting the efficiency of pero-HSCs is still one ongoing direction. In this study, we report efficient pero-HSCs with [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron extraction layer (EEL), where the PC61BM EEL is processed from chlorobenzene mixed with pyridine solution (PC61BM-Py EEL) rather than from pure chlorobenzene solution (PC61BM EEL). It is found that the PC61BM-Py EEL exhibits dramatically enhanced electrical conductivity and has a smoother and denser thin film, as compared with that of the PC61BM EEL. Moreover, transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements demonstrate that a long charge carrier lifetime and a short charge extraction time are observed for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL, as compared with that with the PC61BM EEL, indicating that the charge carrier recombination is significantly reduced. As a result, more than 21.6% enhanced efficiency is observed for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL. Our finding provides a simple but an effective way to significantly boost the efficiency of pero-HSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite hybrid solar cells (pero-HSCs) have attracted great attention due to the broad absorption spectrum, low exciton binding energy, large charge diffusion length and high charge carrier mobility of perovskite hybrid materials and the possibility of cost-effective high-throughput manufacturing of pero-HSCs.1–5 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been boosted from 3.8% to over 20% in the past 7 years.6–9
For pero-HSCs, two device architectures have been intensively investigated. One was the conventional mesoscopic structure, in which a perovskite active layer was sandwiched between the hole extraction layer (HEL) and the electron extraction layer (EEL). In this device, a high-temperature sintering process was required to form the TiO2 EEL. Such a high-temperature process would hinder pero-HSCs from being cost-effectively manufactured on plastic substrates.10–12 Another device structure was a planar heterojunction (PHJ) structure, in which poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was typically used as the HEL and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was widely used as the EEL.13,14 The pero-HSC with a PHJ device structure is more suitable for pero-HSCs to be commercialized.
However, in PHJ pero-HSCs, the significant unbalanced electron and hole transport properties arising from the dramatically higher electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS HEL than that of the PC61BM EEL severely limit further advancement of PCEs.15,16 Boosting the electrical conductivity through reengineering the surface of the PC61BM EEL has been demonstrated to be one of the most efficient ways to resolve this problem.17,18 In this study, we report efficient pero-HSCs with a PC61BM EEL, where the PC61BM-Py EEL is processed from chlorobenzene (CB) solution mixed with pyridine (Py) (denoted PC61BM-Py EEL) rather than from pure CB solution (denoted PC61BM EEL). It is found that greater than 21.6% enhanced PCE is observed for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL as compared with that incorporated with the PC61BM EEL. Further investigations indicate that the dramatically increased electrical conductivity of the PC61BM-Py EEL and the formation of a smoother and denser PC61BM-Py EEL result in enhanced PCEs.
Experimental
Materials
Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar Inc. CH3NH3I (methylammonium iodide, MAI) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. PC61BM was purchased from Lumtec Corp. Bathocuproine (BCP), pyridine (Py), anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), ethanol (anhydrous, >99.5%), and anhydrous chlorobenzene (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received without further purification.
Perovskite precursor solutions
PbI2 was first dissolved in DMF and then stirred at 70 °C for 12 hours (h) to form a PbI2 DMF solution with a concentration of 400 mg mL−1. The PbI2 DMF solution was then stably stored overnight to obtain a clear yellowish supernatant solution. An MAI ethanol solution was prepared by directly dissolving MAI in ethanol with a concentration of 35 mg mL−1.
Thin film characterization
UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of thin films were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer and FLS920 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments), respectively. A 150 W, ozone-free xenon arc lamp was used in PL measurements. Spot sizes and excitation power were consistent and a slit with a resolution of 1 nm was used. The van der Pauw four-point probe method was used to measure the electrical conductivities of the thin films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Digital Instruments (DI) multimode nano-scope IIIA in tapping mode. Thin film thicknesses were measured using a surface profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-500).
Pero-HSC fabrication
A PEDOT:PSS layer (ca. 40 nm) was spin coated onto pre-cleaned and UV-treated ITO coated glass substrates, followed by thermal-annealing at 150 °C for 10 min in air, where ITO is indium tin oxide. Afterward, the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates were transferred into a glove-box in a nitrogen atmosphere. A PbI2 layer (∼150 nm) was spin-cast on the top of the PEDOT:PSS/ITO coated glass substrates at a spin-speed of 6000 rpm for 20 s. Then the substrates were placed on a hotplate at 75 °C for 10 minutes (min), followed by cooling down to room temperature. An MAI layer is then spin-coated on the top of the PbI2 layer film (3 second(s) loading time before spin-coating MAI solution to fully make MAI immersed into PbI2 film for reacting with PbI2 to form an approximately 300 nm perovskite) from the MAI ethanol solution at a spin-speed of 6000 rpm for 40 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 2 hours (h) to convert PbI2 and MAI into CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. After that, either a PC61BM EEL or a PC61BM-Py EEL (∼80 nm) was spin-cast on the top of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer from 20 mg mL−1 CB solution or CB solution with Py (1% volume ratio of Py to CB). Afterward, a ∼5 nm BCP thin layer was spin-coated on the top of the PC61BM EEL from 0.5 mg mL−1 ethanol solution with a spin-speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s.19 Lastly, a ∼120 nm thick silver (Ag) (which is much more stable than Al due to oxidation in air) was thermally deposited through a shadow mask in a vacuum with a press of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The device area was measured to be 0.16 cm2.
Pero-HSC characterization
The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the pero-HSCs were studied using a Keithley 2400 source meter under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G illumination from a classic solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity is calibrated using a Newport certified reference silicon cell (PV Measurements, with a KG-5 visible filter). A spectral mismatch factor (M) value of 1.03 was used to obtain the correct photocurrent and efficiency for the devices, according to a previously published paper,20 where the measurement conditions are identical. The hysteresis property was tested by sweeping the J–V measurements from both forward and reverse directions with a scan rate of 1 V s−1.
External quantum efficiency
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the pero-HSCs were recorded on a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a bromine tungsten light source, an SR830 lock-in amplifier and a calibrated Si detector.
Transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent
The cells were connected to a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS 3052C) and the input impedance of the oscilloscope was set to 1 MΩ and 50 Ω, respectively, for monitoring the charge density decay and charge extraction time. The transient photovoltage was measured under 0.3 sun background illumination. An attenuated laser pulse (500 nm) was used as a small perturbation to the background illumination on the device. The laser-pulse-induced photovoltage variation (ΔV) was smaller than 5% of the VOC produced by the background illumination. The transient photocurrent was measured by applying 500 nm laser pulses with a pulse width of 120 fs and a low pulse energy to short circuit devices in the dark. The laser pulses were generated from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator seeded regenerative amplifier with a pulse energy of 1.3 mJ at 800 nm and a repetition rate of 1 kHz (Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace).
Impedance spectral measurements
The impedance spectra (IS) of the pero-HSCs were obtained using an HP 4194A impedance/gain-phase analyzer in the dark, with an oscillating voltage of 10 mV from 5 Hz to 105 Hz. The pero-HSCs were held at a voltage close to the corresponding VOC of the pero-HSCs when the IS was carried out.
Results and discussion
The pero-HSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM (or PC61BM-Py)/BCP/Ag, as shown in Scheme 1, are fabricated and characterized, where BCP is used for blocking separated holes to be connected with the Ag cathode. The J–V characteristics of the pero-HSCs under white light illumination with a light intensity of 100 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 1a. The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL exhibit a VOC of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 18.02 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 76.74%, with a PCE of 12.44%. These device performance parameters are compatible with those reported values for pero-HSCs with a similar device structure.21 The pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL exhibit a VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 19.95 mA cm−2 and a FF of 79.78%, with a PCE of 15.13%. It is clear that there is over 21.6% enhancement in PCE, which is majorly attributed to the increased JSC and FF. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the histograms of statistical photovoltaic parameters for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL and the PC61BM-Py EEL respectively. These data are summarized from 100 lines in total. It is found that the statistical photovoltaic parameters are in accordance with Gauss distribution. Based on the results shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), it is concluded that the photovoltaic parameters of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL have a smaller standard deviation in comparison to those of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the pristine PC61BM EEL.

In order to investigate the hysteresis behavior of the pero-HSCs, J–V characteristics in different scan directions with a scan rate of 1 V s−1 are studied. In the forward direction, the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL exhibit a PCE of 13.40%. In the reverse direction, the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL exhibit a PCE of 13.72%. The difference is 0.32 in the different scan directions. Under the same conditions, the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL exhibit a PCE of 15.83% in the forward scan direction and a PCE of 15.99% in the reverse scan direction. The difference is 0.16 in the different scan directions. In both cases, the pero-HSCs exhibit marginal hysteresis behavior, but the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL exhibit minimized hysteresis behavior.

Fig. 1b shows EQE spectra of the pero-HSCs. As compared with that of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL, the EQE spectrum of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL reveals an enhancement in the wavelength (λ) ranging from 380 nm to 770 nm, with a maximum value of 89.74% at λ = 515 nm. The JSC values estimated from the EQE spectra are 18.55 mA cm−2 and 20.29 mA cm−2 for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL and the PC61BM-Py EEL, respectively. Theses JSC values are consistent with those extracted from J–V characteristics as shown in Fig. 1a.
In order to understand the enhanced JSC and FF of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL, the electrical conductivities of the PC61BM EEL and the PC61BM-Py EEL are measured and compared with that (9.8 × 10−2 S cm−1) of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The electrical conductivity of the PC61BM-Py thin film is ∼3.7 × 10−6 S cm−1, which is more than two orders higher than that (2.1 × 10−8 S cm−1) observed for the PC61BM thin film. The enhanced electrical conductivity of the electron extraction layer is favorable for charge transport, resulting in an increased efficiency of perovskite hybrid solar cells.
In order to understand the underlying physics of the effect of Py solvent additive on the device performance of the pero-HSCs, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM bilayer film and the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py bilayer film are studied. The results are shown in Fig. 2. A weak red-shifted absorption spectrum is observed for the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py thin film as compared with that of the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. Such red-shifted absorption is likely attributed to the fact that the addition of Py would assist PC61BM to form a structure with higher crystallinity and a better morphology, inducing CH3NH3PbI3 to have a different film morphology.22

AFM was further carried out to evaluate the topography and the height profile of the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin film and the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py thin film. The results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). According to the height image, the AFM images showed that the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the PC61BM layer was reduced, indicating the surface of PC61BM becomes smoother. The RMS of the CH3NH3PbI3 films is 13.03 nm. However, after PC61BM is coated on the top of the CH3NH3PbI3 films, the RMS of the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin film is significantly decreased to 2.95 nm. And the RMS of the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py thin film is reduced to 2.71 nm. The smooth surface of the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py layer would facilitate the electrons being transported from the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py layer to the BCP layer and being collected by the Ag electrode, resulting in a high JSC and large FF, and thus a high PCE.23,24 Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the top-view SEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM layer and the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py layer. Reduced aggregation of PC61BM molecules is observed for the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py layer, which indicates that the molecular packing of PC61BM is more condensed.
The steady-state PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film, the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin film and the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py thin film are shown in Fig. 3a. The emission peak of the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film is at 778 nm, which is attributed to the nanocrystalline perovskite particles.25–27 However, the effect of PL quenching is found within the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin film, which indicates that surface charge carrier recombination is suppressed. Moreover, a more striking PL quenching effect is observed within the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM-Py thin film than that within the CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM thin film, which indicates that more surface charge carrier recombination is suppressed, resulting in a significantly enhanced JSC and FF, and thus high PCE.28

In order to investigate the electron transport properties of the PC61BM EEL and the PC61BM-Py EEL, the electron-only device with an ITO/Al/PC61BM (or PC61BM-Py)/Al structure is fabricated and characterized. The J–V characteristics of the electron-only device in the dark are shown in Fig. 3b. The electron mobilities are extracted by fitting the J–V curves based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model.29 The PC61BM EEL exhibits an electron mobility of 4.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the PC61BM-Py EEL exhibits an electron mobility of 3.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is nearly ten times higher than that of the PC61BM EEL. Enhanced electron mobility is favorable for charge transport. As a result, enhanced JSC and FF values are also expected for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL.
In solar cells, the FF value is related to the series resistance (RS) and the shunt resistance (RSH) of the solar cells.30 The RS and RSH can be estimated for pero-HSCs using the reverse of the slope of the J–V curves. Both RS and RSH of different pero-HSCs are summarized in Table 1. The RS originates from the materials used for fabrication of solar cells and the contact resistances, while the RSH arises from the leakage current of solar cells.31 The RS value obtained for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL is ∼15.44 Ω cm2, which is larger than that (∼3.94 Ω cm2) of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL. The RSH (∼795.62 Ω cm2) value of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL is much smaller than that (∼1087.48 Ω cm2) of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL. From the perspective of the fundamental physics of solar cells, it is of great importance to keep the RS as small as possible, and RSH as large as possible to minimize charge carrier recombination, thus realizing high FFs.16,32 Therefore, it is concluded that the PC61BM-Py EEL can significantly reduce charge carrier recombination in the pero-HSCs, consequently resulting in high FFs.
Since the photo-generated charge carrier loss originates from charge carrier recombination, understanding of the mechanisms governing charge carrier recombination is very indispensable.33–35 To probe the kinetics of charge carrier recombination, the J–V characteristics are measured while the pero-HSCs are illuminated over a range of light intensities from 9.4 to 100 mW cm−2. The results are shown in Fig. 4a. The total current density J(V,I), which can be a combination of dark current density Jdark(V) and photocurrent density Jphoto(V,I), as a function of the applied voltage (V) and an incident light intensity (I), is described as:J(V,I) = Jdark(V) + Jphoto(V,I) = Jdark(V) − |e|dG(I)PC(V,I)where e is the elementary charge, d is the thickness of the perovskite layer, G(I) is the generation rate of bound electron–hole pairs per unit volume, and PC(V,I) is the charge collection probability, which is also a function of the bias voltage (V) under illumination intensity I.36 At large reverse bias (−0.5 V,) as well as under a sufficiently large internal field, most of the charge carriers can be swept out and collected by the respective electrodes.37 Therefore, PC(V,I) = 1, which is fully available without any charge carrier recombination, resulting in the following equations:

Fig. 4b shows the normalized photocurrent densities versus the applied voltage under different light intensities. For the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL, almost identical PC(V,I) characteristics at the different light intensities are observed for biases from −0.5 V to approximately 0.80 V, the maximum power point. As the applied voltage is greater than 0.80 V, the charge collection probability has dramatically changed. Therefore, it is concluded that the loss in efficiency in the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL is controlled by the monomolecular recombination mechanism. However, the J–V characteristics and normalized photocurrents of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL indicate that the charge collection probability is strongly dependent on the light intensity at a given applied voltage, as displayed in Fig. 4c and d. These results imply that the loss in efficiency in the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL is controlled by the bimolecular recombination rather than the monomolecular recombination.
To gain deep insight into charge carrier recombination dynamics in the pero-HSCs, transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were carried out.38–42 The results are shown in Fig. 5a and b. The TPV measurements were performed under light illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which is identical to the operational working conditions. Thus, the TPV is fitted with a mono-exponential decay, followed by δV = VM exp(−t/T), where VM is a constant that fits to the peak height, t is the time and T is the decay time constant.38 The photovoltage decay time is 0.42 μs for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL, while for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL, the photovoltage decay time is 0.63 μs. The prolonged lifetime suggests that less bimolecular recombination took place in the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL,42 resulting in high PCE. On the other hand, the TPC measurements indicate that the charge extraction time is decreased from 0.58 μs for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL to 0.43 μs for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL. Such a short charge extraction time implies that the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL exhibit reduced charge carrier recombination, resulting in high PCE.

IS was further carried out to investigate the internal series resistances (RS) of the pero-HSCs.43–45 The IS was conducted in the dark at an applied voltage close to VOC. The IS analysis enabled us to monitor the detailed electrical properties of the interfaces that cannot be determined by direct current measurements. The RS consists of the sheet resistance (RSheet) of the electrodes, and the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) at the interfaces between the electrode and the charge carrier extraction layer, as well as the charge carrier extraction layer and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer.46 In this study, both pero-HSCs have the same device structure; the only difference is in the electron extraction layer. The Nyquist plots of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL and the PC61BM-Py EEL are displayed in Fig. 6. The observed semicircle confirms the accuracy of the RC circuit model and also indicates that each layer is relatively homogeneous along with the transport pathways without having discernible multiple interfacial boundaries. Based on the impedance values at low frequencies, the RCT value of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL is 625 Ω, which is lower than that (960 Ω) of the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM EEL. The smaller RCT solely originates from the high electrical conductivity of the PC61BM-Py EEL. Thus, as expected, high JSC and high PCEs are observed for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL.

Conclusion
In this study, we report efficient solution-processed pero-HSCs incorporated with a PC61BM electron extraction layer (EEL), where the PC61BM EEL is processed from chlorobenzene mixed with pyridine solution. Systematic studies indicate that their enhanced efficiency originated from the enhanced electrical conductivity, decreased series resistance and smoother surface of the PC61BM EEL. Moreover, transient photovoltage and transient photocurrent measurements demonstrate that a long charge carrier lifetime and a short charge extraction time are observed for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL, as compared with that with the PC61BM EEL, indicating that the charge carrier recombination is significantly reduced. As a result, more than 21.6% enhanced efficiency is observed for the pero-HSCs incorporated with the PC61BM-Py EEL. Our finding provides a simple but an efficient way to significantly boost the efficiency of pero-HSCs.
