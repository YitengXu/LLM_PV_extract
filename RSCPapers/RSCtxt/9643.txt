    , Accepted 5th February 2013First published on 5th February 2013AbstractA series of donor (D)–acceptor (A) alternating copolymers based on a benzotriazole (BTZ) acceptor and different dithiophene donors, such as dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (NT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (ST) and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CT), have been successfully synthesized to study the effect of bridging atoms on the properties for application in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The resulting copolymers exhibit good solubility in organic solvents, good thermal stability and low bandgaps. It is important to note that their absorption spectra, electronic energy levels as well as photovoltaic properties can be facilely modulated by changing the bridging atom of donor segments from N, Si to C. The UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry results show that PNTBTZ containing NT block has the best light-harvesting ability and the narrowest bandgap because of the strongest electron-donating property of NT unit compared to ST and CT. However, PSTBTZ exhibits the lowest lying HOMO energy level, which is beneficial to achieve the high Voc of the related polymer solar cells. The basic electronic structures of D–A model compounds of these copolymers were also studied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The PSCs using these copolymers were fabricated and evaluated with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. As expected, the PNTBTZ device has the highest Voc value among these PSCs for the deepest HOMO energy level. However, the device based on PCTBTZ with a C-bridged dithiophene (CT) donor segment exhibits the highest Jsc of 9.24 mA cm−2, FF of 0.64 and PCE of 4.02% due to the broadest and strongest spectral response as well as ideal morphology compared to PNTBTZ and PSTBTZ.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics represent a potential approach to meeting the growing energy demand for renewable clean energies. Polymer solar cells (PSCs), in particular, have attracted considerable interest due to their unique advantages, such as low cost, easy fabrication, light-weight nature, and the capability to fabricate flexible large-area devices.1 In the past decade, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, using conjugated polymers as electron donors and fullerene derivatives of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as electron acceptors, have proven to be the most effective combination in PSCs.2 Because the fullerene derivatives exhibit weak absorption in the visible range, the electron-donating conjugated polymers make the main contribution in harvesting the photons in these devices.3 To achieve enhanced absorption of the polymer domains, the concept of low-bandgap (LBG) conjugated copolymers was utilised by incorporating electron-rich donor (D) and electron-deficient acceptor (A) segments into the polymer backbones.4 Recently, significant progress has been made in this field, and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been improved from around 1% to over 9%, primarily due to efficient-developing new LBG polymers, fine-adjusting the frontier molecular orbital energy levels, and well-controlling the nanoscale morphologies of donor/acceptor interpenetrating networks.5 Although considerable progress has been achieved, the PCEs of PSCs still need to be further improved for commercialization.6 So the optimization of molecular structures of LBG copolymers is of great importance to realize high-performance PSCs.
In comparison to the great advances in donor moieties of the prepared LBG copolymers, the availability of effective acceptor blocks has been severely limited. Among the few effective acceptors, the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit has been widely used as the electron-accepting part for building D–A copolymers because of its strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), good π–π stacking, as well as simple synthesis.7 High performance PSCs were then achieved by blending BT-based copolymers and fullerene derivatives (PC61BM or PC71BM), such as benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-BT, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-BT, dithienosilole-BT, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole-BT, carbazole-BT, and indolo[3,2-b]carbazole-BT alternating copolymers.5b,8 As an analog of BT (replacing of the sulfur atom with nitrogen atom), benzotriazole (BTZ) is another interesting electron-withdrawing moiety with two imine (CN) nitrogen atoms, which is expected to be used to build LBG copolymer for PSC application. Although its electron-accepting capability is weaker than BT, the BTZ-based polymers will have a better solubility because of the long alkyl side chains substituted on the nitrogen atom of triazole ring.9 As mentioned above, benzotriazole-containing conjugated copolymers have been gained interest recently for potential application in PSCs.10 In these photovoltaic copolymers, the donor blocks included fluorene,9 carbazole,10c,11 dibenzosilole,10d dithienosilole,12 diindenopyrazine,13 and benzodithiophene14 structures. Except for the fluorine-atom-modified BTZ,14a,14b most of the fabricated PSCs based on these BTZ-containing copolymers exhibit minimal PCEs due to the relatively large bandgap and poor absorption.
To further extend the absorption and modulate the electronic energy levels, exploration of different atom-bridged dithiophene donors incorporated into the BTZ-based polymeric backbone is highly desirable. Herein, we designed and synthesized three new BTZ-based D–A alternating conjugated copolymers using dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (NT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (ST) and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CT) as donor blocks, which contain different bridging atoms (N, Si and C) leading to strong electron-donating ability. By changing the bridging atom from N, Si to C, the different length of C–X (X = N, Si, C) bond and electronic delocalization state could provide fine-tuning the inter-chain polymer packing to improve hole mobility, frontier molecular orbital energy levels as well as the bandgaps.8a,8b,15 These copolymers were synthesized by a palladium(0)-catalyzed Stille coupling reaction, as shown in Scheme 1. The effects of the different donor segments, donor–acceptor strength, and backbone planarity on the absorption spectra, electronic and photovoltaic properties of the obtained copolymers were investigated. The primary results indicated that these copolymers had promising applications for PSCs with improved performance.

Experimental part
Characterization
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected on a Bruker ARX 400 NMR spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were made on an CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an anhydrous nitrogen-saturated acetonitrile solution (0.1 mol L−1) of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4). The copolymers were coated on the platinum plate working electrodes from dilute chloroform solutions. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Carry 300 spectrophotometer. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with ITO glass as an anode, Ca/Al as a cathode and the film blend of the copolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the photosensitive layer. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a solution blend of the copolymer and PC71BM in dichlorobenzene on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measurement system. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. The thickness of the films was measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for the monomers and copolymers are outlined in Scheme 1. 4,7-Dibromo-2-dodecyl-2,1,3-benzotriazole (2) was prepared by bromination of 2-dodecyl-2,1,3-benzotriazole (1) according to a previous report.16 The Stille coupling reaction of compound 2 with tributyl(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded 2-dodecyl-4,7-bis(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzotriazole (3) with a good yield of 73%. Further bromination of 3 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in darkness gave the BTZ-based monomer 4 in a high yield of 84%. The other monomers 6, 8 and 10 were synthesized by treating the corresponding atom-bridged dithiophene derivatives with n-butyllithium solution and then quenched with tributyltin chloride, as described by our previous procedures.8g,15b The designed copolymers were synthesized from organic tin monomers (6, 8, or 10) and bromide 4 by the Pd(0)-mediated Stille coupling polymerization. Crude copolymers were purified by extracting with methanol, hexane and chloroform in this order. The resulting copolymers were obtained by reprecipitation of the concentrated chloroform solution in methanol several times. The structures of the copolymers were confirmed with NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Fig. 1).

These polymers, PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, show good solubility in common organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran, etc., which is attributed to the substituted alkyl side chains on the skeletons of BTZ and atom-bridged dithiophenes. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI, Mw/Mn) of PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) against polystyrene standards in THF as the eluent. As shown in Fig. 2a, the GPC results indicated that these copolymers have a high Mn of 14800–18600 with a narrow PDI of 1.53–1.66. Decomposition onset temperatures (Td) (about 5% weight loss) were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to be 361, 430 and 380 °C for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, respectively (Fig. 2b). Good thermal stability of the photovoltaic polymer is necessary for device fabrication and measurements. Obviously, such excellent thermal properties are adequately suitable for preventing the deformation and degradation of the blending active layer in PSCs. The results of molecular weights and the thermal analysis are listed in Table 1.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption properties of the obtained copolymers were measured both in CHCl3 solutions (Fig. 3a, Table 2) and thin films spin-coated on quartz slides (Fig. 3b and Table 2). As shown in Fig. 3a, the copolymers in chloroform solutions showed broad absorptions ranging from 400 to 700 nm with main peaks at 521, 513 and 510 nm for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, respectively. These peaks were attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer transitions (ICT) between the donor segments and the acceptor moieties.19PNTBTZ exhibited another absorption at about 370 nm resulting from the dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (NT) segments. However, this type of absorption at 370 nm was not observed from PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, which indicated that the electronic configurations of electron-donating segments (dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (ST) and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CT)) and the electron accepting unit (BTZ) in the two D–A alternating copolymers are mixed.10cFig. 3b shows the absorption spectra of the copolymer films. As compared to their counterparts in the solution state, the broad peaks in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm showed different red-shifts of 56, 20 and 50 nm for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, respectively. The reason could be explained by the aggregation and strong interchain interactions between the conjugated backbones in the solid state, which could facilitate charge transportation for photovoltaic applications.8f,8g The energy bandgaps calculated from the absorption band edges of the optical absorption spectra were about 1.59, 1.72 and 1.69 eV for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, respectively. The results indicated that PNTBTZ had the smallest bandgap due to the stronger ICT effect and the electron-donating ability of NT compared to ST and CT. It is worth noting that PCTBTZ exhibited lower energy absorption than PNTBTZ in chloroform solution, which indicated that more aggregation of the PCTBTZ polymer main chains existed. The results suggest that changing the electron-donating ability of donor blocks would easily and finely tune the bandgaps of BTZ-based copolymers. Furthermore, increasing the electron-donating ability of the donor segments, the orbital mixing with the acceptor units in the related D–A copolymers would be effectively enhanced, which is a good approach to improve the absorption behavior for design of high performance photovoltaic polymers.

Electrochemical properties
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the prepared copolymers are important parameters in determining the Voc, charge separation and transportation efficiencies in PSCs. To investigate the electrochemical properties of the copolymers and estimate their HOMO and LUMO energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out by using a three-electrode cell in an anhydrous CH3CN solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4). A platinum plate coated with a thin film of the studied copolymer, a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.40 eV by using previous methods.20 The resulting oxidation and reduction curves of the copolymer thin films are shown in Fig. 4 and the electrochemical redox data are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4, all the copolymers show predominant oxidation peaks due to the electron-donating segments (NT, ST and CT) and a slight reduction peak related to the electron-withdrawing BTZ unit. From the onset potentials of the p-doping process, the HOMO energy levels were determined to be −5.00, −5.21 and −5.06 eV for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ, respectively. While the LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −2.87, −2.91 and −2.85 eV for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ from the onset potentials of the cathodic sweep, respectively. Thus, the bandgaps (Eg) of PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ were calculated to be about 2.13, 2.30 and 2.21 eV. The changing trends are consistent with those obtained by the optical method described above. However, the electrochemical bandgaps of these copolymers are little larger than the optical bandgaps determined from the absorption edges. Similar phenomena have been observed from N-, Si- and C-bridged bithiophene-based copolymers reported before.8c,15a,21

Theoretical calculations
The optimized geometries and electronic properties of their model molecules (NTBTZ, STBTZ and CTBTZ) of the resulting conjugated copolymers were simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level on model compounds using the Gaussian 09 program suite.15b The alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups to save calculation time and simplify calculations process, which did not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries and the electronic properties. The HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the model compounds are shown in Fig. 5. The results indicated that the electron density of LUMO was mainly localized on the BTZ skeleton for NTBTZ, STBTZ and CTBTZ. On the other hand, the electronic wave function of the HOMO exhibit nice delocalization along the whole the conjugated molecule, which was beneficial for obtaining a higher hole mobility.22 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of NTBTZ, STBTZ and CTBTZ were calculated to be −4.61/−2.00 eV, −4.69/−2.05 eV and −4.65/−2.03 eV, respectively. The bandgaps were then determined to be 2.61, 2.64 and 2.62 eV. With increasing repeat units of the copolymers, the HOMOs and LUMOs of (NTBTZ)4, (STBTZ)4 and (CTBTZ)4 display local π characteristics (Fig. 5). For these tetramers, the localization of the electronic cloud distributed in the middle part of the molecular skeletons is typically expected for chain-end effects, which is similar to the results observed in our previous work.23 The HOMOs delocalized the middle part of conjugated backbones, and the LUMOs are localized on the donor and acceptor units, which indicates that the donor and acceptor units have an important affect on the HOMOs and LUMOs of the D–A copolymers.

Photovoltaic properties
To verify the photovoltaic properties of these BTZ-based copolymers, conventional BHJ PSCs were fabricated and measured according to our previous work.5b,6,8f,8g The typical device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. PC71BM was chosen here instead of PC61BM due to its significantly broader and stronger absorption in the visible region. The fabrication conditions were optimized by changing the ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM and the thickness of the active layer. The active layers were spin-coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions of the copolymers and PC71BM, and the optimal weight ratio of copolymer to PC71BM was found to be 1:1.2 for PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ. The optimal thicknesses for blend films of PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ with PC71BM were about 100, 85 and 90 nm, respectively. All the PSC devices were evaluated under simulated 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G illumination. The photovoltaic results including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of these studies are depicted in Fig. 7 and Table 3. High hole-mobility can afford good charge transport within the active layer without large photocurrent loss due to recombination of opposite charges. Therefore, the hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM (1:1.2)/Au were fabricated to evaluate the hole mobility in the blended films by space charge limited current (SCLC) method according to our previous work.15b As shown in Fig. 6, the measured hole mobilities of PNTBTZ:PC71BM, PSTBTZ:PC71BM and PCTBTZ:PC71BM were 5.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

1/2–V characteristics of copolymer-based hole-only devices measured at ambient temperature. 
From Fig. 7a, the PNTBTZ, PSTBTZ and PCTBTZ devices show Voc of 0.62, 0.74 and 0.68 V, Jsc of 6.17, 8.41 and 9.24 mA cm−2, FF of 0.55, 0.54 and 0.64, resulting in PCEs of 2.10%, 3.39% and 4.02%, respectively. It is known that the Voc is dependent on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.24 As expected in this work, PSTBTZ-based PSCs exhibit higher Voc among these devices due to the deeper HOMO energy level than those of PNTBTZ and PCTBTZ. Furthermore, we should note that the PSC based on PCTBTZ containing cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CT) block has the highest Jsc value, which is verified by the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) measured under monochromatic illumination (Fig. 7b) and morphology studies of the blend films from the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 7b, the shapes of the EQE curves of the devices are similar to their absorption spectra, indicating that the spectral responses of the fabricated PSCs are mainly determined by the polymer donors. Obviously, the addition of PC71BM enhanced the absorption of the copolymers for its significantly broader and stronger absorption in the visible region. The spectral response of the PCTBTZ device covers a broader wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm with the maximum EQE value of 63% at about 575 nm, which is much higher than those of PNTBTZ and PSTBTZ based devices. Fig. 8 shows the AFM topographic images of the films of copolymer:PC71BM (1:1.2, w/w) blends recorded in tapping mode. An ideal domain size of 10–20 nm of copolymer and fullerene derivative with an interpenetrating network has been found to be important for achieving high-performance PSCs. However, both larger (>10–20 nm) and smaller (<10–20 nm) domain sizes of the blend films will limit charge transfer and separation.2b The AFM results indicated that all the films exhibited typical cluster structures with many aggregated domains. Obviously, PCTBTZ:PC71BM films exhibited a more uniform and bicontinuous network with finer nanoscale features (10–20 nm), which was very helpful to improve the FF values and carrier transport properties, giving rise to higher PCEs of the related devices. As mentioned above, although the Voc of PCTBTZ device is not so high, the enhanced spectral response, high hole mobility and ideal morphology of active blend guarantee the highest efficiency among these PSCs.

Conclusions
A series of low bandgap donor (D)–acceptor (A) alternating copolymers containing benzotriazole (BTZ) acceptor with different electron-donating dithiophene derivatives of dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (NT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (ST) and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CT), have been successfully synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization. Their absorption spectra and electronic energy level can be facilely modulated by changing the bridging atom of dithiophene skeleton from N, Si to C. The UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry measurements show that PNTBTZ containing NT block has the best light-harvesting ability and the narrowest bandgap due to the highest electron-donating properties of the NT unit compared to ST and CT. PSTBTZ exhibits the lowest lying HOMO energy level, which can be helpful to achieve high Voc of the related devices. The basic electronic structure of D–A model compounds of these copolymers were also studied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The photovoltaic cells using these copolymers were fabricated and evaluated with a typical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The results showed that the blend hybrid of PCTBTZ with C-bridged dithiophene (CT) donor segment exhibits highest efficiency of 4.02% due to the broadest and strongest spectral response as well as ideal morphology compared to PNTBTZ and PSTBTZ. The present results indicate that optimal electronic, optical, and photovoltaic properties of BTZ-based copolymers can be achieved by just fine-tuning the bridging atom of donor segments for application in polymer solar cells.
