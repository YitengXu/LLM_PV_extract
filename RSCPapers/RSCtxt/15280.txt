    , Accepted 30th March 2020First published on 2nd April 2020AbstractNd3+-Sensitised luminescent upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have gained interest recently as theranostics due to their near-infrared (NIR) light excitation with a better tissue penetration depth. One example is the core/shell design NaYF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb. When harvesting the upconversion energy in such architectures, the long emitter–photosensitizer (i.e. Er3+–PS) distances lead to inefficient Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Herein, we report a new nanocomposite NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y with Nd3+ ions in the core and Er3+ ions in the shell to shorten the Er–PS distance to achieve better FRET. Furthermore, an outer non-emitting protective Y3+ shell and a conducting Yb3+ shell reduced surface quenching and Er3+-to-Nd3+ energy back transfer effects, respectively. The upconversion FRET and downshifting emission efficiencies were simultaneously optimised by adjusting the thickness of the Y3+ shell, and the FRET efficiency was at least 3.7 times that of the reference NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y in a photodynamic therapy (PDT) model.
Introduction
With the development of nanotechnology, various nanomaterials have been developed for use in the fields of medicine and energy.1–3 Efficacies of materials that need to be used in medical contexts along with their light excitation, absorption, and emission are significantly affected by the tissue penetration depth of light4 and auto-fluorescence of biomolecules.5 Attempts to use X-ray-excited nano-scintillators6,7 have been reported to circumvent the tissue penetration issue in photodynamic therapy. On the other hand, because organisms show relatively low absorption coefficients in the near-infrared (NIR) region of 650–1700 nm, NIR light excitation could be another approach to effectively penetrate deeper tissues.8,9 Several NIR-excited trivalent lanthanide (Ln) metal ion-doped upconversion luminescent nanoparticles10–12 (UCNPs) such as NaLnF4:Yb,Er (Ln = Y, Gd, La, and Lu; the 3+ charges for trivalent lanthanide ions are omitted for simplicity, vide infra) have been prepared and applied in phototherapy,13,14 drug release,15 biosensing,16 optogenetics,17 and solar cells.18
In some biomedical applications, 980 nm light was used to excite Yb3+ ions and up-convert the absorbed energy to Er3+ ions and emit visible and NIR lights.19 However, excitation at 980 nm may cause tissue overheating due to significant absorption by water molecules.20,21 Thus, in recent years, Nd3+-ion-doped UCNPs such as NaLnF4:Nd,Yb,Er (Ln = Y or Gd) have been proposed for use with excitation at 790–808 nm to reduce the extent of water absorption.22,23 So far, most of the studies have employed 808 nm light to excite Nd3+ ions and the absorbed energy was down-shifted to Yb3+ ions to emit NIR light at 980 nm as well as upconverted to Er3+ ions to emit visible light at 540 nm and 660 nm and also down-shifted to Er3+ ions to emit at 1525 nm. This approach can greatly reduce the non-specific thermal effect of the biological tissues compared to excitation at 980 nm and is expected to achieve better theranostic effect at reduced doses.24 Note that a study on Er3+-to-Cy3.5 dye energy transfer in DNA-coated core and core/shell/shell UCNPs with 980 nm and 808 nm excitation of Yb3+ and Nd3+ ions has been reported for possible application in nucleic acid biosensing.25
Research on and development of lanthanide UCNP theranostics is under progress and is of current research interest. A number of methods have been employed to enhance the overall luminescence of Yb3+- and Nd3+-sensitised UCNPs, such as optimisation of the thickness of an added non-emitting outer protective Y shell, e.g. NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4,26 and utilisation of a core/shell design, e.g., NaGdF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb and NaYF4:Yb/Er(Tm)/Nd@Nd,27–30 to reduce the surface quenching and cross relaxation, as well as the addition of a conducting Yb shell to result in a core/shell/shell design, e.g. NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb,31 to reduce the back transfer from Er3+ to Nd3+ ions. Other efforts have included the derivatisation of surface-bound NIR dyes as antenna to increase the efficiency of NIR light energy transfer.32,33 However, in addition to the low upconversion quantum yield, the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between the UCNP emitters (donors) and external photosensitizers (acceptors, PS, e.g. Rose Bengal (RB)34,35 or Chlorin e6 (Ce6)36) could also be improved, particularly in photodynamic therapy.
Because the FRET efficiency decays following a sigmoidal function with increasing distance between the activated emitter (e.g. Er, Ho, Tm) and the photosensitizer,37 the amount of singlet oxygen (1O2) molecule production would be different if other effects such as surface quenching and energy back transfer of the UCNPs were also considered. Therefore, it is possible to optimise the overall luminescence energy transfer efficiency: several examples are known.38 In one such case, the core/shell UCNPs NaYF4:Yb,Ho@Nd,Yb had a partially optimised shell thickness of 1.5 nm for 1O2 molecule production when applied in photodynamic therapy.39 In another example, the core/shell UCNPs NaYF4:Yb@Er, where sensitisers and activators were spatially inversely distributed unlike the reference NaYF4:Er@Yb, showed a higher luminescence intensity due to a shorter donor–acceptor distance (e.g. Er–RB).40 More recently, a non-emitting outer protective Gd shell was further added to prepare core/shell/shell UCNPs NaYbF4:Gd@NaYF4:Gd,Er@NaYF4:Gd to obtain emission 2 times brighter than that of the reference NaYF4:Gd,Yb,Er@NaYF4:Gd and an 8-fold emission enhancement from surface-bound dye chemophores through Er to dye FRET.41 Earlier, we applied for a patent application for the use of UCNPs NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er in photodynamic therapy.42 The 2nd and 3rd examples mentioned above used the inferior NIR 980 nm excitation, unlike the 790–808 nm excitation used by the 4th example.
In this study, to improve the UCNP luminescence efficiency in photodynamic theranostics and related applications, we designed and prepared new UCNPs NaYF4:Nd(20%),Yb(10%)@NaYF4:Yb(10%)@NaYF4:Yb(10%),Er(1%)@NaYF4@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA (mol%) with a core/shell/shell/shell architecture (Scheme 1), utilising the 793 nm excited energy downshifting and upconversion chain of Nd3+(λ793 nm) → Yb3+(λ980 nm) → Er3+(λ540, 660, 1525 nm) → RB to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) molecules for deep tissue-penetrating photodynamic therapy and imaging including in the NIR-IIb wavelength window.43–45 This design strategy involves shortening the emitter–photosensitizer distance for better FRET efficiency and minimising surface quenching and energy back transfer for better luminescence. The key is to place the Nd3+ sensitiser in the core and the Er3+ emitter in the second shell with an outermost non-emitting protective Y shell and a conducting Yb inner shell to shorten the emitter–photosensitizer distance as well as to reduce surface quenching46 and Er3+-to-Nd3+ back transfer effects,31 respectively. The Nd3+ ions in the core would absorb NIR light and down-shift energy to Yb3+ ions, the first conducting Yb shell reduces the energy back transfer from Er3+ to Nd3+ ions, the Er3+ ions in the second Yb,Er shell receive upconverted energy from Yb3+ ions and emit 540 nm and 660 nm visible lights to activate the nearby photosensitizers (e.g. RB) for 1O2 molecule production and to emit at 1525 nm for potential imaging application in the NIR-IIb wavelength window. Note that the NIR-IIb (short-wave infrared, SWIR) imaging has less light scattering and minimal autofluorescence which could facilitate higher resolution in biological imaging and has been one of the recent hot topics.43,44
 Scheme 1  New nanocomposite NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA containing the RB and cancer cell-targeting folate group exhibits more singlet oxygen production in photodynamic therapy due to more efficient FRET by shortening the Er–RB distance and greater emission at 1525 nm for potential NIR-IIb imaging under 793 nm light irradiation. The upconversion FRET and downshifting emission efficiencies can be simultaneously optimised by adjusting the Y3+ shell thickness. 
The mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA surface modifications containing the RB and cancer cell-targeting folate (PEG-FA) group were achieved using known procedures. Moreover, the thickness of the outermost Y shell could be further optimised, i.e. thicker for enhanced prevention of surface quenching and thinner for better FRET efficiency. For comparison, the reference core/shell/shell/shell UCNPs NaYF4:Yb(10%),Er(1%)@NaYF4:Yb(10%)@NaYF4:Nd(20%),Yb(10%)@NaYF4 with the Er3+ emitter in the core and the Nd3+ sensitiser in the second shell were prepared. In this case, the Er3+–RB distance is generally longer than that in the former. A 793 nm NIR laser excitation source was used because we previously found that the luminescence intensity of 793 nm-excited Nd3+ doped UCNPs was about 4 times greater than that excited at 808 nm with lower power and increased safety.47
Results and discussion
To accurately control the shell thickness with high reproducibility, the designed nanomaterials were synthesised according to a thermal decomposition method with a successive layer-by-layer strategy (SLBL)48 to ensure that the various shells could be uniformly coated on the surfaces of the cores. More details are provided in the Experimental section (ESI†). The TEM images (Fig. 1) of the hexagonal UCNPs NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y show that their estimated diameters increased with increasing number of shells coated onto the cores and no self-nucleation cores were formed separately. The estimated diameters of at least two reproducible synthetic batches with less than 10% relative size variation in each case were determined from TEM images (ESI Table S1†). Separate DLS analyses showed that all UCNPs were mono-dispersive (ESI Fig. S1 and Table S1†) and the particle sizes obtained by DLS analyses were larger than those estimated from TEM images as reported previously.6,47 Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the representative core and core/shell/shell UCNPs for both NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb showed that Ln3+ ions were indeed present on their surfaces (Fig. S2, ESI†). As expected, only Y, Nd, and Yb were seen in the EDS data of the core NaYF4:Nd,Yb while Y, Yb, and Er but not Nd were seen in the second shell of NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er. On the other hand, only Y, Yb, and Er and Y, Nd, and Yb were detected in the core and second shell EDS data of NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb, respectively. ICP elemental analysis results for each lanthanide of these UCNPs were consistent with their designed compositions (ESI Table S2†).6,47

A 793 nm NIR laser with a power density of 0.8–1.0 W cm−2 was used in this study, which is lower than the safety limit (2.4 W cm−2) for laser therapy application.49 The upconversion luminescence spectra displaying the typical Er3+, 2H11/2 to 4I15/2 and 2F9/2 to 4I15/2 transitions in the visible wavelength region of the core/shell, core/shell/shell, and core/shell/shell/shell UCNPs with different outermost Y shell thicknesses (i.e. 2.1–2.9, 4.8–6.2, and 11.3–11.5 nm) are shown in Fig. 2(a, left). For comparison, the emission spectra for UCNPs NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb,Er (no. 1), NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb,Er@Y (no. 2), NaYF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb (no. 7), and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb@Y (no. 8) without the conducting Yb shell and/or the outermost protective Y shell are also included. The concentration of each sample was normalised to 10 mM Nd3+ in hexane. The photon counts of the highest emissive 540 nm peaks of the various UCNPs are listed in ESI Table S1† and plotted in Fig. 2(a, right).

(b, Right) Downshifted photon counts of emissive 975 nm and 1525 nm peaks of various UCNPs; 1525 nm photon count values have been multiplied 5 times for better visual comparison.

Fig. 2(a, right) and Table S1† show that adding a protective 2.0 nm-thick Y shell on the core/shell UCNPs NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb,Er (no. 1) increases the photon count by 4.5 times due to reduced surface quenching (no. 2), which is greater than that of adding a conducting 1.7 nm-Yb shell (no. 3), to prevent energy back transfer from Er3+ to Nd3+, i.e. 1.3 times. If both Yb and Y shells (i.e. 2.9 nm thickness) were added (no. 4), the photon count increased drastically by 166 times. A further increase in the protective Y shell thickness from 2.9 to 4.8 nm (no. 5) and 11.5 nm (no. 6) resulted in successive photon count increases of 1.3 and 1.5 times, respectively. Similar trends were observed for photon counts of the reference UCNPs NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y. The photon count of NaYF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb (no. 7) was about 18 times that of NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb,Er (no. 1) because the Nd shell of the former can act as an insulting shell to help prevent the surface quenching of Er3+ emission in the core. Adding a protective 2.1 nm-thick Y shell on the core/shell UCNPs NaYF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb (no. 7) increases the photon count 11.3 times due to even better suppression of surface quenching (no. 8). In addition, on placing Nd in the core, upconversion energy transfer from Nd3+ through Yb3+ to Er3+ in the shell was less efficient, leading to a lower luminescence compared to that obtained with the Nd in the shell and the Er in the core, as noted for all the corresponding UCNP pairs, i.e. 1/7, 2/8, 3/9, 4/10, 5/11 and 6/12 (Fig. 2a (right) and ESI Table S1†). This was because that the Nd in the core (i.e. Er in the shell) with an 8.65 nm radius has a less average energy transfer efficiency as compared to the Nd in a thin 2.2 nm shell (i.e. Er in the core)50 and because the latter has thicker overall protective shells against surface quenching. Based on the variation trend of no. 10–12, the photon counts seemed likely to increase until reaching a limiting value as the thickness of the protective shell was increased.
Compared to other selective UCNPs, NaYF4:Yb,Er,Nd@Nd UCNPs28 were investigated earlier without Yb in the outer shell or an insulating Y shell, which led to a lower luminescence intensity compared with that of our and several other previously reported materials with both Yb and Y shells. The emission intensity of the optimised NaYF4:Nd,Yb,Er@Nd(20%),Yb(10%) core–shell UCNPs can be 522 and 2.6 times higher than that of NaYF4:Nd,Yb,Er core-only and NaYF4:Nd,Yb,Er@Nd core–shell UCNPs, respectively.29 The luminescence of the reference material designated as no. 7, i.e. NaYF4:Yb,Er@Nd,Yb, which is similar to or better than the core–shell NaYF4:Yb,Er,Nd@Nd,Yb due to less cross relaxation, is inferior to our newly designed no. 5, i.e. NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y by 12 fold in terms of luminescence intensity at 540 nm upon 793 nm excitation.
The downshifted NIR luminescence emission spectra obtained under 793 nm excitation show that the intensities (i.e. photon counts) at 975 nm (Yb3+, 2F5/2 to 2F7/2) are greater for NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y than for the reference NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y (ESI Fig. 2b; Table S3†). This is most likely because the Yb in the core for the former has a less efficient energy transfer efficiency to Er in the shell as compared to the latter, and results in a greater luminescence intensity, although the variations are not very large. The emission intensity increases with increasing Y shell thickness due to reduced surface quenching. On the other hand, the luminescence intensity at the short-wave infrared (SWIR) 1525 nm (Er3+, 4I13/2 to 4I15/2) is the highest for the UCNPs NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y with a Y shell thickness of 4.8 nm, which is about 10% more than that of NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y with a Y shell thickness of 6.2 nm. The UCNPs with Y shell thicknesses smaller and greater than 4.8 nm both have a lower number of photon counts, again with relatively smaller variations. This phenomenon seems to be consistent with the previously proposed surface quenching-assisted downshifting (SQAD) to increase the energy level population of 4I13/2 that leads to brighter luminescence from this energy level,51 which could be of interest if further optimised for potential future bioimaging applications in the NIR-IIb region with less light scattering.43,44
The surfaces of UCNPs NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y with different protective Y shell thicknesses were further modified with amino-functionalised mesoporous silica (mSiO2) to load the photosensitizer RB and conjugated with polyethylene glycol with folic acid (PEG-FA) for targeted photodynamic cancer cell therapy. The final nanocomposites are termed NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA (or NdYb-CSs-UCNCs) and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA (or YbEr-CSs-UCNCs). The TEM images in Fig. 1(m–r) show that mSiO2 was uniformly coated on the surface of the UCNPs with clearly visible pores. These UCNPs were mono-dispersive with no obvious aggregation in colloidal solutions, as also evidenced by DLS analyses (ESI Fig. S3†). The luminescence emission spectral intensities of all mSiO2 coated UCNPs were lowered by ∼50% when transferred into aqueous solutions;47 however, their trends of photon counts at the 540 nm emission peak were the same as those in hexane solutions.
Irradiation of nanocomposites NdYb-CSs-UCNCs and YbEr-CSs-UCNCs (1 mg mL−1) with different protective Y shell thicknesses using 793 nm NIR laser (0.8 W cm−2) for up to 30 min in the presence of 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABDA) allowed the determination of 1O2 molecule production: the results are shown in Fig. 3. A longer irradiation time produced more 1O2 molecules (Fig. 3a). Most importantly, NdYb-CSs-UCNCs with a 4.8 nm Er–RB distance produced the largest amount of 1O2 molecules (Fig. 3b). This Er–RB distance is actually the thickness of the outermost protective Y shell. The amounts of 1O2 molecules produced by NdYb-CSs-UCNCs with protective Y shell thicknesses smaller and greater than 4.8 nm were both less than those by NdYb-CSs-UCNCs with a 4.8 nm-thick Y outer shell. On the other hand, the amounts of 1O2 molecules produced by the reference YbEr-CSs-UCNCs were the largest for those with a protective Y shell thickness of 2.1 nm (the shortest Er–RB distance calculated from the TEM data was 7.3 nm because Er is in the core), followed by those with 6.2- and 11.3 nm Y shell thicknesses. The trends of 1O2 molecule production observed for NdYb-CSs-UCNCs and YbEr-CSs-UCNCs were different from those of the luminescence of NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y with different protective Y shell thicknesses. The rationale for the above observations is as follows: for both series of UCNPs, maximum luminescence should be observed with minimum surface quenching and Er3+ to Nd3+ energy back transfer. In this study, the conducting Yb shell thickness was the optimised 1.5–2 nm,31 and the overall luminescence increased with increasing outermost Y shell thickness until it reached a limiting value. On the other hand, for 1O2 molecule production, the FRET efficiency decays exponentially with increasing distance between the Er emitter and the RB photosensitizer. In this regard, an optimised 1O2 molecule production could be obtained with a compromised Er–RB distance. The Er–RB distances of the various NdYb-CSs-UCNCs and YbEr-CSs-UCNCs are marked in Fig. 3(b) using the TEM data and the largest 1O2 molecule production was observed for the Er–RB distance of 4.8 nm for the NdYb-CSs-UCNCs with a 4.8 nm protective Y shell thickness. As for the YbEr-CSs-UCNCs, the largest 1O2 molecule production was for the one with a 2.1 nm-thick protective Y shell, which translates into an Er–RB distance of 7.3 nm, which is longer than 4.8 nm and consequently produced relatively less 1O2, but the surface quenching is likely suppressed more. Thus, although the luminescence intensity of NdYb-CSs-UCNCs (4.8 nm-thick Y outer shell) was only 43% of the YbEr-CSs-UCNCs (2.1 nm-thick Y outer shell) before mSiO2 modification, the overall 1O2 molecule production was more than 1.6 times for the former than the latter, which translates to a 3.7-fold increase in the FRET efficiency. Note that two main types of energy transfers from the emitter to the photosensitizer are present,48 one is the short-range FRET within roughly 10 nm of the emitter, and the other is the long-range one not limited by the 10 nm distance. Thus, although some Er–RB distances exceed 10 nm, the photon energy can still be transmitted from Er to RB.

The respective photodynamic cytotoxicities of the nanotheranostic UCNPs NdYb-CSs-UCNCs and YbEr-CSs-UCNCs with 4.8 nm and 6.2 nm-thick Y shells were further tested against MDA-MB-231 cancer cells at different dosages, i.e. 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg mL−1, with and without 793 nm laser irradiation. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The dark cell viability (i.e. without 793 nm irradiation) was still more than 83% at a dose of 200 μg mL−1. On the other hand, the photo-cell viability decreased with increasing UCNC dosage. As expected, the photo-cytotoxicity was better for NdYb-CSs-UCNCs than for YbEr-CSs-UCNCs, which is consistent with the results of 1O2 molecule production.

As stated above, recent research in NIR theranostics (e.g. PDT and imaging) has shifted from 980 nm excitation on the Yb3+ sensitiser to 793–808 nm excitation on the Nd3+ sensitiser to reduce local water absorption and overheating problems, in addition to resolving the tissue penetration issue. Challenges of using the Nd3+ sensitiser, i.e. via Nd3+(λ793 nm) → Yb3+(λ980 nm) → Er3+(λ540, 660, 1525 nm → RB), are more sophisticated than those of using the Yb3+ sensitiser because the problems such as surface quenching, energy back transfer, and FRET efficiency need to be solved simultaneously: these cannot be easily predicted and are of current research interest in the disciplines of medicine, chemistry, and nanotechnology. To our knowledge, our results are more advanced than almost all of the previously reported ones employing Nd3+ ions as the sensitizer21,35,39 In addition, our 793 nm laser with a more practical and safer lower power, i.e. 0.8–1.0 W cm−2, is advantageous for deeper tissue penetration and low local heating effects. Optimisation to reduce surface and concentration quenching and the generation of ROS at lower laser power would be more relevant to medical applications such as PDT, compared with the use of high laser power, e.g. 70–114 W cm−2.40,41 980 nm irradiation is mainly applicable to upconversion PDT but not convenient NIR imaging, while 793 nm irradiation can achieve both PDT and imaging.
Finally, SWIR imaging has gained interest recently; we were able to acquire initial animal NIR and SWIR tumour imaging results using home-made imaging equipment and our newly designed NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA nanocomposites in the presence of a 850 nm longpass (Schott RG-850, 50.8 mm Sq.) filter using the published experimental procedure (Fig. 5).21

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that the newly designed NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA could be optimised for better 1O2 molecule production than that provided by the reference NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA for photodynamic theranostic applications. We placed a Nd3+ sensitiser in the core and an Er3+ emitter in the second shell with an outermost non-emitting protective Y shell to shorten the emitter–photosensitizer distance and reduce the surface quenching effect, respectively, and added an additional conducting Yb shell to reduce Er3+-to-Nd3+ energy back transfer. Simultaneous optimisation was also observed for the Er3+ downshifting emission at 1525 nm, which may be of interest for potential imaging applications in the NIR-IIb region. This unprecedented, simultaneous optimisation would be useful for the design of better-performing photo-nanotheranostic materials with fine tuning of the order of core and various shells, shell thickness and Ln doping concentrations as well as other light-conversion materials for various applications such as guided drug release, targeted molecule activation, molecular cutting, and solar energy conversion.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  New nanocomposite NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA containing the RB and cancer cell-targeting folate group exhibits more singlet oxygen production in photodynamic therapy due to more efficient FRET by shortening the Er–RB distance and greater emission at 1525 nm for potential NIR-IIb imaging under 793 nm light irradiation. The upconversion FRET and downshifting emission efficiencies can be simultaneously optimised by adjusting the Y3+ shell thickness.	 

 	Fig. 1  TEM images of core, core/shell, core/shell/shell, and core/shell/shell/shell UCNPs of both NaYF4:Yb,Nd@Yb@Yb,Er@Y (upper ones, a–f) and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Yb,Nd@Y (middle ones, g–l) and of mSiO2-coated UCNPs with different Y shell thicknesses: NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2—(m) 2.9 nm, (n) 4.8 nm, (o) 11.5 nm; NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y@mSiO2—(p) 2.1 nm, (q) 6.2 nm, and (r) 11.3 nm. Average particle sizes for (a)–(l) were estimated from TEM images and are shown in the bottom of each image. Average particle sizes for (m)–(r) were determined from DLS measurements and are also shown in the bottom of each image.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a, left) Upconversion luminescence spectra of core/shell, core/shell/shell, and core/shell/shell/shell UCNPs of both NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y series nanomaterials with different Y shell thicknesses. Numerical designations of UCNPs are shown in the figure. Inset: Expanded scale for UCNPs designated as 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9. (a, right) Upconversion photon counts of the highest emissive 540 nm peaks of various UCNPs. Inset: Expanded scale for UCNPs designated as 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. (b, Left) Downshifted luminescence spectra of NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y and NaYF4:Yb,Er@Yb@Nd,Yb@Y series nanomaterials with different Y shell thicknesses. (b, Right) Downshifted photon counts of emissive 975 nm and 1525 nm peaks of various UCNPs; 1525 nm photon count values have been multiplied 5 times for better visual comparison. The concentration of each sample was normalised to 10 mM of Nd3+ in hexane, 25 °C. λex = 793 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Singlet oxygen molecule production using 793 nm irradiation (0.8 W cm−2) on NdYb-CSs-UCNCs and YbEr-CSs-UCNCs (1 mg mL−1) with different outermost protective Y shell thicknesses. (a) Effect of irradiation time. (b) Effect of outermost protective Y shell thickness; the Er–RB distance is marked under each UCNC.	 

 	Fig. 4  MDA-MB-231 cancer cell photodynamic cytotoxicity test results for nanotheranostic UCNPs NdYb-CSs-UCNCs and YbEr-CSs-UCNCs with the respective 4.8 nm and 6.2 nm outermost Y-shell thicknesses (0–200 μg mL−1), in the presence and absence of 793 nm laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2 for 30 min).	 

 	Fig. 5  NIR and SWIR tumour imaging results obtained using home-made imaging equipment with intra-tumour injection of the newly designed NaYF4:Nd,Yb@Yb@Yb,Er@Y@mSiO2/RB-PEG-FA nanocomposites in the presence of a 850 nm longpass (Schott RG-850, 50.8 mm Sq.) filter. (a) Ambient light and (b) NIR imaging with a longpass filter; and (c) merged image.
