    , Accepted 31st December 2014First published on 31st December 2014AbstractUltra-small luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) are quite desirable for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. However, it is still a challenge to synthesize ultra-small NPs with high brightness owing to non-radiative energy losses caused by the surface defects as well as from vibrational deactivation ascribed to solvent molecules and ligands absorbed on the NPs. In this paper, we reported a strategy to improve up- and down-conversion luminescence of ultra-small BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs by using multi-layer active-shells (containing Yb3+). Sub-10 nm BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 1–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs were synthesized via a high boiling solvent process through a layer-by-layer strategy. Up- and down-conversion fluorescence spectra of the NPs were recorded and analyzed by using a 980 nm laser diode as the excitation source. In comparison with optical properties of BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs, the intensities of up- (∼545 nm) and down-conversion (∼1530 nm) fluorescence were enhanced by 52 and 9.8 times after coating 5-layer active-shells (BaLuF5:Yb3+) on the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs, respectively. In addition, the intensities of up- and down-conversion fluorescence of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs with multi-layer active-shells were 1.3 and 1.1 times larger than those of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs with a one thick-layer active shell, respectively. These results showed that multi-layer active-shells could be used to not only suppress surface quenching but also transfer the pump light to the core region efficiently through Yb3+ ions inside the active-shells.
1 Introduction
Lanthanide-doped up-conversion (UC) and down-conversion (DC) nanoparticles (NPs) have found numerous applications in many fields, such as solar cells, optical waveguide amplifiers, three-dimensional displays, photo-catalysis, and biomedicine (e.g., bio-labels, bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT)).1–19 Especially, ultra-small (<10 nm) UCNPs are quite desirable for optical waveguide amplification and biomedical applications since they exhibit a good dispersibility in various solvents.20,21,40 However, the luminescence quantum yield of ultra-small NPs is generally low due to nonradiative energy losses caused by the surface defects as well as from vibrational deactivation ascribed to solvent molecules and ligands absorbed on the NPs. To overcome this deficiency, various strategies have been developed to improve the luminescence of ultra-small NPs. One effective strategy is the construction of core–shell architectures, where an inert shell is grown around the luminescent core with similar lattice constants and can preclude surface defects from interacting with lanthanide ions.22–31 NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4 nanoparticles were synthesized by Ren et al., the intensity of UC emission of the core–shell nanoparticles was as much as 16 times brighter than that of the core-only nanoparticles, and the core–shell nanoparticles were used for bioimaging and drug delivery.32 Zhen et al. successfully synthesized LaF3:Er,Yb@LaF3 core–shell nanoparticles with an un-doped shell and the luminescence lifetime of the core–shell nanoparticles was longer than that of the core nanoparticles, then core–shell nanoparticles were used to construct an erbium-doped waveguide amplifier with a relative gain of ∼3.5 dB at 1550 nm.33 Furthermore, an active-core–active-shell approach was proposed to obtain NPs with strong emissions. In this case, an active shell (e.g., containing Yb3+ icons) was grown around the active core and could not only suppress surface quenching but also transfer the pump light to the core region efficiently via the active shell.34–38 Yang et al. obtained BaGdF5:Yb3+,Tm3+@BaGdF5:Yb3+ nanoparticles, and the luminescence intensity of NPs was obviously enhanced after coating with active-shell (containing Yb3+). Then BaGdF5:Yb3+,Tm3+@BaGdF5:Yb3+ nanoparticles were used for the in vitro UC luminescence imaging of HeLa cells.39 Zhai et al. reported a strategy to improve the intensity of the 1.53 μm fluorescence band in BaYF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs with the use of an active-shell (containing Yb3+) and constructed an erbium-doped waveguide amplifier based on BaYF5:Yb3+,Er3+ active-core–active-shell NPs with an enhanced optical gain of ∼6.3 dB.40 Recently, a multi-inert-layer coating method was employed to avoid the uneven shell coating for core–shell NPs,41–43 Zhang et al. reported a reproducible method to grow a hexagonal NaGdF4 shell on NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals with a monolayer control thickness and direct imaging the up-conversion nanocrystal core–shell structure at the subnanometer level.44 They also investigated the dependence of up-converting optical properties on the shell thickness and doping position. The experimental results showed that the optical properties of the obtained core–shell NPs could be improved in up-conversion luminescence efficiency (up to 0.51%), stability (more resistant to quenching by water) and multicolour luminescence emission.45 Very recently, Li et al. reported for the first time that the homogenous doping approach based on the successive layer-by-layer method can greatly improve the efficiency of UCNPs. A quantum yield of as high as 0.89% was realized for the homogeneous doping of NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4 UCNPs.46 Despite recent progress in this field, it is necessary to explore new approaches to achieve ultra-small NPs with improved efficiency for pushing forward the advance of this field.
In this paper, we reported an approach to improve the intensity of UC and DC fluorescence of BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs by using a multi-active-layer coating shell (containing Yb3+). Sub-10 nm BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 0–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs were synthesized via a high boiling solvent process and a layer-by-layer strategy. In comparison with optical properties of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core-only NPs, the intensities of UC (∼545 nm) and DC (∼1530 nm) fluorescence were enhanced by 52 and 9.8 times after coating 5-layer active-shells (BaLuF5:Yb3+) on BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs, respectively. To obtain more meaningful information about the active shells, a thick-layer active shell (BaLuF5:Yb3+) was coated on the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core-only NPs and the resulting core-active thick shell NPs had a similar size to the NPs with 5-layer active shells. The intensities of UC and DC fluorescence of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs with multi-layer active-shells were 1.3 and 1.1 times larger than those of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs with one thick-layer active shell, respectively. The effects of the multi-layer active-shells on UC and DC fluorescence were also discussed.
Note that, here, the BaLuF5 compound was selected as the matrix due to its single crystalline phase. When the multi-layer shells were coated on the BaLuF5 core NPs via a layer-by-layer strategy, the shells could grow epitaxially without any phase transition. Therefore, it was easy to analyze the effects of the multi-active-layer coating shells on the UC and DC properties of NPs.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials and general procedures
Ytterbium nitrate (Yb(NO3)3, 99.99%), lutecium nitrate (Lu(NO3)3, 99.99%) and erbium nitrate (Er(NO3)3, 99.99%) were bought from Beijing Chemicals Reagents, China. Oleic acid (OA) and 1-octadecene (ODE) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Company. Barium stearate was purchased from Stream Chemicals Inc. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), stearic acid (C17H35COOH), and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) with a purity of A.R. were all obtained from Beijing Fine Chemical Company, China. All chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core nanoparticles
0.5 mmol barium stearate and 0.5 mmol pre-prepared rare-earth stearate (0.39 mmol lutecium stearate, 0.1 mmol ytterbium stearate, 0.01 mmol erbium stearate)47 were added to a 100 mL four-necked flask containing 15 mL ODE and 15 mL OA. The solution was heated to 110 °C for 1 h under vacuum to remove any residual air.
Thereafter, the mixture was cooled to room temperature under an argon (Ar) flow. 10 mL of methanol solution containing 3 mmol NH4F (about 111 mg) was added to the four-necked flask, then the system was kept at 50 °C for 30 min to remove methanol. Finally, the temperature was increased to 300 °C as soon as possible and the reactants were heated for 1 h under an Ar flow, and then cooled to room temperature (RT). The NPs were washed and re-dispersed in cyclohexane. These NPs were used as cores to induce a subsequent shell coating.
2.3 Synthesis of multi-shell BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ core–shell nanoparticles
The core–shell BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ nanoparticles were synthesized through a modified high boiling solvent process. 0.5 mmol shell precursors (0.475 mmol lutecium stearate and 0.025 mmol ytterbium stearate) were added to a 100 mL four-necked flask containing 15 mL ODE and 15 mL OA. This mixture was heated to 110 °C for 30 min under an Ar flow to form a clear solution and then cooled down to 60 °C. Subsequently, the core NP cyclohexane solution was added to the system flask under stirring and the mixture was heated to 80 °C for 30 min to remove cyclohexane. 10 mL of methanol solution containing 3 mmol NH4F (about 111 mg) was added to the flask and then the system was kept at 50 °C for 30 min to remove methanol. Finally, the mixture was heated to 300 °C for 1 h under an Ar flow with vigorous stirring. The flask was then cooled to RT. These core–shell NPs with one layer were precipitated, washed, and re-dispersed in cyclohexane. To coat the second layer of the active shell, these as-synthesized core–shell NPs were used as seeds. The same coating process was repeated four times until the original BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs were coated with five layers.
For comparison, we also synthesized BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs with a one thick-layer active shell. The reaction time of shell coating was prolonged for 1.5 h to obtain a thick shell.
2.4 Characterization
The phase of the samples was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Model Rigaku Ru-200b), using a nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) the 2θ angle ranges of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 70°. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) of the samples were obtained using a JEM-2100F electron microscope at 200 kV. Up-conversion spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (1.0 nm for slit resolution and 700 V for PMT voltage), and DC spectra were obtained using a SPEX 1000M spectrometer (2 mm for slit width). All spectra were obtained using a 980 nm continuous laser diode as the excitation source. The temporal properties were studied by using a 953.6 nm Raman shifter laser and an oscillograph. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
We successfully synthesized BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+core nanoparticles via a high boiling solvent process, and the prepared BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 1–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs through an epitaxial growth process. Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+ and BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(X-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ (X = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) NPs with different numbers of shells, respectively. The diffraction peaks coincide well with the literature values (JCPDS no. 46-0039). The diffraction peaks at 26.4°, 30.5°, 43.8°and 51.5°can be ascribed to the (131), (330), (123), and (062) planes. The diffraction peaks of the samples can be indexed to the tetragonal phase BaLuF5, and the NPs are BaLuF5 nanoparticles. To further confirm the composition of the samples, the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) of the BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs was measured and is shown in Fig. S1.† The existence of Ba, Lu, Yb, F and Er elements were clarified by the EDX spectrum of the NPs (Fig. S1†). To characterize the morphology of the samples, TEM images, and high-resolution TEM images were measured. Fig. 2a shows the schematic illustration of BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core nanoparticles and BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 1–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs. Fig. 2b–g are the TEM images of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core nanoparticles and BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 1–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in each image. No obvious aggregation was observed, because there are hydrophobic OA ligands capping on the NPs. And the nanoparticles have a uniform morphology, which likely attributed is to the interaction of their surface surfactants. Histograms of the size distribution of BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core nanoparticles and BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 1–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs are shown in Fig. 2h–m. As we can see from Fig. 2b and h BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core nanoparticles are uniform, roughly spherical and the average size is about ∼6 nm. Fig. 2c–g and i–m show TEM images and the size distribution of NPs fabricated through a layer-by-layer strategy, The size of BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(X-shell, X = 1–5)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs gradually increases from 6 to 10 nm with an increase in the number of layers.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Dependence of the UC and DC properties of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs on the Yb3+ concentration of the shell
It is known that Yb3+ is commonly chosen as a sensitizer for UC materials owing to its large absorption cross-section at 980 nm. In Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped systems (shown in Fig. 3), with the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode, energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ occurs because of the large spectral overlap between the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ and the 4I15/2 → 4I11/2 absorption of Er3+, which results in the population of the 4I11/2 level. Then electrons on the 4I11/2 level relax non-radiatively to the 4I13/2 level and the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition gives the DC emission at 1.53 μm. Furthermore, Yb3+ ions continuously absorb 980 nm photons and transfer the energy to Er3+ to populate high energy levels of Er3+ ions and the transitions from high energy levels to the ground state of Er3+ give various UC emissions. It is clear that DC and UC properties of Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped materials can be affected by the doping concentration of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. In our experiments, we first optimized the doping concentration of Yb3+ or Er3+ ions in BaLuF5 core NPs for obtaining strong DC and UC emissions. The optimized values were 20% and 2%, respectively.40
 Fig. 3  Energy-level diagram of Yb3+ and Er3+, possible up-conversion and down-conversion processes under excitation of a 980 nm laser diode. 
By using BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+ NPs as the core, we prepared BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ active-core–active-shell NPs with varied Yb3+ concentrations in the shell. To make sure of the interaction between Yb3+ in the shell and active ions in the core region, the thickness of the shell was fixed at 0.7 nm for those samples. To clarify the effects of the Yb3+ concentration in the shell on optical properties of NPs, we measured UC, DC emission spectra and enhancement ratio of UC, DC luminescence of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs with varied Yb3+ concentrations in the shell under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode with a fixed power density of 70 W cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4. Three emissions peaked at 525, 545 and 650 nm were observed in the UC emission spectra (shown in Fig. 4a), which were attributed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. One emission peaked at 1530 nm which originated from the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ was observed in the DC emission spectra (shown in Fig. 4c). After coating an inert shell BaLuF5 on the core NPs, the UC and DC emissions were enhanced by 4.9 and 2.5 times compared to that of the core-only NPs owing to the well-known surface passivation effect of the shell, respectively. In the case of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ active-core–active-shell NPs, the intensity of the UC or DC emissions increased monotonically to the corresponding maximum value with an increase in the Yb3+ concentration of the shell from zero to 5 mol%. Furthermore, the intensity of the UC or DC emissions decreased gradually with an increase in the Yb3+ concentration of the shell from 5% to 10%. Thus, the optimum concentration of Yb3+ in the shell was about 5 mol% for the active-core–active-shell NPs. The above results showed that by doping a certain amount (e.g., ∼5 mol%) of Yb3+ ions into the shell, the UC and DC emissions of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ active-core–active-shell NPs were further improved by 3.3 and 1.9 times compared to that of BaLuF5:20 mol%Yb3+, 2 mol%Er3+@BaLuF5 active-core–inert-shell NPs since the Yb3+ ions in the shell could transfer energy from the pump source to the core and make a contribution to the UC and DC emissions. However, if the Yb3+ concentration in the shell was too high (>5 mol%), the Yb3+ ions in the shell would preclude the core region from the excitation of the 980 nm laser diode and also the concentration quenching effect occurred, causing the weakening of the UC and DC emissions.

(a) UC and (c) DC emission spectra of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol%Er3+ NPs (curve A) and BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:X mol% Yb3+ (X = 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10) NPs (curve B–H) under a 980 nm excitation. Intensity enhancement of (b) UC and (d) DC emission depending on the Yb3+ concentrations in the shell. 
In addition, we measured the lifetime of the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ and the 4S3/2 level of Er3+ in BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+(core-only), BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol%Er3+@BaLuF5 (active-core–inert-shell) or BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ (active-core–active-shell) NPs by using a 953.6 nm pulsed laser with a pulse width of 10 ns and a repetition rate of 10 Hz as the excitation source, respectively. The measured data are shown in Fig. 5b and c. Each of the decay curves can be fitted well with a single-exponential function as I = I0exp(−t/τ), where I0 is the initial emission intensity at t = 0 and τ is the lifetime of the monitored level. By growing an inert shell on the core NP, the lifetime of the 4S3/2 or 2F5/2 level was extended from 60.69 μs to 100.59 μs or 24.97 μs to 96.53 μs owing to the reduction of the nonradiative relaxation rate caused by the surface passivation effect. Interestingly, the lifetime of the 4S3/2 and 2F5/2 levels was further increased to 139.66 μs and 143.37 μs by introducing Yb3+ ions into the shell to form the active shell. In this case, there are two factors that contribute to the increase of the lifetime. One is the surface passivation effect. The other originated from Yb3+ ions inside the shell. Since the Yb3+ concentration of the shell was lower than that of the core region, the lifetime of the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ in the shell would be longer than that in the core region.48,49 Therefore, the lifetime of the 2F5/2 level for the BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs was longer than that for the BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5 NPs. Generally, the measured lifetime of the 4S3/2 level of Er3+ in Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped systems pumped at 953.6 nm is related to the lifetime of the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ owing to the existence of energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+. As aforementioned, the lifetime of the 4S3/2 level of Er3+ was further increased to 139.66 μs by introducing Yb3+ ions into the shell to form the active shell. So we concluded that the increase of the lifetime of the 4S3/2 level of Er3+ was caused by the contribution of energy transfer from Yb3+ ions inside the shell to Er3+ ions in the core region. In other words, it was an evidence that energy transfer from Yb3+ ions inside the shell to the core region occurred. Generally, for Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped systems, the longer the lifetime of the 2F5/2 or 4S3/2 level is, the stronger the UC or DC emission becomes. Therefore, the increase of the lifetime of the 4S3/2 or 2F5/2 level might cause the enhancement of the UC or DC emission by growing an active shell on the core NP, which was consistent with the measured UC or DC emission spectra shown in Fig. 5b and c.

3.2 Influence of the number of the active shell layers on the UC and DC properties of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(X-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol%Yb3+ (X = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) NPs
To investigate the influence of the number of shell layers on optical properties of NPs, we synthesized BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(X-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) NPs via the layer-by-layer strategy (shown in Fig. 2) and characterized their UC and DC properties. By increasing the number of active shell layers from 0 to 5, the average size of NPs increased gradually from 6 to 9.5 nm and the uniformity of NPs remained almost unchanged with an increase of the size. The above results indicated that the multi-layer active-shell grew uniformly on the core NPs via the layer-by-layer strategy. Fig. 6a–d show the measured UC, DC emission spectra and enhancement ratio of UC, DC luminescence of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(X-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode with a fixed power density of 70 W cm−2. By increasing the number of the shell layers from 0 to 2, the UC and DC emission increased monotonically and the corresponding rate of increase was 38.25 and 6.81 times per layer, respectively. Interestingly, with a further increase in the number of the shell layers from 2 to 5, the rate of increase for the UC or DC emission reduced to 0.32 or 0.26 times per layer, respectively. The above results showed that multi-layer active-shells could be used to not only suppress surface quenching but also transfer energy from the pump light to the core region efficiently through Yb3+ ions inside the active-shells, causing the enhancement of the UC or DC emission. Especially, since the thickness of each shell layer was about 0.7 nm, one shell layer was not enough for suppressing surface quenching completely. In addition, Yb3+ ions in each shell layer could absorb the pump light and transfer energy to the core region. As a result, the initial increase (0 → 2) of the number of the shell layers caused the obvious improvement of the UC or DC emission. However, by further increasing the number of the shell layers (2 → 5), the suppression effect of surface quenching became weak and the energy transfer from Yb3+ ions in the outer shell layers to the core region became inefficient owing to the enlargement of the distance between them, which made the rate of increase for the UC or DC emission smaller.

Fig. 6e and f show the measured lifetime of the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ and the 4S3/2 level of Er3+ in BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(X-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) NPs by using a 953.6 nm pulsed laser with a pulse width of 10 ns and a repetition rate of 10 Hz as the excitation source. With an increase in the number of the shell layers from 0 to 5, the lifetime of the 4S3/2 and 2F5/2 levels increased from 60.69 μs to 419.95 μs and 24.97 μs to 464.66 μs owing to the suppression of surface quenching and the contribution of Yb3+ ions inside the shell to the lifetime of the 4S3/2 or 2F5/2 level, which agreed well with the tendency toward the dependence of the measured UC and DC emissions on the number of the shell layers (shown in Fig. 6b and d).
Note that, we also synthesized BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(X-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ (X ≥ 6) NPs via the layer-by-layer strategy. Since the size of those NPs was larger than 10 nm, they were out of scope that we were interested in.

Although BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(5-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs give rise to improved UC and DC emissions compared to the BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+ core-only NPs, is it exactly better than BaLuF5:20 mol%Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs with a similar size and shell thickness of 3.5 nm. To clarify this question, we prepared BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs with a similar size and shell thickness (shown in Fig. 7a) to that of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(5-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs. Fig. 7a and b show the TEM image and the size-distribution of the as-prepared sample. The average size was about 9.5 nm, which is similar to that of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(5-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs. However, the uniformity of the as-prepared sample was worse than that of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(5-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs. This result also showed that we could obtain uniform active-core–active-shell NPs by using a layer-by-layer strategy. Fig. 7c shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared sample. The diffraction peaks of the as-prepared sample can be indexed to tetragonal phase BaLuF5. Fig. 8a–d show a comparison of the UC, DC emission spectra and enhancement ratio of UC, DC luminescence of BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@(5-shell)BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs and BaLuF5:20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Er3+@BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ NPs with a similar shell thickness measured by using a 980 nm laser diode with a fixed power density of 70 W cm−2 as the pump source. The UC and DC emissions of the former NPs with multi-layer active-shells were 1.3 and 1.1 times larger than that of the latter NPs with a one thick-layer active shell, respectively. Fig. 8e and f show a comparison of the measured lifetime of the 4S3/2 and 2F5/2 levels of those two samples. The lifetime of the 4S3/2 and 2F5/2 level of the NPs with multi-layer active-shells were 1.47 and 1.49 times longer than that of the NPs with one thick-layer active shell. We considered that, for the NPs with a one thick-layer active shell prepared by the one-step coating method, surface defects of NPs cannot be completely passivated by the one-step shell deposition process. In contrast, during the growth of the BaLuF5:5 mol% Yb3+ shell layer by layer, surface defects of NPs can be gradually passivated by the homogeneous shell deposition process, which results in the obvious enhancement in overall UC or DC emission intensity and lifetime compared to that of the NPs with the one thick-layer active shell.45,46 The above results showed that we could obtain sub-10 nm NPs with good size-uniformity and improved UC or DC fluorescence by using a multi-active-layer coating shell containing Yb3+ ions.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we proposed an approach to improve the intensity of UC and DC fluorescence of ultra-small BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs by using a multi-active-layer coating shell containing Yb3+ ions. Sub-10 nm BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+@(5-shell)BaLuF5:Yb3+ NPs were synthesized via a layer-by-layer strategy. In comparison with optical properties of the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ core-only NPs, the intensities of UC (∼545 nm) and DC (∼1530 nm) fluorescence were enhanced by 52 and 9.8 times after coating 5-layer active-shells (BaLuF5:Yb3+) on the BaLuF5:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs, respectively. Our experimental results showed that multi-layer active-shells could be used to not only suppress surface quenching but also transfer the pump light to the core region efficiently through Yb3+ ions inside the active-shells. Sub-10 nm active-core-multi-active-layer-shell NPs with good uniformity and improved UC or DC fluorescence could be obtained by the homogeneous shell deposition process.
