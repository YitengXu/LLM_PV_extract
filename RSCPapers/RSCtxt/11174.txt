Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate systematically the intrinsic defects in FAPbI3. While methylammonium (MA)-related defects MAI and IMA in MAPbI3 have high formation energies, we found that formamidinium (FA)-related defects VFA, FAI and IFA in FAPbI3 have much lower formation energies. Antisites FAI and IFA create deep levels in the band gap, and they can act as recombination centers and result in reduced carrier lifetimes and low open circuit voltages in FAPbI3-based photovoltaic devices. We further demonstrate that through cation mixing of MA and FA in perovskites the formation of these defects can be substantially suppressed.
Organometallic lead halide perovskites have attracted significant attention due to their outstanding properties as solar cell materials, such as excellent carrier diffusion lengths, strong light absorption, high open-circuit voltages, low electron and hole effective masses, ambipolar charge transport, and solution-processability.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite photovoltaic devices has already exceeded 20%5–9 in just few years since the first deployment by Miyasaka et al.10 in 2009. The bulk of research has focused on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), among the organometallic halide perovskites, owing to its unique photovoltaic properties and rapid improvements in power conversion efficiencies in recent years. MAPbI3 has a bandgap of approximately 1.55 eV, which is slightly beyond the optimal value of 1.35 eV for a single-junction solar cell.11 Moreover, the material is sensitive to degradation due to moisture and high temperatures. It forms hydrated perovskite phases when exposed to moisture.12,13 In addition, it can easily undergo a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic at approximately 55 °C and decompose above 85 °C.14,15 The stability issue has hampered the scaling of technology using these materials.
Recently, FAPbI3 was suggested as an alternative to MAPbI3 and solar cells based on FAPbI3 with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 20.1% have been demonstrated.16 Replacing methylammonium cations (MA) with formamidinium cations (FA), a FAPbI3 perovskite was found to have a smaller bandgap (1.48 eV), which allows better near-infrared absorption, and it has an elevated decomposition temperature and thus higher thermal stability.17–20 Despite these advantages, pure FAPbI3-based solar cells have not achieved better PCEs than their MAPbI3 counterparts.18,25,26 One of the reasons is that the average open-circuit voltage (VOC) of reported FAPbI3 perovskite photovoltaic devices is about 0.90 V, which is lower than that of MAPbI3 devices.21–24 It is well-known that energy loss due to electron–hole recombination is one of the main reasons for the reduction of VOC. The nature of intrinsic defects in absorber materials often plays a decisive role in determining carrier recombination and diffusion lengths in solar cells. Defects that create deep levels can act as nonradiative recombination centers and shorten the carrier lifetime. Technologically, device instabilities can be associated with charge trapping by defect states. To further improve the efficiency of these perovskite-based solar cells and advance the technology for various applications, it is important to understand the properties of intrinsic defects in these perovskite materials. While the experimental characterization of defects is usually difficult and requires an ingenious combination of different techniques, theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of defects provide an effective way to understand defect physics.
Over the past several years, much efforts have been made towards studying the defects in organometallic halide perovskites. Among them, the majority has been focused on the intrinsic defects in MAPbI3.27–34 To our knowledge, there has been no study reported on the properties of intrinsic defects in FAPbI3. In this work, we performed first principles calculations of a series of intrinsic point defects in FAPbI3. The structure and phase behavior of FAPbI3 had been previously studied and there are two possible polymorphs.17,19,26 At low temperatures, a yellow non-perovskite hexagonal phase (δ-phase) of FAPbI3 is crystallized, while at high temperatures a black perovskite phase is formed (α-phase). Among them, the α-phase is the desirable photoactive phase with promising optoelectronic properties. Previous studies showed that the α-phase has a trigonal structure. Recently, a high-resolution neutron powder diffraction study suggested that the α-phase exists as a simple cubic perovskite structure with space group Pmm.35 In our calculations, we have used the plane-wave DFT package VASP.36,37 A structure model of cubic FAPbI3 with space group Pmm is adopted based on the results of previous works.35,38 Electronic wave functions are expanded with plane waves with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. The core–valence interaction is described by the projector-augmented wave method.39 To describe the exchange–correlation energies, the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is employed. The supercell is fully relaxed until all residual forces on atoms are below 0.05 eV Å−1 and the lattice constant is found to be 6.36 Å. The calculated bandgap of FAPbI3 is 1.45 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.48 eV.18,26 In the valence band, strong hybridization of the Pb s and I p states gives rise to an antibonding character of the upper valence band. On the other hand, the conduction band is mainly contributed by the empty Pb p states. The primitive cell of FAPbI3 contains 12 atoms and the defect calculations are based on a (3 × 3 × 3) supercell. A point defect is then introduced into the supercell which corresponds to a defect concentration on the order of 1021 cm−3. The same parameters are used for defect calculations except that the Brillouin zone is sampled only by the Γ point. In general, higher level methods like the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional40 or many-body GW correction41 with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) are preferred for defect calculations. Practically, however, these calculations are computationally very expensive. In addition, there have been reports showing that pure and hybrid DFT predict similar defect Kohn–Sham levels.42,43 In this work, we calculated the charge transition levels of dominant defects using the HSE hybrid functional with SOC and the results are in good agreement with the PBE non-SOC results. Therefore, PBE non-SOC is employed to reduce the computational costs.
The chemical potential window for the thermal equilibrium growth of FAPbI3 is first determined. To avoid the formation of elemental phases, it is required that the chemical potential μFA < 0, μPb < 0 and μI < 0. Second, the chemical potentials of FA, Pb and I should satisfy the relation μFA + μPb + 3μI = ΔH(FAPBI3) = −4.62 eV(1)for the existence of FAPbI3. Here, ΔH(FAPBI3) is the formation energy of FAPbI3 with respect to the elemental solids of Pb in the cubic phase and I2 in the orthorhombic phase. For organic group FA, a body-centered-cubic phase is chosen. Finally, to avoid the formation of competing secondary phases including FAI (cubic phase) and PbI2 (trigonal phase), the following conditions must also be satisfied: μFA + μI < ΔH(FAI) = −2.51 eV(2) μPb + 2μI < ΔH(PbI2) = −2.04 eV(3)Under these constraints, the allowed chemical potential region in which FAPbI3 is thermodynamically more stable than the two secondary phases is considerably confined in a polyhedron, as shown in Fig. 1. This is mainly due to the small formation enthalpy of FAPbI3 from FAI and PbI2. Our results show that the chemical potential window is long and narrow, implying that flexible growth conditions can be chosen but the proportion of FAI and PbI2 sources should be carefully controlled for the stable formation of FAPbI3 perovskites.
 Fig. 1  Plot showing the allowed chemical potential region for the thermal equilibrium growth of FAPbI3, marked in red. Three different conditions, I-rich (μFA = −2.51 eV, μPb = −2.11 eV, μI = 0 eV), Pb-rich (μFA = −1.46 eV, μPb = 0 eV, μI = −1.06 eV) and moderate (μFA = −2.01 eV, μPb = −1.02 eV, μI = −0.53 eV), are chosen for defect formation studies. 
The formation energy of point defects is determined by the chemical potentials of the constituent elements and the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs, and thus depends on the growth conditions. For a defect α with charge-state q, its formation energy ΔH(α,q) is given by44 (4)where E(α,q) and Ehost are the total energies without thermal corrections of the system with defect α and the host material without defect, respectively. The variables ni and μi are the number of elements i removed from the system in forming the defect and the corresponding chemical potential, respectively. The last term in eqn (4) corresponds to the energy change due to the charge transfer to the reservoir. For a negatively charged defect, electrons are transferred from the environment to the defect. Thus, the formation energy for a charged defect depends on the Fermi energy of the electron reservoir. EF is the Fermi energy measured from the valence band maximum (VBM) and EVBM is the VBM energy. To avoid spurious interactions of charged defects between supercells, a correction term ΔV is added to align the potential in the defect supercell with the bulk potential.45q is the number of electrons transferred from the system to the reservoir in forming the defect. The defect charge transition energy level ε(q/q′) corresponds to the position of EF at which the formation energies of defect α at different charge-states q and q′ are the same (ΔH(α,q) = ΔH(α,q′)): ε(q/q′) = [E(α,q) − E(α,q′) + (q − q′)(EVBM + ΔV)]/(q − q′).(5)Table 1 shows the formation energies in the neutral charge-state of all the possible point defects including interstitials (FAi, Pbi, Ii), vacancies (VFA, VPb, VI) and antisites (FAPb, PbFA, FAI, PbI, IFA, IPb). Three growth conditions are chosen for the study of defect formation energies, as marked in Fig. 1, two of which correspond to growth environments where μI and μPb are close to pure I2 (I-rich) and metal Pb (Pb-rich), respectively. A middle point is also chosen which corresponds to moderate growth conditions. Our results show that FA-related intrinsic defects have low formation energies. This can be partly explained by the weak van der Waals interactions between FA cations and PbI6 octahedra. It is known that the organic cations in perovskites make no contribution to the electronic states around the band edges, but only stabilize the perovskite structures. Under I-rich conditions, acceptor defects VFA and IFA have low formation energies, indicating the tendency to lose FA cations. Interstitial defect Ii also has low formation energies due to the formation of covalent I dimers.28 As the growth environment shifts from the I-rich to Pb-rich conditions, the formation energies of acceptor defects increase, and donor defects become dominant defects. Similarly, FA-related defect FAI has the lowest formation energies, under the Pb-rich conditions. The formation of these defects can be controlled by changing the growth conditions. As shown in Table 1, the formation of most intrinsic defects is suppressed under moderate growth conditions. We have further investigated the effects of the electrochemical potential on the formation of these intrinsic defects. The calculated formation energies as a function of EF under different growth conditions are plotted in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Under I-rich conditions, charged defect VFA+ is dominant when the host material is p-type (EF < 0.5 eV). When switching to more electron-rich conditions (EF > 0.5 eV), however, the +2 charge-state of vacancy defect VPb is significantly stabilized and becomes the dominant defect. On the other hand, under Pb-rich conditions, donor FAI is the most stable defect in a hole-rich environment, whereas acceptor defect VFA becomes dominant when the host material is n-type.

 Fig. 2  The formation energies of intrinsic point defects under (a) I-rich and (b) Pb-rich conditions. Defects with much high formation energies are displayed as dashed lines. 
Apart from the formation energies of the intrinsic defects, the photovoltaic properties of perovskites are also determined by the charge-state transition levels. The transition level of a defect is defined as the Fermi level where the defect state can donate or accept electrons. Hence, defects with deep transition levels in the band gap can act as Shockley–Read–Hall recombination centers. In addition, the scattering effect of charged defects will affect carrier migration and reduce the conductivity. Both effects have a major impact on the device performance. The calculated transition levels for all the studied defects in FAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 3(a). For acceptor defects, in general, the defects with low formation energies do not create deep levels. For instance, vacancy defects VFA and VPb have charge transition energies deep in the valence band and interstitial defect Ii creates only a shallow transition level of 0.03 eV above the VBM. Though IFA creates a deep transition level of 0.20 eV above the VBM, its comparatively high formation energy prevents it from being an effective recombination center. In contrast, donor defect FAI is stabilized in the hole-rich environment and creates a deep transition level in the band gap. These deep-level defects can attract holes and strongly affect the non-equilibrium carrier lifetime, which should be avoided for photovoltaic applications. In order to prevent the deep-level antisites FAI from being recombination centers, it is suggested that the material should be grown in an I-rich environment and the electrochemical potential should be controlled in the n-doped region. For other donor defects, FAi, PbFA and VI create only shallow transition levels. Pbi and PbI both create deep transition levels, but their high formation energies imply a low defect concentration under thermal equilibrium conditions, and Pbi and PbI are not likely to be non-radiative recombination centers.
 Fig. 3  The charge transition energy levels of intrinsic defects (a) in FAPbI3 and (b) in the mixed-cation FA0.52MA0.48PbI3 perovskite. 
Composition engineering by organic cation mixing in organometallic lead halide perovskites has been put forward as a potential solution to further enhance their performance and stability.46,47 Therefore, apart from growth conditions, it is also interesting to know the effect of cation mixing on defect properties in these perovskite materials. Here, we construct a mixed cation FA0.52MA0.48PbI3 perovskite model by replacing FA cations with MA cations in the (3 × 3 × 3) supercell in an alternate pattern. Two antisite defects with deep transition levels (IFA and FAI) are introduced and all atomic positions are then fully relaxed. The transition levels of the two defects are shown in Fig. 3(b). While the charge transition level of the FAI defect becomes slightly shallower, the IFA defect in mixed cation perovskites creates an even deeper acceptor level, indicating that organic cation mixing in perovskites may increase the non-radiative recombination rate. We further calculate their formation energies, and remarkably, their neutral charge-state formation energies are significantly increased compared to those of their counterparts in FAPbI3. Thus, despite its deep nature, acceptor IFA does not likely affect the photovoltaic performance due to its high formation energy. The formation energies for antisite IFA are 2.05, 3.08 and 4.26 eV under I-rich, moderate and Pb-rich conditions, respectively, and the formation energies for defect FAI are 3.31, 2.28 and 1.10 eV under I-rich, moderate and Pb-rich conditions, respectively. Interestingly, for all defects we have studied, the formation energies are increased upon organic cation mixing. Our preliminary results show that the formation of intrinsic defects can be suppressed in mixed cation perovskites. An extensive study of the defect properties in mixed cation perovskites will be reported elsewhere.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the defect properties of a FAPbI3 perovskite solar cell have been systematically studied using first-principles calculations. It is found that FA-related defects have low formation energies and antisites FAI and IFA create deep levels in the band gap. These defects can act as non-radiative recombination centers and reduce the non-equilibrium carrier lifetime, which partly explains the lower open circuit voltage in FAPbI3-based photovoltaic devices. To avoid the formation of FAI defects, a material should be grown in an I-rich environment and the electrochemical potential should be controlled in the n-doped region. In addition, it is found that the formation energies of deep-level defects increase substantially through organic cation mixing, which is expected to reduce the recombination rate. Our results suggest that both growth condition control and composition engineering can effectively suppress the formation of non-radiative recombination centers in organometallic halide perovskites and would be an important strategy to improve the efficiency of perovskite-based photovoltaic devices.
