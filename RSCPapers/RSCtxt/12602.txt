The subtle structural differences between BDT-O and BDT-T lead to distinct aggregation abilities: with respect to the over-strong aggregation ability of the BDT-O bridged dimer 2, the BDT-T bridged dimer 1 shows largely reduced aggregation ability and is solution-processable in the commonly used organic solvent. The highly twisted conformation between the PDI–BDT–PDI planes produced steric-pairing effects, which directed ordered packing of dimer 1. When dimer 1 was blended with P3HT in a weight D/A ratio of 1:2.5, the electron mobility (μe) was 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the best PCE was 1.72%. Slowing the solvent evaporation speed benefited the packing order of the PDI dimer, and the μe value was slightly increased to 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The best PCE was improved up to 1.87%. The μe was further increased up to 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the D/A ratio was decreased down to 1:2.2 and the best PCE of 1.95% was achieved. Solid absorption spectra and XRD data of the blended films supported the improvement of the packing order of the PDI dimer by slowing the solvent annealing speed. AFM images supported the largely reduced aggregation ability of dimer 1 when blended with P3HT. The observed phase size of 35 nm is formed under the slow solvent annealing speed and a D/A ratio of 1:2.2. Our results revealed that the amphiphilic nature of the bridged aromatic unit reduces the aggregation ability and facilitates the ordered packing of the PDI units, contributing to the improvement of efficiency.1 IntroductionIn the past decade, solution-processed conjugate polymer based and small molecule based electron-donor materials have seen rapid advance and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is now approaching 7–9% for polymer solar cells (PSCs),1,2 and 5–7% for small-molecule solar cells (SM-SCs),3 among which the commonly used acceptor material is the solution-processed fullerene derivative of [6,6]-phenyl-C61 (or C71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM).4 The fullerene backbone is difficult to be chemically modified, which severely limits the fine-tuning of the optical and electrochemical properties such as the absorptivity in the visible and near IR regions and the energy levels of highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs). In contrast, the impurity severely limits the PCEs of the PCBM based solar cells and it needs special equipment like HPLC to produce high quality PCBM, which then limits the cost of PCBM and also the practical applications.4d In a striking contrast, organic molecules can be easily chemically modified and produced in a large scale and at low cost; and their absorption spectrum, absorptivity and the energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO may be fine-tuned in a relatively wider range than those of PCBM derivatives. To this end, solution-processed non-fullerene small-molecules have been sought for decades.5 However, they are still being advanced slowly with a low efficiency, for example, the derivatives based on the backbones of fluoranthene-fused imide (1.85%),6a benzothiadiazole/imide (2.54%),6b benzothiadiazole/malononitrile (0.73%),6c di-cyan quinacridone (1.57%),6d pentacene (1.27%),6e naphthalene diimide (1.50%),6f and 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (∼2.0%).6gThe effective photon-to-electron conversion is not only determined by the molecular optical and electrochemical properties such as the absorptivity and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO, but also it is largely determined by the nanostructures and interfaces formed in the blended film of the donor and acceptor materials, for example, the aggregate domain size, molecular packing order and π–π stacking order, because the absorptivity of the blended solid-state film, the exciton diffusion efficiency, the exciton separation efficiency, and the electron/hole transporting efficiency are all largely determined by these nanostructural factors.7Perylene diimides (PDIs) have excellent optical and electrochemical properties such as strong light-harvesting ability, promising electron-accepting ability and excellent electron-transporting ability.8–10 However, they possess over-strong aggregation ability, leading to formation of large aggregate domains in the blended films with the domain size (normally, over 100 nm) largely beyond the efficient exciton diffusion length (typically, 20–30 nm). Therefore, the excitons are strongly trapped within the aggregate domains, resulting in low PCEs, only reaching ∼2.0%.11 Reducing the over-strong aggregation ability is thus a key way to improve the efficiency of the PDI based small molecules: when the aggregation ability is effectively reduced, molecules form into small aggregate domains. On the one hand, the excitons generated by the strong absorption of the PDI chromophores may effectively diffuse to the donor–acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and on the other hand, the small aggregate domains generate large D/A interfaces, which enhances the exciton separation efficiency. Both of them cooperatively enhance the photon-to-electron conversion.To achieve this goal, we have recently introduced a series of ‘amphiphilic plus twisting’ PDI dimers, so-called Bis-PDI-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, which gave the best PCE of 1.54% when blended with P3HT.12 In these dimers, the twisting conformations were carried out by using a thienyl unit to covalently bridge two PDI units via the 7,7′-positions, while the amphiphilic nature was achieved by linking the weakly solvophobic 2-methoxylethoxyl (EG) groups at the 1,1′- and 12,12′-positions of the dimeric backbone. From these dimers, we have found that the molecular solvophobicity, that generated by the EG groups at the bay-region, plays a vital role in the photovoltaic properties of the PDI dimer/P3HT devices.To further investigate the effect of the bridged π-aromatic unit on the over-strong aggregation ability of the PDI derivatives, we herein selected a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit13 to covalently bridge two PDI units through the 7,7′-positions, affording another twisted dimeric PDI backbone, and then functioning the dimeric backbone with the EG groups at the 1,1′-positions forms the amphiphilic PDI dimers of Bis-PDI-BDT-EG 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A). We found that the subtle structural difference from the bridged BDT units also determined the aggregation ability; the BDT-O bridged dimer 2 showed limited solubility and over-strong aggregation ability, while the BDT-T bridged dimer 1 was solution-processed and showed significantly reduced aggregation ability. When blended with P3HT in a D/A weight ratio of 1:2.5, dimer 1 gave the best PCE of 1.72% with FF = 53%. Slowing the solvent evaporation speed improved the packing order of the highly twisted dimer 1 and the best PCE was enhanced to 1.87%. The best PCE was further improved up to 1.95% with Jsc = 5.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, and FF = 49% by decreasing the D/A ratio down to 1:2.2.

Both of them exhibited good thermal stability. The temperatures representing 5% weight loss under an inert atmosphere were 419 °C and 418 °C (Fig. S1†). Fig. 2  Synthetic route for Bis-PDI-BDT-EG 1 and 2. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, and S2,† both dimers have nearly identical optimal conformations — the dihedral angles between the PDI–BDT–PDI planes are of ∼50° within the calculated deviations. This highly twisted conformation between the PDI–BDT–PDI planes is expected to provide the so-called steric-pairing effects to direct ordered packing of the dimeric molecules, which may be enhanced by the strong π–π stacking forces from the PDI and BDT units and the solvophobic–solvophilic interactions from the EG and EH side chains (Fig. 1B and D), as observed from the self-assembly of the PDI derivatives15 and the amphiphiles.16 The subtle differences appear only on the bridged BDT unit, e.g. 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy) BDT (BDT-O) vs. 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl)) BDT (BDT-T): for dimer 1, the dihedral angles between the 4- (or 8-) substituted solvophilic thienyl units and the BDT plane are of 50–60°, while for dimer 2 the weakly solvophobic ether-oxygen in BDT-O is coplanar with the BDT plane (Fig. 1A and S2†).Owing to these subtle structural differences, dimers 1 and 2 show significantly different solubility, solution-processability and aggregation ability. Dimer 2 shows over-strong aggregation ability, severely limited solubility (<1 mg ml−1) and very poor solution-processability using the common organic solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and toluene, whereas 1 is soluble (>20 mg mL−1) and solution-processed, and particularly, exhibits largely reduced aggregation ability when blended with the electron-donor material, for example, P3HT (vide post). This means that the twisted conformation of the dimeric backbone is not enough, but the solvophilic and twisted 4,8-bis-substituted thienyl units at the bridged BDT unit also impact significantly on the reduction of aggregation ability and further improvement of the solution-processability.The difference of the aggregation ability between dimers 1 and 2 is further confirmed by the X-ray diffractions (XRD) of the pure films of these two dimers (Fig. S3†). Dimer 2 possesses strong aggregation ability and its film displays a series of diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of 1–30°, indicating the crystalline packing of dimer 2 in the solid-film. The peaks located at 2θ = 4.64°, 7.88°, 11.86°, 21.13° and 26.32° correspond to the d-spacings of 1.90 nm, 1.12 nm, 0.75 nm, 0.42 nm and 0.34 nm, respectively. The 0.34 nm diffraction is assigned to the π–π stacking distance between the aromatic units, while the 1.90 nm peak is assigned to the ordered packing along the PDI–BDT–PDI backbone direction (Fig. S3†). Because of the highly twisted conformation of the dimeric backbone, the diffraction along the N–N direction is relatively weakened, likely appearing around 1.12 nm. In contrast, dimer 1 has largely reduced aggregation ability and its film only displays two diffraction bands, one is broad, locating at 1.80 nm, the other one is at 1.47 nm. No peak related to the π–π stacking is observed.As shown in Fig. 3A, both dimers show very similar optical properties in solution, possessing a broad absorption band from 440 to 750 nm. The maximum molar extinction coefficients (εmax) are nearly the same, being 64.3 × 103 and 71.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for dimers 1 and 2, respectively. In the solid film, dimer 1 exhibits an absorption spectrum very close to that of the DCM solution, but with the 566 nm peak weakened as a shoulder and the 534 nm peak increasing relatively (Fig. 3B). These spectral changes reveal that the dimeric PDI backbones form co-facial π–π stacking (similar to the H-aggregates) in the film.8,9 In contrast, the film of dimer 2 shows a much broader absorption with respect to that of the solution, suggesting that much stronger aggregation takes place. Also, the film absorption of dimer 2 is much broader than that of dimer 1 (Fig. 3B), consistent with the greater co-planarity of the BDT-O and stronger dipolar interactions between the BDT-O units, compared to BDT-T.13 Fig. 3  Normalized solution (A) and solid-film (B) absorption spectra of 1 and P3HT in DCM (c = 1 × 10−6 M) and on the quartz substrates from drop-cast of the chloroform solutions of 1 and 2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S4†) studies indicated that both dimers show nearly identical energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO, being −5.48 eV and −3.85 eV (Table 1), respectively. The electrochemical band gap was calculated to be 1.64 eV for both 1 and 2. By using the same equipment and conditions, the HOMO energy level of P3HT was measured to be −4.94 eV and its LUMO energy level was then estimated from a band gap of 2.0 eV. Both HOMO and LUMO of P3HT were higher than those of the dimers, and the difference between the HOMO energy levels of the PDI dimer and P3HT was 0.54 eV and that between the LUMO energy levels of the PDI dimer and P3HT was 0.91 eV, both ensuring efficient exciton dissociation at the D/A interfaces.

The devices were fabricated using the conventional structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystylenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:1/Ca/Al.

Optimizations by changing the donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio revealed that the D/A ratio of 1:2.5 yielded the best results with an average PCE of 1.66% (Table S1†). The best PCE is 1.72% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.88 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.67 V, and an FF of 53.0%, respectively (Table 2). In contrast, dimer 2 shows a poor photon-to-electron conversion, only with a low PCE of 0.03% (Fig. S5†) when blended with P3HT due to its strong aggregation and severely limited solution-processability.Solvent annealing conditions have been widely used to significantly improve the molecular packing order and thus device performances of fullerene-based OSCs. Because of the highly twisted conformations of 1, we tried to slow the solvent evaporation speed to further improve the ordered packing of the acceptor molecules (Fig. 1B and D). Experimentally, we first placed the spin-coated active layer in a Petri dish covered with a lid for 20 minutes, and then allowed it to dry completely with the lid open for another 1 h (hereafter these conditions were named as “slow-speed” for distinguishing it from the former one, “regular-speed”). As shown in Table 2, under the same D/A ratio of 1:2.5, we found that the device performances were improved obviously when the slow-speed conditions were applied: the Jsc was increased up to 5.48 mA cm−2, the Voc was raised to 0.69 V and the best PCE was improved up to 1.87% as a result. This value is improved by 8.7% compared to the value (1.72%) of the best devices fabricated under the regular-speed conditions. We noted that all the best devices were well-reproduced and the maximum deviation from 10 devices was below 5% (Table 2).Considering that the D/A ratio would affect the efficiency, we then further optimized the D/A ratio under the slow-speed conditions (Table 2 and S1†). The best results were obtained to be D/A = 1:2.2 and the average and best PCEs reached 1.87% and 1.95%, respectively. On account of the very close Voc and FF, improvement of the efficiency is mainly from the increase of Jsc.Improvement of the Jsc is supported by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) responses (Fig. 5), in which the slow-speed conditions yield an increase of the EQE response compared to the regular-speed conditions. The maximum monochromic EQE was increased from 34% to 36% at 560 nm to be D/A = 1:2.5. After further optimizing the D/A ratio to 1:2.2, the maximum value reached 38% at 572 nm. All the EQE spectra were well consistent with the absorbance spectra of the blend films. All of them showed a broad band extending from 350 to 700 nm, indicating the contributions from both the donor and acceptor materials. Fig. 5  EQE responses of the champion devices fabricated under different conditions. To investigate the reasons for the improvement of Jsc, both the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the BHJ blended films were measured using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:1/Au (hole-only) and ITO/TIPD/P3HT:1/Al (electron-only),18 respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, when using the slow-speed conditions (D/A = 1:2.5), the dark current of the hole-only device becomes smaller, while the dark current of the electron-only device becomes larger. The measured electron mobility, μe, is 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the hole mobility, μh, is 5.0 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1 under the regular-speed conditions (Fig. S6 and S7†). When using the slow-speed conditions, the μe is raised up to 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the μh value is decreased down to 4.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S6 and S7†). This result indicates that the increase of electron-transporting ability instead of the hole-transporting ability is a factor causing higher efficiency. Fig. 6  Dark current measured as the D/A = 1:2.5 using the SCLC method with (A) hole-only and (B) electron-only devices, respectively. Fine-tuning the D/A ratio of 1:2.5, 1:2.2 and 1:2.0 under the slow-speed conditions, the hole mobilities are all on the order of 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2), while the electron mobility differs with the varying D/A ratio, and it reaches 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2) as D/A = 1:2.2, at this D/A ratio the best PCE of 1.95% is achieved.2.3 Molecular packing of dimer 1To get insights into the molecular packing of dimer 1 in the blended films, we performed the solid-state absorption spectra of the blended films prepared under the same conditions as those for the OSC devices. As shown in Fig. 3B, the pristine film of dimer 1 shows another two absorption bands in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 420 nm, in addition to the 420–700 nm absorption band and the absorbance of the former two bands (300–420 nm) is comparable to that of the latter one absorption band (420–700 nm). The pure P3HT film shows a broad absorption band from 350 nm to 650 nm. Accordingly, the 300–420 nm absorption band that appeared in the blended films (Fig. 7) is obviously contributed from the acceptor material of Bis-PDI-BDT-EG and the 420–700 nm absorption band is a combination of the absorption from both the PDI dimer and P3HT. Because the PDI dimer cannot form a film by the spin-coating method from the o-DCB solution, it is difficult to tell the contributions of the donor and acceptor materials to the 420–700 nm absorption band. Meanwhile, the relative low absorbance of the 300–420 nm absorption bands with respect to that of the 420–700 nm band suggests that the molar absorbance of the PDI dimer is much lower than that of P3HT in the wavelength region of 420–700 nm. This is further supported by the absorption spectra of the pure PDI dimer film and the pure P3HT film, both were prepared from the chloroform solutions, in which the P3HT film shows stronger absorbance than the PDI dimer film (Fig. S8A†). Fig. 7  The normalized absorption spectra of the P3HT:1 blended films prepared under the same conditions for fabrication of the best OSC devices: (magenta) D/A = 1/2.5 (w/w), regular-speed; (blue) D/A = 1/2.5 (w/w), slow-speed; (red) D/A = 1/2.2 (w/w), slow-speed; and (black) D/A = 1/2.0 (w/w), slow-speed. From Fig. 3A and B, as dimer 1 forms co-facial π–π stacking in the solid film, the absorbance at 534 nm is relatively stronger than that at 566 nm.8,9 As a result, the λamax of dimer 1 appears at 534 nm, being blue-shifted by 24 nm, with respect to that of the pristine P3HT film (Table 1). Accordingly, when the dimeric PDI backbones pack more ordered with more molecules packed into co-facial π–π stacking, for example, achieved under the slow-speed conditions, the absorption band of the blended film should be blue-shifted. The tested absorption spectra (Fig. 7) prove this: with respect to the regular-speed film, the slow-speed film (all with D/A = 1:2.5, w/w) shows a broader absorption band with a larger fwhm value (192 nm vs. 172 nm), and the λamax is blue-shifted by 17 nm (531 nm vs. 548 nm), strongly supporting the fact that the slow-speed conditions produce more ordered packing of the dimeric molecules and more PDI units are formed into ordered co-facial π–π stacking.Under the slow-speed conditions, a change of the D/A ratio, for example, from 1:2.5 to 1:2.0 causes no obvious changes in the absorption spectra (Fig. 7). This is because of the fact that (1) varying the D/A ratio does not significantly change π–π stacking of the PDI dimer and (2) the absorption of the PDI dimer film in the wavelength region of 420 nm and 700 nm is much weaker than that of the P3HT film.Taken together, the solid film absorption spectra in Fig. 7 demonstrate that (1) the packing order and the π–π stacking are not influenced by the D/A ratio because of the efficient phase separation between the donor and acceptor materials, and (2) increasing the electron mobility rather than broadening the absorption is the crucial factor determining the final PCE.To get deeper insights into the molecular packing of dimer 1 in the blended films, we collected the XRD patterns of the blended films prepared under the same conditions as those for the OSC devices. Improvement of the molecular packing order is further proved by the XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 8, under the regular-speed conditions (D/A = 1:2.5), the blended film only exhibits one diffraction band peaking at 1.61 nm, which is mainly contributed from the ordered packing of P3HT, whereas both of the diffractions corresponding to the PDI dimer appear as shoulders (Fig. 8A). Under the slow-speed conditions, the diffraction peak from the ordered packing of P3HT (1.63 nm) weakens as a shoulder, while the diffraction from the ordered packing of the PDI dimer is strengthened relatively as a new peak at 1.49 nm (Fig. 8B and S9†), clearly suggesting that slow-speed conditions obviously improve the packing order of the highly twisted dimer 1 in the blended films, yielding an improved electron-mobility and leading to a higher Jsc. Fig. 8  XRD patterns of the pristine P3HT (black) and 1 (blue) films and the blended P3HT:1 film with D/A = 1:2.5 (red) prepared under regular-speed (A) and slow-speed (B) conditions, respectively. 2.4 Film-morphologyTapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to probe the film-morphologies of the blended films. In both the height and phase images obtained from the blended P3HT:1 film with different D/A ratios (Fig. S10†), the bright phase size decreases as the weight percentage of P3HT decreases, suggesting that the bright phases are most likely contributed from the electron donor material (P3HT), and accordingly, the dark phases are mainly contributed from the electron acceptor material.From the representative phase and height images of the corresponding best devices (Fig. 9 and S11†), two obvious phases are observed from the regular-speed film. The bright phase size is obviously larger than that of the dark phase, both in the range of 30 nm–100 nm. For the slow-speed film, the bright phase size is obviously reduced down to about 12 nm–60 nm, while the dark phases become interpenetrated with each other, affording a higher electron mobility (6.0 × 10−5vs. 3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) but a lower hole mobility (4.2 × 10−2vs. 5.0 × 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1). As shown in Fig. 9C, when the D/A ratio is decreased from 1:2.5 to 1:2.2, both the bright and dark phases become more regular with a similar average phase size of about 35 nm, facilitating a balanced electron and hole transport with μe and μh being 3.4 × 10−4 and 7.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Fig. 9  Tapping-mode AFM phase images of the champion P3HT:1 based devices prepared under different conditions: (A) D/A = 1/2.5 (w/w), regular-speed; (B) D/A = 1/2.5 (w/w), slow-speed; and (C) D/A = 1/2.2 (w/w), slow-speed. ConclusionsWe have showed herein that solvophilicity plus twisting conformation, particularly, from the bridged aromatic unit of the solvophilic and conformation-twisted 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl)) benzodithiophene (BDT-T) and coplanar 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy) BDT (BDT-O), play a crucial role in impacting highly efficient non-fullerene PDI dimers: with respect to the over-strong aggregation ability of the BDT-O bridged PDI dimer 2, the BDT-T bridged PDI dimer 1 shows largely reduced aggregation ability and excellent solution-processability when blended with the solvophilic electron donor material (P3HT). Dimer 1 gave the best PCE of 1.72% with FF = 53% in a weight ratio of P3HT/dimer 1 = 1:2.5. Slowing the solvent evaporation speed improved the packing order of the highly twisted dimer 1 and the best PCE was enhanced to 1.87%. The best PCE was further improved up to 1.95% with Jsc = 5.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, and FF = 49% by decreasing the D/A ratio down to 1:2.2. Our results provide new insights into the molecular structural elements, e.g. solvophilicity versus twisting conformation, both from the dimeric PDI backbone and the bridged aromatic unit, on the improvement of the non-fullerene OSC devices, which will be useful for further design of highly efficient non-fullerene small molecules.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by NSFC (no. 20973082, 91227112 and 21221002), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, project 973 (2011CB808400).Notes and references
