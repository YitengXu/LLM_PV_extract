While nanostructured semiconducting materials have been widely investigated in a variety of applications, colloidal metal halide perovskite nanocrystals are distinguished as a family of versatile and attractive building blocks in optoelectronic applications owing to their high photoluminescence quantum yields, wieldy tunability of optical properties, and sterling size-dispersion and shape-uniformity.

1. Introduction
The preeminence of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) in solar cells over conventional polycrystalline silicon and thin film photovoltaics has introduced a leading-edge research direction. The unparalleled optoelectronic properties of MHPs, including the high absorption coefficients, the small effective masses for electrons and holes, the long photogenerated carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes, and the defect-tolerant feature, impart exceptional performance to photovoltaic (PV) devices based on MHPs.1–6 Taken together with the easy synthesis of MHPs and the compatibility with the low-temperature film preparation procedure from solution, the MHP-based PV devices have revolutionized the domain of flexible solar cells with spectacular achievements and have been considered as the leading contender for a bright future in solar energy.7,8 The recent surge in the number of publications and conference presentations on MHP-based PV devices has made delving into MHP-based solar cells appealing for not only the academic communities but also for industrial corporations. The performance of MHPs in photovoltaic applications has outpaced that of other inventive techniques based on solution-processable materials that have emerged in the last two decades. A new chapter in the long and illustrious history of solar cells has been launched with breakout accomplishments in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of MHP-based solution-processed PV devices. The fundamental properties of MHPs and advanced attainments of PV devices based on MHP have also sparked enthusiasm in implementing MHPs in a broad class of applications involving field-effect transistors, lasers, and bright-emitting sources.9–11
PV devices based on MHPs hold advantages over organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in terms of the simplicity of their processing and the extensive accessibility of their chemical components. Meantime, the conversion of MHP materials into thin films can be realized by adopting roll-to-roll approaches through both solution and vacuum-based techniques.12–14 In this scenario, it is expected that MHP PVs can generate electricity at a considerably low cost. The challenges that exist for technologies that hold promise for superb photovoltaic performance and sustainable growth include introduction of new MPH candidates, novel preparation routes for materials, and innovative film deposition techniques.
Nanostructured semiconductors have the potential to reform the traditional technologies and the research on semiconducting nanomaterials has instigated exhilarating inventions in diverse fields such as catalysis, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and drug delivery, to name a few. The construction of nanostructured materials through the colloidal approach is superior in producing nanocrystals (NCs) with well-controlled composition and size along with superb size-distribution, and this technique has been validated to be applicable to several materials.15–20 Preparing colloidal MHP NCs has become a research forefront on account of their remarkable high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields approaching about 100% and the tunability of their optical band gap over the entire visible spectral range by manipulation of the composition, size and/or dimensionality of the MHP NCs.21–23 Correspondingly, the tunability of the MHP NC compositions can be attained after synthesis through subsequent anion-exchange, which is less demanding than that of many conventional II–VI NCs. Colloidal MHP NCs have also been acknowledged as exceptional materials in optoelectronic applications in view of their unique optoelectronic properties such as high charge carrier mobility and long carrier diffusion length. The high mobilities and long diffusion lengths of the carriers can lead to high losses in device performance in view of the increased recombination of the charge carriers and/or build-up of space charges. Moreover, the self-organization ability of colloidal NCs into highly ordered nano-/microstructures has been demonstrated for multitudinous MHP materials, indicating that the accomplishment of large-scale integrated functional devices based on colloidal MHP NCs is facile through judicious operations. The applications of colloidal MHP NCs in photovoltaics, light-emitting devices, and photodetectors have been demonstrated.24–26 To pinpoint the strategies aimed at developing PV devices based on colloidal MHP NCs with excellent performance, synthesizing colloidal MHP NCs with high crystal quality is imperative. The challenge of stability of MHP materials encumbering the development of photovoltaics based on MHP necessitates meticulous investigation for the achievement of colloidal MHP NCs. Furthermore, due to the concern of lead toxicity towards public and environmental health, researchers in the field of MHP optoelectronics have been compelled to undertake and further develop the preparation of colloidal lead-free halide perovskite NCs.
With this perspective, the efforts devoted towards developing high-quality colloidal MHP NCs that are driven by the functional properties-oriented design and innovation of synthetic strategies involved towards obtaining multiple morphologies of MHP NCs are highlighted. The routes employed to prepare both inorganic and hybrid MHP NCs are evaluated and the comparison between the two systems are drawn. By providing a detailed comprehension of the fundamental chemistry of the synthetic approaches and photophysical properties of MHP NCs, and by interpreting the critical aspects of these protocols, it is expected that this perspective will provide the groundwork for the next generation of progressions in the preparation of colloidal MHP NCs. The viewpoints on the perspectives in the deployment of colloidal MHP NCs for PV applications are also described, along with the current research status of PV devices based on colloidal MHP NCs. For related topics regarding the genesis, stabilities, defects, and other optoelectronic applications of colloidal MHP NCs, the concerned readers are referred to some recent reviews for comprehensive exploration.27–34
2. Colloidal synthetic advancements
Compared with prevalent semiconducting materials (Cd and Pb chalcogenides), MHPs are relatively inherently ionic, implying that the NCs' nucleation and growth kinetics would be fast and highly crystalline NCs could be formed within seconds at room temperature. Therefore, the challenge that springs up for researchers in the field of nanotechnology is to develop synthetic approaches to achieve the size- and morphology-controllable MHP NCs. In recent years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to the production of colloidal MHP NCs and great accomplishments have been attained. A variety of colloidal synthetic procedures have been investigated to produce MHP NCs with different chemical natures and morphologies.
The initial work of employing a colloidal synthetic approach to prepare MHP NCs was demonstrated by Schmidt et al. in 2014, by introducing an alkyl ammonium bromide as the capping ligand for CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3).35 The synthesis was based on the hot-injection method, which has been demonstrated as a versatile route for producing colloidal binary, ternary, and quaternary chalcogenide NCs with high quality and is carried out by the addition of methylammonium and PbBr2 into a warm solution containing medium-sized (or long chain) alkyl ammonium bromide, oleic acid, and a non-coordinating solvent.36–39 Nanocrystalline MAPbBr3 with particle size of 6 nm and a green PL emission was prepared and the as-prepared NCs were stable in the solid state and in the colloidal solution for more than three months. Subsequent research by the same group promoted the PL quantum yield of MAPbBr3 NCs to around 100% and the chemical yield of synthesis as high as 76% was obtained, both of which were achieved by deploying 2-adamantylammonium bromide as the only capping ligand.40 The syntheses of other colloidal MHP NCs through the hot-injection approach will be discussed in the following section.
Instead of using hot-injection, Zhang et al. developed a room-temperature based ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) synthetic route to prepare highly luminescent colloidal MAPbBr3 nanoparticles.41 The LARP approach was accomplished by mixing a solution of MAPbBr3 precursor in a good (polar) solvent (dissolving the inorganic salts) into a poor (non-polar) solvent (promoting the reprecipitation process) under vigorous stirring in the presence of long-chain organic ligands. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the average diameter of the as-synthesized MAPbBr3 NCs to be 3.3 nm with a size deviation of ±0.7 nm. The tunabilities of the sizes and thereby the band gaps of MAPbBr3 NCs can be achieved by adjusting the concentrations of the perovskites precursors and regulating the precipitation temperature.42,43 Huang et al. reported the first demonstration of a size-tuned band gap in MAPbBr3 NCs by adjusting the temperature to control the LARP process, and the emission peak of the NCs attained ranged from 475 to 520 nm along with exceptionally high PL quantum yields from 74% to 93%.42 Jin et al. applied the LARP approach to synthesize MAPbBr3 NCs with adjustable size (NCs average diameter ranging from 4 to 53 nm) by tuning the concentration of MAPbBr3 NCs suspensions.43 For the first time, the authors reported the fabrication of MAPbBr3 NC thin films with high PL quantum yields (80–90%) through an electric-field-assisted film assembly method. Size-tunable MAPbBr3 NCs were also prepared through the LARP technique by controlling the concentrations of the ligands employed in the synthesis. Zhang et al. prepared MAPbBr3 NCs with tunable sizes from 6.6 to 13.3 nm by regulating the amount of octylamine in the solution, which functioned as the capping ligand for NCs.44
Post-synthetic ion exchange transformation of NCs, which provide an access to NCs with fine-tuned composition and optical properties comparable to those of the directly synthesized NCs, have been demonstrated as a highly efficacious strategy for the synthesis of colloidal MHP NCs.45–48 Nedelcu et al. and Akkerman et al. reported the anion exchange procedure for colloidal cesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) NCs at almost the same time.49,50 In Nedelcu et al.’s study, highly luminescent CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs were prepared via anion exchange by tuning the halide ratios in the colloidal NC solutions. The emission of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs could be regulated over the visible spectral range of 410–700 nm with high PL quantum yields of 20–80% and narrow emission line widths of 10–40 nm. The TEM images of the colloidal CsPbX3 NCs after treatment with varied quantities of chloride and iodine anions, and the emission of colors (under a UV lamp) of the as-prepared NCs are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, the anion exchange did not change the cubic crystal structure of the initial CsPbBr3 NCs. By employing anion exchange, colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanoplates were produced with PL emission covering the visible spectrum from 385 to 690 nm and PL quantum yields as high as 80%.22 The obtained CsPbX3 nanoplates exhibited the ability to self-assemble into highly ordered structures, which indicates that the CsPbX3 nanoplates could serve as significant candidates in optoelectronic applications. The anion exchange method was also reported for the preparation of colloidal MAPbBr3 NCs, which showed a morphology similar to the nanoplates.51 By partially or completely replacing the bromide anion with chloride or iodide, the authors were able to produce MAPbBr3−xClx or MAPbBr3−xIx NCs with tunable band gaps over the wide range of 1.5–3.1 eV (corresponding to 400–850 nm).

Solvothermal approach is one of the most common strategies for the preparations of NCs with well-controlled size, shape, and high crystallinity.52–55 This procedure has been utilized for the synthesis of both lead-free halide perovskite NCs and lead halide perovskite NCs. Chen et al. were the first to report the solvothermal synthetic route for lead-free cesium tin halide (CsSnX3, X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite NCs.56 The reaction involved pre-mixing of the precursors and a non-aqueous solvent in a sealed container (stainless steel autoclave), which was then maintained at a certain temperature for a desired period. The as-prepared CsSnX3 NCs showed the nanorod morphology of (diameters ∼5 nm) and composition-tunable PL emissions of the nanorods ranged over the entire visible spectrum (from 625 to 709 nm), as shown in Fig. 2. In another report, Chen et al. developed the solvothermal synthesis of monodisperse CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, mixed Br/Cl, or Br/I) nanocubes and high-quality CsPbX3 (X = Br, mixed Br/Cl, or Br/I) nanowires.57 The resulting CsPbX3 nanocubes showed tunable PL emission spectra ranging from 410 to 700 nm, high PL quantum yield up to 80%, and narrow emission line width (from 12 to 36 nm). It is noteworthy that the as-synthesized CsPbX3 nanowires were ultrathin (diameter as small as 2.6 nm) and highly stable. As proposed by the authors, the shape change of CsPbX3 from nanocubes to nanowires may be interpreted by a dynamically controlled seed-mediated growth process since the formation of the CsPbX3 nanowires happened when the precursors were heated at high temperature with predissolution, while no predissolution was introduced for the synthesis of the CsPbX3 nanocubes.

To avoid the use of polar solvents and to enable large-scale production, Jang et al., Tong et al., and Huang et al. developed the ultrasonication-assisted synthetic procedure for the preparation of high-quality MHP NCs.58–61 By direct ultrasonication of the precursors in the presence of organic coordinating ligands, APbX3 MHP NCs with a wide range of compositions, (where A = MA, formamidinium (FA), or Cs and X = Cl, Br, or I) were synthesized. Moreover, a series of APbX3 NCs with mixed halides were reported, including MAPbBr3−xClx, MAPbBr3−xIx, CsPbBr3−xClx, and CsPbBr3−xIx.58 In Jang et al.’s study, MHP NCs with different compositions all showed uniform plate-like morphologies with an average side-length of 10 nm. The tunable band gap of MHP NCs over a wide range (1.54 to 3.18 eV) was obtained by regulating the composition of the cations and halide anions. By controlling the oriented attachment of the initially formed nanocubes, Tong et al. managed to prepare CsPbBr3 nanowires by ultrasonication of Cs2CO3 and PbBr2 in 1-octadecene in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid.60 A subsequent ion exchange reaction of CsPbBr3 nanowires with PbCl2 and PbI2 provided CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 NCs with the nanowire morphologies, as shown in Fig. 3b–g. The tunable optical band gap and PL emission of the CsPbX3 nanowires covered the full visible range of 400 to 700 nm (Fig. 3h).

Microwave-induced preparation is another synthetic route that has been deployed for the syntheses of high-quality MHP NCs with tunable compositions and high-throughput. By one-step microwave irradiation in a heterogeneous solid–liquid reaction system with no precursor preparations, Long et al. synthesized multiple colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs with tunable properties and morphologies (nanocubes, nanorods, nanowires, quadrate nanoplates, and hexagonal nanoplates), as shown in Fig. 4.62 PL emission color could be easily tuned over the entire visible spectral region by the anion exchange process. Later on, Pan et al., Liu et al., and Li et al. reported the microwave-assisted production of monodisperse CsPbX3 NCs with high PL quantum yields (as high as 90%) and narrow full width at half maximum emission line.63–65 A noticeable feature of the as-synthesized NCs is that they appeared to be stable for up to two months with only a minor reduction in the PL quantum yields.65

3. Morphology-controlled syntheses of colloidal MHP NCs
Precise control over the morphologies of colloidal NCs is of importance because the morphologies of the materials greatly affect their optoelectronic properties and the quality of the NC thin films prepared by solution-based deposition. Great endeavors have been made to produce colloidal MHP NCs with various morphologies, including nanospheres, nanocubes, nanorods, nanoplates, nanowires, and nanosheets. It has been demonstrated that a couple of synthetic parameters could influence the morphologies of colloidal MHP NCs such as the precursors, the employed ligands, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. The synthetic routes discussed in Section 1, including hot-injection, LARP, anion-exchange, solvothermal, ultrasonication- and microwave-assisted preparation, are all applicable methods for controlling the morphology of colloidal MHP NCs.
3.1. Hot-injection
Using the hot-injection method, several groups have been able to produce a wide range of morphology-controlled colloidal MHP NCs and have thoroughly explored the impact of reaction temperature, reaction time, precursors, and ligands on the shape of the resulting NCs. The most studied colloidal MHP NCs are all-inorganic CsPbX3 for the reason that hybrid organic–inorganic lead-based perovskites show low intrinsic stability, which would immensely hinder their applications. So far, colloidal CsPbX3 NCs with nanosphere, nanocube, nanoplatelet, nanosheet, and nanowire morphologies have been reportedly synthesized through the hot-injection approach.

3.1.1. Lead halide perovskites. 
The pioneering work of preparing morphology-controlled colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, and mixed Cl/Br and Br/I systems) NCs via hot-injection was reported by Protesescu et al., which was accomplished by employing oleic acid and oleylamine as the ligands to colloidally stabilize the NCs, and Cs-oleate and Pb(II)-halide as the precursors.66 The obtained NCs exhibited the cube morphology and the size of the NCs could be tuned in the range of 4–15 nm by adjusting the reaction temperature. The stability testing of the NCs showed that only the cubic CsPbI3 NCs recrystallized into a yellow phase (PL-inactive orthorhombic phase) upon extended storage at room temperature while all other compositions of CsPbX3 NCs remained stable in the cubic phase. In the subsequent works by Park et al. and Su et al., slight modifications in the synthetic methods were made by tuning the feeding ratios of the precursors and ligands, which led to the improved quality of CsPbX3 nanocubes with narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL spectra (the narrowest less than 10 nm, as shown in Fig. 5) and strong photostability.67,68 Another modification method involved the introduction of NH4X (X = Cl, Br, I) and PbO to substitute for Pb(II) halide as the precursors, which set a halide-rich circumstance for the hot-injection synthesis and provided the CsPbX3 nanocubes with high quality and remarkable durability.69 A report by Liu et al. demonstrated that the deployment of trioctylphosphine-PbI2 as the precursor for the synthesis of CsPbI3 nanocubes also improved the chemical stability of the resulting NCs significantly.23

Inspired by the work of Protesescu et al., Liang et al. and Almeida et al. developed the synthetic strategies for colloidal CsPbBr3 nanocubes, nanoplatelets, and nanosheets by controlling the amounts of oleic acid and oleylamine.70,71 Almeida et al.’s report also revealed that the CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets could be prepared by increasing the ratio of aliphatic ammonium ions to Cs+ ions since the aliphatic ammonium ions could compete with the Cs+ ions for lattice sites and promote the formation of the hybrid layered structures.71 The authors proposed the application of other Brønsted acids for the production of two-dimensional (2D) CsPbBr3 NCs and discussed that lower amounts of acid were needed to initiate the formation of 2D NCs when the acid strength increased. The introduction of preformed alkylammonium bromide (oleylamine-HBr) salt functioning as the dimension-modulating reagent for the preparation of CsPbBr3 nanocubes and nanoplatelets was also reported.72 It is worth noting that the size-tunability of the CsPbBr3 NCs with ∼1 nm step growth regimes could be obtained as a function of the concentration of the fed oleylamine-HBr. In a separate report by Lv et al., colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanosheets with a thickness of a few monolayers were prepared by using oleic acid and oleylamine as the ligands.73 Under fine-tuned reaction conditions, a lateral dimension of up to 1 × 1 μm was achieved for the CsPbCl3 nanosheets. The hot-injection scheme based on oleic acid and oleylamine as the ligands also offered CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs with the nanowire morphology and uniform growth direction.74 The reaction dynamics study showed that the dominant morphology for the NCs was nanocubes for the initial stage (<10 min), followed by more nanowire shapes, and the number of nanocubes decreased as some square-like nanosheets emerged (after 10 min), whereas uniform nanowires appeared at the later stage (40–60 min) when the nanosheets dissolved but crystals with sizes larger than 200 nm existed (Fig. 6).

Further evolution of the synthesis developed by Protesescu et al. involved the utilization of other acids and amines with short alkyl chain instead of oleic acid and oleylamine as the ligands.72,75–79 By using octylamine and oleylamine as the ligands, Zhang et al. synthesized monodisperse colloidal CsPbBr3 nanowires with diameters of 10 ± 2 nm.75 A noteworthy feature of this synthetic route is the high yield and purity of the CsPbBr3 nanowires after simple purification. Shamsi et al. prepared CsPbBr3 nanosheets by introducing octanoic acid and octylamine in the reaction.76 The authors controlled the lateral sizes of the resulting nanosheets (tunable from 300 nm to 5 μm) by adjusting the ratio of octanoic acid and octylamine to the long chain ligands of oleic acid and oleylamine (a higher ratio of short to long chain ligands yielding larger NCs), while the ultrathin thickness of about 2.5 to 3 nm (2 to 3 unit cells) was maintained. A later work by Imran et al. focused on synthesizing CsPbBr3 nanowires with strong quantum confinement by utilizing octanoic acid and hexanoic acid as the ligands.77 The as-prepared nanowires with a width of 5.1 ± 0.5 nm in solution showed PL quantum yields as high as 77%. Pan et al. reported a detailed investigation of the impact of different short alkyl chain ligands, including acids and amines, on the shape, size, and surface properties of the CsPbBr3 NCs.78 They concluded that the chain length variation of the carboxylic acids and amines (carbon numbers ranging from 18 to two) showed independent correlation to the shape and size of the NCs in addition to the temperature effect. Moreover, the ammonium ions showed weaker binding to the NCs compared to the carboxylates but they functioned better in tuning the growth of the anisotropic platelet structures while the carboxylate ligands were more effective in modulating the size of the relatively more isotropic nanocubes. The shape and size dependence on the carboxylic acids and amines with different chain length are summarized in Fig. 7. More recently, Imran et al. reported a strategy using secondary aliphatic amine ligand in addition to oleic acid to modulate the growth of CsPbBr3 NCs.79 The inability of secondary amines to seek suitable steric conditions at the surface of the NCs, presumably due to the poor ability of the secondary aliphatic amines to coordinate to PbBr2, led to the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanocubes with remarkable shape and phase purity.

Several publications have reported the morphology-controlled synthesis of colloidal hybrid organic–inorganic lead-based perovskite NCs by the hot-injection procedure. The initial work on preparing colloidal MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets was reported by Tyagi et al.80 The synthesis involved the addition of PbBr2, MABr, and octylammonium bromide into a stirring solution of oleic acid and 1-octadecene. The reaction product was a mixture of MAPbBr3 nanostructures with different morphologies (nanoparticles and nanoplatelets). Upon further purification (including centrifugation and sonication for a few times) of the product, single unit cell thick crystalline MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets with strong quantum confinement were produced. Jang et al. reported a synthetic route for colloidal MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets by introducing octylamine as the only ligand.51 The obtained MAPbBr3 NCs were also composed of nanoparticles (size of about 5 to 20 nm) and nanoplatelets, where the nanoparticles showed a tendency to aggregate into the polycrystalline nanoplatelets. Hot-injection procedures are also applicable for the morphology-controlled synthesis of colloidal MAPbI3 NCs. Vybornyi et al. demonstrated the synthesis of MAPbI3 nanocubes, nanowires, and nanoplatelets by using oleylamine and oleic acid as the ligands.81 The as-synthesized MAPbI3 nanocubes showed an absorption band edge at about 750 nm with moderate PL quantum yields (20–30%) and a mean particle size of ∼10 nm. The synthesis of MAPbI3 nanoplatelets and nanowires were suboptimal since the MAPbI3 nanoplatelets showed a tendency to aggregate, and unsatisfactory shape- and phase-uniformity were observed for the MAPbI3 nanowires. By using octylammonium iodide and oleic acid as the ligands, Aharon et al. accomplished the preparation of colloidal (C8H17NH3)2MA2Pb3(IxBr1−x)10 (0 > x > 1) nanorods with well-controlled composition and good size-distribution.82 In order to elucidate the formation mechanism of the nanorods, the authors studied the impact of the ratio of oleic acid to octylammonium iodide on the morphology-controlled synthesis of (C8H17NH3)2MA2Pb3(IxBr1−x)10. It was revealed that the fed octylammonium iodide and oleic acid with optimized ratio for balanced nanorod reaction provided enough octylammonium iodide to stabilize the surface of NCs and sufficient oleic acid to equilibrate the growth into nanorod shape. Fig. 8 shows the TEM images of the resulting (C8H17NH3)2MA2Pb3(IxBr1−x)10 nanorods with different halides compositions.

Protesescu et al. reported the hot-injection synthetic routes for colloidal CH(NH2)2PbBr3 (FAPbBr3) nanocubes.83 Oleylammonium bromide was used as the Br-precursor and oleic acid was employed as the ligand (method 1). The as-synthesized high-quality nanocubes were highly monodisperse (with size deviation below 5%) and showed bright PL emission along with narrow PL FWHM. Additionally, the FAPbBr3 nanocubes were more robust in several aspects compared with the CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 NCs synthesized with a similar method. The FAPbBr3 nanocubes maintained bright PL emission after 2–3 cycles of purification (repetitive precipitation/redispersion with acetone/toluene) while the CsPbBr3 NCs reached a non-luminescent state, and the MAPbBr3 NCs quickly decomposed when such a procedure was applied. The authors also studied the synthetic routes with oleylamine and oleic acid both functioning as the ligands (method 2) and CH3MgBr as the Br-precursor (method 3), which either yielded FAPbBr3 NCs with broad size-distribution or led to poor control over the size of the NCs. The synthesis of cube-shaped FAPbI3 and FA-doped CsPbI3 NCs via hot-injection procedures was also reported by Protesescu et al.84 The as-synthesized NCs showed good size-dispersion with mean sizes ranging from 10 to 15 nm, and higher structural stability and chemical integrity than their MA-only or Cs-only based counterparts with similar size and morphology.66,85–87 High PL quantum yields (>70%) at ∼690 nm for FA0.1Cs0.9PbI3 NCs and at ∼780 nm for FAPbI3 NCs were obtained with less than 5% relative decrease after several months of storage in ambient conditions.
A recent report by Imran et al. demonstrated a universal way for synthesizing colloidal APbX3 (A = Cs, MA, FA; X = Cl, Br, I) NCs with cubic shape by introducing benzoyl halides as the precursors.88 All of the resulting APbX3 NCs showed high phase stability, good size-distribution, and excellent optical properties. A record PL quantum yield of 65% was reported for CsPbCl3 NCs. The authors discussed that the origin of excellent quality with regard to the stability and optical properties of CsPbX3 NCs was tentatively ascribed to the formation of lead halide-terminated surfaces, in which the Cs ions were partially replaced by the oleylammonium ions, triggered by the synthetic conditions.


3.1.2. Lead-free halide perovskites. 
Due to the concerns over the toxicity of lead towards public health and the ecosystem, replacing lead with environmentally benign metal elements in halide perovskites is important. Efforts are underway to develop lead-free halide perovskites with high performance and great stability for optoelectronic applications.89–92 The search for lead-free halide perovskite NCs has been launched and colloidal synthetic routes have offered lead-free halide perovskite NCs with various compositions, sizes, and morphologies.56,93–102
The first report on the morphology-controlled synthesis of colloidal lead-free halide perovskite NCs emerged in 2016, where Jellicoe et al. demonstrated the preparation of CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Cl0.5Br0.5, Br, Br0.5I0.5, I) nanocubes via hot-injection procedure based on the deployment of oleic acid and oleylamine as the ligands.97 The spectral tunability of the CsSnX3 NCs was achieved by adjusting the halide composition, as has been observed for CsPbX3 NCs. However, solution-dispersed CsSnX3 NCs exhibited poor stability due to precipitation of some particles after long storage time and the measured PL quantum yields of the NCs were rather low (<0.14%), indicating that the quality of the CsSnX3 NCs needs to be improved.
The hot-injection strategy was introduced to produce morphology-controlled colloidal Cs3Sb2I9 NCs for the first time by Pal et al.98 The preparation of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs was carried out using SbI3 and Cs-oleate as the precursors, and octanoic acid and oleylamine as the ligands. The morphology of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs could be tuned from nanoplatelets to nanorods by controlling the reaction temperature. The thickness of the Cs3Sb2I9 nanoplatelets measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) was found to be 1.5 ± 0.1 nm, which is small enough to create quantum confinement effect, thus resulting into a yellow color emission from the nanoplatelets. Meanwhile, the Cs3Sb2I9 nanorods exhibited red emission with a long wavelength absorption tail extending to 615 nm, similar to the bulk material, which was ascribed to the large dimensions of the nanorods (average length of 655 ± 20 nm and diameter of 46 ± 4 nm). Both Cs3Sb2I9 nanoplatelets and nanorods showed impressive stability under ambient conditions for over 3 months.
More recently, several publications have reported the morphology-controlled synthesis of colloidal lead-free double perovskite NCs through hot-injection method.99–102 Creutz et al. reported the synthesis of cube-shaped colloidal Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) NCs with edge-lengths of about 8 nm and relatively narrow size distributions (Fig. 9).99 Due to the quaternary compositions of Cs2AgBiX6, the synthesis of the colloidal NCs require fastidious care to balance the reactivities and chemical potentials of the individual components. The delicate optimizations of the synthetic parameters for Cs2AgBiX6 NCs include precursor stoichiometries, ligand concentrations, and reaction temperature to avoid common impurities such as AgX, CsX, Cs–Bi-X, and Cs–Ag-X. The Cs2AgBiI6 nanocubes were also synthesized through the anion-exchange of Cs2AgBiBr6 with trimethylsilyl iodide. The stability test of colloidal Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocubes by Bekenstein et al. showed that the solid films of the NCs were stable for up to 90 days of storage under ambient conditions.100 In another work by Zhou et al., colloidal Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocubes exhibited structural stability in low polarity solvents for 3 weeks, phase uniformity against 55% relative humidity for 90 days and under light irradiation of about 70 mW cm−2 for 500 h or 100 °C heating for 300 h, thus indicating the impressive durability of the NCs.101 The colloidal synthesis of the Cs2AgInCl6 nanocubes with pure phase, good size distribution, and good thermal stability was reported by Locardi et al.102 The synthesis was based on deploying benzoyl chloride as the Cl precursor. However, the PL emission of the resulting Cs2AgInCl6 nanocubes was weak, with the obtained PL quantum yield of only 1.6 ± 1%.

3.2. LARP
The room-temperature synthetic route of LARP has been developed for the morphology-controlled synthesis of colloidal APbX3 (A = Cs, MA, FA; X = Cl, Br, I) NCs with a variety of shapes, including nanospheres, nanocubes, nanorods, nanowires, and nanoplatelets. Seth et al. reported the morphology-controlled synthesis of colloidal CsPbX3 NCs of six different morphologies by varying the solvent, the concentrations of the capping ligands, and the reaction time.103 By using ethyl acetate as the anti-solvent, and oleylamine and oleic acid as the coordinating ligands, CsPbX3 nanospheres, nanoplatelets, and nanobars were produced. When toluene was used as the anti-solvent, CsPbX3 NCs with the morphologies of nanocubes, nanorods, and nanowires were synthesized. The as-synthesized NCs were of good crystalline quality and showed high PL quantum yields. In a following work by Sun et al., colloidal CsPbX3 NCs with nanocube, nanorod, and nanoplatelet morphologies were prepared by choosing different combinations of organic acid and amine ligands through the LARP approach.104 The formation process for CsPbX3 NCs with different morphologies mediated by organic acid and amine ligands is shown in Fig. 10. The PL decay lifetimes of the resulting NCs have been calculated to be as high as hundreds of nanoseconds, indicating the excellent crystalline quality of the NCs.

The pioneering work of synthesizing morphology-controlled MAPbBr3 NCs through LARP was reported by Sichert et al., where toluene was introduced as the anti-solvent and octylammonium as the ligand.105 By tuning the concentration of octylammonium, the MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets of varying thickness were prepared. However, the stability of the as-synthesized MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets needs to be enhanced since quasi-spherical nanoparticles were observed during TEM characterization, which were not initially present in the synthesis and are mostly caused by degradation of the nanoplatelets upon exposure to the electron beam. The modifications of the LARP process developed by Sichert et al., including the use of acetone as the anti-solvent and introduction of oleic acid and oleylamine as the ligands, also provided the colloidal MAPbBr3 with the nanoplatelet morphology.106–108 In view of the ‘conventional’ LARP process that resulted in the fast precipitation and production of MAPbBr3 NCs with broad size and shape distributions, Zhang et al. developed a ‘reverse’ LARP process, where the sequence of the solvent mixing was changed by pouring the anti-solvent into the good solvent, which induced the separation of nucleation and growth of the NCs.109 By controlling the amount of the ligand, the MAPbBr3 NCs with nanocube and nanowire morphologies were synthesized.
The LARP route was also found to be applicable for the morphology-controlled synthesis of FAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs.110,111 So far, the FAPbX3 NCs with nanocube and nanoplatelet shapes have been produced by using toluene (or chloroform) as the anti-solvent. Compared to the CsPbX3 and MAPbX3 NCs synthesized via LARP, the FAPbX3 NCs showed higher PL quantum yields (a value of as high as 85% was obtained for the FAPbBr3 nanoplatelets), and better colloidal and chemical stability.21
Yang et al. demonstrated the initial attempt to synthesize 2D layered lead halide perovskite NCs through the LARP approach.112 The versatile manner of LARP enabled the synthesis of single- and few-layer phenylethylammonium lead halide perovskite ((PEA)2PbX4, X = Cl, Br, I) nanosheets with bright PL emission and remarkable stability. It was revealed that the lateral size of the resulting nanosheets could be tuned by changing the anti-solvents. Four different kinds of anti-solvents, including toluene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, and dichloromethane, were chosen to study the effect of solvents on the crystallization process of the nanosheets. It was concluded that the higher polarity solvent could expedite higher saturation concentration of the perovskite precursors and thereby facilitate the production of smaller sized nanosheets.
The morphology-controlled syntheses of colloidal MHP NCs through the LARP approach are summarized in Table 2.

3.3. Other approaches
Solvothermal method has been demonstrated as a commonly used method for the preparation of various nanocrystals with precisely controlled shapes.113,114 In the report by Chen et al., the morphology-controlled syntheses of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, mixed Br/Cl and Br/I) NCs by the solvothermal approach were accomplished by adjusting the concentrations of the precursors.57Fig. 11 illustrates the growth process of the CsPbX3 NCs obtained without predissolution and with predissolution of the precursors. The CsPbX3 nanocubes were synthesized when the precursors were heated directly without predissolution, which led to low concentrations of the precursor ions, and thus, only a relatively small amount of CsPbX3 NCs nucleated at a certain precursor concentration. On the contrary, predissolution of the precursors caused higher concentrations of the precursor ions and more nuclei appeared along with the formation of smaller nuclei, which self-assembled into nanowires through seed-mediated growth process. Li et al. more recently reported a self-assembly approach for preparing colloidal CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanosheets and nanoplatelets from corresponding nanorods under solvothermal conditions.115 The obtained nanosheets and nanoplatelets showed a wide lateral size ranging from ∼100 nm to ∼1 μm and a thickness of only a few unit cells.

The approach of ultrasonication-assisted synthesis also provides an impressive way of obtaining MHP NCs with varied shapes.59,60 Similar to other colloidal synthetic routes, the concentrations of the precursors and ligands and the reaction time play important roles in controlling the shapes of the resulting NCs. Tong et al. showed that CsPbI3 with nanocube and nanoplatelet morphologies could be prepared by tuning the concentration of the precursors for the synthesis.59 A later report by the same group demonstrated that the shape of CsPbBr3 could be tuned from nanocubes to nanowires through prolonged ultrasonication.60 The generation of nanowires was ascribed to the oriented attachment of initially formed nanocubes.
The morphology-controlled syntheses of MHP NCs through microwave-induced preparation can be achieved by tuning the ratio of precursors, adjusting the concentrations of ligands, modulating the microwave irradiation, controlling the reaction temperature, and so on.62,63 A systematic research of the mechanism behind the shape-controlled growth of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs through the microwave-assisted route was presented by Pan et al.63 Based on a thorough study of the synthetic parameters, the CsPbX3 NCs with a variety of shapes, including nanocubes, nanorods, and nanoplates, were prepared.
The shape transformation from zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructure to one-dimensional (1D) and 2D nanostructures through self-assembly has also been reported for the morphology-controlled synthesis of MHP NCs.22,59,116–118 Liu et al. applied the self-organization approach to synthesize MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets from pre-formed colloidal MAPbBr3 nanoparticles.117 The shape transformation happened when the pre-formed nanoparticles were kept in a non-polar solvent at high concentration for a certain time. Based on the theoretical simulations and analysis, the authors proposed that the dominant driving forces for the self-organization of the nanoparticles were the dipole–dipole interactions, with a realignment of the dipolar vectors. Compared with the nanoplatelets prepared through other approaches, the resulting MHP nanoplatelets showed great colloidal dispersibility and remarkable optical properties with an obtained PL quantum yield of about 70%. Sun et al. reported the hierarchical self-assembly of CsPbI3 nanotubes into single-crystal nanowires with the same width as the size of the nanocubes through oriented-attachment, which was triggered by the polar solvent induced lattice distortion.118 It was disclosed that stronger the polarity of the polar solvent, faster was the induced self-assembly of the nanocubes. Interestingly, the resulting nanowires could further self-assemble side-by-side into thick single-crystal nanowires with diameters of the order of a submicrometer.
An engrossing work reported by Akkerman et al. revealed that the addition of polar solvent acetone into a solution of the CsPbBr3 precursors could also provide the well-defined CsPbBr3 NCs with nanoplatelet morphology.119 It was proposed that acetone destabilized the complexes of Cs+ and Pb2+ ions with other molecules in the solution and triggered the nucleation and growth of the nanoplatelets. The authors also disclosed that the thickness of the nanoplatelets could be well-controlled by adjusting the feeding amount of HBr during the synthesis due to the fact that the addition of HBr led to increased acidity of the solution, thereby causing the protonation of oleylamine, and the protonated oleylamine slowed down the growth in the vertical direction by competing with Cs+ ions on the surface of the growing platelets.
4. Self-assembly of colloidal MHP NCs
The organization of colloidal NCs into highly ordered nano-/microstructures via the scheme of self-assembly has undergone prodigious development over the past years on account of the designed assembly of NCs facilitating the generation of perfectly ordered structures with unique properties that are different from the discrete NCs and/or bulk materials.120–127 Moreover, the establishment of ordered arrays of NCs with this simple and effective approach enables the realization of large-scale, highly integrated functional devices with high material utilization. The exploration of self-assembly of colloidal NCs is a subject of both fundamental and practical importance. Colloidal MHP NCs can behave as ideal building blocks for self-assembly due to their impressive narrow size-dispersion and high shape uniformity. The aforementioned self-assembly procedures of 0D NCs into 1D and 2D nanoarchitectures have evidenced the effectiveness of crystal reshaping of the colloidal MHP NCs. Moreover, self-assembly of the colloidal MHP NCs into superlattices (or supercrystals, mesocrystals) has been demonstrated through the routes of evaporation-induced self-assembly on a solid substrate, self-assembly at the interfaces of liquid/liquid or liquid/air, and self-assembly promoted by the destabilization of the surface ligands on the nanocrystals.
The initial study of self-assembled MHP NC superlattices was demonstrated by Nagaoka et al.128 The self-assembly was based on the evaporation of monodisperse CsPbBr3 nanocube solution under vacuum condition. The resultant nanocube superlattices showed a simple superstructure with a lattice constant of about 12.5 nm corresponding to the nanocube side length with the addition of capping ligands and the distance between the nanocubes was determined to be about 2.3 nm, indicating the existence of intercalation of the surface ligands between adjacent nanocubes. Later, Kovalenko et al. reported the self-assembly of CsPbBr3 nanocubes into 1–15 μm cuboidal superlattices by controlled drying of the solvent on substrates under ambient conditions.31,129Fig. 12a shows the schematic representation of the self-assembly of CsPbBr3 nanocubes into supercubes. After self-assembly into supercubes, the CsPbBr3 NCs maintained their bright PL emission in the superlattice state with a slight red-shift due to the coupling between the adjacent nanocubes and the dielectric effect (Fig. 12f). More recently, the same group reported the self-assembly of CsPbBr2Cl nanocubes into highly ordered cuboidal superlattices with the lateral size ranging from 1 to 10 μm.130 Based on an improved synthetic method for shape-pure, monodisperse CsPbBr3 nanocubes, the cuboidal CsPbBr3 superlattices with lateral sizes of up to 50 μm were prepared.78 Furthermore, Bekenstein et al. reported the self-organization of lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocubes into superlattices via this evaporation-induced self-assembly.100

Another approach that has been recently applied for the self-assembly of colloidal MHP NCs is the use of anti-solvent to initiate the ligand–ligand and ligand–solvent interactions to enable the NCs arrangement.131 This solvent-induced assembly process has been deployed in the preparation of large-domain 2D superlattices, 3D colloidal supercrystals, and ordered 1D superlattices.132–135 Soetan et al. reported the self-assembly of CsPbBr3 NCs into 1D superlattice chains via the ligand–solvent interactions by employing hexane as the anti-solvent.136 It was revealed that the excess aliphatic ligands on the surface of the NCs after purification played a crucial role in the formation of the 1D CsPbBr3 chains. In a recent report by van der Burgt et al., the self-assembly of CsPbBr3 nanocubes into cuboidal superlattices was accomplished by using methyl acetate as the anti-solvent.137 As mentioned previously, the key parameter for the high degree self-aligned supercubes of CsPbBr3 originates from the uniform shape and monodisperse size of the CsPbBr3 NCs. The assembled superlattices showed strong emission with an obtained PL quantum yield of 26% and a red shift of about 30 meV with respect to the individual nanocubes.
Partial removal of the stabilizing ligands on the surface of the colloidal NCs has been demonstrated as an effective method to achieve the spontaneous formation of ordered nanostructures.138,139 The driving force for such a transformation of the NCs is the strong dipole–dipole interactions. This ligand destabilization induced self-assembly of the colloidal NCs is also applicable for the synthesis of superlattices. Fu et al. reported the preparation of CsPbBr3 superlattices through oriented attachment by controlled removal of ligands from the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs during the process of purification under ambient conditions.140 The study of the PL emission spectra of the CsPbBr3 superlattices exhibited a PL quantum yield of above 70% but a decreased emission was observed after additional washing by acetone, indicating the aggregation of the superlattices due to the detachment of ligands.
An interesting work on the self-assembly of colloidal MHP NCs reported recently was the spontaneous self-organization of individual CsPbBr3 nanocubes into CsPbBr3 superlattices in a colloidal dispersion via one-pot ultrasonic synthesis.141 It was revealed that the main reason for the spontaneous self-assembly was the highly concentrated precursor solution, which provided appropriate van der Waals forces between the hydrophobic ligands and the CsPbBr3 NC cores. The resultant superlattices exhibited PL emission comparable to the individual nanocubes. The light-emitting devices based on the CsPbBr3 superlattices as the light absorber materials were fabricated, which achieved a pure green emission close to the specified Recommendation 2020 Color Coordinates (a standard set out for UHDTV).
5. Optoelectronic properties
Colloidal MHP NCs have been considered as one of the most exceptional materials in optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical and optoelectronic properties such as wide band gap tunability, large absorption coefficients, high PL quantum yields, narrow emission FWHM, high charge carrier mobility, and long carrier diffusion length. The band gap tunability can be achieved through modifications of the compositions or control over the morphology and size of the MHP NCs. Direct syntheses through hot-injection and LARP approaches at room temperature have provided nanostructured MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), FAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), and CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) with PL emission covering the visible spectrum. Additionally, the compositions of the MHP NCs can be simply modulated through post-synthetic cation/anion exchange, while the morphology of the NCs can be well-maintained. The size- and shape-dependent optical properties have also been extensively investigated and the quantum confinement effect induced PL emission variation has been observed when the dimensions of the NCs were smaller than their Bohr radii (5 nm for CsPbCl3, 7 nm for CsPbBr3, and 12 nm for CsPbI3).66Fig. 13 shows both the absorption and PL emission peaks for the CsPbBr3 nanocubes, which shifted to shorter wavelengths with decrease in the size of the NCs.

The innate tolerance of high density of defects of the MHP NCs (up to 1–2 atom%, typical as vacancies where intrinsic defects act as electronic trap states in the band gap), which is much higher than the conventional metal chalcogenide or pnictide NCs, results in bright PL emission for a variety of colloidal MHP NCs without any post-synthetic surface passivation.21,23,40,42,43,66,68,82,106–108,142 The defect tolerance is enabled by the unique electronic band structure of MHP, with bonding orbitals at the conduction band minimum and anti-bonding orbitals at the valence band maximum.143,144 The scantiness of bonding–antibonding interactions between the conduction bands and valence bands leads to the defect tolerance. Liu et al. reported almost ideal PL quantum yields (up to 100%) from different sized CsPbI3 nanocubes.23 High PL quantum yields were also observed for colloidal MAPbBr3 NCs and FAPbBr3 NCs with nanoplatelet morphology.106–108,110 The bright PL emission of the nanostructured MHPs coincides with other outstanding optoelectronic properties such as low densities of traps, high carrier mobilities, long carrier diffusion lengths, and long carrier recombination lifetimes.145–149 Yettapu et al. reported long-lived carriers in 11 nm-sized colloidal CsPbBr3 nanocubes with high carrier mobility of about 4500 cm2 V−1 s−1 and long diffusion length over 9.2 μm by employing time domain and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy.148 The advantage of defect tolerance of MHP NCs is the primary cause for highly efficient MHP photovoltaic devices and bright MHP light-emitting diodes, even when the MHP NCs contain grain boundaries, impurities, and defects.
The process of multiple exciton (electron–hole pairs) generation (MEG), also referred to as carrier multiplication (CM), which has been well documented for NCs of PbS and PbSe, has also been reported for colloidal MHP NCs.150–153 Owing to their discrete energy levels, relaxed momentum conservation, and enhanced Coulomb interactions, various semiconducting NC systems exhibiting MEG effect that can generate multiple excitons from one high-energy absorbed photon (larger than two times band gap energy Eg) have been projected to fabricate single-junction solar cells with PCEs exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit, which assumes that each photon can only produce one electron.154–166 Contrasting with conventional semiconducting NCs, the hot-carrier cooling mediated by a photon bottleneck in the colloidal lead halide perovskite NCs is slow, which renders the materials with a possibility of enhanced MEG.167–172 Li et al. demonstrated MEG effect with low threshold of 2.25 Eg and 75% slope efficiency (ηMEG, which corresponds to the increment in additional excitons with respect to the increased photon energy beyond the MEG threshold) in intermediate-confined 7.5 nm-sized colloidal FAPbI3 NCs, which outpace the reported MEG slope efficiencies in strongly confined MEG candidates such as PbS and PbSe.173–175 In a report by de Weerd et al., the MEG effect in colloidal CsPbI3 NCs was validated at the threshold excitation energy when it reached the energy conserving limit of twice the band gap by using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.176 Nevertheless, while a few reports have addressed the breaking of the ‘perovskite red wall’ to prepare stable MHP NCs with red and infrared emissions, the challenge to deploy MHP NCs in MEG-tailored photovoltaic applications is arduous considering that the NCs' band gaps should be ideally positioned into the near infrared region (e.g., 1.2–1.4 eV).84
6. Solar cells based on colloidal MHP NCs
Inspired by the remarkable photovoltaic performance of bulk MHPs and the prominent implementation of nanomaterials, the nanostructured MHPs are of particular interest in a wide variety of optoelectronic and photonic applications. The foreground of nanostructured MHPs in photovoltaics has been readily confirmed by the prototype devices, which have been demonstrated based on nanowires, nanosheets, NC inks, quantum dots, and colloidal NCs, while the research continues vigorously.24,177–180 Notably, solar cells based on MHP nanowires with PCE reaching a value of 18.74% has been reported, denoting the auspicious prospect of nanostructured MHPs.181 Furthermore, the appealing optical properties, the high quality, the sterling monodispersity and shape-uniformity, and the superlative self-assembly performance of the colloidal MHP NCs make them very attractive optoelectronic materials with great potential in solar cells. The following context provides an illustration of the current achievements and the achievable future for solar cells based on colloidal MHP NCs.
The lead-off attempt to incorporate colloidal MHP NCs into PV applications was demonstrated by Swarnkar et al.179 Based on the hot-injection synthetic route developed by Protesescu et al., phase-stable cubic colloidal CsPbI3 NCs were synthesized and purified by using methyl acetate as the anti-solvent that removed the excess unreacted precursors without inducing agglomeration.66 PV devices based on colloidal CsPbI3 NCs as the light absorbent materials were fabricated by spin-casting with additional dipping in a saturated methyl acetate solution of either lead acetate or lead nitrate to enhance the surface passivation, which yielded a PCE as high as 10.77% and a VOC of 1.23 V (tested under ambient conditions). The PV device architecture and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the device measured in air are shown in Fig. 14. Later, the same group reported an enhanced PV performance of 13.43% PCE for colloidal CsPbI3 NCs-based devices by adopting AX (A = MA+, FA+, or Cs+; X = I− or Br−) salt post-treatments to enhance the electronic coupling between the NCs, thereby improving the carrier mobility of the NC films.182 In addition to the improvement in PCE values, an impressive reduction in the hysteresis between the forward and reverse J–V scans was observed for devices with AX post-treatments. The detailed surface chemistry study of CsPbI3 NCs purified with methyl acetate revealed the hydrolysis of methyl acetate with adventitious water, which played a predominant role in producing high-efficiency solar cells as it boosted the in situ ligand-exchange of acetic acid with insulating oleate on the surface of the NCs.183 Pursuant to previous reports, the cubic phase of the bulk CsPbI3 only forms at high temperature (about 310 °C) and degrades into the orthorhombic non-perovskite phase shortly after preparation.184 The formation of nanoscale colloidal CsPbI3 has been demonstrated to alleviate the phase-transformation issue through the surface modification of organic ligands for the NCs, which is the main reason for the augmented stability of photovoltaic devices based on CsPbI3 NCs compared with devices fabricated by conventional methods.118

Colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs have also been demonstrated as promising light absorbers for PV devices.185,186 Hoffman et al. reported the fabrication of PV devices based on colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs by deploying spin-casting of the solution of CsPbBr3 NCs followed by thermal annealing to deposit stable CsPbBr3 thin films.186 Optimization of the device fabrication procedures, including tuning of the concentration of the NCs solution and regulating the thickness of the CsPbBr3 NCs layer, brought about the champion devices with PCEs reaching 5.5% and VOC values as high as 1.4 V, where reduced hysteresis was observed.
In a separate report by Christodoulou et al., colloidal mixed halide CsPbBrxI3−x NCs have also been utilized as light absorbing materials in PV devices with moderate performance.187 The preparation of colloidal CsPbBrxI3−x NCs was accomplished through anion exchange reactions of concentrated colloidal CsPbBr3 NC solutions with I− under ambient conditions. PV devices were fabricated in air by depositing CsPbBrxI3−x NCs layer through a single-step approach or layer-by-layer deposition. The best PV performance of 5.3% PCE along with a VOC of 1.31 V was achieved from the single-step device based on CsPbBrI2 NCs. However, the forward scans of J–V showed the presence of hysteresis in both types of devices.
The potential of lead-free Sn-based MHP NCs in PV applications has been directly confirmed by the first demonstration of a functional device with a light-active layer of CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) NCs.56 The as-prepared CsSnX3 NCs with a nanorod morphology showed good crystallinity and diameter deviation (about 15–18%). The fabrication of PV devices was performed by spin-coating the solutions of CsSnX3 nanorods in nitrogen-filled glovebox. The corresponding solar cells exhibited PCEs ranging from 9.66 to 12.96% and the champion PV performance was achieved for a device based on CsSnI3 nanorods. Despite the high PCEs of the devices containing CsSnX3 nanorods, the long-term stability of the cells remains a challenge in practical applications.
The exploration of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) based on colloidal MHP NCs with various compositions is also a promising study. Liu et al. reported the fabrication of QDSCs based on CsSn0.6Pb0.4I3 QDs as the sensitizer, where CsSn0.6Pb0.4I3 QDs were directly synthesized through the hot-injection procedure.188 The fabrication of the devices was accomplished by depositing monolayer (or 2–3 layers) of QDs onto the TiO2 surface as the light-absorbent material, in the same architecture as in the DSSCs. However, the best PCE of QDSCs only reached a value of 2.9%, which is far from satisfactory and is mainly ascribed to the mismatch between CsSn0.6Pb0.4I3 QDs and the employed liquid-state iodide electrolyte. It is expected that the utilization of quasi-solid electrolytes or the fabrication of all-solid-state QDSCs could boost the performance of PV devices based on CsSnxPb1−xI3 QDs to a competitive level.
Instead of introducing MHP NCs as the light-absorptive materials in PV devices, Wang et al. demonstrated the fabrication of MHP-based light-emitting solar cells by using colloidal MAPbBr3 NCs as the nucleation center to induce the growth of high-quality MAPbI3 films.189 MHP light-emitting solar cell is a cutting edge technique based on MHP solar cells and light-emitting diodes sharing the similar device structure.190 The heterogeneous nucleation of MHPs happened because the similar lattice constants reduced the nucleation free-energy barrier compared to homogeneous nucleation, which enhanced the crystallinity of the MAPbI3 films with decreased grain sizes, and thereby led to longer carrier lifetime and lower trap-state density in the films. The resultant light-emitting solar cells showed improved PCEs (with a value of 17.10%) compared to the devices not implementing heterogeneous nucleation.
Additionally, colloidal CsPbX3 (X = I or mixed Br/I system) and CsSnBrxI3-x NCs have been employed as effective interface engineering materials for MHP PV devices on account of their suitable valence band positions (VBPs).191–193 Liu et al. demonstrated the introduction of stable CsPbI3 NCs as an interface layer between the light-active MHP film and the hole transport layer could enhance both the PCEs and stabilities of the related PV devices.191 The improved PV performance of the devices with CsPbI3 NCs interface layer can be ascribed to the matched energy levels and the ameliorated hole transfer efficiencies. The implementation of CsSnBrxI3−x NCs as the hole-extraction layer in MHP PV devices was reported by Xu et al.192 This interface engineering strategy based on lead-free perovskite NCs also improved the performance of PV devices to a great extent. All in all, the manipulation of energy bands by employing colloidal MHP NCs as the interface layer is a universally practical approach to fabricate MHP devices with high efficiency and long-term stability.
The performances of PV devices based on colloidal MHP NCs as the light absorptive materials are summarized in Table 3.

7. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, the recent advances in the development of colloidal MHP NCs, including the synthetic approaches, the self-assembly behaviors, the optoelectronic properties, and their applications in PV devices, were systematically explored and summarized. High-quality colloidal MHP NCs can be efficiently prepared through a variety of methods, including hot-injection, LARP, solvothermal, ultrasonication- and microwave-assisted preparation, as well as anion-exchange reactions. Colloidal MHP NCs exhibit outstanding self-assembly ability owing to their narrow size-dispersion and significant shape-uniformity. Tailoring 2D nano-/micro-patterns as well as 3D architectures of assembled colloidal MHP NCs has emerged as an accessible and influential passage for their diversified applications in functional optoelectronic devices, considering that the preponderance of controlling the grain size and grain boundaries of the NCs dictates the optoelectronic properties of MHP NC thin films. These nano-/micro-architectures of assembled NCs can not only replace various elements of conventional devices but also create novel functions and stellar performances based on the unique properties of the NCs and highly ordered structures of the assembly. The emphasis is laid on the advancement of self-organization of colloidal MHP NCs to promote the construction of eminently ordered large domains of MHP NCs and on the integration of textured MHP NC thin films into functional devices. Moreover, colloidal MHP NCs showed superior optoelectronic properties in comparison with conventional metal chalcogenide NCs such as near unity PL quantum yields, innate tolerance to high density of defects, and MEG, making them promising materials for application in future optoelectronic techniques. The demonstrated process of MEG of colloidal MHP NCs is expected to be exploited in MEG solar cells with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 100% based on the high-energy photons that can produce multiple electron–hole pairs. For colloidal NC solar cells, the devices would greatly benefit from extracting charges from the thicker absorber layers due to the valuable MEG effects. The initial fabrication of PV devices with colloidal MHP NCs as the light absorbers have demonstrated PCE values reaching 13.43%, which is inferior to that of devices based on bulk MHPs (23.3%) but still shows great promise in encouraging further exploration of PV devices based on colloidal MHP NCs.193
Looking forward, there are numerous fundamental open questions regarding these intriguing nanostructured MHPs, in addition to unexampled applications that have not been revealed. Several key issues and challenges have been discussed in this review, which should receive more consideration in the coming future. First, the stability improvements of colloidal MHP NCs are recommended regarding the long-term stability of the materials, which determines the duration of the associated devices. In addition to achieving colloidal MHP NCs with high stability, surface passivation with appropriate ligands and charge transport between the NCs need to be well balanced to maximize the performance of the devices. All-inorganic MHP NCs have emerged as a pioneering family of materials that hold great promise of long-term stability for practical applications in optoelectronic devices compared with hybrid MHP NCs. The strategy of doping an element with a small radius has been proposed to release the distortion degree of the lattice, to hamper the halide migration, and to passivate the defects inside the MHP NCs, which shows pronounced potential in aggrandizing the stability of the resultant NCs.194 Despite the advances in synthesis, the electron-beam induced degradation of colloidal MHP NCs during TEM characterization challenges the direct visualization of NCs. Second, the material design of the colloidal MHP NCs is not optimized yet. The introduction of more complex compositions (mixed cation and mixed anion) into colloidal MHP NCs is anticipated to boost the performance of related PV devices to a higher level on account of recent trends in bulk MHP PVs that have witnessed PCEs exceeding 20%. Moreover, the synthesis progressions of lead-free perovskite NCs, including NCs based on Sn, Bi, Sb, and double perovskites, are far less developed compared to that of perovskites based on lead in terms of morphology control and stability. The optoelectronic properties of lead-free perovskite NCs need to be explored in a more detailed manner and their PL quantum yields should be enhanced. Additionally, metal ion doping, specifically Mn-doping, in colloidal MHP NCs should also be thoroughly explored, as this doping strategy has provided metal chalcogenide NCs with tailored optical properties and promising device performance.195–197 Third, a full comprehension of the nucleation and growth mechanisms of colloidal MHP NCs is lacking. Furthermore, the nature of interactions of the surface ligands with MHP NCs is also far from being understood. The preparations of hybrid organic–inorganic MHP NCs seem especially difficult to control, with less monodisperse NCs yielded compared to the all-inorganic MHP NCs. In spite of the satisfactory accomplishments in the morphology-controlled synthesis of inorganic MHP NCs, the understanding of morphology-dependent optoelectronic properties of MHP nanorods, nanoplatelets, and nanosheets is inadequate. Looking forward, the advanced preparations of colloidal MHP nanocubes, nanorods, and nanoplatelets would greatly benefit the developments of MHP solar cells with high performance.
Fabrications of PV devices with colloidal MHP NCs have just been launched with limited but copacetic success. With regard to upgrading the PV devices based on colloidal MHP NCs as the light absorptive materials for developing a practically viable technology, the current research attention needs to be focused on the thorough understanding of the interrelationship between the morphology of NCs and the PV performance, the development of trap-free MHP NCs with long-term stability, the improvement of stabilities of the respective devices, the deployment of novel strategies for producing compact and defect-free MHP NC films, and the contrivance of inventive device structures aimed at exploring the MHP NCs to their full potential. In summary, with more and more endeavors being conducted in this research field, it is expected that the opportunities and challenges described in this review will soon be overcome. A bright future of PV techniques based on colloidal MHP NCs can be as approachable as being at our fingertips.
