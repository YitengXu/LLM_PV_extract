    , Accepted 23rd November 2011First published on 16th December 2011AbstractA series of π-conjugated A–D–A–D–A-type oligothiophenes (1–3) comprising heterocyclic thieno[3,4-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TTDA) or thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) as the core and dicyanovinyl (DCV) or trifluoroacetyl (TFA) as terminal acceptor groups have been developed as red/near-IR absorbers. The resulting oligomers were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and thermal analysis. The low energy absorption band of these oligomers was located at 620–707 nm in solution and at 695–830 nm in thin films. Theoretical studies reveal that the insertion of the bicyclic nonclassical thiophenes to the conjugated backbone imposed partial quinoidal character to the resulting oligomers and thus reduced the band gap. HOMO–LUMO energies of 1–3 derived from electrochemical measurements were found to be suitable for the use as donor material in combination with fullerene-C60 as acceptor in planar heterojunction solar cells prepared by vacuum deposition. Such devices incorporating these low band gap oligomers exhibited high FF values up to 0.60, and power conversion efficiencies of up to 1.3% under air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra clearly showed the contribution of the low energy absorption to the overall photocurrent.
Introduction
During the last decade, the field of organic photovoltaics has seen a remarkable development from syntheses to device performance1–3 and provides bright prospects for the construction of low cost, lightweight and flexible energy sources. In particular, intensive research on small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) has been achieved resulting in a remarkable improvement of the device performance by judicious molecular design, morphology control and device optimization.4–7 Currently, SMOSCs prepared by vacuum processing achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 8.3% using dicyanovinylene (DCV)-substituted oligothiophenes (DCVnT) as donors and fullerene-C60 as an acceptor.8 Various donor–acceptor-substituted oligothiophenes have been developed as light-harvesting p-type semiconductors due to their good thermal stability which allows application of vacuum processing as an effective method for controlling the nano-scale morphology of thin films, thus improving the device performance.9–17 Planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells based on DCV5T/C60 have been reported with photovoltages as high as 1.0 V and PCEs of up to 4%.9,11,18 Very recently, the PCE has been improved to 5.2% in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells prepared by co-evaporation of a non-alkylated DCV5T as donor and C60 as acceptor.15
In order to cover an additional part of the solar emission spectrum and thus harvest more incident photons, it is advantageous to design compounds with strong absorptions in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region. Approaches towards such low band gap materials are the use of strong donor–acceptor push–pull systems or the incorporation of o-quinoidal heterocycles in conjugated systems.19,20 In this respect, various low band gap oligomers and polymers comprising proquinoid acceptor units such as thienothiadiazole (TTDA)21–23 or thienopyrazine (TP)22,24–26 have been reported.27–29 While TP proved to be an excellent building block for the development of such materials,26,30–40 the chemistry and application of nonclassical bicyclic thieno[3,4-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (TTDA) have not yet been explored in detail.21–23,41 In 1969, Bower and Schlessinger first reported the synthesis of a phenyl-capped TTDA unit by reaction of 3,4-dibenzoyl-1,2,5-thiadiazole with phosphorus pentasulfide, showing the longest absorption band at 558 nm in dichloromethane.42 Later in 1993, Tanaka and Yamashita synthesized a thiophene-substituted TTDA unit which absorbed at 618 nm in solution, resulting in a small band gap of 2.0 eV, being further reduced to only 0.9 eV (λmax = 934 nm) in the corresponding polymer.21–23 The design of π-conjugated oligomers or polymers containing electron-accepting fused-ring systems in the main chain leads to a strongly enforced quinoidal character of the ground state concomitant with a reduced band gap. Application of such narrow band gap polythiophene containing TTDA units in combination with the fullerene derivative PC61BM in solution-processed BHJ solar cells gave a very low PCE of only 0.1%.43 Very recently, Mikroyannidis et al. reported a PCE of 1.2% for TTDA-containing oligomers as donors and PC61BM as acceptor.44 Various TP containing polymers have been used as donors in OSCs with PC61BM or PC71BM as acceptor, showing a PCE of 0.5 to 1.5%.38,39,45–48 However, oligomers including a TP-moiety for OSCs have not been reported.
The objective of this study is to shift the absorption of oligothiophenes to the NIR region by insertion of TTDA or TP units as additional electron-accepting core moieties into the main chain. Dicyanovinyl (DCV) and trifluoroacetyl (TFA) groups are applied as terminal acceptor groups in order to tune the thermal and electro-optical properties and to assess useful information about structure–property relationships of the resulting A–D–A–D–A oligomers. Quantum chemical calculations will be used as a guide for the analysis of the electronic spectra and to derive molecular parameters such as ground-state geometry and the electron density distribution. The application of these materials in m-i-p (metal-intrinsic-p-doped)-type planar heterojunction solar cells prepared by vacuum processing is described.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
A Stille-type cross-coupling reaction of stannylated diethylthiophene 4 (ref. 16) and 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dinitrothiophene49 using Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst in dry THF gave dinitroterthiophene 5 in 81% yield (Scheme 1). Reduction of the nitro groups in 5 by SnCl2/EtOH or Pd/hydrogen was found to be difficult, resulting in low conversion yields. Finally, transformation of 5 to 3′,4′-diaminoterthiophene 6 was performed by Pd/C and hydrazine hydrate in ethanol (88% yield) and due to its low stability it was used without further purification. Reaction of amine 6 with thionylaniline and trimethylsilyl chloride in pyridine afforded trimeric thienothiadiazole 7 in a yield of 70%.

Bromination of terthiophene 7 using NBS followed by a Stille-type cross-coupling reaction with 2-stannylthiophene afforded TTDA-containing pentamer 9 in 72% yield (Scheme 1). Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of quinquethiophene 9 afforded bis-aldehyde 10 in a yield of 33%. The use of excess formylating reagent or prolonged reaction time did not improve the product yield. Knoevenagel condensation of dialdehyde 10 with malononitrile and piperidine in 1,2-dichloroethane gave the target A–D–A–D–A oligothiophene 1 in a yield of 87%.
We further introduced TFA acceptor moieties at quinquethiophene 9 in order to study the influence of fluorine substituents on the thermal stability and device performance. TFA-substituted TTDA-pentamer 2 was prepared in 65% yield by reaction of quinquethiophene 9 with trifluoroacetic anhydride under microwave irradiation (Scheme 1).
Synthesis of DCV-terminated thienopyrazine (TP) oligomer 3 is outlined in Scheme 2. Twofold thiophene-substituted thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine 11 was obtained in 68% yield by condensation of diaminoterthiophene 6 with benzile in methanol. Bromination of 11 using NBS in chloroform and acetic acid afforded trimer 12 in 85% yield. Boronic ester 14 as a coupling reagent was prepared in 87% yield by protection of thiophene-2-carbaldehyde as dioxolane (13, 63% yield),50 followed by lithiation and subsequent quenching with 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane at −78 °C. Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction of dibromoterthiophene 12 and boronic ester 14 gave quinquethiophene 15 in 89% yield. The dioxolane groups were deprotected by using catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid in THF and water affording dialdehyde 16 in 54%. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of pentamer 16 with malononitrile in the presence of piperidine furnished DCV-substituted TP-oligomer 3 in 66% yield. All compounds were fully characterized by different spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis.

Thermal properties
The thermal stability of organic materials is one of the important parameters for device fabrication. Therefore, thermal properties of 1–3 were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 as depicted in Fig. 1. TGA analysis revealed that the onset temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) of 1, 2 and 3 are 312, 324 and 365 °C, respectively. This result indicates that the thermal stability of the oligomers could be critical for the vacuum processing during device fabrication. DCV-substituted TTDA-derivative 1 showed a moderate sublimation yield (∼20%) since during the sublimation process most of the material was decomposed. To overcome this thermal instability, the DCV groups were replaced with TFA units in TTDA-pentamer 2 to lower the sublimation temperature and hence reduce thermal decomposition.51 The melting temperatures (Tm) of 1–3 determined by DSC were 306, 240 and 341 °C, respectively. In DSC, DCV-oligomers 1 and 3 showed a strong exothermic peak immediately after melting, while no such behavior was observed for TFA derivative 2. It has been reported in the literature that the non-classical TTDA heterocyclic unit undergoes an intermolecular Diels–Alder reaction with various dienophiles at high temperature.42,52,53 However, we were not able to assign the follow-up products of 1 and 3 after melting on the basis of NMR spectral analysis. Thus, we suspect that the compounds reacted in the melt and underwent decomposition.

Spectroscopic studies
Pentamer 9 incorporating a TTDA unit showed the lowest energy absorption maximum at 666 nm with two additional bands at 313 and 390 nm (Fig. 2). The higher energy absorption bands could be correlated to the extended π-conjugative path in the quinquethiophene backbone (λmax = 384 nm). The insertion of aldehyde units does not significantly affect the lowest energy absorption band of 10 (669 nm), while, due to the electron accepting character of the aldehyde groups and extension of the conjugated π-system, a 57 nm red-shift was observed for the higher energy absorption band of 10 (447 nm). Similarly, aldehyde functionalized TP oligomer 16 showed the lowest energy absorption maximum at 573 nm with two additional bands at 395 and 338 nm. The lowest energy absorption maximum of 10 is 96 nm red-shifted compared to that of 16, suggesting that the TTDA unit is a stronger electron acceptor than TP.

UV-Vis spectra of compounds 9, 10 and 16 measured in dichloromethane solution. 

Fig. 3 depicts absorption spectra of oligomers 1–3 measured in dichloromethane and in thin films and the data are summarized in Table 1. Transformation of the aldehyde groups to dicyanovinyl (DCV) in 1 and 3 further red-shifted the lowest energy absorption band to 707 nm for 1 and 620 nm for 3, ascribed to the stronger electron accepting character of the DCV groups. On the other hand, a smaller red-shift was observed for the trifluoroacetyl-substituted pentamer 2 (λmax = 675 nm), when compared to oligomer 9 or dialdehyde 10. The absorption spectra of 1–3 covered the entire visible spectral region extending from 300 up to 850 nm. In comparison to DCV5T9,14 (λmax = 507 nm, ε = 51000 L mol−1 cm−1), pentamers 1–3 incorporating TTDA or TP units showed a strong red-shift of the longest wavelength absorption band, while the molar extinction coefficients of 1–3 were lowered by a factor of nearly two. The lowest energy absorption maximum of oligomer 1 was red-shifted by 32 nm relative to that of 2 and 88 nm to that of TP-based oligomer 3. The optical absorption data reveal that these oligomers are characterized by a small HOMO–LUMO separation, which could be the result of a significant degree of intramolecular charge transfer from the thienyl donors to the central electron accepting TTDA or TP unit. Furthermore, the high-energy absorption transitions between 300 and 520 nm can be assigned to multiple excitations arising from the combination of the D–A chromophore in the main π-conjugated chain. In solution, the optical band gaps (Egopt) for 1–3 estimated from the low energy absorption onset were 1.47, 1.54 and 1.59 eV, respectively, which are significantly lower than that of DCV5T (∼2.0 eV).9,14,15

 Fig. 3  
Absorption spectra of compounds 1–3 in (a) solution and in (b) solid state, 30 nm thin films prepared by vacuum evaporation. 
The absorption spectrum of oligomer 1 in thin films was extended to over 950 nm with a maximum at 830 nm (Fig. 3b). In addition, the second broad absorption band at 512 nm in the solid state was more intense than in the solution spectrum (516 nm). However, the absorption maximum of TFA derivative 2 in thin films was red-shifted by only 23 nm relative to that obtained in solution. This smaller red-shift of the low energy absorption band of 2 in thin films was rationalized with the weaker acceptor strength of the terminal TFA units relative to that of the DCV groups in oligomer 1. In thin films, TP-oligomer 3 showed an absorption maximum at 700 nm with an onset extending beyond 850 nm. The strong bathochromic shifts of the low energy absorption bands of 1 and 3 in thin films compared to the solution spectra are likely due to strong intermolecular π–π-stacking in the solid state. Here it should be noted that the strong red-shift (Δλ = 130 nm) of the low energy absorption band of oligomer 1 compared to that of 3 is due to the stronger acceptor strength of the central TTDA unit compared to the TP moiety. The optical band gaps of these oligomers in thin films are in the range of 1.2 to 1.4 eV.
We noted light-induced photodegradation of thienopyrazine 3 and further studied this process. It has been demonstrated that thienopyrazine-substituted compounds rapidly degrade when exposed to UV light and air at the same time and was speculated to the possible cleavage of CN double bonds.54Fig. 4 depicts the UV-Vis absorption spectra of 3 in dichloromethane solution and in thin films recorded over time when exposed to air and sunlight.
 Fig. 4  
Absorption spectra of compound 3 in (a) dichloromethane solution ([c] = 10−5 mol·L−1) and in (b) solid state, 10 nm thin film prepared by vacuum evaporation. 
When exposed to sunlight under ambient atmosphere, the longest wavelength absorption of 3 at 620 nm rapidly decreased in solution, while a new absorption band appeared with a maximum at 420 nm. After 12 hours of irradiation this transformation was completed (Fig. 4a). In the solid state and in the absence of oxygen, no change in absorption was observed after one hour of sunlight irradiation. After exposure to ambient atmosphere, degradation was observed, yet in a significantly lower rate than in solution. In addition, the change in the absorption profile in the solid state is characterized by a moderate decrease of the longest wavelength absorption together with slight broadening of the absorption band in the region from 350 to 500 nm and an additional absorption at around 460 nm, which would correspond to the new band at 420 nm in solution (Fig. 4a). MALDI-TOF and 1H-NMR analyses of 3 after light exposure showed multiple peaks due to photodegradation which could not be unequivocally assigned to possible follow-up products.
Electrochemical characterization

Fig. 5 depicts cyclic voltammograms of oligomers 1–3 measured in dichloromethane solution containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. Pentamer 9 showed a reversible one-electron reduction associated with the TTDA unit and two reversible one-electron oxidation processes for the oligothiophene backbone (Fig. 5a). The introduction of the aldehyde groups in 10 resulted in a slight positive shift of the oxidation potentials (ΔEox = 90 and 130 mV) when compared to 9 and the appearance of a second reduction wave at −1.66 V related to the electron accepting aldehyde groups. The replacement of the TTDA unit by TP in 16 has no influence on the oxidation potential, while the reduction potentials shifted to more negative values (ΔEox = 250 and 100 mV). This negative shift in the reduction potentials further supports the weaker acceptor strength of TP when compared to the TTDA unit.

Cyclic voltammogram of TTDA derivatives 9, 10 and TP derivative 16 (a) and of pentamers 1, 2 and 3 (b) (1 × 10−3 mol·L−1) in DCM/TBAPF6 (0.1 M). 
The investigated compounds 1–3 each showed two fully reversible one-electron oxidation waves, which can be assigned to the oxidation of the oligothiophene backbone. At cathodic potentials, we observed a reversible wave between −1.2 and −1.36 V (vs.Fc/Fc+) corresponding to a two-electron reduction of the TTDA/TP units and a quasi-reversible reduction wave between −1.86 and −2.08 V associated with the one-electron reduction of the DCV and TFA groups, respectively. The results indicate the formation of stable radical cations, dications, radical anions, and dianions. Compared to DCV5T, a negative shift of the oxidation waves and a positive shift of the reduction waves were observed for these new oligomers.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of all oligomers were determined from the onset values of the first oxidation and reduction waves using the standard approximation that the Fc/Fc+ HOMO energy level is at −5.1 eV vs. vacuum.55 These data are listed in Table 2. The low band gap materials 1–3 studied here showed strong positive shifts of the reduction potentials and consequently lower LUMO energy levels compared to those of DCV5T, demonstrating that the TTDA/TP units behave as strong electron acceptors. It has been reported that upon attachment of electron-withdrawing moieties at the terminal α-positions of linear π-conjugated chains, the relative HOMO and LUMO energies shift toward lower energy values with respect to the unsubstituted system. The LUMO energies are more affected than those of the HOMOs and thus the band gaps are lowered.15,56 However, the determined orbital energies for 1–3 revealed a different trend. The insertion of o-quinoidal TTDA/TP units in the core of an oligomer stabilizes the LUMO, but destabilizes the HOMO energy at the same time, thus reducing the band gap to a large extent relative to DCV5T (Fig. 6). The low-lying LUMO energies of these oligomers could lead to problems in electron transfer to C60.
 Fig. 6  HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the investigated oligomers 1–3 deduced from electrochemical data and compared to C60. The HOMO and LUMO energy values of C60 estimated from the onset of the oxidation and reduction potentials are taken from ref. 57. 
The ground-state geometry and the electron density distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of 1–3 have been fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP 6-31G*) and semi-empirical methods (Austin Model 1, AM1). The MO distributions of the frontier orbitals from the latter method are shown in Fig. 7 including DCV5T for comparison. It has been hypothesized that the band gap of a conjugated system can be reduced either by incorporation of suitable donor and acceptor units or by lowering the degree of bond-length alternation (BLA) (defined as the difference between average lengths of C–C single and double bonds in a conjugated path).58,59 It has also been proposed that the introduction of appropriate quinoid structures into the aromatic backbone can minimize the BLA and may reduce the band gap accordingly.58,60,61 The increasing double-bond character between the repeating units of a conjugated system can be accomplished by making the quinoidal structure energetically more favorable.
 Fig. 7  Electron density distribution of the frontier orbitals in derivatives 1–3 and DCV5T obtained from quantum chemical calculations (carbon atoms in black, fluorine in light blue, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, sulfur in yellow and hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity reasons). 
Yamashita and co-workers reported that after the substitution of the conjugated systems by terminal acceptor units56 or by attaching nonclassical heterocyclic cores,23,62 the aromatic character of the backbone changes to a partially quinoid-like character in which the degree of BLA was significantly reduced. The semiempirical analysis of the overall BLA for oligomers 1–3 revealed a strong reduction from aromatic quinquethiophene (0.039 Å) to DCV5T (0.032 Å) to a value of 0.021 Å for 1 and 2 and 0.023 for 3. Thus, the bicyclic nonclassical thiophene imposes a partial quinoidal character to the conjugated backbone, leading to a more delocalized molecular structure. The same trend is obtained from DFT calculations. The decrease of BLA can be directly correlated to the influence of, on the one hand, the TTDA/TP acceptor moiety and, on the other hand, the terminal acceptor groups on the extended π-system of the molecules and is the origin of the red-shifted absorption band (vide supra). The electron density of the HOMO for all molecules is distributed not only on the oligothiophene backbone, but also on the central TTDA/TP-acceptor moiety, while that of the LUMO is mainly localized on the central acceptor units and the adjacent thiophene rings. The phenyl rings attached to pyrazine in 3 are strongly twisted out of plane, hence do not contribute to the frontier molecular orbital distribution. Although the delocalization of the exciton can be favored by the decrease in BLA in 1–3, the localization of the electron density on the central TTDA/TP unit in the excited state (LUMO) could act as a trap for excitons. This could further affect the device performance (vide infra).
Solar cell performance
The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of some of these low band gap oligomers are suitable for the application of these materials as donors in organic solar cells when using C60 as electron acceptor. As the compounds are stable in the solid state, m-i-p-type planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells were fabricated by vacuum evaporation. Fig. 8 shows J–V curves of SMOSCs using 6 nm thick layers of 1–3 as donors and C60 as an acceptor. The device structure with optimized layer sequences consisted of ITO/C60 (15 nm)/1–3 (6 nm)/Di-NPB (5 nm)/Di-NPB:NDP9 (40 nm, 5 wt%)/ZnPc:NDP9 (10 nm, 3 wt%)/Au (50 nm). By using these highly optimized device structures, it enables us to investigate the effect of the donor/active layer on power conversion efficiencies. In these device structures the hole transport layers (HTLs) have to be chosen in order to match the energy levels of the active layers with the Fermi level of the metal electrodes. By using p-doped HTL N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(4′-(N,N-bis(naphth-1-yl)-amino)-biphenyl-4-yl)-benzidine (Di-NPB) we can adjust the HOMO of the HTL to the HOMO of the donor materials (oligomers 1–3), avoiding energetic barriers and assuring a good hole transport (due to the doping). For p-doping, NPD9 (Novaled AG, Dresden) was used between the HTL and the Au top electrode, to facilitate charge extraction. The intrinsic HTL was introduced to avoid direct contact between the active layer and the doped HTL that otherwise could lead to quenching of excitons by the dopants. Furthermore, by using p-doped ZnPc we assure a good ohmic contact to the Au top electrode. Thus, we can really analyze the influence of the donor material at the C60 interface in a device that is highly reproducible and with energetically adjusted HOMO levels. Table 3 presents the photovoltaic data of the corresponding devices.

 Fig. 8  (a) J–V characteristics of m-i-p-type planar heterojunction solar cells under standard AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2). (b) EQE spectra of pentamers 1 and 3. 
All compounds showed moderate short-circuit current density (JSC) values between 2.6 and 3.2 mA cm−2. This could be ascribed to the lack of transport of the photo-generated electrons and holes at the D–A interface, resulting in significant recombination and low values of JSC and FF. It should be noted that the FF value obtained with oligomer 3-based devices (FF = 0.60) is among the highest values reported for small molecule solar cells. All the studied materials displayed as well moderate Voc values in the range of 0.68 to 0.77 V. This is due to the fact that VOC is limited by the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor,63,64 restricting the overall device efficiencies (η), which were determined to be 0.8, 1.1 and 1.3% for oligomers 1–3, respectively. To ensure an efficient charge separation, it has been suggested that a minimum LUMO(D)–LUMO(A) offset of about 0.3–0.4 eV is necessary.38,64 The difference between the LUMO of these oligomers and the LUMO of C60 is only about 0.27–0.16 eV (obtained from Fig. 6), which indeed appears to be insufficient for efficient electron transfer at the donor/acceptor interface from the excited state of these low band gap oligomers. Therefore, only a small fraction of the absorbed photons could be dissociated into charge carriers that can reach the electrodes under influence of the internal electric field. Fig. 8b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices based on pentamers 1, 2 and 3. Compounds 2 and 3 display broad EQE spectra covering from 400 up to 850 nm region, which is extended up to 900 nm for oligomer 1. The result is also consistent with their absorption spectrum in thin films, thus showing the contribution of the CT-band to the EQE and JSC. The lower JSC values obtained with these devices are also in good agreement with the lower molar extinction coefficients of oligomers 1–3 and low EQEs over the entire visible light region.
Conclusions
We have developed novel conjugated A–D–A–D–A-type oligothiophenes with thienothiadiazole/thienopyrazine as core and dicyanovinylene/trifluoroacetyl as terminal acceptor units. The obtained materials showed strong absorption down to the near IR-region with narrow band gaps down to 1.5 eV in solution and about 1.2 eV in thin films. All compounds showed broad absorption bands ranging from 300 to 850 nm. Substitution of dicyanovinyl units with electron withdrawing trifluoroacetyl groups resulted in a highly stable compound, thus reducing the thermal decomposition of the material during vacuum sublimation. The insertion of TTDA/TP units reduces the bond length alternation along the π-conjugated backbone and leads to a more delocalized i.e. partially quinoidal character. The results show that the lowering of the band gap in these A–D–A–D–A systems with respect to the standard DCV5T comes not only from the partial stabilization of the LUMO energy but also from a similar destabilization of the HOMO energy. Despite their low molar extinction coefficients, m-i-p-type photovoltaic devices based on the new materials as donors with fullerene-C60 as the acceptor showed a high fill factor of up to 0.60 and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in the range of 0.8 to 1.3%. The values reported here represent one of the best performances among low-band gap conjugated small molecules. The obtained PCEs can be explained in part due to the lower molar extinction coefficients of these oligomers and to the low-lying LUMO energy levels of the donor, which provides an insufficient driving force for electron transfer from the LUMO of the donor to the LUMO of the acceptor. Increasing the molar absorptivity in the low energy region by attaching suitable building blocks and at the same time maintaining appropriate HOMO/LUMO energy levels might be a possible way to obtain better JSC and efficiency values, and work to this end is in progress in our laboratory.
Experimental

Instrumentations. 

NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 (1H NMR: 500 MHz, 13C NMR: 125 MHz) or an Avance 400spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz), unless mentioned otherwise at 25 °C. Chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in parts per million using residual solvent protons (1H NMR, δH = 7.26 for CDCl3, δH = 5.32 for CD2Cl2, δH = 5.93 for CD2Cl4; 13C NMR, δC = 77.0 for CDCl3, δC = 53.8 for CD2Cl2, δC = 74.2 for CD2Cl4) as internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet) and m (multiplet). The assignments are Ar–H (H-atoms of aromatic systems) and Th–H (H-atoms of thiophene rings). Melting points were determined using a Büchi B-545 apparatus and were not corrected. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar Vario EL (University of Ulm) and a Carlo Erba 1104 (University of Stuttgart). Thin layer chromatography was carried out on aluminium plates, pre-coated with silica gel, Merck Si60 F254. Preparative column chromatography was performed on glass columns packed with silica gel, Merck Silica 60, particle size 40–43 μm. CI and EI mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT SSQ-7000 or a Varian Saturn 2000GC-MS, MALDI-TOF on a Bruker Daltonics Reflex III. UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded in 1 cm cuvettes with Merck Uvasol grade solvents on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. Tetrahydrofurane (Merck) was dried under reflux over sodium/benzophenone (Merck) and dichloromethane (Merck) over calcium hydride (Merck). All synthetic steps were carried out under argon atmosphere. N-Bromo succinimide (NBS), NaOH and K2CO3 were purchased from Merck, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, trifurylphosphine (TFP) and nBuLi (1.6 mol L−1 in hexane) from Acros, tri-n-butyltin chloride and tri-n-methyltin chloride from Aldrich. Hyperchem (Austin Model 1) and Gaussian 09 (AM1 and B3LYP/6-31G*) software were used to perform the geometry optimization for all oligomers.


Solar cell fabrications. 

N,N′-Di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-diphenyl-benzidine (Di-NPB) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), doped with proprietary compounds NDP2 or NDP9 of Novaled GmbH (Dresden), were used as p-doped hole transport layers. Doping concentrations of Di-NPB and ZnPc were 2–5 wt%. C60 and ZnPc have been provided by Alfa Aesar and Di-NPB by Sensient Imaging Technologies. Except the oligothiophenes, all materials were cleaned at least twice by thermal gradient sublimation before evaporation. The organic layers and metal contacts were thermally deposited in an ultra high vacuum system (“UFO”, Bestec GmbH) at 10−8 to 10−7 mbar through shadow masks onto semitransparent indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (Thin Film Devices Inc., sheet resistance < 30 Ω sq−1) without breaking the vacuum. Ceramic or graphite crucibles were used as sublimation sources (Creaphys GmbH, Reinhardtsgrimma), temperatures were set by a Eurotherm controller and film thicknesses were determined by quartz crystal monitors (Leybold Inficon Inc.). Substrates were cleaned using detergent, acetone, and ethanol. The active area of the solar cells was 6.4 mm2. In order to precisely determine the solar cell efficiencies, all three cells were measured with an aperture mask of 2.76 mm2. J–V characteristics were measured using a Source measurement Unit (Keithley SMU 236) in an N2-filled glovebox without exposing the samples to air. Illumination was provided by a sun simulator SOL 1200 (Hoehnle) with an intensity of 127 mW cm−2, which was calibrated using an outdoor reference cell provided by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Freiburg). The mismatch between the spectrum of our sun simulator and the AM1.5 spectrum was taken into account when calculating the power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were recorded using a custom-made setup utilizing a xenon arc lamp, a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone) and a lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery 7265 DSP). A silicon reference diode (Hamamatsu S1337) was used to calibrate the setup. Organic films for spectral analysis were vapor deposited onto quartz substrates under ultra high vacuum with deposition rates of about 0.1 Å s−1. A commercial Shimadzu UV-2101/3101 spectrophotometer was used for absorption measurements. Luminescence spectra were recorded using a Spex FluoroMAX with separated monochromators for excitation and luminescence light.
