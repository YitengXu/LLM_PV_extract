    , Accepted 13th March 2020First published on 17th March 2020AbstractNatural microalgae (NM, Scenedesmus) cultivated by utilization of exhaust gas from a municipal solid waste combustion power plant were used for the biofuel production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The high-ash NM underwent acid-washing to obtain deashing microalgae (DA). HTL experiments were carried out at different temperatures from 260 °C to 340 °C with NM and DA. Products derived from NM and DA were examined by various techniques in order to identify the influence of the ash on the hydrothermal decomposition behavior. The results show that the ash inhibits the transformation of microalgae. The bio-oil yield including heavy oil and light oil is in the range of 17.59–22.09% for NM and 24.30–31.14% for DA, respectively. Calcium carbonate in the ash promotes deamination, resulting in an increase in the relative content of ketones in the NM-derived light oil. The concentration of NH4+ in the aqueous phase derived from NM is in the range of 1373–1860 mg L−1, and PO43− is undetected due to the precipitation reaction between phosphorus and calcium ions. The HHV values of NM-derived hydrochars are low, ranging from 8.83 MJ kg−1 to 9.88 MJ kg−1, compared with those of DA-derived hydrochars,. For natural microalgae, the deashing pretreatment before HTL is of great significance for improving the biocrude yield and quality, as well as the biomass conversion efficiency, nitrogen utilization and the hydrochar quality.
1. Introduction
Biofuels are environmentally-friendly and renewable energy resources that can replace fossil fuels to a great extent.1 Microalgae are considered as one of the most promising resources for third generation biofuel production due to their high photosynthesis efficiency, fast growth rate, strong environment adaptability, high lipid content etc.2 Compared to various technologies of thermochemical and biochemical conversions, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) might be the most suitable one to treat wet algae biomass, which ends up with an excellent product biocrude similar to fossil oil.3 HTL uses wet feedstock and avoids high temperature operation and energy consumption for feedstock drying.4–6 HTL facilitates the separation and reuse of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other minerals as well as polar organic compounds, which is beneficial to the cultivation of microalgae and bioenergy plantation.7,8 In addition to lipids, the other two major components in microalgae, proteins and carbohydrates, are also converted into biocrude during HTL, which may raise the biodiesel yield up to 50% and even higher.9 HTL usually proceeds in a water medium at a moderate temperature of 200–380 °C and a high pressure of 5–25 MPa.10 At an elevated temperature and pressure, the main polymers such as lipids, proteins and carbohydrates are decomposed by hydrolysis, fragmentation, condensation, isomerization, cyclization and polymerization.11–14 The chemical components of the bio-oil derived from microalgae using HTL contain acids, alkenes, ketones, esters, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds,15 which have the potential to be used as biofuels and value-added products. Besides, the aqueous phase with the highest volume contains some nutrients.16 Applying the aqueous phase to microalgae cultivation is the most promising approach due to the recycling of nutrients without additional processes.17,18 The recycling of the aqueous phase could help overcome one of the identified economic barriers to scale-up of microalgae production, and results in environmental benefits.19,20
The differences in composition of microalgae strains have a significant effect on both the yield and composition of bio-oil.1 The main components of microalgae are lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Through HTL, the high lipid-containing microalgae result in a higher yield of bio-oil in comparison to that of protein and carbohydrate containing microalgae.21 However, microalgae grown under natural conditions generally have a high productivity with a low lipid content.22 Many studies have reported about the HTL of the low-lipid content microalgae collected from different water environments such as waste water and an eutrophic environment.5,23,24 Neveux et al.13 reported that the bio-oil yield of six different microalgae with a low lipid content of 1.9% to 10.4% and a high ash content of 17.8% to 36.6% is in the range of 9.7–26.2%, corresponding to energy recovery efficiency of 30.6–55.7%. Huang et al.5 investigated the decomposition behavior of microalgae with a low lipid content (0.5%) and a high ash content (28.90%), and found that the maximum bio-oil yield is 21.10% and a high portion of nitrogen is enriched into the aqueous phase. Das et al.17 reported the feasibility of substituting 50% nutrients by the aqueous phase. Aida et al.25 found that the yields of nitrogen and phosphorous recovered from the aqueous phase are in the range of 38–100% and 57–99%, respectively, and ammonia has the maximum yield of nitrogen containing compounds in the aqueous phase. Liu et al.19 proposed a closed-loop system for fusel alcohol production from microalgae biomass with integrated nutrient recycling.
In the present study, natural microalgae (NM) are grown beside a municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion power plant, with only solar energy and carbon dioxide exhausted from the combustion plant to achieve zero carbon emissions. The low lipid content natural microalgae have a high ash content, which may have a significant impact on the yield and properties of the bio-oil obtained using HTL. The high ash content in microalgae plays a negative role in the bio-oil yield due to less organic matters and restriction on the interaction between biomass and the reaction medium.10 On the other hand, the ash has a complex composition with large amounts of minerals and metal salts which might act as a catalyst during the HTL process. Chen et al.26 reported that the contents of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen of the derived bio-oil decreased with an increase of the ash content in microalgae, however, there is no significant change in the bio-oil yield. Xu et al.27 reported a certain synergistic effect on the improvement of biocrude oil yield and quality when sewage sludge was added into microalgae (Chlorella), and the bio-oil yield is improved by 4.7% in contrast to the corresponding theoretical yields. Tian et al.28 evaluated the effects of the operation parameters on the products derived from a microalga with high ash and low lipid contents, and found that the highest bio-oil yield (18.4%, daf) is achieved at 300 °C and 60 min, which highly depends on the protein content. Chen et al.29 reported that ash could promote denitrification and catalyze the formation of hydrocarbons, and the reasonable quality and quantity of bio-oil can be obtained with the ash content of feedstock less than 40%. In view of the influence of ash on the hydrothermal characteristics of microalgae, it is necessary to study the NM cultivated with the exhaust gas of MSW combustion plants with low lipid and high ash contents in order to better clean the exhaust gas, improve the plant energy efficiency and achieve the carbon recycling.
In order to explore the effect of ash on the decomposition behavior of NM during the HTL process, deashing microalgae (DA) are prepared with acid-washing. The physicochemical characteristics of the products derived from NM and DA are comprehensively analyzed by various techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the components in the oil phase and ion chromatography (IC) to determine the concentration of ions in the aqueous phase. Hydrochars are analyzed by different methods to understand the physicochemical characteristics. Hence, this study can provide useful information for the utilization of microalgae cultivated with the exhaust gas from a MSW combustion plant.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Feedstock
NM were provided by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. They were collected from a MSW combustion power plant in Sweden. It was milled to particle sizes of 0.125–0.18 mm, and dried at 105 °C for 12 h in an oven. The deashing natural microalgae (DA) were obtained by washing NM with 4 mol L−1 HCl at 25 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, DA were centrifuged several times and washed with deionized water until the pH reached 7. Then the wet DA were frozen at −55 °C to remove the moisture, and stored in a desiccator at ambient temperature.
The results of NM and DA fuel analyses are given in Table 2, and the ash composition is shown in Fig. 8. The ash contents of NM and DA are 44.66% and 14.98%, respectively. There are large amounts of insoluble components in the ash. The major inorganic components in the NM ash are CaO, SiO2, SO3 and Cl2O, while SiO2 is the dominating component in the DA ash as shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, most of the minerals such as Ca, K, Cl etc. are removed after acid treatment. The XRD patterns of feedstock are shown in Fig. 7. NM contain some minerals such as CaCO3, SiO2 and NaCl, while DA contain only SiO2. This indicates that most of the minerals (such as CaCO3 and NaCl) were removed by deashing pretreatment.
2.2 Hydrothermal liquefaction experiment
The HTL experiment was conducted in a 350 mL autoclave (Model 4566, Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). 10 g feedstock of NM or DA was mixed with 100 mL distilled water and then added into the autoclave. Then, the autoclave was sealed and argon was injected to remove the air. Argon was continuously injected to set the initial pressure to 1 MPa in order to keep the water in the liquid state during the hydrothermal process. Each experiment was performed at the desired temperatures of 260 °C, 300 °C and 340 °C for 1 h with stirring at 200 rpm min−1. After the experiment, the autoclave was cooled to ambient temperature by circulating water. Temperature and pressure in the initial and final states were recorded to calculate the gaseous product yield by the ideal gas law. The gaseous products were collected in a gas bag. The residual products were separated by vacuum filtration. The liquid phase was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) to obtain an aqueous phase and a DCM-soluble phase. Acetone is an effective solvent and many researchers have used it to remove the deposits on hydrochars.30 Therefore, acetone was used to wash away the products left in the device, and the acetone mixture was applied to continue washing the solid phase remaining on the filter paper. The DCM-soluble phase and acetone-soluble phase were evaporated to remove the organic solvents. The DCM-soluble product and the acetone-soluble products were defined as light oil (LO) and heavy oil (HO), respectively. The oil phase was sealed and stored in the refrigerator for further analysis. The rest of the solid products is defined as hydrochar (HC) and dried in the oven at 105 °C. Moreover, NM-X and DA-X (X refers to the temperature) represent the products derived from NM and DA at different temperatures, respectively. Each experiment was repeated more than three times. The scheme of the recovery procedure is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3 Analysis methods
Product yields are calculated based on the dry ash-free weight (daf) of the feedstock using the following equations: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)
For microalgae feedstock and the derived hydrochar, ultimate analysis was made with a CHNS elementary analyzer (Vario Micro cube EA-1, Germany). The elemental compositions (C, H and N) of bio-oil were determined using the elementar EL-2 (Germany) according to the previous literature.31,32 The higher heating value (HHV) of the hydrochar was calculated according to the Dulong formula: HHV = 0.3383C + 1.422(H − O/8), where C, H, and O are the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen mass percentages of the dry sample.29 Proximate analysis was made according to the Chinese National Standard (GB/T 28731-2012) to determine the moisture, volatile matter (VM), ash (A) and fixed carbon (FC) contents. The mineral contents of the ash in the sample were examined using an X-Ray Fluorescence system (XRF, Eagle III, Edax Inc., USA). Three points were selected for each sample and the relative content of metal oxides was the average of the three test results. An X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD, Empyrean, PANalytical B.V. Inc., Netherlands) equipped with a Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.1541 nm, 40 kV) was utilized to observe the crystal composition and structure. The XRD measurement was performed within the 2θ range of 10–80° with a step size of 0.2° s−1. The gas products were determined using a micro-gas chromatography system (Micro-GC 3000A, Agilent Technologies, USA). The composition of the biocrude oil was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, HP7890 series GC with a HP5975 MS detector) with a capillary column (Agilent: HP-5MD, 19091s-433; 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm d.f.). The carrier gas was helium with a pressure of 50 kPa at 1 mL min−1. Both injection temperature and interface temperature were set at 280 °C, and the temperature of the ion source was 250 °C. The temperature program: 50 °C → 300 °C (5 °C min−1, hold 8 min) → 330 °C (5 °C min−1, hold 1 min). Hence, the total program time was 65 min. The scan range of the mass spectra (m/z) was 35–550. The compounds were identified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology library (NIST2011). The concentrations of NH4+, NO3−, NO2− and PO43− in the aqueous phase were analyzed with an ion chromatograph (881 Compact IC Pro, Metrohm, Switzerland). The surface functional groups of each sample were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (VERTEX 70, Bruker Inc., Germany). Each sample was mixed with KBr with 1:100 (mass ratio), and scanned from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Product distribution
The product yields and conversion efficiency (on the daf basis) of HTL for NM and DA at different reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. 2. As the temperature increases, the conversion efficiency increases from 73.12% to 75.34% for NM, and from 76.14% to 81.13% for DA, respectively. The lower conversion efficiency of NM indicates that the ash inhibits the transformation of microalgae, likely because the ash covers the surface of the organic matter, limits the heat and mass transfer and thus slows down the thermal chemical reaction between the organic matter and subcritical water.10
 Fig. 2  Product yields of NM and DA, respectively, at different temperatures. 
For both NM and DA, the yields of the gaseous products and aqueous phase increase, whereas the yields of other products, i.e. hydrochar, heavy oil and light oil, decrease with increasing temperature. These trends are consistent with some previous studies,5,29,33,34 which can be explained by the fact that a higher temperature could provide a higher activation energy to destroy chemical bonds to form corresponding monomers by dehydration and decarboxylation reactions.35 The bio-oil yield including heavy oil and light oil is in the range of 17.59–22.09% for NM and 24.30–31.14% for DA, respectively. The similar bio-oil yields derived from high-ash content microalgae are reported in previous literature.13,28 The highest yield of products were obtained for both NM and DA in the aqueous phase. After deashing pretreatment, the yields of hydrochars and the aqueous phase decrease, accompanied by the increase in bio-oil yields. This phenomenon suggests that deashing pretreatment could promote the conversion of microalgae to bio-oil.
3.2 Gaseous products
The compositions of gaseous products are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that CO2 is the dominant component with the volume concentration higher than 90%. This phenomenon is commonly observed in other HTL experiments.35,36 The formation of CO2 is attributed to the decarboxylation of fatty acid.32 The content of CO2 derived from DA is higher than that derived from NM at the same temperature, suggesting that decarboxylation of DA during HTL is stronger. As the temperature increases, the content of CO2 decreases, while the content of H2 increases. Interestingly, the content of H2 derived from NM is higher than that of DA at the same reaction temperature. This might be due to the catalysis of ash on the steam reforming process.37 In addition, the content of CH4 also increases at elevated temperature due to the enhancement of methanation reactions. Differently, the content of CO decreases with increasing temperature for NM, while CO derived from DA presents the opposite trend, indicating that the ash restrains the dehydration reaction.

3.3 Aqueous phase
The aqueous phase derived from microalgae using HTL is often found to be rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, along with other minerals favoring the growth of microalgae.38 The nutrients in the aqueous phase derived from NM and DA were investigated by measuring the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus ions. Fig. 4 shows the concentrations of phosphate, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite in the aqueous phase. The main inorganic-N in the aqueous phase for both NM and DA is NH4+. The concentration of NH4+ increases from 1373 mg L−1 to 1860 mg L−1 for NM, and from 2724 mg L−1 to 3552 mg L−1 DA when the temperature increases from 260 °C to 340 °C. NH4+ is mainly derived from the deamination of proteins. The NH4+ concentration in the aqueous phase derived from NM is much lower than that of DA, suggesting that the ash obviously inhibits the deamination reaction. However, the NO3− concentrations of NM and DA have almost no difference, and they remain at a fairly low level over the temperature range employed, indicating that NO3− might be mainly from the ash. PO43− is only detected in the aqueous phase derived from DA, and the concentration of PO43− decreases from 614 mg L−1 to 127 mg L−1 as the temperature increases from 260 °C to 340 °C. This phenomenon is attributed to the precipitation reaction between phosphorus and calcium ions that forms the calcium phosphate solid,25 which is demonstrated in Section 3.5.1. The presence of calcium in the ash promotes the transfer of phosphorus to the solid compounds.

3.4 Oil phase
The chemical composition of the oil phase was measured by GC-MS. Only a fraction of the oil phase is identifiable by GC-MS due to the high molecular weights and high boiling points of the oil phase.29,39 The total ion chromatogram diagram of heavy oil and light oil is shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that the spectra of the oil phase derived from NM are different from those derived from DA. In the spectra of light oil shown in Fig. 5a, the majority of the identified components are macromolecules of the N-heterocyclic ring, and they are cracked into small molecules of the N-heterocyclic ring and ketones, and the cleavage is more pronounced with increasing temperature. In Fig. 5b, no component was detected in the spectrum of the NM-derived heavy oil. However, the spectra of the DA-derived heavy oil mainly present some fatty acids and ketones. Similarly, high temperature promotes the cracking of organic matter in the heavy oil. The peaks corresponding to fatty acids and linear ketones are weakened.
 Fig. 5  Total ion chromatogram diagram of biocrude oil, (a) light oil and (b) heavy oil. 
In order to understand the ash effect on the oil phase, the relative contents of the identified components were calculated by the peak area, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 6. The details of the components of bio-oil are listed in Table S1 and S2 (ESI data†). The components can be classified into several categories, such as acids, aldehydes, amides, ketones, esters, hydrocarbons, N-heterocyclic rings, phenols, etc.
 Fig. 6  Composition of (a) the light oil and (b) the heavy oil derived from NM and DA at different temperatures. 
As presented in Fig. 6a, the light oil contains a large number of N-containing compounds such as pyrrole, pyrazine, piperazine, imidazole, piperidine and amide/amine. The relative content of the N-heterocyclic ring components in the DA-derived light oil is much higher than that of the NM-derived light oil, and the amides/amines appear in the DA-derived light oil. This indicates that protein hydrolysis, fragmentation, and polymerization are enhanced by removing the ash.40 On the other hand, the deamination might be accelerated due to the presence of calcium carbonate in the ash shown in eqn (8)–(10),26 resulting in a high relative content of ketones around 50% in the NM-derived light oil. CaCO3 ↔ Ca2+ + CO32−(8) CO32− + 2NH4+ ↔ (NH4)2CO3(9) (NH4)2CO3 → 2NH3 + CO2 + H2O(10)
Differently, the relative content of esters is quite low compared with that of the previous reports.35,41 The phenols in microalgae biomass are derived from the conversion of the cell membrane and the cell wall.33 The relative content of phenols in the NM-derived light oil is higher than that of the DA-derived light oil, indicating that the cell wall was destroyed during the deashing process. Fewer compounds were detected at higher temperature, suggesting the competition between hydrolysis and repolymerization reactions during HTL.35 Besides, some compounds might be decomposed into gaseous products as the temperature increases.
In Fig. 6b, only the DA-derived heavy oil is illustrated because almost no component was detected in the NM-derived heavy oil. Long chain fatty acids obtained by the hydrolysis of lipids were detected in the DA-derived heavy oil. As the temperature increases from 260 °C to 340 °C as shown in Fig. 6b, the acid relative content decreases from 38.67% to 30.39% while the hydrocarbon relative content increases from 8.84% to 26.89%. This trend can be attributed to the decarboxylation reaction of fatty acids along with the formation of a large amount of CO2, and the decarboxylation is more pronounced at higher temperature.42
The elemental composition, HHV and ER of the heavy oil are listed in Table 1. NM-derived heavy oils contain 44.81–59.42% carbon, 5.84–7.29% hydrogen, 29.11–46.11% oxygen, and 3.12–4.18% nitrogen. NM-derived heavy oil have higher carbon and hydrogen contents, and a lower nitrogen content than those of DA (see Table 2 for sulfur contents of NM and DA). As the temperature increases, the carbon and hydrogen contents of the NM-derived heavy oil decrease first and then increase. The decrease in the nitrogen content indicates that denitrification is favorable at higher temperature.43 The highest HHV of the NM-derived heavy oil is obtained at 260 °C and the maximum value is 25.3 MJ kg−1, which is significantly higher than that of NM. The DA-derived heavy oils show similar trends to the NM-derived heavy oil. Compared with NM-derived heavy oils, DA-derived heavy oils have higher carbon and hydrogen contents, and a lower oxygen content at the same hydrothermal temperature. Consequently, the HHV of the DA-derived heavy oil is higher than that of the NM-derived heavy oil.

The bio-oil property is significantly affected by its H/C, N/C and O/C molar ratios.5 At the same hydrothermal temperature, the NM-derived heavy oil has a higher O/C ratio (0.37–0.77) than that of the DA-derived heavy oil (0.06–0.57). This is because calcium carbonate in the ash promotes deamination and forms ketones as describe above. The N/C ratios of heavy oils show a small decrease with increasing temperature due to the hydrolysis of proteins.5
ER of bio-oil is used to evaluate energy efficiency of the HTL process.44 As shown in Table 1, the values of ER present decreasing trends for the heavy oil derived from both NM and DA as the temperature increases. ER of the NM-derived heavy oil is higher than that of the DA-derived heavy oil at the same hydrothermal temperature. The highest ER values are 32.65% for the NM-derived heavy oil and 36.79% for the DA-derived heavy oil, which are obtained at 260 °C. This proves that the ash in NM is unconducive to heavy oil energy recovery, and 260 °C is preferable for higher energy recovery.
3.5 Hydrochar

3.5.1. Ash composition. 
As seen in Fig. 7, the XRD pattern of NM shows the presence of CaCO3, CaSO4, SiO2, NaCl, while only SiO2 appears in the XRD pattern of DA. This indicates that the deashing pretreatment removes most of the poorly water-soluble compounds in NM, leaving only SiO2 in DA that will not participate in the reaction. After the HTL process, there are no significant changes in the mineral composition of the corresponding hydrochars except that NaCl in NM that dissolves in the water medium. Notably, the broad diffraction peak around the 2θ angle of 22° corresponding to the disordered graphite (002) diffraction plane45 is observed in DA and DA-derived hydrochars, suggesting that they have the rich amorphous carbon.
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of feedstock and hydrochars at different temperatures. 
In order to understand the mineral content of ash in detail, XRF experiments were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 8. The major inorganic component in NM is CaO with a relative content of around 30% in addition to SiO2, Cl2O and SO3. However, the relative content of SiO2 is around 70%, which is the dominating inorganic component in DA. This manifests that the acid-washing pretreatment effectively removes most of the minerals, which is consistent with the above discussion. The ash in NM contains a large amount of water-insoluble compounds. During the hydrothermal process, these insoluble components are retained, and most of the organic components are decomposed, resulting in a significant increase of the ash content for hydrochars.

3.5.2. The physicochemical properties of feedstock and hydrochars. 

Table 2 presents the characteristics of the hydrochars, including ultimate analysis, proximate analysis and HHV. As the temperature increases from 260 °C to 340 °C, the hydrochar yields of NM and DA (shown in Fig. 1) decrease from 26.8% to 24.47% and from 23.85% to 18.87%, respectively. This is attributed to the degradation of polymers from the accelerated depolymerization rate during the hydrothermal process at high temperature.46 The VM content of NM-derived hydrochars decreases from 55.34% to 32.90%, while the ash content increases from 44.66% to 67.10%. The minerals in the NM-derived hydrochars are enriched after VM loss. Generally, the released volatiles polymerize on the solid surface to form fixed carbon.47 However, FC is undetected in both NM and NM-derived hydrochars after multiple tests according to the Chinese National Standard (GB/T 28731-2012). This is attributed to the fact that NM contains a mass of ash and VM, and the content of FC is too low to be detected. After deashing pretreatment, the ash content of DA sharply reduced to 14.98%. VM of the DA-derived hydrochars decreased from 43.15% to 33.44% as the temperature increases from 260 °C to 340 °C, which is partly compensated by the increase of FC from 18.10% to 22.00%. Moreover, the ash content also increases from 38.75% to 44.56%. The fuel ratio of FC/VM can be used to evaluate the hydrochars as an alternative coal fuel.48 As shown in Table 2, the fuel ratio gradually increases from 0.18 to 0.66, indicating that the rank of hydrochars is greatly improved by hydrothermal treatment. The value of HHV is in the range of 8.83–9.88 MJ kg−1 for the NM-derived hydrochars, and 17.66–20.18 MJ kg−1 for the DA-derived hydrochars, respectively, comparable to the calorific value of lignite (16.3 MJ kg−1).49 The HHV value of the DA-derived hydrochars becomes stable when the temperature is higher than 300 °C.
The elemental compositions (on daf basis) of hydrochars also present significant changes. The carbon content of all the hydrochars increases, and the hydrogen and oxygen contents decrease with increasing temperature. The van Krevelen diagram is also used for representing the conversion of carbohydrate materials to carbon-rich materials,50 which is depicted in Fig. 9 to describe the reaction pathways, including dehydration, decarboxylation and demethanation. As shown in Fig. 9, the H/C and O/C atomic ratios reduce from 1.64 to 1.38 and 0.69 to 0.27 for NM, and 1.63 to 1.15 and 0.44 to 0.16 for DA after HTL, respectively, in comparison to the typical coals, i.e. anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous and lignite in the Van Krevelen diagram. The main reaction pathways are dehydration and decarboxylation during the HTL process of NM and DA, whereas the demethanation is negligible. Differently, the NM-derived hydrochars are in the region of lignite, while the DA-derived hydrochars are in the region of sub-bituminous. This manifests that hydrochars have a good coalification, and the DA-derived hydrochars have a better degree of coalification than the NM-derived hydrochars. Thus, DA-derived hydrochars are a better alternative fuel to coal.

3.5.3. The evolution of the functional group for feedstock and hydrochars. 
The FT-IR spectra of feedstock and hydrochars are illustrated in Fig. 10. The peaks were identified according to the previous literature.31,48,51 It could be seen that the spectra of the NM-derived hydrochars and DA-derived hydrochars are different, indicating that ash has a significant effect on the functional groups of hydrochars. After HTL, the intensity of O–H/N–H stretching vibrations (3200–3600 cm−1) gradually disappears for the DA-derived hydrochars, while the NM-derived hydrochars have no obvious changes. This phenomenon demonstrates that the protein degradation in DA is stronger than that in NM, resulting in a large number of N-containing components in the oil phase and aqueous phase of DA. This is consistent with the above description. Hydrochars derived from both NM and DA all have strong aliphatic CH stretching vibrations (2850 cm−1 and 2914 cm−1). This intensity of the CO group, which is identified in ketone and amide groups (1656 cm−1) and in carboxylic groups (1540 cm−1), is weakened. This suggests the occurrence of decarboxylation and decarbonylation during HTL, which is in accordance with the presence of a large amount of CO2 in the gaseous product. The peak (1434 cm−1) attributing to the CC stretching in the aromatic ring and the peak (873 cm−1) assigning to the out-of-plane in aromatic nucleus CH structure are found in the spectra of the NM-derived hydrochars, but not found in the spectra of the DA-derived hydrochars. This indicates that deashing pretreatment changes the organic structure of microalgae to some extent. The intensity of the peak (1000–1081 cm−1) representing C–O in aliphatic ethers or/and alcohol manifests a drastic increase. In addition, this peak (1000–1081 cm−1) also identified as Si–O, which illustrates the presence of SiO2 in ash. The different ranges of this peak between NM-derived hydrochars and DA-derived hydrochars may be due to the influence of the ash content in NM on the absorption of the samples, resulting in a shift of the absorption peak.

4. Conclusion
In this work, natural microalgae (NM), mainly Scenedesmus, containing large amounts of ash were employed for the experiments using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). HTL experiments were carried out in an autoclave reactor at the desired temperatures of 260 °C, 300 °C and 340 °C. The effects of ash on the properties of hydrothermal products were investigated by various techniques. The products, i.e. hydrochar, heavy oil, light oil, aqueous phase, and gaseous phase, were comprehensively analyzed. The results show that the conversion efficiency is in the range of 73.12–75.34% for NM, and 76.14–81.13% for DA, respectively, indicating the inhibition of the ash during the HTL process. The NM-derived light oil contains large amounts of ketones, whereas the DA-derived light oil contains a lot of N-heterocyclic rings. This phenomenon might be due to the deamination of calcium carbonate in the ash. In addition, the concentrations of NH4+ in the aqueous phase derived from NM at different temperatures are lower than those of DA, and PO43− is undetected in the NM-derived aqueous phase. The DA-derived hydrochars have a better degree of coalification than the NM-derived hydrochars and the high calorific value is in the range of 17.66–20.18 MJ kg−1. For natural microalgae, the deashing pretreatment before HTL is of great significance for the improving the biocrude yield and quality, as well as the biomass conversion efficiency, nitrogen utilization and the hydrochar quality.
