    , Accepted 10th May 2019First published on 13th May 2019AbstractPhoton up-conversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) exploits the annihilation of optically dark triplets of an organic emitter to produce high-energy singlets that generate high energy emission. In recently proposed hybrid systems, the annihilating triplets are indirectly sensitized by light-harvesting semiconductor colloidal nanocrystals via energy transfer from their capping ligands (h-sTTA). Here, we discuss quantitatively the performance of the h-sTTA up-conversion mechanism in a reference nanocrystal/organic emitter pair, by introducing a kinetic model that points out the relationship between the up-conversion yield and the excitation intensity. This model highlights the fundamental properties of the employed moieties that mostly affect the conversion efficiency. We derive a new expression for the excitation threshold specific for h-sTTA up-conversion, which allows us to estimate a priori the material performances from a few key parameters and to point out the most severe bottlenecks. The obtained results demonstrate that the up-conversion yield is mainly limited by ultrafast non-radiative recombinations of the optical excitons created on nanocrystals, which are competitive to the sensitization channel for emitter triplets in solution. Our results suggest that the quenching partially arises from charge transfer interactions between nanocrystals and surface ligands. Improved ligand design and optimized surface functionalization strategies are required to avoid energy losses and enhance the up-conversion performance, thus promoting the application of h-sTTA up-conversion materials in solar technologies.
1. Introduction
Photon up-conversion is a process that creates high-energy photons starting from low-energy radiation. This process was originally studied to improve the performances of photovoltaic cells,1–3 since it enables to recover the low energy tail that falls below the device energy bandgap.4 Recently, it was also proposed for other applications, including anti-counterfeiting,5,6 anti-Stokes fluorescence bioimaging7–9 and high-sensitivity oxygen detection.10,11 Among the up-conversion mechanisms, sensitized up-conversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation (sTTA) in multicomponent organic systems has proved to be the most effective strategy at excitation intensities close to solar irradiance.12–14 Because of the peculiar nature of the involved electronic states, the ability of sTTA up-conversion to transform low-power radiation is indeed significantly better than that of all the other competitive processes, including non-linear optics and two-photon absorption based on both quantum dots and rare earth ions. In particular, sTTA exploits the annihilation of metastable triplets, indirectly populated from appropriate sensitizers via energy transfer, to produce high-energy singlets that generate the up-converted emission. Since triplets are long-living states with a typical natural lifetime in the range of milliseconds and over, sTTA up-conversion requires neither coherent excitation light nor the simultaneous absorption of more photons, and therefore it is also effective at extremely low excitation light intensities.15 By choosing the appropriate emitter/sensitizer pair, up-conversion quantum efficiency (QYuc) values above 30% have been obtained at excitation power densities of tens of mW cm−2, which is not far from the maximum theoretical yield of 50% arising from the energy conservation principle.
Actually, tens of bi-component organic sTTA up-conversion systems have been thoroughly investigated4,14,16 and their performances have been evaluated in terms of overall efficiency and of excitation threshold intensity Ith, which marks the excitation power density at which the process enters the regime of maximum conversion yield.17 However, their practical application to solar devices is still hindered by the narrow absorption bandwidth of the best available organic sensitizers,18 which strongly limits the light-harvesting capability of the sTTA up-converter when it operates under white light. The detrimental effect of a small absorbance results in an excitation threshold still too high to enable the use of sTTA up-converters in real life solar technologies.19 A possible strategy to overcome this issue is the use of recently developed hybrid systems.20–22
As shown in Fig. 1, the organic sensitizer is substituted by a semiconductor colloidal nanocrystal capped with conjugated organic ligands that work as energy-bridges between the light-harvesting nanocrystals and the emitters in solution. Thanks to the close proximity to their surfaces, the ligand triplet states are populated through energy transfer (ETI) from the optical exciton photogenerated in the nanocrystal. Then, in order to produce up-converted photons by TTA, dark triplets of the emitter are sensitized through a second energy transfer step from the ligands (ETII). In this way, by exploiting the broad absorption of the nanocrystal, it has been demonstrated that the light-harvesting ability of the system can be incremented up to five times.18,23 However, in this embryonic stage of the research, the optimization of this new class of up-converters is hampered because of the lack of a detailed description of all the involved photophysical processes, which would allow the main critical steps to be evidenced.

(b) Scheme of the energy levels involved in the process. Upon absorption of one green photon at 2.33 eV, an exciton NC* is created in a nanocrystal. Its energy is transferred via Dexter-type energy transfer (ETI) to the ligand triplet state TL, which in turn can populate the emitter triplet state TE through a second transfer (ETII). The annihilation of two encountering emitter triplets (TTA) then results in the formation of a higher energy emitter excited singlet state SE*, from which the up-converted emission at 2.83 eV occurs. Solid lines refer to transitions involving a photon, while dashed lines refer to radiationless transitions. 
Here, we discuss quantitatively the performance of the hybrid sTTA up-conversion (h-sTTA) process in a capped nanocrystal/organic emitter representative system, introducing a kinetic model that points out the relationship between the efficiency of the up-conversion mechanism and the excitation intensity. In particular, by developing the classical model for standard bi-component organic up-converters, we derive a new expression for Ith in h-sTTA up-conversion systems, which allows us to estimate the conversion performance from a few fundamental parameters characteristic of the employed moieties. The obtained results suggest that the up-conversion yield is actually limited by a fast charge-transfer process between nanocrystals and capping ligands, which is competitive with the ligand excitation via energy transfer. Therefore, our findings suggest that strong efforts are required to improve ligand design and surface functionalization to obtain hybrid up-conversion systems with performances better than those of the best organic counterparts, thus promoting the application of h-sTTA up-conversion in real-world applications.
2. Results and discussion
The energy flow in the h-sTTA up-conversion process is outlined in Fig. 1b, according to the electronic structure of the involved species. Here, commercial cadmium selenide (CdSe) colloidal nanocrystals of 2.8 ± 0.1 nm size are used as light harvesters (see the ESI†, SI.1–3).24 Upon excitation with green laser light at 532 nm (2.33 eV) just above their absorption edge, they show a narrow photoluminescence at 560 nm (2.23 eV, Fig. 2a). A broad and weak emission is also observed at 800 nm (1.55 eV), which is ascribed to the presence of emitting localized states.25 In order to implement the aforementioned bridge between nanocrystals and emitters, namely 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA), the native surface oleic acid (OA) ligands are partially substituted with 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9-ACA) by using a ligand exchange protocol described in the ESI.† To date, this ligand, which shows ground-state and photoluminescence properties similar to DPA (Fig. 2b and c), has been employed in several works.20,26,27 The carboxylic functionality of 9-ACA ensures that its conjugated anthracene-like core is anchored close to the nanocrystal surface, thus enabling the first energy transfer step ETI from the excited nanocrystal NC* to the dark ligand triplet TL. According to the protocol employed, the exchange procedure enables about three 9-ACA molecules to be anchored on each NC.26 The surface functionalization results in a substantial decrease of the nanocrystal photoluminescence intensity (Fig. S1, ESI†). The residual photoluminescence spectrum is now dominated by the defect-related emission (Fig. 2d), which experiences inefficient energy transfer due to the limited resonance with the TL level. The second energy transfer ETII drives the energy from the ligands to the triplet states TE of DPA in solution, which can experience TTA and then generate fluorescent singlets, leading to the production of the up-converted photons. This multistep mechanism for the sensitization of TE points out the two main features that a good ligand must possess to work efficiently. First, its binding functionality to the semiconductor surface should be as short as possible, one nanometer or less, in order to enhance the Dexter-type transfer from the nanocrystal and its triplet state, whose transition dipole moment is vanishing.26 Second, the energy of the ligand triplet should be properly aligned with both the nanocrystal bandgap and the emitter triplets, rather than be perfectly resonant, in order to enhance the energy flow from light-harvesting nanocrystals to annihilators/emitters while avoiding back energy transfer to the nanocrystals. 9-ACA fulfills both these constraints. In particular, the bridging carboxylic functionality is shorter than 1 nm, and, despite their similar electronic structure, the energies of 9-ACA and DPA triplets are slightly different. In particular, we have NC* (2.23 eV) > TL (1.83 eV) > TE (1.77 eV), which implies that both ETI and ETII are entropically favored,28 while back energy transfer is forbidden at room temperature since kbT (0.025 eV) ≪ ΔENC*,TE (0.46 eV).

The insets report the structure of each moiety. To record the PL spectra, the nanocrystals are excited with laser light at 532 nm, while DPA is excited with laser light at 355 nm. 
The kinetics of the overall up-conversion process is described by a system of coupled rate equations, which depicts the time evolution of the excited state populations: (1a) (1b) (1c) (1d)With respect to the three equation system that describes a classic bi-component organic system,17 because of the introduction of an additional species, i.e. the energy-bridge ligand, we must now deal with four equations. Eqn (1a) describes the excited nanocrystal population NC* as a function of excitation intensity Iexc and of the absorption coefficient α(λ) (2.84 cm−1 at 532 nm, see Fig. S2, ESI†). As detailed below, the parameter 0 < η < 1 quantifies the fraction of nanocrystals that after the ligand exchange procedure are able to transfer the exciton to the ligand triplets. Excited nanocrystals NC* recombine spontaneously to the ground state with a decay rate constant kNC, or they transfer the harvested energy to the ligands with a rate kET′. In the same way, according to eqn (1b), the ligand triplets TL recombine spontaneously with a rate kTL (see Fig. S3, ESI†), or populate the emitter triplets TE through the second transfer step with a rate kET′′. Once generated, the TE states recombine spontaneously with rate kTE or undergo TTA if, during their lifetime τTE = (kTE)−1, they encounter a second triplet (eqn (1c)). Lastly, eqn (1d) describes the population of emitter singlets SE that are generated by TTA and decay radiatively with rate kSE. The f factor in the singlet excitation term is the statistical weight that accounts for the probability of obtaining a singlet upon collision of two triplets, which takes the value of 0.5 for DPA in solution.29 It is worth pointing out that the TTA rate kTTA is not constant but it is given by the product of the density of available triplets TE, settled by Iexc, and the second order rate constant γTT, which is characteristic of a given system, i.e. kTTA = γTTTE.30 In order to figure out the overall up-conversion performance, we solved the system under the steady-state condition for two limit cases. In the low-power limit, the spontaneous TE decay rate is much larger than the annihilation rate (kTE ≫ kTTA) and therefore the second order term in eqn (1c) can be neglected. In this regime, the intensity of the emitted up-converted light Iuc is proportional to the density of the generated SE states under the steady-state condition, and it can be written as (2)where the quantities  and  indicate the efficiency of the nanocrystal-to-ligand and of ligand-to-emitter ET, respectively. In the high-power limit, given the large emitter triplet population, the TTA is the main deactivation channel for the TE states (kTTA ≫ kTE). Since the spontaneous decay term is now negligible, Iuc results in (3)Eqn (2) and (3) indicate that the plot of Iucvs. Iexc must show a quadratic-to-linear dependence change by increasing the excitation intensity, which corresponds to the switch from the low- to the high-excitation regime limit. As in conventional bi-component systems, the intensity at which kTE = kTTA is referred to as threshold intensity Ith, corresponding to an annihilation yield .
Above Ith, the up-conversion efficiency rapidly saturates to its maximum value. The Ith expression for h-sTTA up-conversion systems can be easily obtained by equating the two asymptotic relations for Iuc yielding (4)Eqn (4) is a straightforward tool to predict the performance of every system as a function of a few properties that can be measured independently, thus getting the guidelines for the development of high-performance hybrid up-converters.
In order to validate the proposed model, we investigate the up-conversion properties of a dispersion of 9-ACA/CdSe nanocrystals (1.4 × 10−5 M) in solution with the emitter DPA (10−2 M) in toluene. The sensitizer concentration is fixed and gives an absorbance of 0.12 at 532 nm with an optical path of 0.1 cm. Fig. 3a reports the photoluminescence spectra of the sample under continuous wave (CW) excitation at 532 nm at increasing Iexc values. Besides the nanocrystals’ intrinsic and defect-related PL, the spectra show the blue up-converted emission peaked at 430 nm due to the DPA fluorescence, which dominates the photoluminescence spectra at the highest excitation power densities. We notice that the presence of the residual nanocrystals’ band-edge emission indicates an incomplete ETI. The photoluminescence intensity at 560 nm, i.e. at the peak of the nanocrystals’ emission, shows a linear dependence on Iexc over the whole explored excitation intensity range, which is a fingerprint of the occurrence of a one-photon process as in standard photoluminescence. The same is observed for the defect-related emission at 800 nm. Conversely, the power dependence of the up-converted emission intensity, reported in Fig. 3b in a log–log plot, behaves as a typical non-linear process that competes with a linear one. Here, the up-converted emission intensity shifts from the quadratic regime (slope m = 2) to the linear one (slope m = 1), which labels the high efficiency regime where the conversion yield is maximum and constant. The intersection point of the two straight lines that fit the two asymptotic behaviors marks the excitation threshold at Ith = 4.9 W cm−2.

The HOMO and LUMO levels of all the moieties involved in the up-conversion process are reported in the inset. 
More details about the up-conversion process are obtained from the time-resolved analysis of the blue photoluminescence under a 532 nm pulsed excitation. Fig. 3c reports the decay of the 430 nm signal under a 40 W cm−2 excitation, which shows the typical behavior of the delayed up-converted emission in the high-power excitation regime, i.e. well above the threshold.31 The signal decays on the time-scale of hundreds of microseconds following a non-exponential behavior, which progressively slows down. This is a recombination dynamics significantly slower than that of both DPA and 9-ACA fluorescence (inset of Fig. 3c), thus demonstrating that, thanks to the sensitization process, the excitation energy is transferred from the nanocrystals’ to the emitters’ triplet states in solution, enabling the TTA. On the contrary, the absence of any decay component on the ns time-scale confirms the absence of direct DPA excitation. Under this condition, the decay of the up-converted photoluminescence intensity is described by the relationship , where ΦTTA is the annihilation yield at t = 0.32 The experimental data fitted to this function result in kTE = 3.5 kHz, which is compatible with the typical recombination rate for triplets in oxygen-free organic solvents,33,34 and ΦTTA = 0.85, a value close to unity as expected for Iexc > Ith.
The up-conversion performances of the analyzed system can be compared to those of an ideal system for which η, ΦET′, and ΦET′′ = 1 and the threshold reaches its minimum value. To this aim, the annihilation rate constant γTT is calculated in the Perrin approximation for short-range processes in low viscosity solvents. Considering that γTT = 8πDERTT, where DE = 8.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 is the emitter diffusivity35 and RTT = 0.91 nm is the triplet–triplet interaction distance, the second order rate constant for DPA in toluene is γTT = 1.86 × 10−11 cm3 s−1.17,30 With this value of γTT, the threshold for the ideal system calculated by eqn (4) is 71 mW cm−2, which is about 70 times lower than the measured one. This discrepancy cannot be ascribed to a low efficiency of the two energy transfer processes. ETII cannot be measured directly because only dark states are involved, but its evaluation is possible by using the Perrin model for the Dexter energy transfer. At the employed emitter concentration, considering the solvent viscosity and using an interaction radius of 7.65 Å, the transfer efficiency results in ΦET′′ = 1 (SI.4, ESI†). On the contrary, the value of ΦET′ can be extracted from the comparison between photoluminescence lifetime of OA-capped and 9-ACA-decorated nanocrystals. Fig. 3d reports the time-resolved spectrum at 560 nm of both the nanocrystals samples dispersed in toluene, and prepared with the same absorbance at 532 nm in order to quantitatively compare not only their decay dynamics but also their emission intensities. In order to take into account the effect of a non-homogeneous ensemble of NCs, their emission characteristic lifetime is defined as the time when the photoluminescence intensity I(t) drops to I(t)/e. The data show that it decreases from τNC = 24.0 ns to NC = 3.6 ns moving from native to decorated systems. This gives an ETI yield of , not far from the ideal value. These findings indicate that the large threshold observed in the real system must be ascribed to the parameter η, whose value can be calculated from the photoluminescence intensity data immediately after the excitation pulse (Fig. 3d). In particular, it is easy to observe that in the 9-ACA-decorated nanocrystals, the signal intensity at zero delay time Ī(0) is significantly lower with respect to the corresponding I(0) of the OA-capped system. This implies that, after the ligand exchange step, not all the nanocrystals are active in transferring the excitation to the ligands, because of the presence of ultrafast quenching processes (10–100 ps) of the nanocrystal excited states that compete with ETI.36 The origin of this effect can be ascribed to the presence of superficial trapping states not properly passivated by the 9-ACA ligands,37 together with a partial withdrawal of photo-generated holes from the nanocrystals to the ligands (Fig. S4, ESI†).38–40 In fact, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3d, the HOMO–LUMO energies of the ligand moiety are favorable to hole trapping from the nanocrystal valence band.38,41 Regardless of the specific mechanism, both scenarios reduce the fraction of excited nanocrystals that contribute to the up-conversion sensitization. A larger excitation power is therefore necessary to reach the excited state density required to maximize ΦTTA with respect to the case where all nanocrystals are active. The parameter η, which quantifies the fraction of active light-harvesters, can be calculated from the experimental data as η = Ī(0)/I(0). For the investigated system, η is 0.02, a very low value that shifts the up-conversion threshold to high values. By using the experimental η in eqn (4), we obtain a theoretical threshold of 4.33 W cm−2, which is in good agreement with the measured threshold, further validating the proposed model. From the power-dependent data, it is also possible to estimate the up-conversion yield QYuc as a function of Iexc, which is reported in the inset of Fig. 3b for samples prepared with different emitter concentrations CE. For the sample with the highest DPA concentration (10−2 M), we observe the typical behavior of QYuc, which linearly increases with Iexc and then becomes constant above the threshold saturating at QYuc ∼0.3% (see SI.5, ESI†). This value is lower than the one observed with classical DPA-based organic up-converters because, as described above, not all the 9-ACA-decorated nanocrystals are active as sensitizers. From a theoretical point of view, it is possible to estimate QYuc in hybrid systems by introducing ΦET′′ and η in the classical equation,42 thus obtaining (5)Here, Φem is the emitter photoluminescence quantum yield (0.90 in toluene).43 Considering that in the high power regime, we can assume that both ΦET′′ and ΦTTA are equal to unity; eqn (5) gives a maximum yield of 0.4% in good agreement with the experimental value. However, over the investigated CE range (10−2 M–10−4 M), we observe an unexpected reduction of the maximum QYuc. The only factor in eqn (5) depending on CE is the ligand-to-emitter transfer efficiency .
Here, kET′′ is the energy transfer rate calculated in the Perrin approximation for short-range interactions taking into account the solvent viscosity and the dimensions of the involved moieties (SI.4, ESI†), and kTL is the spontaneous recombination rate of the ligand triplets in solution. By using the calculated kET′′ and kTL = 7.4 kHz measured for isolated 9-ACA molecules (Fig. S3, ESI†), ΦET′′ should be close to 100% down to CE = 10−5 (SI.4, ESI†), which is different from what we observe. We ascribe this behavior to an additional interaction between ligand triplets and nanocrystals. In particular, we notice that the energy of the nanocrystal emitting defects at 1.55 eV (800 nm) is partially resonant with the ligand triplets, and therefore a back energy transfer process from the ligand to defects can occur, as demonstrated by Mongin and co-workers.44 Thus, kTL for bound 9-ACA should be larger than 7.4 kHz. Consequently, only by using a high CE can the rate kET′′ becomes large enough to reach ΦET′′ = 1, obtaining the highest value of QYuc as predicted by eqn (5). Finally, we also notice a decrease of the h-sTTA up-conversion yield at very high excitation intensities regardless of the employed emitter concentration. Even if a similar effect has already been observed in conventional organic up-converters because of the emitter population saturation,45 the origin of this phenomenon in hybrid systems is still not clear. Further studies are required to shed light on this point, which should be related to ultrafast quenching mechanisms inherent in semiconductor CdSe nanocrystals at high excitation fluencies, which are not present in fully organic sTTA up-converters.46,47
3. Conclusions
In summary, we studied the kinetics of sensitized photon up-conversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation in a model hybrid molecule–nanocrystal system, where semiconductor nanocrystals decorated with energy-bridge ligands work as sensitizers for the annihilators/emitters in solution. As a function of the excitation intensity, the system exhibits a behavior predicted by four coupled rate equations that describe the time evolution of the involved excited state populations. This analysis allows us extend to hybrid systems the analytical expression that identifies the high-efficiency excitation threshold, i.e. the irradiance required to achieve the maximum up-conversion yield. As in the case of bi-component organic up-conversion systems, this figure of merit depends only on a few fundamental parameters characteristic of the employed moieties and it enables us to estimate the material performance a priori, which is a powerful tool for the design of improved hybrid materials. The model system studied in this work shows a lower conversion efficiency (0.3%) and a higher excitation threshold (4.9 W cm−2) with respect to the full-organic counterpart working in the same spectral range. However, the conducted spectroscopic studies demonstrate that this is not due to an intrinsic limit of hybrid systems, but it is due to the fact that most of the absorbed energy is dissipated immediately after excitation through fast deactivation mechanisms induced by the ligand exchange process. The obtained results suggest that there is plenty of room to improve hybrid sTTA-based up-converters. In particular, an improvement of the ligand-exchange procedure employed to decorate the nanocrystals is necessary in order to limit the formation of quenching surface defects. An alternative strategy to reduce the time-zero quenching processes consists substituting the core-only nanocrystals with engineered core/shell heterostructures,39 where a thin semiconductor shell such as ZnS on CdSe nanocrystals enables the passivation of surface defects.48,49 Moreover, new specific energy-bridge ligands are required, with a proper electronic structure to prevent any carrier withdrawal from the semiconductor upon photoexcitation. The experimental evidences obtained and the modelling proposed indicate that the elimination of these energy dissipation channels would result in a lowering of the threshold and in an enhancement of the conversion yield of about two orders of magnitude. In this case, the hybrid up-converter would couple unprecedented light-harvesting capability with a conversion efficiency of tens of percent and a threshold of a few mW cm−2, which are performances matching the strict requirements of real world solar technologies.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Sketch of the composition of the hybrid molecule–nanocrystal up-converting system (h-sTTA up-conversion), with CdSe nanocrystals decorated with 9-ACA ligands as sensitizers and DPA molecules as fluorescent annihilators/emitters. (b) Scheme of the energy levels involved in the process. Upon absorption of one green photon at 2.33 eV, an exciton NC* is created in a nanocrystal. Its energy is transferred via Dexter-type energy transfer (ETI) to the ligand triplet state TL, which in turn can populate the emitter triplet state TE through a second transfer (ETII). The annihilation of two encountering emitter triplets (TTA) then results in the formation of a higher energy emitter excited singlet state SE*, from which the up-converted emission at 2.83 eV occurs. Solid lines refer to transitions involving a photon, while dashed lines refer to radiationless transitions.	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption and normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of (a) a 3 × 10−5 M solution of CdSe nanocrystals in toluene, (b) a 10−3 M 9-ACA solution in THF, (c) a 10−4 M DPA solution in THF and (d), a 1.4 × 10−5 M solution of 9-ACA/CdSe NCs in toluene (the excitation stray-light was removed using a notch filter for clarity). The insets report the structure of each moiety. To record the PL spectra, the nanocrystals are excited with laser light at 532 nm, while DPA is excited with laser light at 355 nm.

 	Fig. 3  (a) PL spectrum of a 9-ACA/CdSe (1.4 × 10−5 M) and DPA (10−2 M) solution in toluene, under a CW 532 nm excitation as a function of the excitation intensity Iexc. (b) Intensity of the up-converted emission (dots) and of the residual nanocrystal emission (squares) as a function of Iexc. Inset: Up-conversion quantum yield (QYuc) as a function of Iexc and of the emitter concentration (10−2 M, circles; 5 × 10−3 M, crosses; 2 × 10−3 M, squares; 10−3 M, triangles; 10−4 M, hexagons). (c) Decay of the delayed up-converted emission under a modulated excitation at 532 nm (40 W cm−2). The inset reports the fluorescence decay of a 9-ACA solution (10−3 M, blue) and of a DPA solution (10−4 M, green) in THF, under a 355 nm pulsed excitation and the single exponential fitting curves (red). (d) PL decay at 560 nm of a CdSe (orange) and 9-ACA/CdSe (red) nanocrystals solution in toluene (1.5 × 10−5 M). The HOMO and LUMO levels of all the moieties involved in the up-conversion process are reported in the inset.
