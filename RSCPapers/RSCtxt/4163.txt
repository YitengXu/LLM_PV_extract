    , Accepted 5th November 2012First published on 6th November 2012AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently under intense academic and industrial investigations, because of their environmentally-friendly, efficient, and low-cost features. The photosensitizer plays a key role in determining DSSCs' performance. The 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety, included in dye TTC102, has been demonstrated before as a novel and efficient electron donor fragment. In this paper, the oversimple π-conjugated bridge of TTC102 was replaced by a 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole moiety. Two new D-D-π-A sensitizers, named TTC104 and TTC105, were synthesized and fully characterized. After anchoring on TiO2 nanoparticle film, the absorption band of TTC104 is broader by 30 nm than that of TTC102. Under AM 1.5G irradiation, the energy conversion efficiency (η) of a DSSC based on TTC104 reaches 6.36%, which is 21.6% higher than that of TTC102 (5.24%). The results above demonstrate that the photovoltaic performance can be improved after introducing the 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole moiety to TTC102 when employed in DSSCs. Dye TTC105, containing a pyridyl group as the electron acceptor, showed only 1.88% conversion efficiency (η) when used in DSSCs. The huge different performances of TTC104 and TTC105 are proved to be partly due to the smaller dye loading amount, higher dark current and charge recombination rate of TTC105.
1. Introduction
Since the first report of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991, DSSCs have received considerable attention due to their low-cost fabrication and high power conversion efficiency.1,2 The photosensitizer plays as a key role in determining DSSCs' performance.2–4 For example, the light absorption of the sensitizer directly determines the light response range of a DSSC.2–4 Over 12% conversion efficiency has been achieved under illumination of AM 1.5G full sunlight from DSSCs co-sensitized by dye YD2-o-C8 and Y123.5,6 Nevertheless, triarylamine dye based DSSCs are still under intense academic investigation not only for their prominent electron donating and hole-transport ability, but also for their convenient synthetic routes.2,6,7
Considering that the heterocyclic groups with lone pair electrons may effectively delocalize the positive charges after photooxidation of dyes, it can be predicted that using suitable heterocyclic groups to modify the structures of triarylamine units may improve the electron donating ability. In our recent report, we introduced a method, which adopts heterocyclic substituted triarylamine units as electronic donor moieties, to design triarylamine dyes for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.8 Dye TTC102 (Scheme 1), including the 4,4′-di(2-thienyl)triphenylamine moiety, exhibited the best performance among the diverse dyes substituted by a series of heterocyclic groups based on a simple triarylamine dye (TC105).
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of TTC102, TTC104 and TTC105. 
The π-conjugated bridge of TTC102 is a oversimple phenyl group, which limits the light response in the visible light band (>480 nm).2 To broaden the light absorption for higher photovoltaic performance, we select 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole as the new π-conjugated bridge to replace the simple phenyl group. Carbazolyl groups can not only act as a π-conjugated bridge, but also as an electron donor group.4 Moreover, organic dyes with D-D-π-A structures have showed high performance in previous reports.9–11 On the other hand, we notice that the pyridine ring was put forward as a promising candidate for an electron-withdrawing anchoring group in new D-π-A dye sensitizers for DSSCs in a recent report.12
Herein, two dyes, named TTC104 and TTC105, were synthesized and characterized fully (Scheme 1). The properties of TTC102, TTC104 and TTC105, such as UV-vis absorption spectra, energy levels, quasi-reversible oxidation/reduction waves, and electrochemical impedance spectra, were tested under the same conditions and discussed in detail. Then, the photovoltaic performances of the devices under irradiation of AM 1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) were investigated in detail. Photovoltaic tests demonstrate that the DSSCs' performance can be proved after introducing a suitable π-conjugated bridge to TTC102. To further explain the results, series of properties (such as FTIR spectra, dark current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) were investigated, laying a special emphasis on the energetics, and charge transfer processes at the dye/titania/electrolyte interface.
2. Experimental
Synthesis and characterization of dyes
TTC102 and 3,6-dibromo-9-ethylcarbazole were synthesized according to the methods reported in ref. 8 and 31, respectively, with some modification. Synthetic routes to TTC104 and TTC105 are depicted in Scheme 2. The route involves several classic reactions. Three key intermediate compounds (3, 4 and 6) were synthesized firstly. Intermediate 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole, 1, was achieved from 3,6-dibromo-9-ethylcarbazole by Suzuki cross coupling reaction.13 Aldehyde 2 was prepared by Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of 1.14 Then, compound 3 was obtained by bromination of 2. Dibromination of compound 1 achieved intermediate compound 4. Another key intermediate compound, pinacol boronic ester 6, was afforded by coupling of bis(pinacolato)diboron and compound 5.15 Aldehyde 7 was obtained by Suzuki cross coupling of 3 and 6.13,15 Subsequent Knoevenagel condensations of compound 7 and cyanoacetic acid leaded to target dye TTC104.16 Compound 8 was prepared by Suzuki cross coupling reaction of 4 and 6.13,15 Finally, another Suzuki cross coupling occurred between 8 and pyridine-4-boronic acid to generate target dye TTC105.13 The preparation details of TTC104 and TTC105 are presented in the ESI.†

Fabrication of DSSCs
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates and Pt counter electrodes were purchased from Hepat Chroma Solar Tech Co. Ltd., Dalian, China. The sheet resistance of the FTO glass is 15 Ω cm−2. For the preparation of a DSSC, FTO glass plates were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then rinsed with water and ethanol. Then, the plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared by a screen printing technique. TiO2 nanoparticles and TiO2 paste for screen printing were prepared by methods reported by Grätzel and co-workers.17,18 The TiO2 paste consisted of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles, ethyl cellulose as a binder, and α-terpineol as a solvent. The TiO2 paste was printed on FTO glass plates and subsequently sintered at 500 °C in air for 1 h. The thickness of the 6 × 6 mm TiO2 thin films was ca. 12 μm. The TiO2 electrodes were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min.
Then, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in 0.4 mM dye (TTC102, TTC104 and TTC105) solutions in a 3:2 mixture of CHCl3 and EtOH over 24 hours respectively. The dyed films were washed in acetonitrile to remove non-attached dye from the pores. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes and the Pt counter electrodes were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a Surlyn film as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of the electrolyte solution was placed in the drilled hole of the counter electrode and was driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed using additional Surlyn and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness). The electrolyte introduced into the cell is composed of 0.6 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in a solvent mixture of 85% acetonitrile with 15% valeronitrile by volume.16 An Al foil was taped at the back side of each counter electrode to reflect unabsorbed light back to the photoanode.
Characterization of DSSCs
A xenon light source (Oriel) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of a testing cell using a keithley 2400 source meter. The measurement delay time was fixed to 40 ms with 100 measurement points scanning from Voc to Jsc.19 For the setup used in our measurements, there was no hysteresis in the I–V curves when reversing the scan direction.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSCs was measured by a DC method. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled with a flux controller to improve the stability of the irradiance. The light passed through a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125) to select a single wavelength with a resolution of 10 nm. The monochromatic light beam was then focused on the active region of the device. Light intensity was measured by a NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured by an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).
Theoretical calculation
All calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 program package.20 Without any symmetrical constraints, the geometrical structures of TTC104 and TTC105 were optimized by PM6 quantum chemistry method (a semiempirical method).21 Incorporating the optimized model in the ZINDO method,22 we calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths of TTC104 and TTC105.
UV-Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence, electrochemical properties and measurement of dye adsorbed amounts
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer for the liquid phase. Fluorescence spectra were measured by a Perkin Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer at room temperature for the liquid phase. TiO2 nanoparticle films (thickness: 12 μm) were immersed into 0.4 mM dye solutions in a 3:2 mixture of chloroform and ethanol for 24 h, and UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes sensitized on TiO2 were recorded with a Shimadzu MPC-3100 spectrometer for the solid phase at room temperature. Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves were recorded using a Chenhua CHI660D model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai), while Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was carried out using a Chenhua CHI660I model Electrochemical Workstation (Shanghai).
To estimate the adsorbed amounts of dye on the TiO2 films, the sensitized 6 × 6 mm electrodes were separately immersed into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (water: ethanol = 1:1), which resulted in the desorption of each dye. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer.
3. Results and discussion
Electronic absorption spectroscopy

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of three thienyltriarylamine dyes, TTC102, TTC104 and TTC105, dissolved in chloroform respectively. Absorption peaks (λmax) for three dyes are at about 340 nm (ε = 42500 M−1 cm−1) and 425 nm (ε = 27100 M−1 cm−1) for TTC102, 379 nm (ε = 50800 M−1 cm−1) for TTC104, and 372 nm (ε = 30000 M−1 cm−1) for TTC105.
 Fig. 1  (a) Electronic absorption spectra of TTC102, TTC104 and TTC105 dissolved in chloroform (2.5 × 10−5 M); (b) absorption spectra of the dyes anchoring on the 12 μm porous TiO2 nanoparticle film. (The inset picture shows digital images of the corresponding samples). 
The absorption band around 300–400 nm is mostly assigned to the π–π* transition, while the absorption band around 400–550 nm mainly arises from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron donor part and the electron acceptor moiety.23 The absorption of TTC104 at 300–400 nm is relatively intense enough to make the absorption peak of TTC104 around 400–550 nm not too obvious; this also occurs for TTC105.14 Both of the width and intensity of the absorption peak for TTC105 are smaller than those of TTC104, which should fundamentally arise from the weaker attracting electron ability of the 4-pyridyl group (TTC105).

Fig. 1b shows the absorbance profile of the dyes anchoring on TiO2 nanoparticle film. The onset points of the absorption spectra are about 570 nm for TTC102, 600 nm for TTC104 and 520 nm for TTC105. After being absorbed on TiO2 nanoparticle films, the absorption band of TTC104 is broader by 30 nm than that of TTC102. Compared to TTC102, TTC104 has an extended π-conjugated bridge, which enhances the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecule, so its maximum absorption peak is red shifted when absorbed on the TiO2 film. The absorption ranges of the three dyes are all broadened to different degrees after anchoring on TiO2 nanoparticle film. Strong interactions between the adsorbed dye molecules and the TiO2 surface are known to lead to aggregate formation, and partly broaden the absorption spectra when the dyes are adsorbed on TiO2 surfaces.24 The broadening of the absorption spectra of dyes when anchoring on TiO2 might be also due to dye–TiO2 interactions, dye–dye interactions, or both of them on the TiO2 surface.25,26
Theoretical calculation
To gain more insight into the electronic structures of TTC104 and TTC105, density function theory (DFT) calculations were performed by the ZINDO method with the PM6 quantum chemistry method for the geometry optimization.20–22 As shown in Fig. 2, the HOMOs of TTC104 and TTC105 are mainly populated over the tris(4-(2-thienyl)phenyl)amine moiety, while the HOMO−1s are mainly delocalized across the 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thienyl)carbazole fragments. The LUMO of TTC104 is populated over the 2-cyano-3-(2-thiophenyl)acrylic acid moiety, whereas the LUMO of TTC105 is delocalized across the 4-pyridyl group and linked thienyl 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thienyl)carbazole moiety, which may arise from the weaker electron withdrawing ability of the 4-pyridyl group in comparison with 2-cyanoacetic acid.
 Fig. 2  Frontier molecular orbitals (LUMO, HOMO and HOMO−1) of TTC104 and TTC105. 
Distributions on the HOMO, HOMO−1 and LUMO levels are separated in both compounds indicating that both the HOMO → LUMO and HOMO−1 → LUMO transitions can be consider as a charge-transfer transition from the triphenylamine unit to the cyanoacrylic acid or 4-pyridyl moiety. Separated distributions levels also suggest that photoinduced/interfacial electron could be efficiently injected from excited dyes to the TiO2 electrode.27
Electrochemical studies
Quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction waves (Eox and Ered in Table 1) were recorded for the dyes TTC102, TTC104 and TTC105 in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. 3). The oxidation may be attributed to the electron donor moieties, while the reduction may be assigned to the electron acceptor moieties.

The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) estimated from the absorption onset and the ground-state oxidation potential (Eox) were used to calculate the excited-state oxidation potential . On the one hand, the deduced  values of these three dyes are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs NHE),27,28 indicating that the electron injection process should be energetically favorable. On the other hand, the ground-state oxidation potentials (Eox in Table 1) of these three dyes are more positive than the redox potential of the I−/I3− couple (0.4 V vs NHE),27,28 suggesting that the oxidized dyes should be able to accept electrons from I− thermodynamically for effective dye regeneration. Consequently, all three dyes have enough thermodynamic driving forces for efficient DSSCs using nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode and I−/I3− electrolyte.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
These three dyes were used to manufacture dye-sensitized solar cells. The devices employed FTO glass anchored dye-loaded TiO2 nanoparticle film as positive electrode, platinum-coated glass as counter electrode, and a solution of 0.6 M DMII, 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M GuNCS in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) as the electrolyte.
Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves for the DSSCs were recorded under irradiation of AM 1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and are presented in Fig. 4. The exact results are summarized in Table 2. Among the fabricated DSSCs, the energy conversion efficiency (η) of TTC104 reaches the maximum value of 6.37%, which is 21.6% higher than that of TTC102 (5.24%), demonstrating that the photovoltaic performance is improved after introducing 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole moiety to TTC102.

The fill factor (FF, 56.27%) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc, 0.776 V) of TTC102 are close to the values of TTC104. However, there is a wide gap (2.12 mA cm−2) between the short circuit photocurrent density of TTC102 and TTC104, which contributes most to the difference between the conversion efficiency (η) of TTC102 (5.24%) and TTC104 (6.37%). The wide gap may arise from the difference of the light response ranges of TTC104 and TTC102. The performance of the DSSC based on TTC105 (Jsc = 4.20 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.674 V, FF = 66.60%, and η = 1.88%) is not as good as those of TTC102 and TTC104, partly because of the relatively narrow solar light response range and smaller dye loading amount (Table 2).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data of these dyes was collected and is presented in Fig. 5. The IPCE curve of TTC102 is almost the same as the result in our previous report.8 The IPCE value of TTC102 exceeds 60% from 340 to 430 nm. The IPCE curve of TTC105 is narrower than that of TTC102. The IPCE value of TTC105 exceeds 60% in the range of 350 to 410 nm, with a maximum value (64.7%) at 390 nm. Compared with TTC102, dye TTC104 shows an obviously broader response range (exceed 60% in 340–470 nm) and higher maximum value (74.8% at 400 nm). With only a difference of the electron acceptors, TTC104 and TTC105 exhibit hugely different incident photon-to-current conversion performances, which deviates from our expectation. It demonstrates that a tiny structure modification of the sensitizers may strongly influence the performance of the whole photovoltaic device. We need to investigate more properties to further explain the results, laying an emphasis on the charge transfer processes at the dye/titania/electrolyte interface.

Dark current of DSSCs
In addition to the dye loading amount and absorption band, the dark current or regeneration rate may also affect the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.29 To elucidate the factors affecting the performance of the cells, the dark currents of the DSSCs fabricated were checked (Fig. 6). The dark current of the cell of TTC102 is slightly higher than that of TTC104. Meanwhile, the DSSC of TTC105 exhibited the highest dark current among the three devices, which is consistent with it having the lowest Voc value among the three dyes.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool to characterize the important interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSCs.30–35 Electrochemical impedance spectra were collected for each cell under illumination of AM 1.5G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and under darkness. Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots, which are assigned to the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface (left peaks) and the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface (right peaks).32–35 The results generated from the EIS experiments have been summarized in Table 3.

Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of DSSCs tested under AM 1.5G full sunlight are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S1 of the ESI,†, respectively. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) on the TiO2 surface, which is related to the charge recombination rate between injected electron and electron acceptor (I3−) in the electrolyte,33,34 is estimated by the large semicircle width. A large Rrec means a small charge recombination rate and vice versa. The Rrec value for TTC102 is estimated to be 29 Ω, which is consistent with the value obtained in our previous results.2 The Rrec for TTC104 (28 Ω) is slightly less than that of TTC102, indicating a slightly smaller recombination rate. On the other hand, the dark current of the cell of TTC102 is slightly higher than that of TTC104. When these two factors are taken together, the cells of TTC102 and TTC104 exhibit close Voc values (Table 2). The Rrec for TTC105 (17 Ω) is the lowest among the three dyes, demonstrating the larger recombination rate of TTC105 in comparison with TTC102 or TTC104, which may be partly attributed to the smaller dye loading of TTC105. Since a higher charge recombination rate corresponds to a smaller resistance,30,35,36 a higher charge recombination rate of TTC105 may partly result in the existence of the wide gap (0.10 V) between the open-circuit voltages of TTC105 and TTC104.

Nyquist plots and Bode phase plots of DSSCs tested under darkness are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 of the ESI,†, respectively. The intermediate frequency semicircle in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. S2 in the ESI†) represents the charge transfer phenomena between the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface under dark. Efficient suppression of the dark current leads to a larger semicircle. The resistance towards the dark current (the size of semicircle) decreases in the order of TTC104 > TTC102 > TTC105. Therefore, the aforementioned arguments on dark current are supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies carried out in the dark.
The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra

Fig. 8 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of the dye powders and the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 (1400–1800 cm−1). For the powder of TTC104, the CO stretching band of the carboxy group was observed at 1700 cm−1. When the dye was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, the CO stretching band at 1700 cm−1 disappeared (Fig. 8a). The observations indicate that the carboxy groups of the dyes form an ester linkage with the TiO2 surface.36 On the other hand, the characteristic stretching bands for CN or CC were clearly observed at around 1590, 1499, 1484, and 1434 cm−1 for TTC105 powder. In the FTIR spectrum of TTC105 adsorbed on TiO2, a new band appeared at around 1612 cm−1, which is assigned to the pyridine ring coordinated to the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface.12

The ATR-FTIR results indicate that the dye TTC104 is adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by the ester linkage alone at Brønsted acid sites (surface-bound hydroxy groups), whereas the dye TTC105 is predominantly adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by coordinate bonding at the Lewis acid sites (exposed Tin+ cations). The strong chemical bonds between the adsorbed dye molecules and the TiO2 surface are responsible for the large red-shift of the absorption peak for dyes adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 1).
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we modified the structure of TTC102 by introducing the 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole moiety. Two new D-D-π-A sensitizers, named TTC104 and TTC105, were synthesized and fully characterized. After being absorbed on TiO2 nanoparticle film, the absorption band of TTC104 is broader by 30 nm than that of TTC102. Under AM 1.5G irradiation, the energy conversion efficiencies (η) of a DSSC based on TTC104 reached 6.36%, which is 21.6% higher than that of TTC102 (5.24%). All of the results above demonstrate that the photovoltaic performance has been improved after introducing 9-ethyl-3,6-di(2-thiophenyl)carbazole moiety to TTC102 when employed in DSSCs. The absorption band of TTC105 is blue-shifted compared with TTC102. Only 1.88% was reached as the conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC based on TTC105. The hugely different performances of TTC104 and TTC105 are proved to be partly due to the smaller dye loading amount, higher dark current and charge recombination rate of TTC105. Work on further enhancing the light harvesting ability in the infrared region through molecular and energy-level engineering of metal-free organic dyes for higher photovoltaic performance is under study.
