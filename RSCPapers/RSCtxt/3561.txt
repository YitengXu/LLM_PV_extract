    , Accepted 11th October 2018First published on 12th October 2018AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) material-based P–N junctions are unique building blocks for next-generation optoelectronics with the advantages of atomic thinness, flexibility and low cost. However, their device performances are limited due to either weak photo-absorption or low-quality junctions. Herein, we demonstrate a high-quality homogeneous and seamless P–N junction based on multilayer WSe2 instead of the reported monolayer structure or van der Waals junction and present its optoelectronic applications as a diode, photovoltaic cell and photodetector with high performances. Our WSe2 P–N junction exhibits ideal diode behaviour with an ideal factor close to 1 and rectifying ratio of 105. It also shows significant photovoltaic properties with VOC of ∼0.8 V and PCE of up to 6.2% under 635 nm light illumination. As a photodiode, it produces the maximum responsivity of 486 mA W−1, external quantum efficiency of ∼90%, fast speed below 4 ms and broadband spectral coverage up to the near-infrared region. This study demonstrates a high-performance 2D-based P–N diode as multifunctional optoelectronics in a single device, which holds promise to revolutionize electronic and optoelectronic technology.
Introduction
P–N junctions are the basic building blocks for modern optoelectronics including diodes, photodetectors, solar cells and light-emitting diodes. However, conventional bulk semiconductor-based P–N junctions used in current optoelectronics suffer from limitations in terms of their rigidity, brittleness and high-cost form factors. Recently, tremendous efforts have been shifted to two-dimensional (2D)-based P–N junctions and corresponding nano-devices due to their mechanical flexibility, strong light–matter interaction and favourable energy bands as well as the development of large scale growth.1–4 van der Waals (vdW) P–N heterojunctions assembled with isolated 2D crystals such as MoS2–WSe2 have been demonstrated as a new class of artificial systems, but they have modest optoelectronic functionalities in various devices.5–10 On the other hand, multi-transfer process and accurate positioning technology are needed for the construction of vdW heterostructures, which increase the complexity of processing, and the van der Waals gap at the junction can hinder the charge transfer and degrade junction quality. Although direct epitaxial growth of vdW heterojunctions using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique has been developed,11–13 the small size of materials and uncontrollability of their growth limit their practical device fabrication. Along with the development of doping techniques in 2D materials,14–17 lateral P–N junctions have also been achieved in MoS2 and black phosphorous (BP) as photodiodes and photovoltaic cells.18,19 Another strategy to create lateral P–N junctions is local electrostatic doping on 2D semiconducting channels such as graphene,20 BP21 and WSe222–24 with natural ambipolar transport behaviour. However, the responsivity is poor, which is in the order of 0.7–210 mA W−1, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) is limited in this class of P–N diodes due to the used monolayer profile, weak photon absorption (∼3% and 5% absorption for graphene and monolayer WSe2, respectively) and the finite depletion region.22,23
Herein, we report efficient P–N junctions in multilayer WSe2 flakes through local chemical doping and present their applications as diodes, photovoltaic cells and photodiodes with high performances. The P–N diode exhibits remarkable rectifying behavior with an ideality factor close to 1 and current rectification ratio of 105. Its photovoltaic properties can be modulated by the back-gate voltage, and it shows the maximum open circuit voltage, VOC, of ∼0.8 V and power conversion efficiency of ∼6.2%. As a photodiode, its responsivity can reach 468 mA W−1 with a fast temporal response below 4 ms; EQE is as high as 90% and the spectrum coverage can be up to the near-infrared regime (900 nm). Our multilayer WSe2-based P–N diode shows the highest performances among the reported 2D P–N junctions and provides a new promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications.
Results
P–N diode
Multilayer WSe2 was exfoliated on an SiO2/Si substrate, and the electrodes were fabricated via laser writing and thermal evaporation techniques. Pristine WSe2 mainly behaves as a p-type material according to the transfer characteristics (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†), where the hole mobility is about 28.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the switching ratio can reach up to 107. After electron doping by sinking it in reductive solutions (Experimental section in detail), p-type WSe2 is completely converted to an n-type material with electron mobility of ∼44.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 and high switching ratio of 106 (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). The increased mobility may be ascribed to the smaller electron mass than hole mass. It is also noted that the leakage current in all devices is negligible compared to the source–drain current (Fig. S1, ESI†), ensuring that the measured drain current signal is from the WSe2 channel. The excellent dominant p-type and achieved n-type properties indicate high quality of both materials and promise the formation of high-quality P–N junctions by connecting them. To achieve the P–N junction, we deposited 45 nm Al2O3 covering half of the WSe2 channel on one electrode side using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique (Experimental section), as shown in Fig. 1a. The width and length of the channel were around 7.9 μm and 8.5 μm, respectively. The thickness of WSe2 was ∼8 nm from the AFM image (Fig. 1b), suggesting around 12 layers. According to previous reports,25,26 multilayer WSe2 can exhibit high carrier mobility and absorption coefficient, which can contribute to highly efficient light absorption and photocarrier collection. Thus, multilayer WSe2 with a thickness of 8 nm was utilized to achieve high device performances. The Raman spectra also show the typical phonon mode of multilayer WSe2 (Fig. S2, ESI†). Then, we performed the same solution doping processing. During chemical treatment, Al2O3 could protect the underlying WSe2 layers from electron doping, whereas the layers without Al2O3 could be transformed to n-type characters. As a result, a lateral P–N junction was formed at the interface. The device concept is shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 1c. We measured the I–V curves of the device and found remarkable diode behaviour with a rectifying ratio up to 105 (defined by ), indicating a suitable configuration of the P–N diode, which is much better than that of a lateral MoS2 P–N diode.18 To further evaluate the diode properties, we fitted the curves using the Shockley diode equation , where I is the diode current, VD is the applied voltage, I0 is the dark saturation current, T is temperature in Kelvin, n is the ideality factor, and q and k are the elementary charge and Boltzmann constant, respectively. The ideality factor, n, of 1.1 was achieved, demonstrating a nearly ideal P–N diode due to the homogeneous diode structure and less trap states in the junction regime.

Photovoltaic properties
Subsequently, we investigated the photovoltaic properties of the P–N diode. Fig. 2a and b show the I–V curves of the device with linear and semi-log scales, respectively, by applying different back-gate voltages and illuminating the device with 79.6 mW cm−2 incident light with a wavelength of 635 nm. We observed a significant photovoltaic effect with a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (ISC), which are also well-modulated by the back-gate voltage. As control devices, the photovoltaic behaviour was absent in the isolated p-type and n-type WSe2 devices (Fig. S3, ESI†). VOC and ISC were extracted as a function of back gate, as shown in Fig. 2c, demonstrating a monotonous increase with a decrease in the gate voltage, which can reach up to ∼0.8 V and 12 nA, respectively, at VG of −40 V. The transfer curves of the P–N diode at VD of 0 V in the dark and under illumination were also measured (Fig. 2d). No leakage current was observed across the diode in the dark, whereas a significant photocurrent was generated under light illumination. Meanwhile, the photocurrent also increased with decreasing gate voltage, which is consistent with the extracted ISC value shown in Fig. 2c. The output electrical power (defined as Pe = IDVD) generated by the photovoltaic device is shown for different back-gate voltages in Fig. 2e. The photovoltaic power generation also exhibited an increasing trend with decreasing gate voltage and reached the maximum Pe over 3 nW at VG of −40 V. We then calculated the fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) using the equation , where Pe,m is the maximum electrical power, and Pi (defined as Pi = PS, where P is the incident light power density of 79.6 mW cm−2 and S is the active area of ∼67.15 μm2) is the incident light power on the active area. The maximum FF and PCE values reached ∼0.4 and ∼6.2%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2f, indicating high photovoltaic properties of our WSe2-based P–N diode because of high quality of the P–N junction and efficient photo-carrier collection.

Photodiode
For a photodiode, the underlying physical mechanism of photo-detection is the photovoltaic effect based on the separation of photo-generated electron–hole (e–h) pairs by the built-in electric field at the junctions. Thus, our WSe2 P–N diode can also exhibit excellent photo-detection performances due to its extraordinary photovoltaic properties. Fig. 3a shows the zero-bias photocurrent (i.e., ISC) as a function of incident light power at different back-gate voltages. The curves can be fitted using the power-law equation Iph ≈ Pαi with the fitted α ranging from ∼0.85–1.10, indicating the high photo-capture capability in the P–N diode. The photocurrent at a negative gate voltage is higher and the responsivity (defined by , where Iph is photocurrent and Pi is the incident light power on the active area) can reach up to 254 mA W−1 at zero bias and VG of −40 V. Based on the equation , where R is responsivity, λ is the incident light wavelength (here, it is 635 nm), q is the elementary charge, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is calculated to be 49.5% without bias. The high efficiency achieved by the photovoltaic effect is ascribed to the highly efficient photo-carrier generation, separation and collection at the P–N junctions.

(b) Temporal response at VD of 0 V and different VG, which shows a fast decay time (below 4 ms). (c) Responsivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of light power density at VG of −40 V and different VD. (d) Spectral responsivity of the photodiode with a peak from the A-exciton absorption of WSe2. Inset is the current under the pulsed light with different wavelengths ranging from 640 nm to 900 nm with a step of 20 nm. 
According to the time dependence of the diode current with incident light switching on and off (Fig. 3b), the WSe2 photodiode exhibits fast speed with a temporal response below 4 ms, which is limited by the resolution of our measurement setup. It is noted that the dark current is on the order of pA, indicating the negligible leakage current and thus low noise current in the photodiode, which can lead to the high sensitivity and high photo-switching ratio of ∼103. By applying an external reverse bias (in our case, it is positive), the responsivity can be further improved (as shown in Fig. 3c) due to more efficient photo-carrier separation and collection under the external reverse electrical field. At VD of 1 V and VG of −40 V, R and EQE are around 310.6 mA W−1 and 60.6%, respectively; at VD of 5 V, they can reach up to 468 mA W−1 and 91.2%, respectively (Fig. 3c), which are much higher than those reported for WSe2-based photodiodes achieved by local electrostatic doping.22,23 The responsivity also increases with an increase in the incident light power, which can be understood by the change in built-in field and depletion width with an increase in light power. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the n-type region is depleted at VG of −40 V with the Fermi level in the middle of the bandgap. Under high power light illumination, large amounts of electrons are excited to the conduction band, leading to a quasi-Fermi level close to the conduction band. This can result in a larger built-in field and depletion region (Fig. S4, ESI†), leading to more efficient photo-carrier collection and photo-absorption on the larger photoactive area. Meanwhile, the photodiode with bias maintains a fast speed (Fig. S5a, ESI†) and linear light power dependence with α of ∼1 (Fig. S5b, ESI†). We also characterize the noise spectral density (Sn) in our devices and observe that Sn is as low as 10−13 (please see ESI† Fig. S6 for details). The specific detectivity, D*, can be calculated using the equation , where A is the active area of the device. D* can reach 2.5 × 109 Jones at VD of 5 V. From spectral responsivity (Fig. 3d), we infer that our WSe2 photodiode demonstrates broadband spectral coverage up to the near-infrared regime (900 nm). We also observe a peak at ∼760 nm, which is consistent with the A-excitonic absorption peaks in multilayer WSe2.27,28

Discussion
As discussed above, multilayer in-plane WSe2 P–N junction-based devices can act as high-quality nano- and optoelectronics including diodes, photovoltaic cells and photodiodes. Their high performances in terms of rectifying, photovoltaic and photo-detection behaviours indicate their promising potentials in optoelectronic applications. The large built-in field or wide depletion region may benefit from the high quality of components (P or N layers) as well as the homogeneous and seamless P–N junctions and thus contribute to high device performances. The multilayer feature of the WSe2 channels can also enhance photo-absorption compared to the reported monolayer. Table 1 lists comprehensive metrics such as rectification ratio, responsivity, EQE and photovoltaic metrics in our devices and reported 2D lateral and vertical P–N junction-based devices, showing superior optoelectronic properties of our multilayer WSe2 P–N junctions. In our devices, the back-gate voltage plays an important role in tuning their photovoltaic and photodiode performances. The gate-tunability may originate from the influence of the gate on the carrier density in each component through the electrostatic doping effect. To understand this better, we plotted the current modulation of p-type and n-type WSe2 by the applied back-gate voltage (Fig. 4a) and also plotted a schematic diagram of the band structures in each case (Fig. 4b–d). From Fig. 4a, we observed that holes are dominant in the p-type WSe2 channel, which are slowly depleted by increasing gate voltage, indicating gradually increased hole Fermi level (EFp). For the n-type side, the channel is always kept at the depletion region due to the low dark current before VG of 30 V, indicating an unchanged electron Fermi level (EFn). As a result, the built-in field (ϕi) and depletion width (W) can reach the maximum values at a negative gate (Fig. 4b) due to the largest difference between EFp and EFn and efficient hole diffusion into the n-type regime, which thus leads to the optimum photovoltaic properties. Large ϕi can enhance the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, and the wide depletion as a photo-sensing active area can improve photo-absorption and collection. Consequently, this can improve photo-detection performances. On the other hand, both ϕi and W are degraded by increasing gate voltage, leading to weakened photovoltaic and detection properties (Fig. 4c and d).

Conclusions
In summary, multilayer WSe2-based lateral P–N junctions have been fabricated through local chemical doping, which can behave as remarkable diodes, photovoltaic cells and photodetectors. The P–N junctions exhibit ideal diode behaviour with an ideality factor close to 1 and rectification factor of 105. The P–N diode also exhibits promising photovoltaic properties with maximum VOC of 0.8 V and PCE up to 6.2%. Benefitting from the significant photovoltaic effect, our devices show highly efficient photo-detection capability while acting as a photodiode. The photo-responsivity can reach 254 mA W−1 at zero bias and 468 mA W−1 at a reserve bias of 5 V. The photodiode also produces high quantum efficiency in excess of 90%, fast speed below 4 ms and broadband spectral coverage up to the near-infrared region. In addition, the photovoltaic effect can be tuned by the gate voltage through asymmetric electrostatic doping on each component. Our study demonstrates a high-performance P–N diode acting as multifunctional optoelectronics in single device, which will lay the foundation for the next-generation of flexible, high-performance and low-cost 2D-based optoelectronics.
Experimental
Chemical solution doping
N-type WSe2 was achieved by a facile chemical solution doping procedure according to a previous report,33,34 which was optimized by us. The chemical solution used was diluted hydrazine hydrate in isopropanol solvent with 1% concentration in volume. It should be noted that hydrazine hydrate is highly reactive, and a highly concentrated solution can destroy the samples and make doping difficult to control. In our experiment, 200 μl hydrazine hydrate (50–60%) was added to 20 ml isopropanol solvent and then sonicated for 30 min at 50 °C to fully mix the solution. The devices were sunk into the solution for 30 min for electron doping to proceed. Finally, the devices were removed from the solution and dried with nitrogen.
Device fabrication and characterization
Metal contacts were fabricated via laser writing lithography, and gold (70 nm) electrodes were evaporated by thermal evaporation. For the laser writing technique, photoresists (AZ5214) were spin-coated on the substrate with WSe2 samples at 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing on a hotplate at 100 °C for 1 minute. The electrodes were grafted via laser lithography, developed for 40 s and dried using N2 gas. Finally, the devices were annealed at 150 °C for 1 hour in a glovebox to improve the contact quality. On the top half of the WSe2 channel, 45 nm Al2O3 was deposited via the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique (Savannah 200, Cambridge Nanotech). The carrier and purge gas for the entire ALD process was nitrogen. The temperature during the deposition process was maintained at 200 °C. TMA (trimethylaluminium) and H2O precursors were used alternatingly with open valve times of 0.15 and 0.015 s, respectively, separated by 10 s pump time. The resulting growth rate was 0.1 nm per cycle. Before deposition, the devices were annealed for 3 hours in an ALD chamber under vacuum to remove surface adsorbates.
All measurements were performed under ambient conditions and room temperature. Current–voltage characteristics were acquired using an Agilent B1500A semiconducting device analyzer. The optoelectronic response was measured under global illumination using short-pulsed illumination at a wavelength of 635 nm from a 4-channel LASER controlled with an Agilent A33220A waveform generator. The spectral photoresponse was recorded by illuminating the device with fiber-coupled and spectrally filtered light from a supercontinuum light source (SuperKExtreme EXW-4, NKT Photonics).

 	Fig. 1  (a) Optical microscopy image of the WSe2-based device with Al2O3 on top of half of the channel. The scale bar is 8 μm. (b) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the WSe2 channel, describing a thickness of ∼8 nm. (c) Schematic diagram of the WSe2 P–N diode after local doping. (d) I–V curve of the P–N diode. The red curve is the fit with the Shockley diode equation. Inset shows the same curve with a linear scale of the y-axis.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Output curves of the WSe2 P–N diode with a linear scale of y-axis under light illumination of 79.6 mW cm−2, showing significant photovoltaic properties. (b) The same as (a) but on a semi-log scale. (c) Extracted VOC and ISC as a function of back-gate voltage. (d) Transfer curves of the device under dark and light illumination with zero-bias. (e) Electrical power, Pe, as a function of drain voltage, VD, at different back-gate voltages, VG, which shows a maximum power, Pe,m, of 3.30 nW at VG = −40 V. (f) Power conversion efficiency (PCE) and fill factor of the diode under different VG.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Photocurrent of the WSe2 photodiode as a function of light power density at zero-bias and different VG. The linear curves are the power-law fits. (b) Temporal response at VD of 0 V and different VG, which shows a fast decay time (below 4 ms). (c) Responsivity and external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of light power density at VG of −40 V and different VD. (d) Spectral responsivity of the photodiode with a peak from the A-exciton absorption of WSe2. Inset is the current under the pulsed light with different wavelengths ranging from 640 nm to 900 nm with a step of 20 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Transfer curves of isolated P-WSe2 and N-WSe2 transistors. Schematic diagram of the band structures at (b) VG of −40 V, (c) VG of 0 V and (d) VG of 40 V. The red shadow region represents the depletion region of the P–N junctions with the depletion width, W, and built-in field, ϕi.
