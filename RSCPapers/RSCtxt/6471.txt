, Accepted 1st July 2023First published on 3rd July 2023AbstractA highly defective, self-supported porous carbon membrane (HDPCM) electrode is developed via CO2-assisted thermal etching of carbonized wood. The as-fabricated HDPCM is heteroatom-free and features abundant intrinsic carbon defects with enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation capability, and thus exhibits high efficiency for electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion with a faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 81.1% and a partial current density (jCO) of −3.88 mA cm−2 at −0.66 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Notably, after hydrophobic treatment, the HDPCM can be directly used as an integrated gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) in the flow cell, further delivering a much enhanced and relatively stable jCO (−50 mA cm−2 at −0.76 V vs. RHE). This work not only contributes to an effective strategy for creating intrinsic defects on carbon-based electrocatalysts but also provides a new insight into the development of integrated metal-free carbon-based GDEs for large-scale CO2 electroreduction.
Producing carbon-based fuels and chemicals via electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) powered by renewable electricity is being regarded as an attractive strategy to remit the increasing energy crisis and related environmental issues.1 However, performing the CO2RR at a large scale remains a grand challenge because it demands low cost electrocatalysts that possess excellent electrocatalytic activity, high selectivity, and long durability.2 Currently, the most viable electrocatalysts for the CO2RR are transition metal-based materials in various forms, including metallic nanoparticles,3 alloys,4 oxides,5 sulfides,6 single atoms,7 etc. However, these metal-based electrocatalysts usually suffer from several disadvantages such as high cost, low abundance, and unsatisfactory stability due to poisoning and leaching of the active metal component, all of which largely hinder their practical application.
Beyond metal-based electrocatalysts, defective carbon-based materials have recently shown great promise as alternative electrocatalysts for not only the CO2RR8,9 but also other important electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),10 hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),11 and N2 reduction reaction (NRR),12 as well as energy storage13 due to their merits of low cost, natural abundance, high electrical conductivity, tailorable porous structures, excellent thermal/chemical stability, and environmental benignity. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have also suggested that intrinsic carbon defects in carbon materials are the actual active sites for the CO2 electroreduction.9 However, the introduction of intrinsic carbon defects into the carbon matrix is usually realized via the cost-ineffective and energy-extensive plasma etching11a–c as well as KOH etching and doped heteroatom subtraction via thermal treatment at elevated temperatures,9 which are not desirable for the mass production. Moreover, conventional defective carbon electrocatalysts are usually prepared in the form of fine powders, and thus the fabrication of useable electrodes for the CO2RR typically requires a tedious slurry-based casting/coating process using insulated polymers as binders,9 which not only inevitably blocks the active sites but also largely limits electron transfer and multiphase mass transport. Additionally, owing to the weak physical interaction at the interface, the powdery defective carbons would detach from the conductive substrate during long-term CO2 electrolysis at higher current densities, suppressing the practical application of defective carbons in CO2 electrolysis devices such as flow cells and MEA electrolyzers.
Herein, we present an effective CO2-assisted etching strategy for introducing abundant intrinsic carbon defects into the carbon matrix of the self-supported porous carbon membrane derived from carbonized wood. The open, well-aligned porous microchannels inside the HDPCM electrode cannot only facilitate the electrolyte transport but also ensure the exposure of defective active sites. As a result, the HDPCM electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the CO2RR, achieving a FECO over 80% with a recorded current density of −3.88 mA cm−2 at −0.66 V vs. RHE among the reported defective carbons. Notably, benefitting from the integrated macroscopic structure and good mechanical strength, the HDPCM electrode after hydrophobic treatment can also be directly used as a GDE in the flow cell, affording enhanced activity for the CO2RR.
HDPCM electrodes with intrinsic carbon defects were synthesized via a simple yet effective CO2-assisted etching method (see Experimental details in the ESI†), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. In brief, a piece of nature wood (NW) slice was first carbonized to obtain a hierarchically porous carbon membrane (PCM).7b From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1b–d), it can be observed that the PCM possesses an integrated macroscopic structure with numerous open and well-aligned microchannels. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1e and f reveal that the carbon matrix of the PCM electrode exhibits a smooth surface with randomly oriented graphene domains (marked with yellow arrows), suggesting the high regularity of carbon structure possessing relatively fewer defects, which is also evidenced by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern that exhibits two bright diffraction cycles resulting from the (002) and (100) planes of crystallized carbon (inset of Fig. 2e). As a result, the measured contact angle (CA) between the PCM surface and electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO3) drop is 124° (inset of Fig. 1b), indicating the inferior electrolyte wettability of the PCM. The PCM was then subjected to thermal treatment in a flow of CO2 at elevated temperatures (550–800 °C) for 1–3 h to yield HDPCM electrodes. Compared to the PCM electrode, although the HDPCM electrode (prepared at 750 °C for 3 h) exhibits a well-retained porous structure (Fig. 1g–i), the carbon matrix surface is much rougher with significantly improved electrolyte wettability (CA ≈ 0°) (inset of Fig. 1g), and the formation of numerous pores, significant structural destruction and reduced crystallinity (inset of Fig. 1j) of the carbon matrix can be clearly observed (Fig. 1j and k), suggesting the formation of abundant defects. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy maps (Fig. 1l) reveal that C and O are the only main elements in the HDPCM electrode, with a tiny amount of N (<0.1%) being detected on the carbon matrix, implying that the formation of defects presumably stems from the removal of self-doped N species during the CO2 thermal etching process.9d X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was thus conducted to determine the near-surface concentration of the N element in the PCM and HDPCM electrodes. As shown in Fig. 2a, various N species (pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N) with a total content of 0.4 at% are presented in the PCM electrode, which totally vanish in the resulting HDPCM electrode, confirming the complete removal of N species via thermal etching with CO2. Alternatively, the PCM electrode was also thermally treated in the Ar atmosphere instead of the CO2 atmosphere and the resulting electrode (denoted as LDPCM) was characterized. It is notable that although the self-doped N species can also be effectively removed by Ar thermal treatment (Fig. 2a), only fewer holes and smaller local structural distortion can be observed on the surface of the carbon matrix relative to the HDPCM electrode (Fig. S1, ESI†), implying the formation of less intrinsic carbon defects in the LDPCM electrode, as also evidenced by the less reduced CA (≈72°) (inset of Fig. S1a†). These results thus reveal that in comparison with the Ar thermal treatment that can only introduce fewer defects by the removal of N species, the thermal etching of carbon materials under CO2 atomosphere is effective in removing not only the N species but also the lattice carbon atoms, resulting in the formation of abundant N and C vacancies that can further induce the formation of high-density intrinsic carbon defects.

To further demonstrate the effectiveness of CO2 thermal etching for introducing high-density intrinsic carbon defects, a series of spectroscopic characterization experiments were carried out for the electrodes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2b) of PCM, LDPCM, and HDPCM electrodes show two broad peaks at 2θ = 25° and 44°, corresponding to graphitic carbon (002) and (100) reflections, respectively, confirming that they contain a degree of graphitization,9 which is expected to be beneficial to the CO2RR activity of these materials. Compared to those of PCM and LDPCM electrodes, the XRD pattern of the HDPCM electrode shows much weaker (002) and (100) peaks, suggesting a more disordered carbon structure of HDPCM electrode in the bulk phase, consistent with the TEM results. In addition, compared to the PCM electrode, the XRD patterns of both LDPCM and HDPCM electrodes present an obvious upward trend at a low diffraction angle region (1–5°) (Fig. S2, ESI†), suggesting the presence of abundant micropores in these electrodes,14 which can be further confirmed by the results of N2 adsorption/desorption measurements (see discussion below). The Raman spectra of all these electrodes (Fig. 2c) present two characteristic bands at ca. 1342 and 1598 cm−1, corresponding to the D-band of defective sp3 carbon and the G-band of graphitic sp2 carbon,10g respectively. As to the PCM electrode, the intensity of the D-band (ID) is almost close to that of the G-band (ID) with an ID/IG ratio of 1.05, suggesting the presence of relatively fewer defects. After the thermal treatment in Ar, a slightly increased ID/IG ratio (1.12) is observed for the LDPCM electrode, indicating the introduction of more carbon defects due to the disruption of the hexagonal carbon structure via removing self-doped N species at high temperature.9,10 In strong contrast, the ID/IG ratio (1.24) for the HDPCM electrode is much higher than those of LDPCM and PCM electrodes, demonstrating the formation of high-density defective carbon domains in the HDPCM electrode, attributed to the concurrent removal of N species and lattice carbon atoms, which is further confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements. As indicated in Fig. 2d, both the LDPCM and HDPCM electrodes display an obvious EPR signal at g = 2.003, which can be attributed to unpaired electrons on the sp2 carbon atoms of the hexagonal rings.10g The significantly enhanced EPR signal intensity of the HDPCM electrode compared with LDPCM and PCM electrodes thus firmly indicates the higher concentration of unpaired electrons in the electrode, which is probably due to the introduction of abundant intrinsic carbon defects. To further identify the existing form of caron defects, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements were performed. As shown in the C K-edge spectra of Fig. 2e, three main peaks around 285.5, 288.4, and 293.2 eV are observed, which can be attributed to the CC π* (ring), C–N–C π*, and C–C σ* (ring) resonances, respectively.15 Clearly, the PCM electrode shows an evident absorption at 288.4 eV due to the presence of residual N species, which becomes weaker for the LDPCM electrode and almost disappears for the HDPCM electrode, revealing the effective removal of N species via the CO2 thermal etching and thus the formation of ample carbon defects. Accordingly, the pre-edge absorption at ∼284.5 eV for the HDPCM electrode is higher than those of PCM and LDPCM electrodes (inset of Fig. 2e), suggesting that more carbon atoms at the edge positions are created in the HDPCM electrode.9d,g In addition, in comparison with PCM and LDPCM electrodes, the HDPCM electrode presents an increased CC π* (ring) resonance (Fig. 2f), which can be ascribed to the formation of high-density topological defects resulting from the removal of N species and lattice carbon atoms,9f,g which would lead to increased unoccupied states related to the π* antibonding orbital to facilitate electron accumulation and hence increase its capability of accommodating electrons to catalyze CO2 electroreduction.9g
The N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were then performed to investigate the textural properties of the electrodes. As indicated in Fig. 2g and S3, ESI,† the isotherm of the PCM electrode possesses a type I characteristic without any hysteresis loop, indicating the absence of mesopores with a relatively low Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of 158.8 m2 g−1 and pore volume (Vp) of 0.09 cm3 g−1 (Table S1, ESI†). Upon Ar thermal treatment, the SBET and Vp of LDPCM electrode increase to 270.2 m2 g−1 and 0.15 cm3 g−1 because of the formation of more pores resulting from the removal of N species. Compared with the LDPCM electrode, the HDPCM electrode shows a mixed isotherm characteristic of type I and type IV with a pronounced hysteresis loop, indicating that the HDPCM electrode not only features well-aligned microchannels along its cross section but also is simultaneously rich in micro- and mesopores, thus exhibiting a remarkably enhanced SBET of 888.9 m2 g−1 and a Vp of 0.54 cm3 g−1. Such high specific surface area and porosity of the HDPCM electrode not only ensure fast mass transport but also is beneficial for the exposure of defective carbon active sites for catalyzing the CO2RR. On the other hand, since the HDPCM electrode shows many more micropores and high-density carbon defects than LDPCM and PCM electrodes, it can be envisioned that the HDPCM electrode would also offer a matched pore size and more Lewis base sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, which are the prerequisites for efficient CO2RR. To clarify this point, CO2 temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments were then performed. As shown in Fig. 2h, in contrast to PCM and LDPCM electrodes, the HDPCM electrode not only shows a much stronger CO2 physisorption peak at 117 °C but also exhibits a considerably enhanced CO2 chemisorption in the temperature range from 200 to 350 °C.9f This suggests that CO2 thermal etching can effectively introduce more intrinsic carbon defects that can act as Lewis base sites in favor of the adsorption and activation of CO2, which would in turn largely reduce the energy barriers of the subsequent CO2RR. Furthermore, as indicated in Fig. S4, ESI,† the as-fabricated HDPCM electrode can withstand a stress of 31.8 MPa at 70% compression strain and the Young's modulus reaches 16.4 MPa in the compressive stain range of 5% to 15%, demonstrating the excellent mechanical strength and ensuring the use of the HDPCM electrode as a robust self-supported electrode for the CO2RR.
The electrochemical CO2RR performance of the electrodes was first evaluated in a gas-tight H-type cell (see Experimental details in the ESI†). The as-fabricated electrodes were directly used as the working electrode with no need of a slurry-based electrode fabrication process. Cathodic linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was first performed in a N2- or CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 3a, when measured in a N2-saturated electrolyte, the LSV curve of the HDPCM electrode shows much higher H2 evolution reaction (HER) current densities than LDPCM and PCM electrodes at more negative applied potentials because of the formation of more intrinsic carbon defects that also act as the HER active sites in the absence of CO2.11 In a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution, these electrodes all exhibit enhanced current densities than in N2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions in the same applied potential range, indicating that they are active for the CO2RR. Among the three electrodes, the HDPCM electrode shows the largest enhancement in current density when the measurement is switched from N2-saturated to CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions, revealing the highest CO2RR performance of the HDPCM electrode due to the presence of abundant intrinsic carbon defects with high intrinsic catalytic activity.

(f) Stability of the HDPCM electrode for the CO2RR at −0.67 V vs. RHE. 
To further confirm the positive correlation between the CO2RR performance and intrinsic carbon defects, bulk CO2 electrolyses were then conducted in CO2-bubbled 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions (see Experimental details in the ESI†). Gas chromatography (GC) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR) measurements confirm that CO and H2 were only gas-phase products and no liquid products could be detected for all these electrodes. Fig. 3b and c show the faradaic efficiency (FECO) and partial current density (jCO) for CO production over all these three electrodes as a function of applied potential, respectively. As expected, the PCM electrode is almost inert for the CO2RR, producing H2 as the main gas product at faradaic efficiencies of over 95% at the applied potentials ranging from −0.3 to −0.8 V vs. RHE (Fig. S5, ESI†) with only very low FECO of <6% being produced at applied potentials negative than −0.7 V vs. RHE, corresponding to a large overpotential of 0.60 V. Accordingly, the obtained jCO is also lower than −0.1 mA cm−2 over the entire tested applied potential range. The inferior CO2RR activity implies that the small amount of self-doped N species in the PCM electrode can hardly be the active sites. In contrast to the PCM electrode, the LDPCM electrode exhibits a much lower onset potential of −0.3 V vs. RHE for CO2 reduction with a FECO of 10% and the FECO is considerably enhanced over the same applied potential range. Nevertheless, the highest FECO that can be achieved is still lower than 40% even at higher overpotentials due to the favorable HER (Fig. S5, ESI†) and the jCO obtained at each applied potential is only slightly enhanced. These results suggest that the intrinsic carbon defects generated from the removal of N species most likely act as the active sites for selectively reducing CO2 to CO, and the moderate performance improvement of the CO2RR obtained with the LDPCM electrode is due to the formation of fewer defects with low intrinsic activity. In strong comparison with the LDPCM and PCM electrodes, the best HDPCM electrode (prepared by etching PCM using CO2 at 750 °C for 3 h) obtained by optimizing the temperature (Fig. S6, ESI†) and duration (Fig. S7, ESI†) for CO2 thermal etching demonstrates a dramatically enhanced performance for the CO2RR with a high plateau of FECO over 70% between −0.4 and −0.8 V vs. RHE and tunable CO/H2 ratios ranging from 1.3:1 to 4.4:1 (Fig. S8, ESI†) while suppressing the HER with FE below 20% (Fig. S5, ESI†), which can be attributed to the formation of abundant intrinsic carbon defects that are indeed the active sites for the CO2RR. The highest FECO is 81.1% over the HDPCM electrode at −0.66 V vs. RHE, significantly higher than the values obtained with LDPCM (35.1% at −0.68 V vs. RHE) and PCM (3.7% at −0.70 V vs. RHE) electrodes at the nearly same applied potential. No any CO2 reduction products but only H2 could be detected on the HDPCM electrode under a N2 atmosphere (Fig. S9, ESI†), indicating that the CO production is a result of CO2 reduction rather than the electrochemical degradation of the HDPCM electrode. Furthermore, the high CO2RR performance of the HDPCM electrode is further exemplified by the significantly enhanced jCO values being one order of magnitude higher than those obtained with the LDPCM electrode. The jCO at the potential of achieving the highest FECO reaches −3.88 mA cm−2 and the highest jCO is as high as −6.42 mA cm−2 at −0.80 V vs. RHE with a slightly reduced FECO of 68.1%. Such a high CO2RR performance of the HDPCM electrode makes it one of the best metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO in aqueous solutions (Table S2, ESI†).
To get more insights into the high performance of the HDPCM electrode towards the CO2RR, the intrinsic CO2RR activities of the three electrodes were compared by normalizing the jCO to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which was determined by the diffusion-limited current responses of the reversible redox reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solutions (Fig. S10, ESI†).16 As shown in Fig. 3d, the ECSA of the HDPCM electrode is nearly two times higher than those of LDPCM and PCM electrodes, indicating the increased number of active sites as a result of the formation of abundant intrinsic carbon defects via the CO2 thermal etching. However, it can be seen from Fig. 3e that the HDPCM electrode still exhibit much higher ECSA-normalized jCO values than the LDPCM and PCM electrodes, revealing that the carbon defects created by CO2 thermal etching also feature higher intrinsic catalytic activity towards the CO2RR, largely outperforming those obtained by Ar thermal treatment in the LDPCM electrode and the self-doped N species in the PCM electrode. To further compare the intrinsic activities of the electrodes for the CO2RR, the numbers of active site of those three electrodes were estimated by using the Cu underpotential deposition (Cu-UPD) method and the corresponding turnover frequencies (TOFs) per active sites for CO2 electroreduction to CO at different applied potentials were determined based on their partial CO current densities (see Experimental and calculation details in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. S11, ESI,† the HDPCM electrode exhibits much higher TOFs for CO production than LDPCM and PCM electrodes at entire tested applied potentials, and a maximum TOF of 3836.8 h−1 can be achieved at −0.80 V vs. RHE, which is more than one order of magnitude larger than those obtained with LDPCM (TOF = 228.6 h−1) and PCM (TOF = 103.5 h−1) electrodes at a similar applied potential. This result further confirms the high intrinsic activity of the HDPCM electrode towards the CO2RR as a result of the presence of highly active defective carbon sites. Moreover, Tafel analysis (Fig. S12, ESI†) and the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) (Fig. S13, ESI†) of the HDPCM electrode show a smaller Tafel slope and lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) compared with LDPCM and PCM electrodes, demonstrating a faster reaction kinetics for the CO2RR. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the superior CO2RR performance of the HDPCM electrode can be attributed to the formation of abundant defective carbon sites with enhanced intrinsic activity. The stability of the HDPCM electrode was then evaluated by performing a continuous CO2RR at −0.67 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M KHCO3 solution. As indicated in Fig. 3f, the total current density is rather stable with a very slow decay from −7.21 to −6.5 mA cm−2 (jCO: −6.7 to −4.7 mA cm−2) while the FECO is well retained over 74% over a period of 15 h electrolysis, manifesting the excellent durability of the HDPCM electrode for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO. SEM (Fig. S14, ESI†), XRD (Fig. S15, ESI†), and XPS (Fig. S16, ESI†) measurements reveal that the macroscopic porous structures and chemical composition are all well preserved in the electrolyzed HDPCM electrode after 15 h, demonstrating the long-term usability of the HDPCM electrode for the CO2RR.
Although the HDPCM electrode demonstrates high selectivity and stability towards the CO2RR in a H-type cell, its activity, that is the current density, is still largely restricted by limited mass transportation as a result of the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous electrolyte solution. Given the integrated porous structure and excellent mechanical strength, it can be envisioned that the HDPCM electrode can be directly used as an integrated gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) that combines both gas-diffusion and catalyst layers in a flow cell to further enhance the CO2RR performance by removing the CO2 transportation limitation. Typically, a useable gas-diffusion electrode is composed of a hydrophobic gas-diffusion/microporous layer for supplying CO2 and a catalyst layer for providing triphasic active sites for the CO2RR. As revealed by CA analysis (inset of Fig. 1g), however, the as-fabricated HDPCM is highly hydrophilic due to the presence of ample defects throughout the entire electrode, which does not fulfill the requirements of acting as a gas-diffusion electrode used in a flow cell. Therefore, prior to use, a hydrophobic gas-diffusion layer was introduced by spreading a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) suspension that has been demonstrated to be an effective binder with excellent hydrophobicity after drying on the surface of the backside of the HDPCM electrode to create a hydrophobic layer (Fig. 4a).17 After the hydrophobic treatment, the electrolyte CA of the PTFE-modified side is measured to be ∼137°, revealing the excellent hydrophobic property that would be essential to prevent the HDPCM electrode from flooding during the CO2 electrolysis in a flow cell. On the other hand, the other side without PTFE modification keeps the electrolyte wettability well with a slightly increased CA of ∼9°. As a result, numerous stable triphase interfaces enriched with abundant defective carbon active sites are established inside the HDPCM electrode for the CO2RR (Fig. 4b). Afterwards, the PTFE-modified HDPCM electrode was mounted as the cathode in a flow cell and tested for the CO2RR in a 1 M KOH solution (see Experimental details in the ESI†). Fig. 4c shows the FECO and jCO values plotted against the applied potential. It is apparent that the jCO values for the CO2RR over the PTFE-modified HDPCM electrode are far larger than those observed in the H-type cell. Notably, a jCO of −12.2 mA cm−2 and a FECO of 79.2% could be achieved at −0.35 V vs. RHE, much higher than those obtained at nearly the same applied potential in the H-type cell. At more negative applied potentials, although a gradual decrease in FECO can be observed because of the competitive HER, the jCO can still be largely improved. Specifically, a higher jCO of −45.9 mA cm−2 with a FECO of 60% can be achieved at −0.72 V vs. RHE, which is one order of magnitude higher than that obtained in the H-type cell. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4d, at −0.76 V vs. RHE, the PTFE-modified HDPCM-based GDE exhibits a high total current density of over −75 mA cm−2 (corresponding to a jCO of −49.5 mA cm−2 based on the FECO) with a moderate FECO of 66%, which are relatively stable over 9 h electrolysis. These results reveal the great potential of the HDPCM electrode as an integrated GDE that can be readily assembled into a practical electrolyzer for high-performance CO2RR at a large scale.

Conclusions
In summary, an efficient yet simple CO2 etching strategy has been developed, for the first time, to introduce carbon defects into the self-supported porous carbon membrane (HDPCM) electrodes for efficient CO2RR in aqueous solution. The CO2 thermal etching is effective in removing not only all the N-species but also the lattice carbon atoms, thereby resulting in the formation of abundant intrinsic carbon defects together with numerous micropores. Besides, the HDPCM electrode also features an integrated porous structure with high porosity and surface area, excellent electrolyte wettability, and good mechanical strength. Benefitting from these structural merits, the HDPCM electrode thus exhibits excellent CO2RR performance with high and stable selectivity and current density towards CO formation. Additionally, the HDPCM electrode can be further formulated into an integrated GDE via a simple hydrophobic treatment for direct use in a flow cell to achieve a high current density for the CO2RR. This work introduces a new strategy towards high-performance metal-free carbon electrocatalysts for the CO2RR, which can also be extended to develop other carbon-based electrocatalysts for various electrocatalytic energy-conversion reactions.
