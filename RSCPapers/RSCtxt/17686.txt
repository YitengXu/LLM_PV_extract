    , Accepted 5th July 2011First published on 15th August 2011AbstractThe primary driver for development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies is the prospect of very low cost module manufacture leading to affordable solar electricity. This paper presents an economic assessment of OPV based on an existing pre-industrial manufacturing process and the associated detailed material inventory. Using life cycle costing techniques, the life cycle investment cost for a 1kWp, grid-connected OPV system is calculated, taking into account the materials, direct process energy, labour, balance of system components, design and maintenance costs. Assuming values for the performance ratio of the PV system, insolation level, inflation and interest rates, the levelised electricity cost (LEC) is calculated. Under an average solar irradiance of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, a LEC of between 0.19 €/kWh and 0.50 €/kWh was calculated for a 1kWp system, based on modules containing 7% efficient cells and assuming a 5 year module lifetime. The OPV module is found to make up the majority of the system cost while the material costs constitute the largest contribution to the cost of the OPV module. The influence of OPV module lifetime is studied using sensitivity. This paper demonstrates that competitive solar electricity from OPV is within reach if efficiencies of ca. 7% already demonstrated in lab scale devices can be achieved in large area modules and if lifetimes of at least 5 years can be achieved.

Broader context
Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) are often cited as the answer to low-cost and sustainable solar electricity. However, until now there has been little research on the economic assessment of OPV and so this claim has not had the evidence to corroborate it. This paper presents an economic assessment of OPV based on an existing pre-industrial manufacturing process which has previously been analysed from an environmental life cycle perspective. Together these studies provide evidence to support the argument that OPV can provide affordable solar power through low-energy and low-cost manufacture. The ability to compare the cost profile of OPV with conventional PV systems is essential in realising the potential of this technology, and even in the capacity of the PV market as a whole.

1.0 Introduction
Thin film photovoltaic modules based on solution processable organic semiconductors are attracting intense interest as a possible alternative to conventional thin film photovoltaic approaches.1 The attraction of the organic photovoltaic (OPV) approach lies in the potential for very low-cost module manufacture, in comparison with both wafer-based silicon and inorganic thin films, achieved by adapting high throughput printing and coating techniques, and in the potentially disruptive effect of the new technology on the PV market. Inorganic thin film technologies already offer potential for cost reductions in comparison with wafer based silicon through lower energy and material consumption during manufacture.2 Analysis suggests that in the near future, production costs of 0.95 €/Wp should be achievable for a-Si modules with efficiencies of 10%, 1.0 €/Wp for CdTe modules of 12% efficiency, and 1.2 €/Wp for CIGS modules of 14% efficiency.3 Relative to these inorganic thin film technologies OPV enjoys a relative abundance of the raw materials and the potential for even lower material and energy consumption along with high-speed, roll to roll (R2R) processing.
Although the efficiency and lifetime of OPV modules are still inferior to other PV technologies, both have made rapid improvements in recent years4,5 and it is expected that inferior module performance could be tolerated if the system cost is very much lower. OPV offers the additional advantage of low capital investment for manufacture, making the technology financially accessible and feasible even for small scale production. This factor could accelerate the rate of deployment of PV technology in sparsely populated or poor regions.
While cost projections have been worked out for a variety of wafer based silicon3,6,7 and thin film8–10PV technologies, until now only a few studies have addressed the cost of OPV and then with only rough estimates of the material and process costs involved. Such studies indicate a diverse range of module costs, from 36 €/Wp to 0.7 €/Wp,11–16 the lowest estimate was shown to result in an electricity cost of around 0.34 €/kWh under 1700 kWh/m2 annual insolation.12,17 These estimates compare unfavourably with the 2010 average solar module retail price index of 3.31 €/Wp in the European Union (EU), resulting in electricity prices of between 0.11 €/kWh and 0.21 €/kWh,18 and with projected thin film PV costs of around 1.0 €/Wp.3
The lack of detailed cost projections for OPV until now results from very limited production experience. However, a recently demonstrated pre-industrial scale R2R manufacturing process, ProcessOne,19 now provides useful information on procedures, facilities, manpower, energy and materials usage, that allow a thorough assessment of module production cost. ProcessOne utilises sequential deposition of four, solution processable layers: a ZnO electron transport layer; a P3HT:PCBM active layer; a PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer; and a silver ink back electrode, which are deposited onto an ITO coated substrate (Fig. 1). This process has recently been analysed in terms of energy consumption using a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) calculation for the OPV itself and for product integrated OPV.15,20–22 The results are promising and compare well with other thin film technologies: for a typical module containing cells of 3% efficiency, and an active area of 67% of module surface, the direct process energy is 77 MJ/m2 and the energy embedded in the materials is 303 MJ/m2.22 The energy pay-back time (EPBT) of such modules was found to be 1.3 years assuming a system performance ratio of 0.8 and an irradiance level of 1700 kWh/m2/year. Importantly, the analysis thus showed that even with pre-industrial production, the EPBT of OPV is competitive with other, more mature thin film PV technologies. The existence of the LCA model of this process allows a direct comparison of energy and financial costs of each stage of production, and enables the projection of a likely cost evolution in the future given various projections of material and energy costs, although this was beyond the scope of the present study.
 Fig. 1  Economic assessment model of OPV grid-connected system. 
An area of uncertainty in the costs of OPV systems is the cost of the balance of systems (BoS), which has already been shown to significantly increase the EPBT.21 As module cost decreases, BoS costs soon become the limiting factor making the cost of the module less relevant. Yet OPV offers flexibility, adaptability and the possibility of implementation in a variety of contexts such as the integration into building components and textiles, dual function appliances, replaceable modules as well as lower weight that may reduce the BoS cost. However, the BoS costs for OPV still need to be analysed.
In this paper we use a methodology based on Life Cycle Cost (LCC) techniques to estimate the Levelised Electricity Cost (LEC) of grid-connected OPV systems, considering a 1kWp system with module manufacture based on the ProcessOne manufacturing process. In the LCC technique, the Life Cycle Investment Cost (LCIC) is discounted to a reference starting year, following which a LEC can be calculated for given module efficiency and insolation levels. Our method encompasses the effects of module degradation and future technological improvements leading to improved efficiency. We use sensitivity analysis to identify the main factors that influence the resulting LEC.
This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, the economic assessment model is illustrated and calculation figures as well as tables are provided within this model. Key findings are discussed throughout. Then, in section 3, sensitivity analysis provides an insight on the variables in the model. Later, in section 4, the potential of organic-based PV is discussed along with possible future developments of the technology and limitations of the model. Finally, in section 5, the main conclusions are presented.
2.0 Economic assessment model
The economic assessment model involves the material, production and process costs of the PV module, the cost of the BoS components and the operation of the PV system as shown in Fig. 1. In order to establish a PV area related cost we first determine the material costs using material usage data from an existing LCA study22 and manufacturers' price data, and then calculate the production and process costs using the LCA model and known electricity costs. Based on the discovered cost estimates per square metre, the module cost is calculated in €/Wp under standard test conditions (STC) at 1000W/m2 for an assumed efficiency. This is a comparable metric between PV technologies. However, in order to identify the market viability, a LEC in €/kWh is calculated. The LEC is dependent on a number of parameters and variables including lifetime, efficiency degradation, active area, insolation level and mode of financing. The LEC is the conversion from a turn-key system price, in €/kWp installed capacity, to PV electricity cost, in €/kWh over the whole system lifetime. The cost of CO2 saved is omitted from the calculation because of uncertainties in the Carbon Market.
2.1 The OPV module costs

2.1.1 Material costs. 
Market prices of each of the materials used in the six stages of ProcessOne were obtained from up to three different sources. The minimum and maximum prices were determined for each material and are presented in Table 1. Since these costs are related to manufacturing resources for any business venture, VAT was not included. In some cases delivery was included in the quoted price, however, this was deemed to be negligible and so prices which do not include delivery were not adjusted. In addition, where information was available, the price reduction of buying in bulk has been taken into account. The costs were based on the quantities obtained for 1 m2 of OPV module with a PV active area of 67% in the previous LCA study.22

ProcessOne uses a flexible substrate coated with a transparent conducting oxide, in this case indium tin oxide (ITO). The device structure has a cathode on the transparent substrate and an anode on top, a structure which is currently preferred for R2R processing as it avoids evaporated metals. ProcessOne employs a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle interlayer which acts as an electron collector, whilst poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used as a hole collector. In April 2010, a dispute was resolved between HC Stark and Agfa-Gevaert N.V. over intellectual property concerning PEDOT:PSS, suggesting that costs for this material are likely to fall in the future.23 The active layer used in ProcessOne is a blend of poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT), a polythiophene, with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) using chlorobenzene as solvent. The module is encapsulated in a laminate, a target price for which was provided by Amcor who are yet to commercialise their OPV encapsulation product. The minimum price for the encapsulation material costs was taken as a planned Amcor product which aims to provide a 5 year lifetime, which is in line with the assumed module lifetime used in this model. Exchange rates of 1 USD equals 0.75 € and 1 GBP equals 1.17 € were used when prices were provided in these currencies.
Hence the total material costs for OPV manufactured by ProcessOne range between €40.71/m2 and €154.70/m2. Most of the material cost is attributed to the ITO coated PET followed by the active layer and silver electrode, PEDOT:PSS and encapsulation as shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that future developments in performance, materials development or availability, and innovations in device design will influence the impact of different materials. For example, organic transparent conductors such as high conductivity PEDOT:PSS could be used in place of the ITO electrode, and reduce the large impact of ITO on the cost profile.2

2.1.2 Production and process costs. 
As for the material costs, the production and process costs are determined for the six stages of the ProcessOne manufacturing procedure. Production costs comprise the following: electricity used during processing; investment costs for the equipment and infrastructure; labour costs; and overheads. The cost of electricity consumed by the machines in the process is calculated using the amounts of energy consumed found by the recent ProcessOne LCA study,22 multiplied by the minimum, industry electricity prices, or maximum, household electricity prices, as published by the EU commission43 to give minimum and maximum costs of the direct process energy consumption. The results of this are shown in Table 2.

The estimated investment cost of equipment and infrastructure for OPV manufacturing is much lower than for mature PV technologies. In fact, an OPV module manufacturing plant costs around 0.5 M€ for 20,000 m2 production capacity per year having a 95% module yield.15 Assuming a 5% module efficiency this is around 0.5 M€ per megawatt peak annual capacity while mature thin film PV technologies manufacturing investment range from around 0.328 M€ to 3.28 M€ per megawatt peak annual capacity.44 To estimate the levelised capital investment costs per square metre of module over the lifetime of the manufacturing facility, we take into account the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF) using eqn (1): (1)where CRF is defined in eqn (2). Cinvestment represents the total capital cost for an investment spread evenly over its useful lifetime. (2)
Using a CRF for a 10 year plant lifetime, a 20,000 m2 annual production and a 7% real interest rate (r), and assuming that maintenance amounts to 4% of the levelised capital cost we find a capital investment cost of €3.93/m2. Table 3 shows the breakdown of the investment costs for an OPV manufacturing facility.

To estimate the labour cost of OPV module manufacture we used the labour time values and cost per unit time given for the production of small OPV modules and scaled this up to represent manufacture of a 1m2 module.15 The resulting labour cost estimate is €5.32/m2 as shown in Table 4. This value may be an overestimate since the value per unit time of labour (taken as €80 per hour) covers personnel related overhead costs in a Danish environment. Table 4 shows that the largest contribution to labour costs is the preparation and deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layer.

The overhead costs of OPV manufacture, shown in Table 5, are based on a simple cost model for OPV which includes facility rental, miscellaneous and customer warranty costs.12 The miscellaneous costs and warranty were taken at 5% each of the total manufacturing costs, that is, 5% of the sum of the direct process energy costs, investment costs, labour costs and facility rental. This high rate in miscellaneous costs represents research and development costs that are aimed at technical developments intended to reduce market prices as technology matures.

2.1.3 Balance of module costs. 

Table 6 presents a summary of the costs of a one metre squared module, which includes material, production, investment, labour and overhead costs. The model also includes a percentage overhead margin, estimated at 10%, which reflects any freight and profit margins for the OPV modules to the customer. The OPV module or Balance of Module (BOM) costs range between €191.89/m2 and €63.16/m2, when the 10% overhead margin is included. Assuming a cell efficiency of 7%, chosen in line with efficiencies being demonstrated in lab scale devices,45 and a module active area (area covered by cells) of 67%, this results in a module cost of between €4.09/Wp and €1.35/Wp.

The total costs associated with manufacturing a square meter of OPV module given in Table 6, can subsequently be used to find the contribution of the modules to the total cost of the PV system. From the efficiency of the modules, the required area of modules for a certain power rating can be determined, which multiplied by the cost per square meter, gives the value CBOM.
As illustrated in Fig. 3, it is clear that the material costs constitute the largest contribution to the total cost of an OPV module. This may be influenced by the low demand for certain materials, or low availability of some others, such as indium. Increases in the scale of OPV manufacture will ultimately reduce material prices while new low-cost materials may also be available to replace the components that currently limit the cost of OPV modules. In addition, the equity at end of lifetime of the manufacturing plant is not considered, which would act to further reduce module costs.

2.2 Balance of system costs
Additional costs must be included to account for components of a PV system beyond the modules themselves, as well as the costs of installing a system. These BoS costs are strongly dependent on, among other factors, the type of system (e.g. roof-top, building-integrated, ground-based), the efficiency of the modules used, and the country where it is sited. This makes it difficult to formulate general targets. Indicative targets for the BoS costs for roof-top systems are: 0.9 to 1.1 €/Wp in 2013, 0.75 to 0.9 €/Wp in 2020, and under 0.5 €/Wp in 2030.46 The ranges in BoS cost targets mainly correspond to the range in targeted module efficiencies, reflecting the fact that part of the BoS cost is system area-related. In this section the BoS costs are based on a 1kWp, grid-connected, roof-mounted system, with a system lifetime of 25 years to allow comparison with conventional PV systems.
For a grid-connected PV system the associated electronics comprise an inverter, metering and switchgear related equipment. The lifetime of this equipment was taken into account assuming a 10 year inverter lifetime and 20 year lifetime of all other associated electronics. Installation costs considered the initial installation costs that include the design, project management, insurance, scaffolding and other related costs such as wiring and mounting, as well as the associated installation costs when replacing modules. OPV technology is deemed to be easily mounted due to its flexibility and future replacement procedures. The labour costs were based on estimates for glass modules, however, here we consider lightweight, flexible OPV. Hence the subsequently reduced mounting and installation costs are considered to equate, when combined, to the initial labour costs of installing glass modules. Labour costs for replacing modules were estimated at half of the initial installation labour due to the fact that wiring and associated electronics would all be already in place, thus less labour would be required at this point. The initial BOS costs for a 1kWp system are summarised in Table 7. In addition a non-discounted 2% maintenance cost per year is added to the initial BOS and module costs.

2.3 Cost of electricity from an OPV system
In order to calculate the cost of the electricity produced by the OPV system, the Life Cycle Investment Cost (LCIC), that is the total cost of the system, is divided by the total electricity yield of the system over its lifetime. This thus gives a monetary value for each kilowatt hour produced by the system.

2.3.1 Life cycle costs. 
Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is a technique to determine the total cost of ownership by constructing an expenditure profile for the system over its anticipated life-span. To facilitate comparison of electricity cost with other PV technologies, costs are worked out over a period of time comparable with the lifetime of conventional PV systems. We use 25 years in accordance with other studies.13,50 Because the lifetime of OPV modules is uncertain and expected to be shorter than the conventional system lifetime, the model allows for replacement of the OPV modules at the end of their lifetime, as well as for the replacement of BoS components, where appropriate. Thus the cost of the system comprises the sum of the following:
i. Initial investment cost for PV modules, CBOM,
ii. Initial investment cost for system components including inverters, metering, switchgear, mounting structures and installation labour cost, collectively known as BoS, CBOS,
iii. Investment cost for additional PV modules after successive intervals of the module lifetime,
iv. Labour cost of replacing the modules, and
v. Investment cost for additional inverters or other BoS components.
From this sum any discounted value remaining in components with residual life at the end of the assessment period are deducted, known as the cost adjustment.
In the case of both module and BoS, the total LCIC is the sum of initial outlay (i or ii) plus the cost of future investment (iii + iv or v) discounted to the present day assuming some discount rate r, minus the value of unused modules or system components. For the module, (3)where CBOM is the present day cost of the module given by, Lm the module lifetime, T the timeframe being considered (i.e. the system lifetime), int() indicating that i takes integer values only, and CBOMadj the module adjustment cost given by (4)
The real discount/interest rate can be related to the inflation rate, i, and nominal discount/interest rate, n, via (1 + r) = (1 + n)/(1 + i). Similar equations are used to estimate the LCIC of the BoS (see appendix).
For this study, we consider an OPV system of 1 kWp capacity. The area of modules required to give this system capacity, Am, which, multiplied by the cost per m2 of the module, gives CBOM, is determined from the cell efficiency, ηPV, and the percentage of the module that is active cell area, α, according to (5)
The parameters controlling the final system cost are r, ηPV, α and Lm. For our calculations, we fix r at 7%, which is consistent with a nominal discount rate of 10.2% and inflation rate of 3%, α at 67% and vary ηPV in the range 3% to 10% (which corresponds to module efficiencies between 2% and 6.7%) and Lm in the range 1 to 25 years.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, it is clear that for a cell efficiency of 7% and module lifetime of five years the module costs constitute the largest part of the total OPV system costs. This fraction could be reduced through efficiency improvement or through increased active area within a module, both of which would reduce the area of module needed, and thus tackle this bottleneck for low-cost PV modules.
 Fig. 4  Absolute (top) and fractional (bottom) system costs for a 1kWp OPV system with 5 year module lifetime and 25 year system lifetime. 


2.3.2 Energy output. 
A generalised energy output calculation during the lifetime of the PV system is defined in eqn (6), considering module replacements, averaged linear degradation to a defined limit, δavg, at which point the module is considered as at the end of its useful life, and performance ratio, PR, for the system: (6)where Hyr is the annual radiation; ηPV is the efficiency of the PV active area; PR is the performance ratio of the system, considered at 85%, which accounts for system losses and soiling effects; Am is the area of module required; T is the PV system lifetime, chosen as 25 years; t is the year and δavg is the average linear degradation given by (7)where Lm is the module lifetime assumed to be 5 years and δ is the PV efficiency degradation limit.
Here we fix Hyr at 1700 kWh/m2 per year, representative of the Southern European solar resource and δ at 80%. In Fig. 5, the yearly energy output is plotted for two scenarios. In one case ηPV is 7% and remains constant over the lifetime of the system, which results in a total yield, over 25 years, of 32,513 kWh. The system output was also considered for the case where advances in OPV technology lead to replacement modules being increasingly efficient. For this scenario, an initial cell efficiency of 3% was used, corresponding to the efficiency of present day R2R manufactured cells51 and developments were considered according to the IEA PV roadmap 2010,46 which stipulates a linear development in cell efficiency of 1.065 annually over the next 25 years. This gives a total system output of 71,114 kWh over the 25 year system lifetime.
 Fig. 5  Electrical Energy Production considering average linear degradation. 
The annual output of a crystalline silicon based 1kWp PV system is also included in Fig. 5 for comparison. The output of this system accounts for a linear degradation in the module efficiency to a limit of 80%, according to most mature PV technology manufacturers' warranty. For simplicity when considering efficiency development, the area of OPV modules remains constant while the efficiency increases. Hence any efficiency increase results in an increase in electricity production which will ultimately lower the LEC. On the other hand if one considers lowering the PV active area such that the system remains at 1kWp, resulting in lowering the module costs, a similar LEC would be found.
The comparison of the static efficiency and evolving efficiency scenarios in Fig. 5 demonstrates the potential impact of continual technical innovation on the projection of electricity costs, and correspondingly, EPBT. OPV efficiency developments and relatively short module lifetimes could instigate a competitive edge towards low solar electricity costs due to the increase in annual energy production per unit area, or lower module costs required for a 1kWp system, realised over the course of the system lifetime.


2.3.3 Energy cost. 
The LEC for a 1 kWp system could be calculated from the LCIC divided by the total PV energy output. Considering the reference parameters of a 5 year module lifetime, an active area efficiency of 7%, average annual radiation of 1700 kWh/m2, the LEC estimates for OPV range from 0.19 €/kWh to 0.50 €/kWh, when technical development is neglected. If technical development over the lifetime of the system is included, and starting with 3% efficient cells, as described earlier, costs of the LEC range between 0.16 €/kWh and 0.47 €/kWh.

Fig. 6 shows the LEC in comparison with the published cost ranges of electricity from other clean sources. The resulting OPV electricity costs are not favourable against current centralised power stations and wind energy. However, when considering technical developments in OPV efficiency, the LEC of OPV power is competitive with mature PV and Solar thermal technologies.

3.0 Sensitivity analysis
Since future developments in technology and scale-up of manufacture are likely to affect the parameters controlling LEC, the sensitivity of the LEC to these parameters, was analysed. The minimum costs, giving a LEC of 0.19 €/kWh, were taken as the baseline for this sensitivity analysis, assuming a PR of 0.85, 7% active area efficiency, 5 year lifetime modules, 67% PV active area coverage and 1700 kWh/m2 yearly insolation. The sensitivity analysis was performed by adjusting the variables from −80% to 80% from the baseline.
The factors which have the most significant impacts on the LEC are: system performance ratio; module lifetime; module active area coverage; insolation; and PV efficiency, as shown in Fig. 7. The relationship of the LEC with most of these factors is reciprocal which means that improvements in the parameters have a smaller effect than deterioration in the parameters relative to the baseline.
 Fig. 7  Significant variables effecting LEC. 
Both BOM and BOS costs have a linear effect on the LEC (Fig. 7). Since the BOM cost has the major share of the system cost, it has a larger effect on the LEC than the BOS costs. Of the BOS costs, the cost of associated electronics is the most significant component. However, total BOS costs may have only a maximum effect of 0.07 €/kWh on the LEC. As experience develops in this field, a more sophisticated sensitivity analysis could be done, for example, employing statistical methods.53
4.0 Discussion
One important question regarding organic-based PV technologies is what module lifetime is required for the technology to be a competitive commercial option for PV power generation. Although short lifetime is deemed acceptable for some consumer products already in production,45 long term power generation requires a competitive cost over the system lifetime rather than simply a low capital cost. In order to address the effect of OPV module lifetime, we calculated the LEC of OPV power as a function of Lm, Fig. 8, with different cell efficiencies and compared this with the LEC of wafer based silicon PV. A cell efficiency of 3% with no technology development would require a lifetime of 15 years to compete with wafer-based silicon PV. On the other hand, competitiveness with silicon PV is reached for module lifetimes of less than 5 years when cell efficiencies reach 7% or more. Hence as previously suggested in other studies,16 low lifetime or low efficiency OPV modules can be competitive with mature PV technologies, even at small scale manufacturing with current cost prices, assuming recycling of the modules, which has been neglected in this model, does not pose a major issue. However, a certain lifetime and efficiency must be reached for OPV technology to be economically viable and sustainable.
 Fig. 8  
          LEC for OPV technology for different cell efficiencies, as a function of module lifetime. The LEC for wafer based silicon PV is shown for comparison. 
Current lab cell efficiencies look promising in reaching the required efficiencies for the technology to be competitive. However, currently, competitive lifetimes are yet to be confirmed for large scale devices and reports have suggested realistic lifetimes far below 5 years. A recent study analysed the variability between different research groups in performing lifetime studies as well as performing a comparison of different testing procedures. These studies constitute the first steps towards establishing standard procedures for an OPV lifetime characterisation. Results from this study concluded that the lifetime of modules produced from ProcessOne is in the region of a few hundred hours for modules left unsealed along their edges.4
Cost estimates were based on LCC techniques, where uncertainty increases for expenditure further in the future. This uncertainty is further exacerbated by the fact that replacement costs are still unknown as this approach has not been realised in a real world application. However one expects that OPV module fixing design and procedures will be simpler compared to conventional PV panels due to the flexibility and lightweight of OPV modules. The system components were also based on mature PV technologies as there is still a lack of data for PV micro-generation systems employing OPV modules.
There are a number of factors which have the potential to lead to cost reductions within the BoS. As module prices fall, it is possible that inverter prices will also drop as profit margins are reduced by the lower total cost of the PV system. Prices for BoS components are also likely to fall as demand increases and the PV market expands. In addition, further reductions may result from inverters and other electronic components integrated into individual modules and other such advances which would lead to simplified installation and thus reduced cost.
This model does not take into account the performance and quality of the materials used in the manufacture of OPV modules. This is a potential issue as the lower cost material prices presented in Table 1 are likely to lead to lower efficiency modules or a lower module yield from the manufacturing machinery, which would adversely affect the cost per Wp of such modules. However, prices for materials are likely to fall as production volumes increase. Currently many of the raw materials used in OPV manufacture are only produced in small volumes due to limited demand and as such have the potential for large cost reductions with scale-up in their production.
Scale up in the production of OPV modules would be expected to lead to further reductions in the LEC through development in the efficiency and lifetime of the technology as well scale-up in manufacturing in the same way as expected cost reductions in the raw materials. Thus a steep learning curve is anticipated for OPV technology in the near future and has already been observed to date.15,54 Innovation both at the material and module integration level can help in addressing possible future materials concerns and cost reductions in delivering organic photovoltaic technologies. These developments may have a decisive role in defining the future relative cost level and market penetration for emerging organic-based photovoltaics.
The issue of recycling modules is of much greater importance with organic photovoltaics compared to other PV technologies due to the short lifetime of OPV modules. Thus far there is no experience of end of life treatment of OPV and thus costs associated with this were neglected in this model. However, there is speculation that recycling of OPV could be a relatively simple process due to the nature of materials involved. For example, the dominant material in OPV, by mass, is the flexible substrate. In the case of ProcessOne this is PET which can potentially be easily recycled. However, there are of course a number of uncertainties and the issue of recycling OPV modules is the subject of ongoing research.
Despite these issues associated with short lifetime modules, there are also some advantages. The cost profile of an OPV based system highlights another potential advantage for this technology. Through low lifetime modules the total cost of the system is spread over a number of years making it increasingly affordable to consumers unable to pay for the large capital cost of conventional PV. This is particularly relevant in the developing world, where solar photovoltaics have a huge potential for improving rural livelihoods.55
In addition, the low capital outlay of manufacturing facilities allows decentralised, small scale manufacture which opens up the possibility for very different business models in OPV manufacture compared with silicon based photovoltaics. Decentralised, R2R manufacture also allows for production on a massive scale and shows that R2R processed photovoltaics are the only technology capable of producing a gigawatt a day.
5.0 Conclusion
This paper has illustrated cost assessment on a practical R2R coating procedure used for small-scale manufacturing flexible polymer solar cell modules, also known as ProcessOne, and has assessed the economics behind a complete 1kWp, grid connected, micro-generation system. The analysis showed that the total cost of an OPV module ranges from €63.16/m2 to €191.89/m2, corresponding to between 1.26 €/Wp and 3.84 €/Wp for a 5% efficient module. This is based on present day technology and material costs, and thus can be seen as an upper limit for module costs. Extending the analysis to a 1kWp system operating for 25 years and utilising modules containing 7% efficient cells and a 5 year lifetime, gave a total system discounted cost of between €6,019 and €16,270. Under an average solar irradiance of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, an LEC of between 0.19 €/kWh and 0.50 €/kWh could be realised with such a system.
This analysis showed that potential bottlenecks to low cost OPV production lie largely in the cost of raw materials and not in the processing costs. This shows that there is limited opportunity for cost reductions through improved processing methods in the case of a R2R manufacturing process such as ProcessOne, although improvements in processing could lead to more efficient use of materials. In particular the ITO transparent conducting layer was shown to dominate the cost of a module as has been previously observed,15 as well as dominating the embedded energy in a module.22 This finding highlights the need for alternative transparent conductors, a number of examples of which are being explored such as carbon nanotube films, high-conductivity PEDOT and metal nanowires. In addition, the large contribution of PEDOT:PSS and silver ink to the cost of the module further motivates a search for lower cost electrode materials.
The LEC does not only depend on the manufacturing cost but also on module performance, location and BoS costs. The BoS costs may contribute up to 36% of the system costs in organic-based PV systems, however, as module costs fall this percentage would be expected to increase. Minimising BoS costs by innovative system design and building integration is aided by the flexible, lightweight and potentially transparent nature of OPV, which could be a significant advantage for this emerging technology. Although the potential for such cost reductions in the BoS compared to conventional silicon based modules is unknown, the nature of OPV technology is also likely to open up new markets and applications for photovoltaics. In addition, as the cost of modules decrease, prices for inverters and the associated electronics are likely to fall as consumer demand forces the inverter cost to remain comparable to the module costs for a system, similar to past trends in battery costs for consumer electronics.
This model shows that currently achievable cell efficiencies of 7%, if reproducible in large area modules, could already be competitive with conventional silicon technology if 5 year OPV module lifetimes could be achieved. Even more encouraging is the LEC found when the development in the efficiency of OPV technology is accounted for, as shown in Fig. 5. This shows the potential for a competitive cost even if the initial modules installed contain cells of only 3% efficiency and without factoring in expected future reductions in the cost of modules (Fig. 6). In the case of a small scale, grid-connected system, lifetimes of around five years, or up to fifteen years for very low efficiency modules, need to be achieved if OPV is to become competitive with conventional photovoltaic technologies in the domestic micro-generation market. However, the numerous advantages of OPV in their potential for unique architectural and product integrated design, R2R processing methods, and low initial capital costs (both for systems and manufacturing facilities), mean that markets will still exist for this technology despite inferior performance compared to conventional photovoltaics.

Broader context
Organic Photovoltaics (OPV) are often cited as the answer to low-cost and sustainable solar electricity. However, until now there has been little research on the economic assessment of OPV and so this claim has not had the evidence to corroborate it. This paper presents an economic assessment of OPV based on an existing pre-industrial manufacturing process which has previously been analysed from an environmental life cycle perspective. Together these studies provide evidence to support the argument that OPV can provide affordable solar power through low-energy and low-cost manufacture. The ability to compare the cost profile of OPV with conventional PV systems is essential in realising the potential of this technology, and even in the capacity of the PV market as a whole.
