    , Accepted 23rd September 2021First published on 28th September 2021AbstractRecently, the demand for semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (SPSCs) to serve as semitransparent windows for urban building and automobile applications has grown. However, it is challenging to prepare high-quality ultra-thin perovskite films, significantly restricting the development of SPSCs. In this paper, we report an all-round performance improvement of ultra-thin perovskite films and SPSCs prepared by using a thermal-pressed recrystallizing (TPR) method. The average grain size of perovskite films increased from ∼340 nm to ∼1.64 μm, after the TPR treatment, along with a dramatic decrease in the surface root mean square (RMS) roughness from ∼14.9 nm to ∼1.04 nm. The SPSCs fabricated by the TPR method showed a significant improvement in all-round performance, such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, power conversion efficiency, transmittance and stability. The average power conversion efficiency showed a significant increase of up to 32.8% after TPR treatment, indicating the potential for the development of high performance semitransparent photovoltaic windows.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells have attracted tremendous research interest in the past few years due to the low-temperature solution-based fabrication process and high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)1 achieved by the suitable and tunable band gaps, high absorption coefficients and excellent carrier transport abilities of organic–inorganic perovskite materials.2,3 The high PCEs, low cost and low-carbon solution fabrication techniques make the perovskite solar cell an excellent candidate for photovoltaic power generation, which is currently dominated by silicon-based solar cells.4,5 Moreover, the flexible preparation methods of perovskite materials make it possible to fabricate semi-transparent perovskite solar cells (SPSCs), which have shown increasing demand as semitransparent windows in urban building and automobile applications to provide both shading and green electricity.6,7
SPSCs are usually composed of an ultra-thin light absorber and transparent electrodes for optical transparency, which is a parameter as important as photovoltaic performance. The crystal grains in the ultra-thin light absorber tend to be only 100–200 nm or less and are accompanied by a large number of pinholes due to the thickness, which leads to poor photovoltaic performance.8–10 Yuan et al. demonstrated the improvement of the quality of ultra-thin light absorbers through component engineering.11 Wang et al. constructed textured substrates for sufficient light-harvesting of ultra-thin light absorbers to improve the photovoltaic performance.12 However, these efforts have not fundamentally improved the crystallinity of the films. Some approaches applied to thick film devices, such as combined annealing processes13–15 and additive engineering,16–18 have not yielded good results.
In the past few years, we worked on the thermal-pressed growth of high-quality perovskite films.19–21 Pressure can induce horizontal grain growth and grain boundary fusion, resulting in positive changes in their photovoltaic performance. Pressure-related preparation methods have been applied to detectors and solar cells.19,22 However, previous studies were based on relatively large film thicknesses (>500 nm). In this work, we propose a thermal-pressed recrystallizing (TPR) method to grow high quality ultra-thin MAPbI3 films. By applying uniform pressure to the MAPbI3 film during the annealing process, an average grain size of more than 1.64 μm was obtained. The final MAPbI3 films showed markedly reduced grain boundaries, high smoothness and high coverage. Based on the high-quality ultra-thin MAPbI3 films and ultra-thin metal electrodes (Au, 10 nm), SPSCs with a maximum efficiency of 13.45% (average transmittance of 18.7%) were achieved, i.e., 81.4% of the device based on the thick electrode (100 nm). Thus, the proposed TPR method can facilitate the development and application of SPSCs.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the fabrication procedure. The precursor film was prepared by a one-step spin-coating method.23,24 Then the recrystallization process takes place in a closed container with controllable temperature, a hydrophobically treated silicon wafer is covered on top of the film, and uniform pressure is transmitted to the precursor film through the silicon wafer. Finally, when the pressure was released, the obtained MAPbI3 film was denoted as the “TPR film”.

Fig. 2 shows the top- and cross-sectional-view morphology of the MAPbI3 precursor and TPR films. Crystal grains of the precursor film shown in Fig. 2a are irregular rod- or polygonal-shaped with an average grain size of 340 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The cross-sectional-view SEM image shows multiple grain layers in the vertical direction (Fig. 2c), which can significantly hinder the transport of charge carriers. Compared with the precursor film, substantial grain boundary fusion was observed in the TPR film (Fig. 2b), as well as a significant increase in grain size, up to a micrometric scale (1.64 μm). Auxiliary lines were added in the image for convenient observation of an individual grain as large as 3.1 μm in the lateral dimension; the original image is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Accordingly, a large number of grain boundaries disappeared, and the remaining boundaries became blurred. To better display the statistical parameters of the crystal grains, the average grain size was calculated to be 1.47 μm from a larger range AFM image (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). The cross-sectional image (Fig. 2d) shows that all of the grains vertically spanned the full film thickness, which is similar to single crystal films. It was confirmed that the grain boundaries in the precursor films were effectively fused along the vertical and lateral dimensions under the designed thermal-pressed conditions. Compared with the precursor film (185 nm), the thickness of the TPR film (170 nm) was observed to decrease, which can be ascribed to the effect of pressure (Fig. 2c and d). The nearly seamless connection of crystals in the TPR film is further confirmed by the AFM images (Fig. 3d and e). The grain boundaries of the TPR film were found to be very few and shallower in depth, unlike the clear and numerous grain boundaries in the precursor film. The RMS roughness of the TPR film (5 μm × 5 μm) was only 1.04 nm, which is much smaller than that of the precursor film (14.9 nm). The ultra-flat surface of the TPR film is confirmed by the insignificant surface undulation in Fig. 3f. Our results imply that the influence of the grain boundaries on device performance may be reduced to a very low level by using the TPR treatment.

To further investigate the influence of the TPR treatment on recrystallization, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the precursor film and TPR film were recorded. As shown in Fig. 4a, the two films were both identified to be MAPbI3, with a tetragonal I4/mcm crystal structure. Compared with that of the precursor film, the XRD pattern of the TPR film shows sharper (110) and (220) diffraction peaks with a smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM),25 demonstrating the high crystal quality. Fig. 4b shows the normalized steady-state PL spectra of the precursor and TPR films. Compared with that of the precursor (∼771 nm) film, the PL spectrum of the TPR film exhibits a blue-shifted PL peak at ∼766 nm. Generally, the PL emission is related to the exciton recombination channel concerning the bandgap trap state. The blue-shift phenomenon implies that the TPR film may have a lower trap density around the band-edge than the precursor film.26,27 The PL decay curves of the precursor and TPR films on the silicon wafer were further investigated (Fig. 4c). The curves can be fit with a single exponential decay function, consistent with previous reports,28–30 which implies that photogenerated carriers are determined by trap-assisted recombination.28 The TPR film exhibited a prominently longer lifetime (472.65 ns) than the precursor film (273.15 ns), demonstrating the effectively suppressed carrier recombination induced by the trap state after the TPR process. The low trap density (ntrap) was also verified by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 4d and e shows the J–V curves of the hole-only devices (ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/Spiro-MeoTAD/Au) for the precursor and TPR films. The trap density, ntrap, in the perovskite film can be determined using the following equation: (1)wherein VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electronic charge, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant of MAPbI3, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity.31,32 The TPR film exhibited a trap state density of ∼1.54 × 1016 cm−3, which was lower than the precursor film (∼3.95 × 1016 cm−3). Since trap states are unfavorable for the movement of carriers, it is reasonably speculated that enhanced carrier mobility and diffusion length may be expected in TPR-based films and devices. In addition, we also studied the transmittance of MAPbI3 films. The average transmittance of the TPR film (27.54%) is slightly higher than that of the precursor film (26.05%) as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Theoretically, the precursor film has more grain boundaries which may increase the transmittance. However, the TPR film has a lower thickness (∼170 nm) than that of the precursor film (∼185 nm). This decrease in film thickness compensates for the optical transmittance through the grain boundaries, resulting in slightly higher transmittance than that of the precursor film.

The effects of pressure and thermal treatment were studied separately. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the SEM image of the MAPbI3 film annealed (100 °C) for 6 h under a N2 atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. Amorphous particles and voids indicate that the MAPbI3 film had undergone severe decomposition, which is confirmed by the peak position of lead iodide in Fig. S6 (ESI†).33,34 The thermal treatment is the most common method to improve crystallinity, but prolonged annealing leads to decomposition.35 Combined with the above TPR results, we infer that the sealed high-pressure circumstance can effectively inhibit the release of MA+ ions and thus avoid the decomposition of MAPbI3 under long-term annealing. When only pressure was applied, the fine grains were tightly packed and pinholes were eliminated (see Fig. S7a, ESI†). It is noticeable that the roughness drops to 5.63 nm, attributed to the disappearance of the irregular protrusion of the surface (see Fig. S7c, ESI†). Therein, the silicon wafer with the pressure suppressed grains grows along the direction perpendicular to the substrate (thus suppressing three-dimensional island growth along the vertical direction), similar to the space-confined technique.36 When the experimental temperature increased to 100 °C, the fusion of adjacent grains occurred via the more active ion diffusion induced by high temperature.37 As can be seen in Fig. 2b, large grains are accompanied by almost invisibility of the boundaries. The formation of final high quality MAPbI3 films is attributed to the synergetic effect of temperature and pressure. The optimal experimental conditions for TPR treatment are 150 MPa at 100 °C for 6 h. We note that if a smaller pressure, such as 100 MPa, was used, films with divided crystal grains and deep grain boundaries would be obtained. Although the grain size increased to 450 nm (Fig. S8a, ESI†), the divided crystal grains and the drop-in film coverage were disadvantageous to solar cells.38 The cause of grain separation is that the smaller pressure cannot effectively make the crystal grains tightly arranged and the fusion of grain boundaries leads to a large number of voids. In addition, sufficient time is also required for boundary fusion, for which we studied the results with different treatment times, and the crystal grain details are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). TPR treatment (150 °C, 100 Mpa for 1 h) transformed the crystal grains into regular polygons, but there is no significant increase in grain size (see Fig. S9a, ESI†). The most significant modification is that the grains began to fuse in the vertical direction, part of the grains spans the entire film thickness (see Fig. S9b, ESI†). As the treatment time increased to 3 h, a large number of the shallow grain boundaries disappeared and the adjacent grains fused, which led to the appearance of some larger grains (see Fig. S9c, ESI†). It is worth mentioning that no grain boundary is seen in the vertical direction at this stage (see Fig. S9d, ESI†). Next, the small grains around the large grains continued to fuse and the deep grain boundaries became blurred, and thus the average grain size increased to 1.34 μm as shown in Fig. S9e (ESI†). We also studied the film with a longer TPR treatment than 6 h; no obvious increase in grain size was observed, but decomposition was visible, indicating that 6 h is a suitable time for TPR treatment. A schematic illustration of the crystal growth process from the precursor film to the resultant high-quality film is proposed in Fig. 5. The sequence of grain boundary fusion vividly reflects the process of grain growth: first, a vertical grain boundary in the vertical direction; next, a shallow grain boundary in the horizontal direction; and finally, a shallow grain boundary in the horizontal direction.

To verify the suitability of the TPR film in SPSCs, solar cells based on TPR films were fabricated. Devices based on precursor MAPbI3 films were also prepared as a control. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the device structure of SPSCs is ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/C60/BCP/Au (10 nm)/BCP (20 nm). Table 1 summarizes the average performance parameters of TPR and control SPSCs illuminated through ITO. Compared with the parameters of the control devices, all the parameters of the TPR devices exhibited a significant improvement. When the devices were illuminated from the ITO side, the TPR devices showed an increase of 4.5%, 11.3% and 15.3% for Voc, Jsc and FF, respectively. As a result, the PCE showed a significant increase of 32.8%. These results confirm that the TPR strategy was helpful for the improvement of the performance of SPSCs.

Fig. 6b shows the J–V curves of the SPSCs illuminated through the ITO side. We note that the highest obtained PCE of TPR devices was ∼13.45%, which is significantly improved compared to that of the control device (∼10.01%) because of an overall increase in Voc, Jsc and FF. We also measured the forward and reverse J–V scans at a scan rate of 110 mV s−1 (Fig. S11, ESI†). Both TPR and control devices present weak hysteresis owing to the advantages of inverted PSCs. The corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the two devices illuminated through the ITO are shown in Fig. 6c. The J–V curves of the best control and TPR devices illuminated through the Au side are shown in Fig. 6d. Compared with Fig. 6c, the EQEs in Fig. 6e show a significant decrease in the full range due to the lower transmittance of the Au electrode and C60, which can explain the decrease of device performance when illuminated through the Au side. Furthermore, the calculated Jsc was found to be consistent with that obtained from the J–V measurement, indicating the authenticity of the measured Jsc. Although the device performances were significantly improved via the TPR treatment, their optical transmittances did not get worse. As shown in Fig. 6f, the average optical transparency of the TPR SPSCs exhibit a slight increase from 17.9% to 18.7%. The average optical transparency (400–800 nm) was calculated according to the reported method.39 This increase in both optical transparency and photovoltaic performance is highly desired for SPSCs.

To eliminate the adverse effect of ultra-thin metal electrodes, opaque PSCs with 100 nm Ag electrodes were also prepared and their device structure is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Fig. 7a shows the typical J–V curves of the TPR and control PSCs. The highest PCE of the TPR devices was ∼16.53%, which is a significant improvement compared with that of the control device (∼13.38%). The hysteresis indices (HIs) of the two devices are both close to 0, indicating weak hysteresis (Fig. 7a).40 The Voc, Jsc, FF, average PCE and highest PCE of the TPR and control devices are listed in Table 2. Consistent with the parameters of the SPSCs, all of the parameters were observed to improve. The increase of Jsc can be correlated with the large grain size, because a single grain can connect hole transport and electron transport layers (Fig. 2d). While the marked multicrystal feature can be observed in the control film (Fig. 2c), the photo-generated charges are significantly hindered by the grain boundaries passing through the absorber, which leads to significant charge loss by recombination.15 The TPR treatment can effectively reduce grain boundaries, consequently significantly improving the EQE in the visible light spectral range and increasing the Jsc in the TPR devices. The corresponding EQEs and the calculated Jsc values are shown in Fig. 7b. The calculated Jsc values were found to be consistent with those obtained from the J–V measurement. We also measured the steady-state measurements of Jsc and PCE according to the reported method,41 and the corresponding results are given in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The experiments were conducted at a fixed bias voltage of 0.876 V for control PSCs and a fixed bias voltage of 0.902 V for TPR PSCs with continuous light illumination for 400 s. Interestingly, we found that the end PCE of the TPR device was the same as the initial PCE, indicating no decay in this period. For the control PSC, only ∼97.15% PCE was maintained after 400 s. This reveals the accuracy of our efficiency characterization.

To investigate the influence of the TPR treatment on the charge recombination loss of the PSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed (Fig. 7c). The low-frequency region in the EIS spectra represents the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the recombination chemical capacitance (Crec) feature in the perovskite solar cells.42 The fitting results indicate recombination resistance values of 556.8 Ω and 2387 Ω, for the control and TPR PSCs, respectively. These results demonstrate that the TPR treatment can strongly suppress the recombination of charge carriers by reducing the grain boundaries and increasing the density; these changes are beneficial for Voc and the FF.43 This is also evidenced from the results of Voc as a function of the light intensity (Fig. 7d), where the deviation of the slope from kT q−1 suggests a combination of trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination in the devices.44,45 It can be seen that the TPR PSC shows a smaller slope of 1.028 kT q−1 compared to that of the control (1.579 kT q−1), which means that the defect-assisted recombination is suppressed after the TPR process. These results are consistent with the decreased trap state density.
There are two possible reasons for the photovoltaic performance of SPSCs to be lower than that of PSCs. One is that thinner active layers are required in SPSCs to achieve better transmittance. However, better transmittance commonly means worse optical absorption ability, which tends to decrease the photovoltaic performance of the device. The other reason is that SPSCs require both bottom and top transparent electrodes. For top metal electrodes, better transmittance leads to a decrease in the film thickness or ratio of film coverage. Both factors often lead to a decrease in their electrical properties due to the increase in film inhomogeneity and discontinuity, especially when the films were deposited on rough organic layers. The TPR film provides the possibility of preparing a high-quality ultra-thin metal electrode layer because of its high-quality film surface. Fig. 8b shows the AFM image of the TPR film covered with C60 and BCP, yielding an RMS of 0.608 nm, which is significantly smaller than that of the control film (7.26 nm), as shown in Fig. 8a. Furthermore, the line-profile image shows that the surface fluctuation of the control film exceeds 10 nm, which is unfavorable for the deposition of the high-quality ultra-thin electrode film; the corresponding position of the cross-section is shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). In contrast, the TPR film has an extremely flat surface. After deposition, the RMS roughnesses of the Au film were found to be 0.991 nm and 6.77 nm for the TPR and control films, respectively (Fig. 8c and d). The Au film deposited on the TPR film was found to be flat and continuous, which exhibits a more uniform surface potential than that of the control film (see Fig. S15, ESI†). The sheet resistance of the obtained Au film (∼17.1 Ω sq−1) measured by a four-probe method is significantly smaller than the value (∼26.4 Ω sq−1) of the control film (see Table S2, ESI†). This may partially explain the difference between the photovoltaic performances of the control and TPR SPSCs.

To study the stability of TPR SPSCs, the 2000 s continuous output test in an ambient environment, with a humidity of 15%, was performed. As shown in Fig. 9a, the PCE of the TPR SPSCs maintained a stable output without a significant change during the test. In contrast, the PCE of the control SPSC showed a gradual decay from the start of the test. In the end, ∼97% of the initial value was left in the case of the control SPSC. We also measured the 240 h aging test of the unencapsulated control and TPR devices, as shown in Fig. 9b. For the control SPSC, the ratio of final to initial PCE was ∼43.7% after a 240 h aging test in air. In contrast, the TPR SPSC retained ∼74.4% of its initial PCE after 240 h in air, which is a significant improvement compared to the control SPSC. In TPR SPSCs, the density of grain boundaries was greatly reduced. The grain boundaries can serve as channels for water and oxygen to enter the MAPbI3 film. Moreover, unstable ions such as MA+ and I− can be easily released at the grain boundaries and then react with electron transport materials or electrodes.46 Thus, the decrease of grain boundaries can explain the increase in the stability of TPR SPSCs.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we studied the structures and properties of ultra-thin MAPbI3 films and SPSCs prepared by the TPR method. The average grain size in the ultra-thin MAPbI3 film increased significantly after the TPR treatment, along with an impressive improvement in surface flatness, crystal quality and charge transport. Compared with the control device, the TPR SPSCs exhibited an all-round performance improvement, including Voc, Jsc, FF, PCE, transmittance and stability. In particular, the average PCE showed a significant increase of 32.8% via the TPR treatment for illumination through ITO. These results show that the TPR method can facilitate the development and commercial application of semitransparent perovskite solar cells.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials
All the materials were purchased commercially and used as received without further treatment. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, i.e. CH3NH3I, 99.5%); methylamine hydrochloride (MACl, i.e. CH3NH3Cl, 99.5%); lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%); and F4-TCNQ, C60 and BCP were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (China). PTAA (MW ≈ 60000) was purchased from Sigma. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.5%), and sec-butyl alcohol (99%) were purchased from Aladdin.
4.2. Preparation of the MAPbI3 precursor film
MAPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was formulated by dissolving a mixture of PbI2 (322.7 mg), MAI (189.21 mg) and MACl (15 mg) in a mixed solution prepared using DMF (0.9 mL) and DMSO (0.1 mL). MAPbI3 thin films on ITO/PTAA: F4-TCNQ were prepared by a one-step spin-coating method. The mixture solution was spin coated on the PTAA: F4-TCNQ layer at 4000 rpm and, after 7 s of delay time, the wet film was washed with 200 μL of sec-butyl alcohol.47 Then, the films were soaked with 50 μL of sec-butyl alcohol for 6 s, and subsequently dried by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min. The film preparation process was typically conducted in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere with a real-time humidity of ∼0.1 ppm.
4.3. Thermal-pressed recrystallizing treatment
Firstly, a hydrophobic silicon wafer was covered on top of the precursor film. After being tightly wrapped with a Teflon membrane, the packed film and silicon wafer were transferred into a hot-press autoclave full filled with simethicone, and the packed process was completed in a glove-box filled with high purity (99.999%) nitrogen gas. During the experimental process, the simethicone serves as the uniform transmission medium for both the heat and pressure. Afterwards, a pressure of 150 MPa was applied on the autoclave, and the temperature was increased to 100 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1. After being kept at 100 °C and 150 MPa for 6 h, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature at a rate of 0.067 °C min−1. Finally, the TPR film was prepared.
4.4. Device preparation
Prior to the device fabrication, the pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 30 min each. Next, the PTAA: F4-TCNQ precursor solution was prepared by mixing PTAA (5 mg mL−1) and F4-TCNQ (5 wt%) in chlorobenzene, and then spin-coated on the cleaned ITO, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. MAPbI3 was spin-coated on ITO/PTAA: F4-TCNQ. The films were then transferred to a thermal evaporator where C60 (40 nm) and BCP (8 nm) were sequentially deposited at a pressure of approximately 6 × 10−4 Torr vacuum pressure. Finally, the devices were completed by evaporating a 100 nm-thick silver film as the thick electrode or a 10 nm-thick gold film as the thin electrode under 6 × 10−4 Torr vacuum pressure (active area of 0.04 cm2). In addition, a 40 nm BCP film was deposited on the top of the whole device as an anti-reflection film.48
4.5. Characterization
The top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of MAPbI3 films were characterized by SEM (SU8010, Hitachi Ltd. Corp). The morphology of MAPbI3 films was characterized by a Dimension Icon atomic force microscope. The transmittance of MAPbI3 films was recorded on a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The steady-state PL spectra were recorded using a spectrometer (DU420A-OE, ANDOR, excited at 400 nm). The excitation laser beam was generated using a frequency-doubled femtosecond Ti-sapphire laser (Maitai HP, Spectra-physics) at 80 MHz. The time-resolved PL spectra were recorded using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments). J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A sun simulator (ABET SUN 2000) was used to provide simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The output of the light source was adjusted using a calibrated silicon photodiode (ABET technology). The EQE was measured using a QE-R system (Enli tech). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the PSCs were obtained in the dark by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D).
