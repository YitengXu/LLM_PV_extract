The essence of this strategy lies in the introduction of benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups that function to protect the ether bond (through the conjugation effect of the benzene ring) and restrict swelling behaviour of the membrane (resulting from the –CF3 hydrophobic groups). With the introduction of benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups, the SFPEEK membranes exhibited excellent ion selectivity and cell performance under vanadium flow battery (VFB) operation conditions, exhibiting a columbic efficiency of 98.32% and an energy efficiency of 87.74% at a current density of 80 mA cm−2, which is much higher than commercial Nafion 115 (CE = 94.83%, EE = 83.25%). A VFB single cell assembled with a SFPEEK membrane shows a stable performance after continuously running more than 1050 cycles, which is by far the longest cycle life reported on sulfonated aromatic cation exchange membranes. These results demonstrated that the sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) ion exchange membranes with benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups are promising candidates for VFB systems.
Introduction
Pressing environmental concerns as well as the fossil fuel shortage have led to the urgent need for large energy storage systems that can be combined with renewable sources like solar and wind power.1–3 Among the energy storage systems, the vanadium flow battery (VFB) is one of the most suitable candidates, because of its attractive features such as independence from power and energy ratings, perfect combination of high energy efficiency, high safety and reliability.4,5 In a VFB single cell, energy-bearing liquid electrolytes, separated by an ion exchange membrane (IEM), are stored externally, while the redox reactions occur in the electrode compartments to reversibly realize the conversion between electricity energy and chemical energy.6 Good ion conductivity, high ion selectivity and good chemical stability are the essential properties that need to be tailored to develop an ideal IEM. The role of an IEM is to separate the positive and negative electrolyte and complete the current circuit by transferring ions.7,8 Currently, perfluorinated membranes and non-perfluorinated membranes are the most studied membranes in VFBs. However, some major issues have hindered the commercialization of these membranes.9 Perfluorinated membranes (Dupont's Nafion) usually show excellent chemical stability and high conductivity, however the poor ion selectivity together with the extremely high cost hampered their application in VFBs. Non-perfluorinated membranes (cation and anion exchanged aromatic polymers such as sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), S-Radel, chloromethylated/quaternized poly(phthalazinone ether ketone), quaternarized poly(tetramethydiphenyl ether sulfone) (QAPES) etc.) have the advantages of high ion selectivity and low cost.10–13 However, the poor chemical stability has limited their further application.
Although some work has been already carried out to clarify the degradation mechanism of ion exchange membranes, a fundamental understanding of poor chemical stability under vanadium flow battery medium is still very limited owing to the complicated medium of VFBs (strongly acidic, oxidizing and high electric potential).5,14,15 There is no doubt that clarifying the reason behind the poor chemical stability of non-perfluorinated membranes is very important.16 In light of our recent work, the degradation of a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane in vanadium flow battery medium was clarified and it was shown that the protonated ether functionality together with the strong electron-withdrawing sulfonic acid group induces a strong electrophilic carbon centre on the benzene ring, which leads to further attacking by the lone pair of electrons on the vanadium(V) oxygen species.15 Accordingly, it is desirable to improve the chemical stability of the membrane through introducing electron-donating groups to the aromatic backbone, which will reduce the reactivity of the electrophilic carbon centre on the benzene ring and further improve the stability.
In another way, swelling of the membranes is one of the quite critical issues for membrane stability, due to the fact that high water uptake and swelling would lower their chemical stability by promoting the absorption of VO2+ and further accelerate the membrane degradation. More importantly, high water uptake and swelling could affect the ion selectivity of the membranes and further lower the battery performance.17–19 Therefore, we can improve the chemical stability and lifetime of the membranes by suppressing their water uptake and swelling.20–22 Some efforts such as cross linking, porous PTFE reinforcement or improving the hydrophobic properties of the membrane have already been dedicated to suppress membrane swelling and further improve the chemical stability of the membrane.23–27 In view of the above discussion, advances in materials design such as introducing electron-donating groups (protecting the ether bond in polymer chains via the conjugation effect) into the SPEEK polymer backbone or restricting water uptake and swelling behaviour of the membrane are expected to improve the chemical stability of the ion exchange membrane.
The work herein presents a facile strategy for enhancing the chemical stability of SPEEK by introducing benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups into SPEEK polymer chains (SFPEEK) (Scheme 1), where the benzotrifluoride electron-donating groups could effectively protect the ether bond via the conjugation effect, while –CF3 hydrophobic groups could restrict swelling behaviour of the membrane. Compared with the traditional SPEEK membrane, the VFB single battery assembled with the SFPEEK membrane demonstrates a stable performance over more than 1050 cycles, which is by far the longest cycle life reported on sulfonated aromatic cation exchange membranes. An ex situ test also indicates a much higher chemical stability than does traditional SPEEK.

Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis and membrane characterization
SFPEEK was prepared according to the sulfonation of FPEEK by using concentrated sulfuric acid as a sulfonation reagent (Scheme 2). The degree of sulfonation was controlled by changing the reaction time (2 h, 5 h and 11 h respectively). The resulting polymers are referred to as SFPEEK-2, SFPEEK-5 and SFPEEK-11, respectively. As an electrophilic substitution reaction, the reaction activity of benzotrifluoride is quite low due to the strong electron withdrawing inductive effect of –CF3 groups,28 in other words the sulfonate groups will not reside on the side chains of the polymer but in the main chains of the polymer. Fig. 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of SFPEEK-11 and SPEEK polymers. The characteristic resonance of ortho protons of the sulfonate groups in SFPEEK-11 emerged at 7.556 ppm, which is lower than that in SPEEK (7.586 ppm).15 The difference in the chemical shift of the ortho protons of the sulfonate groups can be attributed to the conjugation effect between the benzotrifluoride and polymer chain, which can increase the electron cloud density of the ortho protons of the sulfonate groups, further leading to proton resonance in high field.29 With the reaction time increasing from 2 h to 11 h, the DS of SFPEEK increases from 0.360 to 0.909. For comparison, the DS of SPEEK without benzotrifluoride groups was kept at 0.907.

The chemical structure of SFPEEK-11 was further confirmed by FTIR spectra as shown in Fig. 2. The characteristic peaks at 1030 cm−1 and 1091 cm−1 are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the sulfonic acid groups (OSO).30 The asymmetric stretching vibration peak of the aryl ether bond usually appeared at 1252 cm−1 for SPEEK, while the asymmetric stretching vibration peak of the aryl ether bond was found at 1279 cm−1 for SFPEEK-11, demonstrating again the conjugation effect between benzotrifluoride and polymer chains. The presence of absorption bands at 1715 cm−1 and 855 cm−1, corresponding to 1,3,4,6-substituted phenyl, confirmed that the sulfonic acid groups were introduced on the main chains of FPEEK successfully. In addition, SFPEEK-11 exhibited absorption bands in the range between 1230–1160 cm−1, which is ascribed to C–F stretching frequencies.30

The water contact angle experiment was utilized to investigate the effect of benzotrifluoride on the hydrophobicity of the SFPEEK-11 membrane. The contact angle of SFPEEK (77°) is much higher than SPEEK (65°) without benzotrifluoride, when DS is kept at the same level. The higher contact angle of SFPEEK is attributed to enhancement of membrane hydrophobicity brought about by the introduction of benzotrifluoride on the polymer chain, resulting in higher surface free energy.
TEM was performed on the SFPEEK-11 membrane to investigate the distribution of ion clusters. The membrane was firstly dyed with Ag+ to form metal clusters through the interaction between Ag+ and the sulfonic acid groups. The distribution of the AgHSO3 particles reflects the phase separation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions (Fig. 3). Compared with our reported SPEEK, SFPEEK showed more connected nanoparticles with smaller size.15 This can be attributed to the hydrophobic benzotrifluoride groups, which leads to the more clearly phase separated structures.31
 Fig. 3  SFPEEK-11 morphology of the hydrophilic domain recorded by TEM. 
To further identify the effect of hydrophobic benzotrifluoride groups on the membrane properties, water uptake and swelling of SFPEEKs with different DS and SPEEK were detected. As shown in Fig. 4, with increasing DS, a regular rise of water uptake and swelling can be observed from SFPEEK-2 to SFPEEK-11. This can be attributed to the hydrophilic water channels, resulting from the sulfonic acid groups, which leads to a regular rise of water uptake and swelling. However, the SFPEEK-11 (DS: 0.909) membrane exhibited much lower water uptake and swelling than the SPEEK membrane with similar or even lower DS (DS: 0.907), suggesting again that hydrophobicity of benzotrifluoride could effectively reduce the swelling behaviour of the SFPEEK-11 membrane. According to the literature, the higher the water uptake the more VO2+ could be absorbed into the membrane, leading to accelerated oxidation.32,33 Therefore, the lower swelling is expected to improve the chemical stability as well as ion selectively of SFPEEK membranes.

Fig. 5 shows the VO2+ permeability of SFPEEKs with different DS and Nafion 115 membranes. The VO2+ permeability of SFPEEK membranes slightly rises with increasing DS or swelling due to the fact that the hydrophilic –SO3H groups in the membrane generate hydrophilic channels for cations. All the SFPEEK membranes display a much lower VO2+ permeability than does a Nafion 115 due to the fact that flexible ionic side chains and the perfluorinated backbone of Nafion 115 could easily lead to continuous networks of ions transport channels.31 The area resistance of SFPEEK membranes is shown in Fig. 6. The area resistance of SFPEEK membranes decreases from 4.75 Ω cm2 to 0.40 Ω cm2 with the DS increasing from 0.360 to 0.909, due to the higher content of ion exchange groups.

Battery performance
The low swelling and low area resistance of SFPEEK membranes thus combine excellent ion selectivity and proton conductivity, which is expected to achieve an outstanding VFB performance. Fig. 7a shows the performance of the VFB single cell assembled with SFPEEKs and Nafion 115. It is to be noted that the VFB single cell assembled with SFPEEK-2 could not be charged due to its very high area resistance as evidenced in Fig. 6. The VFB single cell assembled with SFPEEK-11 exhibits a much higher voltage efficiency (VE = 88.84%) and energy efficiency (EE = 87.34%) than does a SFPEEK-5 (VE = 80.02%, EE = 79.63%) at similar columbic efficiency (CE (SFPEEK-11) = 98.32%, CE (SFPEEK-5) = 99.51%). As the sulfonation reaction times increase, DS increases or the content of hydrophilic sulfonated acid groups increases, VE dramatically increases from 80.02% to 88.84%, whereas CE decreases to a slight extent. According to a previous report,27 the chemical stability and ion selectivity of PTFE reinforced SPEEK composite membranes can be significantly improved due to their low swelling behaviour, resulting from the reinforcement of PTFE.27 In a similar vein, the hydrophobicity of benzotrifluoride could effectively restrict the swelling of SFPEEKs (Fig. 4), which in turn results in high ion selectivity even at a high DS (0.909). In addition, compared with Nafion 115 (CE = 94.83%, EE = 83.25%), SFPEEK-11 exhibits much higher CE and EE due to its higher ion selectivity and proton conductivity. Charge and discharge curves are determined by the overpotential of the cell and the reduction potential of the redox couples in each half cell. The ohmic overpotential is closely related to the area resistance of the membrane.34 Thus, higher area resistance will lead to lower discharge voltage and higher charge voltage as shown in Fig. 7b.

In situ VFB cycle test and ex situ oxidation stability test
The long-term stability of ion exchange membranes under strong oxidants VO2+ and sulfuric acid conditions is one of the major issues for most aromatic polymer materials. A cycle life test was carried out on SFPEEK-11 to investigate the chemical stability of the prepared membrane. As shown in Fig. 8, no obvious efficiency decline can be observed after running for more than 1050 cycles, demonstrating much higher chemical stability than does a SPEEK membrane.15 Moreover, this cycle life is by far the longest reported on the sulfonated aromatic cation exchange membranes for VFB application. The result demonstrated that the chemical stability of the SFPEEK-11 membrane significantly improved due to the fact that the benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups combine the effect of conjugation resulting from the benzene ring and low swelling resulting from –CF3 hydrophobic groups, which significantly improved the chemical stability of the SFPEEK-11 membrane.

An ex situ test was carried out on SFPEEK-11 and SPEEK membranes via immersing the membranes in VO2+ solutions to further investigate the stability of SFPEEK-11 and SPEEK membranes. Compared with SPEEK, the colour of the solution containing the SPEEK membrane with similar DS (after immersion in 0.15 M VO2+ + 3 M total sulfate for 30 days at 40 °C) is much greener than that of the solution containing the SFPEEK-11 membrane (after immersion in 0.15 M VO2+ + 3 M total sulfate for 33 days at 40 °C), suggesting again that the chemical stability of the SFPEEK-11 membrane was significantly improved (Fig. 9), which is well in agreement with the cycle life test.

Capacity retention
The loss of capacity over cycling is a technical obstacle haunting VFB technology. Continuous capacity decay initiated undesired side reaction in the electrolyte, lowering the voltage and reducing the system capacity, further leading to frequent maintenance of the electrolyte and increasing the operation cost of the VFB system.35,36 Therefore, the high capacity retention under VFB operating medium is of paramount importance for practical use. Fig. 10 shows the charge and discharge curves of the SFPEEK-11 membrane during the cycle life test, demonstrating no remarkable capacity fading after the battery continuously running for 20, 80, 150 cycles. In addition, Fig. 11 clearly shows that the SFPEEK-11 membrane exhibits excellent capacity retention, due to its low cross mixing rate of vanadium ions. Compared with Nafion 115, SFPEEK-11 shows much better capacity retention due to its much higher ion selectivity.

Conclusions
In conclusion, SFPEEK membranes combining excellent chemical stability and high battery performance were designed and prepared for VFB application. The excellent chemical stability, as evidenced via in situ and ex situ tests, is attributed to benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups that function to protect the ether bond and restrict the swelling behaviour of the membrane, while the high battery performance is mainly attributed to the high ion exchange groups (DS: 0.909) and the low swelling of the membrane, resulting from the hydrophobic properties of –CF3. Specifically, the single cell assembled with the SFPEEK-11 membrane exhibited much better performance (CE: 98.32%; EE: 87.34%) than that of the commercialized Nafion 115 membrane (CE: 94.83%; EE: 83.25%). This work demonstrates that the introduction of the benzotrifluoride bifunctional groups into polymer backbones provides a strategy toward the design and fabrication of high performance and stable IEMs.
Experimental
Materials
Fluorinated poly(ether ether ketone) (FPEEK) was kindly provided by Jilin University. 1.5 M VO2+ in 3 M total sulfate solution was prepared by the electron-oxidation method and 0.15 M VO2+ in 3 M total sulfate solution was prepared by diluting 1.5 M VO2+ with sulfuric acid according to the literature.37 All other chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Polymer synthesis and membrane preparation
The sulfonated fluorinated poly (ether ether ketone)s (SFPEEKs) with different degrees of sulfonation (DS) were obtained by direct sulfonation with sulfuric acid at 70 °C for different reaction times (2 h, 5 h and 11 h respectively). The resulting polymers are referred to as SFPEEK-2, SFPEEK-5 and SFPEEK-11, respectively. The detailed reaction and structure of SFPEEKs are shown in Scheme 2. The SFPEEK membranes were cast from 25 wt% N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solutions and dried. Afterwards, the membranes were peeled off and the thickness of the membranes was controlled in the range of 100 ± 5 μm.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
To determine the chemical structure of the SFPEEK polymer, 1H NMR was recorded on a BRUKER DRX400 by using DMSO-d6 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) (Avatar.370 E.S.P., Nicolet Continuum Infrared Microscope) were recorded at an average rate of 48 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 collected from 400 to 4000 cm−1 in transmission mode. The SFPEEK membrane samples were first dissolved in DMAc to form a 4 wt% solution and then cast onto a potassium bromide (KBr) crystal. The KBr crystal was then dried at 60 °C under ambient pressure for 24 h, followed by drying under vacuum for 24 h at 80 °C.
Water uptake and swelling
Water uptake and swelling of all membranes were calculated by using the following equations:  where Ww and Wd are the weights of wet and dry membranes, respectively.  where Lw and Ld are the lengths of wet and dry membranes, respectively.
Contact angle
The hydrophilicity of the membrane was characterized by the water contact angle, measured by a sessile drop method (JC2001A, POWER-EACH®, China). The image was frozen as soon as 10 μL deionized water was dropped onto the membrane surface.
TEM
The morphologies of the hydrophilic domains of the SFPEEK membrane were recorded by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2000EX, JEOL). The SFPEEK membrane was firstly converted to the Ag+ form by immersion in silver nitrate solution (0.5 M) for 7 d and then fixed in epoxy, before cutting into thin slice samples.
Area resistance
The area resistance of SFPEEK membranes was measured by the method described in our previous article.38 A conductivity cell, where the effective area (S) was 1 cm2, was separated into two compartments by a membrane, and each cell was filled with 0.5 M H2SO4. R1 and R2, which represent the electric resistance of the cell with and without a membrane respectively, were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over a frequency range from 1000 Hz to 1 MHz. The area resistance R was calculated by the following equation:R = (R1−R2)×S
Vanadium permeability
The permeability of vanadium ions through the membrane was determined according to our previous report, with a diffusion cell separated by a membrane.39 The left cell was filled with 1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (80 mL) while the right one was filled with 1.5 M MgSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (80 mL) to equalize the ionic strengths and minimize the osmotic pressure effects. Solutions in both half cells were vigorously stirred to avoid the concentration polarization. The effective area of the membrane was 9 cm2. Samples of a 3 mL solution from the right cell were collected at a regular time interval. Then another 3 mL fresh MgSO4 solution was added to the right cell to keep the solution volume stable. The vanadium concentration of the samples was detected with a UV-Vis spectrometer. The vanadium permeability was calculated according to the Ficker diffusion law as follows:  where VB is the solution volume in the right reservoir, CB is the VO2+ concentration in the left cell as a function of time t, A and L are the effective area and thickness of the membrane, respectively, p is the permeability of VO2+, and CA is the VO2+ concentration in the left cell.
VFB single cell performance
The VFB single cell was assembled by sandwiching a SFPEEK-11 membrane with two carbon felt electrodes, clamped by two graphite polar plates.40 All these components were fixed between two stainless plates. The effective area of the membrane was 6 × 8 cm2. 60 mL 1.5 M VO2+/VO2+ in 3.0 M H2SO4 and 60 mL 1.5 M V2+/V3+ in 3.0 M H2SO4 were used as positive and negative electrolytes respectively. The electrolyte was cyclically pumped through the corresponding electrodes in airtight pipelines. Charge–discharge cycling tests were conducted by using ArbinBT 2000 at a constant current density of 80 mA cm−2. The cut-off voltage for discharge and charge was set at 1.0 V and 1.55 V respectively to avoid the corrosion of carbon felts and graphite polar plates.

Ex situ oxidation stability test and in situ VFB cycle test
To investigate the chemical stability of SFPEEK membranes, an ex situ test was carried out by immersing a membrane sample (4 cm × 4 cm) in a 60 mL electrolyte solution (0.15 M VO2+ + 3 M H2SO4) at 40 °C. The VO2+ concentration in the test solution, detected by using a UV-Vis spectrometer, was recorded as an indicator of membrane oxidation degradation. For comparison, SPEEK was selected for the test as well. An in situ VFB cycle life test was carried out on the SFPEEK-11 membrane as well.
