    , Accepted 23rd October 2017First published on 23rd October 2017AbstractThe method of preparing perovskite films in ambient air is of great importance to commercializing high-performance planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an efficient and stable inverted planar PSC has been prepared via a simple solution method in ambient air. A suitable vanadium oxide (V2Ox) aqueous solution is mixed with a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution, resulting in an improvement in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film. Perovskite films with large crystal sizes could be obtained using V2Ox additives. The improvement in the performance of perovskite films is conducive to the separation and transmission of charge carriers. For PSCs, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.14% was obtained by controlling the proportion of V2Ox additives in ambient air. It is via a physical mechanism that V2Ox particles are dispersed in the perovskite crystal boundary, and the heterogeneous structure between CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and V2Ox is formed. In addition, the slow migration of iodide ions and stability of the perovskite films are also achieved. What merits more attention is that the PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) still maintain a high PCE after being stored for 1000 h, more than 70% of the initial one.
1. Introduction
It has been found that organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have excellent semiconductor physical properties. For example, CH3NH3PbI3, with a forbidden band width of 1.55 eV and good absorption in the full range of visible light, was the first material widely used to prepare PSCs.1,2 The exciton binding energy of CH3NH3PbI3 is less than 50 meV, indicating that the exciton of the material can be easily converted to free carriers at room temperature.3–5 In addition, the mobilities of the electrons and holes of CH3NH3PbI3 are 24 ± 7 cm2 V−1 S−1 and 105 ± 35 cm2 V−1 S−1 respectively, and the diffusion length of the charge carriers reaches 100–1000 nm.6,7 Another hybrid perovskite material is CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, for which the diffusion length of electrons and holes reaches 1 μm.8 High-efficiency PSCs have been prepared using this hybrid perovskite material.9,10 Since 2009, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, as light-absorbing materials, have been used to prepare solar cells.11 An alarmingly rapid increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSC) has aroused widespread interest.12–16 An efficiency of 22.1% for a PSC device was achieved in 2016,17 which was considered to be one of the most efficient devices. The efficiency and stability are the main performance parameters for PSC devices, however, some devices with good stability do not exhibit a high efficiency.18–20 We still have a long way to go to prepare high-efficiency PSC devices via simple preparation methods. For example, some researchers embark on the fabrication of PSCs in ambient air.21,22
The crystal structure of a perovskite material is particularly susceptible to other factors, such as water, oxygen, ultraviolet light, temperature and external conditions.23,24 The impact of ambient air on perovskite materials and devices has been one of the focuses of studies. What’s more, some reports suggest that water also plays an important role in improving the performance of PSCs.25,26 Methods of producing high-performance devices in air are critical to the commercialization of PSCs. In addition, it has been amply demonstrated that the grain size of a perovskite film is more important than its crystallinity in determining the performance of inverted planar PSCs.27 Large perovskite grains have been obtained by using some additives, which is one of the most common methods of improving the optoelectronic properties of PSC devices.
It is widely believed that water additives can increase the crystallinity of perovskite films and improve the photoelectric performance of PSC devices. On this basis, a V2Ox aqueous solution, treated using hydrogen peroxide, is added to a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor.28,29 The vanadium(IV) oxide has a high capacity and excellent cyclability.30 Although V2Ox additives, as the interface modification layer, are a good hole extraction material, they have not been used to improve the quality of perovskite films with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox. Here, we have introduced a method by which efficient and stable PSCs are prepared by adding V2Ox additives in ambient air. By controlling the ratio of V2Ox additives, high-quality and large-size perovskite grains can be easily obtained, effectively improving the photoelectric properties of the PSC devices. As a result, the PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) show an enhanced PCE of 16.14%, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 21.62 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.1%. In comparison, the PCE of a device with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) is only 14.02% under the same preparation conditions, with a VOC of 0.95 V, a JSC of 20.17 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.2%. What’s more, the long-term stability of the devices with V2Ox additives has also been effectively improved. Under the storage conditions of 1 sun light illumination and 35–40% humidity, the PCE of the devices is maintained within a certain range (more than 70% of the initial value) in ambient air after 1000 h.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and preparation
V2O5 powder, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl), hydrogen iodide (HI) and methylamine (CH3NH2) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Industry Co. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxy-thiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was bought from Heraeus (Germany). PbCl2 (99.999%) and DMF (anhydrous, amine free; 99.9%) were purchased from Alfa-Aesar. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen) were produced in Nichem Fine Technology Co., Ltd. (Taiwan). CH3NH3I was synthesized from CH3NH2 and HI, according to the reported procedure.31 PCBM solutions were manufactured by dissolving PCBM powder in chlorobenzene and stirring the mixture for 12 h in ambient air, with an optimized concentration of 20 mg mL−1. Bphen solutions were prepared by dissolving Bphen powder in ethanol and stirring the admixture for 12 h under an ambient atmosphere, with an optimized concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1.
2.2 Fabrication of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution
V2Ox aqueous solutions with different concentrations were prepared according to previously reported methods.28 First, V2O5 aqueous solutions were manufactured by dissolving V2O5 powder in deionized water, with varying proportions (0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 wt%) and stirring the mixture at room temperature for 30 min. Then, an H2O2 aqueous solution (30%) was added to the V2O5 aqueous solution, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min and left to stand for 10 h or more. Thus, V2Ox aqueous solutions with different mass fractions were prepared. Mixed DMF solvents (the volume ratio of DMF to V2Ox aqueous solution was 1000:15) were prepared by adding different V2Ox aqueous solutions into anhydrous DMF. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solutions were fabricated by solubilizing CH3NH3I and PbCl2 in aqueous DMF solvent in a molar ratio of 3:1,32,33 and agitating the compound at 60 °C for 12 h in ambient air. The solutions were filtered with a 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter before device fabrication.
2.3 Fabrication of the device
13 × 15 mm ITO-coated glass (Fine Chemicals Industry Co., Gyeonggi-do, Korea, 10 Ω sq−1) was etched according to methods previously reported.34 Then the ITO coated glass was cleaned in deionized water, ethanol and acetone using ultrasound for 15 min or more, each. After being washed, the substrate was treated with UV-ozone cleaner for 10 min. A PEDOT:PSS HTL film was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate at 3500 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min. In an atmospheric environment, a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution with and without water was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 40 s. Unlike the typical gradient increased temperature method,35–37 perovskite layer films were dried at 105 °C for 40 min. Then, a PCBM solution was deposited by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 40 s onto the perovskite layer film and dried at 60 °C for 10 min. Afterward, a Bphen solution was deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 40 s and dried at 60 °C for 10 min. Finally, the substrates were transferred to a vacuum chamber for silver electrode evaporation. A silver film was thermally deposited onto the Bphen layer film under vacuum at 4.5 × 10−4 Pa through a shadow mask, defining the single device area as 6.25 mm2.
2.4 Characterization
The surface morphology of the perovskite films and section morphology of the PSCs were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Quanta 200 FEG, FEI Co.). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was conducted using an EDS device connected to a FESEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the V2O5 particles, V2Ox particles and perovskite crystals were measured using an FEI Talos (S) TEM at 200 kV. The time-resolved (PL) spectra were measured by using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation at 470 nm. The crystalline phase and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite and V2Ox films were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-2400 diffractometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured (2400 Series Source Meter, Keithley Instruments) under simulated Air-Mass (AM) 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a system combining a xenon lamp, monochromator, chopper and lock-in amplifier together with a calibrated silicon photodetector. UV-Vis absorption measurements of the perovskite films were carried out using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an AXIS Ultra instrument (Kratos UK) at a base pressure of ∼10−8 torr and 295 K.
3. Results and discussion
Previous reports have confirmed that a suitable amount of water can improve the crystal quality of perovskite films in a glove box or air environment. Dense and uniform perovskite films could be obtained by adding a suitable amount of H2O in ambient air.25,38 In order to eliminate the interference of water, we dope the same amount of water into the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x precursor solution, and regard the device with 1.5% H2O as a reference device. As shown in Fig. 1, PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox composite films were prepared by adding V2Ox additives in an ambient environment with ∼40% relative humidity. On the basis of conventional inverted PSCs, we added a V2Ox aqueous solution to the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution, fabricating efficient and stable PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (300 nm)/PCBM (40 nm)/Bphen (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The cross-sectional FESEM image of the PSC prepared in ambient air (∼40% relative humidity) is shown in Fig. S1.†

3.1 Photovoltaic performance of devices
V2Ox aqueous solutions with different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 wt%) were added to CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solutions in our study (Fig. S2†). Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 wt%) active layer-based PSCs prepared in ambient air under AM 1.5 G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The main performance parameters of PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) films are shown in Table 1, including the VOC, JSC, FF, PCE, series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). The reference device based on the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x (0 wt%) film has a VOC of 0.95 V, JSC of 20.17 mA cm−2, FF of 73.2% and PCE of 14.02%. In contrast, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox composite-based devices exhibit obvious improvements in their VOC and JSC. The best performance was achieved in PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) films, with a PCE of 16.14%, JSC of 21.62 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.98 V, and FF of 75.1%. To further confirm the enhancement in JSC for the PSCs with V2Ox additives, the IPCE spectra of PSCs with different CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox compositions were measured (Fig. 2b). The IPCE intensities of PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox are higher than that of the PSC without V2Ox. The JSC of 21.53 mA cm−2 is calculated via the IPCE intensity of the PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%), which is nearly equal to the JSC of 21.62 mA cm−2 from the J–V curve. Furthermore, it can be found that the IPCE intensities of the PSCs decrease in the range 350–450 nm with an increase of V2Ox additives. The IPCE intensity is positively related to the absorption intensity, and the UV-Vis absorption intensity of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox films decreases in the range 340–450 nm with an increase of V2Ox additives (Fig. S3†). However, an obvious absorption enhancement is observed in most of the visible-light region of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox film, which results in an increase in the current density of the PSCs with the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox film.

The mean and standard deviations of the PCE, VOC, JSC, FF, Rs and Rsh of PSC devices with different CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox compositions are shown in Fig. S4a–f.† With 2.5 wt% of V2Ox additives, the Rs of the PSC has fallen by more than two-thirds (Fig. S4e†) and its Rsh has more than tripled (Fig. S4f†), which is conducive to improving the FF39,40 (Fig. S4d†). What’s more, the Rsh of PSC devices increases gradually with the concentration of V2Ox additives. When more than 2.5 wt% of V2Ox additives are added, an abrupt decrease in the Rs and increase in Rsh can be seen, suggesting that the underlying resistance components are removed by adding V2Ox additives, or more probably by charge separation at the interface between the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox film and transport layers.40 The Rsh increases continuously with the concentration of V2Ox additives, which is closely related to the resistivity of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox film (Fig. S5†). Electron transport is suppressed in a heavily doped p-type material and the hole concentration is increased. The improvement in the charge carrier mobility is usually accompanied by a reduction in the conductivity of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox film, indicating that the decrease of electron concentration might be consistent with the Hall effect.41
In order to evaluate the charge carrier loss and the recombination of free carriers,42 the dark J–V curves (Fig. 3a) of devices with different CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox films were recorded in dark conditions. As expected, the perovskite film with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) improved the current injection and simultaneously prevented the leakage current at very low voltages, which is partly due to the dense perovskite film with V2Ox additives. In addition, the current transitioned to a steep increase above approximately 0.4 V. The steep increment in the current results from a diffusion-dominated current,43 and in this region, the current can typically be described by the Shockley diode equation: (1)where J0, n, k and T denote the saturation current density, ideality factor, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. n is a measure of the slope of the J–V curves on a semi-logarithmic plot, as demonstrated in eqn (2): (2)
 Fig. 3  (a) The dark J–V curves of the PSCs with different concentrations of V2Ox additives (0 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1.5 wt%, 2.5 wt%, 3.5 wt% and 4.5 wt%). (b) The n–V curves of the PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%). 
The corresponding n–V curves of devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) were calculated and are shown in Fig. 3b. Ideally, n equals unity under conditions without nonradiative recombination. The value of n could be increased to 2 in the case of trap-assisted recombination.44 Due to the establishment of a drift current, limited by either the formation of space charge or charge injection, the value of n increases with the applied bias. The larger value of n indicates that trap-assisted recombination plays a crucial role in the recombination process.45 The reported bulk trap density of solution-processed perovskite films is 5 × 1016 cm−3,46 which could induce a dominant trap-assisted recombination mechanism.47 This holds true especially in PSCs with a low bimolecular recombination rate.46,47 The slope of the J–V curves augments after we added 2.5 wt% of V2Ox to the perovskite films, therefore n reduces, which indicates a reduction in trap-assisted recombination.48
Compared to devices without V2Ox additives, in our study, the devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x (2.5 wt%) show a weak hysteresis (Fig. S6a and b†). The hysteresis behavior of all the 55 cells with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x (2.5 wt%) are displayed in Fig. S6c.† The hysteresis was significantly reduced in the devices, because the large perovskite grains increased the area of contact between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer.49 In addition, the reproducibility of the devices plays an important role in the commercialization of PSCs. As shown in the histograms in Fig. S7,†the PCE parameters of 72 PSC devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) have been studied. Obviously, the performance of the device follows a Gaussian distribution. The relative standard deviation of devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) is lower, indicating that the reproducibility of the devices with V2Ox (2.5 wt%) is better than that of the devices without V2Ox (inset).
3.2 The role of V2Ox additives
The CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox composite films with different concentrations of V2Ox display different surface morphologies. Fig. 4a–f shows the surface FESEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films with different concentrations of V2Ox solutions annealed in ambient air. As we know, the long-strip perovskite films (0 wt% V2Ox) (Fig. 4a) are easily formed in an air atmosphere. The long strip of perovskite crystals are closely connected to each other and form an interlaced network structure, resulting in more holes in the perovskite film. When 0.5 wt% V2Ox solution is added to the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution, interestingly and remarkably, a large grain with a size of 300–600 nm is found in some areas of the perovskite films. Furthermore, with the increase of V2Ox concentration, the grains become larger. When 4.5 wt% V2Ox solution is added to the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution, a large grain with a size of 2–4 μm is displayed in the perovskite films (Fig. 4f). This suggests that V2Ox additives can contribute to obtaining large-sized perovskite grains and play a crucial role in the crystal growth. Perovskite films with large crystal sizes can be obtained by controlling the nucleation sites and crystal growth processes.50 The perovskites with larger grains could reduce the trap charge density due to having smaller total grain boundary areas.51 However, the gap between the grains gets larger with an increase in the size of the grain, which might result in shorted cells.27 The dense perovskite film can effectively suppress the diffusion of oxygen and moisture, which contributes to improving the stability of perovskite films in ambient conditions.52 Therefore, large grains and dense films have their own advantages, and the performances of the devices with large grains and dense films are the best.
 Fig. 4  The FESEM images of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films with (a) 0 wt% V2Ox, (b) 0.5 wt% V2Ox, (c) 1.5 wt% V2Ox, (d) 2.5 wt% V2Ox, (e) 3.5 wt% V2Ox, (f) 4.5 wt% V2Ox. 
There is no doubt that V2Ox additives promote the growth of perovskite crystals. Because some V2Ox exists in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt% V2Ox) precursor solution and forms a V2Ox·nH2O hydrate, hydrogen bonds may be present somewhere between the lattice CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and V2Ox·nH2O.22,53 The hydrogen bonds might be a factor that make the perovskite grains larger, and certainly there are other possible factors. The V2Ox additives might be similar to water additives, and dangling bonds result in the presence of larger perovskite grains.53 In addition, the grain growth of the perovskite film with V2Ox additives involves a fast heterogeneous nucleation process and an anomalous grain growth mechanism,54 which may be similar to the grain growth of perovskite films with TiO2 embedded in the structure.55 At the nucleation stage, V2Ox particles dispersed in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution provide many heterogeneous nucleation sites, which is conducive to the nucleation of perovskite. Many nucleation sites provided by V2Ox particles would make the perovskite generate many reentrant edges, which could promote the grain growth. In the annealing process of the perovskite film with V2Ox additives, the boundaries of the grains will be migrated, and some small grains will grow and infiltrate into other grains,56 making the grain larger. In short, the reason why V2Ox additives can make perovskite grains larger remains to be further studied.
In order to analyze the effect of V2Ox additives on the crystallization of perovskite films, XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 wt%) films on the substrates were measured. As shown in the Table 2 and Fig. S8,† two strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.14°, 28.48° are observed in the perovskite films, corresponding to the (110) and (220) planes, respectively.31,57 With different proportions of V2Ox additives, no new diffraction peaks are observed in the spectra, and the positions of the two diffraction peaks are hardly changed, suggesting that the crystal structure is well-preserved. With an increase in the proportion of V2Ox additives, an enhancement in the diffraction intensity and a reduction in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks can be clearly observed, which indicates that the crystallinity and the grain size have increased after the V2Ox additives were added. In addition, the XPS spectrum of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox films indicates that V2Ox has been incorporated into the perovskite materials (Fig. S9a and b†). The intensities of the V 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 lines monotonically increase with the concentration of V2Ox, which further confirms that the V2Ox exists in the perovskite films and the content of the V element augments with the concentration of V2Ox in the films. Essentially, no significant changes have been detected in the BE positions of the spectrum peaks, corresponding to perovskite films with different V2Ox additives. In addition, we find it difficult to introduce V2Ox into the perovskite crystal structure at 105 °C during the growth of the perovskite crystal. Therefore, it is believed that V2Ox is involved in the growth of perovskite films, but does not alter the lattice structure of perovskite crystals.

EDS analysis is an effective method of studying the distribution of various elements in the films. In order to explore the reason why V2Ox can promote the crystallization of perovskites, surface FESEM images, with EDS spectra and elemental mappings, were recorded for the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt% V2Ox) and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (0 wt% V2Ox) films (Fig. 5a–m). In the EDS spectra of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt% V2Ox) film (Fig. 5b), an additional signal of V can be observed, besides common elements (possibly from ITO or glass) including Sn, In, Na, Mg, Ca and Si and O elements, possibly from ITO, glass and V2Ox. In order to analyze the distribution of elements in the perovskite crystal, the boundaries of the perovskite crystals are marked in green lines (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, unlike other elements (Fig. 5c–f and j–m), more V is distributed at the edges of the perovskite grains in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt% V2Ox) film (Fig. 5g). Furthermore, EDS line scan spectra also show that more V exists in the grain boundaries of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt% V2Ox) film (Fig. S10a and b†). The morphology and structure of vanadium oxide undergoes great change when V2O5 is converted to V2Ox (Fig. 6a and b). After being treated with H2O2, the V2Ox particles become smaller and more uniform, which is beneficial to the combination of V2Ox and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x. What’s more, we find it clear that the treated vanadium oxide is in the amorphous state in the perovskite film (Fig. S11†), because no new diffraction peaks are found for the ITO/V2Ox films. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, we obtained the average value of the interplanar spacing (0.62 nm) by measuring the distances between three atomic layers (n = 3) in the perovskite crystal, this spacing is consistent with the results calculated from the XRD pattern of the perovskite films (Fig. S8†and Table 2). It is worth noting that the V2Ox particles with a size of about 10 nm are adsorbed on the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x crystal, which is in accordance with the EDS elemental analysis. Therefore, it is believed that perovskite with V2Ox may be a heterogeneous structure. In order to further understand the role of V2Ox in perovskite films, the time-resolved PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) films were obtained. As shown in Fig. S12,†the time-resolved PL spectra show that the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) film gives a reduced PL lifetime of about 35.7 ns, compared with that of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) film (54.2 ns). Remarkably, a high quenching efficiency was achieved in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) film. The reason is that V2Ox has a lower energy level than CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x in the heterogeneous structure formed by CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and V2Ox, and photogenerated holes are transferred from the valence band of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x to the highest occupied molecular orbital of the V2Ox.
 Fig. 5  The surface FESEM images together with the EDS spectra and elemental mappings were recorded for (a–g) the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) film and (h–m) the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) film.

The average value of the interplanar spacing distance was obtained by measuring the distances between three atomic layers (n = 3). 
3.3 Stability of devices
One of the biggest challenges faced by researchers is to maintain the stability of PSC devices during the period from experiment to application.58 The highest-efficiency-inverted PSC devices usually show poor stability.59 To analyze the effect of V2Ox additives on the stability of devices, degradation tests on the unencapsulated PSCs, that were stored for 360 h under 1 sun light illumination, were conducted. The identical and stable atmospheric conditions (temperatures in the range 25–30 °C, and humidity in the range 35–40%) were controlled. The stabilities of the normalized VOC, JSC, FF and PCE values, as a function of time, are shown in Fig. 7a–d. Obviously, the stability of the device with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) is better than that of the device with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%). Within the first 120 h, interestingly, it can be seen that the PCE of the device with CH3NH3PbIxCl3x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) is slightly increased, mainly due to the increase in JSC, which is associated with the light soaking effect in PSCs.60,61 Subsequently, the PCE gradually decays over time, which has something to do with the sharp reductions in JSC and FF. The decomposition of the perovskite film results from the corrosion caused by water and oxygen in the air, which results in a reduction in the performance of devices. In order to further test the long-term stability of PSC devices, unencapsulated PSCs with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) were stored for 1000 h under an ambient atmosphere (Fig. S13†). The devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) still maintained an average PCE of 11.03% after 1000 h of degradation, more than 70% of the initial value. However, the average PCE of the devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) only maintained about 20% of its initial value. The stability of devices with V2Ox additives may be significantly affected by the grain size of perovskite. The devices with larger grains and dense perovskite films have shown better stability in an ambient atmosphere.62

The main cause of the degradation in the performance of PSCs is the decomposition of perovskite films.63 In order to clarify the change of the composition of the perovskite film, we tested the XRD patterns of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) films. As shown in Fig. 8, the two main peaks corresponding to the (110) and (220) phases of perovskite gradually decrease with time, which has a direct connection with the decomposition of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x. What merits more attention is that the peak corresponding to the (001) phase of PbI2 is gradually weakened and hardly found after 360 h, while its FWHM is enhanced. This shows that fewer and smaller PbI2 particles are produced. In a light and oxygen environment, CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x might decompose into PbI2 and then HI, which could decompose into I2 that could be transferred to the air.61 As shown in Fig. S14a–h,†the surface FESEM images together with EDS spectra and elemental mappings were recorded for the aged (360 h) CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) films. In the SEM images of the two perovskite films, more white spots (might be PbI2 particles) were observed on the surface of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) film.25 As shown in the EDS spectrum, the calculated atomic ratio of I to Pb in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) films is 2.71:1 and 2.55:1, respectively (inset). The percentage of I atoms in the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (0 wt%) film is smaller than that of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) film, indicating that more I is transferred to the air. The rapid reduction in I will inevitably lead to the sharp decomposition of the perovskite film and acceleration of the degradation of the PSC devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we systemically analyzed the effects of V2Ox additives on inverted planar heterojunction PSCs prepared in ambient air. The V2Ox additives that exist in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution contribute significantly to the increase in the size of the perovskite crystals. The high-quality CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) film effectively improves the optoelectronic performance of PSC devices. The devices obtain a PCE of 16.14%, which is 15.3% higher than that of devices without V2Ox additives. In addition, after being stored in air for 1000 h, devices with CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x:V2Ox (2.5 wt%) still maintain a high efficiency, more than 70% of the initial value. It has been universally acknowledged that the stability of devices prepared in ambient air has a profound influence on the commercialization of PSCs.
