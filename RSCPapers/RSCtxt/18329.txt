    , Accepted 10th January 2020First published on 14th January 2020AbstractIn this paper, the geometric and electronic properties of heterojunctions constructed using a graphene sheet and an MASnI3 surface were investigated by performing first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. Our results show that the interaction between graphene and the MASnI3 surface is in the scope of van der Waals interactions. In the heterojunctions, electrons transfer from graphene to the MASnI3 surface, resulting in the formation of a built-in electric field in the interface, which is favorable for the separation of electrons and holes. The absorption spectra showed that the absorption intensity of the heterojunction in the visible region is slightly smaller than that of the pristine MASnI3 surface. The energy barriers of water molecules diffusing through MASnI3 surfaces are relatively low, but when a water molecule penetrates the graphene sheet into the interior of the MASnI3 it has to overcome an energy barrier of as high as 9 eV. It is found that the water diffusions through the surfaces cause very severe damage to the structures of the graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface. So, the graphene can block the penetration of water into the inside of the material and retard the degradation of the perovskites. Coating a graphene sheet onto the MASnI3 surface to form a heterojunction is an effective strategy of enhancing the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells. This study could provide an in-depth understanding of the properties of graphene/MASnI3 heterojunctions and contribute to the design strategy of perovskite-based solar cells.
Introduction
Hybrid halide perovskites have attracted worldwide attention because of their excellent performances, and their excellent power conversion efficiency which has risen from 3.8% to 25.2% in recent decades.1–7 As a representative of hybrid halide perovskites, methylammonium lead iodide, CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), has outstanding electronic and optical properties such as a suitable band gap, long charge carrier diffusion length, limited charge recombination, high absorption coefficient, low carrier effective mass, and low cost of fabrication.8–15 Although MAPbI3 has been used as a photovoltaic and photo-electronic material, there still are some challenges for its broader commercialization. On the one hand, MAPbI3 contains the toxic element Pb, which is harmful to the environment and to human beings.16 On the other hand, MAPbI3 has poor stability and degrades in performance when it is exposed to sunlight and moisture.17–19 Hence, it is urgently required that one finds stable and environmentally friendly alternatives to lead-halide perovskites. The substitution of lead with a group IV element such as Sn or Ge is an effective strategy for improving the performance of MAPbI3. Feng et al. investigated the crystal structure, electronic and optical properties of orthorhombic CH3NH3SnI3 (MASnI3).20 Their results showed that the lattice constants of MASnI3 are smaller than that of MAPbI3, because the ionic radius of Sn2+ is smaller than that of Pb2+. Compared to the band gap of 1.55 eV for MAPbI3,21 MASnI3 has a narrower optical band gap of 1.3 eV,22 implying that it can potentially provide better photovoltaic performance. But, it is well known that Sn2+ in perovskite can be easily oxidized to a Sn4+ state, causing instability of the material.9,23 Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the instability of the hybrid perovskites is related to the interfacial properties of the materials.24,25 So, some strategies for stabilizing the perovskite materials have been developed, including surface modification and passivation using molecular capping ligands, metal oxide shells and organic polymers.26–30 Forming a heterojunction using a two-dimensional semiconductor and the perovskite surface is also a strategy to improve the stability of the perovskite. Experimental studies have confirmed that the TiO2/MAPbI3 heterojunction can improve the performance and stability of solar cell devices,31,32 and theoretical investigation has shown that the SnO2/MAPbI3 heterostructure has a higher power conversion efficiency than TiO2/MAPbI3.33
Graphene has attracted much attention for potential applications in surface coatings and solar cells due to its unique and outstanding physical and chemical properties.34–36 As a zero-gap semiconductor, graphene expresses massless Dirac fermions.37 It can be stably present in ambient environments up to 400 °C and shows high optical transmittance with 97.4%.38,39 Graphene coating is not expected to perturb the optical properties of the underlying materials. In addition, graphene can act as a hydrophobic barrier to block the undesired chemical reactions. Recently, experimental and theoretical investigations on the structures and properties of graphene/MAPbI3 heterojunctions have been reported.40 Lee and coworkers fabricated a hybrid photodetector consisting of graphene and MAPbI3, and showed that it exhibits a significant enhanced photoresponsivity.40 Jiao et al. predicted that the graphene layer can impede the water molecules from further reacting with MAPbI3, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.41
In this work, the environmentally friendly Sn-containing organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, MASnI3, was selected to construct a heterojunction with a graphene sheet. The geometric, electronic and optical properties of the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction were investigated by DFT calculations with the inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) correction. The adsorption of water molecules on the surfaces of MASnI3 and the heterojunction, and the process of water penetration into the interior of MASnI3 were probed. Our results show that the formation of a graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction can effectively protect the perovskite from water infiltration, without affecting its electronic and optical properties in a significant way.
Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the projector augmented wave (PAW) methods.42–44 We employed Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as the exchange–correlation functional.45 The van der Waals interaction, vdw-DF, was included in the calculations to describe the dispersive interaction.46–48 The cutoff energy of plane wave function was set to 500 eV. The convergence criterion for the self-consistent energy was set to 1 × 10−5 eV, and the force criterion of 0.02 eV Å−1 was adopted in the relaxation procedure. A vacuum of 15 Å was set along the z direction to avoid the spurious interactions between periodic images of the slabs. A 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid was chosen for sampling the Brillouin zones (BZs). The valence electronic configurations of H 1s1, C 2s22p2, N 2s22p3, Sn 4d105s25p2 and I 5s25p5 were considered in the calculations. The (001) surface is split form tetragonal MASnI3 with a space group of I4cm. Then a graphene sheet is put on the top of the (001) surface to construct a graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction.
The effective mass m* was calculated using the formula:49 (1)where k is the reciprocal lattice vector and E(k) is the energy. For the absorption spectrum, the optical absorption coefficient α can be obtained from the definition:50 (2)where ω is the frequency of light, and ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. The energy profiles for water molecules penetrating the surface of MASnI3 and the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction were calculated with the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.51
Results and discussion
1. Structure and binding energy of the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction
The tetragonal phase of MASnI3 was selected for investigating the structure and properties of the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction. The relaxed lattice constants of the MASnI3 bulk are a = b = 8.84 Å and c = 12.93 Å, which are consistent with the experimental values.13 The (001) surface slab with six atomic layers was split from tetragonal MASnI3. Here, two types of (001) surfaces were considered, i.e., SnI2-terminated and MAI-terminated surfaces. The calculated surface energies of SnI2-terminated and MAI-terminated surfaces are 0.010 eV Å−2 and 0.003 eV Å−2, respectively, indicating that these two surfaces are easily formed. A square graphene sheet with a side length of 8.87 Å was chosen to match the (001) surface of MASnI3. The structures of graphene sheet and two types of heterojunctions are shown in Fig. 1.

In order to search for stable configurations of the heterojunctions, we first optimized the distance between the graphene and MASnI3(001) surface, by considering the binding energy as a criterion for judgment. The binding energy of the heterojunction was calculated according to the following formula: Eb = Ehetero − Egraphene − Esurface(3)where Ehetero, Egraphene, and Esurface are the total energies of the relaxed graphene/MASnI3 heterojunctions, isolated graphene sheet and MASnI3(001) surface, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the distances corresponding to the most negative binding energies of garphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI heterojunctions are 3.75 Å and 3.2 Å, respectively. Then, based on the distances obtained above, we performed full relaxation for the geometries of the heterojunctions. The optimal distances after the relaxation are 3.90 Å and 2.80 Å for garphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI heterojunctions, respectively, which are within the scope of van der Waals interactions. These distances are very close to the results reported by Du et al.41 They found that the equilibrium distance between graphene and the PbI2/MAI surface slab in the graphene/MAPbI3 heterojunction is 3.8/2.8 Å. The lattice mismatch ratio and mismatch energy were calculated to evaluate the structural rationality of the heterojunction. The lattice mismatch ratio is defined as σ = (a2 − a1)/a1, where a1 and a2 are the lattice constants of MASnI3 surface and graphene, respectively. For the study of two types of heterojunctions, the mismatch ratio is only 0.3%; Guo et al. suggest that a mismatch ratio of less than 5% indicates that a stable heterojunction can be formed,52 so the graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface can match well and form a stable heterojunction. The mismatch energy of the heterojunction can be obtained by the following expression: Emismatch = (Egraphene + Esurface − Egraphene′ − Esurface′)/A(4)where Egraphene and Esurface are the total energies of the separate graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface with the geometries in the heterojunction, respectively. Egraphene′ and Egraphene′ are the relaxed isolated graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface, respectively. A represents the area of the heterojunction. The mismatch energies are 0.0019 eV Å−2 and 0.0020 eV Å−2 for the graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI, respectively, which are smaller than the value of 0.0032 eV Å−2 of graphene/MAPbI3.53 It means that graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI heterojunctions have almost the same mismatch energies, and they are smaller than that of the heterojunction formed by graphene and the MAPbI3 surface. It can therefore be expected that stable heterojunctions can be formed using a graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface.

The calculated interfacial binding energies are −0.92 eV and −0.71 eV for graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI, respectively. Du et al. reported that the binding energy per unit area are −0.0122 eV Å−2 and −0.0104 eV Å−2 for graphene/PbI2 and graphene/MAI in graphene/MAPbI3 heterojunctions,41 similar to our binding energy per unit area of −0.0117 eV Å−2 and −0.0090 eV Å−2 for graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI, respectively. The binding energy of graphene/SnI2 is more negative than that of graphene/MAI, indicating that graphene/SnI2 is more stable than graphene/MAI, and the heterojunction is more easily formed on the SnI2-terminated surface. In general, the formation of a heterojunction will cause the structural distortion of the individual layers. By analyzing the atomic coordinates, we found that the structures of graphene sheet and MASnI3 surfaces (SnI2-terminated and MAI-terminated) do not significantly change due to the formation of the heterojunction. For the graphene layer in the heterojunction, the average bond length before and after relaxing is 1.42 Å, similar to the average length 1.41 Å measured at 300 K by Fasolino.54 For the SnI2-terminated MASnI3 surface in the heterojunction, the maximum change of Sn–I bond length before and after optimization is reduced from 3.53 to 3.36 Å, the average bond length of Sn–I is 3.21 Å, similar to 3.17 Å reported by Mosconi.55 The average bond angle of I–Sn–I is almost unchanged, remaining at 90.0°. The bond length of Sn–I and the bond angle of I–Sn–I was not significantly changed by the formation of the heterojunction. The structural distortion of the MAI-terminated surface in the heterojunction is similar to that of the SnI2-terminated surface.
Electron transfer between the graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface can be seen from the 3D diagram of charge density difference (CDD), which is calculated according to the following formula: Δρ = ρhetero − ρsurface − ρgraphene(5)where ρhetero, ρsurface and ρgraphene are the electronic densities of the heterojunction, pure MASnI3(001) surface and graphene, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c), there is indeed a redistribution of electron density between graphene and MASnI3 surface in the heterojunction. Electrons deplete near the graphene sheet (cyan region) and accumulate near the MASnI3 surface (yellow region). The electrons are mainly transferred from carbon to iodine atom. The electron accumulation and depletion in the interface can also be illustrated by the planar-averaged electron density difference along the z-direction. It can be seen from Fig. 3(b) and (d), that the graphene sheet loses electrons and the MASnI3 surface gains electrons by the formation of the heterojunction. The electron transfer from graphene to MASnI3 surface results in the formation of the built-in electric field in the interface, which is favorable for the separation of electrons and holes.

The heterojunctions studied here are composed of a pristine perovskite surface and perfect graphene sheet. In fact, the formation of defects is inevitable during the synthesis of perovskite materials. To evaluate the effect of defects on the interaction between graphene and the perovskite surface, we calculated the binding energies of heterojunctions with defects. First, we considered the graphene monolayer with a carbon vacancy (VC). Our calculated formation energy of defect VC is 7.7 eV at the GGA-PBE level. It is highly consistent with the value of 7.7 eV calculated by Krasheninnikov and co-workers using the PWDFT method,56 and is in good agreement with the experimental value of 7.0 ± 0.5 eV.57 Such a high formation energy leads to the negligible concentration of vacancy defects at the working temperature of solar cell devices. Thus we only investigated the heterojunctions formed by the perfect graphene and perovskite surface with a point defect. For the perovskite surface defects, the Sn atom vacancy (VSn) and I atom vacancy (VI) in the SnI2-terminated surface were considered here. The relaxed configurations for the heterojunctions with perovskite surface defects are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The binding energy between graphene and perovskite surfaces with VSn and VI are −0.96 eV and −0.79 eV, respectively, which are not greatly different to the value of −0.92 eV in the graphene/SnI2 heterojunction. It can be concluded that the defects in the perovskite surface can not evidently affect the stability of the heterojunction. Therefore, the heterojunctions formed by the perfect graphene sheet and pristine perovskite surface were used in the studies of electronic and optical properties, and the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of heterojunctions.
2. Electronic and optical properties of graphene/MASnI3
To illustrate clearly the electronic and optical properties of the heterojunction, the band structure, effective masses of the carriers and absorption spectra of the heterojunctions were calculated. They are calculated in the reciprocal space along the path of Γ(0 0 0)–N(0.5 −0.5 0)–Γ(0 0 0) of the Brillouin zone. The band structure of the pristine graphene exhibits the properties of the Dirac point as shown in Fig. 4(c).58 For the MASnI3(001) surface, the band gaps of SnI2-terminated and MAI-terminated surfaces are 0.76 eV and 0.97 eV, respectively. In the heterojunction, the Dirac point of graphene is still retained, and the band gaps at the Γ point are increased by 0.35 eV and 0.01 eV in graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI, respectively. The band structures show that the van der Vaals interaction between the graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface does not significantly disrupt the electronic properties of the components, which is advantageous for the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction to be a promising candidate of solar cell materials.

The effective masses of electrons and holes in the MASnI3(001) surfaces and heterojunctions were calculated and are listed in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that me = 0.77m0, mh = −0.15m0 in the SnI2-terminated surface, and me = 0.39m0, mh = −0.19m0 in the MAI-terminated surface. The effective mass of electrons in the MASnI3 surface is larger than that in the bulk calculated by Pan et al.,59 where me = 0.15m0 and mh = −0.14m0. At the Dirac point, graphene has an infinite longitudinal effective mass and no mass in the transverse direction.60 In order to investigate the effect of graphene covering the MASnI3 surface, only the effective mass of the MASnI3 surface at the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the heterojunction were calculated. When graphene contacts the SnI2-terminated surface to form a heterojunction, the effective mass of electrons decreases from 0.77m0 to 0.51m0, which is in favor of electron transport. The mh has little change in this case. The me and mh in the graphene/MAI heterojunction have no great changes compared with that in the pristine MAI-terminated surface. In general, the formation of the heterojunction between graphene and the MASnI3(001) surface has little influence on the effective masses of carriers of the MASnI3 surface.

As light harvesters, the hybrid perovskites have excellent light absorption in the visible region due to their appropriate band gaps. In order to reveal the effect of covering the graphene on the optical properties of MASnI3, the absorption spectra of the MASnI3 surface, graphene sheet, and heterojunctions were calculated. The light absorption at the edge of the band is due to the electronic transition from the s orbital of the tin atom and the p orbital of the iodine atom to the p orbital of the tin atom in the MASnI3 surface, as can be seen from the calculated total and partial density of states (DOS) given in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† From Fig. 5, it can be seen that graphene has a very low light absorption as expected, being consistent with experimental observations.39 The MAI-terminated surface has the highest absorption intensity at about λ = 312 nm. The absorption intensity of the SnI2-terminated surface is slightly smaller than that of the MAI-terminated surface. Both of the two heterojunctions, graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI, show a very similar absorption spectra in the visible region. The absorption intensities of the heterojunctions are a little bit lower than that of the pristine surfaces. Therefore, the coupling of graphene and the MASnI3 surface has no significant influence on the light absorption in the visible region.

3. Adsorption of H2O molecules on the surfaces
It is well known that organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are easily degraded in moist atmospheres, and it is expected that a surface coating can greatly improve the stability of perovskite materials. In order to evaluate the effect of surface coating using graphene sheets, we investigated the adsorption and penetration of water molecules on the surfaces of MASnI3 and heterojunctions. The stable adsorption sites obtained by the relaxation of adsorbed systems are shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). The adsorption sites considered here are top sites of Sn and I, hollow site and bridge site for SnI2-terminated surface of MASnI3 (Fig. 6a); top sites of I and CH3NH3+, hollow site and bridge site for MAI-terminated surface (Fig. 6b); top site of C atom and top site of center of carbon-ring for the heterojunctions (Fig. 6c and d). The most stable adsorption configurations of water molecules on different adsorption sites of MASnI3 and heterojunctions are shown in Fig. 6(e)–(s). The water molecules and the atoms in the graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface have no obvious deformation upon the adsorption. The adsorption energy is calculated from the following definition: Ead = Emolecule/surface − Esurface − Emolecule(6)where Emolecule/surface, Esurface and Emolecule are the energies of the relaxed adsorption system, the surface of MASnI3 or heterojunction, and the isolated H2O molecule. The adsorption energies of water molecules on different sites are listed in Table 2. For the case of H2O adsorbed on the SnI2-terminated surface of MASnI3, the preferred adsorption site is the Sn top site, given the shortest O–Sn distance of 2.56 Å and the largest adsorption energy of 0.53 eV. When H2O is adsorbed on the MAI-terminated surface, the strongest adsorption occurs on the CH3NH3+ top site with the distance of 2.50 Å and adsorption energy of 0.31 eV. For all adsorption sites of the surface of MASnI3, except for the top of Sn, there are hydrogen bonds in the adsorption configurations, resulting in the relatively large adsorption energies. When a water molecule adsorbs on the graphene sheet of the heterojunction, there are four adsorption patterns, i.e., H and O atoms of H2O adsorb on the top of the C atom and the center of the carbon-ring, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. From Table 2 we can see that the H2O adsorptions on the top site of the C atom and the center of the carbon-ring have no obvious difference, with the average adsorption energy of 0.18 eV. In comparison with the adsorption on the surfaces of MASnI3, H2O adsorptions on the graphene sheet of heterojunctions are weak. Therefore, the graphene sheet of heterojunctions has a smaller affinity to water molecules than the surface of MASnI3.

To further explain the interactions between water molecules and the surfaces of MASnI3 and heterojunctions, the projected density of states (PDOS) and charge density difference (CDD) for the adsorbed systems are shown in Fig. 7. Four stable configurations of water adsorption, i.e., O adsorbed on the Sn top site of SnI2-terminated surface, H adsorbed on CH3NH3+ top site of MAI-terminated surface, H adsorbed on the C top site of the graphene/MAI, and O adsorbed on C top site of the graphene/SnI2, were chosen as examples for performing analysis of PDOS and CDD. It can be found from Fig. 7a that in the system of H2O adsorbed on the Sn site of SnI2-terminated surface, the overlaps between the PDOS of Sn and O atoms occur in many energy bands of the valence band region, meaning there is a strong interaction between the Sn and O atoms. The 3D plot of CDD in Fig. 7(a) shows clearly that electrons depleted on the Sn atom of the surface and H atom of H2O, and electrons accumulated on the I atom of the surface and O atom of H2O. When H2O is adsorbed at the CH3NH3+ top site of the MAI-terminated surface, as shown in Fig. 7(b), there is a large degree of overlap between the PDOS of O and I atoms and a certain degree of overlap between H and I atoms at about −3 eV, indicating a relatively strong interaction between the O and I atoms and the formation of H⋯I hydrogen bonds. The CDD plot in Fig. 7(b) shows that the electron accumulation occurs on the I atom of the surface and O atom, and the electron depletion occurs on the H atom of H2O and a part of the CH3NH3+ cation near the O atom. There is also an electron accumulation on part of the CH3NH3+ near the surface of MASnI3. For the adsorption of a H atom of H2O on the C top site of graphene in the graphene/MAI heterojunction, see Fig. 7(c), there is a certain overlap between O, H, and C atoms. A H atom loses electrons and an O atom gains electrons, and the electron accumulation happens on the C atoms in the vicinity of H2O and the electron depletion happens on the C atoms far away from the H2O molecule. In the case of the O atom of H2O adsorbed on the C top site of graphene in the graphene/SnI2, the PDOS is similar with that of H adsorbed on the C top site of graphene in the graphene/MAI, but the situation of charge redistribution is completely different. For the O adsorption on the C top site of graphene/SnI2, electron depletion appears on the C atoms near the H2O and electron accumulation occurs on the C atoms far from the H2O molecule, see Fig. 7(c) and (d).

(a) O adsorbed on the Sn top site of SnI2-terminated surface; (b) H adsorbed on the CH3NH3+ top of MAI-terminated surface; (c) H adsorbed on C top of graphene/MAI heterojunction; (d) O adsorbed on C top of graphene/SnI2 heterojunction. Yellow and cyan represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. 
To further probe the charge transfer in the process of H2O adsorption on the surfaces of MASnI3 and heterojunctions, atomic Bader charges were calculated and are listed in Table S1 of the ESI.† For H2O adsorbed on the Sn top site of the SnI2-terminated MASnI3 surface, Sn atom loses 0.08 electrons, I gains 0.04 electrons, and H2O also gains 0.04 electrons. The net charge transfer from the surface to the water molecule is only 0.04 electrons. For H2O adsorbed on the CH3NH3+ top site of the MAI-terminated surface, only 0.03 electrons transferred from the surface to the H2O molecule. In the case of H2O adsorbed on the graphene sheet of the heterojunction, there is almost no charge transfer between the graphene and H2O molecule. On the whole, there is no obvious charge transfer in the processes of water molecule adsorption on the surfaces of MASnI3 and heterojunctions.
4. Diffusion of a H2O molecule
In order to explore the detailed process of perovskite degradation, we investigated the diffusion of H2O molecules from the outside of the surface into the interior of the MASnI3 slab and heterojunction by the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. Six points evenly distributed between the initial and final states were selected for each diffusion process. Fig. 8 shows the energy profiles and adsorption configurations at the initial state, transition state, and final state of the diffusion paths. The detailed adsorption configurations in the diffusion processes are presented in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† When a H2O molecule diffuses through the first layer of the SnI2-terminated surface, it does not encounter an obvious resistance. The diffusion barrier is only 0.11 eV. This is because the first layer of the SnI2-terminated surface contains only Sn and I atoms, and there are larger void spaces between these atoms. The energy barrier of H2O passing through the MAI layer of the MAI-terminated surface is 0.53 eV, which is larger than that of the H2O passing through the SnI2 layer, owing to the obstruction of filled organic molecules. Liu et al.24 have reported that the energy barriers of H2O successively diffusing through the MAI and PbI2 layers of the MAI-terminated surface of MAPbI3 are 0.04 and 0.31 eV, respectively. So the diffusions of water molecules from the outside into the interior of the slab of MASnI3 and MAPbI3 perovskites are different. Overall, the energy barriers of these two diffusion processes mentioned above are relatively low, meaning the water molecule can easily penetrate the surface into the inside of the MASnI3 perovskite. By analyzing the geometric parameters of the configurations in the diffusion processes, we found that the water diffusion causes severe distortion of the MASnI3 surface. As examples, the length of the Sn–I bond in equatorial direction (x–y plane) near the diffusion path in the SnI2-terminated surface changed from 3.51 Å to 4.26 Å, and the Sn–I bond in the vertical direction (z axis) in the MAI-terminated surface elongated from 3.23 Å to 5.63 Å. Therefore, the adsorption, diffusion and penetration of H2O molecules can destroy the surface structure and degrade the MASnI3 perovskite ultimately.
 Fig. 8  Eenergy profiles of water molecules diffusing through the surfaces of MASnI3 and the heterojunction. (a) SnI2-terminated surface of MASnI3; (b) MAI-terminated surface of MASnI3; (c) graphene/SnI2 heterojunction; (d) graphene/MAI heterojunction. The energy at the initial state is set to zero. 
The diffusion of H2O molecules passing through the graphene sheet of the heterojunction is almost impossible. The energy barriers are 9.44 and 8.68 eV for H2O passing through the graphene sheets of graphene/SnI2 and graphene/MAI heterojunctions, respectively. The dissociation energies of O–H and C–C bonds are 5.45 eV and 3.83 eV, respectively.61,62 The energy barrier of up to 9 eV is enough to break O–H and C–C bonds. As shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† the graphene monoatomic layer has been destroyed and is no longer a planar structure. The H–O bonds in the H2O molecules have been broken completely at the TS. The H and O atoms form chemical bonds with the C atom of graphene. Furthermore, these C atoms have a tendency to form a tetrahedral configuration, and the hybridization of C atom changes from sp2 to sp3. On the whole, the H2O molecule passing through the graphene sheet, and reaching the surface of MASnI3 is a very difficult process. It must break the C–C and O–H bonds, and thus overcome a quite high energy barrier. Therefore, the formation of a heterojunction between a graphene sheet and MASnI3 can resist the adsorption of water molecules on the MASnI3 surface, block the penetration of water into the interior of the material, and retard the happening of chemical reaction and degradation of the perovskites. Coating a graphene sheet on the MASnI3 surface to form a heterojunction is an effective strategy of enhancing the stability and performance of the perovskite solar cell materials.
In addition, the Sn2+ in MASnI3 perovskite is easily oxidized to a Sn4+ state, so oxygen is also one of the important factors of causing the degradation of MASnI3. We anticipate that the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction can also resist the attack of oxygen molecules and improve the stability of MASnI3 perovskites. It is our next target to explore the adsorption, diffusion and penetration of O2 molecules on the surfaces of MASnI3 and the graphene/MASnI3 heterojunction.
Conclusions
In summary, we have performed first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the geometric and electronic properties of heterojunctions formed by a graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface. Our results show that the interaction between graphene and the MASnI3 surface is in the scope of van der Waals interaction. The formation of the heterojunction did not cause great structural distortion of the graphene and MASnI3 surface. In the formation of the heterojunction, electrons transfer from graphene to the MASnI3 surface, resulting in the formation of a built-in electric field in the interface, which is favorable for the separation of electrons and holes. The van der Vaals interaction between the graphene sheet and MASnI3 surface has no great influence on the band structures and effective masses of carriers of the perovskites. The absorption spectra showed that the absorption intensity of the heterojunction in the visible region is slightly smaller than that of the pristine MASnI3 surface. The calculated adsorption energies indicated that the graphene sheet of the heterojunction has a smaller affinity to water molecules than the MASnI3 surface. The energy barriers of water molecules diffusing through MASnI3 surfaces are relatively low, but when a water molecule penetrates the graphene sheet into the interior of the MASnI3 material it has to overcome an energy barrier of as high as 9 eV. It is found that the water diffusions through the surfaces cause very severe damage on the structures of the graphene sheet and the MASnI3 surface. So, it can be concluded that the graphene can block the penetration of water into the inside of the material, and retard the degradation of the perovskites. Coating a graphene sheet on the MASnI3 surface to form a heterojunction is an effective strategy of enhancing the stability of the perovskite solar cell materials.
