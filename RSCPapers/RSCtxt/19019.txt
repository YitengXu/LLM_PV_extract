    , Accepted 11th February 2015First published on 16th March 2015AbstractSemiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) are promising candidates as the active layer in photovoltaics (PV), particularly for niche applications where high infrared absorbance and/or semi-transparent solar cells are desirable. Most current fabrication strategies for SWCNT PV devices suffer from relatively high surface roughness and lack nanometer-scale deposition precision, both of which may hamper the reproducible production of ultrathin devices. Additionally, detailed optical models of SWCNT PV devices are lacking, due in part to a lack of well-defined optical constants for high-purity s-SWCNT thin films. Here, we present an optical model that accurately reconstructs the shape and magnitude of spectrally resolved external quantum efficiencies for ultrathin (7,5) s-SWCNT/C60 solar cells that are deposited by ultrasonic spraying. The ultrasonic spraying technique enables thickness tuning of the s-SWCNT layer with nanometer-scale precision, and consistently produces devices with low s-SWCNT film average surface roughness (Rq of <5 nm). Our optical model, based entirely on measured optical constants of each layer within the device stack, enables quantitative predictions of thickness-dependent relative photocurrent contributions of SWCNTs and C60 and enables estimates of the exciton diffusion lengths within each layer. These results establish routes towards rational performance improvements and scalable fabrication processes for ultra-thin SWCNT-based solar cells.
Introduction
Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) are promising candidates for the photo-absorbing material of inexpensive flexible photovoltaics because of their strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption and high carrier mobilities.1–4 The bandgaps of s-SWCNTs can be tuned by altering the nanotube diameter, allowing selective overlap with particular regions of the solar spectrum.5 For example, recent calculations for SWCNT solar cells containing four distinct SWCNT diameters predict a potential sunlight harvesting efficiency of 19–28%, with primary solar capture tuned either to the visible (28%, large band gap SWCNTs) or NIR (19%, small band gap SWCNTs).6 Such tunability may be beneficial for novel applications, such as building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) windows, where simultaneously high NIR absorbance and high visible transmittance are desirable. Importantly, the SWCNTs in PV devices are typically coupled with other semiconductors (e.g. C60) that establish a Type-II heterojunction, providing an energetic driving force for the exciton dissociation and charge separation that drives photocurrent.7–10 Current state-of-the-art bilayer SWCNT PV devices, based on s-SWCNT/C60 heterojunctions, have reached AM1.5 G power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of ∼1%,3 whereas blended heterojunction devices have recently attained PCE values of ∼2–3%.11,12
Although still slightly lower in efficiency relative to heterojunction devices, bilayer s-SWCNT/C60 solar cells have exceptional diode qualities and internal quantum efficiencies, making them interesting model systems for ultrathin devices based on quantum-confined carbon active layers. The photocurrent extracted from such devices should depend sensitively on the exciton diffusion length within each layer (SWCNT and C60), as well as the optical field distribution within the device, which depends sensitively on the precise thickness of each layer and can amplify the photocurrent extracted from specific regions of the solar spectrum.13 To probe such a model system, with optical properties defined by layers that can vary on the nanometer scale, it is important to develop methods for precision deposition of each corresponding layer, as well as models that can accurately account for the dependence of photocurrent generation on the optical field within the device. While fullerenes can be deposited with high precision by thermal evaporation, typical methods used previously for s-SWCNT deposition (e.g. doctor-blading,13 spin-coating14 or vacuum filtration15) have several drawbacks, especially for printing uniform thin s-SWCNT films of prescribed thicknesses from organic solvent-based inks. Furthermore, detailed optical models of the SWCNT/C60 device stack have thus-far been hampered by a lack of measured optical constants for highly enriched s-SWCNTs.
In this study, we develop an ultrasonic spraying method for preparing bilayer heterojunction solar cells with monochiral (7,5) s-SWCNTs as the dominant source of NIR photocurrent generation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical profilometry measurements demonstrate that this spraying method produces smooth, uniform films with an average roughness of <5 nm. This low surface roughness enables the fabrication of s-SWCNT/C60 bilayer devices with significantly thinner C60 layers than other devices reported in the literature. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used for the first time to determine the wavelength-dependent optical constants of (7,5) s-SWCNT thin films. We apply an optical model to calculate the optical field within our devices, using the measured thicknesses and optical constants of each layer as the only material property inputs. This model is able to accurately reconstruct the shape and magnitude of external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for devices with widely varying C60 layer thicknesses by assuming upper limits of ∼15 nm for the exciton diffusion lengths (LD) within both the C60 and s-SWCNT layers. The model also enables the prediction of particular device geometries that maximize photocurrent in different regions of the solar spectrum, an important advance for the future rational design of SWCNT/fullerene thin-film PV devices and photodetectors.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFO) was purchased from American Dye Source (Light Emitting Polymer ADS129BE). Toluene was purchased as ACS Reagent grade from Acros. SWCNT samples (SG65i-L43, -L48), synthesized from cobalt molybdenum catalysis of carbon monoxide disproportionation (CoMoCAT), were purchased from SouthWest NanoTechnologies. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was purchased from Heraeus (Clevios™ P VP AI 4083). C60 (Nano-C, >99.5%), bathocuproine (Aldrich, 96%), and silver pellets (Kurt J. Lesker, 99.99%, ⅛′′ × ⅛′′) were used for evaporation. Indium tin oxide substrates (ITO) were purchased from Thin Film Technologies and cleaned by scrubbing with diluted Liquinox detergent, followed by sonication in successive 10 minute acetone and isopropanol baths. The ITO substrates were then cleaned by 5 minutes of oxygen plasma in a Technics West 500-II model plasma etcher. All other materials were used as received.
Selective (7,5) SWCNT dispersions and ink preparation
To isolate (7,5) SWCNTs, we ultrasonically dispersed CoMoCat SWCNTs in PFO and toluene.16 PFO (22 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of toluene while heating (70 °C). SG65i (10 mg) was suspended in the PFO solution and sonicated for 30 minutes using a probe sonicator operating at 40% amplitude (Cole Palmer Model CPX 750, 20 kHz). The SG65i/PFO solution was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13200 rpm and 20 °C (Beckman-Coulter Optima L-100 XP Ultracentrifuge, SW32 Ti Rotor and Beckman-Coulter centrifuge tubes, polyallomer). A uniform SWCNT dispersion was obtained by decanting the supernatant by pipette, and filtering the supernatant through a kimwipe if precipitate particles were visible in the solution.
The SWCNT dispersion solution (40 mL) was then placed in a polyallomer centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 20 hours at 24100 rpm and 0 °C to remove excess PFO. The polymer/toluene supernatant was decanted and the SWCNT precipitate was sonicated in toluene using a water bath sonicator. Centrifugation was repeated with the same conditions until UV-vis-NIR analysis indicated that the mass ratio of PFO:SWCNT for the SWCNT ink sample was ∼1:1.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated in air at room temperature onto the cleaned ITO substrates (4000–4300 rpm, 60 seconds), followed by annealing in air at 120 °C for 10 minutes. The SWCNT ink was then spray-coated in air onto PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates using ultrasonic spraying.17–19 The ultrasonic sprayer utilizes a Sonotek 120 kHz Impact nozzle. Room temperature SWCNT ink was sprayed at 400 μl min−1 under nitrogen flowing at 6.8 std L min−1 with 0.8 Watt ultrasonic spray head power. The substrate was heated to 130 ± 10 °C while spraying. UV-vis-NIR spectra and AFM profile measurements of these devices were used to estimate SWCNT layer thickness.
The sprayed ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(7,5) SWCNT films were soaked in toluene for 60 minutes at 70 °C to remove excess PFO. Thermal evaporation was used to deposit films of C60 (1 Å s−1) with varying thickness in the range of ∼30–80 nm, followed by a 10 nm layer of bathocuproine (BCP) (0.5 Å s−1) at <10−6 Torr in a glovebox-integrated evaporator (Angstrom Engineering NexDep Series) with a nitrogen atmosphere. The thickness of BCP was confirmed on a witness slide to be 10 nm ± 20% by atomic force microscopy (Park ZE-70 system with Budget Sensors Tap300_G Tips). The thickness of the C60 was calculated using the optical density of the peak at 442 nm (absorption coefficient, 1.21 × 105 cm−1).20 A 100 nm layer of the silver back contact was deposited in a separate, nitrogen atmosphere, glovebox-integrated thermal evaporation system (Angstrom Engineering EvoVac-600) at a rate of 0.8–1.8 Å s−1. Samples were transferred between the gloveboxes using KF-sealed transfer tubes.
Spectrophotometry, profilometry, atomic force microscopy
Optical absorption data were collected with a Cary 500 Scan Spectrophotometer between 250 and 1400 nm using baseline correction. Optical profilometry was carried out on a Veeco Wyko NT1100 Optical Profiling System using phase-shifting interferometry. Atomic force microscopy (Asylum Research MFP-3D) images were generated in tapping mode using a <2 nm radius tip (Nanosensors™ SSS-NCHR).
Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements
Optical constants of the SWCNT layers were determined using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000 VASE, J.A. Woollam Co). The measured ellipsometric parameters Psi (amplitude ratio) and Delta (phase difference) values were fitted by a Cauchy model to extract the refractive index n(λ) and the extinction coefficient k(λ), using the WVASE32® software package. The measurements were performed at 65°, 70°, and 75° angles of incidence, in the 190–1700 nm spectral range.

J–V and EQE measurements

J–V measurements were taken in a glovebox on a solar simulator using a xenon arc lamp operating at 450 Watts (Newport Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator) under 1 sun, AM1.5 G illumination. The lamp was calibrated using a silicon reference diode (Hamamatsu S1336-8BQ). Light and dark J–V data were collected for a standard device of 0.101 cm2 through a 0.061 cm2 metal aperture from −1 V to 1 V. Data were not corrected for solar mismatch. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained using a frequency of 67 Hz, from a Newport Oriel system integrated into a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox using a Xenon light source. The system was calibrated with a Newport silicon and germanium combination detector.
Optical modeling
Our optical model is based on the 2 × 2 scattering matrix formalism of Pettersson et al.,21,22 and has been used successfully at NREL to calculate quantum efficiency in a number of different multi-layer PV devices, such as those based on quantum dot absorbers.23 The model calculates the optical electric field distribution within a device stack as a function of depth and wavelength, assuming isotropic and homogeneous layers separated by plane parallel interfaces. Material property inputs to the model include the index of refraction n(λ), extinction coefficient k(λ) and thickness of each layer. Also included are the spectral irradiance, angle of incidence and polarization of the illumination, as well as reflections at the air–glass interface and dispersion within the glass substrate. From these inputs, the model calculates the spectral reflectance and transmittance of the device, the absorptance in each layer, and the wavelength-dependent generation rate G(λ,x) (number of photons absorbed at each wavelength) as a function of depth in the device. At each wavelength, the average rate of photon absorption at a distance x into the device is proportional to the product of the modulus squared of the optical electric field E(λ,x), the index of refraction n(λ,x) and the absorption coefficient α(λ,x), divided by the photon energy hν: (1)
In eqn (1), α(λ,x) = 4πk(λ,x)/λ .
Results and discussion
Fabrication and optical characterization of SWCNT films
In this study, we employ nearly monochiral (7,5) s-SWCNT films as part of the photovoltaic active layer of bilayer SWCNT/C60 thin-film solar cells. Metallic or small-bandgap s-SWCNTs can create traps and quench excitons and charges,10 thereby reducing photovoltaic efficiency for films with a high dispersity of different nanotube chiralities.24 SWCNT/C60 bilayer heterojunctions with a SWCNT film containing five different chiralities have achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22% for excitation of the first SWCNT exciton transitions (S11),25 while similar heterojunctions with a film of monochiral (7,5) SWCNTs achieved 34% EQE at S11.13 Excess polymer removal is also important for fabricating efficient PV devices, as reducing the PFO:SWCNT ratio from 3.5 to 1.3 has been shown to increase EQE by ∼150%, hypothesized to result from increased tube–tube coupling.25 For our devices, we removed excess PFO polymer to achieve a ∼1:1 mass ratio of PFO:SWCNTs.
Following PFO removal, an ultrasonic spray system17–19 was used to deposit the (7,5) s-SWCNT active layer. Fig. 1a displays the absorbance spectra of a thin (7,5) s-SWCNT film immediately after spraying onto a quartz slide (blue trace) and also after soaking the as-sprayed film in toluene at 70 °C (red trace). Several sharp peaks corresponding to excitonic transitions (S11, S22, S33) and vibronic sidebands (X11, X22)26 of the (7,5) s-SWCNT are labeled. Only minor contributions from other s-SWCNTs are observed at ∼1130 nm and 1190 nm ((7,6) and (8,6) s-SWCNTs, respectively), and analysis of the absorbance spectrum indicates these species represent less than 5% of the SWCNT population. Furthermore, no evidence can be seen for m-SWCNT impurities, as observed in our previous studies of polyfluorene-extracted s-SWCNTs.27 Several changes occur for the film absorbance following the toluene soak. The S11 peak (1044 nm) broadens from 32 meV to 52 meV FWHM, indicating a change in dielectric environment and/or increased electronic coupling between SWCNTs. The primary broad absorbance peak of PFO (387 nm) decreases in intensity, indicating the removal of some PFO, and a small side peak observed at 430 nm disappears completely. This side peak has been attributed to extended backbone conjugation within the beta phase, and is a useful indication of PFO aggregation.28 The disappearance of this 430 nm shoulder indicates that the toluene soak removes a large proportion of PFO that presumably aggregates during solvent evaporation. Some of the SWCNTs are removed as well, as indicated by a reduction in the S11 peak area, but to a much lesser extent than the PFO loss. After soaking, the integrated absorbance area of the PFO peaks is reduced by ∼40%, whereas the SWCNT S11 area is only reduced by ∼5%.
 Fig. 1  (a) Soaking (7,5)-SWNT spray-coated ITO films in toluene (70 °C, 60 minutes) resulted in peak broadening and height decrease for the S11 exciton transition. The peak area of the S11 transition was used to calculate comparative loss in film thickness due to toluene soaking. (b) SWCNT film absorbance can be adjusted with fine control by the number of coats sprayed at a given pump rate of solution. (c) AFM image (1 μm × 1 μm) of a SWCNT film, ∼18 nm thick. (d) Film thickness can be approximated using the film absorbance, after correlating with AFM height measurements. 
The thickness of the s-SWCNT active layer can be controlled with good precision in the ultrasonic spray process simply by adjusting the number of sprayer passes for a given dispersion concentration and pump rate. Fig. 1b demonstrates that the absorbance intensity of the S11 peak increases linearly with the number of sprayer passes for films that have undergone the final toluene soak. This linearity demonstrates that the entire spray process is robust in generating uniform thin films with prescribed thicknesses. Such precision is difficult to achieve for techniques such as doctor blading, slot dye, and Gravure coating, especially for very thin films that are necessarily deposited from non-viscous dispersions.29 The morphological features of the SWCNT films post-toluene soak were further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The height profiles of several films, measured by AFM, were used to generate a calibration curve (Fig. 1d) correlating the film thickness to the optical density of the S11 peak (ODS11, after the toluene soak) by UV-vis-NIR absorbance. Film thicknesses (tnm) reported in this study were calculated by the linear fit of this calibration line (tnm = 68 × ODS11).
Topographical irregularities with heights on the scale of the acceptor (C60) film thickness can lead to short-circuited devices or efficiency losses arising from low shunt resistance, so it is important to develop film deposition strategies that result in uniform films with low surface roughness over large areas. An important observation from the AFM measurements (Fig. 1) is that the average surface roughness of the ultrasonic spray-deposited (7,5) s-SWCNT films was extremely low following the toluene soak. The surface roughness of the ∼18 nm thick film shown in Fig. 1c was ∼2.5 nm, and the average surface roughness for the three films measured by AFM in Fig. 1d was 3.8 ± 1.5 nm. To probe the film topography over larger areas, we turned to optical profilometry of films both before and after the toluene soak (Fig. S1†). Optical profilometry of the as-sprayed ∼9 nm film (Fig. S1a†) demonstrates that the spray process leaves a residue of raised material (presumably PFO, SWCNTs, and potentially solvent impurities) in the form of circular droplets and some raised pillars. A recent study demonstrated that spraying from organic solvents (without surfactants) produced films with significant “coffee stain” rings formed by the rapidly drying droplets.30 These rings were removed by soaking the film in a warm solvent bath. Consistently, optical profilometry of the (7,5) s-SWCNT films post-toluene soak showed that the droplet residue features were smoothed out (Fig. S1b†). Analysis of the topography map for the as-sprayed film reveals an average surface roughness Rq (root mean squared) of 13–22 nm over a 300 μm × 230 μm surface. Following the 70 °C toluene soak, Rq was reduced by over 90% to 1.0–1.7 nm over a similar surface area.
Spectroscopic ellipsometry and device modeling
To accurately predict the photocurrent for an ultrathin SWCNT/C60 solar cell, it is necessary to understand the optical field distribution within the device. It is important to note that interference effects can lead to deviations of the EQE spectrum from the linear absorbance spectrum of the absorber layer. For example, Bindl et al. have demonstrated that adjusting the thickness of the C60 layer enables tuning the spectral regions of constructive and destructive interference.13 However, optical constants for highly enriched s-SWCNT samples are lacking in the experimental literature, beyond a recent paper on (6,5) SWCNTs enriched by density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU),31 making it difficult to accurately model the effects of changing the thickness of various layers on device photocurrent. To address this need, we characterized our (7,5) s-SWCNT thin films with spectroscopic ellipsometry to aid in the development of a full optical model of the bilayer PV device stack. Fig. 2a and b display the wavelength-dependent raw ellipsometry parameters, Δ and Ψ, obtained at three different angles for a ∼9 nm (as determined by absorbance/AFM) (7,5) s-SWCNT film. The spectra were successfully fit (red traces) with a Cauchy model, with the best fits corresponding to a film thickness of 9.3 nm, consistent with the thickness obtained through the correlation of absorbance and AFM data (Fig. 1). Fig. 2c displays the absorbance coefficient extracted from the modeled ellipsometry data, and Fig. 2d displays the extracted refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k). We note one important caveat for the optical constants displayed in Fig. 2. In contrast to SWCNTs enriched by DGU, our PFO-enriched (7,5) s-SWCNT films have ∼1% by weight PFO remaining bound to the SWCNTs in the film. The absorbance from this residual PFO produces features in the wavelength-dependent optical constants in the range of ∼350–400 nm that are not related to the (7,5) s-SWCNTs.

To model the thickness-dependent interference effects on EQE spectra, we utilize an optical model of the device stack that is parameterized with the complex index of refraction for each layer as calculated from spectroscopic ellipsometry data.23 Ellipsometry data for each layer were obtained experimentally at NREL and modeled with the multiphase model, as described above for the (7,5) s-SWCNT layer.23Fig. 3a shows a two-dimensional map of the predicted photocurrent as a function of SWCNT and C60 thickness for the device stack shown in the figure inset. The map in Fig. 3a was generated by assuming that each component of the absorber layer (SWCNT and C60) may be characterized by an exciton capture length, LC. Our model assumes that the percentage of photogenerated excitons reaching the interface to produce photocurrent (XJSC) decays exponentially with distance (d) from the interface as: XJSC ∝ e−(d/LC). The exciton capture length (LC) is related to the exciton diffusion length (LD) but likely exceeds LD since our simplified dependence of XJSC does not take into reflection of excitons at the outer boundaries of each layer.33 The map in Fig. 3a is generated with a SWCNT LC of 10 nm and a C60LC of 15 nm, in congruence with recent estimates of the singlet exciton diffusion length within C60 and s-SWCNT films, as well as the experimental JSC values of our own devices (vide infra). In particular, device and optical studies have estimated C60LD values of ∼7 nm,32–34 ∼10 nm,35 and ∼19 nm36 within similarly evaporated thin films. Preliminary studies of multi-chiral s-SWCNT/C60 PV devices suggest SWCNT LD values in the range of ∼8 nm as the mass ratio of wrapping polymer to s-SWCNTs approaches 1.3:1,25 whereas this value may increase for the monochiral devices with ∼1:1 PFO:SWCNT ratio studied here.
 Fig. 3  (a) Two-dimensional map of predicted JSC for devices with varying SWCNT and C60 layer thickness. Red line traces the maximum JSC. The model for panel (a) assumes a SWCNT LC of 10 nm and C60LC of 15 nm. Inset of panel (a) shows a schematic of the device stack used in this study. (b) and (c) display the distribution of optical field (solid lines) and absorption (dashed lines) for 1040 nm (red) and 465 nm (blue), as calculated by the optical model for (b) device with 10 nm (7,5) SWCNT layer and 30 nm C60 layer, and (c) devices with 10 nm (7,5) SWCNT layer and 78 nm C60 layer. In (b) and (c), the penetration distance into the cell begins at the ITO/PEDOT interface (280 nm). 
An obvious outcome from the model is that the photocurrent is optimized for the device geometry utilized in our study at a relatively thin C60 layer, that ranges from ∼29 nm to 32 nm (red trace in Fig. 3a), depending on the SWCNT thickness. The precise C60 thickness at which photocurrent is optimized will depend sensitively upon the electron and hole transport layers utilized in the device, and can vary for different device architectures. However, for the device architecture used here, which is a standard architecture for organic photovoltaics, Fig. 3a emphasizes the importance of producing extremely smooth SWCNT layers, as achieved through the ultrasonic spray process, so that thin acceptor layers can be utilized to optimize device performance without encountering significant failure rates (short circuiting) or fill factor losses (shunting).
It is important to note that the general shape of the map does not change significantly when modifying the C60 and s-SWCNT LC values. Whereas the magnitude of all JSC values within the map does increase by increasing the LC values, the optimum C60thickness is determined primarily by the wavelength-dependent optical field distribution within the device that results from constructive and destructive interference upon reflection from the silver cathode. To clarify this point, Fig. 3b and c display the calculated optical field and absorption as a function of optical penetration distance into two separate devices. Whereas both devices contain 10 nm (7,5) SWCNT films, the C60 thickness is either 30 nm (Fig. 3b) or 78 nm (Fig. 3c). The wavelengths displayed are representative of either the peak of the (7,5) S11 (1040 nm, red traces) or the visible peak of C60 absorption (465 nm, blue traces). For the device with 30 nm of C60, the peak of the 465 nm optical field is located within the C60 layer, ∼11 nm away from the SWCNT/C60 interface. Importantly, this places the optical field at a position closely matched to the range expected for the C60 singlet exciton diffusion length.32–36 The peak of the 1040 nm optical field is outside of the absorber layer, instead being maximized within the ITO layer (below 280 nm, not shown). Thus, this cell geometry should optimize absorption in the visible portion of the spectrum within the C60 layer. In contrast, for the device with 78 nm of C60, a local maximum of the 465 nm optical field is still located within the C60 layer, but it is ∼60 nm away from the SWCNT/C60 interface, well outside the expected C60 singlet LD. The 1040 nm optical field, however, is near its maximum within the (7,5) SWCNT layer. Thus, this cell geometry should optimize absorption in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum within the SWCNT layer. Consequently, the photocurrent produced by each device depends on the integral of the resulting EQE spectrum with the AM1.5 solar spectrum.
(7,5) SWCNT/C60 solar cells by ultrasonic spraying
To test the utility of the ultrasonic spraying method and the accuracy of our optical model, we prepared a series of bilayer SWCNT PV devices with ∼10–14 nm (7,5) thin films sprayed by ultrasonic spraying. Fig. 4a shows dark and light J–V curves for a device prepared with a ∼10 nm thick (7,5) s-SWCNT layer and a ∼78 nm thick C60 layer. The device demonstrated a short-circuit current (JSC) of 2.35 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.44 V, a fill factor (FF) of 58%, and a power conversion efficiency (ηPCE) of 0.61%. At approximately −0.2 V, the device displays an onset of reverse bias leakage current. While the open circuit voltages of the sprayed devices evinced variation between sprayed devices, overall these devices achieved a maximum VOC of 0.46 V, significantly greater than the max VOC previously reported for similar doctor-bladed devices (0.38 V).3 In contrast to previous SWCNT PV devices,3,8,13 we find that a hole transport layer (PEDOT:PSS for this study) is necessary to rectify the current flow in our spray-coated devices. We hypothesize that this hole transport layer may contribute to the higher VOC, but further measurements are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. The J–V characteristics were also measured with a 610 nm long pass (LP) filter to quantify the SWCNT contribution. The S11 and S22 transitions of (7,5) carbon nanotubes occur at 1044 nm and 653 nm respectively, while C60 absorbs around 330 nm, with a prominent shoulder at ∼465 nm. With the 610 LP filter in place, the JSC was reduced to 44% of the unfiltered current density, indicating that the SWCNTs provide a substantial portion of the photocurrent in our devices.

(b) EQE spectrum of the device in panel (b), overlaid with the absorbance spectra of the neat SWCNT and bilayer films. 
The EQE spectrum of this device (Fig. 4b) matches the salient features of the absorbance spectrum very well over the entire visible and NIR range. In particular, the spectral shapes, energies, and linewidths of the (7,5) excitonic and vibronic peaks are conserved in the EQE spectrum. As seen by a comparison of the absorbance spectrum of the film to its EQE spectrum in Fig. 3c, the NIR EQE maximum of 23% occurs precisely at the S11 transition (1044 nm). Using the AM1.5 G solar irradiance spectrum and the EQE shown in Fig. 3c, the expected JSC was calculated. The EQE-predicted JSC (2.64 mA cm−2) is within 13% of the JSC measured at AM1.5 G (2.35 mA cm−2, Fig. 3). Fig. S2† compares the EQE-calculated JSC and the JSC measured by the solar simulator for a number of different devices. The EQE values are all within 16% of the measured JSC but more often overestimate than underestimate the current. The slight overestimation of the EQE-calculated JSC for most devices likely arises from the fact that the EQE spectra measured here are not DC light-biased, and are thus measured at significantly lower photon fluxes than used in the AM1.5 solar simulator. Fig. S3† demonstrates a slight sub-linear dependence on JSC with photon flux, which would contribute to an overestimation of integrated JSC from EQE spectra.
Correlation of predicted and experimental JSC and EQE
The relative weighting of absorption features in the EQE spectrum (Fig. 4b) is tied directly to the optical field distribution within this device (Fig. 3c). For example, although a small peak in the EQE is seen at the S22 transition wavelength (653 nm), the ratio of EQE for S11 and S22 excitation is heavily biased towards the S11 due to a maximum in the optical field in the SWCNT layer for 1040 nm (Fig. 3c) and a minimum for 650 nm (not shown in Fig. 3c). Since the wavelength-dependent optical field is a sensitive function of the thickness of each layer, we explored interference effects further by systematically varying the C60 layer thickness. Fig. 5a and b display J–V curves and EQE spectra, respectively, for devices prepared with 10–14 nm s-SWCNT thickness and with C60 thicknesses of approximately 30, 50, 70, and 80 nm. As shown in Fig. 5a and tabulated in Table 1, the device with ∼30 nm C60 displayed the maximum current density (3.93 mA cm−2) of all our devices, with a fill factor of 54%. The current density, averaged over many devices for each C60 thickness, increased with decreasing C60 layer thickness, reaching a maximum at 32 nm C60 thickness, in agreement with the behavior predicted by Fig. 3a.

The dependence of JSC on C60 thickness results from systematic variations of the EQE spectra of these devices (Fig. 5b), which modify the contributions of the SWCNT and C60 layers, as summarized in Table 2. Consequently, the photocurrent produced by each device depends on the integral of the resulting EQE spectrum with the AM1.5 solar spectrum. Fig. 5c shows the EQE spectra predicted by our optical model for each of the solar cells shown in Fig. 5a and b. Similar to the photocurrent map in Fig. 3a, the spectra in Fig. 5c were generated by assuming a characteristic exciton capture length, LC, within both the (7,5) SWCNT and C60 layers. The best fits to the experimental EQE data were obtained with an LC value of ∼15 nm for excitons in the C60 layer and LC values in the range of ∼5–25 nm for excitons in the SWCNT layer. The fits in Fig. 5c are all generated with LC = 15 nm for the SWCNT layer. The most significant deviations between the predicted and measured EQE spectra occur in the range of 300–500 nm. These deviations likely arise from (1) artificial contributions of PFO spectral features to the (7,5) optical constants, discussed above, and (2) errors in the optical constants of ITO in this region, where reflections from the ITO produce interference fringes. Modeling of the patterned ITO layer used in our devices produces some unavoidable error, due to the experimental spot size for the ellipsometry measurement slightly exceeding the size of the patterned ITO pads. Despite slight deviations, the model accurately reconstructs the overall shapes of the EQE spectra in both the visible and NIR, accounting for the observed contributions of the s-SWCNT layer and C60 layer to the photocurrent as a function of C60 thickness.

Fig. 5d compares the experimentally measured JSC values to predicted JSC values as a function of C60 thickness. In Fig. 5d, we assume a SWCNT layer thickness of 13 nm, in line with the average thickness of the experimentally studied films, and a C60LC of 15 nm. The three solid traces display the predicted JSC for three different SWCNT LC values: 5 nm, 15 nm, and 25 nm. The experimental data all fall within the bounds set by this range of LC values, with most values falling between LC = 5 nm and LC = 15 nm. These LC values compare well with recent estimates of the singlet exciton diffusion length within C6032–36 and s-SWCNT films,13,25 lending credence to our optical model. For the 25 nm SWCNT LC case, the individual contributions of the SWCNT and C60 layers are broken out as the dashed and dash-dotted traces, respectively. These traces afford a convenient visualization of how the relative contributions of s-SWCNTs and fullerenes can be finely tuned through optical interferences within the device stack, and provide a robust route for predictive tuning of SWCNT PV solar capture. As summarized in Table 2, the relative contributions of the SWCNTs and C60 predicted by our model align well with the values determined experimentally.
Discussion
Although still in the early stages of development, thin films of highly enriched s-SWCNTs hold promise for a number of different opto-electronic devices, including photovoltaics, detectors, field-effect transistors, and photonic elements. Progress towards reliable high efficiency devices benefits from the development of fabrication methodologies that are scalable, reproducible, and produce smooth, uniform films. The ultrasonic spraying process developed here results in highly uniform PFO-wrapped s-SWCNT thin films with very low surface roughness, enabling bilayer PV devices with very thin C60 layers. The device with ∼30 nm C60 layer thickness utilizes the thinnest C60 layer reported for a s-SWCNT/fullerene bilayer solar cell. In previous device studies, the SWCNT layer has been deposited by iterative doctor-blading,3 spin-coating14 and vacuum filtration.15 Typically, spin-coating and vacuum filtration produce SWCNT films with significant roughness, necessitating thick C60 layers to avoid shunting and short-circuited bilayer PV devices.14,15 These thick C60 layers may be problematic for several reasons in bilayer devices. First, as demonstrated here and in previous studies,32–36 the singlet exciton diffusion length within C60 films is relatively short (e.g. 7–19 nm). Thus, C60 layers significantly thicker than ∼20 nm incorporate appreciable material in excess of what is needed to generate photocurrent from that layer. Second, the electron mobility is relatively low in C60, so thicker layers may increase device series resistance. Finally, the reduced visible transmittance of thick C60 layers precludes the devices from being exploited in niche applications, such as semi-transparent solar cells for BIPV. While doctor-bladed films tend to be quite smooth and produce devices with good fill factors,3 it isn't clear that this deposition strategy would be scalable for high throughput fabrication of thin SWCNT films (i.e. tens of nanometers) with thicknesses that could be controlled with high precision (i.e. ± a few nanometers). While techniques such as doctor blading, slot dye, and Gravure coating are generally scalable, they are typically preferred for thin-film applications requiring high-viscosity inks and film thicknesses ranging from hundreds of nanometers to microns.29
As shown here, the (7,5) s-SWCNT/C60 bilayer solar cell provides a useful model system for testing a multiphase optical model that can successfully reconstruct EQE spectra by incorporating the complex index of refraction for each layer within the device. The optical model produces several insights for thin-film SWCNT devices that may aid in predictive fabrication strategies of future devices. The successful reproduction of EQE spectra relies upon the assumption of upper limits to the singlet exciton diffusion lengths of ∼15 nm within each layer. The model also suggests device geometries that optimize JSC in particular regions of the solar spectrum, informing optimization strategies for particular devices. For example, the model suggests that efficient near-infrared photodetectors require C60 thicknesses in the range of ∼80–90 nm. In contrast, PV devices are optimized at significantly thinner C60 layers (∼30 nm), which maximize the photon density absorbed in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Further spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements of s-SWCNT thin films enriched in other chiralities will aid in the application of this model to a plethora of SWCNT devices with tunable solar capture.
The strong performance of our devices with ∼32 nm C60 indicates that our ultrasonic spray method of depositing the s-SWCNT absorber layer produces the smooth and uniform films that are necessary to enable ultra-thin devices. Interestingly, the fabrication of bilayer s-SWCNT/C60 devices with ultra-thin (e.g. 20–40 nm) acceptor layers opens up the possibility for semi-transparent solar cells. For example, not including the back silver electrode for the device produced with 30 nm of C60, the entire device thickness would only be ∼100 nm (which includes the PEDOT and BCP layers). If a transparent low work function electrode, such as an n-type graphene37 or SWCNT38 thin film, were used in place of silver, the visible transmittance of this device would be in the range of ∼70%. Such devices could serve as building-integrated photovoltaic windows, reducing infrared transmittance (low emissivity) and providing power while still allowing significant visible transmittance.
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a scalable method for spray-coating polyfluorene-wrapped s-SWCNTs that produces films with prescribed thicknesses that are smooth and uniform enough to make strongly rectifying, high-performance devices with a C60 layer as thin as 30 nm, difficult metrics to meet with other SWCNT thin-film deposition techniques. The ultrasonic spraying technique developed here, which is optimized for low-viscosity highly pure s-SWCNT inks in organic solvents, could enable advances not only in SWCNT solar cells, but also in other emerging technologies such as vertical field effect transistors39,40 and light-emitting diodes incorporating s-SWCNT injection layers.41,42 Furthermore, we have refined an optical model for our devices that accurately predicts the current density and relative contributions of the C60 and SWCNT layers to the external quantum efficiency. Combining our optical model and high-precision spray deposition technique, we have the potential to tune the active layer thickness to optimize current extraction for a wide array of device geometries, all within a highly scalable deposition process. Such control enables strategies for the rational optimization of SWCNT/C60 bilayer heterojunctions for an assortment of applications including, PV, BIPV, and photodetectors.
