    , Accepted 28th February 2019First published on 1st March 2019AbstractA cyclopentadithiophene (DTC)-bridged acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backboned small molecule acceptor (SMA), namely IDTC-4Cl, was designed and synthesized. In combination with strong electron-withdrawing (5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene)dimalononitrile as a terminal group, IDTC-4Cl exhibits a near-infrared light absorption with an edge over 900 nm. Using PBDB-T as the polymer donor, the IDTC-4Cl based device gives a PCE of 9.51% with a Voc of 0.822 V, FF of 60.2% and Jsc of 19.14 mA cm−2. Upon introduction of PC71BM as the third component, the ternary OSCs show an enhanced PCE of 10.41% with a much improved FF of 65.6%, which exemplifies the potential of utilizing a DTC unit to construct an SMA for high-performance organic photovoltaics.
Introductions
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received tremendous attention in the last few decades for their great potential advantages of solution processibility, light weight, low cost and easy large area fabrication.1–4 Recently, owing to the rapid development of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) along with morphology control and device engineering, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction and double junctions OSCs have been boosted to over 14% and 17%, respectively.5–10 Compared with the broad absorption spectrum within 1100 nm of single crystal silicon solar cells, the OSCs have a poor spectral response in this region.11,12 Thus, organic semiconductors with a broad light absorption band in the vis-infrared (NIR) region are considered to harvest more solar photons to generate a high photocurrent, and, as a result, may contribute to an overall enhanced efficiency for OSCs.4 Therefore, the design and synthesis of NIR materials with a narrow-bandgap (NBG) is expected to further enhance the performance of organic photovoltaics.
Among the most successful NF-SMAs, almost all contain a planar acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone architecture, which is beneficial for fine-tuning energy levels, light absorption and enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect.13–16 The most commonly reported highly efficient non-fullerene OSCs have limited photo-response coverage within 850 nm, using indacenodithiophene (IDT), indacenodithieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (IDTT) fluorenedicyclopentathiophene and heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) based NF-SMAs.17–25 As such, further extending the spectral response in the NIR/IR region of OSCs is of great significance and interest for the design of NBG NF-SMAs for highly efficient OSCs. With these, there are some successful extreme-NBG SMA based OSCs with PCEs over 10%.26–29
Considering the requirements for NF-OSCs and pioneering works aforementioned, we envisioned that further extending an IDT core linked by more thiophene units together with using stronger electron-withdrawing end-groups may be a good choice for the design and synthesis of NBG NF-SMA materials. There are many successful NF-SMAs with good photovoltaic performance by utilization of IDT as the central donor core, such as IEIC, IEICO, IDTBR, IDT-2BR, ATT-1 and many analogues.27,29–38 Furthermore, a cyclopentadithiophene (DTC) unit is of great interest for its suitable thiophene number and bulky substituents attached on the sp3 carbon atoms. Recently, Chen et al. reported a DTC based unfused NF-SMA DF-PCIC for highly efficient OSCs, which proved that it is feasible to use DTC as a building block for constructing SMAs.39,40 Side chains attached on the sp3-carbon of IDT and DTC units together could guarantee avoiding strong intermolecular aggregation for achieving suitable phase separation domains and purity. Meanwhile, strong electron-withdrawing end-groups may contribute to favorable π–π stacking and enhanced intermolecular charge transfer.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a new NF-SMA, 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9-tris(4-hexylphenyl)-9-(4-pentylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6b]-dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4-bis(2-octyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-6,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDTC-4Cl), which possessed a narrow bandgap of 1.35 eV and effective light absorption from 700 to 900 nm in the near and far infrared regions. IDTC-4Cl employs IDT as the central core bridged by two cyclopentadithiophene (DTC) units and ends capped by two same strong electron-withdrawing terminal groups (5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene)dimalononitrile (IC-2Cl), which could effectively decrease the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, increase the molecular crystallinity and enhance the charge transfer. From the perspectives of the energy levels and the light absorption of IDTC-4Cl, a medium bandgap polymer, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-alt-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) was chosen as the electron donor to fabricate the OSC device with a complementary absorption in the visible and NIR regions. The PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl based device delivered a PCE of 9.5%. In order to further elevate the photovoltaic performance, phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl ester (PC71BM) was chosen as the third component to fabricate the OSC device. As expected, this ternary strategy gave an increased PCE of 10.41% and a low energy loss of 0.527 eV, together with a significant elevated FF from 60.2% to 65.2%, and an almost unchanged Jsc of 19.14 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.829 eV.
Synthesis and characterizations
The synthetic route of IDTC-4Cl is shown in Fig. 2, and the detailed synthesis procedures and characterization data are given in theESI.† The Stille cross-coupling reaction between commercially available (4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) and 6-bromo-4,4-dioctyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-2-carboxaldehyde, could generate an important intermediate dialdehyde IDTC-2CHO directly. The desired molecule IDTC-4Cl was then obtained by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction with IC-2Cl in a decent yield of 80%. IDTC-4Cl was fully characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, and high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS MALDI) as shown in the ESI.† Since IDTC-4Cl has eight side chains, it shows a very good solubility in common organic solvents (dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene). It should also be noticed that the eight bulky side chains can effectively avoid over strong aggregation in the solid state for an optimal morphology. IDTC-4Cl exhibited a decomposition temperature (Td) of 370 °C with 5% weight loss determined from thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves (Fig. S1, ESI†), guaranteeing its good enough thermal stability for device fabrication.
Optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 1d, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectrum of IDTC-4Cl in a diluted CHCl3 solution shows a major absorption peak at 780 nm, which shifts to 807 nm for the thin-film absorption of IDTC-4Cl, corresponding to a 27 nm bathochromic-shift compared with that of its chloroform solution, indicating a more-ordered structure and strong π–π intermolecular interaction in the thin film. Combining with the absorption of PBDB-T in the range of 450–700 nm, IDTC-4Cl exhibits a complementary absorption in the range of 700–910 nm which may favor complete harvesting of solar photons from the visible light to the NIR/IR region. The Eoptg of IDTC-4Cl, calculated from its absorption onset of 914 nm, is as low as 1.35 eV. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of blend films based on IDTC-4Cl:PBDB-T binary and IDTC-4Cl:PBDB-T:PC71BM ternary OSCs are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

The energy levels of IDTC-4Cl were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) referenced to the energy level of Fc/Fc+ (−4.8 eV below the vacuum level) in thin films (Fig. S3, ESI†). As is shown in Fig. 1c, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of IDTC-4Cl are −5.50 and −3.79 eV, respectively. The comparatively high HOMO level and low LUMO level are predominantly caused by the introduction of DTC as bridge units and IC-2Cl as ending groups, respectively. The absorption and CV investigations together prove it a promising strategy to decrease the Eoptg. Besides, the energy levels of PBDB-T, IDTC-4Cl and PC71BM exhibit cascade alignments, which can facilitate charge transport from donors to acceptors efficiently.
Density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations were employed to evaluate the optimal molecular geometry and the frontier molecular orbitals. The optimized geometric structures (top-view and side-view) and the electron-state-density distributions in the molecular orbitals (LUMO and HOMO) are shown in Fig. 3a and b, demonstrating an almost planar molecular backbone with a dihedral angle of 0.15° between the central IDT core and the DTC unit, which would facilitate efficient charge transfer. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDTC-4Cl are −5.16 and −3.37 eV, respectively.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of IDTC-4Cl, solution-processed OSCs were fabricated with the conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:acceptors/PDINO/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PDINO represents poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene):poly(styrenesulfonate) and perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide, respectively. PDINO was selected as the cathode interlayer for effectively alleviating the interfacial energy barriers and electron extraction ability.41 After systematic optimization of the OSC devices, by utilizing chlorobenezne as the processing solvent, the optimal donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio for all blends is 1:1, and a tiny amount of 1-chloronapthalene (CN, 0.5% volume) was selected as the solvent additive to ameliorate the morphology. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 4a, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Accordingly, the PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl based device achieved a Voc of 0.822 V and a Jsc of 19.14 mA cm−2. The energy loss (Eloss), defined as Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc (where Eoptg refers to the optical band gap of IDTC-4Cl), is as low as 0.535 eV. Note that while the photovoltaic performance of a binary system exhibits an overall PCE of 9.51%, its performance is limited by a low FF of 60.2%. In order to purse a better morphology and maintain its Voc/low Eloss and Jsc, we chose PC71BM as the third component for the PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl system to construct ternary organic solar cells. By fixing the weight ratio of D:A as 1:1, we altered the PC71BM and IDTC-4Cl dosage (Table S1, ESI†). In comparison with the binary cells, the optimized PC71BM:PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl (1:0.8:0.2) ternary device delivered an elevated FF from 60.2% to 65.6% and resulted in an overall better PCE of 10.41%, ascribing from the cascade alignment of their energy levels for more efficient charge transport. Meanwhile, in the optimal ternary OSCs, the Voc and Jsc remained almost unchanged, and the Eloss further decreased to 0.527 eV simultaneously.

From the external-quantum-efficiency (EQE) curves of the binary and ternary devices as shown in Fig. 4b, the IDTC-4Cl based binary and ternary OSCs both covered wide photo-current responses from 300 to 900 nm, mainly owing to the complementary absorption of a wide bandgap of PBDB-T in the visible region and the NBG acceptor in the NIR spectra. The integrated current densities for the PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl and ternary devices are 18.07 and 18.40 mA cm−2, respectively, both of which are closely to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.
The charge transport properties were examined by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method using electron-only and hole-only devices, respectively. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the electron mobility of the neat IDTC-4Cl film was measured to be 2.84 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1. The calculated electron and hole mobilities for the PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl based device are 2.54 × 10−4 and 1.62 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After adding PC71BM, the ternary blend obtained higher electron (2.95 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) and hole (1.76 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) mobilities simultaneously, in support of its higher FF compared with that of the binary device. Using PC71BM as a combinatory acceptor, the enhanced electron and hole mobilities may be caused due to several factors: (1) the cascade level energy alignments for more efficient charge transfer (more charge transfer channels); (2) the more ameliorative morphology with suitable domain size (as shown in TEM images of Fig. 6c and d).
The plots of photocurrent (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) curves were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties in the binary and ternary devices, respectively (Fig. 5a).42,43Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under illumination and JD is the current density in the darkness. Veff = Vo − Va, where Va is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph is zero. As depicted, when Veff exceeds over 1.5 V, the Jph values for the two devices reach saturation (Jsat), indicating a minimal charge recombination at a higher voltage. The exciton dissociation probability P(E, T) in the working devices could be estimated by calculating the value of Jph/Jsat, where E and T represent the field and temperature respectively. Under the condition of short-circuit current, the P(E, T) values are 95.1% and 94.2% for binary and ternary based devices, respectively, suggesting that the overall exciton dissociation and the charge collection processes are all quite efficient.

The light-intensity (Plight) dependence of Jsc was measured to further investigate the charge recombination properties in the devices (Fig. 5b). The power-law dependence between Jsc and Plight was described as Jsc/Pαlight. The small deviation of the α value close to 1 indicates a weak bimolecular recombination. As seen, the α value for the binary and ternary devices are 0.98 and 0.99, respectively, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is efficiently suppressed in both the devices based on IDTC-4Cl.
In order to understand more about the recombination mechanism in the optimized devices, the dependence of Voc on Plight was examined (Fig. 5c).44,45 The slope of Vocversus Plight helps to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the working devices. A slope at kBT/q implies that the bimolecular recombination mechanism is dominant, where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge. As for trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, a stronger dependence of Voc on light intensity with a slope of 2 kBT/q is observed. As depicted, the slopes for the binary and ternary device based on IDTC-4Care at 1.91 and 1.59 kBT/q, implying that the recombination at open circuit in these devices is a combination of monomolecular (SRH) and bimolecular processes.
Morphology characterization
To explore the morphological difference of a binary and ternary system, detailed investigations of the blend films were conducted by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to evaluate the OPV perormance. As shown in Fig. 6a, the binary PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl blend film exhibited good miscibility of the donor and acceptor components, with a root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 2.41 nm. After adding the third component PC71BM (Fig. 6b), the ternary blend film showed a smoother surface with a Rq of 1.87 nm. The smoother and more uniform surface morphology of the ternary blend film, to certain extent, may favor for a modified contact between the electrode and the active layer. Compared with the PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl blend film, the PBDB-T:IDTC-4Cl:PC71BM exhibited more defined fibrous and bi-continuous grain-like domains with appropriate size in the TEM images (Fig. 6c and d), benefitting charge carrier generation and transportation, which further accounts for the improved FF and thereby an enhanced performance of ternary OSCs.46–48

Conclusions
In summary, a cyclopentadithiophene-bridged A–D–A backboned SMA was designed and synthesized. Upon introduction of a DTC π-bridge along with a strong electron withdrawing end-group IC-2Cl, BDTC-4Cl exhibits a bandgap as low as 1.35 eV with near-infrared light absorption. In combination with PBDB-T as the polymer donor, the IDTC-4Cl based device gives a PCE of 9.51% with a Voc of 0.822 V, FF of 60.2% and Jsc of 19.14 mA cm−2. Upon introducing PC71BM as the third component, the ternary OSCs show an enhanced PCE of 10.41% with a much improved FF of 65.6% and slightly changed Voc and Jsc. Considering the EQE response in a wide region of 300–900 nm, the introduction of a DTC unit in combination with the IC-2Cl terminal group, is a promising strategy to construct high performance SMAs with near-infrared light absorption.
