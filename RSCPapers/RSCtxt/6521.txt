    , Accepted 4th February 2015First published on 5th February 2015AbstractSix new heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes (MC118, MC120–123 and MC126), of general formula Ru(L1)(L2)(NCS)2, where L1 and L2 are respectively dicarboxylated and π-conjugated functionalized (dissymmetric) bipyridine ligands, were designed, synthesized and applied as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells. These complexes were characterized both experimentally and theoretically, showing promising optical properties, with higher extinction coefficients compared to the prototypical N719 dye. When employed in working devices, in combination with a liquid I−/I3− redox electrolyte, the investigated sensitizers have shown power conversion efficiencies between 6.0 and 8.0%, comparable with the reference N719 dye tested under similar fabrication and evaluation conditions.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1–5 represent a promising alternative to conventional silicon-based photovoltaic technology, providing high photon-to-current conversion efficiency with possibly reduced fabrication costs. A typical DSC consists of four main components: (i) a mesoporous semiconductor layer (usually TiO2 anatase), (ii) a dye sensitizer, (iii) a redox electrolyte (typically I−/I3− or cobalt complexes) and (iv) a catalyst deposited on the counter electrode. Upon photoexcitation, the sensitizer promotes the electron injection in the TiO2 conduction band (CB). The oxidized dye is regenerated by the electrolyte, and finally the circuit is closed at the counter electrode where the reduction of the oxidized mediator occurs. Undoubtedly the dye represents the key component to achieve optimal photovoltaic performances. Highest power conversion efficiency of 13% has been reached with a combination of a porphyrin sensitizer and the Co bipyridine ([Co(bpy)3]2+/3+) redox couple.6 Very recently, perovskite hybrid absorbers (MAPbI3, where MA = methylammonium, or other derivatives) have provided impressive conversion yields of over 19% in solid state devices.7,8
Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, the first and the most extensively investigated class of dyes for DSC applications, have shown record efficiencies exceeding 11%.9–12 Since the development of the prototypical ruthenium sensitizers, N313(Ru(II)(dcbpy)2(NCS)2) (dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridyl ligand), and its double deprotonated tetrabutylammonium salt, N719,9,14 showing excellent photovoltaic performances, many research groups have attempted to functionalize this structure in order to improve the light-harvesting ability, the charge transfer efficiency and the long term stability of the complex.15 A major research line has been devoted to synthesize heteroleptic dyes, in which one of the equivalent bipyridine ligands of N3 or N719 is specifically functionalized to obtain improved DSC devices, mainly in terms of increased performances.16 In this way it was also possible to synthesize dyes with higher stability toward water-induced desorption from TiO2, by inserting long alkyl chains, and with improved light absorption properties, through the introduction of π-conjugated groups.11,12,17–25 Other design strategies, consisting in the partial or full substitution of the thiocyanate ligands, considered the most instable part of the molecule,26–28 recently allowed further improvements, both in terms of stability and efficiency.29–32
Heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers generally show comparable or slightly lower efficiencies with respect to the reference N719 dye, due to an increased photocurrent and lower photovoltage values.19–21,33–35 The increase in the photocurrent can be easily explained on the basis of the improved light harvesting properties. The generally observed decrease of the photovoltage is instead related to the adsorption geometry of the dyes, influencing the TiO2 CB edge position due to the establishment of a dipolar field on the semiconductor surface33,36 and the electron transfer from the sensitizer to the semiconductor upon adsorption.37,38 Furthermore it is expected that homoleptic dyes can form a compact monolayer on the TiO2 surface, possibly contributing to prevent electron recombination toward the oxidized electrolyte.39 These findings suggest that the three carboxylic anchoring to TiO2, as characteristic for N3/N719 dyes, are essential to obtain high open circuit potentials. Therefore it is highly desirable to design new dyes which combine the interfacial features of homoleptic dyes with the increased light-harvesting capability of heteroleptic complexes. Recently some of us proposed a new promising design approach, which involves the use of a dissymmetric bipyridine ligand, where the 4 and 4′ positions of a bipyridine are substituted with an anchoring group and a π-conjugated electron rich moiety, respectively.39–41 If the dye effectively bind to the TiO2 with three carboxylic groups it could be possible to preserve the advantages of the homoleptic dyes, yet allowing for tunable optimization of the optical properties. As expected, improved optical properties were obtained, and Voc values comparable with the prototypical N719 dye, even if the overall efficiency was still lower than the reference. Furthermore, remarkable stability has been obtained by adopting this design concept.39
The six novel heteroleptic ruthenium complexes reported in this paper, to be used as sensitizers in DSCs, are characterized by the general formula Ru(L1)(L2)(NCS)2 (Scheme 1). For the MC118 and MC120–123 series, L1 ligand is 4-4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine, and L2 is a symmetric bipyridine, substituted in 4 and 4′ positions with two π-conjugated electron-rich groups. In particular, octyloxy groups at ortho positions of the meso phenyl ring on the YD2-o-C8 dye resulted in high Voc.42 The indole43 and indoline44 moieties incorporated in metal free organic dyes improved overall DSC efficiencies. Incorporation of electron rich heteroaromatic rings45 and dialkyl fluorene46 moieties for elongation of conjugation into the sensitizer molecules also has been demonstrated to improve the efficiencies of the DSCs. The efficacy of these functionalities in heteroleptic ruthenium complexes for DSC applications was then tested. In order to further investigate the three anchoring sites approach, the MC126 dye is instead characterized by a dissymmetric L2 ligand, bearing a phenyl-cyanoacrylic acceptor binding moiety, and a hexylthiophene fragment to increase the dye's molar extinction coefficient. For all the complexes we introduced long alkyl chains on the L2 ligand structure, with the multiple aims to reduce the dye aggregation on the semiconductor surface, and to suppress the back electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized redox shuttle in the electrolyte, thus forming a compact insulating layer over the adsorbed dye molecules.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The MC118, MC120–123 ruthenium sensitizers, which incorporate 1,3-bis(octyloxy)benzene-, 1-hexyl-1H-indole-, 4-hexyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indole-, 9,9-didecyl-9H-fluorene- and 9-hexyl-9H-carbazole-substituted bipyridine as the ancillary ligand, respectively, were synthesized by the stepwise synthetic protocol illustrated in Scheme 2. The commercially available starting materials 2-bromobenzene-1,3-diol, 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1H-indole, 7-bromo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indole, 2-bromo-9H-fluorene and 3-bromo-9H-carbazole were subjected to O-alkylation/N-alkylation under basic conditions in DMF to afford the corresponding alkylated products 2-bromo-1,3-bis(octyloxy)benzene (1), 5-bromo-1-hexyl-1H-indole (3), 7-bromo-4-hexyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indole (4), 2-bromo-9,9-didecyl-9H-fluorene (6) and 3-bromo-9-hexyl-9H-carbazole (8) respectively in good yields (80–83%). Specifically, O-alkylated product 1 was borylated using n-BuLi and trimethyl borate to give 2,6-bis(octyloxy)phenylboronic acid (2) in 79% yield, whereas, N-alkylated products 4, 6 and 8 were treated with bis(pinacolato)diboron using Pd(0) to accomplish the respective boronic esters 4-hexyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)cyclopenta[b]indole (5), 2-(9,9-didecyl-9H-fluoren-7-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (7) and 9-hexyl-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (9) in reasonable yield (78–82%). The desired disubstituted bipyridine ancillary ligands L1–L5 were obtained from the corresponding boronic acid/esters and 4,4′-dibromobipyridine by Pd(II) catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction. The Ru sensitizers were synthesized in a typical one-pot synthesis47,48 from the reaction of the Ru dimer [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 with each of ancillary ligands L1–L5 followed by the reaction with the anchoring ligand 4,4′-dicarboxylbipyridine (dcbpy) and the subsequent reaction with an excess amount of ammonium thiocyanate to afford the desired products.

Scheme 3 depicts the synthetic route for MC126. The commercially available starting material 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine was subjected to mono coupling49,50 with hexylthiophene boronic acid under palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction conditions in DMF to afford compound 10 in reasonable yield (55%). Compound 10 was further subjected to Suzuki coupling with 4-formylphenylboronic acid, using palladium catalyst in DME to get unsymmetrical bipyridine intermediate 11 in good yield (73%). The unsymmetrical bipyridine ligand 12 was obtained by a Knoevenagel reaction employing compound 11 with cyanoacetic acid using ammonium acetate as a base. The ruthenium complex MC126, was synthesized by sequential one pot synthesis from the reaction of ruthenium dimer [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 with bipyridine ligand 12 in DMF medium, followed by the addition of 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine to the reaction mixture. Subsequently excess of ammonium thiocyanate was added to the above mixture to replace the two chlorines in the complex.

Regarding the electrochemical properties, the first oxidation potential (Eoxd) for all the investigated dyes is found in a range between 0.75 and 0.85 V vs. SCE. The regeneration of oxidized molecules by the redox shuttle should be thus energetically favored because the values of oxidation potential is more positive than I−/I3− redox potential.51 The excited state oxidation potentials (E*oxd) were estimated from the ground state oxidation potentials and the lowest adiabatic transition energies, E0–0 (Table 1), which are obtained from the intersection between the absorption and emission spectra (see ESI†). All these values are sufficiently more negative than the TiO2 CB edge,51 suggesting that the electron injection from excited dye molecules to TiO2 could be possible.
In Fig. 1 the comparison between the calculated and experimental absorption spectra in DMF solution is reported. A detailed list of the calculated transition energies for all the compounds is reported in the ESI.†
 Fig. 1  Comparison between experimental (blue lines) and calculated (red lines) UV-Vis absorption spectra of the MC dyes in DMF solution. Red vertical lines represent the calculated excitation energies. 
All the complexes show an absorption spectrum qualitatively similar to the reference N719 dye (535/1.47 × 104, 395/1.43 × 104, 312/4.91 × 104, nm/M−1 cm−1).14 Three absorption bands are present in the UV-Visible range, centered at about 530 nm, 380 nm and 300 nm. MC118, MC120 and MC121 dyes show the lowest energy absorption bands in the visible range at 528 nm. Moving to MC122/123 dyes, a slight red-shift of the first absorption band was found (538 and 531 nm respectively) due to the higher conjugation of the substituents on the bipyridine ligand. A further shift towards lower energies was obtained for MC126 (545 nm), due to the stabilization of the LUMO, delocalized over the L2 bipyridine and the phenyl cyanoacrylic substituent (Fig. 2), reducing the band gap. It is noteworthy that according to the design concept of heteroleptic ruthenium dyes,18 the chemical modification of the L2 ligand through the addition of electron rich moieties produces an increase of the ε values, with respect to the prototypical N719 dye, for all the investigated complexes (Table 1).
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the energy levels of the investigated MC complexes. Isodensity surface plots (isodensity contour: 0.035) of HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals are also shown. 
The calculated absorption spectra well reproduce the experimental ones, with a slight blue shift of less than 0.15 eV for the lowest absorption band. This discrepancy can depend on the protonation of the complexes in solution, that is known to shift the λmax toward lower energies,14,52 while we have simulated the fully deprotonated complexes. For MC126 dye we noted a higher discrepancy (0.31 eV) of the calculated absorption maximum with respect to the experimental one. In any case we also computed a transition at 549 nm, essentially coincident to the experimental maximum.
For all the investigated complexes we assign the main transition in the visible region as MLCT, while the other two bands in the UV range are π–π* transitions. In Fig. 2 we report a plot of the main orbitals involved in the first optical transition, along with their energy levels. The set of quasi-degenerate HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 have essentially Ru t2g character mixed to NCS, and are essentially isoenergetic along the series of the dyes. The LUMOs are bipyridine π* orbitals: LUMO is localized on the L2 bipyridine ligand, while the LUMO+1 on the dicarboxylated pyridine ligand L1 (see also ESI†). Along the series we can see as the LUMO+1 orbitals are isoenergetic, while the LUMO levels depend on the conjugated electron-rich groups on the bipyridine. A detailed list of the calculated energy levels is reported in ESI.†
2.3 Photovoltaic characterization
In Table 2 the photovoltaic data for all the sensitizers are summarized, compared with the reference N719 sensitizer, while in Fig. 3 the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the most efficient devices are shown. Two experimental conditions were tested, with and without the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) coadsorbent in the dye solution.

The newly synthesized complexes present comparable efficiencies with the reference N719. By using the prototypical N719 dye, top efficiencies have been measured without the CDCA, while almost all the heteroleptic sensitizers are positively affected by the presence of a coadsorbent in the dye bath. This is probably due to the multiple effects of preventing the dye aggregation53–55 and reducing the undesired back electron recombination reactions.56,57 Notably, MC118 and MC122 dyes are less sensitive to the use of CDCA, compared to the other sensitizers, due to the presence of multiple and long alkyl chains (octyloxy and decyl, respectively). These substituents, as previously demonstrated, are able to promote an optimal dye-packing on the semiconductor surface, limiting back recombination processes.21,42,58,59 Consistently, with these sensitizers remarkable photovoltages have been measured, comparable (for MC122, 713 mV) or even higher (for MC118, 760 mV) with respect to the reference N719 (730 mV), leading for MC118 dye to an overall efficiency of 7.9%. MC118 and MC122 are the best performing dyes also in the absence of CDCA, with efficiencies of 7.4 and 7.0% respectively, suggesting that they are less affected by aggregation issues. This assumption seems to be confirmed also by the lowest value of dye loading measured for the MC118 dye (see ESI†).
The other investigated sensitizers seem to be negatively affected by aggregation, showing in particular lower Jsc when CDCA in not used. When CDCA is employed, Voc values in a range between 670 and 690 mV, similarly to previously reported heteroleptic dyes were obtained.19,20,33 For MC120 and MC121, a consistent increase in the Jsc (15.2 mA) leads to photovoltaic efficiencies approaching 8%. This is attributable to the improved light harvesting ability, with an extinction coefficient of more than 17000 M−1 cm−1 for the absorption band in the visible region. Consistently, IPCE spectra for these sensitizers show a maximum of over 70% in the range between 450 and 600 nm (Fig. 4). Slightly lower photocurrents were instead measured for MC122–123, possibly due to the lower extinction coefficients. No strong differences in the amount of adsorbed dye are instead noticed, with values of about 1.4 mol cm−2 (see ESI†), in good agreement with previously measured values for other heteroleptic dyes or the N719 dye.60–62
 Fig. 4  IPCE spectra for DSCs based on MC dyes with CDCA added. 
The MC126 dye shows a lower efficiency and a different behavior in combination with the CDCA additive with respect to the symmetric bipyridine-based dyes. Its performances decrease by using the CDCA coadsorbent, suggesting a possible competition for the TiO2 binding sites. The three anchoring configuration, in fact, requires an increased semiconductor surface area,40 due to the quite rigid geometry of the phenyl-cyanoacrylic substituent. On the other hand the dye loading of 1.32 mol cm−2, measured without using the CDCA coadsorbent in the dye bath, is comparable to the other dyes of the series, see ESI,† suggesting a possible bi-anchoring mode, through the dicarboxylated bipyridine. Consistently, also the photovoltaic performances (η = 6.4%) of the MC126 dye under these conditions are essentially in line with the investigated symmetric heteroleptic sensitizers.
3. Conclusions
Summarizing, we have reported the design and synthesis of six novel Ru(II) heteroleptic complexes, employed as efficient sensitizers in DSC devices. Five of these complexes are based on two different but symmetric bipyridine ligands, while in one case a dissymmetric functionalized bipyridine was employed along the standard 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridyl ligand. The investigated complexes have shown promising optical and electronic properties, leading to overall efficiencies approaching 8%, comparable to the reference N719 dye, when used in combination with the chenodeoxycholic acid coadsorbent and a liquid iodine-based electrolyte. In particular, the use of long alkyl chains in the molecular structure, able to reduce the parasitic recombination processes, allowed us to achieve remarkably high photovoltages. On the other hand, the MC126 dye based on a dissymmetric bipyridine ligand, showed lower performances, possibly due to the competition between the dye and the CDCA additive for the TiO2 binding sites.
4. Experimental section
The starting materials used in the synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The solvents were purified by standard procedures and purged with nitrogen before use. All other chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and were used without further purification, and all reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere.
4.1 Physical measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-Vis to near IR 3600 spectrometer. Emission spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog 3, J. Y. Horiba fluorescence spectrometer. Chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectra were recorded with Advance 300 and 500 MHz spectrometers using TMS as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV model with an ESI probe. C, H, N, S data were recorded using Elementar (vario microtube) instrument. Eoxd was measured in DMF solution with 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as an electrolyte. The scanning rate was 100 mV s−1. A Pt wire working electrode and counter electrode were employed along with a SCE reference electrode.
4.2 Device fabrication
FTO coated glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, 4 mm, 10 Ω cm−2) was cleaned by sonication in an aqueous solution of Deaconex 21 (0.2 wt%) followed by heating for 30 min at 500 °C. To form a dense blocking layer, the substrates were treated in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution (70 °C, 30 min) and rinsed with deionized water. A 12 μm layer of transparent paste (18 NR-T, Dyesol) was spread on the FTO glass by screen printing. Next a 4 μm scattering layer was deposited over the transparent layer by using the same screen printing process. Different film thicknesses were obtained by repeating the screen printing step several times. The films were dried at 125 °C for 5 min between each print. The TiO2-coated electrodes were gradually heated under air flow at 325 °C for 5 min, at 375 °C for 5 min, at 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. A post treatment with TiCl4 was applied using 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. The area of the deposited films was 0.28 cm2. After reheating the photoanodes to 500 °C for 30 min, they were cooled down to about 80 °C and then immersed into the dye solutions (0.3 mM MC dyes, and when required 0.6 mM 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholic acid (CDCA) was added) containing 10% DMF in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio 1:1) for 20 h. After the sensitization procedure, the photoanodes were shortly rinsed with acetonitrile and dried in air. Counter electrodes were fabricated by drop casting a H2PtCl6 solution (about 5 mM in isopropanol) onto TEC 7 glass (Solaronix) and fired in air at 400 °C for 5 min. This procedure was replicated two times. Cells were assembled using a 25 μm thick Surlyn (DuPont) and sealed by heating. The Z960 liquid electrolyte (1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 50 mM LiI, 30 mM I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in a mixture of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (v/v, 85/15)) was introduced via two holes made previously on the counter electrode. The holes were sealed with Surlyn and a glass cover slip.
4.3 Device characterization
The solar cells were measured using a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel) with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the devices. A Schott K113 Tempax filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH) was used to reduce the spectral mismatch between AM1.5G and the simulated illumination to approximately 4% between 350 and 750 nm. J–V characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias to the cell while measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400). The voltage step and the equilibration time were 10 mV and 80 ms, respectively. The cells were covered with a thin mask (0.16 cm2) to reduce the scattered light. Incident-photon-to-collected-electron efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a homebuilt system composed of a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology), a Gemini-180 double monochromator with 1200 grooves mm−1 grating (Jobin Yvon Ltd) and a lock-in amplifier (SR830 DSP, Stanford Research Systems). The incident monochromatic light was chopped at a frequency of approximately 2 Hz and was superimposed onto a constant white light bias of 10 mW cm−2 supplied by a LED array in order to provide a sufficient base conductivity of the mesoporous TiO2 for charge collection.
4.4 Dye loading investigation
Dye sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes, prepared as described in section 4.2 (Device fabrication) were shortly rinsed with acetonitrile and dried in air. Then they were placed in the desorbing solution (0.1 M TBAOH in DMSO) and kept for two hours, in order to have the complete desorption of the sensitizer. The amount of the adsorbed dye was determined by measuring the absorption spectrum of the desorption solution. To obtain a quantitative measurement, a comparison with the absorption spectra of freshly prepared solutions of the dyes, at known concentration, under the same conditions, was also performed.60
4.5 Computational details
All the calculations have been performed using the Gaussian 09 program package.63 We optimized the molecular structures using the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional64 and a 3-21G* basis set65in vacuo. TDDFT calculations of the lowest singlet–singlet excitations were performed in DMF solution, on the optimized geometries using the B3LYP functional and a DGDZVP basis set.66 The C-PCM67,68 was employed for including the solvent effects in TDDFT calculations, as implemented in G09. To simulate the optical spectra, the 70 lowest spin-allowed singlet–singlet transitions were computed on the ground state geometry. Excitation energies and oscillator strengths were interpolated by a Gaussian convolution with a σ value of 0.14 eV, corresponding to a FWHM of ∼0.35 eV.
