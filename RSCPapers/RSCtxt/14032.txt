    , Accepted 29th October 2017First published on 30th October 2017AbstractDefects present ubiquitously in glasses exert a strong influence on the optical qualities and performances of glass, a phenomenon that has not been well studied to date. In this paper, novel fluorosilicate (FS) photonic glasses based on SiO2–KF–ZnF2 are reported which exhibit an intense near-ultraviolet (NUV) photoluminescence (PL) at 350 nm when excited by deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light centered at 260 nm. That the strong NUV PL, with an internal quantum efficiency as high as 85%, is a unique feature of the studied FS glasses has been confirmed by a thorough comparison of a wide range of glasses including silica, silicate, borate, phosphate, germanate, tellurite, fluorosilicate, fluoroborate, fluorogermanate and fluoride glasses. The NUV emission is attributed to intrinsic defects in the FS glasses, and the possible origin of the intrinsic defects is suggested. The effects of intrinsic-defect-sensitized PL of Mn2+ and rare-earth ion doped FS glasses are illustrated for the first time, and the sensitization mechanism is discussed. Our results demonstrate that defects, when properly controlled and understood, can be an enriching factor endowing the photonic glasses with a number of new and advantageous functions.
1. Introduction
Photonic glasses, suitable for both transmitting and modulating light signals,1–3 have already demonstrated prospects for use in a broad range of applications including, but not limited to, optical telecommunication,4,5 integrated photonic chips,6 solid state lighting7 and “smart windows” for energy saving.8 Generally, unique photonic functions are elicited by doping, topological engineering and compositional tuning etc., based on the well-established assumption that glasses exhibit short-range order (SRO) but lack long-range order (LRO). The SRO means that the basic building blocks of glasses are identical to their crystalline counterparts, e.g., silica glass versus quartz. In this respect, any deviations from the ideal crystal-like infrastructures are called “intrinsic defects”, e.g., wrong-bonds, anion vacancies and dangling bonds, among others.9 Studies of intrinsic defects in glasses and other phosphors have drawn great attention because of their close links to the photoluminescence (PL) properties. For example, defect-sensitized-PL, also termed “host-sensitized-PL” whereby PL is realized through energy transfer (ET) from the host to the dopants, has been reported in polycrystalline phosphors. The host sensitization features extremely efficient pump energy harvesting as compared with the direct excitation of the dopants, which is generally very weak due to the forbidden nature of the involved transitions.
In contrast to crystals that possess a well-defined band-gap structure and hence the possibility of tuning the PL to achieve a specific sensitization effect, the band gap structure of glasses is poorly defined, as is the energy level structure of defects in glasses. As such, the nature of defects in glasses is largely open to question, let alone the proper and controlled utilization of defects for sensitized PL. Previous studies mainly focused on the defects and related PL properties of silica glasses and fibers which play a pivotal role in telecommunications. The presence of defects has been demonstrated to impose a strong influence on the photosensitivity of the materials. For example, oxygen deficit centers (ODCs) have been proposed as a trigger for photosensitivity, and doping of Ge or Sn generates Ge- or Sn-related ODCs resulting in an enhanced photosensitivity.10
According to Tikhomirov, intrinsic defects in glasses alter the branching ratio between the stimulated and spontaneous emissions of the Er3+ dopant, which is a major source of noise in Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers.11 It is also known that intrinsic defects produce a nontrivial amount of gap-states in glasses, causing the UV absorption edge to be shifted to longer wavelengths.12 This reduced UV transparency goes against the use of glasses for high power laser systems, strong UV lamps, lens systems in UV microlithography and other special UV optics. Obviously, in the above-mentioned cases, the defects should be considered as a “bane.”
However, they can also be viewed as an enriching factor since, when properly controlled, they can positively determine the optical properties of glasses, such as photosensitivity, optical nonlinearity1 and PL properties.13 For example, the emission of defects in fluoride-containing phosphate-based glasses upon NUV (350 nm) laser irradiation can release part of the absorbed laser energy. The PL process mitigates the deposited heat-induced damage for the glasses, hence leading to the improvement of the resistance to laser-induced surface damage.14 Defects in glass have been demonstrated to facilitate the down conversion of the NUV light to the near-infrared one by ET from the defects to the Yb3+ dopant, and thus hold prospect for the improvement of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells.15 The defects with suitable energy level structure within the bandgap of glass are crucial for the long-persistent PL, a phenomenon now attracting great interest for glow-in-the-dark applications.16 Precise control of the amount coupled with an in-depth understanding of the nature of defects in glasses is thus essential to ‘‘turn a bane into a boon.”
Fluorosilicate glasses (FSGs) have long been credited as important photonic glasses due to their favorable properties, such as high transparency in the UV light region and ability to embed a number of functional fluoride nanocrystals via post thermal treatment.17 FSGs are often considered highly “defective” because of the volatilization of fluorine during melting thus leaving behind a non-trivial amount of anion vacancies.12 The presence of defects may influence the PL behavior of dopants such as transition metals (e.g., Mn2+) and rare-earths (e.g., Yb3+),15 a phenomenon that has not been well studied to date. In this work, the influence of the intrinsic defects on the PL properties of Mn2+ and rare earth ion (RE) doped FSGs has been studied in detail. A thorough comparison has been made of the PL properties among a wide range of glasses. The PL sensitization effect of the intrinsic defects is illustrated by detailed luminescence spectroscopy, and the underlying mechanism proposed.
2. Experiments
Glass samples with the nominal compositions (in mol%): (100 − 2x)SiO2–xKF–xZnF2 (x = 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5), 70SiO2–15KF–xZnF2 (x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25), 60SiO2–20KF–20ZnF2 doped with y mol% MnO (y = 0.1–1.0) and 65SiO2–17.5KF–17.5ZnF2 doped with 0.3 mol% REs (REs = Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Tb4O7, Dy2O3) were prepared using high purity (4N) raw materials of KF, ZnF2, SiO2, MnO, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Tb4O7, and Dy2O3. The raw materials weighing 20 g were melted at 1500 °C in a covered silica crucible of high purity (>99.5%) for 1 hour under ambient atmospheric conditions. The melt was poured onto a brass plate that had been preheated to 200 °C, and pressed using another identical cold brass plate. The glasses obtained using this process were subsequently annealed at 450 °C for 3 hours. Samples containing less or more SiO2 than in the studied range of 60–75 mol% were also prepared; however, they suffer from serious crystallization and thus do not warrant further study.
Transmission spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-VIS spectrometer over the spectral range of 200–1000 nm. Photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and PL decay spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) equipped with a 400 W Xe-lamp and a 75 W Xe-flashlamp as the excitation sources. The spectral widths of the slits were set to be 2 nm. The emission spectra were corrected for the response of the photomultiplier tube (PMT) by using the built-in correction file. Filters were also used to avoid the “ghost emission band” due to the grating diffraction at longer wavelength.
The microstructure of the samples was observed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Tokyo, Japan; 20 kV acceleration voltage, beam current 10 μA) combined with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS; Bruker Quantax, Germany) to study the distribution of elements.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of PL properties of intrinsic defects
The compositions of the glasses were quantitatively established using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) measurement. The resulting compositions differ from the nominal values as about thirty atomic percent of fluorine is lost during the melting; otherwise, the final compositions agree well with the target values (Table S1, ESI†). Since all the samples were prepared under the same conditions (melting temperature and time), it is believed that the loss amount of fluorine and accordingly the concentration of fluorine-vacancies increases with ZnF2. The amorphous nature of the glasses was confirmed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements. The studied FSGs are transparent down to the Deep Ultra Violet (DUV) wavelength (Fig. 1). The SEM image of and distribution of elements (Si, Zn, F) in the glass are shown in the inset of Fig. 1. Both Si and Zn distribute homogeneously in the glass, whereas F segregates in some domains.

The PL properties of the FSGs were studied using PL, PLE and PL decay measurements. As shown in Fig. 2, when excited by 260 nm (4.77 eV) DUV light, an intense emission in the near-UV (NUV) at 350 nm (3.54 eV) with a shoulder at 510 nm (2.43 eV), and a weak deep-red emission at 670 nm (1.85 eV) were recorded. The PL intensity of the NUV emission band increases with increasing ZnF2 content. Such a strong NUV emission with a full-width-at-half-maximum (HWHM) of 70 nm (∼0.66 eV) which is discernible at room temperature by the naked eye (inset photo in Fig. 2(a)) was not previously reported to the best of our knowledge for silica and FSGs according to ref. 18. The internal quantum efficiency of the NUV emission, as high as 85%, is estimated by the ratio of the integrated emission intensities at 10 K and 300 K (Fig. S1, ESI†). Monitoring the PLE spectra of the 350 and 670 nm emissions, an intense excitation band peaking at 260 and 270 nm can be observed (Fig. 3 shown below). For the 670 nm emission, a very weak broad excitation band from 350 to 550 nm can also be noticed. The decay of the 350, 510 and 670 nm emissions deviates from the single exponential function, thus the average lifetime  was evaluated. The lifetimes of the 350, 510, and 670 nm emissions are approximately 8.9, 21.2 and 153.8 μs, respectively (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2, ESI†).

The excitation spectra were obtained by monitoring the emissions of the Mn-free glass at 350 and 670 nm, and the Mn-doped glasses at 650 nm, respectively. Inset: Photo of the Mn-doped sample under 260 nm DUV light excitation.

That the intense 350 nm NUV PL is unique to the studied FSGs has been confirmed by a comprehensive comparison of a wide range of glasses including silica, silicate, borate, phosphate, germanate, tellurite, fluorosilicate, fluoroborate, fluorogermanate and fluoride glasses (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). Only the glasses containing ZnF2 (fluorosilicate, fluoroborate) exhibit the 350 nm NUV emission band with the strongest one observed in the studied FSGs. Although the ZBLAN (ZrF4–BaF2–LaF3–AlF3–NaF) glass shows a weak DUV emission band, the peak position is different from that of the FSGs. Other types of glasses are either moderately emitting at longer wavelengths (silicate, phosphate and germanate) or non-luminous (silica, borate, tellurite) at all wavelengths upon DUV light excitation. It is noted that the FSG free of Zn, for example, SiO2–KF–BaF2, is also absent of the 350 nm NUV emission (Fig. S4, ESI†). A control experiment was also made of the PL properties of the 1 mol% ZnO doped silicate, borate and phosphate glasses with the studied FSGs (Fig. S5, ESI†). However, the ZnO doped glasses either emit at a different wavelength or are non-luminous at all. Moreover, when comparing emission spectra of the glasses with KF and ZnF2 being either separately or both replaced by K2O and ZnO (Fig. S6, ESI†), it is obvious that only the FSGs simultaneously containing Zn and F elements exhibit the 350 nm NUV emission, whereas the silicate glass free of F only shows a broad 410 nm (3.0 eV) blue emission band.
3.2. Influence of intrinsic defects on the PL properties of the Mn2+ dopant
The charge state and bonding character of manganese have been characterized by EPR and XPS measurements (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI† and discussions therein). The main conclusions drawn from the measurements are: (a) although the samples were prepared in air the manganese ions were dominated by Mn2+; (b) the local bonding of Mn2+ is of high ionicity. The doping of manganese endows the glass with a light-pink color, and an induced absorption band around 510 nm (Fig. 3, black line). As compared with the sample free of Mn, doping leads to drastic weakening of the 350 nm NUV PL and the complete disappearance of the 510 nm shoulder band, and induces a strong red emission band at 650 nm (1.91 eV, inset photo in Fig. 3) upon 260 nm DUV excitation. The strong 650 nm red emission suggests that most Mn2+ ions are octahedrally coordinated in the studied FSGs.19 Monitoring the red emission band of Mn2+, three excitation bands at 250 nm, 350 nm and 410 nm can be observed. The 250 nm band is due to the glass host absorption, whereas the 350 and 410 nm bands are ascribed to the transitions from the ground state 6A1 (6S) to the excited states 4T2 (4D) and 4A1–4E (4G) of Mn2+, respectively.
The 510 nm absorption band is related to the 5E → 5T2 electronic transition of Mn3+ which is spin-allowed. Because of the strong absorption of Mn3+, the presence of even a slight amount of Mn3+ can render a significant coloration of glasses.20 It should be noted that the absorption related to Mn3+ (directly proportional to the concentration of Mn3+) is considerably less intense in the studied FSGs than in the silicate glass if the fluoride compounds (KF and ZnF2) are replaced by the oxide counterparts (K2O and ZnO) (Fig. S9, ESI†). Since the 510 nm PL from the defects overlaps with the absorption band of Mn3+, it is likely that the PL quenching is due to the re-absorption by Mn3+ (Fig. 3).
The variation of PL spectra as a function of the concentration of Mn2+ is shown in Fig. 4(a). The PL intensity of the 350 nm NUV emission decreases, whereas that of the Mn2+ emission increases with increasing concentration of MnO until it reaches 0.5 mol%, and further increase leads to the concentration quenching. The doping of Mn2+ results in the significantly reduced NUV emission lifetime from 8.9 μs to 1.3 μs, and the decay rate of the NUV emission increases with increasing concentration of Mn2+. The results clearly indicate that there is an energy transfer (ET) from the defects to Mn2+. On the other hand, the red emission (650 nm) of the Mn2+-doped glass possesses an extremely long decay lifetime (12 ms). The drastic difference of the decay rates among various luminescence centers has a strong effect on the shape of the emission spectra as illustrated in Fig. S10 (ESI†).
The 4T1 → 6A1 radiative transition of Mn2+ (650 nm) is both spin- and parity-forbidden, thus the emission intensity is relatively weak and the lifetime is very long. Sensitizers such as Ce3+, Tb3+, Eu2+, Sb3+ or Bi3+ have been used to enhance the luminescence of Mn2+.21–24 The unique defect sensitized PL of Mn2+ from the studied FSGs appears to be an explicit advantage when it is compared with other types of Mn-doped glass. An example is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), where there is no PL that can be detected from the Mn-doped phosphate glass that is absent of the 350 nm NUV emission.
3.3. Influence of intrinsic defects on the PL properties of the RE dopants
Referring to Dieke's chart25 and Carnall's work,26 trivalent REs (Ln3+) except for Ce3+, Pr3+ and Yb3+ possess 4f–4f transitions energetically matching the broad 350 nm NUV emission band, partially meeting the requirement of spectral overlap for ET to occur between the intrinsic defects and REs. As such, it is of interest to study the influence of the intrinsic defects on the PL properties of Ln3+ doped in FSGs. We have measured PL spectra of Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+ and Er3+ doped FSGs under the same 260 nm light excitation; only Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped glasses show characteristic narrow line emissions of REs (Fig. 5), whereas the rest exhibit undulated PL spectra with troughs corresponding to the absorption bands of REs but are absent of emissions of REs (Fig. S12, ESI† and discussions therein). Hereafter, we will focus on the PL properties of the Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped FSGs. Although the selected REs are known for the variation in the charge states, for example, Sm3+/Sm2+, Eu3+/Eu2+ and Tb3+/Tb+, the REs exist solely in the trivalent state in the studied FSGs. This is because Sm2+ and Eu2+ can be obtained only when prepared under a strong reducing atmosphere, and Tb4+ under high energy X-ray irradiation.27
 Fig. 5  Transmission (blue lines), PL (red lines) and PLE (green lines) spectra of Sm (a), Eu (b), Tb (c) and Dy-doped (d) samples. In all cases, the black line stands for the PL spectrum of the undoped FSGs recorded under the identical excitation conditions. The PL spectra were obtained upon 260 nm light excitation. The vertical axes for the PL and PLE spectra were unified on the same scale so it can be directly compared for the intensity. Insets: Photos of the samples upon 260 nm light irradiation. 
As compared to the RE-free glass, the doping of REs leads to the following changes: (a) the intensities of the 350 nm NUV emissions from the Sm3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+-doped glasses become weakened, but it is enhanced in the Eu-doped sample; (b) the RE doped glasses show structured 350 nm emission bands, viz., the positions of the valleys in the emission band are exactly at the wavelengths where the REs show noticeable excitation bands; (c) the decay of the 350 nm emission is faster in the Sm3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+-doped glasses (Fig. 6), whereas for the Eu3+-doped sample, it begins with a sharp and fast decay (within the first 100 μs) and is then followed by a long exponential decay (in the order of 1 ms, inset in Fig. 6); (d) more importantly, apart from the broad 350 nm NUV emission, characteristic emissions of REs can be measured. Specifically, for the Sm3+-doped glass, emissions at 562, 600 and 648 nm can be noticed, which are due to the 4G5/2 → 6Hj/2 (j = 5, 7, 9) transitions. For the Eu3+-doped glass, emissions at 590, 614, 652 and 700 nm can be observed, which are ascribed to the 5D0 → 7Fj (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions. For the Tb3+-doped glass, emissions at 488, 544, 584 and 622 nm can be recorded, owing to the 5D4 → 7Fj (j = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions. For the Dy3+-doped glass, emissions at 482, 576 and 666 nm can be registered, and are assigned to the 4F9/2 → 6Hj/2 (j =15, 13 and 11) transitions.

Monitoring the strongest emissions of the selected REs, viz., Sm3+ at 600 nm, Eu3+ at 614 nm, Tb3+ at 544 nm and Dy3+ at 576 nm, respectively, all exhibit a common broad DUV excitation band at 250 nm (indicated by a gray rectangle) and a number of sharp excitation bands unique to the individual REs (Fig. 5). Detailed assignments of the excitation bands for Sm3+ and Eu3+ are illustrated in Fig. 7 (discussion section). The 250 nm excitation band is less intense than the 4f electron excitation bands. Further comparison among the selected REs demonstrates that it is more intense in the Eu3+ and Tb3+ doped samples, which results from the overlap of the charge transfer (CT) band of Eu3+28 and the 4f–5d transition (f–d) band of Tb3+29 with the energy band of the intrinsic defects. Generally, the oscillator strength of the CT and f–d transitions is much stronger than that of the parity-forbidden 4f–4f transitions. The weak CT and f–d transition bands in the Eu3+ and Tb3+-doped samples imply that only a severely limited amount of REs are likely involved in the CT and f–d transitions. The PL decay of the characteristic emissions from the selected REs when they are excited by the common 260 nm and their own strongest excitation bands is shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Typical millisecond-scale lifetimes of REs are found and appear to be independent of the excitation wavelength.

The dashed arrows represent non-radiative energy transfers between the intrinsic defects and the dopants, and the relaxations between the excited states of the dopants. The black arrows represent PL excitation and emissions. The energy levels of the dopants accepting the transferred excitation energy and giving rise to the characteristic emissions are indicated by red color. The charge transfer (CT) band of Eu3+ or the 4f–5d transition (f–d) band of Tb3+ is overlapping with the energy band of the intrinsic defects as indicated by the blue band. 
4. Discussion
4.1. The origin of the intrinsic defects
The intrinsic PL of silica glass has been studied for more than half a century, yet there exist no unequivocal detailed models of the PL centers.30 The same NUV emission band was observed from oxidized porous silicon and SiO2 powder, which implies a connection with some oxygen-related defects.31 An extensive literature search, however, shows that none of the previously identified intrinsic defects in silica glasses, such as the E′-center and non-bridging oxygen hole center (NBOHC), has strong emissions at 350 nm at room temperature (RT). On the other hand, since Ce3+ is known for its NUV emission at a similar wavelength, we have measured the PL of the sample doped with Ce3+ (Fig. S15, ESI†). The decay lifetime of the Ce3+-doped sample is about several nano-seconds, three orders of magnitude less than that of the non-doped FSGs. It is thus obvious that the strong NUV emission is not due to the extrinsic Ce3+ impurities. Moreover, a number of impurities (Ti4+, Cr3+, Ni2+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+) were intentionally doped into the studied FSGs; however, none of them leads to the enhancement of the 350 nm NUV emission (Fig. 5 and Fig. S12, ESI†). These results suggest that the 350 nm emission in the FSGs is not from the extrinsic impurities.
Blasse found that oxygen-impurity-containing Ba2ZnF6 crystals generate a strong emission band at 360 nm at RT.32 The center of the emission is tentatively assigned to the oxygen-coordinated Zn2+ d10 complex in fluoride crystals, and efficient emission is possible if the expansion of the excited state of the d10 complex is restricted by stiff surroundings. It seems that such a requirement can be satisfied for the present FSGs since, according to recent experimental and theoretical studies, the FSGs are characterized by nano-phase separation, consisting of fluoride- and silica-rich glassy phases and a network intermediator (e.g., Zn2+, Al3+, Pb2+etc.) which occupies interface positions between the separated glassy phases, consequently linking the two phases together.17,33 As shown in the inset in Fig. 1, it is indeed the case that F segregates in some domains and Zn is distributed homogeneously in the entire glass. The rigid structure of the silica-rich phase can significantly restrict the expansion of the excited state of the Zn2+ d10 complex. However, a comprehensive comparison with the fluoride crystals is still lacking because there is no lifetime data for the intrinsic defects in the fluoride crystals.
An emission band at 370 nm was observed from borosilicate glass when excited by 260 nm light. Although its origin has been assumed to be related to the defects in the glass, the exact nature was not explicitly identified. Moreover, the lifetime of the 370 nm emission band is in the nanosecond scale (56 ns), which is considerably shorter than that of the 350 nm NUV band for the studied FSGs. Ehrt reported that glass and glass-ceramics based on 40ZnO–10Al2O3–50SiO2 show a NUV emission band at 370 nm when exposed to UV excitation at 250 nm.34 The similarity would be indicative of the same PL center, viz., the fourfold coordinated Zn2+. However, the noticeable offset (∼20 nm) of the emission peaks indicates that different agents other than the fourfold coordinated Zn2+ cannot be excluded. Similar 350 nm NUV emission was also found from zincborate glass-ceramic containing ZnO nanocrystals,35 but the lifetime was considerably shorter than that of the FSGs studied here. In fact, the authors have suggested that the emission is due to the inter-band transition of the ZnO nanocrystal.
In summary, our studies clearly demonstrate that the 350 nm NUV PL is unique to the FSGs simultaneously containing Zn and F elements, and the results favor that the unique NUV emission originates from the intrinsic defects related to the ZnF2 groups.
4.2. The sensitization mechanism of the intrinsic defects on the dopants

4.2.1 Sensitization of Mn2+. 
Since both the EPR and XPS studies suggest that Mn2+ is neighboring to fluorine anions, it is not difficult to conjecture that those Mn2+ ions that are in the proximity of the ZnF2 groups can readily accept the excited energy, thus resulting in the enhanced and sensitized PL. The sensitization mechanism is depicted schematically in Fig. 7(a). The optical band gap (Eg) is roughly defined as the wavelength at which the absorption coefficient equals 10 cm−1.36 The defect levels were roughly estimated according to their PLE and emission spectra, viz., the excitation band at 260 nm (4.77 eV), and emission bands at 350 (3.54 eV), 510 (2.43 eV) and 670 (1.85 eV) nm, respectively. The same method was also applied for the determination of the energy levels of Mn2+. However, we must admit that the exact positions of the energy levels of the defects and Mn2+ relative to the band states such as the top of the valence band (VB) are not known based on such a method. Therefore, only a simplified schematic diagram was used which serves to illustrate the energy transfer processes between the intrinsic defects and Mn2+. Specifically, the 260 nm excitation light excites the electrons from the top of the VB to the localized states at the bottom of the conduction band (CB) of the host glass. The excited electrons are trapped by the intrinsic defects, and then transfer non-radiatively to Mn2+ in the proximity of the defects, whereby the excited Mn2+ ions emit at 650 nm.
The energy transfer (ET) efficiency (η) from the intrinsic defects to Mn2+ can be estimated according to the expression: η = (1 − τ/τ0) × 100, where τ and τ0 are the lifetimes of the intrinsic defects in the presence and absence of Mn2+, respectively. The value is approximately 75%, which is considerably greater than that of the Bi3+/Mn2+ (∼29.7%23) and Sb3+/Mn2+ (26.3%24) pairs. This together with the ease of preparation and the relatively cheap price of the raw materials is promising for the potential use of the studied FSGs in industrial applications.


4.2.2 Sensitization of Ln3+. 
The effects of the intrinsic defects on the PL properties of REs bear a close relationship with the chemical environment of REs in glasses, which can be inferred from the emission spectrum of Eu3+ (Fig. 5(b)). As has been widely used, the PL intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 (at 614 nm, electric-dipole allowed) to 5D0 → 7F1 (at 590 nm, magnetic-dipole allowed) transitions provides a useful means for the evaluation of the degree of asymmetry around and the bond covalency of Eu3+.37 The ratio is generally in a range of 0.90–1.30 in Eu3+-doped fluoride glasses, because of low covalency of the Eu–F bonds and high symmetric environments around Eu3+. The ratio is much larger (2.41–3.77) in oxide glasses, because Eu3+ bonds with O2− and forms strong and directional covalent bonds. For the studied Eu3+-doped FSGs, the ratio is 2.39 which is between that of pure fluoride and oxide glasses, indicating that Eu3+ is surrounded by both F− and O2−.28 This point can be further corroborated from the emission spectrum of Sm3+ (Fig. 5(a)), where it is seen that the 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 transition at 600 nm that is magnetic dipole allowed is nonetheless stronger than the 4G5/2 → 6H9/2 transition at 648 nm that is electric dipole allowed.38 This also implies that Sm3+ tends to be surrounded by both F− and O2− in the studied FSGs. The Judd–Ofelt calculations based on the absorption spectra of REs give the three intensity parameters, Ωt (t = 2, 4, 6), being 7.3 × 10−20, 0.2 × 10−20 and 5.4 × 10−20 cm2, respectively. Among them, Ω2 is the most sensitive to local structure and previous studies have suggested that it scales with the degree of asymmetry around REs.39 The value of Ω2 is in between those of RE doped fluoride (∼3.2 × 10−20 cm2) and oxide glasses (∼9.0 × 10−20 cm2) indicative of mixed fluoride and oxide chemical environments in the vicinity of REs in FSGs.40
Bearing the analysis of the local structure of REs in mind, and the fact that both the 350 nm NUV emission intensity and lifetime decrease with RE-doping (except for Eu3+), the ET between the intrinsic defects and REs (taking Sm3+ as an example) can be understood as shown in Fig. 7(b). Similar to the case of Mn2+-doping, the ET involves capture of the excited electrons by the defects and subsequent transfer to the overlapping 4f electronic levels of REs, and finally PL occurs from the emitting levels of REs. However, the situation is somewhat different in the Eu3+ and Tb3+ doped samples, because the 260 nm light can also excite the CT and 4f–5d bands of Eu3+ and Tb3+ in the DUV wavelength range (Fig. 7(c)). Consequently, two effects, viz., the ET between the intrinsic defects and REs as well as the direct excitation of REs coexist especially in the Eu3+-doped sample, where an enhanced 350 nm emission was observed thanks to contribution of the Eu3+ emission. This also accounts for the two-step-decay of the 350 nm emission as shown in Fig. 6 (inset), specifically, the initial fast PL decay is related to the intrinsic defects and the subsequent slow one is related to Eu3+. Following the same line, the stronger excitation band at 250 nm in the Tb3+-doped sample (Fig. 5(c)) is due to the embodiment of both the excitations of the intrinsic defects and Tb3+ itself.
Although the doping of REs leads to weakening of the 350 nm NUV emission, the intensity is still comparable to that of the 4f–4f transitions of REs. This is in sharp contrast with the case of Mn2+-doping, where the 350 nm NUV emission was almost completely quenched and became less intense than the Mn2+ emission. It seems that the sensitization of the intrinsic defects on Mn2+ is more efficient than on REs.

5. Conclusion
By a comprehensive study of PL properties among various types of glasses and intentionally doped FSGs, we have demonstrated that the intense NUV emission band at 350 nm is a unique feature of the FSGs containing intrinsic defects closely related to the ZnF2 groups. The PL intensity of the NUV emission increases with the concentration of ZnF2, and the internal quantum efficiency can be as high as 85%. The excellent overlapping of the NUV emission band with the Mn2+ excitation bands results in the highly efficient ET from the intrinsic defects to Mn2+ in the vicinity of the ZnF2 groups.
Measurements of PL spectra of RE doped FSGs excited by 260 nm DUV light show that only Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ doped glasses show characteristic narrow line emissions of REs, apart from the broad undulated 350 nm emission band. Based on the emission spectra and Judd–Ofelt analysis, the REs appear to be surrounded by both F− and O2− and thus the local environments of REs feature a high degree of symmetry and low covalency. Upon the DUV light excitation, the ET between the intrinsic defects and REs results in the characteristic emissions of Sm3+ and Dy3+, whereas two effects, viz., the ET between the intrinsic defects and REs as well as the direct excitation of REs coexist in the Eu3+ and Tb3+ doped samples.
The FSGs can be efficiently excited by DUV light (190–350 nm), and thus they are highly promising candidates for many applications including solar-blind detectors,41 light converter phosphors for photovoltaic cover glasses and for greenhouse window glass.42 Moreover, with recent advancements in the development of high-power DUV semiconductors,43 the FSGs can also be used as gain media for color-center fiber lasers.
