    , Accepted 22nd October 2021First published on 28th October 2021AbstractThe B-site doping of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites of the form MAPbX3 is not only an effective way to improve energy conversion (solar-electrical, thermal-electrical, solar-chemical, etc.) performance, but it is also eco-friendly, reducing the toxic Pb content. To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on the photocatalytic and thermoelectric properties after the partial doping of Zn2+ into the Pb2+ lattice sites of perovskite MAPbBr3 crystals fabricated through a solvothermal route (Zn–MAPbBr3). Systematic characterization, including XRD, EDS, XPS, UV-vis, PL, N2 adsorption/desorption, Hall measurement, time-resolved photoluminescence measurement (TRPL), and electrochemical analysis, showed that the smaller Zn2+ guests increase the Goldschmidt tolerance and octahedral tilting factor of MAPbBr3 and enhance the carrier concentration, carrier mobility and conductivity, active site number, and oxidation abilities of Zn–MAPbBr3. Finally, Zn–MAPbBr3 crystals exhibited an improved absorption capacity and better photocatalytic degradation performance toward RhB dye and improved thermoelectric transportation properties, including better electrical conductivity and a more positive Seebeck coefficient, compared with pristine MAPbBr3.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the multifunctional nature of organic–inorganic halide perovskites (ABX3) has allowed their use for many important energy conversion and storage applications, such as in photovoltaic devices, photodetectors, high-energy-ray detectors, photocatalysts, thermoelectrics, etc.1,2 Interestingly, the new concept of using thermoelectric materials for catalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation has also been verified via testing the thermocatalytic performances of traditional thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3 and PbTe.3 With regards to organic–inorganic halide perovskites, it is meaningful to investigate the photocatalytic and thermoelectric applications of MAPbBr3-based compounds. Surface and interfacial engineering strategies, including foreign element substitution using Cs, Ag, Bi, and I at the A, B, and X sites of the host lattice4 and surface decoration,5–7 have been explored to tune the band gap and carrier transport dynamics.
On one hand, for dye degradation in alcoholic systems, Cs2AgBiBr6 and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped CsPbBr3 have displayed good reactivity for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) within 120 min4 and methylene blue (MB) within 60 min.5 Furthermore, poly(norepinephrine)-MAPbBr3 core–shell and MAPbBr3@metal–organic framework ZIF-8 composites have shown catalytic efficiency toward malachite green (MG), with 81% degradation within 2 h,6 and methyl orange (MO), with 70% degradation within 30 min.7 On the other hand, thermoelectric materials can directly utilize temperature gradients (waste thermal energy) to create electricity via the Seebeck effect.1 In 2004, a milestone work was proposed involving thermoelectric lead–antimony–silver–telluride AgPbmSbTem+2 alloys obtained through a PbTe doping strategy.8 It is well known that thermoelectric (TE) materials can be evaluated using the figure of merit ZT = S2σT/(κe + κL), where σ, S, and T are the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and absolute temperature, respectively, and the total thermal conductivity κ can be described by κe + κL, where κe and κL are the electronic and ionic contributions to the thermal conductivity, respectively.8,9 It is a big challenge to achieve high ZT values, since there is strong correlation between thermal and electrical transport in solids. The ZT value of a conventional inorganic thermoelectric material is usually low or closed to 1, and the ZT value of an advanced thermoelectric material must be larger than at least 2 or, preferably, 3, which could be competitive compared with conventional power generators.9 It has been demonstrated that strong carrier-phonon scattering is a major and intrinsic source of low mobility.10 The enhanced chemical bond covalency achieved upon Te doping results in a smaller effective mass and, thus, improved carrier mobility, through the weakening of carrier-phonon coupling. A superior maximum ZT value of ∼1.2 at 873 K for BiCuSeO is achieved through a combination of structural and electronic features, including an improved power factor (S2σ) and a reduced κL value due to hierarchical structural features, such as dual point defects, grain boundaries, etc.10 Similarly, recent theoretical work has predicted the enhanced thermoelectric performance of CH3NH3AI3 (A = Pb and Sn), which could have a high ZT value between 1 and 2 due to the small carrier effective mass and weak electron–phonon and hole–phonon coupling.9 The ultralow thermal conductivities of halide perovskites coupled with decent carrier mobilities and reasonable Seebeck coefficients suggest the possibility for their use in solar-thermoelectric generation11 rather than conventional inorganic chalcogenide thermoelectric materials. However, the low charge carrier density is a barrier to the further improvement of the thermoelectric properties. Recently, the optimization of the carrier transport properties via reducing the concentration of defects in the Au/MAPbBr3/PFO/Au structure12 and via A-site, X-site, and B-site doping with Cs, I and Bi into MAPbBr313,14 has been reported.
Doping, involving the intentional incorporation of foreign atoms into the host lattices of halide perovskites, offers much freedom in terms of eliminating defects and distortions via repairing the Pb–X octahedral coordination environment and suppressing halide vacancies.15,16 Interestingly, zinc-doped halide perovskites could reduce the nonadiabatic coupling between conduction bands, which can slow down photogenerated hot-carrier relaxation processes, resulting in slower hot-carrier cooling compared with pristine samples.17 Furthermore, systematic DFT studies have indicated that Zn is one of the best candidates for replacing lead in MAPbX3.18 Despite recent work involving doping divalent transition–metal Zn2+ ions into halide perovskites for use in light-emitting devices,19–22 this approach has received limited attention in terms of the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes and improving the thermoelectric behavior, and the process of gaining a relative understanding is still in its infancy.
Herein, we synthesized highly stable Zn-incorporating MAPbBr3via a solvothermal method. A wide range of structural characterization processes were used to demonstrate the substitution of Pb2+ sites with Zn2+ ions without altering the crystal lattice. Furthermore, the thermoelectric, photocatalytic, and electrochemical properties of Zn-doped MAPbBr3 were systematically studied and compared with pure MAPbBr3. Probing the fundamental properties, such as the carrier density and the position of the valence band edge of doped MAPbBr3, could provide a sound explanation of the performance enhancement, and this was one motivation for our study.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials preparation and characterization
All chemical reagents for the preparation of Zn–MAPbBr3 powder were analytically pure and used without further purification. Briefly, 30 mg (0.08 mmol) of lead acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O; 99.99%; Aladdin Industrial Corporation), 4 mg (0.02 mmol) of Zn(CH3COO)2, 5 mL of HBr solution (AR; Aladdin Industrial Corporation), and 450 μL of CH3NH2 alcohol solution (30–33%; AR) were added to a stirred beaker to form a homogeneous mixture, which was then transferred into a 50 mL stainless-steel Teflon-lined autoclave at 160 °C for 6 h. Finally, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and the resulting sample was collected, rinsed with distilled isopropanol several times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h.
Morphologies and microstructures were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were acquired using a Nexus 870 FTIR instrument (USA). Steady-state PL measurements were carried out with a spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog, Horiba Jobin-Yvon) with a 300 W xenon lamp excitation source and a photomultiplier tube detector. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected and pore-size distributions were determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method. Electrochemical measurements were made using an electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode configuration. Perovskite thin film deposited on FTO glass served as the working electrode (working area: ∼1 cm2). In brief, 5 mg of catalyst powder and 10 μL of 5 wt% Nafion solution were ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL of isopropanol solvent to form a homogeneous ink. Next, 8 μL of the dispersion was transferred onto the glassy carbon disk, leading to a catalyst loading of ∼0.2 mg cm−2. Finally, the as-prepared stable catalyst film was dried and kept in a glovebox before use. Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode was a silver wire immersed in 0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile. The electrodes were immersed in electrolyte composed of 0.1 M TBAPF6 in CH2Cl2 and sealed in a closed glass chamber to avoid solvent loss and to keep the working area constant.
2.2 Thermoelectric transport properties
The orange-red powder was pressed into a rectangular-shaped bar with dimensions of ∼10 × 4.6 × 1.0 mm3 using a special mold under 10 MPa for electrical property measurements. The electrical conductivities of samples were measured via a DC four-probe technique using a 2400 sourcemeter (Keithley 2400, Keithley Instruments Inc., America) under an argon atmosphere, to avoid possible oxidization, from room temperature to 150 °C. To obtain Seebeck coefficients, a microheater that created a temperature difference of about 3–15 K between the cool and hot ends of specimens was applied. The temperature differences (ΔT) were determined using calibrated nickel chromium–nickel silicon thermocouples, while the corresponding thermally induced voltages (ΔV) were recorded using voltage probes. Then, Seebeck coefficients can be obtained based on the formula S = −ΔV/ΔT. Hall data were measured using Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS).
2.3 Photocatalytic experiments
The photocatalytic activities of samples were evaluated in terms of rhodamine B (RhB) dye degradation under visible light. Typically, 5.0 mg of catalyst was well dispersed in 40 mL of RhB isopropanol solution at an initial concentration (C0) of 10 mg mL−1. Subsequently, the dispersion was stirred for 1 h in the dark to reach adsorption equilibrium. Then, the container was irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp at a vertical distance of 20 cm. Finally, the concentration of RhB (C) was analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at given time intervals.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphology

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the formation process of the Zn-doped MAPbBr3 (Zn–MAPbBr3) perovskite microcrystals using a solvothermal reaction route. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to determine the composition phase and crystallinity of samples. Fig. 1b illustrates that the XRD diffraction peaks of as-prepared undoped and Zn-doped MAPbBr3 samples appeared at 14.8°, 21.0°, 30.2°, 33.9°, 37.1°, 43.1°, and 45.6°, corresponding to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (300) planes of the cubic-phase ABX3 perovskite structure. No characteristic peaks from Zn- or Pb-related impurities, such as Zn, Pb, ZnO, or PbO, are observed, indicating that doping Zn ions into the cubic lattice does not destroy the parent MAPbBr3 crystal structure.19,20 However, compared to the XRD pattern of pure MAPbBr3, the diffraction peak shifted toward a higher 2θ value, from 14.86° to 14.93°, upon adding the Zn element, and the lattice contraction is attributed to the ionic radius of Pb2+ (1.19 nm, electronegativity (χ) = 1.6) being slightly larger than that of Zn2+ (0.74 nm, χ = 1.7).19,21 Specifically, in our present work, it is worth noting that the diffraction peak of MAPbBr3 at 14.86° presents a shoulder peak. MAPbBr3 is well-known to have three different phases, including cubic MAPbBr3 with the Pmm space group and a lattice constant of a = 5.9 Å, tetragonal MAPbBr3 with P4/mmm (a = 5.89 Å and c = 5.86 Å), and orthorhombic MAPbBr3 with the Pna21 space group (a = 7.98 Å, b = 8.58 Å, and c = 11.85 Å). Ordinarily, MAPbBr3 with a cubic lattice structure is more stable at high temperatures. However, the perovskite phase composition remains a topic of intense debate, and it is highly dependent on the microstructure (e.g., thin film, powder, or bulk crystal) that forms as a result of the synthetic method used.23 It is believed that the shoulder peak can be attributed to the minor domain coexistence of the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal phase along with the centrosymmetric cubic phase in the MAPbBr3 microcrystals obtained under solvothermal conditions. Coexisting α- and δ-phase domains were also found in CsPbI3 mixed-phase films, based on the XRD results.24 We also investigated the effects of the Zn:Pb molar ratio in the precursor (6%, 28%, and 50%) on the crystal structures of Zn–MAPbBr3 products (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The identical XRD patterns at different ratios showed that the solvothermal method can efficiently synthesize the Zn–MAPbBr3 perovskite. Clearly, in contrast to the pristine sample, the diffraction peak at around 14.93° after the introduction of Zn (a Zn:Pb molar ratio of 28%) exhibited symmetry, indicating that there is no secondary phase and that there are no crystalline residual metal halide salts. Similar results were observed for Bi-MAPbBr3.14 Therefore, the present work mainly focused on samples with a Zn:Pb molar ratio of 28%, and the properties of samples with other proportions will be less investigated. Halide perovskites have an ABX3 stoichiometry (A = methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), or cesium (Cs); B = metal ion; X = Br, I, or Cl), comprising a network of inorganic (metal–halide BX6) octahedra with loosely bound organic A cations forming a three-dimensional (3D) structure (Fig. 1d). In other words, smaller Zn2+ cations replace octahedrally coordinated Pb2+ sites, leading to progressive lattice shrinking. Notably, despite the structural versatility, there are limits, and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is one major way of evaluating the choice of ion for B-site partial substitution in perovskite cages from a structural and geometrical aspect.25,26 The Goldschmidt tolerance factor has been used extensively to predict the stability of a perovskite structure based only on the chemical formula, ABX3, and the ionic radius of each ion (A, B, and X), and it can be calculated from the following expression:  where rA and rB are the effective radii of the A and B site cations, respectively, and rX is the ionic radius of the anion. The value of t indicates whether the A site cation can fit within the cavities in the BX3 framework. Empirically, to maintain the symmetry of the cubic perovskite structure, the value of t should in the range of 0.813 < t < 1.107. A value in the lower part of this range may lead to distortion due to the tilting of BX6 octahedra and the lowering of symmetry. If t > 1, the A site cation is too large, generally precluding the formation of the perovskite. In other words, higher (>1) or lower (<0.8) t values result in non-perovskite structures that adapt different types of PbI6-octahedra connectivity. Improved structural stability is correlated with a more effective Goldschmidt tolerance factor upon the incorporation of Zn2+ ions with a smaller radius than Pb2+ ions. The effective ionic radii are as follows: r(Pb2+) = 119 pm, r(Zn2+) = 74 pm, r(MA+) = 216 pm, and r(Br2−) = 196 pm;26 therefore, t = (216 + 196)/1.414 × (119 + 196) = 412/445.41 = 0.925, which is close to the reported value for MAPbBr3 (t =0.93).16 The t value of CH3NH3ZnBr3 is (216 + 196)/1.414 × (74 + 196) = 412/381.78 = 1.079, which is similar to the t value of CH3NH3ZnI3 (1.05).27 Therefore, the partial substitution of Pb2+ with Zn2+ with smaller B-site cations can reduce the B–X bond length and stabilize the 3D perovskite structure via reducing the extent of octahedral rotation or distortion, thereby leading to a more optimal tolerance factor (improved Zn–MAPbBr3 phase stability). In addition, to assess the fit of the B site cation into the X6 octahedra, the octahedral tilting factor (μ) is also considered, which is defined as:  If the octahedral factor (μ) is less than 0.40, this leads to an unstable structure. Here, μ(CH3NH3PbBr3) = 119/196 = 0.607 and μ(CH3NH3ZnBr3) = 0.378, showing that complete Zn substitution will weaken the structural stability.17 Therefore, the XRD and theoretical calculation results make the prediction that Zn2+ partial substitution could improve the stability of Zn–MAPbBr3 perovskites.

(d) An illustration of the doped structure. 
The morphologies and microstructures of products were observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is clearly seen that the MAPbBr3 cube-like sample has a smooth surface (Fig. 2a and b). In contrast, Zn–MAPbBr3, as shown in Fig. 2c and d, had a rough surface with many surface pits and holes, which is attributed to progressive lattice contraction due to the extrinsic doping of smaller Zn2+ cations into larger Pb2+ sites, generating lattice strain at the doped sites within MAPbBr3 on the nanoscale. It is reported that dopants induce surface-state and shape/phase changes and that they can modify the surface electronic properties of host nanocrystals.28–30 It is well-known that the growth kinetics under high-temperature and high-pressure solvothermal reaction conditions involve matter flux, that is, the quantity of ions crossing a given surface has an effect on the morphology of the Zn–MAPbBr3 crystals because Zn has higher chemical activity than Pb plus the ability to coordinate with CH3NH3 groups.27 Godinho et al. proposed that fast dissolution occurring at surface dislocations results in the enrichment of the fluid boundary layer near the surface during crystal growth, forming protruding structures, such as small etching holes and pits, under the given fluid flow and mass-transport reaction environment conditions.29 The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum showed a Zn-to-(Zn plus Pb) atomic ratio of 0.26, corresponding to MAZn0.26Pb0.74Br3, which is supported by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis; this is close to the initial Zn:Pb molar ratio in the precursor (28%). To further confirm that the prepared product is a solid solution, a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) micrograph of a selected individual microcrystal was obtained and the associated EDS mapping of C, N, Pb, Zn, and Br was carried out, as shown in Fig. 2e, which indicates that Zn atoms are homogeneously distributed within the entire MAPbBr3 lattice, confirming the homogeneous solid-solution phase behavior of the crystals; they are not phase-separated nanocrystals,30 making them different from the nano-segregated bulk quaternary PbTe-based alloys with lead–antimony–silver–telluride compositions (conventionally denoted as AgPbmSbTem+2) reported by the Kanatzidis research group.8 The AgnPbmSbnTem+2n materials are derived from the isoelectronic substitution of Pb2+ ions by Ag+ and Sb3+ (or Bi) in the cubic lattice. An issue is how the Ag+ and Sb3+ ions are distributed in the structure, i.e., homogeneously or inhomogeneously. A completely homogeneous Ag+ and Sb3+ dispersion would require the complete separation of Ag+ and Sb3+ pairs over long distances. Usually, Zn2+ is doped into perovskites via two routes: at interstitial sites or via partial substitution. The Song research group confirmed that Zn2+ was doped into perovskites interstitially via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis.31 Alternatively, Wei et al. and Wang et al. reported that Pb2+ ions are partially replaced by smaller Zn2+ ions in Zn-doped CsPbI2Br and MAPbBr3 perovskites based on XRD, XPS, and HRTEM measurements.17,21 XRD techniques, mainly used for long-range structural characterization, cannot provide detailed local structure information. Preliminary evidence comes from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, which are used to indicate inhomogeneities in the microstructure, such as very small Ag–Sb-rich phase regions embedded in the PbTe matrix8 and a heterophase composed of coexisting α- and δ-phase domains in CsPbI3 films.32

To further explore the microscopic morphology and determine the structure at the atomic scale, Zn–MAPbBr3 powder was broken up using an ultrasonic cell crusher in toluene. Uniform nanocrystals with cubic shapes can be observed in TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 3a. The SAED image shows that Zn–MAPbBr3 possesses a well-defined crystalline structure. The atomic-resolution imaging of organic–inorganic halide perovskites using traditional high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) remains challenging due to their extreme sensitivity to electron-beam damage. The value of the electron dose in normal HRTEM is around 800–2000 e Å−2 s−1; MAPbX3 is immediately damaged and starts to decompose into PbX2 under this energetic electron radiation. Li et al. revealed that the critical HRTEM imaging doses for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 perovskites are 12 e Å−2, and 46 e Å−2,33 respectively, which are far smaller than normal HRTEM electron doses. It is important to note that the use of a special instrument for obtaining low doses and low temperatures, such as through using cryogenic conditions, can reduce the electron-beam-based damage of hybrid perovskites, and hybrid perovskite may be preserved and stabilized for atomic-scale imaging using cryo-EM at liquid N2 temperatures. High-resolution TEM imaging of Zn–MAPbBr3 reveals a highly ordered crystalline lattice with a clear interplanar distance of 0.29 nm, corresponding to the (200) planes of cubic MAPbBr3, indicating that Zn doping did not change the crystal structure. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, as shown in Fig. 3b, were recorded to clarify the compositions and chemical structures of the MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 samples. We observe very similar curves for the Zn-doped crystals and undoped crystals, and the presence of vibrational modes at 914 cm−1, 970 cm−1, 1467 cm−1, 1578 cm−1, and 3136 cm−1 can be ascribed to the rocking vibrations of CH3NH3+, C–N stretching, asymmetric CH3 bending, asymmetric NH3+ bending, and symmetric NH3+ stretching, respectively, which is in line with previous literature results.34 Furthermore, spectral broadening in the region of the NH3+ stretching vibrations can be seen upon doping with Zn2+ because of stronger interactions than in the case of Pb2+ between the inorganic metal and organic groups through attraction between the Zn 4s and 3d empty orbitals and the lone pair electrons in nitrogen, leading to the electron cloud between the Zn2+ ion and CH3NH3+ being closer to the metal ion.27 The Zn-doped MAPbBr3 sample was further studied through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis in order to understand the doping states of Zn and its bonding behavior. Fig. 3c exhibits the high-resolution Zn 2p and Pb 4f spectra. Zn 2p signal peaks appeared at 1021.5 and 1044.8 eV, as shown in the blue line, clearly demonstrating the successful incorporation of Zn2+ species into the MAPbBr3 crystal structure.19 Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3d, the Pb 4f spectrum of pure MAPbBr3 has two peaks that can be assigned to Pb2+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 at 138.3 and 143.2 eV, respectively, while the peaks of Pb2+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 (138.0 and 142.8 eV, respectively) move to lower binding energies by about 0.3 eV in the Zn–MAPbBr3 spectrum. Zn2+ undergoes stronger chemical interactions with Br2− than Pb2+, which can reduce the Coulombic interactions between extranuclear and core electrons in neighboring Pb2+ ions. Similar trends have been observed in the cases of Zn-doped CsPbI3/CsPbCl319,20 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx thin film.27 Based on the detailed structural, chemical, and bonding characterization outlined above, Zn-doped MAPbBr3, with Zn2+ replacing Pb2+, has been achieved.

It is well known that Pb has 5d10 6s2 6p2 valence electrons; the valence band (VB) maximum of MAPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) is mainly formed from the X p-orbitals mixing with antibonding Pb 6s orbitals, whereas the conduction band (CB) minimum arises mostly from Pb 6p orbitals.9,18 It has been demonstrated that charge-carrier recombination usually takes place from the CB to the VB via a radiative pathway (optical band gap (Eg) = ∼2.2 eV for MAPbBr3 and 1.49 eV for MAZnBr3).18 As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of Zn–MAPbBr3 has a band edge at 530 nm and the PL spectrum possesses a band-edge emission peak at 532 nm, while the PL spectrum of a MAPbBr3 crystal displayed a symmetric broad emission band at 550 nm, which is attributed to charge-carrier recombination through a radiative pathway in the band gap (optical band gap (Eg) = 2.18 eV for MAPbBr3). Similar results have been observed in previous literature studies, indicating that Zn doping has a great impact on the band-gap structure of MAPbBr3.21 Compared with the MAPbBr3 crystal, the PL emission peak position of the Zn-containing perovskite exhibits an 18 nm blue-shift under the same conditions, which is attributed to an increase in the band gap (Eg = 2.34 eV for Zn–MAPbBr3) after Zn doping due to the partial substitution of [PbBr6] octahedra by [ZnBr6], an increase in the interaction strength between B and X atoms, and a decrease in the unit cell volume.17,20 Digital photographs of orange-red MAPbBr3 and orange Zn–MAPbBr3 powder samples and their band gap values from Tauc plots based on the equation αhν = A(hν − Eg)2 are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Moreover, the remarkable homogeneity of the nanocrystal size is also considered as a factor explaining the present large blueshift. Kuang et al. found that a PL peak at a longer wavelength (542 nm) could be assigned to larger particles with a size exceeding 50 nm.35 After post-centrifugation purification via discarding the bottom sediment, the MAPbBr3 nanocrystals showed a uniform size of about 10 nm, together with a narrow PL emission peak centered at 515 nm. In contrast, for CsPbI3 compound systems, it is noted that the peak slightly shifts from 684 nm to 682 nm, which might be attributed to increased band energy upon the introduction of Zn2+.31 Similarly, the Rogach research group observed various PL peak blueshifts, from 690 to 688, 684, 682, and 676 nm, when Zn2+ was alloyed into CsPbI3, which mainly resulted from lattice contraction and a decreased perovskite nanocrystal size.19 A high Zn content can decrease the particle size, which may lead to an increased uptake of iodide ions, inhibiting the further growth of the perovskite. Alternatively, it is anticipated that the initial blueshift in dopant-concentration-dependent PL spectra may be associated with the change in the dopant-ion size, which is responsible for the contraction of the cubic CsPbCl3 unit cell, resulting in a shorter Pb–Cl bond lengths in [PbX6] octahedral;20 the later red-shift can be attributed to an increased Zn content, where the Zn energy levels interact with each other and form a bandlike structure within the host bandgap. In a word, based on the above analysis, the contraction of the cubic unit cell induced by smaller-size Zn dopant ions and the crystal size homogeneity of MAPbBr3 are responsible for the large blueshift seen in the PL spectra.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods were used to determine the specific surface area and porosity. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, compared to MAPbBr3, the Zn–MAPbBr3 N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop at a relative pressure of 0.5–1.0 can be classified as type-IV, implying that large interparticle mesopore voids may exist in the Zn–MAPbBr3 product. From the pore size distribution curve (the inset of Fig. 4d), it is seen that the mesopores are very wide (with diameters ranging from about 5 to 45 nm), and this is attributed to the rough surface of Zn–MAPbBr3 with pits and holes. The BET surface areas of the as-synthesized Zn-doped and undoped MAPbBr3 are calculated to be about 75 and 22 m2 g−1, respectively. The high surface area and type of porosity could have an effect for potential thermoelectric and photocatalytic applications. On one hand, pore interfaces have been proven to be efficient electron and phonon scattering centers, to reduce lattice thermal conductivity, and to improve the Seebeck coefficient. On the other hand, since catalysis is a surface phenomenon, a catalyst with a high surface area can effectively boost surface chemical reactions via increasing the number of active catalytic sites.

Zn–MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 thermoelectric properties. 
Here, aimed at applications involving the conversion of thermal, chemical, and electrical energy, the thermoelectric and photocatalytic properties were measured. The efficiency of any thermoelectric (TE) material is defined by the dimensionless figure-of-merit parameter ZT (defined as (S2σ/k)T, where σ, S, T, and k are the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, and total thermal conductivity, respectively). The Nolas group intensively investigated PbTe thermoelectric nanocomposites compressed from solution-synthesized nanoparticles in 2007.36 Nanocomposites compacted from solution-synthesized particles show several similar important trends in terms of electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient.30,36–40 For instance, different from PbTe bulk samples (>2000 S cm−1) obtained via high-temperature vacuum-based solid-phase reactions, the electrical conductivities of nanocomposites are usually less than 100 S cm−1 due to the highly dense boundaries between nanoparticles. As has been widely reported, the electrical conductivity (σ) is related to the carrier concentration (n) and carrier mobility (μ), and the Seebeck coefficient is inversely related to the carrier concentration, as shown in the following equations:41σ = neμ  where e is the electronic charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, and m* is the density of states effective mass of charge carriers.
The thermoelectric transport measurements were carried out under an Ar atmosphere in order to avoid oxidation, as for the previously reported PbTe-based thermoelectric system.30 Of course, long-term stability is also an important metric for MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3. Apparently, the colors of samples did not change based on naked eye observations, and the XRD patterns (Fig. S3, ESI†) of samples after 3 weeks showed no appreciable changes in the crystal structures of MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3, suggesting the good stability of Zn–MAPbBr3 in air at room temperature.
In the present work, the electrical conductivities were measured using rectangular-shaped bars pressed from MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 powder under identical circumstances to study the electrical transport properties. The typical temperature-dependent electrical conductivities of MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 are illustrated in Fig. 5a. In the temperature range from 300 to 420 K, the electrical conductivity of the Zn–MAPbBr3 sample increases slowly from 1.82 at 300 K to 2.15 S cm−1 at 360 K, then it quickly increases to 3.21 S cm−1 at 420 K, which is in accordance with the previous literature,30,36–39 suggesting that the thermal excitation of carriers through energy barriers (grain boundaries) induced increased conductivity. The energy barriers (Eb) at the grain boundaries of nanocomposites can trap charge and prevent charge carriers from moving across the grains easily. Increasing the temperature promotes thermal motion, and more and more charge carriers receive enough energy to surmount the energy barrier, resulting in an increase in electrical conductivity. To estimate the height of the energy barrier at the grain boundaries (Eb), it can be assumed that the effective electric conductivity behaves according to the following equation:37,38

(b) The trapping of low-energy charge carriers (green solid circles) at the grain boundaries of the nanocomposite, where the red solid circles represent higher-energy charge carriers capable of overcome the grain boundary potential barrier, and the dark solid circles depict self-formed nanoregions within the grains. (c) Plots of ln(σT1/2) vs. 1/(kT) for samples to derive the energy barriers. (d) Seebeck coefficients (S) of pristine MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 between 300 and 420 K.

(f) The photocatalytic activities based on ln(C/C0) vs. time profiles from the degradation of RhB in isopropanol over pristine MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 catalysts. 

Fig. 5b schematically depicts the mechanism of charge transport across the potential barrier at the grain interfaces in the nanocomposite. Charge carriers with energy lower than Eb (green solid circles) get trapped along the grain interfaces, whereas charge carriers with energy higher than Eb (red solid circles) move freely across the grains. Plotting ln(σT1/2) vs. 1/(kT), as shown in Fig. 5c, the straight lines indicate that this assumption is justified, and Eb heights of 135 meV and 56 meV are obtained for MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3, respectively. These values should be compared to the temperature-activated Eb heights ranging from 50 to 140 meV for nanostructured materials fabricated from PbTe nanoparticles obtained by the Nolas group.37,38 This filtration of charge carriers as a result of a grain boundary potential barrier can also enhance the Seebeck coefficient of a nanocomposite. It is worth mentioning that CsSnI3 thin films deposited via solution and co-evaporation routes showed similar maximum electrical conductivity values (6.8 S cm−1 and 7.3 S cm−1).42 In contrast, Tang et al. found that Bi doping dramatically enhanced the electrical conductivity of MAPbBr3, where the electrical conductivity increased sharply from 1.5 × 10−8 S cm−1 in the case of non-doped crystals to 1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 for 15% Bi-doped MAPbBr3.14 Calcabrini et al. observed that doping PbS-based pellets with a suitable nominal concentration of CsPbBr3 improved the electrical conductivity and achieved charge carrier concentrations between 1019 and 1020 cm−3, which are close to the optimal charge carrier concentrations for thermoelectrics.40 We note that Hall measurements in work by Liu et al. showed an increased charge carrier concentration upon air exposure from 2.38 × 1018 to 1.06 × 1019 cm−3 and the Hall mobility decreased from an initial value of 76.1 to 50.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 after Sn2+ oxidation.42 Evidently, Hall measurements allowed us to directly determine the charge carrier concentration (n) and intrinsic carrier mobility (μ). The carrier concentrations of Zn-doped MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 samples are ∼2.15 × 1017 cm−3 and 5.35 × 1016 cm−3 at 300 K, which are in agreement with the carrier densities in hybrid (organo–inorganic) perovskite films (∼3.17–6.65 × 1016 cm−3) measured by Li et al.43 and the carrier density of 3.56 × 1017 cm−3 in a Zn-doped perovskite,17 taking into account sample composition and crystallinity differences. The present obtained carrier mobility (μ) of 30.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the MAPbBr3 sample is consistent with the reported value of 35 ± 2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a MAPbBr3 single crystal, and the μ value of 50.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Zn-doped MAPbBr3 sample is smaller than the value of 96 ± 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for an Er-MAPbBr3 single crystal.37 A previous literature study has shown that doping is beneficial for improving the conductivity and carrier mobility of MAPbBr3 single crystals using Er as a dopant,44 and this is in agreement with our present experimental work.
Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficient reflects the types of carrier present upon a change in temperature, and positive and negative signs represent p- and n-type conduction mechanisms, respectively. It is clearly seen in Fig. 5d that the Zn–MAPbBr3 sample exhibited a significantly enhanced Seebeck coefficient (∼180 μV K−1) (p-type), which is up to 3.6 times larger than that of MAPbBr3 (+50 μV K−1) at 300 K. The positive Seebeck coefficient is the same sign as those of a vertically arranged Au/MAPbBr3/Au structure and undoped MAPbBr3 crystals (p-type);12,14 this is different from results obtained in which 15% Bi3+-doped MAPbBr3 showed a negative Seebeck coefficient (−378 ± 25 μV K−1), indicating that a majority of charge carriers changed after high-valence-state Bi3+ doping.14 In comparison with undoped MAPbBr3, the enhanced positive Seebeck coefficient of Zn–MAPbBr3 reported in this work could also be due to the “energy filtering” found by Nolas and co-workers, in which grain boundaries in the nanocomposite provided an energy filter, allowing only carriers with sufficient energy to pass and thus increasing the total thermopower.37 These grain boundaries were in part associated with the material porosity, which is due to the incoherent nature of interfaces in bottom-up-assembled nanocomposites.30,36–38 Normally, the total thermal conductivity (ktotal) consists of three parts: lattice thermal conductivity (klat), electronic thermal conductivity (kele), and bipolar thermal conductivity (kbip). kele can be easily calculated through the Wiedemann–Franz (WF) relationship (kele = LσT), where L is the Lorenz number (1.5 × 10−8 W Ω K−2).30 So, given the low electrical conductivity observed for our samples, klat represents the majority contributor, and it can be obtained via directly subtracting kele and kbip from ktotal. The cations of the ABX3 halide perovskite provide rattling modes which scatter phonons, enabling ultralow values of thermal conductivity (∼0.43 W m−1 K−1).9,11 Owing to the remarkably improved σ and S values compared to MAPbBr3, high-density Zn–MAPbBr3 bulk samples are expected to be potentially promising thermoelectrics based on special formulation techniques involving spark plasma sintering (SPS) or hot-pressing methods.38


The photocatalytic degradation of Zn–MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. 
To compare the photocatalytic abilities of MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 samples, the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB), which was chosen as a model pollutant, under visible-light irradiation for different time intervals was evaluated. Prior to irradiation, the photocatalytic reaction system was magnetically stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of RhB solution on the surface of the photocatalyst, and a bar plot was used to illustrate the RhB dye adsorption capacity of each catalyst in the dark. A decrease in the absorbance of the chosen dye molecules after exposure to the suspensions was observed. As demonstrated in Fig. 5e, it is observed that Zn–MAPbBr3 shows strong adsorption abilities towards RhB, with an adsorption value of 24.25 mg g−1, which is approximately 3 times that of MAPbBr3 (8.23 mg g−1); this can be attributed to the large surface area and larger number of active adsorption sites of the Zn–MAPbBr3 sample, as based on the N2 adsorption/desorption results. In addition, for comparison, the corresponding photocatalytic activities of undoped and Zn-doped MAPbBr3 are also investigated under the same conditions. It is obvious that no significant degradation of RhB was observed in the absence of photocatalyst under visible-light illumination. Remarkably, upon the addition of the catalysts, plots of C/C0versus exposure time show that 92% of RhB dye molecules were degraded in the presence of Zn–MAPbBr3, while degradation in the presence of MAPbBr3 was 34% after 60 min (Fig. 5f); this is higher than the value reported by Zhang et al. (∼120 min)3 and is comparable to the degradation of methylene blue (MB) within 60 min over CsPbBr3.5 The photocatalytic reaction cycling stability is good; after the 5th cycle, ∼92% removal of RhB still occurs, and the catalysts show no evident structural changes (see Fig. S4 and S5).


The electrochemical properties. 
Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) were obtained to reveal the processes related to the photo-injected charge-carrier dynamics of the obtained products. Fig. 6a shows that the decay traces of MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 could be fitted using triexponential decay kinetics. The derivation of the three components and the intensity–average lifetime (τav) could be calculated using the following equation:τav = (A1τ12 + A2τ22 + A3τ32)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2 + A3τ3).where, for each component, A is the associated coefficient (pre-exponential factor) and τ is the time constant. Significantly, the incorporation of Zn indeed affects the intrinsic optical properties, and the τav values were determined to be 45.3 ns for MAPbBr3 and 26.2 ns for Zn–MAPbBr3; these calculations showed the lifetime of Zn–MAPbBr3 to be ∼2.08 times shorter than that of MAPbBr3, aligning with previous observations showing that Zn-alloyed CsPbI3 composites had shorter lifetimes.19 Also, the calculated lifetime is comparable to a previous value obtained for bare MAPbBr3 nanocrystals (τavg = 41 ns),7 and the value depends on the crystallite size, specific microstructure, and adopted fabrication protocol.

(b) Cyclic voltammetry (CV), (c) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and (d) Mott–Schottky analysis (MS) of Zn–MAPbBr3, showing its p-type semiconducting features. 
Recently, routine electrochemical characterization utilizing optimized solvent engineering has been successfully adopted to detect the charge transfer behaviors of metal halide perovskites.45–48 Linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves were obtained in the dark and under visible-light irradiation conditions to further support our findings relating to the visible-light photoresponsive activity of the Zn–MAPbBr3 sample. As shown in Fig. 6b, although both Zn–MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 samples exhibited poor photocurrent responses under dark conditions, these were improved significantly after light illumination. Clearly, no matter what potential is applied, Zn–MAPbBr3 exhibits a much higher photocurrent than MAPbBr3; the former shows a maximum current density of 0.033 mA cm−2 at 1.2 V, which is over 4 times larger than that of MAPbBr3 (0.008 mA cm−2), suggesting that Zn–MAPbBr3 has a larger number of active carriers during the catalytic reaction under identical conditions. The photogenerated charge carriers easily hop through the thin layers, causing an enhanced carrier concentration and an efficient current density, and similar photoelectrochemical behavior has been observed in the case of CsPbBr3.47 As shown in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data in Fig. 6c, a much smaller semicircular arc can be observed for Zn–MAPbBr3 compared to pristine MAPbBr3, indicating that the charge transfer resistance of Zn–MAPbBr3 is significantly decreased upon the introduction of Zn based on the LSV results. Moreover, Mott−Schottky testing is a widely used technique for obtaining the flat-band potentials (Fermi energy levels) and charge carrier densities of bulk semiconductors in contact with redox electrolytes, and this can give a more thorough understanding of the band gap nature following the Zn doping process. The Mott–Schottky equation can be written as follows:43,47,49,50  where C, ND, and q denote the space charge capacitance, the density of charge carriers, and the electronic charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), respectively, ε and εo refer to the dielectric constant of the semiconductor and permittivity in a vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F·cm−2), respectively, and E and Efb are the applied potential and flat-band potential, respectively. As seen in Fig. 6d, the negative slope in the Mott–Schottky plot indicates p-type semiconducting features, and this is consistent with the obtained Seebeck results and a previous report stating that pristine monodisperse methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) nanoparticles are a p-type semiconductor.6 Er doping could contribute to improved p-type conductivity in a MAPbBr3 single crystal.44 Similarly, Li and co-workers reported that the Efb values of p-type MAPbX3 films are dependent on the preparation conditions (spray- and spin-coating).43 It is well accepted that the intercepts of the negative slopes representing p-type semiconductors can be approximately regarded as the representing the valence band (VB) potential. The potentials vs. Ag/AgCl could be converted to normal hydrogen potentials (NHE) via adding 0.2 V.45 As shown in Fig. 6d, the VB potentials of MAPbBr3 and Zn–MAPbBr3 are 0.82 and 0.98 V vs. Ag/AgCl (1.02 and 1.18 V vs. NHE), respectively. Similarly, Samu et al. reported that the Efb values of p-type MAPbBr3 related to VB potentials are 1.07–1.23 V vs. NHE.46 Furthermore, the conduction band (CB) can be calculated from the VB and the band gap (Eg) based on the equation: Eg = VB–CB; therefore, CB(Zn–MAPbBr3) = 1.18–2.34 = −1.16 V and CB(MAPbBr3) = 1.02–2.18 = −1.16 V. Interestingly, the CB did not change and the VB shifted to a more positive potential due to Zn doping, which is similar to the VB engineering of NiO nanoparticles from 0.37 to 0.45 V vs. NHE via Co doping51 and different from results stating that the addition of Er3+ has no effect on the CB and VB positions of MAPbBr3.44 It is well known that the energetic band positions influence the photocatalytic activity, as a more positive VB position and a more negative CB position will increase the oxidizing and reducing power, respectively, of a perovskite. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency is closely related to the production rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS).50 A potential diagram (Fig. 7) was constructed to provide a semiquantitative comparison of the potentials of various redox markers. It seems that Zn–MAPbBr3 has strong oxidation capacity because it has a low VB edge. Moreover, it is evident that the concentration and transportation of charge carriers also play vital roles in the photocatalytic performance based on the electrical and electrochemical results. Therefore, based on combining the above results, the regulation of energy band levels and the transportation of charge carriers due to Zn doping are effective at optimizing the photocatalytic energy utilization; this can offer information for the design of MAPbX3-based functional hybrids to obtain highly efficient photoredox catalysis and thermoelectric behavior.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a Zn-doped MAPbBr3 composite has been fabricated via a facile solvothermal method. Zn2+ partial substitution could improve the stability of the 3D Zn–MAPbBr3 perovskite and it led to a wide band gap, a high carrier concentration, and a lower VB position. The grain boundaries of the Zn–MAPbBr3 thermoelectric nanocomposite create energy barriers (Eb), leading to thermally activated carrier behavior, which affects the electrical conductivity and positive Seebeck coefficient. Moreover, the strong oxidation abilities and prolonged charge-carrier lifetime of Zn–MAPbBr3 promoted the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds, exhibiting activity that was approximately 3 times higher than pristine MAPbBr3. This work offers a highly efficient doping route and sheds some light on the design and optimization of promising energy conversion and storage materials for photocatalytic and thermoelectric applications based on lead halide perovskites.
