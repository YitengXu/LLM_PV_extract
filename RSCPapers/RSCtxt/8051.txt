    , Accepted 15th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts due to its metal-free nature, abundance of raw material, and thermal physical–chemical stability. The breakthrough research studies in recent years have mostly been concentrated on the engineering of the intrinsic and morphological properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts in the framework of powder suspensions for artificial photosynthesis and environmental remediation. However, practical applications of g-C3N4-based electrodes and devices are still in the early stages of development due to challenging fabrication methods of g-C3N4 thin films. This review addresses the classification of diverse techniques to deposit g-C3N4-based thin films and explores a broad spectrum of applications pertinent to g-C3N4-based electrodes. Although this paper is principally focused on photoelectrochemical water splitting, other emerging applications of g-C3N4 in solar cells, electrocatalysts and supercapacitors are also reviewed.

Introduction
Two of the preoccupations of modern human society are the ever-increasing energy demand and global warming.1,2 Researchers have extensively endeavored to use inexhaustible and renewable solar energy to address these concerns.3 Solar intermittency and fluctuations have urged scientists to suggest and develop numerous techniques to provide permanent sources of electrical energy.4–14 Conversion of sunlight into electricity via solar cells and subsequent storage in batteries and supercapacitors are among the conventional strategies.7–11 Storage of sunlight in the form of hydrogen via room temperature-based photoelectrochemical reactors, however, has proved to be the most propitious technique due to its cost-effectiveness compared with other conventional methods.12–15 Hydrogen can be further employed in CO2 production sites for the synthesis of hydrocarbon fuels or in fuel cells for generation of electric power.16–20
Two dimensional (2D) materials have become the frontiers of materials science due to their excellent optoelectronic and electrocatalytic properties, making investigations into solar energy conversion and storage devices based on 2D materials more prevalent than ever before.21–27 Since its discovery by Wang et al., graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted immense attention in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis due to its excellent optical properties, high thermal physical–chemical stability in basic/acidic media, Earth abundance and environmentally friendly nature.28 The great number of publications on “graphitic carbon nitride”, amounting to above 5700 in the ISI Web of Science, attests to the tremendous popularity of this material. However, significant portions of these publications are concerned with g-C3N4-based powder suspensions for photocatalytic H2 production, CO2 reduction and pollutant degradation.19,24,28–38 This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 where the major bulk of the publications and citations on g-C3N4 is concerned with its photocatalytic applications. Fig. 1 also demonstrates that non-photocatalytic applications of g-C3N4 have been soaring since 2015.

For g-C3N4 research on photocatalysis, the topic keywords were set to [(“graphitic carbon nitride” OR “g-C3N4”) and “photocatal*”]. Obtained from the ISI Web of Science, 16th September 2018. 
To broaden the applications of g-C3N4 beyond photocatalysis necessitates fundamental as well as experimental investigations into the mechanism, properties, and fabrication of g-C3N4 nanostructured electrodes.13,35,39–42 Up to now, several insightful review articles have been inscribed on nanostructuring, doping, heterojunction and copolymerization of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and this research stream is ongoing at a tremendous pace (Fig. 1).24,37,38 Hence, by concentrating on g-C3N4 optoelectronic and photo(electro)catalytic properties in thin-film configurations, we can anticipate the emergence of numerous device applications for energy conversion and storage, sensing and optoelectronics in the following years. Furthermore, practical device applications for environmental remediation, pollutant degradation, wastewater treatment, nitrogen and CO2 reduction and a handful of other applications are foreseeable. In this review article, we initially focus on previous breakthroughs into the fabrication and application of pristine and heterojunction g-C3N4-based photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Other emerging technologies that are made possible via g-C3N4-based thin films such as solar cells, electrocatalysts and supercapacitors are reviewed as well (Fig. 2).

Theory of water splitting
To understand the charge transfer mechanism is the principal step in designing photoelectrodes. The charge transfer mechanism in photoelectrodes differs from that in photocatalysts due to their dissimilar construction and deployment. Photocatalysts are employed as powder suspension systems whereas photoelectrodes are employed as thin films. In this section, the charge transfer mechanism is clarified for photocatalysts in powder suspension systems and for photoelectrodes in PEC devices. It is elucidated that the energy band difference of two semiconductors is the only parameter affecting the charge transfer for photocatalysts. Nonetheless, additional factors such as application of an external bias and order of material deposition tend to alter the charge transfer mechanism in photoelectrodes.
Photocatalytic water splitting
Three types of charge transfer mechanisms occur when two semiconductors interface with one another. In a type (I) heterojunction, both electrons and holes from semiconductor I (SCI) recombine with those of semiconductor II (SCII) due to the more positive conduction band (CB) and less positive valence band (VB) of SCII compared with SCI, respectively. When the CB of SCI is more negative than that of SCII and when the VB of SCII is more positive than that of SCI, a type (II) heterojunction is formed where electrons and holes are correspondingly transferred towards SCII and SCI. In both type (I) and type (II) heterojunctions, electrons and holes move towards lower energy potentials where reduction and oxidation occur, respectively. When band positions are further set off, a broken gap is formed where electrons/holes are excluded from participating in the (reduction/oxidation) redox reaction, regarded as a type (III) heterojunction (Fig. 3).43
 Fig. 3  Three types of charge transfer mechanisms for photocatalysts comprising type (I), type (II) and type (III). 
In all the aforementioned heterojunction types, a spatial charge transfer is generated that enhances the separation of electron/hole pairs due to internal electric field build-up. Band bending at the interface can also facilitate electron transfer from one semiconductor to another. Moreover, electrolyte redox reaction occurs only when a semiconductor possesses carriers with higher energy than the electrolyte thermodynamic potential.24,43 For photocatalysts, therefore, the energy band position of two semiconductors is arguably the only parameter affecting the charge transfer.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting
To comprehend the charge transfer mechanism for photoelectrodes, it is crucial to highlight the differences between photocatalysts and photoelectrodes as to their construction and deployment. For heterojunction photoelectrodes, there is merely one semiconductor while for heterojunction photocatalysts, two semiconductors contact the electrolyte. This is due to the stacking feature of heterojunction photoelectrodes where a semiconductor is deposited on another semiconductor, i.e. in the configuration of planar or core/shell thin films, while heterojunction photocatalysts are suspended in liquid electrolytes (Fig. 4). This fundamental feature results in disparate electron transfer pathways for photoelectrodes arising from the order in which semiconductors are deposited on one another. Moreover, photoelectrodes in PEC systems are operative under direct current (external bias), marking this as another essential parameter to be considered for photoelectrodes.
 Fig. 4  Role of interface: PEC water splitting vs. photocatalytic water splitting. One semiconductor for photoelectrodes and two semiconductors for photocatalysts have an interface with the electrolyte. 

Eqn (1a) represents the generation of electrons (e−) and holes (h+) upon excitation of semiconductors by photons. This results in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), eqn (1b), where holes oxidize water to generate oxygen (O2) and a pair of protons (H+). The extra protons are further reduced by photogenerated electrons, yielding hydrogen gas, referred to as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), eqn (1c). The overall water splitting scheme, comprised of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions via utilization of light, is presented in eqn (1d). Semiconductor + 2hv → 2e− + 2h+(1a) 2h+ + H2O → 1/2O2 + 2H+(1b) 2e− + 2H+ → H2(1c) Semiconductor + H2O + 2hv → 1/2O2 + H2(1d)
For photocatalysts, the oxidation and reduction by-products are generated in close proximity to one another while for photoelectrodes, they are separated. This is because OER and HER half-cells are literally separated via an external wire in PEC reactors. Considering photoanodes, i.e. n-type semiconductors activated under a positive bias, oxygen is generated at the working electrode while hydrogen is produced at the counter electrode. In contrast, for photocathodes, i.e. p-type semiconductors activated under a negative bias, hydrogen and oxygen are produced at the working and counter electrodes, respectively. Although by-products are separated for photoelectrodes, the overall redox reaction is identical for both circumstances where photogenerated electrons/holes split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.44,45

Effect of deposition order. 
The deposition order of two semiconductors, for instance WO3 and g-C3N4, transforms the charge transfer mechanism. Under this circumstance, when WO3 is firstly deposited on FTO (WO3 as the host) with subsequent deposition of g-C3N4 (g-C3N4 as the guest), the electrons from the more negative CB of g-C3N4 are transferred towards the less negative CB of WO3 with holes being transferred from the more positive VB of WO3 towards the less positive VB of g-C3N4, forming a type (II) heterojunction (Fig. 5a). In contrast, when g-C3N4 is deposited as the host with WO3 as the guest, electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 do not move towards the CB of WO3 but directly towards platinum to reduce water. The holes at the VB of WO3 are not transferred toward the VB of g-C3N4, but they directly oxidize water. Furthermore, electrons at the CB of WO3 recombine with holes at the VB of g-C3N4, forming a Z-scheme heterojunction (Fig. 5b).46 Therefore, the deposition order of two semiconductors plays a noteworthy role in determining the transfer pathways of electrons. A more detailed discussion on Z-scheme vs. type (II) heterojunctions in terms of redox potential differences is presented in the subsequent sections of this review article, and in Fig. 20.

Effect of external bias. 
The application of an external bias is one of the major features of photoelectrodes in PEC systems. Although unbiased (unassisted) PEC reactors have been constructed utilizing silicon or III–V semiconductors,47–50 numerous researchers have employed semiconductors that are effectually operational solely under an applied bias, rendering this very feature of photoelectrodes worthy of consideration.
Numerous studies have developed heterojunction photocatalysts based on TiO2@BiVO4 or Fe2O3@BiVO4.43 In these photocatalysts, both oxidation and reduction occur at BiVO4 or Fe2O3 due to their less negative CB and less positive VB compared with TiO2via a type (I) charge transfer mechanism. This type of charge transfer, however, is not applicable for heterojunction photoelectrodes because the electrons or holes would be inhibited from completing the electrical circuit, hence producing zero photocurrent.51 Nonetheless, not only were the photocurrents generated, but unprecedented photocurrent improvements were also attained for photoelectrodes of Fe2O3/TiO2 (ref. 51) and TiO2/BiVO4.52 This necessitates a more complicated explanation for the charge transfer mechanism in PEC systems. Significant breakthroughs were accomplished by researchers to explain this phenomenon via surface defect states;47,52 nevertheless, the debate to elucidate this phenomenon via other possible mechanisms is still ongoing.51
In one insightful study by Barreca et al.,51 the highly positive valence band of TiO2 was expected to inhibit the diffusion of hematite's holes to the electrolyte in the heterostructure of FTO/Fe2O3/TiO2. However, the PEC response of the heterostructure was dramatically higher than that of bare Fe2O3 and TiO2. To probe that, transmission absorption spectroscopy was employed for analysis and detection of diverse types of charge transfers with timescales ranging from milliseconds (ms) to picoseconds (ps). For efficient PEC water splitting, charge transfer is required to occur on ms timescales.53 For bare hematite, decay measurements were detected in the microsecond (μs) range with a significant rise into the millisecond (ms) range upon further increment in the applied external bias.53,54 One possible explanation of this phenomenon is that pathways of hole transfer are facilitated via band bending across the interface which is attributed to the depletion of electrons from the photoanode surface.54 This band bending upon application of a positive bias further affected the valence band and Fermi level of metal oxides, facilitating hole transfer from hematite to TiO2 (Fig. 6a and b).51 Hence, one can infer that applied bias has a significant impact on the energy bands of semiconductors which correspondingly alter the charge transfer mechanism for heterojunction photoelectrodes.

Properties of g-C3N4
Since the re-discovery of g-C3N4, which was obtained by thermal pyrolysis of cyanamide,28 numerous nitrogen-rich precursors such as dicyandiamide, melamine, thiourea or urea have been employed to synthesize g-C3N4.37 Two fundamental tectonic units for the formation of g-C3N4 allotropes are triazine C3N3 (melam) and tri-s-triazine/heptazine C6N7 (melem), with the latter having the most stable phase at ambient temperature.55 The XRD peaks are comprised of two pronounced peaks at 2θ = 27.4° and 2θ = 13.0° with the former corresponding to interlayer stacking of conjugated aromatic units (002) similar to graphite, and the latter being pertinent to the interplanar repeating pattern of melem units (100) formed by hydrogen bonding (Fig. 7a).29

The excessive charge carrier recombination of g-C3N4, attributed to its aromatic pi-system,56,57 leads to its high fluorescence with applications in bioimaging.58 Numerous methods such as liquid exfoliation,41,59 exothermic intercalation,60 thermal oxidation etching,61 and hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment62 have been devised to exfoliate the bulk of graphitic carbon nitride into its 2D counterpart (graphene carbon nitride). These aforementioned methods yielded 2D g-C3N4 with higher surface area via the elimination of its interplanar amino hydroxide bonding with an elevated band gap corresponding to its color change from dark yellow to light yellow. These transformations in optical properties occur due to the well-known quantum confinement effect, elevating the internal generated voltage and effectuating the transport of photogenerated electron/hole pairs.62–64 Since the exfoliation procedure merely affected the interplanar long range order bonding (3500–2500 cm−1), the interlayer short range order bonding of aromatic heterocycles (500–2000 cm−1) remained intact (Fig. 7b–e).41,62 The XPS plots portray C1s bonding that is comprised of two distinct peaks, namely sp2 carbon–carbon bonding (C–C) or (CC) at 284.6 eV and sp2 carbon atoms bonded to nitrogen (C–NC) at 288.1 eV. The N1s consists of four peaks, namely sp2 hybridized carbon–nitrogen bonding (C–NC) at 398.7 eV, sp3 tertiary nitrogen bonding N–(C)3 at 400.3 eV, weak amino hydrogen bonded functional groups (C–N–H) at 401.4 eV, and π-excitations (π → π* transition) at 404.2 eV (Fig. 7f and g).13,65
The type of nitrogen-rich precursor, employed for pyrolysis, had a slight effect on the band structure of g-C3N4.66 The Mott–Schottky plot, which provides information about the flat band potential, yielded a value of −0.6 V vs. RHE for urea,13,67 −0.8 V for dicyandiamide and cyanamide,68,69 and −0.7 V for melamine.70,71 The valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB XPS) plot, which outlines the energy difference between the valence band and the Fermi level,72 yielded a value of 1.56 V for melamine, urea and thiourea,13,66,71 and 1.74 V for dicyandiamide.73 Density of states (DOS) calculations indicate that g-C3N4 possesses a moderate band gap of 2.7 eV that is situated in the visible range (Fig. 7h). Moreover, partial density of states (PDOS) analysis suggests that the VB and CB are respectively positioned at −5.74 eV and −3.07 eV (vs. vacuum) with bands equally comprised of C and N orbitals (Fig. 7i).13,42,74–80
Mechanism of water splitting with g-C3N4
Fundamental insights into the reaction mechanism for oxygen evolution,75–78 CO2 reduction,18–20 nitrogen reduction,79,81 and oxygen reduction can pave the way for comprehending (photo)electrochemical devices.82 Moreover, thorough investigations into the charge separation and transfer mechanism in g-C3N4-based heterostructures13,74,83,84 and photoluminescence mechanism of g-C3N4 can enhance our understanding of the mechanism and development of efficient (opto)electronic devices.80
In a series of insightful fundamental studies by Ehrmaier et al., the reaction mechanism of g-C3N4 for photocatalytic water splitting was investigated.76–78 Hartree–Fock orbitals of molecular heptazine demonstrated orbitals that are exclusively localized for N and C atoms at the HOMO and LUMO, respectively (Fig. 8a and b).76 This is in accordance with our previous PDOS calculations, where the VB of g-C3N4 was principally composed of N orbitals while its CB was mainly comprised of C orbitals (Fig. 7i).13 For molecular heptazine, upon HOMO → LUMO photo-excitation, the electron density is shifted from the N atoms to the C atoms, making the π orbitals of N atoms highly electron deficient.77 Since the HOMO of heptazine is positioned at lower energy levels compared with the VB of liquid water, the electrons are transferred from the H atoms of hydrogen-bonded water molecules to the electron-deficient peripheral N atoms of heptazine (Fig. 8c and d).76 Consecutively, the proton in water follows the electron transfer, culminating in the formation of a heterocyclic radical and OH radical in their ground states (Fig. 8e and f).78 Upon a second photo-excitation, two heterocyclic radicals can combine and produce a molecular hydrogen.77,78,85 Substitution of heptazine with electron-withdrawing groups can diminish the barrier of H atom transfer, and this necessitates further thorough investigations in future studies.76,86 Depletion of hydroxyl radicals in the acidic electrolyte decreases the VB of liquid water and diminishes the transfer of electrons to the HOMO of heptazine. This finding is in harmony with other studies where g-C3N4 photoelectrodes achieved significantly higher photocurrent in alkaline environments compared with acidic ones.87

g-C3N4 thin-film fabrication methods
Numerous methods have been developed to deposit g-C3N4 photoelectrodes on substrates. These methods are classified as disperse coating, liquid mediated growth, thermal vapor condensation, solvothermal deposition, electrophoretic deposition and other deposition techniques that are elaborated in this section. This part addresses the techniques for fabricating pristine and functionalized (i.e. metal/non-metal doped and surface co-catalyst integrated) g-C3N4 photoelectrodes with focus on their morphological and PEC properties.
Disperse coating
Disperse coating from the source of colloids is among the most facile and cost-effective methods due to low temperature processing. However, most of the g-C3N4 photoelectrodes fabricated in this fashion have poor contact with the substrate, which results in a low photocurrent response of less than 1 μA cm−2.68,88 As a result, researchers have investigated various parameters of g-C3N4 colloids in terms of chemical bonding and size of particles to optimize the uniformity and performance of the pristine g-C3N4 photoelectrodes.41,69
In one study by Zhang et al., acid-treated g-C3N4 demonstrated no hydrogen bonding, confirmed via a quenched (100) XRD peak, enabling it to form a stable colloid. The thin films, however, recovered the hydrogen bonding upon annealing and generated a continuous network of defect-less and mechanically stable g-C3N4 thin films with higher PEC response in comparison with powder-based thin films.69
Employment of other mild environmentally friendly solvents was addressed in our previous study where pure methanol was employed as an intercalator and disperser, simultaneously.41 The employment of methanol not only facilitated the spreadability of the dispersion on the substrate but also diminished the drying time.41 The intrinsic properties of g-C3N4 could be maintained via an n-type positively biased PEC response, compared with acid treated g-C3N4 where the activation occurred under a negative bias.60,69 Large dark currents were observed under a positive bias for acid treated g-C3N4,60,89 which could be avoided upon methanol exfoliation. Exfoliated g-C3N4 demonstrated more uniformity on the FTO substrate compared with its bulk counterpart.41
Liquid mediated growth
Liquid mediated growth involves heating the substrate together with abundant sources of nitrogen-rich precursors. As a result, the nitrogen-rich precursors turned into the liquid phase, followed by condensation on substrates to form solid g-C3N4.87,90–94 Supramolecular assembly of g-C3N4 even effectuates the liquid mediated growth, since it employs precursors with identical chemical structures to g-C3N4.95 Shalom et al. utilized this method to generate ordered structures of g-C3N4via hydrogen bonds between a cyanuric acid–melamine (CM) complex. The CM complex was positioned between two substrates followed by annealing which resulted in thin films with thicknesses of ∼40 nm. Due to the presence of free hydroxyl and amine groups in the CM complex, diverse morphologies of g-C3N4 could be obtained on varying substrates. This strategy yielded the formation of g-C3N4 nanorods which appeared more organized on glass compared with FTO. The presence of glass initiated the growth of ordered structures while the absence of glass culminated in sheet-like formation. The developed electrode functioned as a hydrogen evolution catalyst (HEC), generating a current with a value of 0.8 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 0.6 V vs. RHE in neutral media.90 Inspired by the aforementioned method, Xu et al. obtained thicker thin films (∼500 nm on TiO2 and ∼10 μm on FTO) by placing the CM complex directly on top of FTO in a crucible.91 The mechanical robustness of the thin film fabricated using liquid mediated growth was very high, yielding thin films that were not peeled off by ultrasonication in water.91 Due to strong contact of g-C3N4 films with the substrate, a photocurrent of 5.6 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved. Incorporation of nickel that functioned as active catalytic sites was conducive to dramatic photocurrent enhancement up to 69.8 μA cm−2.92
The incorporation of sulfur-containing thiourea into melamine achieved a photocurrent of approximately 30 μA cm−2.93 In fact, molten sulfur integrated a phenyl group into g-C3N4 which consequently introduced sub-bands and yielded a photocurrent of 60 μA cm−2.94 In one insightful and remarkable study by Fang et al. diverse morphologies were obtained via the combination of sulfur and non-sulfur compounds. Not only could sulfur function as a seed layer for the formation of g-C3N4, but it could also facilitate charge transportation between g-C3N4 and the substrate (Fig. 9). The films demonstrated excellent mechanical robustness under ultrasonication for 4 h. A champion photocurrent response of 100 μA cm−2 was achieved for porous films, constructed via the combination of melamine and trithiocyanuric acid.87 Conducting a four-point probe test is highly recommended in the aforementioned study and the conductivity of these films requires further attention.

Thermal vapor condensation
Thermal vapor condensation (TVC) methods employ the vapors of nitrogen-rich molecular precursors to sublimate on substrates in a fashion identical to widely recognized chemical vapor deposition (CVD).96–101 Bian et al. discovered that melamine, compared with dicyandiamide, thiourea and urea, achieves the highest uniformity in depositing thin films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm. The morphology of g-C3N4 was found to be strongly substrate-dependent, demonstrating a higher surface roughness on glass compared with ITO and silica. Moreover, different ranges of thickness from 35 to 126 nm could be obtained by varying the weight percentages of melamine as well as by altering the temperature. A color change from light yellow to dark yellow occurred as the temperature increased from 500 °C to 600 °C that manifested itself via enhanced crystallization of g-C3N4. For a condensation temperature of 600 °C, a photocurrent of 0.12 mA cm−2 at 1.55 V vs. RHE was achieved in the presence of hole scavengers. The photocurrent, without hole scavengers, is diminished by approximately four times, confirming the strong dependence of g-C3N4 on the surface co-catalyst, desirable for future investigations (Fig. 10a–h).97

Lu et al. fabricated a g-C3N4 thin film by sublimation of thiourea, achieving a remarkable photocurrent of 89 μA cm−2 at 1.1 V vs. RHE. This was attained by increasing its thickness to around 2 μm that could enable it to effectively absorb sunlight for efficient generation of electrons and holes. However, the very thick nature of g-C3N4 hindered charge transfer and the effective separation of electron–hole pairs, leading to large values of dark current (Fig. 10i and j). The surface kinetics of g-C3N4 could be further improved via FeOOH, achieving a photocurrent of 0.12 mA cm−2.99 Due to lack of conductivity and excessive recombination in thicker layers of g-C3N4 photoelectrodes, employment of other techniques such as surface plasmon resonance is recommended for effective light absorption.102–104
Solvothermal deposition
Solvothermal deposition involves placing the substrate in precursor solutions of semiconductors in an organic solvent. The solution then undergoes reaction at a certain temperature and pressure, forming various nanostructures via the seed-growth mechanism.105,106 In one study, Xie et al. deposited g-C3N4 on FTO via dissolving cyanuric chloride and melamine in acetonitrile, followed by annealing at 520 °C. The solvothermally treated samples (CN-h) displayed a significantly higher photocurrent response in comparison with standard g-C3N4 prepared from melamine powder (CN-p) due to strong contact with the substrate. The Stranski–Kranstanov growth method leads to the formation of microspheres with diameters of 2–3 μm connected by various nanoparticles that remained unaltered upon annealing (Fig. 11a–h).105

In a study by Gu et al., g-C3N4 thin films were developed on FTO via a similar step, employing cyanuric acid instead of melamine. Loosely stacked heptazine units were formed by coupling reactions of the precursor with hydroxyl groups on the FTO surface. The solvothermally deposited g-C3N4 was further condensed into a polymeric network of g-C3N4 upon further annealing at 450 °C. This condensation manifested itself by thickness reduction from 375 nm for un-annealed g-C3N4 (CNBC-U) to 125 nm for annealed g-C3N4 (CNBC) (Fig. 11i–o).106 The higher PEC performance of this technique, compared with conventional paste-prepared g-C3N4, was attributed to the presence of covalent linkage between solvothermally grown g-C3N4 and the substrate, introduced by either cyanuric acid or cyanuric chloride, which enhances the charge carrier transportation. Moreover, due to enhanced π-electron delocalization of the conjugated structure, both studies reported a diminished band gap of 2.0 eV, i.e. 0.7 eV lower than that of conventional g-C3N4, widening the sunlight absorption range.105,106
Electrochemical deposition
Two types of electrochemical deposition exist, namely electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and electrodeposition (ED). The former involves adsorption of charged particles onto externally biased electrodes,46,72,107,108 and the latter, ionic precipitation.13,109,110 Both types of electrochemical deposition methods have been employed for fabricating g-C3N4 photoelectrodes.46,72,107–109 Li et al. dissolved cyanuric acid and melamine in acetonitrile for electrodeposition of g-C3N4 on p-Si under a positive bias. The physical characteristics demonstrated the successful formation of g-C3N4. Nevertheless, its further applications were hindered by later researchers due to the high voltage requirement (1200 V) and long deposition time (3 h) for the attainment of films with a thickness of 500 nm.109
Employing EPD, Xu et al. deposited g-C3N4 under anodic bias via a suspension of toluene at 200 V. Toluene was employed due to its large electrochemical window that prevented the decomposition of the solvent. The g-C3N4 particles were deposited on the positively charged FTO, confirming the negative induced charge of g-C3N4 particles. The films deposited on carbon paper (carbon fiber) demonstrated a significantly higher photocurrent of 12 μA cm−2 compared with 1 μA cm−2 on FTO. This was attributed to the high surface area of the three dimensional structure of carbon paper that provided efficient g-C3N4 contact and higher surface area with the electrolyte. The photoelectrodes demonstrated a photocurrent response of nearly 65 μA cm−2 upon doping with barbituric acid (BA), enhancing the conductivity and light absorption via heteroatom doping (Fig. 11p–u).107 In another attempt to fabricate a free-standing aerogel, Hou et al. developed 3D foam comprised of nitrogen deficient porous g-C3N4 (DPCN), employing 3D N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) as an electron mediator and nickel–iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) as an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC). Being electrophoretically deposited on FTO, a high photocurrent of 72.9 μA cm−2 was achieved that was attributed to the high surface area of the 3D network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the OEC prevented its photocorrosion, retaining 98% of its photocurrent for 2000 seconds of stability testing (Fig. 11v and w).111
In another study by Samanta et al., a nanocomposite was fabricated by incorporating metallic Au nanoparticles into g-C3N4. The Au@g-C3N4 electrophoretically deposited from a solution of iodine-acetone demonstrated an outstanding photocurrent of 49.5 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which was 3000 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4. The simultaneous improvement of light absorption and electron collective properties of Au led to the remarkable performance of the nanocomposite.112 The utilized deposition–precipitation technique for coupling of Au and g-C3N4 was a crucial measure to consider, since other deposition methods such as photodeposition or impregnation demonstrated a significantly lower performance.113 This study is of paramount significance for future investigations and further analyses of thin film quality, dark current measurement, and long-term photocurrent stability, to name a few. Thorough understanding of metallic nanoparticle reduction and subsequent grafting onto g-C3N4 is highly desired in future studies. For detailed progress in metal@g-C3N4 and numerous other nanocomposites, readers can refer to a remarkable review by Ong et al.37
Other deposition methods
Numerous techniques such as anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane deposition,114,115 vacuum filtration deposition,89,116 vacuum magnetic filtered arc ion plating (VMFAIP),40 electrospinning (ESP),117 doctor blade coating (DBC),118 and ionothermal (molten salt) deposition39 were developed for the fabrication of g-C3N4 electrodes. Liu et al. fabricated nanostructures of g-C3N4 by injecting cyanamide into an AAO membrane and placing it between two substrates, followed by calcination at 550 °C. The nanostructured photoelectrode consisted of nano-islands and microstructures, where nano-islands were interlinked via microstructures. The resultant thin film achieved a photocurrent density of 30.2 μA cm−2 resulting from intimate contact with the substrate and light scattering in nanostructures. Moreover, the thickness tailorability in ranges from ∼100 nm to ∼2 μm could be obtained by varying the concentration of cyanamide (Fig. 12a–e).114

In another experiment by Wang et al., g-C3N4 was deposited on ITO via electrospinning of exfoliated g-C3N4 that was obtained from dicyandiamide, under 12 kV of applied voltage, followed by annealing at 500 °C. The photoelectrode achieved a uniform deposition with a photocurrent of nearly 0.2 μA cm−2. Further addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) could enhance the photocurrent to nearly five times, attributed to its reduced band gap up to 2.38 eV (Fig. 12f–h).117 Vacuum filtration was also employed by numerous researchers. In this fashion, g-C3N4 was injected into a cellulose membrane, followed by dissolution of the membrane in acetone, leaving a free-standing film that could be transferred to any desired substrate.89,116 In another technique developed by Ladva et al., flexible thin films of g-C3N4 were fabricated via vapors of dicyandiamide, KBr and LiBr at 600 °C under vacuum with no carrier gas. Interestingly, the hydrogen generation rate was remarkably improved upon incorporation of platinum, necessitating more studies into surface co-catalysts.39 However, further characterization and performance analysis are required to be conducted in this important study.39 Alkaline surface activation is yet another promising route for further investigations, since it improves the surface adsorption and surface kinetics of organic materials.119–122
Recently, Wang et al. developed a method where carbon plasma, emitted from a graphite substrate, is deflected via a magnetic field and combined with nitrogen gas and co-deposited on a FTO substrate. This method which attained large-area photoelectrode sizes (up to meter scales) formed nanorods with a diameter of 200 nm and a length of 700 nm. g-C3N4 demonstrated no hydrogen bonds due to the utilization of carbon and nitrogen alone. Moreover, increasing the current through a graphite susceptor elevated the carbon content in g-C3N4 and could consequently alter its band gap. However, abundance of carbon sources was detrimental to the PEC response of samples, as it produced abundant defect sites (Fig. 12i–l).40Table 1 presents the photocurrent comparison for photoelectrodes based on pristine and doped g-C3N4.

Although diverse techniques have been developed to fabricate g-C3N4 electrodes, tremendous space still exists for devising efficient strategies for electrode fabrication. One promising strategy is the employment of diverse treatment methods (physical/chemical) on g-C3N4 thin films. These treatments can affect the morphology and surface chemistry of the thin film, possibly producing defect sites,123 which can enhance the charge transfer between g-C3N4 and another semiconductor or catalytic reactions with the electrolyte. Furthermore, the ionothermal (molten salt) approach which yields a band gap of 1.6–2 eV is highly recommended for further investigation.39,124 Besides the aforementioned techniques, other emerging methods such as spray/aerosol-based coating are desirable for further experimentation.125–128
Water splitting applications
Numerous efforts have been made to construct g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts. Nevertheless, the photocurrent was limited to only a few microamperes due to imperfect contact between the photocatalysts and the substrate. In contrast, the growth of heterojunction thin-films on substrates facilitated interfacial contact between the two components and between thin films and substrates, yielding a superior photocurrent response and prolonged lifetime of charge carriers.42,74,129–131 In this section, numerous photoelectrode architectures are presented, involving semiconductors in a heterojunction with g-C3N4 as a host, guest, and composite.
g-C3N4 as a guest
Several research groups examined the decoration of various semiconductors with g-C3N4. Diverse properties including light absorption, charge transportation and water oxidation kinetics were enhanced upon coating with g-C3N4. Some of the methods reviewed in this section are identical to those in the previous section. Other techniques such as solution dip coating and dispersion dip coating are introduced in this section.

Disperse/drop coating. 
Numerous researchers decorated semiconductors via dropping or spin-coating a g-C3N4 dispersion.132–135 Feng et al. dropped an exfoliated NH4Cl-treated g-C3N4 dispersion in ethylene glycol on top of a BiVO4 photoelectrode and achieved a spectacular PEC performance compared with metal-based co-catalysts and bulk g-C3N4. In addition, the photoelectrode demonstrated a stable hydrogen generation performance for 150 min with no degradation (Fig. 13a–d).132 This implied that g-C3N4 was an excellent hole extractor, as was displayed for ZnO/g-C3N4, where nearly all the holes were collected from the ZnO photoelectrode.136 The outstanding PEC performance could be attributed to the role of NH4Cl in modifying the electronic structure of g-C3N4. Interestingly, treatment of g-C3N4 in HCl also resulted in superior PEC performance of Ti:Fe2O3.137 In fact, chloride ions were demonstrated to switch g-C3N4 from n-type to p-type, thus forming a p–n junction at its interface with BiVO4 or Fe2O3.138 In a different study, drop-coating of a CoSe2@g-C3N4 composite on a p-type silicon photocathode demonstrated a higher stability compared with pristine CoSe2.139 This was due to effective transportation of charge carriers via g-C3N4 that hindered recombination on CoSe2, further impeding the degradation of the silicon photocathode.133

Xu et al. dipped a Cu2O photocathode into an exfoliated g-C3N4 dispersion in water followed by WS2 deposition, achieving a remarkable photocurrent density with a value of −9.5 mA cm−2 at −0.55 V vs. RHE. Nonetheless, further investigation is required on this high performance ternary heterojunction.135 Xiao et al. spin coated a g-C3N4 dispersion in ethanol that was derived from tripolycyanamide and was thermally etched on top of ZnO nanowires (ZnONW), attaining a perfect fine coverage. The ternary heterojunction was formed by photo-depositing platinum on top of ZnO/g-C3N4/Pt or in sandwiched form (ZnO/Pt/g-C3N4). The photocurrent performance of ZnO/g-C3N4/Pt was higher than that of ZnO/g-C3N4 due to the surface catalytic functionalities of platinum. However, the photocurrent response of ZnO/Pt/g-C3N4 was dramatically higher than that of the two heterojunctions, demonstrating the importance of solid-state-mediators in charge transportation of two semiconductors (Fig. 13e–g).134


Liquid mediated growth. 
Liquid mediated growth has been utilized to sensitize numerous semiconductors such as CdS nanorods (CdSNR),140 TiO2,74,141 and ZnO,136 resulting in a dense (∼5 nm) g-C3N4 film that uniformly covered metal oxides. Albero et al. performed transient decay analysis and discovered very efficient electron transfer pathways from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of TiO2 (path 2, Fig. 14) and also low recombination rates from the CB of TiO2 with the VB of g-C3N4 (path 4, Fig. 14), suggesting the effective separation of electrons. Nevertheless, the ineffective diffusion of holes from the VB of g-C3N4 to the electrolyte (path 3, Fig. 14) was the bottleneck that diminished the PEC performance.74 This brings forth the importance of co-catalysts for improvement of surface kinetic reactions of g-C3N4, which requires further research.42,142

In one study by Xu et al., g-C3N4 was coated on mesoporous TiO2 and the photocurrent was enhanced from 0.045 mA cm−2 for bare TiO2 to 1.4 mA cm−2 for the heterojunction photoelectrode. They also studied the doping effect of BA heteroatoms on the performance of g-C3N4/TiO2. Although enhanced light absorbance was achieved upon BA incorporation into the heterojunction thin film, the photocurrent was lowered to 0.7 mA cm−2 due to high content of carbon doping that increased the defect levels and led to excessive charge recombination. The positive shift in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) reduction peak of the heterojunction compared with bare-TiO2 indicated the creation of a new electron transfer mechanism for g-C3N4 sensitized TiO2, suggesting the successful coupling of TiO2 with g-C3N4 (Fig. 15a–d).141

The liquid mediated growth method yielded uniform ultrathin decoration of ZnONW, further enhancing the photocurrent of pristine unmodified ZnO by 3.5 times. As an effective holes extraction layer, g-C3N4 improved the transfer of holes from ZnO to the electrolyte. The LSV plots demonstrated nearly complete diffusion of holes to the electrolyte, because the photocurrent reached an identical value in the presence of a hole scavenger (Fig. 15e–g).136


Thermal vapor condensation. 
Various efforts have been made in sensitizing semiconductors such as Fe2O3,143 ZnO,144 Y:ZnO,131 CuInS,145,146 and TiO2 nanostructures147–150via thermal vapor condensation (TVC) of nitrogen-rich precursors. This method often resulted in the formation of ultra-small g-C3N4 particles in the form of quantum dots.143,147–150 Quantum dot (0D) semiconductors possess enhanced photocatalytic properties compared with their bulk counterparts (3D) owing to their widened band structures that enhanced redox capability and open circuit voltage.151–153 The g-C3N4 quantum dots (gCNQD) even demonstrated up-conversion properties via two photon absorption, i.e. one shorter wavelength photon was emitted upon absorbing two larger wavelength photons.58,153 In this part of the review on TVC, the effect of nitrogen-rich precursor materials on the PEC and morphological properties of TiO2 nanostructures is investigated.
An et al. synthesized TiO2 nanowires (TiO2NW) with gCNQD and achieved a 2.5 times photocurrent enhancement compared with bare TiO2NW, reaching 3.4 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under 300 mW cm−2 light intensity. The growth method can be summarized via the vaporization and polymerization of dicyandiamide on TiO2NW that yielded gCNQD with sizes of 5 ± 2 nm. The decorated gCNQD was easily detached from TiO2NW by ultrasonication of the substrate in water, being probably the reason for its low PEC stability. The analysis of gCNQD further demonstrated a photoluminescence emission peak at around 365 nm corresponding to a band gap of 4.59 eV (Fig. 16a–e).148

Sun et al. developed a heterojunction with TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2NT) via TVC, employing melamine as the precursor. The photocurrent of undecorated TiO2NT was enhanced by 1.87 times under visible light. The samples demonstrated highly stable photocurrents for 1 h of testing with no photocurrent loss (Fig. 16f–i). The excellent stability of this thin film demonstrated that g-C3N4 particles had stronger contact with TiO2NT, resulting in fewer defect sites and less photo-corrosion.149 However, the photocurrent enhancement factor (1.87 times) was lower than that for dicyandiamide coated TiO2NW (2.5 times), due to coverage of g-C3N4 only on top of TiO2NT, whereas dicyandiamide anchored g-C3N4 all around TiO2NW. The findings of these two studies are in accord with that of TVC via melamine for fabricating pristine g-C3N4, where melamine attained more mechanically robust thin films in comparison with dicyandiamide.97 The mechanical robustness consequently implies more efficient contact, enhanced charge transportation and, hence higher stability.
In their remarkable study, Li et al. decorated TiO2NT and Ti sheet with g-C3N4, employing melamine as a precursor. TiO2NT produced smaller QDs (∼2 nm) due to the confinement effect that hindered gathering and leaching of g-C3N4. Surprisingly, the Ti sheet formed significantly larger grain sizes of 70 nm with randomly dispersed g-C3N4 nanoparticles (Fig. 16j–m). The decorated TiO2NT could also be activated by lower wavelength of light (550–750 nm) due to the up-conversion properties of quantum dots. The high stability of the photoelectrode was caused by strong interaction of gCNQD with TiO2NT that restrained leaching and gathering of gCNQD. This strong interaction was proved by a 0.4 eV negative shift in the O1S XPS spectrum compared with that of TiO2 that confirmed the strong electronic interaction between TiO2 and g-C3N4.150 It can be concluded that vapors of melamine have high attachment capability and, as a result, higher stability and photocurrent enhancement. Another factor that may contribute to the deposition of g-C3N4 on TiO2 is the surface affinity of TiO2 nanostructures with the vapors of melamine and dicyandiamide and their respective sublimation, which requires more extensive investigation. Furthermore, the density of TiO2 nanostructures plays a crucial role, since more voids and spaces allow more infiltration of vapors, yielding efficient coverage.
In one study by Fang et al., a type (II) Y:ZnO/g-C3N4 heterostructure was constructed via the sublimation of melamine vapors on top of Y:ZnO. This photoanode demonstrated a photocurrent of 0.4 mA cm−2, excellent stability up to 160 minutes with 95% photocurrent retention capability, and mechanical robustness upon ultrasonication in water for 2 h. This study is of paramount significance, since it highlights the importance of the conductive charge-carrier collector host layer in g-C3N4-based type (II) heterojunction photoelectrodes.131


Solution dip coating. 
Numerous semiconductors such as silicon nanowires,154 WO3,129 and TiO2 (ref. 130 and 155) were decorated by g-C3N4via placing semiconductor photoelectrodes in a room-temperature solution of nitrogen-rich precursors, followed by annealing at high temperatures. This method is more economical compared with TVC, as it does not produce wasted g-C3N4 residues in the crucible. Dipping semiconductors in solutions of cyanamide/dicyandiamide obtained a uniform coating on nanostructures.130,154 In one experiment by Su et al., TiO2NT was dipped into the ethylene glycol solution of dicyandiamide, 2-aminobenzonitrile (ABN), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BmimPF6). ABN improved the pi-electron delocalization via phenylene groups and BmimPF6 functioned as a phosphor source (P-g-C3N4). After 12 h of dipping in the precursor solution, the electrode was taken out and annealed at 540 °C in an argon atmosphere. The FESEM results illustrated good coverage of ultra-small g-C3N4 particles on TiO2NT. The TiO2NT/P-g-C3N4 heterojunction photoelectrode maintained its photocurrent of nearly 2 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl over the course of 5 h with no loss (Fig. 17a–d).130

Li et al. dipped a TiO2 substrate into a methanolic solution of urea for 30 min followed by annealing at 550 °C for 3 h. Further deposition of cobalt phosphate (Co-pi) produced stable photocurrents for 10 h. However, due to non-uniform coverage of g-C3N4, a slight reduction in stability was observed (Fig. 17e–h).155 The higher stability of TiO2NT/P-g-C3N4 was likely caused by the more enhanced deposition of g-C3N4 from the solution of ethylene glycol, compared with that of methanol. This finding was also in accordance with the disperse coating fabricated BiVO4/g-C3N4 from ethylene glycol solution, where perfect g-C3N4 coverage and a spectacular PEC response were reported.132
In another study by Zhan et al., the solution of urea in water yielded uniform decoration over WO3 platelets that resulted in an increased surface roughness for heterojunction photoelectrodes (Fig. 17i–k).129 Interestingly, g-C3N4 coating on WO3 had no effect on the light absorption which confirmed that the enhanced performance was largely due to separation of photogenerated carriers.129,156 In fact, thin layers of g-C3N4 demonstrated a window effect, where WO3 absorbs longer wavelength of photons that are not absorbed by g-C3N4.157


Dispersion dip coating. 
Several photoelectrodes such as Ba–TaON,158 Cu2O,67 Ti–Fe2O3,137 WO3,156,157,159 and TiO2 (ref. 160) were decorated with g-C3N4via dipping into a dispersion of g-C3N4 nanoparticles, followed by annealing at moderate temperatures. This method is more cost-effective compared with solution dip coating. The reason is that solution dip coating utilizes solutions of nitrogen-rich precursors which need to be converted to g-C3N4 at high temperatures. Dispersion dip coating does not require high processing temperature, since it utilizes the pre-crystallized particles of g-C3N4. In the early endeavors for the application of this method, WO3 wires were utilized; yet, due to the lower surface area of wires, the photocurrent enhancement factor was only 1.13 times.157 Other experiments employed semiconductors deposited on substrates, resulting in a higher photocurrent enhancement factor, which is discussed in this section.
The exfoliated g-C3N4, obtained from melamine and dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA), was utilized by numerous researchers for sensitization of semiconductors.156–159 Li et al. dipped WO3 nanosheets (WO3NS) in an exfoliated g-C3N4 dispersion in IPA for various 1 h cycles with intermediary nitrogen drying between the cycles followed by final annealing at 400 °C. Upon employing seawater as an electrolyte, the photocurrent was doubled, reaching a value of 0.73 mA cm−2. The heterojunction was approximately stable but degradation was observed after 1 h that can be due to less uniform coverage of WO3 by g-C3N4 (Fig. 18a–d).159 In a different experiment by Hou et al., the Ba–TaON nanostructure was dipped into an exfoliated g-C3N4 dispersion in IPA, with intermediary nitrogen drying, followed by further annealing at 350 °C. However, the stability was degraded unless protected by additional CoOx that enhanced the diffusion of photogenerated holes towards the electrolyte and resulted in a higher stability (Fig. 18e–h).158 The stability performance degradation using this method was resolved via dipping WO3 nanoplates into a g-C3N4 dispersion in IPA for various times without intermediary drying steps.156

g-C3N4 dispersions in solvents dissimilar to IPA have been investigated by other researchers.137,160 In an experiment by Liu et al., electrodeposited Ti:Fe2O3 nanoplates were dipped into a g-C3N4 dispersion in water with various concentrations, followed by final annealing at 500 °C.137 The g-C3N4 was etched with HCl prior to use.161 This strategy yielded spectacular enhancement in photocurrent density reaching nearly 2.55 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 18i–m).137 The results were exceptionally higher than those for TVC decoration of un-doped Fe2O3.143 This exceptional performance could be attributed to the incorporation of chloride ions which transformed g-C3N4 from n-type into p-type138 and resulted in p–n junction formation at the interface with Fe2O3. Another reason for this remarkable performance could be the importance of conductive charge carrier scaffolds in doped photoanodes, which requires specific attention in future studies.131 Application of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) binders with gCNQD for decoration of TiO2 is another suitable approach that was investigated by Su et al. The process included dipping TiO2NT in a dispersion of gCNQD with 1% MPA at 80 °C for 12 h, followed by further rinsing and drying at room temperature. The photoelectrode demonstrated more stable photocurrents as compared with other dispersion dip coating methods probably resulting from strong affinity of TiO2 with carboxylate groups of MPA that prevented photo-corrosion (Fig. 18n–p).160


Solvothermal/hydrothermal deposition. 
Both solvothermal and hydrothermal techniques were employed to decorate semiconductors with g-C3N4.52,106 In an attempt by Gu et al., the solvothermal deposition of g-C3N4 on TiO2 resulted in nearly 1.25 times photocurrent enhancement compared with bare TiO2. This photocurrent enhancement was achieved upon further annealing of hydrothermally deposited g-C3N4, since the un-annealed g-C3N4 demonstrated even lower photocurrent compared with bare TiO2. This was due to the low conductivity of un-annealed g-C3N4 and energy band mismatch between un-annealed g-C3N4 and TiO2, both impeding the diffusion of holes towards the electrolyte (Fig. 19a–c).106

In another design by An et al., a ternary photoelectrode heterojunction was fabricated via decorating a TiO2/BiVO4 thin film with gCNQD, achieving 1.2 fold photocurrent augmentation compared with pristine TiO2/BiVO4. This photocurrent enhancement was attributed to highly energetic electrons of g-C3N4 with a remarkable electron injection rate of 2.62 × 107 s−1. The gCNQD was prepared by HNO3 and H2SO4 treatment of g-C3N4, followed by further treatment in a dialysis bag for several days. With the employment of a gCNQD dispersion in water, the hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C yielded fine coverage over TiO2/BiVO4 (Fig. 19d–f).52


Electrophoretic deposition. 
Electrophoretic deposition has been applied to deposit g-C3N4 on numerous semiconductors.46,72,108,162,163 In primary attempts by Dong et al., a NiO photocathode was decorated with a g-C3N4 dispersion in IPA and Mg(NO3)2 under a negative voltage of 160 V. The fabricated p–n junction enhanced the photocurrent by nearly 10 times with respect to NiO and demonstrated stability for up to 4 h.108 Zhang et al. sensitized a Cu2O photocathode with a g-C3N4 dispersion in acetone and iodine under a negative voltage of 50 V. As a result of heterojunction formation, the photocurrent reached a value of −1.38 mA cm−2, enhancing the photocurrent of bare Cu2O by nearly 6.27 times. In addition, g-C3N4 could passivate Cu2O, displaying higher stability during 20 min of testing (Fig. 19g–k).162 The deposition of sulfur-rich g-C3N4 on top of a CIGS/CdS film could not only enhance the photocurrent by two times but also stabilize the bare CIGS/CdS film for 20 h of operation.163 These results imply the high stability of g-C3N4 under photoreduction, recommending further investigation into the passivation of other unstable photocathodes by g-C3N4.
As was discussed in previous sections, the platinum functioned as a spectacular solid state mediator between g-C3N4 and ZnO.134 In a quest for low-cost metal-based mediators, Li et al. examined the effect of metals with high conductivity such as copper, silver and gold as solid-state mediators. Remarkably, among the utilized metals, copper demonstrated the highest PEC response, confirmed to be caused by the position of its Fermi level, relative to individual g-C3N4 and WO3. g-C3N4 was deposited on WO3via an analogous method for the abovementioned NiO decoration. Without solid state mediators, the electrons flowed from photosystem I (PSI) with a higher Fermi level to photosystem II (PSII) with a lower Fermi level. However, the presence of copper yielded enhanced charge transfer due to its Fermi level which falls between the Fermi level of PSI and that of PSII. In contrast, when the Fermi level of the solid state mediator lied above or below that of PSI and PSII, no charge transfer was observed due to the formation of energy band barriers that blocked the movement of electrons (Fig. 19l–r).72 Hence, solid state mediators can dramatically augment the charge transfer between two semiconductors when they are appropriately chosen regarding their Fermi energy level.

g-C3N4 as a host (Z-scheme)
Although numerous studies have been conducted on photoelectrodes, employing g-C3N4 as a guest, few studies have addressed the utilization of g-C3N4 as a host.13,46,164 This is principally caused by the challenges in producing uniform and pin-hole free layers of g-C3N4 that restrain further development of this configuration of photoelectrodes. When g-C3N4 was applied as a host layer with subsequent deposition of n-type semiconductors, the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism was constructed.13,46 This is due to the more negative CB of g-C3N4 than most of the existing n-type semiconductors, leading to the formation of a Z-scheme.29 Considering Fig. 3, a Z-scheme is a subdivision of a type (II) heterojunction where SCI and SCII are positioned in staggered band alignment. However in a Z-scheme, electrons from the CB of SCI and holes from the VB of SCII are directly employed for water reduction and oxidation, respectively. Moreover, electrons from the CB of SCII are recombined with the holes from the VB of SCI. The Z-scheme has certain advantages over a conventional type (II) heterojunction in that electrons do not lose their energy by being transferred towards lower conduction and valence band energies.165
For thin films in PEC devices, the deposition order and external bias, discussed in detail in Fig. 5 and 6, can specifically tailor the redox potential window of a staggered heterojunction and transform a type (II) heterojunction to a Z-scheme heterojunction. This culminates in a higher redox potential for the Z-scheme heterojunction (ΔVZ-scheme) compared with the redox potential of a type (II) heterojunction (ΔVtype-II), paving the ground for highly efficient solar water splitting (Fig. 20a and b). Apart from the synthesis of photocatalysts based on the Z-scheme in their powder forms,165–169 the fabrication of other configurations of Z-schemes, such as particulate sheets,170–172 thin film D4 tandem cells,173,174 thin film photocathodes,175 and thin film photoanodes,13,46,72,176–183 is still in their early stages of development and further research needs to be conducted in this field.

In one study, Wang et al. altered the deposition order of WO3 and g-C3N4 to obtain two diverse types of charge transfer pathways (Fig. 5). Although higher photocurrents were observed for type (II) charge transfer, the photocurrent enhancement factor proved to be superior for the Z-scheme-based photoelectrode (Fig. 21a–d).46 This was due to the employment of the WO3 nanostructure for the type (II) device that possesses superior charge transfer properties compared with compact WO3.184 The deposition of g-C3N4 was congruous to that explained above for decorating Cu2O,162 although it was conducted under 10 V of external bias.46 In another research by Ye et al., TVC grown g-C3N4 was decorated by MoS2, approximately doubling the photocurrent of bare MoS2. However, due to the p-type nature of MoS2, the p–n junction was formed, resulting in a conventional type (II) charge transfer mechanism.164

In our previous work, a Z-scheme g-C3N4/BiVO4 photoanode was constructed and nearly achieved a four-fold photocurrent enhancement compared with bare BiVO4. g-C3N4 was deposited via a spin coating technique from methanolic dispersions, being followed by subsequent electrodeposition of BiVO4. This culminated in the formation of larger grains compared with bare BiVO4 that was accompanied by surface roughness and morphological differences between FTO and g-C3N4. Due to the precipitation of ionic particles in electrodeposition,185,186 BiVO4 could readily be decorated on g-C3N4. The higher surface roughness further enhanced the light absorption and double layer capacitance due to the formation of light-scattering sites and water molecule trapping centers, respectively.187–189 For comparison, a TiO2/BiVO4 heterojunction was also devised, forming a Z-scheme that was induced by the application of a positive bias. The g-C3N4-based heterojunction, however, resulted in a higher photocurrent response compared with its TiO2 counterpart (Fig. 21e–g). This was confirmed to be the consequence of a larger number of oxygen vacancy sites that were induced via the hydrogen bonds of g-C3N4 on the one hand, and due to low lattice mismatch of g-C3N4 with BiVO4 on the other.13 g-C3N4-based Z-scheme photoelectrodes are still in their preliminary stages of development and they are deemed favorable for future experimentation.
g-C3N4 as a composite (bulk heterojunction)
Up to now, g-C3N4 composites have been extensively explored in photocatalysis and significant achievements have been made in this field.24,29–31,37 The composite photocatalysts demonstrated enhanced charge transportation that was attributed to the prolonged lifetime of charge carriers.86,190,191 Despite enhanced photocurrent responses in previous composite photocatalysts, it is only in recent experiments where superior PEC properties and photocurrent densities (higher than 0.2 mA cm−2) have been achieved.118,178–180,192–194 An ionic co-precipitation strategy was previously utilized to anchor Co–Mn LDH195 and vanadate quantum dots on g-C3N4.192 In one experiment, AgVO3 quantum dots were wet-precipitated on thermally etched g-C3N4 and obtained spectacular PEC properties with a photocurrent density of nearly −1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE. This was attributed to interfacial 0D/2D synergy and effective coupling of quantum dots with g-C3N4. The preparation involved precipitation of quantum dots via a facile room-temperature liquid precipitation technique utilizing a g-C3N4 dispersion, NH4VO3, AgNO3, and NH4OH solution, with subsequent deposition on FTO from an ethanol slurry (Fig. 21h–j).192 Besides the aforementioned AgVO3 quantum dots, further investigation into the mechanism, synthesis and photoelectrocatalytic application of other 0D/2D heterostructures such as carbon nanodots,83,196 MoS2 quantum dots,197 and black phosphorus quantum dots84 is highly desirable.
Ansari et al. synthesized MoS2@g-C3N4 by mechanochemical methods in a ball milling jar. As a result of the intimate contact between horizontally placed MoS2 with g-C3N4, an exceptional photocurrent density of 3.5 mA cm−2 was obtained, which is the highest among composite films. The photoelectrode was deposited via drop coating the composite in ethyl cellulose and α-terpineol on FTO (Fig. 21k–m).193 Facile mixing of perovskite type NiTiO3 and g-C3N4 under ultrasonication resulted in a photocurrent of 0.25 mA cm−2.179 This study suggests the importance of inorganic perovskites for water splitting and there is a great need for further investigations into this type of photocatalysts.198,199
Besides the aforementioned methods, other techniques have also been developed such as ultrasonication-mixing with Fe2O3 dendrites,194 electrospinning with BiVO4,178 solution-phase mixing with BiVO4,180 and doctor-blade synthesis with PEDOT:PSS.200 A common preparation technique in most of these reports is the low-temperature solution mixing of g-C3N4 prior to deposition on a substrate. This strategy has proved to be propitious, since it endows intimate contact between the composite and the substrate, resulting in exceptional PEC properties. Advanced nanostructuring strategies including hollow nanospheres,201,202 nanorods,203 and interface techniques such as 0D/2D,83,84,197 1D/2D,204 and 2D/2D205,206 are important and should be paid further attention for attaining high efficiency composite bulk heterojunction photoelectrodes. Table 2 presents the photocurrent comparison for g-C3N4 heterojunction photoelectrodes based on deposition configurations as a guest, host and composite.

Most of the devised heterojunction photoelectrodes up to now were fabricated via pristine g-C3N4. However, metal/non-metal doped g-C3N4 was proved to be superior due to its higher mobility, charge carrier separation and surface kinetic energies. Numerous researchers probed the incorporation of nickel,92,207,208 iron,209 boron,210,211 phosphorus,212 iodine,213 and biopolymers214 into g-C3N4. In fact, several insightful review papers have addressed the effect of doping on the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, which is deemed promising for further investigation into g-C3N4-based photoelectrodes.37,215 Moreover, the application of g-C3N4@chloride ions,138 g-C3N4@boron,210 and Se@g-C3N4 (ref. 216) in a heterojunction with n-type semiconductors favors effective charge transportation due to formation of p–n junctions.
Solar cells applications
The superior thermal–physical stability of g-C3N4, compared with other small molecule semiconductors, enables the fabrication of g-C3N4-based solar cells in both lower and higher temperature ranges. The number of research studies on g-C3N4-based solar cells is not substantial, with this caused principally by fabrication challenges of developing uniform and pin-hole free thin films of g-C3N4. This section is concerned with the application of g-C3N4 in organic photovoltaic and sensitized cells.
Organic photovoltaic cells
Some research groups employed g-C3N4 in organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells.91,217,218 Xu et al. employed the aforementioned liquid mediated growth to fabricate g-C3N4 thin films with a thickness of ∼500 nm as an electron transport layer (ETL). The open circuit voltage (Voc) in the device structure of ITO/TiO2/g-C3N4/P3HT/MoO3/Au afforded a spectacular 1 V that was 0.18 V higher than that in the g-C3N4-free device. The advantages of the g-C3N4 layer between TiO2 and P3HT were attributed to improved Fermi level alignment and more efficient charge transfer that manifested itself in 60% quenched photoluminescence and 30% shortened fluorescence lifetime. Nevertheless, the device underperformed due to the large thickness of the employed g-C3N4 which impeded electron transportation.91 This was a prime factor for Zhou et al. to develop thinner layers of g-C3N4 as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL) and to modify the work function of ITO. The ultrathin g-C3N4 thin film (∼3 nm) was deposited by spin coating from a liquid exfoliated dispersion of g-C3N4 in H2O and IPA, with the dispersion remaining stable for more than one year. The ITO/g-C3N4/PBDTTT-C/PC71BM/MoO3 with g-C3N4 as the CIL achieved 6.4% photon conversion efficiency (PCE) which was 74% higher than that of the g-C3N4-free device. A scanning kelvin probe microscopy test for ITO/g-C3N4 gave a work function of 4.48 eV, which was 0.52 eV lower than that of ITO, effectuating electron extraction (Fig. 22a–d).217

In a different study, Chen et al. reported the incorporation of gCNQD into active layers of three separate devices (bulk heterojunction solar cells), employing P3HT, PBDTTT-C and PTB7-Th. The gCNQD was synthesized by solvothermal treatment in o-dichlorobenzene (oDB). The oDB treatment was performed to ensure the dissolution and effective mixing of gCNQD with active layers. For all three devices, the gCNQD generated an average of 1% PCE enhancement due to improved conductivity of the active layer and enhanced interface coupling with the hole transport layer (PEDOT:PSS@MoO3). For comparison, the bulk g-C3N4 was also tested, although the PCE dropped by approximately 0.5% for the entire device (Fig. 22e–k). This was due to the large number of pin-holes and the lower uniformity of bulk g-C3N4 that functioned as charge recombination centers.218 An analogous result was obtained in our previous experiment where monolayered g-C3N4 formed fewer pin-holes compared with its bulk counterpart.41
Sensitized cells
g-C3N4 has found applications in CdS quantum dot sensitized solar cells in a composite heterostructure with ZnO,219 and TiO2NR.220 In one study by Chetia et al., urea-procured g-C3N4 was mechanically mixed with ZnO nanorods (ZnONR), terpineol, and polyethylene glycol and then it was deposited via a doctor-blade technique. The CdS sensitized devices demonstrated a PCE of 2.43% compared with bare ZnONR (0.65%). The enhanced PCE was attributed to minimized reverse tunneling probability that also manifested itself in incremented values of Voc. Interestingly, incorporation of g-C3N4 increased the radius of bode-plot semi-circles, which was attributed to retarded back-ward redox reaction (Fig. 22l–n).219 TiO2NR-based CdS solar cells also demonstrated a PCE of 1.88% that was boosted to 2.31% after being covered with g-C3N4 paste via spin coating. Nonetheless, PCE was improved only by small amounts due to coverage of g-C3N4 only on top of TiO2NR.220 The performance of this device can be improved by employing the aforementioned methods in obtaining uniform and dense coverage of g-C3N4 around TiO2NR. Other applications of g-C3N4 were in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) where g-C3N4 retarded backward transportation of electrons between TiO2 and dyes.221–223
Perovskite cells
The past decade witnessed the immensity of inquiries into cost-effective solution-processed organometallic halide perovskite cells.224,225 Nitrogen-rich precursors demonstrated enhanced PCE of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells.226,227 In one study by Hsieh et al., the incorporation of urea into MAPbI3 improved the PCE from 14.6% to 18.8%. The improvement was attributed to enlarged feature sizes of MAPbI3 that could restrain the charge recombination at grain boundaries.226 In another experiment by Jiang et al., incorporating urea-derived bulk g-C3N4 into MAPbI3 increased not only crystallization and grain sizes of MAPbI3 but also the conductivity of the perovskite layer. This improved the coupling between the perovskite layer and the hole transport material (HTM) which consequently reduced hysteresis and augmented the PCE from 16.22% to 19.34% (Fig. 22o–r).227 To fabricate highly efficient low temperature solution-processed OPV and perovskite solar cells necessitates the development of strategies to synthesize g-C3N4 at low temperatures, for example, by adopting the cyanuric chloride-melamine approach.203Table 3 presents the performance comparison for solar cells based on g-C3N4 including OPV, sensitized and perovskite solar cells.

Although most studies so far have concentrated on the incorporation of g-C3N4 into active light absorbing layers, the emerging perovskite solar cells lack the component of g-C3N4 as an ETL.228–230 Moreover, p-type g-C3N4, which is constructed by doping with boron,210 or chloride ions,138 implies a suitable HTM based on g-C3N4 to be applicable in perovskite solar cells.231,232 g-C3N4 has been proved to possess an unprecedented capability to function as both an electron and hole transport layer, rendering it highly favorable for future explorations in emerging classes of solar cell.
Electrochemical applications
Due to the superior electrocatalytic properties and the highly active nitrogen sites of g-C3N4, numerous studies have addressed the design of g-C3N4-based electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. This section reviews the emerging applications of g-C3N4-based electrochemical devices in electrolyzers for hydrogen production and in supercapacitors for electrical energy conversion.
Electrocatalysts
Solar-to-hydrogen generation via PV-electrolysis is another viable approach to water splitting that has gained popularity among researchers.233 However, electrocatalysts are mostly fabricated from noble metals due to their remarkably low overpotentials.14 To seek alternative non-noble metals as a replacement to platinum, numerous efforts have been put into 2D materials including metals and non-metals.14,21,195,197,234–237 Platinum possesses an excellent hydrogen evolution overpotential of −50 mV vs. RHE @ −10 mA cm−2 making this element excessively challenging to be replaced by other alternative materials.237,238
Pristine g-C3N4 was demonstrated to be highly stable as a HEC.90,234 However, its high overpotential urged researchers to develop a hybrid g-C3N4 structure with nitrogen doped graphene,235,237 copper,236 and MoS2.197 Duan et al. fabricated a free-standing film comprised of hybrid porous g-C3N4 and N-graphene (PCN@N-graphene) via vacuum filtration of the composite catalyst powder on a cellulose membrane, followed by freeze-drying to form a free-standing film with a thickness of 30 μm. The resultant van der Waals heterostructure exhibited an overpotential as low as −80 mV vs. RHE to achieve −10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. The exceptional values of overpotential resulted from its porous network, beneficial to the HER (Fig. 23a–d).235 Zou et al. fabricated Cu incorporated g-C3N4 by pyrolyzing dicyandiamide with copper chloride under a nitrogen atmosphere and deposited it with a mixture of Nafion on a glassy carbon electrode, achieving 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 390 mV vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4.236 While incorporating metals into g-C3N4, the presence of an oxygen-deficient nitrogen-rich precursor and a nitrogen atmosphere were deemed crucial to prevent formation of unwanted metal oxides.92,207,208 The precipitation of MoS2 quantum dots using acetone onto g-C3N4 nanosheets (0D/2D coupling) under ultrasonication was also demonstrated to give a promising HEC, yielding −5 mA cm−2 at −700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M H2SO4.197

Electrocatalysts have also been employed as counter-electrodes for DSSCs, developed using carbonaceous materials.239–243 g-C3N4-based DSSC counter-electrodes displayed an efficiency approximating that of platinum. The synergy of g-C3N4 and carbon black was deemed indispensable to the design of electrocatalysts, since neither g-C3N4 nor carbon black alone could perform as functional counter electrodes.240,241 These applications are representative of the tremendous potential of g-C3N4 as an efficient electrocatalyst that is yet to be discovered in future research.
Supercapacitors
Several supercapacitors have been constructed based on g-C3N4 1D nanostructures,244–246 hybrid composites of g-C3N4 with metal hydroxides/layered double hydroxides (LDH),247–250 (reduced) graphene oxide,251–253 metal oxides,253–259 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD),193,260–263 polymers,264–267 nitrogen doped g-C3N4,268 red phosphorus,269 and the emerging 2D MXene Ti2CTx.270 Aging of melamine in HNO3 and HCl led to the formation of g-C3N4 1D nanostructures such as nanofibers,244 nanotubes,245 and nanoneedles.271 These nanostructures possess a surface area of more than 150 m2 g−1 which is nearly 15 times greater than that of untreated g-C3N4.244,245 Furthermore, electrospinning of the g-C3N4 dispersion in dimethylformamide produced nanofibers with a surface area of 554 m2 g−1.246 Although the electrospinned g-C3N4 nanofibers had a significantly greater surface area than those of nitric acid-treated 1D structures, the former demonstrated a capacitance of 200 F g−1 while the latter possessed a capacitance of 263.75. This may result from the presence of activated carbon and conductive polymer which enhances the conductivity of the supercapacitor's working electrode.244,245 Integration of g-C3N4 into freestanding metallic networks can produce high performance supercapacitors, which is highly desirable to be constructed in the future.272Table 4 presents the performance comparison of supercapacitors that are constructed employing g-C3N4.

Although the aforementioned studies reported an enhanced capacitance of less than 300 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, it was in Dong et al. where an extraordinary capacitance of 1500 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 was reported for a Ni(OH)2@g-C3N4 hybrid. The tremendous improvement was attributed to the relatively high surface area (62.4 m2 g−1) of its honeycomb-like composite heterostructure (Fig. 23e–g).249 Solvothermal treatment of melamine enhanced the coupling of g-C3N4 with both NiCo2S4 (ref. 260) and rGO,251 which respectively, yielded a remarkable capacitance of 1557 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 for the former and an energy density of 52.7 W h kg−1 for the latter. Further investigation into 3D-engineered g-C3N4, effective coupling with TMD and functionalization with metal hydroxides is anticipated to contribute to the emergence of higher performing supercapacitors.
Conclusion and outlook
In the transformation from fossil fuels to renewable energies, sunlight is deemed the most propitious alternative. However, the intermittent nature of sunlight necessitates an exhaustive investigation into the design and development of solar energy conversion and storage devices. The selected materials for the attainment of this objective must demonstrate excellent optoelectronic properties for implementation in PEC cells and solar cells. Moreover, the selected materials are required to have remarkable electrocatalytic and charge transportation properties for novel electrocatalyzers and supercapacitors. In this regard, g-C3N4 has been proved to possess extraordinary optoelectronic and electrocatalytic properties.
The moderate band gap of g-C3N4 in the visible range renders this material highly favorable for devices that are functional under sunlight. Moreover, the nitrogen sites of g-C3N4 play an identical role to that of nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide with extraordinary performances in electrochemical devices. Besides, the high chemical, thermal and physical stability of g-C3N4 makes possible the incorporation of g-C3N4 into PEC devices. This paves the way for engineering diverse types of g-C3N4 nanomaterials and nanostructured thin films which can transform energy conversion and storage devices in the foreseeable future. Although g-C3N4 is exhaustively explored in the field of photocatalysis, the photoelectrocatalytic and optoelectronic devices based on g-C3N4 are still in their infancy. The outstanding PEC properties of g-C3N4 are indicative of its high potential beyond photocatalysis. The limited attention paid to devices based on this material arises from the challenges in fabricating thin films and electrodes based on g-C3N4. The mechanism of thin-film fabrication methods needs to be prioritized for the emergence of g-C3N4 applications beyond conventional photocatalysis. Moreover, for the realization of practical devices, several parameters such as processing temperature, stability and PEC performance are deemed essential.
The advances made in the g-C3N4-based electrodes not only contribute to research on sunlight-driven water splitting devices, but they also pave the ground for the development of numerous devices in this field such as solar cells, electrocatalysts and supercapacitors. Other environmentally pertinent applications of functionalized g-C3N4-based electrodes in wastewater purification, bacterial disinfection and dye degradation are also anticipated to be soon developed. Besides previous advances, certain recommendations are posited below for the further improvement and optimization in the design, fabrication and application of g-C3N4-based energy devices. These recommendations highlight the development of other foreseeable devices, the optimization of g-C3N4, and its interface and coupling with other semiconductors.
(1) Investigation into other devices
g-C3N4 demonstrated excellent oxygen reduction reaction properties, applicable to fuel cells and batteries.8,9,125,273,274 In fact, the poly(triazine imide) networks of g-C3N4 can coordinate lithium ions into its pore channels, giving it an edge over silicon, tin and graphite for Li-ion battery applications.82 Also, nitrogen vacancy sites of g-C3N4 can stably anchor transition metals, being a promising route for electrochemical reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonia.79 Nevertheless, pristine g-C3N4 suffers from low conductivity and surface kinetic reactions which are often resolved by being coupled to carbonaceous/transition metal-based sites.8,274–276 Even though insightful research papers and review articles have been written on 3D porous morphologies of high surface area g-C3N4 aerogels,277,278 investigation on the effective coupling of g-C3N4 with other materials in supercapacitors is not thorough. Moreover, the coating techniques that are reviewed in this paper imply strategies of effective coupling and deposition of thickness-tunable g-C3N4 for optimal design of fuel cells and batteries. Apart from the applications discussed in this review, other optoelectronic devices such as LEDs,279–281 photodetectors,282,283 phototransistors,284 sensors,126,285–290 CO2 reduction reactors,18–20 nitrogen reduction reactors,79,81 bio-related optofluidic micro-reactors,291 and emerging concepts of solar batteries10 would be possible via further investigation into fabrication, properties, and mechanisms of g-C3N4-based electrodes.
(2) Efficiency limit, past achievements and future directions
Although significant achievements have been made as to g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and photoelectrodes, the highest attainable photocurrent of pristine/doped g-C3N4 with a band gap of 2.7 eV is approximately 0.1 mA cm−2 (Table 1), which is still far less than its theoretical maximum value amounting to more than 4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.87,97 Calculation for maximum theoretical photocurrent values and the list of references with full titles are provided in ESI, S1.† This demonstrates that the fundamental mechanism and development of g-C3N4 photoelectrodes still require exhaustive research.
(3) Improving conductivity, light absorption and surface kinetic reaction
Initially, low conductivity, insufficient light absorption and low surface kinetic reactions of g-C3N4 need to be addressed.42 Incorporation of metal/non-metal dopants could highly improve the conductivity of g-C3N4.92,100 Moreover, graphene could enhance the charge separation and improve the electron/hole diffusion lengths of g-C3N4 up to 36 μm, yielding significant PEC performance in the presence of TEOA.118 However, the oxygen evolution reaction of g-C3N4 is still the bottleneck that needs to receive more attention in future studies.42,118,142 Gold nanoparticles demonstrated a remarkable 3000 times higher photocurrent compared with bare g-C3N4.112 Investigation into the incorporation of plasmonic nanoparticles to improve the light absorption of g-C3N4 in photoelectrodes is scarce and in need of broader exploration.292–294 Band gap reduction of g-C3N4 to absorb wider portions of the solar spectrum is attainable via adjusting the chain length,295 introduction of nitrogen deficiency,296 heteroatom doping,297,298 and copolymerization.299 The recent photochemical synthesis route to obtain a remarkable narrow band gap of as low as ∼1.65 eV is of prime importance in future research.300 These studies have to be in conjunction with understanding and tailoring the absorption coefficient of g-C3N4.301 The incorporation of a co-catalyst in pristine and sensitized g-C3N4-based photoelectrodes demonstrated significant enhancement in surface kinetic reactions for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions,39,158 which requires thorough study into surface engineering of g-C3N4.142 Regardless of the type of photoelectrode architecture or device type, modified g-C3N4 rather than its pristine counterpart is highly recommended for the future design of photoelectrodes.
(4) Stability, semiconductor coupling and fabrication
The long term durability of devices highly depends on the fabrication methods of g-C3N4. For example, TVC of g-C3N4 on TiO2 depicted a durable operation when melamine was employed as a precursor.149,150 However, upon utilizing dicyandiamide, its long term stability was decreased.148 The lower cost deposition method of DDC proved durable only when passivated by an external co-catalyst.158 The mechanochemical mixing of g-C3N4 and MoS2 demonstrated a remarkable photocurrent that is outstanding for a composite.193 The fact that hydrothermal mixing of g-C3N4 and MoS2 demonstrates a significantly lower performance302 attests to the importance of fundamental investigations into effective interface coupling specifically on the scales of 0D/2D,83,84,197 1D/2D,204 and 2D/2D.206 Development of large-area g-C3N4 electrodes is highly recommended for further investigation, commercialization and scale-up projects.40,180,303 The recent study on liquid mediated growth of a porous g-C3N4 thin film could be the hotspot in coming years and the research into the conductivity and charge transportation improvements should be the first priority for future studies.87 Development of novel assembly techniques such as peroxo-construction and oriented attachment can improve grain boundaries, dislocations and conductivity of g-C3N4 electrodes.304
(5) Z-scheme
Although numerous studies have focused on sensitization and decoration of semiconductors with g-C3N4, the research on application of g-C3N4 as a host which usually forms the Z-scheme is still in its intermediary stages and hence, demands more attention.13,46 Benefitting from its highly negative conduction band, g-C3N4 could provide high redox potential in Z-scheme configurations compared with type (II) which is of paramount importance for water splitting reactions.
(6) Solid state mediators
The application of solid state mediators is a necessity in future design of heterojunction photoelectrodes based on g-C3N4. For heterojunction photoelectrodes, solid state mediators demonstrated a simple yet crucial strategy that could dramatically enhance the charge transportation between two semiconductors.72,134 Incorporating metal nanoparticles between two semiconductors is highly propitious for future heterojunction photoelectrodes based on g-C3N4 due to its functioning simultaneously as both a solid state mediator and a plasmonic light absorber.
(7) p-type g-C3N4
Although numerous n-type g-C3N4 have been constructed, more investigations have to be devoted to p-type g-C3N4. Functionalization of g-C3N4 by elemental doping such as chloride ions and boron produced p-type g-C3N4.138,210 HCl-treated g-C3N4 exhibited remarkable PEC properties in a heterojunction with Fe2O3,137 in comparison with untreated g-C3N4.143 This may be attributed to the formation of a p–n junction, which requires a more focused study.
