    , Accepted 22nd December 2011First published on 4th January 2012AbstractWe have demonstrated the successful fabrication of multiple-layer colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-sensitized near-infrared (NIR) photovoltaic (PV) cells using the solution processable HgTe CQDs and poly-3-(hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as hole-conducting polymer. The cells showed a 3.6 fold enhancement in power conversion efficiency under NIR light illumination by the post-ethanedithiol chemical treatment. The performance enhancement was mainly ascribed to the improved interfacial contact between HgTe CQDs by elimination of oleic acid as capping ligand on the surface of HgTe CQDs. In addition, the HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cells could effectively detect weak NIR light and process over 1 kHz level signals.
Introduction
Recently, inorganic semiconducting colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have been extensively studied as a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic cells because CQDs have a higher absorption coefficient than conventional dyes, convenient bandgap tunability by size control, efficient charge separation owing to a high intrinsic dipole moment, multiple exciton generation, and good stability.1 In particular, CQDs with the ability to absorb or emit near-infrared (NIR) light, such as PbS, PbSe, CdTe, Bi2S3, and HgTe, have attracted much attention because of their potential in special applications such as remote sensing, telecommunications, biological imaging, solar cells, and photodetectors.2 Among the various materials of CQDs responsive to NIR light, HgTe seems to be an ideal material because it can have abundant room to realize arbitrary bandgaps through the “quantum confinement effect” via size control. This is because the bandgap of bulk HgTe is almost zero owing to its semi-metallic characteristics with a bulk exciton Bohr radius of 39.5 nm.3
Since Grätzel et al. reported a solid-state dye-sensitized photovoltaic (PV) cell,4 intensive studies have been done to improve the power conversion efficiency and recently, an efficient solid-state dye-sensitized PV cell with ∼6% of power conversion efficiency with newly designed dye absorbing over the whole visible light has been developed.5 To further improve the device efficiency, it is strongly required to extend the photoresponse of sensitizers into the NIR region because such NIR responsive sensitizer can generate more electricity through rationally designed architectures such as panchromatic or cascade or tandem structures for devices. Therefore, it is challenging to develop a PV cell operating at the NIR region.
Sensitized PV cells might be able to achieve better device performance than the Schottky and heterojunction types of PV cells, because the generated electron and hole pairs in a sensitizer are independently transported to electron and hole conductors. Even though the inorganic semiconducting sensitizer is multiply layered on mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) in a PV cell, it has been reported that the generated charge carriers in the sensitizer could be efficiently transported to electron and hole conductors, in a well-designed device.6 Although the HgTe CQDs are one of the ideal materials for optoelectronic devices, few attempts have been done to fabricate PV cells using HgTe CQDs because the HgTe CQDs intrinsically have poor stability and often exhibit different excitonic peaks even after short-term storage. However, very recently, we reported the new synthetic route for the stable HgTe CQDs and showed the possibility to use in a NIR photodetector even though the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was ∼4% at 1250 nm.7 Here, we report our investigation on a great enhancement for the power conversion efficiency of HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cells, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 10% across the NIR region (wavelengths of 700 to 1300 nm), by post-treatment in ethanedithiol (EDT) solution.
Experimental section
Synthesis of HgTe CQDs7
79.27 mg (0.25 mmol) of mercury(II) acetate was added to a mixture of 101.2 mg (0.5 mmol) of 1-dodecanethiol and 191 mg (0.5 mmol) of oleylamine, heated to 100 °C and kept under vacuum for 1 h. Then, diphenyl ether (4 mL) was added to the reaction flask at room temperature and the temperature was raised to 65 °C and kept under vacuum for 45 min. Injection solution was prepared by dissolving tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP)–Te (0.1 M) in 1 mL of TOP in a glove box. The injection solution was rapidly added into the three-neck flask at room temperature under N2 atmosphere, and then slowly heated to 60 °C and maintained for 10 min.
Device fabrication
In a typical procedure for the device fabrication, a dense blocking layer (bl)-TiO2 of ∼50 nm thickness was deposited on a FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC8) by the spray pyrolysis deposition of 20 mM of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution at 450 °C to prevent direct contact between FTO and P3HT (poly-3-hexylthiophene) hole conductor. The mp-TiO2 (TiO2 particle size = ∼60 nm, anatase phase) layer8 of ∼1.2 μm thickness was screen-printed on the bl-TiO2 layer and sintered at 500 °C for 1 h in air. The mp-TiO2 film was then immersed in 20 mM of aqueous TiCl4 solution at room temperature for 12 h, rinsed with pure water, and sintered again at 450 °C for 15 min to facilitate intimate contact between TiO2 nanoparticles. To form multiply layered HgTe CQDs on the mp-TiO2 film, we spin-coated HgTe CQDs in hexane/chlorobenzene (10:1 v/v) solution (20 mg/1 mL) on the mp-TiO2 film pre-treated by 10 wt% 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)/ethanol solution in order to anchor the HgTe CQDs on the mp-TiO2 surface. To bind additional HgTe CQDs on the pre-anchored HgTe CQDs on the mp-TiO2 surface, we spin-coated 1 wt% of EDT/ethanol solution as a bridging agent and then spin-coated the HgTe CQDs solution. We prepared multiple-layer HgTe CQDs on mp-TiO2 film by repeatedly spin-coating the 1 wt% of EDT solution and HgTe CQDs solution to 20 times. The P3HT solution (15 mg mL−1 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the multiple layer HgTe CQDs on mp-TiO2 film at 2500 rpm for 1 min and a 60 nm thick Au electrode was then deposited by thermal evaporation. Finally, the multiple-layer HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell was immersed in 10 wt% of EDT/ethanol solution for 0 (without post-EDT treatment), 3, 6, 9 and 15 h to check the variations of the device performance with post-EDT treatment time.
Device characterization
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a home-designed system comprising a light source (1000 W xenon lamp, Newport, 69935) with a monochromator (Newport cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2002). The photocurrent response was measured by a home-designed system consisting of a 980 nm laser diode (Axcel AX-040: 500 μW), a modulator (Neos AOBD), a function generator (Tektronix CFG250), a photodiode (Newfocus), a current–voltage converter (Polaronix K101) and an oscilloscope (Yokogawa DL1702). The current–voltage (I–V) curve of the PV cell under the illumination of NIR light was measured using a sourcemeter (Keithley 2420) and a solar simulator (Class A, 91195A; Newport). The PV cell was illuminated with NIR light by cutting-off the light of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) AM 1.5G below the 715 nm wavelength using a neutral density filter. The active area of PbS CQD-sensitized PV cells for I–V characterization was fixed at 0.16 cm2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the multiple-layer HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell and energy band diagram. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the schematic device, which had a structure comprising FTO(F-doped tin oxide)/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/HgTe CQDs/P3HT/Au serving as electrode/blocking layer/electron conductor/NIR sensitizer/hole conductor/counter electrode. Fig. 1(b) displays the band energy diagram of the HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell. The electron–hole pairs in the HgTe CQD-sensitizer generated by illumination of an external light are independently transported to the mp-TiO2 electron conductor and the P3HT hole conductor, respectively. At the same time the P3HT could also absorb the visible light (up to 650 nm in wavelength) and generate charge carriers, however it acts only as a hole conductor in the NIR region.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional image of the HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell shown in Fig. 2(a) confirms the thickness of the PV cell to be ∼1.2 μm. The energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) line profiles (see Fig. 2(b)) indicate that the HgTe CQDs were infiltrated to the bottom of the mp-TiO2 layer, and the top and bottom photographs in the inset macroscopically confirm good infiltration of the HgTe CQDs to the bottom of the mp-TiO2 because if the HgTe CQDs were not infiltrated into the bottom layer of the mp-TiO2, the bottom photograph would have been white from the scattering of bare mp-TiO2. Fig. 2(c) shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of an HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell, indicating that the HgTe CQDs were deposited on the mp-TiO2 surface as single or multiple layers. It should be noted that the deposited HgTe CQDs did not cover the entire surface of the mp-TiO2, unlike an extremely thin absorber (ETA) solar cell. Rather, the morphology of the deposited HgTe CQDs was similar to that of the aggregated inorganic semiconductors formed by the spray pyrolysis deposition (SPD) method in an inorganic semiconductor-sensitized PV cell.9 Therefore, this device architecture should be distinguished from that of a conventional n–p depleted heterojunction PV cell.

Fig. 3(a) shows the absorption spectrum of the HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell. This indicates that the HgTe CQDs absorb light in the visible to NIR region (up to 1500 nm in wavelength). The inset shows the TEM image of the HgTe CQDs used here. To check the variation of device performance with time for post-EDT treatment, we measured the short circuit current density (Jsc) under NIR light illumination, which is generated by cutting off below 715 nm wavelength in 1 sun light (100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G), as shown in Fig. 3(b). It is observed that Jsc (4.4–4.6 mA cm−2) of the cells after post-EDT treatment is ∼3 fold that of the pristine device (1.4 mA cm−2) owing to the improved interfacial contact between HgTe CQDs. It should be noted that an EDT molecule is small enough to diffuse into the device and further replace any remaining oleic acid on the surface of HgTe CQDs forming intimate contact between HgTe CQDs. The Jsc values with treatment time in EDT solution are saturated over 3 h as shown in Fig. 3(b). The EQE spectra of cells fabricated with (W/-EDT) and without (W/O-EDT) post-EDT treatment are shown in Fig. 3(c). The spectral pattern and the position of EQE spectra are well matched with the absorption spectrum of HgTe CQDs. From the integration of EQE spectra in the NIR region (700 nm to 1500 nm), we can estimate the Jsc values before and after post-EDT treatment were 7.1 and 2.6 mA cm−2, respectively. However, the Jsc values shown in Fig. 3(d) are lower than that estimated from EQE spectra. This might be attributed to the significant recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes under a relatively stronger illumination light than under EQE measurement conditions. The performance of devices fabricated with and without post-EDT treatment is summarized in Table 1. The greater enhancement of power conversion efficiency (0.84%) with post-EDT treatment under NIR light illumination is mainly attributed to the improved Jsc and fill factor compared to the efficiency (0.23%) of a pristine device. This implies that the post-EDT treatment allows the generated charge carriers in HgTe CQDs to be efficiently transported through multiple-layer HgTe CQDs, by the intimate contact between HgTe CQDs. This is further confirmed by the reduction of series resistance, as shown in Table 1. The power conversion efficiency of the post-EDT treated device at 1 sun illumination was 1.3% as listed in Table 1.

To check the photoresponsivity of the HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell in the NIR region, we measured a typical photocurrent response using a modulated 980 nm laser (modulated light power = 500 μW) as shown in Fig. 4. The photocurrent response indicates that the HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell can detect such weak signal up to kHz levels.

Conclusion
We fabricated an efficient multiple-layer HgTe CQD-sensitized PV cell by repeatedly depositing HgTe CQDs on a mp-TiO2 layer. Through the post-EDT chemical treatment, the power conversion efficiency under NIR light illumination could be significantly improved from 0.23% to 0.84%. The great enhancement of device efficiency was mainly attributed to the intimate contact between HgTe CQDs. Moreover, these cells could be applicable to detect weak NIR light and process a signal higher than the 1 kHz level without a bias voltage. We believe that an efficient HgTe CQD-sensitized NIR PV cell can be useful in constructing panchromatic or cascade or tandem systems to extend the photoresponse in the NIR region. In addition, these NIR light responsive PV cells could be applied to cost-effective NIR responsive devices that do not require high-speed signal processing such as optical communication.
