    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractThe temporal response of conventional ZnO nanowire-based photodetectors suffers from the influence of carrier mobility and high electrical resistance. As a result, these devices can be prohibitively slow for some applications, generally with a response time on the order of 1 second. This study presents a novel ZnO nanowire-based microfiber coupler structure for all-optical photodetection without the demand for photocurrent generation. In this design, two waveguides are directly adsorbed by van der Waals forces or electrostatic forces. Compared with the conventional electrical bridge structure, the optical coupling architecture makes the device both compact and stable. In this configuration, resonance dips form in the transmission spectrum when the phase-matching conditions of the two waveguides are satisfied. The measurements of the resulting wavelength shift, low noise levels, and repetition time confirmed that the proposed optical device could operate as a photodetector. The device exhibits superior performance with a sensitivity of 1.657 nm (W cm−2)−1 and a response time of 0.43 ms. In addition, the detector features a simple fabrication as there is no need for extra modification of ZnO nanowires. The resulting photodetection capabilities could provide a new functionality for novel all-optical applications.
Introduction
ZnO is an important wide-bandgap semiconductor at room temperature, with an exciton binding energy of 60 meV. It has attracted significant attention in the development of novel electronic and optical devices, owing to its unique properties. It is a critical component of various electronic and optical devices such as transistors,1,2 chemical and biological sensors,3,4 piezoelectric transducers,5–7 solar cells,8,9 and lasers.10–13 Specifically, ZnO nanowires exhibit excellent photoconductive gain under ultraviolet (UV) illumination, making them an excellent candidate for photodetection applications.14–29 It has been proven to exhibit relatively high sensitivity as a UV photodetector (PD) based on the photoconduction effect.16 Since the first demonstration of a UV PD fabricated from a single ZnO nanowire which was reported by Kind et al. in 2002,14 many efforts have been made to produce more fast, more sensitive, and responsivity-enhanced UV sensors. For example, Soci et al. transferred single crystal ZnO nanowires to a SiO2 layer and fabricated Ti/Au interpolator electrodes using photolithography.15 Under UV illumination, the device photocurrent increased by 2–5 orders of magnitude relative to the dark current. On the other hand, the dark current could be decreased by two orders of magnitude and the ratio of photocurrent to dark current increased after the nanowire was coated with Au nanoparticles.18 This drastically improved the response speed (a decrease from ∼300 s to ∼10 s) of the ZnO nanowire PD. The UV light responsivity of these ZnO nanosensors can be increased by four orders of magnitude by replacing the ohmic contacts with Schottky contacts.17 The corresponding recovery time decreases dramatically as a result from 417 s to 0.8 s. Furthermore, polycrystalline ZnO granular nanowire (GNW) PDs exhibit a unique band edge modulation along the axial direction of GNWs during fabrication.22 This results in an ultra-high photoconductive gain, enhanced responsivity, and a detectivity of up to 3.3 × 1017 Jones. The construction of heterostructures can also realize the property enhancement of semiconductor PDs.25,28 For example, it has been demonstrated that the designable synthesis of 3D-branched hierarchical 3C-SiC/ZnO heterostructures by a three-step process and their assembling into an ultrasensitive PD25 and optoelectronic tests on the PD verify their outstanding photodetection performance with an ultrahigh external quantum efficiency (1.69 × 108%), a superior photoresponsivity (4.8 × 105 A W−1), and a very fast response time (a rise time of 40 ms and a decay time of 60 ms). However, the devices mentioned above commonly require a complex structure and are often sophisticated in fabrication.
Previous studies have mostly focused on the change in electrical conductivity and photocurrent caused by variations in the concentration of photogenerated carriers, primarily because the carrier mobility and high electrical resistance limit the timescale performance and responsiveness of a detector. If the optical properties of ZnO nanowires, such as refractive index (RI) that changes transiently with the generation of photocarriers, can be employed, the response time of PDs may be improved by several orders of magnitude. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of a single semiconductor nanowire for all-optical photodetection has yet to be reported. In this study, we propose an all-optical detection method that utilizes a single ZnO nanowire-based microfiber coupler (ZNMC) to achieve the photodetection of UV light. Under UV illumination, the resonant wavelength of the device exhibits a redshift with increasing light intensity, and a sensitivity of 1.657 nm (W cm−2)−1 and a response time of 0.43 ms are obtained experimentally. Meanwhile, the proposed photodetection scheme avoids the effect of dark current which generally exists in the traditional electrical bridge structures of ZnO nanowire-based PDs. As a result, all-optical photodetection in this design offers the possibility of fabricating PDs with a very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Experimental
The ZnO nanowires (XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd) are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, and the corresponding material characteristics are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) shows the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a single ZnO nanowire. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is shown in Fig. 1(b), where the detected signals of quartz come from the used substrate. Fig. 1(c) shows a typical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of a single ZnO nanowire, and the top-left inset shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern. The elemental mapping of O and Zn is shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e), respectively, imaged by electron diffraction X-ray (EDX). These results confirm that they are hexagonal ZnO nanowires.

A diagram of the proposed ZNMC all-optical PD is provided in Fig. 2(a). An experiment is conducted in which a single ZnO nanowire is directly attached to the uniform waist region, a section of the microfiber with the ends tapered down from a single mode fiber (SMF, SMF28e, Corning Inc.). The ZnO nanowire used here was dispersed in ethanol solution and then transferred to the microfiber waist region using a tungsten probe after the ethanol volatilized. As a subwavelength-diameter microfiber is needed for single-mode operation, an oxyhydrogen flame-heated cyclic taper system is used to gradually reduce the diameter of a SMF to ∼1 μm with the adiabatic transition region. The length of the uniform waist region is ∼15 mm. Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the optical microscopy image and SEM image of the ZNMC, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows a schematic of the corresponding test configuration, where SMFs adjacent to both ends of the microfiber in the ZNMC are fixed on a glass substrate using UV-curable adhesives. A continuous-wave 266 nm single-frequency deep UV laser (MBD-266, COHERENT) is employed to irradiate the ZNMC through a focusing lens, the focal length of which is 10 cm. For quasi-static test, a supercontinuum white-light source (WhiteLase Micro, NKT Photonics) is connected to one end of the ZNMC to characterize the transmission spectrum. Two optical spectrum analyzers (OSAs, AQ6370C and AQ6375B, Yokogawa), spanning a wavelength range of 600–2400 nm, are used to record the output spectra of the device. For dynamic response time measurement of the ZNMC, the output beam of the 266 nm laser is converted into pulsed light by utilizing a tunable optical chopper (MC2000B-EC, Duty Cycle 50%, Thorlabs). Meanwhile, the input supercontinuum signal is replaced by a tunable laser (Model 81940A, Agilent Technologies) in the microfiber, and the output optical signal is converted into an electrical signal by a commercial available PD (MODEL 2053, New Focus), which is then received by an oscilloscope (MDO 3054, Tektronix). The rule for selecting a tunable laser wavelength in dynamic measurement is that the wavelength corresponding to a transmission loss of 50% (full width at half maximum, FWHM) of the resonant dip, in the linear percentage coordinate system of the OSA, is selected as the operation wavelength (1551 nm) for the tunable laser.

Results and discussion
Under the continuous-wave illumination with the 266 nm laser, the locations of the resonant dips shift when the ZNMC is irradiated with UV light. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the UV light response of two ZNMC devices with ZnO nanowire diameters of ∼861 nm and ∼603 nm, respectively. An apparent redshift of 23.6 nm can be observed for the resonant wavelength (located at 1109.37 nm and operated in LP11 mode) of a ZNMC device with a gradual increase in light intensity from 0 to 40.6 W cm−2, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b) shows the experimental results for another ZNMC device operated in LP01 mode, whose resonant dip is located at 1594.47 nm, and a total wavelength shift of 56.76 nm can be observed. The relationship between the resonant wavelength shift and the light intensity of the two devices is plotted in Fig. 4(c) for clarity. It is evident that the increased intensity produces a linear redshift of the resonant wavelengths. The sensitivities are estimated to be approximately 0.587 and 1.657 nm (W cm−2)−1 for the two ZNMC devices. The optical absorption of the ZnO nanowire used here is studied using UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (LAMBDA, PerkinElmer), as shown in Fig. 4(d). The ZnO nanowire displays ∼90% reflectance in the visible spectrum, compared to ∼18% in the UV region. ZnO nanowires show low absorption at wavelengths above 390 nm, making them insensitive to visible wavelengths and suitable for UV photodetection. The bandgap energy can be determined by extrapolating the absorption edge onto the energy axis, as shown in the inset image of Fig. 4(d). The conversion of reflectance to absorbance data is obtained by the Kubelka–Munk function:30 (1)where R′ is the relative reflectance ratio, K is the absorption coefficient, and S is the scattering coefficient. Thus the optical bandgap of the ZnO nanowire material is estimated to be 3.23 eV by the above-mentioned extrapolation.

The operation principle of the ZNMC structure lies in the fact of optical mode coupling between the ZnO nanowire and microfiber. The ZnO nanowire and microfiber naturally form excellent optical waveguides and support the propagation of several optical guiding modes in the visible and near-infrared regions, respectively. The number of guiding modes is mainly determined by the diameter and material RI of optical waveguides, and more guiding modes are supported by thicker nanowires. The lowest order and first higher order of linearly polarized (LP) modes in optical waveguides are generally denominated as LP01 and LP11 modes, respectively. Once the ZnO nanowire and microfiber are placed nearby in parallel, resonant dips originating from the mode coupling between the microfiber and ZnO nanowire can be observed under phase-matching conditions in the transmission spectrum of the microfiber, and the dip wavelength is determined by the intersection point between the dispersion curves of the guiding mode supported by the microfiber and the ZnO nanowire. To simplify the operation of the ZNMC, the diameter of the microfiber used in this work is kept as ∼1 μm to realize single mode operation (i.e., only the LP01 mode can be guided in the microfiber). Fig. 5(a) shows the fundamental mode (LP01) dispersion curves for the ZnO nanowires and microfiber (calculated by the finite element method, FEM). The diameters of the ZnO nanowires are 450 nm and 550 nm, respectively, and that of the microfiber is 1.2 μm. It can be seen clearly that with the increasing of diameter, the effective RI of the ZnO nanowire increases, corresponding to the shift-up of the dispersion curve, which results in the redshift of the wavelength indicated by the intersection point. Fig. 5(b) and (c) show the corresponding experimental results. For the thicker nanowires with a lager effective RI, the resonant dip locates at longer wavelengths, which agrees well with the simulation results shown in Fig. 4(a). According to this understanding, we can deduce that the RI increase of ZnO nanowires will redshift the resonant dip.

The redshift of the ZNMC resonant wavelength under UV illumination, shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), can be attributed to the photocarrier-induced RI increase of ZnO nanowires. As we know, valence electrons in semiconductors transit from the valence band to the conduction band when the photon energy is higher than the semiconductor absorption threshold, forming photo-generated electrons and holes. The semiconductor light absorption threshold and bandgap have the following relationship: λ(nm) = 1240/Eg (eV)(2)where Eg is the bandgap energy. According to this equation, only incident radiation with a wavelength shorter than 384 nm can cause intrinsic absorption of ZnO nanowires and change the carrier concentration. The existence of carriers in semiconductors causes large changes in absorption coefficients and can easily produce a considerable change in the RI according to the Kramers–Kronig relationship:31 (3)where N and P are the concentrations of free electrons and holes, respectively. The term Δα is the change in the absorption coefficient, c is the speed of light, e is the electron charge, E is the photon energy, ħ is Planck's constant, and  indicates the principal value of the integral. According to the carrier concentration, there is a competitive relationship between the band filling effect and the bandgap shrinkage effect, and one of them will be dominant and the other will be suppressed, which has been evaluated detailedly.31 Here, bandgap shrinkage, which has been widely investigated in semiconductors,32–36 should be taken into account for the case of relatively high carrier concentrations.37 A schematic diagram of the bandgap shrinkage effect is shown in Fig. 5(d). According to Bennett et al. and the parabolic model,31,33 the absorption coefficient determined by bandgap shrinkage effects can be expressed as: (4)where χ is the concentration of free electrons or holes and C is a constant. Since ΔEg < 0, Δα is always positive. The resulting change in the RI can be calculated using eqn (3), with Δα obtained from eqn (4). This causes an increase of RI in ZnO nanowires, which produces a redshift in the resonance dip when irradiating the ZNMC structure with UV light.
The transient response for illumination with a 23.0 W cm−2 light pulse chopped at a 300 Hz frequency is shown in Fig. 6(a), while a magnification of one period is plotted in Fig. 6(b) for clarity. The response and recovery times, defined as the values needed for the low level to reach 90% of the high level and vice versa (down to 10%), are found to be ∼0.43 ms and ∼0.47 ms, respectively. Notably, the response time of 0.43 ms in the current case is faster than that of conventional electrical bridge-based ZnO UV PDs, as listed in Table 1. Fig. 6(c) shows the experimental results for light with an intensity of 23.0 W cm−2 at various chopping frequencies. It is evident that the rising edge remains constant as the frequency increases. However, when the frequency increases to be about 1 kHz, the rising edge does not reach saturation but begins to recover. This is because the response time of the ZNMC device limits the switching performance at higher operation frequencies. Fig. 6(d) shows the relationship between the photoelectric conversion voltage and illumination with light of varying intensities at a frequency of 300 Hz. It can be observed that the voltage increases with an increase in light intensity, which is consistent with previous experimental results showing a redshift in the resonance dip.

Generally, the lifetime of photogenerated carriers is extremely short. The ZMNC, employing a photocarrier-induced RI change, is expected to have a timescale comparable to the formation of electrons and holes. However, the time response of the ZNMC shown in Fig. 6(b) is rather slow compared to the lifetime of photo-induced carriers. In order to understand what factors affect the device response time, we analyze the composition of the ZnO nanowires using X-ray energy spectrum analysis, to determine if impurities are present. Fig. 7(a) shows the corresponding EDS spectrum. The results of this spectral analysis reveal elemental impurities such as Al, which was possibly doped during the growth of ZnO nanowires synthesized in a corundum (Al2O3) boat. The C and Cu signals could be from the TEM grid. On the other hand, multiple lattice defects exist in the one-dimensional ZnO nanostructures, including surface, line, and point defects.38–40 The periodic potential of atoms in these lattices, which are arranged in strict regular patterns, can possibly be compromised by these deformities. It is therefore possible to introduce energy states (i.e. energy levels) in the forbidden band and allow the existence of electrons, which influence the semiconductor properties. Fig. 7(b) depicts several transitions in the presence of impurities. When the semiconductor is in a non-equilibrium state, the impurity level has the effect of accumulating non-equilibrium carriers (trapping effect). These accumulated non-equilibrium carriers can be compared with the number of non-equilibrium carriers in the conduction and valence bands. The average time required for the electrons in the trap to excite the conduction band is much longer than the average time required for direct electron capture in the conduction band. As such, the existence of the trap significantly increases the device response times.41 Furthermore, non-equilibrium concentration distributions may cause carriers to diffuse from high to low concentrations.42 The optical penetration depth in ZnO is very short (labs ≈ 100 nm) for single-photon excitation.43 In our experiment, the diameters of the ZnO nanowires are generally larger than 500 nm. As such, only a few sections of the ZnO nanowires produce carriers. Fig. 7(c) shows the resulting photo-generated carrier diffusion. The carriers produced in the excitation region form a large concentration differential with the shielding area, which will inevitably cause carriers to spread from the illuminated face to the side of the backlight. The existence of photo-generated carrier diffusion motion may also significantly increase the device response time. Additionally, in the process of diffusion, the photoelectrons and holes continue to recombine and dissipate, which will reduce the carrier injection effect and thus the sensitivity of the device.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated an all-optical photodetection device fabricated by attaching a single ZnO nanowire to a microfiber. This fabrication process offers a simple and cost-effective structure. A systematic investigation of PD properties is conducted for the device, demonstrating several beneficial characteristics. The device offers low-noise measurements of wavelength shifts, high detection response speed, and superior time repetition. Specifically, the acquired wavelength shift represents the first measurement of its type using a single ZnO nanowire all-optical device, which is effectively immune to interference from background noise. Our analysis shows that these device properties result from changes in photo-generated carrier concentrations, which can alter the optical properties of the ZnO nanowire. The sensor can also remain stable in air for an extended period of time, as ZnO is an oxide material. This type of composite fiber structure makes this all-optical device promising for optical communication. In addition, the nanoscale dimensions conform to the trend of future integrated technology. These results could be used to design high-performance all-optical PDs using other nanomaterials.
