    , Accepted 1st November 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractThe design of molecular dyads combining a light-harvesting unit with an electroactive centre is highly demanded in the field of artificial photosynthesis. The versatile Copper-catalyzed Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC) procedure was employed to assemble a ruthenium tris-diimine unit to an unprecedented azide-substituted copper diimine–dioxime moiety. The resulting RuIICuII dyad 4 was characterized by electrochemistry, 1H NMR, EPR, UV-visible absorption, steady-state fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopies. Photoinduced electron transfer from the ruthenium to the copper centre upon light-activation in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor was established thanks to EPR-monitored photolysis experiments, opening interesting perspectives for photocatalytic applications.
Introduction
Artificial photosynthetic systems efficiently achieving light-harvesting and solar energy conversion into a chemical potential have been extensively investigated.1–7 In the field of solar fuels, their capability to ultimately drive multi-electron redox catalytic processes such as water oxidation, hydrogen evolution or CO2 reduction is a strong motivation for their development and integration into functional devices.8–13 The design and study of novel molecular dyads combining a light-harvesting unit with an electroactive moiety is thus a major target in the field of artificial photosynthesis. In these multicomponent structures, the establishment of a long-lived charge-separated state through photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer is a crucial requirement for producing functional systems.14 This is achieved by a judicious choice of the two active units, but also strongly relies on the chemical nature of the covalent bridge. The latter plays a key role in both the charge transport and the charge-separated state lifetime; however, this role is very complex to understand both from a structural and an electronic point of view.15–19 There is therefore a great interest in having in hand modular and straightforward synthetic methodologies to synthesize and study structurally-diverse dyad assemblies. In that context, the Copper(I)-catalysed Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC), one of the best-known examples of “click chemistry”, appears as a unique synthetic tool:20 this cycloaddition is efficient under mild conditions, high-yielding and compatible with most organic and metallo-organic functions. For these reasons, CuAAC has been applied to the construction of sophisticated molecular architectures in order to study photoinduced processes.21–23 This strategy has been particularly utilized for the functionalization of ruthenium polypyridine photoactive units24 by various organic moieties,25–27 nickel28,29 or iron30 complexes and for their attachment onto surfaces.31–33 However, to the best of our knowledge, CuAAC has never been employed to assemble a Ru tris-diimine photosensitizer with a copper complex, although copper also displays interesting redox properties. Photoinduced electron transfers in heterodinuclear ruthenium copper complexes have for instance been exploited to develop luminescent probes,34–36 molecular switches,37 dye-sensitized solar cells38 and also for the photochemical reduction of nitrite.39 Recently, a RuCu dyad for the photocatalytic oxidation of organic substrates mediated by dioxygen activation has also been reported.40 In this contribution, we describe the synthesis and full characterization of the first ruthenium–copper dinuclear complex assembled by CuAAC click chemistry. This dyad consists of a ruthenium polypyridine photoactive unit covalently linked to a copper(II) diimine–dioxime complex. EPR-monitored photolysis experiments have been undertaken in combination with detailed photophysical investigations to shed light on the photoinduced electron transfer processes.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Dyad 4 (Scheme 1) was synthesized by coupling an alkyne-functionalized Ru tris-diimine light-harvesting moiety 1 with an azide-substituted copper(II) diimine–dioxime redox-active unit 2. The structure of 1, bearing a functionalized imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline ligand, directly stems from supramolecular ruthenium-based assemblies previously studied in our group;41,42 additionally, properties of closely related Ru photosensitizers, displaying the same ligand pattern, are well-studied.43,44 The alkyne function was readily introduced via the preparation of the (4-ethynylphenyl)imidazolo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline ligand and its subsequent metallation with Ru(bpy)2Cl2.45 Copper(II)-diimine–dioxime complexes have been initially reported as biomimetic models for copper-containing metalloproteins.46 We previously reported the synthesis of the azido-substituted tetradentate diimine–dioxime ligand.47,48 Reaction with copper perchlorate hexahydrate was successfully achieved in 82% yield, as reported for the parent complex [Cu(DO)(DOH)pn(OH2)](ClO4).49 Deprotonation of one oxime function upon coordination to the divalent metallic salt, characteristic for the diimine–dioxime complexes,50 yields the monocationic H-bridged CuII complex 2. Its molecular structure solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals a square pyramidal geometry for the pentacoordinated copper centre. A displacement of the axially-coordinated water molecule by one oxime oxygen from a neighboring complex is observed and leads to the formation of a polymeric network within the lattice (Fig. S1†), as previously observed for [Cu(DO)(DOH)pn(OH2)](ClO4).50
 Scheme 1  CuAAC coupling between alkyne-substituted ruthenium tris-diimine complex 1 and azide-substituted copper(II) diimine–dioxime complex 2, yielding RuCu dyad 4. 
Classical CuAAC procedures, recently applied to related ruthenium tris-diimine complexes,26,51 rely on the combination of copper(II) sulfate with sodium ascorbate to generate in situ the catalytically-active copper(I) species. The reactivity of 1 under these conditions was first tested with a commercially-available benzyl azide as model partner. In our hands, the procedure was optimized by employing a homogeneous ternary solvent mixture (CH2Cl2/MeOH/H2O) and benzyltriazole-functionalized complex 3 was isolated in 65% yield after purification (see ESI†). These new conditions were then applied for the coupling of 1 with azide-functionalized complex 2. After purification by chromatography on silica gel, dyad 4 was isolated as a dark-orange powder in 55% yield.

1H NMR spectroscopy

1H NMR spectra have been recorded in CD3CN for the three Ru complexes. Spectra of compounds 3 (Fig. S2†) and 4 (Fig. S3†) are characterized by the complete disappearance of the alkyne proton signal, observed at 3.56 ppm for 1. In addition, the spectrum of 3 displays two new signals, a singlet at 5.63 ppm for the benzylic CH2 protons (Fig. S2†) and a singlet at 8.24 ppm attributed to the aromatic proton on the newly-formed 1,2,3-triazole unit (Fig. 1, red trace, arrow).
 Fig. 1  Aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectra recorded for 1, 3 and 4 in CD3CN. 
The presence of the paramagnetic CuII centre in 4 however prevents the detection of the CH3, CH2 and CH groups from the diimine–dioxime ligand in the aliphatic region of the spectrum. This is also true for the triazolyl proton, expected to appear as a singlet in the aromatic region, by comparison with 3, and for the phenylene protons ortho to the triazole ring (7.67 ppm in 1 and 8.06 ppm in 3). In addition, the signal of the two other phenylene protons appears as the large signal in the baseline around 8.4 ppm (Fig. 1, green trace, dashed arrow) and a light broadening is observed at 9.04 and 7.80 ppm for the H4/7 and H3/8 protons of the phenanthroline ring respectively (Fig. 1, green trace, dashed arrows), more distant from the CuII centre.
Electrochemistry
The electrochemical properties of dyad 4 and of the two precursors 1 and 2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Data are summarized in Table 1 and the voltammograms are displayed in Fig. S5.† Complexes 1 and 4 exhibit redox features characteristic of ruthenium tris-diimine complexes, with a reversible RuIII/RuII process at +0.88 V and +0.93 V vs. Fc+/0, respectively, thus only slightly affected by the coupling. Three reduction processes take place between −1.7 and −2.4 V vs. Fc+/0, corresponding to the reduction of the three diimine ligands in the RuII coordination sphere (the first one more likely occurring on the π-acceptor imidazolophenanthroline ligand). An additional cathodic wave is observed at – 0.95 V (Epa) for 4, attributed to the CuII/CuI process by comparison with the azide precursor 2 (Fig. S5†). Loss of reversibility is observed for this process in 4, indicative of a fast chemical reaction or structural rearrangement that can be partially outrun at higher scan rates (≥10 V s−1). Overall, redox properties of dyad 4 compare well with those from the independent Ru and Cu subunits 1 and 2, thus underlining that the two metallic centres are not coupled in the electronic ground state.

UV-vis absorption spectroscopy
Absorption spectra (Fig. 2) were recorded for 1, 2 and 4 at a concentration of 2 × 10−5 M in acetonitrile. Compounds 1 and 4 display a broad absorption band in the visible region, centred at 455 nm with a shoulder at 430 nm, characteristic of the Metal-to-Ligand-Charge-Transfer (1MLCT) transition of the ruthenium tris-diimine moiety. A slight contribution from the absorption of the copper diimine–dioxime moiety can be observed in the UV region for 4, by comparison with 2. The spin-forbidden d–d transition of the copper complex can be observed at 480 nm for this family of complexes,52 with a very low molar absorptivity (≈200 L mol−1 cm−1, Fig. S6†). Overall, the absorption spectrum of dyad 4 can be simply described as the superimposition of its individual components 1 and 2 (dotted line in Fig. 2) with a slight contribution at 326 nm tentatively attributed to the newly formed triazole ring; this observation is again in good agreement with the absence of significant ground state electronic interaction between the two electroactive moieties.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of 1 (blue), 2 (orange) and 4 (green) recorded at 2 × 10−5 M in acetonitrile and room temperature emission spectra (λexc = 450 nm) of isoabsorptive solutions of 1 (dashed blue) and 4 (dashed green) in acetonitrile. The sum of the absorption spectra of 1 and 2 is presented as the black dotted line. 
The CuI spectroscopic features have been determined by spectroelectrochemical reduction on the parent complex [Cu(DO)(DOH)pn(OH2)](ClO4). Disappearance of the weak CuII signal around 480 nm concomitantly with the appearance of a new signal at 665 nm attributed to the reduced CuI complex49,53 were observed during the course of an electrolysis experiment at an applied potential of −0.70 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. S6†).
Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy
Emission spectra (Fig. 2) were recorded for isoabsorptive solutions of 1 and 4 in acetonitrile. Typical emission signals for ruthenium tris-diimine photosensitizers are obtained, without any shift of the maximum emission wavelength (λem = 604 nm). Dyad 4 is, on the other hand, characterized by a 50% quenching of the emission of the ruthenium centre, compared to 1. Two different photoinduced processes could account for this quenching: either energy transfer or intramolecular electron transfer from the ruthenium excited state (*Ru) to the copper(II) moiety. Although the d–d band of 2 partially overlaps the emission signal of the ruthenium centre, energy transfer is very unlikely to occur: the very low absorption coefficient of this metal-centered transition indeed strongly disfavors the Förster mechanism and the Dexter mechanism is spin forbidden. According to (i) the CuII/I reduction potential (Table 1), (ii) the RuIII/II oxidation potential (Table 1) and (iii) the *Ru excited state energy E00 (2.12 eV),54,55 the oxidative quenching of *Ru by photoinduced electron transfer to the copper(II) moiety is estimated to be feasible with a relatively low thermodynamic driving force (ΔGET = −0.24 eV).56 The ability of 1,2,3-triazole bridges to mediate charge transport has been particularly evaluated with porphyrin-based dyads and triads, albeit with some differences in their efficiencies.57–60 When considering Ru tris-diimine-based assemblies, however, the few reported examples by Aukauloo and co-workers gave evidence for the efficiency of such triazole-based bridging units.25,26,28
EPR-monitored photolysis experiment
EPR spectroscopy is the technique of choice to bring any metal redox state modification to light. It has been previously employed in the literature to characterize light-induced redox processes such as oxidation of a NiII centre29 or reduction of a CuII centre40 in ruthenium-based dyads, under photolysis conditions. Reductive photolysis experiments are typically performed in the presence of a large excess of a sacrificial electron donor, such as triethylamine (TEA); the latter rapidly reacts with the oxidized photosensitizer to regenerate RuII, thus avoiding charge recombination and leading to accumulation of the targeted reduced species. To probe the occurrence of a photoinduced electron transfer with 4, a photolysis experiment was monitored using EPR. The spectrum of 4 (Fig. S7†) is characteristic for a mononuclear copper centre in axial symmetry (g∥ > g⊥) with a hyperfine coupling of 20.3 mT, similar to the azide-precursor 2 (Fig. S7†) and to the literature.53 Thus, no significant modification of the copper diimine–dioxime geometry occurs, either upon coupling with 1 (Fig. S7†), or in presence of 200 equivalents of TEA (Fig. 3; t = 0 min). However, the EPR signal decreases upon visible light irradiation and is almost completely silent after 30 minutes (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  X band EPR spectra of complex 4 (1 mM) recorded at 42 K before (a) and after 15 min (b) and 30 min (c) irradiation time in CH3CN in presence of TEA (200 molar eq.). Microwave frequency: 9.4 GHz; modulation amplitude: 12 G; modulation frequency: 100 kHz; microwave power: 0.5 mW. 
Additional experiments have shown that light and TEA are both required for the disappearance of signal (Fig. S8 and S9†). The complete disappearance of the EPR signal associated with the CuII centre in 4 thus clearly establishes that photoinduced electron transfer occurs upon light-activation of dyad 4 in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, leading to the formation of the EPR-silent reduced CuI species. Two mechanisms can operate under these photolysis conditions: (i) the oxidative quenching pathway, previously discussed in the “steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy” section, which forms a RuIIICuI intermediate before regeneration of the RuII centre by the sacrificial electron donor TEA; (ii) the reductive quenching pathway, where *Ru is first quenched by TEA, yielding a RuICuII species, that ultimately produced RuIICuI. The oxidative quenching process was unambiguously established, on the basis of time-resolved spectroscopic studies, for two dyads we previously studied: a ruthenium-cobalt one, also relying on an imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline bridging ligand,41 and more recently a ruthenium–copper assembly.40 Moreover, previous reports have established that quenching of *[Ru(bpy)3]2+ and related Ru-based photosensitizers by aliphatic amines (TEA, TEOA) was not efficient, even at high molar concentrations of the quencher,61–63 supporting the fact that a reductive quenching process is quite unlikely to occur in our system.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption studies have been carried out in order to obtain the kinetics for the photoinduced intramolecular processes. The femtosecond transient absorption spectra of complexes 1, 3 and 4 are similar (Fig. S10–S12†). Photoexcitation of the ruthenium centre with 414 nm light generates *Ru, which exhibits broad absorption at wavelengths longer than 500 nm together with ground state bleach near 450 nm. After the initial rise of these features, the spectra exhibit little change as the pump to probe delay is increased step-wise to 5.4 ns. Specifically, no new signal arises around 665 nm for 4, which would be characteristic for CuI.
In the nanosecond transient absorption experiments (Fig. S13 and S14†), stimulated emission from the *Ru excited state is observed between 565 nm and 725 nm, in addition to ground state bleaching and excited state absorption. For 3, the excited state lifetime is 1.07 ± 0.05 μs, based on the kinetics at 460 nm, 540 nm, 620 nm and 800 nm. For dyad 4, a faster excited state decay is observed, with a lifetime of 0.38 ± 0.01 μs. However, the formation of an intermediate state with a longer lifetime is very unlikely as the ground state bleach, the excited state absorbance and the emission all decay at nearly equal rates. The origin of this shortened lifetime is not clear. The presence of the paramagnetic CuII species may enhance the rate of intersystem crossing from the Ru-based 3*MLCT state back to the ground state. Alternatively, electron transfer from the *Ru excited state to the Cu(II) centre followed by faster charge recombination can also explain the increased decay rate without observation of an intermediate species. Similar behavior has been previously reported for another dyad featuring a triazole bridge, where charge separation was slower than charge recombination, thus preventing accumulation of the charge separated state to any appreciable extent.19,59
Conclusion
There is an important need for developing modular and efficient methodologies to assemble molecular photosensitizers and catalysts into covalent photocatalytic systems. Diimine-dioxime cobalt complexes are well-known as hydrogen-forming electrocatalysts.64 As a first step towards the formation of a cobalt-based photocatalytic dyad, we exploited the versatility of the CuAAC methodology to covalently couple a ruthenium tris-diimine photosensitizer with a copper diimine–dioxime redox-active unit. Dyad 4 is the first example of a dinuclear RuIICuII complex assembled through click chemistry. It has been characterized extensively by 1H NMR, cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopies. A 50% quenching of the ruthenium-centred fluorescence is observed in dyad 4, although specific signatures and kinetics related to the intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer could not be obtained from ultrafast spectroscopy experiments, possibly due to a fast recombination process. Under continuous photolysis conditions, the sacrificial electron donor, however, regenerates the ruthenium ground state faster than charge recombination and allows for photoaccumulation of the RuIICuI compound. This result opens interesting perspectives for the application of dyad 4 and derivatives in the field of photocatalysis.
Synthesis of 4
In a round bottom flask, 1 (80 mg, 0.08 mmol) and 3 (70 mg, 0.16 mmol) were dissolved in a homogeneous solvent mixture of MeOH, CH2Cl2 and H2O (3:3:1; 15 mL). The solution was degassed with argon before the addition of sodium ascorbate (80 mg, 0.39 mmol) and copper sulfate (8 mg, 0.03 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C under argon in the dark over the weekend. The organic solvents were evaporated and the desired compound was precipitated by dropwise addition of a saturated KPF6 aqueous solution. The orange precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (MeCN/0.4 M aqueous KNO3, 80:20). The fractions were concentrated and the product precipitated by dropwise addition of a saturated KPF6 aqueous solution. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried under vacuum to give 65 mg (55% yield) of 4 as a dark orange powder.
