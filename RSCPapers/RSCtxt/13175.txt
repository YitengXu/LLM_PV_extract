1. Introduction
As a significant metal chalcogenide, copper sulfide (Cu2−xS, 0 < x < 1) with a unique p-type semiconducting and nontoxic nature has received significant attention over the past few decades.1,2 Extensive investigations have been developed to the diversified Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures because of their excellent optoelectronic behavior, potential thermoelectric properties, and promising biomedical applications.2,3 For example, a number of stoichiometric compositions of Cu2−xS from copper-rich Cu2S to sulfur-rich CuS exist with different crystal structures, leading to increased electrical conductivity and tunable direct band gap values in the range of 1.2–2.0 eV.4 Exciting surface plasmon resonance can be observed in the near-infrared region (NIR) in various Cu2−xS structures owing to the formation of free charge carriers.2,3 Moreover, Cu2−xS structures with different compositions have been extensively used for both in vitro and in vivo biomedical applications.3 Therefore, Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures are suitable for applications in the fields of photocatalysis, energy conversion, and biomedicine (including non-enzymatic biosensing and chemo-/photothermal therapy),1 which has resulted in tremendous efforts being put into the rapid development of micro-/nanostructured Cu2−xS with well-controlled compositions, sizes, crystalline phases, and morphologies.
The synthetic methods previously reported for Cu2−xS nanostructures mainly involve hydro-/solvothermal, electrodeposition, microwave irradiation, thermolysis, or template-assisted approaches.2,3 To date, micro-/nanostructured Cu2−xS with a versatility in morphologies, such as zero-dimensional (0D) nanodots,5–22 one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures,23–55 two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures,56–82 three-dimensional (3D) polyhedrals, and hierarchical as well as hollow architectures,83–169 have been well-demonstrated. In particular, 0D nanodots can display a significant change in their physical and chemical properties due to the quantum confinement effect. Hollow nanostructure with a large specific surface area, low density, superior charge/mass transport, and high permeability can served as supports or active components for catalysts/drugs.172,173 An hierarchically anisotropic structure is more suitable in electronic devices owing to it allowing oriented electronic migration and structural integrity.40,174 However, investigation into the size-controlled and composition-tunable synthesis of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures is still in its infancy aside from so far highlighting the morphology-dependent properties. Consequently, the development of novel micro-/nanostructured Cu2−xS with a controllable building block and composition as well as crystalline-phase features is still an interesting and challenging topic for both fundamental study and technological application.
Moreover, functional modifications (including hybridizing and doping) of the interfacial properties and electronic structures of Cu2−xS-based micro-/nanostructures can effectively bring about enhanced performance.175 Previously, it has been demonstrated that Cu2−xS-based hybrid micro-/nanostructures in combination with other materials can exhibit manifold enhanced activities in biomedical applications.3 Consequently, a systematic investigation on the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of different micro-/nanostructured Cu2−xS can further optimize their intrinsic properties in different aspects (such as morphology, size, composition, crystalline phase, electronic structure, and heterogeneous interface), which could offer new insights to aid the development of high-performance Cu2−xS-based materials.
With consideration of the above-mentioned advancements, it is imperative to highlight the progress made in prevailing Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures. However, a comprehensive review on diverse Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures is still lacking so far. Therefore, in this review, we thoroughly summarize the important advances made in function-directed Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures (see Fig. 1). First, the crystalline structures and fundamental properties of Cu2−xS materials are covered in overview. Next, we mainly focus on the various synthetic strategies leading to the preparation of 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D micro-/nanostructured Cu2−xS with well-defined morphologies, sizes, crystalline phases, and compositions. Then, the modified Cu2−xS-based composites for enhanced performances are discussed. Finally, we highlight the various applications (including photocatalysis, energy conversion, non-enzymatic biosensing, and chemo-/photothermal therapy) of Cu2−xS-based materials. Remarks on some present issues and perspectives are also briefly given.

2. Intrinsic properties
The crystal structure of Cu2−xS can be mainly divided into three types according to the packing of sulfur atoms in the lattice: cubic close packing (anilite and digenite), hexagonal close packing (djurleite and chalcocite), and an integration of hexagonal close packing and covalent bonding of sulfur atoms (covellite).176 Among these, the anilite and digenite forms represent the most stable group thermodynamically;177 while, the crystal structures of yarrowite, spionkopite, and geerite have still not been identified experimentally. Fig. 2 shows the known crystal structures of several forms of Cu2−xS.1,178

Blue and yellow spheres are copper and sulfur atoms, respectively. 
As for the compositions, Cu2−xS with a small x value (0 < x < 1) exists in different crystalline phases ranging from copper-rich (Cu2S) to sulfur-rich (CuS). So far, the reported Cu2−xS compositions can be classified into eight different compositions: covellite (CuS), yarrowite (Cu1.12S), spionkopite (Cu1.40S), geerite (Cu1.60S), anilite (Cu1.75S, or Cu7S4), digenite (Cu1.80S, or Cu9S5), djurleite (Cu1.96S), and chalcocite (Cu2S). It is noted that all the above crystal structures of Cu2−xS possess Cu vacancies in the lattices, leading to a p-type semiconducting nature. Although the chemical formula of covelite (CuS) is simple, whereby the S ions have on average a −1 oxidation state, it has a peculiar and complex structure, which is formed by a repetition along the c axis and consisting of alternating layers of planar CuS3 triangles and CuS4 tetrahedrons with S–S bonds (see Fig. 2g).178 Effectively, it consists of a trilayer motif made of a layer of triangular CuS3 units between two layers of CuS4 tetrahedra, and the trilayers are stitched together by sulfur–sulfur covalent bonds.179 These sulfur–sulfur covalent bonds are quite important for the nanoscale transformations in covellite CuS nanocrystals in the presence of divalent metal cations (such as Hg2+ and Cd2+) at room temperature in the absence of phosphines. In this case, the combined presence of electron donors and foreign metal cations can trigger the entry of both electrons and metal cations into the covellite lattice, leading to reorganization of the anion framework because of the rupture of the sulfur–sulfur bonds.179 Moreover, Cu2S and Cu1.96S/or Cu1.80S with short Cu–Cu distances, such as in metallic Cu–Cu bonding, or short Cu–S distances can generate high electrical conductivity.180 Additionally, an interesting semimetallic character will occur as the critical temperature is 1.6 K, which makes Cu2−xS potentially act as a thermoelectric material.181 Notably, the digenite Cu1.8S porous architecture, with a second Cu1.96S phase prepared by sintering the Cu1.8S powders at 1173 K, can display a maximum dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) value of 0.5 at 673 K (Fig. 3a), because the Seebeck coefficient is enhanced while the thermal conductivity is reduced, which represents the highest value reported so far for p-type sulfide thermoelectric materials.182

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is a collective oscillation of free carriers in resonance with incident light, in which the absorption cross-section, scattering cross-section, and local electric field intensity can be importantly improved at the LSPR frequency.65 The plasmonic aspect of self-doped Cu2−xS is a result of the collective oscillation of holes—opposites to metals possessing free electrons—and is induced through oxidation, resulting in the generation of Cu vacancies; thus Cu2−xS with different compositions often lead to unique LSPR in the near-infrared region.2 In a typical UV-vis-NIR spectrum of Cu2−xS, there is an obvious absorption band in the UV-Vis range and a broad band in the near-infrared region, and so these can be considered to be promising materials for a wide range of applications.2 Although generally two main peaks are seen in the UV-vis-NIR spectrum, previous reports have confirmed that Cu2−xS was a typical direct band gap p-type semiconductor owing to the Moss–Burstein effect caused by Cu deficiency.183 The LSPR frequency is correlated with the charge-carrier density in the nanocrystals. Upon increasing the degree of Cu deficiency in Cu2−xS, the plasmonic resonance peak generally shifts to higher frequency (i.e., blue-shifts).184,185 Thus, LSPR cannot be observed in stoichiometric Cu2S nanocrystals because of the absence of free charge carriers.184 It should be noted that the classical Drude model offers a foundation for understanding the LSPR phenomenon and for relating the LSPR energy to the free carrier density. According to the Drude model, the concentration of free holes in Cu2−xS can be estimated from the peak LSPR absorbance wavelength and can be correlated with the copper deficiency (x).184 The Drude model described by theoretical formulas and Mie theory are detailed in previous references.184,185
A number of references have demonstrated that a composition-dependent, size-dependent, and shape-dependent LSPR shift (Fig. 3b–f) can occur in different types of Cu2−xS.4,66,158,177,186–191 Significantly, a fast and reversible control of the plasmonic property of Cu2−xS can be achieved through an electrochemical redox reaction, which is applied in fast-switching NIR electrochromic devices.186 In order to better understand the plasmonic property of p-type Cu2−xS semiconductors, it is imperative to highlight the energy band structure, which is defined as the difference between the bottom of the conduction band (CB) and the highest occupied state in the valence band (VB).185 In this self-doped Cu2−xS system, the highest energy levels of the VB are occupied by the extra holes. The energy of the highest occupied electron states in the VB is therefore lower than that in undoped material (such as Cu2S), resulting in an increase in the optical bandgap. In general, the bandgap value (Eg) of Cu2−xS varies with stoichiometry and increases with copper deficiency ‘x’.4,141,177 For example, a blue-shift in the bandgap was observed with an increase in copper deficiency in previous reports (Eg = 1.2 eV for Cu2S, 1.5 eV for Cu1.8S, and 2.0 eV for CuS).141 As the x value increases, holes formed near the VB will result in a shifting of the lowest occupied energy level and changing of the bandgap value. Therefore, the different crystal structures, morphologies, and compositions have been demonstrated to generate unique optical, electrical, and thermoelectric properties,2 which could enable Cu2−xS to be used in various applications, and this will be further discussed in section 5.
3. Controllable synthesis of diverse Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures
3.1 Basic synthetic principles

3.1.1 Crystal growth theory. 
Thermodynamically, the equilibrium configuration of a crystal is determined by Gibbs–Wulff's law,192 which is mainly attributed to minimization of the total surface energy. Generally, a crystallographic facet with a high surface energy would suffer disappearance or reduction from the final shape under an equilibrium environment, especially the unstable highly active facet. Kinetically, various non-equilibrium nanostructures could be prepared by tuning the precursor or reducer species, which would affect the nucleation and growth manner.193
Nevertheless, the final morphology with a specific exposed surface is a result of the interplay between the system thermodynamics and kinetics under a realistic reaction system. In particular, the introduction of capping reagent (such as surfactant agents, polymer molecules, and inorganic ions) in a liquid-phase reaction system is key for tuning the formation of a specific crystallographic facet based on the facet-selective adsorption mechanism, which can be viewed as an effective pathway to decrease the surface energy and form a non-equilibrium Wulff construction. Here, the capping facet will be retained, but the uncapping facets will disappear. To date, this viewpoint has been well-demonstrated in previous references,194–198 and this offers a guideline for preparing micro-/nanostructures with desired crystallographic facets.
As for Cu2−xS nanocrystals, the selectivity and capability of a capping agent on different facets is basically driven by the surface charge of the corresponding facet, so the selection of a capping agent with proper electronegativity is vital for controlling the preserved facet of the Cu2−xS crystal. Organic capping agents can play a crucial role in achieving the controllable synthesis of Cu2−xS nanostructures because of their versatilities and availabilities. Furthermore, the supersaturation of growth species can also determine the surface energy of an exposed facet during a thermodynamical dissolution–recrystallination hydro-/solvothermal growth.199,200


3.1.2 General synthetic approach. 
Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods can effectively enable accelerating the solubility of a reactant in a solvent and speed up the chemical reaction process, ultimately attaining a rapid supersaturation under high temperature and pressure conditions. Thus, the synthesis of diversified Cu2−xS nanostructures has been successfully achieved by this method.31–36,60,72,74,75,79,90,92,94–98,102,104,108,111,113–115,117–119,121,149,151,152,154,164,169 Different capping agents can be extensively employed to stabilize the narrow size distribution and dispersity in 0D nanodots, specific high-energy facets in 1D and 2D nanostructures, and 3D superstructures with controllable building blocks.
Thermolysis is an alternative approach and involves the formation of Cu2−xS nanostructures by the thermal decomposition of Cu–S complexes as single-source precursors (including copper alkylthiolate159,201 copper thiolate polymer,190 copper alkylthiophosphates,202 copper dithiooxamide,33 and copper alkyldithiocarbamate complexes203). The hot-injection method could also be considered as an effective solvent-mediated or straightforward surfactant-assisted nonaqueous thermolysis of Cu–S complex.5,66 This strategy is useful to prepare uniform, monodisperse, and well-defined Cu2−xS nanostructures from a mixture of organic solvents and specific capping agents in standard Schlenk equipment,5,14,26,66,204–207 which is similar to that used in Bawendi and coworkers’ method for synthesizing monodisperse Cd chalcogenides.208 The general synthetic mechanism involves the sudden addition of cold reactants into a hot solvent/or surfactant, resulting in a sudden burst of nucleation and the subsequent growth of nuclei in the presence of the surfactant.209 Based on a thermodynamic viewpoint, the sum of the volume-energy (the energy generated when solution monomers are incorporated into growing nuclei) and surface energy (the energy that must be spent to create new solid–solution interfaces) is significant for the growth of a nanocrystal.66 In this theory, the contribution of the volume-energy depends on the chemical potential of the solution monomers and time evolution, while the surface energy is dominated by the crystal geometry and the presence of surface-adhering ligands or surfactants, which would result in the formation of a size and shape dependence of polymorphs.66 Therefore, besides the hot-injection temperature, the choice of surfactant and solvent species is also crucial for the size- and shape-controlled synthesis of copper sulfides. For example, Xie and coworkers synthesized a series of monodisperse copper sulfide nanocrystals with anisotropic disk-like shapes and controlled sizes through a straightforward surfactant-assisted nonaqueous hot-injection route, which involved the fast addition of a room temperature S/oleyl amine solution to a suitably composed mixture of copper chloride/oleyl amine/oleic acid/1-octadecene preheated at 180 °C under an inert atmosphere, followed by a short annealing period.66 This method can further be expanded for the shape-/size-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS-based heterogeneous nanocomposites.84,183,210–212 It is noted that the microwave-assisted thermolysis of Cu–S complex precursors in the frequency range of 0.3 to 2.45 GHz is also a useful strategy to synthesize Cu2−xS nanostructures, whereby the electromagnetic energy is converted into thermal energy, which then induces a chemical reaction toward the synthesis of nanomaterials.30,48,213–217
Electrodeposition or anodization is another facile and low-cost method to directly prepare 3D hierarchical Cu2−xS nanostructures onto substrates, in which Cu2−xS nanostructures can be grown on copper substrates or on copper foil acting as an anode and titanium metal as a cathode in the voltage range of 1.5–8 V in Na2S aqueous solution.57,112,218,219
The hard-template-assisted strategy is the most effective method to synthesize Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures with controllable sizes, morphologies, and hollow/porous features, which can copy the character of the template and inherit it into the appearance of the final product after removal of the template. This approach can be divided into three steps: (i) preparation of the template, (ii) direct synthesis of the target material using the above template, and (iii) removal of the template (if necessary).220 In the next section, we present a detailed discussion on the corresponding formation mechanisms by using different hard templates.
Notably, the synthesis of uniform and monodisperse Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures is of great significance to their practical applications. As a result, more modern techniques for both physical and chemical characterizations of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures are imperative. These techniques can provide important information on their elemental, structural (including size, crystalline phase, composition, and morphology), and electronic as well as optical properties. The characterization of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures could be performed by using a wide variety of techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) high resolution TEM (HRTEM), and UV-visible-NIR as well as photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and so on.

3.2 Diverse Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures
According to the above crystallographic growth theory and synthetic strategies, a number of well-defined Cu2−xS architectures with specific exposed surfaces or building blocks have been reported. The controllable synthesis of different Cu2−xS nanostructures is beneficial to revealing the relationship between the structure and performance, and offers a good opportunity to employ appropriate components or substrates to further expand their applications.
In this section, we overview the previous synthetic strategies on the controllable synthesis of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures. The advances in the size-, phase-, and morphology-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures are summarized. In particular, we focus on the Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures with versatilities from 0D, 1D, and 2D to different 3D architectures (including polyhedral, hierarchical, hollow micro-/nanostructures and superlattices). The synthesis pathways and characters of some Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures are shown in Table 1.

3.2.1 Zero-dimensional (0D) nanodots. 
As a promising nanostructure, 0D Cu2−xS nanodots possess unique size-dependent optical properties, which opens up new opportunities for applications in the fields of light harvesting, nonlinear optics, and quantum information processing.5 Therefore, the development of new synthetic strategies for synthesizing 0D Cu2−xS nanodots is imperative. Currently, the capping-agent-assisted wet chemical method is the most common pathway to synthesize 0D Cu2−xS nanodots, such as in the low-temperature redox reaction,6,8–13 hot-injection method,5,7,14,15,17,21 microemulsion-assisted method,20 and microwave-assisted decomposition method.16 As shown in Fig. 4a,6 it can be clearly seen that water-soluble, monodispersed CuS nanodots (the average diameter is about 5 nm) were prepared at room temperature through the route of trapping the reaction intermediate (copper(II) chloride (CuCl2·2H2O)/sodium citrate dehydrate/sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O)) using thiol-terminated, alkyl-containing short-chain poly(ethylene glycol)s (HS-(CH2)11-(OCH2CH2)6-OH, abbreviated as MUH). These MUH-coated CuS nanoclusters have superior stabilities in solution with varying the pH value and were stable in pure water for at least 10 months, and also displayed good potential anticancer and antibacterial performances. Monodisperse digenite Cu1.8S nanodots with an average diameter of 6.6 nm (see Fig. 4b) were synthesized at the gram scale following a typical hot-injection method by injecting a copper precursor into a sulfur precursor in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid as ligands as well as 1-octadecene as a solvent.14 In this synthesis, the copper precursor was first prepared by mixing CuCl with a mixture of oleylamine and oleic acid at 130 °C under continuous mechanical stirring. Subsequently, the above copper precursor was naturally cooled to room temperature. The sulfur precursor was prepared in a three-necked bottle by dissolving sulfur powder into 1-octadecene at 200 °C under mechanical stirring. Then, the sulfur solution was then set to 180 °C, followed by a swift injection of copper precursor and kept at this temperature for 5 to 15 min, resulting in a black colloidal solution. Afterwards, the heated organic molecular solution was removed and cooled to room temperature. Finally, Cu1.8S nanodots with different sizes from ∼6.6 to ∼17.3 nm were obtained. It was noted that the as-synthesized colloidal nanocrystals underwent an in situ phase-transformation from rhombohedral Cu1.8S nanocrystals to hexagonal CuS clusters upon keeping the resulting colloidal solution for a few days. The Cu1.8S nanocrystals and CuS clusters exhibited composition-dependent LSPR in the near-infrared region. Djurleite Cu1.94S nanodots (see Fig. 4c) were synthesized by the thermolysis of the copper(II) acetylacetonate/dodecanethiol in oleylamine at 200 °C under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere.18 Pure anilite Cu1.75S nanodots (see Fig. 4d) were synthesized, whereby a solution of copper(II) complex of 1,1,5,5-tetra-iso-propyl-2-thiobiuret precursor in octadecene was injected into hot oleylamine.19 Additionally, colloidal Cu2S nanodots (as shown in Fig. 4e) were prepared by following an injection reaction between copper(II) acetylacetonate and ammonium diethyldithiocarbamate in a mixed solvent of dodecanethiol and oleic acid.21 Moreover, Cu2−xS nanodots with various compositions and sizes were successfully synthesized by a modified hot-injection method (see Fig. 4f),15 which indicated that the LSPRs in these Cu2−xS nanodots originate from ligand-confined carriers.18,22 Similarly, Dai and coworkers demonstrated revertible shifts of the LSPR in CuS nanodisks, in which oleylamine acted as both a solvent and surface ligand covering on the CuS nanodisks during the thermolysis of a single-source copper ethylxanthate precursor.22 In this case, the revertible shifts of the LSPR by unloading and reloading the surface ligands on the CuS nanodisks was achieved, which could be attributed to the oxygen exposure and repassivation on the surfaces of the CuS nanocrystals. Therefore, the surface ligands-dependent shift of the LSPR can be attributed to the concentration of free holes in CuS nanodisks, which was controlled by the coverage and exchange of surface ligands as well as the oxygen exposure dose and time. Previous references demonstrated that the decomposition of ligands and oxidation is an effective strategy to tailor the composition and crystal phase of the above-mentioned surface ligands-dependent Cu2−xS, which results in a variation in the copper vacancies.15,18 For example, the post-oxidation of Cu2−xS nanodots (as shown in Fig. 4f) can lead to a decrease in the ratio between Cu2+ and Cu+, which in turn results in a broadening, decreased intensity, and red-shifting of the LSPRs.15 However, an obvious LSPR wavelength blue-shift that occurred in the djurleite nanocrystals was found after exposure to oxygen for different times as compared to that measured immediately on the fresh product, likely due to the increase in the hole (i.e., copper vacancies) density of djurleite nanocrystals in air. It should be noted that the hole density generated by the oxidation process will reach saturation gradually, ultimately leading to a decrease in the LSPR blue-shift after a long exposure time in air.18 A similar phenomenon was seen in Cu2−xS quantum dots due to exposure to oxygen.189 Briefly, the reason for the LSPR shift is complex, but could be attributed to the composition of Cu2−xS, and the effects of ligand coverage, oxygen exposure dose, and time. To date, the contradiction between an LSPR blue-shift and red-shift has not been well-explained, thus an in-depth investigation of this should be carried out.

Based on the above results, it is proposed that novel Cu2−xS nanodots with a large range of compositions could be synthesized by rationally adjusting the source materials or by introducing proper additives. However, the stability of the ultra-small nanodots is a significant factor for determining their practical applications.


3.2.2 One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures. 
Nanorods. 
Twinned CuS nanorods (see Fig. 5a) can be prepared by an in situ source-template-interface refluxing reaction at low temperature, in which CuCl2·2H2O and CS2 act as Cu- and S-precursors, respectively, and ethylenediamine as the attacking reagent to release S2−.23 CS2 is insoluble in water and remains as tiny oil-droplets, also acting as a microreactor. Moreover, the hydrothermal approach has also been used for the controllable synthesis of CuS nanorods. For example, Jin and coworkers reported that CuS nanorods could be synthesized in a mixture of CuCl2/Na2S/poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) under a hydrothermal condition (180 °C, 24 h).24 The gas–solid reaction is one alternative approach to synthesize copper sulfide nanorods.25 As shown in Fig. 5b, Cu2S nanorod arrays can be obtained by passing a steady flow of H2S gas at 10 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), O2 gas at 80 sccm, and N2 gas (saturated with H2O) at 160 sccm over a polished copper substrate.25 It was noted that O2 gas acted as a necessary reactant, but no copper oxide was observed in the product, suggesting that O2 played a different role from in a common oxidation reaction. The proposed growth mechanism was as follows. Initially, H2S and O2 react to produce H2O and S2−. Then, S2− forms a close-packed sublattice, the polyhedral sites of which are occupied by Cu+. However, ionic vacancies (VCu) are generated in the absence of Cu+, which can subsequently diffuse in Cu2S to reach the copper substrate and become the driving force for this growth. Afterwards, a layer of Cu2S seeds are formed on the copper substrate, and the volumetric expansion as well as the annihilation of VCu by the defects in the Cu2S film finally results in cracks in the Cu2S film, generating nanorod arrays. In particular here, H2O acts as an indispensable reagent to facilitate charge transfer and ionic vacancy formation. The formation of nanorods is governed by the difference in Cu+ vacancy diffusion in various crystal directions. Moreover, the hot-injection method can be used to synthesize 1D Cu2−xS nanorods. As shown in Fig. 5c,26 a series of nanorods with different lengths could be easily formed between 10 and 100 nm by choice of the appropriate hot-injection temperature. In a typical synthesis, copper(I) acetate is first dissolved together with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in 1-octadecene (ODE) at a specific temperature before the sulfur source tert-dodecanethiol (t-DDT) is injected. After the injection, fine-tuning the temperature selection can enable one to accurately control the sizes and shapes of the Cu2−xS nanocrystals. In this reaction, tert-dodecanethiol as the sulfur source is the key for tailoring Cu2−xS nanocrystals, which can be easily decomposed at elevated temperature and can offer the reaction solution with reactive sulfur monomers. In addition, electrodeposition,27 the gas-assisted polymer template route,28 and the ultrasonication/microwave-assisted method29,30 can also be applied in the controllable preparation of 1D Cu2−xS nanorods.

Nanowires. 
As a perspective nanostructure, nanowires with a large surface-to-volume ratio have attracted much attention in the past few decades. 1D Cu2−xS nanowires can be widely applied in the fields of sensing, energy conversion, and catalysis. Consequently, the development of new synthetic strategies for the synthesis of novel 1D Cu2−xS nanowires is significant to expand their practical applications. Overviewing the reported references, it can be found that the hydrothermal method is the most common strategy for facilely synthesizing 1D Cu2−xS nanowires. For example, ultralong CuS nanowires (see Fig. 6a) could be synthesized at a large-scale by a two-step method.31 First, copper nanostructures were synthesized by hydrothermal heating a mixture of copper chloride/hexadecylamine/glucose at 120 °C. Then, a second hydrothermal treatment was applied to the above copper with Na2S solution for obtaining the final CuS nanowires. Cu7S4 nanowires (as shown in Fig. 6b) were synthesized by a modified hydroxide-mediated hydrothermal approach at 200 °C, in which the reaction agent only involved CuCl2, Na2S, and NaOH in the absence of any organic surfactant.32 CuS nanowires have also been successfully prepared from a single-source Cu-dithiooxamide precursor under hydrothermal conditions (120 °C, 24 h).33 During the hydrothermal process, a polymer structure-directing agent (such as PEG (polyethylene glycol)–PPG (polypropylene glycol)–PEG polymer,34 ethylenediamine,35 and DNA36) was crucial for the final structure-tailoring. Similarly, organogel acting as a template can be used for preparing CuS nanofibers, as shown in Fig. 6c.37 It was found that the morphologies of the CuS nanofibers could be adjusted by adjusting the binding sites between the inorganic precursor and the organogel. For example, when H2S gas acted as the sulfur source, straight and bendy helical CuS nanofibers with a pitch of 100–200 nm could be synthesized in butyl acetate and benzene–butanol gel systems, respectively, while bendy CuS nanofibers with a similar helical pitch (∼50 nm) were formed when thioacetamide was used as the sulfur source.

The choice of precursor species is also important for tuning the morphologies of Cu2−xS nanocrystals. Qian and coworkers demonstrated that single-crystalline, high aspect ratio, and ultrathin nanowires of hexagonal-phase Cu2S (as shown in Fig. 6d) could be effectively synthesized through the thermal decomposition of CuS2CNEt2 in a mixed surfactant solvent of dodecanethiol and oleic acid at 160 °C.38 The as-prepared Cu2S nanowires were usually aligned in the form of bundles with a thickness of hundreds of nanometers, and the diameter of each nanowire was about 1.7 nm, and the length was in the tens of micrometers. Copper foil was an important precursor for synthesizing Cu2S39–42 or CuS43 nanowires by the combination of oxidation and sulfonation in an O2/H2S atmosphere at higher temperature. In addition, the growth of CuS nanowires could also be carried out in a Cu2+/thiourea solution by employing an electrodepositon method.44
Nanotubes. 
The self-sacrificial template strategy is widely used in synthesizing 1D Cu2−xS nanotubes. In this synthesis, a sacrificial template was initially synthesized in the reaction system, and then this template core could be removed alongside the formation of the Cu2−xS shell through an etching reaction or via the Kirkendall effect.45,46 Xie and coworkers found that hierarchical tubular CuS assembled by nanoflake-built microspheres (see Fig. 7a) could be synthesized in a high yield by the oxidative decomposition of a Cu3(TAA)3Cl3 intermediate complex serving as a self-sacrificed template at 60 °C for 24 h.47 In this reaction, the combination of copper ions and thioacetamide (TAA) in the mixed solution produced a yellow hexagonal prism-shaped Cu3(TAA)3Cl3 complex, which then was oxidized to form a brown CuS product in the decomposition process. Similarly, Xue and coworkers demonstrated that Cu-complex Cu(thiourea)Cl·0.5H2O nanowires formed in ambient conditions acted as self-sacrificing templates to prepare uniform CuS nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 7b.48 Xiao and coworkers reported a similar method for synthesizing uniform CuS nanotubes.49 Additionally, other templates, such as [Cu-(TAA)2]Cl2 complex,50 electrospun sulfur fibers,51 and CuCl,52 have also been used for preparing novel CuS nanotubes. Typical CuS nanotube arrays synthesized by CuCl precursors are displayed in Fig. 7c.52 Furthermore, 1D Cu2−xS nanotubes could be synthesized through the sulfonation of copper nanowires based on a Kirkendall-type diffusion process.53–55 Here, typically, copper nanowires were first prepared as the precursors. Then sulfur ions (S2− or HS−) diffused onto the surface of Cu nanowires and reacted with Cu atoms to form a layer of Cu2−xS, which resulted in an interface separating the inner copper and the outside sulfur ions. With the reaction time increasing, the diffusion of sulfur ions into the inner wall was hindered by the Cu2−xS layer, while Cu atoms could diffuse outwards by vacancy exchange and could react with sulfur ions in solution to form Cu2−xS at the outer walls of the 1D structure. Finally, the Cu/Cu2−xS yolk–shell nanostructures grew continuously until complete conversion to pure Cu2−xS nanotubes was achieved.53 Typical Cu2−xS nanotubes products synthesized based on the above growth mechanism are shown in Fig. 7d.53 However, it was clearly found that the as-mentioned Cu2−xS nanotubes generally possess a larger diameter, which might affect their specific surface areas. Therefore, the diameter-controlled synthesis of novel 1D Cu2−xS nanotubes is still a challenge.

3.2.3 Two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. 
So far, various 2D Cu2−xS nanostructures with different x values have been reported by a number of synthetic strategies. Herein, we discuss the synthetic pathways and growth mechanisms of different 2D Cu2−xS nanostructures in detail.
2D Cu2S nanostructures. 
As a type of indirect bandgap semiconductor, Cu2S nanocrystals are expected to be perspective candidates for optical devices. In the past decades, several types of Cu2S nanocrystals, including the above-mentioned nanorods and nanowires, have been prepared. 2D Cu2S nanostructures with larger exposed specific crystal facets might bring amazing properties for expanding their applications. Xie and coworkers developed a solution-phase template approach to synthesize 2D Cu2S nanoribbons.56 In this case, Bi2S3 nanoribbons acted as both the template and reactant when treated with small CuCl particles, generating Cu2S nanoribbons with the assistance of the solvent ethanol under hydrothermal conditions. Ethanol was important to obtain a pure Cu2S product. During the reaction, the by-product BiCl3 could be dissolved in ethanol, which reduced the Gibbs energy of this reaction and ensured the completeness of the solid–solid reaction. In contrast, this reaction did not occur when water was used as the solvent, because all the reactants and products were not dissolved. Additionally, CuCl particles could not be substituted by Cu+ solution, indicating that the reaction between Bi2S3 and CuCl followed a solid–solid mechanism. The corresponding SEM image and XRD pattern are given in the left-hand side of Fig. 8a.56 Cu2S nanowall arrays were prepared by the potentiostatic anodization of pure copper at voltages between 1.5 and 8 V in an electrolyte consisting of an aqueous solution of sodium sulfide (see the top of the right-hand side of Fig. 8a).57 The hot-injection route can also be used for the preparation of Cu2S nanodisks.187 Li and coworkers successfully achieved the synthesis of 2D Cu2S nanosheets with a thickness of 1.2 nm in a mixed organic–inorganic system of benzoic acid/benzyl alcohol/vulcanized polyisoprene/PVP/cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)/cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC)/CuCl2 (see the bottom of the right-hand side of Fig. 8a).187 In this process, the use of vulcanized polyisoprene as the sulfur precursor was vital for the formation of Cu2S nanosheets.

2D Cu1.94S nanostructures. 
Reports on 2D Cu1.94S nanostructures are fewer in the literature. Lee and coworkers though reported a facile one-pot scalable synthetic route for preparing highly monodisperse djurleite Cu1.94S hexagonal nanoplates.59 In a typical synthesis, a slurry of CuSCN in oleylamine was prepared in a Schlenk tube. After placing the reaction mixture under vacuum at 100 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was charged with 1 atm Ar gas. Then, the Schlenk tube was placed in a hot oil bath, which was preheated to 240 °C. After heating for 30 min, Cu1.94S hexagonal nanoplates were synthesized. The thermal decomposition of a single precursor CuSCN was suitable for preparing multi-gram scale of highly monodisperse Cu1.94S hexagonal nanoplates, which displayed absorption signals in a wide range from UV to NIR and an optical phase change. The results are shown in Fig. 8b.59
2D Cu1.8S nanostructures. 
Vertical CuS nanosheet arrays were synthesized on transparent conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by a facile solvothermal process in the presence of ethanol solvent only containing thiourea and Cu(NO3)2 as a sulfur and copper source.60 Whereas, selecting CuCl instead of Cu(NO3)2 as the copper precursor under otherwise the same conditions, porous Cu1.8S nanosheets (see the top three images of Fig. 8c), for the first time, were also vertically grown on FTO substrates.60 High-quality Cu1.8S nanocrystal films (see the bottom of the left two images of Fig. 8c) were obtained by a spin-casting method, which displayed rich optical and electrical properties upon thermal annealing.61 In addition, 2D single-crystalline Cu9S5 nanosheets containing irregular hexagonal holes (see the bottom of the right images of Fig. 8c) were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal treatment of a solution of copper dichloride dihydrate and thiourea at 180 °C without any surfactants or capping agents.62 Irregular hexagonal holes were widely distributed over the Cu9S5 nanosheets, which efficiently enlarge the surface area. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy suggested an obvious improvement of the near-IR absorbance.62 Furthermore, Cu7.2S4 nanodisks with a mean size of ∼20 nm were prepared by a simple thermal decomposition of copper diethyldithiocarbamate [Cu(DEDTC)2] precursor, and exhibited strong NIR absorption (see Fig. 8d).63 The precursor was prepared by mixing diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC) and CuCl2 solution at room temperature. Then, the [Cu(DEDTC)2] precursor was injected into the oleylamine and oleic acid solvent at 240–260 °C for 4–10 min. Finally, dark green Cu7.2S4 products were obtained.63
2D Cu1.75S nanostructures. 
Moreover, high-quality roxbyite Cu7S4 nanodisks (see Fig. 8e) were prepared in an O2-free synthesis,65 in which a mixture of copper stearate/N,N-dibutylthiourea/O2-free oleylamine was heated at 80 °C under N2 while stirring. After 1 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then, the product was moved into an argon-filled glove box and transferred to a centrifuge tube. After centrifugation with O2-free toluene/ethanol solvent, the precipitate was dispersed in O2-free toluene or chloroform and stored in the glove box. In this case, the average yield of Cu7S4 nanodisks was 95%, which displayed a typical LSPR peak in the near-infrared region.65
2D CuS nanostructures. 
Morphologically 2D CuS nanocrystals have widely investigated in the past years.66–79 Monodisperse hexagonal-like CuS nanodisks were synthesized through a solvothermal method, which involved a fast injection of sulfur/1-octadecene (ODE) solution into a mixture of CuCl/hexadecylamine (see the first and second images in the top of Fig. 8f).73 These hexagonal-like CuS nanodisks displayed broad transient absorption in the visible region, which could be attributed to the photoinduced hot and trapped holes. Faceted CuS triangular nanoprisms (see the third image in the top of Fig. 8f) exhibiting highly shape-dependent LSPR modes were successfully synthesized by a halide-ions-assisted solvothermal strategy.74 Also, the authors found that halide anions (Cl−, Br−, I−) played a significant role in the morphology of CuS (covellite) nanocrystals based on the Ostwald ripening processes. Uniformly round disk-shaped CuS nanostructures with a narrow size distribution (see the fourth image in the top of Fig. 8f) was achieved in a Cu(NO3)2/CS(NH2)2 system by a low-temperature (150 °C) solvothermal process using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the surfactant.75 The chemical vapor reaction was developed to synthesize single-crystalline CuS hexagonal nanoplates (see the first image in the bottom of Fig. 8f), in which sulfur vapor reacted with copper films in a vacuum chamber at 450 °C for 7 h.76 Similarly, chemical bath deposition has been used to synthesize CuS thin nanofilms in a CuCl2/CH3CSNH2 system (see the second image in the bottom of Fig. 8f), and the morphology was tailored by adjusting the reaction time. The CuS thin film exhibited free carrier intraband absorption in the longer wavelength region, which could be employed in photovoltaic devices.77 In addition, CuS networks or nanobelts (see the third and fourth images in the bottom of Fig. 8f) have been reported.78,79
2D Cu2−xS nanostructures. 
Copper sulfide (Cu2−xS) nanocrystals with nonstoichiometric compositions possess various plasmon resonance in the near-infrared region.80 Compositional changes can markedly affect the position and intensity of the plasmon resonance. Kamat and coworkers reported a photochemically induced phenomenon of being able to adjust the plasmon resonance in controlled 2D Cu2−xS nanostructures.81 The synthesis of 2D Cu2−xS nanodisks was achieved by mixing the sulfur, oleylamine, and octadecene at 130 °C, and followed by the addition of copper(I) chloride and heating to 200 °C. As photogenerated reduced methyl viologen radicals transferred electrons to Cu2−xS in inert solutions, a decrease in the LSPR absorbance at 1160 nm was observed (see Fig. 8g). Interestingly, the plasmon resonance band could recover as stored electrons were scavenged away by oxygen upon exposure to air. This recycle of electron charge and discharge of Cu2−xS nanocrystals was reversible and could be repeated through photo-irradiation in N2-saturated solution followed by exposure of the suspension to air.81 Moreover, the plasmonic 2D Cu2−xS nanostructures could act as smart light-driven sterilants for permanent male sterilization.82 However, it is still a challenge to develop new strategies to effectively synthesize 2D Cu2−xS nanostructures with controlled compositions.


3.2.4 Three-dimensional (3D) micro-/nanostructures. 
Polyhedral architectures. 
The shape-controlled synthesis of polyhedral Cu2−xS was successfully realized by a convenient hot-injection strategy with the assistance of Al2(SO4)3.83 The composition and morphology of polyhedral Cu2−xS can evolve from CuS hexagonal nanoplates to Cu1.12S nanotetrahedra or Cu1.8S nanocubes in the reaction between copper(I) chloride (CuCl) with sulfur in 1-octadecene (ODE) and 1-hexadecanamine (HDA), as shown in Fig. 9a.83 In a typical synthesis, sulfur dissolved in ODE under an argon (Ar) atmosphere at 110 °C acted as the sulfur source. Subsequently, the sulfur in ODE was rapidly injected into a reaction flask containing copper(I) chloride/HAD/ODE through a syringe at 110 °C. Then, the above mixture was allowed to react for 5 min and afterwards it was quickly cooled down to 70 °C. Notably, oleic acid was added to the mixture at 70 °C, to substitute the weakly bound HDA during this cooling process. When Al2(SO4)3 was present in the reaction solution at 110 °C, Cu1.12S nanotetrahedra were synthesized. When heated to 220 °C, the hexagonal Cu1.12S nanotetrahedra were tuned to Cu1.8S nanocubes. These Cu2−xS nanocrystals were active catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

The sulfide source is important for the facet-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS. For example, 12-facet Cu1.94S nanocrystals (see Fig. 9b) were obtained by directly heating a dodecanethiol solution of copper acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) under the protection of nitrogen gas.84 Furthermore, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) could also be used in the shape-controlled synthesis of octahedral and 14-facet Cu1.96S architectures, as shown in Fig. 9c.85 In this case, the reaction system was equipped with a base pressure of 0.1 Torr and multiple gas flow controllers and a vacuum pump downstream. Several 5 mm wide Si or glass substrates were placed downstream at different positions around the boat containing the copper source. First, copper(II) chloride solid was placed in a porcelain boat inside the quartz tube at the center of the furnace, and a second porcelain boat containing sulfur powder was placed upstream just outside the mouth of the furnace ceramic insulation. When the target temperature and pressure were reached (550 °C, 1.5 atm) under 150 sccm of Ar flow, the sulfur boat was inserted immediately inside the mouth of the furnace, and this started to flow with Ar for 5 min. After that, the hydrogen gas was shut off and the reaction was further carried out for another 10 min under an Ar flow. Finally, the products were formed on the substrates. Additionally, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) could be developed for preparing the polyhedral Cu7S4 hollow architectures (see Fig. 9d).86 The detailed growth mechanism and composition/morphology-controllable synthesis are discussed in the following section on hollow architectures.
Hierarchical architectures. 
The controllable synthesis of 3D hierarchical Cu2−xS nanostructures with highly active building blocks brings about high specific surface areas and facilitate the mass migration, leading to an improvement in performance. In this subsection, we discuss the growth of hierarchical Cu2−xS architectures by three different formation mechanisms: the hard-template, soft-template, and template-free strategies.
Hard-template strategy for synthesizing hierarchical architectures. 
So far, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), CuO, and CdS have acted as hard templates for synthesizing hierarchical Cu2−xS nanostructures or their hybridizing composites. For example, octahedral Cu1.96S/carbon composites were easily fabricated by a wet-treatment of Cu-based MOFs. As shown in Fig. 10a,87 the as-produced octahedral particles contain many nanoparticles building blocks, and the carbon element obviously exists in the products. First, the Cu-BTC MOF (HKUST-1) template was synthesized by using copper nitrate and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as starting materials under hydrothermal conditions. Then, the HKUST-1 reacted with sulfur powders at high temperature, thus the copper ions within the HKUST-1 frameworks were converted to uniform copper sulfide nanoparticles, while the organic ligand was in situ carbonized to porous octahedral carbon, finally leading to the formation of Cu1.96S/C composites. Similarly, Cu1.96S/C nanosheets synthesized by directly sulfurizing HKUST-1 with sulfide powder was achieved.88 However, when the reaction was between HKUST-1 and Na2S aqueous solution, the irregular CuS nanoparticles were formed.89

The shuttle-like CuO can be sulfurized by thiourea under a hydrothermal environment, and the reaction temperature and solvent are key factors here for achieving the morphology-controlled synthesis of CuS hierarchical architectures. As the reaction was carried out at 100 °C in an aqueous system, trepang-like CuS was formed. When the reaction was carried out at 180 °C in an ethylene glycol system, flower-like CuS could be synthesized. The corresponding microscopy characterizations are presented in Fig. 10b.90
It is also noted that the cation-exchange reaction is a perspective strategy for the synthesis of new hierarchical Cu2−xS nanocrystals. Xu and coworkers demonstrated that ordered mesoporous CdS can be successfully converted to crystalline CuS materials by a cation-exchange reaction without destroying the well-defined nanostructure (see Fig. 10c).91 In the first step, a mesoporous CdS was fabricated by using KIT-6 as a template. Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and thiourea acted as metal and sulfur sources were dissolved in ethanol and were then impregnated into the KIT-6 template. Nanostructured crystalline CdS was formed inside the KIT-6 template by heating the precursors at 160 °C in a common oven; finally an ordered mesoporous crystalline CdS was synthesized by removing the mesoporous silica template using NaOH etching. Then, the cation-exchange reaction between CdS and Cu(NO3)2 was carried out in a mixed solvent of ethanol and glycerol in an 8:2 volume ratio. Finally, mesoporous CuS hierarchical architectures could be prepared after a long-term cation-exchange process.
Soft-template strategy for synthesizing hierarchical architectures. 
Surfactants, such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), are important for the synthesis of hierarchical Cu2−xS architectures, in which they play the role of a soft confinement agent.92,93 For example, hydrophilic flower-like CuS superstructures as an efficient 980 nm laser-driven photothermal agent for the ablation of cancer cells can be synthesized by hydrothermal heating of a mixed solution of CuCl2/PVP/Na2S (see Fig. 11a).94 Monodisperse and highly homogeneous CuS caved superstructures have been fabricated by solvothermal heating of a mixted solution of CuSO4/PVP/sulfur powder/ethylene glycol (see Fig. 11b).95 Various ball-flower-shaped CuS structures have also been synthesized by solvothermal heating of a mixed solution of CuCl2/PVP/thiourea. The final shapes of these hierarchical CuS architectures were determined by the reaction temperature and the concentration of reaction agents. Typical SEM images of the ball-flower-shaped CuS hierarchical structures are shown in Fig. 11c.96 Porous flower-like Cu2S microspheres (as shown in Fig. 11d) were synthesized through a solvothermal method employing CuCl and thiourea as the Cu and S sources, respectively, and PVP as a surfactant.97 Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) has also been used as a sulfur source for the controllable synthesis of hierarchical CuS architectures.98

Template-free strategy for synthesizing hierarchical architectures. 
The template-free approach is an alternative promising strategy to synthesize hierarchical architectures with controllable building blocks, and could be divided into two types: self-templating and self-aggregating. Up to date, a number of references have focused on the template-free synthesis of copper sulfide.101–110
Novel hierarchical wool-ball-like CuS microflowers with 3D porous frameworks (see Fig. 12a) were successfully synthesized by a one-pot reaction of copper with sulfur powder using an in situ growth method at low temperature (60 °C).111 To the best of our current knowledge, the synthesis of massive CuS microflowers at low temperature has never been reported. In a typical synthesis, sulfur powders were dissolved in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/HCl solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave. As the sulfur powder and HCl uniformly dispersed in the DMF, subsequently a copper foam was added. The temperature of the autoclave was maintained at 60 °C for 16 h, and finally the CuS was formed on the copper substrate. Here, HCl was an important factor for controlling the morphology of the products. Significantly, the as-prepared CuS microflowers could be used as templates to further build ternary CuSe@CuS and Cu1.8Se@CuS composites by Se exchange. The morphologies of both CuSe@CuS and Cu1.8Se@CuS almost inherit the features of the hierarchical CuS microspheres.

A facile one-step electrochemical deposition method for the growth of hierarchical CuS nanostructures on conductive glass substrates was achieved by Xu and coworkers (see Fig. 12b),112 in which Cu(NO3)2·3H2O acting as a copper precursor and NaNO3 acting as the supporting electrolyte were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide solution, with sulfur powder serving as the sulfur source. The electrodeposition process was performed with a potential of −1.05 V under continuous stirring by using a two-electrode system with a Pt plate as a counter electrode and FTO/glass substrate as a working electrode. The throughout deposition process was carried out at 80 °C. After deposition, the CuS thin film was anchored onto the FTO/glass substrate. The proposed growth mechanism could be attributed to a crystallization–dissolution process.112
Concave CuS superstructures, such as concave truncated cuboctahedrons and icosahedrons (as shown in Fig. 12c), were synthesized by solvothermal heating of a mixed solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O/sulfur powder/ethanol without adding any surfactant or organic agent.113 The ethanol solution acted not only as a general solvent, but also played a key role as a reducing agent. The ethanol lost two electrons to form acetaldehyde, which was accompanied by the transfer of electrons to S to form H2S. Then, CuS was formed by the reaction between Cu2+ and S2− ions. Similarly, the famous concave CuS cuboctahedron with a highly geometrical symmetry (as shown in Fig. 12d) was synthesized by solvothermal heating of a mixed solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O/sulfur powder/ethylene glycol.114 Each “caved” cuboctahedron was clearly “caved” with highly symmetric 14 cavities and was constructed by four identical hexagonal flakes, while sharing the 24 edges in a dymaxion way. Based on the above Cu(NO3)2·3H2O/sulfur powder/ethylene glycol reaction system, Cao and coworkers synthesized super-complex CuS porous architectures by adjusting the reaction temperature and the concentration of reaction agents, as shown in Fig. 12e.115 In addition, flower-like Cu2S structures with strong photoluminescence emission in the near-infrared region were synthesized by heating a mixed solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O/sulfur powder/oleic acid at 210 °C.116 Flower-like Cu1.8S structures were also prepared by heating a mixed solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O/sulfur powder/triethylene glycol (TEG) at 250 °C.117 Notably, ionic liquids might be good prospects for the preparation of hierarchical copper sulfide architectures.118,119
Dendritic structures are an attractive type of superstructures. Therefore, the development of a mild and facile controlled synthetic route for preparing such novel architectures would be of great interest. Chin and coworkers reported a facile method for the preparation of Cu2−xS dendrites in a high yield under mild conditions (see Fig. 12f).120 Various Cu2−xS dendritic structures from winter snowflakes to spring blossom structures were rapidly synthesized by adjusting the reaction parameters (including the reaction temperature, relative concentration between the reactants, and diamine chain length). In this synthesis, all the procedures for the preparation of Cu2−xS dendrites were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. First, degassed ethylenediamine (EDA) was added under stirring to a degassed solution of copper(I) thiobenzoate (CuTB) precursor. Then, the flask was immersed into a hot oil bath (100–120 °C) for 10 min, and a black precipitate was finally formed.120 Moreover, Xie and coworkers synthesized novel double-fold snowflake Cu2S dendrites by solvothermal heating of a mixed solution of CuSO4·5H2O and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in which DMSO performed multiple roles as a solvent, a sulfur source, and a reducing agent.121
Hollow architectures. 
The synthetic strategies for the synthesis of hollow Cu2−xS architectures are similar to the above-reported hierarchical architectures, and are mainly divided into three categories: (i) hard-template, (ii) soft-template, and (iii) template-free approaches. The involved growth mechanisms for the synthesis of hollow architectures generally include inside-out Ostwald ripening, oriented attachment, the Kirkendall effect, oxidization etching, and combined strategies.173,221–224
Hard-template strategy for synthesizing hollow architectures. 
The hard-template approach is the most effective strategy toward achieving a shape-controlled synthesis of hollow architectures, which can allow maximum inheritance of the configurations of the templates. Therefore, considerable efforts have been employed to develop novel hard-template strategies for synthesizing hollow nanostructures with well-controlled sizes, shapes, compositions, and arrangements of building blocks.122 So far, a number of hard templates have been used for synthesizing inorganic hollow architectures.122 In particular, morphological Cu2O templates have been widely synthesized and easily copied to form well-defined Cu2O@Cu2−xS core–shell architectures in a liquid-phase system containing Na2S, because of the very small solubility product constant Ksp of copper sulfide (Ksp = 10−48). Furthermore, the remaining Cu2O cores can be further dissolved by ammonia or acid, finally resulting in the formation of hollow Cu2−xS.122 Herein, we thoroughly overview the application of Cu2O templates in the controllable synthesis of hollow Cu2−xS architectures. Then, the advancements in other hard-template strategies for synthesizing hollow Cu2−xS architectures are also discussed.
When Cu2O meets Na2S in solution, it has been experimentally found that a thin Cu2−xS layer is formed immediately on the surface of Cu2O template, as evidenced by a fast color change from yellow or red to black. The formation of the Cu2O@Cu2−xS core–shell structures can be attributed to the Kirkendall effect, in which the diffusion rate of copper ions from the inside to outside is faster than that of the sulfur ions from outside to inside, leading to the formation of a void between the shell and core. Finally, hollow Cu2−xS cages can be synthesized after removing Cu2O cores by ammonia or acid. A typical sulfur replacement/etching reaction mechanism for synthesizing hollow Cu2−xS cages is schematically shown in Fig. 13.123

Based on the previous references,123–143 it can be found that the solvent-dependent synthesis of hollow Cu2−xS cages with different stoichiometries and microstructures has widely been reported involving sulfidizing Cu2O. Additionally, the facet/or crystalline feature of the Cu2O template will affect the microstructure of the final hollow Cu2−xS cage. For instance, unique polyhedral 26-facet CuS microcages decorated with different structural shells were fabricated by a facile sacrificial Cu2O template route in a mixed Na2S–NaOH–H2O system at room temperature and under ambient pressure (see Fig. 14a).124 Each polyhedral 26-facet CuS microcage had three pairs of square mesostructural shells, four pairs of nanotwinned triangular shells, and six pairs of rectangular single-crystalline shells, which could be attributed to the different atomic structures of the {110}, {111}, and {100} facets of Cu2O.225 However, alternative polyhedral 26-facet Cu7S4 cages wholly exposed with amazing nanotwins as building blocks were successfully synthesized through an ethanol-assisted sacrificial Cu2O template approach (see Fig. 14b).125 The square {100} facets, triangular {111} facets, and rectangular {110} facets of theses original 26-facet Cu2O templates were all transformed into rough Cu7S4 shells with well-assembled nanoplate building blocks. A typical microstructure and composition transformation of copper sulfide synthesized in different solvents is shown in Fig. 14c. Notably, nanotwinned 26-facet Cu7S4 microcages enclosed by polycrystalline shells were achieved by a glycol-assisted Cu2O-template growth/etching route.126 Similarly, the morphology-controlled synthesis of hollow Cu7S4 cages, including multi-pods (see Fig. 14d),127 cubes (see the left of Fig. 14e),128 double-shell cubes (see the inset of the left of Fig. 14e),129 octahedra (see the middle of Fig. 14e),128 and spheres (see the right of Fig. 14e),123 was achieved by adjusting the morphologies of Cu2O templates. Finally, it should be highlighted that the Cu7S4 can be facilely synthesized in an ethanol system,127–130 while CuS is easily formed in a pure water system.131–139

Based on the Cu2O/PVP hybrid templates, multi-shelled hollow Cu2S nanospheres were successfully prepared by employing an ion-exchange method. During this process, PVP slowed down the movement of sulfur ions (S2−) to the Cu2O surface. Namely, incoming S2− ions had to overcome this physical barrier to interact with Cu2O and form Cu2S surface clusters (see step 2). With a continuous supply of S2− ions for the exchange reaction, a steady growth of the Cu2S shell was anticipated. A continuous mass relocation of Cu2O crystallites from the inside was expected during the formation of Cu2S, because the mobility of oxygen anions was faster than that of the sulfur ions. Hence, there were two processes responsible for the formation of voids between the forming Cu2S shells and depleting Cu2O cores (step 3): the out-diffusion of Cu2O and the conversion of Cu2O to a denser crystalline Cu2S shell. Repeating this reaction, steps (4) and (5), (6) and (7), and (8) and (9) can produce the second, third, and fourth shells of Cu2S. A typical formation process and TEM images of the above-mentioned multi-shelled Cu2S hollow spheres are shown in Fig. 15.140

An alternative strategy for the stoichiometry-controlled fabrication of hollow Cu2−xS cages with Cu2O as a sacrificial template should be highlighted. For example, Guo and coworkers demonstrated that the direct introduction of S2−/glycol solution into the Cu2O-containing mother solution can help obtain Cu7S4 cages, while CuS formed with Cu2O experiences a separation and drying process as a sacrificial template (see Fig. 16a).141 Huang and coworkers reported that a rapid Cu2O-sulfidation process followed by acid (HCl) etching of the Cu2O cores for about 5 s can result in the synthesis of hollow Cu2S cages.142 In addition, the atmosphere for the sulfidation reaction is important for achieving the stoichiometry-controlled synthesis of hollow Cu2−xS cages. For instance, the composition of copper sulfide can be tuned from Cu2S to Cu1.75S by controlling the reaction atmosphere from nitrogen to an air atmosphere in a Na2S–NaOH–Cu2O–H2O system, respectively (see Fig. 16b).143

Besides the above well-known Cu2O templates for synthesizing hollow Cu2−xS cages, other templates, such as Cu(II) coordination polymer, Cu2(OH)2CO3, and CuCl, have also been developed. Hollow CuS nanospheres were prepared by hydrothermal heating of a mixture of trinuclear building block [Cu3(HSser)3(H2O)2]3·2H2O and thiourea, as shown in Fig. 17a.144 The surfaces of the hollow CuS microspheres displayed a circular, rod-like, concavo-convex, and flat morphologies by using different amounts of thioacetamide as a precipitants and Cu2(OH)2CO3 as a sacrificial template. A typical hollow CuS cage is shown in Fig. 17b.145 Furthermore, hollow CuS microspheres (see Fig. 17c) have been prepared through the reaction between CuCl and sulfur in a glycol solvent at higher temperature.146 In addition, styrene–acrylic acid copolymer (PSA) latex particles have also been used for the design and synthesis of hollow CuS spheres.147

Briefly, the rapid emergence of novel nanostructures with multifunctional properties provides new opportunities to expand our understanding as well as to promote the application of hard templates for synthesizing hollow Cu2−xS architectures.
Soft-template strategy for synthesizing hollow architectures. 
Surfactants have been widely used for preparing hollow Cu2−xS architectures based on a soft-template strategy. For example, 3D donut-like CuS particles (see Fig. 18a) were successfully synthesized by a facile microwave hydrothermal method employing PVP as the surfactant.148 In this case, a mixture of Cu(NO3)2/PVP/thiourea solution was first sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave, and then this autoclave was put into an MDS-8 microwave hydrothermal system. The reaction was carried out at 150 °C for 20 min. It was noted that the S/Cu molar ratios affected the phase composition and morphology of the products.

CTAB as a soft template has been employed in the synthesis of flower-like CuS hollow microspheres based on nanoflakes self-assembly (see Fig. 18b).149 Typically, a mixture of CuSO4/sulfur/CTAB/ethylene glycol solution was hydrothermally heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 160 °C for 15 h, where the reaction temperature and the concentration of the reactants played a key role in the formation of flower-like CuS hollow microspheres. The formation mechanism of the flower-like CuS hollow microspheres was attributed to the Ostwald ripening.
Additionally, water–oil (W/O) micelles acting as soft templates were effectively applied in the fabrication of hollow CuS nanospheres. For example, Triton X-100 and cyclohexane were dissolved in CuSO4 aqueous solution in a flask to form a microemulsion solution. Then CS2, Na2S, and CuSO4, chosen as the sources of sulfur and copper, were dropped into the above microemulsion solution at 60 °C. Finally, hollow CuS (as shown in Fig. 18c) was formed in this reaction system.150 The formation process of these hollow CuS spherical nanostructures was proposed as proceeding along the following stages: (1) the formation of W/O micelles with nanometer-sized drops of liquid Cu2+ ions, (2) the release of S2− ions from CS2, which were insoluble in water, and also reacted with the Cu2+ ions near the surfaces of the micelles to form CuS nuclei surrounding the spherical aggregates, and (3) the gradual outward diffusion of the Cu2+ ions from the inner part of the micelles, which then react with the S2− ions released from the CS2, finally leading to formation of the hollow CuS spheres. Similarly, a bubble-template strategy was also developed to controllably synthesize hollow Cu2−xS architectures.151,152
Template-free strategy for synthesizing hollow architectures. 
A thioglycolic acid (TGA)-assisted hydrothermal method was developed to synthesize submicron-sized CuS hollow spheres by a reaction between CuSO4 and thioacetamide (see Fig. 19a).153 During the hydrothermal process, TGA played important roles in the formation and self-assembly of the CuS nanocrystals to hollow spheres. A facile solvothermal method was also used to prepare flower-like CuS hollow spheres (see Fig. 19b).154 Typically, a mixture of Cu(CH3COO)2/thiourea/glacial acetic acid/methanol was hydrothermally heated in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 100 °C for 8 h. The formation of these flower-like CuS hollow spheres could be attributed to the mass diffusion and Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, hollow CuS assembled by nanoplatelets (see Fig. 19c) were fabricated through a one-pot sonochemical process by using copper acetate and thiourea aqueous solution as precursors without the need for any surfactant or template.155 Large-scaled hollow architectures with outer diameters in the range of 1.0–1.2 μm were assembled by pure hexagonal CuS nanoplatelets, being about 20 nm in thickness with stacking faults in the crystal lattice. It was noted that the CO2 gas bubbles formed from the sonication were introduced as a “template” to help the oriented aggregation and ripening.

Superlattices. 
The self-assembly of Cu2−xS building blocks into superlattices with well-defined morphologies and dimensions is of special interest. Compared with traditional polycrystalline or single-crystalline nanostructures, superlattices offer higher chemical activities because of the improved charge transferring ability derived from the oriented attachment of primary crystallites with less grain boundaries. So far, the investigation of Cu2−xS superlattices has been widely carried out. Herein, we thoroughly highlight the dimension-controllable synthesis of Cu2−xS superlattices, including 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures with different building blocks.
1D Superlattices. 
The oriented attachment mechanism has been demonstrated to govern the formation of a superlattice. Thermolysis of a copper–sulfur precursor in an organic solvent with the aid of a capping agent is crucial to determine the oriented aggregation process. The copper–sulfur bond synthesized in different conditions plays a key role for achieving the oriented attachment.156,157 For example, Chen and coworkers reported that CuS nanoplates could be self-assembled into superlattices with 1D columnar packing (see the left-hand side of Fig. 20a) by using 1-octadecene as a solvent, oleylamine as a capping ligand, and 1,2-hexadecanediol as a reductant for converting S to S2− ions. The self-assembly behavior could be further adjusted by altering the reaction temperature.158 Disk-like Cu2S nanocrystals were synthesized by a solventless thermolysis of copper alkylthiolate molecular precursors. The as-synthesized nanodisks ranged from circular to hexagonal prisms 3 to 150 nm in diameter and 3 to 12 nm in thickness. Moreover, the monodisperse Cu2S nanodisks could assemble into 1D ribbons of stacked platelets (see the middle of Fig. 20a).159 Additionally, 1D Cu7S4 nanosuperlattices were obtained by thermolysis of a N,N-dibutyldithiocarbamic copper precursor in a complex organic system containing oleylamine, 1-octadecene, dodecanethiol, and thioacetamide (see the right-hand side of Fig. 20a).160

The molar ratio of copper and sulfur is also important in determining the aggregation manners of the 1D Cu2−xS superlattices. For instance, Yang and coworkers demonstrated that hexagonal CuS nanodisks, hexagonal CuS nanoribbons consisting of face-to-face stacked nanodisks, and monoclinic Cu1.75S nanoribbons consisting of face-to-face stacked nanodisks could be obtained by the chemical reaction of CuCl2 and S in oleylamine at 100–180 °C, in which the molar ratios of [CuCl2]:[S] were 1:1, 2:3, and 2:1, respectively.161 Additionally, tin(IV)–X complex acting as an inorganic surface ligand can be effectively used for synthesizing a Cu2S superlattices assembly of anisotropic hexagonal nanoplate building blocks.162,163
2D Superlattices. 
Reports on 2D Cu2−xS superlattices are far fewer in the literature, so far. Li and coworkers though developed a water–oil interface confinement method to synthesize monodisperse Cu2S nanocrystals, and they subsequently achieved multilayer 2D superlattice assemblies in an autoclave at 200 °C (see Fig. 20b).164 In this two-phase synthesis, dodecanethiol (or its toluene solution) was the upper oil phase, which played the roles of sulfur source, ligand, and reducer, while the lower aqueous phase contained the copper ions and other added anions (CH3COO− or Cl−, used as ligands for adjusting the growth of Cu2S). The Cu2S nanocrystals generated at the interface of water and dodecanethiol were capped by dodecanethiol molecules, which could help the nanocrystal building blocks to self-assemble into highly ordered superlattices. Also, they displayed the possibility to adjust the packing symmetry of the superlattice and further to tailor the structures and performances of the assemblies by adjusting the sizes and shapes of the building blocks.164
3D Superlattices. 
3D superlattices can be effectively prepared in proper solvent conditions.165,166 For instance, toluene–water was employed as a two-phase system for synthesizing Cu2S nanocrystals under microwave irradiation, in which the alkyl-thiol acting as both a ligand and sulfur precursor could be dissolved in organic solvent, and water could facilitate the dissolution of the copper source. The concentration of dodecanethiol determined the size of the Cu2S nanoparticles, and was in favor of the formation of a well-ordered superlattice, as shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 20c.167 Moreover, the transformation of polyhedral CdS mesostructures to CuS was achieved by adding various amounts of Cu2+ ions into a finely dispersed mesostructured CdS powder in ethanol solution (see the middle of Fig. 20c),168 which was similar to that occurring in the previous reference.91 The self-assembly of hexagonal CuS nanoplatelets (see the right-hand side of Fig. 20c) could be achieved through a solvothermal process in toluene at 120 °C for 24 h with hexadecylamine as a capping agent, and copper acetate as well as carbon disulfide as precursors.169
Based on the above discussion, it should be noted that surfactants are crucial for the construction of Cu2−xS supplerlattices. A typical thermolysis of a nontoxic mixed solution of copper acetylacetonate, dodecanethiol, and oleylamine at high temperatures is highly effective to achieve the composition-, size-, and shape-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS nanocrystals and superlattices.18,84,170 In particular, the introduction of dodecanethiol can provide not only the precursor-containing sulfur source, but also the capping ligand bound to a higher coordination site for tailoring the growth manners. Tang and coworkers performed a series of excellent work in this field.18,84,170 Similarly, the use of thiol ligands as sulfur source for Cu2−xS nanocrystal synthesis and self-assembly has attracted attention.171 When thiol acts only as a ligand, the capping thiols are “surface-bound” and bonded to surface cations in low coordination number sites. In contrast, when thiols are used as a sulfur source, “crystal-bound” thiols result that are located in high coordination sites and with the terminal S layer on the crystal surfaces. Therefore, the self-assembly behavior can be controlled by adjusting the surface ligands. Although various Cu2−xS superlattices have been successfully prepared based on the above-mentioned capping-induced self-assembly strategies, the stability and potential application of Cu2−xS superlattices still need to be investigated.


3.2.5 Phase control. 
The development of phase-dependent Cu2−xS is very significant for optimizing its plasmonic and electrical properties. So far, the main synthetic challenge for the copper sulfides in the solution system is to understand the factors contributing to the final stoichiometric products. The factors responsible for the synthesis of nonstoichiometric compositions of Cu2−xS are not only dependent on the species of copper–sulfur precursors, but are also determined by the reaction parameters, such as the concentration, solvent, surfactant, and reaction temperature.207,226 Herein, we briefly overview the phase-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS based on different synthetic strategies.
A single-source precursor containing copper and sulfur is the first choice for the phase-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS. For instance, the synthesis of Cu1.8S and CuS was achieved by decomposing Cu-Tu (Tu = thiourea) precursors in ethylene glycol in the presence of air and argon, with Cl−, NO3−, and SO42− as the counteranions, as shown in Fig. 21a.227 It has been found that three different type of products, including CuS, Cu1.8S, and a mixture of CuS and Cu1.8S, can be obtained by the transformation of [Cu4(tu)9](NO3)4·4H2O, [Cu(tu)3]Cl, and [Cu2(tu)6]SO4·H2O, respectively.227 Moreover, the foreign Sn4+ ion can direct the growth of djurleite Cu31S16 from nanodisk to tetradecahedron along the [100] direction, while the djurleite Cu31S16 nanoparticles can be pseudomorphically converted into more copper-deficient (higher carrier density) roxbyite Cu7S4 through heat treatment in the presence of oleylamine. The roxbyite Cu7S4 retaining the morphology of the djurleite Cu31S16 presented a shorter and stronger LSPR peak. A schematic shape-evolution process is shown in Fig. 21b.228 Similarly, Xi and coworkers achieved the phase-transformation from CuS to Cu2S nanoplates through a reduction process by maintaining the original morphology. First, monodisperse CuS was formed after the injection of 1-octadecene-S into CuCl in hexadecylamine, which were used as (001) face-selective agents and capping ligands. Then, Cu2S was synthesized by using CuS as the starting material with oleylamine as the reducing agent.229 Jiang and coworkers prepared Cu7S4 from Cu9S8 (synthesized from the reaction between [Cu(NH3)4]2− and thiourea in a sealed autoclave at 60 °C for 3 h) by using the reducing agent KBH4, and oxidized Cu9S8 to CuS with the help of SnCl4 in ammonia solvent (see Fig. 21c).230 Other precursors are also suitable for the phase-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS (see Fig. 21d and e).202,231

The starting copper to sulfur ratio is also significant for achieving the phase-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS.232 Manna and coworkers found that platelet-shaped Cu2−xS nanocrystals with a tunable Cu stoichiometry can be obtained from Cu-rich covellite (Cu1.1S) nanoplates through the reaction with a Cu(I) complex ([Cu(CH3CN)4]PF6) at room temperature.233 The composition can evolve, starting from Cu1.1S up to Cu2S (see Fig. 22a), by increasing the copper amount in the Cu(I) complex. Interestingly, the strong LSPR response of the initial covellite Cu1.1S is red-shifted and decreases in intensity, until it disappears for the Cu2S composition. Chen and coworker developed a facile solvothermal approach by using a mixture of water/ethanol/polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 400, abbreviated as PEG-400) as the solvent for the preparation of hydrophilic copper sulfide.234 They achieved the combined control of the shape (from octahedral-like particles, to nanoplates, to nanoparticles), phase (from digenite Cu9S5 to covellite CuS, see Fig. 22b), and optical absorption (from no NIR absorption to strong NIR absorption) by changing the Cu/S precursor ratio from 1/5,1/3,1/2, to 1/1. In particular, when the Cu/S ratio was 1/1, the as-synthesized products exhibited the smallest size (∼40 nm), excellent hydrophilicity, and the highest photoabsorption in the near-infrared region. Similarly, simultaneous control of the phase, morphology, and size was also reported by Yang and coworkers by adjusting the Cu/S ratio (see Fig. 22c).161 Furthermore, hollow Cu2−xS nanospheres with three compositions have been synthesized by a microemulsion approach. The phase-engineered composition, including covellite (CuS), digenite (Cu1.8S), and chalcocite (Cu2S), was achieved by adjusting the precursor species and being synthesized under different conditions (see Fig. 22d).235 Three types of Cu2−xS, namely CuS, Cu7S4, and Cu9S5, were successfully synthesized using different volumes of ethylenediamine in a liquid-phase synthesis process (see Fig. 22e).236 Additionally, a facile hot-injection and phosphine-free colloidal method was developed to synthesize high-quality Cu2−xS nanodisks with different crystal phases from hexagonal CuS to monoclinic Cu7S4 and Cu31S16 by manipulating the Cu/S ratios (see Fig. 22f).237 The phase-transformation was important in tuning the plasmonic resonance, and the LSPR wavelength could be tuned from 1133 to 1512 nm with the phase changing from CuS to Cu7S4 and Cu31S16.237

Based on the above results, it can be seen that the phase-evolution of Cu2−xS will open up a new platform to optimize the LSPR and phototherapy performance, which is of great industrial importance.

4. Modifications
To better understand the relationship between the modified interfacial/electronic structures and the enhanced performances is significant for developing novel Cu2−xS-based micro-/nanostructures. Generally, the modification of Cu2−xS can be classified into two strategies: (i) doping and (ii) hybridizing. Doping heteroatoms in Cu2−xS materials to modify their electronic structures is an effective strategy to improve the optical/or photoelectric properties; while hybridizing is an alternative approach for obtaining unexpected physicochemical properties, which is attributed to the synergistic effect between the active component and support. Therefore, Cu2−xS serving as the host component would provide a good opportunity to manipulate the interfacial properties of hybrid Cu2−xS-based architectures for expanding their technological applications. Currently, hybrid Cu2−xS-based composites with well-controlled compositions, morphologies, and sizes have been rationally designed and synthesized along with the rapid advancement in nanotechnology. However, a systematic review of Cu2−xS-based materials has not been reported so far.
In this section, we first summarize the significant advances made in the doped Cu2−xS with reference to some typical examples. Next, the progress made in different kinds of hybrid Cu2−xS-based heterogeneous architectures, including hybrid Cu2−xS–semiconductors, hybrid Cu2−xS–metal nanostructures, and hybrid Cu2−xS–carbon nanostructures, will be introduced in detail.
4.1 Doping
Although doping heteroatoms is a well-demonstrated method to improve the physicochemical properties through tailoring the electronic structure of a material, references to doped Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures are less reported in the literature. Hence, in-depth investigation in this field is still lacking.
Yang and coworkers reported a coprecipitation method to synthesize iodine-131-doped CuS nanoparticles (see Fig. 23a) by using a mixed solution of CuCl2/sodium citrate/sodium sulfide/potassium iodide at room temperature.238 The doping of iodine element in CuS after functionalization with polyethylene glycol was used for combining radiotherapy and photothermal therapy, achieving remarkable synergistic therapeutic effects as demonstrated in the treatment of subcutaneous tumors.238 This finding may offer a new facile pathway for preparing halide-doped Cu2−xS.

Zn-doped CuS can achieve the transformation of CuS's semiconductor character from p-type to n-type to significantly improve its photoelectric response performance.239 In this case, the chemically homogeneous Zn-doped CuS nanoflowers (including Zn0.06Cu0.94S, Zn0.26Cu0.73S1.01, Zn0.36Cu0.62S1.02, Zn0.49Cu0.50S1.01, and Zn0.58Cu0.40S1.02) were prepared by reacting appropriate amounts of CuCl and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O with sulfur powders in an ethanol solvothermal process. When the Zn/Cu atomic ratio was 1:1, the Zn0.49Cu0.50S1.01 superlattices (see Fig. 23b) were successfully synthesized, which could generate an effective built-in electric field with an n-type semiconductor to significantly optimize the photoelectric response performance. This study suggested that the Zn2+ doping in CuS was a key factor in determining the semiconductor type and the dynamic manners of the charge carriers.
Banin and coworkers demonstrated that a moderate temperature treatment of Cu2S can lead to a significant conductance enhancement in a controlled manner,240 which was attributed to the formation of Cu vacancies, resulting in the generation of free holes. It was noted that additional impurities could not be introduced into the Cu2S by this thermal doping strategy. Moreover, the patterned doping of Cu2S nanocrystal films could be achieved through local heating by a focused laser beam (see Fig. 23c),240 which represents a move toward the fabrication of nanocrystal-based electronic devices.
Hollow micro-/nanostructures could easily shorten the diffusion length of charge carriers, optimize the access channel for the adsorption of reactants, and provide more surface active sites for chemical reactions.172 Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the doping of hollow Cu2−xS for further improving its targeted applications. Thus, it can be expected that the combination of a hollow framework and heteroatom doping in Cu2−xS would be an effective strategy for enhancing its semiconductor characteristics, such as electronic conductivity, visible-light absorption, and appropriate overpotential for chemical reactions. Additionally, theoretical calculations should be considered for investigating the electronic structures of doped Cu2−xS.
4.2 Hybridizing
The controllable synthesis of heterogeneous semiconductor-based composites is an exciting direction to pursue highly active performance, and also provides an opportunity to investigate the structure–property–performance relationship. So far, considerable efforts have been employed to construct hybrid Cu2−xS-based micro-/nanostructures with various heterogeneous interfaces for expanding new applications.242–295 Generally, there are two types of hybrid Cu2−xS-based composites: (i) connected structures (such as decorated structures and heterojunctions), and (ii) encapsulated structures (such as core/shell and yolk/shell).241 Therefore, the ability to controllably combine other nanoparticles with Cu2−xS is of special interest because it can allow us to understand the interaction between the different components to prepare desired hybrid Cu2−xS-based composites.
In this section, we summarize the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of the above-mentioned hybrid Cu2−xS-based composites. First, the metal–Cu2−xS composites will be highlighted. In particular, the controllable synthesis of metal-decorated Cu2−xS heterostructures and metal@Cu2−xS core/shell architectures are summarized in detail. Next, various semiconductor–Cu2−xS composites are overviewed. Then, we illustrate the significance of hybrid carbon–Cu2−xS heterostructures. Finally, we briefly introduce the recent advances made in multicomponent Cu2−xS-based composites. Remarks on promising research directions of different hybrid Cu2−xS-based micro-/nanostructures are also proposed.

4.2.1 Hybrid metal–Cu2−xS. 
Combining metal nanoparticle and Cu2−xS semiconductor would offer a new functionality benefiting from the synergetic properties of the disparate components. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to synthesizing high-activity hybrid metal–Cu2−xS nanostructures with controllable interfaces.142,242–247 Multifunctional metal–Cu2−xS heterogeneous nanostructures, such as Au–Cu2S,242 Pt–CuS,243 Ru–Cu2S heterodimers,244 and Au@Cu7S4,245 Au@Cu2S,142,246 and Au@Cu2−xS core/shell nanostructures,247 have been synthesized by an ion-exchange strategy between metal alloys or metal@Cu2O core–shell architectures and a sulfur source. Consequently, fine tailoring of the hybrid metal–Cu2−xS heterogeneous nanostructures and gaining a thorough understanding of the formation mechanisms are imperative.
In this subsection, we summarize the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of different kinds of hybrid metal–Cu2−xS nanostructures. First, recent advances in the synthesis of metal–Cu2−xS heterodimers are especially elaborated. Then, we introduce the synthetic strategies and principles of metal@Cu2−xS core/shell heterogeneous nanostructures.
Metal–Cu2−xS heterodimers. 
An effective route to synthesize hybrid metal–Cu2−xS heterodimers is to begin with a Cu-based alloy nanoparticle, and to subsequently induce the sulfuration of the copper phase to obtain a two-component product. This strategy allows one to preprogram the composition of the desired metal components in the Cu-based alloy feed, and then to chemically trigger its sulfuration into two distinct adjoined particles, which would also shift the driving force for the formation of the hybrid metal–Cu2−xS heterodimer from heterogeneous nucleation to phase segregation. However, colloidal hybrid metal–Cu2−xS heterodimers have not yet been prepared by using a solution-mediated chemically triggered phase segregation reaction. However, Schaak's group solved this problem, and showed that uniform colloidal AuCu alloy nanoparticles can react with dissolved sulfur and bubbling oxygen can achieve the formation of uniform colloidal hybrid Au–Cu2S nanoparticles (see Fig. 24a), which is of interest as a nontoxic and earth-abundant light absorber for application in solar energy conversion.242 Similarly, Jiang and coworkers also synthesized Au–Cu2S,248 and Au–CuS composites.249 Inspired by the above strategy, Pt–CuS heterodimers can be synthesized by the sulfidation of CuPt alloy nanoparticles.243 Here, the CuPt alloy nanoparticles were prepared by heating Cu/H2PtCl6 or Cu(acac)2/Pt in an organic solvent, which were then converted into Pt–CuS heterodimers by reacting with elemental sulfur in octadecene at elevated temperature (see Fig. 24b). These Pt–CuS heterodimers displayed highly selective activity for catalyzing the methanol oxidation reaction at room temperature due to the strong electronic coupling effect between the different domains in the heterodimers. Additionally, the growth of hybrid Ru–Cu2S nanoparticles from cages to nanonets was achieved by a selective edge growth of Ru on copper(I) sulfide seeds.244 Initially, the Cu2S seeds were synthesized by the decomposition of Cu(acac)2 in excess dodecanethiol at 200 °C. Then, the hybrid Ru–Cu2S nanoparticles were prepared by heating a solution of the Cu2S seeds in octadecylamine and injecting a solution of Ru(acac)3 in octylether at higher temperature. The morphology of the product was very sensitive to the reaction temperature, and in total four different nanostructures were discovered upon varying the reaction temperature from 190 °C to 220 °C (see Fig. 24c). The products changed from homogeneous nuclei of Ru along with the free Cu2S seeds at lower temperature, to Ru nano-inorganic caged copper(I) sulfide, to a long thin Ru structure protruding from the seed surface at the higher temperature range.

Encapsulated metal–Cu2−xS. 
As highlighted above, Cu2O is an effective hard template for synthesizing hollow Cu2−xS, so it was proposed that hybrid metal@Cu2O core/shell templates can also be employed to fabricate the metal@Cu2−xS core/shell architectures. For example, the preparation of Au@Cu7S4 yolk–shell nanoparticles was achieved by sulfidizing Au@Cu2O core–shell nanoparticles based on an inward replacement strategy (see Fig. 25a), which typically involved two stages.245 First, polycrystalline Cu2O layers were formed and coated outside the Au cores to obtain Au@Cu2O core–shell structures by using Au nanoparticles as seeds and PVP as a structural-directing agent in a Cu(NO3)2/N2H4·H2O system. Second, the Cu2O shells were converted into Cu7S4 shells immediately when suspended in the Na2S solution due to the Kirkendall effect. Finally, Au@Cu7S4 yolk–shell nanoparticles were formed. Similarly, Au@Cu2S yolk–shell nanoparticles were synthesized by a modified strategy, as shown in Fig. 25b.142 Apart from the sulfuration of metal@Cu2O for obtaining metal@Cu2−xS yolk–shell architectures, a seed-mediated solvothermal approach was also utilized to fabricate the encapsulated metal–Cu2−xS architecture.246 Typically, Au@Cu2S core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized by heating a mixed solution of Au/Cu(acac)2/oleylamine/sulfur at 200 °C for 2 h (see Fig. 25c). The efficient interfacial electron transferred from the excited Cu2S to the Au promotes the oxidative photodegradation of the dyes. In addition, a cation-exchange strategy was also developed to synthesize a Au@Cu2−xS core/shell architecture.247 Thermodynamically, the cation exchange between Cu+ and CdS nanocrystals is a spontaneous reaction (ΔG < 0) and can occur immediately. Accordingly, along with the addition of Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 methanol solution into Au@CdS toluene colloid, the cation-exchange reaction is carried out rapidly and Cd2+ is substituted by Cu+ almost completely in several minutes. The morphologies of the Au seeds are responsible for the final configurations of the Au@Cu2S core/shell nanoparticles (see Fig. 25d).

4.2.2 Hybrid semiconductor–Cu2−xS. 
During the past decade, many investigations of hybrid semiconductor–Cu2−xS nanostructures have been carried out because multiple functions can be incorporated into a single system due to the fascinating properties induced by the heterointerfaces. The interfacial structures and physicochemical properties of hybrid semiconductor–Cu2−xS nanostructures strongly depend on the rational arrangement of the multi-components within the heterostructures. Thus, the spatial controllable synthesis of hybrid semiconductor–Cu2−xS nanostructures is still a challenge.
In this subsection, we summarize the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of different kinds of hybrid semiconductor–Cu2−xS nanostructures. First, the progress made in decorated semiconductor–Cu2−xS will be reviewed. Then, we highlight the advances in semiconductor@Cu2−xS core/shell heterogeneous nanostructures.
Decorated semiconductor–Cu2−xS. 
Copper sulfides are considered as an ideal absorber material because they are nontoxic, cheap, and abundant, and have good absorption characteristics,250 which can be widely used in the fields of solar cells and photocatalysts. Therefore, copper sulfide is suitable for enhancing the light absorption of a wide bandgap semiconductor to fabricate a number of decorated semiconductor–Cu2−xS based devices. For example, CuS quantum dots (QDs) decorated on both the inside and outside of TiO2 nanotubes were successfully synthesized through a stepwise crystallization of CuS nanoparticles onto TiO2 nanotubes using L-cysteine linkers (see Fig. 26a).251 Herein, L-cysteine is an amino acid containing three reactive centers: a thiol group, an amine, and a carboxylic acid, which makes it favorable for binding CuS nanocrystals to the surface of TiO2. To prevent the formation of bulk CuS, TiO2 nanotubes were first treated with cysteine, which offered a binding site for copper ions. After introducing a Cu(II) acetate solution, the Cu(II) ions were expected to have a high affinity with the thiol group, and so they readily reacted with cysteine molecules, as evidenced by the deep blue-green color, indicating the formation of Cu(II) cysteine complexes. Finally, the CuS QDs were anchored onto TiO2 nanotubes after adding a Na2S solution. The photocatalytic behavior of the TiO2–CuS nanotubes suggested that CuS QDs could enhance the photocatalytic activity and improve the photosensitivity of the pristine TiO2 nanotubes under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, Cu2S QDs could be anchored on the flower-like BiOBr hierarchical architectures by a simple precipitation method involving a mixing solution of BiOBr/CTAB/ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)/Cu(CH3COO)2/Na2S (see Fig. 26b). It was found that Cu2S(3 wt%)–BiOBr composites containing 1 wt% Pt displayed the highest hydrogen evolution rate. The enhancement of hydrogen evolution was attributed to the synergistic effect between BiOBr and Cu2S QDs, where the good overlapping band-structures and the intimate contact interfaces were beneficial for the separation of the photoinduced carriers.252 Interestingly, a novel CuS-embedded PbS QDs (PbS@CuS QDs), as shown in Fig. 26c, was fabricated by Kim and coworkers.253 These PbS/CuS QDs were synthesized by the rapid injection of a sulfur precursor into a lead precursor solution, with a subsequent cationic exchange between Pb ions and Cu ions. In this heterogeneous structure, CuS QDs increased the absorption due to the surface plasmon effect, and the embedded structure helped charge collection and separation, leading to a potential application in solar cells.

Semiconductor@Cu2−xS core/shell architecture. 
A hybrid Cu2O-based template for the synthesis of the semiconductor@Cu2−xS core/shell architecture has been demonstrated. Yeh and coworkers developed a rattle-type Fe3O4@CuS with delocalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles inside hollow porous CuS structures by using Fe3O4@Cu2O as a sacrificial template, before replacing oxygen ions with sulfur ions through a modified Kirkendall process (see Fig. 27a).254 In this case, CTAB-coated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@CTAB) acted as the seed for growing Cu2O. The growth of Cu2O on Fe3O4 was achieved by reducing copper ions using hydrazine, followed by gathering small Cu2O into large Cu2O through physical adsorption by using PVP. Furthermore, the Fe3O4@CTAB had a positive charge on the surface owing to the positive charge of the trimethylammonium (N(CH3)3+) functional group on CTAB, whereas PVP had a negative charge because of the presence of a polarizable carbonyl (CO) group, resulting in the formation of Fe3O4@Cu2O owing to electrostatic interactions. Subsequently, (NH4)2S (ammonium sulfide) was used as a source of sulfur ions to transform core–shell Fe3O4@Cu2O into rattle-type Fe3O4@CuS. These Fe3O4@CuS nanoparticles exhibited a broad NIR absorption from 700 to 1300 nm.

Chemical modification of the semiconductor is beneficial to obtaining a semiconductor@Cu2−xS core/shell architecture. Ganguli and coworkers demonstrated that CuS nanostructures can be controllably synthesized on TiO2 nanorods by utilizing 3-mercaptopropionic acid as a surface-functionalizing agent in a Cu(NO3)2/Na2S system; ultimately leading to the formation of a TiO2@CuS core/shell architecture (see Fig. 27b).255 While CuS decorated on TiO2 composites can be formed in the absence of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The photocatalytic results suggested that the core/shell nanostructures have much better photocatalytic activities than those of the decorated composites, which was attributed to the geometry of the core/shell maximizing the interfacial contact between TiO2 and CuS, and limiting the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers by confining the electrons mainly in one component (core) and the holes in another component (shell). Similarly, silica spheres can be coated onto the CuS cuboctahedra by using a 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane acted as a linker (see Fig. 27c).256
A solid–solid phase-transformation can induce the formation of Cu1.81S@ZnS through a cation-exchange strategy.257 As shown in Fig. 27d, the schematic (top) and TEM images (bottom) display the composition change from the initial Cu1.81S nanoparticle (i, leftmost) into a ZnS (v, rightmost) with a copper sulfide thin disk. The Cu2+ ions are replaced by Zn2+ at the interfaces and are accommodated in intrinsic Cu vacancy sites presented in the initial roxbyite (Cu1.81S) phase, inducing a full phase transition to a more thermodynamically stable djurleite (Cu1.94S)/low chalcocite (Cu2S) phase. This solid–solid phase transition offers insights to help understand and tailor the nucleation of phase transformation on the nanoscale.
Metal sulfide/Cu2−xS heterogeneous nanostructures. 
Aside from the above Cu1.81S@ZnS core/shell nanostructure, a number of metal sulfide/Cu2−xS heterogeneous nanostructures with novel morphologies have been extensively explored. This is because n-type metal sulfide semiconductors can be epitaxially grown on p-type Cu2−xS with LSPR, which brings about unique physicochemical properties for applications in the fields of photocatalysis, in optoelectronic devices, and sensing. Moreover, a seed-mediated wet chemical strategy is widely used for the tunable synthesis of metal sulfide/Cu2−xS heterogeneous nanostructures. Herein, we highlight the synthetic strategies for these heterogeneous nanostructures.
Cu1.94S–ZnS p–n type heterogeneous nanorods with a Cu1.94S “head” and ZnS “tail” overlapping (see Fig. 28a) can be fabricated by injecting a Zn(acac)2-dodecanethiol stock solution into a hot reaction system containing Cu1.94S seeds, which catalyzes the pyrolysis of Zn(acac)2 and facilitates the following epitaxial growth of ZnS on the Cu1.94S seeds.211 Also, it was found that unexpected zipper-like self-assembled superlattices could be formed by the heterostructured Cu1.94S–ZnS nanorods in this approach. However, the Cu1.94S acted as a plasmonic source and displays a somewhat change in its size or shape during the formation of the second phase ZnS, which was unfavorable for the fine-control of the LSPR frequency.211 Wang and coworkers reported a two-step solution strategy for synthesizing Cu1.94S–ZnS heterogeneous nano-antennas (see Fig. 28b) that could serve as an ideal equivalent RLC (R = resistor, L = inductor, and C = capacitor) electric circuit model.258 Importantly, it was demonstrated that the LSPR frequency of the nano-antennas were designable and experimentally controllable in the range of 1390–1680 nm.258 Moreover, Tang and coworkers synthesized matchstick-like Cu1.94S–ZnS heterostructured nanocrystals by using a simple one-pot approach without any injection and presynthesis of metal precursors, in which the LSPR's peak of the Cu1.94S could be tuned from 1680 nm to 1375 nm by the heterogrowth of ZnS onto Cu1.94S owing to an increase in free carriers (holes).259 Similarly, they achieved the transformation of Cu(I)-doped zinc sulfide nanocrystals to Cu1.94S–ZnS heterostructured nanocrystals through a facile one-pot heating process without any injection by controlling the molar ratios of zinc acetylacetonate to copper acetylacetonate in a mixture of n-dodecanethiol and 1-octadece.260 Additionally, a thermolysis strategy was developed to synthesize sandwich-like Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S heterostructures by taking Cu1.94S nanoplates as precursors.262 In this synthesis, the trimeric heterostructure was formed by a three-stage process, which involved the Zn-oleate induced assembly of Cu1.94S nanoplate couples, the heteronucleation and growth of a ZnS layer between two Cu1.94S nanoplates dominated by interfacial diffusion, and the catalyst-assisted axial growth of ZnS nanorods following the solution–liquid–solid mechanism. With the epitaxial growth of ZnS nanocrystal between two Cu1.94S nanoplates, the LSPR frequency of Cu1.94S changed from 1875 to 1323 nm, suggesting that this trinary heterostructure was promisingly applicable as a light-absorbing agent in photothermal therapy. Based on the above hot-injection synthetic strategy for the synthesis of Cu1.94S–ZnS p–n type heterogeneous nanostructures, Cu2S–In2S3 heterostructures with controllable shapes and compositions, including matchstick-like Cu2S–In2S3 heterostructured nanorods, teardrop-like quasi-core/shell Cu2S@In2S3 nanocrystals, and pencil-like In2S3 nanorods, were prepared by using multistep injections of an In(acac)3-dodecanethiol solution into a hot Cu(acac)2-dodecanethiol reaction system without separation and purification of the initially formed copper sulfide nanoparticles, in which the Cu2S nanocrystals played the role of a catalyst. Typical matchstick-like Cu2S–In2S3 nanorods are shown in Fig. 28c.84

Recently, Yu and coworkers demonstrated a facile one-pot chemical transformation method to prepare dumbbell-like self-coupled Cu2−xS (Cu1.94S–CuS) polymorphs by using CuCl and Mn(S2CNEt2)2 as precursors in oleylamine. This dumbbell-like Cu1.94S–CuS heterogeneous-phase junction combined 1D Cu1.94S in the middle with 2D CuS nanoplates located on both sides, as shown in Fig. 28d.262 As the intermediate products of the phase-transformation and shape-evolution from monoclinic egg-like Cu1.94S nanocrystals to hexagonal CuS nanoplates, the as-synthesized self-coupled Cu2−xS polymorphs were stable and could be isolated. In this synthesis, Mn(S2CNEt2)2 has the most suitable binding energy between Mn2+ ions and ligands for cation exchange with Cu+ ions and its decomposition can be tuned to obtain Cu1.94S nanocrystals. Initially, Cu+ ions at both tips of the egg-like Cu1.94S nanocrystals prefer to reacting with sulfur species to form CuS nanoplates due to the tips having high reactivity facets. The as-formed CuS nanoplates stabilize the tips of the Cu1.94S, and more orientational and stable facets between Cu1.94S and CuS are maintained, thus Mn2+ ions retard the phase-transformation and shape-evolution process from Cu1.94S to self-coupled Cu2−xS polymorphs. It was seen also that Cu1.94S with a dumbbell handle slowly disappeared and the pure CuS nanoplates are finally formed. More significantly, the self-coupled Cu1.94S–CuS polymorphs, as an emerging photogenerated charge separation junction, display enhanced photoelectrochemical properties compared to those of the individual Cu1.94S nanocrystals and CuS nanoplates.262
In addition, unique hexagonal-prismatic Cu1.94S–ZnS, Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S, and Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S–ZnS–Cu1.94S heterogeneous nanostructures with screw-like, dumbbell-like, and sandwich-like morphologies can also be synthesized by controlling the molar ratio of CuI and [Zn(S2CNEt2)2] in oleylamine (see Fig. 28e), and these different Cu1.94S–ZnS-based nanostructures can present strong absorbance across the solar spectrum and a broad NIR absorption between 800 and 2000 nm.263


4.2.3 Hybrid carbon–Cu2−xS. 
Carbon nanomaterials (including reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon quantum dots (CQDs)) have been widely investigated as smart supports for energy conversion applications, owing to their outstanding thermal and chemical stabilities, high conductivities, and high specific surface areas. When carbon nanostructures are integrated with Cu2−xS, these carbon supports/or active ingredients act as good electron acceptors that can help improve the charge separation within Cu2−xS semiconductors. As a result, enhanced activities are achieved for hybrid carbon–Cu2−xS composites compared with the pristine Cu2−xS semiconductors. In this subsection, we briefly summarize the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of different kinds of hybrid carbon–Cu2−xS composites. First, the progress in the synthesis of decorated carbon–Cu2−xS is overviewed. Next, we briefly elaborate on the design and synthesis of carbon@Cu2−xS core/shell architectures.
Decorated carbon–Cu2−xS. 
The functional groups (such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups) of carbon nanostructures can act as anchoring sites for the attachment of copper precursors, thus Cu2−xS can subsequently be grown on carbon nanomaterials after introducing a sulfur source. A dipping-assembly of CQDs on the surfaces of Cu2S arrays was realized by Zhang and coworkers (see Fig. 29a).264 The CQDs-decorated Cu2S exhibited a remarkably improved photocurrent density, which was four times higher than that of the pristine Cu2S. This could be attributed to the enhanced electron transfer and the energy-downshift effect of the CQDs. The CuS nanowires could be highly dispersed and anchored onto or wrapped around the rGO nanosheets by reacting Cu(NO3)2, thiourea, and GO in a mixed solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide and ethylene glycol (see Fig. 29b).265 Use of a hydrothermal/solvothermal strategy was also effective for synthesizing rGO–Cu2−xS composites.266,267 CNTs–Cu2−xS is an important member of the decorated carbon–Cu2−xS family. For instance, ultrafine CuS nanoneedle arrays supported on CNT backbones (CNTs@CuS) were synthesized by a template-engaged chemical conversion route.268 In the first step, silica-coated CNTs (CNTs@SiO2) were introduced as the substrates for the growth of copper silicate (CuSilicate) nanoneedles to form CNTs@SiO2@CuSilicate core–shell structures. In the second step, the CuSilicate nanoneedles were completely evolved into CuS nanoneedles by a hydrothermal treatment with Na2S. Simultaneously, the intermediate silica layer was removed during a hydrothermal process, thus leading to the formation of hierarchical CNTs@CuS nanostructures (see Fig. 29c).268 Moreover, single-crystalline Cu2S nanocrystals could be grown in situ on acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by a solvothermal method (see Fig. 29d).269 The solar cells and the amperometric glucose sensors fabricated using these hybrid Cu2S–MWCNTs nanostructures responded more sensitively than those fabricated using the Cu2S or MWCNTs alone. Similarly, decorating CuS nanoparticles onto electrospun carbon nanofibers (see Fig. 29e) and mesoporous carbon nanospheres (see Fig. 29f) was achieved by a hydrothermal approach, respectively.270,271

Cu2−xS@carbon core/shell architecture. 
So far, the preparation of Cu2−xS@carbon core/shell architectures has been less reported in the literature. Xu and coworkers successfully fabricated CuS@carbon core/shell cables (see Fig. 30) by a simple hydrothermal method in the presence of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) acting as the ligand and the carbon source for the sheath.272 The hydroxyls on β-CD molecules strongly coordinate with Cu2+ ions, thus the Cu2+ ions are attracted by β-CD to form the Cu-β-CD complex. Moreover, the thiourea in the solution can be decomposed at a certain temperature to allow the sulfur species to react with the Cu-β-CD complex under a hydrothermal treatment, resulting in the generation of CuS(β-CD)n. When the reaction time was increased, fiber-like CuS was formed by the transformation of CuS(β-CD)n precursors, simultaneously with the β-CD decomposition to release carbon to cover the CuS fibers uniformly, ultimately leading to the formation of CuS@carbon cables.

4.2.4 Multicomponent Cu2−xS-based composites. 
Besides the above binary systems, multicomponent Cu2−xS-based composites with enhanced performances have also been reported.273–295 For example, the magnetically targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded Cu9S5@mSiO2@Fe3O4-PEG nanocomposites for combining magnetic resonance imaging with chemo-/photothermal synergistic therapy was demonstrated (see Fig. 31a).288 A low-toxicity multifunctional nanoplatform based on Cu9S5@mSiO2 core–shell nanocomposites (see Fig. 31b) was used to achieve a combination of photothermal and chemotherapies with infrared thermal imaging for cancer treatment.289 Fe3O4@mSiO2-FA-CuS-PEG nanocomposites (see Fig. 31c) were also applied in the magnetic resonance imaging and targeted chemo-/photothermal synergistic therapy of cancer cells.290 A difunctional nanoplatform of SiO2-FA-CuS-PEG/DOX nanocomposites for targeted chemo-/photothermal therapy has also been synthesized (see Fig. 31d).291 Moreover, multifunctional PEG-GO/CuS nanocomposites for near-infrared chemo-/photothermal therapy have been reported (see Fig. 31e).292 Additionally, investigations were also carried out into Y2O3:Yb/Er-CuxS,293 NaGdF4:Yb, Er@NaGdF4:Yb@NaNdF4@mSiO2-CuS (see Fig. 32a),294 and Y2O3:Yb,Er@mSiO2-CuxS double-shelled hollow spheres (see Fig. 32b)295 for enhanced chemo-/photothermal therapy.

4.2.5 The transfer of hydrophobic Cu2−xS-based materials. 
As shown in sections 3 and 4, it can be summarized that a number of Cu2−xS-based nanomaterials have been prepared in the presence of capping organic surfactants, which are often dispersed in an organic solvent. However, the biomedical application of Cu2−xS-based nanomaterials is generally carried out in an aqueous environment, thus the hydrophobic surface makes them unsuitable for photothermal imaging. Hence, the transfer of hydrophobic Cu2−xS-based nanomaterials nanocrystals into aqueous solution is important to be overviewed here. For example, Cu7S4 nanoparticles capped with oleylamine and dodecanethiol were prepared through Cu(S2CNBut2)2 precursors by a hot-injection method in the presence of a mixed solvent of oleylamine and 1-octadecene.296 Different morphologies, such as dispersed nanoparticles, rod-like alignments, and nanosuperlattices were obtained by tuning the dosage of dodecanethiol as well as thioacetamide, and by varying the solvothermal temperature. It could be seen that these hydrophobic Cu7S4 were well-dispersed and no alignments or aggregates were found. Significantly, these hydrophobic nanocrystals could be successfully transferred into water from chloroform and exhibited very good water-dispensability after coating with a thin layer of oleylamine-functionalized polysuccinimide. The photothermal conversion efficiency of the as-prepared Cu7S4 nanosuperlattices was enhanced up to 65.7% under irradiation of 808 nm near-infrared light. Moreover, the hydrophobic oleylamine-capped Cu2−xS could be transformed into hydrophilic ones through a lipid PEGylation by a biomimetic phospholipid (DSPE-PEG2000-NH2), which endowed them with a uniform and small nanoparticle size, good phosphate buffer saline (PBS) dispersity, high stability, and excellent biocompatibility.297 Additionally, Cu7S4 nanoparticles with excellent photothermal properties could be transformed into amphiphilic Cu7S4–CdSe@ZnS nanocomposites via the polymerization of allyl mercaptan coated on Cu7S4 to provide good affinities toward latent fingerprints imaging.298
Briefly, coupling Cu2−xS with different support nanostructures (such as metals, semiconductors, carbon, and organic molecules) can remarkably promote an improvement of the physicochemical properties to achieve the desired performances compared to the bare Cu2−xS components. The rapid emergence of various multicomponent Cu2−xS-based hybrid composites is expected to provide new opportunities to expand our understanding of the fundamental importance of Cu2−xS crystals as well as to improve their potential applications. However, the intrinsic factors related to the controllable synthesis of morphological Cu2−xS decorated on different substrates needs to be investigated thoroughly, and the relationship between the interfacial structure of the hybrid Cu2−xS-based composites and their performance is still unclear. In addition, other layered 2D nanomaterials similar to graphene (such as carbon nitride, boron nitride, and molybdenum disulfide) decorated with Cu2−xS should be further investigated.

5. Applications
The preparation of bare Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures with controllable morphologies, crystalline phases, and monodispersed sizes brings about unique physicochemical properties to expand their applications. Moreover, the introduction of Cu2−xS as an active component or support in nanocomposites is an efficient pathway to improve the performances for optimizing their application in the fields of catalysis, sensing, energy conversion, and as a chemical template. In this section, we focus on the current applications of Cu2−xS-based micro-/nanostructures.
5.1 Photocatalyst
Hybrid Cu2−xS-based nanomaterials as good photocatalysts have attracted extensive attention because they can effectively limit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the controllable synthesis of Cu2−xS-based photocatalysts with a high specific surface area, good light harvesting, and appropriate energy band potential, is still necessary. So far, the application of Cu2−xS-based photocatalysts generally involves fields such as the photodegradation of organic dye molecules, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.57,75,92,107,115,123,126,135,187,246,299–318 Typical compositions, synthetic methods, morphologies, and applications of Cu2−xS-based photocatalysts are shown in Table 2.

5.1.1 Photodegradation of dye molecules. 
As for the photocatalytic degradation of dye molecules, Cu2−xS has been proven to be efficient with the aid of H2O2 because of the generation of strong oxidative species under visible-light irradiation.75,92,107,115,123,126,135,299–301 Special nano-architectures, such as hierarchical, hollow, or interfacial/defected structures, can generate a higher activity under visible-light irradiation, in which the hierarchical and hollow architecture can promote the adsorption–desorption of reactants and provide more surface active sites for photocatalytic reactions, while the special interfacial/defected structures will tailor the charge-carrier mobility and redox potentials of the photogenerated electrons and holes. For example, hierarchical CuS structures with high surface areas and unique double pore size distributions have shown highly efficient photocatalytic activity as well as excellent recyclability in the photodegradation of highly concentrated organic dye aqueous solutions of methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and mixed MB + RhB solutions with the help of H2O2 under natural light irradiation.299 When CuS was irradiated under solar light, electrons in the VB were excited to the CB, with the simultaneous generation of holes in the VB (see eqn (1)). These photogenerated electrons and holes would be captured by H2O2 molecules, leading to the formation of oxidants (eqn (2)–(4)). In this case, H2O2 was a better electron acceptor than molecular oxygen, and increased the photocatalytic rate by limiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.302 Thus these oxidants could oxidize RhB and MB into smaller molecules, such as CO2 and H2O. The photodegradation mechanism is schematically illustrated in Fig. 33a. CuS + hν → hVB+ + eCB−(1) H2O2 + hVB+ → ˙OOH + H+(2) H2O2 + eCB− → ˙OH + OH−(3) ˙OOH → ˙O2– + H+(4)

Moreover, the hollow architecture is in favor of enhancing the photocatalytic degradation of MB solution in the presence of H2O2 under visible-light irradiation.135 The presence of nanotwins in Cu7S4 nanocages can effectively hinder the transport capability of free charges and limit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and plays an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic performance.123 In addition, photocatalytic tests for Au@Cu2S core–shell nanostructures have been carried out in the absence of H2O2 under visible-light region irradiation.246 It was found that the electron withdrawal of the Au core from the Cu2S shell occurred based on the binding energy and bandgap measurement. Also, the efficient interfacial electron migration from the excited Cu2S to the Au promotes the oxidative degradation of organic dyes, leading to a high visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation efficiency of MB and RhB dyes. However, electron withdrawal from the Au core suppresses the photocatalytic ability of Cu2S to generate the H2O2 intermediates, which limits the degradation of 1,4-dioaxne.246


5.1.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
So far, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by water splitting has been widely investigated, and the photocatalysts used must meet several criteria, including high sunlight harvesting, an effective separation of charge carriers, and good stability. Cu2S nanosheets have been proved to be an effective cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Li and coworkers demonstrated that Cu2S nanosheets composited with TiO2 nanofibers can show an about 5 times higher hydrogen evolution rate than that of single TiO2, which was attributed to the efficient light absorption from Cu2S and limitation of the recombination of electron–hole pairs.187 Photogenerated electrons and holes are generated in both Cu2S and TiO2 under light irradiation, and subsequently the electrons migrated from the CB of TiO2 into that of Cu2S in the heterojunction (see Fig. 33b). Hence, a number of photogenerared electrons located in the CB of Cu2S result in a negative adjustment in the Fermi level, promoting electrons to transfer to H+ in water to produce hydrogen gas. Similarly, CuS/TiO2303,304 and CuS/ZnO,305 can also be used in photocatalytic hydrogen generation.
Notably, investigations of novel Cu2−xS–metal sulfide photocatalystic systems for hydrogen production have been extensively developed.306–317 For example, porous CuS/ZnS nanosheet were prepared by a hydrothermal and cation-exchange reaction between preformed ZnS(ethylenediamine)0.5 nanosheets and Cu(NO3)2, in which the CuS nanoclusters were decorated onto the ZnS porous nanosheets.308 The as-prepared CuS/ZnS porous nanosheets (CuS loading content of 2 mol%) displayed a higher hydrogen production rate of 4147 μmol h−1 g−1 from aqueous solutions containing Na2S and Na2SO3, even without Pt cocatalyst, and an apparent quantum efficiency of 20% at 420 nm. These results could be attributed to the photoinduced interfacial charge transfer from the VB of ZnS to CuS, which resulted in the reduction of partial CuS to Cu2S and thus an improved photocatalytic hydrogen-production activity. Cu2S-incorporated ZnS nanocomposites can also be used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, but the hydrogen production rate is lower than that of the above-mentioned CuS/ZnS porous nanosheets. Similarly, CuS/CdS composites have been successfully applied in noble-metal-free photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. For instance, CuS/CdS nanorods prepared by a simple hydrothermal and cation-exchange method (CuS loading content of 3 mol%) displayed a hydrogen production rate of 332 μmol h−1 g−1, exceeding that of pure CdS by a factor of 3.5.310 Moreover, the Zn–Cd–S solid–solution is a promising catalytic support for constructing highly effective photocatalysts.311–315 To date, the various ZnxCd1−xS (0 < x < 1) systems with Cu2−xS as a cocatalyst have attracted extensive attention. In particular, Cu1.94S/ZnxCd1−xS heteronanorods have been synthesized for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution,315 and comprise two light absorbers, intimate heterointerfaces, tunable bandgaps over a wide range, and a uniform 1D morphology. As confirmed by experimental and density functional theory investigations, the as-prepared heteronanorods with continuous composition changes exploit the benefits of both interfacial charge separation and optimized band alignments. Thus, Cu1.94S–Zn0.23Cd0.77S heteronanorods displayed a better hydrogen production activity (7735 μmol h−1 g−1) under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) without any cocatalysts, indicating a 59-fold enhancement compared with the pristine CdS catalyst. Notably, the deposition of a Pt cocatalyst on the Cu1.94S–ZnxCd1−xS surface could further improve the hydrogen production rate to 13533 μmol h−1 g−1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 26.4% at 420 nm, which opens up opportunities to optimize the overall photocatalytic performance using rationally designed heterogeneous nanostructures.315 Similarly, without a cocatalyst, ZnIn0.25Cu0.02S1.395 also showed a better photocatalytic activity with a high apparent yield (22.6% at 420 nm).316
Besides solid–solution photocatalysts, metal sulfide photocatalysts consisting of multi-components (such as ZnS–CuS–CdS) have also been designed to achieve efficient charge flow by introducing CuS and CdS on ZnS surfaces.317 In this synthesis, ZnS was initially prepared as a support through colloidal precipitation, and then the ZnS surfaces were sequentially modified by adding CuS (cation-exchange reaction) and CdS (ionic reaction) precursors. The as-synthesized ZnS–CuS–CdS displayed a maximum hydrogen production rate of 837.6 mmol h−1 g−1 at Cu 0.81 wt% and Cd 14.7 wt% under standard solar irradiation compared to the ZnS-only case (13.5 mmol h−1 g−1). The synergistic effect of the heterostructured ZnS–CuS–CdS photocatalyst is responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity because of the improvement of the charge flow and light absorption, which also presents a great possibility for constructing multicomponent metal sulfide systems to enhance the hydrogen production rate in solar water splitting.


5.1.3 Photoreduction of CO2. 
Although fossil fuels play an important role in the energy supply and production, the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to pollution of the environment. Consequently, the conversion of CO2 is imperative. An effective pathway to mitigate the effect of the emissions is to close the carbon cycle by producing fuels, such as in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Up to date, it has been demonstrated that copper-based catalysts are some of the most promising candidates for achieving a high conversion efficiency of CO2,57,318 owing to the largely reducing conduction band and selectivity toward CO2 rather than the competing water reduction. Among the various copper sulfides, the p-type Cu2S semiconductor with a narrow indirect bandgap is attracting particular interest because it can serve as both a light absorber and cocatalyst and has been proven to reduce CO2.57 Moreover, Stolarczyk and coworkers demonstrated that Cu2S/Pt nanorods formed by a cation exchange between CdS and Cu2+ ions can be employed as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4 under broad visible-light illumination with a limitation of hydrogen production (see Fig. 33c).
Notably, the successful utilization of Cu2−xS micro-/nanocrystals in photocatalysis greatly depends on the trapping and relaxation dynamics of the charge carriers. The photogenerated electrons and holes in nanocrystals could be readily trapped at the surface states under solar light irradiation because of the larger amount of surface states in nanocrystals compared to with the bulk materials, which typically leads to decreased photocatalytic performance. Consequently, a fundamental understanding of charge-carrier trapping and relaxation dynamics in Cu2−xS nanocrystals is important to rationally design high-activity photocatalytic systems. In the past few years, the LSPS property of Cu2−xS has been extensively investigated, but the spectral signatures and dynamics of photogenerated carriers in Cu2−xS semiconductors are less known and understood. The ultrafast dynamics can be explained in terms of hot-hole relaxation and hole trapping into the localized states. In 2015, Huang and coworkers reported that the hole dynamics of CuS nanodisks can be studied by using a combination of optical and X-ray transient absorption spectroscopy.319 In this report, the optical transient absorption results demonstrated the photogenerated holes signal following excitation of the plasmonic mode and bandgap excitation. It was seen that hole trapping occurred within subpicoseconds, and was followed by charge recombination with about a 100 ps time constant. X-ray transient absorption experiments confirmed that the trap states were possibly associated with sulfur, which had a copper deficiency, and/or the ligands on the surface of the semiconductors, indicating the possibility to tailor the hole dynamics by monitoring the surface structure or copper stoichiometry. Furthermore, the ultrafast hole-trapping process might compete with the recombination of photogenerated electrons/holes, thus a greater understanding of this will support the investigation into the following charge transfer to electron/hole acceptors and offer guidance on the potential application in the field of photocatalysis. However, investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of Cu2−xS is still its infancy, and more efforts should be employed in this field.

5.2 Energy conversion

5.2.1 Supercapacitors. 
Supercapacitors have been attracting more attention because of their high power density, rapid charging/discharging rate, and long cycle life. Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of Cu2−xS-based electrodes with various stoichiometric compositions and valence states, endowing them with rich redox chemistry thus making it possible to obtain a higher specific capacity/capacitance.67 A morphology-dependent supercapacitor performance has been widely reported. For example, spherical CuS clusters displayed a high specific capacitance of 276 F g−1 (at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in cyclic voltammetry tests) and 713 F g−1 (at a charge–discharge current of 1.0 A g−1), which was determined by a higher specific surface area and absence of volume change of the nanosheets67 Hsu and coworkers reported a pseudocapacitance of CuS nanowire electrodes as high as 305 F g−1, which was a higher value than the reported CuS-based pseudocapacitors.43 Additionally, the CuS–carbon composites exhibited a high specific capacitance and good cycling performance in supercapacitors.87,268 Highly flexible Cu7S4 nanowires anchored on carbon fiber fabric (CFF) displays a superior electrochemical performance, with a maximum capacitance of 400 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and a high energy density of 35 W h kg−1 at a power density of 200 W kg−1. Also, the stability was excellent, and could still retain 95% of the specific capacitance after 5000 charge–discharge cycles.32 Therefore, the combination of different conductive components with Cu2−xS should be further investigated for obtaining high specific capacitance and pseudocapacitance performance.


5.2.2 Lithium-ion batteries. 
Copper sulfide is considered as a suitable cathode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high lithium activity, high theoretical capacity, and low cost, especially Cu2S, which is abundant and cheap in nature.40,320 The reactions of transition metal chalcogenide generally involve more electrons per 3d metal compared with the commercial one. Moreover, the potential of the transition metal sulfides versus lithium conversion depends on the ionocovalence of the bonding between the transition metal and the chalcogenide, leading to the continuous tuning from 0 to 3.5 V by adjusting the nature of the anion chalcogenide.40 Significantly, 1D nanowire arrays could exhibit a high contact area between the nanostructured electrode and electrolyte, short path distances for both electrons and lithium ions transport, and better flexibility for accommodating the strain arising from lithium-ion insertion/extraction. Hence, it is considered a promising structure for next generation electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Chen and coworkers demonstrated that large-scale, high-quality, and well-aligned Cu2S nanowire arrays on the metal current collector substrate possessed good cyclic stability, high reversible lithium storage capacity, long cycle life, and outstanding rate capability.40 As expected, the combination of conductive Cu components with Cu2−xS nanotubes exhibited good lithium storage properties with stable cyclability upon lithium ion insertion/extraction.53
However, investigation of the application of Cu2−xS in lithium-ion batteries is still rarely reported in the literature, and more effort should be applied in this field.

5.3 Chemical templates
As mentioned above, both hierarchical and hollow Cu2−xS architectures can be successfully prepared by a hard-template strategy. Interestingly, it has been found that Cu2−xS can also act as an alternative hard template for the further controllable synthesis of copper/or cuprous oxide and multicomponent metal sulfides. In a typical synthesis, the method for the Cu2−xS template-assisted synthesis of other materials can be divided into the following steps: (i) the synthesis of well-defined Cu2−xS-based templates, and (ii) the synthesis of target materials by using the above templates by oxidization treatment or an ion-exchange strategy. For instance, Xue and coworkers developed a non-equilibrium interdiffusion mechanism for the preparation of porous CuO hollow architectures by using Cu2−xS templates. First, nearly monodisperse Cu2−xS (such as CuS and Cu2S) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. Then, these precursors were thermally oxidized in air at 700 °C. Simultaneously, core/shell-structured intermediates were formed because the diffusion rate of the inner sulfides was larger than that of atmospheric oxygen during the oxidation process, thus voids were generated, leading to the formation of a hollow cavity. Finally, porous CuO hollow architectures were formed due to the volume loss and release of internally born sulfur dioxide in the process of interdiffusion. A typical thermal oxidization of CuS for synthesizing porous CuO hollow architectures is shown in Fig. 34a.321 Furthermore, CuO nanotubes were successfully synthesized from CuS nanowires embedded in an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template by an annealing-induced diffusion process. The CuO layer was anchored onto the nanochannel inter surface of AAO, finally leading to the formation of CuO nanotubes (see Fig. 34b).322 Similarly, Yang and coworkers investigated the thermal behavior of Cu2S nanowires in nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres, respectively. They found that no chemical reactions were generated except for the monoclinic-to-hexagonal phase transition in the nitrogen atmosphere at 400 °C. Further, the Cu2S nanowires were stable in the oxygen atmosphere below 200 °C, but cuprous oxides were formed predominantly at higher temperatures (>260 °C) in the presence of oxygen. At higher temperatures still (>350 °C), monoclinic cupric oxides were formed in the oxygen atmosphere. Notably, the nanowire morphologies could be maintained during the thermal oxidation treatment at different temperatures (see Fig. 34c).323 Additionally, Yang and coworkers demonstrated that the solution-phase synthesis of Cu(OH)2 nanoribbons could be facilely achieved by using a coordination self-assembly of Cu2S nanowires as precursors.324

Cation exchange is beneficial to synthesize copper indium sulfide (CIS) and quaternary copper indium zinc sulfide (CIZS) nanocrystals (see Fig. 34d). First, binary Cu2S nanocrystals were prepared, followed by a partial cation-exchange reaction between Cu+ and In3+ ions, resulting in the formation of CIS nanocrystals. In the next step, a further partial exchange was performed, where Zn2+ partially replaced the Cu+ and In3+ cations at the surface, leading to the formation of a ZnS-rich shell together with preservation of the pristine size and shape. The composition and size of the products could be carefully tailored at different initial Cu+:In3+:Zn2+ ratios.325 Moreover, it was noted that the organic solvent was also important for controlling the size and morphology of the CuInS2 nanocrystals through a Cu2S seed-mediated strategy.326 In addition, various kinds of Cu–Zn–S-based hetero-nanostructures were synthesized by a solid-state conversion reaction at low temperature using vertically aligned Cu2S nanowires as both a physical template and chemical source.327
Briefly, it can be proposed that the various compositional Cu2−xS nanostructures and their hybrid forms, combined with different template-based synthetic strategies, can provide a perspective route to design and synthesize a number of new hybrid nanocomposites.
5.4 Biomedical applications
In this subsection, we briefly summarize the recent progress made in biomedical applications of various Cu2−xS-based nanoparticles. During the past few decades, Cu2−xS nanoparticles and their conjugates have been widely used in in vitro biosensing, especially in the detection of biomedical molecules, including glucose, DNA, and hydrogen peroxide, which could be attributed to their metal-like electrical conductivity and the ability to optimize electron transfer reactions with biomolecules. Significantly, the in vivo application of CuS nanoparticles, such as in chemo-/photothermal therapy and delivery and theranostic applications, has attracted more and more attention because of their highly versatile and ready control for various biomedical applications. Here, after a brief overview to Cu2−xS nanoparticles in in vitro biomedical applications, we further introduce the new advancements in in vivo chemo-/photothermal therapy by using conjugated Cu2−xS nanocomposites.

5.4.1 
            In vitro biosensing. 
In the past decade, extensive attention has been paid to electrochemical biosensor owing to its importance for facile and fast determination in clinical diagnostics and for applications in the food industry. The nonstoichiometric Cu component in Cu2−xS offers an intriguing activity in in vitro redox biosensing reactions. In particular, hierarchical and hollow Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures with good physicochemical properties are in favor for application in biosensing.
Precise detection of the glucose level in human body is imperative because the concentration of glucose is an informal indicator in diseases such as diabetics and other endocrine metabolic disorders. Currently, it has been proven that electrochemical non-enzymatic biosensors based on the direct oxidation of glucose can generate a higher stability than enzymatic biosensors. As for Cu2−xS biosensors, it has found that hollow CuS nanotubes could act as a modified electrode for the non-enzymatic detection of glucose in an alkaline condition, and displayed a large linear response range, high sensitivity, and a low detection limit.48 Furthermore, the detection of H2O2, human immunoglobulin G and DNA was also reported by using different CuS nanostructures.24,31,78,83 Additionally, CuS is a new kind of candidate for peroxidase mimics, which opens up a new kind of candidates over the previous Fe3O4 and carbon nanostructures. For example, CuS concave superstructures can present an intrinsic peroxidase-like activity, which quickly catalyzed the oxidation of typical horseradish peroxidase substrates, including 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and o-phenylenediamine, in the presence of H2O2.113 Detailed biomedical application of CuS nanoparticles have been reported by a number of previous review articles.3,328 However, the inherent conductivity of Cu2−xS semiconductors is not very good, which leads to a decrease in the charge separation and transfer to some extent, and limits the electrochemical performance of the biosensors. Thus, Cu2−xS–CNTs combined with conductive CNTs composites can effectively enhance the electrochemical performance toward the non-enzymatic detection of glucose.269 However, the exact biosensing mechanism in the Cu–S system is still unknown, so the design and synthesis of new hybrid Cu2−xS is highly necessary.


5.4.2 
            In vivo imaging and therapy. 
Aside from the plasmonic gold nanoparticles with tunable optical absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR) for biomedical applications, low-cost Cu2−xS has been used as a new class of photothermal conducting agent for in vivo imaging and therapy because Cu2−xS nanostructures also show strong absorption in the near-infrared region, exhibit highly efficient light-to-heat transformation under near-infrared laser irradiation, and generate selective thermal destruction to tumors. Therefore, Cu2−xS and their hybrids can be widely used in the fields of photoacoustic tomography (PAT) imaging, chemo-/photothermal therapy, drug delivery, and theranostics.3,328
PAT imaging is used for the detection of thermoelastic expansion and ultrasonic signals generated by the photothermal expansion of light-absorbing tissues or contrast agents under the irradiation of short laser pulses.328 Traditional PAT imaging generally depends on the generation of contrast through differences in the blood perfusion between normal and tumor tissues, but such an intrinsic contrast might be not precise enough for the early detection of cancer or the imaging of deeper tumor tissues. To date, it has been demonstrated that Cu2−xS nanoparticles could be employed in clinical applications, including imaging breast lesions up to 4 cm deep, as well as other superficial lesions in the skin, limbs, head and neck, and lymph nodes. Furthermore, enhanced specificity and sensitivity for the potential clinical application of Cu2−xS nanoparticles can be obtained by optimizing an efficient laser source. For instance, Li and coworkers found that CuS nanodots with strong absorption at wavelengths larger than 900 nm can acted as a novel type of contrast agent for the in vivo detection of PAT images,11 which was a higher wavelength than that possible with gold nanostructures and organic dyes, making it suitable to use Q-switched Nd:YAG laser light at 1064 nm for PAT imaging. Therefore, deep tissue PAT imaging can be obtained by using CuS nanoparticles, because of the low absorption and scattering coefficient in normal tissue at 1064 nm. Additionally, PEG-layered Cu2−xS nanoparticles were suitable for the in vivo imaging of tumor vasculature.287,329,330
Photothermal ablation is an active area of in vivo biomedical application where Cu2−xS nanoparticles are currently increasingly being investigated and can prospectively kill tumor cells by heating at 40–45 °C through a focused, skin penetrating NIR laser beam (typically in the range of 700–1065 nm). A number of heat sources have been used, such as microwave, magnetic field, radiofrequency, and laser stimulation. However, a severe bottleneck is posed by the non-specific absorption of heat by healthy tissues between the laser source and the tumor mass.3 Hence, it is necessary to develop novel photothermal agents with increased photothermal efficiency to decrease the energy dose of the used laser and hence the damage to surrounding tissues. The NIR absorption of Cu2−xS nanoparticles (the maximum absorption wavelength at ∼900 nm) stem from the d–d transitions of Cu2+ ions, which is different from the NIR absorption of Au nanostructures that rely on LSPR (maximum absorption wavelength <850 nm). Moreover, the absorption wavelength due to intraband transitions in Cu2−xS nanoparticles is not affected by the size and shape of the nanoparticles or the solvent, although deviations from this stoichiometry have been shown to exhibit LSPR-based NIR absorption similar to metals. So far, the use of Cu2−xS nanostructures (such as nanodots,331,332 hollow,333 and superstructures94 and their hybrids334,335) as photothermal mediators has been widely investigated.3,328
The development of biocompatible targeted drug delivery platforms can importantly enhance metastatic cancer patient management. In the past decades, it has been proven that nanomaterials are effective carriers for the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs owing to their larger surface area/loading capacity, appropriate size, and versatile physicochemical property, which can lead to the formation of large specific surface volumes and numerous mesoporous pores for efficiently loading them with hydrophobic drug molecules. A number of research studies have demonstrated Cu2−xS nanoparticles with interesting properties as delivery vehicles, where hollow Cu2−xS nanoparticles132 and porous silica-Cu2−xS-based nanocomplexes,288–295 for example, have been utilized for controlling the drug delivery because both of them can exhibit an exceptionally high drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX) or imaging agents and can release the anticancer drug in a pH-dependent fashion and with NIR light. In this case, Cu2−xS nanoparticles acted as both a gatekeeper, preventing the premature release of drugs, and as a photothermal conducting agent, for the ablation of cancer cells. It should be noted that hybrid organic–inorganic nanosystems are of great interest as an emerging class of drug nanocarriers due to their broad compositional and structural diversity.269–276 Recently, a review article on copper-based nanostructure showed how it can serve as a versatile vehicle for drug delivery and image-guided therapy.328
Theranostics is a single platform for combining both therapy and diagnosis. The combination of different targeting ligands, imaging labels, therapeutic drugs, and various polymers to enhance their water solubility and biocompatibility, can allow for the effective and controlled delivery of therapeutic agents in patients, which can also be non-invasively monitored in real time.336 The detailed merits of Cu2−xS for theranostic applications are as follows:328 (i) they could act as nuclear tracers or contrast agents for a variety of imaging and diagnostic techniques; (ii) they can kill cancer cells through photothermal effects; (iii) they can release drugs controllably in response to an external stimulus. (iv) The above features can be easily integrated in a single system to fulfill both diagnostic and therapeutic requirements. Based on the above properties, Cu2−xS-based nanoparticles have also been investigated for cancer theranostics. For example, Huang and coworkers found that uniform CuS–ferritin nanocages (CuS–Fn NCs) showed strong near-infrared absorbance and a high photothermal conversion efficiency. In quantitative ratiometric photoacoustic imaging (PAI), CuS–Fn NCs showed superior photoacoustic tomography enhancements for the real-time in vivo PAI of entire tumors. With the incorporation of the radionuclide 64Cu, [64Cu]–CuS also acted as an effective imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET) compared to free copper. Therefore, these CuS–Fn NCs can be employed in photothermal therapy to achieve excellent cancer therapeutic efficiency with good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo.277 Furthermore, water-soluble photothermally sensitive CuS nanoparticles encapsulated in biocompatible mesoporous silica shells (CuS@MSN) were shown to be effective to control the surface engineering for tumor vasculature targeting and photothermal therapy. Based on the above nanostructures, a novel 64[Cu]-CuS@MSN-TRC105 was developed to investigate the potential of these nanoparticles for in vivo tumor-targeted photothermally improved drug delivery and thermochemotherapy.280 Briefly, these current studies have demonstrated the potential of Cu2−xS nanoparticles as a promising multifunctional platform for cancer imaging and therapy. A typical scheme for some biomedical applications of copper sulfide nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 35.3

Despite the many positive results of Cu2−xS in vitro and in vivo investigations in the past decades, research on the biomedical applications of Cu2−xS nanoparticles is still in its infancy. A few major challenges still need to be overcome in the future:3,328 (i) a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity of Cu2−xS nanoparticles is imperative; (ii) the in vivo interaction of Cu2−xS nanoparticles with the body is uncertain and difficult to predict; (iii) a high power laser is needed to active Cu2−xS nanoparticles under in vivo conditions, leading to limitation of their therapeutic and drug delivery applications; (iv) correct surface modifications and precise control in shape/size/composition of Cu2−xS-based nanocomposites are necessary to further explore them for optimizing the photothermal conversion efficiency. Overall, Cu2−xS-based nanocomposites offer a tremendous potential to promote the development of novel biomedical systems for cancer imaging and therapy.

6. Conclusions and future perspectives
Diverse Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures have been extensively developed for application in the fields of photocatalysis, energy conversion, in vitro biosensing, and in vivo imaging and therapy, due to their unique optical and electronic properties, controllable morphologies, sizes, and compositions as well as crystalline phases. Herein, a comprehensive summary on the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms, the morphological and compositional diversities, the functional modifications (including hybridizing and doping) of interfacial and electronic structures, and their current applications have been overviewed for different types of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures. The achievements made in the controllable synthesis of morphological and compositional Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures also offer a good chance for the rational design and fabrication of novel hybrid Cu2−xS-based composites with enhanced performances. Aside from the current studies and results researchers have investigated over the past decades, as outlined in this review, there is still a long way ahead before Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures can be comprehensively understood and well-applied. The present issues and promising research directions are proposed as follows.
In regard to the synthesis of a novel Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructure, a significant target is to obtain the optimum growth mechanism and thereby to tune the morphology, size, composition, crystalline-phase, monodispersity, surface/interfacial atomic arrangement, and electronic structure. As for 3D polyhedral Cu2−xS, the fabrication of more highly active facets, especially high-index facets, would provide a top priority for optimizing the chemical activity. However, currently the as-synthesized Cu2−xS polyhedra are all exposed with low-index facets, limiting the investigation of the facet-dependent property of Cu2−xS. Consequently, the synthesis of novel Cu2−xS nanostructures exposed with controllable-index facets should be further employed to uncover the relationship between the surface atomic structures and performance. Moreover, new strategies should be developed for synthesizing highly active hollow and hierarchical nanostructures with much smaller sizes and tunable compositions. As for 2D Cu2−xS, the preparation of large-scale ultrathin nanosheets is still a challenge because the synthetic strategy still has limitations. As for 1D Cu2−xS, obtaining a hollow or hierarchical architecture with a nanoscale diameter (<100 nm) is still a bottleneck. As for 0D Cu2−xS, the current synthetic methods generally involve a surfactant and organic solvent, which would affect the purity of the product, thereby a surfactant-free synthetic strategy is worth exploring. Additionally, the development of morphological 1D, 2D, and 3D Cu2−xS superlattices can increase the number of active sites and enhance the mass transfer and migration, leading to an improvement of the unique performances. However, the controllable synthesis of Cu2−xS superlattices is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is still necessary to investigate the preparation of Cu2−xS superlattices with the desired crystallographic facets, morphologies, and compositions. Additionally, it is noted that the crystal packing of Cu2−xS with different x values can strongly affect the semimetallic behavior, thus the composition-controlled synthesis of Cu2−xS nanostructures is important in tuning their physicochemical properties.
To further optimize the performances of pristine Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures, modifications (including doping and hybridizing) are extremely imperative to be developed. For doped Cu2−xS, the current achievement is limited to only a few chemical elements (such as iodine and zinc), thus it is still a great challenge to expand the selective doping of more heteroatoms for enhanced performance, so an effective strategy for achieving the synthesis of new doped-Cu2−xS should be taken into consideration. For hybridized Cu2−xS, the selective-hybridizing of active components to specific facets of Cu2−xS micro-/nanostructures should be specially explored. Significantly, theoretical calculations of the doping electronic structures and hybridizing interfacial structures should be investigated thoroughly.
The application of low-cost Cu2−xS templates for the synthesis of ternary metal sulfides and multicomponent heterogeneous nanocomposites is a promising field. In particular, a sacrificial hybrid Cu2−xS-based template (such as metal–Cu2−xS, semiconductor–Cu2−xS and carbon–Cu2−xS) could be applied to selectively design and prepare a number of novel multicomponent nanocomposites. Emphatically, the absorption band of Cu2−xS in the near-infrared region can result in the LSPR due to the presence of charge carriers, which brings about significant application potential in the fields of photocatalysis (including the photodegradation of organic dyes, photocatalytic hydrogen production, and the photoreduction of CO2) and biomedicine (including in vitro biosensing and in vivo cancer imaging and therapy). Although hybrid Cu2−xS-based nanocomposites (various combinations of hollow/porous/core–shell architectures, polymeric coatings, and functional moieties) are considered as promising candidates for biomedical applications, several challenges still need to be overcome in the future, such as the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity of Cu2−xS nanoparticles and the lower photothermal conversion efficiency.
Overall, this in-depth review on the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms, the modifications, and their perspective applications, will help to accelerate the development of function-directed Cu2−xS-based micro-/nanostructures. This field remains greatly untapped yet offers expansive opportunities.
