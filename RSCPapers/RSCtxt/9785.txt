    , Accepted 22nd June 2009First published on 21st July 2009AbstractA novel quantum-dot-based solar cell assembly consisting of core-shell Zn-doped CuInS2@ZnS (Zn-CIS@ZnS) quantum dots associated with short ZnO (5 μm in length) nanowires was developed and systematically investigated in terms of its nanostructure and optical properties, associated with corresponding solar cell parameters, i.e., VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF). In this investigation, the photo-conversion efficiency of the Zn-CIS-based solar cells without the presence of the ZnS shell can be readily tuned by controlling the Zn/Cu ratio. Furthermore, the efficiency was significantly improved upon the deposition of a thin ZnS shell on these Zn-CIS QDs, where a significant enhancement in short-circuit current density (JSC) by 88% was observed because the ZnS coating is able to effectively eliminate excited electron recombination and enhance the charge transfer efficiency from Zn-CIS QDs to ZnO nanowires. Power-conversion efficiency as high as 0.71% can be attained, which is improved more than 2–3 times compared with that without ZnS coating. Such a unique nanoarchitecture through coupling with both core-shell QDs and short ZnO nanowires suggests a promising design for a quantum dot-based solar cell with considerably improved power-conversion efficiency.
Introduction
During the past decade, energy resource concerns have become more and more imperative, and great efforts have been focused on the development of renewable energy resources,1 among which photovoltaic solar power holds great potential and brilliant advantages, e.g. it is nonpolluting, safe and inexhaustible. The photovoltaic community is well aware of the cost benefits which are associated with the continued increase in solar cell efficiency.
Recently, zinc oxide nanowires have attracted a considerable amount of research interest as potential candidates for optoelectronics applications such as nanoscale lasers, light-emitting diodes, and UV photodetectors.2 Moreover, ZnO nanowires also have been substituted for TiO2nanoparticles as n-type photoelectrodes in photovoltaic devices.3 Wide band gap ZnO nanowires can provide direct conduction pathways for electrons to transport to the collection electrode. They also help improve electron transport by avoiding the particle-to-particle hopping that occurs in the TiO2 network. Thus, ZnO nanowires can efficiently enhance charge transport ability and efficiency, which is controversially the crux for nanocomposite photovoltaic solar cells (PVs). Recently, a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) made from solution-based ZnO nanowire has achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.5%,4a and a DSSC made from ZnO nanowire with a dendritic structure has achieved a power efficiency of 0.5%.4b In both cases, the ZnO nanowires are tens of micrometers in length, which requires a long-term growing process. While ZnO nanowires with the proper length prevent corrosion by the electrolyte and exhibit an efficient light-harvesting surface area, over-length ZnO nanowires would prolong the transfer pathway of electrons from the light-sensitizer, resulting in an increasing possibility of electron-trapping by defects on the ZnO surface and limiting power conversion efficiency.
The other critical challenge in nanocomposite PV applications is efficient utilization of solar energy, about 60% of which has wavelengths longer than 700 nm. One plausible strategy is the use of semiconductor nanocrystals, known as narrow band gap quantum dots (QDs), instead of photosensitized dyes. In addition, it has been shown recently that QDs can generate multiple electron-hole pairs per photon, which could improve the efficiency of the device.5 This concept has been demonstrated on TiO2 and ZnO electrodes by depositing CdS6 and CdSe.7 For such a dye-sensitized system, QDs are known to be neutralized or corroded by an electrolyte and, therefore, the solar cell performance of such QDs is limited. Therefore, considering this problem, there are two fundamental ways to optimize this kind of QD-based solar cell. One requires a transition away from a liquid electrolyte to a different hole transport medium. Some researches studied solid8 or gel state electrolytes9 to be substituted for the liquid electrolyte. However, their efficiency and long-term stability are not comparable with those of liquid electrolytes. The other method is to deposit a protecting layer on the surface of QDs. Wide band gap materials such as CdS, ZnS, and ZnSe have been widely used as shells to enhance the photoluminescence quantum yield by passivating surface nonradiative recombination sites.10 Base on this concept, wide band gap shells not only can improve the optical properties of QDs, but also protect them from corrosion by the liquid electrolyte.
It has been demonstrated that CuInS2 (CIS), whose band gap energy is 1.55 eV (bulk), is a promising photosensitizer for ZnO. The band gap of CIS QDs can be tuned by using a Zn dopant.11 From the viewpoint of band-energy engineering, ZnS is an energetically suitable medium due to its proper band gap (2.67 eV) which is believed to be able to efficiently promote electron transitions between CIS QDs and ZnO nanowires (Scheme 1). Therefore, ZnS is chosen in this study as a dual-functioning candidate, acting as a photosensitizer and at the same time to protect the Zn-doped CIS from undesirable chemical degradation. As well as this chemical modification, a modified quantum dot solar cell by assembling Zn-CIS nanoparticles on single crystal ZnO nanowires using a bifunctional surface modifier is also investigated. Upon constructing the solar cell device, we believe that increasing the QD coverage on the ZnO nanowires will surely boost the efficiency of energy conversion, and on this basis a short nanowire, i.e., 5 micrometers in length, was employed in order to testify such a hypothesis. With recent advances in using protecting layers in solar cells for efficient transport of charge carriers, it should be possible to further improve the efficiency of quantum dot solar cells.

Results and discussion
Quantized Zn-CIS particles and their deposition on ZnO nanowires
The absorption spectra of the different-ratio Zn-CIS quantum dots employed in the present study are shown in Fig. 1(a). These particles exhibit absorption in the visible wavelength range with an onset corresponding to the Cu/Zn ratio. The shift of the onset absorption to lower wavelengths with decreasing n value represents the Zn doping effect in these particles. By comparing the excitonic transitions (660, 570, 530 nm for n = 3, 2, and 1, respectively.) with the absorption curve reported by Nakamura and co-workers,11 the average particle diameters of these samples were identified as 4.4, 4.5, and 3.5 nm respectively. It is noticeable that the absorption and photoluminescence (not shown here) properties of Zn-CIS nanocrystals are dominated not only by the particle size but also by the concentration of Zn dopant. The Cu site in the lattice is preferentially substituted by Zn and the substitution is found to be energetically favorable to prevent anti-site defects, which will affect the absorption spectrum. Therefore, by increasing the Cu/Zn ratio (or decreasing the Zn concentration) in the reaction solution, the absorption edge shifted from ca. 400 to ca. 700 nm toward longer wavelength. Fig. 1(b) shows the similar absorption spectra of hydrophilic QDs after ligand exchange, which shows that the particle size and optical properties of the QDs were not changed after surface modification compared to the original QDs (in toluene). Exchange of TOP by thiols at the surface of Zn-CIS nanocrystals was accompanied by a slight blue shift of the absorption spectrum. Similar phenomena were also reported for CdSe ad CdTe QDs.12 The blue shift was due to a redistribution of electronic density and an increase in confinement energy induced by the stronger bond between the thiol and the Cu atoms at the Zn-CIS nanocrystal surface. These quantum dots were then deposited on ZnO nanowires for spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical investigation.

Fig. 2(a) shows a cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph of typical ZnO nanowires used as photoanodes. The nanowires are approximately 50–60 nm in diameter and ∼5 µm in length, indicating a relatively large surface area to accommodate a high concentration of sensitizer molecules (and a higher concentration of QD deposition). All the samples used in this study displayed good stoichiometric composition and crystallinity according to XRD and XPS analyses (not shown here). Fig. 2(b) shows a high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) of a MPA-capped Zn-CIS QD isolated from a colloidal suspension. TEM images indicate that the QDs are single crystals with diameters ranging from 3 to 4 nm, i.e., 3.5 nm on average. Such MPA-capped Zn-CIS QDs could attach to the ZnO surfaces viacarboxylate groups. A bright-field TEM image of a ZnO nanowire largely covered with an ensemble of Zn-CIS QDs is shown in Fig. 2(c). The QDs are visible as the circular dark spots on the surface of the nanowires and EDX confirms the Zn-CIS composition. However, for a sample deposited with a high concentration of QDs, there will be a certain degree of aggregation during the QD deposition. In these conditions, a size larger than 3.5 nm is possibly observed in Fig. 2(c). The HRTEM image of the nanowire edge (Fig. 2(d)) provides more compelling evidence that QDs are attached to the nanowire surface. An abrupt transition is observed between the (1010) lattice planes of the ZnO nanowire and the (112) lattice planes of the Zn-CIS QD, indicating an intimate contact between the QD and the nanowire within an approximate distance of 0.29 nm, or one ZnO (1010) lattice spacing.

Fig. 3(a) shows the appearance of three solutions with different ratios of Zn-CIS quantum dots dispersed in water, and then deposited onto OTE/ZnO nanowires (Fig. 3(b)), respectively. The photographs show electrodes of different colours, yellow, red and black, corresponding to the deposition of Zn-CIS QDs of 3.5, 4.5 and 4.4 nm size,11 respectively. However, since prolonged immersion in the Zn-CIS solution does not further enhance the absorption ability of the Zn-CIS, it was then assumed that the coverage of Zn-CIS nanoparticles on the ZnO nanowire surface is spatially saturated as a monolayer deposition. This can be further verified by the fact that the QD surface was first organically modified by MPA, wherein the surface interaction between ZnO nanowire and Zn-CIS QD resulted from a chemical anchorage of the acidic group to the ZnO nanowire and of the sulfuric group to the Zn-CIS QD. Multilayer deposition may be sterically inhibited as a result of repulsive interactions of MPA molecules between two approaching QD nanoparticles.

The optical absorption properties of the Zn-CIS-coated ZnO nanowires are presented in Fig. 3(c). It is evident that different-sized Zn-CIS particles exhibit excitonic transitions at 660, 570 and 530 nm. These excitonic peaks are similar to those observed for the QDs in the solution (Fig. 1) and thus this confirms the binding of Zn-CIS QDs of varying sizes to the ZnO surface. Thus, the coloration of the ZnO nanowires offers an opportunity to selectively harvest incident light (the reflectance spectrum of an uncoated F-doped SnO2 substrate was used as reference).
Photovoltaic performance of the devices with various ratios of Zn dopant

Fig. 4 shows the I–V curves of the QD-DSSC devices integrated with those Zn-CIS-coated ZnO nanowires, which are assembled into a layer-type film. The relevant solar-cell parameters for the three samples are given in Table 1, which include the current density at short circuit (JSC in mA cm−2), the voltage at open circuit (VOC in V), the fill factor (FF), and the efficiency of power conversion (η = JSC·VOC·FF/Pin with Pin = 100 mW cm−2).

A systematic trend with VOC decreasing upon increasing the n value (i.e., decreasing Zn doping) was disclosed. This result is similar to the work of Braunger et al.,13 who reported that the incorporation of small amounts of Zn led to an increased VOC. However, the value of FF is lower than that achieved in TiO2 DSSC solar cells (0.6–0.7), which is attributed to recombination between photoexcited carriers in the ZnO nanowires and tri-iodide ions in the electrolyte. Because of the improvements in JSC, and FF, the overall efficiency of conversion of photons to current exhibits a systematic increase from η = 0.23% at n = 1 to η = 0.28% at n = 2, but shows a decrease at n = 3 (η = 0.24%). As can be seen, two important factors restrict the efficiency in the case of n = 1. The first limitation is the low FF, which indicates that electron transport in the ZnO nanowires has been obstructed. This obstruction can be attributed to two explanations: one is the presence of Zn2+-ZCIS aggregates arising from the unstable surface chemistry of the ZnO nanowire electrode. During the assembly process, the acidic Zn-CIS QDs partially dissolve the ZnO surface to form Zn2+-ZCIS aggregates which deposit along the nano-pore walls in the electrode and thus interfere with the Zn-CIS QDs in generation of the photoelectrons.14 The other factor is the higher driving force for electron injection. The conduction band edge of Zn-CIS with n = 1 is higher than the others due to the greater amount of Zn doping. Therefore, a higher injection resistance exists at the ZnO/Zn-CIS interface and the photocurrent decreases more rapidly with the opposite potential applied, leading to a lower FF. Although the former situation exists in all three cases (n = 1–3), the latter one is expected to dominate and explain the low FF. The second limitation to restrict the efficiency (n = 1) is the slightly lower Jsc, which is attributed to insufficient photocurrent probably due to the lack of a full spectrum of light absorption. However, it shows a slight reduction of the efficiency when n = 3, which is due to the decreasing Zn doping restricted open-circuit voltage and results in a low efficiency. Comparing with the efficiency reported by Leschkies et al.,7d who obtained 0.4% power-conversion efficiency and a short-circuit current of 2.1 mA/cm2 for a system of CdSe QDs with ZnO nanowires, the best power-conversion efficiency of the current study has reached a lower value of 0.28%. However, upon being normalized with those technical data in terms of the length of the ZnO nanowires, the average current density is 0.342 mA/cm2 per µm length, which is higher than that reported for the CdSe QDs with a 12µm ZnO nanowire system having a value of 0.175 mA/cm2 per µm length. Since it is reasonable to believe the population of the QD deposited on the nanowires will influence the resulting power-conversion efficiency, where a higher number of QD on the nanowire surface means a higher photocurrent can be produced while other variables are held constant, the average deposited number of Zn-CIS QDs per unit surface area of the ZnO nanowire can then be estimated. In this case, the surface area of a 5 µm length single ZnO nanowire with 50 nm diameter is ca. 0.785 µm2, which can accommodate about 45700 Zn-CIS quantum dots with 3.5 nm diameter for a hexagonal closed packing configuration, converting to an average adsorption number per µm2 of about 58000. This is technically achievable since the microscopic observation readily showed full coverage of the nanowire by the QDs. For the case of ref. 7d, the calculated surface area and average absorption number is 4.7 µm2 and 68000 per µm2 (12 µm length and 125 nm diameter ZnO nanowire, 3 nm diameter CdSe), respectively, which is higher by 10 times in surface area, but only larger by about 10% in QD population compared to the nanowires employed in the current study. However, in practice, the population of QDs deposited on 12 µm ZnO nanowire is sparingly distributed, rather than closely packed, which probably explains why the power-conversion efficiency for the latter system is not as high as expected but only slightly higher, by about 7.5%, than the current experimental outcome. Such a comparison strongly indicates that the overall power conversion efficiency of the QD-DSSCs should be largely limited by (1) the surface area of the nanowires available for QD deposition and (2) the deposited population of the QD. The length and the size of the nanowire are unlikely to be major dominating factors for controlling the efficiency. This result proved our hypothesis regarding the average current density for the QD-ZnO nanowires solar cell system.
Design of the ZnS shell as a dual-function layer
Based on the results reported above, there are two major competing pathways that reduced the performance of the Zn-CIS-coated ZnO nanowire device when the electrons transfer toward the ZnO nanowire electrodes. The first recombination dynamic is attributed to the complex reaction between excited electrons in the Zn-CIS excited state and the I3− in the electrolyte. The second recombination dynamic results from the capture of these excited electrons by Zn-CIS cations, resulting in the QD regeneration reaction and no longer competing efficiently with this reaction. These faster recombination dynamics, however, result in an enhanced dark current for these devices and consequently limit the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the device, as evidenced by the current/voltage data. As was known, partial QD corrosion by the electrolyte and charge recombination between ZnO and Zn-CIS might be the major origins for the reduced efficiency. The source of charge recombination might have been due to the band discontinuity between ZnO and Zn-CIS. Given these considerations, a key strategy for optimization of the performance of Zn-CIS-based devices is the minimization of interfacial charge recombination losses. To address this issue, a novel core-shell configuration with ZnS as a shell on the Zn-CIS QD (as core) was designed; the shell acts as both a protecting layer and a band-bridge layer.

Fig. 5 shows I–V characteristics of two QD-DSSCs recorded during illumination with 100 mW/cm2 simulated AM1.5 spectrum. One of these cells (circles) was constructed using the core-shell QDs whilst the other was formed without the ZnS shell (squares, sample with n = 2) for comparison. The inset parameters are the Voc, Jsc, FF, and η of the ZnS-coated sample. It was found that both the power conversion efficiency (0.0.66%) and the short-circuit current (3.12 mA/cm2) of the QD-DSSC modified by ZnS coating exhibited much higher values than those obtained without the coating. Noticeably, the efficiency was increased more than 2 times after ZnS coating, which indicated that the ZnS coating effectively enhanced the performance of the QD-based solar cell. The values of Voc, Jsc and FF were also increased after the ZnS coating, which suggests that the ZnS coating is able to effectively eliminate the excited electron recombination. The influence of ZnS layer deposition for this QD-based solar cell will be elucidated in more detail in a later section.

Under open-circuit conditions, it is believed that electrons accumulate within the ZnS shell under visible irradiation, which shifts the apparent Fermi level to negative potentials. Once the illumination is removed, the accumulated electrons are slowly discharged because they are scavenged by the defects on the ZnO nanowire surface. On this basis, the electrons injected from the excited Zn-CIS should survive longer and hence facilitate electron transport without undergoing any possible loss at grain boundaries.
To prove this assumption, we further employed picosecond emission decay measurements to analyze the excited electron lifetime, in order to gain a better understanding of the recombination dynamics of excitons.
Mechanistic aspects of charge transfer into ZnO nanowires
On the basis of the principle of sensitizing large-band-gap semiconductors with short-band-gap semiconductors, efforts have been made to employ short-band-gap semiconductors as sensitizers to extend the photoresponse of ZnO into the visible region. The Zn-CIS particles exhibit a band-edge emission peak, which also shifts to the blue region with decreasing particle size. Fig. 6(a) shows the emission spectra of n = 2 Zn-CIS QDs deposited on glass slide and ZnO NWs. These QDs exhibit characteristic emission peaks at 660 nm. When Zn-CIS was anchored onto a ZnO nanowire (Fig. 6(b)), a significant quenching of the emission was seen, thus confirming the excited-state interaction between the two dissimilar semiconductor particles. This quenching behavior represents the deactivation of the excited Zn-CIS viaelectron transfer to ZnO nanowires. The processes that follow the band-gap excitation of Zn-CIS are presented in Equations (1)–(3): Zn-CIS + hv → Zn-CIS(e+h) → Zn-CIS + hv(1) Zn-CIS(e) + ZnO → Zn-CIS + ZnO(e)(2) Zn-CIS(h) + redox → Zn-CIS + Ox(3)Whereas the electrons injected into ZnO are collected to generate photocurrent, it is necessary to employ a redox couple to scavenge the holes (Eq 3). Failure to scavenge holes could lead to surface oxidation, especially during extended periods of irradiation.15

Emission spectra of 4.5 nm (n = 2) diameter Zn-CIS quantum dot films deposited on (a) glass and (b) ITO/ZnO NW films. Excitation was at 410 nm. Spectrum b carries a multiplication factor of 3. All of the spectra were recorded using front face geometry. 
Time-dependent measurements of Zn-CIS on various plates were performed using time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) with excitation at λex = 410 nm. Typical results of a Zn-CIS/glass solution, a Zn-CIS/ZnO film, and a Zn-CIS@ZnS/ZnO film are shown in Fig. 7. To investigate the effect of a rigid environment without interference from electron-transfer dynamics, deposition of Zn-CIS QDs on a glass plate was prepared. The phosphorescent decay of the Zn-CIS/glass construct is describable with a multiexponential decay; three time coefficients obtained from regression analysis of the data fitting are listed in Table 2. When deposited on a glass slide, Zn-CIS particles exhibited emission decays with an average lifetime of 22.6 ns. We anchored Zn-CIS on ZnO films to test the effect of electron transfer through space from Zn-CIS to ZnO nanowires. The emission transient is quenched more rapidly than that of the Zn-CIS/glass construct, Fig. 7, having an average lifetime of 3.53 ns and some curve-fitted parameters are also given in Table 2. This result indicates that interfacial electron transfer through space efficiently quenches the phosphorescence in the nanosecond range. In the transient of a Zn-CIS/ZnO film, an additional 0.27 ns component appeared, and other nanosecond components were substantially quenched. If the shortening of the average lifetime is attributed to quenching by electron transfer from Zn-CIS QDs to ZnO nanowires, the photocurrent density should be higher than the value mentioned above. However, the efficiency is much lower than what is predicted, indicating electron transfer from Zn-CIS QDs to ZnO nanowires is not the only exciton relaxation path. According to the hypothesis, faster recombination from excitons trapped by redox or Zn-CIS cation caused an enhancement of dark current. After ZnS coating on the surface of Zn-CIS, the average lifetimes were lengthened from 3.53 to 7.7 ns due to the higher conduction band level of the ZnS layer than that of Zn-CIS. The slower decay observed with ZnS coating provides a strong indication that the electrons injected from excited Zn-CIS can survive longer and hence facilitate electron transport without undergoing possible losses at grain boundaries or trapping by redox species, rather than obstructing the electron transfer between Zn-CIS QDs and ZnO nanowires. From Equation 4, the electron-transfer rate constants of Zn-CIS and Zn-CIS@ZnS core-shell QDs were evaluated; the results are listed in Table 2, indicating the energy transfer of excited Zn-CIS QDs is multiple radiative exciton relaxation from the energetically distributed surface states (ket ≦ 109 s−1).16 (4)

This implies that the surface of the nanocrystals provides a significant source of defects or unpassivated sites where nonradiative recombination can take place. In contrast, ZnS coating appears to eliminate the competing recombination pathways and improves charge transfer efficiency from the excited state to the ZnO nanowire.
Effect of ZnS shell thickness
To understand the effect of the layer thickness of the ZnS shell on the resulting photo-conversion performance, Zn-CIS QDs with varying ZnS shell thicknesses were prepared and the corresponding power-conversion efficiencies were examined. Fig. 8 shows the efficiency of the core-shell (Zn-CIS)ZnS QD-based devices with ZnS coverage of approximately 0, 0.6, 1.3, and 2.5 monolayers. The definition of a monolayer here is a shell of ZnS that measures 0.31 nm (the distance between consecutive planes along the [002] axis in bulk wurtzite ZnS) along the major axis of ZnS-coated QDs. As the coverage of ZnS on the Zn-CIS surface increases, a dramatic increase in efficiency was detected, followed by a steady decline at thicknesses above ∼1.3 monolayers. Table 3 summarizes the relevant solar-cell parameters for these samples. It was found that the efficiency value increases from 0.28 to 0.71 with thickening of the ZnS shell to 1.3 monolayers, which mainly results from an increasing Jsc (from 1.29 to 3.50 mA/cm2). The enhancement of Jsc was attributed to the increased electrons (or excitons) transferred from the Zn-CIS core to the ZnO electrode through the ZnS shell. Surface passivation by proper coverage of ZnS not only eliminated defects but also promoted efficient electron transfer. However, once the coverage of ZnS is thicker than 1.3 monolayers, the Jsc value decreased considerably by 0.22 mA/cm2 (reduced from 3.21 to 2.99 mA/cm2) which resulted in a reduction of efficiency (0.085%). This phenomenon is due to the number of growing defects generated from the lattice mismatch between Zn-CIS and ZnS. These new defects could be the source of nonradiative recombination sites within the ZnS shell, which leads to the capture of electrons from Zn-CIS and decreases the Jsc dramatically. To prove our hypothesis, HR-TEM was used to examine the internal structure of Zn-CIS@ZnS core-shell QDs. Fig. 9 shows the HRTEM image of Zn-CIS quantum dots (a) without ZnS coating and (b) with 2.5 monolayers of ZnS coating. For the 2.5 monolayers sample, the outer lattice fringes are slightly askew compared with the inner part, which may be suggestive of strain-induced mismatch in the crystal. Fig. 9(c) displays diffraction patterns of bare Zn-CIS nanoparticles and Zn-CIS particles with a coating of 2.5 monolayers of ZnS. A strong influence of the ZnS shell on the diffraction is revealed where the XRD pattern is dominated by the nanocrystals in the presence of 2.5 monolayers of ZnS coverage compared with bare nanoparticles. The difference in the first broad diffraction peak between spectra (a) and (b) in Fig. 9(c) suggests a possible change in orientation between the core and shell. Similar studies and analysis were reported for CdSe/ZnS core/shell structures.12a,17 The increased Voc was due to a widened band-gap that originated from the presence of the ZnS shell, which has been reported earlier using a PbS sensitized nanocrystalline.18 Moreover, taking advantage of the energetic bands between the Zn-CIS core and ZnS shell, the higher conduction edge of ZnS than that of Zn-CIS QDs prevents the leakage of current from Zn-CIS to the electrolyte, causing more electrons to be injected into the ZnO nanowire and consequently increasing both Jsc and Voc.

            High-resolution transmission electron micrographs of (a) one “bare” Zn-CIS nanocrystallite and (b) one Zn-CIS nanocrystallite with a 2.5 monolayer ZnS shell. (c) Corresponding XRD patterns for (a) Zn-CIS nanocrystals and (b) ZnS-coated Zn-CIS. Standard data for ZnS (top inset, vertical bars, JCPDS card No. 05-0566) and CuInS2 (bottom inset, vertical bars, JCPDS card No. 75-0106) are shown for comparison. 
The current solar cell device with 5 µm short ZnO nanowires has reached a power-conversion efficiency as high as 0.71% through the use of a novel core-shell design. Upon normalizing those technical data in terms of the length of the ZnO nanowires, the average current density is 0.342 mA/cm2 per µm length and increases to 0.642 mA/cm2 per µm length after the coating, enhanced by as much as 1.88 times. Furthermore, this finding strongly implies that an efficiency enhancement can be achievable if a maximal coverage and attachment of the Zn-CIS QDs on the ZnO nanowire can be achieved, and more than that, incorporation of the novel Zn-CIS@ZnS core-shell QDs further boosts the efficiency to a considerable extent which is highly desirable for photovoltaic uses.
Concluding remarks
The charge transfer from Zn-CIS or Zn-CIS/ZnS core/shell QDs into ZnO nanowires by combining spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical techniques was investigated. The photoconversion efficiency of Zn-CIS QD-based solar cells was readily tuned by controlling the Cu/Zn ratio. Increase in Zn doping increases the Voc of the Zn-CIS QD-anchored ZnO nanowire electrode device. Lower Cu/Zn (n = 1) ratio gives greater Voc and FF but insufficient absorption in the visible region. Higher Cu/Zn ratio (n = 3) showed better absorption in the visible region but caused sluggish electron injection into ZnO nanowires as effectively as that of lower-ratio Cu/Zn QDs. A maximum power-conversion efficiency (0.28%) with Cu/Zn ratio QDs of n = 2 was detected. However, a significantly improved power-conversion performance to as high as 0.71% was attained when a thin ZnS shell of optimal thickness was deposited on these Zn-CIS QDs.
Experimental
Materials

          Diethyldithiocarbamic acid zinc salt ([(C2H5)2NCSS]2Zn, technical grade), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), methenamine (C6H12N4), copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 95%, analytical reagent), indium(III) chloride (InCl3, 98%, AR), sulfur powder (99.5%, chemically pure), zinc stearate (10–12% Zn, technical), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 90%, technical grade), and mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp.; octadecene (ODE, 90%, technical grade) and oleylamine (70%, technical grade) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.
Synthesis of ZnO nanowires
The ZnO thin films were deposited on F-doped SnO2 (FTO, 30 Ω/sq, Sinonar, Taiwan) substrates by RF magnetron sputtering following our previous report.4a The seeded substrates were then suspended horizontally in a reagent solution containing 0.016 M zinc nitrate and 0.025 M methenamine and heated to 95°C to initiate nanowire growth.
Synthesis of Zn-CIS QDs
The Zn-CIS QDs were prepared using a high-temperature organic solvent process. 0.5 mmol diethyldithiocarbamic acid zinc salt was dissolved in 6 ml TOP. The solution was diluted with 24 ml ODE to form a clear solution (solution 1). Then, 0.2 mmol CuCl and InCl3 were dissolved in 6 ml oleylamine at 50 °C to form another solution (solution 2). Here, amine coordinates the Cu and In ions to produce amine complexes. These two solutions were mixed to produce a raw material solution with a ratio Zn:Cu:In:S = 1:n:n:4 (n = 1 in this composition), the composition ratios of Cu and In were varied from 1 to 3. Those of Zn and S precursors were fixed in concentration, indicated as Zn:Cu:In:S = 1:n:n:4 (n = 1–3). A small aliquot of raw material solution was put into a test tube and soaked directly in an oil bath that had been preheated to 240 °C and aged for 300s. The prepared solutions were limpid, reflecting their high colloidal stability.
ZnS coating of Zn-CIS QDs
A colloidal solution of ca. 20 mg of Zn-CIS nanocrystals with an average diameter of 3.6 nm in 4 ml of toluene was placed in a three-neck flask under purified argon flow. After addition of 2.5 ml of TOPO, the mixture was heated to 190 °C and then kept at this temperature till complete heptane evaporation. Zinc stearate (316 mg) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of toluene upon gentle heating (ca. 60 °C). After cooling to room temperature, the resulting 0.2 M solution was mixed with 2.5 ml of a 0.2 M solution of Se in TOP. By means of a syringe pump this mixture was injected within 1 h into the reaction flask containing the core nanocrystals at 190–200 °C. Periodically small aliquots were removed in order to monitor the shell growth. After the addition was completed the crystals are annealed at 190 °C for an additional 1–1.5 h.
Synthesis of hydrophilic QDs by ligand exchange
Purified QDs were dissolved in a minimum amount of chloroform and excess mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was added until the solution became cloudy, and stirred at 55 °C for one night in argon atmosphere. After that, 1ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added to stop the surface exchange reaction. After cooling to room temperature, a suspension of potassium tert-butoxide in THF was added to neutralize the carboxyl acid function, and then centrifuged to remove the by-products with THF. The THF washing process was repeated 2–3 times, and finally distilled water was added to disperse hydrophilized Zn-CIS NCs into water.
Assembling Zn-CIS QDs on ZnO nanowires
The ZnO plate was fired at 450 °C for 30 minutes and then after cooling in air for 5 minutes it was transferred to Zn-CIS solution and left for 3 days to ensure saturated adsorption of Zn-CIS QD onto the ZnO nanowires.
Fabrication of solar cells
For characterization of the photovoltaic performance of our devices, the Zn-CIS/ZnO films served as working electrode (anode); fluorine doped tin oxide glass (typical size 1.0 × 2.0 cm2) coated with platinum (Pt) particles by sputtering was used as a counter electrode (cathode). The two electrodes were assembled into a cell of sandwich type and sealed with a hot-melt film (SX1170, Solaronix, thickness 25 µm); a thin layer of electrolyte was introduced into the space between the two electrodes and the device was fabricated accordingly. A typical redox electrolyte contained 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.01 M iodine (I2), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.6 M butyl methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocynate (GuNCS) in a mixture of acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.9%) and valeronitrile (n-C4H9CN, 99.9%) (v/v = 15/1).
Optical and electrochemical measurements

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a M18XHF diffractometer (MAC Science, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) (40kV, 200 mA). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using a field emission Auger electron microprobe (Thermo VG Microlab 350) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using an Mg Kα X-ray as the excitation source. Then UV-vis, PL emission, and excitation (PLE) spectroscopy were applied using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-1600; Agilent 8453) and a spectrofluorometer (FP-6600; Jasco, Inc., Japan). The amounts of Zn-CIS absorbed on the ZnO films were measured with a UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer (JASCO V-570) equipped with an integrating sphere (JASCO ISN-470). Measurements of I–V curves were made with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400, computer-controlled) with the device under one-solar AM 1.5 irradiation of a solar simulator (Newport-Oriel 91160) calibrated with a Si-based reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133) and a IR-cut filter (KG5) to correct the spectral mismatch of the lamp. The Zn-CIS/ZnO devices were operated in a back-side illumination fashion with the transparent counter electrode masked by a black plastic tape of the same size with a round hole to allow the actively illuminated area of 0.28 cm2 for all measurements. Time-resolved measurements were performed with a tunable nanosecond optical-parametric-oscillator/Q-switch-pumped neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser system NT341/1/UV, Ekspla. Emission transients were collected with a monochromator SpectraPro-300i, ARC, detected with a photomultiplier tube R928HA, Hamamatsu, connected to a digital oscilloscope LT372, LeCroy, and transferred to a computer for kinetic analysis.
