    , Accepted 16th April 2013First published on 17th April 2013AbstractThere is intense interest in developing new novel nanostructured photoanodes for water splitting. It is therefore important that methods to analyze the effect of nanostructuring on water splitting yields are developed in order to rationalize the relative merits of this approach for different materials. In this study the dependence of charge separation efficiency (ηsep) on potential during photoelectrochemical water splitting at pH 2 has been quantified in a model electrode system (nanocrystalline, mesoporous TiO2) using two independent methods. These are (i) analysis of incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements and (ii) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy measurements. The techniques provide good agreement with each other and show that a low maximum value of ηsep (∼0.18) is the primary cause of the low IPCE for water oxidation on these nc-TiO2 electrodes.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is receiving significant interest as it offers a potential route to sustainably produce hydrogen using solar energy and water.1,2 Numerous studies have addressed both the development of new semiconductor materials and architectures of existing materials to achieve enhanced photo-activity.3–6 Particular attention is being paid to the development of nanostructured photoelectrodes for water splitting as a route to achieving efficient light harvesting. In a nanostructured photoanode, it is possible to generate a high concentration of electron–hole pairs in close proximity to the semiconductor liquid junction (SCLJ).6 This offers a significant advantage in materials with short hole diffusion lengths, as the distance that the photohole is required to travel prior to transfer into solution is reduced. Furthermore the use of highly structured photoanodes decreases the requirements of any co-catalysts that are employed as lower turnover frequencies are required per catalytic site/unit area to keep up with the solar flux in a high surface area material.6,7
For bulk electrodes, most studies in PEC cells are interpreted within the context of a model developed by Gartner8 and Gerischer,9,10 in which photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the semiconductor are separated by an electric field, i.e. a depletion layer close to the SCLJ. By calculating the minority charge carrier concentration in the bulk semiconductor, from the diffusion equation and neglecting recombination within the depletion layer, Gärtner derived an expression which successfully describes the photocurrent density as a function of applied potential for bulk electrodes.8 However, in nanoporous electrodes with high dielectric constants, such as TiO2 (εr ∼ 80–130), the particle dimensions are less than the depletion layer depth, preventing the development of significant electric fields within the semiconductor.11,12 For example in a nc-TiO2 film of 16 nm diameter particles the difference in the voltage between the surface and center has been calculated to be ∼0.3 mV under conditions of maximum depletion for a carrier density of 1017 cm−3.11 Even accounting for electron trap state densities commonly observed in these films (1019 cm−3) the voltage drop across a particle (∼20 mV) is still less than the thermal potential of an electron at room temperature.13 The absence of a significant depletion layer in nanostructured electrodes prevents us from neglecting recombination in regions close to the SCLJ and requires the development of modified models to aid the rationalization of device efficiency. It is therefore important to accurately evaluate the effect that the loss of a significant electric field may have on charge separation yields due to increased electron–hole recombination as it may mitigate the advantage of nanostructuring in some materials. Herein we report two measurements of the bias dependent charge separation yield in a nanostructured TiO2 photoanode obtained by independent methods. TiO2 is a very widely studied photocatalyst making it an excellent model material to study the effect of nanostructuring on photocatalytic activity.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) is one of the most widely quoted and important diagnostic figures of merit for photoelectrochemical devices. In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC's), an analogous device typically based on nanostructured TiO2, the IPCE (denoted as ηIPCE) can be divided into three components, which are thought to be independent, enabling the origin of photocurrent loss to be examined.14–16 In an equivalent analysis of a PEC cell these three factors are: (1) the efficiency of photon harvesting by photoelectrodes, ηLH, (2) the efficiency of generation of spatially separated charges, ηsep, which in the water splitting cells studied we define as the yield of holes that survive localized electron–hole recombination prior to transfer across the TiO2/electrolyte interface and (3) the efficiency of charge (electron) collection from the photoanode matrix to the external circuit during transport, including losses from recombination with intermediates (indirect electron–hole recombination) and products, ηcol, such that14–16 (1)where jst is steady-state photocurrent, q is the elementary charge, φ(λ) is the photon flux density at wavelength λ incident on the cell and APCE the absorbed photon to current efficiency. This division assumes that the counter electrode is not limiting current flowing through the circuit, which is which is reasonable when considering the 3 electrode systems typically reported in literature. The competing processes controlling ηcol in a water splitting photoanode can be described in the simplest case by the diffusion length of the electron, Ln which is defined as the average displacement of an electron before loss to solution or to recombination.10,17 Sodergren et al.10 derived expressions for the action spectra and the current–voltage behavior for colloidal semiconductor films under illumination assuming linear recombination of electrons, which was first applied to dye sensitized cells by Lindstrom et al.18 and most recently by Halme et al.14 and Barnes et al.15,19 Electron transport properties in nanostructured semiconductor electrodes have also been studied both in aqueous20,21 and non-aqueous solutions22,23 and this work builds upon a previous report by some of us that used an IPCE analysis method to measure Ln ∼ 8.5–12 μm for nc-TiO2 electrodes of the type studied here during water oxidation.17 For a nc-TiO2 photoanode the light harvesting (ηLH) is dependent on the absorption spectrum of nc-TiO2 film and its thickness and is readily measured. To date the efficiency and dynamics of charge separation has received less attention in studies of PEC water splitting than in DSSCs. Here we analyze the IPCE data to report both the bias and film thickness dependence of ηsep in nc-TiO2 films with small feature sizes (∼15 nm). This analysis shows that the low ηsep is the primary cause of the low quantum yields for water splitting on the nc-TiO2 electrode under UV illumination. To further explore the factors controlling ηsep and to test the validity of our IPCE analyses measurements we have also used transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to study the electron–hole dynamics and measure ηsep in the same nc-TiO2 photoanode.
TA spectroscopy has been shown to be a useful tool for the study of water splitting photoanodes, providing kinetic details on photogenerated charge carriers in a range nanostructured electrodes including α-Fe2O3, TiO2 and WO3.24–30 Knowledge of the relevant charge carrier extinction coefficients also enables the magnitudes of the different kinetic processes to be measured which would provide a complete model of the fundamental parameters controlling photocatalytic activity, however extinction coefficients are not commonly reported in studies of PEC cells. Concerns also persist regarding the ability of TA to provide meaningful data that can be directly related to a PEC cell operating under realistic conditions as the pulsed nature of the excitation source can lead to unrealistic distribution of surface intermediates and most significantly peak excitation powers that are much higher than those achieved under solar flux.30,31 High peak powers due to excitation with short, intense (ps–ns) laser pulses have been shown to lead to high initial charge carrier concentrations and sub nanosecond recombination yields on the order of 90% have been previously reported following laser excitation of nc-TiO2 electrodes.32,33 The good agreement between the values of ηsep obtained by IPCE and TA methods in this study demonstrates that through judicious choice of experimental conditions it is possible to carry out TA experiments that are directly relevant to photoanodes operating under CW illumination providing important insights on a model nanostructured electrode.
Experimental detail
2.1 TiO2 film preparation
A TiO2 colloid paste (12.5 wt% anatase TiO2 particles and 6.2 wt% Carbowax 20000) was prepared as previously described to produce TiO2 particles with an average diameter of 15 nm.34 nc-TiO2 films were prepared on conductive fluorine doped glass (FTO, TEC-15, Hartford glass) by the doctor blade method as previously described, using either scotch tape as a spacer or for thin (<4 μm) films a k-bar (RK print instruments).17 The film thickness was measured using a profilometer (Alpha-Step 200, Tencor Instruments).
2.2 IPCE measurement
IPCE experiments were performed in a photoelectrochemical cell with two quartz windows using a 75 W Xe lamp (Ushio, with PTI® stabilized current power supply) as the illumination source coupled a monochromator (MD-1000, 1200 g mm−1 blaze 400 nm, Optical Building Blocks Corp, Birmingham). The working electrode was the nc-TiO2 electrode (illumination area 0.6 × 0.6 cm2), illuminated from the substrate-electrode (SE) side to minimize collection losses, thus allowing us to focus on the variation in charge separation losses. The cell also contains a platinum gauze (99.9%) counter electrode and a 3 M KCl Ag/AgCl reference electrode (SSE, Bioanalytical Systems Ltd.) and all potentials are quoted versus this. The electrolyte was 0.5 M NaClO4 (Aldrich) adjusted to pH 2 by HClO4 (99.999%, Aldrich) prepared with Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25 °C). TiO2 samples were UV (150 W Xe lamp) cleaned prior to experiments for a minimum of 20 minutes in electrolyte. The electrolyte was then replaced following cleaning and oxygen-free nitrogen gas was bubbled at least 30 minutes through the electrolyte before and during the experiments. The intensity of the incident light was measured with an optical power meter (PM120V, Thorlabs) equipped with a UV sensor (model S120UV, Thorlabs). Applied potentials were controlled by a commercial computer-controlled potentiostat (Autolab 12). The preset potential was applied for at least 1 min before illumination. The photocurrent, defined as difference in current between illuminated and dark conditions, was selected after illumination for 1 min when a stable current was achieved. Electron density measurements at defined potentials were determined through charge extraction experiments in the manner previously reported.17
2.3 Transient measurements
The TA measurement has been described in a previously report.24,31 Briefly, the third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite I-10, 355 nm, 4–6 ns pulse width) operating at 0.33 Hz is the UV excitation source in TA experiments. The repetition rate is chosen to ensure that all charge carriers had fully decayed prior to the next excitation event. The laser intensities reported in this paper are those incident on the nc-TiO2 sample and have been corrected for losses from the cell and conductive glass substrate. Transient photovoltage measurements were recorded using a Textronix TDS 220 oscilloscope. The steady state photovoltage in the open circuit (TPV) measurement was tuned by controlling the bias light intensity using UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, OTLH-0480-UV, 365 ± 10 nm, Opto Technology, Inc).
Results

Fig. 1(a) shows current–voltage plots for a 1.1 μm nc-TiO2 photoelectrode in 0.5 M NaClO4 (pH 2) illuminated through the substrate (SE) by 355 nm light. In these experiments the anodic photocurrent is assigned to the oxidation of water on the nc-TiO2 electrodes.35,36 Two well-defined regions are observed under illumination (355 nm), at applied potentials of less than −0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) the photocurrent is strongly dependent upon the applied potential. At potentials greater than −0.05 V the photocurrent is independent of the applied potential. In compact electrodes of low porosity IPCE yields of 0.3–0.6 are commonly achieved under UV illumination in contrast to the modest maximum IPCE's (∼0.05) observed here, Fig. 1(b).37,38

The light harvesting efficiency of an nc-TiO2 electrode is independent of the potential applied (in the region studied) and is readily measured by UV/Vis spectroscopy, Fig. S1 (ESI†), (1.1 μm nc-TiO2, ηLH, 355nm = 0.35). It has recently been shown that the ηcol is not strongly dependent on the applied potential and that the electron diffusion length is significantly greater than the film thickness used here L ∼ 8.5–12 μm,17 therefore we approximate ηcol ∼ 1 for our 1.1 μm film. From eqn (1) a plot of ηsepversus applied bias is made, Fig. 1(b). The very low charge separation yields (ηsep ∼ 0.13 at 0.06 V) for the nc-TiO2 electrode is clearly a significant factor in the low IPCE compared to literature values for bulk electrodes.37,38 In addition to studying the bias dependence of ηsep, we have also used a similar analysis of IPCE measurements to examine the role of nc-TiO2 film thickness (d) on APCE (ηsep × ηcol), Fig. S2 (ESI†), which indicates that a low charge separation yield is a common feature of all the nanostructured photoelectrodes studied and the factors controlling the charge separation yield are further examined in the following section.
To provide an insight into the dynamics of the charge carriers which are leading to the low charge separation yields and in order to confirm the validity of the IPCE analysis, we have monitored an identical 1.1 μm nc-TiO2 film in a PEC cell using TA spectroscopy. To obtain quantitative information from TA experiments it is necessary to measure the extinction coefficients of the charge carriers in nc-TiO2. Numerous studies have examined the charge carrier absorption spectra of similar nc-TiO2 films and it has been shown that within 500 ps of excitation relaxation into trap states occurs30 and that photoelectrons and photoholes can be monitored on the nanosecond and slower timescales in nc-TiO2 at 900 and 460 nm respectively, at pH 2.31,39,40 The electron extinction coefficient on a nc-TiO2 film (0.5 M NaClO4, pH 2) at 900 nm has been measured by spectroelectrochemical methods to be 2440 M−1 cm−1Fig. 2(a). Electron extinction coefficients in TiO2 have previously been reported to range from 800–2600 M−1 cm−1 (in the region of 700–800 nm), with significant dependencies on electrolyte, conditions and material preparation methods (like porosity) and our value at 900 nm, which takes into account the sample porosity (∼50%), is on the order of these previous reports.41–43 It has been proposed that the electron extinction coefficient will show a dependence on the electron concentration however in the potential regions examined we observe a very good linear correlation between the change at 900 nm absorption versus the change in electron density measured by charge extraction,13 in agreement with recent observations by Berger and Anta.44 The accuracy of the measured extinction coefficient is also confirmed by the use of the measured extinction coefficient to map TA data onto transient photovoltage responses, in experiments described in the ESI,† Fig. S4.
 Fig. 2  (a) Spectroelectrochemical response at 900 nm of a 4 μm nc-TiO2 film in 0.5 M NaClO4 pH 2, the electron densities used in Fig. 2 are obtained from charge extraction measurements, Fig. S3 (ESI†) (b) TA decay trace of the photoelectron (900 nm) and hole (460 nm) recorded under open circuit conditions (−310 mV) in nitrogen purged 0.5 M NaClO4 (aq, pH 2) following 355 nm excitation (35 μJ cm−2) of a 1.1 μm nc-TiO2 film. The traces are normalised by the scaling factor highlighted. 
The photohole signal recorded at 460 nm (0.5 M NaClO4, pH 2, N2 purged) decays at the rate of the electron TA signal at 900 nm under open circuit conditions, indicating that electron–hole recombination is the only significant process occurring, Fig. 2(b). The lack of significant residual absorptions at 460 and 900 nm beyond 100 ms demonstrates that recombination is complete and that the concentration of holes equals the concentration of photoelectrons in this experiment. We therefore can estimate the photohole extinction coefficient at 460 nm ∼ 2930 M−1 cm−1, based upon a ratio of 1.2:1 for the TA signal magnitude (460:900 nm). This assumes that there is no significant overlap of the photoelectron absorption with the photohole absorption at 460 nm, which is supported by our previous studies24,31 and a detailed report on charge carrier spectra in similar nc-TiO2 films at pH 2 by the group of Katoh et al.40
The dynamics of the photoholes (460 nm) following the UV excitation (355 nm, 35 μJ cm−2) of a nc-TiO2 electrode in 0.5 M NaClO4 (pH 2) in a complete PEC cell at a range of different applied potentials are shown in Fig. 3(a). The data is also plotted as a fractional yield of photoholes ([h+]t/[h+]t=0) through use of the measured extinction coefficient and the known light harvesting properties of the electrode, Fig. S1 (ESI†). The photohole decay is strongly dependent on the applied bias and is well fitted to a minimum of two stretched exponential functions (y = A1e(−t/τ1)b1 + A2e(−t/τ2)b2), Fig. 3(b). In agreement with our previous reports on a nc-TiO2 water splitting cell24 at pH 12.6 we assign the fast component,¶ which has a lifetime that is in agreement with the electron decay on this timescale (Fig. S5, ESI†), to electron–hole recombination. The magnitude of the hole signal at the earliest timescales studied (10 μs) increases with potential between −0.185 and −0.060 V due to a decrease in electron–hole recombination in the positively biased films at times that are faster than measured in these experiments. The magnitude of the slow component of the fit also increases with potential between −0.185 and −0.060 V. At potentials greater than −0.060 V no significant changes in the TA signal of the holes are observed, which is in agreement with the observed plateau of the photocurrent at potentials greater than −0.060 V. The formation of long-lived holes is known to be a prerequisite for water splitting and we have previously reported that hole lifetimes of ∼0.3 s and ∼30 ms was required for water splitting to occur in a neutral31 and alkaline solution24 respectively. Individual fitting of the hole decay traces obtained at 0, −0.060 and −0.120 V vs. Ag/AgCl provide a common lifetime of 0.4 ± 0.1 s for the slow component which is assigned to a hole transfer from the nc-TiO2 in the oxidation of water (pH 2). The magnitude of the slow kinetic component represents the concentration of holes that have survived local electron–hole recombination and provides a direct measure of the charge separation yield as defined for eqn (1). A global fit of the hole decay traces gives the variation of ηsep with applied bias, as measured by TA spectroscopy, Fig. 4. The good agreement between the ηsep yields obtained independently by IPCE and TA measurements supports the validity of both approaches. In both experiments the charge separation yield is seen to increase with applied potential from −0.185 to −0.06 V prior to plateauing at potentials greater than −0.06 V, mirroring the changes observed in the IPCE yields, Fig. 1(b). In addition, our determinations of the absolute magnitudes of ηsep are in reasonable agreement, consistent with our conclusion above that the yield of photocurrent generation is primarily limited by the efficiency of charge separation.

All traces are recorded following the UV excitation (355 nm, 35 μJ cm−2, SE) of nc-TiO2 (1.1 μm) in 0.5 M NaClO4(aq) (pH 2) and potentials are reported vs. Ag/AgCl.

Discussion
The low charge separation yields for the nc-TiO2 photoanodes studied are the primary cause of the low IPCE values. The morphology of the nc-TiO2 films has been documented in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and elsewhere previously.46 The highly porous structure (porosity ∼ 0.5) and the small particle size which is similar to the crystal size47 (∼15 nm diameter in this study) leads to a lack of a significant electric field.11,13 This is a critical factor in the low charge separation yields. In contrast electron–hole pairs generated in the depletion zone of bulk photoanodes are rapidly spatially separated by the electric field with a high yield and APCE's are typically much higher than those achieved here.38 The nanostructured electrodes also contain a significant concentration of electronic trapping sites which were proposed to be primarily located at grain boundaries in rutile nanoparticles.48 However recent studies on films with the same morphology but different crystal size showed that the trap density was relatively independent of the density of grain boundaries, suggesting that the morphological dimensions, not grain boundaries, primarily determine the trap density.49 Electron trapping is known to have a significant influence on the rate of electron transport nanocrystalline anatase films.13,17 In nanostructured photoanodes where both electrons and holes are present it is possible that the grain boundaries or traps are also acting as recombination centers, which could potentially contribute to increased losses in the nanostructured electrodes.50
In addition to providing a measure of the ηsep, our TA experiments can provide important quantitative information on the processes controlling the efficiency of charge separation (rates and yields of electron–hole recombination and hole transfer into solution) allowing for the development of suitable kinetic models. This work, and previous studies,31 have shown that photoholes (in the concentration regimes studied here) with a lifetime of ∼0.4 s are required for water oxidation on nc-TiO2 in acidic or neutral conditions. Fig. 3 shows that as the positive potential is increased from −0.185 to 0 V we see a significant increase in the yield of holes still present in the film at 10 μs with ∼39% (−0.185 V) to ∼56% (0 V) of the initially generated photoholes remaining in the nc-TiO2 film, indicating that the positive bias significantly decreases the level of fast (sub-microsecond) recombination. By 10 ms the yield of long lived hole is ∼17% (0 V) compared to <5% (−0.185 V). The decrease in the level of recombination and increase in yield of long-lived holes in positively biased films is in agreement with our previous, non-quantitative study on thicker nc-TiO2 films in alkali electrolytes.24 Lowering the background electron density of the nc-TiO2 film (primarily localized in intraband trap states) with a positive bias, decreases the rate of electron–hole recombination and increases the yield of long lived holes. In charge extraction experiments (Fig. S3, ESI†) we are able to measure the large decrease in background electron density in the nc-TiO2 film when the potential is changed between −0.185 and −0.06 V. Our observation that both the yield of long lived holes, and the photocurrent density plateaus for biases >−0.06 V is consistent with a system where further changes to the applied bias is having a limited effect upon the residual background electron density, (Fig. S3, ESI†). Under such conditions the density of photogenerated electrons exceeds the background electron density and electron–hole recombination is dominated by the direct recombination of photogenerated electrons with photogenerated holes.
It is also important to develop general methodologies to assess the role of nanostructuring on the fundamental parameters controlling electrode efficiency so that other semiconductor photoanode materials can be assessed. Here we employed two distinct routes to rationalize the observed IPCE yields and to obtain ηsep in a model nc-TiO2 electrode. Although the splitting of the IPCE into 3 independent factors as described in eqn (1) is a common approach for DSSC's it is not widely employed in studies of photoelectrochemical water splitting cells, despite the potential of this analysis to guide material modification. Such factoring requires knowledge of ηcol for each material and morphology. In a previous study some of us reported IPCE and pulsed electrochemical measurements that are achievable at a low cost to obtain the variation of ηcol with film thickness for homogenous nano-morphologies.17 As ηLH can be readily measured it is then possible to report the bias dependence of ηsep directly from IPCE measurements with minimal assumptions. The use of TA spectroscopy offers a direct, albeit more experimentally complex, approach to measuring ηsep and importantly it also provides information on the kinetics controlling the measured yields. A significant concern with previous TA kinetic studies has also been the reported high levels of electron–hole recombination on the sub-nanosecond timescale30,32,33 which would suggest that the kinetic models developed from such transient measurements may be of limited use to rationalizing a PEC cell operating under CW illumination as recombination yields will be over-estimated. It is clear that when interpreting kinetic and mechanistic data from transient measurements of PEC cells, including those employing electrochemical, or optical perturbations, care should be taken as it is possible to develop concentrations of intermediates which are non-representative of an operational device. However through the use of weak (μJ cm−2, ∼5 ns pulsewidth) excitation densities a relatively good, quantitative, agreement between the TA and IPCE measured bias dependence of ηsep is achieved. We do observe some small discrepancies in ηsep in Fig. 4 and these are likely to come from two main sources (i) errors arising from the fitting of the weak TA signal and in calculating the charge carrier extinction coefficients and (ii) a difference in surface intermediate and charge carrier concentrations in the two experiments. However this result demonstrates that through careful control of the experimental conditions it is possible to obtain data from TA experiments that can help rationalize IPCE measurements of nanostructured photoanodes under CW illumination.
Conclusions
IPCE yields are commonly reported within the literature as a figure of merit for water splitting photoactivity. Here we have analyzed IPCE measurements and carried out TA experiments on model nc-TiO2 photoanodes to examine the cause of the low efficiency of these nanostructured materials. In all cases high levels of localized electron–hole recombination in these model materials leads to low charge separation yields, even in the photocurrent plateau region. It is important that methods to measure the variation of charge separation with applied potential are developed as there is increasing interest in novel nanostructured photoanodes to obtain efficient light harvesting, however the effect of this on electron–hole recombination rates is not typically clear and in some cases the disadvantages of nanostructuring may outweigh the advantages.

¶ At higher laser intensities we have previously observed a power law type decay for electron–hole recombination in a positively biased nc-TiO2 film at pH 12.6.24 In this study at pH 2 we find that although the early timescale data can be reasonably fitted to a power law decay it is best approximated to a stretched exponential decay function in agreement with models commonly employed for nc-TiO2 electron dynamics in dye sensitized cells.45
