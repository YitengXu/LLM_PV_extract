    , Accepted 9th April 2020First published on 13th April 2020AbstractPseudo-octahedral iron complexes supported by tridentate N^N^N-binding, redox ‘non-innocent’ diiminepyridine (DIP) ligands exhibit multiple reversible ligand-based reductions that suggest the potential application of these complexes as anolytes in redox flow batteries (RFBs). When bearing aryl groups at the imine nitrogens, substitution at the 4-position can be used to tune these redox potentials and impact other properties relevant to RFB applications, such as solubility and stability over extended cycling. DIP ligands bearing electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) in this position, however, can be challenging to isolate via typical condensation routes involving para-substituted anilines and 2,6-diacetylpyridine. In this work, we demonstrate a high-yielding Zn-templated synthesis of DIP ligands bearing strong EWGs. The synthesis and electrochemical characterization of iron(II) complexes of these ligands is also described, along with properties relevant to their potential application as RFB anolytes.
Introduction
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have received renewed attention of late owing to their potential for the scalable, inexpensive storage of the growing proportion of power generation devoted to renewable but intermittent resources such as wind and solar.1 In an RFB, electrical energy is converted to chemical energy through the electrochemical interconversion of redox pairs serving as the electrolyte.2 The key contrast with conventional batteries is that these redox pairs can be spatially separated from the electrode.3 If both oxidized and reduced members of the pairs are stable and soluble in the flow battery medium, scalability will depend in part on the abundance of the materials employed as catholyte/anolyte, and to a more significant extent than on that of the electrode material.4 With respect to the solvent medium, nonaqueous solvents with wider windows of electrochemical stability can boost the energy density output of an RFB compared to water,5 though their cost-competitiveness with aqueous RFBs has been questioned.6 The increased solubility of many metal coordination complexes (MCCs) in organic solvents, however, does mean a larger library of candidate anolytes and catholytes based on MCCs is available (Fig. 1).7
 Fig. 1  Selected examples of metal coordination complexes (MCCs) that have been evaluated for use in non-aqueous redox flow batteries.6A: M(acac)3, M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru; acac = acetylacetonate. B: M(bpy)3n+, M = Ru, Fe, Ni, Cr, Co; bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine. C: M(BPI)2, M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn; BPI = (bipyridylimino)isoindoline. D: M(DIP)2n+, M = Fe; DIP = 2,6-diiminepyridine. 
While simple coordination complexes (e.g., A; acac = acetylacetonate) exhibit reversible reductions and oxidations that can enable use as both anolyte and catholyte in symmetric RFBs,8 the introduction of redox ‘non-innocent’ ligands9,10 can in principle augment the performance of MCCs in RFBs11 by providing additional sites for electron-transfer. MCCs of redox non-innocent 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy; B)12 and (bipyridylimino)isoindoline (BPI; C)13 ligands, for example, have been shown to have properties favourable to RFB applications including (for BPI MCCs) multiple electron transfers per molecule, high solubility, and long-term stability towards charge/discharge cycles (∼200) with very little capacity fade.13 For comparison, one of the more commercially promising systems is the all-vanadium flow battery, which utilizes four different oxidation state vanadium and oxyvanadium ions and shows very impressive long-term cyclability of over 1000 stable cycles.14 The high system costs comprised to a large extent of the cost of the redox-active material, however, still far exceed the U.S. Department of Energy's target.15
In this context, we have been interested in the application of iron coordination complexes of a popular class of redox non-innocent scaffold, 2,6-diiminepyridines (DIP),16 which are able to accommodate up to three additional electrons in s-,17 f-18 and d-block19 metal complexes of triply reduced DIPs. Pseudo-octahedral iron complexes of N-aryl DIPs bearing electron-releasing substituents (D, R = tBu or OMe, M = Fe, n = 2), for example, exhibit good solubility (0.1–0.3 M) in CH3CN and two reversible reductions at negative potentials beyond the water voltage window.16 Such molecular geometries also make use of tridentate DIP chelation which limits ligand dissociation and promotes higher cyclability compared to bidentate ligand environments; 2,6-unsubstituted aryl groups similarly reduce ligand hemilability associated with steric congestion.20 We have also found that, in addition to the position of the reduction potentials, the solubility and stability towards cycling were also impacted by the identity of the substituent in the 4-position of N-phenyl rings. Complexes of DIP ligands bearing tBu substituents showed improved capacity retention attributed to enhanced solubility of both reduced and oxidized species.16 As tBu and OMe are both electron-releasing, we thought to explore the impact electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) might have on reduction potentials and cycling stability in the context of RFB anolytes.
Installation of para-EWGs on the flanking aryl substituents in DIP frameworks, however, is potentially more problematic than electron-donating groups (EDGs). DIPs are typically prepared by condensation of 2,6-diacetylpyridine and the corresponding anilines. Substitution of anilines in the 4-position with EWGs can significantly reduce their nucleophilicity, hampering conversion.21 For example, condensation syntheses of (para-fluoro)phenyl and (para-bromo)phenyl-substituted DIPs are reported to give isolated yields of only 24% and 41%, respectively, despite azeotropic removal of water.21 Furthermore, the para-nitro analogue could only be isolated, and in similarly low yields, following a five day, acid-catalyzed Dean–Stark reflux in high-boiling p-xylene.22 In seeking to overcome these challenges, we considered a report on the inclusion of EWGs on ArBIAN-type diimine ligands via a Zn-templated synthesis (ArBIAN = bis (aryl)acenaphthenequinonediimine).23 Here, we describe the application of this approach to the synthesis of DIP ligands with strong EWGs in relatively high yields under mild conditions. This methodology opens the chemical space for the synthesis of DIP ligands that incorporate strong EWGs and so may be useful for the many applications where these ligands are utilized.24 We furthermore report on the electrochemical evaluation of properties of their pseudo-octahedral Fe(II) complexes which speak to potential use as anolytes in RFB applications.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of ligands and complexes
DIP proligand synthesis is generally accomplished by the acid-catalyzed condensation of 2,6-diacetylpyridine with two equivalents of the appropriately substituted aniline. To avoid forcing conditions required for appreciable conversion using anilines substituted in the 4-position with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs), we turned to templated synthesis. Templated ligand syntheses have long been used to overcome competing side reactions,25 but can also be used to drive to completion ligand formation reactions that would suffer from less favourable thermodynamics in the absence of coordination to a templating metal ion.26 The templated synthesis of imine-based ligands, for example, has enabled construction of complex scaffolds including chiral P^N^N and P^N^N^P multidentate architectures.27 In comparison, reports of demetallation and subsequent use of the liberated proligands appear far less often28 than the targeted assembly of coordination complexes templated by a metal ion of choice. For imines, attempts to demetallate can lead to ligand hydrolysis. In the case of ArBIAN ligands constructed around Zn2+ as a templating ion, using oxalate (C2O42−) as a displacing ligand produces insoluble ZnC2O4 and drives demetallation reactions to completion without evidence of hydrolysis.23
Four (DIP)ZnCl2 complexes (1a–d, Fig. 2) were prepared via the Zn2+-templated condensation of two equivalents of aniline with 2,6-diacetylpyridine, broadly following the protocol for incorporating strong EWGs in ArBIANs outlined by Ragaini.23 Complex 1a (R = H) has been previously reported.29 Each of 1a–d was prepared in this way by heating slightly more than two equivalents of the appropriate aniline (15% excess) with 2,6-diacetylpyridine and excess ZnCl2 in CH3OH (acetic acid for 1d). Unlike complexes based on the acenaphthoquinone (ArBIAN) backbone,23 using acetic acid as the solvent leads to full solubilization of the (DIP)ZnCl2 fluoro- and bromo-derivatives, but partial solubilization of the cyano-derivative. Changing the reaction solvent to methanol, the crude (DIP)ZnCl2 product precipitates as a yellow powder upon cooling to room temperature and can be filtered to easily separate 1a–c from excess reactants. The (DIP)ZnCl2 complexes can then be recrystallized by dissolving in hot acetonitrile, followed by slow cooling to −20 °C. 1H NMR spectra for 1a–d show a single, pseudo C2v-symmetric magnetic environment in solution for all four Zn complexes. Diagnostic resonances for the formation of the imine arms can also be observed by 13C{1H} NMR at δ = ∼165 ppm. The molecular formula for each compound was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS).
 Fig. 2  Synthesis of (a) (DIP)ZnCl2 complexes 1a–d; (b) free proligands 2a–dvia de-zincation, and [bis(DIP)2Fe][PF6]2 complexes 3a–d with isolated yields in parentheses. Complexes 3e (ref. 32) and 3f (ref. 16) have been previously reported. 
To confirm the structures of the (DIP)ZnCl2 complexes suggested by solution NMR and HR-MS, solid-state structures of 1b–d were also determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD; Fig. 3). In each case, a single DIP ligand is bound to Zn in a meridional, tridentate fashion and forms part of what is best described as a distorted square-based pyramid with τ5 values30 ranging from 0.30 (1c) to 0.40 (1d). This deviation from ideal geometry arises from different Npyr–Zn–Cl angles. The two chlorides cant asymmetrically away from the pyridine ring, opening one Npyr–Zn–Cl angle wider than the other. The relatively long Zn–Npyr and Zn–Nimine distances, typical of (N-heterocycle/imine)-Zn2+ coordination,31 are consistent across the series 1b–d at ∼2.08 Å and 2.21–2.26 Å, respectively. As a result, the Nimine–Zn–Nimine angles are quite pulled back (147–148°). The narrow range of bond distances and angles observed for the set of (DIP)ZnCl2 complexes is consistent with the distal placement of the R groups on the ligand periphery.

The free proligands (2a–d) can be displaced from the ZnCl2 unit and isolated in good to excellent yields (67–98%) by mixing dichloromethane solutions of 1a–d with aqueous solutions containing three equivalents of potassium oxalate, then extracting and drying the organic layer. Multinuclear NMR confirmed the molecular composition of the resulting off-white/yellow solids as demetallated ligand, with shifts observed to all signals including those attributed to the diagnostic imine carbon nuclei (δCN = ∼168 ppm). Iron MCCs 3a–d were subsequently prepared by reaction of the desired proligand with 0.5 equivalents of anhydrous FeCl2 and two equivalents of NaPF6 in CH3OH. These complexes were isolated as air- and moisture-stable, deep purple solids, with molecular formulae again confirmed by HR-MS. Multinuclear NMR suggests a symmetric environment around each Fe(II) centre with 13C resonances for the diagnostic imine carbon centers shifted considerably downfield to δCN ∼180 ppm. The most downfield resonance is observed for 3d (δCN = 182 ppm), consistent with 3d having the most deshielded imine carbon. The dark purple colour of 3a–d is reflected in strong and broad low energy features in the steady-state UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S37†). These transitions are assigned as MLCT in character, as is typical of [(DIP)2Fe]2+ complexes.16,32 Within the series, 3d showed a marked hypsochromic shift in the transitions observed beyond 400 nm, but otherwise, a similar absorption profile is observed for all four complexes. The pseudo-octahedral coordination environment around Fe was confirmed by XRD studies of 3c and 3d (Fig. 4). A much tighter coordination environment is seen for the Fe complexes compared with the Zn congeners (Tables S1 and S2†), with closer M–N distances ranging from 1.86–1.87 Å for Fe–Npyr and 1.96–2.00 Å for Fe–Nimine. As a result, the intraligand Nimine–Fe–Nimine angles are much larger at ∼160°.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV; Fig. 5 and Table 1) revealed identical redox behaviour for the series 3a–d, with two reversible 1e− reductions evident between −1.0 and −2.0 V and a 1e− oxidation observed near +1.0 V vs. FcH0/+ (FcH = ferrocene). Based on previous analysis of the redox behaviour of DIP complexes of Fe, we assign the cathodic events as ligand centered.32 The oxidation is attributed to a metal-centered Fe2+/3+ couple. Each of the three redox events observed for 3a–d are shifted anodically compared to those observed for [(DIP)Fe]2+ analogs bearing electron-releasing OMe (3e) or tBu (3f) substituents.16 This highlights the ability to tune redox potentials using distal substitution of the N-arene rings. In accordance with their Hammett parameters,33 the largest anodic shift is observed for R = CN, followed by R = Br and R = F, consistent with inductive removal of electron density from the imine-based LUMO. The reversibility of the ligand-based reductions observed by CV does not seem to be as adversely affected by the introduction of EWGs as the Fe2+/3+ couples, which are much more reversible for 3e–f likely as a result of occurring at less positive potentials.16 In particular, both cathodic events show peak current ratios near to unity and narrow peak-to-peak separations close to the Nernstian limit of 59 mV.34 Moreover, the potentials surpass the voltage limits of water (ca. −1.2 V vs. FcH0/+)35 and the multiple electron transfers possible with a single complex suggest the possibility of high energy storage capacity.13 We therefore proceeded to evaluate the suitability of 3a–d as RFB anolytes.

Charge/discharge measurements
Cycling measurements were performed on 3a–d using a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) working electrode in a bulk electrolysis cell to examine the viability of these compounds as RFB anolytes. The maximum cathodic potentials were set according to the CV/DPV collected for each compound to ensure capture of the second reversible redox event without going so far as to irreversibly reduce the complexes.16 The charge/discharge cycling experiments for 3a are shown in Fig. 6. While less pronounced than those observed for 3e–f,16 plateaus corresponding to the reduction events observed by CV/DPV can be discerned in the charging segment. In the discharge segment, two plateaus corresponding to the reverse oxidation events can similarly be noted (Fig. 6b). These decrease in prominence after extended cycling.

Voltage limits set according to previously obtained CVs in order to limit accessing irreversible redox events; in 0.3 M nBu4PF6 acetonitrile solution. Plateaus are marked by arrows. 
The cycling stability of RFB electrolytes is one of a number of parameters important for evaluating the potential for use in a commercial battery.36 Through 25 cycles, 3a exhibits a coulombic efficiency (% CE) of 95.2% (Fig. 6c), comparable to reported values for aqueous Li/I RFBs over 20 cycles,37 but passing an average of ∼1.9 electrons per molecule out of a theoretical maximum of 2 (Fig. 6d and Table 1). Zn–I flow batteries, in comparison have been reported to exhibit extended stability over 300 cycles, with a one-electron redox couple.38 In comparison to complexes bearing donating groups (3e–f),163a surpasses the faradaic efficiency (% FE) and number of electrons per molecule observed for 3e–f without any evidence of degradation. For 3b–d, over the course of extended cycling, the cycles become narrower resulting in reduced overall efficiency parameters (Table 1 and Fig. S42–S44†). We note the potentials for reduction of organic aryl halides and nitriles39 fall close to those observed for the reductions of 3a–d. Over time, irreversible chemical reduction of these groups may contribute an underlying degradation pathway for the ligands that include these substituents. Indeed, slightly less Nernstian peak parameters are observed by CV for 3c–d (Table 1).
Conclusions
This work presents a facile synthetic route for the incorporation of strong EWGs into the para position of the flanking aryl substituents on DIP ligands. This Zn-templated methodology offers higher yields, shortened reaction times and requires considerably milder conditions than previously reported for analogous DIPs,21,22 expanding the chemical scope available in the construction of these increasingly widely used ligands.40 Isolation of DIP ligands bearing strong EWGs has also enabled the high-yielding synthesis of new [(DIP)2Fe]2+ salts 3b–d, along with novel, structurally characterized examples of (DIP)ZnCl2 complexes 1a–d. Regarding the potential application of 3a–d in RFBs, 3a is shown to be a viable candidate as an RFB anolyte, displaying stability over at least 25 cycles while maintaining access to multiple electrons equivalents per molecule (∼1.9) over this range, surpassing previously reported examples 3e–f.16 The use of halides or pseudohalides at the ligand periphery, however, was found to be detrimental to cycling performance. This observation should help guide future ligand designs for MCCs for RFB applications.

General procedure for the isolation of decoordinated proligands
Zn complexes 1a–d (1 mmol) were each suspended in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) in a separatory funnel.

Electrochemical methods
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments were conducted using 0.6 mM of analyte dissolved in 15 mL dry CH3CN containing 0.1 M (nBu4N)PF6 and purged with Ar for 20 minutes prior to analysis. A CHI 760c bipotentiostat was employed, using a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon working electrode, a Ag/Ag+ quasi-non-aqueous reference electrode separated by a Vycor tip, and a Pt wire counter electrode. CV experiments were conducted using scan rates of 50–800 mV s−1. DPV experiments were carried out using a 5 mV increment, 50 mV amplitude, 0.1 s pulse width, 0.0167 s sample width, and 0.5 s pulse period. Following analysis, ferrocene (FcH) was added to each solution as an internal standard, and potentials are reported versus the FcH0/+ redox couple.41
Charging/discharging experiments were conducted via a chronopotentiometry protocol under an N2 atmosphere using a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) working electrode (∼700 cm2) in a glass cylindrical chamber (85 mL) containing an acetonitrile solution of both analyte and nBu4PF6 (0.3 M), and a Teflon-coated stirbar. A graphite rod counter electrode immersed in a 0.3 M nBu4PF6 solution was placed in a fritted tube (10 mL) separating the working and counter electrode chambers, and a fritted Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode placed into the working electrode chamber. Potential cut-offs were set to voltages at which the reversible couples for each analyte was observed to start and finish, according to CV experiments. Cycling experiments were executed at various anodic and cathodic currents, with a (dis)charge time of 3600 s, which corresponds to a 1C (dis)charging rate assuming a 2e− reduction process.
X-Ray crystallography
Crystal structure data was using collected from a multi-faceted crystal of suitable size and quality selected from a representative sample of crystals of the same habit using an optical microscope. Each crystal was mounted on a MiTiGen loop and data collection carried out in a cold stream of nitrogen (150 K; Bruker D8 QUEST ECO; Mo Kα radiation). All diffractometer manipulations were carried out using Bruker APEX3 software.42 Structure solution and refinement was carried out in the OLEX243 program using XS, XT and XL software, as well as the Bruker SHELXTL suite.42 For each structure, the absence of additional symmetry was confirmed using ADDSYM incorporated in the PLATON program.44
