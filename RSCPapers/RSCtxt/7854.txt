    , Accepted 5th July 2012First published on 19th July 2012AbstractThe effects of fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on solar cell performance have been examined for the first time and the two substituent positions on C60 have been found to have a large impact on the solar cell performance.
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn much attention for applications in renewable energy because of their potential for low cost, lightweight, and large-area processability.1 On the basis of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) concept using blends of p-type semiconducting polymers and n-type semiconducting fullerenes, device performances have been improved rapidly. Low-bandgap conjugated polymers have been developed intensively in recent years with the aim of better matching between the absorption and solar spectra, reaching a power conversion efficiency (η) of more than 7%.1,2 On the other hand, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) and its corresponding C70 derivative ([70]PCBM) are exclusively employed as an acceptor in the highly efficient PSCs.1–3 The number of other excellent fullerene derivatives exhibiting high device performance in PSCs is still limited.4,5
A drawback of PCBM is a relatively low energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which limits the open circuit potential (VOC) that is known to be proportional to the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor.1 To surmount the problem, fullerene derivatives with higher LUMO levels have been prepared for PSCs.6–8 Among these fullerene derivatives, fullerene bisadducts have been found to increase VOC by 0.1–0.2 V compared with the corresponding monoadducts because of lowering of the electron-accepting property by the partial loss of π-conjugation.7,8 Despite successful application of fullerene bisadducts to PSCs, their regioisomer mixtures have been used directly without separating each isomer. Considering that molecular packing and arrangement of fullerene derivatives in the active layer of conjugated polymers with them have a large impact on charge separation and electron-transporting properties, a pure bisadduct isomer with the two substituents at specific positions on C60 would yield a more desirable network comprised of the bisadduct in the active layer, leading to better device performance. Regioisomerically pure 56-π-electron methanofullerene was selectively prepared for PSCs,9 whereas each fullerene bisadduct has yet to be separated from the corresponding regioisomeric mixture for PSCs owing to the difficulty of separating and obtaining sufficient amounts of each isomer for device fabrication.
Herein we report the first application of separated fullerene bisadduct regioisomers (NC60BA) to PSCs (Fig. 1). To reduce the number of fullerene bisadduct isomers, a symmetrical dihydronaphthyl group was chosen as the substituent.8,10 We expected that symmetrical introduction of two long alkoxycarbonyl chains into the dihydronaphthyl groups would facilitate the isomer separation and purification at a large scale.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of fullerene bisadduct NC60BA and the two substituent positions on C60. 
The synthetic route to NC60BA and the monoadduct reference (NC60MA) is illustrated in Scheme 1. Ester-exchange reaction of benzocyclobutene 111 with hexanol afforded 2 in 92% yield. NC60BA and NC60MA were synthesized by Diels–Alder reaction of C60 and in situ generated o-quinodimethane prepared from benzocyclobutene 2 in 43% and 27% yield, respectively.12 First, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography and then by HPLC equipped with a Buckyprep column using toluene as the eluent (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the HPLC chart of NC60BA, six peaks were observed in a ratio of 3:18:31:11:29:7 and each fraction was repeatedly collected. The structures of NC60BA isomers as well as NC60MA were characterized by 1H NMR, high-resolution MS, and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy and the regioisomers eluted as the HPLC peaks sequentially were assigned as trans-1, trans-2, trans-3, trans-4, e, and cis-2 + cis-3 (mixture) isomers, respectively.10 The cis-1 isomer could not be obtained due to steric hindrance. The characteristic absorption spectra of NC60BA isomers measured in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) are consistent with those of the corresponding isomers as reported in the literature (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†).10 It is noteworthy that molar absorption coefficients of NC60BA isomers at 400–550 nm are comparable to those of NC60MA and [60]PCBM, ensuring the excellent light-harvesting ability of NC60BA isomers for solar spectrum.
 Scheme 1  
Reagents and conditions: (i) C6H13OH, H2SO4, 92%; (ii) C60 (0.5 equiv.), o-dichlorobenzene, reflux, 48 h, 43% for NC60BA and 27% for NC60MA based on C60. 
Electrochemical properties of the NC60BA isomers and NC60MA were measured using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (Fig. S3, ESI†). The NC60BA isomers exhibit three reduction waves in the negative potential range from 0 to −2.5 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Table 1 lists the first (E1), second (E2), and third (E3) reduction potentials of NC60BA isomers together with the LUMO energy levels. The LUMO levels are largely similar and consistent with the trend in theoretical values by DFT calculations (Table S2, ESI†). The LUMO energy levels of NC60BA isomers are 0.1–0.2 eV higher than NC60MA and [60]PCBM, which would be favourable for their application as an acceptor in PSCs to improve VOC. The thermal properties of the NC60BA isomers were measured by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), showing high thermal stability (Fig. S4, ESI†). For instance, onset points of weight loss of trans-2 and trans-3 isomers and NC60MA were ca. 380 °C, which are close to that of [60]PCBM.8 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement shows that the trans-2 isomer reveals no melting transition, which is in sharp contrast with DSC behaviors of the trans-3 isomer (279 °C), NC60MA (194 °C) and [60]PCBM (286 °C) (Fig. S5, ESI†).8

PSCs based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:acceptor/Al configuration were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the NC60BA isomers and NC60MA under the same fabrication conditions. The device performances are summarized in Table 2. The control P3HT:[60]PCBM device shows an η value of 2.10% (VOC = 0.64 V, JSC = 6.77 mA cm−2, FF = 0.49). The trans-2, trans-4 and e isomer-based BHJ solar cells exhibit similar η values of ∼1.4%, whereas trans-1, trans-3 and cis-2 + cis-3 isomer-based BHJ solar cells reveal inferior performance (Fig. 2a). Overall, the NC60BA isomer mixture-based device shows moderate performance (η = 0.95%). Although the η value of the NC60MA-based device is slightly higher than those of trans-2, trans-4 and e isomer-based devices, the VOC values (0.70–0.73 V) for the bisadducts are significantly increased compared with that (0.66 V) for the monoadduct. Photocurrent action spectra of trans-2 and trans-3 based devices are displayed in Fig. 2b. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) values of the trans-2-based device are larger than those of the trans-3-based device, despite analogous light-harvesting properties of the two films (Fig. S6, ESI†). These results suggest that the difference in the device performance results from those in charge separation efficiency and/or charge-collection efficiency.

To shed light on the relationship between film structure and device performance, surface morphology of the P3HT:trans-2 and P3HT:trans-3 films was assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig. 3).13 Surface roughness of the P3HT:trans-3 and P3HT:trans-2 films is similar, whereas microscopic phase separation takes place in the P3HT:trans-3 film. These results suggest that a bicontinuous donor–acceptor network is formed more effectively in the P3HT:trans-2 device than in the P3HT:trans-3 film, leading to the higher device performance of the P3HT:trans-2 device.

In conclusion, we have successfully examined the effects of fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on solar cell performance for the first time. The two substituent positions on C60 have been found to have a large impact on the device performance. Such structure–performance relationship will provide valuable, basic information on the rational design of fullerene bisadducts as an acceptor for highly efficient PSCs.
