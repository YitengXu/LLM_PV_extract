    , Accepted 28th January 2020First published on 29th January 2020AbstractWith the rapid growth in the requirement for emerging photovoltaic technology like semitransparent solar cells applied for integrated smart windows, there is an urgent need to develop near-infrared (NIR) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). To address this issue, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT), which has a stable quinoid structure to minimize the energy difference between two resonance structures corresponding to the band gap, is introduced into the push–pull molecular architecture as a bridge unit to narrow the band gap of the derived acceptors. Due to the different linkage positions (4- or 6-position) of asymmetric TT, these acceptors are classified into two types of isomers, namely 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F, of which all have strong absorption in the NIR range. By incorporation with polymer donor PTB7-Th, the devices based on 6-position isomers exhibit superior photovoltaic performance, wherein a champion device based on 6T4F is obtained with a power conversion efficiency of 10.74%. With detailed investigations on inherent optoelectronic properties as well as structural and morphological variation, this performance diversity induced by isomerism is determined by the evident difference in the packing order, which will impact the charge mobility and fill factor. This work presents a class of high-performance NIR acceptors in which the regioisomeric backbone will significantly impact the optoelectronic properties.
Introduction
Recently, remarkable progress has been achieved in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) attributed to the continuous advancements in both material and device approaches, in particular, the innovation of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which possess outstanding advantages, such as facile accessibility and structure flexibility, compared to fullerene derivatives.1–6 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 16% have been achieved for single junction solar cells.7–10 Thus, some potential applications for OSCs in the consumer market are emerging and might become mature in the near future, e.g. building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) in which traditional windows are replaced by transparent OSCs to provide an opportunity to supply additional energy with less effect on the original functions of buildings. To ensure the visible transparency, it is essential to develop organic semiconductors that mainly absorb near-infrared light with a high extinction coefficient.11–30
An effective way to narrow the band gap to manipulate the absorption in the near-infrared region is by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties in push–pull conjugated molecules.21,31–33 For example, a class of the most successful NFAs is based on an A–D–A configuration, such as middle band gap acceptors ITIC34 and IDIC15,35 with an electron-rich fused indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) or indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and two strong electron-withdrawing 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC) as the terminals, wherein the fluoro-substituted IC terminal groups with a stronger electron-withdrawing ability are used to further enhance the ICT effect.36,37 Another strategy to lower the band gap of an organic semiconductor is to construct a conjugated system wherein both the original state and quinoid resonance structure possess aromatic rings.38–40 Consequently, the energy difference of varied resonance structures with varied aromatic states, as an indication of its band gap, is reduced. Therefore, we reason that it might be possible to further minimize the band gap by synergistically combining these two methods, to introduce a moiety with a unique quinoid resonance structure into the push–pull conjugated molecules.
Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) is a building block with the exactly required properties since the fused thiophene ring can stabilize its quinoid resonance structure (conductive state).41,42 In addition, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene derivatives substituted by ester or carbonyl groups are commonly used as an electron-deficient acceptor in organic semiconductors.12,43–46 However, it is notable that the asymmetric configuration of TT poses an issue of isomerism to complicate structural definition. Our previous study has revealed that there are two different repeating units in PTB7-Th, as one of many successful donor polymers, due to the asymmetry of fluoro-substituted TT (FTT), while the ratio of these two units plays a key role in determining the material properties and device performance.47,48 Zhu et al. have reported a series of small molecules and oligomers containing TT units wherein the regioregularity significantly affects the charge mobility and photovoltaic property.42,44,49,50 While this work was being carried out, Li et al. synthesized a family of isomers with FTT as the bridge unit and revealed the impact of the fluorine orientation on derived OSCs.51 Hence, it is still challenging to develop new near-infrared NFAs involving TT, which causes the isomerism of relevant materials.
Herein, we introduce TT into A–D–A molecules as a conjugated bridge to form an A-TT-D-TT-A configuration to obtain four acceptors, 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F. The four compounds comprise a fused IDT core and two strong electron-withdrawing IC(2F) bridged by quinoidal ester-substituted TT (Scheme 1), wherein the asymmetry of TT creates two types of derivatives, 4-position isomers 4TIC and 4T4F, and 6-position isomers 6TIC and 6T4F. With the help of a strong push–pull effect and the unique resonance structure of TT, these acceptors show extended absorption in the near-infrared region wherein the absorption edge of 4T4F and 6T4F with a fluorinated terminal group is over 1000 nm. More importantly, the choice of the linkage position in the TT unit plays a key role in affecting the optoelectronic properties and crystallinity, and consequently in determining the photovoltaic performance. The champion device based on 6T4F shows the best PCE of 10.74% with a high short circuit current (Jsc) of 25.79 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 69.4%, but the 4T4F-based device shows a much lower PCE of 6.58%. The detailed study reveals that the superior performance of the 6-position is ascribed to the higher packing order when blended with PTB7-Th, which enhances the charge mobility, and thus improves the fill factors. This work is one of the few examples wherein the NIR acceptors with an absorption edge exceeding 1000 nm can achieve a PCE of over 10%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the four NFAs are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme S1 (ESI†). The precursors 1a and 1b are prepared by Stille cross-coupling involving two regioisomers, 2-ethylhexyl 4-bromo-6-formylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate and 2-ethylhexyl 6-bromo-4-formylthieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate, respectively. Then, the final products are obtained by the Knoevenagel reaction of 1a (1b) and IC (IC-2F). According to the linking position between the IDT core and TT, these acceptors are classified into two types: 4-position isomers 4TIC and 4T4F, and 6-position isomers 6TIC and 6T4F. The four NFAs can be dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), which favors the solution processability. Their chemical structures have been confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectra, which are shown in the ESI.†
Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical property of these NFAs has been characterized by UV-vis-NIR absorption. The spectra of the NFAs in chloroform solution and film are shown in Fig. 1 and detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. All of these new acceptors show broad absorption in the near-infrared region. Compared to 4-position isomers 4TIC (818 nm) and 4T4F (833 nm), the maximum absorption of 6-position isomers 6TIC (798 nm) and 6T4F (813 nm) in solution shows hypsochromic shifts of approximately 20 nm, respectively, indicating that the linkage position has significantly impacted the push–pull structure. Compared to the solution, the absorption of films exhibits evident bathochromical shifts with the edge extending to over 1000 nm, implying the strong aggregation in the solid state, in particular for 6T4F, which shows a red-shift of 106 nm. In addition, the fluoro-substituent in the IC terminal group is helpful to prompt the electron-withdrawing ability to result in the red-shift in the relevant absorption spectra. The optical band-gap (Eg) of 6T4F and 4T4F estimated from the absorption edge of corresponding films is 1.23 and 1.22 eV, which are slightly lower than the Eg of 6TIC (1.30 eV) and 4TIC (1.26 eV), respectively.

To study the electrochemical property, the cyclic voltammetry measurement has been conducted. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of 4TIC 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F are estimated to be −5.36/−4.11 eV, −5.38/−4.13 eV, −5.31/−3.96 eV and −5.45/−4.00 eV, respectively from the onset potentials (Fig. 1c). The corresponding energy level diagram and data are listed in Fig. 1d and Table 1. It is obvious that different linkage positions affect the energy levels of the four isomers. Compared to 6TIC and 6T4F, 4TIC and 4T4F have downshifted LUMOs, respectively. By introducing fluorine into the IC terminals, the LUMOs show apparent downshifts attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of fluorine. The electrochemical band gaps are consistent with the optical band gap except 6T4F (1.45 vs. 1.25 eV), since the films are prepared by different methods for cyclic voltammetry (drop casting) and absorption (spin casting), and 6T4F shows a strong tendency to aggregate wherein the packing mode is significantly impacted by the processing condition.
Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the four acceptors, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs were fabricated with an inverted device architecture of ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor/MoO3/Al. The active layers were prepared by using chloroform as a solvent. The optimized weight ratio of PTB7-Th:acceptors is 1:1.3 and the temperature of thermal annealing (TA) is 110 °C. Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PTB7-Th:acceptor solar cells under the optimized conditions and the detailed device parameters are listed in Table 2. Interestingly, 6-position isomers outperform 4-position isomers in photovoltaic performance. The 4TIC based device shows the lowest PCE of 5.26% with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 14.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 48.7%, while changing the linkage position dramatically changes all parameters leading to a higher PCE of 8.13%. Meanwhile, fluorine substitution on the IC group decreases the Voc by around 0.1 V, which is consistent with the tendency of lowering LUMO levels in relevant acceptors, but significantly enhances the Jsc and FF, and then synergistically realizes the best PCE of 10.74% with a Jsc of 25.79 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.60 V and a FF of 69.4% in the champion device, PTB7-Th:6T4F. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 2b. The 6T4F-based device exhibits a higher EQE value of over 70% in the region from 600 to 900 nm with the maximum value reaching 73.7%, indicating that both the polymer donor and acceptor make a considerable and complementary contribution to the whole Jsc values. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves are 14.93, 16.97, 19.14, and 24.28 mA cm−2 for the 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC, and 6T4F based devices, respectively. All the integrated Jsc values are within about 5% error compared to those values obtained from the J–V curves, indicating that the measurements are reliable for the PCEs. The EQE response of devices based on 6-position isomers is much higher than that of 4-isomers. To rationalize this, the absorptions of various blend films are measured (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, the absorption spectra show approximate intensities for the analogues. Furthermore, photoluminescence (PL) experiments have been carried out to probe the origin of the varied performance, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). For the four blend films, the PL emissions of PTB7-Th (excited at 685 nm) are completely quenched by acceptors respectively, indicating efficient charge transfer from the polymer donor PTB7-Th to electron acceptors. The PL emissions of 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F were efficiently quenched in blend films with quenching efficiencies of 72.6%, 79.8%, 87.4%, and 93.9%, suggesting better charge transfer between 6-position isomers and PTB7-Th, thus leading to a higher photocurrent.

Charge transport, exciton dissociation and charge recombination
The charge transport properties of the PTB7-Th:acceptor films were evaluated for hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:acceptors/MoO3/Al and electron-only devices ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptors/ZnO/Al by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S4, ESI† and Table 2). The blend films based on 6-postion acceptors show higher mobilities, in particular, for the electron, which typically transports along the pathway formed by the acceptor. Furthermore, 6-position isomers exhibit more balanced charge transport than 4-position isomers. In addition, the fluorination in terminal groups is able to enhance both hole and electron mobilities. Consequently, the hole and electron mobilities for the PTB7-Th:6T4F film are calculated to be 1.41 × 10−3 and 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This enhanced and more balanced mobility leads to the champion device performance with the best FF and Jsc. The diversity of charge mobility is interrelated with the morphology and microstructure, which will be discussed in the following section.
In order to understand the mechanisms of exciton dissociation and charge extraction in the devices based on varied acceptors, the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) is employed and shown in Fig. 3a. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is described as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias. In general, it is assumed that at high Veff, photogenerated excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the individual electrodes efficiently. Herein, for these four devices, the Jph reaches the saturation current density (Jsat) at high Veff (>2 V). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and collection probability (Pcoll) were estimated by the ratio of Jph/Jsat in which Jph is obtained under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively. The Pdiss/Pcoll values are 78.2%/67.7%, 92.6%/73.4%, 89.9%/67.6% and 94.5%/82.1% for 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F based devices, respectively. These results imply that the 6-position linkage and fluoro-substituent are able to improve Pdiss/Pcoll in relevant devices. Thus, the 6T4F based device exhibits the most efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection process and this contributes to its enhanced values of Jsc and FF.

The charge carrier recombination mechanism was further examined by measuring the correlation between Voc or Jsc and light intensity (Plight), as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 3b. The slope of Vocversus light intensity can help in verifying the main recombination mechanism in the OSCs. When the slope is kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and q is the elementary charge, bimolecular recombination is the primary mechanism. A slope of 2kT/q implies that the trap-assisted or Shockley–Read Hall (SRH) recombination is dominant. The values of slopes for 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F-based devices are about 1.09kT/q, 1.24kT/q, 1.11kT/q and 1.37kT/q (Fig. S3, ESI†), respectively, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination is suppressed and bimolecular recombination is dominant in all fabricated devices. The dependence of Jsc on Plight can be described as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α. In general, when the value of α is close to unity, the bimolecular recombination of charge carriers is negligible. The values of α for 4TIC, 4T4F, 6TIC and 6T4F based devices are 0.934, 0.936, 0.911 and 0.975, respectively, which manifest that bimolecular recombination is more suppressed in the 6T4F based device compared to the other three devices.
Morphology characterization
To investigate the impact of isomerism on the morphology of devices, 6T4F, 6TIC, 4T4F and 4TIC neat films as well as blend films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The neat films of 6TIC and 6T4F show greater root mean square (RMS) roughness with values of 2.66 nm and 10.8 nm respectively, compared with 4TIC (0.49 nm) and 4T4F (0.90 nm) (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating stronger aggregation. From the AFM height images (Fig. 4), we observed uniform surfaces for all four blend films. The PTB7-Th:4TIC and PTB7-Th:4T4F blend films show relatively small root mean square (RMS) roughness with values of 1.68 and 1.25 nm, respectively. No large phase separation appears for both films, indicating the excessive miscibility between polymer donors and 4-position acceptors. It can be deduced that the extremely low crystallization in the blend films is unfavorable for efficient charge separation and transportation, consequently limiting device performance, in particular, Jsc and FF. As for PTB7-Th:6TIC and PTB7-Th:6T4F blend films, the aggregation becomes evident and the RMS is increased up to 2.30 and 3.15 nm, respectively, indicating the existence of phase separation induced by 6TIC or 6T4F with improved crystallinity.

To get a deep insight into the molecular packing structures, the four blend films were studied by using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), as shown in Fig. 5. The key parameters calculated from the GIWAXS line-cut profiles for the packing behavior of these films are displayed in Table S1 (ESI†). It is well known that PTB7-Th tends to pack with face-on orientation, leading to a lamellar packing (100) peak at around 0.27 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction and a π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at 1.57 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction,47 both of which are observed in Fig. 5 with relatively weak intensities. Compared to the peaks of PTB7-Th, much stronger diffraction peaks resulting from acceptors are evident at approximately 0.34 Å−1 in IP and 1.86 Å−1 in the OOP direction in all four blend films, corresponding to the lamellar packing and π–π stacking. The π–π distances are calculated to be 3.39 Å (4TIC), 3.36 Å (4T4F), 3.38 Å (6TIC) and 3.36 Å (6T4F), respectively. Such exceptionally tight π–π stacking implies a very strong intermolecular interaction in these NFAs, which may result from their rigid planar skeletons. Notably, the blend film based on 6-position isomers shows stronger and sharp scattering peaks, compared to those of 4-position isomers. As depicted in Table S1 (ESI†), the coherence lengths evaluated by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6-position isomers are bigger, indicating that 6-position isomers possess higher packing orders even in blend films. This feature is believed to be beneficial for constructing a well-organized active layer, and thus helping 6T4F to achieve high efficiency.

Conclusions
In summary, four near-infrared NFAs were designed and synthesized by tailoring the A-TT-D-TT-A molecular backbones, in which an asymmetrical ester-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with a stable quinoid structure is employed as a bridge to further minimize the bandgap. Due to different linkage positions of asymmetrical TT, these acceptors are classified into two types: 4-position isomers (4TIC and 4TIF) and 6-position isomers (6TIC and 6T4F). The four molecules show strong absorption in the near-infrared range, wherein the absorption of 4T4F and 6T4F is exceeding 1000 nm since the fluorinated terminals enhance the intramolecular charge transfer. It should be noted that the 6-position isomers show a superior photovoltaic performance compared to the 4-position isomers. A champion device based on 6T4F is obtained with a PCE of 10.74% with a better Jsc (25.79 mA cm−2) and FF (69.4%). This interesting result suggests that the higher packing order demonstrated by UV-vis absorption in the solid state and GIWAXS facilitates the exciton dissociation and charge transport, leading to enhanced charge mobility and FF. This work provides a solution for designing NIR high-performance organic semiconductors by the incorporation of the quinoid unit, and reveals the relationship between the isomeric structure and photoelectric properties, eventually leading to a bright future of near-infrared OSCs in emerging applications.
