    , Accepted 24th October 2022First published on 25th October 2022AbstractTwo fullerene derivatives C60-MP and C60-ETPA were designed and synthesized for tin-halide perovskite solar cells. The introduction of an electron-withdrawing group and an alkyl chain reduced the electron affinity, resulting in a shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level than that of common phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). Moreover, the smaller energy level offset provided efficient carrier transport and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the devices with C60-ETPA achieved an open-circuit voltage of 0.76 V and a power conversion efficiency of over 10%, which were substantially higher than 0.63 V and 8.25% for the control devices with PC61BM, respectively.
Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received extensive attention over the past few decades due to their tunable bandgap, long carrier diffusion length, flexibility, and semi-transparency.1–4 An impressive certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% has been reached with huge commercialization prospects.5 However, the current high-performance PSCs are mainly based on lead perovskites. Reducing the toxicity issue of lead-PSCs is particularly important for their wide commercialization. In this regard, tin halide PSCs (TPSCs) are gaining widespread attention as the most promising candidates, due to their low toxicity, high mobility, bandgap close to the optimum bandgap, and similar optical properties to lead counterparts.6–10 With recent developments, the highest PCE of TPSCs has reached over 14%.11 However, achieving comparable PCE to the mainstream lead-based PSCs is still a challenge for the TPSCs.
One of the main challenges comes from the severe open-circuit voltage (Voc) loss in TPSCs.12 Compared to the Voc of 1.20 V for lead-based PSCs, Voc of TPSCs is usually 0.60 V. This lower output voltage originates from two main factors, one is the undesirable oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+,9 which greatly increases the carrier concentration in the dark state, and non-radiative charge recombination.13,14 On the other hand, the energy level mis-alignment between charge transport layer and tin perovskite layer results in aggregated charge recombination and Voc loss.15 Thus, improving the Voc of TPSCs is of particular importance for their development. As the popular electron transport material (ETM) in the inverted p–i–n devices, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) has been widely used in TPSCs, but the Voc of these devices was limited by the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. Meanwhile, the complex synthesis routes and high synthesis cost of PC61BM limited its commercialization. Therefore, to address these issues, the development of novel ETMs to match the energy level and reduce the synthesis costs for TPSCs is urgently required. Here, two novel fullerene derivative ETMs have been designed and synthesized, named C60-MP and C60-ETPA. The fullerene cage provided efficient electron transfer characteristics for the new ETLs and a long alkyl chain is introduced to obtain better solubility and hydrophobicity. In addition, introducing electron-donating groups of dimethoxybenzene and triphenylamine (TPA) on the fullerene cage is an efficient strategy to raise the LUMO energy level, which has been proved successful in the donor material design for organic solar cells.16 The 2-ethyl-1-hexylamine group is also connected with the pyrrolidine ring to tune the energy level and solubility. C60-ETPA with an extended TPA group exhibits a shallower LUMO energy level and better film-forming ability compared to PC61BM. Eventually, the Voc has been improved to 0.76 V for TPSCs with C60-ETPA, and was significantly higher than 0.63 V for the control device with PC61BM.
The synthetic route and molecular structures of C60-MP and C60-ETPA are shown in Fig. 1a. The detailed synthesis process using the Prato reaction is displayed in the ESI.† The target molecule is characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, Fig. S1–6, ESI†). The Voc of the PSCs is normally determined by the difference between the energy levels of electrons and holes.17 To study the LUMO energy levels of the two products, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests have been conducted. Due to the stronger electron-donating ability of TPA,16 a higher reduction potential for C60-ETPA than that of C60-MP was achieved. The CV spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −4.12 eV, −4.07 eV, and −4.04 eV for PC61BM, C60-MP, and C60-ETPA, respectively. Therefore, with the redesigning of the peripheral groups, the LUMO energy level shifts up due to the lone pair of electrons provided by the nitrogen atom in the pyrrolidine and the alkoxy groups on the benzene ring, which reduces the electron affinity of the fullerene derivatives. Compared with PC61BM, both products attained the higher LUMO energy levels. In particular, the LUMO energy level of C60-ETPA shifts up by about 80 meV, which is good for achieving a higher Voc in TPSCs.18

The absorption behaviours of the ETMs in chloroform solution were explored by a UV-vis absorption test (Fig. 1c). All materials exhibit a similar absorption behaviour. C60-MP and C60-ETPA have the onset absorption (λedge) of 740 nm and 728 nm, respectively. The bandgaps of C60-MP and C60-ETPA were calculated to be 1.68 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively. Combining with the CV results, the HOMO energy level was calculated to be 5.75 eV and 5.74 eV, respectively.15 As presented in Fig. 1d, compared with PC61BM, C60-MP and C60-ETPA can form a better energy level matching with the tin perovskite layer due to their shallower LUMO energy level.19
A large number of research studies have shown that controlling the number and position of the adducts on fullerene can achieve a shallower LUMO energy level, which generally lead to higher Voc.20–22 However, the conjugation of the fullerene ring was weakened to slow down the charge transport due to the additional side chains of multi-adducts.23 This dilemma can be addressed by the molecular design of single fullerene adducts. The photo-CELIV tests were carried out to probe the electron transport properties of the ETMs for electron-only devices (Fig. 1e). The results showed that C60-ETPA has a good electron mobility of 4.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of PC61BM (3.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and C60-MP has the highest electron mobility of 5.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is probably due to the strong conjugation effect.24,25 Therefore, the results show that rational molecular design can improve electron mobility while maintaining suitable energy levels in single fullerene adducts.
Inverted FA0.75MA0.25SnI2.75Br0.25 TPSCs with C60-MP, C60-ETPA and PC61BM as ETMs were constructed (Fig. 2a) and evaluated under an illumination of AM 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2. The characteristic J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a and the device parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The device with C60-ETPA achieved a Voc of 0.76 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 19.94 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 67.21%, and a PCE of 10.17%. Meanwhile, the C60-MP-based device showed a Voc of 0.69 V, a Jsc of 20.51 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.46%, and a PCE of 9.43%. The control device with PC61BM showed a Voc of 0.63 V, a Jsc of 19.34 mA cm−2, a FF of 67.26%, and a PCE of 8.25%, Impressively, the Voc was increased by 130 mV for the device with C60-ETPA compared to the PC61BM device, and was even higher than that gained from the LUMO energy level. Compared with C60-ETPA, the device with C60-MP showed a higher Jsc due to the weaker electron-donating properties of the dimethoxybenzene group. The integrated photocurrent density was calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Fig. 2b and Fig. S7, ESI†) to be 19.27 mA cm−2, which was in good agreement with that obtained using the J–V curves. The steady-state PCE and current density were measured at a bias voltage of 0.62 V. The device with C60-ETPA showed a steady PCE of 9.47% and a Jsc of 15.30 mA cm−2. The statistical distribution of the device parameters with C60-ETPA and PC61BM was measured with 20 independent devices. As shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the C60-ETPA devices showed good reproducibility in the statistical data of Voc, which was higher than that of PC61BM and C60-MP devices. To investigate the intrinsic carrier dynamics, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of glass/perovskite/ETMs were measured. As shown in Fig. 2e, the blank perovskite film showed a high PL peak, and both films exhibited strong PL quenching after adding the ETMs. The films with C60-MP and C60-ETPA present a higher quenching efficiency, indicating that the two ETMs have a more effective electron extraction ability from the tin perovskite.26,27 As summarized in Table S3 (ESI†), the PL decay times of films with C60-MP, C60-ETPA and PC61BM were calculated to be 1.56 ns, 2.47 ns and 4.13 ns (Fig. 2f), respectively, indicating that a faster charge transfer and the matched energy level at the perovskite/ETM interface can reduce the carrier recombination.28

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) tests were carried out to evaluate the film quality of the ETMs. The results are presented in Fig. 3a. The root mean square (RMS) roughness value is 18.88 nm for the pristine perovskite, while the value is significantly reduced to similar RMS of 3.14 nm, 4.68 nm and 2.12 nm after being covered with PC61BM, C60-MP and C60-ETPA, respectively.

Due to the more spatial three-dimensional structure brought by the TPA group, C60-ETPA has the lowest roughness, which facilitates better film-forming ability and efficient charge transmission. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were then conducted to evaluate the charge transport and recombination phenomena (Fig. 3b). The C60-ETPA device showed a much larger charge recombination resistance (Rrec) (63.04 kΩ) than the devices with C60-MP (33.16 kΩ) and PC61BM (19.90 kΩ). Compared with PC61BM, C60-ETPA has higher electron mobility and optimized energy level matching, thus leading to a reduced charge recombination at the interface between perovskite/ETMs.
To further probe the reason for the enhancement of Voc, the transient photovoltage (TPV) test has been carried out to reveal the carrier recombination (Fig. 3c). Compared to the C60-MP (98.00 μs) and PC61BM devices (84.36 μs), the devices with C60-ETPA exhibited an almost twice longer recombination time (159.11 μs). The carrier recombination has been greatly suppressed due to the efficient charge transport in the device with C60-ETPA, which further contributed to the increase of Voc. Furthermore, the Mott–Schottky analysis has been carried out to study the increase in Voc. As shown in Fig. 3d, the flat band potential (Vbi) was increased from 0.56 V for the device with PC61BM to 0.82 V for the C60-ETPA device,29 which facilitated the improvement of Voc.
The long-term stability of TPSCs is still a huge challenge, and we tested the stability of the devices with the new ETM and PC61BM. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the C60-ETPA device maintained over 90% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h storage in a N2 atmosphere, which was higher than that of the PC61BM device. The water contact angles have been measured. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the perovskite layer covered with C60-ETPA showed a bigger water contact angle (99.5°) than that covered with PC61BM (94.7°), which was mainly ascribed to the long alkyl chain.
In summary, we designed and synthesized two novel fullerene derivatives C60-MP and C60-ETPA, which have a shallower LUMO energy level and good solubility. Compared with C60-MP, TPA was introduced to replace the dimethoxybenzene group in C60-ETPA. The optimized molecule possesses a well-matched energy level. Simultaneously, fine film formation and excellent charge mobility bring a high device performance. The device with C60-ETPA exhibited a remarkable Voc of 0.76 V and a PCE of 10.17%. Our results revealed that raising the LUMO energy level of ETMs by molecular structure modulation can effectively reduce the output voltage loss in TPSCs.
