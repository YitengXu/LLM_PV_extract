    , Accepted 2nd February 2022First published on 2nd February 2022AbstractOwing to it being low-cost and eco-friendly and having multiple oxidation states, the ternary transition metal oxide CuCo2O4 has been used as an electrode material with superior electrocatalytic activity in numerous fields. However, its application in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) has not been investigated. Herein, we synthesized porous hollow micro-spherical CuCo2O4 nanomaterials by simple solvothermal and calcination processes and then applied them in QDSSCs as counter electrodes (CEs). Because of the low density, good shell permeability of the hollow porous structure and high catalytic activity of the material, QDSSCs achieved a higher efficiency of 6.19%. Furthermore, considering the structural flexibility, large specific surface area and high conductivity of graphene, CuCo2O4/RGO composites were further prepared. QDSSCs equipped with optimized CuCo2O4/RGO12 CEs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 7.04% with Jsc = 22.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, and FF = 0.51, which is higher than that of the pure CuCo2O4 CE. Both EIS and the Tafel test proved that the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE has the best catalytic activity and electron transport performance, which is beneficial for the regeneration of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple. The prominent cell performance mainly depends on the combination of the abundant catalytically active sites of CuCo2O4 and the excellent conductivity and structural flexibility of graphene.
1. Introduction
With the increasing demand for energy in society, the effective development and utilization of sustainable energy has become a hotspot in social research.1,2 Solar energy, as a representative of clean energy, has aroused great interest from researchers. Meanwhile, QDSSCs, as one of the third-generation solar cells, have been extensively studied due to their relatively high theoretical conversion efficiency (44%), low cost, and simple preparation.3 Currently, the reported highest PCE of a QDSSC cell is 15.20%, which is still far below its theoretical conversion efficiency, and cannot meet the requirements of commercial production and application.4 Therefore, exploring novel electrode materials to improve the cell's PCE is urgent. As a medium of photoelectron transfer, photoanodes have an important effect on the performance of the cell. And quantum dots, as light absorbing elements of solar cells, have the advantages of an adjustable band gap, a large absorption coefficient, multiple exciton effects and good chemical stability. At present, commonly used QDs include CdS, CdSe, InP, PbS, Ag2S, CuInS2, ZnCuInSe, etc. Considering that the co-sensitization of various QDs can improve the absorption range of light and the preparation method of CdS/CdSe QDs is simple and mature, we chose CdS/CdSe as photoanode QDs in this study. Besides, as a crucial part of QDSSCs, the CE is used to transfer the electrons from the external circuit to the redox system of the electrolyte and promote the reduction of the redox couple.5 Consequently, a CE material with good electron transport performance, high catalytic activity, and excellent stability is particularly significant for obtaining satisfactory PCE. Commonly used counter electrode materials mainly include precious metals like platinum; metal compounds (e.g. Cu2S, MoS2, CoS, and NiS);6 conductive polymers like polythiophene (PT) and polypyrrole (PPy); carbon materials i.e. GO and CNT; and composite materials, such as Cu2S/RGO,7 CoS/graphene,8 and CuMoSe/carbon composites.9
Compared with traditional monometallic oxides, mixed valence transition metal spinel oxides with the formula AB2O4 (A and B = metal) are proved to be remarkable electrode materials with superior electrocatalytic activity.10,11 This is mainly attributed to their cost-effectiveness, easy preparation and the existence of multivalent metal ions, which provide the low activation energy required for electron transport and improve the electrocatalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of high conductivity and redox activity.12,13 Among them, hollow micro-spherical CuCo2O4 with a classic spinel structure has attracted great interest. Generally speaking, the hollow structure has the advantages of a large specific surface area, low density and good shell permeability, which could promote the efficient separation of carriers and shorten the path of ion diffusion.14–17 Moreover, since cobalt-based materials have outstanding catalytic activity similar to precious metals and copper-based materials have distinguished electrical conductivity and low-cost, materials based on the combination of these two elements can complement each other and promote synergy, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the material.18–21 Additionally, studies demonstrated that when the Co2+ in Co2+(Co2)3+O4 is replaced with eco-friendly Cu2+, the rate capability and electrochemical properties of the material are greatly improved.20,22 Based on the above advantages, CuCo2O4 is extensively used in the fields of lithium ion batteries,23 electrochemical sensors,24 oxygen evolution,19 supercapacitors,13 perovskite solar cells11 and so on. So far, CuCo2O4 has not been used as a CE in QDSSCs but is applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a superior CE material.25 Here, we may for the first time use the cheap and non-toxic ternary metal oxide (CuCo2O4) as the CE material for QDSSCs. However, the aggregation of nanoparticles and the relatively low specific surface area are the main defects that hinder the further improvement of their performance. To solve this problem, the key approach is to combine the nanoparticles with a material possessing a large surface area and structural flexibility.
In order to reduce particle aggregation and increase the active area and conductivity of the material, carbon-based materials can be combined with the active material as a support material.26 Among the many carbon-based materials, graphene, a 2D monolayer nanosheet with sp2 hybridization, is recognized as the most promising carbon material due to its high conductivity, large surface area, structural flexibility and excellent mechanical properties.27,28 Furthermore, graphene sheets can be introduced as a substrate for the uniform growth of nanomaterials to improve electrocatalytic activity. Therefore, combining conductive carbon-based materials with binary metal oxides is a potential way to further boost material properties.29,30 A large number of transition metal oxide/RGO composite materials are reported in many systems and exhibit excellent performance. For instance, Zhang and his co-workers successfully designed a porous structure of CuCo2O4/N-rGO and used it as an electrode material for sodium ion batteries.31 He's group prepared a CuCo2O4/RGO catalyst by loading relatively cut-price Cu and Co on graphene and applied it in the catalytic reduction reaction.32 Xiong et al. used a facile method to synthesize a CuCo2O4/RGO composite material and utilized it as a counter electrode in DSSCs.25 Usually, the achievement of these results depends on the synergistic effect between graphene with good physicochemical properties and a high specific surface area and transition metal oxides with ideal catalytic activity.22 Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the CuCo2O4/rGO composite has not yet been tried as a CE material in QDSSCs.
Herein, CuCo2O4 hollow microspheres are synthesized by a simple solvothermal method followed by calcination. Simultaneously, we adopt the in situ growth method to load the hollow CuCo2O4 nanospheres on graphene sheets and apply them to QDSSCs as the CE. It is a delight to discover that the prepared CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/rGO complexes all show distinct merits in cell operation, including high catalytic activity and excellent stability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization curve (Tafel), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and other electrochemical characterization methods are further used to prove the excellent performance of the material. Besides, when the mass of graphene is 12 mg, the obtained CuCo2O4/rGO12 composite served as a CE in QDSSCs that achieved a PCE of 7.04% with Jsc = 22.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, and FF = 0.51, which is higher than the efficiencies of many reported CdS/CdSe-based QDSSCs. This research indicates that CuCo2O4/rGO composites have profound prospects in the application of CEs in QDSSCs and provides ideas for the use of transition metal oxides as counter electrodes in QDSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the chemicals in this study were used directly after purchase without any further treatment. The solution in the experiment was prepared with deionized (DI) water obtained from a Milli-Q Gradient A10 system.
2.2. Preparation of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode

Fabrication of TiO2 films. 
Commercial P25 TiO2 was employed to prepare a TiO2 slurry. A certain amount of P25 powder and terpineol were weighed and put into a pre-prepared ball grinding tank. After ball grinding adequately for 10 h, the TiO2 slurry was obtained. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, SnO2: F) substrates were successively placed in glass cleaner, acetone, deionized water and absolute ethanol, and ultrasonically cleaned for 30 minutes, respectively, and then dried for later use. The prepared TiO2 slurry was covered on the cleaned FTO using the doctor-blade coating technology. After standing for 5 minutes, the films were dried using a heating plate at 70 °C and then calcined at 500 °C for 30 minutes to strengthen the adhesion of the TiO2 films on FTO.
The construction of CdS/CdSe/ZnS: Both CdS and CdSe quantum dots were deposited on the prepared TiO2 films by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method, while ZnS is deposited on the co-sensitized photoanode by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technology. The concrete preparation method refers to the previous literature with slight modifications.33 In brief, 0.50 mmol CdCl2·5/2H2O, 3.50 mmol thiourea and 1.65 mmol NH4Cl were first added to 25 mL of deionized water in sequence and stirred until dissolution. After stirring for 10 minutes, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.50 with NH3·H2O. Then, the prepared TiO2 films were immersed vertically in the above solution and placed in an environment below 5 °C for 4h. After taking them out, they were rinsed with DI water and dried with N2 to obtain TiO2/CdS. Secondly, 0.1 M Cd(OAc)2, 0.2 M N(CH2COONa)3 and 0.1 M Na2SeSO3 were mixed (45 mL, volume ratio 1:1:1) to prepare a CdSe quantum dot deposition solution. Among them, 0.1 M Na2SeSO3 was prepared by stirring 15 mmol selenium powder and 0.3 M Na2SO3 (150 mL) at 100 °C reflux for 8 h under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Subsequently, the CdS-sensitized TiO2 films were put in the above deposition solution and placed in a refrigerator, allowing them to react in the dark for 8 h to acquire TiO2/CdS/CdSe. Finally, the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode was obtained by alternately immersing it in 0.1 M Zn(Ac)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solutions 4 times, and after each immersion, it was washed with DI water and dried in air.

2.3. Synthesis of CuCo2O4/RGO
The modified Hummer's method as mentioned in the literature was used to fabricate GO sheets.34 The synthesis of the CuCo2O4/RGO composite followed the literature method with slight modifications.24 40 mL of isopropanol and 8 mL of glycerol were mixed evenly. Graphene of different qualities (GOx, x = 6, 12, and 24 mg) was added into the mixed solvent and dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 minutes. Then, 0.5 mmol Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in the above mixture, and then 1mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.5 g of PVP were added in turn and stirred until dissolution. The stirring was continued for another 30 minutes and then the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave for 6 h at 180 °C. After cooling to ambient temperature, the products were washed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 10 h to obtain the precursors. Finally, the above-mentioned precursors were annealed in air at 350 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to obtain the final products (CuCo2O4/RGOx, x = 6, 12, and 24 mg). Porous hollow micro-spherical CuCo2O4 was also prepared according to the above method, without adding graphene.
2.4. Preparation of different counter electrodes
A certain amount of compound (CuCo2O4/RGOx) was uniformly mixed with an appropriate amount of ethyl cellulose. Moderate terpineol was added as the dispersant and 10 mL of ethanol was used as the solvent. After complete grinding until the ethanol volatilized completely, the paste of the CE was obtained. The obtained slurry was coated on the pre-cut and cleaned FTO by the screen printing technique. Subsequently, the obtained CE films were dried on a 60 °C heating plate. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, they were placed in a muffle furnace and annealed at 320 °C for 30 min to obtain CuCo2O4/RGOx (x = 0, 6, 12, and 24 mg) CE materials.
2.5. Assembly of QDSSCs and symmetrical cells
The QD-sensitized photoanode and CE are assembled into a sandwich solar cell. Both ends are sealed with clips and the gap between the two electrodes was injected with about 40 μL of polysulfide electrolyte that was prepared by mixing 1 M Na2S, 1 M S and 0.2 M KCl in an anhydrous methanol–deionized water solvent with a volume ratio of 3:7. In addition, a symmetrical cell consists of two identical CEs sandwiched together and the gap between the electrodes was filled with the polysulfide electrolyte. The effective area of the solar cell is 0.12 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, hollow spherical CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/RGOx were synthesized by simple solvothermal and calcination methods. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram describing the preparation of CuCo2O4/RGO composites. 
The measured high-quality X-ray diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 2a. They indicate that the sample has definite diffraction peaks attributed to the cubic spinel CuCo2O4 (JCPDS No. 80-1532). The main diffraction peaks appearing at 18.98°, 31.20°, 36.83°, 38.53°, 44.84°, 55.50°, 59.30°, 65.27°, 77.49° and 78.64° correspond to the crystal planes (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440), (533) and (622), respectively. No characteristic peaks of other impurities are observed, which indicates that pure CuCo2O4 was successfully fabricated. Besides, the XRD images of the composites show a weaker broad peak at about 26.30°, which should be caused by RGO. With the increase of the graphene concentration, the peak intensity of the hybrid gradually strengthened. In order to further prove the successful synthesis of CuCo2O4/RGO, Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural information of the sample. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the two Raman modes at 1359 cm−1 and 1588 cm−1 should belong to the D-band and G-band of GO31 and the four peaks emerging for the CuCo2O4/RGO12 sample should be severally assigned to the Eg, F2g, F2g and A1g modes of CuCo2O4.20 Moreover, the relative peak intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the D-band and G-band in GO is 0.97, while the value of ID/IG in CuCo2O4/RGO12 is 0.99, which demonstrates the formation of RGO. The above analysis confirms that pure CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/RGO composites were successfully prepared.

SEM is utilized to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the obtained products. As depicted in Fig. 3a and b, CuCo2O4 presents a clear and similar spherical morphology, with a diameter of about 110–240 nm. At the same time, it can be seen that the structure of a CuCo2O4 nanosphere surface shell is rough and porous, which is formed by the accumulation of many tiny nanoparticles. In addition, ultrasonic dispersion leads to shell fragmentation of some spheres (as shown in the red circle area in Fig. 3b), which can prove that the interior of the CuCo2O4 nanospheres is hollow. This unique hollow porous structure with a rough surface has the advantages of low density, large specific surface area and good shell permeability, which can reduce the activation energy of electronic transmission, shorten the path of electrolyte ion diffusion, and improve the catalytic performance of the material.12 Furthermore, Fig. 3c and d show a high-resolution SEM image of the CuCo2O4/RGO12 composite. Obviously, the CuCo2O4 hollow microspheres are evenly distributed on the graphene conductive scaffold, which reduced the agglomeration of CuCo2O4 nanospheres to some extent. Due to the high structural flexibility, excellent electrical conductivity and large surface area of graphene, the obtained CuCo2O4/RGOx hybrid, as the CE material, provides a variety of ways for electron transfer and increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, further enhancing the performance of the cell.

TEM characterization was used to further verify the internal structure of the samples. Representative low-resolution TEM images are shown in Fig. 4a and b. Clearly, the contrast between the darker nanoparticles and the brighter hollow structure further indicates that CuCo2O4 has a porous hollow spherical structure with a diameter in the range of 110–240 nm, which is consistent with the SEM results. Meanwhile, as observed from Fig. 4b, a good direct contact exists between CuCo2O4 hollow microspheres and graphene nanosheets. This structure is conducive to combining the high catalytic activity of CuCo2O4 and the high carrier mobility of graphene sheets at the same time, which accelerates the kinetics of the reaction and thus improves the performance of the device. Additionally, the high-resolution TEM image of the composite is shown in Fig. 4c. Apparently, the sample exhibits distinct lattice fringes, and the lattice spacing values of 0.283 nm and 0.354 nm correspond to the (220) crystal plane of CuCo2O4 and the (002) crystal plane of RGO, respectively.

The composition of the sample is further tested by EDS. From Fig. S1b–e,† it can be judged that the elements Co, Cu, O, and C are evenly distributed in the product. Simultaneously, the signal peaks of Co, Cu, O and C elements can be clearly seen from the EDS diagram of the sample (Fig. S1f†), which further proves the successful preparation of the material. This echoes the results of the XRD and Raman tests. Besides, the cross-sectional picture of the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE obtained by the screen-printing technology is shown in Fig. 4d. It can be clearly observed that the thickness of the film is about 3.22 μm.
Applying X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to deeply analyze the composition and elemental valence of the products. The full spectrum picture of the sample (Fig. S2†) shows strong signal peaks of C 1s, Co 2p, Cu 2p and O1s, which proves the existence of C, Co, Cu, and O in the material. Among them, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s in Fig. 5a delivers three peaks at 284.2 eV, 284.9 eV and 287.9 eV, which are attributed to CC, C–O and CO, respectively. In addition, as shown in the XPS image of Co 2p in Fig. 5b, the main diffraction peaks at 779.9 eV and 795.0 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, and the distance between the two peaks is 15.1 eV, indicating that Co(II) and Co(III) exist at the same time. The fitting peaks appearing at 779.6 eV and 794.5 eV show the existence of Co(III), and the peaks at 782.1 eV and 796.2 eV prove the presence of Co(II).24 The peaks located at 803.5 eV and 789.3 eV are assigned to the shake-up satellite peaks. Simultaneously, in Fig. 5c, it can be observed from the Cu 2p spectrum that the peak signals appearing at 933.9 eV and 953.8 eV severally point to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2. The peaks at 940.8 eV, 943.1 eV and 961.8 eV are related to the satellite peaks of Cu(II). In Fig. 5d, the diffraction peak at 529.6 eV is relevant to the metal–oxygen bond (Co–O and Cu–O), while the peak at 531.1 eV is mainly caused by the bound water on the sample surface. The results of these analyses further prove the successful synthesis of the sample.

We assembled the CdS/CdSe-sensitized QDSSCs with different counter electrodes to test the photovoltaic performance under the same conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 6a, the important photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) are visually displayed in the curve, while the fill factor (FF) and PCE need to be calculated. The detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, a QDSSC equipped with the CuCo2O4 CE provides a PCE of 6.19% with Jsc = 21.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.60 V, and FF = 0.47. When an appropriate amount of graphene is added as a conductive enhancer and supporting substrate, the catalytic performance of the CE can be enhanced and the photovoltaic performance of the cell can be improved. Therefore, the QDSSC based on the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE exhibits the highest PCE of 7.04% (Jsc = 22.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61 V, and FF = 0.51), whereas when the mass of RGO increases to 24 mg, the current density reduces. We suspect that this may be due to the accumulation of graphene sheets, resulting in the obstruction of electron transport. The influence of various CEs on the performance of QDSSCs was further investigated by the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) test. As depicted in Fig. 6b, due to the use of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode, the QDSSCs based on different CEs revealed the same spectral response range (400–650 nm) whereas compared with other QDSSCs, the QDSSC based on the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE exhibits better IPCE characteristics, demonstrating that the cell has a higher Jsc. Additionally, the changing trend of the IPCE curves is highly consistent with the J–V plots. The above results further prove that the spinel oxide CuCo2O4 has great potential to act as the CE of QDSSCs, and the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE shows excellent catalytic activity for polysulfide electrolytes. As far as we know, compared with the CdS/CdSe-modified QDSSCs based on other CEs reported in the previous literature, the QDSSCs assembled from CuCo2O4/RGO12 CEs deliver outstanding photovoltaic efficiency (see Table S1†). Simultaneously, in order to explore the start-up speed of QDSSCs under illumination, we conducted on–off tests on different QDSSCs, respectively. Fig. 6c shows the current changes in sandwich QDSSCs under alternating light and dark conditions. Obviously, when illuminated, the photocurrent density of QDSSCs based on different CEs changes abruptly and remains relatively stable, indicating that the devices have a fast start-up rate and inferior electron–hole recombination kinetics. With the increase of GO quality, the current density first increases and then decreases, which is in accordance with the J–V curves. Besides, a statistical histogram of the device performance is presented in Fig. 6d. The statistical results clearly show that CuCo2O4/RGO12-based QDSSCs have good repeatability.

The electrochemical performance of the electrode material is also inextricably linked with its specific surface area (SBET), pore volume, etc. Therefore, we conducted a nitrogen desorption–adsorption isotherm test on the synthesized samples. Fig. 7 shows the BET plots of the products and the inset shows the pore size distribution. Obviously, both the hollow porous micro-spherical CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/RGO12 present the shape of the IV(a) isotherm, indicating that the material has a mesoporous structure. Because of the delayed aggregation of the adsorption branch, CuCo2O4 appears in the H1-type hysteresis loop, while CuCo2O4/RGO12 generates the H2(b)-type hysteresis loop resulting from the mesh effect. The detailed parameters are presented in Table 2. The data show that the SBET of our synthesized CuCo2O4 nanomaterial can reach 77.12 m2 g−1, the pore volume is 0.23 cm3 g−1, and the average desorption pore size is 12.38 nm. After adding moderate graphene, the SBET of the CuCo2O4/RGO12 composite is as high as 135.01 m2 g−1 and the pore volume and pore diameter are 0.41 cm3 g−1 and 7.81 nm, respectively. As is well-known, a larger specific surface area can provide more catalytically active sites, and a bigger pore volume is more conducive to the storage and transportation of the electrolyte in QDSSCs. Therefore, the QDSSC equipped with the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE exhibits outstanding cell performance. Simultaneously, the results also prove that CuCo2O4 is a promising CE material for QDSSCs.

The performance changes of the cell assembled with different CEs are mainly caused by the diverse electrocatalytic performance of the CE. In order to explore the electron transport performance and electrocatalytic activity of the CEs, we tested and analyzed the EIS, Tafel curves and CV plots of the symmetric cells. EIS is conducted in the frequency range of 10−1–105 Hz and the amplitude is 10 mV. The ZSimDemo software is utilized to fit the curves and the illustrations are the equivalent circuit diagram of the device and the partially enlarged diagram of EIS. As shown in Fig. 8a, the Nyquist diagrams of different CEs are all composed of two semicircles. Among them, in the high frequency region, the value of the intersection of the curve and the horizontal axis represents the series resistance (Rs) of the cell. The small semicircle denotes the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrode and the electrolyte, which usually plays a decisive role in cell performance. Cμ is the chemical capacitance at the CE/electrolyte interface. The semicircle located in the low frequency region is defined as the diffusion resistance (Zw) of the electrolyte. The EIS analysis results are listed in Table 3. Distinctly, CuCo2O4/RGO12 exhibits a smaller Rs value (2.502 Ω) compared to other CEs, which indicates that its series resistance is smaller and the electron transport performance is better. Besides, the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE also shows the smallest Rct (0.070 Ω), which reveals the smallest charge transfer resistance between the CE and the electrolyte, thus showing the highest electrocatalytic activity. However, when the amount of graphene increases to 24 mg, the Rct value of the CE increases to 0.430 Ω, leading to the decline of its electrocatalytic performance. This may be due to the deterioration of its structural flexibility caused by the accumulation of a large number of graphene sheets, resulting in great resistance to electron transport. And this result further confirms the change in the current density in the J–V curves. Simultaneously, the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE has a higher Cμ value (73.99 mF), revealing that the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE possesses a larger active area for the catalytic reaction of Sn2− to S2−, and the smaller Zw (0.118 Ω) of CuCo2O4/RGO12 proves that rapid ion diffusion exists at the interface between the CE and electrolyte.35 The electron lifetimes (τ) of the different CEs participating in the reduction reaction can be obtained according to the formula τ = 1/2πfmax. The corresponding Bode diagram in Fig. 8b shows that, compared with the pure CuCo2O4 CE, the addition of graphene makes the characteristic peak of CuCo2O4/RGOx move significantly to a higher frequency, resulting in a decrease in the τ value. This indicates that the introduction of an appropriate amount of graphene can accelerate the reduction reaction rate at the interface through a synergistic effect with CuCo2O4, thereby increasing the cell efficiency.36

The Tafel test is used to further evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the CE. The curves and the corresponding parameters are shown in Fig. 8c and Table 3, respectively. The results show that the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE has the highest exchange current density (J0 = 21.478 mA cm−2), indicating its high electrocatalytic activity. With an increase in the graphene concentration of the composite, J0 shows a trend of increase first and then a decrease. Admittedly, J0 is inversely proportional to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and satisfies the relationship J0 = RT/nFRct (R, T, n, and F represent the gas constant, temperature, number of electrons, and Faraday constant). Therefore, the variation trend of J0 is consistent with the results of EIS analysis. Moreover, the limiting current density (Jlim) can be used to measure the diffusion rate of electrolyte ions, and its diffusion coefficient D and Jlim conform to the formula Jlim = 2nCFD/l. It can be observed that the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE has the highest Jlim value, which clarifies that its ion diffusion rate in the electrolyte is the fastest, and also proves that it has the strongest catalytic activity for the electrolyte. Besides, the change rule of the Jlims of different CEs is consistent with that of J0. This indicates that when moderate graphene, acting as a supporting frame, is combined with CuCo2O4 hollow microspheres, the mobility of charge carriers and the catalytic reduction reaction are promoted due to the structural flexibility and good electrical conductivity of graphene. The interfacial charge recombination mechanism of QDSSCs is studied by the open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) test. In the experiment, the light is turned off under steady state conditions to measure the decay of Voc. Fig. 8d shows the voltage decay curves of the QDSSCs based on different CEs. Obviously, the curve of the QDSSC assembled with the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE decays rather slowly compared with other CE based QDSSCs, indicating that the device has a lower charge recombination rate and a longer electron lifetime, which is beneficial for the improvement of QDSSC performance.
Furthermore, the stability and electrocatalytic performance of the CE in the polysulfide electrolyte can also be measured by CV. As shown in Fig. 9a and b, through the multi-cycle CV measurement of the symmetrical cell, we find that none of the pure CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/RGO12 composite CEs show a significant drop in the current density or a great change in the curve shape, demonstrating that the stability of the CEs in the electrolyte is excellent. The illustration shows only the CV curves of the 1st and 30th cycles of the material. For the single-cycle CV test, a three-electrode system, with Pt and the SCE as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, is used in the polysulfide electrolyte. Obviously, from Fig. 9c and d, it can be seen that the CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE accomplishes the largest reduction peak current density and the smallest peak-to-peak separation (0.448 V), indicating that it has the highest electrocatalytic activity, which is consistent with the results of EIS and the Tafel test.37 Consequently, the addition of moderate graphene can further enhance the conductivity of the material and reduce the agglomeration effect of nanoparticles, thereby improving the stability of the material and the conversion efficiency of the device.

4. Conclusions
In short, nanoporous, hollow microspherical CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/RGO composites were successfully prepared by facile solvothermal and post-calcination methods and were first utilized as CEs for QDSSCs. Electrochemical characterization and other tests all indicate that the CuCo2O4 and CuCo2O4/RGO composites exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and stability. The QDSSC assembled with the CuCo2O4 CE exhibits a higher PCE of 6.19%. Nevertheless, combining the superior electrocatalytic activity of CuCo2O4 and the large specific surface area, high conductivity and structural flexibility of graphene, the QDSSC based on the optimized CuCo2O4/RGO12 CE achieved a PCE of 7.04% with Jsc = 22.83 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.61, and FF = 0.51, which is higher than those of many reported CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs. This research study opens up a new field for the application of spinel oxide and shows that nanoporous hollow micro-spherical CuCo2O4/RGO composites are promising CE materials for QDSSCs.
