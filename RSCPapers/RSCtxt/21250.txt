    , Accepted 10th February 2019First published on 12th February 2019AbstractThe insufficient utilization of sunlight has been a big obstacle preventing inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) from achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) are developed to achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 80% to effectively convert harmful UV light into useful visible photons for improved solar cell efficiency. It is found that the N-GQD material is very stable against humidity and under high temperature stress. When it is deposited on the top of the γ-CsPbI3 PSCs, it serves as an energy-down-shift (EDS) layer to harvest light in the short wavelength range <350 nm that is normally detrimental to the perovskite. Compared with the reference cell without the N-GQDs, the optimized PSC exhibits an increased short circuit current density (JSC) of 19.15 mA cm−2 from 18.67 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 16.02% from 15.53%. Further examination of the EQE, PL and UV-vis absorption spectra confirms that the improvement in the device performance does indeed result from the N-GQDs. The present strategy paves the way for rational design to improve the performance of other novel photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Thanks to their appropriate band gap, strong light absorption, amazing tolerance to defects and straightforward low-temperature solution processing, organic–inorganic halide perovskites have become a superstar in photovoltaic applications with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) being rapidly increased from 3.8% to 23.3% in just a few years.1–6 Unfortunately, their poor stability under high temperature and high humidity conditions still prevents their large-scale commercialization.7–12 Therefore, more and more researchers have focused on all-inorganic perovskites that show superb light-soaking and thermal stabilities.13–18 Regrettably, inorganic perovskite materials are too sensitive to humidity, with generally lower solar cell efficiency. Therefore, there have been increasing efforts to further improve the stabilized PCE.19–24
Among all Cs-based PSC materials explored to date, the cubic CsPbI3 phase (α phase) shows a more desirable band gap of approximately 1.72 eV as a light harvesting material.25,26 Nevertheless, its low photocurrent density, and therefore limited PCE, is a shortcoming hampering its performance and preventing commercial application.27–29 As it is very difficult to decrease the band gap of the material for improved sunlight harvesting efficiency,30,31 very recently, an effective strategy was developed by distorting the cubic phase structure into its γ phase, leading to a reduction in Eg to 1.68 eV.32,33 Another method to improve sunlight utilization34–36 is to use an energy-down-shift (EDS) layer to convert the harmful UV light into desirable visible light for improved cell efficiency and UV stability.37,38
There has been interesting work using polymers,39 carbon dots,40 fluorescent phosphor,41 and inorganic quantum dots (QDs)42–44 as EDS materials in solar cells and other optoelectronics. For example, Jalalah et al. explored CuGaS2/ZnS QDs with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 75%.38 Wang et al. reported a CsPbCl3:Mn EDS layer with PLQY ∼ 60% and successfully applied it in PSCs.42 However, the CsPbCl3:Mn EDS film degrades in the presence of humidity or at high temperature. Unfortunately, most of these materials show low PLQY, significant self-reabsorption losses, and low stability.45 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a stabilized EDS layer with higher PLQY.46–48 Graphene and its derivatives have demonstrated stable and adjustable performance.49–51 Herein, a nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot (N-GQD) material was synthesized with a PLQY as high as 80% and remained chemically unchanged in a 50% room humidity or high-temperature environment due to its stable chemical bonds. It is found that it has strong absorption (the absorption coefficient is 0.25 L g−1 cm−1) in the UV spectrum and large emission at visible wavelengths. When it was used in the γ-CsPbI3 PSCs, both the short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE were significantly increased by as much as 2.57% and 3.15%, respectively.
Results and discussion
N-GQDs were prepared by dissolving 0.2 g o-phenylenediamine in 20 mL alcohol (100 mg mL−1). The solution was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. The obtained light-yellow solution was added to 50 mL water for dialysis (100 Da) for 3 days to produce 5 wt% N-GQDs. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the N-GQDs is shown in Fig. 1a. Homogeneous dots can be observed. The lateral size of the N-GQDs is 1–8 nm (inset of Fig. 1a) and the average lateral size is 3.8 nm. A high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image of a single QD sample (Fig. 1b) shows a typical 0.24 nm lattice spacing in the crystalline structure, which can be attributed to the (110) diffraction planes of graphene.43,52 The fast Fourier transform (FFT, Fig. 1c) of the N-GQDs shows a standard six-fold symmetry, demonstrating a good crystalline structure. Fig. 1d and e display a representative AFM image and a plot of height versus position of highly dispersed N-GQDs after spin-coating on the SiO2 substrate. The thicknesses of the N-GQDs are approximately 0.5–1.0 nm, or 2–4 layers.43

The inset shows a photograph of the 1.0 mg mL−1 N-GQD aqueous solution under 365 nm UV light; (g) PL decay curve; (h) FT-IR spectrum; (i) Raman spectrum. 

Fig. 1f and g show the UV-vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the N-GQD aqueous solution. It is clear that the N-GQDs show an obvious absorption peak at 255 nm due to the π–π* transition of aromatic sp2 domains.53 The emission peak of the N-GQDs is centered at 585 nm with a quantum yield (φ) as high as 80%, much higher than those of most reported EDS materials. Indeed, the N-GQDs emit bright yellow PL under UV light (inset of Fig. 1f). The PL decay of N-GQDs is measured using a time-correlated single photon counting technique and fitted well with a single-exponential decay model. As shown in Fig. 1g, The PL lifetime (τ) of the N-GQDs is 1.3 ns with a radiative rate (κr, κr = φ/τ) of 5.4 × 108 s−1.54
Systematic structural characterization of the N-GQDs was carried out. Fig. 1h shows the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of the N-GQDs. The peaks at 2500–3500 cm−1, 1610 cm−1 and 1150 cm−1 are attributed to the –OH/NH2 groups and lattice doped N atoms, respectively, demonstrating the presence of oxygen/nitrogen-containing functional groups. Fig. 1i shows the Raman spectrum of the N-GQDs with three primary peaks. The intense defect-related D-peak and G-peak are located near 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1, respectively, while the 2D-peak at ∼2700 cm−1 is suppressed. The peak intensity ratio of the D to G peak (ID/IG) is calculated to be approximately 0.32. The low ID/IG of the N-GQDs may be due to the surface groups and heteroatoms in the N-GQDs.
The X-ray photoemission (XPS) survey spectrum of the N-GQDs (Fig. 2a) shows a predominant graphitic C 1s peak at 285.0 eV, an O 1s peak at 531.7 eV and an N 1s peak at 400.0 eV.55 The doping concentration of the N-GQDs is 5.2 at%, demonstrating successful incorporation of N in the GQDs. For more details, deconvolutions are performed on all the high-resolution XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 2b, four characteristic curves are observed in the XPS spectrum of C 1s, i.e., the C–C/CC peak at ∼285.0 eV, the C–OH/C–NH2 peak at ∼285.8 eV, the lattice-doped N peak at ∼286.8 eV and the CO peak at ∼287.6 eV.56 The C 1s results coincide with the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2c). The peaks located at 399.3 eV, 400.8 eV and 401.4 eV can be attributed to the C–NH2 (surface/edge groups), pyridinium N and NN, respectively.57 The corresponding structure diagram of N-GQDs is shown in Fig. 2d.

Photographs taken under visible light and 365 nm UV light of the samples with different numbers of N-GQD EDS layers deposited on FTO glass are shown in Fig. 3a. Here, the PL spectrum of N-GQDs in the solid state shows a blue-shift compared with the N-GQD aqueous solution. The blue-shifted emission wavelength can be due to the aggregate of N-GQDs with delocalized electrons (π-conjugated system) in the N-GQD film.58,59 With increasing number of N-GQD EDS layers (0, 1, 2 and 3), the color of the FTO glass does not change significantly under visible light, but its transparency declines. With excitation by 365 nm light, the N-GQD EDS films exhibit the strongest yellow emission and the luminance gradually increases going from 1 to 3 EDS layers. Fig. 3b and c illustrate the absorption and emission spectra of N-GQD EDS films with different numbers of layers on FTO. As expected, as the number of layers increases, the N-GQD EDS films have increased absorption at UV wavelengths from 300 to 450 nm compared with the transparent FTO glass.60 However, if the N-GQD EDS layer is too thick, it could show obviously higher light scattering compared to the reference surface.42Fig. 3c shows the enhancement of the PL intensity of N-GQD films at 530 nm with increasing layer number under excitation at 375 nm. These results are consistent with the EDS-QD layer converting the normally wasted energy in the ultraviolet (UV)-light into visible light to be absorbed more efficiently by PV cells.40,61

The moisture stability and thermostability of the N-GQD EDS film and the reported CsPbCl3:Mn QD EDS film are presented in Fig. 3d and e. After 10 days under 50% relative humidity (RH), the N-GQD EDS film shows nearly no degradation: the PL intensity of the N-GQD EDS film remains above 90% of its original value, whereas the value of the CsPbCl3:Mn QD EDS film decreased to only 10%. The thermostability of the EDS films after 10 days at 80 °C in a N2 atmosphere is also shown: the PL decreased very quickly for the CsPbCl3:Mn QD EDS film.62 By contrast, no significant change is observed for the N-GQD EDS film. Therefore, gratifyingly, the N-GQD EDS film exhibits superior moisture stability and thermo-stability.63

Fig. 4a shows a schematic diagram of the fabricated device structure: N-GQD EDS/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass/TiO2/γ-CsPbI3/poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine] (PTAA/Au). Herein, the N-GQDs were synthesized by the biomass “bottom-up” method and deposited on the front side (transparent side) of the PSCs. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs coated with different numbers of layers of N-GQDs are measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global solar irradiation (AM 1.5G). Fig. 4b shows that the optimized N-GQD/γ-CsPbI3 PSC achieves a PCE as high as 16.02%, while the reference γ-CsPbI3 PSC gives only 15.53%. The key parameters of the PSCs with different N-GQD EDS layer thicknesses are summarized in Table 1. With increasing number of N-GQD EDS layers up to 2, the JSC of the PSCs significantly increases, which may result from the effective utilization by the N-GQD layer of what is normally parasitic absorption. With further enhancement of the number of N-GQD layers to 3, the performance starts to decrease, which may be caused by increased scattering of visible light as the N-GQD EDS layer becomes too thick, as mentioned above. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the fill factor (FF) of the PSCs are remarkably unchanged, indicating that the effect of the N-GQDs is mainly on light absorption.

The measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PSCs with different N-GQD EDS layer thicknesses increases in the range from 350 to 450 nm, and the integrated JSC in Fig. 4c shows the same trend as the JSC obtained by I–V measurements. Compared with the reference PSCs, the optimized performance with the greatest enhancement of EQE is found for the cells coated with 2 layers. The improvement of EQE in the UV region leads directly to the increase in JSC by coating with an EDS layer. To further confirm the reproducibility, 40 individual devices are fabricated, and their PCE distribution histograms are shown in Fig. 4d. The PCEs have a narrow distribution, indicating that both the reference and optimized PSCs show very good reproducibility.64 The typical J–V curves of the champion performing device measured in both the reverse and forward scan directions indicate a stabilized conversion efficiency of 16.02% with negligible hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 4e, with the key parameters summarized in the inset. We also record the PCE and JSC as a function of time for the best performing N-GQD EDS/γ-CsPbI3 PSC, as shown in Fig. 4f. Measured while biased at 0.9 V for 120 s, the PCE of the fabricated PSC remains essentially constant, and the value is very close to that obtained by the direct J–V measurements. Therefore, the introduction of the N-GQD EDS layer on the γ-CsPbI3 film directly improves the JSC of these solar cells.38
To explore the optical properties of the N-GQD EDS layer on a γ-CsPbI3 PSC, we first evaluate the absorption spectra of the γ-CsPbI3 and N-GQD EDS/γ-CsPbI3, as shown in Fig. 5a. The light-harvesting abilities of the γ-CsPbI3 and N-GQD EDS/γ-CsPbI3 films are roughly similar for the ultra-thin N-GQD EDS layer. In addition, we measure the J–V curves of γ-CsPbI3 PSCs with and without an N-GQD EDS layer under illumination by different lasers with outputs at 385 nm and 515 nm. The light capturing ability at the different wavelengths is evident from Fig. 5b and c. Fortunately, we find a huge improvement in JSC with the N-GQD EDS layer under 385 nm UV light, while the JSC does not change substantially in the visible region (515 nm). All these encouraging results are mainly attributed to the N-GQD EDS layers, which provide both excellent photo-stability and simultaneous absorption of ultraviolet light.65 To confirm that the N-GQD layer can enhance the device UV-stability, the results are given in Fig. S1.† Clearly, the PSC without the EDS layer maintains about 95% of its initial PCE after 24 hour irradiation, while the PCE of the device with the EDS layer retains 98%.

Conclusion
In summary, we report an N-GQD material with 80% PLQY and very good long-term UV stability. When used as an EDS layer for γ-CsPbI3 PSCs, significant improvements are observed in the UV region of the EQE, as expected. Higher device performance is achieved with JSC increased by 2.57% and PCE increased by 3.15%. As a result, a high PCE of 16.02% is attained.
