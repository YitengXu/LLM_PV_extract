    , Accepted 26th July 2013First published on 31st July 2013AbstractInterfacial energy level alignment influences several critical organic optoelectronic device characteristics including charge transfer barriers, turn-on voltage, and open circuit voltage (Voc). Introduction of dipolar molecular monolayers on metal oxide surfaces has allowed improvements in device performance as well as fundamental studies of energy level alignment in these devices. We demonstrate that dipolar mixed monolayers can be covalently bonded to zinc oxide (ZnO) through the triethoxysilane chemical attachment scheme, and that these monolayers tune the work function of the ZnO surface over 0.6 eV. We then employ mixed monolayer-treated ZnO surfaces as the electron-selective contact in inverted bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices to determine the correlation between the Voc and the work function of the contact. We find the relationship of −0.14 V eV−1 between the Voc and contact work function is consistent with current results and theories of contact influence on Voc.
Introduction
The issue of energy level alignment at interfaces is fundamental to the performance of organic electronic devices. Interfacial energy level alignment can determine, for instance, charge transfer barriers at contacts, the turn-on voltage of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the open circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells.1–6 Tuning the electronic structure of one or both materials in an interface, through several methods, has allowed energy level alignment at the interface to be studied and manipulated. This has led to both notable device improvements and results that further our understanding of how these devices and interfaces work.2–11
Metal oxides are widely applicable in organic electronics, and have proven to have highly tunable energy levels, making them amenable to energy level alignment tuning experiments. Moreover, the introduction of metal oxides into organic electronic devices has necessitated the study of metal oxide–organic interfaces and their energy level alignment behavior. Metal oxides can be degenerately doped to form transparent conducting oxide contacts such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO). They can be used as the acceptor in hybrid photovoltaic active layers, where their higher carrier mobilities could in principle boost efficiencies over organic-only devices. They can also be used as components of the recombination layer in tandem photovoltaic devices.12–14 One of the most promising applications of metal oxides is as interfacial layers in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices. These interfacial layers are thin films (1–50 nm) that separate a conductive contact from the organic active layer. Interfacial layers can have several functions in the cell, including controlling the compatibility of the contact with the organic, controlling energy barriers to charge transport between the active layer and contact, defining the polarity of a device, and providing a contact with high charge selectivity.15,16
Both bulk and surface approaches have been used to tune metal oxide energy levels at an interface. One bulk tactic is to simply switch between different metal oxides.10 Metal oxides have a variety of different electronic structures, ranging from n-type materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) whose Fermi levels are closer to vacuum (lower work function – WF or φ) to materials with Fermi levels much further from the vacuum level (high φ) such as n-type molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) and tungsten trioxide (WO3) and p-type nickel oxide (NiO).17 Another effective bulk approach is to tune energy levels by varying the composition of an alloy. For instance, ZnO can be alloyed with magnesium oxide (MgO) to tune its bandgap and WF.3 Alternatively, the metal oxide surface can be altered. Surface treatments such as oxygen plasma or ultraviolet ozone cleaning can be used to alter the WF of ITO or ZnO.18–20 However, there are reports that these treatments do not result in a stable surface.19,21 The WF can also be tuned by introducing monolayers of surface-bonded molecules with dipolar functional groups. Such dipolar monolayers were developed on metal and silicon surfaces and transferred to metal oxides.22–25 Many of these layers are stable over time and can produce large changes in φ (of the order 1 eV).21,26 Dipolar functional groups introduce an electrostatic shift between the vacuum level inside the sample and the vacuum level just outside the surface, increasing or decreasing φ depending on the direction of the dipole.27,28 This change in φ (Δφ) can be determined from contact potential difference measurements as discussed in the Experimental section. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the effect of dipoles on interfacial energy level alignment at an idealized interface between a metal oxide and an organic. It is important to note that the dipoles introduced by a modifier originate both through the bond of the modifier to the surface as well as through the modifier's functional group.
 Fig. 1  (a) Energy level alignment at an ideal metal oxide–organic interface (ELC) can be tuned by introducing a dipolar layer at the surface of the metal oxide before depositing the organic. The dipole introduces an electrostatic potential shift to charges crossing the interface, shifting the vacuum level between the metal oxide and organic. The vacuum level shift will either decrease (top left) or increase (top right) the WF (φ) of the metal oxide surface compared to its unmodified state (top middle). The shift in work function (Δφ) can be measured as a contact potential difference. (b) Inverted bulk heterojunction (IBHJ) photovoltaic device (bottom middle) used to demonstrate the effects of tuning energy level alignment at the electron-selective contact/active layer interface. Dipolar monolayers (ML, bottom left and right molecules) can be inserted at the ZnO–P3HT:PCBM interface to shift energy level alignment. 
Dipolar monolayer modification of metal oxides has been employed to demonstrate a number of important results in interfacial energy level alignment experiments. Introducing dipoles at the TiO2 surface through monolayer modification in hybrid TiO2/P3HT solar cells has demonstrated that manipulating energy level alignment between the donor and acceptor directly affects Voc.2 Many studies have focused on tuning the WF of a metal oxide contact. Tuning of the ITO contact in a conjugated polymer diode showed deviation from the Schottky–Mott limit.29 Mixed results have been reported in attempts to change the Voc of organic bilayer solar cells or the turn-on voltage of OLEDs and organic diodes, with some studies showing a strong impact and others showing none at all.1,7,30–35 Interestingly, the study by Khodabakhsh et al. showed a strong dependence of solar cell short circuit current density (Jsc) on contact WF.35 The study by Beaumont et al. suggests that whether Voc changes in bilayer small molecule devices depends on the choice of donor molecule, and the energy of its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).31 In BHJ solar cells, only a few studies of dipolar molecular modification of the contact to the active layer have been published. Ratcliff et al. demonstrated that Voc can be manipulated by tuning the WF of an ITO hole contact.6 The dependence of Voc on contact WF was less than 0.3 V of Voc gained per 1 eV increase in WF (<0.3 V eV−1). The study also found that non-selective ITO contacts give consistently lower Voc than contacts that are expected to be selective such as NiO. Another study employed alkylsilanes of differing terminal groups to tune the work function of ITO in contact with the BHJ active layer.36 The largest work function sample showed the best performance in all of Voc, Jsc, and efficiency and this was attributed to both the contact work function change and surface energy changes from the hydrophobic terminal group. Monolayer modification of the metal oxide interlayer–metal contact interface in a BHJ device showed a strong dependence of device performance on the interface dipole.37
ZnO is a promising metal oxide material for use in organic devices because of its compatibility with solution processing and the fact that its intrinsic n-type doping and band structure make it a good electron-selective layer.38,39 Several families of molecules representing a variety of attachment schemes have been used in molecular modifications of the surface of ZnO including: carboxylic acids, phosphonic acids, thiols, acetylacetonate, and various silanes.1,40–47 In this study, we have chosen to employ monolayers that attach via the triethoxysilane (TES) chemistry developed on ZnO by Allen et al.44 The TES chemistry provides a strong covalent bond to the surface that shows no evidence of etching or multilayer formation as has sometimes been observed in common protic modifiers such as thiols and carboxylic and phosphonic acids.40,45 The ethoxy attachment group provides sufficient reduction in reactivity that the molecules do not readily cross-link or polymerize in the deposition solution as is found with other silanes.44,48
In this report, we verify that the TES modifiers phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) and 4-chlorophenyl triethoxysilane (4CPTES) (Fig. 1(b)) form mixed monolayers on the surface of ZnO with relative concentrations on the surface comparable to their concentrations in the deposition solution. The functional groups of these modifiers have opposing dipoles that push the ZnO WF in opposing directions (Fig. 1(b)). We demonstrate that the WF of the treated ZnO surface can be tuned by 0.6 eV by varying the composition of these mixed monolayers. This report is the first to demonstrate WF tuning of ZnO using a covalent attachment scheme (the TES scheme), and provides further verification of the viability of TES molecules as useful surface modifiers. To explore the effect that tuning the ZnO WF has on devices, we employ our modified ZnO as an electron-selective contact in inverted bulk heterojunction (IBHJ) solar cells with a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) active layer (Fig. 1(b)). The open circuit voltage (Voc) of the device increases as the ZnO WF decreases, with a slope of −0.14 V eV−1. This result is discussed in the context of the current understanding of how the WF of the contact affects the Voc of organic solar cells.
Experimental
40 nm polycrystalline ZnO layers were deposited on glass microscope slides (Fischer Scientific), indium tin oxide (ITO) patterned glass (Thin Film Devices) and gold-on-glass substrates (Platypus Technologies) by the following sol–gel method: a solution of 0.75 M zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.75 M ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol was stirred at 800 rpm on a hot plate at 60 °C for 30 min. After the solution cooled, it was spin coated onto a substrate at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The sample was then annealed at 300 °C for 10 min in ambient air. This method is based on that of Ohyama et al., with modification as discussed by Olson et al.20,49,50
To prepare ZnO surfaces treated with molecules attaching through the triethoxysilane (TES) chemistry, the ZnO samples were first rinsed with toluene and acetone, dried with N2 and UV-ozone cleaned for 15 min to induce surface hydroxylation. The samples were then placed in a solution of TES molecules at 45 °C for 90 min. The solution consisted of 0.072 M n-butylamine and a total of 0.18 M combined of phenyltriethoxysilane (PTES) and/or 4-chlorophenyltriethoxysilane (4CPTES), in toluene. To vary the ratio of PTES to 4CPTES molecules on the surface, the molar ratio of PTES and 4CPTES was varied in solution. The molar ratios used were 1:0 PTES:4CPTES (all PTES), 2:1 (⅔PTES, ⅓4CPTES), 1:2, and 0:1. After soaking, the samples were rinsed with toluene and acetone, blown dry with N2 and placed in a 110 °C oven for 60 minutes. After baking, samples were rinsed with toluene and acetone and dried with N2. This procedure follows that of Allen et al. for attaching TES molecules to ZnO.44 Control samples for the TES treatment were prepared by following the procedures above, except that the molecular modifiers were excluded from the deposition solution. These controls were used as references for PM-IRRAS, Kelvin Probe, and CA measurements and were used to build control IBHJ devices.
Devices for these experiments were fabricated on patterned ITO substrates that were sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each, followed by a 30 min UV ozone treatment. A 40 nm thick ZnO layer was deposited on the ITO by the sol–gel method described above. The ZnO surface was then treated before active layer deposition. For the PTES/4CPTES treated and control devices, the ZnO layer went through the surface functionalization steps as described above and then was rinsed with toluene and acetone, dried with N2, followed by 5 min annealing in air at 100 °C. A standard device was fabricated following an already published procedure for preparing this type of device.39 In this device, the ZnO film was rinsed with DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, dried with N2 and then annealed at 200 °C for 5 min. After the treatment of the ZnO surface, the active layer for all devices was spin-coated from a 50 g L−1 solution of P3HT (Rieke Metals) and PCBM (Nano-C) in a 1:1 ratio by weight in anhydrous dichlorobenzene at 800 rpm with 800 rpm s−1 acceleration for 60 s in a glove box. The wet films were then allowed to dry slowly for 90 min in covered Petri dishes in N2 atmosphere.51 This yielded active layers of thickness ∼245 nm. Clevios™ HTL Solar PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus) was spin-coated on top of the active layer at 2000 RPM for 60 s in ambient air, followed by 5 min annealing at 100 °C in ambient air and subsequent 10 min annealing at 120 °C in a glove box. Silver was thermally evaporated onto the PEDOT:PSS at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1 until 30 nm was reached and at 1 Å s−1 for another 70 nm. Completed devices were annealed in N2 atmosphere at 130 °C for 10 min.
Polarization Modulation-InfraRed Reflectance Absorbance Spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) measurements were performed to verify the presence of functional molecules on the ZnO surface, and determine the ratio of PTES to 4CPTES molecules on the surface. PM-IRRAS provides an extremely surface-sensitive IR absorbance measurement by cancelling environmental noise through polarization modulation of the incident light.52 Measurements were performed on samples on gold-on-glass substrates using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with a Nexus PEM Module. Spectra were taken between 650 and 4000 cm−1. For all samples, the ZnO surface was measured before and after surface modification. The post-modification measurements were divided by the pre-modification measurements to generate an absorbance spectrum.53
Contact angle (CA) measurements were performed using sessile drops of deionized water. The CA images produced were analyzed using the DropSnake algorithm.54
Atomic Force Microscopy images were taken in tapping mode using a Bruker Nanoscope III instrument with high-aspect ratio 125 μm cantilever tips (Nanoworld NCSI). Both topographic and phase information were collected. Roughness analysis of the topography images was performed using Nanoscope 5.30r1 software.
Differences in WF (Δφ) between surface treatments were determined by contact potential difference (CPD) measurements taken in air, in the dark, for samples on gold substrates using a KP Technology SKP5050 Kelvin Probe. The CPD of each treatment was measured with respect to a gold standard. However, the Δφ are reported in reference to the bare ZnO control surface described above, assigned a value of Δφ = 0 meV.
Devices were characterized under an AM1.5 simulated solar spectrum with 100 mW cm−2 illumination intensity and in the dark in an inert environment. An aperture was not used during measurement, so current densities and efficiencies are slightly higher than would be expected. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 236 source meter. Series resistance was calculated from the slope of the J–V curve at open circuit voltage. Light soaking was performed under the same light source by placing the devices under illumination for 20 min. During the light-soaking and subsequent measurements, devices were not temperature-controlled.
Results and discussion
ZnO thin films prepared from a sol–gel precursor were treated with PTES, 4CPTES, and two solutions containing mixtures of PTES and 4CPTES molecules as discussed in the Experimental section above. Fig. 2(a) shows the spectrum, for each treatment, of polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) measurements in the phenyl ring vibration region. The legend indicates the ratio of PTES (P) to 4CPTES (4C) based on their molar concentrations in each deposition solution. Also shown is the spectrum of the control (explained in Experimental section), which was prepared identically to the treated samples except no surface modifiers were included in its soaking solution. Based on the structure of each molecule, the major peaks shown were identified. The peak at 1090 cm−1 was identified as a vibration of the phenyl ring combined with a carbon–chlorine (C–Cl) stretch characteristic of 4CPTES only. The peak near 1130 cm−1 was identified as a ring vibration combined with a carbon–silicon (C–Si) stretch.55 This peak, though present in both PTES and 4CPTES treated samples, falls in intensity with increasing 4CPTES content. The peak is smaller in 4CPTES because the highly electronegative chlorine atom takes electron density away from the atoms involved in the 1130 cm−1 mode, thereby reducing the IR activity of the mode. The presence of these peaks in the spectra of treated samples, but not in that of the control, demonstrates that these peaks can be used as an indicator of the presence of each molecule on the surface. The increase in the 1090 cm−1 peak seen with increasing 4CPTES concentration in the deposition solution and the drop in the intensity of the peak at 1130 cm−1 indicates that the proportion of each molecule on the surface is changing as its proportion changes in solution. This qualitative observation can be made quantitative by using the integrated intensities of these peaks to calculate the fraction of each modifier on the surface. The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 2(b), where the calculated fraction of 4CPTES is plotted against the fraction of 4CPTES in the deposition solution. The details of this calculation are given in the ESI.† The fraction of 4CPTES on the surface increases monotonically with its fraction in solution, with a slope close to one. This demonstrates that the fraction on the surface is comparable to the fraction in solution, within experimental error.

(b) The fraction of 4CPTES on the surface of ZnO based on integrated intensities from the PM-IRRAS measurements of (a), plotted against the fraction of 4CPTES in the deposition solution. 
Water contact angle measurements provided further verification that the molecules were present on the surface. All treatments showed consistently larger contact angles than for the deposition control by at least 10°. In addition, the contact angle fell by 8° as the proportion of 4CPTES increased, indicating that changing the proportion of the modifiers on the surface directly affected the surface energy. The average contact angle measurement for each sample and its uncertainty are given in the ESI.† Atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans showed no difference in roughness between the treated and untreated surfaces. Differences in roughness would be expected if multilayer or island-like agglomerates were present on the treated surface. Phase images also showed a homogenous surface in contrast to observations we have made with molecular treatments that leave agglomerated material or multilayers on the sample.45 AFM phase images and a table of roughnesses can be found in the ESI.† Our measurements of infrared spectroscopy, water contact angle, and atomic force microscopy in combination with previous work on this chemistry provide strong evidence that there is no multilayer or aggregate formation and instead a monolayer has formed on the surface.44,45 It should be noted that this layer is expected to be lower in coverage than a close-packed alkyl chain monolayer.44 The possibility of these molecules cross-linking on the surface may limit the minimum distance between them, reducing the overall coverage and packing.44 Alternatively, the low coverage also suggests possible monolayer defects such as pinholes or uncovered regions.56 There may also be segregation of the two molecular species involved, forming domains of PTES and 4CPTES.57 These defects may have a significant impact on interface electronic properties and on the device as a whole, as discussed below.56
Kelvin probe contact potential difference (CPD) measurements of treated ZnO relative to the bare control were used to determine the differences in work function (Δφ) between the various treatments. These measurements showed that varying the composition of the deposition solution allowed φ to be systematically tuned over 0.6 eV (Fig. 3). As the proportion of 4CPTES increased, the WF of the surface increased as well. This is in direct agreement with our expectations for φ based on the dipole direction of each molecule. In principle, any φ between that of PTES and 4CPTES can be achieved by choosing the correct proportion of the two. It should be noted that the Kelvin probe measures a macroscopic average CPD, and therefore does not detect microscopic variations due to, for instance, segregation of the two molecular species.57 We also note that the relationship between CPD and the composition of a mixed monolayer may not be linear. One interesting unexplored question suggested by our study is whether mixed monolayers might show the non-linear depolarization effects seen when changing the coverage of a single species monolayer.28,56
 Fig. 3  Contact potential difference (relative work function) Δφ of treated ZnO referenced to the bare control surface as a function of PTES and 4CPTES mole fraction in solution. Δφ increases monotonically with increasing 4CPTES proportion, as expected from the different dipole moments of the two molecules. The results presented are representative, and the error bars indicate the reproducibility of a measurement in a particular experiment. 
In order to understand how tuning φ through monolayer modification would affect the properties of a ZnO–organic interface we prepared inverted bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices with the structure shown in Fig. 1(b). In these devices, ZnO acts as an electron-selective contact (ESC), extracting electrons from PCBM and blocking transport of holes in either P3HT or PCBM. We modified the surface of the ZnO with mixed PTES and 4CPTES molecular layers before spin coating the P3HT:PCBM blend. The ratio of PTES to 4CPTES was varied using the same ratios as used in the PM-IRRAS and Kelvin probe measurements. It is important to note that we also constructed two different untreated devices: a standard device and a control device. As discussed above, the control device contains a ZnO surface treated in the same way as the TES modified surfaces, but without including the TES modifiers in the deposition solution. This was the control surface used throughout the PM-IRRAS, Kelvin probe, contact angle, and AFM measurements. The ZnO in the standard device is treated according to a previously published procedure for making IBHJ devices with bare ZnO interlayers.39 Both the control and standard device processing procedures are given in the Experimental section. The ZnO surface in the standard device is optimized for device efficiency, while the control surface is designed to compare surfaces treated identically with the exception of the presence or absence of TES molecular modifiers. The standard and control devices give insight into what effect the surface preparation procedures for TES deposition have on the device performance. Fig. 4 shows representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves under illumination for these devices after 20 min light soaking, while Table 1 gives their photovoltaic parameters. Dark J–V curves can be found in the ESI.† Light soaking was necessary because the devices initially showed a double diode or s-kink (see ESI†). Double diodes are commonly observed in the literature, but are not yet well understood.58–62 Light soaking is an established method of minimizing the influence of the double diode on performance.61,62

The short circuit current (Jsc) showed no trend (over multiple experiments) with respect to modifier proportion. However, Jsc was always less in treated devices compared to untreated devices. From the standpoint of surface energies, the reduced current is counter to what might be expected since the surface energy decreases with treatment, and this should improve the blend morphology near the interface, which has been shown to increase Jsc.46 Some explanations for the lower current are that the modifier molecules may increase surface recombination or traps or introduce a small barrier to charge extraction at the interface. A charge extraction barrier would be consistent with the increased series resistance of treated devices, but its effects may go beyond just resistive losses.
The open circuit voltage (Voc) of the treated devices increases systematically with PTES concentration, increasing on average by 95 ± 12 mV in transitioning from 4CPTES to PTES. While the Voc of all the devices was improved by light soaking, this Voc trend was not affected by light soaking. This indicates that the trend is due to the dipole introduced by the surface modifiers on ZnO. The surface dipole can be understood to affect Voc by changing the energy level alignment between the contact and the active layer. As the work function of the contact decreases, electrons can be extracted at higher and higher energies, increasing Voc. This explanation is supported by computational modeling of bulk heterojunction solar cells.63,64 The variability in fill factor (FF, Table 1) between treatments suggested that there may be recombination processes occurring that could also impact Voc. However, the FF variation can be explained by its correlation with shunt resistance (RSH) according to the equivalent circuit model of the solar cell. RSH does not correlate with Voc in our devices and for this reason cannot contribute to the trend in Voc, but may contribute to Voc overall.
Several other details in the device results are important. First, all of the TES treated devices, as well as the control, have a lower Voc than the standard device preparation. The reason for this is likely the UV-Ozone (UVO) clean used during TES attachment and in preparing the control. This is done to hydroxylate the surface which promotes TES attachment.44 UVO cleaning of ZnO thin films, however, has been shown to induce a dipole unfavorable to electron collection.20 We also note that the work function of the untreated control surface falls between that of the 4CPTES and PTES treated surfaces (Fig. 3) while the Voc of the treated surfaces is always less than for the untreated. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the relative surface dipole between the treated and untreated samples could shift significantly between Kelvin probe measurement and within the active layer, since contact with air (for Kelvin probe measurement) and deposition of the active layer could affect the treated and untreated samples quite differently. It is also possible that the monolayer introduces barriers or traps, leading to increased surface recombination and lower Voc. This explanation is in agreement with the lower Jsc and fill factors observed in treated devices.
Perhaps of more significance is the observation that while the change in Voc with respect to Δφ for the mixed monolayer treatments is linear, the slope is −0.14 V eV−1 (Fig. 5), with the negative sign indicating that increases in Δφ decrease Voc. This result is of interest because the influence of contact WF on Voc in BHJ devices is not well established, especially for situations in which monolayer modification is involved. In organic bilayer devices, the majority of studies suggest that the Voc is essentially uninfluenced by the WF of the contact, and device modeling agrees with these results.31,33,35,63 For BHJ devices, a range of relationships between the contact work function and Voc have been proposed and demonstrated. Some studies have seen a relationship of less than 0.3 V eV−1 which is similar to the result in Fig. 5.4,6 The study by Mihailetchi et al. suggests Voc should depend strongly on the contact work function when injection barriers are high, while it should show a small dependence once the contact work function approaches the HOMO or LUMO of the organic.65 This relationship is supported by the experimental work of Tress et al., which shows that the slope of Vocvs. the HOMO of a hole extraction layer (HHEL) decreases as HHEL approaches the HOMO of the donor.63 Our results are consistent with the model of Mihailetchi et al. and the experimental work of Tress et al. since we observe a shallow relationship of −0.14 V eV−1 while tuning the WF of ZnO, which is near the LUMO of PCBM.16,63,65 The study by Tress et al. also provides a model showing that BHJ devices should show a dependence of Voc on the contact work function. However, the dependence is 1 V eV−1, which does not agree with our results or experimental results in general.63 One possible reason for this is that any charge transfer or reorganization that might occur at the interface is not taken into account in the model. The study by Mihailetchi et al. suggests a low slope is due to charge transfer from the contact into a state in the organic which pins the Fermi level of the contact.65 This explanation is supported by metal oxide and metal–organic interface studies showing such Fermi level pinning at the HOMO or LUMO.8,10 Of course, other factors may influence this slope as well. For instance, the density of states (DOS) of the donor and acceptor have a significant impact on Voc in the active layer, and the DOS may also affect Voc through contact energy level alignment as well.66 The shallow slope of Vocvs. WF may also be explained in our particular case by the quality of our monolayer, something that is not often considered in analyses of monolayer modified organic electronic devices. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) measurements of Au/dipolar monolayer/GaAs interfaces suggests pinholes in the monolayer and the surrounding monolayer domains each give rise to separate Schottky barriers.67 Further experiments suggested that current is funneled through the pinholes and that the pinholes determine the behavior of the interface.56,68 Large pinholes can completely cancel the effect of a dipolar monolayer, while smaller pinholes are affected by the fringing fields of the monolayer. Because our molecular layers are expected to be sub-monolayer in coverage, device characteristics may be affected by pinholes that are not detectable in our macroscopic CPD measurements, and these pinholes could lead to a low Vocvs. WF slope. This may be an issue in other interface modification studies as well. The heterogeneity introduced by a mixed monolayer might impact interface electronic properties as well. Charge transfer may be favored through one species over another and in this case interface properties may not change much with composition. Interestingly, this does not appear to be the case in our results since the mixed monolayers fit the trend between the homogeneous endpoints. More investigation is necessary to determine the relationship between contact WF and Voc, especially in the case of mixed and single species monolayer modification at the interface.

Conclusions
We have successfully attached mixed monolayers of covalently bonded triethoxysilane dipolar surface modifiers to ZnO, as verified by several surface analysis methods. Using these modifiers, we can shift the work function of ZnO over 0.6 eV demonstrating the viability of triethoxysilane as a solution-deposited surface attachment scheme for tuning the work function of metal oxides used in organic electronics applications. We used our monolayer-modified ZnO as an electron-selective layer in IBHJ photovoltaic devices. We demonstrated that the Voc changes systematically as a function of contact work function, in agreement with current models and experimental results for contacts to BHJ organic solar cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Energy level alignment at an ideal metal oxide–organic interface (ELC) can be tuned by introducing a dipolar layer at the surface of the metal oxide before depositing the organic. The dipole introduces an electrostatic potential shift to charges crossing the interface, shifting the vacuum level between the metal oxide and organic. The vacuum level shift will either decrease (top left) or increase (top right) the WF (φ) of the metal oxide surface compared to its unmodified state (top middle). The shift in work function (Δφ) can be measured as a contact potential difference. (b) Inverted bulk heterojunction (IBHJ) photovoltaic device (bottom middle) used to demonstrate the effects of tuning energy level alignment at the electron-selective contact/active layer interface. Dipolar monolayers (ML, bottom left and right molecules) can be inserted at the ZnO–P3HT:PCBM interface to shift energy level alignment.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) PM-IRRAS measurements of ZnO films treated with PTES and 4CPTES in different proportions. The legend indicates the molecular ratios in the deposition solutions based on molar concentration, with P = PTES and 4C = 4CPTES. Two peaks identified as vibrations of the phenyl ring in each molecule are shown. (b) The fraction of 4CPTES on the surface of ZnO based on integrated intensities from the PM-IRRAS measurements of (a), plotted against the fraction of 4CPTES in the deposition solution.	 

 	Fig. 3  Contact potential difference (relative work function) Δφ of treated ZnO referenced to the bare control surface as a function of PTES and 4CPTES mole fraction in solution. Δφ increases monotonically with increasing 4CPTES proportion, as expected from the different dipole moments of the two molecules. The results presented are representative, and the error bars indicate the reproducibility of a measurement in a particular experiment.	 

 	Fig. 4  Representative light J–V measurements of IBHJ photovoltaic devices containing mixed monolayer modified ZnO. Jsc of treated devices shows no trend while Voc falls by 100 mV as the concentration of 4CPTES increases.
