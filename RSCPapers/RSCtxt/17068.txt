    , Accepted 15th January 2020First published on 16th January 2020AbstractCoupling electrochemical CO2 reduction with renewable energy sources is one of the best ways to minimize the carbon footprint in the atmosphere. Viable technology can be designed with the aid of an electrocatalyst which can be easily scalable and selectively reduces CO2 at lower overpotentials, i.e. ought to be energy efficient. In this context, we utilised the microwave polyol method to synthesis and systematically tune the oxygen vacancies of an SnO2–CNT composite by varying the particle size. The extent of the oxygen vacancy formed was confirmed with the help of Raman, XPS and EPR studies. The oxygen vacancy has the ability to lower the activation barrier for CO2˙− formation. Oxygen vacancy variation has altered the onset potential and the selectivity towards formate production of SnO2–CNT composites. A distinction in the electrocatalytic activity may arise from the difference in CO2 adsorption and intermediate binding strength and desorption. Among all the catalysts, SnO2–CNT pH-11 stands out with the highest faraday and energy efficiency of 76 and 54% towards formate production at −0.77 V vs. RHE, respectively. This catalyst exhibits an excellent stability and produces 16 mM of formate with ∼60% Faraday efficiency after a long term run of 10 hours.
1. Introduction
The primary source of energy consumption in today's scenario is fossil fuels through which an extensive amount of CO2 is produced as a by-product. The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has reported that the global CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from 387 ppm to 414 ppm in the time span of 10 years. This rising level of CO2 is causing adverse effects on the climate and leads to global warming.1 Hence it is necessary to prevent CO2 emission and also to reduce the CO2 level in the atmosphere. One of the best ways is to convert CO2 into a value added product by electrochemical means.2 Electrochemical reduction of carbon-dioxide can be carried out (i) under ambient temperature and pressure and (ii) product selectivity can be achieved by choosing an appropriate catalyst, potential and electrolyte. Among all the reduction products, formate is preferred over others as it is extensively utilized in the pharmaceutical, leather and steel industries.3 It is a less energy consuming reduction product and hence has a large scope for commercialization. It can be directly used in formic acid fuel cells4 and used as an H2 storage device.5 Since CO2 is a stable molecule, it possesses both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers and so most of the electrodes require a larger overpotential for direct reduction of carbon dioxide which decreases the conversion efficiency. Thus, it is essential to develop an electrocatalyst to make the reduction process industrially viable. An electrocatalyst ought to be selective and should offer a lower overpotential for the CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, it must be low cost, easily scalable and energy efficient. Numerous electrocatalysts like metals Sn,6 metal alloys In–Sn,7 metal oxides SnO28 and hetero atom doped materials (N-doped graphene9) are used for this purpose. Among all of these Sn has been extensively studied because of its abundance, nontoxic nature and low cost along with the fact that the presence of a native oxide layer can improve the selectivity towards formate.10,11 Further many structural modifications like creating size,12 core/shell structures,13 mesoporous,14 grain boundaries,15 structure engineering,16 defect engineering17etc. are employed to improve the efficiency.
Introducing defects especially oxygen vacancies on metal oxide lattices can tune the physical and chemical properties particularly the electronic bonding and band structures of the metal oxides. Due to such a modulation in the intrinsic properties they find wide application in conversion and energy storage devices.18 However, in recent times it has been found that the CO2 activation energy can be lowered with the help of oxygen vacancies and hence it has a profound effect on the catalytic activity of the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Shan Gao et al. proposed a model and correlated the atomic level oxygen vacancies with the carbon-dioxide reduction present in the Co3O4 material.19 Rahman Daiyan et al. revealed that the enhanced activity of m-SnO2 is due to the high oxygen vacancy defects and crystallinity which is enabled by the mesoporous support.20 Zhigang Geng et al. also depicted the enhanced electrochemical reduction of the ZnO nanosheets to CO due to deliberately created oxygen vacancies.21 They adopted a Lamellar inorganic–organic hybrid intermediate strategy, H2 plasma treatment, and flame spray pyrolysis to create oxygen vacancies. Other typical strategies for creating vacancies include hydrogen reduction treatment, active metal reduction, electrochemical reduction, high energy particle bombardment, chemical reduction etc.18 Most of these methods are complicated and adopt sophisticated instruments as well as requiring harsh treatment. Hence, it is quite a demanding and challenging task to create defects in a controlled manner by employing a cost effective and scalable technique. Recently many reports emphasise the utilisation of microwave energy to create defects in the lattice structure of metal oxides. Chang et al. have created oxygen vacancies over TiO2 in a solution of EG and NaOH with microwave irradiation of 125 W for 2 min by using a microwave furnace.22 Similarly Kim et al.23 and Wang et al.24 utilised microwave irradiation to synthesise and introduce defects in graphene–SnO2 nano particles. Hence, microwaves have the potentiality to introduce defects on the lattice structure of metal oxides which can improve CO2 adsorption on catalytic surfaces. It should be understood here that an efficient electrocatalyst after adsorption of CO2 must aid electron transfer or proton migration through optimum cleavage of C–O or C–H bonds and facilitate the product to desorb from the surface without any hurdles. Meyer et al. demonstrated the dependence of SnO2 particle size loaded onto high conductive carbon supports like carbon and graphene with observed activity. They altered the size and demonstrated the dependence towards obtaining optimum binding energy to adsorb CO2 and desorb the product from the electrocatalyst surface.25 Further Arik Kar et al. demonstrated that the extent of oxygen vacancies can be affected by size and shape of SnO2.26 Considering these facts, we made an attempt to synthesise SnO2 and decorate it on acid-functionalised multiwalled carbon nanotubes (a-CNT) with systematic variation of oxygen vacancies by tuning SnO2 particle size with the aid of microwave irradiation. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been utilized to increase surface area, prevent aggregation of metal oxides, and to enhance conductivity and charge transfer between metal oxide and CNT. The adopted polyol synthesis has its own advantage of controlling the particle size without the addition of any surfactant or capping agent along with uniform distribution of the nanoparticle over CNT thus preventing agglomeration.27 It is capable of solubilising almost all kinds of metal halides, nitrates salts and it is one of the best methods for the synthesis of nano-particles over other methods. Further microwave irradiation helped us to create oxygen vacancies and the methodology can be adopted for large scale synthesis as the reaction conditions can be easily optimised. Even though there are reports demonstrating SnO2–CNT as an electrocatalyst towards reduction of CO2, they were all based on different precursors28 or different loadings of SnO2,29 or by introducing heteroatoms on SnO230 or even by varying the functional group present on CNT31 but they required a high overpotential to reduce CO2 and their faraday efficiencies were quite low. Hence, this is the first report that demonstrates a simple protocol of a microwave assisted polyol method to synthesise SnO2–CNT and to embed defects on the SnO2 surface in a controlled manner by varying the size of SnO2. Further variation of oxygen vacancies in SnO2–CNT through size alteration towards reduction of carbon-dioxide particularly to formate was studied in detail by analysing the characteristics of the material, their reaction kinetics etc. This protocol can be adopted to create oxygen vacancies in other metal oxides as oxygen vacancies find a vast range of applications in sodium and potassium ion batteries, photo degradation of pollutants, photochemical CO2 reduction, as an electrocatalyst, supercapacitors, and dye sensitised solar cells.18
2. Experimental method
2.1. Materials used
Acid functionalized MWCNT (Nanoshell, OD = 20–30 nm, length = 10–30 μm, –COOH = 2–4%), SnCl2·2H2O (Merck), NaOH (Merck), glycol (Alfa Aesar) and Millipore water were used. All chemicals used were of analytical grade and were used without further purification or treatment.
2.2. Synthesis of SnO2–CNT
SnO2 decorated CNT were synthesized through a polyol method in a power controlled microwave assisted mode. SnCl2·2H2O was taken as the precursor for SnO2 formation. In detail, a-CNT and SnCl2 were taken in the ratio of 1:1. Prior to their addition, the reducing nature of glycol was tuned by varying the pH with the help of 0.5 M NaOH. Then the reactant mixture was transferred into quartz vessels and was heated in the microwave reactor (Microwave 3000, Anton Paar) at 800 W for 5 minutes. The resultant product was washed several times with distilled water and dried at 80 °C. Then the material was subjected to a calcination step at 500 °C for 2 hours with a ramp of 3 °C min−1 to obtain SnO2–CNT. By following the above procedure four different materials SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11, and SnO2–CNT pH-13 were synthesized just by tuning the pH of glycol to 7, 9, 11 and 13, respectively, by keeping the precursor ratio constant. For comparison, bare SnO2 was synthesized by the same procedure without the addition of CNT at pH = 13. The variation in the synthetic procedure was achieved just by tuning the reaction medium condition (pH) with the help of NaOH and by keeping all other parameters like precursor concentration, volume, microwave power, time etc. as constant.
2.3. Physical characterization
The crystalline phase of the sample was examined with the help of a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (α = 1.5418 Å) from 10–90° at a 0.02° step size and a count time of 0.2 s. Raman was taken using HORIBA LabRAM HR evolution at an excitation wavelength of λ = 532 nm. In order to inspect the surface composition and the chemical nature of the SnO2/CNT, XPS analysis was performed under ultra-high vacuum using a Thermo Scientific MULTILAB 2000 base system with Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The distribution of the metal oxide particles on surface of CNT was analyzed through HR-TEM with a Tecnai G2 F20 S-twin operating at 200 kV (FEI Tecnai F20). The percentage of loading of SnO2 was found using TGA/DTA Instruments (model SDT Q 600). 5 mg of each sample was heated in the range of room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in an air atmosphere. Oxygen vacancies in the samples were analysed by electro paramagnetic resonance by using Bruker EMX Plus operating at 9 × 4 GHz frequency with 100 KHz field modulation at a room atmosphere. The power of the microwave was 10.0 mw with modulation amplitude of 4.0 G.
2.4. Electrochemical measurement

2.4.1. Electrochemical cell setup. 
The electrochemical measurements in this study were carried out with a PSGTAT304N (Metrohm Autolab) workstation using a customized two-compartment cell. The two compartments were separated by a Nafion 117 membrane. The three electrode system, reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode), counter electrode (platinized titanium electrode) and a carbon paper working electrode was used. The catalyst slurry binder was prepared by diluting 5% Nafion solution to 0.5% with the help of deionized water and isopropanol. Further the catalyst was dispersed in the 0.5% Nafion solution to form catalyst ink and 30 μl of the ink was drop casted into a 1 × 1 cm carbon paper to obtain a loading of 0.2 mg cm−2. 50 ml of 0.5 M aqueous KHCO3 solution was used as the electrolyte in each compartment. All the potentials used in this study were converted into RHE scale with the formula ERHE (V) = ESCE (V) + 0.245 + (0.059 × pH). The pH of the electrolyte namely N2 and CO2 saturated solutions was 8.40 and 7.35 respectively.


2.4.2. Electrochemical evaluation studies. 
In order to investigate the catalytic activity of the as synthesised catalyst, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed from −0.1 to −1.2 V in a 0.5 M KHCO3 saturated solution under N2 and CO2 atmosphere at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The low scan rate is employed here in order to eliminate the current contribution from the non-faradaic reactions. Controlled potential electrolysis was conducted at different potentials (chosen from CV) under a CO2 saturated environment for about 5400 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed near the onset potential by applying an AC signal of 0.01 V of amplitude with the frequency range of 100000–0.01 Hz for 100 cycles. Electrochemical surface area (ECAS) was carried out in a non-faradic region of 0.05 to 0.55 V at different scan rates of 30, 100, 170, 220, 240 mV s−1 in a 0.1 M K2SO4 electrolyte saturated with N2.19Cdl (double layer capacitance) was calculated from the slope of the plot Δj (difference between cathodic and anodic current due to double layer charging) with respect to the scan rate. ECAS = RfS, where S = real surface area (geometric area), Rf = roughness factor of the working electrode (Rf = Cdl/22 μF cm−2 for a smooth SnO2 surface).32 EIS and ECAS were carried out in a single compartment cell.

2.5. Product analysis
After each controlled bulk electrolysis experiment, the liquid product was analysed by 1H NMR through an AVANCE III HD, 500 Hz NMR spectrometer (Bruker) in a water suppression mode. In brief, after each experiment, 500 μL of the liquid aliquot was taken in an NMR tube to which 200 μL of D2O (NMR solvent) and 35 μL of phenol (standard) were added. Prior to this, a calibration plot was drawn by taking different concentration of formate in 0.5 M KHCO3 by taking constant 35 μL of phenol. The relative peak area corresponding to each concentration was calculated and plotted against the concentration of formate. The slope of the line was used to calculate the unknown concentration of formate produced during the electrochemical CO2 reduction experiment.33
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material characterization
The typical XRD patterns of the synthesized material are represented in Fig. 1(a). The spectra validate the graphitic nature of the CNT from the sharp centred peak at 2θ = 26.43° and 42.5° which are due to diffraction from the (002) and (110) planes of CNT (JCPDS card, No. 26-1079). All other samples exhibited 2θ peaks at 26.6, 33.3, 37.9, and 51.7 corresponding to the (110), (101), (200), and (211) planes which substantiates the formation of SnO2 with the rutile tetragonal phase (JCPDS No: 41-1445). For the composites, the (110) plane of SnO2 merges with the (002) plane of CNT providing a single peak at 2θ of 26.8° and the C (002) peak appears to be slightly shifted as compared to the bare CNT which demonstrates the interaction between the CNT and SnO2.34 It is observed that SnO2–CNT pH-7 exhibits a broad peak which is pronounced due to nano crystallinity. With an increase in preparation pH the sharpness of the peaks and their SnO2 crystallinity increases. The calculated average crystalline sizes of SnO2 were 4.3 nm for SnO2–CNT pH-7, 4.8 nm for SnO2–CNT pH-9, 6.9 nm for SnO2–CNT pH-11 and 6.3 nm in the case of SnO2–CNT pH-13. The values were calculated by using the Debye–Scherrer formula considering the (211) plane of SnO2 where the influence of CNT is at a minimum. The above said observation testifies that we are successful in tuning the particle size and crystallinity of SnO2 in SnO2–CNT composites with the help of adopted microwave polyol synthesis.

After confirming the composite materials, we utilised one of the versatile tools of Raman spectroscopy to identify the surface related defects in SnO2 and the properties of carbon which are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the peaks at the lower region of the Raman spectra which are the characteristic peaks of SnO2. SnO2 consists of six-unit cell atoms (two tin and four oxygen atoms). The normal lattice vibration modes of SnO2 at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone are given byΓ = 1A1g + 1A2g + 2A2u + 1B1g + 1B2g + 2B1u + 1Eg + 4EuAmong them, A2u and Eu are IR active modes and A2g and B1u are neither Raman active nor infrared active, while the other forms are the Raman active mode. The Raman active modes appear around 498, 631 and 750 cm−1, corresponding to the translational Eg mode, the symmetric A1g and the asymmetric B2g stretching vibration modes of the Sn–O bond which further confirms the presence of the rutile structure of SnO2 with a D4h point group and P42/mnm space group that is consistent with the XRD. The Raman peak around 245–265 cm−1 is the band of the Eu modes. The appearance of the IR active and Raman silent mode in Raman spectra is due to relaxation of the k = 0 selection rule induced through size effect and oxygen vacancies.35 The different kinds of oxygen vacancies like bridging, sub-bridging or in plane oxygen vacancy of SnO2 can also be identified through Raman spectra. Generally, the defect peak of SnO2 around 570 cm−1 is due to the presence of in-plane oxygen vacancies and it will be insignificant in case of the bridging or sub-bridging mode of vacancy.36 Accordingly, the absence of the peak around 570 cm−1 of the as-synthesised SnO2–CNT endorses that the material possesses the bridging mode of the oxygen vacancy. This was again confirmed by the slight shift in the Eg mode of vibration towards lower wave numbers as the Eg mode is sensitive to the bridging mode of oxygen vacancy.37 Hence microwave irradiation has successfully introduced defects in SnO2.

Fig. 1(c) represents two distinct peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1585 cm−1 corresponding to the D band (sp3 hybridised) and G band (sp2 hybridized) of carbon. This indicates the presence of CNT. The intensity of the G band and D band signifies the presence of graphitic carbon and the degree of disorder respectively. The ID/IG is found to be 0.77 for the acid functionalised CNT. This can be attributed to the presence of functional groups on the surface of the CNT. The ID/IG ratio for SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 is calculated to be 0.90, 0.92, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. The increase in intensity shows the presence of foreign particles on CNT which validates the effective decoration of SnO2 on CNT. The shift in the G band of the Raman spectra of the composites as compared to CNT establishes the presence of interaction between SnO2 particles and the surface acid groups of the CNT that occurs via charge transfer from SnO2 to the carbon of CNT.38 After successful conformation of the synthesized material by XRD and Raman, the surface morphology of the as synthesised catalyst was examined through HR-TEM. It is apparently seen from Fig. 2 that SnO2 was uniformly decorated on surfaces of CNT and the size of SnO2 increases with the increase in pH of the reaction medium. Since NaOH is the only variable parameter during the synthesis, it had influenced the nucleation which in turn controlled the particle size growth. The exact size of SnO2 decorated on CNT with change in pH was evaluated for all the catalysts by means of a particle size distribution curve. The particle size of SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 are found to be 3.5, 3.7, 5.2 and 4.4 nm, respectively, which is slightly lower than the calculated particle size from XRD. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern clearly depicts that the SnO2 crystallinity increases with an increase in pH which is well consistent with the XRD. Microwave polyol synthesis has paved a way to tune the oxygen vacancy with a particle size of SnO2 below 10 nm in a controlled and uniform fashion.
 Fig. 2  (a)–(d), show the HR-TEM images of SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 with their corresponding SAED pattern and histogram of particle size distribution. 
In order to understand the surface composition and oxidation state of the elements present, XPS was carried out. The survey spectra of XPS (Fig. S2†) reveal the presence of elements like Sn, O and C with no other impurities among them. Fig. 3(a) depicts the high resolution spectra of Sn 3d that displays two peaks at a binding energy of 487.3 eV and 495.7 eV which correspond to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2. The peak separation between the two peaks is ∼8.4 eV which confirms the presence of Sn in +4 oxidation state.39 The Sn 3d peaks are symmetric with no other peaks at the lower binding energy revealing that the oxygen vacancy does not lead to any change in the oxidation state of Sn. The deconvoluted spectra of O 1s of SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 are displayed in Fig. 3(b)–(e) which exhibit three peaks at ∼531, ∼532 and ∼533 eV corresponding to the presence of lattice oxygen Sn–O, adsorbed oxygen and oxygen vacancies present in the SnO2 material.17,20,40–42 To confirm the presence of oxygen vacancies, EPR spectra were recorded for all the samples and are illustrated in Fig. 3(g). From the EPR, it is apparent that all the samples possess a peak with a g value of ∼2.04 which demonstrates the presence of oxygen vacancies with trapped electrons in it.20,43–46 It is seen that the peak intensity of EPR spectra varies from the sample SnO2–CNT pH-7 to SnO2–CNT pH-13 indicating oxygen vacancy alteration. The percentage of oxygen vacancy was quantified from the O1s spectra and has been shown in Fig. 3(f). The high resolution C 1s spectra from the XPS shown in Fig. S3† can be resolved into four distinguishable peaks namely C–C/CC, C–O, CO and O–CO which appear at ∼284, ∼285, ∼286, ∼290. The presence of C–C and CC confirms the presence of CNT in all the synthesised compounds which is also apparent from the Raman and HR-TEM. It is also observed that both the intensities of C–O and CO vary significantly which confirms that SnO2 anchoring on the surface of CNT takes place through these bonds and we could infer that the amount of SnO2 anchoring varies according to the change in pH. In order to substantiate this fact, thermo-gravimetric analysis was carried out in air atmosphere so as to completely eliminate the carbon material and quantify the exact loading of SnO2. The TGA curve in Fig. 3(h) shows a gradual decrease in weight from room temperature to around 530 °C. This is due to removal of moisture and oxygen functionalities from the CNT material. The sharp decrease in weight around 530 °C is due to the decomposition of CNT. After this temperature, there is no significant loss in the weight. The residual weight can be ascribed to the weight of SnO2.47 Hence the loading of SnO2 on SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 is 56, 52, 65, 76%, respectively. It can be concluded that microwave polyol synthesis is an effective method to decorate metal or metal oxide over surfaces like CNT, graphene etc. In this work, by varying the NaOH concentration we were able to successfully tune the particle size, crystallinity, distribution of SnO2 on CNT and oxygen defect sites as well.

3.2. Microwave assisted formation of SnO2–CNT materials
Polyol synthesis has been used over years to synthesis metal nano particles where polyol itself acts as the solvent and reducing agent. For the synthesis of metal oxides, there must be the presence of water or hydroxyl group along with polyol.48 Here rapid synthesis of SnO2–CNT was achieved by hydrolysis followed by reduction of SnCl2 through the microwave polyol method. Ethylene glycol has been chosen as the solvent medium to absorb microwave radiation strongly as it possesses a higher tan δ value. The tan δ value refers to the ability of a substance to convert microwaves to localized heat.49 Further NaOH helps in ionic conduction and it is believed that dissolved oxygen in basic media helps in oxidizing Sn+2 to Sn+4.50 We propose the formation of SnO2–CNT through the following steps which is similar to the mechanism proposed by Ji-Young Kim group for RuO2 on CNT48 – initially, ethylene glycol forms a chelation with Sn+2. During the microwave heating, Sn+2 undergoes hydrolysis in the presence of water and NaOH which in turn adsorbs on the CNT surface through electrostatic interactions with –CO and other oxygen functional group present on CNT with Sn2+.51 Subsequent microwave heating converts –Sn(OH)2 to SnO2 in basic medium. In this way the acid functionality present in CNT assisted the decoration of SnO2 on CNT. The formation mechanism is supported by FT-IR, XRD and Raman given in Fig. S4–S6.†SnCl2 + C2H6O2 → Sn(C2H6O2)Cl2  Sn(C2H6O2)(OH)2 → Sn(OH)2 + C2H6O2    The effect of synthetic procedure variation and its reflection on material property as well as catalytic activity will be discussed in the forthcoming section.
3.3. Effect of synthetic procedure in tuning size and oxygen vacancies
A microwave frequency of 2.45 GHz is much lower to break a chemical bond. Thus microwaves effectively heat the material through dielectric heating. Dielectric heating occurs through dipolar polarisation and ionic conduction. Microwave synthesis provides rapid and homogenous heating by eliminating thermal gradients, lowering synthesis time and with low contents of by-products.49 In recent years microwaves have been effectively utilised to synthesis inorganic nano materials and their decoration over nano tubes.52 During microwave irradiation, the equilibrium which is present in the solution is disturbed thereby leading to the entropy driven desorption of lattice creating oxygen defective sites on the lattice of SnO2.53 A control experiment was performed by eliminating the microwave irradiation step during synthesis to understand the influence of microwaves in creating the oxygen vacancy. SnO2–CNT without microwave irradiation lacks oxygen vacancies which is confirmed from the O 1s XPS provided in Fig. S7.† Usually the populations of oxygen vacancies are varied by changing the temperature,54 synthetic atmosphere55 or time of exposure of gas46 during synthesis. In particular, the population of oxygen vacancies has a direct relation with the amount of reducing agent employed by adopting a chemical reduction process.56,57 Our case is very similar to that of a chemical reduction method. In our synthetic methodology, we kept all the parameters identical except NaOH and with an increase in the quantity of NaOH (i) the reducing power of ethylene glycol increases leading to the increased number of oxygen vacancies from SnO2–CNT pH-7 to SnO2–CNT pH-13 (ii) stronger alkalinity results which enhances the hydrolysis rate that is responsible for the increase in the particle size when we are raising the pH from 7 to 1358 and (iii) the increased hydrolysis rate increases the water concentration which has the ability to alter the tan δ value and it further alters the microwave absorbing capability of the mixture. Factors like microwave irradiation, tan δ value, amount of NaOH employed and size of SnO2 have in combination helped us to induce and tune the oxygen vacancy systematically in SnO2–CNT composites. This work describes a suitable synthetic procedure to form and decorate SnO2 particles over the surface of CNT with a tuneable size and oxygen vacancy in an environmentally benign method. We extended further to examine their catalytic performance towards CO2 reduction.
3.4. Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate
Electrocatalytic activities of all the synthesized catalysts were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in an inert and CO2 atmosphere and are displayed in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4 it can be seen distinctly that the onset potential of the CO2 reduction reaction is slightly positive for SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9 and SnO2–CNT pH-11 when compared to N2 atmosphere which indicates that CO2 reduction starts prior to water reduction and also suggest that the ability of the adsorption of CO2 on the surface of the developed catalysts has been improved enormously. However, in the case of SnO2–CNT pH-13 and bare SnO2 there is no significant shift in the onset potential in N2 and CO2 atmosphere which reveals both water and CO2 compete with each other leading to a lower catalytic activity on these catalysts. Further, it is observed that the CO2 reduction current densities for all catalysts are comparatively larger than their respective current density observed for N2 solution. This strongly suggests the fact that in CO2 atmosphere the current contribution is from both the CO2 reduction and HER but in nitrogen atmosphere it is solely due to HER. The higher activity observed for all the SnO2–CNT composites as compared to SnO2 is due to improved CO2 adsorption, facile mass transport, improved electrical conductivity and enhanced charge transfer between SnO2 and CNT. Among them SnO2–CNT pH-11 exhibits a higher current density showcasing a better activity which may originate from the observed oxygen vacancy, size and crystallinity in the case of SnO2–CNT pH-11.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammogram recorded in CO2 free (N2 atm) and CO2 atmosphere in 0.5 M KHCO3 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 for (a) SnO2; (b) SnO2–CNT pH-7; (c) SnO2–CNT pH-9; (d) SnO2–CNT pH-11; and (e) SnO2–CNT pH-13. 
For a better understanding of the catalytic behaviour, three similar potentials, the lower overpotential (η), higher η and the middle η with an incremental difference of 150 mV (i.e. −0.62, −0.77 and −0.92 V) were chosen for constant potential electrolysis and conducted for about 5400 s. A plot of current vs. time for all the catalysts is given in Fig. S9(a)–(c)† and the resultant liquid electrolyte after each experiment was analysed through NMR in order to quantify the formed product. It is clearly evident from the NMR result that there is no other reduction product except formate present in the electrolyte. Such an observation confirms the high selectivity of the employed catalyst towards formate production. In this attempt, we were quite focussed in tuning the catalyst towards higher formate production and hence the formation of trace amounts of gaseous products was not quantified. Moreover, Jinli Qiao et al. demonstrated that a similar catalyst of SnOx@MWCNT–COOH has the lowest faraday efficiency of gaseous CO products up to ≥ −1.25 V and 77% faraday efficiency of formate at −1.25 V vs. RHE.31 Partial current density is a parameter that measures the rate of conversion. For an efficient electrocatalyst, the partial current density should be high. Fig. 5(a) and (b) exhibits that the partial current density and formate production increases with an increase in potential which shows a faster reaction rate at higher potentials. It is also evident from the figure that a larger amount of formate (5.60 mM) was produced in 5400 s at SnO2–CNT pH-11 with a higher partial current density of 10.93 mA cm−2 at −0.92 V. The selectivity of the process towards a particular product (here formate) can be measured by using Faraday efficiency and it is a potential dependent factor. It is usually observed that at a lower η, the HER is dominant as hydrogen evolution is both thermodynamically and kinetically favourable, but in a middle η both the HER and CO2 reaction compete with each other and in a higher η, HER prevails due to the mass transfer limitations of CO2. The overall energy utilisation towards the desired product was measured by energy efficiency. Fig. 5(c)–(e) depict the change in the Faraday and energy efficiency of all the catalysts at −0.62, −0.77 and −0.92 V. It is observed that an increase in the Faraday and energy efficiency is observed and the values are concordant with each other. A maximum Faraday efficiency of 76.13% with an energy efficiency of 54.4% was achieved for SnO2–CNT pH-11 at a potential of 0.77 V. Besides, there is an another activity evaluation parameter known as turn over frequency (TOF) which depicts the intrinsic activity per site of the catalyst and is defined as the number of molecules reacting per active site per second (s−1).59 For a catalyst, there is a distinct relationship between the TOF and overpotential and it is inherent property of a superior catalyst with a high TOF value at a lower overpotential.32,60 A plot of TOF with the change in overpotential for the entire composite is displayed in Fig. S10.† It is observed that the SnO2–CNT pH-11 shows a higher TOF of 2.12 × 10−2 s−1 at a lower overpotential of −0.57 V and is considered the best catalyst among all the composites. These observations clearly demonstrate that a change in pH of the precursor medium of the composites has invoked a significant alteration in the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction which may arise from size, loading, and defects present in them.

(c)–(e) Faraday and energy efficiency of the SnO2–CNT composites at different potentials of −0.62, −0.77 and −0.92 V, respectively. Experiments were repeated twice and error bars with standard deviation have been plotted. 
To get extensive knowledge into the difference in the electrocatalytic behaviour and to understand the kinetics of the reduction reaction, we evaluated the onset potential, EIS, ECAS and Tafel, which are shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d) respectively. Fig. 6(a) shows a comparison of onset potentials for all the catalysts prepared in this work. A lower onset potential symbolises that the reduction reaction occurs at lower η which is desirable for an efficient electrocatalyst. It is seen that SnO2–CNT pH-9 exhibits a lower onset value followed by SnO2–CNT pH-11, SnO2–CNT pH-13 and SnO2–CNT pH-7. In order to endorse the onset potential, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were taken and a Nyquist curve was plotted for all the catalysts as shown in Fig. 6(b). From the Nyquist plot, the charge transfer resistance for all catalysts was calculated as 63, 30, 38, and 57 Ω for SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13, respectively. It is clear that SnO2–CNT pH-9 has the lowest charge transfer resistance which implies that it has faster kinetics as compared to other catalysts. The efficient electron transfer in SnO2–CNT pH-9 may be due to facile HER rather than moderate CO2˙− radical formation as the impedance was measured at lower η. Even though this catalyst possesses a lower Rct, its selectivity towards formate production is poor. A similar kind of observation was reported by Jintao Zhang et al. recently for SnO2@N-rGO.32 The inset of Fig. 6(b) shows a Nyquist plot of pure SnO2 which possesses a higher charge transfer resistance of 319 Ω which is too high and the onset is also more negative, which leads to poor catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. As mentioned earlier we particularly tuned the oxygen vacancy of SnO2 which has an ability to alter the electronic structure and from the Nyquist plot it is clear that the content of oxygen vacancies has altered the Rct value. The change in Rct value had further influenced the lower catalytic activity of the SnO2–CNT pH-7 and pH-13 materials. It should also be noted here that the lower onset for CO2 reduction not only favours the facile adsorption or activation of CO2 but also the desorption of products. SnO2 size has a prominent effect in altering the adsorption/desorption energy along with oxygen vacancies. In addition, the factors related to the hydrogen evolution reaction also need to be considered at this juncture as there will always a competition that occurs between H2O and CO2 for the occupation of oxygen vacancies during the reduction reaction which will rupture the catalytic activity of the SnO2–CNT composites.61

(b) Δj vs. scan rate plot recorded in 0.1 M K2SO4 electrolyte in a single compartment cell. (d) Tafel plot of the samples measured in CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution. 
From the TGA results discussed in the earlier section, it is understood that the loading of SnO2 on CNT is different which might influence the difference catalytic activity. Hence it is important to assess the electrochemical active surface area (ECAS) to identify the loading effect of SnO2 on CNT on catalytic activity. Fig. 6(c) shows the calculated ECAS for all the catalysts by plotting a graph between Δj vs. scan rate. The ECAS of SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 are 0.0654, 0.0308, 0.0271, 0.0151 and 0.00780 cm2. The SnO2–CNT composites exhibited 10-fold higher surface areas than pure SnO2. This is mainly due to the presence of large surface area CNT which can accommodate more SnO2 particles over the surface. Among the composites, it was found that there is a decrease in ECAS with an increase in particle size but it does not directly enhance the catalytic activity of CO2 reduction which may be entirely controlled by other intrinsic factors. After careful evaluation, we could infer that the catalytic behaviour of SnO2–CNT must definitely originate from the defect sites. In our previous discussion, the Raman spectra and the resolved O 1s spectrum of XPS and EPR show the presence of oxygen vacancies. The quantified data are shown in Fig. 3(e). There have been many previous reports insisting that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the catalyst may boost CO2 adsorption and activation. The high density oxygen vacant sites with trapped electrons present on the surface of Sn+4 will act as an active site for CO2 adsorption.17 These oxygen vacancies have the ability to stabilise the CO2˙− anion radical making the reaction occur at a lower overpotential.19,20 It should be emphasised here from the previous literature that the stabilisation of the catalyst surface after radical formation would become a hurdle for further protonation. The particle size of SnO2 in SnO2–CNT pH-11 is 5 nm which may provide a moderate binding energy for both adsorption and desorption processes. The impact of the 5 nm particle size of SnO2 in tuning the binding energy was previously established by Meyer and group.25 Hence the superior catalytic activity of SnO2–CNT pH-11 may be due to the increased oxygen vacancies and 5 nm size of SnO2. In order to acquire further insight into their activity, reaction mechanism and the rate determining step, a Tafel plot was drawn for all the catalysts and is shown in Fig. 6(d). Even though there is a difference in the content of the oxygen vacancies, the catalysts SnO2–CNT pH-7, SnO2–CNT pH-9, SnO2–CNT pH-11 and SnO2–CNT pH-13 exhibited a Tafel slope of 133, 134, 126 and 150 mV dec−1, respectively, which is very close to 118 mV dec−1 suggesting that the first electron transfer to form the CO2˙− radical intermediate is the rate determining step. Hence the presence of defects in SnO2–CNT does not alter the rate determining step but affects the formate production. It is understood that the formation of HCOOH over SnO2 surface occurs through two types of intermediates COOH* or OCHO*. There is a difference in the binding nature of these two intermediates. The COOH* binds through the C atom while OCHO* binds through the O atom over the catalyst surface which has the ability to affect the selectivity of the product. In our case, the presence of oxygen vacancies preferentially converts ˙CO2 to the OCHO* intermediate that solely produces formate instead of CO and H2.62 The plausible mechanism for formate production is depicted in Scheme 1. Even though all the catalysts are exhibiting a similar mechanism, a lower Tafel value was achieved for SnO2–CNT pH-11 indicating the faster kinetics of CO2 reduction.20 Hence SnO2–CNT pH-11 is considered as the best catalyst in which HER is suppressed and is evident from the observed faraday efficiency for formate. The presence of oxygen vacancies may influence the stability of the material during electrolysis. It is quite important to access the stability of the catalyst. The detailed procedure of analysis and post characterisation studies like XRD, XPS and EPR of SnO2–CNT pH-11 are given in Fig. S13–S15.† The retention of SnO2 with no traces of Sn/Sn+2 was observed. After confirming the material stability, the durability of SnO2–CNT pH-11 was determined by conducting long term electrolysis at an applied potential of −0.77 V for about 10 hours, which is shown in Fig. 7. The liquid product formed was analysed through NMR at 2 hour intervals. The variation in formate production was shown in Fig. S12.† It was observed that there is a steady increase in formate production with an average faraday efficiency of ∼ 60%. We were able to achieve a higher formate concentration of 16 mM after completion of 10 hours continuous electrolysis. Further the stable current density reveals that the catalyst exhibited an excellent stability for about 10 hours. It is clear from Table 1 that the SnO2–CNT pH-11 with the second lowest onset and Rct exhibits a higher faraday, energy efficiency with a higher amount of formate production, which is due to the following reasons – (i) improved oxygen vacancies of 10% which has assisted in the lowering of the activation barrier for CO2 radical formation, (ii) the SnO2 particle size of 5 nm favours the facile adsorption and desorption process for the intermediate, (iii) the lowest Tafel value of 124 mV dec−1 exhibiting faster kinetics, (iv) a higher TOF value at a lower overpotential, and (v) the higher stability of SnO2–CNT pH-11 for about 10 hours. After confirming the superior activity of SnO2–CNT pH-11, the activity compared with already reported SnO2 based composites comprising SnO2 decorated on carbon,14,58,63 carbon cloth,64 carbon aerogel,65 graphene,25,32 and MWCNT28–31 is tabulated in Table S1.† Further our catalyst was compared with other different catalysts like FSP-SnO2,17 Vo-rich Co3O4,19 m-SnO2,20 ZnO,21 CuO/In2O3,55 black reduced porous SnO2,46 and CuOx–Vo66 with oxygen vacancies with their methodology of vacancy creation and activity towards CO2 reduction, as shown in Table S2.† The superiority of our catalyst's synthetic methodology, fabrication and activity as compared to previously known catalysts are as follows – (a) the utilisation of scalable and environmentally benign microwave technique for the synthesis of SnO2–CNT pH-11 and incorporation of defects over SnO2 by avoiding complicated and harsh methods, (b) fabrication of a catalyst with a minimum amount of loading of 0.2 mg cm−2 which has two major advantages – it reduces the higher amount of catalyst synthesis which ultimately leads to high cost and this loading optimisation can be directly taken in the case of fuel cell mode cell operation, and (c) SnO2–CNT pH-11 shows more positive potential than all other catalysts except for N-SnO2/C without any heteroatom doping or porosity since doping with heteroatoms or creating uniform porosity during large scale synthesis will be difficult. All the above meritorious points are quite important in the view of commercialisation. Hence we believe that this work has highlighted important aspects in understanding the electrochemical CO2 reduction with microwave-polyol prepared SnO2–CNT materials and this catalyst synthesis methodology could be adopted directly in large scale application processes.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we successfully utilised microwave polyol synthesis to systematically tune the oxygen vacancies of SnO2–CNT composites by varying the particle size. Furthermore, the as-synthesised materials were evaluated for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. It was observed that there exists a direct correlation between variation of oxygen vacancies through size alteration and electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. Among the various composites, SnO2–CNT pH-11 exhibited a higher faraday efficiency of 76.33% with an energy efficiency of 54.4% at a lower potential of −0.77 V vs. RHE and high stability. The better activity of SnO2–CNT pH-11 originated from the combined factors of improved oxygen vacancies and 5 nm size of SnO2 which helped for CO2 reduction by offering a moderate binding energy towards both adsorption and desorption of intermediates. The synthetic methodology provides a simple protocol for creating defects which can be utilised for any other application.
