    , Accepted 11th November 2014First published on 11th November 2014AbstractPhotoelectrochemical water splitting to produce hydrogen under visible light has received intensive research interest but encounters significant scientific challenges. Sulphides have higher conduction band positions for H+ reduction and better sunlight absorption compared to oxides. CdS is the best candidate material, but its fatal toxicity from Cd makes it impossible to use for practical applications. Bi2S3 is non-toxic and has high absorption. However, Bi2S3 sensitized-TiO2 photoanodes have never been studied under visible light. In addition, although surface heterojunction using graphene as an electron mediator on an array structure has been studied to improve electron–hole separation, the achieved photoconversion efficiency is still low. Herein, for the first time, by physically architecting a nanostructure with delicately tailored chemistry, we demonstrate a novel “umbrella” hybrid (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 nanorod array (NR) structure, in which the multi-layered Bi2S3/rGO umbrella cover not only significantly enhances the light absorption efficiency, but also by electrically connecting with Bi2S3-modified TiO2 NRs creates a stepwise band-edge structure to accelerate the photo-generated electrons transport rate from Bi2S3 to TiO2 through rGO while generating a higher resistance to inhibit charge back recombination. This nanostructure achieves considerably higher efficiency than all various control structures under visible light by ∼4–5 times. This work not only demonstrates an innovative approach to construct a smart architecture at the nanoscale for an efficient practical water splitting device, but also offers scientific insights.
Introduction
Hydrogen generation from photoelectrochemical water splitting under visible light holds great promise for clean, large-scale fuel production but involves great scientific challenges.1–6 The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency relies mainly on the photoelectrocatalyst and its nanostructures. To date, various nanostructure-based materials such as TiO2 nanorods arrays (NRs) have been innovated to improve the conversion efficiency. TiO2 NRs can enhance the light scattering and trapping, which facilitate electron transportation, and provide large surface area.7,8 However, due to its wide band gap (3.0–3.2 eV), TiO2 still has a low absorption coefficient under visible light, which limits the conversion efficiency. To improve the absorption of solar light, semiconductors that have narrow band gaps and an energetically high-lying conduction bands have been used to sensitize TiO2. Sulphides possess relatively high conduction band positions suitable for H2O splitting and better sunlight absorption than oxides, which are originated from their S 3p orbitals for higher valence band positions.9 CdS is the best sulphide sensitizer10–14 but its fatal toxicity from Cd makes it impossible to use for practical applications.15,16 Bi2S3 with an ∼1.4 eV direct band gap is non-toxic while offering superior visible-light absorption for a potential ideal photosensitizer of TiO2.17–20 The conduction band of Bi2S3 is less anodic than TiO2, while its valence band is more cathodic than TiO2. This property is good for efficient charge separation and transfer. Bi2S3 nanoparticles have been synthesized to hydrothermally modify TiO2 to enhance charge separation under full-solar-spectrum irradiation.21 Under AM 1.5G condition, Bi2S3 and CdS quantum dot co-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes have been used to fabricate photoelectrochemical electrodes for improved device performance.22 Because visible light contributes a large part of energy in sunlight, enhancing the conversion efficiency under visible light is always essential to further improve the performance of a photoelectrochemical device. Despite the progress of Bi2S3 photosensitization in the past five years, no Bi2S3 sensitized-TiO2 photoanode has been studied under visible light.
Recently, surface heterojunction on an array structure has attracted significant attention in photocatalysis or photoelectrocatalysis.23–25 Fundamentally a surface heterojunction could enhance the separation of electron–hole pairs by its interfacial electrical field. A Fe2O3 nanorod/graphene/BiV1−xMoO4 core/shell heterojunction structure for visible light photoelectrochemical water splitting has been reported.24 Due to improved charge separation, the structure achieved a relative higher photocurrent density than that of bare Fe2O3 nanorods. TiO2 nanotube arrays composited with graphene and CdS quantum dots for photocatalytic degradation have been investigated to improve photocurrent density under simulated solar light irradiation.25 In both cases, a simple graphene component in the surface heterojunction behaves only as an electron conductor to enhance the electron–hole separation. However, the improved photoconversion efficiency (e.g., ∼0.17%) under visible light irradiation is still relatively low. Thus, the nanostructure and chemistry of the photoelectrode should be further delicately developed for higher photoconversion efficiency under visible light illumination.
Herein for the first time, with a combination of nano-architecting and chemistry-tailoring, we demonstrate a novel “umbrella” hybrid (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 nanorod array (NR) structure, in which a multilayered Bi2S3/rGO umbrella cover electrically connects with one-dimensional (1D) Bi2S3-modified TiO2 NRs to create a stepwise band-edge structure in a photoelectrochemical process under visible light for accelerating the photo-generated electrons from Bi2S3 to TiO2 through rGO while generating a higher resistance to inhibit electrons back for recombination. This nanostructure achieves the highest conversion efficiency (ABPE) of 1.2 ± 0.02% at a bias of 0.47 V (vs. RHE) under visible light among all other structures built by these components (∼0.25–0.34%), demonstrating an approach to construct a smart architecture at the nanoscale for an efficient practical water splitting device, but also explores the scientific insights.
Experimental section
TiO2 NRs synthesis
Rutile TiO2 NR film on a FTO substrate was fabricated by a facile, one-pot hydrothermal method. In a typical process, the FTO substrate (2.5 cm × 1 cm, sheet resistance <10 Ω sq.−1) was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water for 15 min, and then dried by N2 stream. 20 ml concentrated HCl (38%) was first added into 20 ml DI water. After stirring for 2 min, 0.668 ml titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TIP) was dissolved into the above solution. Then, the mixed solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 ml volume). The FTO substrates were placed into the autoclave with the conductive side facing down, in which the FTO substrate was submerged in the solution. The subsequent hydrothermal reaction was maintained at 180 °C for 180 min. After hydrothermal reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the FTO substrates were taken out, rinsed adequately with DI water and allowed to dry in ambient air. Then, the obtained samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min in air to increase the crystallinity of TiO2 nanorods and improve their contact to the substrate.
(Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 electrode preparation
Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) was used to synthesize Bi2S3 nanoparticles onto the TiO2 NRs. TiO2 NRs deposited on FTO glass were successively immersed in four different beakers for about 60 s in each beaker. One beaker contained 0.1 M Bi(NO3)3 aqueous solution, another contained 0.15 M Na2S aqueous solution, and the other two contained DI water to rinse the samples from the excess of each precursor solution. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. The GO aqueous solution (2 mg ml−1) was reduced with Vitamin C. Then, rGO was spin-coated onto Bi2S3/TiO2 (400 rpm, 15 s; 2000 rpm, 60 s). The multilayer structure was completed by repeating the above steps. During the fabrication of (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NPs electrode, a thin layer of TiO2 NPs was first synthesized on FTO substrates by the hydrolysis of TiF4 at 60 °C for 30 min and annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. All of the as-prepared electrodes were further annealed at 250 °C for 5 h in vacuum.
Structural and optical characterizations
The morphology of different electrodes was characterized using a JSM-7800F scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (Japan Electron Co.,) equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Oxford Co.,). The TEM analysis was carried out on a JSM-2100 electron microscope instrument (Japan Electron Co.,) operated at an accelerating voltage at 200 kV. The crystal structures of pure rGO, and (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 electrodes were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Cu-Kα X-ray radiation, λ = 0.154 nm, Shimadzu Co.,) in the scan range from 20° to 80° at a scanning speed of 4° min−1. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co.,) in wavelength range from 300–800 nm (BaSO4 as a reference sample).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode configuration with the as-prepared sample as a working electrode (typical efficient area: ∼0.5 cm2), Pt foil as a counter electrode (2.5 cm2), and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode. The light source is a 300 W Xe lamp with a UV cut-off filter (420 nm) and a light power density of 100 mW cm−2. A mixture of 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.25 M Na2S (pH = 12.4 ± 0.1 tested by the Sartorius PB-11 pH meter) aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte and sacrificial reagent. The current density vs. potential (J–V) curve of the working electrode was obtained by the linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) with a potentiostat (CHI660D, CH Instruments) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The photocurrent response was obtained by potentiostatic (current vs. time, I–t) measurements under intermittent illumination at a bias of 0.0 V vs. SCE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted using CHI660D with an alternating current signal (10 mV) in the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz at open circuit potential (OCP). Mott–Schottky plots were measured at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark. All the measurements under irradiation were performed with backside illumination.
Results and discussion
In brief, a novel “umbrella” architecture comprising a uniform array of aligned rutile TiO2 NRs modified with Bi2S3 nanoparticles/nanosheets and alternatively deposited multi-layered Bi2S3/rGO nanosheet umbrellas (Fig. 1) is prepared by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) followed by spin coating for high solar-hydrogen conversion efficiency under visible light. In this “umbrella” architecture, the multi-layered Bi2S3/rGO nanostructure acts as the “canopy” of the “umbrella” and can make a large amount of Bi2S3 efficiently harvest the sunlight due to the transparent nature of rGO, while the layered rGO sheets and one dimensional TiO2 NRs are the “ribs” and “stretchers” of the “umbrella”, respectively, which can quickly transfer the photo-generated electrons from Bi2S3 to TiO2 through rGO and generate a higher resistance against charge recombination. The FTO conductive layer behaves as the “shaft” of the “umbrella”. The Pt counter electrode is the “handle” of the “umbrella” to catalyse the water splitting into hydrogen. Three control structures, including TiO2 NRs (Fig. 2a), Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs (Fig. 2c) and multi-layered Bi2S3/rGO (Fig. 2g), were also investigated for comparison. Details of the fabrication procedures are given in the Experimental section.

(g and h) Five layers of Bi2S3/rGO modified TiO2 NPs (orange) and (b, d, f and h) are their corresponding scanning electron micrographs. 
The structure of the electrodes was examined by FESEM and TEM, showing that vertically aligned TiO2 NRs in a range from 50 to 200 nm with a mean length of 5.7 ± 0.1 μm are uniformly grown on FTO substrates with a rectangular cross section. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and HRTEM image indicate that these TiO2 NRs are single crystals and that the rutile phase has a growth direction parallel to the c-axis (ESI Fig. S1†). The fringe spacing parallel (or perpendicular) to the c-axis of the nanorod is 0.32 ± 0.01 nm (or 0.29 ± 0.01 nm), which is consistent with the d value of (110) (or (001)) lattice spacing of the rutile TiO2.
Bi2S3 NPs decoration not only modifies the surface of the TiO2 NRs but also partially fills into the void space between TiO2 NRs (Fig. 2d). The diameter of the Bi2S3 NPs is around 5–70 nm and the Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs exhibit rougher surfaces (Fig. 3a). The lattice distances shown in Fig. 3b correspond well with (004) plane of rutile TiO2 and (211) plane of orthorhombic Bi2S3.

In the umbrella (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode structure, the multilayered Bi2S3/rGO “umbrella canopy” is clearly observed (Fig. 2f and ESI Fig. S3†) with both microspores and mesopores, which are completely connected to the “umbrella ribs”, the Bi2S3 decorated TiO2 nanorods. TEM imaging suggests a large number of small Bi2S3 NPs uniformly anchored on the rGO layer (Fig. 3d). This can be attributed to oxygen functional groups on the rGO surface as nucleation sites that promote a uniform deposition of Bi2S3 NPs. HRTEM image (Fig. 3e) shows that the interplanar spacing is 0.38 ± 0.01 nm, which is consistent with (001) plane of the orthorhombic Bi2S3. SEAD pattern on the Bi2S3/rGO zone shows diffraction spots and circle diffraction rings resulting from Bi2S3 NPs and rGO sheets, respectively. The circle diffraction rings indicate good crystal integrity of the rGO layer. Interestingly, some Bi2S3 nanosheets (Bi2S3 NSs) are formed from Bi2S3 NPs during the annealing process (Fig. 3c). This can efficiently improve the contact area between electrode and electrolyte, resulting in a potential improvement in the device performance. The thickness of the Bi2S3NPs@rGO layer and the Bi2S3 NPs/NSs layer are 465 ± 10 nm and 1.85 ± 0.2 μm, respectively. For the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NPs electrode, a similar multilayered Bi2S3/rGO structure and surface morphology can be observed (ESI Fig. S4†).
The crystal structure and phase composition of the as-prepared (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as illustrated in Fig. 3g which shows that all the diffraction peaks could be indexed to the rutile TiO2 (JCPDS, card no. 42-1276) and the orthorhombic phase Bi2S3 (JCPDS, card no. 17-320). For TiO2 NRs, only the (101), (002) and (220) diffraction peaks are observed. Moreover, five peaks belong to the orthorhombic Bi2S3. The peaks located at 24.9°, 18.6°, 31.8°, 46.5° and 52.6° correspond to (130), (211), (221), (431) and (351) crystallinity planes of Bi2S3, respectively. The XRD pattern of the rGO film on FTO is also shown in Fig. 3g. After reduction using Vitamin C, a broad peak appears at 25.6°, corresponding to the (002) plane of rGO.26 This typical diffraction peak of rGO can also be observed on the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 electrode. Furthermore, EDS analysis confirms that the elements in (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs (ESI Fig. S5†) are Ti, O, C, Bi and S.
To study the optical absorption properties, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured in a range of 300–800 nm as shown in Fig. 3h, in which there are corresponding images of the as-prepared electrode samples. The plain TiO2 NRs possess an absorption band edge at ∼413 ± 2 nm and no significant absorbance under visible light can be seen because of its large energy gap (∼3.0 eV). One can clearly see that modifying the TiO2 NRs with Bi2S3 NPs significantly improves the visible light absorption intensity in comparison to the plain TiO2 NRs. Furthermore, a red shift to a higher wavelength is observed in the absorption edge of Bi2S3/TiO2 NR electrodes. Therefore, the decorated Bi2S3 NPs are able to efficiently promote the visible light absorption of Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs, contributing to the high absorption coefficient of Bi2S3 NPs. This is consistent with the images of Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs with a dark brown colour. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the plain Bi2S3 film is also shown in Fig. 3h for comparison, showing good visible light absorption in a range of 400–700 nm. The optical band gap of 1.47 ± 0.02 eV can be derived from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, which agrees well with the reported value.17 The rGO in the multi-layered hybrid Bi2S3/rGO structure can further efficiently enhance the visible light absorption in a broad range, which is the typical absorption behaviour by π electrons.27 Apparently, the rGO in the multi-layered hybrid Bi2S3/rGO structure is not a simple electron mediator but also a booster for visible light absorption, and plays other critical roles as discussed later. The (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NPs electrodes also show strong visible-light absorption, while the intensity of absorption is lower than that of (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrodes. This can be ascribed to the TiO2 nanorod arrays with strong light scattering and absorption.
The photoelectrochemical behaviors of the above electrodes are investigated in 0.35 M Na2SO3 and 0.25 M Na2S (pH = 12.4 ± 0.1) under visible light with a three-electrode configuration. The amounts of rGO, Bi2S3 and rGO/Bi2S3 were all optimized before measurements were taken (ESI Fig. S6–S8†). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is a common electrochemical technique to examine carrier characteristics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface (SEI) for n- and p-type materials. Under visible light, the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode umbrella structure achieves the highest photocurrent (2.7 ± 0.01 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE), and the photocurrent steeply increases with the increase in applied potential and does not reach saturation, which is typical for many nanoparticle electrodes. This is 1.7, 7.8, and 11.1 fold larger than those of (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NPs, Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs and TiO2 NRs at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), respectively. The enhancement of the harvesting photocurrent density is very likely to result from the unique Bi2S3-rGO structure that has a stepwise band-edge energy structure for more efficient charge separation. To examine the photocurrent response, amperometric I–t curves were measured with light on/off cycles at 0.0 V bias. In Fig. 4c, the currents of all electrodes have a transient increase after illumination, exhibiting good sensitivity. For the (rGO/Bi2S3)5/TiO2 NR electrode, the photocurrent shows a sharp decrease, which is possibly due to carrier recombination. The photocurrent of (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs reaches 2.0 ± 0.1 mA cm−2, while Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs and (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NPs only deliver 0.60 ± 0.02 and 0.49 ± 0.03 mA cm−2, respectively. The higher photocurrent from the umbrella hybrid structure can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the unique nanostructure and nanomaterials as discussed below. To quantitatively analyse the electrode efficiency, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is calculated in terms of the following formula:28 η (%) = J(1.23 − V)/P × 100(1)where J is the current density under visible light irradiation, V is the applied voltage versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and P is the input light power intensity of 100 mW cm−2. In an illuminated three-electrode cell, the obtained current–voltage data can be useful to determine the solar conversion efficiency of an individual photoelectrode, not the efficiency for the overall water splitting reaction, according to eqn (1).29–31 This allows us to optimize and identify the champion nanostructure for high performance photoelectrochemical water splitting. The RHE potential can be converted from that of the SCE reference electrode: ERHE = ESCE + 0.059pH + E0SCE(2)where ERHE is the converting potential vs. RHE, ESCE is the experimental potential measured against SCE, and E0SCE = 0.2438 V at 25 °C. The calculated ABPE efficiencies are plotted as a function of the applied bias in Fig. 4b. The (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode shows a conversion efficiency of 1.2 ± 0.02% at 0.47 V (vs. RHE), which is significantly higher by 4.8 and 3.5 times than that of Bi2S3/TiO2 NRs and (Bi2S3/rGO)/TiO2 NPs electrodes, respectively. In comparison to the performance of related nanostructured electrodes (ESI Table S2†), this “umbrella” structure also has the highest photoconversion efficiency under visible light irradiation. In comparison to that even under the stimulated solar light (AM 1.5G) illumination, the efficiency of our “umbrella” structure is surprisingly higher or at least comparable. This clearly indicates that the novel “umbrella” structure indeed delivers high performance under visible light for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Moreover, the photostability of the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode is shown in Fig. 4c. The current density retention of ∼66% was observed after an hour of visible light irradiation. The decrease in current density is in accordance with the general trend of the reported narrow band gap materials.32,33

Electrochemical impedance measurements performed in the dark provide information about the intrinsic electronic properties of the semiconductor in contact with the electrolyte solution. On the basis of the Mott–Schottky plot (1/C2vs. V), one can extrapolate the position of the flat-band potential (Vfb) from the V-axis intercept. Mott–Schottky (MS) plot describe the semiconductor depletion layer capacitance (C) depending on the applied potential (V) and is given as follows:34,35 1/C2 = (2/εrε0ND) × (V − Vfb − kBT/e)(3)where εr is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (εr = 100 is used), ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 N−1 C2 m−2), e is the element charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), ND is the donor density, Vfb is the flat band potential and kBT/e is a temperature-dependent correction term. According to the MS equation, the slope of the MS plot has an inverse relationship with the donor density of semiconductor film and the donor density of a semiconductor film can be calculated from the following equation: Nd = 2/εrε0(d(1/C2)/dV)−1.(4)
The positive slope of MS plot indicates the presence of a typical n-type semiconductor characteristic with electrons as the majority carriers. The calculated electron densities of different electrodes are listed in Table 1, indicating that the electron density increases with the addition of Bi2S3 and rGO. This attributes to the electrons from n-type Bi2S3. The charge carrier diffusion length (Debye length, LD) for all electrodes were also calculated in terms of35,36 LD = (ε0εrkT/e2ND)1/2.(5)

According to the Schottky barrier model, the transit time through the depletion layer is proportional to the square of LD. (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode shows the shortest Debye length (1.1853 nm), indicating its lowest transit time for better electron–hole separation. The depletion layer width (W) at 0.0 V bias (vs. SCE) can be calculated by36,37 W = (2ε0εrψ/e2ND)1/2(6)where ψ ≡ E − Efb is the maximum potential drop in the depletion layer. A potential of 0.0 V was chosen to calculate the depletion layer because of the negligible dark current at that potential. The calculated depletion layer width (10.56–154.51 nm) is significantly smaller than the film thickness of electrodes, resulting in the photocurrent being strongly dependent on the film thickness (ESI Fig. S8†). There are two critical factors affecting the photocurrent: the thickness of depletion layer and the series resistance. A thicker depletion layer is favourable to separate electrons and holes but results in higher resistivity. Thus, there must be a compromise thickness of the Bi2S3/rGO multilayer for the highest photocurrent. In addition, the light absorption can affect the electrons and hole density by increasing the number of Bi2S3/rGO multilayers.
Furthermore, the processes occurring at SEI comprising the depletion (space charge) and the Helmholtz (double layer) layers are also evaluated under visible light. Nyquist plots of the photoelectrodes (Fig. 5b and c) were measured at the open-circuit potential over a range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC perturbation of 10 mV. Two semicircles can be distinguished, of which the small semicircle over the high frequency range can be ascribed to the charge-transfer process in the semiconductor depletion layer while the low-frequency arc results from the electron transfer in the Helmholtz layer. The Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 5c) and the fitting results are plotted with solid lines in Fig. 5b and c. In the equivalent circuit, the RDP//CPEDP-components describe the semiconductor depletion layer resistance and the chemical capacitance. On the other hand, RH represents the charge transfer resistance in the Helmholtz layer, while the CPEH element corresponds to the recharged Helmholtz layer. Finally, RS is the series resistance of the cell. We argue that the good agreement between the measured and fitted data may indicate that the proposed equivalent circuit could accurately describe the main charge transfer processes occurring in the photoelectrochemical cell.

According to the fitting results in ESI Table S1,† the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode shows the lowest RDP and RH, which are 6.261 Ω and 434.6 Ω, respectively, suggesting a superior charge transfer process at electrode/solution interface, attributing to the novel networked umbrella hybrid nanostructure and the high active surface area from the unique nanostructure. In contrast, the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode with the same surface area of graphene and Bi2S3 as the “umbrella” structure results in considerably higher RDP (65.26 Ω) and RH (1316.0 Ω). This reveals that the improved performance does not come from the large surface area, but is due to the efficient charge separation and transportation from the unique nanostructured hybrid system. The highest value of CPE for the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs also indicates better electrocatalytic activity after Bi2S3/rGO modification. The transit times calculated from the characteristic frequency at the peak of high-frequency semicircle under irradiation are 19.18 μs, 34.33 μs and 23.29 μs for (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs, plain TiO2 NRs and Bi2S3 NPs modified TiO2 NRs, respectively. This can be attributed to the high electron expressway of the umbrella ribs, 1D TiO2 nanorods and the umbrella canopy, 2D rGO sheets, which well bridge Bi2S3 and TiO2 NRs. In addition, the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NPs nanostructure delivers the longest transit time (232.93 μs), indicating higher electron scattering and greatly inhibited charge recombination between Bi2S3 nanoparticles. Therefore, under visible light irradiation, electrons can be rapidly transported in the depletion layer of the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs structure, which is consistent with the calculation from the Mott–Schottky measurements.
The energy level diagram of the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs-based hybrid umbrella structure is shown in Fig. 6. As reported, the calculated work function for graphene is −4.42 eV.38,39 The conducting band of Bi2S3 is larger than the work function of graphene, and thus a charge transfer from Bi2S3 to graphene is energetically favourable. FTO with a work function of around −4.7 eV and TiO2 with a conduction level at −4.5 eV can also facilitate the fast capture of electrons from graphene. Therefore, the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NRs-based hybrid umbrella structure provides a stepwise band-edge energy structure for efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons in Bi2S3 to TiO2 through rGO while resulting in a high resistance to block the charge recombination. This enables effective charge separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs leading to the highest solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. In other words, in the composed stepwise band-edge energy structure, rGO and Bi2S3 act as a charge transporter/sensitizer which can efficiently decrease the charge-transfer resistance, increase the electron density and consequently improve the photoelectrochemical performance of the (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode. The process of charge transfer discussed above is illustrated in Fig. 6.

Conclusions
In summary, a smart “umbrella” structured hybrid (Bi2S3/rGO)5/TiO2 NR electrode with multilayer and 1D nanorod array structures for photoelectrochemical electrodes under visible light is developed to create a stepwise band-edge structure in a photoelectrochemical process for efficient charge separation, fast charge transportation and increased charge recombination resistance, thus delivering an efficiency of ∼1.2% at 0.47 V (vs. RHE) under visible light (λ > 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2), which is significantly higher than that of the different structures made by these components by ∼4–5 times. This work demonstrates a novel approach for constructing a smart architecture at the nanoscale for a potentially efficient practical water splitting device.
