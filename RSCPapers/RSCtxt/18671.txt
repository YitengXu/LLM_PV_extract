    , Accepted 21st December 2017First published on 21st December 2017AbstractGraphene oxide or its reduced derivative (GO/RGO) replace metal oxides in perovskite photovoltaics to achieve energy band alignment for minimization of the energy barriers at the film interfaces allowing efficient charge transport, and eliminate stability issues. However, the power conversion efficiencies fall in a wide range (∼0.6–18%). Therefore, the perovskite growth and nucleation on GO/RGO require fundamental understanding to improve device function for controlled fabrication, which remain a major challenge. We analyze the surface morphology and crystallization of the lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) at 20–300 °C on GO using X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. To determine defect mechanisms and their composition, we perform in situ transmission infrared and micro Raman spectroscopy, and the cross-sectional scanning microscopy that captures interfacial imperfections with the oxygen defects. We demonstrate the oxygen-induced defects at the MAPbX3/GO interfaces that initiate at room temperature, and occur through the nucleophilic substitution reactions. Unexpectedly, structural defects nucleate in GO forming chemically reduced GO, and modify the surface morphology that yield a poor perovskite growth. Our theoretical studies also reveal that energetically favorable, exothermic reactions between the halides of the perovskite precursors and the oxygen groups of GO generate acidic reaction by-products (i.e. HX), that confirm the formation of oxygen-induced defects.
Introduction
Since the demonstration of dye replacement with “methylammonium lead halides (MAPbX3, X = I, Br and Cl)” in 2009 by Miyasaka et al.,1 perovskite solar cells have shown competing power conversion efficiencies (>25% of PCE) with respect to the silicon solar technology.2 Low binding energy excitons of the methylammonium lead halides allow highly efficient charge carrier separation at the p–n junctions.2 Their exciting optoelectronic properties such as tunable bandgap, long electron–hole diffusion length and high electron/hole mobility benefit solar technology. Apart from the low-cost, flexible device designs are achieved that are not possible with current rigid silicon structures.3 A majority of these devices, however, suffer from poor stability of the perovskite interacting with the electron/transport layers (ETL/HTL) in the device stack, because of high reactivity with water, humidity, and oxygen.4 Although encapsulation protects devices from the environmental changes,5 attempts to modify the individual perovskite layer for a long-term stability have barely been addressed. Although perovskites as the light harvester layers are sandwiched between oxides and polymers-based ETL/HTL,6 control of perovskite growth and crystallization is challenging.7 A large number of growth methods are available for the MAPbX3 deposition, and new perovskite designs have stable composition and stoichiometry in various device stacks, and have eliminated hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics.3 Particularly, increased grain size, controlled phase transformation and topology, improved surface and interface roughness, and elimination of defects are essential for improvements of the chemical stability of MAPbX3. The degree of charge carrier injection into the transport layers also occurs at the interfaces that suppresses the carrier recombination while maintaining the carrier extraction at the electrodes.8 Unfortunately, methods for tuning interface chemistry in perovskite solar cells have remained mainly undeveloped. Moreover, the interfacial chemical interactions between perovskites and oxides/polymers are, for the most part not understood,9 and most studies focus on serendipitous device fabrication. Concerning the layer-to-layer interactions, interfacial characterization is highly critical to identify key factors affecting the photovoltaics performance associated with the perovskite stability.
Graphene incorporated perovskite-based solar cells have been recently demonstrated as an alternative to the metal oxide and polymer-based perovskite photovoltaics for low-cost and scalable production.10 Graphene shows great promise for photovoltaics because of its unique one-atom thick sheet of sp2-hybridized conjugation electronic structure,11 and can participate in the perovskite solar cell designs as top and bottom contacts, and as an interfacial layer between perovskites and electron/hole transporters (ETL/HTL), and as a space layer between ETL/HTL and metal contacts.10,12,13 The major target of graphene use in the design is the stability improvement for perovskite solar cell devices, and to achieve the energy band alignment with perovskites for improved charge transfer.13 Moreover, the role of graphene-derived materials (graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO (rGO), functionalized GO, etc.) is critical as the interfaces between ETL/HTL and the perovskite layers. However, the chemical interactions at the ETL/HTL/graphene interfaces modify film composition and resulting stoichiometry, and alter PCE (∼0.62–18%).14,15 So far, a large number of studies using GO focusing on device fabrication to optimize PCE, leaving the material interactions with perovskites, and the understanding the resulting film properties during deposition unclear.10 To obtain reliable, high quality (defect-free) films for improved device performance and stability, film-to-film chemical interactions at the interfaces require further control.8 For this reason, the role of defects and their nucleation mechanisms modifying the graphene oxide/perovskite interfaces must be addressed.
The use of graphene-like nanomaterials derived from GO shows promise for enhanced interfacial charge transport, and PCE. GO as an alternative HTL for inverted devices, or as an ETL in a planar device results in PCE >12%.16,17 Insertion of an ultra-thin layer of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) allows ultrafast hot electron injection between perovskites and TiO2 leading to increased photocurrent with passivation of interfacial charge trap states.18 Moreover, GO as an interfacial layer is promising. For instance, lithiated GO sandwiched between perovskites and TiO2 doped with graphene as an interfacial layer allows improved charge transport.19 Indeed, GO deposited between perovskites and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, HTL) enhances charge transport by improving the interface stability.15 Based on Volonakis et al.'s recent first-principles calculations for the graphene–CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces, insertion of graphene into the perovskite layers leads to a nanoscale ferroelectric distortion that allows promising electron–hole separation at such interfaces.20 Incorporation of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide into the perovskite is one of the examples indicating hysteresis-free PCE (>18%) because of increased perovskite grain size, and retarding electron–hole recombination.21,22 Polymer composites such as PEDOT:PSS (HTL in inverted solar cells) with GO also improve the interface morphology with perovskites.23 Furthermore, functionalized GO and RGO emerge as ETLs/HTLs in contact with MAPbX3. A few examples include controlled conductivity of GO by ammonia doping that facilitate high interfacial charge transport between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS,24 injecting RGO as an ETL into the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) matrix that increases photo-generated electrons by matching energy levels of perovskites and TiO2,25,26 incorporation of chemically reduced graphene oxide (CRGO) as the bottom contacts,14 and the use of RGO and polyaniline composites as ETLs for low-temperature processing and increased thermal stability.27 Although several studies have been reported for device fabrication, the chemical interactions are poorly understood, and understanding the origin of the perovskite degradation mechanisms at the (GO/RGO)/perovskite interfaces is lacking. Incomplete lead precursor conversion, inconsistent crystallite formation, weak cation-anion-solvent coordination, uncontrolled stoichiometry in the presence of oxygen, high metallic lead content, and high surface roughness are detrimental effects that must be overcome to improve the perovskite stability on the GO layers, which determine the photovoltaic performance. A microscopic understanding of the mechanisms leading to these deficiencies is therefore imperative for device advancement.
Removal of randomly distributed, non-stoichiometric oxygen functional groups in GO thin films increase the conductive domains (i.e. GO reduction), resulting in a band gap modification. Functionalization of GO/RGO generates conductive and non-conductive domains, and creates new graphene-like material. The role of oxygen-induced defects in RGO and their effect on the electronic properties remain unclear since the type of defect and amount of oxygen modify the band gap.28 There is still debate as to the role of oxygen in RGO in achieving high PCE in solar cell devices that impact resulting device performance. In order to monitor defect mechanisms for the growth of perovskites on GO, and explain the interfacial chemical changes at the GO/MAPbX3 interfaces, in situ characterization is necessary. Herein, we demonstrate interfacial spectroscopy characterization combined with the X-ray diffraction and microscopy studies to study the growth and nucleation mechanisms of methylammonium lead halides on GO thin films, as the starting material. The main scope of this work is to examine film-to-film changes by monitoring chemical reactions during perovskite growth as a function of temperature, and understand types of defects, and their role in graphene-based perovskite solar cells. Two major targets of the work, in particular, are (1) to propose the mechanisms of degradation of GO, and determine the perovskite growth and nucleation steps, and (2) to analyze the impact of halide anions of the precursors on resulting MAPbX3 crystals as the major cause of the modification at the graphene/perovskite interfaces. Based on earlier studies, it is known that the oxygen concentration of RGO depends on the annealing temperature and the remaining oxygen content in RGO determines the degree of mobility, and types of random surface and interlayer oxygen interactions.29 The chemical reactions associated with the oxygen groups initiate at ∼100–150 °C during thermal reduction of GO, however the oxygen groups do not react significantly in this range and at room temperature.30 To understand the chemical differences in the reduction of GO for the oxygen interactions in the case of perovskite growth, this study also describes the role of precursors for the growth chemistry of perovskites, specifically for the defects present at the MAPbX3/GO interfaces.
Results and discussion
The presence of interfacial defects is critical to control the performance issues in the perovskite solar cell devices. In order to investigate the chemical stability and the nature of defects at the GO/MAPbX3 interface, where X is I, Br or Cl, we study the growth of three different methylammonium lead halides; methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3), and methylammonium lead chloride (MAPbCl3). For this purpose, GO thin films (3–5 layers) are fabricated via a modified vacuum filtration technique,31 followed by a deposition on clean Si/SiO2 substrates having a thermal oxide of ∼10 nm (Fig. 1a, on quartz for demonstration). Following their fabrication and prior to the perovskite precursor deposition, GO thin films are kept in nitrogen overnight to minimize the absorption of residual water. This technique allows the formation of continuous GO films (∼8–10 nm thick, 3–5 layers, Fig. S1a and b†), resulting in a ∼20 nm of total film thickness including the surface roughness (Fig. S1c and d†). Fabricated 3–5 layered GO films yield superior surface cover age than the single layered GO thin films (Fig. S2†), as characterized by the SEM images with randomly distributed flakes overlapped in a film morphology.

Surface morphology
A one-step conventional growth method is used for deposition of the MAPbX3 (Fig. 1b and c) perovskites on fabricated GO (3–5L) films (Fig. S1†).32 The main objective is to obtain the growth of MAPbX3 on GO, and understand the growth and nucleation mechanisms relative to their growth on Si/SiO2. In this procedure, the methylammonium halide (MAX, where X = I, Br, Cl) and lead(II) halide (PbX2) precursors are introduced at a 1:1 molar ratio in DMF with a solution concentration of 40 wt%. Next, each precursor solution (a mixture of MAX and PbX2) is spin-coated on a Si/SiO2 or on a GO thin film (3–5L) (Fig. 1a), and then annealed to grow MAPbX3 at 130 °C for 30 min on a hot plate in nitrogen (Fig. 1c). The AFM analysis of the MAPbX3 growth on GO shows that the film surface roughness is reduced after annealing precursors (Fig. S3–S5d†). For instance, the sectional height analysis of the MAPbI3 growth on GO indicates that the film thickness obtained by a 40 μl solution deposition is decreased to ∼97 nm after heating at 130 °C (initially ∼166 nm at room temperature). Similarly, the MAPbBr3 growth on GO also generates the surface with a film thickness of ∼320 nm after annealing (initially ∼ 430 nm) by reducing the roughness. In addition, the MAPbCl3 growth on GO results in a film thickness of ∼172 nm (initially 240 nm). Thereafter, these films are used to examine the chemical reactions that occur at the GO/MAPbX3 interface using in situ FTIR measurements in transmission mode for the analysis of the interfacial film composition. In order to maintain the GO/MAPbX3 (MAX and PbX2, where X = I, Br, Cl) thickness at ∼10–20 nm, we find that ∼5–10 μl of the precursor solution in DMF is sufficient to adjust the film thickness followed by annealing.
The chemical changes in the GO thin films after the perovskite growth are visible to the naked eye with a color change from light brown (regular film color in Fig. 1a) to black (i.e. reduced GO). This color change in GO is shown with Fig. 1a–c after spin coating of the precursors followed by annealing at 130 °C for 30 min on a quartz substrate. The top-down SEM and AFM analysis with the GO/MAPbX3 thin films indicate an irregular perovskite morphology (Fig. 1 and S6†) that is explained by the presence of interfacial interactions with the oxygen groups of GO during the perovskite growth. We find that the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 results in a bead-like structured fiber morphology after spin coating of PbI2 and MAI from a DMF solution, followed by annealing (Fig. S6a†).32 However, these fiber-structured precursors have smooth surfaces without beads when spin coating of PbI2 and MAI occurs on GO (Fig. S6b†). After annealing of the precursor films to grow MAPbI3 on GO, the beads appear as the texture, and maintain their fiber shape (Fig. S6c†), similar to the precursors annealed to grow MAPbI3 without GO (Fig. S6a†). The AFM analysis also confirms the bead-like texture of these precursors on the Si/SiO2 substrates before (Fig. S4a†) and after the MAPbI3 growth (Fig. S4b†), and their smooth surfaces (i.e. absence of the beads) on GO before annealing (Fig. S4c†). The smooth surfaces of MAPbI3 appear due to the effect of humidity as explained by Christians et al.33 The fiber-structured MAPbI3 with bead-like features grow at 130 °C on a GO thin film (Fig. S4d,† AFM analysis), however the beads are embedded into the fiber morphology (Fig. S6c,† SEM analysis) that are smaller from the agglomerated beads in the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 (Fig. S6a†). These small beads indicate that the MAPbI3 growth on GO follows a different nucleation mechanism than their growth on Si/SiO2, which is determined by the chemical interactions between the halides of perovskite precursors and the oxygen groups of GO. We also find that the ball-like texture of MAPbBr3 results in a lower surface coverage on GO (Fig. S7c and d†) compared to the growth of MAPbI3 (Fig. S7a and b†) and MAPbCl3 (Fig. S7e and f†) on GO. However, the surface coverage improves with the amount of perovskite precursors deposited on GO, allowing a large-area deposition (Fig. S8†). The thin film fabrication with a large-area deposition is shown by the SEM analysis at a low and high magnification (Fig. S7 and S8†), and with the optical images given in Fig. S9.† Indeed, the precursor halides influence the resulting morphology modified at the GO/MAPbX3 interface after deposition of the perovskite precursors on the substrates, and the chemical interactions with the underlayer film determine the resulting morphology of the perovskite crystals (Fig. S9†). These interactions at the interfaces thus control the nucleation mechanisms and the resulting morphology of MAPbX3 on GO. In order to reduce the growth time at low annealing temperatures, we perform a 30 min growth of MAPbX3 on GO at 130 °C to compensate the growth kinetics at 60 °C for 2–12 h (Fig. S10,† a time-dependent study).34 For instance, the increase of growth time at 60 °C nucleates the beads in the MAPbI3 structure (Fig. S10g–i†) as compared to the shorter times (Fig. S10a–f†). Obviously, increase of the temperature to 130 °C allows the growth to occur at a shorter time (Fig. 1 and S6†). In summary, the control of morphology of resulting MAPbX3 perovskite grown on GO is determined by the halide interactions with the underlayer oxygen, growth kinetics, the degree of substrate surface wettability controlled by the interfacial interactions; and the substrate interfacial energy leading to the perovskite crystallization.35–37
In order to identify the role of halides of the precursors for the perovskite growth on GO, we compare the morphology of MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 on GO, with that of MAPbI3. Two different domains are present in the MAPbBr3 growth on GO (Fig. S3c†) with beads present at 130 °C that is confirmed by the AFM analysis (Fig. S3d†). To compare, annealing of methylammonium bromide (MABr) and lead(II) bromide (PbBr2) precursors on Si/SiO2 nucleates beads in the cylindrical-shaped MAPbBr3 (SEM image in Fig. 1d and AFM image in Fig. S3b†), that is similar to the bead morphology of MAPbBr3 on GO (Fig. 1f and S3d†). The initial precursor deposition on Si/SiO2 forms a cylindrical texture with the curved edges oriented upward (Fig. S3a†) and on GO (Fig. S3c†), spin-coated at room temperature. Moreover, the MAPbBr3 growth on GO results in larger cylindrical features (Fig. 1f) than the growth on Si/SiO2 (Fig. 1d). Similar to the precursor deposition on Si/SiO2 (Fig. S3a†), spin coating of the MABr and PbBr2 precursors on GO does not form any bead-like texture prior to annealing (Fig. 1e and S3c†). Instead, we observe smooth surfaces of MAPbBr3 at room temperature prior to heat. Moreover, a sponge-like texture appears after the deposition of MACl and PbCl2 on Si/SiO2 at 130 °C to grow MAPbCl3 (Fig. S6d†), which is not present for the MAPbCl3 growth on GO (Fig. S6f†). Spin coating of MACl and PbCl2 on GO also forms smooth surfaces of MAPbCl3 prior to heat (Fig. S6e†) that is different from the MAPbCl3 growth on Si/SiO2 (Fig. S6d and f†). The formation of smooth perovskite surface resembles initial precursor deposition for the growth of MAPbI3 (Fig. S6b†) and MAPbBr3 (Fig. S3c†) on GO. The precursor deposition for the MAPbCl3 growth, however, forms irregularly shaped structures (Fig. S6d and e†), which is challenging to define in terms of their texture due to the increased reactivity of MAPbCl3 embedded into GO (see the AFM analysis in Fig. S5c and d†). Consequently, morphology of the MAPbX3 growth on GO is explained by different nucleation mechanisms of the initial perovskite precursors due to varying reactivity order of the halide anions. Indeed, morphology of the resulting MAPbX3 on GO is further modified by heat during the growth processes. The embedding bead-like texture observed from the AFM analysis could be an indirect indication of poor MAPbX3 growth on GO. For instance, we observe that MAPbl3 and MAPbCl3 cannot grow on GO as efficient as MAPbBr3 (see the clear bead nucleation in Fig. 1f for MAPbBr3vs. the beads embedded into the structures formed by the growth of MAPbI3 (Fig. S6c†) and MAPbCl3 (Fig. S6f†) on GO). However, the beads cannot show a direct evidence for the achievement of perovskite growth in high yields, which require further investigation for its chemical composition. The reasons for the unsuccessful perovskite growth on GO will be therefore discussed with details of the nucleation mechanisms in the following section, mainly using a combination of spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques for understanding the interfacial chemical reactions correlated with the textural differences.
Interfacial interactions
The crystal orientation of different perovskite precursors on GO is determined by the chemical reactions between the oxygen groups of GO and the halides of precursors. We monitor the phase transitions by the XRD analysis as a function of the growth temperature to understand different origin of the nucleation mechanisms for the growth of MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbCl3 on GO. For this purpose, each precursor (MAX or PbX2) is spin coated from a DMF solution and their initial XRD analysis is provided at room temperature before deposition on GO (Fig. S11†). According to the typical procedure for the MAPbX3 growth, the methylammonium iodide and lead(II) iodide precursors are mixed in DMF (40 wt% of solution concentration), then spin-coated on the substrates at room temperature, and annealed on a hot plate. Furthermore, the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 is studied as a function of temperature (Fig. 2i), which indicates the tetragonal orientation of MAPbI3, and the patterns corresponding to the precursors disappear (Fig. S11†). The small peaks at 2θ° ∼ 7–9° that appear upon spin coating of the precursors on Si/SiO2 (Fig. 2i-a) are assigned to the intermediate phases (i.e. by-products with an incomplete non-stoichiometry) (Fig. 2i-a and b) that are also present at 80 °C (2θ° ∼ 14 in Fig. 2i-b). Based on the earlier reports,38 they are known as “intercalation compounds” formed because of the DMF intercalation with MAI in the layered stacks of PbI2. These features disappear at 100 °C, however a small peak of unreacted PbI2 appears (2θ° ∼ 12.5 in Fig. 2i-c), which is likely to generate MAPbI3 with a high yield at <150 °C. The MAPbI3 growth results in a tetragonal crystal orientation, supported by the presence of (110) and (220) orientation (Fig. 2i) with peaks given at 2θ° ∼ 14 and 2θ° ∼ 28.4. Apart from the halide perovskite growth, degradation of MAPbI3 occurs at 150 °C (Fig. 2i-d). Indeed, the presence of PbI2 peak at >150 °C represents the MAPbI3 degradation (Fig. 2i-e–g). In the case of the MAPbI3 growth on GO (Fig. 2ii), for comparison, MAPbI3 conversion yield is significantly poor as observed with the presence of PbI2 at 100–300 °C (Fig. 2ii-d–h). The intercalation compounds are present at 20–80 °C (Fig. 2ii-a–c) with several other peaks given at 2θ° ∼ 6–12 – similar to the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2. Overall, the unreacted PbI2 and formation of the intercalation compounds lead to a poor MAPbI3 conversion on GO because of the GO/MAPbI3 interfacial modification.

(ii) X-ray diffraction patterns of MAPbI3 growth on a GO thin film (3–5 layers) (a) after deposition at room temperature from the precursor solution in DMF, and after annealing at (b) 60 °C, (c) 80 °C, (d) 100 °C, (e) 150 °C, (f) 175 °C, (g) 200 °C and (h) 300 °C. 
The nature of interfacial chemical reactions at the interface of MAPbX3 and GO thin films is necessary to examine to clarify the perovskite nucleation mechanisms. Hence, we perform in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy in transmission mode, and monitor the MAPbX3 conversion as a function of the growth temperatures (20–300 °C). In order to analyze the oxygen-induced defect formation during the perovskite growth while thermal reduction of GO takes place, and thereby the root cause of poor MAPbI3 conversion yield on GO, the infrared absorbance spectra are collected at the critical growth temperatures. Initially, the MAI, MABr or MACl precursors are spin coated from a DMF solution on Si/SiO2 for each case, and their corresponding vibrational modes are present in Fig. S12.† The absorbance spectra are then collected to study the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 (Fig. 3) as a function of temperature (20–200 °C), and to compare the interfacial interactions with the MAPbI3 growth on GO (Fig. 4). The vibrational modes at 916 cm−1, ∼958 cm−1, ∼1255 cm−1, 1430 cm−1, ∼2800–3000 cm−1, and ∼3100–3200 cm−1 correspond to the presence of C–N rocking (CH3NH3+), C–N stretch, C–N rocking (CH3NH3+), C–H bending (CH3 asymmetric), symmetric-asymmetric C–H stretch and symmetric N–H stretch of the MAI precursor, respectively (Fig. 3a).39 When MAI is mixed with PbI2 and spin-coated before the MAPbI3 growth, a small peak appears at ∼1376 cm−1 and a sharp mode at ∼1643 cm−1. These vibrational modes are assigned to the asymmetric stretch mode of hydrated bicarbonate anion clusters40 (possibly a by-product formed because of the uncontrolled amount of residual water initiating an acidic environment), indicated by (HCO3−)·(H2O)n (Fig. 3b), also overlapped with the carbonyl stretch mode of hydrated DMF.41 The source of water is the moisture present in the precursors due to their hygroscopic nature, especially for MAI,42 which initially introduces into the DMF solution. The presence of C–OH stretch mode of water at ∼3000–3250 cm−1 in the infrared spectrum of MAI (Fig. 3a, also see ∼3083 cm−1 for the C–OH stretch of MAI in Fig. S12a†) indicates that one of the source of water is MAI (see that the C–OH peaks appear upon mixing with PbI2 and shifts to ∼3250-3500 cm−1 in Fig. 3b). Although we perform the perovskite growth experiments in argon with the GO thin films prepared in nitrogen, the residual moisture is also present in the precursors regardless of the controlled ambient condition.43 The residual water leads to form a hydrogen bond network resulting in the clusters of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n with varying size, and can possibly react with the metallic lead to produce Pb(CO3)2 once PbI2 is introduced, which is essential for the MAPbI3 growth.44 A small peak at ∼1410 cm−1 also indicates the presence of Pb(CO3)2 with a weak infrared intensity.45 The C–OH stretch of water at ∼3480 cm−1 that appears after the introduction of PbI2 for the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 indicates the major source of water is the PbI2 precursor (see Fig. 3b).

The dotted lines indicate a baseline for each of the infrared spectrum obtained after subtracting the infrared spectrum of Si/SiO2. 
We also note that the metallic lead is due to the contamination from the PbI2 precursor, or initial dissociation of the lead halide as stated by Sadoughi et al.46 According to the surface analysis of the MAPbI3 growth confirmed by our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements,47 the carbonate anions in the form of Pb(CO3)2 stay at or near the surface of the water cluster network under ambient conditions. The high surface affinity of the carbonates allows them to escape from the network surface easily with heat. As soon as the spin-coated precursors are heated at 100–150 °C (Fig. 3c and d), all these vibrational modes of MAI and PbI2 disappear indicating a high yield of MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2. As seen from Fig. 3(b and c), the peak of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n and (CO)DMF–H2O clusters at ∼1643 cm−1 typically disappears, followed by the MAPbI3 growth initiated at 100 °C. Pb(CO3)2 and (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters are then removed at >100 °C, as the peak at ∼1376–1385 cm−1 disappears (Fig. 4b–f). Moreover, the differential infrared absorbance spectra confirm that the chemical changes occur during the MAPbI3 growth (Fig. S13†) by differentiating the structural changes for both the reduction of GO and the perovskite growth. For this purpose, we monitor the vibrational modes corresponding to the functional groups of MAI, PbI2 and MAPbI3 at the growth temperatures (60–300 °C). Furthermore, the removal of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n and (CO)DMF–H2O clusters occurs at 20–100 °C, indicated by the negative peak at ∼1650 cm−1 (Fig. S13i-a†) that corresponds to the bending mode of water, and the cluster size (n) of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n that determines the range of the vibrational mode at ∼1643–1650 cm−1.40
In regard to the MAPbI3 growth, the peaks at 910 cm−1, 958 cm−1, 1255 cm−1, 1378–1432 cm−1, 2916 cm−1, 2962 cm−1, 3130 cm−1, and 3181 cm−1 represent the C–N rocking mode of CH3NH3+, C–N stretch, C–N rocking of CH3NH3+, symmetric and asymmetric modes of CH3 bending, symmetric CH3 bending, asymmetric CH3 bending, symmetric NH3+ stretch, and asymmetric NH3+ stretch, respectively. A new sharp peak at ∼1469 cm−1 also shows the MAPbI3 growth that corresponds to the C–N deformation mode (symmetric NH3 bend), together with the symmetric CH3NH3+ stretch modes and its clusters with H2O at ∼3185 cm−1 and ∼3400 cm−1, respectively. Indeed, the differential infrared spectra confirm the MAPbI3 growth at 100–150 °C (Fig. S13i-b†), with a peak at ∼1472 cm−1 (symmetric NH3 bend of CH3NH3+).39 The C–N vibrational mode appears at ≤150 °C; however, a peak at 1430 cm−1 (asymmetric CH3 bending mode) for the growth at 150–200 °C also appears due to the MAPbI3 degradation. The intensity of asymmetric NH3 bending mode at ∼3130 cm−1 is significantly weak at ≥150 °C due to the perovskite degradation, ultimately disappears at ≥200 °C as soon as the perovskite decomposes.
The MAPbI3 growth on GO is also studied using in situ transmission infrared spectra to compare with its growth on Si/SiO2. The vibrational modes of functional groups of GO are given in Fig. 4a including ethers (C–O), epoxides (C–O–C), ketones (CO), overlapping carboxyls and sp2-C (COOH, CC), and hydroxyls (C–OH/COOH) at ∼800–1250 cm−1, ∼1276 cm−1, ∼1500–1650 cm−1, 1650–1750 cm−1, and 3000–3500 cm−1, respectively.48 Upon initial spin coating of the MAI and PbI2 precursors on the 3–5 layered GO thin films, the stretch mode of Pb(CO3)2 and the asymmetric stretch mode of the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters appear at ∼1410 cm−1, ∼1376 cm−1, and ∼1643 cm−1, respectively, in addition to the overlapped peaks of C–O, C–O–C and CO/COOH from GO (Fig. 4b). The peak disappearing at ∼1644 cm−1 in the infrared differential spectra confirms the removal of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters at 20–80 °C (Fig. 13ii-a and b†), which also appears at higher temperatures (>80 °C, Fig. S13ii-c and d†). In contrast to the MAPbI3 growth without GO, a peak appears at ∼1473 cm−1 together with the peak of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n at ∼1650 cm−1 (Fig. 4e). The fact that the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters are monitored even after the growth at 60–150 °C (Fig. 4c–e), and the presence of Pb(CO3)2 at ≤150 °C explains poor conversion of MAPbI3 on GO due to the oxygen-induced defects formed at the film interface. Similarly, a few recent studies at the MAPbI3/TiO2 interfaces confirm that the defects induced by non-stoichiometry, also known as the interfacial oxygen vacancies,49 and possibly oxygen trapped in the grain boundaries present in the underlayers,50 reduce the charge injection at the interface and increase the recombination allowing hysteresis.51 Herein, we only demonstrate formation of oxygen-induced defects that form in GO/RGO, and the physical defects in the perovskites can be discussed in the future studies. As discussed earlier, the MAPbI3 morphology also generates the bead-like texture in the fiber-structured perovskites representing the nucleation of precursors in the presence of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters on GO, explained by the in situ infrared absorbance spectra (Fig. 4). The C–O and CO formation (new peaks at ∼1100–1300 cm−1 and at ∼1500–1650 cm−1 in Fig. 4f–h and S13ii-d–f†) at >150 °C show that the defects are formed during thermal reduction of GO producing RGO, while the MAPbI3 growth occurs at a low yield. A peak at 1750 cm−1 appears at ≥150 °C, which corresponds to the carbonyl (CO) groups in reduced GO (RGO, Fig. 4f). In thermal reduction of GO, the carbonyl formation indicates defect formation because of the decomposition of epoxides, which incorporates into RGO as the hydroxyls, and thereby modifies the RGO composition. As discussed in an earlier study,30 these defects form due to the epoxide ring opening at the moderate temperature anneals (≥175 °C) since trapped water in GO reacts with the out-of-plane oxygen groups (i.e. hydroxyls and epoxides).29 As a result, the infrared intensity of the vibrational modes corresponding to CO (relative to the initial oxygen amount in GO) at high temperatures represents defect formation upon removal of the out-of-plane epoxides from RGO (see disappearance of the modes at ∼1280–1320 cm−1). Meanwhile, the epoxide groups of GO (see the peak at 1276 cm−1 at 20–150 °C) are maintained at temperatures below 175 °C and do not react with the MAI and PbI2 precursors, while the hydroxyl groups (∼3250–3500 cm−1) disappear at ≥20 °C after the precursor deposition on GO.
Different from the earlier reports focusing on the defect formation in RGO at the elevated temperatures (≥∼175 °C),30,52 we observe interfacial oxygen defects initiated at room temperature after spin coating of the perovskite precursors on GO. Prior to any chemical interaction at the elevated temperatures, the GO thin films consist of ether (C–O), hydroxyl (C–OH), carboxyl (COOH), carbonyl (CO), and epoxide (C–O–C) oxygen functional groups upon deposition on Si/SiO2 at room temperature (Fig. 4a). The C–O and C–OH groups later disappear because of the halide anion interactions at room temperature (Fig. 4b). In other words, GO is reduced chemically prior to any heat treatment that initiates at room temperature (Fig. 3b). However, the epoxides are present after the precursor deposition on GO at room temperature (Fig. 4b). The peak at ∼1276 cm−1 in GO (Fig. 4a) only disappears at high temperature generating defects. Moreover, the out-of-plane hydroxyls react with HI at room temperature that generates water as a by-product (Table 1j). HI further interacts with water leading to the acidic environment and a release of free iodide anion (reaction (a)). HX + H2O → H3O+ + X−(a) X− + H2O → HX + OH−(b)

The iodide anions also react with the hydroxyls at the edges and with the out-of-plane hydroxyls on the basal plane of GO via the nucleophilic substitution reactions,53,54 which can remove hydroxyls from GO (reaction (b)). Therefore, the MAPbI3 nucleation differs on GO initiated by the iodide anion attack on the carbon atoms of GO bonded to the hydroxyl groups that is different from its nucleation on Si/SiO2. Indeed, the presence of water as the reaction by-product introduced from the precursor deposition increases formation of the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters, which is another major reason for the poor growth of MAPbI3 on GO. The epoxides of GO remain in RGO up to 130 °C indicating that HI is consumed (reaction (a)) to produce extra water (reaction (b)) rather than reacting with the epoxides. At ≥130 °C (Fig. 4f–h), the normalized infrared absorbance spectra indicate the removal of epoxides from GO and formation of the C–O/CO groups (see the increased infrared absorbance at ∼1100–1250 cm−1 and at ∼1500–1750 cm−1 in Fig. 4f).30 As a result, MAPbI3 does not nucleate at high yields due to the presence of oxygen and excess water enhancing the acidity, and generating by-products rather than the perovskite. In other words, since the iodide anions are readily hydrated, water and oxygen prevent the MAPbI3 growth on GO. This is why the bead-like structures of MAPbI3 on GO do not form at high temperature confirming the interfacial modification. Indeed, the Pb(II) halides are known to be the Lewis acids in the presence of polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, which control the crystal growth and morphology of the perovskites.55 The presence of PbX2 is therefore another source of the increased acidity with the effect of oxygen and moisture, generating chemical reactions at the interfaces.
The presence of metallic lead is analyzed by the Pb 4f XPS spectra given in Fig. 5 with the peaks at 137.2 eV and 142 eV that are present after spin coating of MAI and PbI2 on Si/SiO2 at 130 °C (Fig. 5a), on GO at room temperature (Fig. 5b), and at 130 °C (Fig. 5c). The peaks at 138.8 eV and 143.7 eV correspond to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2, respectively, for the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 (Fig. 5a).56 After deposition of the perovskite precursors on GO at room temperature (Fig. 5b), the Pb(CO3)2 peaks appear at 139.3 eV and 144.2 eV,47 which is consistent with the appearance of the peak at ∼1410 cm−1 in the infrared absorbance spectra prior to heat (see Fig. 4b). Indeed, the deconvolution of peaks at 137.6 eV and 142.4 eV represent the presence of PbO2,57 also analyzed by the small peaks at ∼3000–3200 cm−1 with the N–H stretch modes in the infrared spectrum (Fig. 4b). The presence of unreacted PbI2 is indicated by the peaks at 138.75 eV and 143.7 eV upon deposition on GO at room temperature. Pb(CO3)2 is shown to exist on the film surface at 130 °C based on the Pb 4f XPS analysis (Fig. 5c), which is consistent with the finding from the infrared analysis representing the removal of Pb(CO3)2 at ≥150 °C (Fig. 4e–h). Moreover, the I 3d5/2 XPS spectrum of the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2 does not indicate any PbI2 peak at 130 °C, only shown with the peak at 619 eV for MAPbI3 (Fig. 5d), confirming the MAPbI3 growth on Si/SiO2. However, I 3d XPS spectrum of spin-coated MAI (618.6 eV) and PbI2 (619.6 eV) on GO monitors unreacted PbI2 (Fig. 5e) at room temperature,58 which is present for the MAPbI3 growth on GO at 130 °C (Fig. 5f) with unreacted PbI2. I 3d5/2 XPS spectrum also confirms that the MAPbI3 growth on GO is highly poor, indicated by the precipitation of PbI2 at 130 °C (Fig. 5f). The unreacted PbI2 is known to be advantageous for the MAPbI3 growth based on the earlier studies resulting in the increased solar cell device performance, which can passivate the defects.59 Nevertheless, PbI2 is not beneficial for the MAPbI3 growth on GO because of the excess oxygen provided by GO, possible moisture and metallic lead contamination from the PbI2 precursor, and the by-product water released during the interfacial reactions due to the hygroscopic nature of MAI. This finding is consistent with the XRD analysis revealing poor MAPbI3 conversion on GO as well as the infrared spectral changes indicating formation of the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters correlated with the presence of Pb(CO3)2 that does not disappear at 130 °C, possibly because of the presence of unreacted PbI2.

The vertical dotted lines indicate the position of the MAPbI3 bands. 
To understand and compare the nature of interfacial defects occurred during the MAPbI3 growth on GO, the MAPbBr3 growth is studied on Si/SiO2 (Fig. 6i) and on a 3–5 layered GO thin film (Fig. 6ii). The presence of 2θ° ∼ 14.5 and 2θ° ∼ 30 correspond to the (001) and (002) cubic orientation of MAPbBr3 at 20–150 °C (Fig. 6i-a–c). The peak at 2θ° ∼ 34 is ascribed as the degradation of MAPbBr3 at ≥150 °C (Fig. 6i-c–f). Therefore, the MAPbBr3 growth occurs at room temperature prior to the high-temperature treatment, which is explained by selectively higher reactivity of the MABr and PbBr2 precursors. The hygroscopic nature of MABr is characterized by the stretch mode of C–OH at 3000–3200 cm−1 in Fig. 7a that shifts to ∼3400–3500 cm−1 (Fig. S14b–e†) once PbBr2 is introduced (Fig. S14b†) that is similar to the introduction of MAI and PbI2 (Fig. 5a–e), but does not prevent the MAPbBr3 growth. The resistance of bromide anions to the presence of moisture and oxygen environment is an advantage to achieve the MAPbBr3 growth on GO. This is because of the stronger hydrogen bonding between the CH3NH3+ cations and the bromide anions in contrast to the MAPbI3 growth leading to a highly stable, water- and oxygen-resistant MAPbBr3.60 Moreover, the shift of 2θ° ∼ 14.5 to 2θ° ∼ 15.3 in the XRD analysis of MAPbBr3 growth on GO indicates that the symmetry disorder occurs after spin coating of the precursors on GO (Fig. 6ii-a), which is then reoriented to 2θ° ∼ 14.5 at 100–150 °C (Fig. 6ii-a and c). In addition, MAPbBr3 degrades at ≥150 °C with the presence of peaks at 2θ° ∼ 34 (Fig. 6ii-d–f) resembling the MAPbI3 degradation on GO.

The dotted lines indicate a baseline for each of the infrared spectrum obtained after subtracting the infrared spectrum of Si/SiO2. 
For a typical MAPbBr3 growth on Si/SiO2, the N–H bending mode (symmetric NH3+) at 1477 cm−1 appears in the infrared absorbance spectra (Fig. S14b†) after spin coating of MABr and PbBr2 that represent the MAPbBr3 growth at room temperature. The peak at ∼1477 cm−1 (symmetric NH3 bend)39 is maintained at ≥100 °C. Indeed, the presence of vibrational modes at 914 cm−1, 970 cm−1, 1255 cm−1, 1385–1390 cm−1, 1424 cm−1, 1589 cm−1, ∼2120–3000 cm−1 (small peaks), 3137 cm−1, and 3185 cm−1 confirm the MAPbBr3 growth. These peaks are assigned to the CH3NH3+ rock, C–N stretch, CH3NH3+ rock, symmetric CH3 bend, asymmetric CH3 bend, asymmetric NH3+ bend, the anharmonically coupled modes of MA cations and the CH3 stretch (symmetric and asymmetric), symmetric NH3+ stretch and asymmetric NH3+ stretch, respectively. Furthermore, the blue shift to ∼1428 cm−1 (asymmetric CH3 bend)39 represents the degradation of MAPbBr3 at ≥150 °C (Fig. 7e). Moreover, the differential infrared spectra of the MAPbBr3 growth on Si/SiO2 with the N–H bending mode (1477 cm−1) reveal the growth of a stable perovskite structure at 150–200 °C (Fig. S15i-c†). Indeed, the CH3NH3+ rocking mode at ∼914 cm−1 is another indication for the MAPbBr3 growth at room temperature, which is originally at 953 cm−1 for MABr (Fig. 7a) prior to the MAPbBr3 growth. The N–H bending mode (symmetric NH3+ peak at 1477 cm−1) also represents achievement of the MAPbBr3 growth on GO after spin coating of the MABr and PbBr2 precursors at room temperature (Fig. 7b–f), at a higher yield than the MAPbI3 growth on GO that is maintained at 150–200 °C (Fig. 7f). In contrast to the MAPbI3 growth on GO, the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters and Pb(CO3)2 do not form after the initial precursor deposition. The peak at 1385 cm−1 assigned to the CH3+ bending mode of MAPbBr3 also confirms that there is no indication of Pb(CO3)2. The absence of Pb(CO3)2 may indicate higher purity of the PbBr2 precursor in contrast to PbI2. Moreover, the differential infrared spectra show that MAPbBr3 is highly thermally stable on GO at high temperature (150–200 °C, Fig. S15ii-e†). The N–H bending mode further disappears at >150 °C, and indicate degradation of MAPbBr3 on RGO.
The increased infrared intensity of the peak at 1650 cm−1 (CC/CO, Fig. 7b) after the precursor deposition (i.e. MABr and PbBr2 from a DMF solution) on GO is explained by the formation of carbonyls (CO) in addition to the initial concentration of the carbonyl groups present in GO (Fig. 7a). The additional carbonyls is associated with the significant loss of epoxide groups of GO after the precursor deposition (see the peak at ∼1286 cm−1 in Fig. 7b relative to the initial epoxide concentration in GO). Therefore, the bromide anions attack on the epoxides of GO during precursor deposition at room temperature, transforming into the CO groups, because of the trapped water interactions. The remaining epoxides (see the small peak at ∼1284 cm−1 in Fig. 7b–g) later disappear at ≥150 °C.30 The carboxyl formation in RGO at 100 °C during the MAPbBr3 growth on GO (Fig. 7e) also indicates the introduction of defects into the RGO/MAPbBr3 interface, that are then transformed to carbonyls (CO) at ≥150 °C (Fig. S15ii-d and e†). We note that the broad peak at ∼3423 cm−1 shows the presence of hydrated DMF at ≤100 °C in addition to the C–OH stretch modes of the carboxyls of GO. However, these oxygen-induced defects in GO introduced at room temperature do not prevent the MAPbBr3 growth on GO (Fig. 7b). Since the removal of hydroxyls and carboxyls of GO occurs after the precursor deposition for the MAPbBr3 growth at room temperature (i.e. the C–OH stretch mode at ∼3500 cm−1 disappears in Fig. 7b), a nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place with HBr. Meanwhile, the excess hydroxyls generate in RGO (see C–OH at ∼3250–3500 cm−1 in Fig. 7b–e) because of the ring opening of epoxides that is terminated by the bromide anions. Indeed, the hydroxyls of GO are replaced by the bromide anion attack.54 Different from the MAPbI3 growth on GO, the epoxide removal in the case of the MAPbBr3 growth on GO generates the oxygen-induced defects terminated by the carbonyl groups at room temperature as a result of the ring opening of epoxides, thereby distraction of the π-conjugation occurs in GO. This is possibly because of the lower cumulative formation constants (in logarithmic scale) of PbBr3− (2.50) and PbBr4− (2.04) in water compared to those of PbI3− (3.14) and PbI4− (4.43) leading to the weaker bonding with the water clusters, and the effect of lower binding affinity of the bromide anions (i.e. the weaker bromide-water coordination).61 Another possible path may be the role of highly reactive precursors that initiate the MAPbBr3 growth at room temperature since they weakly bind to water. The high reactivity of the MABr and PbBr2 precursors in DMF is therefore responsible for the MAPbBr3 growth on GO even though the oxygen groups of GO react with the bromide anions, that is different from the MAPbI3 growth. In the case of MAPbI3 growth on GO, the iodide anions strongly bind to water generating HI and attack only on the hydroxyls and the carboxyls of GO, but cannot facilitate the growth efficiently. Consequently, MAPbBr3 grows on GO even though the oxygen-induced defects are formed in GO and eventually GO is reduced forming RGO. Obviously, the nucleophilic substitution reaction takes place selectively for the MAPbBr3 growth on GO leading to the defect formation led by the bromide anions rather than HBr. Moreover, the initial precursor reactivity overcomes the nucleophilic attack of the anion because of poor binding affinity of the bromide anions in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, the bromide anions weakly bind to the positively charged carbon centers, but then cleaved easily to promote the MAPbBr3 growth. Since the reactive precursors lead the MAPbBr3 growth at room temperature, the oxygen-induced defects in RGO do not affect the perovskite crystallization. The Pb 4f XPS spectra of the MAPbBr3 growth on SiO2/Si (Fig. 8a) and on GO (Fig. 8b–c) are also shown with the presence of 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks at 138.8 eV and 143.7 eV, respectively. Different from the growth mechanism of MAPbI3 on GO, metallic Pb is present in the MAPbBr3 growth on Si/SiO2 at 130 °C (Fig. 8a), shown with the peaks at 136.9 eV and 142 eV, which is removed upon precursor deposition on GO (Fig. 8b) (and at 130 °C, Fig. 8c). Therefore, MAPbBr3 grows on RGO without any metallic Pb formation. In contrast, metallic Pb is present in the MAPbI3 growth on both Si/SiO2 (Fig. 5a) and GO (Fig. 5a–c), different from the MAPbBr3 growth. The Br 3p spectra (Fig. 8d–f) do not show any changes for the MAPbBr3 growth on GO with the representative Br 3p3/2 and 3p1/2 XPS peaks at 182 eV and 189 eV, respectively (Fig. 8d–f), and confirm that the bromide anions do not form strong bonds at the MAPbBr3/GO interface.

Although the MAPbCl3 growth is successfully achieved on Si/SiO2 (Fig. S16i†), the MAPbCl3 growth on GO indicates the presence of symmetry disorder at 20–150 °C, characterized by the XRD patterns at 2θ° ∼ 35–37 (Fig. S16ii†). As the in situ infrared absorbance spectra collected at 60–300 °C (Fig. S17†) suggest, the N–H bending mode (symmetric NH3+ bending mode of CH3NH3+)39 is monitored at 1486 cm−1 that confirm the MAPbCl3 growth on Si/SiO2 upon spin coating of MACl and PbCl2 precursors without observing formation of any Pb(CO3)2 or the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters (Fig. S17i-b†). At ≥100 °C, a slight blue shift of the N–H bending mode to ∼1481 cm−1 occurs, which indicates degradation of the perovskite. However, the MAPbCl3 growth on GO is significantly poor – similar to the growth of MAPbl3 on GO, confirmed by the differential infrared spectra in Fig. S18ii.† The spectrum of GO is subtracted from that of GO with spin coated precursors to monitor the chemical interactions between the oxygen groups of GO and the halides of precursors at room temperature. Even though the MAPbCl3 growth on GO occurs at room temperature (see the small peak at 1490 cm−1 in Fig. S17ii-c†), there is a significant oxygen removal in GO because of vigorous interactions after the precursor deposition. Moreover, MAPbCl3 significantly decomposes at ≥150 °C (Fig. S17ii-f and g†) having a negligibly small N–H bending peak at 1490 cm−1. The differential infrared spectra also confirm that the MAPbCl3 growth on GO is poor and chemically unstable upon exposure to heat (Fig. S18ii-d and e†). Moreover, the Pb 4f XPS spectra indicate the presence of metallic Pb (Fig. S19a–c†), while the Cl 2p XPS spectra do not show any formation of the metallic lead after the precursor deposition at 130 °C (Fig. S19d–f†).
Upon spin coating of the MACl and PbCl2 precursors on GO at room temperature (Fig. 9c), the epoxide (C–O–C, 1284 cm−1), carboxyl (COOH, 1756 cm−1) and aldehyde/ketone (carbonyl, CO at 1652 cm−1) groups disappear (see the weak infrared intensity at ∼750–1500 cm−1) at room temperature (Fig. S17ii-b†). The infrared intensity of the epoxide peak at 1284 cm−1 is weaker after the precursor deposition (Fig. S17ii-b†) that starts disappearing at ≤150 °C (Fig. S19ii-d†) – similar to the epoxide loss for the MAPbBr3 growth on GO (Fig. S15ii-d†). Meanwhile, the carbonyl formation (ketones) at 1654 cm−1 represents the presence of defects because of the epoxide removal in RGO at room temperature (Fig. S17ii-b†). In addition, carbonyls (aldehydes/ketones) form at ≥150 °C (Fig. S18ii-d†), because of trapped water interactions in GO. Therefore, the interfacial defects appear starting with the epoxide removal at room temperature. In contrast, the epoxide removal and the carbonyl formation do not occur at room temperature for the MAPbI3 growth on GO. The infrared differential spectra show that the hydroxyls and carboxyls of RGO are also removed after the precursor deposition at room temperature for the MAPbCl3 growth on GO (Fig. S18ii†), while their removal initiates at ≥60 °C for the growth of MAPbI3 (Fig. S13ii†) and MAPbBr3 on GO (Fig. S15ii†). As a result, the MAPbCl3 growth on GO is not achieved because the chloride anions destroy RGO by producing HCl with the presence of defects in RGO formed after the precursor deposition, thus prevents the MAPbCl3 growth on GO. Although there is a small N–H bending mode at ∼1490 cm−1 (Fig. S17ii-b–f†) highlighting the MAPbCl3 growth, the N–H bonds are later destroyed at high temperatures.

The in situ micro Raman spectra are also collected at 633 nm as a function of the temperature to monitor the MAPbX3 growth on GO. For the MAPbI3 growth on GO, two Raman bands at 130 °C are attributed to the stretch modes of CH3NH3–I (95 cm−1) and Pb–I (112 cm−1) (Fig. S20b†). For the MAPbI3 growth, the increased Raman intensity of the Pb–I stretch mode after heating precursors on GO explains the presence of unreacted PbI2 (Fig. S20a†). The Raman intensity ratio of PbI2 to CH3NH3–I is reduced when compared with the Pb–I band intensity of PbI2 (Fig. S20c†). The broadening of Raman bands (D′ at ∼1348 cm−1 and G at 1594 cm−1) is maintained after the precursor deposition on GO at room temperature with a broad band at 1474 cm−1 (Fig. S21a†), attributed to the CH3 asymmetric mode of DMF, which is then removed at 130 °C (Fig. S21b†). The blue shift of D′ band to 1335 cm−1 and the red shift of G band to 1605 cm−1 is attributed to the chemical doping with the oxygen at the film interface during the MAPbI3 growth at 130 °C. The increased Raman intensity of D′/G ratio from 0.98 to 1.00 represents the oxygen-induced defects in RGO. For comparison, the in situ micro Raman analysis is performed at 633 nm for the MAPbBr3 growth on both Si/SiO2 and GO (Fig. S22†). The Raman intensity D′/G ratio is 1.04, 1.14 and 1.01 for the MAPbBr3 growth on GO after the precursor deposition at room temperature, and at 60 °C and 130 °C, respectively. The increased D′/G ratio at 60 °C from 1.04 to 1.14 also confirms the presence of oxygen-induced defects in RGO (Fig. S22b†) that are removed at 130 °C during the MAPbBr3 growth on GO, represented by the reduced Raman intensity of D′/G from 1.14 to 1.01 (Fig. S22c†).
Defect mechanisms
The MAPbX3 growth is performed in argon with the precursors (i.e. MAX and PbX2) introduced from an anhydrous DMF solution. The resulting films are then dried in vacuum with a careful sample transfer in a nitrogen glove box, and the GO thin films are kept in nitrogen prior to the transfer into the thermal stage. Although the experimental efforts minimize possible exposure of the reactions to water, we find that several other factors determine the yield of perovskite growth on GO that involves the halide activity and their binding affinity in water, the solubility order of the perovskite precursors in DMF solution, formation of the acidic by-products, their acidic strength, and the effect of growth temperature. The infrared absorbance and differential spectra indicate that the source of moisture-oxygen present is the increased hygroscopic nature of MAI by the addition of lead halide in addition to the oxygen groups of GO. The stretch mode of water with the hydroxyls (C–OH) at ∼3400 cm−1 in the absorbance spectra appear as a broad peak after the lead halide (PbX2) addition in anhydrous DMF (Fig. 3b, 7b and S17ii-b†). The peak at 1643 cm−1 of the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters explains that the metallic lead can form hydrated complexes due to the effect of moisture. The absence of hydroxyls in the absorbance spectra of the MAI, MABr and MACl precursors (Fig. 3a, 7a and S17ii-a†) confirm that the major source of moisture is PbX2. In the moisture ambient, the complexes such as (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O are also likely to form since DMF is miscible with water.62 Moreover, the increased reactivity of the I− > Br− > CI− anions is determined by their solubility order in the presence of water, depending on the order of the solubility constants of PbI2 (1.66 ± 0.36 × 103 mol kg−1) > PbBr2 (2.67 ± 0.13 × 10−2 mol kg−1) > PbCl2 (3.907 ± 0.004 × 10−2 mol kg−1) at 298.15 K.63 Furthermore, the anion solvation energies are given in the order of I− > Br− > Cl− in polar solvents (water).64 Indeed, the high degree solubility of PbI2 in the DMF solution in moisture-oxygen environment determines the reaction yield of the MAPbI3 growth on GO. Therefore, the reactivity of hydrated halide anions with the oxygen groups of GO and their strength of the binding affinity to water are critical for the perovskite growth. Eventually, the oxygen-induced defects modify the GO/MAPbX3 interface that initiate at room temperature because of the interfacial chemical reactions of hydrated halides of the precursors with the oxygen groups of GO. The resulting perovskite texture and morphology on GO is therefore a result of the interfacial interactions between the precursors, water and the oxygen functionalities of GO. Possibly, the resulting film surface can terminate with possible hydrated perovskite complexes such as (CH3NH3)4PbI6·2H2O as the reaction by-products,47 especially for the MAPbX3 growth on GO, which needs further investigation for the stoichiometry control and the film quality.
We perform theoretical calculations to estimate the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the proposed chemical reactions of the lead halide precursors, the reaction by-products and the oxygen groups of GO summarized in Table 1. Both cis and trans configurations are taken into account for these calculations since the position of the halides of MAX (X = I, Br, Cl) with respect to the C–N and N–H bond directions of MA+ (CH3NH3+) determines the Gibbs free energy of the reactions. The calculations in Table 1 involve reactions of the precursor dissociation (a–f) and decomposition (g–i), and reactions between acid by-products and the hydroxyl (j–l) and epoxy groups (m–z) of GO, given with the ΔGa–z. Moreover, their atomic representations are given in Fig. S23 and S24.† Regarding the cis and trans configurations, for instance, the Cl anion in the direction of C–N bond of MA+ is labelled as the cis position (Table 1e). The trans position represents that the Cl anion is in the direction of N–H bond (Table 1f). The calculations for reactions (a)–(f) indicate that the dissociation of MAI, MABr, and MACl precursors are energetically favorable for the cis configurations. In other words, the dissociation into MA+ and X− is highly exothermic in the cis configuration that occurs with an energy of ΔGa < −0.0024 eV, ΔGc < −0.0016 eV and ΔGe < −0.0019 eV for MAI, MABr and MACl, respectively. Although the MA+ dissociation to CH3NH2 and HX (HI, HBr and HCl) shown in Table 1(g–i) is endothermic, a minimal energy of ΔGg < 0.044 eV, ΔGh < 0.040 eV, and ΔGi < 0.051 eV is necessary to obtain HI, HBr and HCl, respectively, as the reaction by-product. The release of acidic by-products allows reactions with the hydroxyl groups of GO that produces water and the SN2 reactions to occur that are energetically favorable. The cleavage of hydroxyls occurs with HI (ΔGj < −0.078 eV, Table 1j), HBr (ΔGk < −0.048 eV, Table 1k) and HCl (ΔGl < −0.078 eV, Table 1l) that are exothermic. Indeed, the out-of-plane epoxide groups in the trans configuration react with HI (ΔGn < −0.0050 eV, Table 1n), HBr (ΔGx < −0.0055 eV, Table 1x) and HCl (ΔGz < −0.0086 eV, Table 1z) with the exothermic reactions, that produce hydroxyls and the SN2 reactions (i.e. replacement of hydroxyls with the halides). These calculations indicate that the halide anions of the perovskite precursors located on the opposite side of the graphene backbone with respect to the epoxide groups allow the trans configurations to be energetically favorable to cleave.
Overall, HI is the most reactive by-product to destroy the epoxides in GO, while the hydroxyls of GO can be removed by HX regardless the type of halides (see in Fig. 9a–c for the removal of C–OH peaks at ∼3250–3500 cm−1, associated with the free hydroxyls). These exothermic reactions also confirm the presence of interfacial interactions at room temperature between GO and the precursor halides, characterized by in situ infrared spectroscopy. In order to understand the reactions between the oxygen groups of GO and the precursor halides at room temperature, the differential infrared absorbance spectra are further given in Fig. 9. After the deposition of MAI and PbI2 on GO, modification in the structural composition of GO in Fig. 9a does not indicate the removal of epoxides at room temperature. However, the epoxide removal starts at room temperature as a result of the interfacial reactions with HBr and HCl, as shown with the negative peaks at ∼1284 cm−1 and ∼1282 cm−1, respectively. This is because of higher acidity strength of HBr and HCl than HI, and the reaction energies of HBr (ΔGx < −0.0055 eV, Table 1x) and HCl (ΔGz < −0.0086 eV, Table 1z) are larger than HI (ΔGn < −0.0050 eV, Table 1n) for their reactions with the epoxides of GO. Furthermore, presence of the symmetric NH3 bend (MAPbI3) at ∼1477 cm−1 indicating MAPbBr3 growth together with the absence of free hydroxyls (C–OH peak at ∼3250–3500 cm−1) in Fig. 9b confirm that MABr and PbBr2 are highly resistant to the initial moisture environment. For the MAPbI3 growth on GO (Fig. 4a), the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters and their complexes with lead(II) appear at room temperature after the precursor deposition that is characterized by a sharp peak at 1643 cm−1, at 1376 cm−1, (and 1410 cm−1 for Pb(CO3)2) shown by the infrared spectra. The possible mechanisms of Pb(CO3)2 and PbO2 are given with the reactions (c) and (d), respectively, formed as the intermediate products with the effect of hygroscopic environment in ambient conditions.47,65 Indeed, the oxycarbonates with lead(II) complexes are possible to generate through thermal decomposition of Pb(CO3)2 as the intermediate species.66 The formation of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters are hypothetically given with the mechanisms shown in the equilibrium reaction (e) proposed by Garand et al.40 that initiate with the reactions of CO2 and H2O leading to an acidic environment. The hydroxyls of GO can also generate additional HCO3− species in the presence of moisture through a nucleophilic attack given in reaction (f). 2Pb(s) + O2(aq) + 2CO32−(aq) + 2H2O → 2PbCO3(s) + 4OH−(aq)(c) Pb2+(aq) + I3−(aq) + 2H2O → PbO2(s) + 3I−(aq) + 4H+(aq)(d) CO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3(aq) ↔ HCO3−(aq) + H+ ↔ CO32−(aq) + 2H+(aq)(e) OH−(aq) + H2O → HCO3−(aq)(f)
The epoxides and carboxyls maintain in GO, while the hydroxyls initiate the cluster formation with the effect of water residual. The carboxyls are likely to transform into the carbonyls that appears as a small peak at 1575 cm−1. At ≥60 °C, defects initiate with the carboxyl and the hydroxyl removal generating RGO. The MAPbBr3 growth on GO (Fig. 4b) is however initiated by the bromide anion attack on the epoxides of GO leading to a ring opening of the sp2-hybridized conjugated RGO at room temperature, similar to the MAPbCl3 growth on GO (Fig. 4c). The peak at ∼1286 cm−1 disappears after the precursor deposition on GO that confirms the epoxide removal (Fig. 9a, 4b, 3b and c), generating the oxygen-induced defects incorporated into RGO. Although the nucleophilic substitutional reaction initiates the bromide anion attack, the MAPbBr3 growth occurs at room temperature. This is because the bromide anions bind weakly to water with high reactivity of precursors (MABr and PbBr2). While the epoxides are removed, the carbonyls form (see the peaks at 1652 cm−1 and 1575 cm−1) that appear after the precursor deposition on GO, generating defects in RGO. Although the reactivity of bromide anions are lower than the iodide anions; their higher electronegativity60 and the lower solubility of PbBr2 in water,63 allow the MAPbBr3 growth on GO to occur at high yields (Fig. S14b†). Therefore, the MABr and PbBr2 precursors can react at room temperature in DMF, regardless the defects present in RGO. Similar to those oxygen groups in the form of defects at the MAPbI3/RGO interface, the carbonyls can form in RGO during the MAPbBr3 growth at elevated temperatures (≥150 °C) because of the interlayer water interactions (Fig. S14a†). In contrast, most of the oxygen groups of GO react with HCl at room temperature (Fig. 9c) as the MAPbCl3 decomposes on GO, and produce water (see the broad positive peak at ∼3000–3500 cm−1) as the reaction by-product. In addition, the oxygen-induced defects form at room temperature once MACl and PbCl2 are deposited on GO that are confirmed by the negative peaks at ∼1000–1100 cm−1, ∼1282 cm−1, ∼1652 cm−1 and ∼1756 cm−1 corresponding to the removal of ethers, epoxides, carbonyls and carboxyls of GO, respectively.
The polar aprotic solvents such as DMF favor the nucleophilic substitutional reactions (SN1, SN2) with the lead halides as reported by Kim et al.67 The proposed mechanisms (SN1 or SN2) are summarized in Fig. S28† that can occur between the halide anions and the oxygen groups of GO. In the presence of an acidic medium because of the by-products (HI, HBr, HCl) given in Table 1(g–i), which can also form based on reaction (b), SN2 favors. The halides of perovskite precursors initiate the oxygen-induced defects, while replacing hydroxyls (Fig. S28a†), epoxides (Fig. S28b†) and carboxyls (Fig. S28c†) from GO by the halide anions, and generate defect sites. Moreover, water is introduced into these reactions from the hygroscopic precursors that reacts with the positively charged carbon stereocenters present in GO as defects, which generate additional hydroxyls. The removal of broad and weak C–OH stretch mode at ∼3300–3600 cm−1 occurs after the precursor deposition on GO for the growth of MAPbI3 (Fig. S13ii-d and e†), MAPbBr3 (Fig. S15b–f†) and MAPbCI3 (Fig. S18ii-c†), supporting the reactions of H2O through deprotonation. The reaction path can produce H3O+, which is the source of H+ for MA to form MA+ and MAPbX3. The formation reaction of I− + H+ → HI is also slightly endothermic by about 0.005 eV, relative to the formation of HBr (0.393 eV) and HCl (0.817 eV).68 Therefore, HI formation is highly favorable. The acidic by-products are also likely to form by following the reaction paths given in Table 1(g–i). Moreover, the acidic strength is in the order of HCl > HBr > HI that emphasizes the strong reactivity of HCl relative to the others. Indeed, in-plane carboxyls and in-plane/out-of-plane hydroxyls of GO disappear at room temperature during the MAPbCl3 growth on GO (Fig. S14c†), and their removal from GO initiates at ≥60 °C for the growth of MAPbl3 and MAPbBr3 (Fig. S15a and b†). Different from the growth of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 on GO, the reaction (b) can produce HCl(aq) and H3O+ with the increased reactivity at elevated temperatures (Fig. S17ii-c†) during the growth of MAPbCl3 on GO.
In the previous studies, MAPbCl3 is reported to be the most unstable compound both kinetically and thermodynamically, compared with MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3.69 In the presence of moisture at room temperature, the following reaction (g) is therefore likely to occur. The degradation of moisture-exposed MAPbX3 is also likely to generate other lead(II) complexes such as hydrates of (CH3NH3)4PbI6·xH2O,70 and follow several different mechanisms to form species such as PbO, PbO2 and Pb(OH)2, as indicated by Huang et al.47 MAPbCl3(s) → PbCl2(s) + MA(g) + HCl(g)(g)
As the reaction (g) suggests, decomposition of MAPbCl3 can generate HCl. As given in Fig. S17ii-b,† the oxygen groups of GO disappear upon deposition of the MACI and PbCl2 precursors on GO, most likely producing water (see C–OH peak at ∼3250 cm−1) at room temperature (see the differential spectra in Fig. 9c). Meanwhile, HCl is likely to generate because of the reactions with water. Apart from the oxygen interacting with water, oxidation of RGO during the MAPbCl3 growth can also occur because of HCl as the strong acid that generates protonated hydroxyls and defects in RGO at room temperature. We demonstrate with the spectroscopy studies that the GO/MAPbCl3 interfaces are mainly functionalized with the carbonyl (CO) groups because of the strong oxidation due to HCl (Fig. S17ii-c†). Although the reactivity of chloride anions is lower than the iodide and bromide anions, they can attack on the protonated carbon bound to the hydroxyls of RGO and produce H2O. Although the nucleophilic substitution reaction encourages reactions between the chloride anions and the oxygen groups of GO, decomposition of MAPbCl3 producing HCl prevents the perovskite growth. Alternatively, degradation of MACl into the volatile hydrochloric acid (HCl) and the methylamine species is possibly facilitated by the residual water and the oxygen groups of GO.71 At high temperature, there is no additional change in the functional groups of RGO, and only the carbonyls form at ≥150 °C because of the reactive trapped water resulting in defect formation in RGO. Consequently, the major reactions occur after the precursor deposition at room temperature that prevent the MAPbCl3 growth on GO.
The removal of oxygen groups generates RGO at room temperature; thereby reactivity and solubility of the precursors in moisture-oxygen ambient, and the binding affinity of halides determine selective interactions that increase at elevated temperatures (≥60 °C), especially for the reactions between MAI, PbI2 and the oxygen groups of GO. In order to investigate and confirm these interfacial interactions and their impact on the interface morphology between the MAPbX3 perovskites and GO/RGO, we perform cross-sectional SEM analysis (see the images for the MAPbI3/GO-RGO interfaces in Fig. S25† and the MAPbBr3/GO-RGO interface in Fig. S26† shown with different magnifications). For this purpose, the thick films of GO (∼200 nm) are prepared and kept in nitrogen prior to the perovskite growth. Then, the growth of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 on these GO films occurs at 130 °C for 2 hours in nitrogen. Moreover, the GO thick films are annealed at 200 °C for 2 hours in nitrogen to prepare RGO. Later, the growth of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 on RGO is performed at 130 °C for 2 hours in a nitrogen environment. The cross sectional SEM images of resulting film stacks are given in Fig. 10 in order to examine the interface morphology after the perovskite growth on GO/RGO. The MAPbI3/GO interfaces indicate that an interfacial layer forms as oxygen traps (see Fig. 10a and b) between MAPbI3 and the GO films, resulting in a morphology modification at these interfaces, and confirm the interfacial interactions between MAI, PbI2 and the oxygen groups of GO. The presence of voids (Fig. 10b) and the interfacial gaps (Fig. 10c) at these MAPbI3/GO interfaces is explained by the poor adherent halide precursors that prevent formation of a uniform film on GO, the presence of interfacial water, and trapped by-products (i.e. HI, Pb(CO3)2, PbO2, etc.) that resemble the imperfections observed for the MAPbI3/TiO2 interface.56 Similar skin-depth interfacial defect layers present at the MAPbI3/PEDOT:PSS interface are found to reduce PCE for the devices.72 Although, the voids are present at the MAPbI3/RGO interface (Fig. 10d and S25a–c†), confirming the impact of oxygen-induced defects, the interfacial layer does not form at such interfaces (see Fig. S25d and e†). To compare, both MAPbBr3/GO and MAPbBr3/RGO interfaces do not form an interfacial layer, voids and gaps, as shown in Fig. 10e and f, respectively. The MAPbBr3/RGO interfaces form a layer with different crystallographic orientation (Fig. 10f) that is associated with the symmetry disorder that forms at ∼60–100 °C, as observed from the XRD analysis in Fig. 6ii(a and b). The presence of symmetry disorder at the MAPbBr3/RGO interface but not at the MAPbBr3/GO interface confirms hydrophobicity of the RGO surface that generates the crystallographic disorder during the growth of MAPbBr3.

Conclusions
We find that the reduction of GO takes place chemically at room temperature due to the interaction of halide anions of the perovskite precursors with the oxygen groups of GO. Based on our experimental findings, the reduction of GO takes place during processing of perovskite deposition before the perovskite growth initiates. Using a combination of analytical testing including in situ spectroscopy, microscopy and diffraction techniques, we obtain differences in the growth of perovskites and their interactions with the oxygen groups of GO in the presence of moisture ambient that the precursors introduce.
We find that MAPbX3 (X = I, Cl) fails to grow at ∼130 °C because of poor conversion in the presence of oxygen defects incorporated in RGO, while MAPbBr3 grows efficiently on GO. The surface and interface characterization of the perovskite growth on GO/RGO reveals that the oxygen-induced interfacial defects form at the MAPbX3/GO interface, which may hinder the growth of perovskites depending on the reactivity of initial precursors. We explain the interfacial modification with the nucleophilic substitutional reactions that involve perovskite precursor dissociation and decomposition, as well as reactions between acid by-products and the oxygen groups of GO. The reactivity order of I− > Br− > CI− anions, and selective solubility of the perovskite precursors in water (i.e. moisture ambient from the precursors) thus determine the reaction mechanisms. In other words, the presence of moisture in the precursors increases chemical reactions with the oxygen groups of GO, which controls the morphology and texture of the resulting perovskite. The precursor reactivity in DMF in the presence of moisture introduced by the precursors at room temperature allows the oxygen-induced defects to initiate during the MAPbX3 growth on GO as soon as the precursors are deposited at room temperature.
The initial precursor reactions therefore result in textures with beads having high porosity, independent from the types of halides, and these beads nucleate at high temperature while the perovskite growth occurs. Initial precursor deposition on GO at room temperature also forms textures with the smooth surfaces during the perovskite nucleation, but the beads fail to form. This texture change is one indication of the interfacial reactions between the precursors and the oxygen groups of GO facilitating the formation of oxygen-induced defects at the MAPbX3/GO interface. Since the formation of beads may not be the direct evidence for the poor perovskite growth and the defect formation, the chemical composition of nucleated texture as beads is necessary to investigate for the structural analysis of MAPbX3 perovskites, particularly for their growth on GO. Furthermore, GO is chemically reduced at room temperature because of the interfacial chemical interactions upon deposition of perovskite precursors. Surprisingly, the reduction of GO takes places at room temperature because of the halide anions of precursors reacting with the oxygen groups of GO. The change in the reactivity order, binding affinity of the halide anions and the reactivity of the perovskite precursors with moisture result in uncontrolled oxygen defects in GO forming chemically reduced GO (RGO). The moisture trapped between perovskite and RGO films in the form of (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters also plays an essential role in the production of oxygen-induced defects at the MAPbX3/RGO interface.
The poor MAPbI3 growth on GO is attributed to the unreacted PbI2 when deposited on GO. The high solubility of PbI2 in water and its relatively high binding affinity promote PbI2 hydration, which prevent chemical reactions with MAI. For this reason, the MAPbI3 growth on GO occurs at a very low yield. At high temperature, water as a nucleophile can deprotonate in an acidic medium by producing H3O+. As a result, the formation of by-products such as HI, HBr and HCl, for the growth of MAPbI3, MAPbBr, and MAPbCl3, respectively, contributes to the formation of hydroxyl-terminated defects in RGO. The presence of Pb(CO3)2, PbO2, (HCO3−)·(H2O)n and unreacted metallic lead states during the growth of MAPbI3 on GO is another evidence for poor perovskite conversion. The formation of Pb–O bonding as a result of oxygen interactions with Pb2+ states is also found by Li et al. when GO is sandwiched as an amphiphilic absorber between MAPbI3 and the HTL leading to the improvement for the interface wettability.73 Based on the first-principles calculations by Volonakis et al.,20 a nanoscale ferroelectric suppression and distortion of the octahedral tilt occurs at the atomic level at these GO/MAPbI3 interfaces by a displacement of the first iodine(I) sublattice from the first MAPbI3 monolayer. Because of those octahedral rotations with an electronic charge transfer at the interface, electron–hole recombination is eliminated that confirms initial precursor halide interactions with the GO layer. The mechanism is yet elusive, and needs to be investigated. Moreover, the reduced graphene scaffold as an interfacial layer between TiO2 and MAPbI3 is shown by Tavakoli et al. to improve the crystallinity of the perovskite interface,74 which also supports our finding that the presence of oxygen in the graphene layer causes distorted symmetry disorder due to the presence of unreacted PbI2.
In contrast to the MAPbI3 growth on GO, the MAPbBr3 growth occurs once the precursors are deposited on GO at room temperature. In this process, the (HCO3−)·(H2O)n clusters disappear with heat, which allows the perovskite conversion to occur at a high yield. The relatively lower reactivity of bromide anions in water, highly reactive MABr and PbBr2 precursors therefore speed up the growth on GO, regardless of the reactions in the moisture-oxygen environment. The MAPbBr3/GO interfaces are functionalized with the carbonyls in RGO, similar to the MAPbI3 growth on GO, however, an interfacial layer, voids or interfacial gaps do not form. Moreover, the unreacted metallic lead states are not present at the MAPbBr3/GO interface.
In contrast, the MAPbCl3/GO growth occurs at room temperature, but MAPbCl3 decomposes at elevated temperature because the chloride anions form HCl with moisture provided by the hygroscopic precursors that reacts with the oxygen groups of GO. The chloride anions remove the hydroxyls, epoxides and COOH/CO groups from GO because of the interactions with HCl at room temperature. Indeed, highly acidic environment destroys the sp2-conjugation of RGO, and the carbon-dangling bonds react with moisture to form additional carbonyls. Therefore, the reaction initiates a nucleophilic substitution path, but HCl production destroys the graphitic conjugation and prevents the perovskite growth at a high yield. The presence of unreacted lead states also strongly indicate highly defective MAPbCl3/GO interfaces.
This work is fundamental to understanding nature of the oxygen-induced defects nucleated at the GO/RGO interface during the growth of lead halide perovskites, and determining whether the perovskite film qualifies for device designs. Apart from the oxygen-induced defects at the GO/MAPbX3 interface, future studies are crucial to investigate the point defects and trap states associated with the vacancies of Pb, and MA cations and X halide anions.75 The mass spectroscopy techniques are also valuable to examine defect states during thermal processing as the next study in order to understand the ion interactions at the GO/MAPbX3 interfaces.76 Our findings for the chemical reduction of GO during perovskite growth at the time of processing taking place at the GO/MAPbX3 interfaces therefore brings further insights to investigate additional reduction mechanisms that may occur during solar cell fabrication, particularly as a result of photocurrent generation by visible-light irradiation. This work thus encourages in situ thermal growth-light irradiation studies with creative cell designs to monitor unknown defect mechanisms, and motivates the search for radiative traps, and methylammonium-disordered domains in the presence of orthorhombic crystalline phases due to radiative recombination states that may evolve during solar cell measurements with prolonged illumination.77
In particular, this study guides applications for the perovskite solar devices to optimize the design parameters since this study shows that the differences in halide anion reactivity of the perovskite precursors modify the MAPbX3/GO interface. Our findings strongly suggest that RGO is necessary to use prior to the precursor deposition for the elimination of protonation that accelerates the interfacial growth and nucleation mechanisms, and the oxygen defects both in the film and at the MAPbX3/RGO interface. A recent study by Kakavelakis et al. has confirmed that RGO doped PCBM increases device stability allowing hysteresis-free devices, which is attributed to the stabilization of PCBM/perovskite interface with introduction of RGO.78 Therefore, approaches like doping ETL/HTL layers with RGO and GO–Li insertion (i.e. chemical functionalization of GO with Li) as shown by Agresti et al. provide increased stability in solar cell devices,79 which requires fundamental understanding for the physical and chemical mechanisms. Advancements in graphene interface engineering for solar cell fabrication is therefore critical to achieve scale-up manufacturing.19 Moreover, high purity of the precursors is essential for the MAPbX3 growth on RGO at high yields that can prevent by-product formation to increase the resulting quality of the perovskite film grown on RGO. Our findings also suggest that the MAPbBr3 growth on RGO may lead to winning optoelectronic designs with improvements in device stability, thereby addressing performance-related issues.
Experimental methods
GO thin film fabrication
GO powder is purchased from the Cheap Tubes Inc. GO thin films (3–5 layers) and the thick films of ∼200 nm are prepared by a vacuum filtration technique, and deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates (Silicon Quest Inc., double-side polished, n-doped, Cz 〈100〉 with a resistivity of 1–30 Ω.cm, and a 10 nm of thermal oxide).31 Prior to any film deposition, the Si/SiO2 substrates are cleaned with treatments using acetone, isopropyl alcohol and water, and are also treated with the Nano-Strip solution purchased from Cyantek Inc. to remove the organic residual. Later, GO thin films are deposited on these clean surfaces.
Perovskite growth
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I), methylammonium bromide (CH3NH3Br), methylammonium chloride (CH3NH3Cl), lead(II) iodide (PbI2), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2), and lead(II) chloride (PbCl2) precursors are purchased from Millipore-Sigma Inc. or Dyesol Inc. These precursors are dried under vacuum for a week, and are kept in a nitrogen glove box. For the MAPbX3 growth, methylammonium halide and lead(II) halide precursors are introduced at a molar ratio of 1:1 into anhydrous DMF (Millipore-Sigma Inc.) at room temperature in a nitrogen glove box. The resulting concentration of each perovskite precursor solution is set at 40 wt%. The perovskite film thickness is optimized for ∼10 nm using 5–10 μl of the precursor solution by spin coating for the MAPbX3 growth on a clean Si/SiO2 substrate or on a GO thin film in nitrogen environment.
Powder XRD
The spin-coated methylammonium halide and lead(II) halide precursors on a clean Si/SiO2 substrate or on a GO thin film are heated at 20–300 °C for 30 min on a hot plate in a nitrogen glove box. A laser heat gun controls the sample temperature to achieve the high temperature precision. After cooling samples to room temperature in a nitrogen glove box, the XRD data are collected. In order to perform the XRD analysis, a Bruker D2 Phaser benchtop is operated at a maximum operating power of 30 kV and 10 mA. The XRD scans are performed using a coupled θ–2θ mode in the range of 2θ = 5–65° with a count time of 1 second and the step size of 0.02°.

In Situ FTIR
A Thermo Nicolet 670 spectrometer equipped with a KBr beam splitter and a MCT/A detector is used. The precursor solution is spin-coated on a Si/SiO2 (n-type, CZ, 〈100〉 silicon with a 10 nm of thermal oxide), and placed at a ∼70° of Brewster's angle with respect to the normal mode. Each spectrum is collected 500 times, and averaged three times to obtain the spectra collected at 600–4000 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. A Linkam sample stage is combined with the spectrometer for in situ studies, equipped with a temperature controller, a computer interface controller, and a chiller. Each sample is transferred in the thermal cell in a nitrogen glove box to avoid the environmental water adsorption and protect the samples from moisture. The thermal stage is also continuously purged with argon gas during the perovskite growth to prevent any moisture. For the thermal experiments combined with the infrared analysis, the heating/cooling rate is set at 10 °C min−1, held for 30 min/T (°C), and the spectrum is collected at 20 °C.
SEM
A JEOL JSM-7500F Field Emission SEM is used to collect the top-down images applying an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and an emission current of 10 μm using a secondary electron detector at a working distance of 6 mm in z-direction. The cross-sectional images are captured with the same accelerating voltage and the emission current of 9500 nA using the working distance of 11.9 mm and the slow scan speed.
XPS
The XPS measurements are performed in an UHV chamber (base pressure = 2 × 10−10 Torr) using a Scienta Omicron Argus electron energy analyzer operating at 20 eV pass energy and an unmonochromatized Al Kα X-ray source.80 The samples are loaded into a sample introduction chamber and then transferred into the analysis chamber, where the measurements are performed without any further sample treatment. The curve fitting is performed using the Casa XPS software using a Shirley background and a 50–50 Gaussian–Lorentzian mix line shape. For calibration, silver paste is used as the conductive path between ground and Si/SiO2 and the GO/MAPbX3 thin films. All binding energies are referenced to the Ag 3d peaks at 368 and 374 eV (Fig. S29†).
AFM
The scanning probe microscope Veeco MultiMode 8 is performed at the PeakForce tapping mode. The NanoScope software is used to analyze the film thickness with the height profile fittings. An antimony (n-) doped Si tip (0.01–0.025 ohm cm) is purchased from Bruker, and is used for probing the GO/MAPbX3 thin films.

In situ micro Raman
A Renishaw InVia Raman microscope equipped with a 50 objective is used. The excitation source is the 633 nm line from a He–Ne laser and the spot size is estimated to be less than 2 μm. The laser power is carefully set at the possible low power to avoid the laser heating of the specimen. A Linkam sample stage is combined with the microscope for the in situ studies. The stage is equipped with a temperature controller, a computer interface controller, and a chiller. Each sample is transferred in the thermal cell in a nitrogen glove box to prevent any moisture. The thermal stage is continuously purged with argon gas throughout the perovskite growth to avoid any water contamination into the cell. The heating/cooling rate is set at 10 °C min−1, held for 30 min/T (°C), and each Raman spectrum is collected at 20 °C.
Theoretical methods
The Gibbs free energy is calculated using the Gaussian 09 program with the theory level of B3LYP/6-311G. The effective core potentials are used for Pb and I. The effect of solvent molecules is also described by the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM).
