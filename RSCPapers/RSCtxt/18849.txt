    , Accepted 27th January 2012First published on 14th February 2012AbstractCrystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaics are robust, manufacturable, and Earth-abundant. However, barriers exist for c-Si modules to reach US$0.50–0.75/Wp fabrication costs necessary for subsidy-free utility-scale adoption. We evaluate the potential of c-Si photovoltaics to reach this goal by developing a bottom-up cost model for c-Si wafer, cell, and module manufacturing; performing a sensitivity analysis to determine research domains that provide the greatest impact on cost; and evaluating the cost-reduction potential of line-of-sight manufacturing innovation and scale, as well as advanced technology innovation. We identify research domains with large cost reduction potential, including improving efficiencies, improving silicon utilization, and streamlining manufacturing processes and equipment, and briefly review ongoing research and development activities that impact these research domains. We conclude that multiple technology pathways exist to enable US$0.50/Wp module manufacturing in the United States with silicon absorbers. More broadly, this work presents a user-targeted research and development framework that prioritizes research needs based on market impact.

Broader context
The photovoltaics community must be able to clearly identify and communicate the commercial implications of their research to have maximum impact on grid penetration levels. This study gives researchers the tools and background to calculate the cost impact of new technology and prioritize research topics based on market needs. We have developed an industry-validated bottom-up cost model for c-Si wafer, cell, and module manufacturing, and use it to assess the cost reduction obtainable from line-of-sight manufacturing innovation and scale, as well as advanced technology currently under development. We determine that technology must advance more rapidly than is called for by current industry roadmaps to enable subsidy-free utility-scale adoption of c-Si PV by the end of the decade and that multiple technical pathways exist to reach this target.

1. Introduction
Photovoltaics (PV) are expected to be cost-competitive without subsidies in the United States at module costs of US$0.50–0.75 per peak watt (Wp).‡ These module costs should enable electrical production in the US southwest at a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)1 of US$0.06/kW·h, on par with current baseload fossil-fuel electrical utility plants.2,3 Solar PV may be cost-competitive even sooner in other markets, such as residential installations where customers typically pay retail rates between US$0.10–0.20/kW·h.3,4 Herein, we develop a cost analysis framework to determine whether domestically-manufactured crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV can reach the most aggressive boundary of the “grid-parity” range, US$0.50/Wp.
Current c-Si manufacturing costs are two to three times higher than the US$0.50/Wp target, raising questions of whether insurmountable cost barriers exist for this technology. One reason for today's high cost is poor silicon feedstock utilization (3–9 g/Wp, grams of silicon per peak watt at the module level, compared to thin film technologies at 0.025–0.15 g/Wp, grams of absorber material per peak watt), primarily because of ingot crystallization methods, low material yields during wire sawing,5 wafer breakage at reduced thicknesses,6 and a lower infrared optical absorption coefficient generally requiring substrate thicknesses >25 μm.7 Additionally, the covalent nature of silicon-silicon bonds, in combination with an indirect bandgap, results in poor defect tolerance,8–12 which necessitates high-purity or defect-engineered material. The high capital equipment costs associated with processing discrete wafers and significant process complexity further increase the manufacturing costs of c-Si PV.
Nevertheless, c-Si offers many technical advantages which translate into customer value and contribute to c-Si PV's current market share of over 85%.13 Many factors determine the total value and LCOE that a PV system provides a customer, including: module costs, installation costs, balance-of-systems costs, the ability to acquire and terms of project financing, and performance warranties. Crystalline silicon PV excels in the non-module cost components of customer value because of high module efficiency (14–20%), low technical risk, and low performance degradation (80% output warranties after 25 years). This success is directly attributable to (1) material properties of silicon that align with the needs of high performance photovoltaics (Fig. 1) and (2) the robust research, development, and manufacturing history of silicon PV.
 Fig. 1  Crystalline silicon's material properties enable low-risk, high performance PV devices. 
Crystalline silicon solar cells benefit from a material system that provides many advantages for PV devices. Si is purified by well-established distillation or directional solidification, as most efficiency-reducing impurities have low solid solubilities in diamond-cubic c-Si.14,15Silicon forms a naturally passivating16 and chemically robust surface oxide, inhibiting bulk material degradation.17Silicon can trap light efficiently because of its large refractive index, which provides an optical path length of up to ∼51 times the wafer thickness for incoming infrared light.18Silicon can be doped both n- and p-type, resulting in efficient homojunction devices. Lastly, silicon is non-toxic, the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and has the capacity to satisfy global demand at TW deployment levels.19
Crystalline silicon solar cells also benefit from a long development history and sustained advancement. The first modern c-Si solar cells were fabricated over 57 years ago with efficiencies of 6%.20 Since these early beginnings, standardized methods of feedstock purification,21crystallization,22 junction formation,23 impurity gettering,24–26 bulk and surface passivation,27,28 wire sawing,29 and device characterization30–32 were effectively transferred from the laboratory to production. These advancements have helped improve the record c-Si cell efficiency to 25%,33,34 reduced the performance gap between industrial and lab-champion cells,35 and resulted in steadily declining module manufacturing costs.36 Finally, Si modules have well-established field reliability,37 resulting in access to low-interest-rate capital for system installation.38
Because of the considerable technological and customer value advantages of c-Si PV, it is worth examining the potential of c-Si modules to reach US$0.50–0.75/Wp cost targets and disruptive utility-scale penetration levels. Reaching US$0.50/Wp costs necessitates advanced concepts not currently in industry roadmaps.39–41 Herein, we analyze the wafer, cell, and module manufacturing cost of c-Si PV, assess the potential to reach the US$0.50/Wp target with an industry-validated bottom-up cost model, and provide feasible technical pathways to achieving this goal.
2. Methods: bottom-up cost model
The bottom-up cost model used in this analysis considers individual elements of the PV module value chain and then adds them together. Alternatively, a top-down approach considers market prices and estimates manufacturing cost through assumed margins and distribution costs. Our model includes thirty cost categories that consider the raw material, operating, and capital costs associated with wafer, cell, and module manufacturing. Inputs are taken from a variety of academic and industrial sources.5,42–44 The scope of the model is consistent with the guidelines for determining cost of goods sold (COGS) according to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States.45 Our methodology considers the straight-line depreciation§ of capital investments and does not consider internal margin. A manufacturer uses the COGS, as well as the net sales of products, to calculate their tax liability. Our COGS approach is consistent with other cost estimates of PV manufacturing.44,46
Alternatively, a manufacturer might need to decide if, where, and when they should construct a new manufacturing facility. This type of analysis must identify the best financial investment for the firm. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is considered in this case. WACC is calculated by considering financing from debt, preferred stock, and equity, as well as inflation, taxes, risk premiums, and the expected returns of the financial market.47 The rate of return of the proposed investment (calculated with the projected cash flows of the project) must be greater than the WACC for the project to add value to the firm. Consideration of these terms are required to upgrade our COGS analysis presented herein to a formal investment decision calculation, the results of which are observed to vary substantially depending on regional financial conditions, including local subsidies and tax rates.
The model assumes a large-scale (>350 MW/annum) vertically-integrated manufacturer located in the United States that purchases silicon feedstock from an external supplier, then fabricates wafers, cells, and modules internally. Although the U.S. c-Si PV industry is dominated by module manufacturers, a total output of approximately 400 MW/annum is available from two vertically integrated firms.48 This assumption exposes the cost structure of wafer, cell, and module manufacturing to the model. The costs for a firm that sources wafers or cells through external suppliers located in the U.S. will be similar to the estimates given below. However, a U.S. manufacturer that sources wafers or cells internationally will have a significantly different cost structure that is not represented below. The model has been validated through consultation with industry experts that collectively represent the entire PV industry value chain (feedstocks to system integration) and comparison of outputs to other cost estimates of current PV production.4,46,49
Three cases were considered with the model: standard multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) technology in 2012, a line-of-sight innovation scenario in 2020, and our proposed advanced technology concept in 2020 (Section IV). The line-of-sight scenario assumes successful adoption of near-term to medium-term innovations that are already on industry roadmaps,40,41 including: polysilicon price reductions, increased module efficiency from cell architectures such as selective emitters,50 reduced bulk defect density from pseudo-mono ingot production,51 reduced silicon utilization with improved wire sawing, reduced material costs from Ni/Cu plating processes,52 and incremental manufacturing improvements. Table 1 provides the critical inputs to the model for these cases, though many additional parameters are considered. These inputs were taken from a variety of government and industrial sources.3,40,41,53,54 We note that the base labor cost shown does not include the cost of benefits and taxes, which are included in the analysis.55 The model was implemented in Microsoft Excel and is available for free from the MIT Photovoltaic Research Laboratory, at http://pv.mit.edu/TMA/.

3. Results
3.1 Cost estimates for 2012 and 2020
The model was first used to establish the baseline manufacturing costs of a standard multicrystalline silicon module in 2012, as shown in Fig. 2 (data in Table 2). The estimated cost is US$1.29/Wp for a US manufacturer. We note that current market prices are unsustainable at this cost level.56 In 2020, the line-of-sight scenario is estimated to yield module manufacturing costs of US$0.89/Wp (Fig. 2). If the historical rate of innovation is maintained, the US$0.50/Wp target will be reached sometime near 2030 for a US manufacturer.

We identified an advanced concept scenario in which module manufacturing costs reach US$0.52/Wp by 2020 (Fig. 2). In order to form the concept, we identified specific innovation areas with large cost reduction potential. In Section IV we develop performance targets for these innovation areas and argue that current research justifies our assumptions by briefly reviewing literature and industry trends that could enable our model inputs.
3.2 Sensitivity analysis of current cost structure
A sensitivity analysis of the 2012 cost structure was completed to identify key innovation areas that provide a technical pathway to US$0.50/Wp. We defined sensitivity as percent module cost change divided by percent input variable change (2% used), and plotted this quantity against the maximum cost savings available per category (Fig. 3). Three levels of cost influence can be easily identified. The strongest levers, module efficiency and manufacturing yield, are labeled in red and affect all cost categories of the module. The maximum cost savings available to increasing efficiency are restricted by theoretical limits,57 while manufacturing yield is restricted to 100%. The next group, labeled in blue, are the largest categories of module cost: silicon, depreciation, labor, and metal paste. The maximum cost savings for these levers are found when their costs are removed from the system entirely. Module cost is less sensitive to the remaining factors, labeled in green, which are less significant categories of the cost structure. We note the unique position of manufacturing yield in Fig. 3. Although the absolute cost reduction potential for today's technology is small because net yields are currently above 90%,44 the potential to increase module cost with decreasing manufacturing yield is very high given the sensitivity of the factor. Thus, the possibility of reducing manufacturing yield presents a significant barrier to new technology adoption.

4. Discussion: pathways to achieving US$0.50/Wp
In order to form our advanced technology concept, we identified new technologies in three innovation areas, primarily in high-sensitivity cost-categories, that achieve the US$0.50/Wp goal but are constrained to be feasible given ongoing, aggressive, progress in research and development. The innovations, targets, and savings relative to the line-of-sight scenario (Fig. 2) are in three areas. First, a low-cost high-efficiency cell architecture (22.5% cell, 20.5% module) reduces module cost by US$0.15/Wp. Next, silicon utilization is reduced below 0.6 g/Wp, a reduction of current silicon requirements by ∼10 times, and reduces costs by US$0.13/Wp. Finally, advanced manufacturing methods and module designs that enable high yield and throughput manufacturing, while reducing process complexity, labor content, and capital expenditures, reduce cost by a further US$0.09/Wp.
We argue that the innovations shown in Fig. 2 are achievable within the 2020 time horizon by reviewing specific technology pathways that would achieve the necessary cost reductions in each innovation area. This is a feasibility exercise, i.e., a representative list of specific technology options for reaching US$0.50/Wp module target cost, rather than a prescriptive or exhaustive list of technology options. We note that there are a multiplicity of technology pathways for achieving US$0.50/Wp module cost. Fig. 4 summarizes the parallel technical pathways presented in the next section. Several unique subsets and combinations of these innovations could provide the required cost reductions to achieve the US$0.50/Wp module target.
 Fig. 4  Parallel technical pathways are available to achieve the $0.50/Wp module cost target. A combination of concepts collectively increase efficiency and manufacturing yield, as well as reduce silicon utilization, labor content, and capital cost. 
4.1 Enabling innovation area #1: high-efficiency cell architecture for thin wafers
As indicated in the sensitivity analysis (Fig. 3), improved solar cell conversion efficiency is a major driver for c-Si module cost reduction, as cost scales inversely with efficiency for all area-dependent cost components. We sought routes to improved efficiency that are compatible with the remaining cost category targets (e.g., thin wafers with high manufacturing yield). Thus, lower-temperature cell processes may be favored to reduce thermal stresses. Further, any novel cell architecture must be low-cost (both operating and capital expenditures), while achieving excellent light management, low surface recombination velocity, and defect mitigation.
Potential candidate cell architectures adapted to thin c-Si wafers include back-contacted cells58,59 and the HIT cell.60 The back-contacted cell structure offers improved carrier collection by eliminating shadow loss from front contacts and enables a greater degree of flexibility for independently tuning optical and electronic properties. The HIT cell architecture offers numerous advantages for thin wafers: (1) all low-temperature processing, (2) a symmetric structure that eliminates bending from a mismatch of front and rear stresses, and (3) excellent surface passivation. Sanyo recently demonstrated a high, 747 mV Voc on HIT cells with 58 micron thick wafers.61
Surface recombination has a greater impact on cell efficiency with decreasing wafer thickness.62 Experimental measurements of 14 μm thick interdigitated back-contact c-Si solar cells found that the efficiency ranged from 1.24% to 14.9% depending solely on the quality of the surface passivation.63 Outstanding surface passivation will be necessary for high-efficiency thin silicon cells. SiO2 and Al2O3 passivation layers provide excellent passivation to both p- and n-type silicon.64–67 Recently developed in-line atomic-layer deposition has demonstrated a throughput of almost one wafer per second.67–70

          Silicon has a low optical absorption coefficient in the near infrared and requires effective light trapping to maximize absorptance in industrial solar cells. PC1D71 simulations demonstrate that with industry-standard surface texturing, using alkaline or acidic etching, there is essentially no loss in efficiency for layer thicknesses down to 25 μm.7 However, implementing standard light trapping technologies on thin substrates (25–50 μm) without breakage presents a significant challenge.
1D simulations also suggest that thin absorbers have the potential to reduce performance sensitivity to bulk recombination losses. Reduced cell thickness reduces the required minority carrier diffusion length, while increased carrier density increases Voc.57 These trends make it tempting to disregard bulk defects in thin devices. However, experimental results indicate that inhomogeneously distributed bulk defects, especially grain boundaries, can lower cell efficiency in thin substrates.72,73 These defects appear to compromise junction quality of thin devices by locally reducing the junction barrier height, resulting in higher J0 and lower Voc..74 To achieve high-efficiency devices using thin, potentially kerfless silicon materials, it will be critical to identify the defects responsible for limiting cell performance, establish defect tolerances, and develop manufacturing-appropriate defect mitigation technologies.
Prior work demonstrated 21.5% cell efficiency on 50 μm thick c-Si substrates,75,76 showing that a combination of these efforts represent a credible technical path toward low cost, high-efficiency, thin Si PV devices.
Various pathways are also available for improving efficiency at the module level. The use of anti-reflective glass has demonstrated module efficiency improvements on the order of 3% relative.77,78 Reducing the overall series resistance, through optimization of the module interconnections, will increase the fill factor of the module and has also been shown to improve module efficiency by approximately 3% relative.79
Though not addressed in the cost analysis presented, energy yield (kW·h/Wp/module lifetime) regulates the levelized cost of electricity produced (US$/kW·h), the parameter of merit for grid competitiveness. This parameter can also be increased with innovation, including: reducing mismatch losses by employing power electronics to track maximum power point (MPP) on the module or sub-module level,80,81 reducing module operating temperature via improved heat management design,82 reducing the temperature degradation coefficient by increasing Voc,83 and sorting cells by MPP84 under various illumination conditions to minimize performance degradation under low-light conditions.
4.2 Enabling innovation area #2: improved Si utilization
The cost of the silicon substrate can be reduced by decreasing the cost of solar-grade silicon feedstock (SoG-Si) and reducing the total volume of silicon used per wafer.
The cost of SoG-Si can be decreased via more efficient purification methods. However, limited savings are available as the cost of silicon is already near its lower limit (US$10/kg by upgraded metallurgical grade-Si,85US$20/kg by standard Siemens86). More significant cost reduction is possible by reducing the total volume of silicon used per wafer. Currently, industrial wafer thicknesses are approximately 180 μm with Si utilization yields of 45–55% due to kerf loss (sawdust) from squaring, brick finishing, and wafering operations.5,44 Improved wire sawing and kerfless approaches provide technical pathways to overcome this barrier.

Improved wire sawing. 
Wire sawing is currently used to slice bricks into wafers. The amount of material consumed during wafer slicing is strongly dependent on wire diameter, type, and cutting speed.87 Wire diameters of 120 μm are commonly used for the slicing of standard wafers, although wires as small as 80 μm are currently available.88 Small-diameter wires reduce kerf loss, but also wire strength, requiring slower cutting that results in lower throughput. Electroplated89 and resinoid90diamond-coated wires are currently replacing slurry-based methods and offer higher productivity and ease of recycling the kerf material. The generally accepted minimum wafer thickness achievable by sawing is 80 μm,91 although thinner has been demonstrated with a yield penalty.


Kerfless approaches. 
Many organizations have attempted to produce high-quality, cost-effective, thin, kerfless silicon wafers directly during growth.¶92–94 Early developments focused mostly on growth from melt. These included vertically grown ribbon: edge-defined film-fed growth,95 string ribbon,96 and dendritic web.97 Alternative ribbon growth methods, utilizing a horizontal growth direction, have also been investigated to increase throughput.98 These included SiliconFilm sheet material99,100 and ribbon growth on substrate.94 Others attempted to grow c-Si substrates directly from a gaseous phase.101
Many of these techniques faced serious challenges because of high capital equipment costs, low manufacturing throughputs, non-standard wafer dimensions incompatible with standard cell manufacturing equipment, and/or high bulk defect densities. With the exception of string ribbon, kerfless wafer growth is not currently found in commercial production.
Recently, a new wave of kerfless silicon wafer manufacturers emerged.|| Most use a variant of the following three technical approaches: (1) exfoliation or spalling of silicon wafers from an ingot,20,84 (2) growth of wafers directly from a silicon melt, and (3) chemical vapor deposition of silicon on a release layer or sacrificial substrate. Although most designed their processes to avoid the challenges of the first generation of kerfless wafer growth technologies, further research and development is necessary to reduce defect density, improve form factor, ensure high industrial throughput, and establish process robustness.

4.3 Enabling innovation area #3: manufacturing and module innovations
Module cost can be further reduced through advanced manufacturing methods and module designs that (1) enable the use of thin high-efficiency cells with high manufacturing yield and throughput, (2) reduce labor content through enhanced automation and process simplicity, (3) reduce the capital expenditure required to construct a manufacturing facility, and (4) reduce input material costs.
Reducing wafer breakage and increasing the net yield of the manufacturing process has a cost impact comparable to increasing efficiency, but the potential savings provided by yield improvements is limited due to already high net manufacturing yields of approximately 90%. Current yields for wafering, cell processing, and module fabrication steps are above 95%, with best-in-class yields near 98%.5,44 Large-scale, statistically meaningful experiments have provided insight into wafer handling and breakage modes.6 To reduce breakage, wafer surfaces must be devoid of microcracks of a critical length (which decreases with wafer thickness)102 and wafer-handling systems must apply a constant load instead of a constant deflection.103 The interaction of bulk microdefects on internal stress can be quantified with infrared birefringence imaging104 and Raman microspectroscopy.105 One promising way to reduce breakage is to reduce the mechanical stress imparted on wafers by reducing the number of wafer handling steps, (e.g., the monolithic architecture presented below) or improving wafer handling processes (e.g., such as contactless, magnetically levitated silicon wafer transport systems).106
Yield and throughput can be improved by blurring the traditional lines between cell and module manufacturing. A monolithic module assembly, in which cells are fabricated while attached to the module glass, could greatly increase the ease of process automation as well as reduce wafer breakage through the inclusion of a supportive substrate. This would represent a fundamental shift in module fabrication, blending the traditionally discrete operations of cell fabrication and module fabrication. This method could also increase process simplicity and reduce labor content through the integration of interconnection and lamination into a single step. This approach is ideal for the back-contacted cell architecture discussed above, where a pre-metalized ‘printed circuit’ style back-sheet could be used for coplanar interconnection, eliminating the bottleneck of tabbing and stringing.107 Such a process has already been demonstrated at a module assembly throughput of one cell per second.108 On-laminate laser soldering is an alternative approach that avoids string handling by lasing through the module glass to solder the bottom side connections.109
Low-temperature processing is favored to support monolithic module manufacturing and more generally to reduce thermal stress in thin wafers. Additionally, wet bench steps should be eliminated to reduce breakage and improve yield. Laser-based processing provides these capabilities and has become more appealing based on cost and throughput over the past decade.110,111 The combination of economical high-powered lasers and galvo mirrors enables112 a transition from 1D (laser edge isolation) to large-area 2D processing (surface texturing, emitter patterning). By exploiting the wide range of available wavelengths, pulse durations, repetition rates, and pulse energies, laser-techniques have been demonstrated for many cell fabrication steps including: doping,113,114 antireflective coating,114,115 and contact firing.116 Laser-techniques are uniquely capable of providing local energy application and heating, potentially reducing the electricity needed for thermal processes and enabling simultaneous processing of integrated components with significantly different thermal budgets. E.g., emitter diffusion and encapsulant cross-linking require thermal processing at significantly different temperatures; local energy application via laser processing might enable effective emitter diffusion without disturbing the encapsulant, a situation not possible with broad energy application (e.g., furnace anneal).
Automation levels must be increased in a cost-effective manner to reduce the labor cost (and related inflation risk) of the manufacturing operation. The PV industry has already begun to adopt very high levels of automation throughout the supply chain.117,118 Further improvements in automation could be enabled through the cell and module innovations outlined above. Additionally, an in-line kerfless wafering process could replace ingot crystallization and wafer slicing, the most manual steps in PV manufacturing.118 In addition to reducing labor content, process simplification enables reductions in the cost of constructing a manufacturing facility, (e.g., the replacement of crystallization furnaces, sawing stations, and ingot handling equipment with a single kerfless wafer machine).
Input material costs for manufacturing can be reduced through a variety of methods. Frameless, laminated, modules can eliminate mechanical redundancies and reduce cost.119 Likewise, high-strength encapsulants have the potential to enable thinner glass (1.1 mm) without compromising module strength.120 Lastly, the materials used to manufacture devices must be abundant and scalable. The PV industry currently uses approximately 10% of annual worldwide silver production.121 Low-cost, earth-abundant replacement metals currently explored include copper and nickel,52 both good electrical conductors but fast-diffusers in silicon. Low-temperature contact formation is a key challenge for these systems, both to prevent shunting and to reduce mechanical stress in thin wafers.
4.4 Breakthrough concepts
Above, we summarized technological innovations that could enable US$0.50/Wp by 2020. In this section, we briefly mention some longer-term research areas that could significantly improve silicon-based cell efficiencies. Although both fundamental aspects and the manufacturability of these concepts remain to be demonstrated, we highlight approaches that could radically alter the cost structure of silicon photovoltaics.
Higher efficiencies (up to 72% under concentrated light) are theoretically possible through tandem cell architectures.122 A variety of earth abundant silicon-germanium structures, both amorphous and crystalline, have been explored, however, the record conversion efficiencies of Ge/Si architectures remain lower than 15% because of losses from current-matching, light-induced degradation, partial transparency, and low carrier lifetimes and mobilities.123,124 Other Si-based tandem concepts could yield higher efficiency while still using earth-abundant materials. For example, Cu2O and several other earth abundant compounds125 have band gaps that are well-matched to realizing a high-efficiency tandem structure with silicon. However, any new pairing must exhibit band offsets, lattice constants, and current matching appropriate for current flow between silicon and the tandem partners. A 4+ terminal design can avoid some of these issues; however, such designs require appropriate interconnects and photon management (e.g., spectral splitting126,127 or inter-device transparent contacts).
Alternatively, band structure engineering could yield silicon-based devices with significantly higher conversion efficiencies. For example, the intermediate band photovoltaic effect128 and the related impurity photovoltaic effect,129 both seek to introduce new optical transitions in silicon at photon energies less than the band gap. This sub-gap absorption could lead to larger photocurrents without decreasing cell voltage under appropriate conditions.130 A silicon-based IBPV device has a theoretical efficiency limit of 56% under concentrated light.131 Other approaches are also under consideration to increase the absorption coefficient of silicon. For example, silicon in non-equilibrium phases, such as the Si-XII phase, is predicted to have a direct band gap of 1.2 eV.132 If methods of stabilizing these phases could be found, thinner silicon layers could be used.
Apart from efficiency, advanced light trapping approaches could enable new cell geometries or low-cost deposition techniques. For layers below ∼25 μm, even ideal Lambertian trapping yields significant losses due to transparency. Alternative approaches have recently been investigated133–135 that could exceed the Yablonovitch limit by utilizing plasmonic coupling into waveguiding modes of yet thinner Si layers. Alternatively, photonic crystals or grating elements could be used to improve light-trapping through superior reflection, diffraction and refraction.136 At cell thickness below 25 μm, silicon utilization is no longer a main cost driver, but such concepts may enable crystal growth processes that inherently produce very thin films.
The references include a more complete literature review regarding both general137 and specific trends, including the intermediate band effect,138 light trapping by plasmonic and other methods,133,139 tandem silicon structures140 and other potential breakthrough concepts.
5. Conclusions
A cost analysis framework is a valuable tool for assessing research objectives from a market perspective. With our cost model, we have identified critical innovation areas and outlined several routes by which domestic manufacturers of crystalline silicon based photovoltaics could meet the US$0.50/Wp module cost target in a reasonable timeframe. A variety of parallel technical pathways exist for achieving this target that have not been addressed here, but our proposed concept includes achieving cell efficiencies >22.5% on low-cost thin, <0.6 gSi/Wp, wafers, developing advanced high-yield, low-capital cost methods to process said wafers into modules, and adapting module designs to accommodate thin wafers and high-throughput manufacturing. This framework can be applied to other photovoltaic material systems to generate a clear understanding of potential market competiveness and to guide research priorities.

Broader context
The photovoltaics community must be able to clearly identify and communicate the commercial implications of their research to have maximum impact on grid penetration levels. This study gives researchers the tools and background to calculate the cost impact of new technology and prioritize research topics based on market needs. We have developed an industry-validated bottom-up cost model for c-Si wafer, cell, and module manufacturing, and use it to assess the cost reduction obtainable from line-of-sight manufacturing innovation and scale, as well as advanced technology currently under development. We determine that technology must advance more rapidly than is called for by current industry roadmaps to enable subsidy-free utility-scale adoption of c-Si PV by the end of the decade and that multiple technical pathways exist to reach this target.
