    , Accepted 14th March 2022First published on 15th March 2022AbstractCarbon dots (CDs) have attracted extensive attention for their unique properties and promising applications in many fields. Many efforts have been made to improve the optical and physicochemical properties of CDs using an atomic doping strategy; however, the photoelectric properties of CD-based devices have been less studied and the photocurrent density is far from satisfactory for practical operation. Deep understanding of the doping effects on the electronic structure and photophysical properties of CDs is fundamental and essential for effectively improving the optical and photoelectrical performance of CD-based devices. Here, we have synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co-doped CDs (N, P-CDs) through a one-step hydrothermal approach, and systematically investigated the effects of P-dopants on the improved optical and photoelectric properties of N, P-CDs. The introduction of P atoms into N-CDs significantly changes the electronic structure and extends the absorption spectral region, enhancing the light-harvesting ability of N, P-CDs. Meanwhile, the regulated carrier dynamics have been investigated using time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. We found that the carrier recombination was decreased with introducing P atoms, and the photogenerated electrons in the higher excited states could be efficiently transferred to the lowest excited state. Moreover, the photocurrent density of N, P-CDs was increased by twelve times compared with that of N-CDs. Therefore, the effective doping of P atoms can significantly regulate the electronic structure, optical properties, carrier dynamics and photoelectric conversion of N, P-CDs. The achieved broadband light-harvesting, good photoelectric properties and photostability of the as-prepared N, P-CDs demonstrate an important example of P-doping to improve the optical and photoelectrical properties of CD-based devices.
Introduction
Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted extensive attention for their advantages, such as being metal free and having bright photoluminescence (PL), high photostability, ease of functionalization, low cost, and nontoxicity, and especially for their promising applications for bioimaging,1,2 drug delivery,3,4 photocatalysis,5–7 photoelectric and photovoltaic devices,8,9 and in other fields.10–13 There are two general strategies, the top-down and the bottom-up routes, that have been developed to synthesize CDs with various carbon sources. The former method involves laser ablation, ultrasonic wave chemical oxidation and electrochemical oxidation techniques, while the latter consists of microwave treatment, hydrothermal carbonization, solvothermal synthesis and plasma treatment. The resulting CDs from different methods demonstrate a variety of ambiguous electronic structures and properties.14–20 In the past decade, many efforts have been made to improve the optical and physicochemical properties of CDs using surface functionalization and atomic doping strategies.8 In comparison, the photoelectric properties of CD-based devices are less studied, and the photocurrent density is still very low (<1 μA cm−2), far from the satisfactory value needed for practical application.21–23 Compared with other quantum dots (QDs) such as II–VI semiconductor QDs, perovskite QDs and metal nanoclusters, the low crystallinity, relatively narrow absorption spectral region and low conductivity of CDs are problems to be overcome to improve their optoelectronic properties.8,24
Doping non-metal elements such as nitrogen (N), boron (B), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P) or their combinations into CDs has been proved to be an effective strategy to regulate the electronic structure and optical and photoelectric properties by generating n-type or p-type carriers.24 N-doping is the most common method for changing the CDs into n-type nanoparticles due to its comparable atomic size to carbon. Doping P atoms into CDs could generate relatively more defects to improve the optical and photoelectric performance because the P atom has a larger radius than the C atom. Owing to the dopants’ different bond lengths and atomic sizes, heteroatomic doping in carbonaceous frameworks can change the electronic structures and properties of CDs. For example, Arcudi and co-workers prepared N-doped CDs with a narrow size distribution and abundant surface traps and functional groups, resulting in tunable fluorescence and excellent water solubility.25 Mondal and co-workers reported an efficient charge-carrying capability of N-doped CDs compared with B-doped or P-doped CDs, due to the breaking of π–π stacking and the formation of more defects.26 The single-atom-doped CDs usually have a confined spectral response in the blue or yellow region and demonstrate an excitation-dependent emission, limiting their applications in displays, light harvesting and photoelectric conversion. The co-doping of multiple hetero-atoms provides more variables to regulate the electronic structure and the properties of CDs based on the synergistic effect between the doped elements. As reported, N, P co-doped CDs (N, P-CDs) exhibit significantly different optical and photoelectric properties from those of N-doped CDs (N-CDs) and undoped CDs.24,27 Shi and co-workers found that N, P-doping drastically improves the electronic properties and surface chemical activities of CDs, leading to a bright blue emission applied to the sensitive detection of Fe3+ in living cells.28 Chandra et al. prepared highly bright and stable N, P-CDs using a hydrothermal method in the aqueous environment.29 Gong et al. synthesized hollow and small N, P-CDs with lots of surface groups using a wet-chemical method and applied them as a drug nanocarrier for cancer therapy.30 Although great progress has been made in synthesizing various CDs and exploring their applications in imaging and displays, catalysis and biomedicine, the photoelectric properties of CDs or CD-based devices are far from satisfactory and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Based on the effective optical properties, hetero-atom doping can also be expected to regulate the electronic structure by aligning the energy levels of related states, broadening the spectral response, enhancing the charge separation and reducing the radiative recombination of the photogenerated carriers, thus improving the photoelectrical properties of CDs.31 Briscoe and co-workers modified the functional groups of N-CDs and obtained the highest efficiency of only 0.077% as sensitized solar cells.32 Martindale and co-workers reported the enhanced light absorption and charge transfer efficiency of graphitic N-doped CDs and presented a significantly improved photocatalytic activity.33 Luo et al. found that the N-doping of CDs can effectively prolong the carrier lifetime and enhance the photoelectrochemical activity of the N-doped CD/TiO2 composite for water oxidation.34 So far, developing novel CDs with great intrinsic optical and photoelectrical properties is still a challenge for practical applications. In particular, the electronic structure, electron–hole pair generation and separation, carrier migration and exciton recombination are closely associated with the optoelectronic properties of CD-based devices.34–36 Therefore, a deep understanding of the doping effects on the electronic structure and photophysical properties of CDs is fundamental and essential for effectively improving the optical and photoelectrical performance of CD-based devices.
In this work, we have effectively doped P atoms into N-CDs and synthesized N, P-CDs through a one-step hydrothermal approach using o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and phosphoric acid as precursors and doping agents. The synthesis process for N, P-CDs is illustrated in Scheme 1. The as-prepared N, P-CDs demonstrate significantly broadened absorption and enhanced photoelectric properties compared with N-CDs. We have systematically investigated the effects of P-dopants on regulating the electronic structure, carrier dynamics and photocurrent performance using steady-state and time-revolved spectroscopy. The results indicate that the P-dopants greatly modify the type and density of defects and surface trap states, and improve the photophysical properties of N, P-CDs. The absorption of N, P-CDs has been broadened and extended to a wide spectral region ranging from deep UV to visible light, increasing the light-harvesting ability. The PL spectrum of N, P-CDs demonstrates the independence of the excitation wavelength with an increased lifetime compared with that of N-CDs. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) studies suggest the existence of tail states of N-CDs and regulated carrier dynamics with the introduction of P-dopants. Effective electron migration from higher excited states to the lowest excited state and decreased carrier recombination significantly improve the photoelectric properties of N, P-CDs. The N, P-CD film shows a large saturation photocurrent and photocurrent density, twelve times higher in amplitude than the pristine N-CD film.

Results and discussion
We employed a one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize the N, P-CDs (Scheme 1), in which OPD was used as the carbon and nitrogen source and phosphoric acid as the phosphorus source. The electrostatic interactions between phosphoric acid and amino groups attached to a benzene ring lead to the formation of polymers. When the temperature was controlled at 200 °C, the cross-linking of various polymers was decomposed to form CDs due to the carbonization process. The morphology and crystallinity of as-prepared N, P-CDs were characterized by TEM and AFM images, and the XRD spectrum. As shown in Fig. 1a, N, P-CDs demonstrate a spherical shape with an average size of ∼3 nm and are uniformly dispersed. The high-resolution (HR) TEM image indicates well-resolved lattice planes with a spacing of 2.1 Å, corresponding to the (101) lattice plane of graphitic carbon, suggesting the presence of an sp2 domain. The AFM image (Fig. 1b) shows the height profile of N, P-CDs, ranging from 1 to 5 nm with an average height of 3 nm (Fig. 1c and d), which is consistent with the TEM analyses. The XRD pattern exhibits two broad and intense diffraction peaks centered at 28° and 41° (Fig. 1e), which can be assigned to the (002) and (101) planes of the graphite structure with interlayer spacings of 3.2 and 2.2 Å, respectively.37,38 Meanwhile, TEM and AFM images of N-CDs demonstrate similar morphology features to those of N, P-CDs (Fig. S1†), and a slightly broadened XRD pattern of N, P-CDs compared with that of N-CDs (Fig. S1b†). Due to the P atom having a larger atom radius than N and C atoms, the replacement of a carbon atom with the P-dopant or insertion of a P atom into the interlayer of carbon would change the interplanar spacing and induce lattice strain or even break the π–π stacking interaction, and thus result in the shifting or broadening of the diffraction peak. Considering the almost same-position diffraction peak of N-CDs and N, P-CDs, we suggest that the broadened XRD pattern with P-doping indicates a more disordered structure of N, P-CDs. It should be mentioned that the excessive carbonization temperature of over 250 °C prevents the formation of N, P-CDs and will lead to the aggregation and disappearance of red fluorescence. To evaluate the disorder level of CDs, we carried out measurements of Raman spectra of N-CDs and N, P-CDs on the substrate with excitation at 532 nm. As shown in Fig. 1f, there are two characteristic peaks at 1339 and 1572 cm−1 of N-CDs ascribed to the disordered structure (D band) and graphite status (G band), respectively.39 The apparent change in the ratio of ID/IG from 4.66 for N-CDs to 2.42 for N, P-CDs indicates extensive conjugated sp2 domains and the higher graphitization degree of N, P-CDs.

To prove effective P-doping into N-CDs, we performed FT-IR and XPS measurements to characterize the surface groups of N, P-CDs. As shown in Fig. 1g, the FT-IR spectra of N-CDs show the stretching vibration modes of N–H/O–H (3411, 3477 and 3547 cm−1), CO (1628 cm−1), CC (1505 cm−1) and C–O–C (1137 cm−1),40 confirming the existence of abundant oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups on the surface of graphite-like N-CDs. In addition to the observed stretching vibrations of N–H/O–H (3411 cm−1), CO (1621 cm−1), CC (1517 cm−1) and C–O–C (1137 cm−1), the vibrational intensity of CO stretching for N, P-CDs is obviously enhanced by the doping of P elements (Fig. 1g). Specifically, characteristic vibration modes of PO (1461 cm−1) and P–O–R (1225 cm−1, R = aromatic structure) appear in the spectrum, confirming that P atoms have been doped into N-CDs during hydrothermal reactions.40–42 The XPS measurements provide more evidence about the valence states and compositions to prove effective doping (Fig. 2, Fig. S2 and S3†). The full XPS spectrum of N, P-CDs presents four typical peaks centered at 284.2, 399.1, 530.9 and 132.1 eV (Fig. S2†), corresponding to C 1s, N 1s, O 1s and P 2p, respectively.43 The composition analysis gives the relative elemental contents of C (66.4%), N (7.4%), O (23.7%) and P (2.5%) for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4), and C (66.2%), N (13.6%) and O (20.2%) for N-CDs. The corresponding high-resolution C 1s spectrum can be well fitted into C–P bonds (286.2 eV), CC (284.2 eV) and O–CO (288.0 eV) (Fig. 2a),42 consistent with the observations in FT-IR spectra. The two decomposed bands corresponding to the binding energies 398.5 and 400.5 eV in the N 1s spectrum are ascribed to the N–H and C–NC bonds in N, P-CDs (Fig. 2b).41 The formation of CO and C–O bonds with the doping of P atoms can also be observed in the O 1s spectrum, corresponding to the binding energies 530.9 and 532.2 eV, respectively (Fig. 2c). More significantly, the appearance of the P 2p spectrum, which can be decomposed into two bands at 131.8 and 132.9 eV, indicates the formation of P–C/P–N and P–O bonds in N, P-CDs (Fig. 2d).26 Taken together, we can conclude that the P atom has been successfully doped into N-CDs, generating more defects and surface states to regulate the optical and photoelectric properties of n-type N, P-CDs.

The introduction of P atoms into N-CDs was expected to regulate the electronic structure and optical and photoelectrical properties of N, P-CDs. To optimize the doping contents and monitor the evolution of optical properties, we prepared several N, P-CDs by changing the amount of phosphoric acid in the synthesis. For pristine N-CDs, the UV–vis absorption spectrum shows a single broad absorption band around 410 nm, mainly originating from the n–π* conjugate transitions associated with the carbon core (Fig. 3a).43 With the phosphoric acid concentration increasing from 5 to 15%, this absorption band gradually red shifts accompanied by the appearance of an absorption band around 370 nm and a band around 500 nm, probably originating from the band splitting of the original absorption at 410 nm of N-CDs. When the phosphoric acid concentration is increased to 50%, the absorption spectrum of N, P-CD demonstrates very different features from those of N-CDs. There are four characteristic absorption bands observed at 370, 500, 560 and 610 nm, significantly broadening the absorption spectral region. The absorption spectrum of N, P-CDs is no longer changed when the concentration of phosphoric acid is increased to over 50%, indicating the saturated doping of P atoms (Fig. S4†). The absorption band at 370 nm can be assigned to the n–π* transition in the carbon core.44 It should be mentioned that there is a very weak absorption of tail states in the spectral region longer than 550 nm for N-CDs, which is clearly observed in the transient absorption spectrum. With the increase in of P-dopants, two additional absorption bands at 560 and 610 nm gradually appear and become the influential bands for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4), clearly demonstrating the regulation effect of P-dopants on the electronic structure of N-CDs. The absorption bands at 500, 560 and 610 nm can be assigned to absorption of the defects and surface states. As a possible explanation, the tail states of N-CDs have a much small extinction coefficient. The strong electron-donating P-dopants significantly regulate the type and density of defects and surface states of N-CDs, for example, by forming additional C–P, P–O and PO bonds, and introduce intermediates between π and π* orbitals into N, P-CDs.45 The unpaired electrons in the dangling bonds of surface groups can interact with the P-dopants to form new electronic states. In other words, P-doping not only introduces new states, but also modifies the distribution of defects and surface traps, leading to changes in the electronic structure and optical properties of N, P-CD.31,46 As a consequence, the very weak tail absorption in the longer wavelength region of N-CDs is transformed to a strong absorption of modified defects and surface states, significantly improving the light-harvesting ability of N, P-CDs.

(c) Excitation spectra (dashed line) and emission spectra (solid line) of N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4) under different excitation wavelengths. (d) Fluorescence decay curves of N, P-CDs with excitation at 470 nm. 
Correspondingly, the regulation effect of doping P elements was also observed in the emission properties with changing the concentrations of phosphoric acid (Fig. 3b). Specifically, the emission maximum demonstrates a gradual red shift from 560 nm for N-CDs to 634 nm accompanied by a shoulder emission around 675 nm for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4). This emission spectral evolution of N, P-CDs with different P-dopants is consistent with the absorption evolution. Additionally, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) around 88 nm for N-CDs is remarkably narrowed to around 35 nm for N, P-CDs (15% H3PO4) and 46 nm for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4), further suggesting regulation of the electronic structure by P-doping (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, the PL spectra of both N-CDs and N, P-CDs exhibit independence of the excitation wavelength (Fig. 3c and Fig. S5†), rather than the observed excitation-dependent emission in other CDs.47–51 In the meantime, the PL quantum yield is increased to 12% for N, P-CDs with excitation at 520 nm, compared with 7% for pristine N-CDs with excitation at 480 nm. The relevant quantum yields of N-CDs and N, P-CDs under different excitation wavelength are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.† Consistent with the changes in the absorption spectrum, P-doping into N-CDs also red shifts the emission spectrum and increases the fluorescence quantum yield of N, P-CDs.
To investigate the effect of doping the P element on the carrier dynamics, we measured the time-resolved fluorescence of N, P-CDs with different amounts of phosphoric acid under excitation at 470 nm. As shown in Fig. 3d, the decay curves demonstrate a mono-exponential feature within the time resolution limit of 50 ps. We found that the fluorescence lifetime increases with increasing the P-dopants, from 1.2 ns for N-CDs to 1.3, 1.6 and 1.8 ns for the N, P-CDs with the addition of 5%, 15% and 50% H3PO4, respectively. These changed fluorescence dynamics mainly reflect the regulating effect of P-doping on the carrier deactivation from the surface states.52,53 The decreased recombination rate of photogenerated carrier promotes the charge separation and photoelectric conversion for N, P-CDs devices. Meanwhile, we determined the femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra of as-prepared CDs to gain further insight into the doping effect on the electronic structure and carrier dynamics. Fig. 4 shows the TA spectra and related dynamic traces of N-CDs and N, P-CDs with the pump at 380 nm. The TA spectra consist of broadband excited-state absorption (ESA) for both CDs and two negative signals for N-CDs but one for N, P-CDs (Fig. 4c and d). As we know, the ESA signal reflects the absorption transitions of generated carriers or excitons from the excited states to higher excited states, indicating the photogenerated electrons are well populated in the excited states. The origination of the ESA signal could be from different excited states and is complicated to analyze. The observed negative signal in the TA spectrum can be assigned to stimulated emission (SE) or ground-state bleaching (GSB). Considering the low quantum yields (<12%) for the as-prepared CDs, and the spectral shapes and wavelength positions of the absorption and emission for N, P-CDs, we can attribute the negative TA signals around 600 nm for N-CDs in Fig. 4c and around 625 nm for N, P-CDs in Fig. 4d to the GSB. Another GSB signal around 410 nm for N-CDs demonstrates instant appearance and subsequent decay, reflecting efficient electron transition from the ground state to the excited state and the return of photogenerated carriers to the ground state. Interestingly, there is a clear GSB signal around 600 nm for N-CDs, clearly indicating the existence of tail states, which is consistent with the very weak absorption shown in Fig. 3a. However, the GSB transient trace around 600 nm of N-CDs shows a very different feature from the GSB around 410 nm, consisting of an early-time increase and then a decay process. The rising component in the GSB signal around 600 nm suggests the carriers of this excited state arise from the electron migration of other excited states rather than direct excitation by the pump beam. It should be noted that the crossover position of the ESA and GSB signals around 550 nm of N-CDs shows a blue shifting with the delay time (Fig. 4c). This feature demonstrates a correlation between the crossover of the positive/negative TA signal and the absorbance of tail states in Fig. 3a, suggesting a possible bandgap renormalization process in the excited states of N-CDs under pulsed excitation.54–56 In contrast, the TA spectrum of N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4) demonstrates different characteristics from those of N-CDs. There is a broadband ESA from 410 to 550 nm without the GSB signal in this spectral region, further supporting the regulation effect of P-dopants on the electronic structure. Notably, the remarkably large negative GSB signal around 625 nm suggests these excited states can be efficiently populated with direct excitation or electron migration from other excited states, consistent with steady-state absorption in this spectral region (Fig. 3a) and the independent emission spectrum of the excitation wavelength (Fig. 3c). Similarly, a relatively small red-shifting crossover can be also observed in the TA spectra of N, P-CDs (Fig. 4d), implying a weakened bandgap renormalization due to efficient carrier transfer to the lower excited states. Compared with that for N-CDs, the rising component of GSB around 625 nm demonstrates an ultrafast process for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4). Fig. 4e and f shows the dynamic evolution of the GSB signal around 600 nm for N, P-CDs with changing content of P-dopants, under pump excitation at 380 nm. The transient traces were fitted by the following multi-exponential function: (1)where I(t) is the TA signal with time at a selected wavelength, τi represents the time constants of a growth or decay component and Ai represents the corresponding relative amplitude of the selected component.

The fitting parameters of the GSB signals for N-CDs and N, P-CDs are summarized in Table 1. We can see that the GSB establishment is getting faster with increasing concentration of H3PO4, and the corresponding time constant τg is changed from 0.8 ps for N-CDs to 0.3 ps (15% H3PO4) and 0.2 ps (50% H3PO4) for N, P-CDs. These results indicate that the migration rate of photogenerated electrons from other excited states to the lowest excited state increases with the doping of P atoms, consistent with the emission independence of excitation wavelength. In the recovery process of these GSB signals, bi-exponential fitting gives a fast component τ1 and a relatively slow component τ2 for N-CDs and N, P-CDs. The fast process with a picosecond constant becomes more obvious with the increased rate and magnitude ratio, especially, demonstrating a pump power-dependent feature (Fig. S6†). We suggest this ultrafast process originates from carrier–carrier scattering or multiple exciton interaction, due to either one being closely associated with the electron density of the excited state. On the other hand, the time constant of the slow process is increased with doping P atoms, from 810 ps for N-CDs to 1090 ps for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4), consistent with the observations in the fluorescence lifetime. Based on these observed dynamics from time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption, we can conclude that the effective doping of P atoms into N-CDs also regulates the carrier dynamics, including the electron migration from other excited states to the lowest excited state, and reduces the exciton recombination, in addition to the changed electronic structure and extended absorption spectral region, which are conducive to promoting the optical properties and photoelectric conversion of CD-based devices.

For practical application as photoelectric devices, we first fabricated the films of as-prepared CDs loaded on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and investigated the optical properties compared with those in the solution of N, P-CDs. Both N-CD and N, P-CD films present similar optical properties to those in aqueous solution, but with some degree of spectral shift and band changes in relative amplitude. Specifically, the dominant absorption band is red shifted from 410 nm in solution to 425 nm in film, and the maximal emission is blue shifted to 530 nm in film from 560 nm in solution (Fig. 5). Meanwhile, the absorption in the spectral region from 500 to 700 nm demonstrates an obvious increase with reducing solvent effect, which can be attributed to the dense matrix. Likewise, the N, P-CD (50% H3PO4) film shows a broad spectral absorption from 300 to 700 nm with the blue-shifted bands around 360, 413 and 556 nm. However, the absorption band at 610 in solution is red shifted to 624 nm in the N, P-CD film. Correspondingly, red shifted and broadened emission bands around 670 and 705 nm can be observed, with a relatively increased emission at 705 nm for the N, P-CD film, compared with a weak emission shoulder in solution. Intriguingly, we found that the PL decay curves at 670 and 705 nm are identical, with a lifetime of 1.7 ns, suggesting that these two radiative transitions may occur from the same excited state to different vibrational levels of the ground state of N, P-CDs (Fig. 5d). On the one hand, these observations indicate solvent-induced modification on the surface states of as-prepared CDs. On the other hand, they also support that P-doping changes the electronic structure in both the excited state and the ground state of N, P-CDs. Owing to the broadened spectral response, the effective carrier migration from other excited states to the lowest excited state and the decreased carrier recombination show N, P-CDs to be a great candidate for photoelectric conversion devices.

To evaluate the photoelectric properties of N, P-CDs, we performed photocurrent measurements in a three-electrode cell system with aqueous 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution. The schematic diagram of the preparation of CD film on ITO to evaluate the photoelectric conversion is illustrated in Fig. 6a. As the working electrode, the CD film is covalently connected to the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface through a condensation reaction (Scheme S1†). (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) is employed as the functional molecule for preparing the silica-based targeting surface to attach both ITO and CDs through the acidic groups. AFM images of the ITO surface and the CD-coated-ITO film are shown in Fig. 6b and Fig. S7.† The roughness values of the N, P-CD-ITO and ITO films are 11.4 and 10.3 nm, suggesting the formation of N, P-CD films. In the photoelectric conversion measurements, the illumination intensity was 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 6c shows the photoelectric response of N, P-CD-ITO photoelectrode in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in the dark and under simulated solar light irradiation in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The plot of photocurrent density versus applied voltage exhibits an obvious photoelectric conversion of N, P-CDs, in which the current continuously increases with the changing bias potential from −0.4 to 0.65 V, suggesting significantly improved conductivity of the N, P-CD (50% H3PO4) film. The P-doping effect to enhance the photoelectric conversion is further presented in the LSV curves of N, P-CDs with an increasing concentration of phosphoric acid from 0 to 50% (Fig. 6d). For the pristine N-CD film, the photocurrent density is slowly increased with the applied bias and reaches a saturated current of 0.4 μA cm−2 at the potential of 0.1 V. In contrast, the N, P-CD film demonstrates a fast increase with increasing P-dopants, and the corresponding bias potential for saturated photocurrent is increased to 0.5 V for N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4). Fig. 6e shows the photocurrent density of different CD films with a given bias of 0.2 V. Compared with the small photocurrent density of 0.4 μA cm−2 for N-CDs, the photocurrent amplitude of N, P-CDs (50% H3PO4) is significantly increased to 4.8 μA cm−2 with a 12 times enhancement under the same conditions (Fig. 6e). The positive shifted saturation potential and enhanced photocurrent suggest a high carrier density in N, P-CDs and confirm the validity of P-doping to improve the photoelectric properties of N-CDs. These observations exhibit a good consistency with the broadband light harvesting and the decreased recombination of carriers in N, P-CDs. The broadened absorption spectral range of N, P-CDs compared with that of N-CDs significantly enhances the light-harvesting ability of solar energy. The decreased recombination rate of photogenerated carriers further improves the probability of charge separation and photoconductivity for N, P-CDs. Under identical solar illumination, we can infer that more photons will be absorbed to produce more photogenerated carriers to be efficiently transported out to enhance the photoelectric conversion. Moreover, we performed reciprocating measurements on the photocurrent of N, P-CD (50% H3PO4) film in 250 seconds. As shown in Fig. 6f, the N, P-CD film demonstrates a quite stable photocurrent output with only a 2% decrease in the original amplitude, presenting good photoelectric stability and fatigue resistance. Therefore, we can conclude that the effective doping of P atoms into N-CDs significantly regulates the electronic structure, light-harvesting ability and carrier dynamics, leading to an effective improvement in the photoelectric conversion ability of N, P-CDs devices.

Conclusions
In summary, we have effectively doped P atoms into N-CDs and synthesized n-type N, P-CDs, as well as systematically investigating the regulation effect of P-doping on the electronic structure, carrier dynamics and optical and photoelectrical properties. Specifically, the absorption spectrum of N, P-CDs is greatly broadened and extended compared with that of N-CDs. The P-doping into N-CDs not only introduces new states, but also modifies the distribution of defects and surface traps. With the effective doping of P atoms, the very weak absorption of tail states of N-CDs is dramatically enhanced, leading to significant absorption in the red spectral region and thus enhancing the light-harvesting ability of N, P-CDs. The P-dopant also regulates the carrier dynamics of CDs, confirmed by time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption studies. The increased fluorescence lifetime of N, P-CDs suggests the decreased recombination rate of carriers, which is conducive to charge separation and photoelectric conversion. The observed ultrafast process in the TA study clearly indicates that the photogenerated electrons of other excited states can be efficiently transferred to the lowest excited state. Accordingly, the photoelectric properties of N, P-CDs have been greatly improved with twelve-fold enhancement in photocurrent density, compared with those of N-CDs. Therefore, the effective doping of P atoms can effectively regulate the electronic structure, optical properties, carrier dynamics and photoelectric conversion of N, P-CDs. The broadband light-harvesting, good photoelectric conversion capability and photostability make the as-prepared N, P-CDs a promising candidate for CD-based devices for optical and photoelectrical applications. Our findings are significant for understanding the doping effects on regulating the electronic structure and properties of CDs, and demonstrate an important example of element doping to improve the optical and photoelectrical properties of CD-based devices.
Experimental section
Synthesis of doped carbon dots
0.5 g OPD was dissolved in a 20 mL of phosphoric acid/water mixture in different compositions (0:100, 5:95, 15:85, 50:50 and 100:0) under ultrasound conditions. Then the solution was heated at 200 °C for 12 h to form N, P-CDs with different amounts of phosphorus in a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)(Teflon)-lined autoclave. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the solution containing N, P-CDs was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to remove impurities of high molecular weight. The residual solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter membrane and dialyzed in a dialysis membrane (1000 Da) for 12 h. Finally, the N, P-CDs were obtained through a freeze-drying process at −60 °C and 15 Pa for 24 h.
Characterizations
For the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, a drop of freshly prepared CD solution was placed on a newly carbon-coated copper grid and the sample was air-dried overnight before imaging. The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images were recorded on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope. In the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, CD solution (10 μL) was deposited onto the freshly cleaved mica. After incubating for 2 min, the mica substrate was washed with ultra-pure water and dried with compressed N2 gas. The morphologies of adsorbed CDs, the ITO surface and the CD-ITO film were characterized with a commercial AFM (Slover P47H, NT-MDT, Russia) in tapping mode.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of CDs were characterized using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ThermoFisher Nexsa), with Al/Kα radiation produced by a monochromatized X-ray source at an operating power of 300 W. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer spectrometer (Spectrum One B). The CD powders were prepared by freezing and pumping for 24 h, and then the CDs were pressed into a tablet with KBr. The Raman spectrum was measured on a Renishaw Raman spectrometer using an Ar ion laser as an excitation source at 532 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of CD powders were performed and analyzed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm).
Optical property measurements
The UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent). Fluorescence spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer LS-55 spectrophotometer. The fluorescence quantum yield of all doped carbon dots in the aqueous solution was determined using RhB dye as a reference.57
The fluorescence lifetimes of Au NCs were measured on a home-built setup (Harp300, Picoquant) using the time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique with excitation at 470 nm. A broadband femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent Inc.) was used as the excitation source. The laser pulse width was less than 120 fs, and the repetition rate was changed using a pulse picker as needed. The 380 nm excitation pulses were generated from the second harmonic generation of a BBO nonlinear crystal. The fluorescence signals passed through a monochromator and were detected using a single-photon detector (MPD, Picoquant), then delivered into the TCSPC system for analysis. The instrumental response function was determined to be less than 50 ps.
TA spectroscopy
Femtosecond TA spectral measurements were performed using a Ti:sapphire laser system (Astrella Vitara-S, Coherent Inc.) and a Helios Fire femtosecond transient absorption spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems). Briefly, the 800 nm output pulse from the regenerative amplifier was split into two parts with a 70/30 beam splitter. The reflected part was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Coherent Inc.) to produce wavelength-tunable pulses from 240 to 2600 nm. A small portion was focused onto a CaF2 plate to generate a white-light continuum from 320 to 750 nm, used as the probe beam. The samples were placed in a cuvette of 2.0 mm thickness with magnetic stirring to avoid the photochemical effects induced by pump pulses. The instrument response function of the TA system was determined to be around 140 fs. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
Photoelectric conversion measurements
An ITO-coated glass of 1 × 1 cm was cleaned using ultrasonication for 30 min in acetone, ethanol and ultrapure water, respectively, and then dried with nitrogen gas. CDs (5 mg) were dispersed in 1 mL of 1% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane ethanol solution. Then 100 μL of the solution was loaded onto ITO and dried at 45 °C overnight. Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a CHI 660 electrochemical analyzer equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp. LSV was carried out in 0.5 M Na2SO4 in a custom-made electrochemical cell consisting of a Pt plate as the counter-electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference, respectively.
