The copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and their molecular weights were estimated using gel permeation chromatography. Field effect transistors (FETs) fabricated from these four polymers exhibit semiconducting behavior in air.

Low band-gap donor–acceptor copolymers with a deep-lying HOMO energy level were synthesized by a copolymerization between the ladder-type heteroheptacene donor and the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole acceptor. Polymer solar cells made from one of these polymers gave a power conversion efficiency of 4.17%, a current density of 9.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V, and a fill factor of ∼57.4% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G sunlight illumination.
Introduction
In recent years, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have become a promising solution to our need for renewable energy sources due to their salient features such as low-cost, light weight, and good flexibility. With the advance in novel tailor-made polymers as well as the development in new fabrication techniques for BHJ solar cells, the highest published and confirmed power conversion efficiency (PCE) efficiency to date is 8.6%.1–9
In BHJ solar cells, the photoactive layer plays a key role in determining the PCE. Generally, the photoactive layer comprises an electron transporting material and a hole transporting material. For the electron transporting material, fullerenes and their derivatives (such as PC71BM and PC61BM) are the materials of choice, though some other n-type polymers or small molecules can also be used for BHJ solar cells with relatively low efficiencies (<3%).10 Subsequently, optimization of p-type materials becomes a good solution to tune the optoelectronic properties of the photoactive layer. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been frequently blended with PC61BM to form BHJ solar cells with PCEs in the range of 2–5%.6,11 The relatively large band-gap of P3HT limits the short circuit current (Jsc) of the resulting photovoltaic cells. And the high lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT limits the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the fabricated cells. Zheng et al. developed ladder-type oligo-p-phenylene containing copolymers as p-type materials for BHJ solar cells with a Voc as high as 1.06 V.12 In the structure of ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene, there are three “linearly overlapping” fluorenes, which form a planar and extended π-conjugation for a broader and more intense absorption band (as shown in Scheme 1). In our previous work, we reported the synthesis of a carbazole-cored heteroheptacene formed by introducing sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms into the heteroacene fused-ring system.13 We found that the polymers based on the carbazole-cored heteroheptacene showed a red-shifted light absorption band, and moderate hole mobilities of 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.13 However, replacement of a carbon atom in the heteroacene fused-ring system solely by a sulfur atom may lead to materials with better π-stacking and crystallinity, which is beneficial for an improved fill factor (FF) of the BHJ solar cells (Scheme 1).

In this context, we designed and synthesized a novel ladder-type heteroheptacene as the building block for p-type semiconducting copolymers. Four structurally related copolymers with the alternating ladder-type heteroheptacene repeat unit and benzothiadiazole (thiophene, bithiophene, or terthiophene) repeat unit were synthesized (Scheme 2). We fabricated field effect transistors based on these copolymers to investigate the hole transporting properties of these polymers. Finally, BHJ solar cells based on the polymers were fabricated and structure/photovoltaic properties of these polymers were analyzed.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to compound 5 is shown in Scheme 3. Due to the electron-donating effects of the sulfur atom in 3,7-dibromodibenzo[b,d]thiophene,14 a double Friedel–Crafts acylation with heptanoyl chloride and AlCl3 in carbon disulfide proceeded smoothly to obtain compound 2 with a yield of 85%. Compound 3 was obtained in 92% yield by the Stille coupling reaction between 2 and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene with DMF as the solvent in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 at 90 °C overnight. Then compound 3 was transformed into the dialcohol derivative by the n-hexyllithium treatment followed by the ring-closure reaction with boron trifluoride etherate via intramolecular Friedel–Crafts alkylation to afford the heteroheptacene (4) with a yield of 13%. Optimization of this reaction yield is possible by introducing different side chains to reduce steric hindrance. Compound 4 was brominated under dark conditions with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in CHCl3/CH3COOH to afford compound 5 with a yield of 90%.
 Scheme 3  Synthetic route to the ladder-type dibromoheteroheptacene. 
The synthetic route to the semiconducting copolymers (P1, P2, P3 and P4) based on the ladder-type heteroheptacene is depicted in Scheme 4. The ladder-type dibromoheteroheptacene (5) was copolymerized with 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene (6), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (7), 5,5′′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (8) by a Stille coupling reaction with toluene as the solvent in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 at 95 °C for 2 days to afford P1 (Mn = 6.2 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.27), P2 (Mn = 106.7 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.66), P3 (Mn = 28.7 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.25), in that order. The copolymer P4 (Mn = 6.0 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.07) was obtained by a Suzuki coupling reaction between compound 5 and 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (9) with toluene as solvent in presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and 1 M aqueous solution of K2CO3 at 90 °C for two days. The structures of the polymers were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. P2 and P3 were obtained in relatively large molecular weight compared to P1 and P4, which may be due to the less sterically hindered repeat units used for the polymerization reaction. All of the polymers demonstrate excellent solubility in various organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, due to the four solubilizing hexyl chains on the ladder-type heteroheptacene repeat unit.

Optical absorption
The molecular weight, the optical, electrochemical, and electrical properties of polymers P1–P4 are summarized in Table 1. The optical absorption spectra of all polymers were acquired in chloroform solution and in thin film as shown in Fig. 1. P1, P2 and P3 exhibit similar optical band gaps of ∼2.1 eV estimated from their linear absorption edges (Fig. 1b). However, from P1 to P2 to P3, there is a slight bathochromically shift due to the extended π-conjugated system with the increasing number of the thiophene unit. P4 has two absorption peaks, which are located at around 410 nm and 585 nm. The peak at 410 nm originates from the π–π* transition between heteroheptacene and benzothiadiazole, whereas the long wavelength peak is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer from the electron-rich segment to the electron-deficient segment. Obviously, the strong electron withdrawing benzothiadiazole leads to a broader and bathochromically shifted absorption band, as shown in Fig. 1.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of P1–P4 are shown in Fig. 2. The electrochemical properties of these copolymers based on the ladder-type heteroheptacene were studied by cyclic voltammetry in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate solution (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile). Under these conditions, the onset oxidation potential (E1/2 ox) of ferrocene was −0.02 V versus Ag/Ag+. The HOMO energy level of these copolymers was estimated from the oxidation onset of the first scan from the CV data. The oxidation onset of P2 is around 0.40 V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium. Thus the HOMO energy of P2 is calculated to be −5.22 eV, assuming that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV to vacuum.15 Further, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of P2 is estimated to be −3.13 eV, according to the optical band gap (Eg) of 2.09 eV obtained from the absorption spectrum of the thin film. The identical algorithm is used for the calculation of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the remaining polymers and the results are listed in Table 1. One may find that P4 has a deep-lying HOMO energy level compared to P1, P2 and P3. It can be understood because only P4 is a donor–acceptor copolymers. It should be noted that the ladder-type heteroheptacene and oligothiophenes are electron-donating groups, whereas 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole is an electron-withdrawing group. These results are in agreement with previous observations that donor–acceptor copolymer configuration will lead to low band-gap copolymers with a deep-lying energy level.2

Field-effect transistors
To know the hole transporting properties of these semiconducting polymers, top-contact bottom-gate field-effect transistors (FETs) based on them were fabricated on heavily doped Si (100) substrates treated with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) under ambient conditions. Fig. 3 shows the typical output (a) and transfer characteristics of FETs based on P3, where Id, Vd, and Vg represent the source-drain current, source-drain voltage, and gate voltage, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the output curves displayed good saturation behavior and the hole mobility of P3 was calculated to be 2.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 from the saturation region of the transfer curve. Fig. 3 shows clear on/off behavior of P3 with a current on/off ratio of 320. The threshold voltage of the P3-based FET is −7 V, which was derived from the onset of the transfer curve (Fig. 3). Similarly, the mobilities for P1, P2, and P4 were found to be 5.85 × 10−6, 1.44 × 10−4, 1.25 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, in that order, as listed in Table 1. The on/off ratios of all the devices are not large (Table 1), but it is high enough to minimize leakage currents. The structural difference in P1, P2 and P3 is the number of the repetitive monomer thiophene. However, the FET devices fabricated from P2 and P3 showed mobilities almost 10–20 times those fabricated from P1, which could be attributed to the better π-stacking and crystallinity found for P2 and P3. At the same time, the relatively low molecular weight of P1 may lead to bad morphology of the spin-coated film, and thus result in the low hole mobilities. Therefore, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface measurements of these films, and the topographic images are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The AFM images of the four polymers show uniform and flat films with roughnesses in the range 0.3–4.0 nm. As shown in Fig. S1, the P1 film has a relatively large roughness of 4.0 nm, compared to P2 (0.6 nm) and P3 (2.6 nm) films. We did not observe crystalline domains for these polymer films, indicating that all four polymers are amorphous. At the same time, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra for the spin-coated films reconfirmed the amorphous nature of these polymers (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Polymer solar cells
Photovoltaic properties of the copolymers were investigated in solar cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM (or PC61BM)/LiF/Al. The copolymer:PC71BM (or PC61BM) blend films were prepared in a weight ratio of 1:3 (or 1:2.5) using a mixed solvent (chlorobenzene:o-dichlorobenzene = 3:1). The results of these studies are outlined in Table 2 and the J–V characteristics of the best devices under simulated solar light (AM 1.5 G, RT, ambient) are shown in Fig. 4. Our studies reveal that there are several factors determining the performance of the fabricated devices which include the blend ratios of polymers to fullerenes, solvents, the additives, and the fullerenes used. Since all these four polymers are basically amorphous, none of our devices were subjected to thermal annealing. A comparison of the performance of the best devices from the four polymers indicates that P2 and P3 achieved good power conversion efficiencies of 4.17% and 2.36%, respectively. However, P1 and P4 achieved relatively low power conversion efficiencies of 0.23% and 0.76%, respectively. It is probably due to the low molecular weights of P1 and P4, which prevent the formation of good film blends. Therefore, we are not going to discuss the performance of solar cells based on P1 and P4 in detail. The solar cell performance of P2 was first investigated by blending it with PC61BM at different weight ratios (1:2.5 and 1:3.0). As listed in Table 2, the devices with a weight ratio of 1:3 showed higher short circuit currents which resulted in a higher average PCE of 1.60%. Later, when 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 1% by volume) was added as a processing additive to the P2:PC61BM polymer blend (1:3 by weight), the devices give a higher short circuit current of 6.24 mA cm−2 and a higher average efficiency of 2.76%. The improved nanoscale morphology of the polymer blends is responsible for the increased efficiency by adding the DIO additive.18 For P2 and P3, we compared the performance of PSCs fabricated by PC61BM with those by PC71BM, and found an increased efficiency for the PC71BM-based device, which can be attributed to the increasing optical absorption of the polymer blends.12 For example, the device based on P2:PC71BM gives the best PCE of 4.17% in comparison with the device based on P2:PC61BM which has a PCE of 2.82%. The same phenomenon was observed for P3-based devices, where the P3:PC71BM-based device gives an average PCE of 1.88% in comparison with 0.83% for the P3:PC61BM-based device under the same processing condition.

 Fig. 4  Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs based on P1 (P2, P3, or P4):PC61BM (or PC71BM) polymer blends under simulated solar light (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). 
We noticed that P4 has a deeper lying HOMO energy level compared to P2 or P3. As it has been known, Voc is correlated with the energy level difference between the HOMO of the donor polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor (e.g., PC61BM). However, P4-based devices did not exhibit a higher Voc as expected (Table 2). This could be in part due to the bad film quality of the active layer made from a blend of the low molecular weight copolymers and PC61BM, and in part due to the fact that the energy difference between the LUMO energy levels of the copolymer and PC61BM is not large enough to facilitate efficient exciton splitting and charge dissociation.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) as a function of wavelength of the photovoltaic cells based on P2:PC71BM is shown in Fig. 5. As shown in the figure, the P2:PC71BM blend has an EQE peak value of 0.55 at 480 nm, and the shape of EQE spectrum is basically similar to the optical absorption spectrum of the blended film of P2 and PC71BM (solid line in Fig. 5), which indicates that the photovoltaic conversion arises from the absorption of the blended active layer.

Atomic force microscopy
It is known that high performance BHJ solar cells should have a film morphology of nanoscale phase separation to get a large interface area for exciton dissociation and a continuous percolating path for hole and electron transport to the corresponding electrodes.12 In this work, we used AFM to characterize the morphology of the polymer:PCBM blends. Fig. 6 shows the AFM topography and phase images of different blended films. As shown in Fig. 6b and c, both P2/PC71BM (1:3, Fig. 6b) and P3/PC71BM (1:3, Fig. 6c) blended films have a smooth surface and obvious phase separation features, which indicate a good nanoscale morphology formation of the active layer in the solar cell device. Consequently, relatively high PCEs are obtained for P2/PC71BM (1:3) and P3/PC71BM (1:3). However, the phase separation features for P1/PC61BM (1:3; Fig. 6a) and P4/PC71BM (1:3; Fig. 6d) are not so obvious, which may be responsible for their low PCEs. At the same time, their relatively rough surfaces induced by the smaller molecular weights may also contribute to their low PCEs. For example, the P4/PC71BM (1:3) blended film has a surface roughness of 18.0 nm. Whereas P2/PC71BM (1:3) and P3/PC71BM (1:3) blends have surface roughnesses of 5.6 nm and 4.0 nm, respectively. It should be noted that the rough surface will lead to high surface resistance which is destructive to the performance of solar cells.

Conclusions
In conclusion, four semiconducting copolymers based on a novel ladder-type heteroheptacene have been successfully synthesized and characterized. The HOMO energy levels of the four polymers are in the range of −(5.22–5.47) eV. The introduction of electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole leads to a red-shifted linear absorption band as well as a deeper HOMO energy level. The copolymers based on the ladder-type heteroheptacene and terthiophene exhibit the highest mobility of 2.21 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The BHJ solar cells were fabricated from the copolymers blended with PC61BM or PC71BM. Under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, the polymer solar cells based on P2:PC71BM (1:3, w/w) exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 4.17% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V. The fill factors of P2-based devices were much higher than those of P1-, P3- and P4-based devices, indicating that the molecular structure of the polymers plays a vital role in determining the performance of the PSCs. Under optimized conditions, a relatively high fill factor of 0.594 was found for P2-based devices, which is much larger than the best fill factor of 0.44 of the PSC devices based on the ladder-type tetra-p-phenylene containing polymers.12 This result demonstrates that there is a beneficial effect when the carbon atoms in the heteroacene fused-ring system are solely replaced by sulfur atoms. Optimization of the device structures and post-treatments (e.g. thermal annealing, solvent annealing) are expected to further increase the PCE of these PSCs. Though polymer P4 has red-shifted linear absorption and a deep-lying HOMO energy level, no beneficial performance either in short circuit current or in open circuit voltage was observed, which is probably due to the bad film quality of P4 related to its low molecular weight and the relatively deep-lying LUMO energy level that prevents efficient exciton splitting and charge dissociation. Further studies are currently ongoing to prepare P4 with comparable high molecular weight to P2, and to prepare new polymers based on the copolymerization between ladder-type heteroheptacene and other electron-withdrawing repeat units. Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate that the ladder-type heteroheptacenes are promising building blocks for applications in BHJ solar cells.

Synthesis of compound 2. 
Heptanoyl chloride (6.52 g, 43.9 mmol) was added dropwise to a mixture of 3,7-dibromodibenzo[b,d]thiophene (3.00 g, 8.8 mmol) and AlCl3 (7.60 g, 56.9 mmol) in 80 mL anhydrous carbon disulfide at 0 °C under nitrogen with stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred and refluxed overnight at 45 °C and then quenched with ice.

Fabrication and measurement of field-effect transistors
FETs of the four ladder-type heteroheptacene-based copolymers were fabricated on HMDS-treated SiO2/Si substrates. The films of semiconductor were deposited by spin-coating the pure polymers (∼7 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) at 1500 rpm for 60 s on the substrates in air. The thicknesses of the spin-cast films were around 30 nm. Gold top-contact source and drain electrodes of ∼50 nm thickness were vapor-deposited through a shadow mask. The channel widths and lengths of the devices were 6.0 mm and 300 μm, respectively. Devices were measured in air using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer with the ICS lite software.
Fabrication and device characterization of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated in the traditional sandwich structure: ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PCBM blend/LiF/Al. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 30 min each and then dried in an oven at 130 °C overnight. Then the PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVPAI 4083) solution was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO glass substrate, which was pretreated by oxygen plasma for 5 min. Then the substrate was dried at 130 °C in air for 40 min. The active layer was prepared by spin-coating the polymer:PCBM blend solution at 800 rpm for 5 min in air. Then the devices were kept at room temperature for 12 hours. Later, 1 nm of LiF and 100 nm of aluminum were deposited through shadow masks by thermal evaporation. The active area of the devices was fixed at 6 mm2. Polymers and PC71BM or PC61BM were dissolved in chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene (v/v, 3/1) with a 1:3 or 1:2.5 (20 mg mL−1) weight ratio. And for some devices, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as a processing additive. Device characterization in ambient environment was performed under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) on an Oriel sol3A simulator (Newport) with NREL-certified silicon reference cell. After encapsulation in air, the solar cell devices were illuminated through their ITO sides. The current density–voltage curves were measured in air by a Keithley 2440 source measurement unit.
Atomic force microscopy
AFM was performed by a Veeco Multimode NS3A-02 Nanoscope III atomic force microscope. Blended films for AFM were prepared on PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates prepared in identical fashion to those prepared for the device fabrication. The semiconducting films for AFM were deposited in identical fashion to those prepared for the FET device fabrication.
