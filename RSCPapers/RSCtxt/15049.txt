    , Accepted 2nd September 2019First published on 3rd September 2019AbstractCost-effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with both superb activity and stability are crucial for practical electrocatalytic water splitting. We herein come up with a metal carbonate hydroxide and metal sulfide (MS/MCH) heterostructure via in situ generating MS on MCH to tackle the conflict between activity and durability. The heterostructure in a unique “nanoparticle-in-nanosheet” configuration features abundant hetero-interfaces between MS and MCH, allowing for effective electron transfer from the antibonding orbital of M–S in MS to M–O in MCH and thus improving the stability of sulfides during water oxidation. Simultaneously, such coupling is able to modulate the electronic structure of the metal centre, thus enhancing the intrinsic activity. The coupled heterostructure therefore exhibits steady OER performance with an ultrasmall overpotential of 226 to deliver a current of 10 mA cm−2 and can output an industrial-level current of 1000 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of only 367 mV. Furthermore, the overall water electrolyzer with such a heterostructure as an anode presents stable hydrogen production at 100 mA cm−2 with a small cell voltage of 1.62 V and a high solar to hydrogen efficiency of 16.99%. Such superior catalytic performance demonstrates the feasibility of introducing a heterostructure to tailor the local electrocatalytic properties and opens up an avenue toward designing efficient OER catalysts for clean hydrogen production and diverse energy conversion devices.
Introduction
Developing clean and sustainable energy sources is central to address the environmental issues and energy crisis.1,2 Electrocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen is one of the most promising technologies to fulfil the demands of future power devices.3,4 However, its overall reaction efficiency is still greatly hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps with a high-energy barrier and thus a high overpotential.5,6 Although noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 are recognized as the benchmarking OER electrocatalysts, their high cost and low natural abundance limit their potential application.7 Constructing cost-effective OER electrocatalysts with both superb activity and stability is thus highly desirable for the practical application of electrocatalytic water splitting.8,9
Transition metal carbonate hydroxides (MCHs) have recently been regarded as a new class of attractive candidates for OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes thanks to their cost effectiveness, structure tunability, and striking durability.10–12 The structural flexibility and chemical versatility of MCHs open up opportunities to alter their structure for enhanced electrocatalytic activities. However, their relatively low conductivity and activity have impeded their applications in practical devices.10 In contrast, metal sulfides (MSs) were reported with promising OER activity but suffered from very poor durability because the sulfur components are unstable during continuous oxidation operation.13,14 The dissolution process accompanied by inevitable structure collapse leads to a rapid decrease in durability.15 This troublesome conflict between activity and durability in different materials stays in the way of developing practical OER catalysts, calling for innovations in material structures.16
Recently attention has been paid to heterostructures to offer emerging feasibilities to conquer the above issues.17,18 By coupling two components with different compositions and crystallinities, the constructed hybrids can exhibit excellent structural features of both excellent activity and durability.19–21 Compared with oxygen, sulfur with higher polarizability and less electronegativity can afford more electrons to the 3d orbits of metal elements. Thus, coupling MS with MCH shows great promise in modifying the intrinsic catalytic properties.14,22 Simultaneously, when constructing a heterostructure, such coupling with higher electronegativity anions such as oxygen could also effectively deplete the sulfur anti-bonding orbitals, strengthening the chemical bonding with metal atoms and thus promoting the chemical stability of MS during OER measurements.23 Therefore, the smart design of advanced MS/MCH heterostructures with abundant hetero-interfaces may provide an effective method to achieve simultaneously robust stability and high activity, which is therefore of great importance for the application of water oxidation.
In this regard, we herein propose a metal carbonate hydroxide and metal sulfide (MS/MCH) heterostructure to meet the requirements of both activity and durability. The heterostructure with a unique “nanoparticle-in-nanosheet” configuration exposes abundant hetero-interfaces between MS and MCH, where the electrons can effectively transfer from the antibonding orbital of M–S bonds in MS to M–O bonds in MCH, similar to previous reports.24 Thus, the M–S bonds could be strengthened to alleviate the sulfur dissolution during water oxidation, which is an inherent shortcoming of sulfide-based materials for the OER. Moreover, such hetero-coupling can modulate the local electronic structure and thus enhance the intrinsic activity of metal centres. Together with the benefits from the porous architecture, abundant active sites, and good hydrophilicity, the heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER in view of outputting a current of 10 mA cm−2 and 1000 mA cm−2 at a cost of small overpotentials of 226 and 367 mV, respectively. When it was further used as an anode in an overall water electrolyzer, the device can stably produce hydrogen at 100 mA cm−2 with a small cell voltage of 1.62 V. Combined with solar light illumination, the solar-driven electrolyzer delivers a high solar to hydrogen efficiency of 16.99%. These results suggest that hetero-coupling of metal oxides with metal sulfides to form an integrated heterostructure may provide opportunities for fabricating electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for clean hydrogen production and diverse energy conversion devices.
Experimental section
Synthesis of CFCH
In a typical procedure, a mixture of 2 mmol cobalt acetate, 2 mmol iron acetate, and 500 mg hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) was dissolved in 5 mL ethylene glycol and 25 mL methanol under continuous stirring to obtain a clear solution. The mixed solution was then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a piece of cleaned nickel foam (NF) substrate (2 × 4 cm−2) immersed in the solution. The autoclave was locked tightly and maintained in an electric oven at 180 °C for 8 h, and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. The as-obtained sample was then washed with ethanol three times and dried naturally to achieve CoFe carbonate hydroxide (CFCH).
A series of metal carbonate hydroxides (MCHs) with varied metal types were prepared using the same method except for changing the type of metal salt while keeping the total amount as 4 mmol. The metal ratio in bimetal MCHs is set as 1:1 unless specifically indicated.
Synthesis of psCFCH and osCFCH
A piece of NF (2 × 4 cm−2) covered with CoFe carbonate hydroxide arrays was first placed in a 50 mL autoclave. Then, a certain amount of thioacetamide solution and ethanol was added to the autoclave. The autoclave was locked tightly and maintained in an electric oven at 120 °C for 4 h, and then naturally cooled down to room temperature to sulfurize the carbonate hydroxide. 5 mL 0.04 M thioacetamide solution and 25 mL ethanol were used for partial sulfurization to achieve the heterostructure with metal sulphide nanoparticles in the carbonate hydroxide. The sample was denoted as psCFCH. 15 mL 0.04 M thioacetamide solution and 15 mL ethanol were typically used for fully sulfurizing the carbonate hydroxide. The sample was denoted as osCFCH. The loading amount of psCFCH and osCFCH on NF was determined to be about 3.4 mg cm−2.
Material characterization
The crystalline structure of the sample was evaluated by using powder X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max 2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at a scan rate of 2° min−1. The powders for XRD examination are removed from the as-prepared samples by intense ultrasonic treatment. Morphology characterization was conducted on a Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-2100F) working at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) were collected using an EDS system (Oxford Materials Analysis) equipped on the TEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi with Mg Kα radiation.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrocatalytic measurements were performed on an Autolab PGSTAT302N (Metrohm, Netherlands) electrochemical workstation at room temperature (25 °C) using a conventional three-electrode configuration. The as-prepared electrodes, Hg/HgO electrode (1 M NaOH), and carbon rod were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. The double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of the catalysts were measured in the potential range without faradaic processes at various scan rates including 120, 100, 80, 60, and 40 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at a potential of 1.50 V (vs. RHE) in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 with 90% iR-compensation unless specifically indicated. Chronopotentiometry (CP) curves were recorded without iR-compensation. All potentials reported in this work were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which were converted according to the following equation:ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 × pHwhere EHg/HgO is the measured potential referenced to the Hg/HgO reference electrode.
Overall water splitting measurements were performed in a two-electrode system consisting of psCFCH as the anode and MoNi4/MoO2/NF as the cathode.
The solar-driven water splitting system was assembled with a commercial GaAs solar cell without an external bias. The solar cell was placed under a simulated AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination to provide the voltage to power the electrolyzer. The efficiency of solar to hydrogen conversion was calculated according to the following formula:  where j is the current density and P is the light power density.
Results and discussion
The CoFe carbon hydroxide (CFCH) is selected from a series of MCHs as a demonstration due to its superior OER performance (Fig. S1–S3†). A partial sulfurization reaction is then employed to in situ generate the MS/MCH heterostructure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is applied to investigate the phase transformation during the sulfurization process (Fig. 1a). The low intensity of the XRD signal for the CFCH precursor implies low crystallinity. After partial sulfurization (psCFCH), the rising diffraction peaks can be attributed to a typical spinel structure (similar to CoFe2O4, JCPDS: 02-1045). Combining XPS and EDS results below, it can be indexed to Co2FeS4. The diffraction peak intensity is evidently increased for the fully sulfurized counterpart, implying the formation of more sulfides.

The overview SEM images of CFCH (Fig. 1b and inset) exhibit an open porous structure consisting of small interconnected nanosheets. The morphology is well maintained after the partial sulfurization of psCFCH (Fig. 1c). The nanosheet inherits the porous structure from the original CFCH, but becomes thicker and rougher (inset in Fig. 1c). High-magnification TEM (HRTEM) is then employed to reveal the detailed local structural transition in each nanosheet. The original CFCH exhibits an amorphous nature in the HRTEM image (Fig. S4†), consistent with XRD results. After partial sulfurization (Fig. 1d), abundant particles of around 5–10 nm (highlighted by the yellow dashed line) are clearly observed on the surface of the nanosheet, which are surrounded by amorphous CFCH (highlighted by the green dashed line). The lattice fringes match well with the high-index facets of (311) and low-index planes of (400) and (222) (inset in Fig. 1d) of Co2FeS4, respectively. These results suggest the successful construction of the MS/MCH heterostructure, as illustrated in Fig. 1e. Such a “nanoparticle-in-nanosheet” configuration with abundant hetero-interfaces may benefit electrocatalytic processes. EDS mapping images in Fig. 1f–k clearly demonstrate that the Co, Fe, O, S, and C elements are uniformly distributed in the heterostructure. Tyndall light scattering under laser irradiation (Fig. S5†) indicates that psCFCH keeps the good hydrophilicity of the pristine CFCH, which is favourable for the mass and charge exchange during electrocatalysis.25 However, the porous structure collapses under over-sulfurization conditions with cracks appearing in the whole structure (Fig. 1l and inset). The HRTEM image verifies that the heterostructure disappears in osCFCH and the nanosheets are fully transformed into polycrystalline metal sulfide particles (Fig. 1m).
The surface composition and elemental chemical states of psCFCH are then monitored by the XPS technique. The Co 2p3/2 spectrum in Fig. 2a is fitted with double spin–orbit doublets and two satellites. The green main peak located at 780.9 eV with an obvious satellite peak (783.9 eV) indicates the presence of Co2+,26 originating from the CFCH (Fig. S6a†). The lower pink peak at 778.0 eV with a satellite peak at 787.3 eV can be ascribed to Co3+.27 The atomic ratio of Co2+:Co3+ in psCFCH is measured to be 1:0.86. After complete sulfurization, the ratio in osCFCH is 0.42:1 with a dominant Co3+ content (Fig. S7a†). In the Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. 2b), the peak located at 710.7 eV with a satellite peak at 713.4 eV suggests that Fe on the psCFCH surface exists in the pure +3 oxidation state,28 similar to CFCH and osCFCH (Fig. S6b and S7b†). The O 1s spectrum of psCFCH (Fig. 2c) can be fitted into three contributions. The dominating peak at 531.3 eV evidences the existence of the OH group,29 originating from the CFCH components in the heterostructure. Another peak appearing at 529.6 eV can be attributed to the lattice O,30,31 due to the unavoidable superficial oxidation of Co2FeS4 upon exposure to air.32 The last peak at 533.2 eV is associated with the adsorbed water at or near the surface.30 In the case of S 2p (Fig. 2d), the peak at 161.9 eV is attributed to S2−,33 while the one at 168.4 eV comes from the SOx group adsorbed on the catalyst surface. The signal at 165.0 eV could be attributed to the sulfur substance, which is usually the reaction product of thioacetamide.34,35 The S content is measured to be 14.6 at% for psCFCH and 25.4 at% for osCFCH (Fig. S7c†). The ratio of metal sulfide to hydroxide in psCFCH is roughly determined to be about 0.33 using the atomic ratio of S2− to OH− content from the XPS result. The co-presence of the OH group and S2− in psCFCH corroborates the formation of the MS/MCH heterostructure.

The OER performance of the three as-prepared catalysts and NF substrate is subsequently evaluated with 90% iR-compensation. All potentials are referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The NF substrate shows a negligible OER activity. In contrast, the CFCH precursor displays a moderate activity with overpotentials of 252 and 304 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3a and S8†). After creating the MS/MCH heterostructure, psCFCH exhibits much improved OER activity. The overpotentials at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 are significantly decreased to 226 mV and 271 mV, respectively. A large current density of 1000 mA cm−2 can also be achieved at a very low overpotential of 367 mV (Fig. S9†). However, the performance of the fully sulfurized osCFCH is sharply downgraded (293 and 357 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively), which is even worse than that of the original CFCH. The possible reason could be ascribed to the disappeared heterostructure and collapsed morphology. Moreover, psCFCH shows the smallest Tafel slope of 41.3 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3b) in comparison with that of CFCH (45.1 mV dec−1) and osCFCH (49.4 mV dec−1), indicating that the heterostructure appreciably enhances OER kinetics.36 Such a performance outperforms that of IrO2/NF (Fig. S10†) and is among those of the best state-of-the-art non-precious OER catalysts (Fig. 3c and Table S1†).11,37,38

(f) Chronopotentiometric curves at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2 of psCFCH and osCFCH. 
To gain further insights into the role of the heterostructure in promoting the OER activity, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of the samples are evaluated by measuring the electrochemical double layer capacitances (Cdl) (Fig. S11†).39 The large Cdl value of 20.3 mF cm−2 of CFCH (Fig. 3d) comes from the porous interconnected nanosheet structure. The slightly increased value of 21.5 mF cm−2 for psCFCH is benefiting from the well-remained overall morphology and rougher nanosheet surface induced by partial sulfurization. Therefore, psCFCH provides a favourable surface with superior hydrophilicity and abundant fully accessible active sites for the reaction. However, excessive sulfurization results in the collapse of the porous structure, leading to a rapid decrease in the ECSA (smaller Cdl value of 7.2 mF cm−2 for osCFCH).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is further employed to reveal the charge transfer kinetics during the OER process (Fig. 3e). The ohmic resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) are measured to be 2.1 Ω and about 3.3 Ω for CFCH, respectively. After sulfurization, the decreased Rs value of 1.4 Ω for both psCFCH and osCFCH is due to the enhanced local electrical conductivity by introducing highly conductive metal sulfides. However, these two materials exhibit distinct Rct. The Rct of 1.8 Ω for psCFCH is much smaller than that of CFCH (3.3 Ω), while osCFCH shows a much larger Rct of nearly 20 Ω. This could be attributed to the fact that the abundant exposed hetero-interfaces create strong coupling between the metal sulfide and MCH, thus inducing the delocalization of metal d-electrons and benefiting the charge transfer.14,19,40 Since psCFCH shows a similar ECSA to the pristine CFCH, the enhanced OER activity should be the result of the regulated electronic structure by the hetero-coupling and other favourable features such as the enhanced local mass/charge transfer, porous architecture, and abundant active sites.
The long-term durability of psCFCH is subsequently measured at a fixed current density of 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f). An almost unchanged overpotential is observed during 100 h continuous operation. It is widely accepted that the surface of metal chalcogenides undergoes an inevitable transformation to the corresponding metal oxides/(oxy)hydroxides at an oxidizing potential during long-time OER measurements.16 Thus, the composition of psCFCH after the durability test is then studied by TEM and XPS. The TEM image indicates that the nanosheets in psCFCH display a low crystallinity state after the durability test (Fig. S12†). However, small metal sulfide nanoparticles of around 5 nm can still be observed. XPS spectra indicate that some Co2+ is converted to Co3+ (Fig. S13a†), while the Fe content maintains the +3 state (Fig. S13b†), which is commonly reported for transition-metal OER catalysts.41 Notably, the S content in psCFCH is slightly reduced (11.6 at%) due to the decreased content of SOx groups during the measurements (Fig. S13c†). Such a “nanoparticle-in-nanosheet” configuration plays a vital role in enhancing the durability. The abundant exposed hetero-interfaces between MS and MCH enable effective electron transfer from the M–S antibonding orbital to M–O bonds, resulting in the strengthened binding energy of M–S bonds and thus enhanced durability.24 osCFCH without such a heterostructure displays poor durability. A moderate activity is observed in the first scan but it rapidly degrades (Fig. S14†). Along with a significantly decreased S content (3.9 at%) after the long-term cycling (Fig. S15†), these results suggest the importance of the elaborately designed heterostructure to the high activity and durability.
The excellent OER performance of psCFCH inspires us to assemble a real overall water electrolyzer to evaluate its potential utilization. Previously reported MoNi4 on MnO2 nanorods (denoted as MoNi4/MoO2/NF) is synthesized as the HER counter electrode,42 which requires a small overpotential of 79 mV to deliver 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. S16†). The assembled electrolyzer only needs small cell voltages of 1.51 V and 1.62 V to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a), respectively. Such a performance outperforms that of most of the recently reported state-of-the-art materials (Table S2†).22,43 The electrolyzer also exhibits steady performance under continuous operation even when the current density rises up to 550 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b), indicating its excellent durability even under harsh working conditions with high-rate gas evolution. The electrolyzer is further integrated with a commercial GaAs solar cell to demonstrate a solar-driven water splitting system. The J–V curves (Fig. 4c) present a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 16.99% with continuous oxygen and hydrogen production on the electrodes (Fig. 4c and Movie S1†). Such efficiency is among those of the best reported analogous systems (Table S3†).44,45 This system also exhibits a steady output in 900 s operation (Fig. 4d), demonstrating the potential of the our catalyst in a practical solar water splitting system.

Conclusions
In summary, to explore the practical application of carbonate hydroxides in electrochemical water oxidation, we herein develop a heterostructure of a metal carbonate hydroxide and metal sulfide (MS/MCH) to simultaneously improve OER activity and durability. Systematic experiments and analysis evidence that such an improvement could be ascribed to the unique “nanoparticle-in-nanosheet” configuration in the heterostructure, which offers abundant hetero-interfaces between MS and MCH. Through such interfaces electrons can effectively transfer from the M–S antibonding orbital to M–O bonds, thus stabilizing M–S bonds to alleviate the dissolution of the sulfur component during the OER. It is believed that such coupling can regulate the electronic structure of the metal centres to improve the intrinsic activity as well as the local mass/charge transfer. These features together with the electrode architecture of three-dimensional nanosheet arrays for abundant active sites, fast mass transfer and prompt gas evolution make psCFCH a superior OER electrocatalyst with both high activity and excellent durability. Such a performance is also demonstrated by assembling an overall water electrolyzer, which delivers a stable current of 100 mA cm−2 for hydrogen production at a small cell voltage of 1.62 V. In consideration of the structural flexibility and chemical versatility of MCHs, our strategy of hetero-coupling MS with MCH by direct partial sulfurization may open up an avenue for constructing high-performance electrocatalysts with both attractive activity and durability for practical applications.
