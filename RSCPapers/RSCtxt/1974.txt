    , Accepted 27th November 2021First published on 29th November 2021AbstractFe, N co-doped carbon electrocatalyst is one of the most attractive alternatives to Pt/C catalysts due to its high catalytic activity, excellent stability and low cost. However, obtaining stable and efficient Fe, N co-doped carbon oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts based on simple processes is still a challenge. Herein, Fe, N co-doped porous carbon (Fe–N–C) with an open macroporous frame structure is prepared by using inorganic molten salts (FeCl3·6H2O and ZnCl2) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as the template and nitrogen-containing carbon precursor, respectively. The open pore structure of the Fe–N–C material precisely tailored with the inorganic molten salt template exhibits high specific surface area (676.5 m2 g−1) and appropriate pore size, which can promote oxygen adsorption and expand the oxygen reduction interface, resulting in the acceleration of the electron/charge transfer processes and an improved electrocatalytic performance. The optimized Fe3–N–C-800 electrocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for ORR, such as high onset potential of 0.998 V and half wave potential of 0.84 V in alkaline media, as well as high stability and methanol tolerance. Furthermore, a novel Zn–air battery assembled with carbon paper containing Fe3–N–C-800 electrocatalyst as air cathode shows high open-circuit voltage (1.485 V), high specific capacity (870 mA h g−1 at 10 mA cm−2), excellent reversibility and stability. The proposed synthetic strategy provides new opportunities to design and construct carbon frame materials with the desired open macroporous structure to improve their electrocatalytic performance.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, the increasing environmental pollution problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels are seriously hampering the sustainable development of human society.1,2 Therefore, it is particularly important to find alternative green energy sources that can replace fossil energy sources. Compared to solar and wind energy that strongly depend on natural weather conditions, technologies related to electrochemistry have emerged as promising approaches to solve such problems.3 Among them, metal–air batteries represented by the zinc–air battery are considered ideal for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices due to their high theoretical specific energy, intrinsic safety, and environmental friendliness.4,5 The cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process plays a crucial role in the entire performance of a zinc–air battery, and platinum (Pt)-based nanocatalysts are considered to be the most desired ORR catalysts. Unfortunately, commercial Pt-based catalysts are faced with problems such as high cost, scarcity, unsatisfactory durability and poor methanol tolerance, which severely restrict the large-scale promotion of metal–air batteries. In addition, the lack of well-regulated metal-based catalysts also leads to a slow ORR kinetic reaction process, which greatly limits the energy conversion efficiency of metal–air batteries.6,7 Therefore, the design and development of non-precious metal ORR catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and durability has become a top priority for the development of metal–air batteries.8
In recent times, transition metal, nitrogen co-doped carbon (M–N–C, M = Fe, Co, etc.) electrocatalysts are one of the most attractive alternatives to Pt/C catalysts due to their high catalytic activity, excellent stability and low cost. Among the metals, Fe has a strong oxygen binding energy, and Fe and N have a synergistic effect, forming an important Fe–Nx catalytic active site for ORR. It is well known that nanostructured carbon materials can provide high electrical conductivity and abundant accessible active sites for multiphase ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).9,10 Carbon-based ORR catalysts prepared with metal–organic framework (MOF) as the carbon precursor can theoretically obtain a higher active site density and use the MOF-like structure to promote oxygen transmission due to their high specific surface area and controllable pore structure.11 However, the doping process will inevitably cause structural damage and the loss of their structural advantages. Studies have found that the nanostructures of the synthesized N-doped porous carbon depend to a large extent on the inorganic salt (such as LiCl, KCl, NaCl, and ZnCl2) activation and the nitrogen-containing carbon precursors in terms of morphology.12,13 In recent years, the design of high-efficiency heteroatom (N, S, P, B)-doped porous carbon based on the inorganic molten salt template-assisted activation strategy has attracted widespread attention;14,15 first, a mixture of inorganic salt and carbon precursors is heated and then washed with acid and water to remove the inorganic salt template. The only shortcoming of this strategy is that it is usually difficult to meet the requirements of co-doping of metals and heteroatoms into carbon materials. By contrast, transition metal (Fe) macrocycles with well-defined M–N4 geometries, such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines, have been widely explored as precursors for Fe, N co-doped carbon oxygen reduction catalysts.16–18 Despite all this progress, it is still a challenge to achieve low-cost and stable Fe and N co-doped highly conductive carbon nanomaterials with impressive ORR electrocatalysis performance by maximizing the exposure of accessible active sites and efficient mass transfer processes.
In this work, we designed a novel multifunctional inorganic salt mixture system to synthesize Fe, N co-doped porous carbon (Fe–N–C) catalysts by selecting inorganic molten salts (FeCl3·6H2O and ZnCl2) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the template and nitrogen-containing carbon precursor, respectively. During the heat treatment process, FeCl3·6H2O provides Fe doping and acts as a carbide catalyst and ZnCl2 acts as a pore-forming agent to form a hierarchical porous structure, while EDTA provides carbon and nitrogen precursors in the carbon matrix. The effect on the catalytic activity for ORR was investigated by varying the FeCl3·6H2O content and carbonization temperature within the inorganic molten salts. The results showed that the optimized Fe3–N–C-800 electrocatalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic performance as well as excellent methanol tolerance and stability for ORR in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the zinc–air cell assembled with Fe3–N–C-800 catalyst had high power density and excellent stability.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
FeCl3·6H2O, ZnCl2, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and methanol (CH3OH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Commercial 20 wt% Pt/C was from Johnson Matthey Company and Nafion solution was from DuPont, USA. All chemicals were commercially available and employed without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of Fe, N co-doped porous carbon catalysts
Typically, 1.0 g of EDTA was dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water and stirred at room temperature until a clarified solution was obtained. Then, a certain amount of FeCl3·6H2O (1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 g) and ZnCl2 (3.0 g) were added into the EDTA solution and the resulting mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature for 12 h until the solution was uniformly orange. After that, the solvent in the mixture was evaporated at 80 °C to give an orange-yellow solid, which was then transferred to a quartz tube furnace and heated up to 400 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere and then further heated up to 800 °C for 1 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. After natural cooling to room temperature, the powder was collected and washed with sulfuric acid (2 M) at 80 °C to remove excess metal particles and then washed with distilled water to neutral. Finally, the target products were dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The products prepared with 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 g of FeCl3·6H2O were named as Fe1–N–C-800, Fe3–N–C-800 and Fe5–N–C-800, respectively. The yield of the catalysts was about 40%.
In addition, the control catalyst, namely N–C-800, was prepared without adding FeCl3·6H2O by the same experimental process as above. Moreover, to explore the effect of temperature on the catalytic performance, the obtained nanofibers were carbonized at different temperatures of 700 °C and 900 °C by the same process as that of Fe3–N–C-800, and the as-prepared samples were named as Fe3–N–C-700 and Fe3–N–C-900, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure characterization
The Fe, N co-doped porous carbon catalyst (Fe3–N–C-800) is designed and prepared by using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and inorganic mixed molten salts (FeCl3·6H2O and ZnCl2) as the nitrogen-containing carbon precursor and template, respectively. The typical synthesis process of Fe3–N–C-800 is shown in Scheme 1. The inorganic salts (FeCl3·6H2O and ZnCl2) induce the formation of porous carbon frameworks from nitrogen-containing carbon precursors (EDTA) during the carbonization process, and the nanodroplets in the molten salts act as porogenic agents to modulate the pore structure of the carbon frameworks.19–21 ZnCl2 is a typical activator and pore-forming agent, which can be very easily volatilized at high carbonization temperatures, forming a graded micro/mesoporous structure, thus playing an important role in adjusting the pore structure.22–25 The carbon frameworks are then washed with hot dilute acid and deionized water to remove the inactive material and the salt template. Finally, the porous carbon with open macroporous frame structure is obtained.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the synthetic route of Fex–N–C. 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1a) shows that the Fex–N–C-800 samples exhibit the two typical diffraction peaks of C(002) and C(100) of graphitic carbon at 26.40° and 44°, respectively. Except for the typical diffraction peaks of carbon, the Fe3–N–C-800 catalyst does not show the obvious characteristic peaks of Fe, Fe3C and FeNx, indicating the homogeneous dispersion of the metal. The Raman spectra of the Fe3–N–C-800 catalyst show the typical D-band (1320 cm−1) and G-band (1596 cm−1) (Fig. 1b), where the ID/IG of Fe3–N–C-800 = 1.09, indicating that there are many defects, and so indicating the graphitic carbon in the catalyst and disordered carbon phase in the graphite sp2 plane, which is favorable for electrocatalytic performance.26–28 The specific surface area and porosity characteristics of the catalysts are analyzed using the N2 adsorption–desorption technique (Fig. 1c). According to the IUPAC classification, they show a type-IV isotherm with obvious hysteresis loops, suggesting the presence of abundant mesoporous structures.29 In addition, the adsorption isotherm of the sample is rapidly saturated at low relative pressure (relative pressures less than 0.4), suggesting the adsorption of micropores.29 The specific surface area and pore volume of Fe3–N–C-800 are 676.5 m2 g−1 and 0.816 cm3 g−1, respectively. The pore size distribution curves show that the pore size of Fe3–N–C-800 is mainly concentrated at 3.5 nm and 5.1 nm (Fig. 1d). It has been reported that the high specific surface area and appropriate pore size can promote oxygen adsorption and expand the oxygen reduction interface,30 making the catalyst to have a high density of active sites, which helps to accelerate the charge transfer and electron transfer processes, thus improving the electrocatalytic performance of ORR.31

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the typical Fe3–N–C-800 material exhibits a large number of open macroporous frame structures (Fig. 2a and b). It is found that the addition of different levels of iron precursors has a significant effect on the morphology of Fe, N-doped porous carbon (Fig. S1, ESI†). Specifically, the N–C-800 material prepared without the addition of Fe precursors shows a large and dense bulk structure, which is not an obvious porous structure (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†). By comparison, there are some shallow pores in the bulk structure of the Fe1–N–C-800 material (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). Similar to the Fe3–N–C-800 material, however, the Fe5–N–C-800 material has a large number of interconnected open porous frame structures (Fig. S1e and f, ESI†). These results indicate that the FeCl3·6H2O precursor has a significant effect on the formation of macroporous and interconnected frame structures in carbon materials. Moreover, the morphology of Fe, N-doped porous carbon also differs greatly at different carbonization temperatures (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Besides, the microstructure of the typical Fe3–N–C-800 material is observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We can observe that the open frame structure of the Fe3–N–C-800 material is made up of interwoven carbon nanosheets (Fig. 2c). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis in Fig. 2d demonstrates the disordered amorphous carbon structure of the Fe3–N–C-800 material. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images of Fe3–N–C-800 show that C, N, and Fe elements are uniformly distributed throughout the porous carbon skeleton (Fig. 2e). The uniform distribution of yellow dots (N) and blue dots (Fe) suggests that N and Fe are uniformly doped in the Fe3–N–C-800 skeleton.
To further confirm the chemical composition and elemental bonding configurations of Fe3–N–C-800, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed. Fig. 3a shows the XPS measurement spectrum of the Fe3–N–C-800 material, which confirms the presence of C, N, O, and Fe elements in the electrocatalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s confirm four types of nitrogen-bonding configurations (Fig. 3b). The peaks at 398.39 eV, 400.48 eV, 401.46 eV and 405.71 eV correspond to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxide N, respectively. The pyridinic N atoms are located at the edges of graphitic carbon layers or in vacancies (Fig. S3, ESI†). The pyridinic N is considered to be an active site that largely facilitates the four-electron process in the ORR process.32 Graphitic N can improve the stability and increase the rate of electron transfer, while other forms of N species can activate or adsorb oxygen to varying degrees. The high contents of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N facilitate the formation of Fe–Nx active sites. The Fe center is considered to be the active site in the Fe–Nx–C coordination structure, as the oxygenate is more readily adsorbed on the Fe site than on the N and C sites (Fig. S3, ESI†).33,34

In Fig. 3c, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum can be fitted to three independent peaks at 284.3 eV, 285.0 eV and 286.1 eV, which are related to graphitic sp2 carbon (sp2 CC), amorphous carbon (sp3 C–C) and C–O, respectively, indicating a typical graphitic carbon structure.35,36 In Fig. 3d, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum has three separate peaks for CO (531.0 eV), O–C–O (532.1 eV) and OH– (533.8 eV).37 The histograms show more clearly the content of the different nitrogen types (Fig. S4a, ESI†). It can be found that the contents of pyridinic N and graphitic N are relatively high, which has been proved to promote the catalytic activity. The individual elemental contents of Fe3–N–C-800 are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The Fe content in Fe3–N–C-800 tested by XPS analysis is 0.15 at%.
3.2 Electrochemical properties of Fex–N–C-T materials
The electrochemical ORR activity of the Fe, N-doped porous carbon electrocatalyst is investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in N2 and O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of all the electrocatalysts in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The CV curves for each catalyst in Fig. 4a are individually placed as in Fig. S5 (ESI†). One can see that no oxygen reduction peaks have appeared in the CV curves (dash line) of all the electrocatalysts in the N2 saturated electrolyte solution. However, the CV curves of all the electrocatalysts in the O2 saturated electrolyte have obvious oxygen reduction peaks (solid line), indicating that the electrocatalysts have significant oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity. To better understand the reaction kinetics of the catalysts, linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) tests are performed in an O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and the half-wave potentials of all the electrocatalysts are also calculated from the LSV curves (Fig. 4b). It can be visualized that the Fe3–N–C-800 electrocatalyst has the best activity, which has a more positive half-wave potential (E1/2, 0.84 V) than that of Fe1–N–C-800 (0.83 V), Fe5–N–C-800 (0.82 V), Fe3–N–C-700 (0.78 V), Fe3–N–C-900 (0.84 V) and N–C-800 (0.82 V) electrocatalysts (Fig. 4c). To further study the reaction mechanism, the LSVs of Fe3–N–C-800 (Fig. 4d) and 20% Pt/C electrocatalysts (Fig. S6, ESI†) at various rotation speeds from 400 to 2500 rpm are measured and the corresponding Kentucky–Levich (K–L) plots are calculated. According to the K–L curve analysis, the electron transfer number of Fe3–N–C-800 is calculated as 4 in the potential range of 0.3∼0.5 V. The K–L plots at different potentials exhibit excellent linearity, suggesting that the reaction process follows first-order kinetics. In addition, the LSV curves and K–L plots for Fe3–N–C-700 (Fig. S7a and b, ESI†), Fe3–N–C-900 (Fig. S7c and d, ESI†), N–C-800 (Fig. S8a and b, ESI†), Fe1–N–C-800 (Fig. S8c and d, ESI†), and Fe5–N–C-800 (Fig. S8e and f, ESI†) at different velocities are similarly recorded. Moreover, according to the experimental results, the high Fe content does not effectively improve the ORR performance, probably because the aggregation of a large number of Fe metal particles leads to the reduction of the electrochemically active region, which weakens the ORR catalytic activity of the catalysts.

The stability of the electrocatalyst is an important measure of the catalytic performance of the catalyst. In Fig. 4e, the half-wave potential of Fe3–N–C-800 is only negatively shifted by 20 mV after 10000 cycles. In contrast, in the case of the 20% Pt/C electrocatalyst, there is a negative impact on the half-wave potential and ORR onset, with a negative half-wave potential shift of about 38 mV (Fig. S9a, ESI†). In practical applications, the methanol tolerance of the catalyst is an important factor for measuring the catalytic performance of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†), the Pt/C catalyst shows an obvious sharp jump in current density after the addition of methanol due to the oxidation of methanol, while Fe3–N–C-800 maintains a stable current density (Fig. 4f), indicating that Fe3–N–C-800 has good tolerance to methanol. Therefore, the above results show that Fe3–N–C-800 as an ORR catalyst exhibits good cycling stability and excellent methanol tolerance in 0.1 M KOH solution.
3.3 Preparation of Zn–air batteries with Fe3–N–C and 20% Pt/C
For further practical application of Fe3–N–C-800 electrocatalyst, a novel Zn–air battery is assembled based on carbon paper containing the Fe3–N–C-800 electrocatalyst (1.0 mg cm−2) as the air cathode and zinc foil as the anode (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b shows that the open-circuit voltages of the Zn–air battery based on the Fe3–N–C-800 and Pt/C catalyst cathode are 1.49 V and 1.55 V, respectively. In addition, the peak power density of the Zn–air battery assembled with Fe3–N–C-800 reaches as high as 80 mW cm−2 at 1.35 V, which is similar to that of the Zn–air battery assembled with the Pt/C catalyst cathode (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 5c). Meanwhile, the Zn–air battery based on the Fe3–N–C-800 catalyst cathode shows a high specific capacity of 870 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 700 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d). Fig. 5e shows the galvanostatic discharge measurement of the Zn–air battery with the Fe3–N–C-800 cathode catalyst at various current densities from 2 to 25 mA cm−2. As can be seen, the whole galvanostatic discharge curve is symmetrical from low current density to high current density and then from high current density back to low current density, indicating that it has excellent reversibility and high ratio discharge property. Fig. 5f shows the stability test of the Zn–air battery with the Fe3–N–C-800 cathode catalyst. On replacing the zinc sheet every 20 hours, it is found that the discharge voltage remains almost constant after 80 h of continuous operation, indicating that the Zn–air battery with the Fe3–N–C-800 air cathode has excellent stability. Fig. 5g shows the practical application of the Zn–air battery. One Zn–air battery can light up an electronic screen, and it is possible to light up different LED colours by two series-connected batteries, which further verifies the practicability of the zinc–air battery device. The performance of the Zn–air battery with different emerging bifunctional electrocatalysts was compared, the results are shown in Table S2 (ESI†).38–45 More importantly, the present work demonstrates the rationality of the design, as well as, the excellent power density and cycling stability of the Zn–air battery assembled with Fe3–N–C-800 cathode, which implies that the electrocatalysts are useful in practical application.21,46

4. Conclusions
In summary, Fe, N co-doped porous carbon (Fe–N–C) with open macroporous frame structure is prepared by using inorganic molten salts (FeCl3·6H2O and ZnCl2) and EDTA as the template and nitrogen-containing carbon precursor, respectively. The open pore structure of the Fe–N–C materials precisely tailored with the inorganic molten salt template can promote oxygen adsorption and expand the oxygen reduction interface, resulting in the acceleration of the electron/charge transfer processes. The optimized Fe3–N–C-800 acts as an oxygen reduction electrocatalyst in alkaline solutions and can significantly improve the ORR catalytic activity (E1/2 = 0.84 V), stability, and methanol resistance, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the Zn–air cell assembled with porous Fe3–N–C-800 catalyst as the air cathode has high open-circuit voltage (1.485 V), high power density (80 mW cm−2), high specific capacity (870 mA h g−1 at 10 mA cm−2), as well as excellent reversibility and stability.
