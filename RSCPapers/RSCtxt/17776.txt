    , Accepted 30th August 2019First published on 2nd September 2019AbstractA series of four conjugated porous polymer CPPs (CPs1–4) with various geometries have all been readily synthesized via direct C–H arylation between bithiophene (BT) and 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene (TBPy), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirofluorene (TBSF), 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (TBB) and 1,4-dibromobenzene (DB) respectively. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting by these CPPs under visible light irradiation is studied in detail. An amazing hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 95.85 μmol h−1 was successfully achieved by the four-directional Py-BT-based CPP (CP1, 6 mg), using ascorbic acid (AA) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/water as a sacrificial agent and co-solvents respectively. Such a HER value is 8-fold higher than that of applying commonly used MeOH/water as a co-solvent in the same photocatalytic system. Significantly, when a 0.5 wt% platinum (Pt) co-catalyst was added into the above photocatalytic system, an unprecedented HER of 184.86 μmol h−1 (6 mg) was further realized. The combination of atom-economically synthesized CPPs and accelerating the HER by means of simply tuning the composition of co-solvents provided herein represents a promising step toward accessing green energy by green chemistry.
Introduction
Photocatalytic hydrogen production (PHP) from water with the aid of catalysts is a green and promising technology to provide sustainable energy.1,2 Up to now, most studies were focused on inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts,3–8 which usually show limited light absorption in the visible light region. In recent years, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and g-C3N4 derivatives have been explored as important semiconducting polymer photocatalysts for H2 production in the presence of a co-catalyst.9–14 Conjugated porous polymers (CPPs), another class of organic semiconducting materials, have emerged as attractive photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution,15–20 due to their high specific surface area, excellent physicochemical and thermal stability, tunable chemical structure and electronic properties. Indeed, previous studies revealed that the photocatalytic activity of CPPs could be effectively improved by rational structural design.21–30 For examples, Cooper et al. synthesized a series of CPPs with tunable optical gaps via altering the ratio of pyrene to benzene, and found that the energy bands decreased with the increase of pyrene content.21 The same group also developed a series of conjugated polymers by incorporating planarized and hydrophilic dibenzo-[b,d]thiophene sulfone units to increase exciton dissociation18 and dispersity in water,23 and thereby to improve the photocatalytic H2 production. Jiang et al. found that the CPPs based on the 3,7-linking pattern of dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide and pyrene exhibited an HER of 649.3 μmol h−1 (50 mg photocatalyst) with the aid of platinum (Pt) as a cocatalyst.24 Wang et al. introduced electron-output “tentacles” outside the CPP backbones to improve the charge separation and PHP performances.25
In general, CPP materials are synthesized via standard C–M/C–X (M = B and Sn) Suzuki and Stille cross couplings or C–Br/C–Br Yamamoto coupling, which usually involve multiple steps and pre-functionalization of substrates with C–M bonds or a stoichiometric amount of Ni(0) catalyst. The efficient synthetic strategy for CPPs having high catalytic activity will thus be highly desirable to expand the horizon of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In recent years, the direct arylation (DA) of C–H bonds by C–X bonds (C–H/C–X coupling, X = Br or I), involving fewer steps, lower cost, and fewer toxic reagents, has emerged as an atom- and step-economic synthetic strategy to access π-conjugated materials for organic electronic applications,31 such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs),32–36 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),37 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),38 perovskite solar cells (PVSCs),39 and lithium-ion batteries.40 Although there have been many studies regarding DA synthesized π-conjugated materials,31 the CPP photocatalysts obtained via direct C–H arylation coupling for hydrogen evolution have not yet been explored.
Herein, four CPP materials with four-directional, three-directional, and linear geometries have been synthesized in an atom- and step-economic way via direct C–H arylation between bithiophene (BT) and four different aryl multibromides, i.e. 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene (TBPy), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrabromo-9,9′-spirofluorene (TBSF), 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (TBB) and 1,4-dibromobenzene (DB), respectively. The corresponding conjugated polymers, which were accordingly named CP1, CP2, CP3 and CP4, were further studied for visible-light driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water.
The influences of building blocks on the performance of the four CPPs for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution were studied, among which the Py-BT-based CP1 showed the highest catalytic activity. An HER of 10.62 μmol h−1 for CP1 was achieved when ascorbic acid (AA) and MeOH/water were used as a sacrificial agent and co-solvents respectively. To our surprise, by simply replacing protic solvent MeOH with aprotic bipolar solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), an amazing HER of 95.85 μmol h−1 was obtained from 6 mg CP1, which was nine times that of commonly used MeOH/water co-solvents, and one of the highest HERs for Pt-free visible-light-driven hydrogen production by CPPs ever reported. Significantly, when a 0.5% Pt-cocatalyst was loaded into the above photocatalytic system, an unprecedented HER of 184.86 μmol h−1 (6 mg) was further achieved. The current study opens a new direction to accelerate the photocatalytic HER by means of tuning the co-solvents to assist water splitting through a solvation effect and hydrogen-bond non-covalent interaction.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structure analysis

Scheme 1 depicts the synthetic routes of conjugated polymers CPs1–4via direct C–H arylation coupling, and the detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Experimental section. Compared with the traditional C–C couplings such as Suzuki, Stille and Negishi couplings, the direct arylation C–H/C–Br coupling involves fewer steps, lower cost, and fewer toxic reagents along with higher atom-economy. Our previous study showed that thienyl-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) can be directly arylated by varied aryl bromides including DB, TBB, TBSF, TBPy, etc., leading to the formation of D–A conjugated oligomers that were suitable for OPV applications.29,41,42 Here, bithiophene (BT), as a thiophene derivative, was chosen as a coupling partner to react with TBPy, TBSF, TBB and DB under palladium catalysis toward the synthesis of CPPs. The equimolar coupling between C–H from BT and C–Br from aryl multi-bromides led to the formation of conjugated polymers with linear, three-directional and four-directional geometries, respectively. For all C–H/C–Br coupling polymerizations, anhydrous toluene was employed as the reaction medium. Although toluene is a good solvent with high solubility toward many polymers, in this study, insoluble precipitants were observed for all the polymerizations even at a reaction temperature of 100 °C, which means that the synthesized polymers have sufficient degrees of polymerization.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for CPs1–4via direct C–H arylation. Reaction conditions:42,45 BT (1 equiv.), aryl multi-bromides (TBPy, TBSF, TBB and DB were 1/2, 1/2, 2/3 and 1 equiv. respectively), PivOH (30 mol%), anhydrous Cs2CO3 (2 equiv.), Pd2(dba)3 (1.5 mol%) and P(o-MeOPh)3 (3 mol%) in anhydrous toluene at 100 °C for 48 h under an argon atmosphere. 
Typically, the catalytic cycle of Pd-catalyzed C–H/C–Br coupling is started with the formation of C–PdII–Br intermediates from the oxidative addition of C–Br bonds to Pd0, followed by the formation of C–PdII–C intermediates from the transmetalation between C–PdII–Br and C–H bonds via a concerted metalation–deprotonation (CMD) mechanism,43,44 and ended with the formation of C–C bonds from the reductive elimination of C–PdII–C intermediates, along with the re-generation of Pd0 and the restart of the catalytic cycle (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Interestingly, this Pd0–PdII interchange during the catalytic cycle of C–H/C–Br coupling can be well supported by the presence of both zero-valent Pd0 and bivalent PdII species corresponding to two peaks located at 337.5 and 342.6 eV respectively in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of CP1 (Fig. S1c, ESI†).
Although the insolubility of CPPs limited most of the conventional characterization techniques to reveal their exact structures, FT-IR spectral and solid-state 13C NMR spectral analyses still could provide evidence for the chemical structures of these CPPs. The FT-IR of the CPPs showed similar signals in the spectra which were consistent with the expected structure (Fig. S2, ESI†). The characteristic signals at around 3188, 1622 and 786 cm−1 can be attributed to the aromatic rings, and the stretching mode peak of thiophene is at around 1404 cm−1. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy was employed to further confirm their structures (Fig. 1). For all CPPs CPs1–4, the signals at 120–135 ppm and >135 ppm are ascribed respectively to the 3° and 4° carbon on the aromatic units, including pyrene, thiophene, spirofluorene and benzene building blocks. The chemical shifts at ∼136 ppm for all CPPs can be assigned to the 4° carbon (Ca) that links thiophene rings. Due to the similarity among the carbons on the pyrene rings, the signal of solid-state 13C NMR of CP1 was less distinguishable compared with that of CPs2–4. Overall, CP1 exhibits two sets of broad peaks of 120–135 ppm and 135–145 ppm with overlapped signals, which were assigned to 3° and 4° carbon respectively. For CP2, the signal at 150 ppm can be attributed to the sp2 carbons (Ci) of the fluorenes linked to the central sp3 spiro-carbon, and the weak signal at 83 ppm is attributed to the central sp3 carbon of spirobifluorene. As Fig. 1 shows, the carbons of phenyl-BT based CP3 and CP4 can also be well-assigned by solid-state 13C NMR. The above results provide rational evidence for the chemical structures of these CPPs obtained by the C–H activated coupling reaction as expected.

The thermal stability of CPs1–4 was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S3†). All CPs1–4 exhibit good thermal stability, with 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) at 499, 249, 486, and 398 °C under N2 protection, respectively. The higher thermal stability of CP1, CP3 and CP4 can be ascribed to their rigid skeleton. The relatively lower stability of CP2 compared with the others might stem from the decomposition of the sp3 central carbon of spirobifluorenes.
The geometry of building blocks for CPPs can have an influence on the charge transfer along the conjugated chain and charge carrier separation during the photocatalysis process. To better understand the structure–property relationship, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to obtain the optimized fragmental structures of CPs1–4 (Fig. S4, ESI†). CP1 has a planar pyrene core with extended conjugated backbones in four directions. CP2 has a cruciform configuration with two orthogonal conjugated backbones also delocalized in four directions. The conjugated backbones of CP3 and CP4 are extended in three and two directions, respectively. The dihedral angels of bithiophene–pyrene, bithiophene–spirofluorene, and bithiophene–benzene for CPs1–4 are 72°, 47°, 48° and 47°, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Morphology, optical and electrochemical properties
The morphology of CPs1–4 was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which shows that the morphologies of CPs1–4 are different from each other (Fig. 2). CP1 shows a rod-like morphology with a length of ∼30 μm and a width of ∼4.0 μm, whilst the surface of these rod-like particles is tangled with lots of nanosized fibers (Fig. 2a and e). CP2 contains spherical particles with its surfaces composed of many tiny irregular agglomerated nanoparticles (Fig. 2b and f). CP3 exhibits much larger spherical particles than CP2, with the particle surfaces interlaced with nanosheets (Fig. 2c and g). By comparison, CP4 seems to consist of irregular particles fused together with a relatively flat surface (Fig. 2d and h). The morphology of the photocatalyst on micro- and nanometer scales was reported to have an important effect on the light absorption, charge carrier transfer and separation, and thus the catalytic activity.46–48 The rod- and fiber-like morphology on micro- and nanometer scales of CP1 might be beneficial for charge transfer and accessibility of the active sites.

The surface area and porosity of CPs1–4 were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments at 77 K (Fig. S5, ESI†). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface areas (SBET) of CPs1–4 are 251.3, 36.0, 22.9, and 20.1 m2 g−1, among which CP1 has the highest SBET. The high specific surface area of CP1 could be partially explained by its unique nanofiber assembled hollow nanostructure. The N2-absorption isotherms of all the samples show steep rises at a high relative pressure (Fig. S5, ESI†), which might be attributed to the presence of meso- and macropores derived from the interparticle porosities or voids.24CP1 has a dominant pore diameter distribution centered at ∼3.9 nm, indicating the mesoporous nature of CP1. CP1 possesses a nanofiber assembled hollow nanostructure (Fig. 2a) with a high SBET value and porous structure, which would provide more exposed active sites for photocatalytic reactions.46–48
The light absorption, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) level and bandgap are the key parameters that should be fully taken into account when a photocatalyst is designed. Here, the optical and electrochemical properties of the CPPs were investigated by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, CP1 composing of pyrene building blocks exhibits the strongest and broadest light absorption in the visible region ranging from 400 to 600 nm. Also, CP1 has an absorption onset (λonset) at 658.5 nm, which has a great redshift compared with all other CPPs CPs2–4 (559, 554.5 and 577 nm respectively). The differences in light absorption of CPs1–4 are also reflected by the varied colors of the samples. As Fig. 4a shows, the color of CP1 is deep red, while those of CPs2–4 change from light yellow to saffron yellow.

The optical band gap energy (Eoptg) of CPs1–4 was estimated by plotting the curves of (αhν)2vs. hν, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Eoptg values of the samples decrease in the order of CP3 (2.31 eV) > CP2 (2.29 eV) > CP4 (2.21 eV)> CP1 (1.98 eV). CP1 has the narrowest bandgap among all the conjugated polymers. The decreased band gap and enhanced visible-light absorption of CP1 might be ascribed to the low-energy excitations contributed by the planar pyrene building block.21 Such a small Eg value is beneficial to enhance its light absorption in the visible region and in turn to boost its photocatalytic activity.
The steady state fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3c) showed that the photoluminescence emission peaks (λem) of CPs1–4 were at 657, 556, 561 and 588 nm respectively, which are dramatically red-shifted compared with their corresponding absorption spectra. The excited-state lifetime of CPs1–4 was further investigated by using the time-resolved fluorescence decay spectrum (Fig. 3d). Among the synthesized CPs, CP1 shows the longest photogenerated electron lifetime (τ = 1.36 ns), which is about 0.2 ns longer than those of CPs2–4 with values of 1.15, 1.18 and 1.12 ns respectively, indicating that the photoinduced charge carriers in CP1 can be better separated than in the other CPs.

Fig. 3e shows the photocurrent density of CPs1–4 measured under the full-arc using photocurrent density response measurements. The photocurrents of CPs1–4 are 0.25, 0.07, 0.01 and 0.03 μA cm−2 respectively, which follows an order CP1 ≫ CP2 > CP4 > CP3. CP1 exhibited a much higher photocurrent than CPs2–4, indicating that the photoinduced charge transfer and separation in CP1 was much more efficient. The highest photocurrent of CP1 among all CPPs can be partially ascribed to its broadest band of light absorption.
The electrochemical properties and FMOs of CPPs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 3f illustrates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level variation in the polymers. As Fig. 3f shows, all CPs1–4 possess LUMO levels that are high enough to reduce protons for hydrogen production. The LUMOs of CPs1–4 have little difference between each other. The lowest bandgap of CP1 among all CPPs is thus ascribed to its highest HOMO level. The above characterization results demonstrate that the morphology, and optical and electrochemical properties of CPPs can be all finely tuned by altering the π-crosslinker units.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production
Considering its highest SBET, broadest light absorption (Fig. 3a), lowest bandgap, longest excited-state lifetime, highest photocurrent (Fig. 3e) and fiber-like nanostructure morphology (Fig. 2a and e), CP1 was chosen initially as a model catalyst to optimized the conditions for the PHP reaction in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (SED). Varied SEDs including triethanolamine (TEOA), glucose (Glc), and ascorbic acid (AA) were investigated, and methanol (MeOH) was used as the co-solvent. The CP1-photocatalyzed hydrogen production from SED/MeOH/H2O mixtures under simulated visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) showed that the HER follows an order of AA/MeOH/H2O (10.64 μmol h−1) > TEOA/MeOH/H2O (2.04 μmol h−1) > Glc/MeOH/H2O (0.29 μmol h−1) (Fig. 4a), indicating that AA is a more suitable SED than TEOA and Glc in the photocatalytic system for CP1. No hydrogen could be detected for the control experiment without CP1, and it means that the presence of semiconductor photocatalysts is necessary for hydrogen evolution from PHP reactions.
Till now, MeOH is the most commonly used co-solvent for CPP-based organic semiconductor photocatalysts toward PHP reactions.22,23 Also, the previous studies concerning photocatalysis focused mainly on the catalyst design.7,19–30,49 The effect of cosolvents, as the reaction media, on the PHP has not yet been explored. Noting that both organic and inorganic reactions can be subtly influenced by reaction media,50,51 we envisioned that, besides improving the wettability of CPP-based organic semiconductor photocatalysts,52,53 organic co-solvents can also serve as reaction media having solvation effects on the PHP reaction and influence its kinetically.
With this in mind, an aprotic bipolar solvent, DMF, was employed here as an alternative to replace the commonly used protic MeOH. To our surprise, the PHP from SED/DMF/H2O shows much higher H2 evolution rates than those from SED/MeOH/H2O. The HER of SED/DMF/H2O catalyzed by CP1 follows an order of AA/DMF/H2O (95.85 μmol h−1) ≫ TEOA/DMF/H2O (4.52 μmol h−1) > Glc/DMF/H2O (0.65 μmol h−1) (Fig. 4b). The HERs from AA/DMF/H2O, TEOA/DMF/H2O and Glc/DMF/H2O were 9.0, 2.2 and 2.3 times those from AA/MeOH/H2O, TEOA/MeOH/H2O and Glc/MeOH/H2O, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†), which means that the aprotic DMF can accelerate the HER in a much more effective way than the commonly used protic MeOH. The CP1-catalyzed (6 mg) PHP under visible light using 10 vol% DMF and AA in the absence of the Pt co-catalyst achieved an amazing HER of 95.85 μmol h−1. The corresponding normalized HER is 15975 μmol g−1 h−1, which is one of the highest rates among the reported organic22–25,28,54,55 and inorganic8 photocatalysts either with or without the Pt co-catalyst (Table S1†).
Based on above comparative study, one knows that DMF can not only play the same role as MeOH that promotes the wettability and dispersity of CPPs,22,23 but also greatly accelerate their PHP performance. We proposed there are two factors contributing to the enhancement of PHP from the DMF/H2O mixture. Firstly, DMF might have a solvation effect on the transition state involving charge carrier separation, which plays a key role in the photocatalysis. DMF has a high polarity with peripheral negative charge distributed on the O atom (Scheme S1a†), which should have a solvation effect on the positively charged hole, and thus stabilize the photoinduced separated charges (Fig. 5). Secondly, the aprotic DMF, as a solvent containing only hydrogen bond accepting groups CO and C–N bonds, might weaken the O–H bond in H2O via hydrogen-bond non-covalent interaction (Scheme S1b†), and decrease the activation energy needed for the catalytic transformation.
 Fig. 5  Proposed solvation effect of DMF on the photoinduced separated holes. 
The above screening experiments indicated that DMF and AA were an optimum co-solvent and SED respectively. The PHP performance of other bithiophene-based CPPs CPs2–4 in the absence of Pt was also investigated under simulated visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). With DMF and AA as the cosolvent and sacrificial agent, the HERs of CPs2–4 were found to be 1.25, 0.47 and 1.03 μmol h−1 respectively. By comparison, the HER of CP1 (95.85 μmol h−1) under the same conditions is about 75, 203 and 91 times higher than those of CP2, CP3 and CP4, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). The PHP performances of CPs1–4 match well with the corresponding photocurrent density tendency (Fig. 3e). The highest visible-light-driven HER of CP1 among all CPPs can also be attributed to the synergistic effect of its unique fiber-like nanostructure morphology (Fig. 2), highest SBET, broadest visible light absorption band (Fig. 3a), and more efficient charge carrier separation. These results demonstrate that the introduction of planar pyrene as a π-crosslinker will promote the PHP performance in a more effective way compared with other building blocks.
To evaluate the efficiency of energy conversion from solar to hydrogen by CP1, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2 evolution was measured under monochromatic incident light. The AQY (6 mg CP1 dispersed in DMF/H2O/AA mixed solution) recorded at 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 nm was 0.77%, 0.90%, 1.13%, 1.62 and 0.63%, respectively. As shown in Fig. S9,† the AQY increases with the increase of the incident light wavelength, which reaches the highest value at 550 nm (1.62%), and then decreases as the wavelength further increases to 600 nm. This well matches with the light absorption of CP1 dispersed in DMF/H2O, which shows a maximum absorption peak at ∼550 nm. It means that solar-hydrogen conversion efficiency is highly dependent on the light harvest, and the H2 production is driven by light absorption.19 Here, the AQY of 1.62% for CP1 (550 nm) is among the highest values for organic semiconductor photocatalysts reported.
The stability of CP1 catalysis was evaluated in a continuous photocatalytic reaction under visible-light irradiation for 25 h, with intermittent evacuation every 5 h. A linear relationship between the amount of produced H2 and reaction time was observed for each run (Fig. 6a). Although the amount of produced H2 decreased gradually during the first four consecutive runs, ∼70% of the original HER can still be maintained over a period of 20 h. After the fifth run over a period of 25 h, CP1 (6 mg) can still retain an HER of 57.96 μmol h−1.

To figure out the reasons for this decreased trend, CP1 before and after a cycling test was analyzed for comparison. FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared and the recycled CP1 showed a high similarity (Fig. S10, ESI†). The UV-vis reflectance spectra also showed that the light absorption of the recovered CP1 has almost no difference with that of the as-prepared one (Fig. S11, ESI†), indicating that the decreased activity was caused by other factors rather than the light absorption. The morphologies of CP1 before and after the cycling test at micro- and nano-meter levels were investigated by SEM and TEM respectively. Overall, both the SEM and TEM tests (Fig. 6b–g) revealed that the rod-like structure of CP1 at the micrometer level still remained, while the structure on the nanometer scale has been broken after the cycling test. SEM shows that the as-prepared CP1 has a clear fiber-like morphology on the nanometer scale (Fig. 6b), while after the cycling test, these nanofibers became blurred and nearly disappeared (Fig. 6c).
The TEM of the as-prepared CP1 at higher magnification exhibited hollow nanostructures with internal voids (Fig. 6d and f). The hollow nanostructures are believed to have several advantages for photocatalysis, such as enhanced light harvest by light scattering, reduced charge transfer distance, and available inner and outer space for reactants.46–48 However, after the cycling test, these nano-hollows were filled and became blurred (Fig. 6e and g), which accounts for the decreased activity of CP1 with the increase of the cycle number. The comparative study of CP1 before and after recycling revealed that the morphology at micro- and nanometer levels plays an important role in the photocatalysis of CPP materials.
To explore the practical application of CPP-based photocatalysts, municipal water was employed for PHP using DMF and AA as the co-solvent and SED respectively. Interestingly, when municipal water, rather than DI water, was used as a hydrogen source, CP1 can still maintain an average HER of 45.78 μmol h−1 in five hours with 6 mg CP1, demonstrating that the CPPs synthesized via direct C–H arylation coupling could be exploited as potential photocatalysts for practical application.
It is noteworthy that all the above PHP tests were performed on the as-synthesized CPs1–4, without the aid of a platinum (Pt) co-catalyst. Considering that Pt is one of the most effective cocatalysts for the PHP reaction, here, the photocatalytic activity of CP1 loaded with 0.5 wt% Pt was also investigated. Amazingly, the PHP of CP1 (6 mg) loaded with the Pt-cocatalyst achieved an unprecedented HER of 184.86 μmol h−1 (30810 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light irradiation, which was nearly twice that of the above one without Pt (95.85 μmol h−1, Fig. S12, ESI†), further demonstrating that DMF/water mixed solvent is a promising medium for CPP-based photocatalysts toward H2 production. Table 1 summarizes the significant optical and electrochemical properties, SBET and PHP performances of CPs1–4 with AA/DMF/H2O under visible light.

Conclusions
For the first time, an atom- and step-economic direct C–H arylation coupling synthetic strategy has been developed to access CPP semiconducting materials used for photocatalytic H2 production from water, and the PHP performance can be greatly accelerated by the presence of DMF. The combination of AA, DMF and H2O, serving as a SED, co-solvent and H2 source respectively, catalyzed by 6 mg pyrene–bithiophene-based CP1 under visible light without the aid of Pt led to an HER of 95.85 μmol h−1, which was nine times that of AA/MeOH/H2O (10.64 μmol h−1) and one of the fastest normalized HERs among the reported organic photocatalysts. More importantly, the introduction of a 0.5 wt% Pt co-catalyst further boosted the PHP to an amazing HER of 184.86 μmol h−1, implying that the aprotic bipolar DMF is an attractive alternative to the commonly used MeOH cosolvent for CPP-based photocatalysis.
We proposed a mechanism based on the solvation effect of DMF on the separated charge carriers (Fig. 5) and the hydrogen-bond non-covalent interaction between DMF and H2O (Scheme S1b†). Although the mechanism needs to be further explored and verified, this preliminary yet exciting finding opens a new way to accelerate photocatalytic activity by simply tuning the reaction medium. Also, the integration of atom-economically synthesized CPPs with solvent-accelerated performance will promote the practical application of photocatalytic H2 production. Further systematic study on the solvation effects of varied solvents on PHP using organic semiconducting materials is underway in our group.
Experimental
Materials
2,2′-Bithiophene (98%), TBPy (98%), TBB (98%), DB (99%), Pd2(dba)3 (98%), PivOH (99%), ascorbic acid (98%), DMF (AR) Cs2CO3 (99.9%) and P(o-MeOPh)3 (98%) were purchased from Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China). TBSF (98%) was purchased from Derthon Co. Ltd (Shenzhen China). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Anhydrous toluene was obtained by distillation after calcium hydride treatment. CPs1–4 were synthesized separately in four pots by direct C–H arylation coupling polymerization using the same amount of 2,2′-bithiophene.
Synthesis of CPs1–4
The synthetic procedures were as follows. 2,2′-Bithiophene (150.0 mg, 0.90 mmol), aryl multi-bromides (TBPy, 233.6 mg, 0.5 equiv., for CP1; TBSF, 285.1 mg, 0.5 equiv., for CP2; TBB, 188.9 mg, 2/3 equiv., for CP3; DB, 212.8 mg, 1 equiv., for CP4), PivOH (28.7 mg, 30 mol%), anhydrous Cs2CO3 (586.4 mg, 2 equiv.), Pd2(dba)3 (12.4 mg, 1.5 mol%), and P(o-MeOPh)3 (9.5 mg, 3 mol%) were added into Schlenk tubes. The mixture in the tubes was purged by repetitions of vacuum and argon filling (×3). Then 10 mL anhydrous toluene was added into the tubes. The mixture was put through freeze–vacuum–thaw cycles two times to remove dissolved air, and then rigorously stirred at 100 °C for 48 h under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was washed with CH2CH2 and filtered to remove the solvent. The undissolved crude CPP product on the filter paper was washed successively with CH2Cl2, methanol, and water to remove the unreacted small molecules and inorganic salt, respectively. Then the product was dried in a vacuum for 24 h at 100 °C and obtained the powder of polymers CP1, CP2, CP3 and CP4 in yields of 93%, 95%, 96% and 92% respectively.

Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests
The hydrogen evolution experiment was performed on a LabSolar-III AG reaction cell (Beijing PerfectLight Co.) at room temperature. A 6 mg photocatalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in a mixed solution containing 30 mL DI water, 6 g SEDs, and 3 ml cosolvents (MeOH or DMF). The suspension was degassed by evacuation to remove the dissolved air. The photocatalytic reaction was irradiated with a 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Perfect Light Co.) with a cut off filter (EXCELITAS, λ > 420 nm) under vacuum and slow stirring. The amount of hydrogen was detected online by using a gas chromatograph (GC7900, Techcomp) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and argon was used as the carrier gas.
AQY measurements
The AQY was measured at selected wavelengths enabled by different band pass filters at 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 nm. The intensities were calibrated as 22, 28, 34, 39 and 45 mW cm−1 respectively, by using a power meter (Model 843R, Newport). The AQY at a given wavelength was calculated using the following equation.28  where M is the amount of H2 (mol), NA is the Avogadro constant, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, S is the irradiation area (25.5 cm2 in our experiment), P is the intensity of irradiation light (W cm−2), t is the irradiation time (s), and λ is the wavelength of the monochromatic light (m).
