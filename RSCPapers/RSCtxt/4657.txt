    , Accepted 28th September 2017First published on 29th September 2017AbstractPhotoconversion of carbon dioxide with water into renewable solar fuels using a single integrated system is the primary goal of artificial photosynthesis. The ease of applying mechanical strain reversibly in low dimensional materials can be exploited in optimizing their artificial photosynthetic or photocatalytic properties. In this work, strain effects on the concerted interplay of all the factors controlling the photocatalytic ability, such as suitable band edges straddling the redox potentials for CO2 reduction with the water and oxygen evolution reactions, optical absorbance and conductivity, carrier mobilities, carrier mobility ratios (i.e. hole/electron or electron/hole mobility ratio) and exciton binding energies, have been comprehensively studied on monolayer MoS2 nanosheets and calibrated, using density functional theory, to ascertain the type and magnitude of strain under which the optical absorbance and conductivity, carrier mobilities and the carrier mobility ratio are simultaneously and optimally enhanced, while the requisite redox reactivity and small exciton binding energies are retained. Additionally, the role of pH has been carefully addressed. Optical conductivity in pristine ML-MoS2 calculated in this work agrees with the experimental ones. Of all strain types studied, shear strain is found to be most effective in driving the kinetics of the light-driven reduction of CO2 with water, water reduction in the absence of CO2 [i.e. the H2 evolution reaction (HER)] and oxidation of water [i.e., the O2 evolution reaction (OER)] with nearly the same efficiency. The optical absorbance and conductivity are found to reach their maximum magnitude at 3% shear strain along the direction of lattice dilation. 0.5–3.5 and 0.5–6.5 ranges in pH are found to be favorable for the photo-catalytic HER and CO2 reduction with water respectively. Carrier mobility has been calculated using a more reliable and robust formulation where the carrier mobility depends not only on the carrier effective mass, deformation potential and elastic modulus along the longitudinal charge transport direction but also on these parameters along the transverse direction. Shear strain induces the maximum enhancement in carrier mobilities and the carrier mobility ratio, which facilitates the separation and migration of e−–h+ pairs along opposite or transverse directions and thereby in prolonging the carrier lifetimes, i.e., lowering their recombination rates.
1. Introduction
The energy crisis, global warming and the escalating anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases driven by the growing consumption of limited and unsustainable fossil fuels, have been an alarming cause for concern.1–6 Among various strategies to harness reliable, clean, cheap, green, sustainable and renewable energy, scavenging solar energy7 has emerged as the most viable one, e.g., in photovoltaics and water splitting. The most troublesome greenhouse gas, CO2 is an extremely stable molecule where carbon exists in its highest oxidation state. Returning CO2 to a useful state via partial or complete reduction is an intricate problem from both scientific and technological perspectives. It requires appropriate catalysts and energy inputs, thereby posing several fundamental challenges in chemical catalysis, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and semiconductor physics and engineering. CO2 conversion via electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is already well documented. In the context of such useful pointers, one of the promising avenues turns out to be artificial photosynthesis, which replicates the natural process of photosynthesis, a process where sunlight induces the simultaneous conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen. Solar Water Splitting (SWS)8 and light-driven carbon dioxide reduction,9 which also addresses the natural carbon fixation, have been drawing a surge in research interest. Photo-catalysts based on semiconducting materials are being actively investigated for solar light harvesting in several applications such as water splitting, dye degradation and CO2 reduction.10–12 It requires only water and sunlight, supplies of which are almost unlimited.
Photo-catalysts powered by sunlight offer a potential clean and renewable way to produce fuels and fuel precursors such as H2, HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, CH4, via simultaneous photoconversion of CO2 and water. The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels, such as, HCOOH, HCHO and CH3OH, depending on the varying degrees in reducibility of CO2, is a crucial goal that would positively impact the global carbon balance by recycling CO2 into usable fuels. The potential rewards that can accrue from meeting the challenges in artificial photosynthesis are enormous.
Due to quantum confinement effects, reducing the dimensionality is a promising way to tailor the electronic and optical properties of a material. Moreover, the valence band edge (VBE) and conduction band edge (CBE) positions can also be tuned along with other physical parameters.13,14 In nanosheets and nanoparticles, a high surface-to-volume ratio provides more chemically active sites15 and more efficient light absorption and separation of electron–hole pairs as compared to their corresponding bulk counterparts.16 Therefore, nanomaterials can potentially serve as new building blocks in constructing light energy harvesting assemblies and in opening up new avenues for utilizing renewable energy sources.
MoS2 has been extensively studied as a promising electro-catalyst for H2 evolution due to its high HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) activity and can be regarded as a promising alternative to Pt due to its high abundance and low cost.17–22 Using μ-Raman spectroscopy, underwater stability of single layer MoS2 has already been verified.23 Xiao et al. have demonstrated the high efficiency of crystallinity controllable monolayer (ML) MoS2 for solar hydrogen production.24 Doping of MoS2 with different types of dopants has also been investigated.25–27 Recently, on the basis of experimental investigation, Liu et al. reported flower-like N-doped MoS2 for water pollution treatment.26 Li et al. have explored the potential of phosphorus based p-type dopants in water-splitting. MoS2 based hetero-structures have also been widely investigated28–31 in this regard. Wang et al.32 predicted that the type-II band alignment in a hybrid g-C3N4/MoS2 nanocomposite may enhance photo-catalytic activity. Recently, Abbasi et al.33 achieved the lowest onset potential for CO2 reduction using Nb-doped vertically aligned MoS2. Asadi et al.34 have unveiled that layer-stacked bulk MoS2 shows superior carbon dioxide reduction performance relative to the noble metals such as Au and Ag in terms of a high current density and low over potential (54 mV) in an ionic liquid. A few more strategies consisting of nanostructural engineering, such as alloying35,36 and doping,27,37 have also been adopted to improve photocatalytic water splitting by tuning the band edges. Notwithstanding the ease of applying mechanical strain reversibly, strain effects have been relatively sparsely explored.
Strain arises naturally in heterostructures and core–shell structures due to lattice mismatch at the interfaces. However, strain effects are usually masked by other effects. The influence of strain on the electrocatalytic activity, e.g., the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in Pt, Cu and Ni films, has been reported, where the effect of strain has been isolated from other factors.38 In this combined experimental and theoretical study38 elastic strain has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in controlling the HER. Strain effects on the photocatalytic activities have been relatively scarcely studied experimentally. For instance, modulation in photocatalytic properties via strain in 2D BiOBr nanosheets has been studied.39 In an experimental study, enhancement in the photocatalytic HER in MoS2 nanosheets has been attributed to the increased specific surface area or tensile strain induced by the lattice mismatch at the MoS2/TiO2 interface.40 Despite a limited number of studies on the role of strain in catalytic reactions,39,41–44 an in-depth investigation of the same on photocatalysis in 2D materials which adequately addresses the interplay of all the controlling factors is conspicuously missing. Moreover, in ab initio studies, photocatalytic activities have mainly been assessed in terms of band gap engineering or alignment of the band edges of the photocatalytic material with the redox potential for water splitting and CO2 reduction,27,36,45–47 which have undoubtedly advanced our scientific understanding. However, the efficiency in photocatalytic activity is governed by the collective operation of a multitude of factors such as suitable band edges straddling the redox potentials, high optical absorbance and conductivity, small exciton binding energies, high carrier mobility, and large carrier mobility ratios for prolonging carrier lifetimes or lowering carrier recombination rates. The interconnections between all these factors and their variation with strain of all kinds have been comprehensively studied in this article using density functional theory to calibrate the photocatalytic response and, in turn, ascertain the magnitude and type of strain under which the artificial photosynthetic activity of single layer MoS2 is optimally enhanced. Besides a detailed study on strain effects, the role of pH has been carefully addressed to find the appropriate pH for optimum solar energy harvesting in the photoconversion of CO2 with H2O. To the best of the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study on artificial photosynthesis in single layer MoS2. Our insightful findings are understood to motivate experimental work on strain controllable photocatalytic activity.
2. Computational methodology
First-principles calculations have been carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),48–51 which is based on density functional theory (DFT). Electronic structure calculations have been performed using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)52 variant of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. A cut off energy of 500 eV for the plane wave basis set has been used throughout all the calculations. Both atomic positions and lattice constants were fully relaxed using the conjugate gradient method. Atomic relaxations have been performed until the Hellmann–Feynman forces on each atom reached less than 1 meV Å−1. The total energy convergence criterion between successive self-consistent cycles was set at 1 × 10−5 eV. A 16 × 9 × 1 and a 9 × 9 × 1 Γ-centred k-mesh have been sampled respectively for the supercells in orthorhombic and hexagonal symmetries to optimize the geometry of ML-MoS2. A vacuum thickness of more than 14 Å along the z direction was adopted to reduce the spurious interactions between the periodic images to a negligible level. For all the strained systems, only the ionic relaxations have been carried out, while the scaled lattice constants have been held fixed, as routinely pursued in earlier works.53–55 Shear strain of type-I corresponds to the application of tensile strain and compressive strain of the same magnitude along the zigzag (zz) and armchair (ac) directions respectively, while shear strain of type II is the other way round.

0 or the quasiparticle (QP) approximation56 is known to compute the band gap and band edges more accurately and reliably as compared to the routinely used DFT functionals. Therefore, to get around the computationally demanding and time consuming QP calculations, the following assumptions have been reasonably made to combine the speed of GGA-PBE with the accuracy of QP.
(1) The electronic band structure of both strain-free and strained ML-MoS2 has been calculated by using a GGA + PBE XC functional and the energy of the band edges obtained from G0W0 approximation56 in an earlier study has been used as a valuable input in the current study.
(2) The band structure of all the strained geometries has been calculated by using GGA-PBE as an XC functional.
(3) GGA-PBE is good at predicting trends, e.g., the variation in band edges, band gap, absorbance peaks, etc. with strain. Therefore, the strain induced shift in the band edges calculated using GGA-PBE has been added to the band edges of the pristine and unstrained MoS2 single layer obtained from G0W0 or quasi particle (QP) approximation56 corresponding to the different levels and types of strain.
The optical properties of ML-MoS2 have been determined by the frequency dependent complex dielectric function, ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω), which represents a linear response of the system to an external electromagnetic field. The dielectric function ε(ω) consists of two contributions: a Drude-like intraband contribution and an interband contribution. The imaginary part of the interband contribution involves the interband matrix elements of the momentum operators and can be evaluated directly in DFT.57  where the indices c and v refer to the conduction and valence band states respectively and uck is the cell periodic part of the orbitals at the k-point.
Its real part can then be calculated using Kramers–Kronig transformation.  where P denotes the principle value and a small complex shift (η) of 0.1 has been used for slight smoothening of the real part of the dielectric function, which is routinely used in most of the calculations.
Several optical parameters such as absorbance, reflectivity, the EELS (electron energy loss spectra) function, the extinction function, optical conductivity etc. can be derived from ε1(ω) and ε2(ω). The optical properties of ML-MoS2 are calculated from the complex dielectric function. The absorption coefficient (αabs) is given by , where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the frequency dependent dielectric function, ε(ω). By taking the tensor nature of ε(ω) into account, ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) have been averaged over the three polarization vectors (along x, y, and z directions).
3. Results and discussion
Naturally occurring MoS2 can be found in two major polytypes: 2H and 3R phases. Out of these two, the 2H phase having D6h point group symmetry is more abundant. The 2H-phase can be converted into a 1H-phase with a D3h point group by exfoliating it from its bulk. In 1H-MoS2, each Mo(IV) centre occupies a trigonal prismatic coordination sphere that binds to six sulphide ligands and each sulphur center is pyramidal and is connected to three Mo atoms forming the trigonal prismatic layered structure. ML-MoS2 nanosheets are highly flexible and their electronic properties can be extensively tuned via the application of strain. To realize the application of mechanical strain, we initialized the atomic positions in the 2D MoS2 nanosheets in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice with two different symmetries, namely, hexagonal and orthorhombic (rectangular in plane), as shown in Fig. 1(a), for a systematic investigation. The lattice constants in the hexagonal supercell along the two equivalent lattice directions, namely, the zz direction, are equal (a = b), whereas the orthorhombic supercell has a rectangular symmetry and shows two non-equivalent directions, namely, zz and ac directions along its x and y axes respectively. The optimized lattice constants for both supercells are shown in Fig. 1(c), which is in agreement with earlier findings.58–67 The Mo–S bond length is found to be 2.41 Å and the vertical S–S distance is 3.12 Å, which is consistent with the previous reports.58–67

3.1 Optical properties
The photo-catalytic properties of inorganic semiconducting materials are significantly controlled by their optical response. Therefore, the fundamental optical properties such as the frequency dependent dielectric function and absorbance spectra of strain free pristine ML-MoS2 nanosheets have been calculated first, which is shown in Fig. S1(a) and (b) (see the ESI†). In pristine ML-MoS2 nanosheets, the prominent absorption peak in the absorbance spectra occurs at 2.7 eV with their low excitonic peaks at around 1.8 to 2.1 eV. The low energy excitonic peaks are not well resolved under the independent particle approximation as it does not take into account the local field and the excitonic effects. However, this approximation has been found to be good enough to predict trends in the perturbative response of the optical properties, e.g., under the application of an electric field or strain.68,69 The absorbance along the zz direction reaches its maximum when 3% uniaxial tensile strain is applied along the zz direction; however, corresponding to the uniaxial tensile strain applied along the ac direction, the maximum value is attained along the ac direction at the same percentage of strain. For biaxial tensile strain, the absorbance peaks up at 1% along both the zz and ac directions.
The redshift in the absorbance peaks with the application of tensile strain of both kinds, uniaxial and biaxial, agrees with the trends in PL observed experimentally.68,69 For shear strain of type I, the maximum in absorbance is attained along the zz direction at 3% strain; however, the maximum switches to the ac direction for shear strain of type-II (see the ESI, Fig. S2†) corresponding to the same strain %.
Furthermore, optical conductivity in pristine, strain free ML-MoS2 nanosheets has been calculated using the relationship , where σ1(ω) and σ2(ω) are real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity and ω is the frequency of the incident photon as shown in Fig. S1(c) (see the ESI†). The calculated optical conductivity correctly reproduces all main features measured experimentally70 and calculated theoretically71 based on the empirical Sellmeier equation between refractive index and incident photon energy. A sharp rise or a peak at ħω = 2.7 eV, shown in Fig. S1(c) (see the ESI†), has been observed on account of the interband transition. The real and imaginary parts of the optical conductivity, σ1(ω) and σ2(ω), signify the dissipation of electromagnetic energy and the screening of the applied field respectively. The peak in σ1(ω) attains its maximum value along the zz direction when 3% uniaxial tensile strain is applied along the zz direction. For uniaxial tensile strain applied along the ac direction, σ1(ω) shows peak up at 1% of strain along the ac direction. For biaxial tensile strain, σ1(ω) reaches its maximum along the zz direction at 1% strain. Upon the application of shear strain of type-I, the peak in σ1(ω) is found to reach its maximum at 3% strain along the zz direction, whereas for shear type-II, the maximum is attained along the ac direction, as shown in Fig. 2. Shear strain is found to be more effective as compared to the tensile and biaxial strain in enhancing the magnitude of σ1(ω) significantly.

Furthermore, exciton binding energies under different types and magnitudes of strain have been investigated. Small exciton binding energies are desirable to facilitate the splitting of excitons into free charge carriers (electrons and holes). The Mott–Wannier exciton hydrogenic model has been considered to calculate the exciton binding energy using the formula: , where m0 is the electron rest mass, μex−1 = me−1 + mh−1 is the exciton effective mass and ε is the macroscopic static dielectric constant. The calculated value of exciton binding energy for ML-MoS2 is 0.41 eV which is in good agreement with the previous reports.72,73 It is very important to note the variation in exciton binding energy with applied mechanical strain. High exciton binding energies hinder electron–hole separation. The variation in exciton binding energy with uniaxial strain (which agreed well with the theoretical results74,75) has been studied in an independent study and is partially shown here for all other strained systems. The exciton binding energy reaches 0.65 eV at 1% uniaxial tensile strain applied along the zz and ac directions while it decreases from 0.65 eV to 0.41 eV when the uniaxial tensile strain is varied from 2 to 9%. At 5% of uniaxial compression, it reaches its highest value of 0.91 eV. The exciton binding energy decreases for uniaxial compression higher than 5% and reaches 0.7 eV at 9%. Under the application of biaxial tensile strain, its value reaches its maximum, 0.65 eV, at 1% strain and declines for strain greater than 1%. It reaches 0.29 eV at 9% strain, as shown in Fig. S3 (see the ESI†). Its value also increases with biaxial compression and reaches its maximum, 0.68 eV, at 4% of biaxial compression and then decreases and reaches 0.35 eV at 9%. However, a sharp drop in exciton binding energy along the zz direction, from 0.41 eV to 0.27 eV, is found to occur at 8% shear strain of type-II, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Variation in exciton binding energies with shear strain applied on to the ML-MoS2 nanosheets (shear strain of type-I corresponds to the application of tensile strain and compressive strain of the same magnitude along the zigzag and armchair directions respectively, while shear strain of type-II is the other way round: application of tensile and compressive strain of equal magnitude along the armchair and zigzag directions respectively). The calculated exciton binding energy for pristine and unstrained single layer MoS2 (0.41 eV) is in good agreement with the previous reports [Phys. Rev. B, 2012, 85, 205302, Phys. Rev. B, 2014, 90, 75429]. The exciton binding energies are small at 3–4% strain, when the optical absorbance and conductivity reach their maximum. 
3.2 Electronic properties: band edges relative to redox potentials
For an inorganic semiconductor to function as an efficient photo-catalyst, proper alignment of the energy levels with respect to the redox level is a must. A photocatalytic material needs to be a semi-conductor with a minimum band-gap (Eg) of 1.23 eV in order to be able to absorb incident photons having energy E = hν ≥ 1.23 eV, i.e. a wavelength λ ≤ 1010 nm under standard conditions (T = 298 K, P = 1 bar and pH = 0). However, thermo-dynamical losses have to be realistically taken into account, implying that the minimum band gap needs to be at least 1.5 eV that allows absorption of a large portion of the solar spectrum. Also, the photo-catalyst must have suitable band edges to straddle the redox potential of water to drive the kinetics of the half-cell reactions, hydrogen evolution (reduction) and oxygen evolution (oxidation) reactions. On the absolute vacuum scale, at pH = 0, this minimum band gap value of 1.23 eV corresponds to the situation where the CBE would ideally lie at −4.44 eV, the reduction potential (RP) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (H+/H2) and the VBE would remain at −5.67 eV, the oxidation potential (OP) for the oxygen evolution reaction (H2O/O2). If CBE and VBE energy levels are positive and negative relative to the reduction and oxidation potentials, the water splitting reaction will be favoured. Likewise, CO2 reduction with water is thermodynamically favourable when the band edges straddle the reduction potentials of CO2 and the oxidation potential of H2O. The minimum band gap required for CO2 reduction is 1.43 eV, which is 0.2 eV higher than the one needed for water splitting. This is due to the fact that the highest reduction potential for CO2 which corresponds to the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH lies at −4.24 eV.
The magnitude of the band gap in ML-MoS2 is larger than 1.23 eV and its band edges do straddle the reduction potentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (H+/H2) or the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2/HCOOH) and oxidation potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (H2O/O2).
The CBE in ML-MoS2 lies above the CO2 reduction level, and thereby CO2 reduction is also thermodynamically favorable, in the presence of CO2. Therefore, it turns out that ML-MoS2 is suitable not only for H2O reduction but also for CO2 reduction. For water splitting to occur, which leads to the evolution of H2 and O2, the following criteria are required to be satisfied at pH = 7.76    whereas for CO2 reduction to HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, or CH4, at pH = 7, the criteria change to the following.        here E0 represents the standard reduction potentials for different species.
As the electronic properties in ML-MoS2 are very sensitive to the applied mechanical strain, the variation in the alignment of the band edges with respect to the reduction potentials of both H2O and CO2 and oxidation potential of H2O has been plotted as a function of strain in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) depicts that the CBE drops gradually towards the reduction potential with the application of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strains; however, the VBE progressively rises towards the oxidation potential. 6% and 7% are found to be the optimum magnitudes of uniaxial tensile strain applied along the zz and ac directions, corresponding to which the band edges reach closest to the redox potentials. For biaxial tensile strain, it occurs at 4% when both oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions are optimally favored. Moreover, the optical conductivity and absorbance reach their maximum at 3% and 1% uniaxial tensile strain along zig-zag and arm-chair directions respectively, and 1% biaxial tensile strain. These results on tensile strain are consistent with the experimentally observed enhancement in the photocatalytic HER in MoS2 nanosheets induced by the increased specific surface area or tensile strain induced by the lattice mismatch at the MoS2/TiO2 interface.40 Shear strain is found to be particularly interesting. The band edge positions undergo minimal changes under the application of shear strain of both types, whereas the other properties such as carrier mobility vary significantly with the application of shear strain. With the application of shear strain of both types, the CBE and VBE are found to shift slightly towards the reduction potential and oxidation potential respectively.

For CO2 reduction with H2O, the reduction potential is not a single one or unique. The several reduction potentials of CO2 correspond to the different degrees in the reduction of CO2. Production of different solar fuels or precursors such as HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, CO and CH4 is determined by the extent to which the oxidation state in C is lowered. As the CBE in ML-MoS2 nanosheets lies above all these reduction potentials, it may be considered as a suitable candidate for CO2 reduction as well. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4(b), 3% of uniaxial tensile strain along the zz as well as ac directions is the optimum strain percentage. For biaxial tensile strain the optimum value is 1% of strain. For shear strain cases, band edges hardly shift with the application of strain.
3.3 Suitability of pH for solar fuel production
Efficiency of photo-catalytic reactions is crucially determined by the pH value.47,77 The water redox potential can be adjusted to a suitable level to drive the overall water-splitting reactions on a single-layer MoS2 photo-catalyst. Many metal complexes such as Mn, Fe, Co etc.78 are known to catalyze CO2 reduction and some of them show high selectivity. Selectivity over an inorganic semiconductor can be controlled by changing acidity/basicity. Furthermore, differences in the potential for reduction of CO2 to different fuels, such as HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, CH4, depending on the degree of CO2 reduction, provides an opportunity to carefully tune the selectivity in the generation of these renewable solar fuels, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The reduction potential of all the fuel precursors can be adjusted to a suitable pH for CO2 reduction. The experimental values of redox potential for all redox levels at pH = 7 (ref. 79) have been used in this study. Specifically, the electrochemical potential of the oxidation and reduction reactions can be calculated using the Nernst equation80 at all pH ranges from 0–14.    where pO2 denotes the partial pressure of oxygen under ambient conditions, −4.44 eV corresponds to the NHE potential, and pOH + pH = 14. From Fig. 5(a) it can be directly observed that pH between 0.5 and 6.5 seems to be the favorable condition for the water splitting reaction whereas for CO2 reduction with H2O, the suitable pH range is 0.5–3, as shown in Fig. 5(b).

3.4 Carrier mobility
The photocatalytic activity strongly depends on the charge carrier separation, carrier lifetimes or carrier recombination rates. To study the separation and migration of electron–hole pairs, the charge carrier mobility in pristine ML-MoS2 nanosheets and its variation with the applied mechanical strain has been studied. The correlation between the electron–hole recombination rate and the degree of lattice strain has also experimentally verified with silicon NWs and strain-tuned carrier decay lifetimes in InGaN/GaN SQW.81,82 Room temperature carrier mobility is calculated by using a longitudinal acoustic phonon-limited scattering model which was actually based on the deformation potential approximation formulated by Bardeen and Shockley.83,84 In 2D inorganic semiconductors, at room temperature, the coherent wavelength of thermally agitated carriers is much larger than their lattice constants and is close to acoustic phonon modes at the zone center of the BZ where coupling between electron and acoustic phonons dominates over the carrier scattering in the low energy regime. Therefore, in this limit, carrier mobility can be effectively derived from the effective mass and deformation potential approximation. This formulation has recently been significantly refined by Lang et al.84 In this formulation, mobility along one direction depends not only on the parameters (effective mass, deformation potential constant, and elastic modulus) in the same direction, but also on those along the perpendicular direction. The carrier mobility ratio has been shown to arise mainly from the anisotropic effective mass, while the contribution from the deformation potential constant and the elastic modulus is relatively insignificant. It has also been used recently to study SnSe.85 MoS2 has not been studied in that article possibly due to its isotropic nature in the pristine structure in terms of all these parameters, such as effective mass and elastic modulus. Nevertheless, the application of mechanical strain induces anisotropy in ML-MoS2 and therefore, this approach is substantially more accurate in calculating the carrier mobility and its anisotropy under strain. The original formulation of the deformation potential theory of Bardeen and Shockley, which has been widely adopted has been demonstrated to be relatively much less reliable and more likely to overestimate the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility ratio, relative to this new formulation, in a large number of case studies.84 The carrier mobility in the new formulation is given as  where α = e, h denotes the type of carrier (electrons or holes), the effective mass of carriers α in the units of rest mass of electron m0 along the x and y directions is denoted by mαx and mαy respectively and calculated by using the relationship: mα = ħ2[∂2E(k)/∂k2]−1, the deformation potentials of the carriers along the x and y directions are denoted by Eαx and Eαy respectively and 2D elastic stiffness coefficients along the x and y directions are denoted by Cx2D and Cy2D respectively. All the mobility calculations have been carried out at 300 K. The other component μαy of mobility can be easily calculated by simply interchanging x and y in the above mobility relationship. The calculated parameters for the pristine ML-MoS2 are tabulated in Table 1.

For pristine ML-MoS2, the electron mobilities are found to be 21.52 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 20.89 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the zz and ac directions respectively, whereas hole mobilities are found to be 38.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 38.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the zz and ac directions respectively. Using this new formulation, the hole mobility is found to be two times the electron mobility, which is in good agreement with experimental findings.86 However, the hole to electron mobility ratio was reported to be about three, using the original deformation potential theory of Bardeen and Shockley,87 implying the higher accuracy and reliability of the most recent formulation. The effective masses and the carrier mobilities are found to be isotropic in pristine ML-MoS2 nanosheets; however, anisotropy arises when external mechanical strain is applied to the monolayer nanosheets. To clarify the strain-induced anisotropy, the mobility of charge carriers along the zz and ac directions has been plotted as a function of strain in Fig. 6. The hole mobility drops down drastically under the application of 1% tensile strain of both types, namely, tensile and uniaxial, applied along the zz and the ac directions. The hole mobility remains nearly the same even for higher values of applied tensile strain. Shear strain of type II was found to be the most interesting one where the hole mobility increases along the zz direction while electron mobility decreases along the ac direction. At 3–4% of this strain, which is actually the optimal value for optical and electronic properties, the difference between the electron mobility and hole mobility in the transverse direction is large enough to bring about electron–hole separation and their subsequent migration along the opposite or mutually perpendicular directions, as shown in Fig. 6(e) and (f). The relaxation time of the charge carriers also signify the role of shear type-II strain as explained in detail in Fig. S6 (see the ESI†). Furthermore, the carrier mobility ratio of the charge carriers is calculated using the relationship:  where η is either the zz or the ac direction as shown in Fig. 7. At 1% of uniaxial tensile strain along the zz and ac directions and also with biaxial tensile strain, the carrier mobility ratio reaches its maximum value and beyond this value the ratio decreases with the further applied tensile strain. This is due to the significantly small hole mobility at 1% tensile strain. Shear strain of type-II strain is found to be very interesting where the anisotropic ratio gradually increases with strain, as shown in Fig. 7(d), which clearly indicates the higher probabilities for electron–hole separation and their migration along different directions.
 Fig. 6  Variation in carrier mobility (a)–(e) with the application of external mechanical strain of different types on the ML-MoS2 nanosheets and (f) high carrier mobility ratio ensures an efficient separation of e−/h+ pairs at 3–4% of shear strain, when optical absorbance/conductivity also reaches its maximum. 
 Fig. 7  Variation in the carrier mobility ratio with the mechanical strain applied on to the ML-MoS2 nanosheets (a)–(d): carrier mobility ratio, , where η is either the zigzag (zz) or the armchair (ac) direction. , μe(h) is the electron (hole) mobility. Labels in (a): zz–ZZ denotes the anisotropy ratio, Rani along the zig-zag (zz) direction for uniaxial strain applied along the zig-zag (ZZ) direction. Likewise, ac–ZZ implies the anisotropy ratio along the arm-chair (ac) direction for uniaxial strain applied along the zig-zag (ZZ) direction and so on. 
4. Conclusions
Solar fuel production from abundant sources such as CO2 and H2O is a daunting research challenge that necessarily requires a number of interconnected factors to act together in unison. A strained single-layer of MoS2 has been investigated as a potential photo-catalyst for the generation of solar fuels and oxygen by the photoreduction of CO2 with H2O. All kinds of strains have been applied to calibrate the photocatalytic response of ML-MoS2 to strain and in turn, to ascertain the type and magnitude of strain and pH under which the photocatalytic response in ML-MoS2 is optimized. All factors governing the photocatalytic activity have been fully addressed in this work: optical absorbance and conductivity, suitable band edges, exciton binding energies, carrier mobilities and their anisotropy, and pH. The exciton binding energy for pristine monolayer MoS2 calculated in this work (0.41 eV) is in good agreement with the previous reports. The redshift in optical absorbance peaks with the application of tensile strain of both types, uniaxial and biaxial, agrees with the PL observed experimentally on monolayer MoS2 nanosheets. Calculated optical conductivity correctly reproduces all main features measured experimentally and calculated theoretically in earlier studies. Optical absorbance and conductivity show the same trend: the peak value rises with the application of 1–5% of uniaxial tensile strain, while it reaches its maximum at 3% strain. Shear strain of both types is found to be most effective in enhancing the optical conductivity and absorbance along the direction of lattice dilation. Compressive strain is found to attenuate optical absorbance and conductivity. 3–4% of shear strain of type-II is found to be most favorable for artificial photosynthesis in monolayer MoS2 nanosheets on account of the following reasons. The optical absorbance and conductivity are found to be maximally enhanced, while the exciton binding energies also remain desirably small under 3–4% shear strain of type II. Band edge positions in pristine ML-MoS2 nanosheets are found to be well suited for CO2 reduction with H2O and oxidation of water leading to the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, the band edges barely undergo any shift under the application of shear strain of both types, which is an additional advantage. Shear strain, in general, and shear strain of type II, in particular, bring about the highest enhancement in carrier mobility along with the carrier mobility ratio, which facilitates the charge separation and the migration of the separated e−–h+ pairs along opposite or transverse directions. As a result, the carrier lifetimes are prolonged; or, in other words, the carrier recombination rates are lowered. Nernst formulation is found to be beneficial in understanding the importance of adjusting the pH level for optimizing CO2 reduction with H2O and the oxygen evolution reaction. Acidic medium turns out to be most suitable for carrying out such a photoconversion. This work is important from both scientific and technological perspectives. It provides an in-depth insight into the science of photoconversion of CO2 with H2O and in the natural fixation of carbon.
