    , Accepted 26th August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractIn this study, we have grafted poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) brushes on GO sheets via a silylation reaction of the surfaces of GO sheets and a succeeding “click” reaction (GO(C)/P3HT composite). Compared with pure P3HT and the blend of P3HT and GO, the GO(C)/P3HT composite shows a red-shifted optical absorption maximum because of increased conjugation length of the grafted P3HT, which might be due to the crowding of the P3HT chains grafted on GO sheets. For comparison, P3HT chains were also grafted on GO sheets via the amidation reaction of the carboxylic acid groups (GO(A)/P3HT composite). However, the GO(A)/P3HT composite doesn't show a red shift in the UV-visible spectrum. The overall fluorescence quenching in the GO(C)/P3HT composite includes both dynamic quenching and forming a non-fluorescent ground-state complex. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results demonstrate that the efficiency of grafting P3HT on GO sheets via the “click” reaction approach is higher than via the amidation reaction approach. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations show that the GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets are much thicker than the GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets, due to the higher grafting efficiency of the “click” reaction approach. Therefore, this work opens a novel avenue to tuning the optical properties of conjugated polymers via surface grafting chemistry.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their wide applications in organic electronics such as polymer solar cells.1–4 To improve the performance of the devices, considerable work has been focused on optimizing the morphology of the active layers, controlling the phase separation between the electron-donating and electron-accepting components, and improving the ordered assembly of the two components in the active layers. To achieve these goals, various techniques such as thermal annealing,5 solvent treatment,6,7 and inclusion of additives8 have been employed.
Alternatively, the design of new conjugated polymers with increased ionization potentials and reduced optical gaps, which lead to enlarged open-circuit voltages and improved matching of the optical absorption with the solar spectrum, also turns out to be a potential way for high-efficiency solar cells. The optimization of conjugated polymer structures has focused on the engineering of conjugated backbones and polymer side chains. By changing the units of the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing portions, one can obtain various conjugated polymers that have narrow optical gaps, meaning increased efficiency of using sunlight and improved power conversion efficiency.8–11 Incorporation of conjugated side chains into conjugated backbones has been reported to increase the extent of conjugated regions so that the resultant polymers have broadened optical absorption.12–14 In addition, L. Dai et al.15 incorporated side chains into conjugated backbones using ethylene bridging units so as to ensure a coplanar configuration between the polymer backbone and the side chains, leading to highly crystalline narrow band-gap polymers. Most recently, Z. Bao et al.16 tuned the conjugated backbone twisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) derivatives by controlling the number and placement of alkyl side chains along the conjugated backbones. However, the engineering of conjugated backbones and polymer side chains requires molecular design, complicated synthesis, and costly investment, which retard the progress of the new conjugated polymers.
P3HT is a widely used conjugated polymer that has almost the simplest molecular structure among conjugated polymers and can be prepared through facile synthesis.17,18 Controlling the conformation of the backbones by an ordered assembly of P3HT provides an additional route to tuning the electronic and optical properties. A. Kiriy et al.19 densely grafted P3HT on silica particles. The crowding of the tethered P3HT makes the P3HT chains exist in a planarization conformation so that the grafted P3HT brushes exhibit strongly altered optical properties compared to the untethered counterparts. The work proposed a new approach to control the electronic and optical properties of the conjugated polymers. However, the silica particles used as anchoring surfaces in the study may function as traps in the process of exciton separation and charge transportation.
Graphene oxide (GO) has attracted great attention due to its exceptional properties.20 GO has shown wide applications in areas such as mechanical reinforcement,21,22 chiral liquid crystals,23 and organic photovoltaics because of its good dispersibility in a polymer matrix24 and the ability to accept and transport electrons in conjugated polymer composites.25–28 Recently, D. S. Yu et al.29 grafted P3HT chains on GO sheets via an esterification reaction between acyl-chloride functionalized GO and CH2OH-terminated P3HT, as well as formation of O–S(O)–O linkage by the activated hydroxyl groups and the CH2OH-terminated P3HT. In this study, we grafted P3HT brushes on GO sheets using a silylation reaction of the surfaces of GO sheets and a succeeding “click” reaction (Scheme 1a, the composite is denoted as GO(C)/P3HT). For comparison, P3HT was also grafted on GO sheets via the amidation reaction of carboxylic acid groups (Scheme 1b, the composite is denoted as GO(A)/P3HT). Comparative studies indicated that the GO(C)/P3HT composite shows properties that are quite different from the GO(A)/P3HT composite. In particular, the GO(C)/P3HT composite shows a red-shifted absorption maximum due to the high-density grafting of P3HT chains on GO sheets, indicating reduced optical bandgap. Therefore, this work provides a novel avenue to preparing electron-donating and electron-accepting composites with narrow bandgap via surface grafting chemistry.

Experimental
Synthesis of GO
The GO used in this study was synthesized by following a modified Hummers' method (see ESI S1†).30,31
Synthesis of amino- and ethynyl-terminated P3HT
Amino- and ethynyl-terminated P3HT was synthesized using the Grignard metathesis (GRIM) reaction.18 GRIM reaction is a universal method for the synthesis of conjugated polymers that have high regularity and narrow molecular weight distribution.17,32 In our study, amine and ethynyl groups were incorporated onto the ends of the polymers by ending the polymerization using proper Grignard reagents (see ESI S2†). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) characterization showed that the amino- and ethynyl-terminated P3HT has a number averaged molecular weight of ca. 3100. In order to improve the efficiency of grafting P3HT on GO sheets, we used P3HT samples that have a relatively lower molecular weight.
Synthesis of 3-azidopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)
APTMS was synthesized by following a modified procedure according to ref. 33 (Scheme 1a). Briefly, to a 50 mL Schlenk flask, 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane (1.5 mL, 8 mmol), sodium azide (1.1 g, 16 mmol), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (10 mL) were added. After the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 24 h, the solid in the reaction mixture was removed by filtration. The filtrate (ca. 0.8 M) was collected for the reaction of the next step. For NMR characterization, the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to get yellow oil as product. 1H NMR (CDCl3, δ, ppm, TMS): 3.57 (s, 9H, OCH3), 3.28 (m, 2H, SiCH2CH2CH2N3), 1.71 (m, 2H, SiCH2CH2CH2N3), 0.71 (m, 2H, SiCH2CH2CH2N3).
Synthesis of GO/APTMS composite
GO/APTMS composite was synthesized by taking advantage of the reaction between the alkoxy groups of APTMS and the hydroxyl and epoxide groups of GO sheets (Scheme 1a). In a typical reaction, GO (30 mg) was dispersed in DMF (20 mL) with the aid of sonication for 3 h. After that, the APTMS solution in DMF (ca. 1.5 mL) obtained in the proceeding step was added into the GO suspension, and the reaction was allowed to take place at room temperature for 36 h. Finally, the GO/APTMS composite was obtained by centrifuging at 17000 rpm for 1 h, followed by three cycles of dispersing the GO/APTMS composite in toluene and centrifugation.
Synthesis of GO(C)/P3HT composite
P3HT was grafted to the surfaces of GO sheets through the “click” reaction between the azido groups and the ethynyl groups on the ends of P3HT chains (Scheme 1a). In a typical reaction, into a 50 mL Schlenk flask, copper(I) iodide (40 mg), dry N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (80 mg), and anhydrous DMF (10 mL) were added. After becoming yellow-colored under stirring, the mixture was transferred into an ethynyl-terminated P3HT (100 mg) solution in anhydrous THF (60 mL). After the mixture was further stirred for 20 min, a GO/APTMS composite (10 mg) dispersion in anhydrous THF (10 mL) was transferred into the mixture, followed by stirring at 50 °C for 48 h to carry out the “click” reaction.
After the reaction mixture was slowly cooled down to room temperature, the catalyst was first removed by decanting the supernatant. Then the product was obtained by centrifugation at 17000 rpm for 1.5 h. After that, the solid was further cleaned with three cycles of washing in THF with sonication for 3 min and centrifugation. Finally, the GO(C)/P3HT composite was dried under vacuum overnight.
Synthesis of GO(A)/P3HT composite
GO(A)/P3HT composite was synthesized by making use of the amidation reaction of the carboxylic acid groups on GO sheets with the amino-terminated P3HT (Scheme 1b). First, GO sheets were chloridized using SOCl2 in DMF. In a typical reaction, GO (10 mg) was dispersed in DMF (1.5 mL) with the aid of sonication. To the GO dispersion, SOCl2 (20 mL) was added, and the solution was refluxed at 70 °C for ca. 36 h. The product was obtained by centrifugation, and further cleaned by washing with anhydrous THF and centrifugation for 5 cycles.
To carry out the amidation reaction, the chloridized GO dispersion in anhydrous THF (10 mL) was added into an amino-terminated P3HT (100 mg) solution in anhydrous THF (60 mL). After that, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and anhydrous triethylamine (2 mL) was added dropwise into the reaction flask. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 50 °C for 36 h. Finally, the product was obtained by centrifugation at 17000 rpm for ca. 2 h, followed by repeated washing with anhydrous THF and centrifugation for 5 cycles.

Results and discussion
GO is a material of a complex chemical structure with hydroxyl, epoxide, and carboxylic acid groups. Generally, it is believed that the hydroxyl and epoxide groups are on the basal planes, while the carboxylic acid groups are on the edges of the GO sheets and the inner circumferences of the holes on GO sheets.34 However, the exact location of the carboxylic acid groups is not clear. Scheme 1 shows that P3HT brushes were grafted on GO sheets via (1) a “click” reaction approach, which takes advantage of the silylation reaction of the surfaces of GO sheets and a succeeding “click” reaction (Scheme 1a), and (2) an amidation approach, which makes use of the amidation reaction of the carboxylic acid groups on GO sheets (Scheme 1b). In this study, we pursued the optimized synthesis conditions for both grafting approaches so that the maximum grafting efficiencies for the two grafting approaches were obtained. The GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT represent the composites with maximum grafting densities of P3HT on GO sheets for both synthesis approaches except noted otherwise. The details of the preparation of GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites and the distinctive properties of the two composites are discussed below.
APTMS was obtained from the nucleophilic substitution reaction between 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane and sodium azide in DMF (Scheme 1a). The reaction could be quantitively controlled using excessive loading of sodium azide. Since only 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane and the APTMS were soluble in DMF, by-product and the excessive sodium azide could be easily removed by filtration. The complete conversion of 3-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane to APTMS could be confirmed with 1H NMR spectra: 3.28 ppm for CH2N3vs. 3.57 ppm for CH2Cl.
APTMS was grafted on the surfaces of GO sheets through the silylation reaction of GO sheets with APTMS in DMF (Scheme 1a). The reaction was monitored with FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1). GO sheets show a FT-IR spectrum (the solid line) containing a broad and intensive peak from ca. 3000 to 3650 cm−1, which is a peak characteristic of hydroxyl groups. On the other hand, GO/APTMS composite shows a spectrum (the short-dash line) containing two new feature peaks at 2934 and 2122 cm−1, which are attributed to the stretching vibration of C–H bonds and N3 groups. This result indicates that a monolayer of APTMS has formed on the surfaces of GO sheets.

P3HT was grafted on GO sheets using the “click” reaction, Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, between the azide groups and the ethynyl groups of the ethynyl-terminated P3HT (Scheme 1a). Recently, there were a few reports that grafted unconjugated polymers on GO sheets via “click” reactions.35–37 The FT-IR spectrum of ethynyl-terminated P3HT contains two characteristic peaks at 3310 and 2095 cm−1 (the dash-dot line in Fig. 1), which are due to the stretching vibration of C–H bonds and CC bonds. In contrast, the characteristic peaks for the ethynyl groups disappeared in the spectrum of GO(C)/P3HT composite (the dash line in Fig. 1), indicating that the unreacted P3HT could be completely removed from the GO(C)/P3HT composite during the separation. However, a trace of the peak at 2122 cm−1 could still be detected, indicating some N3 groups were left on the GO sheets after the “click” reaction. Furthermore, as compared to the GO/APTMS composite, the GO(C)/P3HT composite exhibits a stronger peak at ca. 2900 cm−1 due to the greater quantity of hexyl groups on the P3HT chains. These results indicate that P3HT chains are covalently linked on the surfaces of GO sheets.
For comparison, P3HT chains were also grafted on GO sheets using the amidation reaction between the carboxylic acid groups of GO and the amino groups of amino-terminated P3HT (Scheme 1b). In Fig. 2 are displayed the FT-IR spectra of GO, amino-terminated P3HT, and the GO(A)/P3HT composite. Amino-terminated P3HT shows a spectrum (the dash-dot-dot line) containing two characteristic peaks at 3466 and 3381 cm−1, which corresponds to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of N–H bonds for the terminal amine groups of P3HT. As expected, the GO(A)/P3HT composite shows a spectrum containing a characteristic peak at ca. 2900 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of C–H bonds. This result indicates that the P3HT chains have been grafted to GO sheets. It is noteworthy that the FT-IR peaks at ca. 2900 cm−1 in the spectrum of the GO(A)/P3HT composite is much weaker than that of the GO(C)/P3HT composite. This might be due to higher efficiency of grafting P3HT chains on GO sheets via the “click” reaction approach than via the amidation reaction approach. In addition to the FT-IR results, NMR data also support the covalent bonding of P3HT chains and GO sheets for both GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites (see ESI S4†).

The thermal stability and composition of GO, ethynyl- and amino-terminated P3HT, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 3). The differential TGA (DTGA) curves of these samples are available in ESI S5.† It can be seen that GO undergoes dramatic mass loss (30.9%) from 124 to 212 °C due to the decomposition of oxygen-containing groups such as carbolic acid, hydroxyl, and epoxide groups (the solid line in Fig. 3 and Fig. S7a†), and that the ethynyl- and amino-terminated P3HT samples show dramatic mass losses (68.3% and 71.3%) from 360 to 500 °C (the dash-dot and dash-dot-dot lines in Fig. 3 and Fig. S7b and d†). As a result, the TGA curves of GO(C)/P3HT composite (the dash line) and GO(A)/P3HT composite (the dot line) show two significant mass losses at the low temperature area and the high temperature area, which correspond to the decomposition of the oxygen-containing groups of GO and the P3HT component, respectively. Furthermore, the P3HT component in the GO(C)/P3HT composite loses mass in a wider temperature area (from 366 to 680 °C), which includes two mass loss peaks in the DTGA curve (Fig. S7c†), than that in the GO(A)/P3HT composite (from 377 to 516 °C) (Fig. S7e†). These results might be because of the different thermal stabilities of the bonding moieties that link the P3HT chains to GO sheets. The GO component in the GO(C)/P3HT composite loses mass at higher temperatures (from 115 to 199 °C) than in the GO(A)/P3HT composite (from 98 to 169 °C) (Fig. S7c and e†). Also, the functional groups left behind the grafting reactions on the GO sheets lead to different thermal stabilities of the GO components in the GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites.
 Fig. 3  TGA curves of GO, ethynyl- and amino-terminated P3HT, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites. 
It is noteworthy that the mass loss ascribed to P3HT for the GO(C)/P3HT composite (41.7%) is much greater than that of the GO(A)/P3HT composite (5.7%). This result shows that the content of P3HT component in the GO(C)/P3HT composite is greater than in the GO(A)/P3HT composite, indicating that the efficiency of grafting P3HT on GO sheets via the “click” reaction approach is higher than via the amidation reaction approach. Roughly calculated from the mass losses, the grafting efficiency of the “click” reaction approach is more than seven times higher than that of the amidation reaction approach, due to the higher quantity of the hydroxyl and epoxide groups than the carboxylic acid groups on GO sheets and the high yield feature of the “click” reaction.38,39
In order to estimate the efficiency of grafting P3HT for the “click” reaction approach, as a model composite, the GO/APTMS composite was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (see ESI S6†). The results show that the contents of C, N, and Si in the GO/APTMS composite are 70.6, 3.62, and 0.9%, respectively. One can see that the atomic ratio of N to Si is ca. 4, which is close to the theoretical value 3. According to the content of Si in the composite, the efficiency of the silylation reaction, which grafted APTMS on the surfaces of the GO sheets, can be calculated as ca. 1 APTMS molecule per 75 C atoms of the GO sheets. Considering that the “click” reaction proceeds in high yield without any side products in many solvents,38,39 one can roughly estimate the efficiency of grafting P3HT brushes on GO sheets for the “click” reaction approach.

Fig. 4 displays the survey XPS curves of GO, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites. GO shows a XPS curve containing two dominant peaks at 284 and 531 eV, which correspond to C 1s and O 1s. In contrast, the GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites yield XPS curves that contain two new peaks at 227 and 163 eV corresponding to S 2s and S 2p, respectively, indicating that P3HT are successfully grafted to GO sheets. In addition, it can be seen that the peaks of S 2s and S 2p in the GO(C)/P3HT composite are stronger than in the GO(A)/P3HT composite, indicating higher content of P3HT in the GO(C)/P3HT composite than in the GO(A)/P3HT composite. This result is in agreement with the TGA result that the efficiency of grafting P3HT on GO sheets via the “click” reaction approach is higher than via the amidation reaction approach.
 Fig. 4  Survey XPS of GO, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites. 
Moreover, it can also be seen from the XPS curves that the GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites contain a lower content of oxygen than GO does (Fig. 4): the atomic ratios of O to C are 0.48, 0.27, and 0.15 for GO, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites. The composition of the composites was further investigated using C 1s XPS (see ESI S7†). It is seen that the peak corresponding to C–O species is markedly decreased in the C 1s XPS of GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites as compared to that of GO. Meanwhile, two new peaks corresponding to C–S and C–N species appear in the spectra of the two composites, along with a new peak corresponding to N–CO species appearing in the spectrum of GO(A)/P3HT composite. These results are due to the partial reduction of GO, which might be caused by thermal reduction or photoreduction,40–43 and the covalent incorporation of P3HT, which carries no oxygen.
Raman spectra were also used to characterize the interactions between GO sheets and P3HT brushes (Fig. 5). GO sheets yield a Raman spectrum containing an intensive G band (1599 cm−1), along with an intensive D band (1349 cm−1) corresponding to the sp3 amorphous carbon generated by the oxidation. P3HT yields a Raman spectrum containing two sharp peaks at 1448 and 1379 cm−1, which are assigned to the C–C skeletal stretching vibration and the CC skeletal stretching vibration, respectively.44,45 As expected, the GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites show both the feature peaks of GO and P3HT, with GO's bands being stronger in the GO(A)/P3HT composite than in the GO(C)/P3HT composite. The Raman band at ca. 1370 cm−1 in the spectra of GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites is high-frequency shifted with respect to the D band of GO. This is due to the electron transfer between P3HT and GO, and the overlapping of GO's D band and P3HT's C–C skeletal stretching vibration.44
 Fig. 5  Raman spectra of GO, P3HT, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites. 
Furthermore, it can be seen that the Raman band of the CC skeletal stretching vibration for the GO(C)/P3HT composite is high-frequency shifted with respect to that of P3HT (1453 cm−1), whereas this Raman band for the GO(A)/P3HT composite is low-frequency shifted (1442 cm−1). The shifts of the Raman band of the CC skeletal stretching vibration for GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites to opposite directions might be due to the different impacts that the GO sheets impose on the grafted P3HT brushes through the different bonding moieties.

Fig. 6 shows the optical images of P3HT solution, GO suspension, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composite suspensions in THF. P3HT yields a stable orange solution in THF (bottle a). GO suspension in THF can only be stable temporarily (bottle b), with precipitate observed hours after sonication. In contrast, the suspensions of GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites in THF are more stable (bottle c and d), indicative of the solubilization effect of P3HT on GO. This result is consistent with previous reports,29 as well as the solubilization effect of P3HT on other carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes.46,47 Compared with the orange colour of P3HT solution, the GO(C)/P3HT composite yields a red-purple suspension, whereas the suspension of GO(A)/P3HT composite is black. Moreover, the chemically reduced samples of both GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites are also dispersible in THF (see ESI S8†).

The spectral properties of the GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites were further investigated using UV-visible and PL spectroscopy. Fig. 7a displays the optical absorption spectra of P3HT solution, GO, a GO/P3HT blend, the GO(C)/P3HT composite, and the GO(A)/P3HT composite suspensions in THF. A GO suspension doesn't show any feature absorption in the wavelength range displayed (the solid line). The spectrum of the P3HT solution (0.02 mg mL−1) contains a characteristic absorption maximum at 441 nm that corresponds to the electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymer (the dash-dot-dot line). The GO/P3HT blend suspension exhibits an absorption maximum at 437 nm (the short dash line), which is 4 nm blue shifted relative to that of the pure P3HT. Such blue shift is contributed to the π–π interactions between GO sheets and P3HT. In contrast, the absorption maximum of the GO(C)/P3HT composite suspension appears at 449 nm (the dash line), which is 8 nm red shifted relative to that of the pure P3HT and 12 nm red shifted relative to that of the GO/P3HT blend. The red shift of the absorption maximum means reduced bandgap of the P3HT brushes grafted on the surfaces of the GO sheets. The shifts of the absorption maximum to opposite directions for the GO(C)/P3HT composite and the GO/P3HT blend might be due to different arrangement ways of the P3HT chains on the GO sheets: the P3HT chains are parallel attached on the surfaces of the GO sheets in the GO/P3HT blend due to the π–π interactions, whereas the P3HT brushes are grafted on the surfaces of the GO sheets through the ends of the P3HT chains in the GO(C)/P3HT composite. The crowding of the P3HT chains grafted on GO sheets may play an important role in facilitating the planarization of the backbones,19 leading to a red shift of the optical absorption maximum of the P3HT in the GO(C)/P3HT composite. This is in agreement with recent reports that conjugated polymers grafted on silica beads show a red-shifted absorption maximum due to the increased conjugation length of the conjugated polymers.19,48 Furthermore, the extent of the red shift for the GO(C)/P3HT composite can be tuned by controlling the grafting density of P3HT brushes on GO sheets: the extent of the red shift decreases with decreasing the grafting density of P3HT (see ESI S9†). This result is well in agreement with the proposed crowding induced planarization of the backbones. On the other hand, with significantly enhanced background, the spectrum of the GO(A)/P3HT composite suspension does not show the absorption maximum of P3HT (the dot line). This might be due to the low content of the P3HT component in the composite (5.7% mass loss in the TGA, Fig. 3) so that the absorption of P3HT has been concealed by the strong scattering of the GO sheets in the composite.30

The PL spectrum of P3HT solution (0.02 mg mL−1) contains an emission maximum at 567 nm (the dash-dot-dot line), which corresponds to the transition of the excited electrons from the LUMO to the HOMO of the polymer. As expected, both the GO(C)/P3HT composite and the GO(A)/P3HT composite suspensions give PL spectra (the dash and the dot lines) that contain reduced emission due to the photoelectron transfer from P3HT to GO. The reduced emission of the GO(C)/P3HT composite appears at 571 nm, which is 4 nm red shifted relative to that of the pure P3HT. In agreement with the results from UV-visible spectroscopy, the red shift of the PL emission for the P3HT in GO(C)/P3HT composite also supports the increased conjugation length of P3HT chains. On the other hand, the emission of P3HT in the PL spectrum of the GO(A)/P3HT composite has completely been quenched by GO because of the high content of GO component in the composite (TGA, Fig. 3).
To further investigate the photoelectron transfer behaviour in the GO(C)/P3HT composite, the PL lifetime of the pure P3HT and the GO(C)/P3HT composite was measured (see ESI S10†). When applying a monoexponential fit for the PL decay profiles, the pure P3HT in THF was found to have a lifetime of 528 ps, and the P3HT brushes grafted on GO sheets showed faster PL decay with a lifetime of 470 ps. This result indicates the photoelectron transfer from P3HT to GO in the composite, in agreement with the photoelectron transfer between conjugated polymers and other carbon materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).49,50 However, the absolute difference in the lifetimes between pure P3HT and the GO(C)/P3HT composite (τ0/τ = 528/470 = 1.12; τ0 and τ are the lifetimes of pure P3HT and the P3HT brushes grafted on GO sheets) does not agree well with the steady-state quenching factor of 1.35 (I0/I = 7543/5599 = 1.35; I0 and I are the steady-state fluorescence intensities for P3HT and the GO(C)/P3HT composite).51 Since only the dynamic quenching is responsible for the shortening of the PL lifetime, the overall PL quenching in the GO(C)/P3HT composite might be a combination of dynamic quenching and forming a non-fluorescent ground-state complex. Forming a non-fluorescent ground-state complex was previously found to be the major mechanism in the photophysical process for the composites of P3HT and SWNTs.46
The morphology of GO sheets, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composites were studied using AFM and TEM. Fig. 8a displays the AFM image of GO sheets coated on a mica surface. It can be seen that the GO sheets have a size ranging from microns to submicrons. Cross-section analysis shows that the GO sheets are ca. 1 nm thick, indicative of a single-layered feature.30 This thickness is greater than the value (0.34 nm) of the idealistic graphene sheets due to the oxygen-containing groups such as carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, and epoxide groups on the edges and surfaces of GO sheets.30Fig. 8b displays the AFM image of a P3HT film, which shows whisker structures of P3HT crystals. Fig. 8c displays the image of GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets. They have a similar size as the GO sheets, but are much thicker than the GO sheets. Cross-section analysis shows that the GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets are ca. 7.0 nm thick due to the grafted P3HT. In contrast, the GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets are a lot thinner than the GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets: ca. 4.2 nm for the former vs. ca. 7.0 nm for the latter. This differences obviously result from the different grafting efficiencies of the two grafting approaches: the grafting efficiency of the “click” reaction approach is higher than that of the amidation reaction approach. The higher quantity of the hydroxyl and epoxide groups than the carboxylic acid groups on the GO sheets may facilitate obtaining thicker GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets.

Fig. 9 displays the TEM images of a P3HT film, GO sheets, GO(C)/P3HT and GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets. P3HT exhibits a uniform film that is composed of P3HT whisker crystals (Fig. 9a), which supports the observation on AFM (Fig. 8b). In this study, the P3HT shows clear whisker crystals because of the relatively lower molecular weight of the samples used. Fig. 9b displays a TEM image of GO sheets. It can be seen that the GO film comprises smooth and thin GO sheets that have a size ranging from submicron to microns and irregular shapes. Overlapping and folding of the GO sheets may occur. For GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets (Fig. 9c), it can be seen that there are polymer-like material attached on the surfaces of the GO sheets, leading to a much higher contrast than the GO sheets. In contrast, the single-layered areas of the GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets (Fig. 9d) show smooth surfaces with a lower contrast than the GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets, indicating that the GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets are thinner than the GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets. Therefore, the TEM results also support the fact that GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets are thicker than GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets.

Conclusions
We have prepared GO/P3HT composites via two approaches: (1) silylation reaction of the surfaces GO sheets and a succeeding “click” reactions, and (2) amidation reaction of the carboxylic acid groups on GO sheets. The grafting efficiency of the “click” reaction approach is much higher than that of the amidation reaction approach because of the greater quantity of hydroxyl and epoxide groups than the carboxylic acid groups on GO sheets. As a result, there is a higher content of P3HT in the GO(C)/P3HT composite than in the GO(A)/P3HT composite, leading to thicker GO(C)/P3HT composite sheets than the GO(A)/P3HT composite sheets. In particular, the GO(C)/P3HT composite shows a red-shifted optical absorption maximum with respect to the pure P3HT and the GO/P3HT blend, due to the increased conjugation length of P3HT backbones. In addition, the photoelectron transfer process included in the GO(C)/P3HT composite may comprise of both dynamic quenching and forming a non-fluorescent ground-state complex. We expect that this work can open a new avenue to tuning the optical properties of conjugated polymer via simple surface grafting chemistry of graphene and widen the application of the GO/conjugated polymer composites in areas such as photoelectronics.
