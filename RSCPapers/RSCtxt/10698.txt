    , Accepted 23rd December 2020First published on 28th December 2020AbstractThree Fe(II) pyridylNHC-carboxylic heteroleptic complexes with (ARM7 and ARM11) or without spacers (ARM13) between the pyridine and the COOH anchoring group have been designed and characterized with the aim to increase the metal to surface charge separation and avoid undesired recombination processes in iron-sensitized DSCCs. The ARM13-sensitized DSSC scored the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron-sensitized solar cell (1.44%) providing that Mg2+ cations and NBu4I were present in the electrolyte, thus substantially boosting the photocurrent. The gain in efficiency derived from the use of MgI2-based electrolytes was rationalized by employing DFT calculations for the isolated dye sensitizers and dye/TiO2 interface models.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells are one of the prominent and less expensive alternatives to conventional silicon based solar cells.1–3 Since the first breakthrough achieved by Grätzel and co-workers with more than 10% efficiency by utilizing the classical ruthenium complex N3 and its doubly deprotonated analogue N719,4 numerous sensitizers have been developed by replacing one of the dicarboxybipyridine from N3 with 4,4′-functionalized bipyridines for improved light harvesting as well as device stability.5–11 To date, the highest efficiency of 13% has been achieved by the Grätzel group using panchromatic dyes with cobalt based electrolytes.12 The large device efficiencies achieved by Ru(II) complexes have been ascribed to the long lifetime of their metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) lowest excited states (which is in the order of a few ns) and the efficient electron–hole pair separation induced by their particular absorption geometry, which hampers the charge recombination processes at the dye/semiconductor interface.13–15 However, the large-scale production of these ruthenium complexes is jeopardized by their high cost, tricky purification, and environmental issues.
Given the scarcity of ruthenium, researchers have focussed their attention on moving to low-cost earth abundant first row transition metal complexes as sensitizers16,17 or metal-free organic sensitizers.18–20 The first-row transition metal sensitizer Fe(dcbpy)2(CN)2 (F2CA) was first introduced by Ferrere and Gregg.21,22 Its poor efficiency in the DSSC was recently improved by McCusker and co-workers reporting 0.35% efficiency using the F2CA complex by optimizing the electrolyte composition.23 In general, in order to obtain high quantum injection yields, the MLCT excited state lifetime should be orders of magnitude larger with respect to the injection rates. For this reason, iron(II) polypyridyl sensitizers are inefficient for solar cell applications due to their too short lived MLCT excited state lifetimes (100 fs)24 arising from ultrafast deactivation by population of the low lying metal-centred (MC) states thus annihilating the suitable photophysical properties. Notable advances have been recently reported by our group and others using pyridyl-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC), due to the increase in the ligand donor strength, which stabilizes the MLCT states with respect to the MC ones.25–31 This strategy has allowed iron complexes to achieve MLCT state lifetimes up to the picosecond28,32–34 and nanosecond35 scales. One illustrative example of these NHC dyes is the iron complex C1 (Fig. 1) which combines s-donating NHC ligands (showing MLCT lifetimes up to 16 ps) with p-accepting carboxylic groups for grafting to the TiO2 surface.26 Despite its relatively long lifetime, however, C1 displayed very poor photovoltaic performances that were shown to be linked to the fast recombination of the oxidized dye with the electrolyte36 and to a low injection efficiency due to the wrong direction of the charge flow in the lowest MLCT states of the homoleptic compounds.30Ab initio calculations of the C1/TiO2 electronic structure and of interfacial electron injection rates, indeed, revealed that once anchored on the TiO2 substrate, the lowest-energy MLCT state promotes charge transfer from the metal to the unanchored NHC ligand, thus resulting in a quenched electron injection. A rather tilted adsorption geometry of the dye on the semiconductor, yielding a close distance between the surface and the oxidized dye, also suggested possible fast back recombination reactions.30 These findings clearly gave us two fundamental guidelines in the search for higher-efficiency iron-based sensitizers: moving to heteroleptic complexes to guarantee the desired dye-to-TiO2 electron flow and possibly increasing the distance between the oxidized metal centre and the TiO2 substrate to slow down back recombination processes. Very recently, however, some of us reported that C1-based DSSC efficiency can be boosted up to 1% by means of Mg2+ cations in the electrolyte,36 with a remarkable increase in the photocurrent value from 0.4 to 3.3 mA cm−2. This indicated that Mg2+ cations, capable of adsorbing at the molecule/semiconductor interface, even though reducing the Voc by downshifting the TiO2 conducting band (CB), can notably improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics (regeneration and/or electron injection), resulting in higher measured photocurrents.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of Fe(II) NHC complexes studied in this work; the counterion is PF6− in every case. 
With this knowledge in hand, here we report three heteroleptic complexes (Fig. 1): one of them is the heteroleptic analogue of C1 (ARM13) and the other two have a thiophene (ARM7) and phenyl (ARM11) spacer between the pyridine and the COOH anchoring group, inserted with the aim of increasing the distance between the TiO2 surface and the iron centre and improving, at the same time, the light harvesting capabilities. By combining different experimental and computational techniques, here we report the synthesis of these new Fe-complexes, characterize their optical and redox properties, and investigate their photovoltaic performances when employed in DSSCs. Notably we obtained the best power conversion efficiency of 1.44% for the heteroleptic ARM13 complex which is the highest efficiency ever reported for an iron complex sensitized solar cell. Both the gain in efficiency derived from the use of MgI2-based electrolytes and the loss in efficiency introduced by the conjugated spacers in the dye structure were rationalized by employing DFT calculations of the isolated dye sensitizers and dye/TiO2 interface models. The results presented here clearly provide important design rules to engineer the chemical structure of iron complexes for solar cell applications, where the use of aromatic bridges should be combined with electron donating and acceptor groups in order to avoid local π–π* excitations which are detrimental for obtaining an adequate charge separation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and methods
The starting materials and reagents were commercially available and used as received. ARM13 was prepared according to ref. 30. Solvents were purified by standard procedures and purged with argon before use. All other chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and were used without further purification until or unless stated, and all reactions were performed under an inert atmosphere of argon. Chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh). 1H (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were obtained on a DRX400 Bruker spectrometer at ambient temperature. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were obtained by using a Bruker micrOTOF-Q spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell on a LAMBDA 1050 (Perkin Elmer) spectrophotometer.
Electrochemical data for complexes in solution were obtained using a Radiometer PST006 potentiostat. A single-compartment cell was used with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, glassy carbon as the working electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M NBu4PF6 in dry acetonitrile. Solutions containing ca. 2 × 10−3 M analyte were degassed by purging with nitrogen. All E1/2 values were calculated from (Epa + Epc)/2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and referenced to Fc/Fc+. All potentials were quoted versus SCE.

2.3. Cell fabrication
The FTO slides for electrode fabrication were cleaned by sequential ultra-sonication in Alconox®/water and 2-propanol for 10 min each. After drying at room temperature (RT) the resulting slides were heated at 450 °C for 20 min to remove residual organic contaminants. The blocking underlayer was fabricated by spin coating (10 s at 1000 rpm followed by 20 s at 2000 rpm) a 0.3 M titanium tetraisopropoxide solution in 1-butanol followed by heating at 500 °C for 15 min. Ca. 16 μm thick transparent TiO2 was obtained by repeating the blade casting of 18NR-T paste twice according to the classical scotch tape method. Each casting was followed by a sintering process in an oven according to the following temperature program: 25–120 °C (10 min), 120–450 °C (30 min), 450 °C (20 min), 450–500 °C (10 min), 500 °C (10 min). Cooling at RT was accomplished by removing the electrodes from the oven and storing them at RT in a desiccator. TiCl4 treatment was performed by drop casting a 0.4 M aqueous TiCl4 solution on top of the TiO2 film followed by overnight hydrolysis at room temperature in a closed case. Later, after removing the excess TiCl4 solution by rinsing with deionized water, a final annealing stage was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. After optimizing the dye adsorption process, the following conditions were deemed to be the best for optimal light harvesting: C1 and ARM13 were chemisorbed on a TiO2 film by using 0.2 mM dye/0.04 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) acetonitrile baths; ARM7 and of ARM11 were chemisorbed from a more concentrated 0.5 mM acetonitrile solution in the absence of CDCA. N 719 was adsorbed from 0.2 mM ethanolic baths.
0.25 cm2 electrocatalytic PEDOT films for use as counter electrodes were fabricated by potentiodynamic electro-polymerization on the FTO surface delimited by surlyn 25 masks. EDOT electropolymerization occurred between the working (FTO) and counter electrode (Ti sheet, 4 cm2) facing each other at a distance of ca. 3 mm by exploiting 2 potential sweeps in cyclic voltammetry mode (0–1.6 V vs. SCE at 50 mV s−1) in an electrolyte made of 10−2 M EDOT in 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. Cells were prepared in an open configuration using surlyn 25 as a spacer. Redox electrolytes were prepared according to the following formulation: electrolyte 2 (el2): 0.1 M LI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M MgI2, and 0.1 M GuNCS in acetonitrile (ACN). A further formulation conceived for enhancing photocurrent was named electrolyte 3 (el3) and consisted of 0.1 M LI, 0.6 M PMII, 0.1 M I2, 0.1 M MgI2, 0.1 M GuNCS, and 0.1 M TBAI in acetonitrile.
2.4. Characterization of dye-sensitized electrodes and DSSCs
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the Fe(II)NHC-sensitized films used as working electrodes was carried out with a PGSTAT 302N potentiostat at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in acetonitrile/0.1 M LiClO4 solution, using a three electrode cell with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a double jacketed SCE as a reference. SEM imaging of the anatase mesoporous films was carried out at the Department of Physics in the University of Trento with a JEOL JSM-7001F FEG-SEM. Surface morphology images were acquired in top-down and tilted mode whereas cross sectional analysis was performed by placing the films on a 90° stub. The absorption spectra of the Fe(II)NHC sensitized electrodes were obtained in transmission mode with an Agilent Cary 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. These spectra were collected against the background constituted by an otherwise identical TiO2 film supported on FTO.
Nanosecond laser experiments on Fe(II)NHC sensitized TiO2 films were performed with previously described spectrometric apparatus.36 In the μs-s region, the laser energy was adjusted to 500 μJ per cm2 per pulse by acting on the Q switch and laser power supply and by interposing various optical elements to defocus and attenuate the beam in order to achieve a homogeneous excitation of the whole sensitized surface in the optical path of the monochromatic probe beam. Various oscilloscope input impedances were used to amplify the S/N of the trace (from 50 ohm to 1 M ohm) in a given temporal window and each oscillographic trace was averaged over ca. 100 laser shots at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Experiments carried out at the maximum time resolution of our spectrometer (FWHM ca. 7 ns) were conducted with a 10 mJ per cm2 per pulse to obtain a better S/N ratio without pre-amplification. Sensitized TiO2 films supported on FTO were held at 45° degrees with respect to both the excitation and probe beam to reflect the scattered laser away from the detector. The electrolyte could fill the gap between the mesoporous film and a microscope slide pressed against it by capillarity.
Photo-electrochemical experiments were performed with a PGSTAT 302N potentiostat equipped with an Abet sun simulator (AM 1.5G filter) setting the lamp irradiance at 0.1 W cm−2. The JV curves were collected in cyclic voltammetry mode by linear sweeping an applied potential at 20 mV s−1 from 0 V to slightly larger potentials than the measured Voc of each cell. The IPCE spectra were obtained with custom made apparatus composed of a Xe lamp (Ceralux CL300BF) source focused into the entrance slit of a motorized Newport Cornerstone monochromator coupled to an optical fibre to provide monochromatic illumination of the sandwich solar cell. Incident irradiance, recorded with a calibrated silicon photodiode, and the photocurrent output of the cell, collected under short circuit conditions, were acquired via a National Instruments PXI 1033 system. To avoid collecting an excess of scattered light into the solar cell photoactive layer, cells were framed with a black tape mask having an active area of 0.25 cm2. The APCE spectra were obtained according to APCE = IPCE/LHE where LHE (λ) = 1–10−A(λ) was computed using the absorbance (A(λ)) of each sensitized TiO2 film in contact with the blank electrolyte. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were obtained with a PGSTAT 302N potentiostat by applying a 10 mV perturbation in the 105 to 10−1 Hz range to solar cells under dark conditions and probing the forward potential region from the onset of the dark current onwards.
2.5. Computational details

Isolated dye molecules. 
Theoretical calculations were performed at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level, within the modified B3LYP* functional (with a 15% Hartree–Fock exchange–correlation fraction) and 6-311G(d) basis set. We chose this functional since it has been tuned to properly describe the optical properties of Fe(II) complexes,37 and its success has largely been documented in the literature.38–40 The implicit effect of the methanol solvent environment was considered by employing the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM).41 In all cases, we have considered the dye complexes in their low spin (singlet) state in view of their larger stability with respect to the high spin (triplet and quintet) configurations. For instance, the low spin ground state (GS) energy of C1 was found to be 1.76 and 1.57 eV more stable compared to the same energy in its triplet and quintet spin states, respectively. The ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) has been estimated here as minus the Kohn–Sham (KS) energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in solution. The approximate method to obtain an experimental estimate of the excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) is to subtract the adiabatic lowest excitation energy (E0–0) from the GSOP. Here we compare these experimental estimates with our calculated ESOPs obtained as ESOP = GSOP − Emax, where Emax is the maximum of the calculated absorption band. This approximation will provide slightly overestimated ESOPs, but we expect that the trend within the series of Fe complexes will be reliably reproduced. The ground state (GS) geometries of the considered dyes were fully optimized and, in the Frank–Condon approximation, the vertical excitation energies were calculated by means of Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The simulated absorption spectra were built by convoluting the 50 lowest energy vertical transitions with the Gaussian function of half-width at full-length of 0.17 eV. The character of the MLCT transitions has been analysed on the basis of the transition density matrices performed by using the TheoDORE package.42 All sets of calculations for the isolated dyes were carried out within the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.43


TiO2@dye cluster models. 
The optimized GS structure of the C1 and ARM-13 dyes was adsorbed in a bidentate fashion, after having transferred the carboxylic proton to one surface oxygen, to a (TiO2)82 cluster having dimensions of about 2 × 2 nm. This cluster model was obtained by exposing the anatase bulk phase to the (101) surface and it has been successfully employed to reproduce the dye@TiO2 opto-electronic properties in previous work.44,45 Despite the fact that this model was initially tested to reproduce the correct TiO2 band edge and relative dye-semiconductor energy levels46 by employing the standard B3LYP functional, the calculated interfacial energetics is very similar for both B3LYP and B3LYP* functionals (see the calculation for C1 in Fig. S17†). We will thus safely rely on the B3LYP* results for our discussion. The optimized C1@TiO2 and ARM13@TiO2 geometries were obtained by performing DFT calculations with the Perdew–Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, COnductor-like Screening MOde (COSMO) solvation model,47 and D2 Grimme's dispersion correction48 for treating the van der Waals interactions, as they have been implemented in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package.49 In addition, Double/Triple Zeta Polarized (DZP/TZP) basis sets were used for C, N, H, S, O, Mg/Fe, and Ti atoms, respectively. To rationalize the effect of the MgI2 electrolyte on the dye/TiO2 interface properties, we studied the C1@Mg-TiO2 and ARM13@Mg-TiO2 systems by placing the Mg2+ cation between two O atoms of the TiO2 surface close to the dye and following the procedure detailed above for the geometry optimization. For the sake of consistency with the isolated dye calculations, the electronic structure of the dye@TiO2 system was calculated using the same level of theory (functional, basis set and solvent environment description) as the one described in the previous section. Even though the photovoltaic properties were measured in an acetonitrile solvent, a methanol solvent was used as the continuum medium for both relaxation and electronic structure calculations. In spite of this, in a continuum-medium description, the results will be almost identical for both solvent environments in view of their similar dielectric constants (ε = 32.613 for methanol and ε = 35.688 for acetonitrile).
The interface charge injection properties were estimated by following the diabatic-like scheme developed by Thoss and co-workers.50 Within this method, the diabatic couplings are calculated by resorting to a Fermi golden rule framework, where the charge injection rates kinj are calculated as follows:  here kinj represents the sum over the manifold of k TiO2 acceptor states of interest, whereas d is the dye donor state, |Vdk|2 is the square of the coupling elements, ρ(εk) is the semiconductor partial density of states (DOS), and their product |Vdk|2ρ(εk) defines the so-called probability distribution Γ(εk). The diabatic states for donor (dye) and acceptor (TiO2) moieties were extracted by the localization of the MOs of the entire complex into the donor and acceptor species, thus ending up in a Fock matrix where the diagonal elements display the energies of the localized states, while the off-diagonal blocks include the coupling elements Vkd. In the final step, the corresponding hole/electron injection rates were calculating by applying the formula:  
It is important to highlight that although all previous work involving dye@TiO2 diabatic analysis was conducted with the B3LYP functional,44,45 our results obtained with B3LYP* are comparable to those obtained with the B3LYP (see Fig. S18 and S19 and Table S1†).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic routes followed to prepare the complexes are presented in Scheme 1. The ligand precursors L1 and L2 were obtained in good yields via a Suzuki cross-coupling between the bromo pyridine 2 and the appropriate arylboronic acids. The target complexes where finally obtained by reaction of the appropriate ligands (L1, L2, L3 (ref. 22) and L4 (ref. 26)) with FeCl2 in the presence of t-BuOK as the base.

All the complexes displayed three distinct absorption bands. The band at higher energy (250–330 nm) is assigned to π–π* transition, while the two other bands, in the lower energy region, correspond to the Fe–carbene MLCT transitions (340–420 nm) and Fe–pyridine MLCT transitions (420–600 nm). Passing from the homoleptic C1 complex to the heteroleptic ARM13, the lowest-energy MLCT band is blue-shifted (0.16 eV) and less intense (from 18582 to 12375 M−1 cm−1), whereas, as expected, ARM7 (thiophene linker) and ARM11 (phenyl linker) show increased higher molar extinction coefficients with respect to ARM13 thanks to extended π-conjugation. In particular, the thiophene tethered complex presents a higher and red-shifted absorption band (λmax = 499 nm, ε = 16719 M−1 cm−1) with respect to the phenyl tethered analogous (λmax = 479 nm, ε = 15306 M−1 cm−1 for ARM11).
TD-DFT calculations were carried out to precisely characterize the nature and topology of the MLCT absorption bands (Table 1), responsible for electron injection into the TiO2 when employed in DSCCs. The computed spectra for the four systems are plotted in the top panel of Fig. 2. As reported in previous work for NHC-Fe(II) systems,26,28,32,51,52 the calculated spectra are slightly blue-shifted (up to 0.24 eV in the case of C1) with respect to the experimental ones, but the trend within the series is accurately reproduced. The overall differences in the absorption features between the studied dyes are, indeed, captured: the increase in the absorption intensities in ARM11 and ARM7 with respect to ARM13 due to the increase in conjugation and the red-shift of C1 compared to its heteroleptic homologue, ARM13. The composition of the main excitation of the MLCT bands is reported in Table 1, while the associated natural transition orbitals are shown in Fig. S20 in the ESI.† Interestingly, the lowest energy transitions (H → L) are dark for all dyes (see Table S2†), and the main MLCT transitions, composing the lowest-energy band, involve HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 and LUMO levels (note that for C1 the LUMO and L+1 levels are degenerated due to the presence of two carboxylic groups).
The oxidation potentials of all the complexes were obtained by cyclic voltammetry performed in acetonitrile and the potential values against the SCE are plotted in Fig. 3, where the conduction band edge of TiO2 and the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte are also reported. As it is apparent, the introduction of a thiophene (ARM7: 0.74 V vs. SCE) or phenyl (ARM11: 0.70 V vs. SCE) spacer reduces the oxidation potentials with respect to the ones measured for ARM13 and C1 (0.82 and 0.85 V vs. SCE, respectively). This is most likely due to the extension of π-conjugation arising from thiophene and phenyl linkers. The GSOP of the dyes are, for all the systems, sufficiently more positive than the I−/I3− redox potential, indicating that the electron transfer by the redox pair to regenerate the oxidized dye is thermodynamically favoured. The ESOPs, calculated as the difference between GSOPs and the adiabatic excitation energy (E0−0) estimated from the absorption edge, are, on the other hand, sufficiently more negative than the potential of the TiO2 conduction band to have efficient electron injection.
 Fig. 3  Schematic energy levels vs. SCE of C1, ARM13, ARM11 and ARM7 as estimated by means of absorption and electrochemical measurements (black) and DFT/TDDFT calculations (red). The TiO2 conduction band minimum (CBM) and the potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte are also plotted. 
As is apparent in Table S3 in the ESI† and Fig. 3, the calculated redox levels are close, although slightly overestimated, to the experimental ones and, more importantly, provide the correct trend within the series of compounds, thus validating the employed level of theory for reproducing the electronic structure of the sensitizers in solution.
The thermodynamic properties relevant to cell operation, namely the ground and excited state oxidation potentials, were also assessed on the sensitized films, to include the perturbation to the dye electronic levels exerted by the interaction with the semiconductor surface. Cyclic voltammetry of the sensitized films immersed in 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile (Fig. S27†) reveals quasi-reversible Fe(II)/Fe(III) oxidation processes characterized by ΔE ≈ 100 mV for all the complexes, indicative of fast electron transfer kinetics. The E1/2 potential found in the series of complexes under investigation shows only a mild variation in moving from ARM7 to ARM13, suggesting that the ligand environment stabilizes the highest occupied orbitals, which in these complexes have a prevailing metal dπ contribution, in a similar fashion. ARM7, ARM11 and ARM13 exhibit E1/2 values of 560 mV, 550 mV and 600 mV, respectively. Compared to the data obtained for the same complexes in solution, we observe a systematic cathodic shift of the order of 100–150 mV, which may be explained by the decreased back bonding caused by the deprotonation of the carboxylic group upon binding of the complexes to the TiO2 surface. We also observe that the relative positioning of the E1/2 potentials is, within the series of heteroleptic complexes, qualitatively consistent with the trend observed in solution where ARM13 exhibits the strongest anodic potential probably due to the stronger electron withdrawing effect caused by the carboxylic group directly attached to the NHC ligand. The cathodic shift of the ground state potentials makes the excited state of the dyes loaded on titania slightly better reductants than in solution. By using the onset of the absorption spectrum of the sensitized thin film we obtain  equal to −1.49 V for ARM7, −1.62 V for ARM11 and −1.57 V for ARM13, making injection into the TiO2 acceptor states of titania exergonic by at least −0.9 eV, if we consider the positioning of the TiO2 flat band potential at ca. −0.7 V vs. SCE in organic solvents containing lithium cations.53
3.3. Steady state and transient absorption spectroscopy of sensitized thin films
In order to optimize the light harvesting, at least at wavelengths resonant with the MLCT maximum of the Fe(II)NHC dyes, we have prepared relatively thick titania films by repeated casting and annealing of a commercial terpineol based anatase paste (Greatcell Solar 18 NRT). The cross-sectional analysis of these photoanodes (Fig. S28†) confirms their nanocrystalline nature, showing a homogeneous network of nanoparticles having an approximate size of ca. 20 nm (Fig. S29†) which extends for a thickness of about 17 μm. Underneath the porous network, which allows electrolyte permeation, one can observe the presence of the compact TiO2 blocking underlayer (BUL) which serves as a means of improving the adhesion of the porous layer to the ohmic contact and to insulate the electron collector from recombination reactions involving the electrolyte and the exposed surface of FTO.
The absorption spectra of sensitized BUL-TiO2 electrodes, measured in transmittance mode against an identical undyed TiO2/FTO, are shown in Fig. 2, together with the absorption spectrum of N719 (black line) taken as a reference. All the Fe(NHC) complexes show an intense MLCT band between 480 and 500 nm, followed by a weaker band at ca. 400 nm. The light harvesting efficiency is larger than 90% for all the Fe(NHC) complexes under investigation, with the best efficiency found for ARM7 and C1, which couple maximum absorbance ≥2 to spectral extension which, in the case of ARM7 bearing a conjugated thiophene linker, extends to 650 nm in agreement with the computational and spectroscopic results in fluid solution. Despite the improvement in light harvesting of the new designs, N719 still displays the best red responsivity, with two MLCT bands covering most of the visible spectrum and extending beyond 700 nm. From A (λ) = 1000 Γ ε(λ), where A is the electrode absorbance measured in transmission mode and Γ and ε(λ) are the surface concentration (mol cm−2) and the extinction coefficient (M−1 cm−1), it is possible to estimate the coverage of the dyes, which were all found to be very similar, in the order of 0.12 ± 0.10 μmol cm−2, confirming that the lower absorbance of the ARM13 sensitized film is related to its lower extinction coefficient.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) in the ns-ms time scale was next used to gain information about recombination and regeneration kinetics in Fe(II) sensitized TiO2 electrodes. In Fig. 4, the transient difference spectra of ARM7@TiO2, ARM11@TiO2 and ARM13@TiO2 in contact with 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN, generated upon 532 nm laser excitation, are displayed.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption spectra recorded for ARM7 (a), ARM11 (b) and ARM13 (c) with 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN. Input impedance is 350 ohms. 
All spectra share common features, consistent with the formation, within the instrumental response function (300 ns with a 350 Ω pre-amplifying impedance), of the charge separated state consisting in the formation of Fe(III)/e− (TiO2) pairs. The main spectral signatures of the charge separated state are summarized by the intense bleaching of the MLCT ground state absorption centred at ca. 500 nm, an isosbestic point at ca. 570 nm, followed by a weaker flat absorption extending from ca. 600 nm to 750 nm, assigned to mixed contribution from photoinjected electrons and LMCT transition to the photogenerated Fe(III). All these features appear to undergo basically no evolution in the 100 μs time window selected and are consistent with the previous results reported for the structurally related C1 dye.36 This indicates that injection occurs within the instrumental time response and that recombination occurs slowly, being largely incomplete after ca. 80 μs after the excitation. The ground state bleaching of all dyes is red shifted (ca. 10–20 nm, depending on the dye) with respect to the ground state absorption recorded in Fig. 2 relative to the dry TiO2 films in contact with air and agrees with the respective ground state absorption bands observed when these films are in contact with the Li+ and Mg2+ containing electrolytes (Fig. S30†), owing to a stark shift induced by surface adsorption of high charge density cations.36,54
In the presence of inert electrolyte 3 (deprived of the iodine/iodide couple), the complete recovery of the charge separated states of all Fe(II) dyes, whose initial amplitude, observed at 500 nm, is in the order of 7 mΔOD, occurs by electron recombination in a time window which extends up to 0.2 s under a laser pulse fluence of 500 μJ per cm2 per pulse (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  500 nm recombination kinetics of the Fe(III)/e−(TiO2) charge separated state probed at 500 nm with blank electrolyte 3 (deprived of iodine/iodide). The kinetics were constructed by joining traces recorded within different time windows, spanning the 10 μs to 2 ms interval (10 kOhm amplifier impedance) and 2–200 ms (1 Mohm amplifier). ARM7 (red line), ARM11 (blue line), ARM13 (green line) and C1 (purple line) are compared. 
These kinetics follow a stretched exponential function, according to eqn (1),55 and span from ns to ms, originating from an energy distribution of semiconductor/electrolyte states from which recombination occurs according to an ample range of different rate constants. (1)
For all the species, the exponential parameter c is in the 0.34–0.54 range as reported in the literature. The fitting revealed lifetimes of 2.7 ms, 7.1 ms, 2.0 ms and 2.3 ms for ARM7, ARM11, ARM13 and C1, respectively; thus krec sits in the 10−3 to 10−2 s−1 range. The decay was also analysed by considering the 650 nm absorption, finding consistent results with the bleaching recovery, and confirming the identical origin of both bleach and long wavelength absorption (Fig. S31†).
When iodide was present (Fig. 6) (electrolyte 3 without I2) a fast recovery of the bleach in the 10−6 to 10−5 s interval was observed which is largely confined in the instrumental response function when the 10 kOhm pre-amplifier was used, indicating that regeneration of the dye occurred with nearly quantitative efficiency.
 Fig. 6  Positive absorption at 500 nm due to the Stark effect, as a consequence of Fe(II) regeneration inside the laser pulse for ARM7 (red line), ARM11 (blue line), ARM13 (green line) and C1 (purple line). Electrolyte 3 (without I2). 
The long lived stationary absorption that followed the bleach is indeed consistent with the Stark effect, as a result of charging of the semiconductor films with electrons, which are no longer compensated by Fe(III) centres at the interface. As reported in our previous paper,36 all the transient spectra are indeed characterized by Stark features (Fig. S32†) which blue shift the ground state absorption of the dye and become dominant in the ms to s time scale and result in a broad absorption around 500 nm, stronger in C1 and weaker with the ARM13, ARM7 and ARM11.
The appearance of a Stark absorption after the bleach recovery confirms that most of the Fe(II) regeneration kinetics occur within a time scale of 3 μs, setting a lower limit of the regeneration time constant in the order 3.3 × 105 s−1. This value, compared with a recombination rate which is from a hundred to a thousand times slower would make the regeneration efficiency (ηreg) of Fe(II) by the electrolyte practically quantitative. In order to evaluate the competition between recombination and regeneration at early time scales (ns-sub μs range) we have conducted measurements at the best time resolution of our spectrometer (50 Ω) which results in an instrumental Gaussian response function having a FWHM of ca. 7 ns and a base of ca. 20 ns. Under these conditions the obtaining of traces with a good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) requires higher energy density, which we set to 10 mJ per cm−2 per pulse. Since Fe(III) recovery by recombination is highly non mono-exponential and was less than 50% complete within the first 500 ns, causing troubles with the fit reliability, we used as an empiric pseudo-first order time constant, the time at half amplitude of the decay (τ1/2)56 and we decoupled recombination and regeneration time constants according to kreg = kapp − krec(2)where kapp = 1/τ1/2app and krec = 1/τ1/2rec are computed from the time constants observed in the presence of the iodide couple (electrolyte 2 and 3 deprived of iodine) and with the inert electrolyte, respectively (Fig. S33(a) and (b)†). Under these conditions, we extracted a kinetic constant of the order of 1.5 × 107 s−1 which leads to a regeneration efficiency of 81%. We thus conclude that the ca. 200 mV driving force displayed by the Fe(II)/(III) couple in these complexes allows achieving a nearly quantitative regeneration efficiency, which by combining the estimates at long and at short time scales we can judge to be in the order of 80–90%. It is interesting to try to address the effect of high charge density cations in the electrolyte, since a large improvement in energy conversion performance was reported36 compared to earlier work.26 Although ns spectroscopy does not allow resolving the charge injection dynamics, we found that injection occurs within the instrumental time response of our spectrometer at its best time resolution (kinj > 1.5 × 108 s−1) with an initial amplitude of the charge separated state (Fe(III)/e-(TiO2)) which was found to be doubled in the presence of 0.1 M Li+/0.1 M Mg2+ (Fig. S34†) consistent with a larger fraction of excited dye which undergoes injection on ultrafast time scales. This observation is consistent with the ca. 400 mV positive shift in the TiO2 density of states revealed by cyclic voltammetry in an inert electrolyte composed of 0.6 M PMIOTf/0.1 M TBAPF6/0.1 M GuNCS (Fig. S35†). In the CV experiments we also observe a large increase in film conductivity which manifests in ca. 4-fold increase in the current associated with TiO2 electroactivity thanks to the charge compensating capabilities of Li+ and Mg2+. These were reported to increase the ambipolar electron diffusion coefficient in mesoporous TiO2 films, favouring charge collection.57 However, such an effect, while beneficial in increasing cell performance, cannot influence the magnitude of the population of charge separated states observed at early time scales.
3.4. Photovoltaic properties
The performance of sensitized TiO2 electrodes using an Mg2+ containing electrolyte formulation, herein named el2 in ACN solution, that was previously successfully tested with the homoleptic C1 dye has been screened.36 Average current–voltage curves under light and dark conditions, obtained on a set of 5 cells equipped with PEDOT coated counter electrodes, are shown in Fig. 7(a). The resulting efficiency parameters with their error are listed in Table 2.

First, we can observe that with el2 in ACN, the performances of ARM13, C1 and ARM7 are quite aligned around photocurrent densities varying between 3.5 mA cm−2 and 4 mA cm−2, with a fairly good reproducibility (<10% fluctuation) while the Voc is around 0.45 V. In more detail, ARM7 achieved a maximum PCE% of 0.94% with Jsc = 3.55 mA cm−2, Voc = 440 mV and FF = 60, whereas ARM11 achieved 0.78% efficiency with Jsc = 2.69 mA cm−2, Voc = 460 mV and FF = 63. The best PCE% of 1.2% was recorded for ARM13 which displayed the best combination of photocurrent (3.95 mA cm−2), photovoltage (0.49 V) and FF (61%). Notably ARM13 shows the lowest dark current which explains the best Voc among this series. The reference homoleptic complex C1 performs as expected, just slightly better than previously reported, probably due to the better harvesting associated with the use of thicker titania films, recording 1% efficiency. Despite its lower light harvesting ARM13 performs surprisingly well compared to C1 and, based on their similarity in regeneration efficiency and excited state energetics, we may hypothesize that ARM13 exhibits better electronic coupling for charge injection motivated by its asymmetric design. Under identical conditions N719 exhibited a higher efficiency of 3.57% due to its higher current density (12.8 mA cm−2) associated with a Voc of ca. 0.5 V. The larger voltage observed with N719 can be generally ascribed to its higher photocurrent, as placing neutral filters to reduce the irradiance to set the Jsc to ca. 4 mA cm−2 gave a Voc comparable to those recorded with the Fe(II) dyes.
The use of transparent Pt coated counter electrodes resulted, with the best performing dyes of the Fe(II)NHC series, in enhanced performance that we assigned to partial light reflection from the more reflective FTO/Pt electrodes with respect to the blue velvet like PEDOT films. For ARM13, the photocurrent density increased from 3.95 mA cm−2 (PEDOT/FTO counter electrode) to 4.26 mA (Pt/FTO) and from 3.64 mA cm−2 to 4.02 mA cm−2 for C1, while Voc remained essentially unchanged. Overall the PCE% increased to 1.29% and 1.14% for ARM13 and C1, respectively (Fig. 7(b)).
With the Pt counter electrode, the use of a TiO2 scattering layer (Fig. S36†) further improved the photocurrent, allowing us to more efficiently catch light which is backscattered from the cathode, resulting in a 4.72 mA cm−2 and 5.12 mA cm−2Jsc for ARM13 and C1. This further modification of the TiO2 unfortunately translates to a reduction of the Voc, which leads to a PCE% which is practically unchanged with respect to that of transparent cells without the scattering overlayer. However, with the same configuration, having optimized light management, N719 achieved about 18 mA cm−2, with a decreased Voc of 0.46 V (Fig. S36†) indicating that a strong dissipative process is acting within the Fe(II)NHC sensitized cells. Thus, we considered the reasons behind the lower performance of the Fe(II)NHC with respect to the Ru(II) standard. As Fe(II) regeneration efficiencies were found to be satisfactory with values at least >80%, we considered other losses originating from the recombination of TiO2 electrons with I3−. Such kind of recombination kinetics, probed by EIS (Fig. S37–S41† for Nyquist plots) in the dark at various forward voltages, revealed that the total cell resistance (RTOT = RΩ + RCT, where RΩ is the constant contact resistance (20–25 Ω) and RCT is the charge transfer resistance ascribed to recombination with I3− at the TiO2/electrolyte interface) varied according to N719 < ARM7 < ARM11 ≈ ARM13 ≈ C1. As shown in Fig. S42,† the major differences are observed at the threshold of the dark current process (i.e. ca. −0.3 V), while the dark response of all sensitized electrodes in contact with el2 becomes quite aligned when the applied bias becomes more negative than −0.4 V. These measurements, performed in complete cells, under applied bias provide a more reliable means of estimating the recombination resistance than the spectroscopic observation of electrons in an electrically insulated electrode, like in our previous work,36 and show that the recombination between TiO2 electrons and I3− in the el2 formulation is not a critical issue with respect to N719. This, combined with the ηreg values from TAS, indicates that the main kinetic limitation of the new Fe(II)NHC sensitizers may still reside in charge injection, partly competitive with excited state deactivation processes. We further observe that injection is possible also in the absence of high charge density cations, consistent with the strong reducing capabilities of these Fe(II)NHC excited states and with previously discussed TA measurements, but the resulting IPCE is reduced to ca. 5–6%, associated with a maximum photocurrent density of 0.54 mA cm−2 (Fig. S43†). To address this point more specifically, the IPCE spectra of all Fe(II) dyes are shown in Fig. 8(a): generally these exhibit a photocurrent action spectrum which agrees with their absorption spectrum when in contact with a Li+ and Mg2+ containing electrolyte which causes a bathochromic shift of the absorption, as previously discussed. This is also direct experimental evidence of the interaction of these cations with the sensitized TiO2 surface. As expected, all dyes show their maximum conversion corresponding to their main visible MLCT band which extends from 450 up to 700 nm and peaks around 500–520 nm, decreasing then sharply when moving to the red, becoming almost negligible at λ > 650 nm. The maximum IPCE values range between 30% (ARM11) and 40% (ARM13). Consistent with the J/V results, the relatively broad and higher IPCE of ARM13 provides the best photocurrent density under AM 1.5 G illumination. APCE = Φinjηreg reaches, in the best cases (ARM13 and C1), the 40% plateau (Fig. 8(b)) which, coupled to an estimate for ηreg of 85 ± 5% affords (assuming an IPCE error of the order of 1%) a quantum yield of charge injection of 47 ± 4%, which agrees with the previously reported value around 50% for the C1 dye.36

The tendency to diverge at low λ is generated by errors in a proper estimation of the optical density of the electrode when the absorbance decreases sharply from the maximum around 500 nm. 
We have found for all dyes (Fig. S41†) a slight improvement in the power conversion efficiencies when using el3 (obtained by adding 0.1 M TBAI to the electrolyte 2). With this electrolyte, the dye which benefited the most was ARM13, whose IPCE and APCE exceeded 40% (Fig. S42†) corresponding to a photocurrent of 4.44 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9(a)) which, coupled to a FF of 64% led to a 1.27% PCE. With the same electrolyte the standards C1 and N719 increased from 1.03% to 1.11% and from 3.57% to 3.68%, respectively.

(b) ARM13 sensitized solar cell equipped with a Pt coated FTO counter electrode in the presence of el3 under AM 1.5 illumination (solid lines) and in the dark (dashed lines). 
When using a partly reflective platinum coated counter electrode, the ARM13 photocurrent increased further to 4.98 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9(b)) which is mainly responsible for the enhancement at a 1.44% power conversion efficiency (Table 3). This PCE value represents, to the best of our knowledge, the highest efficiency so far recorded with Fe(II) sensitizers in a DSSC.

The role of TBAI is still not fully understood. With Fe(II) sensitizers we could not observe a reduced recombination from the dark currents when in the presence of TBAI, contrary to what we recorded, and it is reported with N719 (Fig. S43†), while the transient kinetics (Fig. S33(a) and (b)†) did not reveal, even at our best time resolution, an increased regeneration efficiency. The JV curves suggest that overall cell resistance is reduced when TBAI is present and such an effect could arise from a reduced resistance either at the TiO2/electrolyte interface or in the diffusional resistance of the electrolyte. A detailed EIS investigation is currently underway to elucidate this point.
3.5. Computational analysis
Here we will try to rationalise the photovoltaic performances of the investigated dyes relying on DFT and TD-DFT calculations of the isolated and TiO2-grafted systems, focusing our attention on the photocurrent generation. To sum up, we have a homoleptic dye, C1, that, thanks to the presence of Mg2+ cations in the electrolyte, can inject photoexcited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band, yielding photocurrents only slightly lower than the ones of its heteroleptic analogue, ARM13. On the other hand, ARM13, despite exhibiting the worst optoelectronic properties among the series (weaker absorption at shorter wavelengths), shows the highest efficiency and the highest photocurrent values. Concerning the effect of the conjugated spacer, surprisingly both the heteroleptic dyes, ARM11 and ARM7, even with the correct dye-to-TiO2 charge transfer directionality and good light harvesting properties (Fig. 2), underperform compared to ARM13 and even C1. Finally, with reference to the nature of the conjugated spacer, the recorded photocurrents (ARM7 > ARM11, Table 3) seem to be coherent with the red-shifted absorption spectrum of the thiophene-substituted compound (ARM7). The questions that we need to answer are, therefore, (i) what is the effect of Mg2+ at the C1@TiO2 interface that allows electron injection? (ii) Can the presence of Mg2+ also justify the higher photocurrent value recorded for ARM13-based DSSCs, despite its quite low and slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum (Fig. 2)? (iii) Why, despite their superior optical properties, do the spacer-substituted complexes show lower electron injection efficiencies than ARM13?

Effect of MgI2 electrolyte. 
Following a computational approach similar to the one used by some of us to model the effect of Li+ cations at the indoline D102-TiO2 interface,58 we have simulated the adsorption of a Mg2+ cation at the C1@TiO2 and ARM13@TiO2 interfaces and analysed the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. We are aware that a realistic model of the dye/TiO2 interfaces should include several cations adsorbed on the surface at different positions. Nevertheless, as has been shown for Li+ (ref. 58) and H+ (ref. 59) cations adsorbed on the (TiO2)82, there is an almost linear effect as the number of positive charges increases on the energy shift of the TiO2 CB and dye's LUMO levels, as well as on the gain in the injection rates. Thus, since our main target is to examine the qualitative impact of the cation on the dye@TiO2 electronic structure, we limit ourselves to a single cation model, stably interacting close to the dye's anchoring group.58
As is apparent in Fig. 10 for the C1 dye, the Mg2+ cation lies close to three oxygens of the TiO2 surface in a hollow fashion (distances to the nearest neighbour O atoms of TiO2 of about 2.0 Å, 2.5 Å and 2.4 Å), as well as to one of the anchoring O atoms of the dye (Mg–O distance of 2.3 Å). As shown by the Projected Density of States (PDOS) plots in Fig. 11, the main energetic effect of the presence of the cation at the surface is the expected negative shift for all the unoccupied interfacial energy levels in both C1 and ARM13-sensitized TiO2. A deeper look at the localization of the frontier MOs depicted in Fig. 12, however, reveals that the adsorption of Mg cations on the semiconductor surface in proximity to the dye induces a striking and more pertinent consequence for C1 (top panels in Fig. 11).
 Fig. 10  Optimized structure of the C1@Mg-TiO2 system; a zoomed-in image of the Mg2+ cation (green colored atom) and its closest O neighbor atoms is displayed in the inset of the perspective view as well.

For visualisation purposes, only the vertical bars of the dye's PDOS are represented here and the TiO2 DOS intensity has been divided by a factor of 10. The isodensity plots (isovalue 0.02 a.u.) of the dye unoccupied MOs indicated by the grey arrows are displayed in the insets of the PDOS plots. 
 Fig. 12  Electron Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) in ARM13, ARM11 and ARM7 with the percentages of delocalization for each fragment. The colours employed to plot the isodensities correspond to the unbound pyridylNHC ligand and iron (orange), anchoring ligand: pyridylNHC (purple), spacer (green) and carboxylic group (red) moieties. The isovalue used for this plot was 0.03 a.u. 
In C1@TiO2, indeed, as we know, the dye's LUMO is localized in the unbound ligand with essentially no electronic coupling with the semiconductor CB states (99% localization on the dye): the metal-to-ligand charge transfer goes in the opposite direction with respect to TiO2 and electron injection is impeded. This is a consequence of the destabilization of the CT toward the deprotonated-anchored ligand. When the Mg cation is present at the interface, on the other hand, its localized positive charge in proximity to the anchoring unit stabilizes the CT toward the surface-adsorbed ligand, where the dye's LUMO is now localized (Fig. 11): the lowest-energy bright MLCT transition recovers the correct directionality and electron injection is now possible, thus explaining the measured photocurrents. On the other hand, the shape and relative energies for the highest occupied levels of the dyes remain very similar upon Mg2+ adsorption, since their localization on the top and central part of the dye, far from the surface, significantly weakens their interaction with the cation (see Fig. S21 and S22†).
To obtain a more quantitative picture, we calculated the diabatic couplings between the levels of the dyes and the ones of the TiO2 slab, with the aim of evaluating how the Mg2+ cation affects the interfacial electron transfer kinetics (injection/recombination times). The diabatic energy levels for the dye's frontier molecular orbitals and TiO2 conduction and valence bands are reported in Table S4,† while the diabatic electronic couplings are plotted in Fig. S23–S26 in the ESI.† The results relative to the electron injection process, by considering the electronic coupling for both the LUMO/LUMO+1 and the CB states are gathered in Table 4 for the C1@TiO2, C1@Mg-TiO2, ARM13@TiO2 and ARM13@Mg-TiO2 systems, while the data for the recombination between the injected electrons (TiO2 VB) and the oxidized dye (HOMO/HOMO−1/HOMO−2) are listed in Table S5 in the ESI.† It is important to stress that the electron transfer efficiency results from the interplay of two factors, the extent of the electronic coupling between the donor's and the acceptor's states and the density of available acceptor's (TiO2) states; their product gives the probability distribution Γ(ε), that, evaluated at the energy of the donor state, provides the injection rates. The injection times of 4.6 and 3.9 fs (Table 4) calculated for the LUMO+1 and LUMO in C1@TiO2 and C1@Mg-TiO2, respectively, clearly show the recovery of the correct CT direction in the homoleptic complex when Mg2+ is at the interface and the possibility of injecting electrons from the LUMO, as indicated by the increased amplitude of the charge separate state (dye(+)-TiO2(−)) in Fig. S34† and the consequent increase in the IPCE spectra, discussed above. Moreover, the sizeable increase in the electronic coupling between the LUMO and the surface localized TiO2 CB edge state (Fig. S23 and S25 in ESI†) largely compensates for the detrimental shift of the dye's LUMO at lower energies, yielding a decrease of TiO2 empty acceptor states (second and fourth panels in Fig. 11 starting from the top). Similar considerations apply for ARM13, for which an increase in the injection probability ΓL is calculated when Mg2+ is at the interface and the injection time decreases from 4.3 to 3.7 fs. Notably our predicted interfacial electron injection kinetics perfectly match the photocurrent values recorded for C1 and ARM13 (Table 2), indicating slightly superior injection efficiency for the heteroleptic complex, despite its inferior light harvesting capability (Fig. 2). Regarding the recombination rates, as shown by the data in Table S5 and Fig. S24 and S26 in the ESI,† the addition of Mg2+ is translated to a slight increase in the couplings of TiO2 the highest occupied levels of the dye. Nevertheless, this increase is not so significant to expect a big change in the recombination rates and the device efficiencies.

Effect of the conjugated spacer. 
A fast and reliable way to estimate the electron injection capability of a dye sensitizer is by looking at the extent of localization of the LUMO on the anchoring COOH unit.59 Nevertheless, a qualitative evaluation of the spatial localization of holes and electrons in the lowest-energy bright MLCT transitions as it appears in the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) depicted in Fig. S20,† although capable of providing a rough idea, is not sufficient.
A more quantitative and accurate analysis of the charge and hole localization characterizing the lowest bright excited state has been obtained here by employing the transition density matrix manipulation tools implemented in TheoDORE.42 The calculated percentages are reported in Fig. 12. The relevant data here are the percentages of electrons localized on the anchoring moiety (COOH): 16.3%, 8.3% and 6.7% for ARM13, ARM7 and ARM11, respectively. These values directly correlate with the corresponding measured photocurrents of 3.95 (ARM13), 3.55 (ARM7) and 2.69 mA cm−2 (ARM11) reported in Table 2. It is now evident that, despite inducing an overall improvement of the optical properties, the introduction of a conjugated thiophene or phenyl spacer results in a markedly decreased CT toward the anchoring group, with reduced injection efficiencies.58
Although the presence of Mg2+ cations at the dye/TiO2 interface will increase the localization on the anchoring unit and thus the coupling with the CB states as shown for ARM13, we do not expect a differential effect within the series and thus a change in the order of the predicted photocurrents.

4. Conclusion
This work represents an important step forward in the development of more efficient iron–carbene dye sensitizers: we report here a record power conversion efficiency of 1.44%, never recorded for a Fe-sensitized DSSC. This is the successful result of the knowledge we acquired in the last few years on the chemical design rules required to improve the dye-to-TiO2 electron injection,30 as well as on the optimization of electrolyte composition and cell fabrication.36 In our previous studies, indeed, we showed that even if the homoleptic Fe–carbene complex, C1, does not possess the correct charge transfer direction in its lowest-energy excited state, the use of the MgI2 electrolyte can notably improve the interfacial charge generation, increasing the overall power conversion efficiency from 0.13% (ref. 30) to 1%.36 Here, we therefore moved to the design of heteroleptic complexes, for which the lowest-energy MLCT state has the desired topology and we used Mg2+-based electrolytes with the aim of further improving the photovoltaic performances. More specifically, we have prepared three heteroleptic complexes: ARM13, being the analogue of C1, ARM11 and ARM7, having, respectively, a thiophene and a phenyl spacer between the iron centre and the carboxylic anchoring group, introduced to increase the metal to surface charge separation and avoid undesired recombination processes. We also included in the series the original homoleptic complex, C1,30,36 which served as a reference to interpret the effects induced by the structural changes.
We obtained power conversion efficiencies in the order ARM13 > C1 > ARM7 > ARM11, with a record value of 1.44% for ARM13. By comparing recombination and regeneration kinetics we obtained a ηreg close to 80–90% that, combined with APCE%, revealed the main limitation in charge injection due to a competition with the excited state deactivation that occurs in the sub ns range, while the dark current is quite comparable with that of some of the best Ru(II) reference dyes.
Based on the computational modelling of the C1/ARM13@TiO2 interface and accurate calculations of the electron injection/recombination kinetics we show that the presence of Mg2+ cations adsorbed at the dye/TiO2 interface stabilizes the CT toward the surface-adsorbed carbene ligand allowing for a quite efficient electron injection in the case of the homoleptic complex C1 and for an improved injection rate in the case of the heteroleptic ARM-13. Moreover, concerning the effect of the conjugated spacer, despite a larger absorption in the UV-Vis region and similar energetic alignments with respect to ARM13, the ARM7 and ARM11 yielded lower device performances. The reason behind this phenomenon is the local π–π* character of the MLCT excitations introduced by the aromatic spacers, which significantly lowers the charge separation within the dye and the injection of electrons into the semiconductor.
Here we demonstrate that, combining a rational molecular design, driven by reliable quantum chemical simulations, with accurate experimental characterization of the efficiency of the interfacial electron transfer processes, allowing for electrolyte and device optimization, one can effectively boost the performances of iron-based DSSCs.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures of Fe(II) NHC complexes studied in this work; the counterion is PF6− in every case.	 

 		 

 		 

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis of ligand precursors and complexes.	 

 	Fig. 2  Calculated (top panel), recorded in methanol (middle panel) and recorded for the sensitized TiO2 (bottom panel) MLCT absorption bands for C1 (purple), ARM13 (green), ARM7 (red) and ARM11 (blue). For the sake of comparison, the absorption spectrum of N719-sensitized TiO2 (black) is also displayed.	 



C1
	507 (18582)	551	496	463 (0.309)	H−2 → L+1 (45.4%), H−1 → L (45.1%)

ARM13
	475 (12375)	528	478	461 (0.148)	H−2 → L (63.4%)

ARM11
	478 (15306)	541	481	454 (0.271)	H−1 → L (64.4%)

ARM7
	499 (16725)	551	502	487 (0.371)	H−1 → L (67.1%)

 	Fig. 3  Schematic energy levels vs. SCE of C1, ARM13, ARM11 and ARM7 as estimated by means of absorption and electrochemical measurements (black) and DFT/TDDFT calculations (red). The TiO2 conduction band minimum (CBM) and the potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte are also plotted.	 

 	Fig. 4  Transient absorption spectra recorded for ARM7 (a), ARM11 (b) and ARM13 (c) with 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN. Input impedance is 350 ohms.	 

 	Fig. 5  500 nm recombination kinetics of the Fe(III)/e−(TiO2) charge separated state probed at 500 nm with blank electrolyte 3 (deprived of iodine/iodide). The kinetics were constructed by joining traces recorded within different time windows, spanning the 10 μs to 2 ms interval (10 kOhm amplifier impedance) and 2–200 ms (1 Mohm amplifier). ARM7 (red line), ARM11 (blue line), ARM13 (green line) and C1 (purple line) are compared.

 	Fig. 8  (a), IPCE spectra obtained with el2 in Fe(II)NHC sensitized cells. (b), APCE curves obtained from Fig. 1. The tendency to diverge at low λ is generated by errors in a proper estimation of the optical density of the electrode when the absorbance decreases sharply from the maximum around 500 nm.

 	Fig. 10  Optimized structure of the C1@Mg-TiO2 system; a zoomed-in image of the Mg2+ cation (green colored atom) and its closest O neighbor atoms is displayed in the inset of the perspective view as well.	 

 	Fig. 11  Projected Density of States (PDOS) of the C1@TiO2/C1@Mg-TiO2 (top) and ARM-13@TiO2/ARM-13@Mg-TiO2 (bottom) systems over the atoms belonging to the dye (red), TiO2 surface (blue) and Mg2+ cation (magenta) as calculated by Mulliken population analysis. For visualisation purposes, only the vertical bars of the dye's PDOS are represented here and the TiO2 DOS intensity has been divided by a factor of 10. The isodensity plots (isovalue 0.02 a.u.) of the dye unoccupied MOs indicated by the grey arrows are displayed in the insets of the PDOS plots.	 

 	Fig. 12  Electron Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) in ARM13, ARM11 and ARM7 with the percentages of delocalization for each fragment. The colours employed to plot the isodensities correspond to the unbound pyridylNHC ligand and iron (orange), anchoring ligand: pyridylNHC (purple), spacer (green) and carboxylic group (red) moieties. The isovalue used for this plot was 0.03 a.u.
