1 Introduction
Since its discovery and utilization, electricity has become an indispensable energy source in human society. With the increasing demand for electricity, traditional fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and other non-renewable resources, are considerably depleting for industrial power generations, and their consumption also causes ever-growing environmental issues.1 Therefore, extensive efforts have been focused on developing eco-friendly and sustainable energy resources. Portable or wearable electronics, such as mobile phones, watches, micro-computers, and health monitoring systems,2 are highly advanced in miniaturization and integration. Searching for new-type portable and wearable power-supply devices with high stability and high output power is very attractive and highly urgent.
Enabling the direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy, thermoelectrics exhibit great potential to overcome challenges mentioned above.1 Thermoelectric materials and devices can recycle waste heat for power generation, and are also suitable for charging various low-energy electronic devices using the temperature difference (ΔT) between the human skin and environment.3–5 To evaluate the thermoelectric potentials of materials, a dimensionless figure of merit ZT is defined as ZT = S2σT/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ the electrical conductivity, S2σ described as the thermoelectric power factor, κ the thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. Further, κ = κl + κe, where κl is the lattice thermal conductivity and κe is the electronic thermal conductivity. Generally, to realize a high ZT, it is required to increase S2σ and reduce κ (especially κl). However, restricted by microstructures, carrier concentration (ne for n-type materials and np for p-type materials), and lattice vibration mode of materials, thermal and electrical transport properties are always interrelated. Therefore, it is often challenging to obtain thermoelectric materials with large ZT values. Besides, taking a portable and wearable thermoelectric device as an example, good mechanical properties and flexibility are also needed to maximize the use of energy obtained from the human body (maximizing the thermoelectric conversion efficiency),6 while a good abrasion resistance and stability are also required for the design of materials and device.7
Fibers, which can be either natural or synthetic, refer to substances composed of continuous or discontinuous filaments that have been widely used in modern society.8,9 Particularly, in the field of thermoelectric materials and devices,10 fibers, especially nanofibers, play an unparalleled role in realizing high-performance, portable, and wearable thermoelectrics.11 Fiber-based thermoelectric materials can be divided into three categories, namely inorganic fibers, organic fibers, and inorganic/organic hybrid fibers. Fig. 1 describes the current advances in thermoelectric fibers and their various applications, including all-carbon-based fibers,12 carbon hybrid fibers,13 semiconductor-based fibers,14 core–shell-structured fibers,15 oxide-based fibers,16 coated fibers,17 fibers as secondary phases in thermoelectric materials,18 fiber-reinforced thermoelectric cements,19 organic fibers,20 inorganic/organic hybrid fibers,21 and advanced thermoelectric fabrics.22 Recently, significant breakthroughs have been made in the theoretical research of fiber application.23 Particularly, the lower-dimensional structure (such as a nanofiber) can significantly improve its thermoelectric properties due to the considerable nano-size effect and unique band engineering, which provides a new direction for improving the thermoelectric properties of materials. Meanwhile, considering the flexibility of the wearable thermoelectric devices, the research on organic and organic/inorganic fiber-based thermoelectric materials is also inevitable.6,24,25 Therefore, there is an urgent need for designing high-quality and high-performance thermoelectric fibers targeting various applications.23

With the fast development of computational science and fabrication techniques, the thermoelectric performance of various thermoelectric fibers has significantly improved. Fig. 2 summarizes the reported maximum power factor S2σmax and maximum figure-of-merit ZTmax of fiber-based materials,12–15,19,21,22,26–151 from which some advanced thermoelectric fibers have shown highly competitive performance compared to those of bulk thermoelectric materials. For example, flexible Sb2Te3/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers exhibit an ultrahigh S2σ of ∼6500 μW m−1 K−2 with a high ZT of 0.48,69 while single-crystal SnSe-based core fibers with a high ZT of up to ∼2 at 862 K15 are very competitive to some inorganic bulk materials, such as Bi2Te3,152–164 Cu2Se,165–171 GeTe,172–180 PbTe,181–189 SnSe,190–201 and SnTe.202–209

Considering the demanding potentials for fiber-based thermoelectrics, in this work, we review significant advances in fiber-based thermoelectrics, including inorganic fibers, organic fibers, inorganic/organic hybrid fibers, and fiber-based fabrics and devices. The fundamentals, synthesis, characterizations, property evaluation, and applications of thermoelectric fibers are comprehensively discussed with carefully selected cases, and corresponding thermoelectric devices based on these advanced fibers are introduced for both power generation and refrigeration. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and future directions toward the development of fiber-based thermoelectrics.
2 Inorganic thermoelectric fibers
To achieve the goal of applying high-performance inorganic thermoelectric materials in wearable thermoelectric devices, high flexibility should be achieved in these inorganic materials, and lowering their dimensions from three-dimensional (3D) bulks into one-dimensional (1D) fibers is a good way, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). In addition to the strengthened flexibility, computation-based theoretical results on low-dimensional materials indicate that, when an electron is confined to a structure with a scale smaller than the electron wave function space, the electron can possess special movement characteristics, which induce the quantum confinement effect and may enlarge bandgaps of materials,212–215 leading to potentially improved thermoelectric performance,216 as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). For example, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that by increasing the diameter of 1D GaAs1−xPx,217 its bandgap can be obviously decreased due to the quantum confinement effect. Conversely, upon increasing x, the bandgap can be enlarged, indicating that the electrical transport performance of 1D materials can be improved by rational compositional design. In terms of the predicted thermoelectric performance of 1D materials, calculations indicated that a diameter of <1 nm in Bi2Te3 NWs could induce an ultra-high ZT of >14,214 while other computational-based work reported that a high ZT of >3 could be achieved in ZnO NWs when the carrier density was rationally tuned to ∼2 × 1020 cm−3 with an ultralow κl of 0.12 W m−1 K−1.218 Owing to the increased density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, sufficient carriers of low-dimensional inorganic materials (such as nanofibers) may maintain high σ and S.215 Besides, the low Fermi energy contributes to a high S, leading to a high S2σ.1 In addition, owing to the low-dimensional feature that provides more surfaces/interfaces, the strengthened phonon scatterings reduce κl,219 as illustrated in Fig. 3(c). Therefore, the low-dimensional nanofiber-based inorganic thermoelectric materials have gained significant attention.220,221

In order to realize the high performance in low-dimensional thermoelectrics, one way relates to utilizing the quantum confinement effect to enlarge the bandgap, resulting in an improved S2σ.212 Another way is designing a large number of internal interfaces in 1D materials, which significantly strengthens phonon scatterings and ensures that the reduction of κ should be much larger than the reduction of σ.222 These two strategies are developing fast and dependently. Currently, employing an advanced material preparation technology to prepare low-dimensional inorganic nanofibers based on the discovered high-performance bulk thermoelectric material has shown promise.223 Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that inorganic nanofibers possess high thermoelectric performance. However, it is still slow for the development of an efficient preparation technology in synthesizing high-quality thermoelectric nanofibers, especially for the nanofibers that can work under high temperature and high flexibility.
2.1 Carbon fibers
Carbon-based fibers (such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene fibers) have been widely considered as promising thermoelectric materials, owing to their high σ and tunable S.30,32,39,145,146,224–243 Graphene and CNTs are typical carbon elements that belong to allotropes of carbon.244,245 Therefore, we classify these two materials as inorganic materials in this review. Calculation results indicate that graphite nanofibers could achieve a high ZT up to 8 by 14C isotope doping and the effect of the finite phonon mean free path.246 As a typical 1D inorganic nanofiber, CNTs have exhibited unique thermoelectric performance.35 A high ZT of 0.4 at 673 K was reported in CNT papers treated with Ar plasma.211 In terms of their fundamentals, Fig. 4(a) illustrates a single-walled CNT (SWCNT), which can be formed by rolling a graphene sheet from (0,0) to (n,m) along the “roll-up vector” (with respect to the zig-zag axis).244 A set of chiral indices (n,m) are defined by the chiral angle (α) and the magnitude of this roll-up vector, which denotes unique SWCNTs with particular electronic structures (1/3 SWCNTs are metallic and 2/3 SWCNTs are semiconducting). In Fig. 4(a), a cylinder formed by rolling up the shaded blue area corresponds to a segment of (9,4) SWCNT unit cell.244Fig. 4(b) illustrates the structures and thermopowers of the metallic (8,5) SWCNT and semiconducting (9,4) SWCNT.244 In the DOS of SWCNTs, the sharp singularities are produced by quantum confinement in two dimensions. It is interesting to note that slight changes in the chirality, diameter, and α result in dramatic differences in DOS and S. Rational doping is commonly employed to enhance the thermoelectric properties of SWCNTs. Fig. 4(c) summarizes the thermoelectric properties (top: S, bottom: S2σ) of p-type and n-type redox-doped SWCNTs.30 Both p-type and n-type SWCNTs show high S2σ of >25 μW m−1 K−2 by appropriate doping with different molecules.

SWCNTs can form freestanding networks by using advanced fabrication techniques. Such freestanding networks can act as thermoelectric materials for applying into flexible thermoelectric devices. For example, Fig. 4(d) illustrates the fabrication of semiconducting SWCNT thermoelectric thin films.28 In this study, in order to better disperse the high-purity semiconducting SWCNTs, cleavable polymers based on fluorene were used, which could be removed from the deposited films by submersion in a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution, leading to only-semiconducting-SWCNTs in the as-deposited films.28 In terms of the mechanism of removing polymers, polymer backbones were destroyed by TFA through catalyzing hydrolytic cleavage of the imine (CQN) bonds in PFPD-based polymers or disrupting the hydrogen bonds in SMP-based polymers.28 Here, PFPD is the abbreviation for poly[(9,9-di-n-dodecyl-2,7-fluorendiyl-dimethine)-(1,4-phenylene-dinitrilomethine)], and SMP is the abbreviation for 1,10-(((1E,10E)-(9,9-didodecyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl))bis(6-methyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5,2-diyl))bis(3-dodecylurea). Fig. 4(e) shows an atomic force microscope (AFM) image of semiconducting SWCNT networks prepared from PT:PFPD dispersions.28 Here, PT is the abbreviation for the plasma-torch process. It is clearly seen that pure SWCNT networks were obtained. Fig. 4(f) compares the σ-dependent S2σ of semiconducting SWCNT networks from PT:SMP and PT:PFPD dispersions,28 from which a high S2σ up to ∼700 μW m−1 K−2 could be achieved at room temperature. This is competitive to many bulk inorganic materials, such as SnSe,191,192,194 Cu2Se,247 and Bi2Te3.155 By treating with salts and crown ether, SWCNTs exhibit n-type semiconducting features with a promising ZT of 0.1 and excellent air- and heat-stability (stable at 100 °C for more than 1 month).33 Similarly, n-type SWCNT networks could be realized by K-doping, and I2-doping for enhancing their σ.38 Such unique SWCNT networks exhibited an ultralow room-temperature κ of only 0.035 W m−1 K−1.38 Furthermore, by twisting the SWCNT interconnected films, an ultrahigh S2σ up to 2482 μW m−1 K−2 can be achieved at room temperature due to the maintained high S by avoiding conventional nitric acid treatment and tedious composite technology,34 and ZT values of 0.74–1.86 could be estimated if the reported out-of-plane κ values of 0.4–1 W m−1 K−1 are used.211
Owing to the high electrical performance and high flexibility of CNTs (especially for semiconducting SWCNTs), CNT-based yarn (CNTY) was further designed to compose highly flexible thermoelectric generators (F-TEG). Fig. 4(g) illustrates a typical fabrication of CNTYs and F-TEG based on these CNTYs.12 CNTYs can be continuously produced by direct spinning after synthesis. In order to form F-TEGs, the synthesized CNTYs are wound onto a flexible supporting unit, and alternatively doped into n-type by polyethyleneimine (PEI) and p-types by FeCl3 solution. The undoped materials are between the two doped regions. Such a unique design does not need any metal electrode, which eliminates the influence of the interface resistance. Both n-type and p-type CNTYs exhibit high S2σ up to ∼2375 μW m−1 K−2 at room temperature, derived from e high σ of > 7000 S cm−1 and improved absolute S of >50 μV K−1. To fabricate these CNTYs into F-TEGs, the alternately n- and p-doped CNTY as thermoelectric “legs” with undoped regions as electrodes were carefully wound around a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate without interconnection of the CNTY.12Fig. 4(h) shows the optical images of CNTY-based F-TEG with 60 p–n pairs,12 and Fig. 4(i) shows the obtained output voltage of CNTY-based F-TEG with 240 p–n pairs at a ΔT between atmosphere and body heat.12 The ΔT between F-TEG and a human arm was measured to ∼6 K, leading to an output voltage of ∼54 mV. In addition, the maximum power density could reach 697 μW g−1 at a ΔT of 40 K for a CNTY-based F-TEG with 60 p–n pairs.12 Similarly, a high S2σ could be realized in wet-spun CNT fibers (432 μW m−1 K−2) by mild annealing, and F-TEGs based on 40 pairs of p- and n-type CNT fibers show a power density of 259 μW g−1 at a ΔT of 20 K.26 A wet environment also plays a significant role in determining the thermoelectric performance of CNT fibers.32 Furthermore, by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD), continuous n-type CNTs networks can be formed with a high S2σ of ∼1500 μW m−1 K−2. Fabricated F-TEGs with 3 p–n pairs exhibit an output power density of ∼167 μW cm−2 at a ΔT of 27.5 K.36
In addition to CNT fibers, graphene fibers have commonly been studied in recent years. Graphene is a typical two-dimensional (2D) material with extraordinary electrical and thermal performance, and graphene possesses a great potential for applying to thermoelectrics.248 It was reported that a ZT value of 3.7 × 10−6 could be obtained in pristine graphene fibers due to high κ (from 45.8 to 149.7 W m−1 K−1) and low S (from −3.9 to 0.8 μV K−1).145 By bromine doping, the ZT of graphene fibers can be improved up to 2.76 × 10−3, benefiting from the improved S2σ (624 μW m−1 K−2).39 Besides, integral p–n connected graphene oxide (GO) fibers were designed for assembling F-TEGs.62 The GO fibers reduced with N2H4·H2O showed a p-type feature, while n-type GO fibers can be produced by doping polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE). Acceptable S2σ of ∼1 and ∼0.25 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in the p- and n-type fibers.62 By integrating p–n connected GO fibers into a flexible PDMS substrate, a wearable F-TEG was realized, which exhibited an output voltage of 3 mV and an output power of 500 nW by a ΔT of 70 K.62
Sometimes, other inorganic materials are added into carbon-based fibers to further improve their thermoelectric properties. For SWCNTs, the addition of MoS2 flakes improved their ZT by 10 times (up to 0.003).31 For recycled carbon fibers,249 it was reported that by electro-deposition technique, n-type thermoelectric recycled carbon fiber sheets with Bi2Te3 coating were fabricated, which exhibited a competitive absolute S of 54 μV K−1.13 In addition to Bi2Te3, Bi2S3 was added to the recycled carbon fibers to form inorganic hybrids with S2σ of >1 μW m−1 K−2.41,42
2.2 Semiconductor fibers
Semiconductors are important members of the thermoelectric family. Compared with carbon-based thermoelectric materials, semiconductors exhibit much higher thermoelectric performance due to their suitable band structures and much low κ. Until now, many state-of-the-art semiconductors have shown outstanding thermoelectric performance with ZTs > 2, such as Cu2Se (ZTs > 2.6),250,251 PbTe (ZTs > 2.5),252,253 SnSe (ZTs > 2.6),254,255 and GeTe (ZTs > 2.4).256–258 Therefore, to further improve their thermoelectric performance or employ them in wider applications such as miniature thermoelectric devices or F-TEGs, fabrications of lower-dimensional semiconductors such as nano/microfibers are being developed.
Nanowires (NWs) are a typical kind of nanofibers, which are usually epitaxially grown on a substrate.259 To ensure that NWs are grown along specific directions, catalyst particles are employed to control the lowest formation energy.1 Besides, the focused ion beam (FIB) technique is commonly used to “trim” NWs to achieve specific diameters.149Fig. 5(a) shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of trimmed Bi2−xSbxTe3−y NWs by FIB.149 After trimming, the 750 nm-diameter Bi0.8Sb1.2Te2.9 could exhibit a peak ZT of ∼0.9.149 Other works indicate that Si–Ge NWs fabricated by a vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) method show large ZT values of ∼0.46 at 450 K experimentally (and even >2 at 800 K theoretically) by rationally tuning the ratio of Si and Ge.148 In addition, 130 nm-diameter SnSe NWs using a catalyst-assisted VLS method exhibited a ZT of ∼0.156 at 370 K.150 In some occasions, NWs possess multi-phases. Ultralong AgxTey nanofibers, synthesized by galvanically displacing electro-spun Ni nanofibers,43 have two types, namely Ag-rich fibers (co-existing Ag and Ag2Te phases) and Te-rich fibers (co-existing Te and Ag7Te4 phases). Phase interfaces act as energy barriers to tune the thermoelectric performance of the nanofibers, and a maximum S2σ of 4 μW m−1 K−2 could be observed at a Te content of 30% with an energy barrier height of 0.054 eV.43 Similarly, Bi2Te3/Te multi-segmented nanofibers with different segment lengths could be achieved by annealing super-saturated BixTe1−x nanowires (NWs), which show a low κ of ∼0.65 W m−1 K−1 and a high absolute S of ∼160 μV K−1 at 300 K.260 In addition, NWs can form dense films to better evaluate their thermoelectric performance. Flexible n-type Ag2Te NW films on copy-paper substrates were fabricated by a novel glass-fiber-aided cold-press method.79 A high S2σ could be achieved at ∼468 K (192 μW m−1 K−2), and a thermoelectric module containing 10 pieces of series-connected Ag2Te films exhibits an output voltage of 60 mV at a ΔT of 80 K.79

In addition to NWs, 1D nanotubes and nanorods are typical kinds of nanofibers. It was reported that large-area paper-like fabrics made of Si nanotubes could exhibit a ZT of 0.34 at 823 K,14 as illustrated in Fig. 5(b). In terms of the fabrication, carbon fibers were first coated by poly-Si layers. After the annealing of the carbon fiber cores, SiO2 substrates remained. Finally, the poly-Si layers surrounded the SiO2 substrates to form Si nanotubes. In addition to their promising ZT values, the as-fabricated TEG based on Si nanotube fabric exhibited an outstanding power density of 10000 μW cm−2 at 973 K.14 Besides, heavily Cu-doped SnSe 1D microbelts synthesized by a solvothermal method showed a σ of ∼4.2 S cm−1 at room temperature, which can be further improved by applying 1% strain (∼6.0 S cm−1).196 Calculations indicated that the applied 1% strain narrowed the bandgap of SnSe, leading to such an enhancement on σ.196 As a result, a S2σ of >36 μW m−1 K−2 could be evaluated,196 indicating the potential for applying these microbelts in miniature thermoelectric devices.
Coating semiconductor nanocrystals on glass or silica fibers is another suitable way to realize high-performance, stable and flexible inorganic thermoelectric fibers. Fig. 5(c) shows a transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of PbTe nanocrystals and an inset SEM image of nanocrystal-coated glass fibers.261 PbTe nanocrystals were synthesized by an aqueous solution method, and the coating of glass fibers involved the alternative dipping of the glass fibers among a PbTe nanocrystal solution, diluted hydrazine aqueous solution, and anhydrous acetonitrile.261 Such unique composite fibers were reported to have a low κ of ∼0.226 W m−1 K−1 and a high S2σ of >400 μW m−1 K−2 at 400 K (measured by the 3ω method),17,261 giving rise to a high ZT of ∼0.75.17 Besides, the glass fiber yarn coated with PbTe nanocrystals can be bent to a curvature of 84.5°, indicating certain flexibility.17 By stuffing the PbTe nanocrystal-coated glass fibers between hot and cold water flow through a coaxial design, a ΔT of 58 K can lead to an output voltage of 1.7 mV,17 indicating the potential for applying to harvesting waste heat from industrial pipes for power generation. Other works indicated that by coating with ZnO and Al-doped ZnO, glass fibers showed S of −478.3 and −1057.8 μV at ΔTs of 4.5 and 4.3 K,47 respectively. In addition, striped thin-film thermoelectric fibers made with thermal evaporation of Ni and Ag were reported, which showed a maximum power of 2 nW for 7 couples at a ΔT of 6.6 K.262 CNT networks were also attempted to coat the surface of intrinsically insulating glass fiber yarns by a dip-coating deposition process, which showed a maximum S2σ of ∼109.8 μW m−1 K−2.48
In addition to semiconductor-nanocrystal-coated glass/silica nanofibers, semiconductor core fibers are quickly being developed. Different from the coated nanofibers, the crystalline semiconductor core fibers are commonly fabricated by thermally drawing hermetically sealed high-quality inorganic materials in a flexible fiber-like substrate. Single-crystal SnSe thermoelectric fibers were fabricated by a laser-induced directional crystallization based on a typical thermal drawing and CO2 laser recrystallization technique,15 as shown in Fig. 5(d). The thermal drawing process made polycrystalline SnSe cores, and the following laser recrystallization process recrystallized the SnSe cores into single crystals with a rock-salt Fmm structure. Such unique single-crystal SnSe core fibers were reported to show a ZT up to 2 at 862 K.15 Besides, to achieve high flexibility, the diameter of the resulting fiber was kept at 500 μm, while the diameter of the fiber core was 40 μm.15 This work also designed multi-core SnSe fibers with both high-density p- and n-type SnSe micro/nanowires,15 as illustrated in Fig. 5(e), which is a typical p–n flexible thermoelectric structure within a fiber. Such unique thermoelectric fibers can be used for designing large-area, light-weight, high-performance, and flexible/wearable thermoelectric devices, as illustrated in Fig. 5(f). By converting human body heat to electricity, a 30 mV output voltage was realized by a ΔT of ∼10 K.15 In addition to power generation, such unique semiconductor core fibers could be used for refrigeration. Fig. 5(g) shows the finite element modeling (FEM) simulated and actual infrared (IR) camera captured temperature profiles for the wearable cooling fabric based on n-type Bi2Se3 core fibers and p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 core fiber.46 The ZTs of p- and n-type fibers were 1.25 and 0.23 at 300 K,46 respectively, and a maximum cooling of 5 °C could be realized by wearing the 2D cooling textile, which is promising for personal temperature management.46 Other works indicated that by a modified molten core drawing method, novel Bi2Te3 core fibers consisting of hexagonal polycrystalline nanosheets with borosilicate glass cladding were fabricated with a high ZT of 0.73 at 300 K.44 Similarly, a promising ZT of 0.18 at room temperature was realized in Bi2Se3 core thermoelectric fibers with K9 glass cladding, fabricated by a similar route.45 In addition to Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3, n-type In4Se3 alloy core thermoelectric fibers were fabricated by a similar molten core drawing method and show a high S of −347 μV K−1.263
In addition to flexible thermoelectric devices, miniature thermoelectric devices based on semiconductor fibers were developed. It was reported that by an extrusion process, flexible and continuous fibers could be achieved from a solution of mixed semiconductor powders and a thermoplastic resin dissolved in an organic solvent.84 The polymer phases in the as-extruded fibers were then removed by sintering, leading to all-semiconductor fibers.84 The as-fabricated p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 fibers showed a S of 179–193 μV K−1 and a S2σ of 170–260 μW m−1 K−2, while the n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 fibers showed an absolute S of 207–268 μV K−1 and a S2σ of 30–40 μW m−1 K−2.84 The designed miniature thermoelectric generator based on these semiconductor fibers exhibited an output voltage of 4.8 mV and an output power of 18 nW by a ΔT of 12 °C.84 Such unique miniature thermoelectric devices are suitable as power sources of small sensors, such as heart pacemaker.2
2.3 Oxide fibers
Different from semiconductor-based fibers, oxide-based thermoelectric fibers possess many unique advantages.181,264 Most of the oxide fibers are non-toxic, indicating that they are ideal candidates for applying to wearable thermoelectrics. Meanwhile, oxide fibers can exhibit significantly high stability at high temperatures, which broaden their applications, such as industrial and vehicle waste heat collections. Furthermore, the fabrications of oxide fibers are relatively mature, which can meet the requirement of industrial scale-up. Therefore, oxide-based thermoelectric fibers are especially suitable for industrial power generation.
Within the oxide thermoelectric fibers, perovskite n-type SrTiO3 has attracted much attention in recent years due to its high thermal stability (the melting point is as high as 2080 °C), eco-friendly feature, low cost, mature fabrication technique, and promising thermoelectric properties.264 The bandgap of SrTiO3 is ∼3.2 eV,265 which ensures a suitable S of >100 μV K−1 with potentially high ne (∼l × 22 cm−3).264 By rationally doping with La/Nb and structural design, significantly improved thermoelectric properties of SrTiO3 are observed.266,267 SrTiO3 fibers could be fabricated by an in situ hydrothermal method using hydrated TiO2 fibers as both reactant and template,268 but their thermoelectric performance still needs further investigated. In addition to SrTiO3, thermoelectric oxide NaCo2O4 nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning technique,16,269 and their thermoelectric effect can be evaluated by electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) contrast mapping, which is based on the scanning probe microscopy (SPM) technique.16 It should be noted that the thermoelectric performance of oxide-based fibers still needs further improvement to meet the requirement of practical applications.
2.4 Fiber-reinforced bulk thermoelectrics
Fibers, especially for nanofibers, are ideal candidates that act as positive secondary phases in bulk thermoelectric materials. Benefiting from their 1D feature, introducing nanofibers can provide high-density interfaces in the matrix, acting as effective energy barriers to further improve the S of bulk thermoelectric materials based on the energy filtering effect.270 Besides, the dense interfaces in the matrix can also act as phonon scattering centers to effectively scatter most of the low- and medium-wavelength phonons, leading to a much lower κl.271

Fig. 6(a) illustrates the design of Cu2Se/CNT hybrid bulk materials for the applications of nanofibers in bulk thermoelectric materials.18 Precursors, including Cu, Se, and multi-walled CNTs, were mixed and reacted into Cu2Se/CNTs hybrid powders by high energy ball-milling. After a sparkle plasma sintering (SPS) process, the hybrid powders were sintered into high-density Cu2Se/CNTs bulk materials. Fig. 6(b) shows a spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (Cs-corrected STEM) image of Cu2Se with 0.75 wt% CNTs,18 from which a cross-section of CNT can be clearly seen. These CNTs can provide high-density interfaces in the bulk material, which effectively reduce the κl by scattering most of the low- and medium-wavelength phonons, as illustrated in Fig. 6(c).18Fig. 6(d) shows T-dependent ZT of Cu2Se/CNT hybrid materials with different contents of CNT.18 It is interesting to see that an ultrahigh ZT of 2.4 at 1000 K could be realized by introducing 0.75 wt% CNTs. Similarly, for oxide-based bulk thermoelectric materials, by introducing 3.0 wt% SrTiO3 fibers into Sr0.75La0.1Dy0.1TiO3, a ZT of 0.19 was realized at 773 K, benefited from a high S2σ of ∼700 μW m−1 K−2.268

In addition to improving the thermoelectric performance, the introduction of fibers can boost the mechanical properties of bulk materials. It was reported that Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 powders were ball-milled with multi-wall CNTs, and a co-sintering of these precursors was followed.272 The adhesive force between adjacent Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 grains was significantly strengthened by the embedded CNTs between the grains, contributing to a bending strength of 90 MPa for the bulk materials. Similarly, for skutterudite-based bulk thermoelectric materials, the introduction of 1 vol% short carbon fibers significantly improved the flexural strength of bulk CeFe4Sb12 by 53%,273 while a slight improvement of ZT was simultaneously achieved from ∼0.8 to >0.9 at 800 K. Besides, for Mg2Si-based alloys, by introducing 0.8 at% SiC NWs in bulk Mg2.16(Si0.3Sn0.7)0.98Sb0.02, the compressive strengthen was improved by 30% from 450 MPa to 570 MPa,274 while the peak ZT of ∼1.20 at 750 K was influenced little by introducing SiC NWs.
A special case for the fiber-reinforced bulk thermoelectric materials is the steel fiber or carbon fiber reinforced cement-based composites (CFRC).275–277 It is well known that cement-based materials are indispensable for the construction of modern society, owing to their good durability and mechanical properties.278,279 However, conventional cement-based materials have gradually failed to meet the requirements of the new technological revolutions in current life.280 Therefore, in order to improve the performance and realize new functions in cement-based materials, the rapid development of functional cement is underway, and one of the typical functional cement materials is fiber-reinforced thermoelectric cement,281 as shown in Fig. 6(e).19 By introducing carbon fibers in the cement matrix, thermoelectric cement with a certain thermoelectric effect can be achieved, as illustrated in Fig. 6(f and g). Such a unique thermoelectric cement has broad application prospects in structural monitoring, intelligent buildings, and other engineering fields. For example, buildings in cities are affected by strong light, automobile exhaust, and industrial exhaust emissions, which will generate excessive heat. However, if this urban waste heat can be collected and converted into electrical energy through thermoelectric cement, considerable energy could be saved. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the thermoelectric performance of such “smart” cement-based thermoelectric materials. Besides, fiber-reinforced thermoelectric cement could be used for road snow removal and ice melting, which solve the issues of road icing caused by rain and snow in winter. However, it should be noted that both the S and σ of the current thermoelectric cement are low,49,275,282,283 leading to ZTs < 0.01, as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore new ways to improve the thermoelectric properties of fiber-reinforced cement, such as by introducing mineral admixtures,283 cement interface,284 and CNTs.285 Besides, it is also important to understand the influence of various factors in the actual environment on their thermoelectric properties, such as fiber content,286 moisture,50 and compression shear.51
3 Organic thermoelectric fibers
In order to realize high flexibility in inorganic-material-based thermoelectric device, one conventional method is to introduce flexible substrate, such as fabric and polyimide.287–290 Although the as-fabricated thermoelectric devices possess good thermoelectric performance, there are still some considerable shortages, such as the high cost, high toxicity, complex fabrication, and poor flexibility. It was pointed out that during the fabrication and usage of inorganic-material-based thermoelectric devices, the inorganic parts may cause serious damage to the mechanical properties and wearability of the flexible substrates. Therefore, the design of organic-material-based thermoelectric devices is currently being developed.291 Because organic thermoelectric materials possess much higher flexibility, they can better adhere to the skin, maximizing ΔT between human body and environment and in turn, improving the thermoelectric conversion efficiency. As a result, organic thermoelectric materials have gained significant attention in recent years.292
Currently, the commonly used organic materials that target thermoelectric applications include polyacetylene (PA),293 polythiophenes (PTs),294 polypyrrole (PPy),104 polyaniline (PANI),295 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),296 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS).52,297 These materials possess some common characteristics, such as low fabrication cost, lightweight property, good flexibility, good ductility, and intrinsic low κ.292 However, it should be noted that there are still some issues in the thermoelectric applications of organic polymers. For example, PA are not stable in the air, which limits its practical application.298 P3HT has a high S in the undoped state, but it is easy to cause other disordered structures during the fabrication, which affects the stability of σ.287 Although PANI and other polymers have high stability in the environment, their σ is low, and the improvement of their ZT value is still tricky.299 In terms of the PEDOT:PSS, due to its water solubility, good flexibility, easy fabrication, and promising thermoelectric properties, PEDOT:PSS has attracted significant attention in recent decades.52,297 At present, there are two main methods to improve the thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS: one is to rationally dope it by post-treatment with acid, alkali, organic solvent,52 and the other is to compound it with inorganic nano-materials, such as CNTs and nanosized semiconductors.60 However, although the ZT of PEDOT:PSS has been significantly improved up to ∼0.75 by ion accumulation on its surface,300 it is still not competitive enough compared to that of inorganic thermoelectric materials. Therefore, developing lower-dimensional organic thermoelectric materials such as organic thermoelectric fibers is an alternative.301
3.1 1D organic thermoelectric fibers
For conventional organic thermoelectric materials, it is recognized that increased structural order and molecular organization (such as increased chain alignment) can lead to a simultaneous increase of S and σ (derived from the improved mobility μ),302,303 leading to a high S2σ.304 However, ordered structures in conducting polymers may also result in high κl due to their single-crystalline-like features, and one typical case is the ultra-drawn single-crystal polyethylene (PE) with a high κl of 104 W m−1 K−1.305 In this situation, a rationally designed structure is required to balance the electrical and thermal transportation, and achieve high thermoelectric performance in conventional organic thermoelectric materials, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a).306 In addition to a rationally designed structure, another promising way to achieve high thermoelectric performance is to rationally design chain-oriented polymeric fibers, which can realize both increased chain alignment and some extents of structural disorder, as illustrated in Fig. 7(b).306 Similar to the mechanism of inorganic thermoelectric fibers, assuming that the mean free paths of phonons and charge carriers are separated in length scales, if chain lengths are shorter than the mean free path of phonons but longer than that of charge carriers, κl can be considerably reduced due to the strengthened phonon scattering at boundaries, while σ may not be influenced to a great extent,306 as illustrated in Fig. 7(c). Calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations indicated that a significant reduction of axial κ (0.97 W m−1 K−1) could be observed in chain-orientated PEDOT fibers with a relative molecular weight of 5600 and a crystallinity of 0.49, leading to a high ZT of 0.48 at 298 K,306 which is much higher than that of conventional PEDOT (ZT = 0.22).307 Therefore, the organic thermoelectric fiber has been treated as one of the key members in the family of organic thermoelectric materials.

Until now, fiber-based organic thermoelectric polymers are being developed fast based on conventional conducting polymers, such as PANI fibers308 and PEDOT:PSS fibers.20Fig. 7(d) shows a SEM image of PEDOT:PSS fibers after ethylene glycol (EG) post-treatment.54 The width of the as-fabricated fiber is ∼140 μm. By post-treatment with EG and dimethyl sulfoxide, the σ could be significantly improved by ∼200% and the S was only slightly reduced by 5%, leading to a S2σ of ∼4.75 μW m−1 K−2.54Fig. 7(e) shows a schematic diagram of PEDOT:PSS-based thermoelectric device and its output voltage and power density.54 The p–n legs consist of EG-treated p-type PEDOT:PSS fibers and n-type CNT fibers, which were connected in series and linked by Ag paste.54 By a ΔT of ∼60 K, an output voltage of 20.7 mV and a power density of 481.2 μW cm−2 could be achieved.54 Another typical case is the wet-spun PEDOT:PSS fibers, as shown in Fig. 7(f).85 After the H2SO4-treatment, the chain packing order of the as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS fibers was significantly improved, and confirmed by their wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) results shown in Fig. 7(g).85 As can be seen, the amorphous halo of the randomly distributed PSS with a broad peak located at qz = 1.16 Å−1 is not clearly observed in the WAXS pattern, indicating the reduction of PSS by the H2SO4-treatment. Instead, the π-stacking between adjacent PEDOT chains with a peak at qz = 1.75 Å−1 is widely observed, indicating the improvement of the chain alignment.85 As a result, an optimized S2σ of 147.8 μW m−1 K−2 could be realized, benefited from a high σ of 4029.5 S cm−1 and a S of 19.2 μV K−1 at 300 K.85 Besides, even at a knotted state, there is no degradation in their measured thermoelectric properties, indicating the outstanding mechanical flexibility and robustness.85Fig. 7(h) shows earmuffs with embedded PEDOT:PSS fiber-based thermoelectric generators as a wearable device, and their performance.85 The PEDOT:PSS fibers and Ni wires acted as the p- and n-legs, and 5 pairs of the p–n legs were serially connected. The joints between the PEDOT:PSS fibers and Ni wires were connected using Ag paste. By a ΔT of 9.1 °C between the human body and the environment, an output voltage of 1.9 mV and a maximum output power density of ∼0.273 μW cm−2 were simultaneously achieved.85 Other works reported a self-powered flexible sensor based on the wet-spun hollow PEDOT:PSS fibers.20 A ΔT of 6 °C by touching fingers on the sensors could result in an output voltage of 404 μV.20
In addition to PEDOT:PSS fibers, other organic-polymer-based thermoelectric fibers were developed. For example, conducting PANI fibers with a submicron morphology were designed by doping with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA).309 Compared to the conventional PANI, the S2σ of the as-designed PANI fibers improved by 20 times with a value of ∼1.1 μW m−1 K−2 at 300 K.309 Similarly, PANI nanotubes were fabricated by an aqueous solution method without a template, and doped by β-naphthalene sulfonic acid (NSA).310 By an aniline/NSA ratio of 4:1, the as-prepared PANI nanotube showed a high S of 212.4 μV K−1, an improved σ of 0.0077 S cm−1, and a lowered κ of 0.21 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K.310 Besides, the PANI NWs, which were fabricated by a soft template method and doped by p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA), showed a ZT of 2.75 × 10−5 at 320 K,151 resulting from the low κ of 0.32 W m−1 K−1 at this temperature. For PEDOT, by electropolymerizing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in aqueous LiClO4, PEDOT NWs were fabricated based on a template method, which can be described as a lithographically patterned nanowire electrodeposition (LPNE) process.105 The as-fabricated PEDOT NWs arrays with 750 NWs were reported to exhibit a high absolute S of 122 μV K−1 at 310 K.105 Similarly, PEDOT NWs could be achieved by chemical oxidation polymerization in reverse microemulsions with sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) as the surfactant,106 which exhibits a σ of 71.4 S cm−1 and a S of 48.0 μV K−1, leading to a competitive S2σ of ∼16.5 μW m−1 K−2 at 300 K.106 Besides, freestanding PEDOT NWs can be synthesized by template-confined in situ polymerization.107 After introducing 0.2 wt% PEDOT NWs in poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):tosylate (PEDOT:Tos) to form nanocomposites, a high S2σ of 446.6 μW m−1 K−2 and a high ZT of 0.44 were obtained at room temperature.107 The thermoelectric devices based on the PEDOT NWs/PEDOT hybrid as p-type legs and nitrogen-doped graphene as n-type legs exhibited a normalized output power of ∼0.05 μW cm−2 under a temperature differential of 10.1 °C.107 In terms of PPy, the PPy nanotubes and NWs were fabricated by a chemical oxidative polymerization method.108 The as-prepared PPy NWs exhibited a higher S2σ of ∼0.3 μW m−1 K−2 at 380 K, which was higher than the as-prepared PPy nanotubes (S2σ of <0.075 μW m−1 K−2 at 380 K) due to the confinement effect that simultaneously improved S and σ.108
3.2 2D organic-fiber-based films
In order to expand the application and further improve the performance, 1D organic thermoelectric fibers can be made into two 2D organic thermoelectric films through various fabrication techniques. In terms of the design rule of organic-fiber-based films, one of the key points is to realize well-aligned chain order (strengthen the orientation or anisotropy) in the as-fabricated films to realize higher performance along specific directions, which is similar to the 1D organic thermoelectric fibers. In fact, such a strategy that is based on the anisotropy strengthening was commonly used in some polycrystalline thermoelectric materials with intrinsic anisotropy, such as SnSe,197–199,311–314 Cu2Se,247,315,316 and Bi2Te3.155,157Fig. 8(a) illustrates the fabrication of small molecule 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB)-treated P3HT film.88 The undoped P3HT film covered by TCB powder was first heated to 75 °C, and then rapidly cooled from one side to the other to room temperature. A large temperature gradient could be achieved by the fast cooling, which solidified TCB as fiber-like crystals along the temperature gradient. At the same time, because of the strong π–π conjugated interactions between the thiophene and benzene rings, the P3HT could solidify on the TCB surface with polymer chains locking into the lattice of TCB, resulting in orientated P3HT and crystalline TCB fibers, as illustrated by Fig. 8(b).88 An orientated P3HT film was achieved by removing TCB.88 To verify the anisotropy of the as-fabricated film, various characterizations were investigated. Fig. 8(c) shows a two-dimensional-grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) pattern of TCB-treated P3HT film,88 and Fig. 8(d) shows corresponding 1D diffraction profile.88 Here, qz indicates the out-of-plane direction, and qxy indicates the in-plane direction. It is clearly seen that a strong (010) π–π stacking peak at ∼3.8 Å and (h00) peaks along both qz and qxy could be observed, indicating highly orientated crystallites in the film, which is ascribed to the mutual orientation of polymer backbones on both crystal surfaces along the c-axis of the TCB crystals during the crystallization process by fast cooling. Benefiting from the strong anisotropy, the as-fabricated P3HT film exhibited a high room-temperature S2σ of ∼37.5 μW m−1 K−2 along the parallel direction, which was much higher than the value along the parallel direction (∼12.5 μW m−1 K−2) and the conventional drop-casted P3HT film with a much weaker anisotropy (∼15 μW m−1 K−2), as shown in Fig. 8(e).88 Such a high S2σ mainly resulted from the carrier hopping conduction between two ordered regions, which follows the quasi-1D hopping model as illustrated by the inset in Fig. 8(e).88 Furthermore, a peak S2σ of ∼62.4 μW m−1 K−2 at 365 K could be achieved in the TCB-treated P3HT film along the parallel direction,88 indicating great potential for applying to flexible thermoelectric devices. In addition to P3HT films, other organic-fiber-based thermoelectric films were developed. It was reported that ultrathin PEDOT NWs-based films were fabricated by filtering and drying PEDOT NWs/methanol mixture solution, which exhibited a high σ of ∼540 S cm−1, an enhanced S of ∼28 μW K−1, and a high S2σ of ∼35.8 μW m−1 K−2 by a 5 min hydrazine treatment.87 Besides, freestanding PPy nanotube films were prepared by a template method, which showed a ZT is 7.84 × 10−4 at 370 K.86

Currently, the highly orientated organic films have been preliminarily applied in thermoelectric devices to evaluate their thermoelectric potential. Fig. 8(f) shows an optical image of printed PEDOT:PSS film on a polyimide substrate.53 As shown by the inset SEM image, the as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS film possesses a highly orientation along the in-plane direction, which was mainly derived from the treatment by EG, H2SO4, and tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE). The pre-treatment by EG led to sufficient elimination of excess non-ionized PSS, and created a clear path for further H2SO4 post-treatment, which induced a structural conformation transition of the conjugated carbon chains in PEDOT:PSS films, resulting in a highly ordered morphology.52 Furthermore, the post-treatment by TDAE tuned the oxidation level of the as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS films, contributing to a high S2σ of ∼224 μW m−1 K−2 at 300 K.53Fig. 8(g) describes the F-TEGs based on these PEDOT:PSS films.53 To fabricate the F-TEG, 5 free-standing EG–H2SO4–TDAE-treated PEDOT:PSS films were stuck to form one thermoelectric element using conductive Ag paste, and 5 thermoelectric legs interlace through a layer of flexible polyimide substrate to keep a flexible feature of the TEG.53 Each pair of legs was connected by Cu wire,53 and the as-treated PEDT:PSS films were underneath the black films, which represented the solar energy absorbers.53 By a ΔT of 44.5 K induced by harvesting sunlight, a high output power density of 3 μW cm−2 could be achieved, as shown in Fig. 8(g).53 These results indicate that by efficient sunlight-to-electricity conversion, the as-designed thermoelectric module can be potentially used to power microwatt electronic products.
In addition to the orientated organic films discussed above, there were other types of 2D organic thermoelectric materials based on 1D organic fibers, such as thermoelectric networks and mats. It was reported that the P3HT nanofiber networks were fabricated by a combination of oxidative chemical polymerization (synthesize P3HT), Whisker method (form nanofibers from the bulk polymer),317,318 and drop-casting on plastic substrates (form networks).89 A ZT of ∼0.0026 was obtained at 300 K, derived from rationally doping by silver perchlorate, which tuned the oxidation level of the networks.89 Similarly, through building bulk interpenetrating networks of conjugated poly(3-butylthiophene)/polystyrene (P3BT/PS) polymers in insulating supporting matrix, a ZT of 0.8 × 10−4 could be achieved at room temperature when 40 wt% P3BT was introduced, mainly derived from a reduced κ and an enhanced σ.109 Besides, by a combination of aqueous solution and drop-casting method, a P3HT nanofiber mat with high crystallinity was fabricated, which exhibited an ultralow κ of only ∼0.07 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K.90
4 Inorganic/organic hybrid fibers
Compared with rigid inorganic thermoelectric fibers, organic thermoelectric fibers and organic-fiber-based thermoelectric films have exhibited outstanding flexibility and high cost-effectiveness, making them good candidates to be employed in wearable thermoelectric devices for personal use. However, their thermoelectric properties are still relatively low and need further improvement, as shown in Fig. 2. To simultaneously achieve high performance and flexibility, one feasible solution is to design inorganic/organic hybrid fibers and hybrid-fiber-based films. Generally, such unique hybrid fibers can be fabricated by incorporating nanoscale inorganic materials into a conductive polymer matrix, which exhibits a typical 1D feature. Conversely, the hybrid-fiber-based films were typical 2D materials. Currently, the mechanism of the enhancement in thermoelectric performance by combining organic and inorganic materials is still under debate, derived from the considerable difficulty in proving the underlying physics. First-principle calculations indicated that both polymer morphology and interfacial charge transfer dominate over energy-dependent scattering in organic–inorganic hybrid thermoelectrics.319
So far, two major inorganic materials have been successfully incorporated into the polymer matrix, namely the carbon-based nanomaterials (such as CNTs and graphene fibers),56,61,110 and the semiconductor-based nanomaterials (such as Te nanorods and Bi2Te3 NWs).60,111 CNTs have been widely regarded as one of the most effective fillers in the polymer matrix,56,60,110 derived from their large aspect ratio (leading to high σ) and relatively high S realized by rationally doping. In the polymer matrix, CNTs are connected by van der Waals forces. Because there are conducting polymer particles at the CNT junctions, their molecular vibrational spectrum does not match that of the CNTs, which hinders the transmission of phonons at the junctions and in turn, reduces κ. In contrast, these junctions provide a continuous tunnel for electron transports without obvious obstructions, leading to high σ. Such a decoupling effect enabld the CNTs to exhibit high σ and S when the CNTs were used as fillers in the conducting polymer, while κ remained relatively stable. In terms of semiconductor-based nanomaterials such as NWs and nanotubes, because of their high S2σ (especially for their high S since the S value of the conducting polymers are relatively low) and strong organic solubility at room temperature,287 it is effective to mix these nanomaterials with polymer matrix to improve S2σ. Besides, κ of these composite materials is always low, which is even comparable to that of the organic polymers. This is because the bonding and vibrational spectra between the organic and inorganic materials are completely different. Therefore, developing inorganic/organic hybrid fibers and hybrid-fiber-based films are promising and of significance for practical application.
4.1 1D hybrid fibers
There are several ways to realize 1D inorganic/organic hybrid fibers.320 SWCNT/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite fibers were fabricated by a wet-spinning method.72 By doping SWCNTs with PEI, the p-type composite fibers could be made into n-type,72 and S2σ of ∼378 and ∼289 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in the as-fabricated p- and n-type fibers.72 Furthermore, a F-TEG that consisted of 12 pairs of p- and n-type composite fibers exhibited an output power of 0.61 μW by a ΔT of 10 K.72 In addition to doping inorganic fibers, post-treatments were used to make the p-type composite fibers into n-type. By a conventional wet-spinning process, CNT/PEDOT:PSS composite fibers were fabricated.56 Post-treatments, including immersion in hydrazine solutions and PEI-infiltration, were employed to make the p-type composite fibers into n-type, and S2σ of ∼83.2 and ∼113 μW m−1 K−2 were achieved in the p- and n-type fibers.56 By assembling 12 pairs of p- and n-type fibers into a F-TEG, a ΔT of 10 K could contribute to an output power of 0.43 μW.56
In addition to fabricating simple F-TEGs discussed above, 1D inorganic/organic hybrid fibers can be further assembled into 3D wearable textiles for powering electronics by harvesting thermal energy from the human body.320Fig. 9(a) illustrates a fabrication of thermoelectric textiles with n-type PEI/CNTY and p-type PEDOT:PSS/CNTY.21 The CNTY was first wrapped on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plate. After that, the CNTY/PET roll was soaked in PEDOT:PSS solution to form one side into p-type, and the other side was soaked in PEI/ethanol solution to become n-type. Finally, the as-fabricated p–n composite fibers were twisted with a PET filament, forming thermoelectric yarns. Fig. 9(b) illustrates the warp-knitted spacer fabric shaped thermoelectric textiles.21 The as-fabricated thermoelectric textiles possess 966 p–n pairs with high flexibility and excellent air permeability, which are ideal candidates for assembling wearable F-TEGs that signify their good conformability with the human skin.21 The as-designed F-TEGs can be bent, twisted, and compressed arbitrarily without deteriorating their thermoelectric performance.21Fig. 9(c) shows the thermoelectric output power density and output voltage of the as-designed F-TEGs, from which a high output power density of 5.15 μW cm−2 can be achieved at a ΔT of 47.5 K.21

In addition to the immersion method discussed above, deposition is another suitable way to realize thermoelectric textiles based on inorganic/organic hybrid fibers. Fig. 9(d) illustrates a fabrication of the thermoelectric yarn by depositing inorganic thermoelectric materials on an electro-spun PAN nanofiber sheet.69 Flexible sheets composed of highly aligned PAN nanofibers were first fabricated by an extrusion process. After that, the as-fabricated nanofiber sheets were sequentially sputtered by Sb2Te3–gold–Bi2Te3 on both sides by a stencil-mask-based method, resulting in alternating p-Au-n segments. Finally, sheets were twisted by an electric motor to form a tiger yarn with a (Au/Bi2Te3/Au/Sb2Te3)n structure, as shown in Fig. 9(e).69 Based on these unique tiger yarns, plain-weave thermoelectric textiles were fabricated, as shown in Fig. 9(f).69 The as-designed textiles exhibit an output power density of 856 μW cm−2 at a ΔT of 200 K in the direction of textile thickness.69
Similar to the deposition method, painting or printing are also feasible ways to fabricate hybrid-fiber-based thermoelectric textiles. Fig. 9(g) illustrates the fabrication of wet-spun PEDOT:PSS/Te NW composite fibers.64 As-fabricated fibers were first placed in a coagulation bath, and then twisted with a polymer rod that provides structural stability and mechanical support. Fig. 9(h) illustrates the fabrication of thermoelectric fibers by periodically coating with Ag paste.64 The coated parts act as n-type segments and the uncoated parts are p-type. The as-designed p–n fibers are woven and integrated into the fabric for wearable thermoelectric application, as shown in Fig. 9(i).64 The thermoelectric fabric exhibited a high S2σ of ∼78.1 μW m−1 K−2.64 Besides, the fibers with a Te NW content of <30 wt% exhibited good bending performance, and a measured stress value of ∼135 MPa could be achieved at a applied strain of ∼7%, indicating good mechanical property.64 In terms of the F-TEG based on such advanced hybrid fibers, a thermoelectric fabric was assembled by weaving the fibers into a commercial textile, which exhibited a high mass-specific power of 9.48 μW g−1.64
4.2 2D hybrid-fiber-based films
In addition to directly applying the inorganic/organic hybrid fibers in flexible F-TEGs, hybrid fibers can be assembled into 2D composite films by various fabrication techniques to expand their application and further improve their performance.320 Theoretically, there are mainly two ways to achieve such composite films: one is doping and/or post-treating the inorganic-fiber-based sheets/nets/films by organic solutions, from which the inorganic part acts as a substrate and provides the flexibility. The other method is incorporating inorganic fibers as fillers into the conductive polymer matrix,287 from which the organic part acts as substrate and provides the flexibility. However, for most of the hybrid-fiber-based composite films, both organic and inorganic parts provide the flexibility and thermoelectric performance. Therefore, they always show high flexibility and high properties. The inorganic part includes carbon-based fibers such as CNTs,60,61,66,67,70,71,73,75,76,91–94,146,321 graphene,146,322 reduced graphene oxide (rGO),95 semiconductor-based fibers such as Te NWs,68,96 Cu1.75Te NWs,65 Bi2Te3 NWs,125 and oxide-based fibers such as BaTiO3;323,324 while the organic part includes epoxy,40,59,68,146,147,321,325,326 PPy,93–95 PEDOT,96 PEDOT:PSS,60,61,68,70,75 PAN,327 PANI,66,71,73,76,92,322 P3HT,66,91 poly(3-octylthiophene) (P3OT),57 PVDF,65 polyurethane/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PU/PMMA),323,324 waterborne polyurethane (WPU),61 and poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV).67
Doping and/or post-treating the inorganic-fiber-based sheets/nets/films by organic solutions is a suitable way to achieve freestanding hybrid-fiber-based composite materials, from which the inorganic fibers acts as a substrate and provides the flexibility. Fig. 10(a) illustrates a fabrication of the Au-doped CNT/polymer web.66 By a direct spinning method, CNT networks with both high σ and high μ were first fabricated, and the introduction of Au nanoparticles further improved the ZT of CNT networks from 0.079 to 0.163 at room temperature. Based on such Au-doped CNT webs, the introduction of PANI enabled the webs to be porous hybrids with a significantly improved flexibility, as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 10(b).66 Benefiting from the incorporation of PANI, the triggered energy-filtering effect significantly improved the S of the webs, and the phonon-scattering effect simultaneously reduced κ, leading to a further improved ZT of 0.203.66 In terms of the F-TEG, the thermoelectric module was composed of Au-doped CNT/PANI webs as p-type materials and polyethyleneimine-doped CNT webs as n-type materials. Both types of webs were alternatively attached on flexible plastic substrates by a wet transfer method.66 The webs were electrically connected by Ag paste through dispensing equipment.66Fig. 10(c) shows the output power and voltage of the as-fabricated F-TEG,66 from which the F-TEG with 7 p–n couples could result in an output power of 1.74 μW at a ΔT of 20 K. Other works indicated that th SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS-coated Te nanorod composite films were fabricated by vacuum filtration method.60 The as-fabricated films exhibited a S2σ of 104 μW m−1 K−2, derived from a high σ of 332 S cm−1 and a S of 56 μV K−1.60 A F-TEG based on these composite films was designed, and showed an output voltage of 5.6 mV and an output power of 53.6 nW at a ΔT of 44 K.60

Incorporating inorganic fibers as fillers into the conductive polymer matrix is another suitable way to achieve hybrid-fiber-based composite materials,287 from which the organic part acts as a substrate and provides flexibility. Fig. 10(d) illustrates the fabrication of the PEDOT:PSS/Te NW aerogel composite film by a combination of vacuum freeze drying and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor annealing treatment.68 By a vacuum freeze drying method, porous 3D crosslinking PEDOT:PSS aerogel networks with hydrothermally synthesized Te NWs as fillers were first fabricated. This was followed by a pressing process, which made these networks into films. After that, a DMSO vapor annealing treatment was applied to these hybrids, which could further optimize their thermoelectric properties. In the as-fabricated aerogel films, there are two potential charge carrier-transport mechanisms that are responsible for the electrical transportation, which can be described by the series and parallel, as shown in Fig. 10(e and f).68 Such unique aerogel films exhibited a ZT of 0.02 at room temperature. Besides, during the reciprocating bended process from 0 to 180°, the σ of the PEDOT:PSS aerogel films did not change significantly, while the S only presented a small increase during bending, indicating good flexibility and performance stability.68 Furthermore, a F-TEG was assembled by alternately connecting p-type PEDOT:PSS-based aerogel films and n-type CNT fibers in series, and the connections were linked by Ag paste.68 The as-designed F-TEG based on these aerogel films showed an output power of 1.28 μW at a ΔT of 60 K, indicating their potential to be applied in wearable electronics.68 Similar aerogels based on graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites were also reported with an ultralow κ of ∼0.056 W m−1 K−1, which resulted in a ZT of ∼0.001 at room temperature.146
Sometimes, both organic fibers and inorganic fibers were rationally mixed to form composite-fiber-based films. In this situation, both organic fibers and inorganic fibers act as substrates and provide flexibility. Fig. 10(g) illustrates the fabrication of the PEDOT/Te NW composite film by a combination of aqueous solution and vacuum filtering.96 The synthesis of PEDOT NWs was based on a typical aqueous solution method, from which DMSO was added to a PEDOT NW solution to improve their dispersion. After that, the PEDOT NW solution was mixed with Te NW solution by ultrasonication, and a typical composite film could be achieved by a combination of vacuum filtering and drying. Fig. 10(h) shows a SEM image of the composite film with 70 wt% Te NWs, in which the two types of fibers were entangled with each other. The inset of Fig. 10(h) shows the band structures and band alignment at the interface of PEDOT NWs and Te NWs,96 indicating that the triggered energy filtering effect is a key factor on the improvement of S2σ (up to ∼30 μW m−1 K−2) in the composites, as shown in Fig. 10(i).96 Similar methods were used to fabricate PPy nanotube/rGO hybrid films, which exhibited a S2σ of ∼7.28 μW m−1 K−2 at 300 K.95
5 Thermoelectric fabric
Natural fibers, such as wool and cotton thread, are commonly used for fabricating wearable textiles due to their good moisture absorption, air permeability, and dyeing ability. At the same time, man-made fibers such as nylon, cellulose, acrylic, and polyester have exhibited mature manufacturing technique, high stability, and sufficient flexibility, which generally have properties similar to those of natural fibers. Considering that both natural and man-made fibers possess high flexibility, high stability, and low cost, employing these fibers as flexible substrate to fabricate thermoelectric fabrics is a promising way to realize high cost-effective and high wearability thermoelectric F-TEGs, which have been intensively studied in recent decades.78,80–82,100,328–331
Generally, there are several ways to fabricate thermoelectric fabrics. On the one hand, these fabrics can be used as flexible substrates for supporting inorganic thermoelectric bulks/films27,83,332 and thermoelectric yarns,64 such as the case shown in Fig. 9(i). On the other hand, these fabrics can be directly modified to possess thermoelectric features, such as infiltration or depositing/coating thermoelectric materials on their surfaces.22,61,99,101 Compared with the F-TEGs based on all-thermoelectric-fibers, the unique “composite” F-TEGs that consist of both thermoelectric materials and natural/man-made fabrics show great potential due to their potentially higher wearability and productivity.
5.1 Fabric as a pure flexible substrate
In the design of traditional thermoelectric devices, using flexible fabrics instead of solid ceramics as the substrates can make the thermoelectric devices have a certain degree of flexibility, thereby expanding the applications of the thermoelectric devices. n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 and p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 were fabricated by screen-printing on flexible fiber glass fabrics.83 The methyl cellulose was employed as a suitable binder additive to offer suitable viscosity for printability,83 contributing to reduce the electrical resistivity. The as-printed p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 showed a high ZT of 0.65, and the n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 exhibited a high ZT of 0.81,83 respectively. In terms of the F-TEG, Fig. 11(a) shows the concept views of a F-TEG based on dispenser-printed inorganic materials on the fabric.332 The fabric acted as the substrate of the F-TEG, and the conductive thread linked the dispenser-printed n–p thermoelectric materials, both providing the flexibility. Fig. 11(b) shows optical images of a 20-couple F-TEG printed with n–p Bi2Te3 100-mesh powder.332 The as-designed F-TEG can be worn on the human body, showing good flexibility. By a ΔT of 30 K, an output voltage of ∼25 mV and an output power of >2 μW could be realized.332 Similarly, Fig. 11(c) shows an optical image of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 dots on a glass fabric.27 The fabrics with n–p inorganic dots can be assembled into flexible thick films with ZTs of ∼0.33 for the n-type Bi2Te3 and ∼0.28 for the p-type Sb2Te3 at 300 K.27 In the typical fabrication of a F-TEG, Cu electrodes were prepared on a Ni/SiO2/Si substrate to form plates. In order to reduce the contact resistance, a Ni layer was further deposited on Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 thick films. After that, a top plate/thick film/bottom plate structure was fabricated by bonding these components using Ag paste, and PDMS was also infiltrated into the gap between the top and bottom plates. Then, Ni peel-off in DI water was used to remove the top and bottom plates, while the remaining Ni layers were further removed by etching in a diluted mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid.27 Such a unique light-weight and thin F-TEG exhibits a high output power density of 3800 μW cm−2 and 28000 μW g−1 at a ΔT of 50 K.27 The as-designed wearable F-TEG could be applied in medical sensor systems and smart watches. In addition to the glass fabric, nanostructured Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3 were deposited on both sides of a silk fabric to form a 12-coupled F-TEG, which showed an output voltage of ∼10 mV and an output power of ∼15 nW at a ΔT of 35 K.333

5.2 Modified thermoelectric fabrics
In addition to providing the flexibility for the F-TEGs, fabrics after rational modifications can exhibit thermoelectric features that act as thermoelectric materials. To achieve this goal, methods such as infiltration or depositing/coating thermoelectric materials on the surfaces of fabrics were employed.22,99,101Fig. 11(d) shows the optical and SEM images of a polyester fabric after coating by PEDOT:PSS, and the F-TEGs based on these PEDOT:PSS-coated polyester fabrics.101 The coating treatment was based on a solution method, and the commercial polyester fabrics after coating maintained the softness and good flexibility.101 A F-TEG was further fabricated by connecting the PEDOT:PSS-coated fabric strips with fine metal wires, which exhibited an output voltage of ∼4.3 mV at a ΔT of 75.2 K.101 Therefore, such thermoelectric fabrics possess considerable potential for fabricating self-powered wearable electronics and power generating clothing. Similarly, PEDOT:PSS/cellulose fabric composites were fabricated by solvent evaporation of the PEDOT:PSS solution, and the F-TEG based on such composites showed an output power density of ∼4500 μW cm−2 mg−1 at a ΔT of 50 K.77 Other work indicates that a F-TEG based on p-type PEDOT:PSS-coated cotton fabrics and n-type CNT fibers treated by PEI exhibits an output power of 375 μW at a ΔT of 60 K.97
In addition to conducting polymers, inorganic nanomaterials were used to coat organic thermoelectric fabrics. It was reported that by an unbalanced magnetron sputtering method, commercial ubiquitous cellulose-fiber-based papers were deposited by both n- and p-type Bi2Te3 alloys.99 The papers were cheap and abundant, which consisted of randomly oriented cellulose fibers. Fig. 11(e) illustrates the carrier transport in the composite film consisting of Bi2Te3/cellulose fibers,99 in which the potential energy barrier scattering effect occurred at the Bi2Te3/cellulose interfaces. This was mainly caused by the thin oxide layers.99 As a result, a promising ZT of ∼0.38 could be achieved at 473 K in the Bi2Te3/cellulose fiber composite films.99Fig. 11(f) shows a designed F-TEG based on these composite films, and its application in harvesting heat from a hemispherical light-bulb.99 The as-designed F-TEG with 12 pairs of n–p couples could show a high output voltage of ∼0.144 V at a ΔT of 50 K.99 In addition to Bi2Te3, n-type Ag2Te nanocrystals and p-type PEDOT:PSS were separately coated onto nylon fibers, and the as-designed F-TEG showed an output power of ∼5 nW at a ΔT of 20 K.334 Besides, by a typical infiltration method, p- and n-type SWCNT networks were incorporated into cellulose fibers to fabricate F-TEGs, which showed an output voltage of ∼16.8 mV and an output power of ∼75.5 nW at a ΔT of 50 K.98
3D woven thermoelectric textiles have exhibited great potential for applying in wearable F-TEGs, as shown in Fig. 9. To further improve their stability and wearability, modified 3D thermoelectric textiles were designed. Fig. 11(g) illustrates the fabrication of alternately doped CNTs wrapped with acrylic fibers.22 The p-type sections of CNTs were realized by hybridizing with PEDOT:PSS, while the n-type sections of CNTs were achieved by doping with oleamine using an electrospray method. The as-fabricated p–n CNTs were then wrapped with acrylic fiber to improve their stability. Through weaving these wrapped CNT fibers into π-type thermoelectric modules, a freestanding and stretchable 3D F-TEG was realized, as shown in Fig. 11(h). Fig. 11(i) shows the output power/voltage of woven fabric F-TEG.22 The as-designed woven-fiber-based F-TEG exhibits a high output power density of 7 μW cm−2 at a ΔT of 44 K.22 Furthermore, an excellent stretchability of ∼80% strain can be achieved in the as-designed F-TEG without sacrificing the thermoelectric performance,22 indicating that such unique F-TEG possessed great potential for charging wearable/portable electronics.
6 Challenges and outlook
Owing to the unique characteristics such as lightness, softness, good comfort, excellent energy conversion performance, and high integration, thermoelectric fibers/fabrics and related TEGs have shown considerable possibilities and huge application potentials in various fields for different consumer groups, which are definitely changing the world. With the fast development of computational science and fabrication techniques, the thermoelectric properties of thermoelectric fibers and related materials have been significantly improved, as summarized in Table 1. An ultrahigh S2σ of ∼6500 μW m−1 K−2 was reported in flexible Sb2Te3/PAN nanofibers,69 while an outstanding ZT up to ∼2 at 862 K was reported in single-crystal SnSe-based core fibers,15 which are competitive to many high-performance inorganic bulk materials.1,5,179,191,247,271,335–339 The development of such thermoelectric fiber/fabrics with related TEGs benefits the development of multiple industries, such as military industry, medical care, leisure and entertainment, and decoration, and is related to the national economy and human livelihood.

Despite the rapid development of thermoelectric fibers and related materials in recent years, they still face significant challenges in both performance and application. For inorganic fibers, the weak flexibility considerably limits their applications in wearable thermoelectric devices, and the issues such as high toxicity and high cost still need significant attention during the design and application. For organic fibers, their thermoelectric properties are noticeably lower than that of the inorganic fibers, and the mechanism of further improving their performance is not mature enough with a certain limitation. For hybrid fibers, to achieve a balance between flexibility and performance is still tricky. Besides, many strategies can lead to high ZTs in a narrow temperature range, which limit the overall energy conversion. It is of significance to find or develop materials with wider operating temperature ranges.4 In terms of the TEGs based on thermoelectric fiber/fabrics, there is an urgent need at present to realize highly integrated, multi-functional, low-cost, safe, and durable TEGs to make it more humane during the usage. Therefore, the design of fiber/fabric-based TEGs should focus on the balance between performance, stability, and flexibility, which is a tough work that needs intensive studies in the future. Generally, there is still a long way to go before the commercialization of fiber/fabric-based TEGs.
In terms of the outlook of the future development of thermoelectric fibers and fabrics, as illustrated in Fig. 12, the following topics should be significantly improved:

(1) Performance improvement. For fiber-based thermoelectrics, with the aim to achieve high-energy conversion efficiency, the fundamental mechanisms (including boosting the carrier transport and strengthening the phonon scattering) need further exploring, and the adaptability between different components in hybrids should be carefully evaluated. For TEGs based on fibers or fabrics, to realize a high output power, a rational design is needed, which should simultaneously consider the factors including device topology, integration, working mode, boundary condition, and influencing factor.1 Computational assistance such as finite element numerical simulation is helpful for rationally designing the as-required TEGs. In addition, it is necessary to improve the various physical properties of the fibers and fabrics to keep a stable thermoelectric performance, especially the tensile flexibility and spinnability. There are several ways to achieve this goal, such as designing/optimizing fabrication techniques and rational doping or modification treatments.
(2) Personal thermal management. Currently, an increasing number of researchers are beginning to pay attention to the research of human body thermal management materials and clothing, hoping to realize the automatic regulation of human body surface temperature and effective use of body surface waste heat, and finally realize a clothing system with intelligent personal thermal management (PTM).344–346 To achieve this goal, wearable F-TEGs based on 1D thermoelectric fibers, 2D fiber-based films, and 3D woven thermoelectric yarns and textiles are good candidates as key components to realize the body heat harvesting for power generation or refrigeration to keep a safe temperature for human body. However, the currently known PTM-based thermoelectric materials and devices still face the problem of single function in temperature adjustment, and it is difficult to cope with the complicated and changeable external environment. In terms of heat capture, they face the problems of low conversion efficiency and difficulty in practical application.
(3) Biofiber-based thermoelectrics. Biofibers such as spider silks possess many unique features that cannot be realized by the current technique. Therefore, exploring the potential combination between biofibers and thermoelectrics is interesting and of significance. A preliminary study indicated that spider silk fibers possess complex components such as crystalline β-sheets and amorphous structural regions, providing opportunities for thermoelectric modification.347 It was reported that pyrolized spider silk could exhibit a S of >20 μV K−1 at 300 K,347 indicating the potential for further studies on thermoelectrically functionalized natural and synthetic protein polymers for unconventional applications.
(4) Standardization and productivity. Thermoelectric fiber/fabric-based TEG is still a relatively new type of product. Although there are some company products on the market, there is still no standard that is generally recognized in the industry. In addition to formulating basic safety requirements for wearable products, it is necessary to formulate relevant standards for some technical issues (such as the scope of material use). A determination of industry specifications is conducive to the development of thermoelectric fiber/fabric-based TEGs. In addition to the standardization, the productivity of thermoelectric fiber/fabric and related TEGs still needs improvement. Using natural and/or man-made fibers as raw materials is a suitable way to realize a boost in the productivity of thermoelectric fibers and fabrics.
(5) Broadening the application such as 5G. The development of new technologies, such as 5G, provides more opportunities for the application of fiber-based thermoelectrics. It was pointed out that one of the key components in 5G operation is the optical module, which can realize optical and electrical conversion. However, one significant issue for the optical module is that the optical chip is sensitive to the heat, and the high temperature can reduce the optical output power, as well as the service life of the optical chip. To solve this issue, developing stable and high-performance thermoelectric coolers is of significance, and fiber-based thermoelectrics have exhibited great potential to fulfill the requirement due to their unique features such as good thermoelectric performance at low temperatures and high flexibility to target different application environments. In addition to 5G, fiber-based thermoelectrics show considerable potential for applying in other applications, such as medical, military, aerospace, and thermocells.348
