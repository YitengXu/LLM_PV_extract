    , Accepted 9th December 2017First published on 12th December 2017AbstractTo observe a clear-cut example of the formation of mobile carriers from excitons on semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) surrounded by a medium with a high dielectric constant, water-dispersible s-SWCNT nanocomposites were fabricated by physical modifications using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers that contain an aliphatic core. The evolution of H2 from water using these s-SWCNT/dendrimer nanocomposites as photosensitizers under irradiation with visible light demonstrated a photo-induced electron transfer from the s-SWCNTs to the co-catalysts.
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) represent potentially strong optical absorbers with tunable absorption bands that depend on their chiral indices (n,m).1 However, so far, their application to the conversion of solar energy into electric energy remains difficult, due to the large binding energy (>100 meV) of the electron–hole pairs, i.e., the so-called excitons, which are generated upon optical absorption.2 Recent developments of photovoltaic devices that contain SWCNTs as light-absorbing components have shown that the creation of heterojunctions by pairing chirality-controlled SWCNTs with C60 is a key for high power-conversion efficiencies.3 In contrast to thin film devices, photosensitizing reactions in dispersion or solution via the photo-induced electron transfer triggered by the photo-excitation of SWCNTs remain scarce due to the difficulties associated with the construction of well-ordered surfaces on SWCNTs. Recently, we have developed water-dispersible coaxial nanowires that contain a SWCNT/C60 heterojunction, which can be used as a photosensitizer to produce H2 from water.4 The photosensitizing properties of SWCNTs were discovered using chirality-selective photo-excitation upon irradiation with monochromatic light at λirr = 680 nm, which corresponds to the E22 absorption of (8,3)SWCNT.5 However, it remains unclear whether the C60 layer is necessary for the dissociation of excitons on the SWCNT. As the exciton binding energy strongly depends on the surrounding dielectric constant (ε) of the environment, the dissociation of the electron–hole pair on SWCNTs should be facilitated in aqueous (εH2O = 80) dispersion systems,6,7 relative to the case of photovoltaic film devices, wherein SWCNTs are surrounded by the acceptor C60 (εC60 = 4.4).8 These considerations prompted us to investigate the fabrication of water-dispersible SWCNT/dendrimer supramolecular nanohybrids that do not contain a C60 intermediate layer, and their photosensitizing properties. Herein, we describe the first example of SWCNT photosensitizers that do not contain C60 for the evolution of H2 from water.
To obtain a water-dispersible SWCNT/dendrimer nanocomposite that does not contain a SWCNT/C60 heterojunction, we designed poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (COO−) and dendrimer (NH3+), which exhibit a 1,10-bis(decyloxy)decane core (Scheme 1). We have already reported that the physical modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with dendrimer (COO−) leads to the formation of stable dispersions of CNT/dendrimer nanohybrids in water due to the strong adsorption of the oligomethylene chain on the lateral surface of the CNTs.9
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers with COO− or NH3+ terminals. Reaction conditions: (i) KOH, THF, rt, 3 h; (ii) (CH2)2(NH2)2, MeOH, 2 d, rt; (iii) HClaq, rt, 1 h. 
After saponification of dendrimer (COOMe) using KOH in THF, water-soluble dendrimer (COO−) was obtained quantitatively. Dendrimer (NH3+) was obtained from the amidation of dendrimer (COOMe), using an excess of ethylenediamine and hydrochloric acid in methanol (for experimental details, see ESI†). The structures of dendrimer (COO−) and dendrimer (NH3+) were confirmed by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopy.
To explore the photosensitizing properties of the SWCNT itself, dendritic dispersants dendrimer (COO−) or dendrimer (NH3+), which do not exhibit absorption bands in the vis-NIR region, were used for the fabrication of SWCNT/dendrimer supramolecular nanocomposites with an anionic (COO−) or a cationic (NH3+) surface, respectively (Fig. 1a). In a typical run, a solution of dendrimer (COO−) (1.0 mg, 1.0 mmol) in H2O (5 mL) was treated with SWCNTs (1.0 mg), before being sonicated with a bath-type sonicator at T < 25 °C. Subsequent centrifugation (3000 G) of the thus obtained suspension for 30 min afforded a stock solution of SWCNT/dendrimer supramolecular nanocomposites in the form of a black solution.

The formation of supramolecular nanocomposites was confirmed by Raman, absorption, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, as well as by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the Raman spectra of pristine SWCNTs (HiPco), SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−), and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+). Samples were prepared by drop casting solutions of the respective supramolecular nanocomposites onto a glass microscope slide, followed by drying in air prior to the measurement. For all samples, the graphitic (G) (∼1590 cm−1) and disorder (D) bands (∼1300 cm−1) were measured. Since the D band at (∼1300 cm−1) of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) or SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) did not significantly increase in intensity compared to pristine SWCNT, the formation of the supramolecular nanohybrids SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) should be attributed to the noncovalent functionalization of the lateral surface of the SWCNTs. Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of the individual supramolecular nanocomposites in D2O. The characteristic absorption bands derived from the SWCNTs appeared at 300–1350 nm, indicating the presence of isolated individual SWCNTs in the water dispersion. Fig. 2 shows the AFM images of the SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) nanocomposites. These supramolecular nanocomposites exhibited diameters of approximately 1.6 nm [SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−)] and 1.2 nm [SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+)]. Given that the thickness of the pristine SWCNTs (HiPco) used in this study (0.8–1.2 nm), it seems likely that individual nanotubes are wrapped by dendrimer (COO−) or dendrimer (NH3+) to form the observed supramolecular nanocomposites. TEM images of the SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) also support the physical modification of SWCNTs, although the agglomeration was formed on the TEM grid during the air-drying step (Fig. S2, ESI†). The isolation of individual SWCNTs was corroborated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements, i.e., the emissions from individual SWCNTs were observed in 2D PL intensity maps of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) in D2O (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the emission intensity of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) is higher than that of SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+), as the ability of dendrimer (COO−) to debundle SWCNTs via the formation of supramolecular nanocomposites is higher than that of dendrimer (NH3+).

To examine the photosensitizing properties of SWCNTs, the evolution of H2 from H2O using SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) or SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) as photosensitizers was explored in accordance with previous reports employing SWCNT/fullerodendron supramolecular nanocomposites.4a,c In a typical run, an aqueous Tris–HCl buffer solution (3.5 mL, pH = 7.5, 5 mM) of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) or SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) (0.125 mL), 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, 38.6 mg, 1.8 × 10−4 mol), methyl viologen dichloride (MV2+, 92.4 mg, 3.6 × 10−4 mol), and colloidal PVP–Pt (15 mL in H2O; Pt content: 6.6 × 10−2 μmol) were dissolved in distilled H2O in a Pyrex reactor. The solution was diluted to a final volume of 150 mL using distilled H2O. The reaction mixture was degassed five times and purged with Ar. Upon vigorous stirring, the solution was irradiated with a 300 W Xenon arc lamp (Ushio model UXL-500 W) using a band-pass filter (λ > 422 ± 5 nm: ASAHI SPECTRA CO, M.C. 422/10 nm 50 × 50). After a designated period, the cell containing the reaction mixture was connected to a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, TCD, molecular sieve 5A: 2.0 m × 3.0 mm, carrier gas: Ar) to measure the amount of H2 in the headspace of the reactor.

Fig. 4 shows plots of the total amount of H2 generated as a function of time using SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) (●). The reaction required a short induction period (30 min) due to the presence of a small amount of oxygen that can react with the radical cation of methyl viologen (MV˙+).10 Thereafter, H2 (3.7 μmol h−1) was generated with increasing activity upon photoirradiation (λ > 422 ± 5 nm) during 6 h. The H2-evolving activity of SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) (0.68 μmol h−1, Fig. 4 (■)) is lower than that of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−). On the other hand, in the absence of the co-catalyst (colloidal PVP–Pt) or the sacrificial donor BNAH, H2 was not generated. The difference in H2-evolving activity between SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) might be rationalized in terms of their negative and positive surface charges, respectively. The H2 productivity of this reaction might depend on the efficiency of the photo-induced electron transfer from the C1 band of the SWCNT to the LUMO of MV2+ that leads to the formation of MV˙+ (Fig. S3, ESI†). As the positively charged electron relay MV2+ can easily be adsorbed on the negative surface of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) by electrostatic interactions, the photo-induced electron transfer from the SWCNT-core of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) to MV2+ should proceed smoothly in marked contrast to SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+), which exhibits a positive surface (Fig. 5). As the result of the efficient formation of MV˙+, SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) shows higher efficiency in the photosensitized H2 evolution than SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+). It should be noted that both SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) act as photosensitizers for the evolution of H2 from H2O, despite the relatively high exciton binding energy (>100 meV) in SWCNTs. The dissociation of excitons in the SWCNT might occur with the aid of water as a medium that exhibits a high dielectric constant, and also with the help of MV2+, which could constitute a donor/acceptor heterojunction at the SWCNT surface. This result indicates that the static SWCNT/C60 heterojunction is not necessary for the exciton dissociation in SWCNTs. For a comparison between pristine SWCNT and the SWCNT/C60 heterojunctions, we evaluated the apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of their H2 evolution reactions by using SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/fullerodendron4a supramolecular nanocomposites. Under exposure to light of 650 nm wavelength, the SWCNT/C60 heterojunctions exhibited a AQY of 0.11 (SWCNT/fullerodendron), which is, as expected, higher than that of SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) (0.03).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the photo-induced evolution of H2 from H2O upon irradiation of SWCNT/dendrimer nanohybrids with visible light in the presence of an electron relay (MV2+), a co-catalyst (PVP–Pt), and a sacrificial donor (BNAH). As the dendritic dispersants dendrimer (COO−) and dendrimer (NH3+) are transparent for visible light, the photo-induced electron transfer from the SWCNT to MV2+ proceeds via dissociation of the exciton generated by the photo-excitation of the SWCNT. Hence, this result represents a clear-cut example of SWCNT photosensitizers in an aqueous system, i.e., the dissociation of the excitons in SWCNTs occurs smoothly even in the absence of well-ordered heterojunctions such as SWCNT/C60. The generation of free electrons might be affected by the high dielectric constant of water, which surrounds the SWCNTs, and by the formation donor/acceptor heterojunctions between SWCNTs and dissolved MV2+. To evaluate the potential contributions of these two possibilities, we will explore time-resolved kinetic studies, such as transient absorption experiments, in the near future. The observed drastic differences in the photosensitizing efficiency between SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) and SWCNT/dendrimer (NH3+) might be explained by the different surface concentration of MV2+ on the SWCNT/dendrimer nanohybrids, given that the negative charge on the SWCNT/dendrimer (COO−) should facilitate attractive electrostatic interactions with MV2+. We currently explore the use of SWCNT-based light absorbers in other photosensitizing systems in order to explore the kinetics and energetics of photo-induced electron transfer, and to generate more efficient and useful photocatalytic systems.
