    , Accepted 29th August 2019First published on 31st August 2019AbstractDifferent hierarchical structures of pure tin dioxide (SnO2), zinc doped SnO2 and zinc tin oxide (ZTO; Zn2SnO4) with zero, one and two-dimensional (0D, 1D and 2D) nano-building blocks were synthesized with deep eutectic precursors choline chloride:SnCl2 and choline chloride:ZnCl2. The synthesis was performed by the hydrothermal method. The effects of some synthesis parameters such as pH, temperature, type of solvent, type of Sn precursor, and the amount and type of Zn precursor were studied on the size, morphology and structure of the synthesized products. The products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and UV-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis techniques. In the next step, the performance of the synthesized metal oxides was investigated for the photocatalytic application. The as-prepared metal oxides were used as photocatalysts for the removal of methyl orange (MO) dye. The experiments showed that Zn doped SnO2 with a flower-like hierarchical morphology consisting of 2D petals with nanoscale thickness can remove MO from an aqueous environment with a degradation efficiency of 99.5% in 15 min.
Introduction
In the past decade, one of the most attractive areas of research has been the synthesis of wide-bandgap binary and ternary metal oxide materials with controllable sizes and shapes.1,2 In this context, tin dioxide (SnO2) is a typical n-type binary semiconductor metal oxide with a wide bandgap (3.6 eV) exhibiting great potential applications in many fields such as gas sensors,3,4 optoelectronic devices,5 transistors,6 dye-sensitized solar cells,7,8 lithium-ion batteries,9–11 supercapacitors12 and photocatalysis.2
Various low-dimensional morphologies of SnO2 nanostructures with zero-dimensionality (0D) (such as spherical nanoparticles),13,14 one-dimensionality (1D) (such as nanorods,15 nanobelts,16 nanowires17 and nanotubes18) and two-dimensionality (2D) (such as nanosheet structures19) have been revealed with different properties and applications.1,20 Self-assembly of different building blocks by low dimensionality (0D, 1D and 2D) can be performed successfully via interactions that result in the formation of various novel and complex three dimensional (3D) hierarchical architectures with remarkable properties.1,21,22 The conduction and valence bands of hierarchically assembled nanomaterials can be tuned by the reduction of their building block size at the nanoscale level and taking advantage of the quantum size effect.22 In this regard, the development of convenient synthetic strategies is essential to provide the desired property management.1 In the case of SnO2, the hydrothermal method is regarded as the most commonly applied method.1
For improving the efficiency of SnO2 materials for application in different fields, a lot of efforts have been made by doping, adding catalysts, and constructing heterojunctions.4 Among them, doping of SnO2-based nanomaterials has been proposed as an appropriate way to modify their morphologies and different properties.1,4 These new features can be due to the production of many oxygen vacancies with the influence of substitution of Sn ions by Zn ions.4 As reported, Zn-doped SnO2 hierarchical architectures can provide exciting properties such as gas sensing and photocatalytic properties.4
On the other hand, zinc stannate or zinc tin oxide (ZTO) (ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4) as a ternary semiconductor metal oxide has also received much attention in recent years. Compared to their binary counterparts (such as ZnO and SnO2), these ternary metal oxides have high electron mobility and electrical conductivity, interesting optical properties and good stability.23 Various morphological ZTO micro/nanostructures, such as 0D nanodots,24 1D nanowires,25 2D nanoplates or nanosheets,26 3D polyhedral and hierarchical structures besides hollow architectures,27,28 have been synthesized effectively to date. Different methods have been reported for the synthesis of ZTO micro/nanostructures.23 Between these, the hydrothermal/solvothermal method has been approved as an efficient and facile strategy for the synthesis of phase-pure and highly crystalline ZTO structures.23 ZTO-based micro/nanostructures with different morphologies can be desirable for the application in the fields of catalysis,29,30 gas sensing,27,31 anode materials for lithium batteries32 and solar cells.33
As reported in the literature, for the synthesis of SnO2, Zn doped SnO2 and ZTO structures, some external additives, such as C2H2O4·2H2O,34 CH3CO2Na·3H2O,2 NH4F,4 Na2HPO4·12H2O,35 glucose,36,37 urea, thiourea, ethyldiamine,38 CTAB,39 methenamine (HMT),40 NaF,41 H2C2O4,39 N2H4,42 PAA,43 and SDS,15 were used besides NH4OH,3,44–47 NaOH,48 KOH,49 H2SO450 or HCl51 that were used in some reports for pH adjustment.18
In the past decade, deep eutectic solvents (DESs), were introduced by Abbott and co-workers as a substitute for ionic liquids.52,53 DESs are mixtures of salts and complexing agents, having lower melting points than their individual components.54 Depending on the nature of the complexing agent, DESs can be classified into I–IV types.52 Type I (quaternary salt and metal halide), type II (quaternary salt and hydrated metal halide), type III (quaternary salt and hydrogen bond donor), and type IV (metal halide and hydrogen bond donor).55 The most common types of DES are gained by the complexation of a quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt (types I and II) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD) (type III).52 DESs possess many advantages.54 These solvents have also been used in the shape-controlled synthesis of metal and metal oxide structures because of the extended hydrogen-bond network in the liquid state of DESs that can form a highly structured “supramolecular” solvent.53
Herein, different hierarchical structures containing SnO2, Zn-doped SnO2 and Zn2SnO4 were synthesized by the hydrothermal method by using choline chloride:SnCl2 (ChCl:SnCl2) and choline chloride:ZnCl2 (ChCl:ZnCl2) as precursors for the first time without the addition of any other materials. The effects of some synthesis parameters such as pH, temperature, type of solvent, type of Sn precursor, and the amount and type of Zn precursor on the size and morphology of the synthesized products were studied. The products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), UV-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis techniques. The mechanism of product formation was investigated. Also, the performance of the synthesized metal oxides was investigated for their environmental application. The synthesized metal oxides were used as photocatalysts for the removal of methyl orange (MO) dye.
Experimental
Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Tin dichloride anhydrous (SnCl2, 98%, AR), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97%, Merck), zinc chloride anhydrous (ZnCl2, 98%, Merck), tin(II) chloride dehydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 98%, Merck), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), absolute ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.5%, Merck), choline chloride (ChCl, 99%, AR), urea (99.5%, Merck) and methyl orange (Merck) were purchased. In all synthesis experiments, deionized water was used.
Synthesis of ChCl:SnCl2 or ChCl:ZnCl2 DES
ChCl:SnCl2 or ChCl:ZnCl2 DES was prepared separately by gently stirring ChCl and SnCl2 or ZnCl2 at 100 °C until a clear, homogeneous liquid formed after 1 h. ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 ratios were 1:2 as reported in the literature.56
Synthesis of ChCl:urea
ChCl:urea DES was prepared by gently stirring ChCl and urea at 100 °C until a clear, homogeneous liquid formed after 1 h. The ChCl:urea ratio was 1:2 as reported in the literature.56
Synthesis of Zn containing SnO2 structures (Zn-doped SnO2 and ZTO)
In this work, the hydrothermal method was used for the synthesis of Zn containing SnO2 structures by varying the synthesis parameters such as solution pH, temperature, precursor type and solvent (Table 1). The products were synthesized at two different Zn/Sn molar ratios (1/10 and 1/1).

A typical synthesis procedure was as follows: 0.26 g of ChCl:SnCl2 and the appropriate amount of ChCl:ZnCl2 (0.02 or 0.20 g) were homogenized in 25 ml of deionized water under vigorous magnetic stirring. For investigation of the effect of pH on the size, morphology, and structure of the obtained products, the pH of the mixture was adjusted in the range of 1.0–13.0 by using HCl or NaOH solutions. The mixed solution was then transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at different temperatures in the range of 120–220 °C for a constant time of 24 h in order to obtain the precipitates. Subsequently, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The obtained powders were collected and washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol several times, respectively, and then dried in air at 60 °C for 12 h. Lastly, some of the products were annealed at 600 °C for 2 h.
The samples without and with calcination are named ZS0 and ZS1, respectively. The applied pH, temperature and Zn/Sn ratio were also described in the name as follows: for example, the synthesized Zn doped SnO2 structure samples at pH 2, 140 °C and 1/1 Zn/Sn molar ratio without and with calcination are named ZS0-2-140 (1/1) and ZS1-2-140 (1/1), respectively.
Some experiments were performed as controls. In some cases, the undoped SnO2 structures were obtained by the same method with the exception of the addition of ChCl:ZnCl2. For undoped SnO2, “Z” was omitted from the name.
Also, for studying the effect of the precursor's type on the obtained products, in some experiments, ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 were replaced with anhydrous SnCl2 and ZnCl2 or hydrated SnCl2·2H2O and ZnCl2·6H2O. In these cases, * and ** were added to the names for anhydrous SnCl2 and ZnCl2 and hydrated SnCl2·2H2O and ZnCl2·6H2O, respectively.
For investigation of the effect of solvent, synthesis of Zn doped SnO2 with a 1/1 Zn/Sn molar ratio was performed in different solvents such as a mixture of ethanol:water (1:1 v:v) and ChCl:urea DES, and also without solvent by the solvothermal method at pH 2.0.
Characterization techniques
FESEM images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4160 at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV equipped with an EDX spectrometer. XRD patterns were obtained by using a D8 ADVANCE type (BRUKER-Germany) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The XRD patterns were taken with a step of 0.02°, with a sampling time of 1 s per step. Absorbance measurements were performed using a Shimadzu 1601 PC UV-vis spectrophotometer. FTIR spectra were obtained using a Tensor II (BRUKER-Germany). The specific surface area was determined by the BET method using a surface area analyzer (BELSORP MINI II). Zeta potential measurements were conducted using a HORIBA instrument (SZ-100).
Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic activity of the obtained products was investigated by measuring the degradation of MO under UV light (generated by an 8 W high-pressure mercury lamp). Typically, 30.0 mg of each product was added to the aqueous solution of MO dye (50.0 ml, 10.0 mg L−1, pH = 2.0). The suspension was stirred in the dark for 30 min at room temperature to establish the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Next, the suspension was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation under stirring. Concentrations of MO were monitored with a spectrophotometer at certain irradiation time intervals (every 5 min) by measuring the absorbance at 464 nm during the photocatalytic dye degradation.
Results and discussion
Herein, the different Zn containing SnO2 hierarchical structures (Zn-doped SnO2 and Zn2SnO4) were synthesized by the hydrothermal method by using choline chloride:SnCl2 (ChCl:SnCl2) and choline chloride:ZnCl2 (ChCl:ZnCl2) as precursors with two Zn/Sn molar ratios (1/1 and 1/10) at different pH values (1.0–13.0) with different applied temperatures (120–220 °C) for 24 h.

The results showed that the pH of the synthesis medium can be very effective on the morphology and size of the obtained products. Fig. 1 shows the FESEM images of the as-prepared Zn containing SnO2 structures with a 1/1 Zn/Sn molar ratio at different pH values with optimum temperatures: ZS0-1-120 (A), ZS0-2-140 (B), ZS0-4-220 (C), ZS0-7-220 (D), ZS0-10-220 (E), ZS0-11-180 (F), ZS0-12-180 (G), ZS0-12.5-180 (H) and ZS0-13-180 (I).
Investigation of the effect of Zn amount on the morphology and size of the products at different temperatures
For the investigation of the effect of Zn amount, different Zn/Sn molar ratios of 1/10 and 1/1 were used for the synthesis of Zn containing structures at different pH values with optimum temperatures (Fig. 2 and S3†). Also, the undoped SnO2 structures at pH 2 and 12 were prepared and compared with Zn containing structures at these pH (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  FESEM images of the synthesized SnO2 structures in water with different Zn/Sn molar ratios: S0-2-140 (A and B with different magnifications), ZS0-2-140 (1/10) (C and D with different magnifications), ZS0-2-140 (1/1) (E and F with different magnifications), ZS0-11-220 (1/10) (G), ZS0-11-220 (1/1) (H), S0-12-120 (I), ZS0-12-120 (1/10) (M and N), ZS0-12-120 (1/1) (R), S0-12-140 (J), ZS0-12-140 (1/10) (O), ZS0-12-140 (1/1) (S), S0-12-180 (K), ZS0-12-180 (1/10) (P), ZS0-12-180 (1/1) (U) S0-12-220 (L), and ZS0-12-220 (1/10) (Q). 
In some cases, increasing the Zn amount resulted in decreasing of the nanoparticle size or nanosheet thickness. In the case of pH 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10, the reduction of the size of the nanoparticles was observed by increasing the Zn amount (Fig. 2 and S3†). At pH 1, the higher amount of Zn led to smaller nanoparticles at two different temperatures of 120 and 140 °C (Fig. S3A–D†). As shown in Fig. 2A–F, at pH 2, smaller flowers with lower petal thickness were obtained with increasing the Zn amount. In the case of pH 4, different flower morphologies were obtained by changing the Zn/Sn molar ratio (Fig. S3E–H†). At pH 7 and 10, by increasing the Zn amount, smaller nanoparticles were obtained (Fig. S3I–N†).
Impressive variations were observed at pH 11 and 12 with a change of the Zn amount. At pH 11, with the Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1/10, the rectangular nanosheets with an average thickness of 16.0 nm which loosely intersect with each other were obtained with some spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 30 nm (Fig. 2G). The higher Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1/1 resulted in the micrometer cubic structures formed from the self-assembly of nanosheets with an average thickness of 15 nm and a large number of spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 32 nm (Fig. 2H). As shown in Fig. 2, by increasing the pH to 12, significant alteration was observed in the morphology of the final products with the increase of the Zn amount. In the case of undoped SnO2, thin 2D nanosheets with some intersection between them were obtained that resulted in flower-like hierarchical structures. No significant morphology alteration was observed by changing the temperature in the range of 120 to 180 °C (Fig. 2I–K). Only the thickness of the 2D nanosheets became thinner by increasing the temperature up to 180 °C (Fig. 2I–K). At 220 °C, micrometer spherical particles containing smaller nanoparticles were also observed in the product (Fig. 2L). In the case of the Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1/10, the obtained product morphology was completely different compared to the undoped SnO2 (Fig. 2I–P). In this situation, different applied temperatures from 120 to 220 °C, caused the morphology changes (Fig. 2M–P). At 120 °C, micrometer cubic structures with an average size of 1.0 μm were observed which created from the self-assembly of thin 2D nanosheets with an average thickness of 22.0 nm (Fig. 2M and N). Increasing the temperature to 140 °C resulted in micrometer cubic structures with an average size of 1.5 μm with smooth surfaces (Fig. 2O). These cubes converted to hierarchical porous micrometer cubes at 180 °C that self-assembled from small nanoparticles with an average size of 23.0 nm (Fig. 2P). Further increasing the temperature to 220 °C led to spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 40.0 nm without any cubic structures (Fig. 2Q). Increasing the Zn/Sn molar ratio to 1/1 produced the micrometer octahedral structures at 180 °C which were not completed at lower temperatures (Fig. 2R–U). At pH 13, no product was obtained for the Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1/10 compared to the flower-like hierarchical structure containing the square-shaped nanorods for the Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1/1 (Fig. 1I). The results showed that the Zn amount can have a significant effect on the size and morphology of the as-prepared metal oxides.
Investigation of the effect of the precursor types on the morphology and size of the products
For the investigation of the effect of the precursor types, the synthesis of Zn containing SnO2 structures was performed in water by using anhydrous (SnCl2 and ZnCl2) and hydrous (SnCl2·2H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) solids besides ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors. For anhydrous SnCl2 and ZnCl2, the products were synthesized in different pH values of 2, 4, 7, 11, 12 for the Zn/Sn molar ratio of 1/1. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, at pH 2, the obtained flowers from anhydrous precursors (ZS0-2-140 (1/1)*) were larger with thicker petals with an average flower size and petal thickness of 500 nm and 22 nm, respectively, compared to the resulted flowers from ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors (ZS0-2-140 (1/1); an average flower size and petal thickness of 250 nm and 19 nm, respectively). At higher pH values of 4 and 7, the attained products from the anhydrous solids (ZS0-4-220 (1/1)* and ZS0-7-220 (1/1)*) did not have the uniformity of the obtained samples from ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors (ZS0-4-220 (1/1) and ZS0-7-220 (1/1)) (Fig. 3D–G). Also, as shown in Fig. 3H–K, in the case of pH 11 and 12, the synthesis using anhydrous solids (ZS0-11-220 (1/1)* and ZS0-12-220 (1/1)*) resulted in the products with morphologies significantly different from the obtained samples using ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors. No obvious morphology was obtained with anhydrous solids at pH 11 and 12 compared to the obtained cubic-sheet and octahedral morphologies using ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors, respectively (ZS0-11-220 (1/1) and ZS0-12-220 (1/1)) (Fig. 3H–K).

Using hydrous solids (SnCl2·2H2O and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) for the synthesis of Zn containing SnO2 structures caused significant alteration to using ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors (Fig. 3A and D). Two pH values of 2 and 12 were investigated. At pH 2, the synthesis by hydrous solids (ZS0-2-140 (1/1)**) led to some assembled spherical nanoparticles without any flower-shaped product unlike the flower-like morphology resulting from ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors (Fig. 3A and D). Also, the octahedral morphology observed at pH 12 by using ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors (ZS0-12-180 (1/1)) was not obtained with hydrous solids (ZS0-12-180 (1/1)**) (Fig. 3J and L).
The obtained results confirmed the importance of the type of applied precursor in the synthesis of Zn containing SnO2 structures. In this synthesis, the presence of ChCl as a directing and protecting agent plays a very important role in the size and morphology of the synthesized products. Also, the existence of the functional groups of choline on the surface of the obtained products with no calcination requirement can be effective for some applications.
Investigation of the effect of the solvent type on the morphology and size of the products
For the investigation of the effect of solvents, some other solvents such as water:ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:1 and ChCl:urea DES were used besides water for the synthesis of Zn containing structures. Also, the synthesis was performed without a solvent by using only ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors. In all of these cases, a spherical morphology was obtained unlike the obtained flower-like morphology in water solvent (Fig. 4). The results showed that the solvent type can also play an important role in determining the morphology of the obtained products.

In the proposed synthesis, only by using ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 as precursors in water solvent and with alteration of pH, temperature and Zn amount, without the addition of any additives, products with different sizes and morphologies were obtained containing hierarchical structures.
XRD analysis of the Zn containing SnO2 structures
For characterization of the Zn containing SnO2 structures, XRD analysis was performed. The XRD patterns of ZS0-2-140 (1/1), ZS0-4-220 (1/1), ZS1-4-220 (1/1), ZS0-7-220 (1/1), ZS1-7-220 (1/1), ZS0-10-220 (1/1), ZS1-10-220 (1/1), ZS1-11-180 (1/1), ZS0-12-180 (1/1), ZS1-12-180 (1/1), ZS1-12-140 (1/10) and ZS1-12-180 (1/10) were investigated.
In the case of pH 2, the XRD pattern of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) completely indexed to the standard diffraction pattern of the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2 and no impurity phase was observed (Fig. 5A). At this pH, the Zn doped SnO2 structure was obtained without the calcination process. As reported in the literature, the XRD peaks of the Zn doped SnO2 structures are only slightly broader compared to the SnO2 structure.4
 Fig. 5  The XRD patterns of (A) ZS0-2-140 (1/1) and (B) ZS0-12-180 (1/1) (ZHS) (a) and ZS1-12-180 (1/1) (ZTO) (b). 
Investigation of the XRD patterns of ZS0-4-220 (1/1), ZS0-7-220 (1/1), ZS0-10-220 (1/1) and ZS0-11-180 (1/1) before calcination showed the presence of the SnO phase with the small amount of the Zn doped SnO2 phase in the product (Fig. S4A and B†). The gray color of the products has also confirmed this. With a calcination process at 600 °C for 2 h, the ZS1-4-220 (1/1), ZS1-7-220 (1/1), ZS1-10-220 (1/1) and ZS1-11-220 (1/1) samples converted to the two Zn doped SnO2 phases incorporating the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases (Fig. S4A and B†). As reported in the literature, during the conversion of tetragonal SnO to tetragonal SnO2, that is the high-temperature stable phase, the intermediate orthorhombic phase of SnO2 can also be seen. By increasing the calcination temperature, the intermediate orthorhombic SnO2 phase can convert to the tetragonal phase completely.57
As shown in Fig. 5B (a), by increasing the pH to 12, the obtained XRD pattern of ZS0-12-180 (1/1) before calcination exhibits various well-defined diffraction peaks that correspond to the cubic phase of ZnSn(OH)6 with some small peaks related to the Zn2SnO4 phase. ZnSn(OH)6 (zinc hydroxystannate, ZHS) is a nontoxic semiconductor compound that has very significant properties.23 After calcination at 600 °C for 2 h, the complete transformation of ZnSn(OH)6 to Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) with a cubic inverse spinel structure occurred which can exhibit specific functions.23 In determining the chemical and physical properties of Zn2SnO4, the controllable-index facet of its polyhedral crystal is as important as its size, phase and crystallinity.23
In the case of ZS1-12-140 (1/10), ZS1-12-180 (1/10) and ZS1-13-180 (1/1), the obtained XRD patterns showed the tetragonal phase of Zn-doped SnO2 without any impurity (Fig. S4C and D†). The results showed that the pH of the synthesis medium can affect the chemical composition of the obtained products.
EDX analysis of the Zn containing SnO2 structures
Some of the as-prepared Zn containing SnO2 structures were selected for the EDX analysis as samples. The EDX analysis of the samples containing Zn in the synthesis process confirmed the presence of the small amount of Zn in the cases of Zn doped SnO2 (ZS0-2-140 (1/1), ZS1-10-220 (1/1), ZS1-11-180 (1/1), ZS1-12-120 (1/10), ZS1-12-180 (1/10)) and ZS1-13-220 (1/1) and high amount of Zn in the case of ZS1-12-180 (1/1) (ZTO) (Fig. S5B–H†) besides Sn and O. In the case of the SnO2 structure obtained at pH 2 (S0-2-140), the peaks of Sn and O were only observed in the spectrum (Fig. S5A†). The observed peaks of C and N in the spectrum are attributed to the choline component of the DES precursors.
FTIR analysis of the Zn containing SnO2 structures
For the investigation of the functional groups existing in the synthesized samples and the vibrational states of the Sn and Zn ions, FTIR analysis was performed within 400–4000 cm−1 for S0-2-140 and ZS0-2-140 (1/1) as samples.
As shown in Fig. 6, the bands at 611, 685 and 485 cm−1 are attributed to Sn–O stretching and O–Sn–O stretching and bending vibrations, respectively, which confirm the crystalline phase of SnO2.34,44 The observed changes in the band position for ZS0-2-140 (1/1) (Fig. 6b) compared to S0-2-140 (Fig. 6a) can be due to the effect of Zn doping on the SnO2 network which may be ascribed to the defect states present in the synthesized samples.44

Other observed peaks in the spectra related to the C–H, O–H, C–N and C–O stretching and bending vibrations of the adsorbed choline ions on the S0-2-140 and ZS0-2-140 (1/1) surfaces are shown in Fig. 6.58,59
Growth mechanism of the formation of Zn containing SnO2 hierarchical structures
In this section, the mechanism of formation of Zn containing SnO2 hierarchical structures was analyzed at pH 2.0, 12.0 and 13.0. In order to study the formation and growth mechanism of different morphologies, a series of comparison experiments were carried out by varying the reaction temperatures at a constant synthesis time of 24 h.
In the case of pH 2.0, the flower-like hierarchical structures were observed for S0-2-140, ZS0-2-140 (1/10) and ZS0-2-140 (1/1) (Fig. 2A–F). Commonly, it is confirmed that the development of 3D hierarchical flower-like Sn-based structures from 2D nanosheets consists of three steps (i) nucleation and nuclei growth; (ii) oriented attachment; (iii) further growth. Initially, small SnO2 or Zn-doped SnO2 nanocrystals are produced via hydrolysis and oxidation of Sn2+ and Zn2+ salts, then, the assembly of small SnO2 or Zn-doped SnO2 nanoparticles occurred to form 2D nanosheets by an oriented attachment mechanism. The spontaneous anchoring of the newly formed nanocrystals on the pre-formed Zn-doped SnO2 nanosheets and further growth to another nanosheet for minimization of the surface energy result in flower-like hierarchical structures (Scheme 1A).60,61 Also, the investigation of the FESEM images of ZS0-2-120 (1/1) and ZS0-2-140 (1/1) showed that the increase of the temperature from 120 to 140 °C resulted in the hierarchical flower-like structures with larger petals, as said above (Fig. S1D and E†). With further increasing the temperature, the flowers started to disorder and disappear (Fig. S1F†). According to the crystal growth kinetics theory, increasing the reaction temperature increases the growth rate of the crystals and the probability of collision between precursor particles, and so the fast aggregation of the small particles into larger particles causes the deficient time for the ordered assembly.62
 Scheme 1  Growth mechanism of the formation of SnO2 and Zn containing SnO2 structures at (A) pH = 2, (B) pH = 12 and (C) pH = 12.3–13. 
Investigation of the FESEM images of the synthesized samples at pH 12.0 showed that in the case of S0-12-180, thin nanosheets with some intersection between them were obtained from the oriented attachment of spherical nanoparticles at different temperatures that resulted in the flower-like hierarchical structures (Fig. 2K, Scheme 1B).63 The obtained FESEM images of ZS0-12 (1/10) at different temperatures showed that initially some 2D nanosheets obtained from the oriented attachment of spherical nanoparticles. After that, the hierarchical assembly of 2D nanosheets started at 120 °C to form the cubic structures (Fig. 2M and N, Scheme 1B). The cubes were obtained at 140 °C with smooth surfaces (Fig. 2O, Scheme 1B). The suggested mechanism can be based on crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization and surface flattening.64 By increasing the temperature to 180 °C, the evolution of the cubes to porous cubes containing spherical nanoparticles was observed again based on a dissolution–recrystallization mechanism that converted completely to spherical nanoparticles at 220 °C (Fig. 2P and Q, Scheme 1B).
Considering the FESEM images of ZS0-12 (1/1) and ZS0-12.3 (1/1) at different temperatures showed that the obtained micrometer octahedral ZnSn(OH)6 structures were prepared from the self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles based on the oriented attachment and subsequent surface flattening mechanism that can be observed in the temperature range of 120–180 °C (Fig. 2R–U, Scheme 1B).65 At first, the polyhedral micrometer structures with more faces such as surface layered hierarchical truncated octahedral structures were obtained from the assembly of spherical nanoparticles at lower temperatures. This can be due to the oriented attachment mechanism (120 and 140 °C) (Fig. 2R–U).66 At 180 °C, the octahedral structures became complete nearly and the smooth surface was obtained based on the surface flattening mechanism (Fig. 1G and H). Also, as previously reported in the literature, the micrometer octahedral structures formed due to the higher growth rate of the [100] crystalline face compared to that of [111] that can be due to the stronger interaction of the choline component of DES precursors with the [111] crystalline face compared to [100] at high alkaline pH.66–68
These micrometer octahedral ZnSn(OH)6 structures (eqn (1)) can be converted to Zn2SnO4 by calcination at 600 °C for 2 h without morphology alteration (eqn (2)) (Fig. S6†). Zn2+ + Sn4+ + 6OH− → ZnSn(OH)6(1) (2)
The FESEM images of ZS0-13-180(1/1) showed that the micrometer hierarchical flower-like structures containing nanorods obtained based on the crystallization–dissolution–recrystallization mechanism as shown in Scheme 1C (Fig. 1I). By increasing the pH above 12.3 at 180 °C, the decomposition of the octahedral structures was observed gradually to nanosheets and nanorods due to the etching action of OH−. The nanorods were further grown and smoothen into hierarchical nanoflower containing nanothorns by increasing the pH. Further increasing the pH to 13.0 caused the conversion of the thorns of the flowers to the square-shaped nanorods and formation of pompon-like hierarchical Zn doped SnO2.69
Investigation of the photocatalytic activities of the Zn containing SnO2 structures
Photocatalytic activities of the synthesized samples were evaluated by the degradation of the MO dye at a concentration of 10.0 ppm and solution pH of 2.0 under UV wavelength irradiation with a power of 8 W. The efficiency of the photocatalytic process increases if the dye and surface of the applied catalyst have opposite charges.70 As reported in the literature, the zeta potential of SnO2 and Zn containing SnO2 structures is related to pH, amount of Zn, and the surface bonding state on the exposed facets that can be changed by the alteration of the catalyst morphology.70,71 The catalyst positive charge can also be due to the presence of choline functional groups resulted from ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors. By increasing the positive charge of the catalyst, the surface adsorption of the anionic MO dye can be enhanced.70Table 3 shows the zeta potential of the as-prepared Zn-doped SnO2 samples that were tested at pH 2.0 (the pH of the MO solution). All the samples had positive charges that are in accordance with the results reported in the literature.72 ZS0-2-140 (1/1) and ZS1-11-180 (1/1) had a higher amount of positive surface charges compared to other samples (Table 3).

In the first step, the photocatalytic efficiency of flower-like ZS0-2-140 was investigated for the MO dye degradation. Fig. 7A shows the variations in the absorption spectra of MO solution irradiated by UV light for different times in the presence of the ZS0-2-140 photocatalyst (0.6 g L−1). The results showed the decreasing of the concentration of MO dye by increasing the time of irradiation (Fig. 7A). Fig. 7B shows the discoloration of the MO dye solution depending on the time in the presence of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) that was completed in 15 min. In this case, the degradation efficiency was 99.5%. It can be seen clearly that the flower-like ZS0-2-140 with 2D nanosheet constructive units has the brilliant photocatalytic activity toward the MO dye.

For evaluation of the effect of the products' morphology and dimensions, Zn amount and type of precursor used for the synthesis and calcination process on the photocatalytic efficiency of MO, some products obtained under different pH conditions were selected. Investigation of the effect of the morphology and dimensions of the products on the photocatalytic efficiency was conducted with Zn containing SnO2 structures such as ZS0-2-140 (1/1), ZS1-4-220 (1/1), ZS1-7-220 (1/1), ZS1-10-220 (1/1), ZS1-11-180 (1/1), ZS1-12-140 (1/1), ZS0-12-180 (1/1) and ZS1-12-180 (1/1) (Fig. 7C). The photocatalytic tests of these samples for the degradation of MO dye were performed under the same conditions as those of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) (initial concentration of MO: 10 ppm, amount of applied catalysts: 0.6 g L−1, pH = 2.0 and time: 15 minutes). The degradation efficiency of the selected samples was compared as shown in Fig. 7D. These results indicated the effect of the morphology, surface charge and dimensions of the constructive units of the hierarchical structures synthesized under different pH conditions on the photocatalytic process. The greater degradation efficiency may be attributed to the specific morphology of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) containing a hierarchical flower-like structure with 2D nanosheet constructive units. As reported in the literature, more efficient light-harvesting can be achieved by using the hierarchical structures that provide further photogenerated electrons and holes to increase the catalytic activity. Also, these structures improve the molecular diffusion/transport kinetics and increase the surface area and the number of active sites, which accelerate the surface reaction kinetics.22 The diffusion time of the photogenerated electrons and holes from the bulk of SnO2 to the surface becomes short with this hierarchical structure containing thin 2D nanosheets. So, this can decrease the recombination probability and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency.21,22,73,74
The effect of the functional groups on the surface of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) was investigated by the calcination of the ZS0-2-140 (1/1) sample after the synthesis process. The degradation efficiency of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) and ZS1-2-140 (1/1) was compared for the degradation of MO (Fig. S7A†). The results showed that the degradation efficiency decreased by the calcination process from 99.5% to 89.08% (Fig. 7D) which can be related to the disappearance of the surface adsorbed choline component of the ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors and also agglomeration. For comparison of the degradation efficiency of other synthesized structures at pH 2.0 with different amounts of Zn, ZS0-2-140 (1/10) and S0-2-140 were investigated for the degradation of MO dye (Fig. S7A†). The improvement of the degradation efficiency was observed by increasing the amount of Zn (S0-2-140: 50%, ZS0-2-140 (1/10): 81.32% and ZS0-2-140 (1/1): 99.5%) (Fig. 7D). This can be related to the reduction of the bandgap by the addition of Zn to the SnO2 structure. The calculated amounts of bandgap for S0-2-140 and ZS0-2-140 (1/1) were 3.46 eV and 3.09 eV, respectively (Fig. S8†). The reduction of the bandgap after Zn doping indicates the modification of the original SnO2 structures due to the presence of Zn ions.2
The effect of the applied precursors for the synthesis of Zn containing structures on the photocatalytic efficiency was evaluated by comparing three samples, ZS0-2-140 (1/1), ZS0-2-140 (1/1)* and ZS0-2-140 (1/1)** (Fig. S7B†). The results showed that the obtained ZS0-2-140 (1/1) from ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 precursors had better degradation efficiency compared to anhydrous and hydrous Sn and Zn precursors. Furthermore, the specific surface area of as-prepared ZS0-2-140 (1/1) and ZS0-2-140 (1/1)* was determined by the BET method and found to be 44.65 and 18.43 m2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S9†). The higher amount of specific surface area was obtained for ZS0-2-140 (1/1) compared to ZS0-2-140 (1/1)*. As said above, the presence of choline as a component of precursors can affect the flower-like hierarchical structure size and their 2D nanosheet building block thickness (Fig. 3) and therefore can affect their specific surface area and also degradation efficiency. Also, the obtained amount of surface area for ZS0-2-140 (1/1) is higher than that of the commercial SnO2 (3.481 m2 g−1)73 and also many results reported in the literature.69,73,77–79 As said above, the hierarchical structures can increase the surface area.22 The large exposed surface can provide high surface sites for the degradation of MO dye.73
Also, for the investigation of the stability of the ZS0-2-140 (1/1) phase after the photocatalytic reaction, its UV-vis absorption and XRD analysis were performed after the degradation of MO. The obtained results were compared with the UV-vis spectrum and XRD pattern of the as-prepared ZS0-2-140 (1/1) before the photocatalytic process which showed its phase stability (Fig. S10†).
The obtained result for the degradation efficiency of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) was also compared with the results of other research studies on the use of SnO2 and Zn-doped SnO2 for the degradation of MO dye and is presented in Table 4. The comparison showed the high efficiency of ZS0-2-140 (1/1) for the photocatalytic degradation of MO dye under UV wavelength irradiation.

Conclusions
In summary, different hierarchical-based nanostructures containing SnO2, Zn-doped SnO2 and Zn2SnO4 were synthesized by the hydrothermal method by using ChCl:SnCl2 and ChCl:ZnCl2 as precursors for the first time without addition of any other materials. The effects of some synthesis parameters such as pH, temperature, type of solvent, type of Sn precursor, and the amount and type of Zn precursor on the size and morphology of the synthesized products were studied. The results showed that all of the synthesis conditions can affect the size, morphology and chemical composition of the obtained product. Choline chloride can act as a directing and shape controlling agent. The investigation of the mechanism of the formation of hierarchical structures by FESEM at different temperatures showed the oriented attachment mechanism in most cases. The as-prepared metal oxides were used as the photocatalysts for the degradation of MO dye under UV irradiation. The results showed the effect of hierarchical structure, morphology, dimensions of constructive units, Zn doping, chemical composition, surface chemistry, charge and area of the obtained products on the photocatalytic degradation of MO. The ZS0-2-140 (1/1) hierarchical flower-like structure containing 2D nanosheets exhibited an excellent MO degradation efficiency of 99.5% in 15 min.
