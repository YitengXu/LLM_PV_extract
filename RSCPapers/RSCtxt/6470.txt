    , Accepted 15th October 2015First published on 16th October 2015AbstractIntensifying the light harvesting and promoting the separation of photoinduced charge carriers are effective strategies to boost photocatalyst performance. Inspired by these insights, a hybrid photocatalyst was fabricated in this work by the deposition of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on a ZnO photonic crystal (ZnO-PC). The photonic band-gap of the ZnO-PC was tuned experimentally by Bragg's law to couple the slow photon (SP) effect of the ZnO-PC with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au NPs. Transmission spectra results indicated that, when the SP effect of the ZnO-PC matched well with the SPR of Au NPs, the visible light absorption of Au NPs could be substantially amplified. The hybrid Au/ZnO-PC showed high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation, and the degradation kinetic constant (1.42 h−1) is ca. 5.6-fold higher than that of the famous N doped TiO2 (TiO2−xNx, 0.22 h−1) and 24.8-fold higher than that of the commercial ZnO NPs (0.05 h−1). The synergistic effects of the SPR of Au, the SP effect of the ZnO-PC, and the heterostructures between ZnO and Au NPs account for the high photocatalytic performance, which can enhance the harvesting of visible light and promote the separation of charge carriers. A possible reaction mechanism was tentatively proposed based on the active species analysis result. The work not only provides an effective route to enhance photocatalytic efficiency, but also contributes to a better understanding of the role of PCs in the photocatalytic reaction.
1. Introduction
As one of the most promising technologies for environmental remediation and solar energy conversion, semiconductor photocatalysis has attracted great attention since Fujishima1 and Carey2 reported that the evolution of H2 and the degradation of organic pollutants could be achieved over TiO2 by a photocatalytic process.3–5 The technology has become a hotspot in recent years for its environmental merits and the capability to be driven by solar light.6,7 However, most of the photocatalysts available to date are greatly limited by either the poor visible light response or the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers.3,8–11 Besides the development of highly efficient new materials, many efforts such as doping,12,13 coupling,14,15 surface modifications,16,17 and fabrication of hierarchical or heterogeneous structures18–20 have been devoted to further exploiting the performance of the reported photocatalysts. Among these strategies, the formation of noble metal/semiconductor (M/S) hybrid materials is an effective way to improve the activity for the unique optical and electronic properties21–25 and are being considered as potential photocatalysts in the purification of water and solar energy conversion.26–29 M/S hybrid photocatalysts can be generally categorized into metals coated on the semiconductor surfaces or M/S core–shell structures, and each of them exhibits high photocatalytic activities.30–33 However, the promotion efficiency of the traditional M/S hybrid structure is still hindered by several problems: the first kind of M/S structure only facilitates the separation of photoinduced charge carriers (e− and h+) on the surface rather than in the semiconductor bulk,30,31 while for the second kind, although the transfer of e− to the metal core can be effectively achieved, the recombination of e− and h+ in the semiconductor shell will dominate again32,33 once the maximum storage of e− in the metal has been attained. Although the absorption of the semiconductor can be extended to long wavelength due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption of noble metals, both the structures cannot intensify the harvesting of light occurring in the semiconductor bulk phase. This interaction is a crucial factor to determine the formation amounts of e− and h+.3,34 Therefore, it is of great significance to design novel M/S hybrid photocatalysts which can intensify the light harvesting and promote the separation of e− and h+, simultaneously.
After 25 year evolution,35–37 photonic crystals (PCs) have become one of the most influential and wide-ranging realms of contemporary electromagnetics and optics. The 3D inverse opal PC formed by a replicated shell structure of a face-centered-cubic opal possesses an extraordinary structure and PC effect.38,39 Specifically, the PC effect could enhance the light–dielectric interactions by confining, controlling and manipulating the propagation of light via Bragg diffraction, multiple scattering and slow photon (SP) effect.40–42 Bragg diffraction prohibits the propagation of light within the photonic band-gap (PBG) wavelength range in certain directions; multiple scattering increases light (its wavelength is away from the PBG wavelength range) trapping; the SP effect can be understood by slowing down the group velocity of the light at the frequency edges of the PBG. Additionally, SPs generated on the red edge of the PBG (denoted as RSP) are primarily localized in the high dielectric part of the PC, while on the blue edge of the PBG (denoted as BSP), light is localized in the low dielectric part of the PC. Therefore, the photo-responsive material in the high dielectric medium should interact more strongly with the RSP, and less strongly with the BSP, accordingly a more obvious absorption spectrum of the red part and less obvious of the blue part, and vice versa. Apart from its unique PC effect, the 3D inverse opal structure has several other excellent attributes, such as mass transport and the large specific surface area due to its 3D ordered spherical pore and interconnected nano-framework,43–46 which highly facilitate its use in composite materials. Therefore, using PC type semiconductors to fabricate M/S hybrids is a promising strategy to simultaneously achieve excellent light trapping and high separation of charge carriers, which could be potent for designing highly efficient photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical materials or devices that are significant for solar energy utilization and environmental remediation. For example, Zhao et al.42 fabricated the visible-light-driven photocatalyst TiO2 PC/Au NPs which showed the highest photocatalytic activity for 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation when the Au NP plasmonic absorption was coincident with the BSP of the TiO2 PC. However, the activity of the TiO2 PC/Au NPs, whose RSP was in correspondence with Au plasmonic absorption, was not investigated, as well as the activities of the disordered TiO2/Au NPs and the standard reference TiO2−xNx. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanism was not studied in more detail, such as the function of the active species.
Enlightened by the extraordinary properties of PCs and M/S hybrid heterojunctions, Au/ZnO hybrid photonic crystals (Au/ZnO-PCs) with different PBGs were fabricated in this work by a facile auto-forced impregnation method. By this approach, the PBG of the Au/ZnO-PC could be tuned either overlapping or out of the SPR absorption of Au NPs. For comparison, disordered porous Au/ZnO (Au/ZnO-P) which shows no SP effect was also prepared. Their photocatalytic performances were evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) under visible light irradiation. The results demonstrated that, compared with Au/ZnO-P, the commercial ZnO NPs and TiO2−xNx (a standard reference used to evaluate the visible-light driven photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst12), the photocatalytic activity of the Au/ZnO-PC could be remarkably enhanced by the SP effect. The highest activity could be achieved when BSP overlapped with SPR absorption of Au NPs. At last, a possible reaction mechanism on the Au/ZnO-PC was tentatively proposed based on the active species analysis result.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Styrene was washed with the same volume of 0.1 M NaOH solution and then deionized water to remove the polymerization inhibitor. Potassium persulfate was recrystallized twice from deionized water, and then lucifugal dried at 40 °C in a vacuum oven. A glass slide and FTO glass (sheet resistance is ca. 14 Ω cm−2 Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) were used as substrates which were washed by immersing in H2SO4/H2O2 solution mixture for 3 h with a volume ratio ca. 3:1. The substrates were then cleaned with absolute ethanol and deionized water to make the surfaces more hydrophilic (Fig. S1†) and finally dried with N2 to maintain the surface purity. Pure water was used throughout the study. Purities in percent and sources for all reagents and solvents are provided in the ESI.†
2.2. Preparation of photocatalysts

Scheme 1 illustrates the experimental procedure for the fabrication of the Au/ZnO-PC hybrid, which consists of four sequential steps: (1) self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) spheres with the fcc structure onto the substrates, (2) infiltration of the ZnO precursor, (3) drying and calcination, (4) final sputtering of Au NPs on the ZnO-PC. In order to grow high-quality PS opal templates and fill the ZnO precursor into the interstices of the PS opal template effectively, carboxyl modified PS spheres were synthesized.
 Scheme 1  Pictorial representation of the procedure for the preparation of the Au/ZnO-PC hybrid photocatalyst. 

2.2.1. Synthesis of PS spheres. 
Mono-dispersed PS latex spheres were synthesized by emulsifier-free emulsion copolymerization according to the literature47 using styrene as the polymerized monomer, potassium persulfate as the initiator, and methacrylic acid as the functional monomer to provide a carboxyl group on the surface of spheres. The typical synthesis of carboxyl-modified PS latex spheres with 182 nm diameter is as follows: 100 mL deionized water was added to a 250 mL three-neck flask. N2 was bubbled in the flask to blow away air. 30 min later, 6.2 mL pre-washed styrene and 0.2 mL methacrylic acid were added to the flask. The flask was then heated to 75 °C by using an oil bath and 0.1 g pre-purified potassium persulfate was added subsequently. After reaction at 75 °C for 24 h, the resultant white latex was filtered through a glass filter to remove aggregates, followed by centrifugation and washing with deionized water several times. The precipitate was finally dispersed into water for later use. Carboxyl-modified PS latex spheres with different diameters can be prepared through varying the volume ratio of styrene/methacrylic acid. Specifically, spheres of 222 and 277 nm diameter were synthesized with the volume ratio of 6.2/0.1 and 9.3/0.2 (mL), respectively.


2.2.2. Self-assembly of PS opal templates. 
The colloidal opal templates were fabricated by means of vertical deposition.48 The substrates (glass slide or FTO glass) were submerged into the PS colloidal suspension (ca. 0.15 wt%) vertically and kept at 45 °C for ca. 20 h. The colloidal opal templates then can be obtained. The opal templates composed of 182, 222, and 277 nm PS spheres were denoted as PS-182, PS-222 and PS-277, respectively. To elucidate the photonic crystal effect, a random ZnO porous structure was fabricated by using an inhomogeneous PS template which consists of PS spheres of different diameters (182, 222, and 277 nm).


2.2.3. Preparation of ZnO-PCs and Au/ZnO-PCs. 
To fabricate ZnO photonic crystals with high quality, an auto-forced impregnation approach was used for ZnO precursor infiltration.46 Before infiltration with the ZnO precursor solution, the opal templates were annealed at 90 °C for 30 min to promote their mechanical strength. Then the opal templates were immersed into Zn(NO3)2 (3 g) 20 mL water–ethanol (V/V = 12/8) solution at room temperature. After about 120 s, the templates were taken out slowly and placed horizontally on an experimental bench to evaporate the solvent (the template denoted as PSZ). PSZ was then heated to 400 °C (1 °C min−1) and maintained at the temperature for 4 h to obtain the ZnO PC. The samples fabricated from the opal templates composed of PS spheres with 182, 222, and 277 nm diameter were denoted as ZnO-182, ZnO-222 and ZnO-277, respectively. Au NPs were deposited on the ZnO films by magnetron sputtering (K550X, Emitech, England) to obtain Au/ZnO-PCs. As shown in Scheme S1 (see the ESI†), first, the part (not covered by the ZnO film) of the glass slide was covered by a clean slide and put in the reaction chamber. Then, the air from the reaction chamber was emptied and filled with argon gas. At last, the sputtering time was set to 60 s.


2.2.4. Fabrication of reference samples. 
Four reference film samples including porous ZnO (ZnO-P), Au/ZnO-P, commercial ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs), and N-doped TiO2 (TiO2−xNx, synthesized according to the reported procedure12,49) were prepared for comparison. ZnO-P and Au/ZnO-P films were prepared by the same aforementioned procedures using the inhomogeneous PS as the template. ZnO-NPs and TiO2−xNx films were prepared by coating the substrates with their water suspensions which are dispersed by ultrasonic treatment. The films were then baked at 120 °C for 30 min to remove water and to enhance the film adhesion on the substrate.

2.3. Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the polystyrene spheres in KBr pellets were recorded on a Nicolet-6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Corp., USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer at 40 kV and 40 mA using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. Transmittance spectra were characterized on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500) and a glass slide was used as a reference sample. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the sample was conducted on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 3.0 × 10−10 mbar with an Al Kα X-ray beam (1486.6 eV). The morphology was investigated on a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (America, FEI Nova NanoSEM 230). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL model JEM 2010 Ex instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The amount of Au was determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS, X-Series 2, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
2.4. Photocatalytic activity test
RhB was selected as a probe molecule to evaluate the photocatalytic activity. The degradation reaction was implemented in a quartz cell (3.2 × 1.2 × 4.5 cm3) containing 10 mL 2.4 ppm RhB solution. In a typical run, the prepared Au/ZnO-PC film was immersed vertically into the solution. Prior to irradiation, the solution was stirred for 30 min in the dark to ensure an adsorption and desorption equilibrium. A 500 W Xe-arc lamp equipped with an IR-cutoff filter and an UV-cutoff filter was used as a visible light source (λ > 420 nm) (the emission spectrum is shown in Fig. S2†). During irradiation, a 2.5 mL solution was taken out at given intervals for UV-Vis absorption analysis (Cary-50, Varian Co.). Meanwhile, the light was shielded by using a plate. After the analysis, the solution was poured into the quartz cell to carry on the degradation reaction. The total organic carbon (TOC) values of the solution were detected by using a Shimadzu TOC-Vcph total organic carbon analyzer. The stability of the photocatalyst was evaluated by cyclic experiments on the same sample.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical property
The photoelectrochemical experiment was conducted on an electrochemical station (CHI-660D, Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai, China) using a three-electrode system. The Au/ZnO film on the FTO substrate was used as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl and a Pt wire served as the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was utilized as the electrolyte. In the photocurrent measurement, the Au/ZnO photoanode was illuminated at normal incidence of light through a quartz window.
2.6. Measurements of the reaction active species
Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the active species (superoxide radical ·O2− and hydroxyl radical ·OH) spin-trapped by DMPO were detected using a Bruker model A300 spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Inc.) with normal incidence of light irradiation. In detail, for measuring the hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical, the sample (scraped the Au/ZnO film off the glass slide and the mass was ca. 2 mg) was dispersed in 0.5 mL purified ultrapure water and absolute methanol into which 20 μL DMPO/water or DMPO/methanol solution was added, respectively. The settings for the ESR spectrometer were as follows: center field, 3512 G; microwave frequency, 9.86 GHz; power, 6.34 mW.

N,N-Diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) was employed for the detection of H2O2 that was formed during the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.50 This method is based on the horseradish peroxidase (POD)-catalyzed oxidation by H2O2 of DPD. The sequential reactions lead to the formation of ·DPD+, which shows a fairly stable color and two obvious absorption peaks at 510 and 550 nm. Thus, the existence of H2O2 generated during the photocatalytic process can be characterized by monitoring the absorption peaks. The detection is processed as follows: after the degradation reaction was processed for 60 min, 15 μL DPD and 15 μL POD were added successively. After stirring for 60 s, the mixed solution was transferred into a photometric cell for UV-Vis absorption characterization.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Design of ZnO-PCs
To make PBGs of ZnO-PCs match SPR absorption of the Au NPs (located at ca. 540 nm), ZnO-PCs with expected PBGs were prepared by tuning the PS sphere diameter according to the modified Bragg's law.51 λmax = (8/3)1/2D[ns2f + nf2(1 − f) − sin2θ]1/2(1)where λmax is the maximum wavelength derived from the PBG, D is the diameter of the PS sphere, ns and nf are the refractive index of the spheres and their surrounding medium, respectively, f is the volume of fraction of the spheres which is generally taken as 0.74, and θ is the incident angle of light. According to eqn (1) and considering 10% shrinkage of the pore size of inverse opal during the removal of the PS opal template, three kinds of PS opal templates assembled by 180, 220, and 280 nm PS spheres would be appropriate candidates for the preparation of the ZnO-PC, whose red-edge and blue-edge of the PBG were estimated to be overlapped with or out of the absorption region of Au NPs.

Fig. 1a shows the FT-IR pattern of the as-synthesized PS spheres modified by carboxyl groups. Clearly, the peaks of 1602, 1486 and 1449 cm−1 belong to the vibration absorption of the benzene ring, 3030 and 2930 cm−1 present the C–H stretching vibrational absorption. These verify the existence of the benzene ring. Two strong peaks can be observed at 752 and 700 cm−1 which demonstrate the substitution of the benzene ring. The peak located at 1697 cm−1 is the characteristic peak of CO, and the wide peak between 3600 and 3200 cm−1 indicates the existence of hydroxyls. The results illustrate that the surface of PS spheres modified with carboxyl groups is successfully synthesized.46,47Fig. 1b–d display the SEM images of the opal templates self-assembled by the PS spheres with mean diameters of 182, 222 and 277 nm, respectively. The PS spheres are hexagonally close-packed in highly ordered arrays (Fig. S3†) leading to a uniform size distribution (the insets shown in Fig. 1b–d). The electrostatic interaction among carboxyl groups on the PS surface is also responsible for high dispersion which could prevent agglomeration of PS spheres. The high-quality PS opal templates were further confirmed by PC's nature.38,42,52 As shown in Fig. 2, the sharp Bragg diffraction peaks located at 520, 600 and 680 nm were clearly observed. After the ZnO precursors were infiltrated into the voids of these opal templates, the transmission peaks of the PSZ samples were red shifted to 560, 640, and 730 nm, respectively, and became sharper (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that the ZnO precursor was impregnated into the opal templates homogeneously with a high filling ratio,38,46,51 which is essential for the preparation of the intact inverse opal structure PC. Through calcination of PSZ samples, ZnO-PCs could be obtained. Fig. 3a shows the typical image of the as-prepared ZnO-PC, the ZnO-PC exhibits highly ordered periodicity and spherical pore interconnectivity. These important characteristics are beneficial to effective Au NPs deposition, as well as unhindered dye solution infiltration throughout the entire thickness of the film.

3.2. Characterization of the Au/ZnO-PC
As shown in the SEM image in Fig. 3b, the well-ordered inverse opal and the pore structures of the ZnO-PC were not damaged by the deposition of Au NPs and retain a hexagonal close-packed structure. This structure of the Au/ZnO-PC was further confirmed by the TEM image (Fig. 3c). Fig. 3d and e indicate that Au NPs are deposited on the nano-frameworks with a uniform distribution. No obvious aggregation of Au NPs can be observed and they possess a regular size distribution (a mean diameter ca. 3.4 nm). The deposition amounts of Au in the prepared Au/ZnO films were determined by ICP-MS (Table S1†) and the values are 1.31, 1.33, 1.34, and 1.32 wt% for Au/ZnO-P, Au/ZnO-182, Au/ZnO-222 and Au/ZnO-277, respectively. The clear and continuous ordered lattice fringes in the HR-TEM image (Fig. 3f) and the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (the inset in Fig. 3c) reveal the highly crystalline characteristic of the Au/ZnO-PC hybrid.53,54 The d spacing values of 0.248 and 0.237 nm correspond to the (101) crystal plane of monoclinic ZnO (JPCDS no. 36-1451) and the (111) plane of Au (JPCDS no. 04-0784), respectively.54,55 The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) image (Fig. 3g) shows that the sample is composed of Zn, Au and O. The signals of C and Cu come from the graphite conductive adhesive and copper grid used for the TEM measurement.
The phase purity and crystallographic structure of the ZnO-PC substrate and Au/ZnO-PC hybrid were examined by XRD. The ZnO-PC matrix and Au/ZnO-PC hybrid display similar diffraction peaks in terms of the ZnO framework (Fig. 4), in which the peaks at 2θ values of 31.7, 34.4, 36.2, 47.5, 56.6, 62.9, 66.4, 67.9 and 69.1° can be attributed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112) and (201) crystallographic planes of monoclinic ZnO (JPCDS no. 36-1451), respectively. The characteristic diffraction peaks of Au NPs are marked with “Au” at 2θ = 38.2 and 44.4°. The Au/ZnO-PC hybrid exhibits featured crystallographic planes of face-centered cubic Au (JPCDS no. 04-0784) which agrees well with the HR-TEM results (Fig. 3d–g). The sharp diffraction peaks strongly indicate the nanocrystalline nature of the samples.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of a typical ZnO-PC and Au/ZnO-PC. 
To further affirm the metallic state of Au NPs, XPS is used for the surface analysis of chemical changes induced by the deposition of Au NPs. As shown in Fig. 5, the Au XPS spectra show peaks at binding energies of 87.8 and 84 eV, which are attributed to metallic Au 4f5/2 and Au 4f7/2, respectively.55 Thus, the XPS spectrum of the Au/ZnO-PC unambiguously reveals that Au NPs exist as Au0 in the Au/ZnO-PC. In addition, the peaks observed at 1045 and 1022 eV are ascribed to Zn2+ 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively,55 which implies that the valence state of Zn is not changed after the sputtering of Au NPs.

To confirm that the SP effect enhances the light harvesting of the Au/ZnO-PC hybrid, three kinds of inverse opals were selected according to the SPR absorption of Au NPs. The matching relationship between SP and SPR peaks of Au NPs, as well as the disordered porous sample (ZnO-P), was characterized by the transmission spectrum. Considering that the peak position of the PBG is sensitive to the surrounding medium46,51 and the application of the Au/ZnO-PC for RhB degradation is in aqueous solution, pre-soaking of the films in water for a few minutes was conducted before the transmission spectra measurements. As shown in Fig. 6, the transmission spectra of the samples decline sharply around 390 nm due to the intrinsic absorption of ZnO (3.2 eV, corresponding to 387.5 nm).56 The PBGs of the as-designed ZnO-PCs are centered at about 450, 510, and 590 nm for ZnO-182, ZnO-222 and ZnO-277, respectively, which match well with the SPR absorption of Au NPs (around 540 nm) as the absorption edges of PBGs are overlapped with or out of the Au NP SPR absorption. As shown in Fig. 6a, ZnO-P shows no other transmission peak except the intrinsic absorption of ZnO. It demonstrates that the disordered porous ZnO cannot give rise to Bragg diffraction and has no SP effect. Thus, ZnO-P can be selected here as a reference sample for no SP effect. Au/ZnO-P exhibits an obvious visible light absorption around 540 nm due to the SPR absorption of Au NPs. For ZnO-182, the PBG absorption (centered at 450 nm) edges are out of the SPR absorption of Au NPs (located at 540 nm). It indicates that the SP effect is not coupled with the SPR effect. Compared with Au/ZnO-P, Au/ZnO-182 presents a high light trapping efficiency due to the Bragg diffraction. The PBG of Au/ZnO-182 has almost no change compared to ZnO-182, which implies that the structure of ZnO-PC is preserved well after Au NP deposition. It agrees well with the results observed by SEM and TEM (Fig. 3b). The RSP (propagation at the red-edge of the PBG) of ZnO-222 localizes in the high dielectric part (nano-framework) of the PC and spreads to the red-edge of the PBG, which coincides with the SPR absorption of Au NPs. Au/ZnO-222 shows a broader absorption ranging from 490 nm to 620 nm. For ZnO-277, the BSP (propagation at the blue-edge of the PBG) localizes in the low dielectric part (generally the medium filled in the void) of the PC and overlaps with SPR of Au NPs. Au NPs are filled in the void and are the lower dielectric part compared to ZnO. Obviously, the SP effect of this Au/ZnO-PC hybrid can increase the effective path length of light within the matrix, consequently reinforcing the interaction between SPs and Au NPs. Among the samples, Au/ZnO-277 displays the most efficient visible light absorption ranging from 520 nm to 650 nm and its BSP of the PC matched well with the SPR of Au NPs. Thus, the Au/ZnO-277 photocatalyst is expected to display efficient photocatalysis.
 Fig. 6  Transmission spectra of ZnO-PCs and Au/ZnO-PCs (the black arrows represent their PBGs). 
Hence, combining the data of SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and the transmission spectrum we can suggest that the incorporation of Au NPs into the inverse opal structure of the ZnO-PC has been readily achieved via the template method and the facile magnetron sputtering, leading to 3D ordered porous Au/ZnO-PC heterostructures. It is reasonable to speculate that these hybrid nanomaterials are promising photocatalysts in view of the excellent light harvesting and the mono-dispersivity of Au NPs on the nano-framework of ZnO-PCs.
3.3. Evaluation of photocatalytic activity

3.3.1. Repeatability and reproducibility of the Au/ZnO-PC. 
Three ZnO-222 and three Au/ZnO-222 samples were fabricated and evaluated by the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation to evaluate the reproducibility of the preparation method and the photocatalytic stability of the samples. The results (Fig. 7a) confirm that the photocatalytic activity is reproducible within a negligible mean deviation of 0.78%.

(c) The kinetics and (d) the kinetic constants of RhB degradation using various photocatalysts under visible light irradiation. 


3.3.2. Adsorption ability of the Au/ZnO-PC. 
The adsorption of reactants on a catalyst is generally a key step for the catalytic reaction.57Fig. 7b shows the adsorption capacity of RhB over ZnO and Au/ZnO samples in the dark. It is clear that ZnO-PCs show higher adsorption capacity than ZnO-P and ZnO-N, which is caused by the 3D ordered porous structure of the ZnO-PC. Among ZnO-PCs, the adsorption capacity decreases with the pore size due to the decrease of surface area. The phenomenon agrees well with our and others' previous reports.43,58 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7b, the adsorption of RhB can be substantially improved by the deposition of Au NPs. Thus, it can be drawn that the introduction of Au NPs into ZnO-PCs not only facilitates the visible-light harvesting but also the adsorption of RhB.


3.3.3. Photocatalytic activities of Au/ZnO-PCs. 

Fig. 7c shows the degradation of RhB over prepared samples. To perform a fair comparison among the Au/ZnO-PCs, all the catalyst films have the same size and were sputtered by Au for the same time (60 s) (the effect of the Au amount on the activity was also investigated by varying the sputtering time as the deposition amount of Au is proportional to the time. When the sputtering time was more than or less than 60 s, the activity of the Au/ZnO-PC would be reduced (Fig. S4†)). The only difference is the PBG positions. Fig. 7c shows the linear correlation of ln(C/C0) with irradiation time. The results demonstrate that the degradation of RhB over Au/ZnO-PCs follows a pseudo-first-order kinetics.59 The corresponding kinetic constants are presented in Fig. 7d. The adsorption of RhB on the Au/ZnO-PC in the dark and direct photolysis of RhB over the glass substrate served as control experiments. It is clearly observed that RhB cannot be degraded over the Au/ZnO-PC in the dark or over the glass substrate under irradiation, excluding the possibility that the photolysis and the glass substrates contribute to the degradation of RhB. ZnO samples, including ZnO-PCs, ZnO-P and ZnO-NPs, all exhibit visible-light activity due to the dye photosensitization. ZnO-PCs expose higher photocatalytic efficiency than ZnO-P, ZnO-NPs and TiO2−xNx. The enhancement could be attributed to the intensified dye photosensitization caused by the PC effect.58 Compared to ZnO-P, the high activity of Au/ZnO-P can be ascribed to the enlarged optical response arising from the SPR of Au NPs. Among the Au/ZnO photocatalysts, Au/ZnO-277 which combines the advantages of BSP and SPR, displays the highest activity (the BET surface areas of Au/ZnO-182, Au/ZnO-222 and Au/ZnO-277 are demonstrated to be about 21.2, 16.3 and 13.1 cm2 g−1, respectively (Fig. S5†). And there is a slight difference of the temperatures (within the range of 2 °C) between Au/ZnO and ZnO samples (Fig. S6†). Therefore, the surface area and the system temperature are not crucial to the photocatalytic activity of Au/ZnO-277).42 The kinetic constant of Au/ZnO-277 is 24.8-fold and 5.6-fold than that of ZnO-NPs and TiO2−xNx (a widely used reference for evaluating the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity49), respectively. These new hierarchical hybrid photocatalysts not only utilize the SPR of Au NPs to extend the light response region, but also exploit the PC effect of ZnO-277 whose slow photons coincide with the absorptions of Au NPs and RhB absorption and consequently can strength the plasmonic absorption and photosensitization efficiency. Au/ZnO-182 exhibits the lowest kinetic constant among Au/ZnO-PCs, which is attributed to the inefficient light harvesting because of the mismatching of the PBG with the wavelength of the plasmonic absorption of Au NPs (Fig. 6b). The kinetic constant of Au/ZnO-222 is larger than that of Au/ZnO-182 but lower than that of Au/ZnO-277. The k of Au/ZnO-222 is larger than Au/ZnO-182 as its PBG can be extended to the visible light range and matches well with the SPR absorption of Au NPs (indicated by Fig. 6c). On the other hand, specifically the RSP of ZnO-222 coincides with the SPR of Au NPs, while the BSP of ZnO-277 overlaps with the SPR of Au NPs (Fig. 6d). RSP localized in the high dielectric part (nano-framework) of the PC and BSP localized in the low dielectric part (generally the medium filled in the void) of the PC. For the Au/ZnO-PC hybrid, ZnO nano-frameworks are the high dielectric part, Au NPs are the low dielectric part. In addition, when Au/ZnO-277 was used to photocatalytically degrade RhB solution, RhB in the solution and RhB adsorbed on the nano-framework are also both the low dielectric part. Therefore SP reinforced the light interaction with Au NPs and RhB is BSP. Au/ZnO-277 exhibits the most efficient visible light absorption and SP effect compared to Au/ZnO-222.
The degradation of RhB is further confirmed by analyzing the mineralization of the solution with the total organic carbon (TOC) technique. Fig. S7† clearly indicates that Au/ZnO-277 shows the highest mineralization efficiency of RhB compared to Au/ZnO-P and other Au/ZnO-PC samples under visible light irradiation. It means that the reactive species produced on Au/ZnO photocatalysts not only can decolor RhB, but also can mineralize it to CO2.
To avoid the photosensitization degradation process, 4-chlorophenol (4-CP, 4 ppm) which shows no absorption in the visible light region (colorless) was further selected as a probe molecule to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized Au/ZnO photocatalysts. As shown in Fig. S8,† the photocatalytic activity and the mineralization rate decrease in the order Au/ZnO-277 > Au/ZnO-222 > Au/ZnO-182 > Au/ZnO-P > ZnO-277. The sequence is consistent with their performance for RhB degradation. Bare ZnO-277 shows no activity for 4-CP degradation. This control test indicates that the degradation of 4-CP over Au/ZnO photocatalysts is due to the excitation of Au NPs, rather than a photosensitization process. That is to say, the overlapping BSP of Au/ZnO-277 with the SPR of Au NPs is not only responsible for the degradation of RhB, but also for the colorless 4-CP.

3.4. Photocatalytic and composite stability of the Au/ZnO-PC
A cyclic experiment for the degradation of RhB was performed over Au/ZnO-277 to further evaluate the photocatalytic stability of the Au/ZnO-PC. As shown in Fig. 8a, the decoloration of RhB is about 90% in the first run over Au/ZnO-277 after irradiation for 120 min. The degradation efficiency can be largely remained in the successive 4 cycles, indicating the stability of Au/ZnO-277. The used sample after the cyclic experiment was further characterized by XPS and XRD techniques and compared to the fresh one to investigate whether its surface or crystalline structure is changed. As shown in Fig. 8b and c, the binding energies of Zn 2p and Au 4f show no apparent change and are almost identical to the fresh one, suggesting the stability of the surficial structure. The crystalline stability can be confirmed by the XRD patterns as shown in Fig. 8d, indicating that no significant change occurs in the bulk phase. Thus, the stability of the as-synthesized Au/ZnO-PCs can be approved by these results.

3.5. Mechanism
A number of diagnostic experiments, including the measurements of the formation of photoinduced charger carriers and the effect of active radical species on the photocatalytic reaction, were performed to study the photocatalytic mechanism of the Au/ZnO-PC. A photocatalysis process can be considered as the generation, separation, transportation, and consumption of the photoinduced charge carriers.3,4 When a photocatalyst is excited by incident light whose energy (hν) is larger than the band gap energy of the photocatalyst, equal amounts of holes (h+) and electrons (e−) will be generated in the bulk. After transferring to the photocatalyst surface, h+ could abstract electrons from absorbed pollutants or react with H2O to form hydroxyl radicals (·OH), while e− could be trapped by O2 to generate superoxide radicals (·O2−), which can further disproportionate to produce ·OH via chain reactions. ·OH and ·O2− are mainly active species and are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation reactions.

3.5.1. Stronger PC effect for electron generation and enhanced separation efficiency of electron–holes. 
The production capacity and the separation efficiency of photogenerated h+ and e− were investigated by photoelectrochemical measurements.60–62 The photocurrent–time (i–t) profiles with zero bias electrode potential are shown in Fig. 9a. The ZnO-277 electrode was used as a reference and exhibits almost no photocurrent response under visible light irradiation due to its wide band-gap energy. However, a fast and uniform photocurrent response can be observed for each switch-on and -off event for all Au/ZnO electrodes. The photocurrent densities of Au/ZnO-PCs are higher than that of Au/ZnO-P due to the PC effect. Au/ZnO-277 displays the highest photocurrent density than other Au/ZnO-PCs, followed by Au/ZnO-222 and Au/ZnO-182. The order agrees well with their photocatalytic activities. Generally, a high photocurrent density suggests the high formation and separation efficiency of photoinduced charge carriers.61,62 This result is also supported by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis (Fig. 9b). Among Au/ZnO photocatalysts, the impedance component of Au/ZnO-277 is supposed to be reduced. It is demonstrated that the as-designed Au/ZnO-277 has the highest separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes.
 Fig. 9  (a) Photocurrent response and (b) EIS spectra of Au/ZnO-PC photoanodes in Na2SO4 solution under visible light irradiation. 
As mentioned above, the slowed incident light is primarily located on the Au NPs in Au/ZnO-277, whereas on ZnO for Au/ZnO-222. Therefore, Au/ZnO-277 is able to trap more photons which results in a larger population of photogenerated e−. As a result, Au/ZnO-277 exhibits higher photocurrent density and lower impedance than Au/ZnO-222. Moreover, the photocurrent density is declined when the PBG is far away from the SPR absorption of Au NPs (Au/ZnO-182), which confirmed their photocatalytic activities for the degradation of RhB.


3.5.2. Effect of active species on the photocatalytic reaction. 
To explore the role of the active radical species in the degradation of RhB over Au/ZnO-PCs, different types of scavengers were introduced into the RhB solution. As shown in Fig. 10, the degradation k of RhB over Au/ZnO-277 is 1.24 h−1 without any scavengers. When in the O2-saturated RhB solution, the k enhances moderately to 1.56 h−1. This is because the dissolved O2 is highly electrophilic and can react easily with the photogenerated e− to form ·O2−, which can improve the separation efficiency of e− and h+ pairs.63 However, in the N2-saturated RhB solution, the k decreases significantly (0.31 h−1). A similar result also can be observed for the benzoquinone (BQ, served as an ·O2− scavenger65) added experiment. These results suggest that the ·O2− plays an important role in the photocatalytic process. Moreover, the k of the BQ-added reaction system is comparable to that of the N2-saturated reaction system. That means·O2− cannot be produced when O2 was eliminated from the reaction system. It is confirmed that O2 trapped electrons to form ·O2−, then ·O2− participates in the photocatalytic reaction. As for the tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, served as an ·OH-scavenger64) added reaction, the k also decreased (0.74 h−1). Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the degradation of RhB is mainly trigged by ·O2−, which is formed via trapping of O2 by photoinduced e−. Meanwhile, ·OH also promotes the process of the photocatalytic reaction. The following ESR experiments also demonstrate that more quantities of active species are generated in the Au/ZnO-277 system than that in other Au/ZnO-PC systems due to the coupling effect of the SP and SPR effect.

3.5.3. More quantities of active species produced during the photocatalytic reaction. 
The formation of ·O2− and ·OH radicals was directly determined by the DMPO spin-trapping ESR technique.66 As presented in Fig. 11, the characteristic peaks of the DMPO-·OH adduct and the DMPO-·O2− adduct are observed obviously for Au/ZnO-277 under visible light irradiation, whereas no such signals can be detected using ZnO-277 and DMPO water or methanol solution. This further confirmed that ·O2− and ·OH are responsible for the photocatalytic degradation reaction. Moreover, it should be noted that the signal intensities of the DMPO-·O2− and DMPO-·OH adducts formed in the Au/ZnO-277 suspension are strongest, followed by Au/ZnO-222, Au/ZnO-182, and Au/ZnO-P, which is consistent with their photocatalytic activities.
 Fig. 11  ESR spectra of the radical adduct trapped by DMPO in ZnO-PC or Au/ZnO-PC dispersions under visible light: (a) DMPO-·OH formed in aqueous dispersion; (b) DMPO-·O2− formed in methanol dispersion. 
Furthermore, the DPD method was employed for detecting the existence of H2O2.50 Because, in the visible-light-driven M/S (here, S is the semiconductor which cannot be excited by visible light) photocatalytic reaction system, ·OH comes from ·O2−via chain reactions, and H2O2 is an important intermediate species in this process.52 As displayed in Fig. 12, in the presence of either the Au/ZnO-PC or Au/ZnO-P under visible light irradiation for 1 h, two obvious characteristic peaks with absorption maxima at about 550 nm and 510 nm are observed clearly, indicating the formation of H2O2. While for ZnO-277 and H2O, no obvious peaks are observed under the same conditions. Thus, it can be inferred that H2O2 is actually produced due to the introduction of Au NPs into ZnO. The formation amount of H2O2 also decreases in the order Au/ZnO-277 > Au/ZnO-222 > Au/ZnO-182 > Au/ZnO-P, which is in good agreement with the measurement of ·O2− and ·OH (Fig. 11).

3.5.4. Possible photocatalytic mechanism. 
A schematic mechanism of the photocatalytic process that occurred on the Au/ZnO-PC is illustrated in Scheme 2 based on the above experimental results. The Au/ZnO-277 not only uses the SPR of Au NPs to widen the light absorption range to visible light, but also develops the SP effect of the ZnO-PC whose BSP coincided with the wavelengths of SPR absorption by Au NPs and RhB absorption. The designed hybrid sample can intensify the absorption of visible light, and consequently improve the yield of photogenerated e− under visible light irradiation. Photoinduced e− are generated from the activated Au NPs or RhB, which are then injected into the conduction band of ZnO-277 and captured by the adsorbed O2 to form ·O2−. ·O2− can be further transformed into ·OH. Both ·O2− and ·OH have strong oxidative abilities, and therefore can degrade RhB into CO2 and H2O. Simultaneously, the oxidized Au NPs trap electrons from RhB or H2O adsorbed on their surface to neutralize the positive charges, leading to the regeneration of the photocatalyst.

4. Conclusions
In summary, Au/ZnO-PCs with a well inverse opal structure were successfully synthesized through a facile template method. By changing the pore size, the PBG of ZnO-PCs can be designed to overlap with or away from the SPR absorption of Au NPs. Among these Au/ZnO-PCs, the photocatalytic activity can be enhanced maximally when the blue edge of its PBG is located on the SPR absorption of Au NPs. The SP effect on the intensified light harvesting, effective separation of the photogenerated carriers and more quantities of active species account for the enhancement. Furthermore, we conclude that ·O2− and ·OH derived from ·O2−via chain reactions are the main active species and finally result in efficient organic pollutant degradation. These results suggest that implementation of the heterojunction photocatalyst in the form of a photonic crystal to manipulate the behavior of the photons and carriers is a facile and effective approach for enhancing the photocatalytic activity. This work provides useful information for exploring effective visible-light-driven photocatalysts with a photonic crystal structure.
