    AbstractSignificant progress is being made in the photovoltaic energy conversion using soluble small organic molecules. We report the fabrication of layered heterojunction solar cells with 3% power conversion efficiency consisting of a solution-processed cyanine dye, C60 and doped polyaniline anode layers that match the cyanine energy level and facilitate hole extraction.
Solution-processed organic solar cells are promising devices for inexpensive, large-scale solar energy conversion. Polymer solar cells are still leading the field,1 but recent work has demonstrated that, with soluble small organic molecules, layered and bulk heterojunction devices can be fabricated with power conversion efficiencies (η) above 1% as well.2
In any of these thin-film architectures, charge injection occurs at the interfaces formed by the organic materials and electrodes. The dynamics of this heterogeneous charge transfer depends on the electronic coupling between electrode and active material, as well as on the free energy before and after the transfer step. Efficient electron and hole injection generally requires that the energy barrier for charge transfer is small.3a,b Interfacial layers, mobile ions to induce interfacial space charge, or chemical doping have been used to lower the barriers for hole and electron injection at the anode and cathode, thereby facilitating charge transfer.3c–e
Here, we report on cyanine dye (CyP)/C60 bilayer photovoltaic devices and show that by using polyaniline (PANI) as ITO overlayer, the energy offset at the anode–CyP interface can be importantly reduced. Thereby, hole injection was facilitated and the power conversion efficiency increased markedly to η = 3%. Cyanines belong to the class of polymethine dyes and are characterized by high solubility, low tendency to crystallization such as tunable and very strong light absorption, and have found applications as photographic sensitizers, as fluorescent labels or, more recently, in dye-sensitized and organic solar cells.4
Poly(styrene sulfonate), (PSS), doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT:PSS, is often used in organic solar cells as a smoothing buffer layer5a between ITO and the active materials to improve device performance.3a However, as can be seen from Fig. 1, the energy gap between the HOMO energy levels of PEDOT:PSS and the cyanine dye is rather large (>0.5 eV), potentially resulting in unfavourable hole transfer kinetics.5b This suggests that a high-work function hole-extracting anode layer could be more advantageous in conjunction with cyanine dyes.

Electrically conducting and optically transparent layers can also be fabricated with PANI.6 PANI is a unique polymer due to its relative ease of synthesis from low-cost materials, stability and tunable doping–dedoping chemistry. By adding protonic acids PANI is made soluble and can be converted from the insulating to a conductive state. Thus, doped PANI can be processed in its conductive form. PANI has been used as a transparent electrode in organic light-emitting diodes, but very little has been reported on the use of PANI for organic solar cells,6c,d and the specific merit of PANI in our case, namely having a considerably higher work function than PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 1), has not been harnessed so far.
Materials and methods for solar cell fabrication and characterization were adopted from recent work.2b,g PANI doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBS) was synthesized with aniline sulfate using ammonium persulfate (APS) in water, and the resulting PANI:DBS was extracted using toluene and methyl ethyl ketone.7 Nanoscale dispersions of PANI:PSS in water were prepared via dispersion polymerization with aniline and APS, and PSS was used as both doping and stabilizing agent.7 Layers of PEDOT:PSS (Sigma-Aldrich, conductivity 1 S cm−1), PANI and CyP (FEW Chemicals, dissolved in 3,3,4,4-tetrafluoropropanol) were spin coated from filtered solutions; the layer thicknesses were adjusted via the spinning speed and measured with a profilometer. C60 (SES Research, 99.9%), Alq3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995%) and Al (Cerac, 99.999%) were deposited by thermal sublimation under vacuum at a pressure of ∼2 × 10−6 mbar. ITO/PANI substrates were either used as-coated (air-dried), dried in vacuum (20 mbar) at ambient temperature over night or heated to 200 °C for 30 s before processing. The frontier molecular orbital energy levels were taken from the literature;2b,8a for PANI:DBS, we measured −5.4 eV with cyclic voltammetry on electrochemically deposited films, in agreement with literature.8b Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under simulated solar irradiation using the spectrum of a 300 W Xe lamp together with an AM1.5G filter set. The light intensity was calibrated in order to correspond to standard solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 for full sun.2g A monochromator was used together with the Xe lamp to measure the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE). SEM micrographs were taken by a field emission gun (Hitachi S-4800) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. AFM measurements were performed on a Nanosurf Mobile S in tapping mode at a resonance frequency of 170 kHz using silicon cantilevers.
White-light J–V characteristics for CyP/C60 bilayer solar cells with PEDOT:PSS or PANI:DBS layers are displayed in Fig. 2. For all devices, a thin layer of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium (Alq3) was inserted between C60 and aluminium to achieve an ohmic contact at the cathode.8a The J–V curve for PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2, empty squares) was clearly unfavourable which is attributed to the inefficient hole transfer across the CyP/PEDOT:PSS interface, resulting in unbalanced charge collection and a low fill factor and open-circuit voltage. The concave J–V trend and low Voc value persisted when the individual film thicknesses were changed, and the PEDOT:PSS/CyP efficiency could not be further improved.

J–V characteristics (100 mW cm−2) of ITO/X/CyP(30 nm)/C60(40 nm)/Alq3(2.5 nm)/Al(60 nm) solar cells. Empty squares: X = PEDOT:PSS(60 nm), Jsc = −5.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.44 V, FF = 0.25, η = 0.65%. Triangles: X = annealed PANI:DBS(30 nm), Jsc = −7.62 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 0.40, η = 2.1%. Filled squares: X = vacuum-dried PANI:DBS(30 nm), Jsc = −6.92 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.61, η = 3.0%. 
Much better diode behaviour and a substantial increase of Voc was achieved with a corresponding ITO/PANI:DBS solar cell, where the ITO/PANI:DBS substrate was dried in vacuum overnight at ambient temperature before processing (Fig. 2, filled squares). The optimal thicknesses for PANI:DBS, CyP and C60 were found iteratively by adjusting the three layers between 20 nm and 70 nm. Rather strong performance variations with varying layer thicknesses were observed, as demonstrated for PANI:DBS with a set of IPCE curves in Fig. 3. The pronounced IPCE variations are mainly attributed to optical interference effects in these multilayer devices.9a
 Fig. 3  IPCE curves of ITO/PANI:DBS/CyP(30 nm)/C60(40 nm)/Alq3(2.5 nm)/Al(60 nm) solar cells fabricated with air-dried PANI:DBS layers of 20 nm (filled squares), 40 nm (empty squares) and 60 nm (triangles) thickness. 
The measured efficiency of η = 3% for the best-performing 30 nm thick vacuum-dried PANI:DBS layer is one of the highest performance achieved with solution-processed small molecules so far. The improved solar cell efficiency was reflected in high IPCE values with substantial contributions of both CyP (above ∼450 nm) and C60 (below ∼450 nm) (Fig. 4, filled squares). Also included is the UV spectrum of a 30 nm thick, vacuum-dried PANI:DBS layer showing the characteristic absorption of the emeraldine salt form of PANI at 440 nm and the broad absorption band extending to the infrared region (dotted line).6 The absorption of PANI:DBS was not a device-limiting factor, since the transmittance is greater than 90% throughout the wavelength region where the active components absorb.
 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of a 30 nm thick vacuum-dried PANI:DBS film (dotted line) and of the corresponding complete solar cell (dashed line), and IPCE values of solar cells with PEDOT:PSS (empty squares), annealed PANI:DBS (triangles) and vacuum-dried PANI:DBS (filled squares) layers. 
Note that the IPCE for the vacuum-dried PANI:DBS solar cell did not match the corresponding absorption spectrum (Fig. 4, dashed line), but exhibits a maximum at ∼540 nm where the cell absorption has a local minimum, and extends with another peak at wavelengths above ∼580 nm where the cyanine dye absorption levels off. This trend is termed antibatic behaviour, and originates from light that is absorbed in the cyanine layer far away from the charge-generating CyP/C60 interface, so that excitons can not reach the heterojunction and decay ineffectively. Antibatic IPCE behaviour was not observed when PEDOT:PSS was used as anode layer (Fig. 4, empty squares), albeit the CyP thicknesses in the PEDOT:PSS and PANI:DBS device were equal (light absorbances at 560 nm were 0.55 and 0.53, respectively).
We ascribe this difference in IPCE response to a solvent-induced surface wrinkling of the anode layer, when CyP is spin coated onto vacuum-dried PANI:DBS. Indeed, we verified with absorption spectra before and after casting pure solvent that 3,3,4,4-tetrafluoropropanol (TFP) did not dissolve PANI:DBS, but a slight swelling of the polymer layer was readily identifiable (Fig. 5a,b). Very likely, CyP diffuses into the swollen PANI:DBS layer and is trapped upon solvent evaporation; thereby, a fraction of dye molecules is further away from—and probably with non-connecting pathways to—the CyP/C60 interface, and merely acts as a light-absorbing filter not contributing to photocurrent. For PEDOT:PSS, on the other hand, no film swelling occurs when TFP is spin coated, and a smooth IPCE curve was observed.

The antibatic IPCE trend was largely removed when the ITO/PANI:DBS(30 nm) substrate was heated to 200 °C for 30 s before processing (Fig. 4, triangles). Annealing induced partial cross linking and the film became inert against TFP.6 However, this process was accompanied by a fractional dedoping of PANI:DBS as evident from the corresponding absorption spectra, and the characteristic emeraldine salt transitions at ∼(420–440) nm and ∼750 nm became much smaller for the heat-treated film, whereas the two absorption peaks characteristic for the dedoped emeraldine base at ∼340 nm and ∼600 nm appeared (data not shown). PANI:DBS cross linking and associated changes in film morphology6a resulted in reduced hole transport and the improved IPCE upon heating was not translated into an overall efficiency improvement (Fig. 2, triangles); compared to vacuum-dried PANI:DBS, similar values were measured for Jsc and Voc, but the fill factor was lower (FF = 0.4) resulting in a decreased efficiency (η = 2.1%).
Preliminary experiments were carried out using PANI:PSS that also forms organic-solvent inert films. PANI:PSS exists as a nanoscale dispersion (particle diameter ∼40 nm7b) in water. Filtered (5 μm) solutions were spin coated onto ITO coated glass to form PANI:PSS films with an average thickness of ∼40 nm that were dried for 30 min at 80 °C to remove the water without inducing cross linking. Both the IPCE curve and I–V characteristics of PANI:PSS and annealed PANI:DBS solar cells were very similar, and also for PANI:PSS the performance under white light suffered primarily from a low fill factor (Jsc = −6.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.7 V, FF = 0.22, η = 1.1%, data not shown). We suspect this to be because of an inhomogeneous thin-film formation due to the nanosized PANI:PSS particles (Fig. 5c,d).7b
We suppose that PANI has not found widespread use so far for solution-processed organic solar cells because some of the best-performing electron donor materials have HOMO energy levels at around −5 eV and form an ohmic or near-ohmic contact to the widely-used PEDOT:PSS.1b,10a Very recently, Bejbouji et al.6d used water and organic solvent-based PANI films as hole injection layers in poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester bulk heterojunction solar cells. However, the power-conversion efficiency (η = 2.5%) using PANI was substantially lower than the achievable performance of η = (4.8–5.1%) reported for this active material system when using PEDOT:PSS.10b As demonstrated here for a cyanine dye, PANI is beneficial for organic components with lower-lying redox levels, and we suspect that PANI might result in improved device efficiencies for a number of other material systems based on polymers10a and small molecules as well (e.g., merocyanine dyes with HOMO levels (−5.7 ± 0.1) eV,2c,i subnaphthalocyanine = −5.4 eV2e). Alternatives to PEDOT:PSS might become important because one chemical strategy to improve solar cell efficiencies includes lowering the HOMO energy level of the electron donor materials, which increases the open-circuit voltage.1b We finally accentuate the versatility of the PANI synthesis, because there exist a number of doping and complexing agents to adjust the conductivity and necessary PANI-insolubility in organic solvents.
