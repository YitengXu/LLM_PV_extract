    , Accepted 17th May 2012First published on 6th June 2012AbstractA facile and low-cost approach has been developed to fabricate CuO mesoporous nanosheet cluster arrays (MNCAs) directly grown on a Cu substrate via an ammonia vapor-phase corrosion route. As integrated anodes for lithium-ion batteries without binders and conductivity agents, CuO MNCAs exhibit a high reversible capacity of 639.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C rate and a high-rate capability of 548.8 mA h g−1 at 10C rate. Excellent lithium-storage properties may be ascribed to the unique MNCA structure, which offers a large surface to volume ratio that favors lithium-storage, and provides a large free space to alleviate the large volume variation during the charge–discharge process. The strategy of vapor-phase corrosion is promising for use in the construction other nanoarchitectured materials for high power applications.
Introduction
As an important transition-metal oxide, p-type semiconductor, copper oxide (CuO) has been much extensively exploited for widespread applications in the photon sensing,1 magnetic storage media,2 lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),3 solar cell devices,4 and so on. Among these potential applications, CuO is a very promising candidate to replace used commercial graphite in LIBs due to its high theoretical capacity (674 mA h g−1), low cost, high safety and environmental benignity.5 Nevertheless, its huge and uneven volume expansion of about 174% upon lithium uptake brings about the pulverization and deterioration of CuO, and consequently rapid capacity decay and poor capacity retention.6 To overcome these drawbacks, one feasible approach is to configure nanoarchitectured electrodes.7–11 This kind of electrode consists of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures directly grown on a conductive current collector, whose 1D nanostructure act as both active material and conductive backbone. The unique nanoarchitectured structure provides a large free space to allow fast Li+ flux across the interface and alleviates the large volume variation during the Li+ uptake/release process, suppressing electrode material degradation.12 In this regard, CuO nanofibers13 nanotubes,14 nanoribbons,15 nanorods,16 cog-like superstructures,17 hierarchical nanostructrued and 3D flowerlike nanostructured CuO18,19 have been fabricated via solution-immersion and microemulsion, etc. For example, CuO nanorods16 prepared by Lou delivered a reversible capacity of 590 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C rate (1C = 674 mA g−1), and the cog-like CuO17 reported by Zhang exhibited a high capacity of 583 mA h g−1 at 4C rate. Despite enhanced lithium-storage properties, their preparations require special equipment, complicated and cumbersome procedures, or various surfactants. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop a facile and low-cost route to the large-scale synthesize nanoarchitectured electrodes to meet the requirements of high energy and power density LIBs for application in electric and hybrid vehicles.
In this work, we develop a facile approach for the large-scale fabrication of CuO mesoporous nanosheet cluster arrays (MNCAs) directly grown on a Cu substrate via an ammonia vapor-phase corrosion route (see Scheme 1). As the integrated CuO MNCAs electrodes for LIBs without binders and conductivity agents, CuO MNCAs exhibit a high reversible capacity of 639.8 mA h g−1 for the 100th cycle at 1C rate and a high-rate capability of 548.8 mA h g−1 at 10C rate. The fabrication strategy is simple, low-cost, and provides a novel route to construct other nanoarchitectured materials for high power applications.

Experimental
Synthesis
In a typical procedure, a red copper strip (5 cm × 5 cm) was cleaned in 1.0 M (mol L−1) HCl solution for 5 min, followed by rinsing with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried under N2 gas flow. The as-treated Cu substrate was lain on the top of a wild-mouth bottle filled with ammonia solution (NH3·H2O:H2O = 1:6 vol) at 20 °C. The distance between the Cu substrate and the liquid level of the ammonia solution was kept at ca. 2 cm. After a certain time, blue Cu(OH)2 products were grown on the Cu substrate, and then washed with ethanol. The Cu(OH)2/Cu substrate was dried in N2 gas, heated in a sealed furnace with N2 at 120 °C for 2 h to completely dehydrate the sample, and then maintained at 180 °C for 2 h to promote crystallization.
Physical characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was gained on a Rigaku D/max-γB spectrometer with monochromated Cu Kα radiation (45 kV, 50 mA). The morphology of samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM2100) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Additionally, N2 physiorption experiments were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP2020 system, and specific surface areas and pore size distribution of samples were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Jovner–Halenda (BJH) formalisms, respectively.
Electrochemical evaluation
Electrochemical measurements were carried out using coin type (CR2025) testing cells, which were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (Mbraum). CuO MNCAs grown on the Cu substrate were used directly as the working electrode without binders and conductivity agents, 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate and ethylmethyl carbonate (EC–DMC–EMC, 1:1:1 vol) as the electrolyte, two porous polypropylene membranes as a separator, and Li foil as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The mass of active materials was calculated at ca. 0.7 mg by subtracting the weight of the Cu substrate from the overall weight of the CuO MNCAs/Cu substrate obtained by the ammonia vapor-phase corrosion for 3 h. The cells were aged for 8 h before measurement. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI, 660 d) between 3.0 and 0.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The discharge–charge tests were conducted at various rates within a voltage window from 3.0 V to 0.02 V (vs. Li+/Li) on the BTS battery testing system (Neware, Shenzhen, China). Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out on a Parstat 2273 advanced electrochemical systems in the frequency range mainly from 100 kHz to 10 mHz with the a.c. signal amplitude of 5 mV.
Results and discussion
Cu(OH)2 nanosheet cluster arrays (NCAs) on a Cu substrate could be obtained by the parallel or sequential chemical reactions20,21 that occurred in association with the volatility of ammonia solutions. NH3·H2O → NH3(g) + H2O(g)(1) Cu + NH3 + O2 → Cu[NH3]2+n(2) Cu[NH3]2+n + H2O → Cu(OH)2(3)
Powder XRD patterns in Fig. 1A reveal the crystallinity and phase purity of the Cu(OH)2 NCAs. Removing the Cu signals from the Cu substrate, all the diffraction peaks could be indexed to the orthorhombic layered structure of Cu(OH)2, corresponding to JCPDF:13-0420 (a = 0.2949 nm, b = 1.059 nm, c = 0.5256 nm).

Morphological characterization of Cu(OH)2 NCAs: (B) low-magnification SEM image, (C) high-magnification SEM image showing the thickness of an individual nanosheet ca. 50 nm, (D) side-view showing the height (0.8–1 μm) of nanosheet arrays directly grown on the Cu substrate, (E) TEM image of an individual nanosheet ca. 250 nm in width, and the inset shows the corresponding single crystal electron diffraction (ED) pattern viewed from the [010] zone axis of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2, and (F) HRTEM image showing the (002) crystal plane aligned to the lower left edge of an individual nanosheet. 

Fig. 1B–D show the SEM images of Cu(OH)2 NCAs synthesised by the ammonia vapor-phase corrosion for 3 h at 20 °C. The Cu(OH)2 NCAs with a height of ∼0.8 μm lie parallel to the Cu substrate, and are made up of a large number of nanosheets with a width of ∼250 nm and a thickness of ∼50 nm, three or more nanosheets then assemble to from a cluster. Further structure information is provided by TEM images of a single Cu(OH)2 nanosheet in Fig. 1E and F. Obviously, the individual nanosheet is a single crystal of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 with crystallographic [100] (a axis) and [001] (c axis) directions, as is evidenced by the corresponding electron diffraction (ED) pattern (inset of Fig. 1E). And the fringe spacing of 0.263 nm corresponds to the distance between the (002) crystal planes. These results strongly indicate that Cu(OH)2 NCAs have a highly ordered crystalline structure.
By thermally induced dehydration and crystallization, Cu(OH)2 NCAs can be totally transformed into CuO MNCAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, the XRD pattern of CuO MNCAs demonstrates that the CuO possesses a monoclinic structure, according to the standard card JCPDF: 65-2309. The SEM images in Fig. 2B–D show that after annealing, the CuO products retain well the nanosheet morphology of the precursor Cu(OH)2 NCAs without any aggregation or collapse. The TEM images in Fig. 2E indicate that a single CuO nanosheet has a ploycrystalline nature, which is confirmed by the concentric diffraction rings and some high-lighted spots on the rings of the select area ED pattern. The marked interplanar d spacings of 0.251 and 0.229 nm in Fig. 2F agree well with the distances of (11) and (110) crystal planes of monoclinic CuO, inspite the lattice fringes usually being discontinuous or wavy. The polycrystalline nature of CuO is beneficial to the enhancement of the following lithium-storage properties.22

As the integrated nanoarchitectured anodes for LIBs, the electrochemical behavior of the CuO MNCAs was examined by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) in Fig. 3A. In the first discharge process, these reduction peaks correspond to the multi-step electrochemical reactions:23 (4) (5) (6)

(B) Discharge–charge curves (1st, 2nd and 10th), (C) cycling performance and coulombic efficiency, (D) rate cyclability and (E) rate discharge–charge plots of CuO MNCAs at various rates. The inset of (C) shows the SEM image of CuO MNCAs achieved at 1C rate after 50 cycles. (F) Schematic diagram showing the discharge–charge process of CuO MNCAs. 
In the subsequent charge process, two wide oxide peaks can be indexed to the formation of Cu2O and oxidation from Cu2O to CuO, respectively. In the subsequent CV cycles, the reductive and oxidative peaks almost stay at the same potentials, indicating a high degree of reversibility of the redox reaction. From the discharge–charge curves at 0.2C rate in Fig. 3B, the discharge slopes with three plateaus demonstrate that multi-phase transition happens on the conversion reaction between CuO and lithium, which are consistent with the CVs with the multi-reductive peaks. The initial discharge and charge capacities are 965.7 and 532.8 mA g−1, and the irreversible capacity loss of 45% in the first discharge–charge cycle may be mainly attributed to interfacial lithium storage, the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and the electrolyte decomposition.24,25 Afterwards, reversible capacities are gradually increased, which is the result of the sufficient contacts between the electrode and electrolyte and the increased SEI film.
CuO MNCAs exhibit excellent cycling stability and high-rate performance. As shown in Fig. 3C, cycled at 1C rate, the maximal capacity of 681.2 mA h g−1 for the 30th cycle can be observed due to the reversible formation and decomposition of a polymeric gel-like film,24 and a high reversible capacity of 639.8 mA h g−1 is retained at the 100th cycle, for which the coulombic efficiency is generally ∼100% from the second cycle onward. Fig. 3D–E show the high-rate capability of CuO MNCAs at different discharge–charge rates. Obviously, the reversible capacity decreased slowly with the increase of discharge–charge rates, and high reversible capacity of 663.5, 573.5 and 548.8 mA h g−1 could be obtained at 0.2, 5 and 10C rates, successively. Upon decreasing the rate to 0.2C, reversible capacity reached 754.8 mA h g−1. The rate capability of CuO MNCAs is higher than other integrated CuO anodes and the polymer-blended anodes.15–17,25 Furthermore, while increasing the time of ammonia vapor-phase corrosion from 6 h to 24 h, CuO MNCAs with increased thickness could exhibit different rate capability and cyclability in Fig. 4. CuO MNCAs with the thickness of ∼1 μm still showed an excellent high-rate capability of 631.2, 570.0 and 539.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 5 and 10C rates. However, CuO MNCAs with the thickness of ∼1.2 μm exhibited depressed rate capabilities of 667.2, 462.3 and 379.0 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 5 and 10C rates, which may be ascribed to the adhesion strength between CuO MNCAs and the Cu substrate was weakened with the increase of the time of ammonia vapor-phase corrosion.

(a–a′) rate cyclability and (b–b′) rate discharge–charge plots of CuO MNCAs (A: 6 h) and (B: 24 h) at various rates, respectively. 
The above outstanding lithium-storage properties may be ascribed to the unique structure of CuO MNCAs. The Li+ uptake–release process of CuO MNCAs is depicted in Fig. 3F. As is well known, CuO MNCAs directly connected to the substrate can enhance the electronic conductivity.12 The residual Cu nanoparticles from the conversion reaction retained in the nanosheets can act as an electron transport path, and enhance the stability of the active materials.26,27 In addition to this, there are two main reasons for the performance as follows:
Firstly, CuO MNCAs have high surface areas. Fig. 5A shows that the BET surface area of CuO MNCAs gained by the ammonia vapor-phase corrosion for 3 h is 35.82 m2 g−1, much larger than the 7.81 m2 g−1 of the initial Cu(OH)2 sample (not shown), and the pore size distribution of CuO (inset of Fig. 5A) is around 3–10 nm. These mesoporous structures may be the result of the nanosheets' mesopores or the accumulation of numerous nanosheets, and exhibit a high surface area to volume ratio thus favoring lithium-storage.28

(C′)–(E′) The line relationships between Z′ and ω−1/2 in the frequency region of 0.1–0.01 Hz. 
Secondly, unique structures: three or more nanosheets assemble into a cluster and reassemble into the MNCAs, these structures facilitate the Li+ diffusion and remain stable during the discharge–charge process, which was confirmed by the clear CuO MNCAs structure obtained at 1C rate after 50 cycles, in despite of partial aggregation (see the inset of Fig. 3C). Fig. 5B–E show the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of CuO MNCAs at different discharge states of 1.45, 1.01 and 0.15 V. It can be indicated that the two depressed semicircles consisting a high-frequency semicircle (HFS) and a medium-frequency semicircle (MHS) overlap each other and a long low-frequency line (LFL) are relative to the SEI resistance, charge-transfer resistance and the Warburg impedance of the Li+ diffusion in the solid materials, respectively.29 Apparently, the depressed semicircle became gradually larger with the decrease of the potential, which demonstrated that a thicker SEI film was formed on the CuO MNCAs surface. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient (DLi+) was calculated according to the two equations: (7) ZW = RD + RL + σω−1/2(8)where A is the surface area of the electrode (cm2), n is the number of electrons used during the reaction, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration of Li+ (mol cm−3), σ is the Warburg factor, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ZW is the Warburg impedance. From the relationships of Z′ and ω−1/2 in the low-frequency region (0.1–0.01 Hz), linear behavior with similar slopes at the 5th and 50th cycles were observed at 1.45, 1.01, 0.15 V (see Fig. 5C′–E′). The σ and DLi+ were calculated based on eqn (7) and (8), while it was supposed that 0.4, 0.6 and 1 Li+ per molecule were transferred in the process of forming CuII1−xCuIO1−x/2 (x = 0.4), Cu2O and Cu phases, on the basis of the eqn (4)–(6), respectively. The results listed in Table 1 show that DLi+ remained unchanged at the 5th and 50th cycles. DLi+ at the 5th and 50th cycles were 9.95 × 10−11, and 8.97 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 in the process of reaction eqn (6), respectively. It can be concluded that the unique MNCA structure is considerably stable during the discharge–charge process.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel ammonia vapor-phase corrosion approach for the large-scale preparation of CuO MNCAs on a Cu substrate. As integrated anodes for LIBs without any carbon black and polymer binder agents, CuO MNCAs exhibit an excellent cycling performance and a high-rate capability of 548.8 mA h g−1 at 10C rate. The super lithium-storage performance may be the result of the unique MNCA structure, which offers a large surface to volume ratio which favors lithium-storage, and provides a large free space to alleviate the large volume variation during the charge–discharge process. Due to the low electrical conductivity of CuO itself, the lithium-storage capability of CuO is limited, and coated carbon may be a good choice to improve its lithium-storage properties, which would be studied in later work. Recently, we applied the strategy of ammonia corrosion to fabricate nanoporous NiO materials.30 In short, the fabrication strategy is promising for the development of the preparation of other nanoarchitectured materials for both high energy and high power applications.
