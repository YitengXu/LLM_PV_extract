    , Accepted 12th April 2021First published on 21st April 2021AbstractThis study provided the preparation and application of a highly efficient photoanode having dense and efficient sodium titanate (NTO) nanorods decorated with CdS nanoparticles. The (NTO) nanorods were grown densely on the surface of Ti foil by a one-step hydrothermal method, which provides many step edges on the surface of the nanorods and a direct pathway for transfer of photogenerated electrons to the Ti substrate to improve the water splitting ability. The CdS nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of NTO nanorods using a simple and low-cost successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method to greatly enhance the absorption of visible light. Rough surfaces of the as-synthesized nanorods were favorable sites for growing the CdS nanoparticles, which formed a tremendous connection and heterojunction at the interface between NTO and CdS. This efficient connection caused a noticeable enhancement in photocurrent density with great stability in integrated NTO/CdS photoanodes, due to the efficient separation and transfer of charge carriers. The NTO/CdS12 electrode with optimum SILAR cycles showed the highest photocurrent density around 2.37 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE, which was 36 times higher than that of pure NTO (around 0.066 mA cm−2), and interestingly, this electrode retained more than 95% of its initial photocurrent density, even after 6000 seconds.

Environmental significance
The total anthropogenic energy consumption keeps increasing, particularly in modern societies. The great increases in population, and economic and new technology development are responsible for the constantly increasing demand for energy across the world. PEC water splitting is the preferred way of directly producing solar fuel, such as hydrogen, from water using photocatalysis techniques. Renewable energy production, using PEC solar hydrogen production gas with less environmental impact, can solve the air pollution or global warming issues associated with conventional energy production via fossil fuel combustion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates the PEC performance of pure NTO nanorods which were grown densely on the surface of Ti foil by a hydrothermal method without any further treatment. The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was employed to deposit CdS nanoparticles on the surface of NTO nanorods to improve noticeably their PEC performance.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, the rapid growth in human population and industrialization has generated two crucial problems: environmental pollution and energy shortage. Emission of CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels to produce energy has resulted in global warming and climate change issues. Efficient and practical techniques for conversion of large quantities of solar energy into clean energy sources are needed to solve the two crucial issues that we face in the present century.1–6
Solar water splitting and CO2 reduction would be the greenest technology for conversion of water and CO2 into H2 and hydrocarbons, as a renewable energy source and solar chemical fuel, respectively. Hydrogen is the most attractive and cleanest solar chemical fuel that does not emit carbon during its oxidation in a fuel cell.7–10 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using a semiconductor as a photoelectrode is one of the most promising routes for clean production of hydrogen, which can strongly compete with other traditional hydrogen generation methods, like steam reforming of methane.11–16
Among the numerous semiconductors, sodium titanate (NTO) nanostructures have received considerable attention, due to their special physical and chemical properties that include large specific area, good structural stability, high chemical inertness and ion exchange stability.17 Moreover, sodium titanate has an appropriate band edge position for both hydrogen reduction and water oxidation processes, which makes it a suitable candidate for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications. However, due to the intrinsic wide bandgap of sodium titanates, which is around 3.4 eV, they can be photocatalytically active under UV light irradiation.18 The high rate recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes causes the low quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Even though there have been some reports that showed the photoelectrochemical properties of sodium titanate in powder form, some issues for practical applications of NTO, such as aggregation, scattering and separation of the powder from the substrate should be resolved.19,20 Growing sodium titanate directly on the surface of a Ti foil substrate can improve noticeably these problems. Furthermore, direct contacts of sodium titanate nanostructures with metal substrates can facilitate the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers from active nanoparticles to the substrate.21 Thus, the introduction of smart ideas to decrease the resistance of charge transfer can contribute to greatly improving the PEC performance of NTO photoelectrodes.
The light absorption limitation of sodium titanate nanostructures because of their wide band gap energy under solar light irradiation can be solved by depositing narrow band gap materials onto the NTO nanostructures. CdS is an excellent narrow band gap semiconductor that can sensitize sodium titanate to improve its photoresponse to visible light.22–24 In addition, suitable band alignment between sodium titanate and CdS can modulate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers to consequently increase their photoelectrochemical properties.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the PEC performance of pure NTO nanorods with many step edges on their top surface that were grown densely on the surface of Ti foil by a hydrothermal method, without any further treatment. The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was employed to deposit CdS nanoparticles on the surface of NTO nanorods. The number of SILAR deposition cycles on NTO nanorods was optimized by measuring the photocurrent density of the different photoanode samples. This study systematically investigated the PEC improvement behaviors of different NTO/CdSx samples by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Mott–Schottky, open circuit potential (OCP), applied bias photon to current conversion efficiency (ABPE) and incident photon current efficiency (ICPE) analyses.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Catalyst preparation

2.1.1. Fabrication of the NTO nanorod film. 
Ti foil with an appropriate size as a substrate was first immersed in acetone, ethanol and distilled water solution for 15 min under sonication to remove the surface organic contamination. After rinsing with distilled water, Ti foil was placed in a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave that was filled with 20 mL of 0.25 M NaOH aqueous solution, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 20 h. The sample was then rinsed with distilled water and ethanol, and finally dried in an air oven at 60 °C.


2.1.2. Fabrication of NTO/CdSx photoanodes. 
The CdS nanoparticles were deposited on the NTO nanorods by the SILAR technique. The NTO nanorod film was immersed in 0.5 M cadmium nitrate (1:1 methanol–water) solution for 5 min for Cd2+ cations to adhere to the surface of the nanorods. Then, the sample was rinsed with ethanol and distilled water to remove the weakly anchored Cd2+ dots. Afterwards, the film was dipped in 0.5 M sodium sulfide aqueous solution for 5 min to react S2− with Cd2+ cations, followed by rinsing. The above procedure was named one SILAR cycle. We prepared different samples with 3, 7, 9, 12 and 15 cycles, which were named as NTO/CdS3, NTO/CdS7, NTO/CdS9, NTO/CdS12 and NTO/CdS15, respectively. In the last stage, all samples were placed in the furnace for 2 h at 300 °C for calcination.

2.2. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance
Photoelectrochemical measurements of different photoanodes were investigated with a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell. The photoanode was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and the RHE as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was a 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution at pH = 9.
The PEC activity of pure NTO and the NTO/CdSx photoanodes was measured under irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 from the front side of the photoanodes in the scan range from −0.15 to 2 V (vs. RHE).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the synthesized photoanodes

3.1.1. XRD. 
Fig. S1† and 1a show the XRD patterns of the Ti metal substrate, sodium titanate nanorod film (NTO) and NTO nanorod film loaded with Cd and S ions (NTO/CdS12) with 12 SILAR cycles. The presence of additional peaks at the two-theta angle of 9.36°, 10.1°, 24.2°, 28.1°, 29.5°, 48.2° and 49.36° in the XRD patterns of NTO compared to Ti foil confirmed the formation of sodium titanates (which consist of both sodium trititanate and sodium hexatitanate).25,26 In addition, the presence of diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.96, 26.6, 36.7, 43.71 and 47.86° corresponding to the (100), (002), (102), (110) and (103) planes is assigned to the existence of the hexagonal CdS phase in NTO/CdS12.27
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of Ti foil, NTO and NTO/CdS12, (b) Raman spectrum of NTO, and (c) Raman spectrum of NTO/CdS12. 


3.1.2. Raman. 
Raman scattering spectroscopy was performed to clarify the surface phases of the as-synthesized samples of NTO. The Raman spectrum of pristine NTO nanorods revealed six typical peaks at 195, 275, 443, 660, 709 and 905 cm−1 (Fig. 1b). The Raman peaks at 195 cm−1 totally corresponded to Ti–O vibrations of anatase. Two other bands at about 275 and 443 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching of Na–O–Ti and vibrations of Ti–O–Ti, respectively. Two peaks located at 660 and 709 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching of Ti–O–Ti bands in edge-shared TiO6. The Raman band at 905 cm−1 is assigned to the Na–O–Ti band.28–30
The strong Raman peaks located at around 299 and 599 cm−1 of NTO/CdS12 in Fig. 1c can be attributed to the first and second order longitudinal optical (LO) phonon modes of CdS, respectively. Moreover, two weak peaks at 195 and 905 cm−1 correspond to NTO nanorods. Based on the above mentioned peaks, it can be proposed that both NTO nanorods and CdS nanoparticles retained their crystal structures, and coexisted in the NTO/CdS12 heterostructured sample.29,31


3.1.3. XPS. 
XPS was employed to investigate the elemental composition on the surface of NTO and NTO/CdS12. Fig. 2a and b show the XPS survey spectrum of NTO and NTO/CdS12, respectively. Pure NTO shows three main peaks at 458.6, 531.6 and 1071 eV corresponding to Ti 2p and O 1s and Na 1s, respectively.32 Two extra peaks were found in the XPS survey spectrum of NTO/CdS12, as compared to pure NTO, located at binding energies of 161.7 and 405.3 eV, which indicate S 2p and Cd 3d peaks (Fig. 2b).33 The above results confirm the existence of CdS on the surface of NTO nanorods in NTO/CdS12. Fig. 2c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cd 3d with two peaks of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 positioned at binding energies of 405.3 and 412.1 eV, which are assigned to metallic cadmium. The difference of 6.82 eV in their calculated binding energy indicates the existence of cadmium with an oxidation state of Cd2+.34 There is a hump-type peak in the high-resolution XPS spectra of S 2p shown in Fig. 2d, which can be divided into two separate peaks, located at binding energies of 161.7 and 162.9 eV, related to the oxidation states of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.35 Two distinctive peaks centered at binding energies of 458.6 and 464.1 eV in Fig. 2e are attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. A typical peak at 531.6 eV can be observed in Fig. 2f, which is assigned to O 1s related to the lattice oxygen in NTO nanorods.36
 Fig. 2  XPS survey spectra of (a) NTO and (b) NTO/CdS12 and high-resolution XPS spectra of (c) Cd, (d) S, (e) Ti and (f) O. 
The valence band edges of NTO and CdS were calculated by using the valence band XPS results. The valence band edges of pure NTO and CdS were estimated to be 2.85 and 1.6 eV, respectively (Fig. S2†).


3.1.4. Optical absorption of the samples by UV-vis. 

Fig. 3a shows the UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the as-prepared photoanodes. The optical absorption edge of the NTO photoanode is 365 nm, which corresponds to the bandgap energy of 3.4 eV. Deposition of CdS as a semiconductor with a narrow band gap (about 2.3 eV) onto NTO can remarkably improve the absorption of visible light. All photoanode samples demonstrate a red shift of the absorption edge and enhancement of their visible light absorption after the deposition of CdS with different SILAR cycles. The absorption edges of NTO/CdS7, NTO/CdS9, NTO/CdS12 and NTO/CdS15 are 551 nm, 544 nm, 546 nm and 558 nm, respectively, which show an absorption edge in the visible light region, with much larger wavelengths, compared to the pristine NTO photoanode. Increasing the number of SILAR cycles shows an expansion in the absorption of visible light. The highest absorption enhancement of the visible light region was obtained by the NTO/CdS12 photoanode with 12 SILAR cycles.

3.1.5. PL spectroscopy. 
PL spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the recombination process of photogenerated carriers in the heterostructured photoanodes of NTO/CdSx (Fig. 3b). Two narrow emission peaks are observed for NTO at 480 and 530 nm which are attributed to the band edge recombination of electron–hole pairs and deeply trapped emissions through the surface states, respectively.18,26 Deposition of CdS on NTO with different numbers of SILAR cycles caused great reduction in the PL spectral peaks of all the samples compared to pure NTO, which indicates the effective improvement in separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by constructing the heterostructures.


3.1.6. SEM. 

Fig. 4a shows the top view image of pure non-uniform NTO nanorods that were grown densely and vertically or obliquely on the surface of Ti foil. The average diameter of nanorods ranged from 80 to 160 nm and their length reached up to 600 nm. It can be seen that the top surface of the as-synthesized nanorods contains many step edges, which are more favorable sites for adsorption of Cd2+ and S2− ions for the growth of CdS, compared to the side surface that is relatively smooth (Fig. 4a, and S3†). Fig. 4c, e and g show the top view images of NTO/CdS9, NTO/CdS12 and NTO/CdS15. When the number of SILAR deposition cycles increases, a greater amount of CdS nanoparticles covers the surface of NTO nanorods. As shown in Fig. 4c, even after 9 cycles of deposition, some parts of NTO were not fully covered with CdS nanoparticles. Deposition of nanorods with 12 SILAR cycles shows that all the nanorod surfaces are uniformly and almost fully covered with CdS. However, further increasing the number of SILAR cycles to 15 caused the formation of an additional layer of CdS on the surface of NTO nanorods. The elemental composition of NTO/CdS with different SILAR cycles was investigated by EDX to detect the signals of cadmium and sulfide after deposition of CdS on the surface of NTO nanorods. Fig. 4d, f and h clearly show that the increase in the number of SILAR cycles from 9 to 15 leads to the increase in the weight percentage of cadmium and sulfide from 34.3 to 61.06 and 5.77 to 15.27 wt%, respectively.

3.1.7. TEM. 

Fig. 5 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the high-resolution (HR) TEM image, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and elemental mapping of pure NTO and the NTO/CdS12 photoanodes that were scratched off from the Ti foil substrate. Fig. 5a shows the formation of sodium titanate nanorods on the surface of Ti foil via the hydrothermal process, which is consistent with the SEM analysis. It can be seen that after 12 SILAR deposition cycles, the NTO nanorods were coated uniformly with CdS nanoparticles (Fig. 5b). The HRTEM image of the NTO/CdS12 photoelectrode in Fig. 5c shows that the spacing of the lattice fringes of the CdS (110) plane and the sodium titanate (011) plane is 0.23 and 0.34 nm, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in the inset of Fig. 5c indicates the spot and ring patterns corresponding to the single crystal structure of NTO NRs and the polycrystalline structure of CdS nanoparticles, respectively. A round diffraction ring corresponding to the CdS (002) plane can be clearly observed which is consistent with the XRD pattern results. Furthermore, the elemental mapping images in Fig. 5d obviously show that the NTO/CdS12 photoanode only contains Na, Ti, O, Cd and S which corresponding to the main component elements of the NTO and CdS.

3.2. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties

Fig. 6a presents the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of NTO and NTO/CdSx photoelectrodes between −0.15 and ∼2 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution under continuous and chopped illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity. An insignificant amount of photocurrent was observed under dark conditions for all photoelectrodes. Pure NTO has a negligible photocurrent around 0.066 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE. The photocurrent of different NTO/CdSx samples was greatly enhanced by increasing the number of SILAR cycles to 12 cycles. The photocurrent density of NTO/CdS12 was 2.37 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE, which is 36 times higher than that of pure NTO. This outstanding improvement can be attributed to the large absorption of visible light from the incident solar spectrum, due to both the narrow band gap energy of CdS, and the formation of a type II heterojunction between CdS and NTO, which promote the generation and separation of charge carriers, leading to the excellent PEC performance. Further increasing the number of SILAR cycles from 12 to 15 decreased the photocurrent density from 2.37 to 0.77 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE.
 Fig. 6  Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of NTO and NTO/CdSx photoelectrodes under (a) continuous and (b) chopped illumination. 
After 9 and 12 SILAR deposition cycles, CdS nanoparticles only cover the surface of each nanorod individually (Fig. S4†). Further increasing the number of SILAR cycles to 15 caused the formation of an additional layer of CdS on the surface of NTO nanorods (Fig. 4g). Fig. 3a shows that all the NTO/CdSx samples have 2 different absorption edges corresponding to NTO and CdS except for NTO/CdS15 affected by the as-mentioned layer. This thick layer prevents illuminated light from reaching the NTO nanorods which can suppress the formation of the type II heterojunction between NTO and CdS for efficient electron–hole generation and separation in this sample. Consequently, this layer decreases the photocurrent of NTO/CdS15 compared to other photoelectrodes (NTO/CdS7, NTO/CdS9, NTO/CdS12).

Fig. 6a shows the photocurrent density of all photoanode samples as a function of the external bias voltage. The photoelectrodes with heterostructures between the NTO and the CdS nanoparticles having more than 7 SILAR cycles showed greatly improved photocurrent, even at lower external bias voltage (around 0.2 V vs. RHE), which is an interesting achievement in this heterostructured system. From the chopped LSV curves, all the photoelectrodes showed a current of around zero under dark conditions, indicating that the current under light illumination was generated by the interplay of the light and photoanodes (Fig. 6b). Moreover, the quantitative value of the photocurrent was identical to the photocurrent density from LSV.
Chronoamperometric analysis was conducted to investigate the photocurrent response and photocurrent stability of different NTO/CdSx photoanodes at 1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7). The fast response and recovery of photocurrent per light on/off cycle demonstrates that photogenerated electrons are quickly transferred through the composite layers and Ti substrate. The photocurrent density for all the photoanodes follows the order: NTO/CdS12 > NTO/CdS9 > NTO/CdS7 > NTO/CdS15 > NTO/CdS3 > NTO. The highest photocurrent density was obtained by the NTO/CdS12 photoelectrode, which retained more than 95% of its initial photocurrent even after 20 min of light irradiation. Fig. S5† shows the photocurrent stability of the NTO/CdS12 photoanode for 6000 s.
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent response at a potential of 1 V vs. RHE. 
The open circuit potential (OCP) of the NTO and NTO/CdSx electrodes was measured to evaluate the injection direction of photoinduced electrons under light illumination. Fig. 8a reveals that all the electrodes exhibit a negative increase in voltage under light illumination, which means that photoinduced electrons are transferring from semiconductor films into the Ti foil substrate, leading to the generation of anodic photocurrent in chronoamperometry and LSV analysis. The negative enhancement for the voltage and positive photocurrent in different photoelectrochemical analyses confirm that the as-synthesized NTO and NTO/CdSx heterojunction samples act as n-type semiconductors. The photogenerated voltage of NTO/CdS12 is much larger than that of pure NTO. This indicates that the NTO/CdS12 sample shows noticeable photoelectric conversion ability. As compared to pristine NTO for the NTO/CdS12 photoanode, it takes about 60 s longer to come back to the dark equilibrium from illuminated states (around 120 s), suggesting that the heterojunction structure noticeably prolongs the recombination process of the photoinduced charge carriers.
 Fig. 8  (a) Transient OCP and (b) EIS Nyquist plot of NTO and NTO/CdSx photoanodes. 
To investigate the photogenerated charge transport ability of different photoanodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was conducted in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under light illumination. There are two different resistances for the transference of charge carriers during the electrochemical reaction in the PEC cell, including the electrolyte resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance across the photoanode and electrolyte solution (Rct). From the Nyquist plot for different photoanodes shown in Fig. 8b, NTO/CdS12 has the smallest semicircle radius compared to pure NTO and the other NTO samples deposited with CdS with different SILAR cycles. The smaller radius indicates the lower Rct, which can promote the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, and enhance the interfacial charge transfer of holes from the photoanode to the electrolyte. Furthermore, the order of decrease in the semicircle radius of the different photoelectrode samples is consistent with their photoelectrochemical performance results.
Mott–Schottky analysis was also conducted to determine the carrier concentration (ND) and flat band potential (Vfb) in all as-prepared photoanodes to further understand the improvement in the PEC performance of the samples after the deposition of CdS nanoparticles. The carrier concentration and flat band potential can be estimated by the slope and X-intercept of the linear region of the Mott–Schottky curves using the following equations (more details about the Mott–Schottky equation are shown in the ESI†): (1) (2) (3)From eqn (2), the improvement in carrier concentration is obtained by the decrease in the slope of the curve. Fig. 9 shows that after deposition of CdS, the slope of NTO in the linear region decreased significantly by increasing the number of SILAR cycles up to 12 cycles, indicating that the highest donor concentration is achieved with the NTO/CdS12 photoanode. Furthermore, loading of CdS nanoparticles decreased the flat band potential of NTO/CdS7 from 0.38 V to 0.27 V vs. RHE for the NTO/CdS12 sample, which is attributed to the great reduction in the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Table 1 shows the calculated amount of Vfb and ND of all the samples by using the Mott–Schottky equation.

The applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) for PEC activity for different photoanodes was estimated based on the LSV data and following equation:37 (4)where I is the measured photocurrent density at different applied potentials (Vapp), and P is the power density of the incident light. Fig. 10a shows that for all the photoelectrode samples, after the deposition of CdS with different SILAR cycles, the maximum ABPE increased. The photoconversion efficiency of the NTO/CdS12 photoanode is 1.1% at 0.65 V vs. RHE which is 55 times larger than that of pure NTO, which is around 0.02%.
 Fig. 10  (a) Photoconversion efficiency as a function of applied voltage vs. RHE for NTO and NTO/CdSx photoanodes and (b) IPCE spectra of NTO and NTO/CdS12 photoanodes at 1 V vs. RHE. 
Incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE) analysis was also carried out for NTO and NTO/CdS12 photoanodes at a bias voltage of 1 V vs. RHE using 0.5 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution. Pure NTO exhibits only around 1% of IPCE value over the wavelength range of 295 to 375 nm. At larger wavelength, the IPCE value of NTO reaches zero, because of its optical absorption edge. Deposition of CdS shows noticeable improvement in the IPCE value of NTO/CdS12 due to the enhancement in light capturing and formation of the type II heterojunction between NTO and CdS nanoparticles, which lead to better PEC activity for this photoanode. The IPCE value for NTO/CdS12 at 295 nm is around 36%, which is 36 times higher than that of pure NTO. The IPCE of NTO/CdS12 decreases to zero for wavelengths larger than 525 nm, which is consistent with the UV visible DRS results (see Fig. 10b).

Fig. 11a and b show the generated amount of hydrogen and oxygen as a function of the reaction time for pure NTO and the NTO/CdS12 (having optimum SILAR cycles) photoanodes. The total H2 generated after 2 h of irradiation for pure NTO and NTO/CdS12 is 0.07 and 10.7 μmol cm−2, respectively, and the total O2 generated is 0.03 and 5.37 μmol cm−2, respectively. These identified values supply clear evidence of the splitting of water into H2 and O2 gases.

3.3. Mechanism of PEC enhancement

Fig. 12 shows the schematic of the energy band structure for the NTO/CdSx photoanode to show the possible transfer mechanism of charge carriers under light irradiation. The type II heterojunction was formed in the NTO/CdSx system, because of the suitable band edge and intimate contact between CdS nanoparticles and sodium titanate nanorods with multiple step edges. Sodium titanate and CdS are excited by UV and visible light irradiation, respectively, to produce electron–hole pairs. The potential of the conduction band (CB) of CdS nanoparticles in the NTO/CdSx photoanode (of −0.7 V) is slightly higher than the corresponding CB potential of sodium titanate (of −0.55 V), which can cause the photogenerated electrons in CdS to transfer thermodynamically to the CB of sodium titanate nanorods. Also, due to the great contact between NTO nanorods and the Ti substrate, these electrons can easily reach the surface of Ti foil, and finally migrate to the Pt counter, to participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). On the other hand, photogenerated holes in sodium titanate migrate to the VB of CdS nanoparticles to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction with the electrolyte solution.

4. Conclusion
Sodium titanate nanorods with multi-step edges were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method on the surface of Ti foil as the substrate. NTO nanorods with rough surfaces were confirmed as favorable sites for deposition of CdS nanoparticles with suitable band alignment to efficiently extend the absorption edge of NTO into the visible light region. This study systematically investigated the effect of the number of SILAR cycles for deposition of CdS nanoparticles on the PEC performance of NTO/CdSx photoanodes. The NTO photoanode deposited with CdS nanoparticles using 12 SILAR cycles (NTO/CdS12 heterostructure) showed the best PEC performance, compared to pristine NTO and the other NTO/CdSx photoanodes. The photocurrent density of the NTO/CdS12 photoanode was 2.37 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. RHE which was 36 times higher than that of the pure NTO photoanode. Moreover, the IPCE value for NTO/CdS12 at 295 nm was around 36% that is 36 times higher than that of pure NTO. The NTO/CdS12 photoelectrode retained more than 95% of its initial photocurrent, even after 6000 s of light irradiation. The noticeable improvement in the PEC performance of NTO/CdSx photoanodes and their great stability can be attributed to the type II heterojunction between CdS and NTO, which promotes the generation and separation of charge carriers. The great PEC performance and stability are also due to the outstanding connection between CdS nanoparticles and NTO nanorods with multi-stage edges and the Ti substrate that facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons to the surface of the Ti substrate.

Environmental significance
The total anthropogenic energy consumption keeps increasing, particularly in modern societies. The great increases in population, and economic and new technology development are responsible for the constantly increasing demand for energy across the world. PEC water splitting is the preferred way of directly producing solar fuel, such as hydrogen, from water using photocatalysis techniques. Renewable energy production, using PEC solar hydrogen production gas with less environmental impact, can solve the air pollution or global warming issues associated with conventional energy production via fossil fuel combustion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates the PEC performance of pure NTO nanorods which were grown densely on the surface of Ti foil by a hydrothermal method without any further treatment. The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was employed to deposit CdS nanoparticles on the surface of NTO nanorods to improve noticeably their PEC performance.
