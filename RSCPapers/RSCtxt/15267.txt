    , Accepted 23rd May 2023First published on 23rd May 2023AbstractFerrocene derivatives have been recognized as a new hole-transporting layer (HTL), imparting stability, enhanced charge separation, and transport properties at the perovskite/HTL interface. Perovskite solar cells with functionalized ferrocene have attained an efficiency greater than 25% with enhanced stability. However, the fundamental challenge of the excess energy loss of above-bandgap “hot” charge carriers, which occurs through hot carrier cooling, contributes to the Shockley–Queisser limit of perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the ultrafast transfer of hot carriers to electron/hole-capturing materials can further boost the power conversion efficiency to a great extent. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of interfacial interactions and strong binding between the charge carrier donor and the acceptor to carry out hole transfer in the sub-picosecond time scale. We modified the donor, cesium lead bromide (CPB) nanocrystals, with a cationic NK-12 ligand to enhance the coulombic attraction between the NH3+ group of NK-12 and the COO− group of the acceptor, FcS4, a functionalized ferrocene with two ferrocene units. Double reciprocal plot analysis quantified the interaction between modified CPB and FcS4, with the highest reported association constant, Kapp, of 2.5 × 108 M−1. Transient absorption analysis inferred a hot hole transfer within 550 fs with a hole transfer rate, Kht of 1.45 × 1012 s−1. This ultrafast transfer of holes is attributed to the strong coulombic attraction between CPB and FcS4 via NK-12 because, with oleylamine and oleic acid-stabilized CPB, we did not observe such ultrafast transfer. These results show that interfacial interactions between the charge carrier donor and acceptor dictate the hot carrier dynamics of perovskites and can play a significant role in overcoming the Shockley–Queisser limit.
Introduction
The immense light-harvesting ability of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) has accounted for their application in photovoltaic and light-emitting devices.1–4 Low-cost and facile synthetic approaches have encouraged their macroscale development.5 A few notable properties of LHPs include their narrow spectral bandwidth with a size-tunable band gap, high defect tolerance factor, near unity photoluminescence quantum yields, high absorption coefficient, and high charge carrier mobility with a long carrier diffusion length.5–9 Consequently, they have demonstrated a solar power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >25%.10,11 Separating and transporting photon-generated charge carriers in LHPs before recombination can amplify the theoretically defined radiative efficiency limit, or the Shockley–Queisser limit, from 33% to nearly 66%. The way to overcome this limitation is to utilize the charge carriers before they are cooled, which can be achieved by (i) direct charge extraction guided by strong coupling between the charge carrier donor and acceptor12–15 and (ii) carrier multiplication.16,17 Moreover, materials with longer hot carrier cooling times will allow longer lifespans for the utilization of charge carriers.18 In this regard, LHP, in particular cesium lead bromide (CPB), has been shown to possess longer hot carrier cooling time in the range of 200 to 900 fs.14,19
The PCE of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is not merely the outcome of their inherent light harvesting attributes; the role of electron and hole-transporting materials is no less important. Attempts have been made to utilize charge carriers before their cooling by employing 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), as the hole transporting layer (HTL).11,20–23 However, incorporating spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs brings additional instability due to hygroscopic dopants such as Li salts which migrate to the perovskite layer, causing their accelerated degradation.24–26 Additionally, the misalignment of energy levels in spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs generates a potential barrier at the perovskite/HTL interface resulting in losses via electron–hole recombination and impeding device efficiency.25,27–29 As such, the combination of only spiro-OMeTAD and perovskites does not fulfill the requirements for commercial solar cells. Alternatively, different molecules such as poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and poly(3-hexathiophene) (P3HT) have been examined as HTLs to improve the stability of PSCs; however, the device efficiency remained inferior.24,28–30 Consequently, improving the stability without compromising the efficiency of PSCs is a challenge that must be addressed. The low-cost and easily modifiable ferrocene is another emerging compound in device fabrication.31,32 As a redox couple, ferrocene and its derivatives can capture and store electrons/holes.33–36 Ferrocene has also shown enhanced electron transfer and conductivity when functionalized onto semiconducting materials.37–39 Li et al.35 identified the role of ferrocene derivatives in accelerating interfacial electron transfer in PSCs and reported 25% PCE for more than 1500 h under simulated AM1.5 illumination. In another study, Webb et al.40 demonstrated the ferrocene as a co-mediator at the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface to restrict Li+ migration in the perovskite layer and addressed PSC stability. Incorporating the ferrocene unit at the interface improved charge separation and charge transfer yield at the perovskite/HTL interface. It is evident from all such studies that the interfacial interactions of LHPs with electron/hole transporting materials greatly influence the PCE by manipulating hot carrier cooling, exciton decay, and other competitive charge recombination processes.41–48 We have also recently used different ferrocene-based surfactants to develop a strategy for using carboxylic anchoring groups in ferrocene derivatives to efficiently extract photogenerated holes in cesium lead bromide (CPB) nanocrystals.49 Creating a strong coupling regime at the electron and hole donor–acceptor interface has also been shown to overcome recombination losses.50,51
Surface passivating ligands such as oleylamine (OAm), oleic acid (OAc), etc., on LHPs, have inherent insulation properties that further impede the transportation of charge carriers across the interface and may reduce the PCE.52–54 However, they are also known to stabilize the highly dynamic interfacial interactions in LHPs.1,55–57 Systematically designed surface ligands that stabilize perovskites and allow better charge extraction are needed to improve the photocatalytic efficiency and PCE.41,42,55,58 Beyond solar cells, effective charge generation and their directed transportation to the catalytic sites/reactant molecules can allow selective photocatalysis with improved efficiency.36,59,60
This work is focused on fabricating a charge carrier donor (CPB) and acceptor system to achieve hole transfer in the sub-picosecond time scale, <900 fs (approximate cooling time for CPB),14 so as to extract hot carriers before they are cooled. To achieve this, we have designed a ferrocene (Fc)-based surfactant, FcS4, by covalently linking Fc to amino acid residues with acidic side chains. The functionalization of Fc forms the ferrocenyl surfactant, FcS4, in which the Fc end acts as the hydrophobic tail, while the carboxylic acid (–COOH) acts as a hydrophilic headgroup. We also modified the CPB surface with a cationic NK-12 ligand (derived from lysine, K) to achieve strong interaction between the donor–acceptor via coulombic attraction between the NH3+ group of NK-12 and the COO− group of FcS4. We previously reported the hole transfer rate constant of ∼1010 s−1 from CPB to FcS4, where OAm and OAc were the surface ligands.49 The relatively insulating behavior of these ligands and the presence of both repulsive (with OAc) and attractive (with OAm) coulombic interactions with FcS4 (via the carboxylic anchoring group) on the interface can hinder charge transportation from CPB to FcS4. Therefore, to reach the full catalytic potential of CPB, we modified the CPB surface with NK-12 (CPB NK-12), which has two positively charged head groups (NH3+) with a long hydrophobic 12-carbon chain.
Structural characterization revealed a phase change from cubic CPB to tetragonal CsPb2Br5 (CP2B5) upon ligand exchange. However, some fraction of cubic CPB still exists, as observed in powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Surface modification with NK-12 resulted in a 10 times higher association constant (Kapp = 2.5 × 108 M−1) with FcS4 than CPB and FcS4. This enhanced interaction between CPB NK-12 and FcS4 resulted in ultrafast sub-picosecond timescale (550 fs) hot carrier transfer with hole transfer rate, Kht = 1.45 × 1012 s−1. These results illustrate the decisive role of surface ligands in manipulating interfacial interactions between the donor and acceptor. Also, our strategy of enhancing interfacial interactions (between CPB and the hole-transporting material, FcS4) by introducing a positive potential (through NK-12) to boost the interfacial hole transport appears to be a strong approach to improve the PCE of perovskites.
Results and discussion
First, we synthesized OAm/OAc stabilized CPB using the hot injection method reported earlier.7 Post-synthesis, the native OAm/OAc ligands were exchanged for NK-12 ligands by the strategy illustrated in Scheme 1. With vigorous stirring, the NK-12 ligand solution was introduced into the pure toluene dispersion of CPB. The highly dynamic binding of the native surface ligands allowed the NK-12 ligands to replace the OAm/OAc ligands on the surface of CPB.61
 Scheme 1  Schematic showing the post-synthetic ligand exchange process from OAm/OAc to NK-12 on the CPB surface (top). Additionally, interfacial interactions are evolving with the addition of FcS4 to CPB (attraction and repulsion) and CPB NK-12 (only attraction). The bottom panel exclusively shows the exact structure (of FcS4 and NK-12) and the mode of enhanced coulombic attraction via NK-12. 
To examine the ligand exchange effect on CPB's optical response, absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were analyzed (Fig. 1a). CPB exhibited the first excitonic peak at 490 nm and the PL peak at 507 nm. CPB NK-12 featured a broad absorption spectrum with red-shifted excitonic and PL peaks at 515 nm and 516 nm, respectively, resulting from the larger nanostructures. The significantly enhanced background observed in the CPB NK-12 absorption spectrum in the higher wavelength region corresponds to the increased scattering contribution from the larger-size nanostructures.62 The crystalline structures of CPB and CPB NK-12 were characterized using PXRD, as shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction patterns of CPB were indexed to the standard PXRD patterns of cubic CPB with typical peaks at 2θ ∼ 15.1°, 21.4°, 30.4°, 34.1°, 37.5°, 43.6° representing the (100), (110), (200), (210) (211), (220) planes, respectively (PDF#18-0364).63,64 CPB NK-12 diffraction patterns also exhibited peaks at 2θ values 15.2°, 21.5°, 30.7°, and 43.8°, consistent with cubic CPB. However, additional distinct peaks at 2θ ∼ 11.6°, 18.8°, 23.4°, 24.0°, 27.8°, 29.4°, 29.7°, 33.4°, 35.4°, 37.9°, 47.6°, 47.9° referred to the diffraction from the (002), (112), (200), (210), (202), (114), (213), (220), (310), (312), (313), (413) and (420) planes of tetragonal CP2B5, respectively (PDF#25-0211).65,66 Thus, the appearance of diffraction peaks corresponding to both cubic CPB and tetragonal CP2B5 indicates the dual phase of CPB NK-12.

The NK-12 ligand-assisted morphological changes in CPB were further investigated using TEM. The cubic-shaped CPB is uniform and monodispersed (Fig. 1c), whereas the CPB NK-12 was observed to be a larger-sized (∼68 nm) nanostructure (Fig. 1d and e). However, some irregularly shaped composites were also observed in some fractions, consistent with earlier reports where the removal of OAm and OAc and disturbed equilibrium of surface ligands have been highlighted (Fig. S1†). The dissolution or self-assembling of small crystals to form a bigger nanostructure due to the disturbed equilibrium between surface ligands is commonly observed in LHPs.1,65 High-resolution TEM analysis of CPB exhibited interplanar spacings of 5.87 Å and 4.08 Å, indicating the (100) and (110) planes of the cubic phase, respectively. The dual-phase existence of CPB NK-12 was further confirmed by TEM analysis, with lattice spacing values of 5.8 Å (100), 4.1 Å (110), and 2.9 Å (200) for cubic CPB, and 6.0 Å (110), 4.2 Å (200), 2.8 Å (300), and 3.2 Å (213) for tetragonal CP2B5.67–69 The average sizes of CPB and CPB NK-12 calculated using the DLS number-size distribution were found to be ∼9 nm and ∼149 nm, respectively (Fig. S2a†).
Both CPB and CPB NK-12 were probed to ascertain ligand exchange using Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Fig. 2a presents the FTIR spectra of the powder samples. The peaks at 2846 cm−1 and 2914 cm−1 represent the symmetric CH2 and asymmetric CH3 stretching modes of the long hydrocarbon chain (C–Hx) present in both OAm/OAc and NK-12 ligand-capped NCs. However, CPB NK-12 lacks the olefin (CC–H) bending peak at 919 cm−1 from the oleyl group. Moreover, a significant decrease in the intensity of the peaks at 1399 cm−1 and 1527 cm−1 indicating the symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the carboxylate group from the complexed oleate anions, as well as the appearance of a weak peak at 1738 cm−1 due to free oleic acid (–CO stretching), confirm the desorption of the oleic acid ligand from the surface of CPB NK-12. Additionally, the strong absorbance at 1662 cm−1 and 1635 cm−1 in CPB NK-12 corresponds to the –CO stretch from amide70 and NH3+ stretch, respectively, which are also present in pure NK-12 (Fig. S3a†). Further, a decrease in the broad peak in the range 3035–3248 cm−1 (N–H stretching in –NH2) supports the exchange of oleyl amine with NK-12 ligands on CPB NK-12.52,63,71
 Fig. 2  (a) FTIR spectra, (b) 1H NMR spectra of native OAm/OAc capped CPB (blue line), and ligand exchanged NK-12 capped CPB NK-12 (red line). 

1H NMR analysis was used further to confirm ligand exchange. NMR spectra of CPB and CPB NK-12 were obtained in deuterated chloroform, CDCl3 (Fig. 2b). The characteristic resonance peaks of the alkene proton (C–H) at 5.32 ppm and the alkyl proton (C–CH2) at 2 ppm were observed in the CPB 1H spectrum, which indicates OAm/OAc. The absence of these peaks in the CPB NK-12 1H spectrum indicates the desorption of OAm/OAc ligands from the surface.72 The sharp peak at 1.58 ppm corresponds to alkyl chain protons of NK-12, and a small shift ∼0.04 ppm from OAm/OAc peaks (1.62 ppm) further confirms the ligand exchange. However, we have not observed the other NK-12 features in the NMR spectrum because of the lack of solubility of NK-12 in CDCl3 and other non-polar solvents and the instability of CPB NK-12 in polar solvents such as D2O. Nevertheless, we observed some broad (due to binding on the CPB surface and very less dispersibility) NK-12 features in C6D6. The chemical shift at 1.2 ppm corresponds to the long-chain alkyl protons, whereas the broad and less intense feature at 3.6 ppm corresponds to the CH2 protons neighboring NH3+ (Fig. S3b†).
Furthermore, we utilized X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to explore the changes in the ligand environment of CPB before and after treatment with NK-12 (Fig. S11†). Fig. S11a† depicts the overall survey scans of CPB and CPB NK-12. The high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s for CPB and CPB NK-12 (Fig. S11b†) were fitted with two binding energy peaks at 399.74 eV and 401.65 eV, corresponding to –NH2 and –NH3+, respectively.73 The well-defined N 1s peaks in CPB NK-12 suggest an effective ligand exchange between NK-12 and more dynamic native OAm/OAc ligands.
We used the time-resolved PL (TRPL) technique to understand the effect of ligand exchange on different electron–hole recombination channels and determine the PL lifetime of CPB. TRPL spectra of CPB and CPB NK-12 (shown in Fig. S2b†) were obtained using a 375 nm diode laser. The kinetics of PL decay for CPB and CPB NK-12 were investigated at 507 nm and 516 nm, respectively. Table S1† lists the fitting parameters for each triexponential decay function. CPB NK-12 showed (τavg = 19.6 ns) nearly three times longer average PL lifetime than cubic CPB (τavg = 5.84 ns). The unusually long PL lifetime component (τ3) arises from low-lying surface trap states prevalent in lead-rich perovskites (CP2B5) due to relatively higher sensitivity towards dynamic ligand binding.74–76 The tetragonal CP2B5 is shown to have severe structural distortions and potential fluctuations caused by a size mismatch between Cs+ cations and [Pb2Br5−] layers. These potential fluctuations in 2D perovskites easily confine the excitons, resulting in trapped excitons and longer-lived radiative recombination.77 Additionally, NK-12 provides improved surface passivation, which effectively reduces the contribution of the faster non-radiative decay component (τ1) from the surface traps.78,79 We also calculated relative photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) using coumarin-152A as a reference. The PLQY values of CPB and CPB NK-12 were found to be 25% and 24%, respectively (details in ESI, Section S11†). Although PLQY values are comparable for CPB and CPB NK-12, the NK-12 ligand has been shown to enhance passivation of CPB (OAm/OAc capped) in toluene as discussed in our previous report.73
Next, we performed a series of experiments to study the effect of NK-12 on interfacial interactions with our previously designed ferrocene-based surfactant having a COOH anchoring group (FcS4).49 The absorbance spectra of CPB and CPB NK-12 (∼12.9 nM for both NCs) in toluene were recorded with the progressive addition of FcS4 (Fig. S4a and S4d†). As expected, the lack of a significant change in absorption spectra underlined the chemical and structural stability of CPB and CPB NK-12 with the FcS4 system. TEM images captured after the addition of 77.86 nM FcS4 (Fig S5†) further demonstrated the structural integrity of CPB NK-12. Fig. S4b and S4e† depict the evolution of emission spectra acquired with the progressive addition of FcS4 to CPB and CPB NK-12. The initial FcS4 (a few nM) additions resulted in remarkably strong PL quenching for CPB NK-12, whereas no significant change was observed in PL from CPB. Fig. 3a shows the comparative PL quenching of CPB and CPB NK-12 on the addition of 14.74 nM FcS4. The average number of FcS4 molecules adsorbed per nanocrystal was estimated using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model (Section S8 and Fig. S8†). As a control experiment, we acquired the absorption and emission spectra (Fig. S6†) of CPB NK-12 (without FcS4 addition) to monitor their stability throughout the experiment. No significant change in the absorption and PL spectra of CPB NK-12 confirmed that the decrease in the PL of CPB NK-12 is primarily due to the addition of FcS4. Further, based on another control experiment, we could firmly ignore the contribution of the dilution factor in the PL quenching of CPB NK-12, as shown in Fig. S7.†
 Fig. 3  (a) PL quenching of CPB (blue) and CPB NK-12 (red) upon 14.74 nM FcS4 addition depicted with dotted lines in respective colors (λex = 365 nm). (b) Double reciprocal analysis of PL quenching showing a linear fitting and the as calculated apparent association constant Kapp, 2.9 × 107 M−1 for CPB and 2.5 × 108 M−1 for CPB NK-12. Time-resolved PL decay of (c) CPB and (d) CPB NK-12 with the addition of 14.74 nM FcS4 recorded with 375 nm pulse excitation and monitored at their emission maxima 507 nm and 516 nm, respectively. All spectra were acquired with ∼12.9 nM NCs in toluene. 

Scheme 1 shows the interfacial interactions of FcS4 units with CPB and CPB NK-12. It is well accepted that the extent of emission quenching is associated with the strength of interaction of the acceptor molecule with the nanostructure. Therefore, we describe the emission quenching by considering an equilibrium between the ground state complex FcS4 − CPB and the unbound FcS4 molecules (reaction (1)), expressed in terms of the apparent association constant, Kapp (more details in the ESI†). (1)
Using the double reciprocal analysis plot of PL quenching (Fig. 3b), Kapp for FcS4 was estimated to be 2.9 × 107 M−1 with OAm/OAc capped CPB (which is consistent with our previous report) and 2.5 × 108 M−1 with CPB NK-12. The 10-fold increase in the Kapp value suggests a strong interaction between CPB NK-12 and FcS4 due to coulombic attraction resulting from NK-12. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, Kapp values of this order for the perovskite system have not been observed (Table 1), which adds to our rationale behind influencing the charge transfer kinetics in CPB NK-12 using FcS4.

Further, XPS measurements emphasize the role of coulombic interactions between the surface ligands and FcS4 molecule in the improved binding of FcS4 to CPB NK-12 (Fig. S12†). Fig. S12b† displays deconvoluted XPS spectra of N1s, highlighting a small increase in the binding energies of –NH3+ (401.82 eV) and –NH2 (399.91 eV) peaks after FcS4 addition to CPB NK-12. This supports our hypothesis that coulombic attraction between the positively charged NK-12 ligand attached to the NC surface and the FcS4 molecule with the –COOH functional group improved FcS4 binding.
To further establish the excited state interfacial interaction between CPB or CPB NK-12 and FcS4, we examined the PL decay kinetics at different concentrations of FcS4 (Fig. S4c and S4f†), keeping the other experimental parameters constant. Table S1† lists the fitting parameters of a triexponential kinetic expression for each decay curve. In both cases, PL decays rapidly with the subsequent addition of FcS4. This decrease in the average PL lifetime was attributed to charge transfer with increasing FcS4 concentration, as it increases the relative integral contribution (fi) of the interacting state (faster component, τ1). Since charge transfer occurs faster, the rapid emission quenching of the excited state in each case results from a fast hole transfer-dominated process shown in reaction (2). [FcS4 − CPB] + hν → [FcS4 − CPB (h+ − e−)] → [FcS4 (h+) − CPB (e−)](2)
Compared to CPB (Fig. 3c), a larger decrease in the average PL lifetime and increased contribution of the faster component (τ1) of CPB NK-12 (Fig. 3d) were observed with the addition of 14.74 nM FcS4. This supports a stronger interaction between CPB NK-12 and FcS4 compared to CPB, consistent with the obtained Kapp values.
However, the strong PL quenching indicated a significant interaction between the photoinduced electron/holes and FcS4. We employed the ultrafast pump–probe technique to investigate the hole transfer dynamics of CPB before and after NK-12 modification. We studied the effect of enhanced interfacial coulombic interactions at the interface. Keeping the FcS4 concentration constant (49.5 nM), we studied CPB and CPB NK-12 under 400 nm pump illumination. We kept the pump fluence significantly low (∼0.25 × 1014 photons per cm2) to avoid the nonlinear recombination process.80,81Fig. 4(a–d) depicts the photoinduced sharp bleach signals (positioned at their excitonic band absorption), which correspond to characteristic band edge state-filling by photogenerated charge carriers for CPB NK-12 and CPB before and after the addition of FcS4, respectively. In all cases, a positive absorption at higher energy (500 nm) arises from the carrier absorption from the band edge states.82
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption analysis of CPB NK-12 and CPB. (a) and (b) are transient absorption spectra of CPB NK-12 before and after the addition of FcS4 (49.5 nM), respectively, depicting the recovery of the bleach signal with time delay. (c) and (d) are transient absorption spectra of CPB before and after adding FcS4 (49.5 nM), respectively. 
To gain insight into the hole transfer processes, we compared the bleach recovery dynamics for CPB NK-12 (at 516 nm) and CPB (at 507 nm) with and without the addition of FcS4 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the recovery of the bleach signal in the presence of FcS4 is significantly faster than only CPB NK-12, indicating the interference of FcS4 electronic states in the charge carrier decay processes in CPB NK-12 (Fig. 5a). Notably, we can firmly neglect the possibility of electron transfer from CPB NK-12 to FcS4 due to their specific band alignment, corroborating our previous report.49 Therefore, the shortest component of the bleach recovery kinetics, i.e., τ1 = 550 fs, can be assigned to ultrafast hole transfer to the HOMO of the FcS4. In contrast, the other lifetime components describe the different electron–hole recombination and excitonic decay processes occurring in CPB NK-12 (Table S3†).

(a) Comparative bleach recovery kinetics (at 516 nm) of CPB NK-12 without and with the addition of FcS4 and (b) comparative bleach recovery kinetics (at 507 nm) of CPB without and with the addition of FcS4. (c) Bleach amplitude comparison for qualitative analysis of the extent of hole transfer from CPB NK-12 to FcS4. The transient absorption measurements were performed with 400 nm pump illumination. The concentrations of CPB (or CPB NK-12) and FcS4 were kept to be 44.1 nM and 49.5 nM, respectively. (d) Schematic showing the overall hole transfer dynamics in CPB and CPB NK-12 resulting from a weak and strong attraction with FcS4 at the interface. 
We also compared their bleach amplitudes to qualitatively measure the extent of hole extraction (Fig. 5c).82 As expected, a lower bleach amplitude in the presence of FcS4 indicated the extensive hole transfer from CPB NK-12. Further, we performed the transient absorption measurements with CPB keeping all concentrations (of CPB and FcS4) and measurement parameters constant (Fig. 5b). This helped us determine what causes the ultrafast hole transfer (within 550 fs) to FcS4 in CPB NK-12, compared to CPB (τ1 = 73 ps). We attributed this to the enhanced coulombic attraction between CPB NK-12 and FcS4 through NK-12, which is absent in CPB alone. Rather, CPB and FcS4 can only have a weak interaction, resulting from the attractive and repulsive interactions of OAm and OAc on the CPB surface (Fig. 5d). Table S3† contains all measurements' fitted parameters/estimated lifetimes from bleach recovery dynamics. Further, to confirm the occurrence of hole transfer from CPB NK-12, we performed steady-state photolysis and interrogated the FcS4 features in the absorption spectrum (details in ESI, Section S10†).
A significant increase in the absorbance in the 600–700 nm range could be assigned to the FcS4+ based on our earlier studies where FcS4 has been converted to FcS4+ using different oxidants49,83 (Fig. S9a†). Besides, we have not observed any significant feature of FcS4+ in the control experiments, i.e., in the absence of light (Fig. S9b†) and CPB NK-12 (Fig. S9c†), which further reinforces the hole transfer from CPB NK-12 to FcS4.
A previous report from De et al. has shown the ultrafast transfer (∼1012 s−1) of the hot hole to 4-mercaptophenol from CPB.82 Here, we want to highlight that, to the best of our knowledge, we have observed the fastest hole transfer dynamics in perovskite systems (CPB) which can compete with energy losses due to the hot carrier cooling and significantly improve the PCE of LHP for their macroscale development. Table 136,49,59,62,80,84–91 compiles different perovskite-hole capturing complex systems with variable Kapp and Kht values reported in the literature.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate the successful engineering of a strongly coupled charge carrier donor (CPB) and acceptor (FcS4) system to achieve hole transfer in the sub-picosecond time scale and extract hot carriers before they are cooled. We achieved this by designing a ferrocene (Fc)-based surfactant, FcS4, having a carboxylic acid (–COOH) group, and coupling it to the CPB surface via a cationic NK-12 ligand through coulombic attraction between the NH3+ group of NK-12 and the COO− group of FcS4. A 10 times higher association constant (Kapp = 2.5 × 108 M−1) between CPB NK-12 and FcS4 than that of CPB and FcS4 highlights the success of our approach to strengthening favorable interfacial interaction. This strong donor–acceptor attraction between CPB NK-12 and FcS4 resulted in ultrafast sub-picosecond timescale hot carrier transfer within 550 fs with a hole transfer rate, Kht = 1.45 × 1012 s−1.
Overall, with already existing functionalized ferrocene-incorporated perovskite solar cells with an efficiency as high as 25% and enhanced stability, we believe the approach we adopted for separating and transporting photon-generated charge carriers in LHPs before the excess energy loss of above-bandgap “hot” charge carriers via cooling can overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit to amplify the PCE greater than 33%.

 	Fig. 4  Transient absorption analysis of CPB NK-12 and CPB. (a) and (b) are transient absorption spectra of CPB NK-12 before and after the addition of FcS4 (49.5 nM), respectively, depicting the recovery of the bleach signal with time delay. (c) and (d) are transient absorption spectra of CPB before and after adding FcS4 (49.5 nM), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  Hole transfer dynamic studies using the ultrafast pump–probe technique. (a) Comparative bleach recovery kinetics (at 516 nm) of CPB NK-12 without and with the addition of FcS4 and (b) comparative bleach recovery kinetics (at 507 nm) of CPB without and with the addition of FcS4. (c) Bleach amplitude comparison for qualitative analysis of the extent of hole transfer from CPB NK-12 to FcS4. The transient absorption measurements were performed with 400 nm pump illumination. The concentrations of CPB (or CPB NK-12) and FcS4 were kept to be 44.1 nM and 49.5 nM, respectively. (d) Schematic showing the overall hole transfer dynamics in CPB and CPB NK-12 resulting from a weak and strong attraction with FcS4 at the interface.
