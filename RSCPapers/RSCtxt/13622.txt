    , Accepted 13th May 2013First published on 13th May 2013AbstractAiming at collecting a maximum amount of energy with one panchromatic sensitizer, three novel dyes based on zinc porphyrin and diketopyrrolopyrrole units have been synthesized. Suitable dye functionalization resulted in a very broad coverage of the solar spectrum and an efficient photovoltaic energy conversion reaching 7.74% in a DSC device.
Light collection is the primary step to any photochemical process, from natural photosynthesis to solar cells. Dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have proven to be valuable competitors in the field of innovative new photovoltaic devices, because they are cheap and might feature photoconversion efficiencies (PCE) above 12%.1–3 Part of the performances displayed by the device depends on the dye chemisorbed onto the semi-conducting oxide surface. The larger the spectral window covered by the dye, the better the light harvesting efficiency. However, most of these organic sensitizers are plagued with a built-in flaw, namely rather narrow absorption bands entailing incomplete visible light collection. Strategies have been developed to overcome this limitation, e.g., co-sensitization with complementary absorbing dyes, implying however the time consuming design and synthesis of two efficient dyes instead of one, as well as the fine tuning of the sensitization conditions.3,4 We and others reported the feasibility of systems based on energy transfer where the absorption of one red-absorbing dye would be artificially broadened over the whole visible spectrum through the addition of several chromophores collecting and transferring photonic energy to the former.4–6 In this approach, the different chromophores weakly interact in their ground state. Another strategy consists in selecting two sensitizers displaying complementary absorption features, here a zinc porphyrin (ZnP) and a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) fragments, and combining them in a fully conjugated structure.7–10 Diau and co-workers have already demonstrated the potential of ZnP as a sensitizer in DSCs.3,11 On the other hand, DPP displays a classic intense absorption at 500 nm that perfectly matches the lack of absorption of the ZnP. Moreover this kind of dye is very chemically and photochemically resilient with a low synthetic cost.12,13 Yet being well-known in organic solar cells,14 and despite some recent interesting performances,15,16 in DSCs, DPP are still undertested with only ca. ten publications on this topic.15–23
This bichromophoric approach was already investigated by our group, and two ZnP-DPP adducts D1 and D2 were reported (Fig. 1).8 Satisfying PCE was obtained, reaching 5.27% for D1. Aiming at increasing these performances, we improved our design by capping the ZnP-DPP core with electron releasing groups in order to promote electron injection into TiO2's conduction band. The vectorialization of the photo-induced electron transfer is a particularly important parameter to warrant high PCE. However, the grafting of electron donating substituents may entail weakening of the dye cation regeneration driving force. For instance, the presence of the electron rich dianisylamine moiety in D2 results in a severe drop in the corresponding PCE (2.55%) when compared to D1 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Structures of the dyes discussed in this study. 
Herein we report the synthesis and photovoltaic properties in DSCs of two new bichromophoric sensitizers DPZ1 and DPZ2 respectively end-capped with methoxyphenyl (DPZ1) and carbazole (DPZ2) groups. Both substituents are electron donating groups, whose oxidation potential is anodically shifted compared to dianisylamine (dyad D2). Additionally, hydrophobic 2,6-didodecyloxyphenyl substituents were added to allow better protection of the TiO2 surface from the approach of the electrolyte, impeding charge recombination.24 Moreover, they can act as a protecting group to the zinc atom from a presupposed assemblage with I3− responsible for increase of the dark current.24–26 The corresponding DPP-free dye, CPZ, was also prepared to assess the influence of the DPP moiety on the photovoltaic performances.
The syntheses essentially rely on palladium-based cross-coupling reactions between functionalized ZnP and DPP moieties (see the ESI†). Two A2BC meso ethynyl-porphyrins featuring two 2,6-didodecyloxyphenyl and an electron-rich moiety (methoxyphenyl or carbazole) in the meso-positions were prepared. A final Heck alkynyl cross-coupling with the corresponding brominated DPP (in the case of DPZ1 and DPZ2) or 4-bromobenzoic acid (in the case of CPZ) afforded the targets.
The electronic absorption spectra of each dye were recorded in solution (Fig. 2) and on TiO2 (Fig. S1†) with and without chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a commonly used co-adsorbate limiting aggregation. The classical absorption features of the porphyrin moiety around 440 nm (Soret band) and ca. 600 nm (Q bands) were monitored. Interestingly, the Soret band of CPZ is more intense than that of DPZ1–DPZ2, while the Q-bands of the latter are roughly twice as much absorbing than those of CPZ.
 Fig. 2  Electronic absorption spectra of DPZ1, DPZ2 and CPZ recorded in dichloromethane. 
Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations revealed that the lowest energy transition involves a shift of the electron density from the ZnP to the DPP moieties (Fig. S2 and S7†). Besides, the addition of the DPP unit to the ZnP core leads as anticipated to a significant increase in the absorption at 500 nm in the case of DPZ based dyes resulting in more light collection when compared to CPZ. This is blatantly confirmed by the light harvesting efficiency (LHE, Fig. S3†) showing that a large continuous domain of the visible spectrum is covered.
The electrochemical behaviour of all dyes adsorbed on TiO2 was assessed in dichloromethane by cyclic and pulsed voltammetry, using photo-electrodes as working electrodes in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical setup. The porphyrin centred oxidation is the less anodic electrochemical process in all cases (ca. 0.8 V vs. SCE), followed by the removal of one electron from the carbazole (DPZ2 and CPZ) and finally from the DPP core (DPZ1–2). Overall, the recorded potentials are similar regardless of the considered molecule, implying a rather weak ground-state electronic coupling between the different fragments. In particular, the carbazole and the para-methoxyphenyl substituents seem to display a virtually identical electron donating power. This is likely the consequence of the high steric bulk of the N-anchored carbazole moiety, leading to significant twist in the angle α between the latter and the porphyrin cycle. This was confirmed by the computed optimized structure of DPZ2, where α was very close to 90° (see Fig. S6† for the representation). The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the carbazole is therefore unavailable for delocalization on the conjugated ZnP macrocycle. Correspondingly, a slightly smaller α is calculated for the methoxyphenyl substituent on DPZ1 (ca. 70°), enhancing its electron releasing ability and explaining the limited 30 mV cathodic shift of the first oxidation potential compared to DPZ2.
Hence, even if carbazole is indeed a stronger electron donating species than methoxyphenyl, the effect of the former is only marginal compared to the latter. A similar behaviour was recently reported by Segawa and colleagues.27 Another piece of evidence can be found in the frontier orbitals diagram, where the HOMO of DPZ1 contains a small contribution from the methoxyphenyl group, which is totally absent in DPZ2 (Fig. S2†). Overall, the HOMO of all dyes is mostly delocalized over the porphyrin moiety with a small, yet significant, contribution from DPP in the cases of DPZ1–2. Conversely, the LUMO is mostly located on DPP and extended to the anchoring group. This spread implies a possible orbital mixing with the conduction band of TiO2.
Electrochemical and fluorescence properties allowed evaluation of the free Gibbs energy for the various interfacial processes (Table 1). Comfortable driving forces were calculated for both electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band (ΔGinj) and regeneration of the photo-oxidized sensitizer (ΔGreg) by the triiodide/iodide based electrolyte (Table 1). The replacement of dianisylamine with carbazole was therefore pertinent. In fact, all dyes exhibit similar ΔG values for all processes, regardless of the rather important structural differences, in particular at the level of the electron donating group (DPZ1 and DPZ2). Therefore, from the thermodynamic viewpoint no differences should be expected between the dyes (Table 1).

Screen-printed TiO2 electrodes were dipped while still hot in solutions of DPZ1, DPZ2 and CPZ, the corresponding photovoltaic devices were prepared (see the ESI†) and the PCEs were measured (Table 2). All dyes exhibited lower performances in the absence of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent in the dyeing bath (Table S1†). Dye aggregation on the semi-conductor's surface, despite the presence of very encumbering dodecyloxy chains, is likely to entail self-quenching of the excited state resulting in a dramatic decrease in Jsc (from 10% to 40% decrease). Moreover, despite the apparent dark current increase by the CDCA addition (Fig. S4†) the photopotentials are nonetheless increased by 30 mV. This improvement has been previously attributed to a shift of the TiO2 band edges to negative potentials.28,29 Despite similar thermodynamic driving forces for the various interfacial processes, drastically different behaviors were monitored among the series of dyes studied herein: DPZ1 is by far the best performing sensitizer followed by DPZ2 and finally CPZ. Interestingly, the simple replacement of dihexylphenylamine (dyes YD2 or YD2-o-C8 structures shown in Fig. S6†)6 with a carbazole moiety (CPZ) results in significant decrease of the photovoltaic performances. A quick glance at the LHE of a CPZ sensitized photoanode reveals insufficient absorbance between 500 and 650 nm owing to the absence of the DPP chromophore in the latter dye. Filling this gap with the DPP centered absorption leads to an enhanced photocurrent for DPZ1 and DPZ2, as demonstrated by the IPCE which plateaus between 400 and 700 nm (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  Photoaction spectra of solar cells sensitized by DPZ1, DPZ2 and CPZ. 
On the other hand, the LHE of DPZ2 is significantly weaker than DPZ1 (Fig. S3†). Extinction coefficients being extensively in favour of DPZ2, it is logical to assume that a lower amount of DPZ2 is chemisorbed onto TiO2 when compared to DPZ1, probably because of the larger steric hindrance of the carbazole compared to the methoxyphenyl. Consequently, a higher IPCE was recorded with DPZ1 than with DPZ2, both displaying nonetheless photocurrent generation between 400 and 750 nm (Fig. 3). Contrary to D2, whose PCE was limited by the weak regeneration driving force, that of DPZ2 is sufficiently exergonic but it has a lower LHE than DPZ1 owing to its larger footprint on the TiO2 surface thus explaining the lower Jsc measured with the former. Harvesting light over such a wide range with an organic dye is worth highlighting, and puts premium on the advantage to fuse DPP and porphyrin cores into one new panchromatic chromophore. DPZ2 exhibits a red-shifted absorption compared to DPZ1 and slightly higher extinction coefficients; yet, DSCs sensitized with DPZ2 featured half the overall performances compared to DPZ1. In order to shed more light on this paradoxical issue, TD-DFT calculations were further performed on CPZ, DPZ1 and DPZ2 in order to ascertain the nature of the main electronic transitions, and more specifically the intensity of the charge transfer (CT) implied in all transitions (Fig. S7†). First, let us analyze the nature of the electronic transitions occurring between 400 and 800 nm. For DPZ1 and DPZ2, the three most intense bands calculated are roughly identical and correspond respectively to a CT from ZnP to DPP (band I, 626 and 640 nm), then DPP (band II, 524 and 530 nm) and ZnP (band III, 437 and 440 nm) centered transitions (Fig. S8†). Nevertheless, a first discrimination between those two dyes originates in the amplitude of the CT upon photoexcitation. Indeed, an estimated quantity of approximately 0.3–0.4 electron is transferred over 1.40 vs. 1.05 Å (band I) and 3.70 vs. 2.85 Å (band II) towards TiO2 for DPZ1 and DPZ2, respectively. In other words, excitation of DPZ1 leads to a charge transfer over larger distances than DPZ2, likely favoring electron injection for the former compared to the latter. In the same time, CPZ displays an electron shift over the smallest distance among the series presented herein (Fig. S7†). Moreover, ground state dipolar moments of all dyes reveal striking differences. Overall, DPZ1 has a much stronger dipole than the two other sensitizers (μDPZ1 ≈ 2 μDPZ2 and μDPZ2 ≈ 2 μCPZ), and this has two consequences. First, the photo-triggered electron injection is supported by a properly oriented local electrostatic field, induced by the presence of an intense dipole. Second, the dipole moment of the dye may bend upwards towards the conduction band of TiO2 thus increasing the VOC. This is well illustrated by the cells dyed with DPZ1 which exhibits the highest voltage among all dyes. When the electrolyte is formulated with 4-tert-butyl pyridine, this effect is exacerbated resulting in an increased VOC but concomitant photocurrent decrease owing to a lower exergonicity of the injection reaction (Table S1†).
Conclusions
With the association of two complementary dyes ZnP and DPP, we have successfully developed a multi-chromophoric sensitizer featuring both large light collection efficiency over the whole visible spectrum and giving high photovoltaic performances. This approach highlights that panchromatic and highly performing sensitizers can be engineered by combining several dyes in a single molecule.
