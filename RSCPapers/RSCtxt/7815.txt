Also, further improvement in the efficiency could be achieved by forming DCP/UCP/TiO2 double composite layers (η = 8.88%), which is about 21% higher than that of the cell (η = 7.36%) without the phosphor dispersion.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted great attention as one of the potential technologies for renewable electrical power generation.1–3 Solid-state solar cells based on crystalline or amorphous silicon are dominant players in the market. DSSCs suffer from the relatively low light-conversion efficiency compared with the crystalline Si or thin-film CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide). Thus, many researchers have been focused on improving the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs.4–8 In general, DSSCs consist of a dye-loaded photoanode (semiconductor), a redox electrolyte, and a platinized counter electrode. Among those parts, the photoanode properties are critical to determine the efficiency of DSSCs because the performance of the cell depends strongly on the light harvesting capacities of dye molecules adsorbed on the surface of anode materials. The development of anode materials is a critical issue.
Recently, luminescent materials (phosphors) were explored as an alternative strategy for enhancing the light-conversion efficiency of DSSCS.9–14 For example, Ce-doped Y3Al5O12 (YAG:Ce) phosphors effectively convert the high energy photons to the visible light that is suitably absorbed by dye molecules.15 As a result, when Y3Al5O12:Ce particles are used as a scattering layer, the DSSC efficiency was reported to be enhanced about 13.5% mainly due to improved light absorption and scattering. The most commonly used dyes (Ru-based dyes: N3, N749, and N719) have a large optical band gab of about 1.8 eV. As a result, Ru-based dyes have an absorption threshold below ∼700 nm. To achieve the improvement in the efficiency of DSSCs, it is necessary to extend the light utilization of dye molecules into the infrared (IR) region without any loss of the cell performance in the visible region. Up-conversion phosphors (UCP) can successfully convert IR photons to visible light. In 2010, Shan and Demopoulos first demonstrated the effectiveness of lanthanide-doped UCPs for the utilization of IR photons in DSSCs.16 They synthesized the Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped LaF3–TiO2 nanocomposite and proved the potential of the near-IR sunlight harvesting in dye-sensitized solar cell. In 2011, Li et al. introduced the Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped Lu2O3 into the TiO2 film in the DSSC and reported the cell efficiency could be improved about 11.1%.17 To our best knowledge, there was no report using both the down- and up-converting phosphors together as a photoanode.
In this communication, we report a simple way to improve the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the photoanode composed of DCP/UCP-dispersed TiO2 double layers in terms of improving the light harvesting efficiency of DSSCs. Various anode structures as shown in Fig. 1 were constructed and the cell efficiency was evaluated with intention of determining the most effective way in simultaneously using the DCP (Y3Al5O12:Ce3+) and UCP (Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+).

We synthesized submicron-sized Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ and Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ particles by an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis process which is known as a promising tool for the multi-component ceramics like phosphor.18,19 Submicron-sized titania granules were also synthesized by using spray pyrolysis of TiO2 nanoparticles (P25). In the preparation of phosphor/TiO2 composite anodes, the weight percentage of the phosphor was fixed at 10 wt%. Fig. 2 shows SEM images and particle size distribution of the synthesized particles. The prepared granules consisting of nano-sized TiO2 have spherical shape and the average particle size of 403 nm. The synthesized Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ and Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ particles exist as an aggregate. The average particle sizes of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ and Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors were 641 nm and 288 nm, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows the emission spectra of Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ and Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+. The band emission with a peak at 535 nm for Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ under the excitation wavelength of 450 nm is assigned to a typical 5d1 → 4f1 transition of Ce3+ and in good agreement with the absorption range of N719 dye as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ as an efficient light down-converting phosphor can improve the light harvesting of dye molecules. The prepared Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles showed strong green and red emission when excited by a 980 nm laser. The green emission bands at 534 and 564 nm are due to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (534 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (564 nm) of Er3+ ions, respectively.20 The red emission band located at 650–700 nm is due to the transition of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2. The strong green emissions of Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles fall in the absorption band of the N719 dye. Therefore, the IR photons of the incident light can be utilized in the enhancement of DSSCs by using the synthesized up-conversion Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs with different types of photoanodes were obtained under simulated 1.5 AM solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) and shown in Fig. 4(a). Detailed photovoltaic characteristics were summarized in Table 1. The dispersion of DCP or UCP into the TiO2 anode led to the increase in the current density (Jsc), whereas the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was reduced. No significant change in the fill factor (FF) was observed with changing the anode materials. The DCP (YAG:Ce) dispersed anode (type II) exhibited a current density of 14.5 mA cm−2 and an cell efficiency (η) of 8.35%, indicating a 13.5% improvement in efficiency compared with the pure TiO2 anode (type I, η = 7.36%). This improvement in the cell efficiency via the DCP dispersion is similar to the previous reported literature in which the YAG:Ce DCP was used as a back scattering layer.15 For the UCP (Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+) dispersed anode (type III), the cell efficiency was 7.80% corresponding to about 6.0% improved value compared with the cell without a phosphor dispersion. When the anode was prepared a DCP/TiO2–UCP/TiO2 bilayer (type IV), the current density was largely increased, and the light-harvesting efficiency (η = 8.88%) was improved about 20.7% compared with the photoanode type I.

The UV/visible diffuse reflectance of the photoanodes before the dye loading was measured in order to check the light scattering effect and the results were shown in Fig. 4(b). The DCP or UCP-dispersed TiO2 composite films (type II, III, and IV) showed no improved reflectance because the refractive indexes of YAG and Gd2O3 are smaller than that of TiO2. For the YAG:Ce-dispersed anode (type II), the light absorption in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 500 nm is due to the 4f → 5d transition of Ce3+. Fig. 4(c) shows the absorption spectra for the photoanodes after the dye loading, which comprises the effect of porous photoanodes. In the wavelength shorter than 450 nm, the absorbance of the phosphor-dispersed photoanodes was smaller than that of the pure TiO2 layer (type I) because the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of phosphors (DCP or UCP) is negligible. But, in the longer wavelength region than 550 nm, the DCP-dispersed films (type II and type IV) showed a little higher absorbance compared with the film without the phosphor dispersion. This result do not reflect the increase of the dye-loading quantity, but be attributed to the enhanced penetration of long-wavelength light by the phosphor particles having the lower refractive index than titania. From the reflectance data, it was confirmed that the improvement in the light-harvesting efficiency of the photoanodes comprising the phosphor is not due to the enhancement of light scattering or the increment of dye loading.
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the dispersion of DCP or UCP in the nano-sized TiO2 anode results in the increment in the current density, indicating that the light-harvesting capability of dye molecules is improved. Given this, it was clear that the phosphors effectively work as a light converter. That is, the YAG:Ce and Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors convert blue light (400–500 nm) and IR photons in the incident light into the visible light more suitable for the light utilization of dye molecules, respectively. To elucidate the phosphor effect, the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was given in Fig. 4(d). The photoanode with the DCP dispersion (type II) has the highest IPCE values in the wavelength region shorter than 450 nm. According to the excitation spectrum of YAG:Ce shown in the inset of Fig. 4(d), the phosphor has good emission under the excitation of UV (325–375 nm) and blue (400–500 nm) light. Accordingly, the enhancement in the IPCE values of the DCP-dispersed anode (type II) in the short wavelength region (<450 nm) indicates that the YAG:Ce phosphor was working good as a light converter. Interestingly, compared with the pure TiO2 electrode (type I), the UCP-dispersed anode (type III) shows higher IPCE values in a longer (>600 nm) wavelength range. This can be attributed that the UCP dispersion makes it possible for the light of longer wavelength to more deeply penetrate into the porous anode layer.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements at the open-circuit voltage (Voc) under the light illumination (100 mW cm−2) were conducted in order to obtain information about the interfacial characteristics of the photoanodes. The EIS spectra exhibited three typical semicircles in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 4(e)). An equivalent circuit was shown as an inset in Fig. 4(e). Rs is the resistance at the TiO2/FTO interface. R1 is corresponding to the first semicircle in the high frequency region, reflecting the charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/Pt-FTO interface. The large semicircle in the intermediate frequency is related to the resistance (R2) of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion resistance of electrolyte (R3) is observed in the low-frequency region.21,22 There was no significant changes in the R1 and R3 values, whereas the resistance R2 was lowered by the dispersion of phosphors, especially by the YAG:Ce dispersion (type II and IV). The reduction in the R2 value can accelerate the recombination rate. Nevertheless, the photocurrent was increased in the phosphor-dispersed photoanodes. This result indicates that the reduction of the resistance R2 is due to the increase of the photo-excited electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2. N719 dye molecules are hard to be adsorbed on the surface of DCP particles. Thus, the increase in the dye-loading quantity was not achieved by the phosphor dispersion. Otherwise, the DCP or UCP particles can supply additionally the visible light to the dye molecules, which is responsible for the enlargement of electrons injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Given this, the dispersion of YAG:Ce phosphor into the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer is helpful to accelerate the electron transfer in the photoanode. The light-conversion efficiency did not have a linear relation to the R2 values of photoanodes. This result says that a crucial factor is involved in the determination of the cell efficiency in the phosphor/TiO2 composite photoanodes.
The electron lifetime (τ) can be estimated by using the relation τ = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the peak frequency of the intermediate-frequency semicircle in Fig. 4(e). To clearly show the changes in the lifetime of photo-excited electrons, the Bode plots of the EIS data obtained for the prepared four electrodes were shown in Fig. 4(f), in which the peak position (fmax) in the middle frequency region (1–100 Hz) is connected with the charge transfer TiO2/dye/electrolyte. Then the peak position should be shifted to the low frequency as increasing the electron lifetime.23 The resistance (R2) and the electron lifetime calculated from the EIS data are summarized in Table 1. The lowest resistance was observed in the type II (DCP–TiO2), whereas the type III electrode (UCP–TiO2) had the longest electron lifetime. The DCP (YAG:Ce) dispersion was effective to reduce the interfacial resistance, but did not increase the electron lifetime. On the contrary, the UCP (Gd2O3:Er3+,Yb3+) dispersion was helpful for the elongation of the electron lifetime rather than the decrease of the interfacial resistance. As a result, the type IV electrode fabricated by dispersing both UCP and DCP particles showed an large decrease of the resistance as well as increasing the electron lifetime compared with the pure TiO2 electrode. As a result, the highest cell efficiency was achieved at the photoanode consisting of two phosphor/TiO2 composite layers (DCP–TiO2//UCP–TiO2).
In summary, DCP and UCP phosphor particles were dispersed in the TiO2 layer with the intention of improving the light-harvesting efficiency of DSSCs. The improvement in the cell efficiency was due to the increase in the current density, indicating that the improvement in the light harvesting of dye molecules is achieved by the dispersion of phosphor particles in the TiO2 layer. The phosphor dispersion did not improve the light scattering but reduced the resistance related to the electron charge transfer in the photoanode. Also, the UCP dispersion was effective to increase the electron lifetime. Therefore, the dye-sensitized solar cell with the DCP/UCP–TiO2 composite double layers showed a remarkable improvement in the light-conversion efficiency (8.88%) compared with the cell without the phosphor dispersion (7.36%).
