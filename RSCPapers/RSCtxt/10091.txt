    , Accepted 29th April 2002First published on 10th June 2002AbstractThe thermal behavior of Cu2S nanowires has been studied in the presence of N2 and O2. The nanowires are stable in N2 at the highest temperature we have studied (320°C), but they are oxidized by O2 to Cu2O above 260°C and to CuO at even higher temperatures. At the highest temperature we have studied (400°C), the S atoms in the Cu2S nanowires are completely removed by O2, forming CuxO wires mainly with x=2. Although the Cu1,2O wires are polycrystalline and are much thicker than Cu2S nanowires, they are remarkably uniform. This represents a new template method for the synthesis of mesoscopic Cu1,2O wires.
Introduction
Metal and semiconductor nanowires have attracted increasing attention from the scientific community because of their application potentials in fundamental science and technology.1 Some synthetic methods such as the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and templated fabrication have been developed to prepare various nanowires.2–5 We have recently reported on the successful synthesis and characterization of isolated Cu2S nanowire arrays on Cu surfaces at or below room temperature.6–10 Each nanowire is a single crystal of monoclinic Cu2S, in which the c axis is parallel to the long axis of the nanowire. Because Cu2S is known to be a photovoltaic material in a hetero-structure of Cu2S/CdS,11 the single
crystalline nanowire arrays of Cu2S fabricated using our simple method may allow the design of new-generation photovoltaics with novel device structures and high efficiencies.
In order to turn the Cu2S nanowires into applications, such as in the solar cell industry, the Cu2S nanowires have to be thermally stable so that they can work properly under realistic conditions.11–13 As we know, heating Cu2S in air will ultimately produce CuxO beyond a critical temperature. On one hand, this would paralyze the functionality of the original material. On the other hand, one could obtain new semiconductor materials through this conversion while preserving the initial dimensionality. These new semiconductor materials may have interesting and useful properties. For example, thin films of both Cu2O and CuO have already been under scrutiny as potential solar energy materials.14 The work presented here aims to investigate the thermal behavior of the Cu2S nanowires and the conversion of these nanowires to mesoscopic wires
of CuxO (x=1,2) in the presence of oxygen. The preparation of copper oxide films by the oxidation of copper sulfide films in air has been reported,15 and this provides a good background for the extension of the chemistry to the nanowire regime.
As one of the first known p-type semiconductors with a direct band gap of ∼2.0 eV, bulk cuprous oxide (Cu2O) exhibits characteristic optical properties due to exciton absorption and its interaction with various phonon modes.15a,b It also shows photo-conductivity and a photovoltaic effect.16 Although the band gap of Cu2O is not as well matched to the solar spectrum as that of Cu2S, Cu2O can be used to make more stable and durable solar cells than Cu2S. Other advantages of Cu2O over Cu2S include low toxicity, low cost, easy formation of a Schottky barrier with a Cu substrate, etc.17
Regarding cupric oxide (CuO), it may belong to a particular class of compounds known as Mott insulators, where conventional band theory generally fails.18–20 It exhibits anomalous antiferromagnetism.21,22 The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in CuO-based materials has spurred great interest.23,24 The Cu valence and its fluctuation are believed to play a key role in high-temperature superconductivity.25 CuO has also been used in lithium–copper oxide cells, and the relation between the microstructure of CuO and its behavior in the cell cathodes has been systematically investigated.26,27
Experimental
Monoclinic Cu2S nanowires with a diameter of ∼60–80 nm were prepared using the procedure described previously.6,9 In brief, carefully cleaned copper foils (99.98%, Aldrich) were exposed to a gas mixture of oxygen and hydrogen sulfide (2:1) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for 10 h. The copper foils covered with black and fluffy Cu2S nanowires (∼2 mg) were collected, dried in vacuum, and then placed in a glass bottle (500 ml), which was heated in an electrical thermal mantle. The reaction temperature was varied by a Thermolyne Input Controller, with an uncertainty of ±5°C. Oxygen gas (99.5%, Space Gas Ltd., HK) was directed to the reaction container with a flow rate of 3 ml min−1. and at a pressure of 1 atm. For comparison, each sample was subjected to the heat treatment for 6 h. Before any measurements,
the samples after heat treatment for 6 h were allowed to cool down naturally to room temperature. We also varied the reaction time from 3 to 36 h, and the choice of the 6 h reaction time here was a compromise between experimental convenience, preservation of the wire morphology, and the fairly complete conversion of Cu2S to Cu1,2O on the high side of the available temperature range in this experiment.
Thermal measurements were carried out in N2 or in air with a differential scanning calorimeter (Setaram Model DSC92) with a gas flow of 5.0 ml min−1. The heating rate is 5°C min−1 and the cooling rate is 3–4°C min−1. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were recorded on a Jeol 6300 instrument at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV. High resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) measurements were performed with a Jeol 2010 instrument at an operating voltage of 200 kV, and the sample was transferred directly from a copper foil to a carbon film on a copper grid by bringing together the two surfaces and sliding gently in one direction. EPR spectra were obtained on a continuous X-band JES-TE200 spectrometer at room temperature and liquid nitrogen temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a PHI 5600 multitechnique
system using a monochromatized aluminium anode (14 kV, 25 mA). Raman spectra were measured on a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw 1000, Gloucestershire, UK), equipped with a diode laser (782 nm) and a CCD detector. The laser with 0.078 mW power was focused on a 3 μm diameter spot of the sample. The exposure time is 10 s, and 50 scans were accumulated for each spectrum. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted at room temperature.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows DSC curves of Cu2S nanowires in N2 and air atmospheres. In the N2 atmosphere, the Cu2S nanowires exhibit an endothermic peak at 101.5°C on heating, signifying the transition from the monoclinic phase (γ–Cu2S) to the hexagonal phase (β–Cu2S).15c,16 Further heating to 320°C, which is the highest temperature we tried, does not result in an obvious change of the DCS curve. An exothermic peak appears in the cooling process at 75.0°C, which is substantially lower than that in the heating process. This is attributed to the kinetic effect that might have slowed down the transition from a high-entropy phase to a low-entropy phase.
 Fig. 1  DSC curves of the Cu2S nanowires collected by scrapping. The measurement was carried out in N2 atmosphere (solid curves) and air atmosphere (dash curves). The heating (curves a) and cooling (curves b) rate is 5°C min−1. 
Although the Cu2S nanowires are thermally stable in N2, even at high temperatures, they are subject to change in air. The endothermic peak also appears on heating in air. However, the heat flow increases at temperatures above 200°C, indicating exothermic processes. Careful analysis gives the critical temperature for the exothermic process to be 266°C. Clearly, this exothermic process is due to the oxidation of the Cu2S nanowires by O2. This is consistent with the fact that the reaction Cu2S (s)+O2
(g)→Cu1,2O (s)+SO2
(g) is exothermic (ΔH0298 K=−772 kJ mol−1 for CuO and −532 kJ mol−1 for Cu2O).28
It can be concluded that the Cu2S nanowires are stable against oxidation by O2 at temperatures below 266°C, above that temperature oxidation will take place. The exothermic peak, which is at 75.0°C in a N2 atmosphere, is no longer present in an O2 atmosphere. This shows that the Cu2S nanowires have indeed been oxidized.
It is known that the reaction Cu2S (s)+O2
(g)→Cu1,2O (s)+SO2
(g) is exergonic at room temperature and ambient pressure (ΔGø298 K=−473.3 kJ mol−1 for CuO and ΔGø298 K=−360.0 kJ mol−1 for Cu2O).28 In fact, the preparation of copper oxide films by the oxidation of copper sulfide films in air has already been reported.15 However, as indicated in the DSC curves in Fig. 1, the reaction is observable only at temperatures above 260°C. Fig. 2 presents the SEM images obtained
after the Cu2S nanowires were treated in oxygen at different temperatures. Elemental analysis using energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) is also given in the figure. At the heat treatment temperature of 260°C, there is no noticeable change in the Cu2S nanowires (Fig. 2A), which are still relatively thin (80–100 nm in diameter). Indeed, the sulfur content did not change much at this heat treatment temperature, as shown by the EDX spectrum in Fig. 2A′. The morphological changes are significant only when the Cu2S nanowires are heated at and above 300°C. For example, after treatment in oxygen at 300°C, the nanowire surfaces becomes rough and thicker (over 100 nm in diameter), indicating the conversion reaction from Cu2S to Cu2O (Fig. 2B). Simultaneously, the
sulfur content decreases in the product and the oxygen content increases considerably, as shown in the EDX spectrum (Fig. 2B′). The roughness of the surface may be due to the formation of small cuprous oxide particles on the nanowire surfaces. Furthermore, at 300°C, the thickening and roughening take place primarily on the top end of the nanowires (Fig. 2B) while the roots are still relatively thin. This implies that the conversion reaction started from the top ends of the nanowires because of the better accessibility of these to the bulk of the reagent gas O2, whereas the transport of O2 to the root regions of the Cu2S nanowires is limited by diffusion. The fact that the thick top parts and the thin bottom parts of the wires all have a one-to-one correspondence implies that the thickening is not due to merging of the nanowires.

The arrow in (B) indicates broken nanowires. 
A typical high resolution TEM image of the Cu1,2O wires is shown in Fig. 3. This TEM image shows clearly the polycrystalline nature of the Cu1,2O wires. In other words, the copper oxide wires made from the Cu2S nanowires comprise polycrystallites, which consist of many small copper oxide particles aggregated together. This contrasts with the single crystallite structure of the original Cu2S nanowires.6,8,10 Formation of the polycrystalline Cu1,2O wires is understandable in terms of the nature of the gas–solid reaction, in which the O2 gas abstracts S atoms from the Cu2S crystals in the form of gaseous SO2. The polycrystalline structure then allows the reagent O2 gas to diffuse to, and the product SO2 gas to diffuse from, the remaining Cu2S crystals more easily through the already formed Cu1,2O
domains, so that complete conversion of Cu2S to Cu1,2O could be accomplished.
 Fig. 3  High resolution TEM image of a single Cu1,2O wire prepared by treating the Cu2S nanowires with oxygen at 400°C. 
Now the wire conversion process can be conceived. Initially, the nanowires are probably thickened by the oxidation reaction, which transforms the single crystalline Cu2S to polycrystalline Cu1,2O. With the continuous thickening, some nanowires are broken because of the spatial limitation, as can be seen in Fig. 2B
(arrow). The broken pieces may be engulfed by the surviving nanowires in the wire conversion process given a sufficiently high reaction temperature and sufficient reaction time.
As the temperature is increased to 350°C, the nanowire surface becomes smooth again (Fig. 2C). This may be due to the annealing effect at higher temperatures. In addition, the copper oxide nanowires became much more uniform along the nanowire axis although the top ends are still somewhat thicker than the roots. At an even higher temperature, 400°C, the copper oxide nanowires become remarkably uniform both along the nanowire axis and among different nanowires (Fig. 2D). The thickness of the wires is comparable to those in Fig. 2B and C. Note that at these higher temperatures, Cu2S is almost completely changed to Cu1,2O (see Fig. 2C′ and D′). The uniform thickness of the CuxO wires derives from the fact that the uniform Cu2S nanowires (Fig. 2A) were used as templates for the conversion reaction. To summarise, although the chemical transformation of Cu2S nanowires to Cu1,2O nanowires is accompanied by changes in crystallinity and size, the overall morphology of the nanowires is still maintained in the Cu1,2O wires at the temperatures of our experiments. It is expected that faster gas–solid reactions at higher temperatures may destroy the template morphology.
Presented in Fig. 4 are the XRD patterns recorded from the samples that were heated at different temperatures and under 1 atm. The XRD pattern at 260°C (curve A) is the same as that of the as-prepared monoclinic Cu2S nanowires:6,7 no detectable new diffraction peaks appeared after the heat treatment. This is consistent with the conclusion based on the DSC and SEM results that the Cu2S nanowires are stable against decomposition to Cu1,2O in an oxygen atmosphere below 260°C.
 Fig. 4  X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples prepared by treating the Cu2S nanowires with oxygen at different temperatures: (A) 260°C, (B) 300°C, (C) 350°C, and (D) 400°C. The open circles mark the diffraction peaks of the fcc cuprous oxide and the open squares indicate the diffraction peaks of the monoclinic cupric oxide. 
After the Cu2S nanowires are heated in oxygen at 300°C for 6 h, however, the diffraction peak intensities of the Cu2S nanowires decrease significantly and new intense peaks appear in the XRD profile of the sample. The new diffraction peaks are reasonably ascribed to the face-centered cubic Cu2O as indicated by the open circles (see curve B in Fig. 4). This is understandable because the Cu2S nanowires can be oxidized in an oxygen atmosphere at 300°C, as is clearly demonstrated in the high temperature region of the DSC curves in Fig. 1. Note the broadness of the diffraction peaks, which reflect the small sizes of the Cu2O nanocrystals in the wires.
As the heat treatment temperature is increased to 350°C, the diffraction peaks from cubic cuprous oxide (Cu2O) become more pronounced, and at the same time small peaks corresponding to monoclinic cupric oxide (CuO) are also detected, as indicated by the open squares (curve C in Fig. 4). The Cu2S phase is now almost completely removed. When the sample is treated in oxygen at 400°C, the increase in the Cu2O and CuO phases is accompanied by significant narrowing of the diffraction peaks (Curve D in Fig. 4). This indicates that the crystalline Cu1,2O particles produced at higher temperatures grow much larger, according to Scherrer’s equation. At this temperature, all the Cu2S nanowires are completely transformed into copper oxides (Cu2O and CuO). The conclusion is consistent with the
results obtained from the EDX spectra as shown in Fig. 2A′–D′.
Although the CuO phase is produced at high temperatures in the wire conversion process, the volume fraction of CuO is apparently much smaller than that that of Cu2O, even at 400°C (curve D in Fig. 4). At 350°C, the CuO phase is barely detectable (curve C in Fig. 4). Because the monoclinic cupric oxide might be formed from either the further oxidation of Cu2O or the direct oxidation of the monoclinic Cu2S nanowires at higher temperatures, one could control the relative content of Cu2O and CuO by varying the conversion temperature and reaction time. For example, low temperature conversion (e.g., 300°C) and long reaction time could be adopted for the production of pure Cu2O wires, whereas high temperature treatment (e.g., >400°C) is likely to convert the Cu2S
nanowires to pure CuO wires.
EPR and XPS were used to further estimate the concentration changes of Cu+ and Cu2+. EPR is a quite sensitive technique for the detection of a trace amount of paramagnetic species. Cu2+ ions have an electron configuration of d9, and therefore they are paramagnetic over a wide range of temperatures, e.g. from 77 K to 298 K. Fig. 5A–D display the powder EPR spectra recorded at 77 K after the Cu2S nanowires were heated in oxygen at different temperatures. As can be seen from Fig. 5A and B, no resonance signal from paramagnetic ions of Cu2+ is observable in the EPR spectra at temperatures below 350°C. Therefore, at 300°C, Cu2S nanowires can only be oxidized to cuprous oxide (Cu2O) in the oxygen atmosphere. EPR signals appear in the samples obtained at 350°C and
400°C (Fig. 5C and D). The fact that EPR signals are present only at temperatures above 300°C suggests that they are associated with Cu2+ ions in the form of CuO clusters or Cu1–2O nanoparticles.29 It is difficult to determine accurately the principal g-factors because of the broad and overlapping fine structure peaks in the EPR spectra. The anisotropic feature of the EPR spectra indicates that the Cu2+ ions are located in axial or lower symmetry sites.30 The broadness of the resonance peak is attributed to the superposition of two closely-spaced peaks. The two corresponding g-factors are determined to be 2.2065 and 2.0768, respectively.
 Fig. 5  EPR spectra of the samples obtained at different oxidation temperatures: (A) 260°C, (B) 300°C, (C) 350°C, and (D) 400°C. The EPR measurement was carried out at 77 K. Cu 2p XPS spectra of samples treated with oxygen at different temperatures: (A′) 260°C, (B′) 300°C, (C′) 350°C, and (D′) 400°C. 
We notice that the EPR signal intensities decrease at 400°C compared with that at 350°C. This indicates the formation of larger CuO particles or Cu2+-rich Cu1,2O particles as the heat treatment temperature increases. It is known that the spin coupling between neighboring Cu2+ ions in bulk CuO is too strong to yield any EPR signals. This is in accord with our conclusion, inferred from the XRD measurement, that the mean size of the Cu1,2O particles increases with the treatment temperature.
XPS spectra of the nanowires before and after heat treatments were recorded in the core level region of Cu 2p3/2. The Cu 2p lines were chosen because they have a large binding energy shift (∼1 eV) depending on the oxidation states of Cu, and they may show shake-up satellites characteristic of the oxides.15c The XPS spectra at different heat treatment temperatures are given in Fig. 5A′–D′. At low temperatures (260°C and 300°C), only two sharp peaks are observed (Fig. 5A′ and B′), showing the existence of only Cu+. For the samples treated at 350°C and 400°C, the XPS data indicate the production of Cu2+ with the appearance and increase of the shake-up satellite together with a broadening and binding energy increase (by ∼1
eV) of the Cu 2p3/2 peak (Fig. 5C′ and D′). This is in perfect agreement with the XRD and EPR results described above.
Raman spectra were recorded for the Cu1,2O wires obtained after treating the Cu2S nanowires at 400°C for 6 h. To avoid heating and photodegradation, an excitation laser wavelength of 782 nm was used. Trace B in Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectrum of the Cu1,2O wires. For comparison purpose, the Raman spectra of Cu2S nanowires and pure CuO powder are also shown in Fig. 6 as traces C and A, respectively. It can be seen that the Raman spectrum of Cu2S nanowires is completely different from that of pure CuO. The Cu2S nanowires show two Raman peaks at 289 cm−1 and 301 cm−1, whereas the Raman peaks of pure CuO are at 291, 341, and 623 cm−1, consistent with spectra reported in the literature.31,32 Cu2O, on the other hand, shows characteristics Raman peaks at 219,
525, and 625 cm−1, respectively.33–35 For the Cu1,2O wires we prepared, the peaks at 296 cm−1 and part of the peak at 625 cm−1 can be readily attributed to CuO, corresponding to the Ag and Bg modes of CuO, respectively.31,32 The other two peaks of our Cu1,2O wires at 219 and 523 cm−1, and the main portion of the peak at 625 cm−1 are then assigned to Cu2O.33–35 As the 782 nm radiation can only penetrate a thin layer of CuO grains, the Raman signals we obtained are mostly from the surface species. As discussed above, the copper oxide nanowires are polycrystalline and are made of many Cu1,2O nanoparticles, hence the surface or interface atoms are most likely in disordered states. As a result, some of the vibrational
modes (e.g., the 341 cm−1 Bg mode of CuO) are too weak to have an appreciable Raman intensity.32

Conclusions
To conclude, we have studied the thermal behavior of Cu2S nanowires in both nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres. No chemical reactions occur except for the monoclinic-to-hexagonal phase transition in the N2 atmosphere at the highest temperature we have studied (i.e., 400°C). The Cu2S nanowires are stable against oxidation in oxygen atmosphere below 200°C. After the Cu2S nanowires are treated at higher temperatures (>260°C) in the presence of oxygen, cubic cuprous oxides are formed predominantly. At higher temperatures (>350°C), monoclinic cupric oxides also start to appear and they increase with the increasing conversion temperature. Importantly, the wire shapes are maintained during the transformation of single crystalline Cu2S to polycrystalline copper oxides although the diameters are increased. Therefore, it is possible to prepare mesoscopic
copper oxide wires under an oxidative atmosphere using the Cu2S nanowires as both precursors and templates.
