    , Accepted 24th March 2022First published on 25th March 2022AbstractThe side chain configuration has shown significant influence on the intermolecular interaction and aggregation morphology of organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs). In this work, we designed and synthesized two isomeric A–DA′D–A type SMAs with thienyl outer side chains attaching a 2-ethylhexyl substituent at the α- or β-position (named o-TEH and m-TEH respectively) for investigating the effect of thienyl conjugated outer side chains and the alkyl substitution position of thienyl outer side chains on the properties of SMAs. Compared to o-TEH with α-substitution, β-substituted m-TEH shows closer π–π stacking, stronger intermolecular interaction and higher electron mobility. In addition, the blend films of m-TEH with the PBQ6 polymer donor possess more suitable phase separation, enhanced molecular packing, higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities, longer charge carrier lifetime and less charge carrier recombination than PBQ6:o-TEH based blend films. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PBQ6:m-TEH achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.51%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (16.22%) of PBQ6:o-TEH based OSCs. Up to now, 18.51% is one of the highest PCEs reported for binary OSCs, indicating that m-TEH with 2-ethylhexyl β-substituted thienyl outer side chains is an excellent high-performance SMA for OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in recent years, due to their advantages of simple device structure, light weight and flexibility. The design and synthesis of high performance organic donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials are the key issues for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. The side chain configuration influences the intermolecular interaction and aggregation morphology of organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs). In this work, we designed and synthesized two isomeric A–DA′D–A type SMAs with thienyl outer side chains attaching a 2-ethylhexyl substituent at the α- or β-position (named o-TEH and m-TEH, respectively) for investigating the effect of thienyl conjugated outer side chains and the alkyl substitution position of thienyl outer side chains on the properties of SMAs. Compared to o-TEH with α-substitution, β-substituted m-TEH shows closer π–π stacking, stronger intermolecular interaction and higher electron mobility. OSCs with m-TEH as the acceptor and PBQ6 as the polymer donor achieved a PCE of 18.51%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (16.22%) of PBQ6:o-TEH based OSCs. Up to now, 18.51% is one of the highest PCEs reported for binary OSCs, indicating that m-TEH with 2-ethylhexyl β-substituted thienyl outer side chains is an excellent high-performance SMA for OSCs.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in the past two decades due to their unique features such as low-cost solution processing, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1–8 Also, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has increased rapidly in recent years, benefitting from the development of low bandgap small molecule acceptors (SMAs) and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors.9–19 In particular, the emergence of A–DA′D–A type SMAs, such as Y6 and its derivatives,20–24 plays a very important role in promoting the rapid increase of the PCE of OSCs from about 14% in 2018 to over 18% recently.
Among the various chemical modification strategies employed for SMAs for improving their photovoltaic performance, side chain engineering on their central fused ring unit is a facile and versatile strategy.22,25–29 It is well known that the length, branching position, orientation and position of alkyl side chains can have a significant influence on the solubility, aggregation, and optical and electronic properties of SMAs, thus affecting the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.30,31 For instance, for the A–D–A type SMA ITIC, in 2016, Yang et al. developed an isomer of ITIC, m-ITIC, by moving the alkyl substituent on its phenyl side chains from the para to meta-position, which showed larger crystalline coherence and increased the electron mobility in comparison with ITIC. And the OSCs with J61 as the donor demonstrated a higher PCE of 11.77% for the device with m-ITIC as the acceptor than that (10.57%) of the device with ITIC as the acceptor.32 For A–DA′D–A type SMAs, there are two pairs of side chains on the DA′D fused ring: the inner pair side chains on the pyrrole units and the outer pair side chains on the terminal thiophene units of the central fused ring. In 2019, Yan and Zou et al. changed the branching position and the length of the alkyl inner side chains from 2-ethylhexyl (Y6) to 3-ethylheptyl (N3). As a result, N3 exhibits better electronic and morphological properties and achieved an improved PCE of 15.98%.25 Compared with the inner pair side chains, the outer pair side chains play a more important role in fine tuning the crystallinity and molecular aggregation behavior of A–DA′D–A type SMAs and the morphology of the blend active layer of the SMA and polymer donor. In 2020, Yuan et al. reported a series of A–DA′D–A type SMAs without (Y3) or with (Y11 and Y18) different alkyl outer side chains. They found that introducing alkyl side chains can obviously reduce the energetic disorder and improve the charge carrier mobility by limiting the rotation of the end-group unit.33 Recently, Sun et al. designed and synthesized a highly efficient A–DA′D–A SMA, named L8-BO, by using 2-butyloctyl branched alkyl as outer side chains, which possesses better structural order and an optimized multi-length-scale morphology.24 Yan et al. adopted phenyl side chains with a hexyl substituent instead of the n-undecyl outer side chains of Y6. Because of the unique “tilted” orientation, m-BTP-PhC6 with hexyl substitution at the meta-position of the phenyl outer side chains exhibited more ordered intermolecular packing, resulting in enhanced electron mobility. When blended with polymer donor PTQ10, the PCE of the m-BTP-PhC6-based devices reached 17.7%.23 Therefore, it is of great importance to systematically study the effect of alkyl chain orientations or substitution positions on its photovoltaic performance.
Notably, side chain engineering of the conjugated polymer donor by attaching conjugated side chains was developed by our group 15 years ago for broadening the absorption and increasing the charge carrier mobility of photovoltaic materials,34 and then the conjugated side chain (especially the thienyl side chain) strategy has been widely utilized in the design of conjugated polymer donors.1,35 Inspired by the successful optimization of the photovoltaic performance of SMAs by the alkyl side chain engineering mentioned above and based on our long-term studies on thienyl conjugated side chains, in this work, we designed and synthesized two isomeric A–DA′D–A SMAs by introducing thienyl conjugated outer side chains with a 2-ethylhexyl substituent at its α- or β-position, named o-TEH and m-TEH, respectively (see the molecular structures in Fig. 1a). We found that the substitution position on the thienyl outer side chains influences the molecular geometry, molecular aggregation and photovoltaic performance of the SMAs significantly. By using the wide-bandgap quinoxaline-based copolymer PBQ618 as the donor, m-TEH-based binary OSCs demonstrated an impressive PCE of 18.51%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.880 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.61 mA cm−2 and an excellent fill factor (FF) of 79.03%, while o-TEH-based devices showed a moderate PCE of 16.22%. As far as we know, the PCE of 18.51% for the m-TEH-based device is one of the highest efficiencies of binary OSCs up to now, which indicates that m-TEH is a high performance SMA.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the molecular structures of the PBQ6 polymer donor and the two new isomeric SMAs m-TEH and o-TEH, and the detailed synthetic routes of the two SMAs are depicted in Scheme S1 and Scheme S2 in the ESI.† The chemical structures of the intermediates and final products with regioisomerism were characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR techniques, and the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra are shown in Fig. S1–S16 in the ESI.† The number average molecular weight (Mn) of PBQ6 was measured to be 28.7 kDa with an appropriate polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.44 by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), as shown in Fig. S17 in the ESI.† Both m-TEH and o-TEH exhibit good solubility in common processing solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene.

Fig. 1b shows the normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PBQ6, m-TEH and o-TEH in thin films, and their solution absorption spectra are shown in Fig. S18 in the ESI.† The corresponding data of their optical properties are summarized in Table 1. m-TEH and o-TEH solutions show similar absorption profiles ranging from 300 to 800 nm with their maximum absorption peaks at 731 and 729 nm, respectively. However, in the film state, the maximum absorption peaks of m-TEH and o-TEH red-shifted to 809 and 808 nm, respectively. These large bathochromic shifts in the thin films indicate some aggregations of the molecular backbone and π–π interactions in the solid state. Considering the little difference between the optical bandgap (Eoptg) of m-TEH and o-TEH, it can be concluded that the alkyl-substituted position on the thienyl outer side chains does not have significant impact on the electronic structure of the resulting SMAs. In addition, since the absorption of PBQ6 films is mainly located in the range from 300 to 700 nm, the complementary absorption of PBQ6 and the two new SMAs could potentially provide wide and efficient absorption to obtain higher Jsc in the SMA-based OSCs with PBQ6 as the donor.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PBQ6 and the two SMAs were estimated via electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and the Fc/Fc+ couple as the internal reference. Fig. S19 in the ESI† displays the cyclic voltammograms of the three molecule films on the glassy carbon electrode. The EHOMO/ELUMO values were calculated according to the equations of EHOMO/ELUMO = −e (φox/φred + 4.8 − φFc/Fc+) (eV), where φox/φred is the onset oxidation/reduction potential of the molecules, and the redox potential of φFc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl in our measurement system. Then the measured EHOMO/ELUMO values of PBQ6, m-TEH and o-TEH are −5.63/−3.19 eV, −5.71/−3.92 eV, and −5.70/−3.90 eV, respectively (see Table 1 and Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, the geometric and electronic properties of m-TEH and o-TEH were simulated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In order to simplify the calculation, the inner alkyl substituents on the pyrrole rings of the two SMAs were replaced by methyl groups. The simulated and optimized molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S20 in the ESI.† Regarding the electron distribution, the HOMO surface of the SMAs is delocalized in the electron-deficient core with rigid aromatic systems, while the LUMO surface of the SMAs is mainly localized in the electron-withdrawing end groups. As for the differences between the HOMO and LUMO of the two SMAs, the theoretical calculation results are in line with the experimental results of electrochemical cyclic voltammetry.
To assess the photovoltaic performance of m-TEH and o-TEH, a series of OSCs were fabricated with PBQ6 as the donor and with a conventional device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PBQ6:SMA/aliphatic amine-functionalized perylene-diimide (PDINN)/Ag (see Fig. 1d), where PDINN was used to facilitate the electron extraction by alleviating the interfacial energy barriers.36 To optimize the photovoltaic performance of the two SMAs, various device fabrication conditions were carefully screened, including the weight ratio of the donor and acceptor, the amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN) additives and the thermal annealing temperature, and the experimental results are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† After careful optimizations, the optimal device fabrication conditions are: the D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2, the solution concentration of 18 mg mL−1 in chloroform with 0.4% 1-CN as the additive, and thermal annealing at 90 °C for 5 min. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized OSCs are depicted in Fig. 2a and the detailed photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 2 for a clear comparison. The optimal OSC based on PBQ6:o-TEH shows a PCE of 16.22%, with a Voc of 0.882 V, a Jsc of 26.10 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.47%. Impressively, the PBQ6:m-TEH based devices demonstrated a champion PCE of 18.51%, with a Voc of 0.880 V and a higher Jsc of 26.61 mA cm−2 and an excellent FF of 79.03%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported among the binary OSCs so far. The improved FF is the main reason for the higher PCE of the PBQ6:m-TEH based devices, which will be discussed later in the following.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices based on m-TEH and o-TEH as acceptors are displayed in Fig. 2b. From the EQE spectra, it can be observed that both devices exhibit strong photo-response in the wavelength range of 430–800 nm, and the maximum EQE value of the OSC based on PBQ6:m-TEH exceeds 87%, which shows a slightly higher response than the OSC based on PBQ6:o-TEH. As a result, the Jsc value of the PBQ6:m-TEH-based device integrated from the EQE spectrum is slightly higher than the calculated Jsc of the PBQ6:o-TEH-based device (25.92 vs. 25.43 mA cm−2), which is in line with the trend of J–V characteristics.
The charge carrier mobilities in the films of PBQ6, m-TEH, o-TEH, PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH blends were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S21, ESI†). The detailed hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) data are summarized in Table 1 and Table S2 in the ESI.† As expected, the μe of m-TEH (6.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of o-TEH (5.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As for the blend films, the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film possesses higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities (6.77 × 10−4/7.02 × 10−4) with a ratio of 0.96 than that (6.04 × 10−4/6.88 × 10−4) of the PBQ6:o-TEH blend film with a ratio of 0.88, which could facilitate the charge transport and lead to a higher FF in the OSCs based on PBQ6:m-TEH.
Furthermore, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) and the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight) were measured for investigating the effect of 2-ethylhexyl substitution positions of the SMAs on the exciton dissociation and charge recombination in the blend films of PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH. Fig. 2c shows the dependence of Jph on Veff, Where Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD and JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively; Veff is defined as V0–V and V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage. When Veff is higher than 2 V, the Jph reaches saturation (Jsat), indicating the almost full exciton dissociation and collection of photocurrent carriers by the electrodes without recombination. Thus, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) of the devices based on the two SMAs could be estimated by the values of Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions and maximum power output conditions, respectively. The Pdiss and Pcoll values of the PBQ6:m-TEH-based devices were calculated to be 95.6% and 84.5%, which are higher than those of the PBQ6:o-TEH-based devices (95.4% and 81.3%). These results indicate that PBQ6:m-TEH-based OSCs have more efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection compared to PBQ6:o-TEH-based OSCs, which contributes to higher Jsc and FF. Fig. 2d shows the plots of log Jscversus log Plight, which provides further insight into the charge carrier recombination mechanism.37–40 Generally speaking, the dependence of Jsc on Plight follows the relationship Jsc∝Plightα, where α is the power law exponent. The α value closer to 1 means less bimolecular recombination of the charge carriers in the material. As shown in Fig. 2d, the α values determined from the slope of log Jscvs. logPlight are 0.978 and 0.992 for the o-TEH and m-TEH-based devices, respectively. The α value of 0.992 (close to 1) for the m-TEH-based device indicate that there is less bimolecular recombination in the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film. Meanwhile, we measured the transient photocurrent (TPC) of the OSCs based on PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH to study their charge extraction behavior, as shown in Fig. S22 in the ESI.† The m-TEH-based device shows faster turn-off dynamics than the o-TEH-based device, implying that the charge extraction is very rapid and less charge is trapped in the m-TEH-based device. Based on the above analysis, it has been observed that the m-TEH-based device possesses more efficient exciton dissociation, less charge carrier recombination, and higher charge carrier mobility, which guarantees more efficient charge transport and collection, and is beneficial for obtaining higher FF, Jsc and PCE in the OSCs.
In order to investigate the charge carrier recombination and charge transport behavior of the devices based on m-TEH and o-TEH under working conditions and illumination, we measured the carrier mobilities and lifetime by photon-induced charge-carrier extraction with linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) and the transient photovoltage (TPV), respectively. In fact, photo-CELIV could more accurately reveal the information inside the working OSCs than the single-carrier measurements. The increment speed of the current under illumination is determined by the whole conductivity of the film, and the time to reach the maximum extraction current could be used to estimate the drift mobility of the photogenerated charge carriers. The transient signals of photo-CELIV in the m-TEH and o-TEH-based devices are depicted in Fig. 2e, and the carrier extraction mobilities derived from the photo-CELIV results were 2.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the devices based on PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH, respectively. Fig. 2f illustrates the carrier lifetime curves under different light intensities obtained from TPV measurements, and the charge carrier lifetime in the m-TEH-based device is longer than that of the o-TEH-based device under different light intensities due to their less charge carrier recombination and more efficient exciton dissociation. Under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2, the carrier lifetime of the m-TEH-based device was estimated to be 1.101 μs, but the value of the o-TEH-based device is only 0.504 μs under the same light illumination conditions. The longer carrier lifetime, the higher photo carrier mobility and the lower trap density mentioned above should result in a reduced charge carrier recombination rate and a higher Jsc and FF of the m-TEH-based device.41–44
To further understand why the 2-ethylhexyl substitution position can affect the FF values of the SMA-based OSCs, the thin-film morphology of the pristine SMAs and the blended films of the SMAs with the PBQ6 polymer donor were investigated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).45,46 As displayed in the two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns in Fig. 3a and b, the (010) diffraction peaks of the m-TEH and o-TEH films in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction were located at 1.667 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.768 Å) and 1.660 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.784 Å) respectively, and the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of m-TEH and o-TEH films were 17.459 Å and 16.068 Å, respectively. The closer π–π stacking and longer CCL in the OOP direction of the m-TEH film indicate that the alkyl β-substitution on the thienyl outer side chains can lead to stronger and more ordered intermolecular packing. On the other hand, from the in-plane (IP) direction, there were two lamellar stacking peaks at 0.281/0.392 Å−1 (d-spacing: 22.390/16.018 Å) for m-TEH and 0.287/0.396 Å−1 (d-spacing: 21.875/15.859 Å) for o-TEH. By comparing with the GIWAXS results of Y6,20 we can think that these two lamellar stacking peaks correspond to two different stacking patterns along the crystal axes in the two-dimensional network in the IP direction, which is different from the linear ITIC-like SMAs.24,47–49 At the same time, we also calculated the molecular geometry of the SMAs using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, as shown in Fig. 3d. Based on the simulations, the dihedral angles between the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties in the central fused ring and the thiophene ring of the thienyl conjugated side chain or the electron-withdrawing end groups were calculated to be 48.92° and 10.10° respectively in m-TEH, which are smaller than the angles of 49.04° and 10.81° in o-TEH due to the less steric hindrance existing between the side chains in m-TEH. The simulation results are consistent with the closer π–π stacking of m-TEH with face-on orientation from the GIWAXS measurements. The difference between OOP (100) and IP (010) diffraction peaks of the two acceptors is discussed in the ESI† (p. S14). In summary, m-TEH shows not only a shorter π–π stacking distance (dπ–π) but also a larger CCL, so m-TEH exhibits overall stronger and more ordered intermolecular packing than o-TEH, which could facilitate the charge transport and lead to a higher FF in the OSCs.

Moreover, the microstructure and molecular orientation of the blend film profoundly affect exciton dissociation and charge transport, thus, GIWAXS was also used to investigate the morphological features of the PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH blend films, as shown in Fig. 4. It is worth noting that blending the SMAs with PBQ6 does not change the predominant face-on orientation for both donor and acceptor components. As mentioned above, the neat SMA films have two diffraction peaks in the in-plane direction (100), while there is only one obvious diffraction peak in the PBQ6:o-TEH blend film, indicating that PBQ6 may disrupt the aggregation of o-TEH, which leads to less phase separation and negatively impacts the charge transfer. As tabulated in Table S3 in the ESI,† the CCLs of the π–π stacking are estimated by Scherrer equation to be 18.832 Å and 17.666 Å for the PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH blend films, respectively, which indicates higher conjugation of the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film which is in accordance with the information of the neat m-TEH film in the OOP direction. These results indicate that the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film has better nano-scale aggregation and π–π stacking vertical to the substrate, which is beneficial for the charge transport for improving the photovoltaic performance.

Apart from molecular packing, we also characterized the nanoscale phase separation of the blend films by employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S23 in the ESI.† It can be seen from the AFM images that the PBQ6:o-TEH blend film shows a larger root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.48 nm in comparison with that (1.43 nm) of the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film. The too large aggregation of the PBQ6:o-TEH blend film is unfavorable for the charge transport and likely to cause recombination of charge carriers. However, a suitable phase separation of the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film provides more donor–acceptor interface for efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport, which may cause higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination and longer charge carrier lifetime. Combined with the results of GIWAXS, it could be concluded that m-TEH has more suitable self-assembly characteristics in the blend film and could form a nano-scale interpenetrating network with the PBQ6 donor, which is beneficial to yield better Jsc and higher FF in the related OSCs.

To understand the charge transfer (CT) and recombination process of the active layer, we performed broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TA) to study the excited state dynamics of PBQ6:m-TEH and PBQ6:o-TEH blend films. We investigated the hole transfer behavior of PBQ6:m-TEH by selectively photoexciting the acceptor m-TEH at 840 nm wavelength. Fig. 6a shows the transient absorption spectra of the PBQ6:m-TEH blend film. Immediately after excitation, the spectrum is predominated by the excited state of m-TEH, which consists of a ground state bleach (GSB) with peaks at 645 nm, 750 nm and 840 nm, and a broad excited state absorption (ESA) from 900 nm extended to 1600 nm with peaks at 920 nm and 1550 nm, as shown in Fig. 6b. The m-TEH excited state exhibits a fast decay at early times as the intensity of these spectral features decreased rapidly in the first 10 ps. At a later time, the transient absorption spectrum is mainly composed of the long-lived CT state with an ESA peak at 1000 nm, and two GSB peaks at 660 nm and 840 nm which correspond to PBQ6 and m-TEH GSBs, respectively. This species decay slowly over the next several nanoseconds, suggesting the recombination from the CT state to the ground state. The transient absorption spectra of PBQ6:o-TEH (see Fig. 6c) was also recorded under the same conditions and a similar spectral profile was observed. However, the kinetic traces were found to be different at 1000 nm ESA peak of the CT states in both blends. As depicted in Fig. 6d, the CT state of PBQ6:o-TEH has a shorter lifetime than that of PBQ6:m-TEH, suggesting a stronger charge recombination in the PBQ6:o-TEH blends. Notably, this result is consistent with our AFM and TEM results that PBQ6:o-TEH formed too large aggregates, which is unfavorable to its device performance. On the other hand, the relatively long-lived CT state in PBQ6:m-TEH provides sufficient time for charge transport and collection that guarantee photocurrent generation in the devices, leading to a higher Jsc and FF for the PBQ6:m-TEH based devices.

Conclusions
In summary, two isometric A–DA′D–A type SMAs named m-TEH and o-TEH were rationally designed and synthesized by attaching a 2-ethylhexyl substituent at the α- or β-position of its thienyl conjugated outer side chains, and the effect of the 2-ethylhexyl substitution position on their optoelectronic and molecular aggregation properties was investigated. Compared to o-TEH with the substitution at the α-position, m-TEH with the substitution at the β-position shows closer π–π stacking, stronger intermolecular interaction and higher electron mobility. In addition, the OSCs based on m-TEH with PBQ6 as the donor possess more suitable phase separation and enhanced molecular packing, higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities, longer charge carrier lifetime and less charge carrier recombination than the o-TEH-based devices, which is beneficial for achieving higher Jsc and higher FF of the devices. Eventually, the PBQ6:m-TEH based OSC achieved a PCE of 18.51% with a Voc of 0.880 V and a higher Jsc of 26.61 mA cm−2 and an excellent FF of 79.03%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported among the binary OSCs so far. All the results reveal that the side chain configuration shows significant influence on the intermolecular interaction and aggregation morphology of the SMAs and the side chain engineering plays a crucial role in tuning the intermolecular aggregation and improving the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention in recent years, due to their advantages of simple device structure, light weight and flexibility. The design and synthesis of high performance organic donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials are the key issues for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. The side chain configuration influences the intermolecular interaction and aggregation morphology of organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs). In this work, we designed and synthesized two isomeric A–DA′D–A type SMAs with thienyl outer side chains attaching a 2-ethylhexyl substituent at the α- or β-position (named o-TEH and m-TEH, respectively) for investigating the effect of thienyl conjugated outer side chains and the alkyl substitution position of thienyl outer side chains on the properties of SMAs. Compared to o-TEH with α-substitution, β-substituted m-TEH shows closer π–π stacking, stronger intermolecular interaction and higher electron mobility. OSCs with m-TEH as the acceptor and PBQ6 as the polymer donor achieved a PCE of 18.51%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (16.22%) of PBQ6:o-TEH based OSCs. Up to now, 18.51% is one of the highest PCEs reported for binary OSCs, indicating that m-TEH with 2-ethylhexyl β-substituted thienyl outer side chains is an excellent high-performance SMA for OSCs.
