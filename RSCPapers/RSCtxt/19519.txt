    , Accepted 25th February 2013First published on 25th February 2013AbstractA naturally abundant nickel-borate (Ni–Bi) complex is demonstrated to successfully catalyze the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation of BiVO4 electrodes at 1.23 VRHE with nearly 100% faradaic efficiency for oxygen evolution. Ni–Bi is electrodeposited (ED) and photodeposited (PD) for varying times on BiVO4 electrodes in the 0.1 M borate electrolyte with 1 mM Ni2+ at pH 9.2. Surprisingly, optimally deposited Ni–Bi films (ED-10 s and PD-30 min) display the same layer thickness of ca. 40 nm. Both Ni–Bi films enhance the photocurrent generation of BiVO4 at 1.23 VRHE by a factor of 3–4 under AM 1.5-light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) along with ca. 250% increase in the incident and absorbed photon-to-current efficiencies. Impedance analysis further reveals that the charge transfer resistance at BiVO4 is markedly decreased by Ni–Bi deposits. The primary role of Ni–Bi has been suggested to be a hole-conductor making photogenerated electrons more mobile and catalyzing a four-hole transfer to water through cyclic changes between the lower and higher Ni oxidation states. However, thick Ni–Bi films (>∼40 nm) significantly reduce the PEC performance of BiVO4 due to the kinetic bottleneck and charge recombination. Under identical PEC conditions (0.1 M, pH 9.2), the borate electrolyte (good proton acceptor) is found to be better than nitrate (poor proton acceptor), indicative of a proton-coupled electron transfer pathway in PEC water oxidation.
Introduction
Solar hydrogen and hydrocarbons produced through respective water splitting and CO2 conversion are promising chemical fuels without an anthropogenic carbon-footprint.1–5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation with simultaneous oxygen evolution drives the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) to water and CO2, producing H2 and hydrocarbons, respectively.4,6–9 In this regard, high efficiency PEC water oxidation is a key process in achieving sustainable production of solar fuels.4,10–12 Despite theoretically high efficiencies, however, most oxide semiconductor electrodes actually suffer from low performance most likely due to rapid charge recombination and uphill multi-PCET.11,13 To overcome such challenges, oxygen evolving catalysts (OECs)14–17 have been often coupled to semiconductor electrodes4,18–23 to catalyze water oxidation with reduced activation energies.7,13,24 For cost-effective chemical fuels, PEC components including OECs should be naturally abundant and operate effectively under nature-friendly conditions (e.g., circum-neutral pH).15,25 Whereas platinum group metal (PGM) oxides (IrO2, PtO2, RuO2) have low overpotentials of ca. 0.2 V for oxygen evolution,14 their high costs hinder their practical use and widespread application.
Naturally abundant heterogeneous OECs (e.g., metal oxides, hydroxides, and complexes) have been shown to work as alternatives with low cost and operation at circum-neutral pH. Particularly, cobalt-phosphate (Co–Pi) complexes have similar oxygen evolution effects to those of PGM oxides and have been demonstrated to enhance the performance of PEC water oxidation at pH 7–8 when coupled to semiconductor electrodes (Fe2O3,21,26 WO3,22 BiVO4,19,23,27 ZnO,28 and n-Si4,29). Nickel-borate (Ni–Bi) complexes also have been shown to operate as an alternative OEC with an overpotential of ca. 0.45 V and an activity of 1 mA cm−2 at pH 8,25 while NiOOH films (deposited on Pt) reduce the overpotential by ca. 0.15 V compared to Pt in alkaline media.30 The electrodeposition of Ni2+ in aqueous borate buffer (pH 9.2) creates amorphous di-μ-oxo bridged17 β- or γ-NiOOH structure17,30–32 with an oxidation state of Ni3+. Upon anodic bias, Ni–Bi becomes active with the mixed oxidation state of Ni3+ and Ni4+ (Ni3.6+ or Ni3.8+),17,32 which is reduced back to the Ni3+ state with the simultaneous oxidation of water into O2. As revealed by XANES and electrochemical studies, Co–Pi and Ni–Bi share similar molecular structures and catalytic mechanisms.16,17,32–34 In contrast to Co–Pi, however, Ni–Bi has not been coupled to a semiconductor electrode and its catalytic effect on PEC water oxidation has not been tested and demonstrated yet. Ni–Bi appears to have a greater potential than Co–Pi because (1) Ni is naturally more abundant than Co by a factor of ∼3 in the earth's crust and cheaper than Co by ca. 40% in the metals market,35 and (2) borate is more readily and practically available from seawater than phosphate (B: 4500 μg L−1, P: 70 μg L−1)36 because of its production as borax during the desalination process and the Li recovery process from seawater.
With this in mind, we have deposited for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, Ni–Bi complexes on BiVO4 electrodes through electrodeposition and photodeposition, and examined the Ni–Bi effects on PEC water oxidation in borate buffer solution (pH 9.2). It was found that the Ni–Bi effect depends markedly on the deposition method and deposition time due to the varying amounts of Ni–Bi deposited. With a ca. 40 nm-thick Ni–Bi film, the PEC performance was enhanced 2−4 fold in photocurrent flow along with nearly 3-fold greater quantum efficiencies. Oxygen generation at the bare BiVO4 was insignificant whereas the BiVO4/Ni–Bi achieved nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for oxygen generation. However, thicker Ni–Bi films appear to inhibit the PCET across the catalyst layer (kinetic bottleneck), reducing the photocurrent flow and inducing a non-faradaic pathway (charging–discharging process) at 1.23 VRHE.
Experimental section
Preparation of BiVO4 electrodes
BiVO4 electrodes were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO2, FTO, Pilkington, 3 mm thick, cut to 1.5 cm × 3 cm) with a modified metal–organic decomposition method. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Aldrich) 0.2 M and vanadium acetylacetonate (Aldrich) 0.03 M were separately dissolved in 2,4-pentanedione (Aldrich) as Bi and V precursor solutions, respectively. They were mixed in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of Bi to V. Then, 200 μL of the mixed solution was dropped onto FTO glass and spread with a spin-coater (JS-301-100; Jaesung Eng. Co.) at a spin rate of 1000 rpm for 6 s (repeated twice per coating cycle).19 After drying in air, the electrodes were annealed at 500 °C for 10 min (repeated 8 times). In the final stage, they were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h.
Preparation of BiVO4/Ni–Bi electrodes
Previous studies on the fabrication of Ni–Bi electrodes (on FTO) were completed exclusively through electrodeposition due to the photo-inactivity of FTO.25,32 Since BiVO4 is photoactive, photodeposition (PD) as well as electrodeposition (ED) of Ni–Bi were used on the BiVO4 electrodes. For ED, a three-electrode system was used with an as-prepared BiVO4 electrode (working electrode), a saturated calomel electrode (SCE; reference electrode), and a graphite rod (counter electrode). Ni–Bi complexes were electrodeposited by holding a constant potential of 1.2 VSCE (1.984 VRHE) for varying times (5 seconds to 1 hour) with a potentiostat/galvanostat (IVIUM technologies) in 0.1 M potassium borate (Bi electrolyte) at pH 9.2 containing 1 mM Ni(NO3)2. For PD, bare BiVO4 electrodes were immersed in the 0.1 M potassium borate electrolyte with a 1 mM Ni(NO3)2 solution. A simulated AM 1.5-light (400 mW cm−2) was used to irradiate the semiconductor electrodes from a 150-W xenon arc lamp (Ushio 150-MO) for varying times. After washing and drying, the electrodes were kept in the dark.
Photoelectrochemical measurements and surface characterization
The photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using a potentiostat (IVIUM technologies). Bare and Ni–Bi coupled BiVO4 electrodes, SCE, and a graphite rod were placed in a single cell with 0.1 M potassium borate (pH 9.2). An AM 1.5-light was used to irradiate the semiconductor electrodes through FTO glass (back illumination) from a 150 W-Xe arc lamp (Ushio 150-MO) at varying intensities of 100 to 400 mW cm−2. When necessary, the light was chopped during cyclic potential sweeps and application of constant potentials. The potentials versus SCE were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following relationship:VRHE = VSCE + 0.241 + 0.059 pH
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) or external quantum efficiency (EQE) was estimated in 0.1 M borate solution at pH 9.2 with the same three-electrode system using a 300 W-Xenon lamp (Newport Oriel). Monochromatic light was produced by a CS 130 monochromator with a 10 nm-bandpass, and the output power was measured with a silicon photodiode detector (Newport). The IPCE was then calculated from the following equation:  where Jph, Plight, and λ refer to the photocurrent density, photon flux, and wavelength, respectively. The absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) or internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was also calculated by dividing the IPCE values by the absorptance (η) and the fraction of electron–hole pairs generated per incident photon flux:  where A is the absorbance of the sample.
To determine the evolved molecular oxygen gas in the reactor headspace (50 mL), a fluorescence/temperature sensor probe (Ocean Optics) was placed in the headspace during the PEC reaction. A simulated solar light at high intensity (AM 1.5, 400 mW cm−2) was used to irradiate the semiconductor electrodes to accelerate oxygen evolution in the 0.1 M borate electrolyte at 1.23 VRHE.
The top and side views of BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni–Bi were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCA Lab 220i XL, MgKα source; VG Scientific) and a UV-Vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450) were used to examine the elemental binding energies and to obtain the absorbance of each sample, respectively.
Results and discussion
Photoelectrochemical behavior of BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni–Bi electrodes
Dincă et al. showed that Ni–Bi could be deposited onto FTO using cyclic potential sweep and constant potential methods. Both are facile and effective in creating Ni–Bi films on FTO (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, the latter is more facile and accurate in controlling the electrodeposition (ED) process and hence was adopted for the coupling of Ni–Bi to BiVO4. For the latter, a constant potential of 1.2 VSCE was applied to the BiVO4 electrode for varying times in 0.1 M borate solution with 1 mM Ni2+ (pH 9.2). As the Ni–Bi deposition proceeds, the substrates display a single anodic and cathodic current peak (Ep,a and Ep,c, respectively) that grows gradually at ∼1.6 and ∼1.4 VRHE (Fig. 1a). Both peaks are related to the redox reaction of Ni(IV/II) (E°= 1.68 VRHE) incorporated into the Ni–Bi catalyst and the increase in the deposition time may create thick Ni–Bi films. The similarity of the cyclic voltammogram (CV) patterns on FTO and BiVO4 (Fig. S1a, ESI†vs.Fig. 1a) indicates that Ni–Bi electrodeposition is insensitive to the type of substrate as long as the used substrates are electrochemically conductive. Although BiVO4 is semiconductive, approximately a 550-nm-thick BiVO4 film seems to be conductive enough for Ni–Bi deposition (e.g., see Fig. 4 and Fig. S1, ESI†). The photoelectrochemical (PEC) behaviors of bare and Ni–Bi-deposited BiVO4 electrodes were examined with linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) under chopped simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (Fig. 1b). The onset potential of ca. 2.0 VRHE at the bare BiVO4 in the dark shifts to ca. 0.5 VRHE upon irradiation, while BiVO4 electrodeposited with Ni–Bi for 10 seconds (BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-10 s)) shows the onset potentials of ca. 1.8 VRHE and 0.4 VRHE in the absence and presence of light, respectively. Such a cathodic shift results likely from the catalytic property of Ni–Bi for water oxidation as well as from inhibited charge recombination by Ni–Bi. Ni-containing hydroxides, oxides, and complexes are effective water-oxidizing catalysts,17,26,31,37,38 making BiVO4/Ni–Bi electrocatalytically active for water oxidation even in the dark. Hence, an increase in the Ni–Bi deposition (∼1 h) makes the electrocatalytic property more pronounced (see the potential region over 1.6 VRHE). However, the excess Ni–Bi deposition does not induce a higher PEC performance. Compared to BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-10 s), the chopped LSV profile of BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-1 h) shows that despite higher anodic peak currents, the stabilized photocurrents are lower than those of BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-10 s) as well as those of bare BiVO4. In addition, as soon as the light is off, cathodic peak currents are generated and decay by following the manner of the anodic peaks in a reversed way.

Electrolyte: 0.1 M borate buffered at pH 9.2; AM 1.5-light (100 mW cm−2). For electrodeposition (ED), BiVO4 electrodes were biased at 1.2 VSCE for varying times in 0.1 M borate with 1 mM Ni2+ (pH 9.2). 
This anodic peak/decay-to-cathodic peak/decay cycle with chopped irradiation is also found in the time-profiled photocurrent flows of BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-1 h) at 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 1c). It should be noted that Ni–Bi deposition for 1 hour makes BiVO4 completely photo-inactive despite the significant peak currents. On the other hand, Ni–Bi deposition for less than 60 s increases the photocurrent generation by a maximum of 3–4 fold (e.g., the case of ED-10 s). The generation of anodic and cathodic peaks upon external biases (e.g., irradiation, potential) is indicative of the existence of charge recombination pathways.39 This recombination arises due to accumulation of electrons in the bulk (anodic transient), accumulation of holes near the surface (cathodic transient), and/or trapping of electrons/holes at surface states.39–42 The near zero photocurrents after significantly high peaks suggest that the photogenerated charge carriers (particularly electrons) at BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-1 h) are almost 100% recombined likely due to slow hole transfer (cathodic transient).39 The sparse Ni–Bi deposit or thin Ni–Bi film, therefore, is highly beneficial to effectively capture the photogenerated holes, and increases photocurrent generation along with simultaneous water oxidation through the valency change of Ni (reactions (1) and (2)). However, when Ni–Bi is deposited in excess or is too thick, the photogenerated electrons may be transported to the interfacial hole-oxidized Ni–Bi (Ni3+–Bi and/or Ni4+–Bi; for simplicity, only the former is shown in eqn (1)–(3)), reducing it back to Ni2+–Bi (reaction (3)). In this case, Ni–Bi works as a recombination center. h+ (BiVO4) → h+ (Ni2+–Bi) → Ni3+–Bi(1) Ni3+–Bi + 0.5H2O → Ni2+–Bi + 0.25O2 + H+ + e−(2) e− + Ni3+–Bi → Ni2+–Bi(3)
Alternatively, photodeposition (PD) of Ni–Bi was carried out as well (Fig. 2). For this deposition, no electrochemical bias (potential and current) but an AM 1.5 light was applied to the BiVO4 film immersed in 0.1 M borate solution with 1 mM Ni2+. Similar to Fig. 1a, the Ep,a and Ep,c are 1.6 and 1.4 VRHE, respectively, and their peak intensities grow with an increasing photodeposition time (Fig. 2a). Linear sweep voltammograms also show that the optimally photodeposited Ni–Bi (PD-30 min) induces enhanced PEC effects, whereas the PD-2 h sample generates sharp anodic and cathodic current peaks that resemble those of the ED-1 h sample (Fig. 1b vs. 2b). Photocurrent generation profiles confirm that there is an optimal photodeposition time range and Ni–Bi becomes detrimental to the PEC activity of BiVO4 beyond the optimal photodeposition time range (Fig. 2c).

Electrolyte: 0.1 M borate buffered at pH 9.2; AM 1.5-light (100 mW cm−2). For photodeposition (PD), BiVO4 films were irradiated with an AM 1.5-light (400 mW cm−2) for varying times in 0.1 M borate with 1 mM Ni2+ (pH 9.2). 

Fig. 3 shows the effects of the Ni–Bi electrodeposition and photodeposition times on the photocurrent generation at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5-light irradiation (100 mW cm−2). It is not appropriate to compare both the deposition times because the deposition mechanism is different. In particular, the photodeposition proceeds through the oxidation of Ni2+ with the photogenerated holes of BiVO4; therefore, the amount of holes (photocatalytic activity or semiconducting property) that BiVO4 generates is a controlling factor for Ni–Bi deposition. Meanwhile, Ni–Bi forms through the electrochemical oxidation of Ni2+ in the electrodeposition process. Accordingly, the electron mobility at BiVO4 (electrical conductivity or metallic property) seems to significantly influence the interfacial Ni–Bi deposition. Despite such a difference, it is apparent that there are optimal levels of deposited Ni–Bi in both processes. To examine the surface structure and morphologies at these levels, FE-SEM images of bare and Ni–Bi-deposited BiVO4 films were obtained. Bare BiVO4 shows a compact and robust particulate film with a primary particle size of ∼100 nm and a uniform layer thickness of ∼550 nm (Fig. 4a and b). The interparticle structure is highly beneficial for charge separation and collection. However, when Ni–Bi is electrodeposited for 10 s, the entire BiVO4 surface is covered by around a 40-nm-thick Ni–Bi layer and no BiVO4 particles are exposed (Fig. 4c and d). The crack in Fig. 4d appears to be created from dehydration of the film.15,19 Surprisingly, the Ni–Bi photodeposited for 30 min has a very similar surface image along with the same film thickness of ca. 40 nm. Longer photodeposition (1 hour) further increases the Ni–Bi thickness to ca. 60 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). Bediako et al. estimated the electrodeposited Ni–Bi thickness based on the molecular structure of Ni–Bi and suggested that charges of approximately 1 mC cm−2 should be passed to grow an 8-nm-thick Ni–Bi film.32 In this study, BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-10 s) underwent a charge passage of ∼1.72 mC cm−2 during the Ni–Bi deposition. Thus, according to their estimation, the Ni–Bi thickness (on FTO) should be ∼14 nm. A three-fold thicker Ni–Bi film at BiVO4 implies that the Ni–Bi structure may be porous or the deposition kinetics may be different between the FTO and BiVO4. Unfortunately, Bediako et al. just calculated the thickness without providing the real film thickness,32 making comparison with our results difficult and requiring further study on the mechanism and kinetics of the film growth.

A Ni–Bi film deposited on FTO (ED-10 s) does not show any spectral response for wavelengths ranging from 350–500 nm. Hence no distinct difference in the UV-Vis absorption spectra between the bare and Ni–Bi deposited BiVO4 films is observed (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the Ni–Bi films hardly influenced the inherent photoelectrochemical events occurring within the BiVO4. The BiVO4/Ni–Bi (ED-10 s and PD-30 min) films were analyzed by XPS to examine the actual composition and chemical states. The spin–orbit splits of Bi (4f5/2 and 4f7/2) and V (2p1/2 and 2p3/2) spectra indicate that BiVO4 is a monoclinic scheelite structure (Fig. S4, ESI†).43 The Bi bands (4f5/2 at 164.3 eV and 4f7/2 at 158.1 eV) and V bands (2p1/2 at 529 eV and 2p3/2 at 515.9 eV) also confirm that Bi is trivalent while V is pentavalent.44 However, no XPS signals for nickel and borate are found likely due to the thin Ni–Bi films rather than due to the detection limits and/or their amorphous nature.25 Thus, thicker Ni–Bi films were prepared at BiVO4 with prolonged electrodeposition for 1 hour and photodeposition for 5 hours (Fig. 5). The Ni spectrum of the ED sample shows two main bands (Ni 2p3/2 at 855.3 eV and Ni 2p1/2 at 872.6 eV) and one 2p satellite band at 861 eV (Fig. 5a). The PD sample also exhibits a similar Ni spectrum yet with a much smaller intensity (Fig. 5b). The B spectra show only a single band at 191 eV indicative of B3+ (borate). In contrast to the obvious oxidation state of B3+, the accurate determination of the Ni oxidation state is rather difficult because there are diverse binding energies for the same Ni species (Ni2+ and Ni3+) within a difference of 1 eV.45 Nickel can have five different oxidation states (0 to 4+)46 and the most predominant in an aqueous environment is 2+ as a form of NiO and Ni(OH)2. However, Ni3+ is also found in electrodeposited films17,31,32,37,38 in the form of NiOOH. For comparison, the XANES studies for the electrodeposited Ni–Bi films showed that the oxidation state of Ni is predominantly 3+ or even higher (β- and γ-NiOOH).17,32 The surface atomic ratio of B and Ni is 8.5 for ED-1 h whereas the ratio for the PD-5 h sample is around 60. The significantly higher value of the latter is attributed to trace amounts of Ni (Fig. 5b), increasing the uncertainty in the ratio.

Roles and effects of Ni–Bi
Ni–Bi appears to play at least a dual role in PEC water oxidation by BiVO4. Initially, it inhibits the recombination of electron–hole pairs photogenerated at BiVO4 by effectively mediating the hole transfer, accompanying a change in the Ni oxidation state from lower (Ni2+ and Ni3+) to higher states (Ni3+ and Ni4+). Then, the higher Ni states are reduced to the lower states by withdrawing electrons from the water (Scheme 1). If so, the effects of Ni–Bi could appear at least as three primary results. First, the mobility of charge carriers (electrons and/or holes) may increase because of the enhanced hole transfer at the semiconductor. The increase in the mobility results in the reduction of the charge transfer resistivity or inversely the electric conductivity.47 In order to examine the electrical conductivities of BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni–Bi (PD-30 min), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses (Nyquist plots) of both films were carried out. In this study, the photoelectrochemical cell was considered to represent the classical Randles circuit composed of solution resistance (Rs), interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct), and capacitance associated with the Helmholtz layer at the electrode–solution interface (CH). According to the Nyquist plots (Fig. S5, ESI†), the electrodes exhibit semicircles with different radii. The fittings for the semicircles indicate that bare BiVO4 has an Rct of 3.14 × 104 Ω in the dark, which decreases to 2.43 × 104 Ω by irradiation due to additional photogenerated charge carriers. Such a decrease in Rct (i.e., photo-induced conductivity increase) is a typical property of semiconducting materials.12,48 Meanwhile the Rct of the BiVO4/Ni–Bi is significantly reduced by a factor of 8 (3.89 × 103 Ω) compared to the bare BiVO4, yet it is almost unchanged by irradiation (∼2% decrease). Hence, the charge transfer should be enhanced not only by irradiation but also by the Ni–Bi film, and the latter effect may result predominantly from the enhanced hole transfer to the lower Ni states (reaction (1)). It seems that the BiVO4/Ni–Bi is conductive enough as such and the interfacial hole transfer is not kinetically limited, leading to an insignificant change in the Rct by irradiation.

If the hole transfer is enhanced, then the electron transfer also will be enhanced and such an effect may appear as larger photocurrent flows by Ni–Bi deposition (Fig. 1–3). To diagnose the material effect in detail, the incident and absorbed photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs and APCEs, respectively) for the bare and Ni–Bi deposited BiVO4 electrodes were estimated in the 0.1 M borate electrolyte (Fig. 6). The IPCEs of the bare BiVO4 are approximately 13% in wavelengths ranging from 380 to 440 nm and rapidly decrease to almost zero at λ > 500 nm, indicating that the bandgap (Eg) of BiVO4 is ca. 2.48 eV.19 On the other hand, Ni–Bi deposition increases the IPCEs of the BiVO4 to around 30% in the same wavelength region with an onset wavelength of 500 nm. Overall, the IPCE pattern of the BiVO4/Ni–Bi is similar to that of bare BiVO4 since the Ni–Bi film is virtually transparent to photons over 350 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†). The similar IPCE patterns to the corresponding UV-Vis spectra suggest that the photogenerated electrons contribute to the currents. Fig. 6 also shows the APCEs of both electrodes, which have been estimated by dividing the IPCEs by the absorptance (i.e., η = 1–10−A) of the electrodes. Bare BiVO4 exhibits an efficiency of around ∼20% for the entire photoactive range (λ < 500 nm) and hence, more than 60% of the incident photons are wasted without being absorbed. However, only a 40-nm-thick Ni–Bi film can increase the APCE of “thin” BiVO4 up to over 50%. The APCE is the product of the internal charge transport efficiency (ηtrans) and interfacial charge transfer efficiency (ηinterface). The enhanced APCE by Ni–Bi deposition, therefore, indicates that the Ni–Bi film increases either or both efficiencies.

Third, it was examined whether Ni–Bi can enhance PEC oxygen evolution from water. To facilitate oxygen evolution and reduce measurement errors, an AM 1.5-light of 400 mW cm−2 (4 Sun) was used to irradiate the bare and Ni–Bi deposited BiVO4 electrodes at 1.23 VRHE in the 0.1 M borate electrolyte at pH 9.2 (Fig. 7). Despite the intensified irradiation, the O2 generation is negligible with <2 μmol for around 3 hours at the bare BiVO4, whereas it is markedly increased up to 30 μmol for the same period at the Ni–Bi deposited BiVO4. Theoretical calculation for O2 generation based on the assumption of 100% Faradaic efficiency is also shown for comparison. BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni–Bi generated on average 1 and 1.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (Fig. S6, ESI†), and hence, the four-hole water oxidation pathway, if predominant, should produce 4.8 and 10.7 μmol O2 h−1, respectively. It is found that the measured O2 amount is much smaller than that calculated with the bare BiVO4 but almost the same as that calculated with BiVO4/Ni–Bi. Nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for O2 evolution with the latter indicates that Ni–Bi effectively catalyzes water oxidation through the four-hole transfer process. The Faradaic efficiency with bare BiVO4 at the initial phase (∼1 hour) is nearly 100% as well but no further increase from prolonged irradiation occurs although the photocurrent gradually grows after 1 hour (Fig. S6, ESI†). By contrast, BiVO4/Ni–Bi not only produces O2 linearly with time but also displays a stabilized photocurrent over time. The photocurrent decays at initial phases (<1 h) are usually found in photoelectrochemical reactions due to various reasons (charge recombination, capacitive behavior, mass transfer limitation, etc.). It is of note that the photocurrent of bare BiVO4 increases after 1 hour yet O2 evolution decreases thereafter. This suggests that photoholes are not used for O2 evolution. Instead, it is presumed that they oxidize BiVO4 after 1 hour (self-oxidation and formation of Bi2V2O9 by two holes) directly or deactivate it indirectly through photo-created surface trap sites. In this regard, Ni–Bi appears to work as a surface protecting layer, inhibiting BiVO4 oxidation/deactivation and maintaining its PEC activity for water oxidation.22
 Fig. 7  Time-profiled O2 evolution during photoelectrochemical water oxidation by BiVO4 and BiVO4/Ni–Bi (PD-30 min) electrodes at 1.23 VRHE in 0.1 M borate solution (pH 9.2) under AM 1.5-light irradiation (400 mW cm−2). The dotted curves refer to the theoretical amounts of O2 evolution calculated from the photocurrents (see Fig. S5, ESI†) assuming 100% Faradaic efficiency. 
Finally, the role of borate was examined as well. Similar to phosphate in cobalt–phosphate-catalyzed water oxidation, borate was shown to play a role as a proton-acceptor in proton-coupled electron transfer.25,32,49,50 To compare with borate, nitrate, a poor proton acceptor, was used as an electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammograms of BiVO4/Ni–Bi in the dark are similar between nitrate and borate (Fig. 8). Upon irradiation, the onset potentials are around 0.25 VRHE with a negligible difference irrespective of the electrolyte and the deposition method. However, it is apparent that borate is better than nitrate in generating photocurrents in a potential range over 0.25 VRHE and the superiority of the former is consistently found in electrodeposited, photodeposited, and even bare samples (Fig. S7, ESI†). Instead of Ni–Bi, NiOxHy was also deposited on BiVO4 using the same deposition methods (ED-10 s and PD-30 min) but in the presence of nitrate as a deposition electrolyte. Despite the preliminary data, the borate electrolyte effect is apparent with a maximal increase of ∼90% in photocurrent generation at BiVO4/NiOxHy at 1.23 VRHE in a borate electrolyte. In all cases (ED, PD, Ni–Bi, and NiOxHy), the PEC activity of BiVO4 is higher in borate. The buffering effect of borate for pH changes seems to be beneficial for the high electrocatalytic activity of Ni–Bi. In addition, borate accepts protons that are generated during oxygen evolution, aiding the PCET activation of oxygen.51,52

Conclusions
This study successfully demonstrates that Ni–Bi can catalyze photoelectrochemical water oxidation of BiVO4 under naturally benign conditions (AM 1.5, 1 Sun, and pH 9.2). A dramatic increase in the faradaic efficiency for oxygen evolution (∼100%) by ca. 40 nm-thick Ni–Bi film deposition strongly indicates that the four-hole transfer pathway, which is insignificant on bare BiVO4, becomes predominant by Ni–Bi catalysis. Although the Ni oxidation state for the Ni–Bi film is not accurately determined (Ni2+vs. Ni3+), the cyclic change of Ni oxidation states (II/III/IV) appears to mediate the photogenerated hole transfer from BiVO4 to water. Such enhanced hole transfer makes the photogenerated electrons more mobile, increasing the IPCEs and APCEs of BiVO4 by 200–300%. In this regard, Ni–Bi plays the role of a hole–conductor and facilitates the generation of long-lived holes. Ni–Bi deposition on BiVO4 is a facile and controllable process that can be completed simply by applied potential or irradiation. Despite promising efficiency, however, thick Ni–Bi films (>∼40 nm) are detrimental to the PEC water oxidation of BiVO4 due to the kinetic bottleneck and charge recombination by the Ni–Bi.
