    , Accepted 9th November 2020First published on 11th November 2020AbstractFor the first time, a hexagonal phase CdS (H-CdS) film fabricated by thermal evaporation is used as the buffer layer in Sb2Se3 solar cells. It is found that the interfacial recombination of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on a H-CdS film has decreased compared with the cubic CdS (C-CdS) film. Theoretical calculations also confirm that the dangling bond density of C-CdS/Sb2Se3 is 10 times larger than that of the H-CdS/Sb2Se3 interface. The efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells has been increased by 80%, which mainly resulted from the better spectral response, especially in the long wavelength (600–1000 nm) region. In addition, the introduction of oxygen at the surface of the H-CdS film can enhance the absorption in the short wavelength range (300–600 nm) and optimize the band structure of H-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells. Moreover, it is found that an optimum pre-heating time during Al2O3 deposition results in better carrier transport and collection. Finally, an Sb2Se3 solar cell having a 7.35% efficiency with high depletion width and current density is obtained based on an FTO/hexagonal-CdS/Sb2Se3/Al2O3/Au structure. To our surprise, the efficiency of H-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells at 200 °C in this structure can still be kept at above 95% of the original value. We believe that our work can serve as a guide for further development of highly efficient and stable CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells.
Introduction
Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) thin films are attractive light absorbing materials for low-cost and high efficiency thin-film solar cells. These materials are composed of abundant, nontoxic, and inexpensive constituent elements and have other attractive optoelectronic properties such as a suitable bandgap (∼1.03 eV) and a large absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1).1–6 Up until now, Sb2Se3 thin films have been fabricated by a variety of methods such as co-evaporation,7 sputtering,8 rapid thermal evaporation (RTE),9 vapor transport deposition (VTD),10 and close-space sublimation (CSS).11 The highest efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells was reported based on two different structures: 7.6%12 for an FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au structure in which Sb2Se3 was prepared by the VTD method, and 9.2% for a Mo/Sb2Se3/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag structure in which Sb2Se3 was obtained by the CSS method.13 However, these efficiencies are still far below the theoretical limit for Sb2Se3 solar cells which is 32.74%.14 The low efficiency mainly results from the low carrier concentration and high interface recombination.15,16
According to previous reports, the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells is mainly limited by the low carrier concentration and the large number of interface defects.15,16 To improve the carrier concentration, multiple hole transport layers have been proposed such as PbS,17 NiOX18 and CuSbSe2.19 However, there is still no proper way to decrease the interface defects, especially in the structure of FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au. In a previous report, the interface defect density between CdS and Sb2Se3 can reach 1012 cm−3.20 Many factors can result in such a large number of interface defects such as lattice mismatch and elemental diffusion. Li et al. reported that the elemental diffusion during the process of chemical bath deposition (the reaction temperature is below 100 °C) can be prevented by using a thinner TiO2 layer at the interface between Sb2Se3 and CdS.13 But this method is not suitable in the structure of FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au. Therefore, we believe that the use of a higher temperature stability buffer layer or interface layer may be the only way to solve the high interface defect density problem in the structure of FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au.
Until now, the commonly used buffer layer for Sb2Se3 solar cells is a CdS film, which is also used in the highest efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cells. CdS has two common structures, namely cubic and hexagonal.21–23 Although hexagonal CdS (H-CdS) exhibits higher thermal stability than the cubic CdS (C-CdS) film,24 the C-CdS film is most widely used as a buffer layer in Sb2Se3 solar cells. There are only few reports on the use of H-CdS as a buffer layer to form a p–n junction with SnS,25 perovskites,26 and CdTe27 films, and the efficiencies of these reported solar cells are much lower than that based on the C-CdS film. In addition, there are no reports on the usage of H-CdS in Sb2Se3 solar cells.
However, we build a simple atomic model and find that the dangling bond density at the H-CdS and Sb2Se3 interface may be much lower than that at the interface between C-CdS and Sb2Se3. Therefore, we try to study the influence of H-CdS on Sb2Se3 solar cells. Until now, the most commonly used preparation method has been chemical bath deposition and the CdS film formed from this method is in the cubic phase.28–30 Here, we explore a process that is simple, inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and industrially applicable to obtain a high-quality and uniform H-CdS film.
In this study, a H-CdS film was obtained using the evaporation method and was used as the buffer layer to form a p–n junction with an Sb2Se3 film for the first time. We found that the Sb2Se3 film prepared by the RTE method could grow very well on the H-CdS film. The quality of the Sb2Se3 film was comparable to that of the Sb2Se3 film based on the C-CdS film fabricated by the VTD method. The efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on H-CdS was higher than those based on the C-CdS film because of the better spectral response and higher quality of the Sb2Se3 film.12 After process optimization, the efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells reached 7.35% based on the structure of FTO/H-CdS/Sb2Se3/Al2O3/Au. In addition, we believe that the efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the fabrication method for Sb2Se3 thin films. We also believe that these results will serve as guiding principles for further development of CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells, especially in industrial production.
Experimental
Preparation and annealing treatment of CdS films
The CdS films were deposited by single source evaporation (PTN104736, Mini SPECTROS, Kurt J. Lesker, USA) using CdS powder (99.999%, China New Metal Materials Technology Co., Ltd, China). The working pressure was 1.0 × 10−6 torr, the evaporation power was 35 W, the evaporation speed was 0.65 Å s−1 and the substrate temperature was room temperature. The thickness of the CdS film was 40 nm. Then, the CdS film was subjected to annealing in an annealing furnace (KSL-1200X, MTI, China). The annealing time was 10 min and the annealing temperatures were 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C.
Device fabrication
Sb2Se3 solar cells were fabricated with a standard device structure of FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/Au. To fabricate this structure, the CdS film was deposited by evaporation, and the resulting sample was then subjected to annealing in a furnace. The Sb2Se3 film was subsequently deposited on the surface of the CdS film. The preparation methods for Sb2Se3 and Al2O3 are consistent with our previous reports,17,31 and 100 nm-thick gold back-contact electrodes (0.0225 cm2 area) were deposited by evaporation.
Computational methods
The lattice geometry optimization of CdS was performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). A 4 × 4 × 2 k-point mesh was generated using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme for numerical integrations over the Brillouin zone. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted and ultra-soft pseudopotentials were applied with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 290 eV.12,13 The surface H-CdS(002) plane and C-CdS(111) plane were cleaved with 4 layers. The atoms of the bottom layers were constrained and the atoms on the surface were fully relaxed. A 15 Å thick vacuum layer was used to minimize the interaction between the periodic images. The geometry optimization was terminated when the energy and force on each ion were reduced below 5 × 10−5 eV per atom and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively.
Characterization
The structural characterization of the Sb2Se3 and CdS films was performed using a Rigaku D/MAX-2500. Raman scattering was performed using a micro-Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, 532 nm laser wavelength). The film morphology of Sb2Se3 and CdS films was investigated using an S4800 instrument (Hitachi, Japan). The surface roughness of the Sb2Se3 films was measured using an AFM (Nanman VS). Optical transmittance was measured using a UV-vis-2250 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted with a SPECS Microwave UV light source (He I = 21.2 eV). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the CdS film was conducted using a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI. C–V measurements were conducted using a Keysight precision LCR meter (Keysight E4980AL) in the dark at room temperature at 10 kHz with the DC bias voltage being changed from −1 to 0.5 V. The cross-sectional TEM of Sb2Se3 and CdS films was conducted using an FEI Titan Themis and cross-sectional EDS mapping was conducted using an FEI Super-X EDS. Temperature-dependent VOC measurements were conducted using a cryostat (Janis VPF-100) and cooled with liquid nitrogen. The efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells was measured using a solar cell I–V tester (Cell tester, USA). The EQE was measured with a Solar Cell Scan photovoltaic characterization system (Solar Cell Scan, China).
Results and discussion
High quality Sb2Se3 thin films based on hexagonal-CdS films
According to a previous report, the structures of CdS films deposited by chemical bath deposition and evaporation are different. The structure of a CdS film deposited by chemical bath deposition is a cubic phase (Fig. 1(a)) while that of a CdS film prepared by evaporation is a hexagonal phase (Fig. 1(b)). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to verify the structures of the C-CdS and H-CdS films. It can be seen from Fig. 1(c) that the H-CdS film exhibits a hexagonal structure (space group P63mc, a = b = 0.4132 nm and c = 0.6734 nm, JCPDS#: 65-3414) while the CdS film fabricated by the chemical bath deposition method has a cubic structure (space group F3m, a = b = c = 0.5832 nm, JCPDS#:68-2887). The XRD peak data also indicate that the H-CdS film is a pure hexagonal structure without any cubic phase. In order to further investigate the phase purity of the H-CdS film, XPS was used to measure the valence state of the H-CdS film. The XPS results (Fig. S1, ESI†) are consistent with previous reports.22 We also find that the H-CdS film exhibits a high transmittance in the range between 400 and 800 nm in Fig. 1(d). The highest transmission value reaches 85% in the visible region which is very close to the transmission of the C-CdS film. Fig. 1(e) shows the SEM images of C-CdS (e-1) and H-CdS (e-2) films. It can be seen that the H-CdS film is dense and pinhole-free. The grain size distribution of the H-CdS film is uniform and the largest grain size is about 100 nm, which is smaller than that of the C-CdS film. However, many impurities can be seen on the surface of the C-CdS film which is indicated in red colour. These impurities will increase the interface recombination and influence the deposition of the Sb2Se3 film. In addition, the surface roughness of the C-CdS (f-1) and H-CdS (f-2) films was tested using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. 1(f)). The result indicates that the average roughness (Ra) of the H-CdS film (Ra = 11.5 nm) is lower than that of the C-CdS film (Ra = 15.2 nm). The excellent crystallinity and optical properties suggest that the H-CdS film can replace the C-CdS film to fabricate high efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cells. The electrical properties of C-CdS and H-CdS films are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The H-CdS film shows a lower resistivity and a higher carrier concentration compared with the C-CdS film. Based on the above results, we believe that the combination method for the Sb2Se3 film based on C-CdS and H-CdS films may be different. In order to further investigate the difference, a diagrammatic sketch has been used to show the combination of the Sb2Se3 film based on both CdS films. It can be seen from the diagrammatic sketch (Fig. 1(g) and (h)) that both Cd and S atoms are on the surface of the C-CdS film while only S atoms are on the surface of the H-CdS film. So we suspect that the orientation, crystallinity and carrier recombination may be different.

In order to verify our inference, a detailed characterization has been used to test the Sb2Se3 film based on C-CdS and H-CdS films. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of Sb2Se3 films deposited on the H-CdS and C-CdS films. For both Sb2Se3 films, diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ values characteristic of Sb2Se3 (JCPDS#:15-0861) with a clear orientation along the (221) direction. In addition, the intensity ratio of the (221)/(211) peaks of the Sb2Se3 film grown on H-CdS is higher than that based on the C-CdS film (Fig. 2(b)), implying that the Sb2Se3 film deposited on the H-CdS film exhibits a better columnar growth pattern than that deposited on the C-CdS film.17,32,33 The cross-sectional SEM image of the Sb2Se3 film deposited on the H-CdS film (Fig. 2(c)) also shows a higher columnar growth pattern than that based on the C-CdS film (Fig. 2(d)), and this good columnar pattern results in a good surface of the Sb2Se3 film. The surface of the Sb2Se3 film deposited on the C-CdS film is rough (Fig. 2(f)), while the surface of the Sb2Se3 film based on the H-CdS film is compact and flat (Fig. 2(e)). From the XRD, surface and cross-sectional SEM results, it can be considered that the quality of the Sb2Se3 film based on H-CdS is higher than that based on the C-CdS film. In order to further investigate the orientation of the Sb2Se3 film on the H-CdS substrate, HR-TEM has been used. Fig. 3(a) shows the HR-TEM images of the Sb2Se3 film on the H-CdS substrate. It can be seen that the Sb2Se3 film also presents a good columnar growth pattern with high crystallinity. A distinct single columnar crystal can be seen in the cross-sectional TEM images of H-CdS and Sb2Se3 thin films (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). The distance between lattice planes is measured as 0.330 and 0.316 nm, which corresponds to the d-spacing of the (002) plane in the CdS film and the (221) plane in the Sb2Se3 film.34Fig. 3(d) shows the TEM-EDS mapping of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film and all the elements are well-distributed. However, the grain sizes of the Sb2Se3 film based on the H-CdS film also appear smaller than those based on the C-CdS film, which could be a limitation of the Sb2Se3 films based on the H-CdS film (Fig. S3, ESI†). From the above results, it can be seen clearly that the H-CdS film can replace the C-CdS film as a good substrate to grow a good quality Sb2Se3 film.

Efficiency improvement of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the hexagonal-CdS film
As expected, the efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film is higher because of the excellent quality of H-CdS and Sb2Se3 films. The device performance based on the H-CdS film shows an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.365 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 26.38 mA cm−2, a FF of 50.25%, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.83%, while the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the C-CdS film shows a VOC of 0.32 V, a JSC of 22.37 mA cm−2, a FF of 36.9% and a PCE of 2.64% (Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) shows the EQE spectra of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS and C-CdS films. To our surprise, the absorption range of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film is much higher than that based on the C-CdS film, especially in the range between 500 and 1000 nm. The increased EQE is consistent with the higher JSC of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film. The increase of EQE at long wavelengths could be attributed to the reduction in interface defects and the increase in the quality of the absorber layer.35–38 Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were employed to quantitatively investigate the influence of the two different CdS buffer layers on the VOC of the Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells. A plot of 1/C2 against the bias voltage of both Sb2Se3 solar cells is shown in Fig. 4(c), and the Vbi of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film (0.41 V) is higher than that based on the C-CdS film. In order to further investigate the reason behind the higher efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film, NCV (defect density calculated from the C–V measurement) was extracted from the C–V results. It can be seen from Fig. 4(d) that the value of NCV based on the H-CdS film is much lower, indicating a lower defect density. The depletion width (Xd) of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS (304.4 nm) film is higher than that of those based on the C-CdS (253.3 nm) film which indicates better carrier transport in the H-CdS device. The EBIC data (Fig. S4, ESI†) also show that the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film exhibit better carrier collection than those based on the C-CdS film. The EBIC result is also consistent with the EQE and NCV results. In order to understand the mechanism leading to such a decrease, we estimated the dangling bond density at the heterojunction interfaces using a simplified atomistic model. The calculation results show that the dangling bond density at the Sb2Se3/H-CdS interface is more than 10 times smaller than that at the Sb2Se3/C-CdS interface, which means a much lower interface defect density in the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the H-CdS film (Table 1). In order to further prove the reduction of the dangling bond density of H-CdS/Sb2Se3, the temperature-dependent open circuit voltage measurements were carried out from 150 K to 330 K (shown in Fig. 4(e)). The obtained value of activation energy for H-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells is 1.2 eV which is very close to the band gap of the Sb2Se3 films (1.26 eV), while that for the C-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells is 0.75 eV. This result indicates that the interfacial recombination of H-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells is much lower than that of C-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells. The decrease of interfacial recombination is mainly caused by the reduction of dangling bond density, which is consistent with our calculation results.39Fig. 4(f) shows the dark IV result of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on H-CdS and C-CdS layers. The result shows that the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the H-CdS film has a lower series resistance and a higher ideality factor than the device based on the C-CdS film, indicating a better diode quality and resulting in a higher FF of the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the H-CdS film. To confirm that this improvement is not accidental and demonstrate the reproducibility of the devices, a histogram of the J–V scan efficiencies for 25 independent cells was constructed. The efficiency distribution of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film shows a narrower distribution than that of those based on the C-CdS film. A detailed photoelectric parameter histogram of the Sb2Se3 film based on the H-CdS solar cell is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which shows a narrower distribution than that based on the C-CdS film.

Enhancement in the efficiency of the Sb2Se3/hexagonal-CdS solar cell by an easy annealing treatment of hexagonal-CdS
According to a previous report,40 the efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS film can be increased by treatment with CdCl2 solution because of the improvement of p–n junction quality and the reduction in defects. Thus, CdCl2 solution was used to treat the surface of H-CdS (TH-CdS) and C-CdS (TC-CdS) films. The efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on TH-CdS and TC-CdS films is shown in Fig. 5(a). However, the efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film does not improve in a similar manner. We suspect that the CdCl2 solution treatment may not be suitable for the H-CdS film. Therefore, an easy annealing treatment was applied instead of the CdCl2 solution treatment. The efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film at different annealing temperatures is shown in Fig. 5(b). To our surprise, the efficiency of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the CdS film after 500 °C heating (HTH-CdS indicates the annealing of H-CdS at 500 °C) treatment is much higher than that of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the as-deposited H-CdS film. The result is presented in Fig. 5(c), and the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the HTH-CdS film shows a VOC of 385 mV, a JSC of 29.1 mA cm−2, a FF of 56.53%, and an efficiency of 6.33%, while the corresponding values for the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on C-CdS are 364 mV, 26.38 mA cm−2, 50.25%, and 4.86%. Fig. 5(d) shows the EQEs of both solar cells, and the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the HTH-CdS film show higher absorption than those based on the H-CdS film in the entire range, especially below the wavelength of 500 nm. The dark J–V result (Fig. 5(e)) shows that the ideality factor (A = 1.6) of the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on HTH-CdS is lower than that based on the H-CdS film (A = 1.88). The decrease of the ideality factor is consistent with the increase of FF in the Sb2Se3 solar cell based on the HTH-CdS film. Fig. 5(f) shows the NCV result of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the HTH-CdS and H-CdS films, and it can be seen that the value of NCV has not changed much which means that the high temperature heat treatment does not cause any damage to the interface. The NCV result is consistent with the EQE result.

The increased efficiency of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the HTH-CdS film is mainly due to the increased oxygen concentration of the H-CdS film. During the high-annealing-temperature process, the CdS will react with oxygen and new phase CdO or Cd (O, S) will be produced. Fig. 6(a) shows the XRD patterns of the H-CdS film at different annealing temperatures. Clear CdO peaks appear when the temperature reaches 600 °C. No CdO peaks can be found in the XRD patterns of the CdS film annealed at 500 °C. We suspect that this is because the concentration of CdO is too small for detection. Then, XPS is used to confirm the presence of oxygen in the H-CdS and HTH CdS films. Detailed XPS data are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that, after 500 °C annealing, the peak intensity of oxygen increases (marked with a red ellipse) and the ratios of S/Cd decrease from 1.15 to 1.07 (Table S2, ESI†), which further confirmed that oxygen has entered the lattice of CdS and replaced S. Fig. 6(b) and (c) show the surface SEM images of H-CdS and HTH-CdS films, respectively. Many obvious extra particles appeared on the surface of the HTH-CdS film. We considered that the obvious extra particles may be CdO. In addition, the AFM images confirm that, after annealing treatment at 500 °C, a distinct bulge appears on the surface of the HTH-CdS film and the surface roughness of the HTH-CdS also increases (Fig. 6(d) and (e)). Furthermore, we find that the annealing treatment can shift the Fermi energy level toward the direction of the conduction band and increase the distance from the Fermi energy level of the Sb2Se3 film, which will cause an increase in the VOC of the Sb2Se3 solar cells (Fig. 6(h)). The bandgap and the position of the valence band are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).

In addition, the heat treatment of the CdS thin film has some advantageous influences on the Sb2Se3 film. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 8) show an enhancement in the columnar growth pattern of Sb2Se3 films based on the HTH-CdS film, which is better for carrier transport. Moreover, the XRD result indicates that the intensity of the (221) peaks of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the HTH-CdS film is higher than that of those based on the H-CdS film (Fig. S10, ESI†), which indicates that the Sb2Se3 film based on the HTH-CdS film shows better columnar growth than that based on the H-CdS film. In addition, the grain size of the Sb2Se3 film based on the HTH-CdS film increases (Fig. S11, ESI†). No pinholes or other phases can be found on the surface, which implies that the Sb2Se3 film based on the HTH-CdS film exhibits better nucleation than that based on the H-CdS film.

High efficiency hexagonal-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cell via the addition of a monoatomic Al2O3 layer
Finally, monoatomic Al2O3 is used to increase the carrier concentration and carrier collection to fabricate high-efficiency Sb2Se3 solar cells. According to our previous report, by adding an Al2O3 layer a thin P+ layer can be formed at the surface of Sb2Se3 and the carrier collection of Sb2Se3 solar cells can be increased.17 The diagrammatic structure of the device is shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Fig. 9(a) presents the I–V results of HTH-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells with and without Al2O3. It can be seen that, with the addition of the Al2O3 layer (Al-0), the efficiency of the HTH-CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells increases to 7.01%. Furthermore, both solar cells have high absorption between 400 and 1000 nm (Fig. 9(b)). The device with the Al2O3 layer shows higher absorption in the long wavelength range, which is consistent with a previous report.17 In addition, the depletion width (Fig. 9(c)) increases with the addition of the Al2O3 layer, implying better transport and collection of carriers.17,41 The depletion width results are consistent with the EQE results. Temperature is very important for the ALD Al2O3 layer and the commonly used temperature was 200 °C. Therefore, we adapted this temperature to fabricate the monoatomic Al2O3 layer and then placed the sample in a heating chamber. The monoatomic Al2O3 layer grows up in a very short time. We suspect that the efficiency can be further increased by increasing the pre-heating time (the time in the ALD chamber before Al2O3 layer growth) as it may improve the quality of the Al2O3/Sb2Se3 interface. Therefore, the influence of different pre-heating times was investigated in detail (Fig. S13, ESI†). Fig. 9(d) presents the I–V results of the HTH-CdS/Sb2Se3/Al2O3 solar cells with and without 5 min pre-heating. It can be seen from the figure that HTH-CdS/Sb2Se3/Al2O3 shows an efficiency of 7.35% with a pre-heating time of 5 min (Al-5). The detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. We guess that the increase of efficiency is mainly due to the improvement of carrier transport and collection and the reduction of recombination. The 5 min pre-heating treatment can result in a better Al2O3 layer and increase the diffusion thickness of the Al2O3 layer which can form a thick P+ layer.17 The TEM mapping also confirms that Al2O3 has diffused entirely in the Sb2Se3 films (Fig. S14, ESI†). Furthermore, the depletion width (Fig. 9(e)) increases with the increasing pre-heating time, which implies better transport and collection of carriers. The thickness of our Sb2Se3 film was 560 nm, and the depletion width was 493.1 nm, which indicates that all carrier transport was influenced by the electric field.

We also investigated the stability of the Sb2Se3 solar cell with and without the Al2O3 layers. As shown in Fig. 9(f), all devices exhibit a high stability under 100 °C. However, the efficiency of the devices without the Al2O3 layer decays quickly when the temperature increases over 100 °C. On the contrary, the efficiency of the devices with the Al2O3 layer is still stable even when the temperature increases to 200 °C, which indicates that the addition of the Al2O3 layer can clearly increase the stability of the Sb2Se3 solar cells. The degradation rate of the Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film is also lower than that of those based on C-CdS, which indicates the better temperature stability of Sb2Se3 solar cells based on the H-CdS film than that of those based on the C-CdS film.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we used a H-CdS film fabricated by the evaporation method as the buffer layer for Sb2Se3 solar cells and successfully replaced the CdS fabricated by chemical bath deposition. A Sb2Se3 solar cell with an efficiency of 4.83% was obtained based on the as-deposited H-CdS film because of the increase in absorption and reduction in dangling bond density. In addition, we found that an appropriate introduction of oxygen into the CdS film enhanced not only the optical and electrical properties but also the crystalline and columnar growth of the Sb2Se3 film. A Sb2Se3 solar cell with an efficiency of 6.33% was obtained based on the HTH-CdS film. Then, the efficiency was further improved by increasing the pre-heating time in the ALD process of the Al2O3 layer. Finally, a highly stable solar cell with an efficiency of 7.35% was obtained based on an FTO/HTH-CdS/Sb2Se3/Al2O3/Au structure. We believe that the work presented in this paper serves as a guide for the further development of CdS/Sb2Se3 solar cells, especially in environmental industrial production.
