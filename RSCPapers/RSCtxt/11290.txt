    , Accepted 6th June 2012First published on 7th June 2012AbstractFluorene-containing N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes were prepared, in which the fluorene moieties were connected to the Pt(II) center via acetylide bonds (–CC–). Different aryl groups were attached to the fluorene moiety, such as phenylacetylide (Pt-4), naphthalimide-4-acetylide (Pt-1) and in Pt-2, the fluorene moiety was changed to carbozale moiety. We found that with the fluorene linker between the arylacetylide and the Pt(II) center, the absorption of complexes in the visible range were intensified. All the complexes show room temperature (RT) phosphorescence. Furthermore, Pt-1 shows much longer triplet excited state lifetime (τ = 138.1 μs) than the analogue Pt-3 (τ = 47.4 μs). For Pt-2, with changing the fluorene moiety to carbazole moiety, the T1 state lifetime becomes much shorter (τ = 23.0 μs). Thus the one-atom (N vs. C) difference is crucial for the photophysical properties. The triplet excited state of Pt-1 was proved to be the intraligand excited state (3IL) by nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, spin density analysis and emission at 77 K. The complexes were used as triplet sensitizers for triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion. Upconversion quantum yield (ΦUC) up to 24.3% was observed for Pt-1. Under the same conditions the model complex Pt-4 shows no upconversion. The overall upconversion efficiency (η) of the new complexes are improved compared to the model complexes, such as Pt-2, Pt-3 and Pt-4. The improved upconversion efficiency was attributed to either the prolonged T1 excited state lifetime or the intensified absorption in the visible range. Our study on the fluorene-containing N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes will be useful for designing new phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes and for their applications.
Introduction
Upconversion, that is, emission at shorter wavelength, or more generally, population of the excited state at higher energy level than the excitation, has attracted much attention due to the application in optics, photovoltaics, artificial photosynthesis, etc.1–4 Among the upconversion techniques, such as with two-photon absorption dyes,5 or with rare earth nanoparticles,3 the upconversion based on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) has attracted much attention, due to the advantages of strong absorption of the excitation light, high upconversion quantum yield, readily tunable excitation/emission wavelength and non-coherent low excitation power requirement (solar light is sufficient as excitation source).6–19
In TTA upconversion, triplet sensitizers and triplet acceptors (annihilator/emitter) were combined to accomplish the upconversion cycle.6-8 The excitation energy is harvested by the triplet sensitizer, thus transition S0 → S1 was imparted and was followed by the intersystem crossing (ISC), by which the triplet excited state of the sensitizer was populated. Then the energy was transferred to the triplet acceptors via the Dexter mechanism,8,20i.e. the triplet–triplet-energy-transfer (TTET) process. Thus the triplet acceptor was promoted to the T1 excited state. Then with collision and annihilation, the acceptor at the singlet excited state will be produced, with the probability of 11.1%, determined by the spin statistic law.21,22 Radiative decay of the singlet excited state of the acceptor will produce the upconverted fluorescence, at shorter wavelength than the excitation of the triplet sensitizer.
The major challenge facing the TTA upconversion is the development of triplet sensitizers.6–19 It is desirable to develop new triplet sensitizers that show readily tunable excitation and emission wavelength. Furthermore, the lifetime of the T1 excited state of the sensitizer should be much longer than a few microseconds (μs), in order to enhance the TTET process.12,14,16,17,19
Concerning this aspect, the Pt(II) acetylide complexes in particular are interesting because the photophysical properties of Pt(II) acetylide can be tuned by using different acetylide ligands, and these complexes have been used for nonlinear optics and photo-induced charge separation, etc.15,16,23–39 The tunable photophysical property of the Pt(II) acetylide complexes is ideal for application as triplet sensitizers for TTA upconversion.6,7 However, the disadvantage of the normal Pt(II) acetylide complexes is the weak absorption in the visible region and the short lifetime of the T1 excited state.20,29,30,32,40 Usually the lifetime of the T1 excited state of the Pt(II) acetylide complexes is less than 5 μs.40 These properties have to be improved to optimize the TTA upconversion. For example, recently a Pt(II) acetylide complex was used as triplet sensitizer.41 However, the complex shows only moderate absorption in the visible range (ε = 8750/7600 M−1 cm−1 at 429/476 nm), and the lifetime of the T1 excited state is short (4.6 μs). As a result, upconversion quantum yield of less than 1.5% was observed for this sensitizer, far lower than that with Pt(II) porphyrin complexes.6
In order to address these aforementioned challenges, recently we used cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes,19 Ru(II) polyimine complexes,12,13 Pt(II) acetylide complexes,15,16,39 cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes,17 and organic triplet sensitizers,14 as novel triplet photosensitizers to improve the TTA upconversion. These complexes share the feature of intense absorption in the visible range and exceptionally prolonged T1 excited state lifetime.7a We also proposed that non-emissive phosphorescent complexes can be used as triplet sensitizers for TTA upconversion.13
We proposed that in order to access the Pt(II) acetylide complexes that show intense absorption of the visible light and the long-lived T1 excited state, one effective approach is to attach an organic chromophore to the Pt(II) center. We and others have demonstrated this is an effective approach.15,16,39,42 The 3IL state can be predicted by the DFT calculations.43 However, we noticed the limitations of this method, that is, with the red-shifted absorption wavelength, the energy level of the T1 excited state decreases sharply. This effect is detrimental for application in TTA upconversion because with decreased T1 excited state energy level, the available triplet acceptor will be limited and the anti-Stokes shift of the upconversion will become smaller (please refer to the Jablonski energy diagram of the TTA upconversion).6,7 Thus, the next challenge for the development of the triplet sensitizers for TTA upconversion is to move the absorption of the sensitizer to the red-end of the spectrum but without decreasing the energy level of the T1 excited state. Furthermore, Pt-3 shows long-lived triplet excited state (Scheme 1), but its absorption of visible light is weak,37 thus the overall upconversion capability (ηUC = ΦUC × ε, where ΦUC is the upconversion quantum yield and ε is the molar extinction coefficient of the sensitizer at the excitation wavelength) will be weak.7a
In order to improve the absorption of Pt-3 (Scheme 1) in the visible range, and to maintain the long-lived T1 excited state, herein we demonstrate the proof-of-concept of such a molecular design strategy with the fluorene as the π-linker between the organic chromophore and the Pt(II) center. The chromophore we selected is the naphthalimide (NI) moiety. Compared to the Pt(II) NI-acetylide complexes, the new complexes shows red-shift absorption by 1690 cm−1, but the T1 state energy level decreased by only 525 cm−1, with that of Pt-3 as the model complex. The new complex with the fluorene linker shows a very long lifetime of T1 excited state (138.1 μs). Upconversion quantum yield 24.3% was observed. We propose the upconversion performance can be evaluated by the ε × ΦUC. With this parameter, the upconversion of the new complex is 5.7-fold of the previous result with the Pt(II) NI acetylide complex as the triplet sensitizer.16a

Results and discussions
Design and synthesis of the complexes
The synthesis of Pt-1 was illustrated in Scheme 1. Pt-3 was reported to show long-lived triplet excited state, but the absorption in the visible range is weak. Fluorene has been extensively used in luminescence study but not in Pt(II) acetylide complexes.23 Thus we used fluorene to extend the π-conjugation of the acetylide ligand of Pt-1. The preparation of the ligand is based on Sonogashira coupling reaction. Alkyl chains were induced at the 9-position of the moiety to improve the solubility and the chemical stability of the complexes. Complex Pt-5, in which the NI moiety is replaced by phenyl moiety, was prepared as the model complex for comparison of the photophysical properties. All the complexes were obtained in satisfying yields. Recently we prepared Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes with fluorene ligands,16b but here different aryl groups were attached to the fluorene moiety and the photophysical properties of the complexes differ substantially from the previous complexes.
Steady-state electronic spectroscopy
The UV-vis absorption of the ligands and the complexes were studied (Fig. 1). The ligands L-3 and L-5 give absorption in the UV range (Fig. 1a). For the fluorene-containing ligands L-1 and carbazole-containing ligand L-2, however, the absorption is much red-shifted, with absorption maximum at 417 nm and 430 nm for L-1 and L-2, respectively. This is due to the extended π-conjugation framework of the ligands with the fluorene moiety.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra of (a) ligands (L-1, L-2, L-3 and L-5) and (b) complexes (Pt-1, Pt-2, Pt-3, Pt-4 and Pt-5). c = 1.0 × 10−5 M in toluene. 25 °C. 
The absorption of the complexes were also compared (Fig. 1b). The model complex, Pt-4, gives very weak absorption in the visible range. Pt-5 gives slightly enhanced absorption in the visible region (400–520 nm), with ε = 1.31 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 431 nm (Fig. 1b) and more intense absorption in the 350–400 nm region.
With the fluorene substituents, Pt-1 and Pt-2 show enhanced and red-shifted absorption compared to the model complex Pt-3, Pt-4 and Pt-5. For example, the absorption maximum of Pt-1 and Pt-2 are 433 nm (ε = 65400 M−1 cm−1) and 458 nm (ε = 28700 M−1 cm−1), respectively. It should be pointed out that the absorption are stronger than most of the unsubstituted Pt(II) biascetylide complexes.28–30,40
The room temperature (RT) emission of the ligands and the complexes were also investigated (Fig. 2). The emission of L-5 is with significant vibration progression (Fig. 2a). The emission of the ligands are roughly related to the π-conjugation framework. For example, the ligands L-1 and L-2 show the most red-shifted emission. Notably with one atom difference, L-2 is more red-shifted than L-1.
 Fig. 2  Normalized emission spectra of (a) ligands (L-1, λex = 400 nm; L-2, λex = 410 nm; L-3, λex = 330 nm; L-5, λex = 340 nm) and (b) complexes (Pt-1, λex = 440 nm; Pt-2, λex = 460 nm; Pt-3, λex = 420 nm; Pt-4, λex = 380 nm; Pt-5, λex = 410 nm). c = 1.0 × 10−5 M in toluene. 25 °C. 
The complexes show much more red-shifted emission than the ligands. The emission band of Pt-1 is structured, which is similar to the emission spectrum of Pt-3. Pt-3 is known for its intraligand triplet excited state (3IL).37,38a Usually the 3IL excited state gives structured emission band, whereas the normal metal-to-ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT) give structureless emission band, which is demonstrated by the emission of Pt-4 (Fig. 2b). Thus based on the emission profile, we propose that the T1 excited state of Pt-1 is with significant 3IL character, conversely, the emissive T1 state of Pt-2 is with more significant 3MLCT character.
The fluorescence quantum yields of the ligands varied significantly, with the lowest fluorescence quantum yield was observed for L-3 (Φ = 4.4%). For the fluorene-containing ligands L-1, L-2 and L-5, much higher quantum yields were observed (up to 84.3%). The fluorescence lifetime of the ligands are in the range of 1.57–3.86 ns. Compared to the fluorescence quantum yields of the ligands, the complexes give lower quantum yields. However, the luminescence lifetimes of the complexes are significantly longer than the lifetimes of the ligands. Notably, the lifetime up to 286.0 μs was observed for Pt-1. Furthermore, the lifetime of Pt-2 (τ = 19.7 μs) is much longer than the model complex (τ = 0.9 μs). Pt-3 was reported to show long-lived T1 excited state.37,38a The long-lived T1 excited state is usually an indication of the 3IL feature of the triplet excited state.16,17,32,37,39,44–47
Sensitivity of the emission intensity to O2
The emission intensity of the complexes is sensitive to O2, i.e. the emission can be remarkably quenched by O2 (Fig. 3). Thus these complexes can be used for luminescent O2 sensing.38,46,47 For example, the emission of Pt-4 is significantly quenched in air condition than that in nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 3b). For Pt-1, which is with much longer lifetime than Pt-4, the sensitivity is higher than that of Pt-4. For example, the emission is completely quenched in air atmosphere (Fig. 3b). Similarly the emission intensity of Pt-2 is also sensitive to O2 (see ESI†). The quenching of the emission of the complexes was studied with small steps of variation of the O2 concentrations (Fig. 3c). The quenching data were plotted by the Stern–Volmer equation (Fig. 3d). It was found that the quenching constant of Pt-1 is the largest one among the complexes studied (KSV = 33.75 torr−1) The quenching constant of Pt-3 is slightly larger than that of Pt-2. Pt-4 and Pt-5 give much smaller quenching constants. This trend is in agreement with the lifetime of the T1 excited state (Table 1 and Fig. 4), which is known that the complex with longer T1 excited state lifetime gives higher O2 sensitivity.48–50

77 K emission spectra
In order to assign the emissive triplet excited states of the complexes, emission at 77 K were studied (Fig. 5). The thermally induced Stokes shift (ΔES), i.e. the energy difference between the RT emission and the emission at 77 K, is an indication of the IL feature of the triplet excited state. For the complex with small value, the T1 state can be recognized as 3IL excited state.17,18,44,51
 Fig. 5  Emission spectra of the complexes (a) Pt-1, (b) Pt-2 at 77 K and RT. For Pt-1, λex = 440 nm; Pt-2, λex = 460 nm. c = 1.0 × 10−5 M in EtOH:MeOH = 4:1 (v/v). 
For Pt-1 and Pt-2, the emission maxima are slightly red-shifted compared to that at RT. Thus the T1 state is with significant 3IL feature. For Pt-5, however, the emission band gives a blue shift of 43 nm at 77 K compared to the emission at RT, the large thermally induced Stokes shift (ΔEs) of 1423 cm−1 indicates the 3MLCT feature of the triplet excited state.16b
Nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra
In order to study the long-lived triplet excited state of the complexes, the nanosecond time-resolved transient difference absorption spectra of the complexes were measured (Fig. 6). For Pt-1 and Pt-2, ground state depletion is clearly demonstrated by the bleaching at 440 nm and 460 nm, respectively. At the same time, intense transient absorption in the 500–850 nm region were observed.

These transient features are drastically different from that of the model complex Pt-4.45 Instead, the transient absorptions in the region of 500–850 nm are similar to that of Pt-3, for which a 3IL state localized on the NI moiety was assigned.37,38 Thus we propose that the T1 state of Pt-1 and Pt-2 can be assigned with significant IL components.
The lifetime of the T1 excited state of the complexes were determined by the transient absorption. Lifetimes of 138.1 μs 23.0 μs and 47.4 μs were determined for Pt-1, Pt-2, Pt-3, respectively (Table 2). We noticed the difference between the lifetimes determined with the luminescence method (Table 1) and the transient absorption methods (Table 2). The exact reason for these discrepancies is unknown.

Spin density analysis of the complexes
The features of the triplet state of the complexes were also studied from a theoretical perspective, i.e. the spin density analysis (Fig. 7).13,14,16,17,39,52Pt-4 is known to show the MLCT/LLCT mixed T1 excited state.15 From Fig. 7, it is clear that the spin density is distributed on the phenylacetylide ligand, Pt(II) center and dbbpy ligand. For Pt-3, it has been shown the T1 state is a 3IL state. The spin density analysis shows that the spin density surface is distributed on the NI ligand, the Pt(II) center and the dbbpy ligand contribute a very small portion to the spin density surface. Thus the spin density analysis is in agreement with the experimental results for Pt-3 and Pt-4.
 Fig. 7  The spin density of Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-3 calculated by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G((d)/LanL2DZ level using Gaussian 09W. 
For Pt-5, the spin density is distributed on the fluorene moiety, the Pt(II) center and the dbbpy ligand, which is similar to the result of the Pt-4. Thus we propose that the T1 state of Pt-5 is featured with MLCT/LLCT components. This is in agreement with the short lifetime of the T1 state of Pt-5 (τ = 0.74 μs).
For Pt-1, the spin density is distributed on the NI-fluorene moiety, the Pt(II) center and the dbbpy ligand make very small contribution to the spin density of the complex. Thus we propose that the T1 state of Pt-1 is featured with significant IL character. This is in full agreement with the long lifetime of the T1 state of Pt-1, measured by the luminescence method and the transient absorption method. For Pt-2, however, the spin density surface is similar to that of Pt-4 and Pt-5, thus we propose that the T1 state is with significant MLCT feature. This is in agreement with the relatively short lifetime of the triplet excited state of Pt-2. Thus the spin density analysis is helpful for assignment of the character of the triplet excited state of the transition metal complexes.
We have shown that the absorption of the complexes were enhanced with the fluorene moiety and the lifetimes of T1 excited states were extended.
Application of the complexes as triplet sensitizers for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion
As an application of the enhanced absorption of the complexes in the visible region and the prolonged lifetime of the T1 excited states, the complexes were used as triplet sensitizers for the TTA based upconversions.6-19,53
Upconversions have attracted much attention due to their applications in photovoltaics, fluorescence imaging, and photonics. The recently developed TTA upconversion is particularly promising among the other upconversion methods, such as the two-photon-absorption (TPA) dyes,5 the upconversion with rare earth metal materials,3etc., due to the advantages of TTA upconversion of readily tunable excitation/emission wavelength, intense absorption of the visible light, and high upconversion quantum yields, etc.6,7
The current development of the TTA upconversion is facing some disadvantages, such as the limited availability of the triplet sensitizers.6–19 It is desired to develop new triplet sensitizers for TTA upconversion.
The TTA upconversion with the Pt(II) complexes as the triplet sensitizers can be summarized in Scheme 2. The photoexcitation of the complexes will produce the singlet excited states, such as the 1MLCT or the 1IL state. Then the triplet excited states of the complexes were populated via the internal conversion (IC). It should be noted that for complex Pt-1, the 3IL state is much lower in energy level than that of the 3MLCT state of the N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes. Then the TTET occurs between the triplet excited state of the sensitizer and the triplet acceptor, 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA). It should be pointed out that the quenching of the triplet excited state of the sensitizers, for which both emissive or non-emissive, the principal rules of the Stern–Volmer quenching was followed, i.e. the TTET efficiency is proportional to the lifetime of the triplet excited state of the sensitizers. Furthermore, since the TTA process is dependent on the concentration of the acceptors at the triplet excited state, thus the TTA, as well as the upconverted fluorescence emission, is proportional to the concentration of the sensitizers at the triplet excited state. Thus the light-harvesting ability and the intersystem crossing (ISC) of the sensitizers are also important for the TTA upconversion.
 Scheme 2  Jablonski diagram illustrating the sensitized TTA upconversion process between Pt(II) complexes (exemplified by Pt-1) and DPA. The effect of the light-harvesting ability and the luminescence lifetime of the Pt(II) sensitizer is also shown. E is energy. GS is ground state (S0). 1IL* is intraligand singlet excited state (NI-fluorene localized). IC is internal conversion. ISC is intersystem crossing. 3MLCT* is the Pt(II) based metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer triplet excited state. 3IL* is intraligand triplet excited state (NI-fluorene localized). TTET is triplet–triplet energy transfer. 3DPA* is the triplet excited state of DPA. TTA is triplet–triplet annihilation. 1DPA* is the singlet excited state of DPA. The emission bands observed for the sensitizers alone is the 3IL emissive excited state. The emission bands observed in the TTA experiment is the simultaneous 3IL* emission (phosphorescence) and the 1DPA* emission (fluorescence). 
Based on the Jablonski diagram of the TTA upconversion (Scheme 2), two parameters of the sensitizer are crucial for the TTA upconversion, that is, the light-harvesting ability of the sensitizer and the lifetime of the T1 excited state of sensitizer. Strong absorption of the excitation light will produce more concentrated sensitizer molecules at the triplet excited state, with which the concentration of the acceptor molecules at the triplet excited state will be highly populated. The long-lived T1 excited state of the sensitizer will also enhance the TTET efficiency. Thus the TTA upconversion can be improved with the sensitizer that shows intense absorption of the visible light and the long-lived T1 excited state. Thus the complexes Pt-1–Pt-5 were used as triplet sensitizers for TTA upconversion. Based on the T1 state energy levels of these complexes, DPA was used as triplet acceptor. It should be pointed out that the selection of the acceptor is also dependent on the excitation wavelength. Only those triplet acceptors that show no absorption at the excitation wavelength of the sensitizer can be used as triplet sensitizer, otherwise the triplet acceptor will be excited and significant interference with the upconversion will be resulted.
The emission of the complexes alone upon 473 nm laser excitation were studied (Fig. 8a). Dependent on the phosphorescence quantum yield and the absorbance at 474 nm, the complexes give different emission intensity. Pt-1 and Pt-2 give relatively weaker emission than other complexes, due to their smaller phosphorescence quantum yields than that of Pt-3, Pt-4 and Pt-5. It should be noted that the absorbance of Pt-1 and Pt-2 are stronger than other complexes.
 Fig. 8  Emission and upconversion with the complexes as the triplet sensitizer upon 473 nm laser excitation. (a) Emission of the Pt(II) complexes without DPA. (b) Upconverted emission in the presence of DPA. λex = 473 nm, 5 mw, c[sensitizers] = 1.0 × 10−5 M, c[DPA] = 4.3 × 10−5 M, in toluene. 25 °C. 
In the presence of DPA, however, upconverted fluorescence emission in the region of 400–550 nm were observed for Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-3. These new emission bands are due to the upconverted fluorescence of DPA. Excitation of the sensitizers or the DPA alone did not produce this emission band, thus proved the upconversion for the mixture of the complexes and DPA.
Interestingly, the upconversion with Pt-1 and Pt-2 are more significant than that with Pt-3, despite the weak emission of Pt-1 and Pt-2 (Fig. 8a). The significant upconversion with Pt-1 and Pt-2 as the triplet sensitizer is due to the enhanced absorption of visible light and the long-lived T1 excited states of Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-3. The upconversion with these complexes are red-shifted compared to the fluorene-containing Pt(II) acetylide complexes we reported recently.16b
The upconversion quantum yields were determined, the complex Pt-1 shows the most significant upconversion with quantum yield up to 24.3%. Similar upconversion quantum yields were observed for Pt-2 and Pt-3 (14.7% and 19.2%, respectively Table 2). We noticed the quantum yield is higher than the previously expected 11.1% (based on the spin density statistic).6,7 However, since the quartet excited state can also be responsible for the upconversion, thus upconversion quantum yields higher than 11.1% is possible. Previously upconversion quantum yield higher than this value have been reported.6,9
Recently we propose that the overall upconversion capability of transition metal complexes can be described as: ηUC = ε × ΦUC(1)where ε is the molar extinction coefficients of the sensitizers as the excitation wavelength and ΦUC is the upconversion quantum yield.7 The upconversion capability (ηUC) of a complex is proportional to the molar extinction coefficient, that is, the complexes that give larger molar extinction coefficients will give stronger upconversion emission intensity (Pt-2vs.Pt-3, Fig. 8b). The upconversion quantum yield (ΦUC) itself is insufficient to describe the upconversion property of the sensitizers, especially for applications, such as photovoltaics. Based on this new equation, the value of Pt-1 is 5.7-fold of Pt-3. Notably, Pt-2 and Pt-3 give similar upconversion quantum yields (ΦUC is 14.7% and 19.2%, respectively), but the ΦUC value is different, the η value of Pt-2 is 3.0-fold of Pt-3. The different value is due to the larger ε value of Pt-2. This more reasonable description of the upconversion by the η value is proved by experiments (Fig. 8b), in which the upconversion fluorescence intensity of Pt-2 is much higher than that of Pt-3. We also noted that the upconversion capability (ηUC) of the new complexes are 2-fold of the fluorene-containing Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes we reported recently.16b
In order to confirm that the blue emission in Fig. 8 is due to upconversion, the lifetime of the blue emission band with Pt-1 as the triplet photosensitizer in Fig. 8 were measured (Fig. 9a). The lifetime was measured as 488.1 μs. This long-lived fluorescence emission is characteristic of the TTA upconversion. The lifetime of the prompt fluorescence of DPA was determined as 5.6 ns (Fig. 9b). Similar long-lived delayed fluorescence were observed with Pt-2 and Pt-3 as the triplet photosensitizers (τDF = 175.1 μs and 14.4 μs, respectively. See ESI†.). It should be pointed out that the delayed fluorescence lifetime is resulted from the collision of the triplet photosensitizer and the triplet acceptor, as well as energy pooling effect of the triplet photosensitizer, thus the lifetime value is highly dependent on the experimental conditions, such as the concentrations of the photosensitizers and the acceptors (see ESI†).
 Fig. 9  (a) Delayed fluorescence observed in the TTA upconversion with compound Pt-1 as triplet photosensitizer and DPA as the triplet acceptor. Excited at 473 nm (nanosecond pulsed OPO laser synchronized with spectrofluorometer) and monitored at 410 nm. Under this circumstance the compound Pt-1 is selectively excited and the emission is due to the upconversion of DPA. In deaerated toluene c[sensitizers] = 1.0 × 10−5 M; c[DPA] = 4.3 × 10−4 M. (b) The prompt fluorescence decay of DPA determined in a different experiment (excited with picosecond 405 nm laser, the decay of the emission was monitored at 420 nm) 20 °C. 
The efficiency of the TTET process can be quantitatively studied by the quenching experiments (Fig. 10). The emission of the sensitizers can be quenched by DPA (Fig. 10a–c). The quenching is due to TTET from the sensitizer's triplet excited state to the triplet acceptor. Herein the singlet state energy transfer is impossible because of the unmatched energy levels.6-8

(d) Stern–Volmer plots for phosphorescence quenching of complexes Pt-1–Pt-5. 
We found that the quenching of the phosphorescence of Pt-1 is the most significant among the complexes. The quenching data were plotted as the Stern–Volmer curves (Fig. 10). Fitting of the data gives a second order quenching constant of 1647 M−1 for Pt-1, which was followed by Pt-3 (KSV = 273.6 M−1) and then Pt-2 (KSV = 36.6 M−1). Pt-4 and Pt-5 give very small quenching constants (Table 2). The quenching effect is due to the different lifetime of the complexes.7,14,16−19,39

The role of the dark excited state in the TTA upconversion was unambiguously demonstrated in Fig. 11. For Pt-3 (see ESI†), the phosphorescence was quenched with increased DPA concentration, concurrently the upconverted fluorescence was enhanced. This result is reasonable since the TTET occurs between the emissive triplet excited state of Pt-3 (ΦUC = 19.2%) and the triplet acceptor DPA. For Pt-1, however, the upconverted fluorescence increased dramatically, but without any much phosphorescence to be quenched (Fig. 11a). The similar result was observed for Pt-2 (Fig. 11b). The results of Pt-1 and Pt-2 clearly demonstrated that the non-emissive triplet excited state of the triplet sensitizers were involved in the TTET process. Thus we propose that non-phosphorescent transition metal complexes can be used as the triplet sensitizers for TTA upconversion.13,14,16,17
The upconversion is visible with un-aided eye (Fig. 12). For Pt-4 and Pt-5, the emission color is yellow to orange and the emission does not change in the presence of DPA, due to the lack of upconversion with these two sensitizers (Fig. 8b). For Pt-1 and Pt-2, however, the emission color of the sensitizers alone are red to deep red, but the emission turns to bright blue in the presence of DPA, due to the remarkable upconversion with the sensitizers. Similar result was observed with Pt-3. It is observed that the upconversion intensity of Pt-1 and Pt-2 are more intense than that with Pt-3. This is exactly the demonstration of the η values of the sensitizers.

Conclusions
In summary, fluorene-containing N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complex Pt-1 was prepared, in which the fluorene moiety was directly connected to the Pt(II) center via CC bond. Different aryl groups were attached to the fluorene moiety, phenylacetylide (Pt-4), naphthalimide-4-acetylide (Pt-1). In Pt-2, an analogue of Pt-1, the fluorene moiety was changed to carbozale group. The model complexes Pt-3, Pt-4 and Pt-5 were used for comparison in the photophysical studies. We found that with the fluorene linker between the arylacetilide and the Pt(II) center, the absorption of complexes in the visible range were intensified. All the complexes show room temperature phosphorescence. Furthermore, we found that the Pt-1 shows much longer triplet excited state lifetime (τ = 138.1 μs) than the analogue Pt-3 (τ = 47.4 μs) without the fluorene linker, as well as Pt-2 (τ = 23.0 μs), with one atom of substitution (difference between the fluorene and carbazole moiety). Carbazole was used as the linker between the naphthalimide and the Pt(II) center (Pt-2), however, much shorter triplet excited state lifetime was observed (τ = 23.0 μs). Thus the one-atom (N vs. C) difference is crucial for the photophysical properties. The triplet excited state of Pt-1 was proved to be the intraligand excited state (3IL) by nano-second time-resolved spectroscopy, spin density analysis and emission spectra at 77 K. The complexes were used as triplet sensitizers for triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. Upconversion quantum yield (ΦUC) up to 24.3% was observed for Pt-1. The overall upconversion efficiency (ηUC) of the new complexes are improved compared to the model complexes, such as Pt-3, Pt-4 and Pt-5. The improved upconversion efficiency (ηUC) was attributed to either the prolonged T1 excited state lifetime or the intensified absorption in the visible range (ε). Our study on the fluorene-containing N^N Pt(II) bisacetylide complexes will be useful for design new phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes and for their applications.
Experimental section
Physical measurements
The nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra were detected by laser flash photolysis instruments (LP920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) and recorded on a Tektronix TDS 3012B oscilloscope. The lifetime values (by monitoring the decay trace of the transients) were obtained with the LP900 software. All samples were deaerated with argon for ca. 30 min before measurement and the gas flow is kept during the measurement.
Triplet–triplet-annihilation upconversions
Diode pumped solid state (DPSS) laser (473 nm) was used for the upconversions. The power of the laser beam is measured with VLP-2000 (a pyroelectric power meter). The laser power used in the upconversion was 5 mW, the laser spot diameter is 3 mm. The samples were purged with N2 or Ar for 30 min before measurement (note the upconversion can be significantly quenched by O2). For the upconversion experiments, the mixed solution of the complex (triplet sensitizer) and DPA (triplet acceptor) was degassed for 30 min with N2 or Ar. Then the solution was excited with laser. The upconverted fluorescence of DPA was observed with spectrofluorometer. In order to suppress the laser scattering, a black box with a small hole on it was put behind the fluorescent cell to trap the laser beam behind the vial (the small hole as the entrance of the laser into the black box).
The upconversion quantum yields were determined with a laser dye Coumarin 6 as the quantum yield standard (Φstd = 0.78 in CH3CH2OH) and the quantum yields were calculated with eqn (2),6 where ΦUC, Aunk, Iunk and ηunk represents the quantum yield, absorbance, integrated photoluminescence intensity and the refractive index of the samples and the solvents, respectively. The equation is multiplied by a factor 2 in order to make the maximum quantum yield to be unity. (2)
For the measurement of the TTET efficiency, i.e. the Stern–Volmer quenching constants, the concentration of the sensitizer was fixed at 1.0 × 10−5 M, the quenching of the phosphorescence of the sensitizer was measured with increasing the DPA concentration in the solution.
The CIE coordinates (x, y) of the emission of the sensitizers alone and the emission of the upconversion were derived from the emission spectra with the software of CIE color Matching Linear Algebra.
DFT calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used for optimization of the ground state geometries of both singlet states and triplet states. The energy level of the T1 state (energy gap between S0 state and T1 state) were calculated with the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), based on the optimized singlet ground state geometries (S0 state). TDDFT calculations were also used for the prediction of the UV–vis absorption of the triplet sensitizers at the triplet state, in our case it is the transient absorption of the triplet sensitizers after laser flash. Please note that the bleaching bands in the time-resolved transient absorption spectra cannot be predicted by the TDDFT calculations. All the calculations were performed with Gaussian 09W.43

 	Scheme 2  Jablonski diagram illustrating the sensitized TTA upconversion process between Pt(II) complexes (exemplified by Pt-1) and DPA. The effect of the light-harvesting ability and the luminescence lifetime of the Pt(II) sensitizer is also shown. E is energy. GS is ground state (S0). 1IL* is intraligand singlet excited state (NI-fluorene localized). IC is internal conversion. ISC is intersystem crossing. 3MLCT* is the Pt(II) based metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer triplet excited state. 3IL* is intraligand triplet excited state (NI-fluorene localized). TTET is triplet–triplet energy transfer. 3DPA* is the triplet excited state of DPA. TTA is triplet–triplet annihilation. 1DPA* is the singlet excited state of DPA. The emission bands observed for the sensitizers alone is the 3IL emissive excited state. The emission bands observed in the TTA experiment is the simultaneous 3IL* emission (phosphorescence) and the 1DPA* emission (fluorescence).
