    , Accepted 23rd December 2011First published on 31st January 2012AbstractThis paper presents a facile route to prepare CuInS2 (CIS) as a light absorber for solar cells. CIS was effectively deposited inside the pores of the nanoporous anatase titanium dioxide photoelectrodes with a high coverage degree. The performance of the CIS-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes could be substantially enhanced through a sequential coating with a CdS shell and a ZnS layer via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and photocurrent experiments were employed to study the effect of CdS and ZnS coating. The CdS shell provided high surface coverage to passivate surface states. The ZnS layer acted as a potential barrier which was similar to an insulating layer employed in the conventional metal–insulator–semiconductor solar cells, allowing the adjustment of the electric field and potential distribution in the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte and suppressing the dark current, resulting in further increase in the photoresponse. We found that the thickness of the nanoporous TiO2 films had a dramatic impact on the optical response and efficiency of CIS-sensitized photoelectrodes, with the 5 μm sample performing much better than the 11 μm sample, which underlined the importance of charge (or ion) transport kinetics.
1. Introduction
TiO2 is one of the most explored semiconductors applied in the field of photovoltaics because of its high chemical stability, suitable energy band position, and wide availability.1 However, TiO2 with a large band gap (3.2 eV) only responds to the ultraviolet region, which comprises approximately 5% of the solar spectrum and leaves behind most of the solar energy unused.1c Therefore, for the sake of extending the spectral response into the visible region and utilizing most of the solar energy, surface sensitization of TiO2 with a narrow bandgap semiconductor has attracted much attention in recent years.2 Ternary chalcopyrite CuInS2 (CIS) is an ideal semiconductor material for achieving this vested goal, owing to its high absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 and direct bandgap (Eg) of 1.5 eV which matches well the solar spectrum. CIS is attractive also because of its low toxicity and excellent performance in thin film photovoltaic devices.1c,d,3
Nanostructured solar cells have attracted intense research interest in recent years,4 among which CIS-sensitized TiO2 solar cells have shown promising progress in recent years.1c,d,3a,4c,5 To further improve the performance, the interface processes of charge carriers should be investigated, because the main loss mechanism for nanostructured solar cells is closely related to the interface processes. This is especially true for nanostructured solar cells owing to the large specific interface area of nanomaterials. Therefore, efforts have been devoted to modify the interface structure for nanostructured solar cells with a passivation layer. Recently, quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) treated by a ZnS coating have attracted much attention since Yang et al.6 pioneered this strategy in 2002, which demonstrated the significant improvement of the photovoltaic properties due to a ZnS layer over a TiO2/PbS/CdS electrode via the SILAR method. Thereafter, this procedure has arisen as an efficient interface treating strategy applied to the preparation of QDSCs for performance improvement.2b,7 Up to now, owing to the ZnS, the best conversion efficiency of 4.22% has been obtained in CdS and CdSe co-sensitized solar cells.8 An attempt to understand the role of the ZnS coating can be found in the literature.7b,9 Commonly, the efficiency enhancement was attributed to both the blockage of the TiO2 surface and the passivation of the QD surface states. The former mainly reduced the recombination at the interface and the latter prevented the electron trapping into the surface states.7c,8–11 However, there are several interfaces in the QDSCs, and the passivation of these interfaces with different coating materials on the photovoltaic performance has not been investigated in-depth.
This paper aims at illustrating the different effects of a CdS shell and a ZnS coating on the photovoltaic performance of CIS photoelectrodes. In practice, the complete photoelectrode after a full passivation consists of FTO/TiO2 compact layer/TiO2 mesoporous layer/ZnS/CIS/CdS/ZnS. In this paper the TiO2 photoelectrodes are sensitized by CIS through spin-coating followed by sulfurization.12 The present study demonstrates the enhancement of the photoresponse through a CdS shell and a ZnS layer sequentially deposited via the SILAR method.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Methods
All the chemicals used were of reagent grade or better. The fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrates were successively ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and acetone for 30 min, respectively. A compact TiO2 layer approximately 100 nm thick was commonly deposited onto the ultrasonically cleaned FTO substrates by immersion in a 0.09 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 20 min, then annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min. TiO2 mesoporous films were prepared by Doctor's blade technique using a slurry of 0.45 g TiO2 (Degussa P25) powders with 0.18 g PEG (Mw 20000) dispersed in 2 ml ethanol, 0.05 ml acetyl acetone and 0.05 ml Triton X-100 mixture on a TiO2 compact layer-coated F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate. The samples were heated in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The sensitized photoelectrodes with TiO2 mesoporous film thicknesses of ∼5 μm and 11 μm were designated as 5 μm sample and 11 μm sample, respectively, throughout the paper if not stated otherwise. The thickness was controlled by different amounts of TiO2 slurry.

ZnS pre-treatment. 
According to the previous literature,2b,8–11,13 the performance of photoelectrodes could be improved after treating with a ZnS layer. Accordingly, before spin-coating, TiO2 electrodes were passivated by a ZnS layer via the SILAR method.2b This layer also played a role of a buffer layer between TiO2 and the light absorber.14 For ZnS deposition, 0.05 M Zn(NO3)2 in ethanol and 0.05 M Na2S in methanol/water (7:3, v/v) were used for one SILAR process with a dipping time of 1 min for each cycle and repeated for 15 cycles.


CIS deposition. 
First step: spin-coating. 
CIS was prepared on the substrate by a sol–gel spin-coating method.12,15 In this paper CIS was deposited on the surface of TiO2 films as light absorbing layer. Some simplifications were made to the method by Todorov et al.12 Briefly, Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O and In(CH3COO)3 with a molar ratio of 1.2 to 1 were dispersed in ethanol and triethanolamine (TEA). The mixture was first stirred for 4 h at 60 °C and then for 24 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the transparent and deep-blue colored solution was obtained and used directly for spin-coating. The as-prepared solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 800 rpm for 20 s and then at 2000 rpm for 1 min. In order to ensure sufficient coating, the spin-coating was repeated three times. After the spin-coating, the samples were transferred onto a hot plate and dried at 250 °C in air for 5 min. This process was considered as one coating cycle. The coating cycle was repeated for 1–6 times.
Second step: sulfurization. 
The as-grown films were sulfurized in an alumina tube. High purity sublimed sulfur powder as sulfur source and the as-grown films were put into two adjacent ceramic boats and loaded into the alumina tube. Under an inert atmosphere such as N2 or Ar, the as-grown films were surrounded by sulfur steam and then sulfurized. A two-step heating temperature profile was employed in the process of sulfurization.15 The first step was maintained at 250 °C for 30 min and the second step was heated from 250 to 550 °C for 30 min at 5 °C min−1 up to the set temperature. The first step ensured the sufficient sulfurization because of a slow diffusion of S element at low temperature, while the second step allowed for complete crystallization at a high temperature. Compared with highly toxic H2S, this process of sulfurization is relatively safer and causes less pollution to the environment.


CdS deposition. 
For further deposition of CdS via the SILAR method,1c the CIS-coated TiO2 film was successively dipped into 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 in ethanol, rinsing ethanol, 0.05 M Na2S in methanol, and rinsing methanol. The dipping time in the Cd2+ and S2− solutions was 30 s for each and repeated for 10 SILAR cycles.


ZnS post-treatment. 
After the deposition of CdS, the photoelectrodes were coated with ZnS by alternately dipping them two times in 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 and 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solutions for 1 min for each dipping.2b

2.2. Characterization
The surface morphology, microstructure, and layer thickness of the as-synthesized samples were investigated using a FEI Sirion 200 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Cross-sectional thickness measurements were carried out directly on mechanically cracked samples. Crystal structures of the as-synthesized samples were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips diffractometer (X'pert Pro) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å).
The current density vs. applied voltage (I–V) characteristics of the samples were studied in a two-electrode cell equipped with a quartz window, using a platinum sheet as the counter electrode and the samples as the working electrodes. LEDs of monochromatic light (504 and 625 nm) were used as the illumination light source. An aqueous electrolyte solution of 0.24 M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH = 11.5) served as the sacrificial reagent to maintain the stability of the sulfide semiconductors. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were carried out on IM6ex (Zahner, Germany) in a standard three-electrode configuration with a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode in the same electrolyte as the I–V measurements. An electrochemical workstation with Z-view software was employed to analyze the impedance spectra.
The photovoltaic characteristics of the solar cells were also measured by using a solar simulator (Oriel 3A) at one sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed on Q-Test station 1000 AD (Crown TECH, USA). The configuration of the photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) remained fairly stable in the aqueous sulfide/sulfite electrolyte solution after a long period of measurements in the dark and under a monochromatic illumination with an LED or a solar simulator.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Evolution of XRD patterns of CIS and the morphology

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of a series of samples in the process of growth of CIS onto various substrates. CIS was prepared on the substrates of FTO and TiO2 films, respectively. According to Fig. 1(a) and (b), a pure CuInS2 phase (JCPDS no. 82-1702) was obtained on the substrate of FTO. In2O3 peaks and CuxS secondary phase did not appear after sulfurization. Fig. 1(c) and (d) indicate that the as-grown films were amorphous before sulfurization except for TiO2 and SnO2 peaks. After sulfurization, Fig. 1(e) reveals that the pure CIS phase on the substrate of TiO2 was also formed. The main orientations of (112), (200), and (204) could be attributed to the chalcopyrite phase CuInS2 (JCPDS card no. 82-1702). No characteristic peaks of impurity phases (such as In2O3 and CuxS) are observed after sulfurization. Compared with vacuum sulfurization, this procedure is more convenient and facile to implement the sensitization of TiO2 photoelectrodes with pure CIS.

The pores of TiO2 mesoporous films can be filled with CIS particles after the heat treatment as shown in the SEM images (Fig. 2). Fig. 2(a) shows the commercial P25 particles with an average diameter of 20 nm. Fig. S1(a)–(c)† show photographs of samples of 1–3 coating cycles after drying in air before sulfurization. The pores of TiO2 mesoporous film were partially filled with CIS particles with 1 and 2 coating cycles after the heat treatment (see Fig. S2†). When TiO2 particles are covered by CIS, the surface seems to be smoother and in the meanwhile the grains become bigger. The pores have been completely filled with a CIS layer with 3 coating cycles after sulfurization according to Fig. 2(b). This indicates a high coverage of the TiO2 surface by a CIS layer. The inset in Fig. 2(b) shows the fracture surface of TiO2 and CIS layers, implying that the TiO2 electrodes were effectively sensitized by a CIS layer. However, in Fig. 2(b) there are severe cracks observed in the surface due to heat treatment. The cracks can act as leakage centers that limit the photovoltaic performance. When the coating was up to 6 cycles, a CIS layer with an average thickness of 300 nm was obtained (inset in Fig. 2(c)). Obviously, with an increase of coating cycles, the grain size becomes larger and a high coverage degree of the TiO2 surface is displayed.

All samples displayed a fine absorption of UV-visible light from 400 to 800 nm as shown in Fig. 3(a). Apparently, the absorption of visible light from 500 to 800 nm with a raised shoulder was attributed to CIS with a bandgap of 1.5 eV.3b The more the coating cycles, the more the visible light absorbed. It was found that the TiO2 particles also played a role of light-scattering layer, enhancing the light absorption.1c,16 CIS is a well-known direct bandgap semiconductor with strong light absorption,3 and the bandgap can be determined by plotting (αhν)2vs. photon energy (hν), where α, h, and ν represent the absorption coefficient, the Planck's constant, and the photon frequency, respectively. Calculated from Fig. 3(a), the bandgap of CIS was in the range of 1.56–1.58 eV as shown in Fig. 3(b).

3.2. 
          I–V analysis

Fig. 4 shows the characteristics of the photocurrent density versus potential (I–V plots) for photoelectrodes of different configurations. The I–V plots were recorded in the dark and after irradiation with a monochromatic light from a 504 nm LED. The light power intensity was 100 W m−2 (10 mW cm−2). Fig. 4(a) shows I–V curves of the TiO2/ZnS/CIS electrodes with a thickness of 5 μm and Fig. 4(b) shows the enlargement of photovoltaic I–V plots in the second quadrant in Fig. 4(a). It was found that the photocurrent was low and the dark I–V plots deviated from the origin. Without the ZnS layer, the photocurrent is even weaker (data not shown here). A similar phenomenon was observed for the 11 μm sample (see Fig. S3†). In our case, the severe cracks of the samples as shown in SEM images are the main reason for the low current. The cracks in the photoelectrodes could result in big shunt currents.

The dark currents in (c)and (d) are on the basis of the TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS electrodes. 
The photocurrents and photovoltages were significantly improved after the photoelectrodes were modified by a CdS shell as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). The modification also removed the possible built-in dipole layer in TiO2/ZnS/CIS as revealed by the disappearance of the zero-voltage offset as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Comparatively, a ZnS coating was also applied to the TiO2/ZnS/CIS electrodes, however, only slight photocurrent enhancement was detected as a result of the post-ZnS treatment in agreement with the previous research in which it was reported that ZnS coating on TiO2/CIS quantum dot electrodes contributed little to the photocurrent.1c In addition, the ZnS treatment could not remove the built-in dipole (see Fig. S4†). It is striking that a significant increase in photocurrent was observed in Fig. 4(c) and (d) with the ZnS coating following the CdS shell. Therefore, the effect of CdS and ZnS on the photoresponse of the electrodes is different. The reason for the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance and the roles of CdS and ZnS will be discussed later.
Both CIS (1.5 eV) and CdS (2.4 eV) can absorb the 504 nm (ca. 2.5 eV) monochromatic light and make contribution to the photocurrent. For comparison, a 625 nm (ca. 2.0 eV) LED served as light source, and for this wavelength the CdS coating has no significant contribution to the overall absorbance. Fig. 5 exhibits the 5 μm sample irradiated under the 504 nm and 625 nm LED at the same light power intensity of 100 W m−2, respectively. Under the illumination with a 625 nm LED, the photocurrent falls gently compared with a 504 nm LED. A similar observation was obtained for the 11 μm sample (Fig. S5†). Consequently, the main role of CdS coating is the modification of the interface structure, instead of enhancing the light absorption.

Photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements in a two-electrode configuration were conducted for samples TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS and TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS/ZnS. Fig. 6 shows the IPCE spectra of TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS electrodes of 5 μm and 11 μm samples before and after the ZnS post-treatment. The inset in Fig. 6(a) shows the absorption spectra of the samples. As observed, the IPCE spectra correspond well with the visible absorption spectra. Without a ZnS coating, Fig. 6(a) indicates that the IPCE is still low although the TiO2/ZnS/CIS electrodes have already been modified by CdS. With the ZnS coating, recombination was alleviated and IPCE was dramatically improved. Since the bandgap of ZnS (3.8 eV) is much larger than those of CIS and CdS, the ZnS coating acts not only as a physical barrier at the electrode–electrolyte interface, but also as a potential barrier for electron back flow.7b,9,17

Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the photovoltaic response of the photoelectrodes under the monochromatic irradiation of 10 mW cm−2 with a 504 nm LED (data extracted from Fig. 4(c) and (d)). Compared to the photoelectrodes without the ZnS coating, the short circuit current density (Jsc) and the open circuit voltage (Voc) for the electrodes with the ZnS coating increased dramatically. The increase in Jsc, Voc, and the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) are summarized in Table 1. However, the fill factor (FF) still remains low (24–34%). For all samples, photovoltaic properties are successively improved by a CdS shell and a ZnS coating. The obtained highest monochromatic photovoltaic conversion efficiency for the 5 μm sample is 0.26% and for the 11 μm sample is 0.15%. With the help of the ZnS post-treatment, more than a 100% increase in the photovoltaic conversion efficiency was achieved with respect to all samples. The low FFs are attributed to the shunting losses in the system.7b In other words, the increase in photovoltaic conversion efficiency and photocurrent suggests that the shunting losses in the samples were greatly alleviated.

3.3. Working mechanism of the photoelectrodes in the electrolyte
TiO2 electrodes were modified with a sequence of ZnS, CIS, CdS and ZnS. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the successive treatment on TiO2 electrodes. The effect of the TiO2 compact layer can be proved by the EIS data and cyclic voltammetry (see Fig. S6†). The I–V characteristics in Fig. 4 have proved the positive effect on the significant enhancement of the photocurrents by a CdS shell and a ZnS coating layer. However, the enhancement mechanism is different for CdS and ZnS.
 Fig. 8  Schematic configuration of the photoelectrode (a) and the band diagram of the photoelectrode (b). 
The ZnS pre-treatment is used to passivate the surface states of TiO2 and block the oxide surface in order to suppress the recombination at the interface of the oxide and CIS (see Fig. S7†).9 The CdS layer plays a critical role in the increase of the photocurrents according to the I–V characteristics (Fig. 4). First, through filling in a CdS layer, the severe cracks were alleviated and the connections of the grains were improved. Therefore, the shunt currents are dramatically suppressed. Second, the CdS coating can provide a better coverage of the surface of CIS and result in significant enhancement of the photocurrents. It means that the CdS layer can also passivate the CIS layer and prevent the interfacial recombination. Energy level diagrams of TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS/ZnS electrodes are summarized in Fig. 8(b). The band positions are determined according to the previous values.1c,d,18 Under the disturbance in the incident light, the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of CIS are flowing into the conduction band of TiO2 while the photo-generated holes (h+) in the valence band of the CIS can be effectively extracted to the high concentration of hole scavengers, S2−/SO32−, in the solution. Moreover, the second ZnS layer with a large bandgap at the electrode/electrolyte solution interface can prevent the back recombination of the injected electrons. Hence, a stepwise conduction band edge limits the flux of electrons and reduces the recombination, leading to the enhancement of the performance.
The conduction and valence band edges of the semiconductor can be estimated through cyclic voltammetry (CV).19 The electron transfer is mediated through the conduction band edge, which is manifested as cathodic peaks in the cyclic voltammograms (CVs).19Fig. 9(a)–(c) show the CVs recorded for TiO2, TiO2/ZnS/CIS, and TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS electrodes, respectively. The cathodic peaks (conduction band edges) of TiO2 (marked as C-TiO2), CIS (marked as C-CIS), and CdS (marked as C2-CdS) are at ca. −0.74 V, −0.85 V, and −1.15 V vs. SHE (Standard Hydrogen Electrode, 4.5 eV below the vacuum level as shown in Fig. 8(b), Ag/AgCl vs. SHE = 0.197 V, 298 K), respectively. Combining with the reported energy band diagram shown in Fig. 8(b), these values are wholly higher ca. 0.45 eV than the reported positions of conduction band vs. vacuum level, indicating the conduction band edges of the TiO2, CIS, and CdS with a total negative shift of 0.45 eV, which is likely originated from the adsorption of S2−/SO32− on the surface of the electrodes (see Table S1†). Fig. 9(d) depicts the potential differences of −0.11 V between TiO2 and CIS, and −0.30 V between CIS and CdS. It indicates that the conduction band edge of CIS is 0.1 eV higher than TiO2 and that of CdS is 0.3 eV higher than CIS, which matches well the reported energy band differences among TiO2, CIS and CdS shown in Fig. 8(b). The CV results are in accordance with band structures and prove that the process of electron transfer is through an inter-conduction band transfer, which suggests that a stepwise conduction band edge was constructed in the TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS electrodes in agreement with the band diagram in Fig. 8(b). In the sulfide/sulfite solution (pH = 11.5), the position of the hydrogen evolution potential also displays a negative shift of 0.68 V than SHE following the Nernst' equation, represented by the dotted line (Reversible Hydrogen electrode (RHE)) (see ESI†).

3.4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
The I–V characteristics in Fig. 4 demonstrated the significant influence on the enhancement of photocurrent through a successive deposition of CdS and ZnS layers. As shown in Fig. 10, the enhancement of photocurrent and conversion efficiency can also be understood from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 10(a) shows the Nyquist plots of the electrodes obtained from EIS data at −0.3 V while charge transfer resistance from the photoelectrodes to redox species in the electrolyte (Rct) was calculated by fitting the semi-arc in the low frequency region as shown in Fig. 10(b). The high frequency semi-arc is related to the charge transport through the photoelectrodes or processes at the counter electrode similar to those in conventional dye-sensitized solar cells.10,13,20 The series resistances (Rs) including the contribution from the photoelectrodes, the counter electrode, and the electrolyte were obtained by fitting the semi-arc in the high frequency region. From Fig. 10(a), the values of the Rs for TiO2/ZnS/CIS, TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS, and TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS/ZnS electrodes are 18 Ω cm2, 47 Ω cm2, and 104 Ω cm2, respectively. The increase in Rs agrees with the incorporation of the CdS shell and the ZnS coating layer. Compared to the photoelectrodes without the CdS coating, the values of Rct for the electrodes with the CdS coating dramatically increased for each corresponding potential. The increase in Rct indicates that the recombination losses are suppressed in the system, which leads to the enhancement of the photocurrents in Fig. 4(c) and (d). However, the values of the Rct are reduced when a ZnS layer was coated on the surface of the TiO2/ZnS/CIS/CdS electrodes. The decrease in Rct implies that this ZnS layer plays the role of an insulating interfacial layer as in conventional metal–insulator–semiconductor (MIS) solar cells, rather than a simple passivation of the electrode, because of the large bandgap of ZnS.21 The decrease in Rct could be ascribed to the reorganization of the electric field and potential distribution, which generally decreased the electric field in the depletion layer and the dark current (additional EIS data, see Fig. S8†).
 Fig. 10  Nyquist plots of the 11 μm sample obtained from a semi-arc in the low frequency region at an applied potential of −0.3 V vs. a Pt sheet counter electrode (a) and a series of values of Rct of the 11 μm sample at an applied potential from −0.5 V to +0.5 V were calculated by fitting the EIS data from a semi-arc in the low frequency region (b). 
4. Conclusions
In summary, the CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes were prepared by a facile method. The TiO2/CIS electrode displayed a substantial enhancement of the photovoltaic response through a successive coating with a CdS layer and a ZnS layer via the SILAR method. The best photovoltaic conversion efficiency (η) is up to 0.26% under a monochromatic illumination of 10 mW cm−2 and 0.12% under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5. In our case, the effect of a CdS shell and a ZnS coating on the improvement of the photovoltaic properties is different. Further work needs to be carried out to overcome the cracks and reduce the recombination.
