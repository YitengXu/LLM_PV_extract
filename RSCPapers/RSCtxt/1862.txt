P1 consists of a porphyrin ring linked by two ethylrhodanine end caps via phenylene ethynylene bridges. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells using P1 as the donor exhibit significantly improved performances under indoor illumination compared to 1 sun conditions. For P1:PC71BM cells, an optimized-PCE of 19.2% was achieved under a 300 lux illumination of a 3000 K LED tube. Besides high PCEs, the porphyrin-based devices also exhibit enhanced OPV performances in thick film regions (∼200 nm) compared to a control BHJ cell using PCDTBT:PC71BM. The thick-film P1-based device shows an overall PCE of 18.2%. The origins of the thickness independent OPV performances were examined, and they can be attributed to the low electronic disorders of these materials when compared to their polymer counterparts.
1. Introduction
Auxiliary electronic components, such as antenna modules and remote-control units, are usually charged by dry batteries, which inevitably cause material wastage and environmental pollution.1,2 Indoor organic photovoltaic (OPV) harvesters, as newly developed alternatives to charge these devices, have attracted growing attention.3 Due to better spectral overlaps between the absorption spectra of OPV materials and the emission spectra of indoor light sources (e.g. LED and fluorescence), OPV cells may possess much higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) under room light illumination.4–6 This realization has led to the recent surge for identification of suitable materials for indoor light harvesting devices. PCDTBT, a widely studied polymer donor, has recently emerged as a promising material to fabricate organic room-light harvesters due to the high Voc of OPV devices and desirable optical absorption in the visible region, although the device performance of PCDTBT-based cells under standard 1 sun illumination falls behind other high-performance state-of-the-art materials in the OPV field. Lee et al. fabricated PTB7:PC71BM, PCDTBT:PC71BM, and P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells, and re-ranked their OPV performances under indoor and 1 sun illuminations.7 Under fluorescent lamp illumination, the PCDTBT:PC71BM cell achieves a leading PCE of 16.6%. Instead of the standard 1 sun illumination, indoor light sources display different emission spectra, and therefore, such optical characteristics affect the OPV performance of indoor light harvesters. Lechêne et al. compared the OPV performance of PCDTBT:PC71BM cells under incandescent, CFL and LED illuminations.8 Yin et al. demonstrated how to convert incident illumination into input power intensity, and a record high PCE of 20.8% of the PCDTBT:PC71BM cell was achieved by a ternary strategy with a third polymer component, PDTSTPD.9 More recently, Lee et al. optimized solution processable small molecule-based BTR:PC71BM bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and achieved a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 28% under fluorescent illimination, with a maximum power density of 78.2 μW cm−2.10
For organic BHJs used as indoor light harvesters, a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) and a low charge carrier recombination rate are the two main criteria for high device performance.9 The Voc of OPV cells can be expressed as (1)where n is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, Iph is the photocurrent, and I0 is the dark current.11 From eqn (1), there are two main observations: (1) an OPV device with a small dark current gives rise to a large Voc. This can be achieved by choosing materials with larger energy gaps. (2) Since Iph ≫ I0, Voc ∼ ln(Iph), OPV cells will have a reduced Voc under room light because of the reduced Iph. The loss of Voc (ΔVoc) can be expressed by (2)where Psun and Proom are the incident powers from 1 sun and room light, respectively, and θ is the fraction of light without infrared radiation.9 ΔV depends only on the ratios of photocurrents, and it is independent of the choice of materials. Therefore, to achieve a large Voc under ambient light, a BHJ that gives a large Voc under 1 sun is essential.11,12 These considerations lead us to seek emerging organic PV materials that have large PCEs and also high Voc values under 1 sun but have not been considered for room light harvesting materials.
Porphyrins, as extensively-studied heterocyclic macrocycle organic compounds, have shown enough potential for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells due to a few novel properties, including low Voc losses and suppressed carrier recombination rates.13–15 Among the porphyrin-based materials, a group of donors with a symmetrical acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure can achieve a remarkable PCE exceeding 8%.16,17 However, few reports utilize porphyrin dye for room light harvesting. A recent example is to use porphyrins as a photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).18 Here, we focused on an A–D–A structural porphyrin-based donor material P1 and tested its OPV performances in BHJ solar cells consisting of P1:PC71BM under AM1.5G 1 sun illumination and LED tubes with various color temperatures (300 lux). The chemical structure of P1 is shown in Fig. 1. P1 was designed by constructing a porphyrin ring with an aliphatic side-chain as the periphery substituent and connecting two 3-ethylrhodanine units that are end-capped via phenylene ethynylene bridges. While porphyrin donors have broadened and high absorptivity from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region, their characteristic lower-lying HOMO energy level allows a high Voc of about 0.9 V with low energy losses.19–21 Additionally, the use of a long meso-alkyl chain as a 5,15-substituent can facilitate π-stacking in the solid state and the large planar π-conjugation macrocycles can provide high carrier mobility and efficient intermolecular charge transfer, resulting in a high fill factor (FF) and desirable solubility. To benchmark the performances of the porphyrin devices, we also made BHJ cells using PCDTBT:PC71BM (Fig. 1) and tested these cells under the same conditions. Under the 1 sun condition, both the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM cells achieve PCEs over 5%, and the results are consistent with other reported literature studies.22,23 In addition, their OPV performances improve significantly under indoor illumination. For the P1:PC71BM device, an optimized PCE of 19.2% was achieved under a 300 lux illumination of a 3000 K LED tube, and the control PCDTBT:PC71BM cell has a PCE of 18.2% under the same condition. Besides high PCEs, the porphyrin-based BHJ cells also exhibit superior performances and enhanced stabilities as thick films (∼200 nm). The origins of these superior properties were examined, and they can be attributed to the low electronic disorder of these materials when compared to their polymer counterparts.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. OPV performances of P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM devices

Fig. 2(a) shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the thin film (∼100 nm) and thick film (∼200 nm) P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ cells under 100 mW cm−2 of AM1.5G solar illumination. The donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio was fixed as 1:1.2, with 3 vol% pyridine in the casting solutions. The OPV parameters of the optimized cells in Fig. 2(a) are summarized in Table 1. Both the thin film P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM devices exhibit PCEs over 5%. However, OPV performances, especially PCEs and FFs, tend to degrade in thick film regions under the 1 sun illumination. PCEs of the thick-film (∼200 nm) P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM are 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. One possible reason for the performance degradation is the limited hole mobilities and charge recombination.24,25

The PCEs of the OPV devices improve significantly under the indoor illumination because of the mutual match of the emission spectra of indoor lamps and the organic film absorption.26,27 In this work, OPV cells are illuminated by standard T5 LED tubes with color temperatures of 3000 K, 4000 K, and 6500 K, and Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the emission spectra of the LED sources. The illumination level was set at 300 lux, which corresponds to common indoor light levels for offices. The illumination was achieved by adjusting the distance between the T5 tubes and the sample. At 300 lux, the incident optical energies are estimated to be between 74 and 81 μW cm−2.9Fig. 2(b) shows the J–V curves of the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM cells under such a 3000 K LED tube. Both the thin film cells exhibit enhanced PCEs of 19.2% and 18.7%, which are significantly larger than those under 1 sun illumination. However, the PCE of the thick-film (∼200 nm) control, namely the PCDTBT:PC71BM cell, degrades significantly to 13.2%. In contrast, the thick-film (∼200 nm) P1:PC71BM device still retains a high PCE of 18.4%. It is worth noting that the optimized P1 cell exhibits a higher Jsc under 1 sun illumination, whereas the optimized PCDTBT device achieves the leading Jsc under LED illumination. The optical absorption is the main cause for the differences of currents under various light sources. Fig. 2(c) shows the absorption coefficients of the optimized P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ cells as a function of optical wavelength. The porphyrin-based materials contribute an absorption in the near infrared region (∼650–800 nm), whereas PCDTBT films possess higher absorption coefficients in the wavelength region of 550–650 nm, which matches the LED emission spectrum shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). Fig. 2(d) shows the normalized EQE of the optimized P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ cells.

Fig. 3 shows the OPV parameters (FF and PCE) of the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM OPV devices as a function of BHJ thickness under the standard 1 sun and LED illuminations with various color temperatures (300 lux). There are two clear observations: (i) both P1 and PCDTBT cells acquire enhanced PCEs under room illumination compared to the standard 1 sun condition; (ii) solar cells achieve slightly higher power outputs and PCEs under LED tubes with lower color temperatures (i.e. 3000 K). Fig. 4 compares the thickness dependent FFs and PCEs of P1- and PCDTBT-based BHJ cells under a 300 lux illumination from a 3000 K LED tube. Under such an indoor illumination, the OPV parameters of the PCDTBT:PC71BM cells decrease gradually with an increase of the BHJ thickness, whereas the P1:PC71BM devices show almost thickness-independent performances. FFs are the main improvement in the thick-film P1:PC71BM cells under indoor illumination. In the thick-film region (150–200 nm), FFs of the P1-based devices are maintained at around 66-–68%, whereas the PCDTBT-based cells exhibit reduced FFs lower than 56% in the same region. The origins of the enhanced OPV performances of the P1:PC71BM cells in the thick-film region are discussed in Section 2.2.

Illumination stabilities of the OPV devices were also evaluated. Fig. 5 shows the OPV parameters (PCE, Jsc and FF) of P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM cells under 1 sun and 3000 K LED illuminations. The OPV cells were unencapsulated and exposed to ambient air. Both the small molecule-based and polymer-based OPV devices exhibit better device stabilities under the LED illumination. For the P1:PC71BM cell, the normalized PCE retains around 80% of its original value after being illuminated for 180 min, whereas the normalized PCE of the cell under 1 sun condition decreases to 69% at the same time. This result is comparable with the decay speed of PCDTBT:PC71BM cells shown in Fig. 5. For both P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ cells, the Jsc decay was slower under the indoor light source than under 1 sun illumination. Interestingly, LED illumination for a short time (<60 min) improves the Jsc of both small molecule and polymer-based OPV devices. OPV cells are susceptible to ambient water, oxygen, stress, and the exposure of light illumination, and therefore, the problem of stability limits their further industrial applications.28–30 The improved illumination stability under indoor light sources indicates the potential of the porphyrin-based OPV cells for room light harvesters.

2.2. Hole transport and energetic defects in P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films
To investigate the origins of the differences in device performance, hole mobilities of the BHJs were measured by SCLC. The structure of hole-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/CuPc:spiro-TPD/Au, and the layer of CuPc:spiro-TPD allows holes injection and transport to the Au electrode.31,32 Hole mobilities can be extracted by fitting the SCLC curve, which can be expressed as (3)where JSCL is the space-charge-limited current density, ε0 is the permittivity of a vacuum, εr is the relative dielectric constant, β is the Poole–Frenkel slope,33F is the applied electric field, and d is the BHJ film thickness. At room temperature, μh of the P1:PC71BM BHJ is 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, about one order larger than 1.9 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film. Temperature-dependent SCLC measurements were also performed to study the hole transport properties at different temperatures, and the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) was used to reveal the electronic states of hole transport. From the GDM analysis, the zero-field hole mobilities can be expressed as (4)where μ∞ is the high-temperature-limited mobility, σ is the energetic disorder, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the sample temperature.31Fig. 6(a) shows the hole mobilities of the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films as a function of temperature, and energetic disorders of hole transport are extracted from the slope of mobilities vs. temperatures. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the P1:PC71BM film achieves relatively higher hole mobilities and a reduced energetic disorder of holes (σh) at different temperatures compared to the PCDTBT-based film. The σh values of the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films are 85 meV and 114 meV, respectively. One possible explanation for the improved hole transport in the small molecule-based BHJ is that compared to the polymer PCDTBT, the P1 molecules tend to form J-aggregates with side-by-side assembly or H-aggregates with face-to-face stacking, which might suppress the energetic spreading of HOMO sites and increase hole mobilities.34–36 BHJ films with high hole mobilities and reduced energetic disorder (less energetic defects) are more favorable for fabricating thick film OPV cells.24,37–39 Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows nanostructures of the optimized P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films obtained from atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the P1:PC71BM film with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.4 nm shows better miscibility than the PCDTBT:PC71BM film with a RMS of 0.8 nm, which is favorable for charge carrier extraction and transport. As discussed in Section 2.1, under the 3000 K LED illumination, the P1 cells show thickness independent OPV performance, and high FFs above 66% can be still achieved when the BHJ thicknesses approach to 200 nm.
 Fig. 6  (a) Zero-field hole mobilities and (b) subgap optical absorption spectra derived from the PDS measurements of the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films. 
Photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) was performed to investigate the subgap energetic defects of the BHJ films. The mechanism of PDS is well documented elsewhere.33,40 For organic disordered materials, the optical absorption coefficient α near the bandgap can be expressed by the Urbach equation as41,42 (5)
In eqn (5), α0 is the absorption coefficient at the bandgap energy Eg; ν is the photon frequency, and Eu is the Urbach energy, which is a measure of the localized bandtail states near the band edges.40 A small Eu indicates a low density localized state and an ordered semiconductor. Fig. 6(b) shows the PDS-derived subgap absorption spectra of the P1:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films. For the P1:PC71BM BHJ, Eu = 35.8 meV, which is significantly less than 54.9 meV of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film, suggesting the BHJ of P1:PC71BM is a superior semiconductor in comparison to the BHJ of PCDTBT:PC71BM. Furthermore, in the subgap region (1.0–1.3 eV), compared to the polymer-based BHJ, the porphyrin-based P1:PC71BM film has relatively lower absorption coefficients, indicating that the BHJ film has fewer subgap defect states, which act as traps. Therefore, enhanced OPV performances are achieved in the P1:PC71BM cells, especially in the thick-film region.
Finally, we want to highlight that porphyrin-based P1:PC71BM OPV devices have large Vocs and corresponding high PCEs under indoor illumination. As described in eqn (2), ΔV, which is the Voc loss from 1 sun to room light, should be independent of the choice of materials. Therefore, we re-write eqn (2) and express Voc under room illuminations as (6)
To test eqn (6), we made different BHJs using commercially available polymer donors, including P3HT, PTB7, PTB7-Th and PBDB-T, and tested their Vocs under 1 sun and 300 lux. Fig. 7 summarizes the Vocs of their BHJs along with the P1:PC71BM BHJ. It can be seen that Voc,room follows eqn (6) very well for different BHJs with a linear trend in Fig. 7. The offset between the data and the dashed line is the Voc loss and is nearly a constant with the value of 0.17 V as predicted by eqn (2) assuming θ = 56.7%.9 Among the BHJ systems in Fig. 7, the porphyrin-based cell achieves a highest Voc of ∼0.76 V, as indicated by the “star” symbol. Under a 300 lux LED illumination, Proom ≈ 80 μW cm−2, and a computed Voc loss ΔV is around 0.166 V, which is comparable to the experimental values. We therefore conclude that porphyrin-based donor small molecules are potential candidates for the fabrication of high performance BHJ solar cells for indoor applications due to their large Vocs under 1 sun illumination.

3. Conclusions
A porphyrin-based donor material, P1, with a structure of a porphyrin ring linked by two ethylrhodanine end caps via phenylene ethynylene bridges, was used in a BHJ cell for room light harvesting. For the P1:PC71BM device, an optimized PCE of 19.2% was achieved under a 300 lux illumination from a 3000 K LED tube, and the polymer counterpart PCDTBT:PC71BM cell has a PCE of 18.2% under the same condition. The thick-film (∼200 nm) P1:PC71BM cell shows a comparable slightly reduced PCE of 18.4%, whereas the OPV performance of the thick-film PCDTBT:PC71BM cells decreases to 13.2%. Illumination stability was also tested. The P1:PC71BM cells show comparable illumination stability with the PCDTBT:PC71BM devices. To reveal the origins of the improved OPV performance in the thick-film region of the P1:PC71BM BHJ cells, SCLC and PDS were performed to evaluate the hole transport properties and energetic defects of the BHJ films, and the results indicate that compared to the PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ, the P1:PC71BM film achieves improved hole mobilities and reduced energetic defects.
4. Experimental details
The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/LiF/Al. A glass substrate with pre-patterned ITO was ultrasonicated subsequently in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The substrates were dried in a fume cupboard and then cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 13 min. A 30 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the substrates at 7000 rpm for 60 s in ambient air, which were then baked on a hot plate at 140 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen filled glove box. A blend film of the porphyrin-based small molecule:PC71BM (1:1.2, w/w) was prepared by spin-coating its mixed solution in CB/pyridine (100:3, v/v) (total concentration: 22 mg mL−1) at 1050 rpm for 60 s. A thin layer (1 nm) of LiF and Al cathode (130 nm) were deposited by using thermal evaporation in a high vacuum chamber (∼10−6 mbar). The optimal thickness of the active layer was typically 80–90 nm, which was measured using a Dektak profilometer. The device area was exactly fixed at 0.1089 cm2. The J–V characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measurement system, and a solar simulator (XES-70S1, SAN EI Co., Ltd.) was used as the light source.
