    , Accepted 1st June 2011First published on 18th July 2011AbstractThe irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) light usually induces the photodegradation of organic photovoltaic materials, leading to the significant degeneration of organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells. In view of this, we designed UV to visible photo-conversion YVO4: Eu3+, Bi3+ nano-films for the first time. These nano-films could not only filter out the harmful UV light to improve the lifetime of OPV, but also enhanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this paper, we present the preparation, structure and excellent photoconversion properties of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) microsized powders and the nano-film converters fabricated by laser ablation. Furthermore, the photo-stability of P3HT film with the converter was investigated. It is exciting to observe that the degradation of P3HT thin-film can be effectively retarded with the converter, about 3 fold compared to that of the glass reference. The photoconverter from UV to visible has the potential to be practically used in future OPV solar cells devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells have attracted substantial research interest because of their advantages of low cost, large-area fabrication and flexibility.1–5 In particular the optimization of processing parameters and the synthesis of “tailor-made” conjugated polymers have led to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE), with PCE values of over 8% being published recently.6 However, there are still a few challenges such as efficiency, lifetime and cost that OPV need to overcome before they can become the mainstream solar technology, especially for the lifetime of OPV solar cells.7–9 The UV irradiation induced photodegradation of organic photovoltaic materials in the existence of water and oxide is a key factor leading to the lifetime degeneration of OPV devices. Recently, photoconversion used for solar cells has aroused much attention, for instance, rare earth oxide phosphors have been used to improve the PCE of silicon solar cells.10–12 However, the application of photoconversion in OPV devices has not been reported. For silicon-based solar cells, because their optical adsorption ranges are relatively wide, the energy converted by the photo-conversion layer is low relative to the total energy that can be efficiently used. And, the presence of a photo-conversion layer affects the transmission of the effective light to some extent, so the actual effect is not significant.13 For OPV devices, the absorption bands of the organic photovoltaic materials are usually narrower than those of silicon-based solar cells, so the energy converted by the photo-conversion layer can account for a larger proportion of the effective solar energy, and the increase in efficiency will be more apparent.14,15 In order to improve the photostability of OPV devices, some groups used a UV-filter layer to reduce the UV irradiation,15 but this reduces the efficiency of OPV to some extent. For instance, Jin Jiang’s group used UV-filters formed by a solution-type material in OPV and to greatly improve its photostability, however, the initial PCE was reduced from 4.2% to 3.6%.14 In view of this, we designed a UV to visible nano-films converter for OPV use, which could not only filter off the harmful UV light, but could also convert it into the effective visible range, improving photo-stability16 and efficiency of OPV at the same time. We fabricated YVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ nano-film as the converter, because YVO4:Eu3+ has a high absorption coefficient in the 220–350 nm UV range and high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (∼95%).17 By introducing Bi3+ ions, the excitation bands can be further extended to ∼400 nm, which almost covers the whole UV region of sunlight.
Herein, we present the preparation of efficient Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu, xBi (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) micro-sized powders, tuning of photo-conversion properties of Eu3+, optical properties of photoconversion nano-films prepared by laser ablation and the application used in improving the photo-stability of P3HT, which is a very effective p-type organic semiconductor polymer, in OPV solar cells.2,4,7–9 It is important to observe that the photostability of P3HT with the photo-converter was considerably increased. The present nano-film converter could be further used for improving the lifetime and efficiency of OPV solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials

          Yttrium oxide (Y2O3) and europium oxide (Eu2O3) were obtained from the National Engineering Research Centre of Rare Earth Metallurgy and Function Materials (Baotou, P. R. China). Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) were obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, P. R. China). And regioregular (>95%) poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with a molecular weight of about 50–60 k were obtained from Luminescence Technology Corp. in Taiwan. The solvent chloroform was purchased from Beijing Chemical Plant (Beijing, P. R. China). All chemicals were used as received.
2.2. Preparation

2.2.1. Synthesis of YVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ red phosphor. 
For preparing co-doped YVO4 powders, Y2O3, Eu2O3, NH4VO3, and Bi2O3 powders were used as starting materials. All the Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) phosphors were prepared by solid state reaction.18 First, we weighted the starting materials according to the stoichiometric ratio of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ and mixed them together, then they were grinded in a mortar for one hour until fully mixed. Secondly, the samples were sealed in crucibles and loaded into a laboratory box furnace. The furnace was heated to 900 °C for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, all the samples were collected and marked.


2.2.2. Preparation of YVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+ nano-films. 
Once the powders were prepared, we used laser ablation to prepare photoconversion of thin films.19 The laser ablation target was fabricated from powders of Y0.92VO4:0.03Eu3+, 0.05Bi3+. In order to obtain a dense target, the Y0.92VO4:0.03Eu3+, 0.05Bi3+ pellet was sintered at 1400 °C for 4 h. We selected three ordinary glasses of the same sizes (3 cm × 2 cm × 1 mm) for the substrates. The substrates were flat and had been previously degreased and cleaned by a standard cleaning process based on deionized water and hydrogen peroxide solution. Laser ablation was performed by KrF-excimer laser radiation at ∼355 nm, pulse duration of 25 ns, a repetition rate of 10 Hz, pulse energy of 50 mJ and fluence of 2 J cm−2 focused at the target. In order to obtain homogenous ablation, the targets were rotated and the laser focus was moved across the target. The substrate-to-target distance was 2.0 cm. Samples were deposited using the pressure in a vacuum chamber 170 Mpa. By changing the deposition time, 10, 20 and 30 min, three thin-films of different thicknesses were obtained. After deposition, the thin-films were annealed for 3 h at 500 °C.


2.2.3. Preparation of P3HT thin-film. 
Regioregular P3HT thin-films were prepared in air by spin-coating.20 First, a given amount of P3HT was added to chloroform and stirred for hours in the dark until it was fully dissolved. Then, uniform P3HT thin-films were prepared by spin-coating with a rotating speed of 3000 rpm and dried in the dark.


2.2.4. Characterization. 
The phase structure and purity of the as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) with a Rigaku D/max 2550 X-ray diffractometer, using a monochromatized Cu target radiation resource (λ = 1.54 Å). The excitation and emission spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer. The luminescent dynamics were pumped by a laser-system consisting of a Nd:YAG pumping laser (1064 nm), a third-order Harmonic-Generator (355 nm) and a tunable optical parameter oscillator (OPO, Continuum Precision II 8000) with a pulse duration of 10 ns, repetition frequency of 10 Hz and line width of 4–7 cm−1. The surface morphology of the as-prepared products were measured with a JEOL JSM-7500 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The thickness of the photo-conversion thin-films was characterized by ellipsometry. The absorption and transmission spectra of the resulting samples were measured with a UV-1800 UV-visible spectrometer. The luminescent quantum efficiency of the powder samples and the films was measured with a FluroSense spectrophotometer equipped with a BaSO4 integrated sphere. The 320 nm light separated from an internal Xenon lamp was used as excitation source.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and luminescent properties of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+,xBi3+ powders
First of all, the structures of the samples with different Bi3+ doping concentrations were investigated. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) phosphor products. It can be seen that the samples (a–f) are exactly in agreement with the corresponding standard cards, JCPDS 17–0341 for tetragonal YVO4. No impurity peak appears, implying that the samples (a–f) are all in pure tetragonal phase. When the Bi3+ doping concentration equals 0.4, some impurity peaks can be seen (Fig. 1g). The most obvious impurity peak is at 28.90 degree, which is in agreement with the corresponding standard cards JCPDS 48–0744 for tetragonal BiVO4. Inset Fig. 1 shows that the peaks of as-prepared powders have a gradual shift to the lower degree with the increase of Bi3+doping concentration, implying lattice expansion of YVO4 when the atoms Y in the lattices are gradually substituted by Bi, which has a bigger radius.21 From the analysis of XRD patterns, we conclude that the Bi3+ ions have been effectively doped into the YVO4 host lattices.

The inset is the partial magnification peaks of the as-prepared samples. 
To obtain the optimum samples suitable for photo-conversion, we characterized the photoluminescent properties of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) powder phosphors. Fig. 2 shows the excitation and emission spectra of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4). In Fig. 2a, the broad excitation bands ranging from 220–350 nm, and peaking at ∼320 nm, appear corresponding to the charge transfer from excited ligands to the central vanadium atom inside VO43−groups. The mechanism of this energy transfer (ET) is well-known as the subject of some investigations.17 In Fig. 2b–e, besides the excitation bands of VO43−groups, a novel excitation band peaking at 340 nm appears, which is assigned to the 6s2–6s6p transition of Bi3+, followed by energy transfer to Eu3+. This leads the excitation bands of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ to become broader than those of Y0.97VO4:0.03Eu3+ about ∼50 nm on the red side.18,22 In the excitation spectra the weak lines at ∼395 nm corresponding to the 7F0–5L6 transitions within the 4f6 configuration of the Eu3+ ions are observed. It is interesting to observe that the intensity becomes weak with increasing Bi3+ concentration. This is mainly attributed to the back energy transfer from Eu3+ to Bi3+, which is proved in the following text. As expected, continuous excitation bands ranging of 220–400 nm are successfully obtained in Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+ through introducing extra Bi3+ ions. In the emission spectra of Fig. 2, the green emissions of 5D1–7F1 and the red 5D0–7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions of Eu3+ are all observed, as labeled in the figure. Besides, there are broad band emissions ranging of 500–700 nm in the Bi3+ ions co-doped powder samples. They come from the 6s6p–6s2 transitions of Bi3+ ions, which have also been observed.18,22 The intensity of the broad band emissions gradually decreases and almost disappears when the concentration of Bi3+ varies from 0.05 to 0.4, a result of the well-known concentration quenching effect.22
 Fig. 2  Normalized excitation (λem = 621 nm) and emission (λex = 340 nm) spectra of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ powders with different Bi doping concentration: (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.05, (c) x = 0.10, (d) x = 0.20, (e) x = 0.40. 

Fig. 3 shows the integral emission intensity of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) as well as the quantum efficiency as a function of Bi3+doping concentration. It can be seen that the integral emission intensity increases when the doping concentration of Bi3+ increases form 0.02 to 0.05, and approaches at an optimum at 0.05, then decreases when the doping concentration of Bi3+ increases continuously. As for the quantum efficiency, it nearly reserves as a constant as the Bi3+ doping concentration varies from 0.02 to 0.05. As the doping concentration of Bi3+ increases further, it decreases quickly and solely. Considering the integral emission intensity and quantum efficiency, we choose the Y0.92VO4:0.03Eu3+, 0.05Bi3+ as the starting material for preparing photo-conversion thin-films.
 Fig. 3  Room-temperature luminescent integral intensity (λex = 340 nm) and quantum efficiency (λex = 320 nm) of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) powders. 
In order to further comprehend the luminescent behavior of Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4), the luminescent dynamics with different Bi3+ concentrations were also studied. Fig. 4 shows the room temperature decay dynamics monitoring the 5D0–7F2 transitions at 621 nm in different YVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ samples. As can be seen, the emissions at 621 nm all demonstrate bi-exponential decay functions, which can be written as,23 I(t) = I1(0) exp (−t/τ1) + I2(0)exp(−t/τ2),(1)where I(t) presents the intensity at any time, I1(0) and I2(0) present the intensity constants as t = 0, and τ1 and τ2 present the faster and slower decay time constants, respectively. The faster time constants are in the order of several microseconds, while slower time constants are in the order of several hundreds microseconds. By comparing the luminescent dynamics of the broad emissions of Bi3+ at the other wavelengths, it can be concluded that the faster decay processes correspond to the decay of 6s6p to 6s2 transitions of Bi3+, while the slower decay processes to the 5D0–7F2 emission of Eu3+.24
 Fig. 4  Room-temperature luminescent dynamics of 5D0–7F2 transitions in Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) powders (λex = 340nm, λem = 621 nm). 

Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the faster decay time constant for the broad band emissions of Bi3+, and the slower decay time constant for 5D0–7F2 transitions of Eu3+ on Bi3+ concentration. It can be observed that as the Bi3+ concentration varies from 0.02 to 0.40, the faster decay time constant for the broad band emissions of Bi3+ quickly decreases from 12.6 to 4 μs. As the Bi3+ ions increase, the average distance between any two Bi3+ ions decreases, leading to energy transfer between Bi3+ ions. The energy transfer rate increases with the increase of Bi3+ concentration, leading to the decrease of decay time constant. It is very interesting to observe that as the Bi3+ concentration varies from 0.02 to 0.40, the longer decay time constant for the 5D0–7F2 transitions of Eu3+ also gradually decreases to some extent. As the concentration of Bi3+ increases, the energy transfer rate between any two nearby Bi3+ and Eu3+ ions should also increase. However, the energy transfer rate from Bi3+ to Eu3+ should be much faster than the total transition rate of Σ5D0–7FJ, so it would have rare effect on the decay time constant of 5D0–7FJ for Eu3+. We assume that the reverse energy transfer from excited states of Eu3+ (including 5D0) to Bi3+ happens, leading to the variation of 5D0–7F2 decay time constants.

In order to prove the existence of the reverse energy transfer processes from excited states of Eu3+ to Bi3+, the time-resolved emissions (delay time: 5 μs) under the excitation of 340, 395, 464, 526 and 578 nm, were measured, as shown in Fig. 6. They correspond to the excitation band of Bi3+, 7F0–5L6, 5D2, 5D1 and 5D0 excitation lines of Eu3+, respectively. It can be observed that the broad band emissions originating from Bi3+ not only correspond to the excitation band of Bi3+, but also correspond to the 7F0–5L6, 5D2, 5D1 and 5D0 excitation lines of Eu3+. This provides powerful evidence of reverse energy transfer from Eu3+ to Bi3+ at different excited states. It is not difficult to understand why the reverse energy transfer rate from 5D0 of Eu3+ increases with the increase of Bi3+ concentration, and which leads to a decrease in the decay time constant of 5D0–7FJ transitions.

3.2. 
          YVO4:Eu3+,Bi3+UV to visible photo-conversion thin-films
The Y0.92VO4:0.03Eu3+, 0.05Bi3+was chosen as the starting material for preparing nano-film converters. The three converter thin-films on glass substrates were prepared by laser ablation, corresponding to the deposition time of 10, 20 and 30 min. The thicknesses determined by a Spectroscopic Ellipsometer, were found to be 23, 35 and 60 nm, respectively. Fig. 7a shows the field-emission SEM image of the 35 nm thin-film on the glass substrate, which demonstrates that the film is very dense and smooth. Fig. 7b displays the XRD patterns of the three nano-films on the glass substrates. In the three samples, broad XRD patterns ranging of 10°–40° can be all observed; which should come from the glass substrates. In the 35 nm and 60 nm samples, the sharp XRD peaks corresponding to the strongest (200) planes of the tetragonal YVO4 can be clearly distinguished, implying formation of the polycrystalline phase of the nano-films. Fig. 7c shows a photograph of the 35 nm sample under Xe lamp excitation, which displays strong red light. It should be noted that the excitation and emission spectra of the nano-films were also measured, at almost the same with that of the Y0.92VO4:0.03Eu3+, 0.05Bi3+ powders. In addition, the luminescent dynamics of the nano-films were also measured, and the decay time constants for the 5D0–7F2 transitions of Eu3+ in the 23, 35 and 60 nm samples were determined to be 504, 500 and 502 μs, respectively, very close to those observed in the corresponding powder sample (530 μs). This means that the sums of the radiative and nonradiative transition rates of Σ5D0–7FJ in the nano-films have only a little variation in comparison to the powder samples, and the photoluminescence of Eu3+ in the nano-films remains as the high inner quantum efficiency. The outer luminescent efficiency of the 35 nm nano-film on the glass substrate under 320 nm excitation was determined, to be ∼23%. Because the light adsorbed at 320 nm by the nano-film is only one of third of the total light adsorbed by the nano-film and glass substrate. Therefore, it is not hard to estimate that the luminescent quantum efficiency of Eu3+ in the nano-film itself is ∼69%. The luminescent efficiency of Eu3+ could be further improved by raising the annealing temperature of the nano-films.
 Fig. 7  The FE-SEM image, XRD patterns and photograph of the as-prepared thin-films with different film thickness: (a) FE-SEM taken from the upside of the 35 nm nanofilm on the glass substrate (b) XRD patterns of different samples. (c) Luminescent photograph of the 35 nm nanofilm on the glass substrate under Xe lamp excitation. 

Fig. 8 shows the UV to visible transmission spectra of the nano-films samples on the glass substrate. It can be observed that light has no transmission through ordinary glass because the wavelength is shorter than 300 nm. In the UV range of 300–400 nm, transmissivity of the glass increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. In the visible region, transimissivity of the glass is in the range of 85–90%. Transmissivity of the nano-films on the glasses considerably decreases in the 300–400 nm UV range, which means that the nano-films can filter out UV light more efficiently than the ordinary glass sample. However, the samples also partially absorb visible light, which can have a negative influence on the solar cells. For the 23 nm, 35 nm and 60 nm thin-films on the glasses, the average transmissivity in the green and red regions decreases about 2.8, 5.0, and 19.6% in comparison to that of the glass reference, respectively. Considering the loss of visible transmission light, only the 23 nm and 35 nm nano-films adapt to photoconversion.

3.3. 
          Photodegradation testing of P3HT with nano-film converter
To prevent photodegradation of P3HT, the 35 nm nano-film converter on the glass substrate or the ordinary glass reference was put in front of the P3HT thin-film. The Xe–Hg lamp passing through the converter or the reference glass was used as an illumination source. The illumination experiments were performed at atmospheric environment and in the dark. Fig. 9 shows the normalized absorbance of P3HT as a function of irradiation time with the YVO4:Bi3+, Eu3+ nano-film converter or with the glass reference in front of the P3HT film. It can be seen that the photodegradation process, with the glass reference, is close to a linear decrease and the relative absorbance rapidly degrades from 1.00 to 0.46 after 11 h, reducing ∼54%. The absorbance with the converter decreases from 1.00 to 0.83, reducing only ∼17%. The degradation of the P3HT thin-film with the converter is about 3 times lower than the reference glass, indicating that the nano-film converter can effectively reduce the degradation rate of P3HT relative to the reference glass. It should be pointed that the mechanism of the photodegradation of P3HT has been discussed as the subject of some investigations.13–15,19 It can be attributed to the oxidization and the formation of volatile decomposition products on the surface of the P3HT film. Previous studies by other authors demonstrate that the photodegradation of P3HT not only depends on the wavelength and power density of the irradiation light, but also on the temperature, atmosphere and humidity etc.20
 Fig. 9  The normalized absorption intensity was monitored at 523 nm as a function of irradiation time. The irradiation light comes from a Xe lamp with power density of 310 mW cm−2. 
Conclusions
In this article, the Y0.97−xVO4:0.03Eu3+, xBi3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) micro-sized powders were prepared and their photo-conversion properties were studied to obtain optimum precursor phosphors by measuring excitation and emission spectra, luminescent efficiency, dynamics and time-resolved emission spectra. The optimum sample, Y0.92VO4:0.03Eu3+, 0.05Bi3+ with excitation bands of 220–400 nm and luminescent quantum efficiency of more than 90% was used to prepare UV to visible nano-film converters. By laser ablation methods, smooth, dense and effective nano-films converters were prepared. By controlling the thickness of the thin-films, the converters can largely absorb UV light and effectively convert it to visible, and reserve high transparency in the visible region. And more, the effectiveness of converter for protecting P3HT against photodegradation was tested. The photo-stability of the P3HT thin-film with the photo-converter increased 3-fold compared to film without the converter.
