    , Accepted 2nd December 2017First published on 4th December 2017AbstractTriclinic iron vanadate (n-type FeVO4) thin films were fabricated for the first time by spray pyrolysis and elucidated as a potential photoanode material for solar water oxidation. FeVO4 has an ideal band gap for a photoanode of ∼2.0 eV, which corresponds to a potential solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 16%. However, our findings show that the photoelectrochemical performance of FeVO4 is limited by very poor charge carrier separation efficiency in the bulk. Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements revealed that the low mobility (∼5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and short diffusion length (∼2 nm) of undoped FeVO4 are the main reason for its fast bulk recombination. To overcome the poor charge separation efficiency in the bulk, molybdenum doping was used to enhance its mobility, lifetime, and carrier concentration. Doping with 2% Mo increased the photocurrent density by more than 45% at 1.6 V vs. RHE. Finally, we show that the near-ideal band gap of FeVO4 can be combined with the favorable carrier mobility of BiVO4 in a mixed phase compound, Fe1−xBixVO4, a new photoanode candidate for solar water splitting.
Introduction
The successful development of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) as a photoanode for solar water splitting has generated increasing interest in complex metal oxides. Despite common limitations of modest surface catalytic activity, poor carrier transport and moderate optical absorption,1–3 various methods can be implemented to solve these problems. In the case of BiVO4, for example, surface modification layers,4,5 doping,6–11 and nanostructuring1,12–14 have been successfully used to achieve impressive performance enhancements. The combination of these techniques has led to the highest reported photocurrent density of 6.72 mA cm−2 for a BiVO4-based nanostructured photoanode, which corresponds to 90% of the theoretical maximum photocurrent density based on its band gap of 2.4 eV (7.5 mA cm−2).15 Although this record photocurrent density is encouraging, it also serves as a reminder that the performance of BiVO4 photoanodes is intrinsically limited by the relatively large band gap (2.4 eV) of BiVO4.16 In order to further enhance the efficiency, a complex metal oxide with a band gap smaller than that of BiVO4 is therefore desired. Calculations have shown that a photoanode with a band gap of ∼1.7–1.9 eV can potentially result in a STH efficiency higher than 20% when combined with an ∼1.0–1.3 eV bottom absorber in a tandem configuration.17–20 Several promising candidates are available for a small band gap photocathode (e.g., Si, WSe2, and InP),21–24 but a good candidate for a photoanode with a band gap of 1.7–1.9 eV is, unfortunately, still not obvious.
To solve the above limitations, researchers have turned their attention to many novel or less investigated semiconductors.2,3 Among them, iron(III) vanadate (FeVO4) is one possible candidate. This n-type semiconductor has a triclinic crystal structure consisting of [FeO6] octahedra and [FeO5] distorted trigonal bipyramids, with [VO4] tetrahedra connecting the two structures.25 It was first identified by a high-throughput screening method as a potential photoelectrode material with good absorption in the visible part of the solar spectrum.26 The band gap of FeVO4 is reported to be ∼2.0–2.1 eV;27–29 while it is slightly larger than the ideal 1.7–1.9 eV, the theoretical achievable STH efficiency is still a respectable 16%. The photocurrent density of the undoped material is, however, less than 0.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (potential relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode).27 Efforts have been made to improve the performance (e.g., doping with W and partial reduction of Fe3+/Fe2+),28,30 but the photocurrent enhancement has been marginal. The cause of such a small photocurrent is not clear, because many intrinsic properties, such as the exact band positions, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are still unknown. Elucidation of these properties will allow us to identify the performance limiting factors and apply appropriate improvement strategies.
In this work, we employed spray pyrolysis to fabricate crystalline thin film FeVO4 photoanodes. After heat treatment at 650 °C to obtain the desired phase, the film was subjected to a combination of photoelectrochemical and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements. The photocurrent of FeVO4 was found to be limited by poor charge separation efficiency, caused by a very low carrier mobility. Based on this insight, we introduced molybdenum (Mo) as a dopant and successfully improved the carrier transport properties as well as photoelectrochemical performance. We conclude by exploring a mixture of FeVO4 and BiVO4 (i.e., Fe1−xBixVO4) in order to further improve the photoelectrochemical performance.
Experimental
Sample fabrication
The FeVO4 films were fabricated using a simple spray pyrolysis method. The details of the spray setup and deposition process can be found in previous reports.6,31 The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mM Fe(C5H7O2)3 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) and 20 mM VO(C5H7O2)2 (99%, Acros Organics) in absolute ethanol (Sigma Aldrich). For Mo doped samples, MoO2(C5H7O2)2 (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the precursor while keeping the molar ratio Fe/(V + Mo) = 1. The volume of the precursor was adjusted according to the thickness of the film to be deposited (e.g., 25 mL precursor for an ∼100 nm film). FTO substrates (TEC-7, Pilkington) were placed on a hot plate, which was heated to 450 °C before deposition. The spray rate was controlled to be ∼1.5 mL per cycle, with each cycle consisting of a 5 s spray time and 55 s rest time. The rest time was necessary to allow complete evaporation of the solvent and pyrolysis of acetylacetonate ligands. The as-deposited films were then annealed at 650 °C for 2 min in technical air (20% O2, 80% N2) with a ramp rate of 15 °C min−1. For time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, the films were deposited on quartz substrates (2.5 × 1.2 cm2, Spectrosil 2000, Heraeus) using the same spray procedure.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu-Kα, λ = 0.154056 nm) in a gracing incidence configuration with an incidence angle of 0.5°. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) were taken with a LEO GEMINI scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured in an integrating sphere using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrometer. Elemental analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.74 eV, Specs Focus 500 monochromator) and a hemispherical analyzer (Specs Phoibos 100) in an ultrahigh vacuum system (base pressure ∼ 10−8 mbar). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was conducted using a He I source (E = 21.218 eV) with the same hemispherical analyzer as in the XPS measurement. Atomic force microscopy (Park Systems XE70) was used to measure the surface roughness of the films.
Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements were performed in a cavity cell using a frequency-tripled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 355 nm as the excitation source with a 7 ns pulse. Microwaves in the X-band region (8.4–8.7 GHz) were generated by using a voltage controlled oscillator (Sivers IMA VO3262X). Further details of the TRMC measurement have been described elsewhere.32–35
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode configuration under the control of a potentiostat (EG&G PAR 273A). Samples were connected as the working electrode while a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode (total area is 7–8 times larger than that of the working electrode), and an Ag/AgCl electrode (XR300, saturated KCl/AgCl solution, Radiometer Analytical) as the reference electrode. For current–voltage curve measurements, samples were tested in a 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (KPi, pH = 7) electrolyte at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1. The photocurrent was measured under AM1.5 solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (WACOM, type WXS-50S-5H, class AAA). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed utilizing a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel) connected with a grating monochromator (Acton Spectra Pro 2155). Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted with a Zahner Elektrik potentiostat (Model IM6).
Results and discussion
Spray-deposited FeVO4 photoanodes

Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of both the as-deposited and the annealed films. Although the triclinic crystal structure of FeVO4 already emerges in the as-deposited films, annealing at 650 °C for 2 minutes results in higher crystallinity. All peaks match the standard reported pattern for FeVO4, except for one peak of Fe2V4O13 (2θ = 12.56°), which only appears after the high temperature annealing. The molar ratio of secondary phase Fe2V4O13 is calculated to be 4.4% from the Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern. No hematite (α-Fe2O3) peaks are present. This is also found to be the case for various thicknesses of the film (from 25 to 800 nm), as shown in Fig. S1.† We note that the presence of the secondary phase was only found in films deposited on FTO; no secondary phase was detected for films deposited on quartz (Fig. S2†).

(b) SEM image of the FeVO4 film annealed at 650 °C for 2 minutes in air. Inset shows the same morphology at a higher magnification. 
Scanning electron micrographs show that the as-deposited films have the morphology of stacked rough particles (Fig. S3†). Upon annealing, they become interconnected grains with a size of 100–400 nm (Fig. 1b). The smooth grain surface is in agreement with the higher crystallinity shown by the XRD data. Cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S4†) show films with a homogeneous thickness, similar to other materials prepared by spray pyrolysis in the same spray setup.31,34 Based on the cross section of samples sprayed with 50 mL and 100 mL of the precursor, we obtained thickness values of ∼200 nm and ∼400 nm respectively (Fig. S4a and b†), indicating a linear relationship between the precursor volume and film thickness.
The absorption spectrum of the 200 nm FeVO4 film is shown in Fig. 2a, as obtained from UV-vis spectroscopy using an integrating sphere configuration (spectra for other thicknesses are shown in Fig. S5†). The presence of the secondary phase does not affect the overall absorption spectrum, since spectra for films deposited on FTO (4.4 mol% of Fe2V4O13 secondary phase is present) and films deposited on quartz (no secondary phase) do not show any significant difference (Fig. S6†). The absorption edge is ∼600 nm, and the films appear yellow/orange in color (Fig. S7†). The absorption coefficient (α) can be calculated by using the following equation: (1)where A is the absorption at a single wavelength and d the film thickness. Fig. 2b shows α as a function of photon energy (wavelength), as obtained from the 200 nm film. For photons with energy above 2.6 eV (wavelength 480 nm), the calculated absorption coefficient is between 4 × 104 and 105 cm−1, corresponding to a penetration depth (α−1) of ∼100–250 nm. Overall, a thickness of 400 nm is needed to absorb ∼60% of all AM1.5 photons with wavelengths above the bandgap of FeVO4. The calculated Tauc plots (Fig. 2c) demonstrate that FeVO4 has a direct band gap of ∼2.6 eV and an indirect band gap of ∼2.07 eV, enabling a wide range of visible light absorption. The indirect band gap of 2.07 eV agrees with reported values in the literature.27,28

The photocurrents of samples with various thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3a. The current–voltage (J–V) curve of FeVO4 films under chopped simulated solar light shows moderate photocurrent but a relatively high onset potential of ∼0.68 V vs. RHE (Fig. S8†). This is in excellent agreement with the flat-band potential of the film, which is ∼0.69 ± 0.06 V vs. RHE, according to the Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S9†). UPS measurements (Fig. S10†) reveal a work function value of 5.1 ± 0.15 eV (i.e., the Fermi level is ∼0.6 V vs. RHE), which corresponds well with the onset potential and the flat-band potential. The optimum thickness is found to be 400 nm, as shown in Fig. 3b; this is presumably caused by the competition between the absorption depth and diffusion length of the photogenerated carriers in FeVO4.

(b) The photocurrent at 1.2 V vs. RHE as a function of the film thickness. Dashed blue line is a guide to the eye. (c) Charge separation and injection efficiency of the 400 nm FeVO4 sample. 
The obtained photocurrent (0.15 mA cm−2) is comparable to previously reported values,28 but it is still lower than the theoretical photocurrent based on the band gap (13 mA cm−2). In order to understand the cause for such a low photocurrent, further photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in an electrolyte containing Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger to distinguish the bulk charge separation from surface charge injection efficiencies (see ESI† on calculation steps). The calculated ηsep and ηinj of the 400 nm-thick sample are shown in Fig. 3c. ηinj increases with applied potential and reaches a value of 60–80% at potentials above 1.2 V vs. RHE. On the other hand, ηsep remains lower than 2% over the potential range. We note that this may be partially attributed to the presence of the secondary phase, which affects the photocurrent negatively. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests that the surface charge injection in FeVO4 is not the main problem, but the bulk carrier separation is.
Mo doping of FeVO4
One common method to address the problem of poor charge separation in the bulk is to improve the conductivity by doping.11,36–38 Here, we introduced Mo into the 200 nm-thick FeVO4 films (200 nm was chosen as the thickness here since there is only minute differences of photocurrent with the 400 nm, but with a much faster deposition time), by simply adding a Mo precursor to the spray deposition solution as mentioned in the Experimental section. Mo6+ is expected to replace V5+ according to the following defect-chemical equation (in the Kröger–Vink notation): (2)
If no trapping at defect sites occurs, the additional electrons will reside in the conduction band and improve the bulk conductivity of the film. This is confirmed by the 5-fold improvement in the carrier concentration upon 2% Mo-doping, based on the Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S9†). Upon addition of Mo, no additional peaks are observed in the XRD patterns (Fig. S11†). Although this does not exclude the possibility that small amounts of X-ray amorphous or nanocrystalline Mo-oxide have segregated out, the systematic shift of the FeVO4 XRD peaks is clear evidence of the successful incorporation of Mo into the FeVO4 lattice (Fig. S12†).39 No significant changes in the morphology or optical absorption are observed for the Mo-doped films when compared to the undoped ones (Fig. S13 and S14†).
The chemical composition of the films was investigated by XPS. No other elements or contaminants (except adventitious carbon) are detected in the survey spectrum (Fig. S15†). The core level spectra are displayed in Fig. 4 to show the oxidation states of elements. Fig. 4a shows the Fe 2p3/2 peaks located at 709–716 eV, which can be attributed to the Fe3+ multiplets, indicating that Fe exhibits a valence state of 3+ in FeVO4.29,40 The binding energy of V is 516.85 eV (Fig. 4b), which represents a V5+ oxidation state.11,41 The O 1s peak is located at 529.9 eV, close to the position expected for a surface lattice oxygen peak.11 No significant change is observed in the Fe, V, and O peaks upon Mo introduction. The signal of the Mo 3d core level (Fig. 4c) confirms the successful incorporation of Mo into the 2% Mo doped sample. The binding energy of Mo 3d5/2 at ∼232.3 eV confirms that Mo exists in the 6+ oxidation state.11,42 The Mo/(Mo + V) atomic ratio is calculated to be 1.9 ± 0.1% from the XPS results, which is in good agreement with the concentration of Mo in the precursor.

The photocurrents under chopped AM1.5 illumination for FeVO4 with varying Mo concentration are shown in Fig. 5a. The photocurrent increases with increasing Mo concentration and reaches a maximum for 2% Mo concentration (see the inset of Fig. 5a); beyond this the photocurrent decreases. For the 2% Mo doped film, we obtained a photocurrent improvement of ∼40% at potentials higher than 1.6 V vs. RHE, as compared to the undoped film. Again, we carefully note that the photocurrent may be affected (either positively or negatively) by the presence of the Fe2V4O13 secondary phase. Overall, our photocurrent is comparable with other reports on FeVO4 in the literature, as summarized in Table S1.†

The IPCE of the undoped and 2% Mo films is shown in Fig. 5b. Consistent with the AM1.5 photocurrent results, the 2% Mo doped sample shows a strongly enhanced efficiency between 380 and 480 nm. At longer wavelengths, the IPCE is also improved, but remains lower than 1%. The 480 nm wavelength corresponds to a photon energy of 2.6 eV, which is exactly the direct band gap of FeVO4 (Fig. 2). Thus, it appears that the direct optical transition contributes much more to the total photocurrent than the indirect one. The charge separation and injection efficiencies of the 2% Mo doped sample were also measured to investigate the influence of doping (Fig. S16†). Interestingly, ηinj improves with doping, with values over 90% at potentials larger than 1.35 V vs. RHE. ηsep also improves upon Mo doping, but the values remain very low (<3%).
In order to understand the reason for the very low carrier separation efficiency—even after Mo doping—we performed time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements to investigate the carrier transport properties (i.e., mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length) of FeVO4. Only a moderate amplitude of TRMC signals is detected from the undoped FeVO4 film (Fig. 6a). The TRMC signal (ϕΣμ) of the undoped sample decays rapidly within the first 100 ns, after which it becomes very noisy. The decay curve of the undoped sample can be fitted with the power law (ϕΣμ = 0.0012 × t−1.06, t < 100 ns) and the mobility is estimated to be ∼4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Upon Mo doping, the microwave signal significantly increases and a clear prolonged decay is observed (Fig. 6a). The decay curve fits well with the power law (ϕΣμ = 2.66 × t−0.48) over a time window ranging from ns to 10 μs (see Fig. 6a). Mobility values of 1.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 are extrapolated to AM 1.5 conditions (∼109 photons per pulse per cm2) for 2% and 4% Mo doped samples, respectively (Fig. 6b). These values are ∼3 times larger than that of the undoped sample.

The blue solid lines are the power law fits of the curves. k, k1 and k2 are the decay exponents. (b) Calculated mobility for 2%, 4% Mo doped samples and undoped samples from different light intensities. 
The power law decay indicates a trap-limited bimolecular recombination mechanism instead of regular band–band recombination.43 Such behavior is consistent with the relatively constant mobility and similar decay kinetics at various light intensities (Fig. S17†). The decay curves for 2% and 4% Mo-doped samples have the same decay exponent of −0.5. This suggests an identical decay mechanism, most probably due to the interaction (i.e. trapping and detrapping) of charge carriers with a wide distribution of states in the band gap (multiple trapping).44 The undoped sample, however, decays much faster than the doped ones in the first ∼100 ns, where the decay exponent is close to −1.
The power law decay has been empirically ascribed to trapping–detrapping or carrier tunneling models.43,45–47 For the trapping–detrapping model, a distribution of trap states that leads to a distribution of trapping–detrapping times results in a broad range of recombination time constants and a decay exponent between 0 and −1.46 Alternatively, in the carrier tunneling model, the trapped carriers can tunnel to adjacent recombination sites; the broad range of tunneling time constants is then a result of a distribution of short distances between the trap states and the recombination centers. The possibility of tunneling for the undoped samples is inferred from the power law exponent (∼−1), which indicates zero-order kinetics, and recombination centers that are close to each other (within a few nm). The addition of Mo leads to a slower decay with a power law exponent of −0.5, which suggests that Mo could prevent fast tunneling, possibly by the interaction of Mo excess electrons with trap states (i.e., pre-filling). The exact mechanism from our data is unknown and beyond the scope of this work; further experiments are needed to determine this.
The lifetime of the charge carriers, τ, is defined as the time that it takes for the signal to decrease to 50% of its starting value. Values of 29 and 136 ns are found for undoped and 2% Mo doped samples, respectively. Based on these lifetimes and mobilities, the diffusion lengths were calculated to be ∼2 nm for undoped and ∼7 nm for 2% Mo doped FeVO4. The improvement in the carrier transport properties of Mo-doped FeVO4 is consistent with the photocurrent improvement obtained upon Mo-doping. Nevertheless, the values are relatively low, even with Mo-doping, which explains the very low carrier separation efficiency.
Mixed phase FeVO4–BiVO4
The sections above revealed that although FeVO4 has an extended optical absorption as compared to BiVO4, the carrier mobility is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower. To overcome this trade-off, we investigated the possibility of maintaining the carrier mobility while extending the visible light absorption by partial substitution of Fe3+ cations with Bi3+ in FeVO4. Therefore, a series of samples with different Fe ratios were fabricated under the same conditions by mixing Fe and Bi precursors in different Fe/Bi molar ratios ((Fe + Bi)/V = 1:1). The samples are denoted as Fe1−xBixVO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, e.g., Fe0.2Bi0.8VO4) (ESI note 3†).
Films with different Fe ratios demonstrated a gradual color change from brownish orange (100% Fe, FeVO4) to bright yellow (0% Fe, BiVO4) (Fig. 7a). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy shows that the Fe/Bi ratio matches well with that in the precursor (Fig. 7b). XRD patterns show a gradual change from monoclinic BiVO4 to triclinic FeVO4 with increasing Fe content (Fig. S19†). However, the peak intensity of FeVO4 is relatively low, due to the use of a moderate annealing temperature of 450 °C (instead of the 650 °C that causes high crystallinity of FeVO4). Annealing above 450 °C was found to cause vanadium loss in BiVO4. Therefore, higher annealing temperatures were avoided.

(b) Correlation between the Fe content added to the precursor and the Fe content in the deposited films measured by EDX. (c) Band gap (direct and indirect) values of films as a function of Fe content. Values are taken from the Tauc plots. (d) TRMC-obtained mobility as a function of Fe content in the film. 
Increasing Fe/Bi ratio in the film leads to the extension of absorption spectra obtained from UV-vis measurements (Fig. S20†). For films with an Fe content higher than 5%, a substantial improvement of absorption in the range of 500–600 nm was observed, which is beyond the absorption onset of pure BiVO4 (∼500 nm). Fig. 7c illustrates the influence of Fe content on the apparent band gap values of the films. With increasing Fe content, the direct band gap is relatively constant at ∼2.6 eV, but the effective indirect band gap decreases from 2.4 to 2.1 eV. At the same time, the TRMC-derived mobility of the films decreases with increasing Fe content (Fig. 7d). These facts suggest that an optimum concentration of Fe might exist, at which the loss in mobility is compensated by the increased optical absorption. Unfortunately, initial photoelectrochemical measurements do not show additional photocurrent beyond the band gap of BiVO4, possibly due to the limitation for annealing at higher temperature, which is required to obtain highly crystalline FeVO4. Alternative deposition techniques (e.g., pulsed laser deposition) that can produce a high quality crystalline material without the need for post-deposition annealing should be considered in order to obtain Fe1−xBixVO4 films with good photoelectrochemical properties.
Conclusions
Spray-deposited n-type triclinic FeVO4 films have been systematically assessed as a candidate photoanode material. The band gap is 2.07 eV as obtained from optical measurements, which is close to the ideal band gap range for a light absorber (1.7–1.9 eV). Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements reveal that the low carrier mobility of FeVO4 is the main factor that limits its PEC performance (see Table S2† for comparison with other metal oxides). The low mobility results in poor conductivity and very limited carrier diffusion lengths. As a result, the photogenerated charge carriers are primarily lost through bulk recombination, resulting in a very low separation efficiency of ∼1%. Doping is partially effective in improving the photocurrent, as also shown in other reports.28,30 In our case, Mo-doping leads to a significant enhancement in the carrier mobility (×3) and lifetime (×4.5), which results in a 45% increase of the photocurrent density at 1.6 V vs. RHE and a major enhancement of the IPCE (7% at 400 nm vs. 1% for the undoped film). Nevertheless, the carrier diffusion lengths for the doped films are still less than 10 nm; further efforts towards improving the carrier separation efficiency (e.g., nanostructuring and heterojunction formation) need to be pursued. In addition, the high donor densities even in the undoped films may also suggest the presence of a large number of intrinsic defects generated during the synthesis process, which can act as recombination centers. Higher quality films deposited with greater control over defects (e.g., pulsed laser deposition) need to be developed in order to further improve the PEC performance of FeVO4. Finally, we have proposed a mixed phase iron bismuth vanadate compound (Fe1−xBixVO4) in order to enhance the charge carrier mobility. While the mobility indeed improves with increasing Bi content, the optical absorption edge shifts towards higher energies; a delicate balance between this trade-off may potentially result in an optimum photoelectrode. The material parameters and insights from this study are expected to help the further development of FeVO4 and related photoelectrodes.
