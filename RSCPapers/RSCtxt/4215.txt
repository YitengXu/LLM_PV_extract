    , Accepted 18th April 2021First published on 19th April 2021AbstractNanostructured halide perovskites have highly yielded record LEDs. This is mainly due to their higher versatility in the local management of charge carriers, which has enabled photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) close to 100%. However, the most promising perovskite structures mainly rely on lead analogues, thereby hindering their commercial applications due to the toxicity of lead. Here, we summarized the recent developments of highly emissive perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) from lead to lead free. Given the performance and current challenges, possible future research directions of emissive halide perovskite nanocrystals are provided in this rapidly evolving field of more extensive basic research and practical applications.
1. Introduction
In 2009, halide perovskite-based solar cells were first reported. Later, extremely rapid progress has been made in this field and the energy conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells reached 16.2%. It even happens that the corresponding perovskites containing organic cations have resulted in single-junction photovoltaic devices with over 20% power conversion efficiency.1–6 The success of perovskites in solar cells stimulated their development in other fields, such as LEDs. Display technology is especially important in today's society. High resolution, high efficiency and high color purity for realizing vivid natural colors are the major trends in display technology. Therefore, emissive materials with high luminescence and narrow full width at half-maximum (FWHM) have become a new research hotspot. Among many candidates, perovskites have attracted great attention and shown potential for future applications in LEDs.
The general chemical formula of halide perovskites is ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation (organic or inorganic), B is a divalent metal cation (Pb2+, Sn2+, Mn2+, Ge2+, etc.) and X is a halide ion (Br−, Cl− and I−). Typical “A” cations such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+) or Cs+ can form a 3D framework with the BX6 network. The increase of the effective ionic radius cation radius (RCs+ < RMA+ < RFA+) leads to the expansion of crystal lattice and the decrease of the band gap. As the size of the “X” halogen increases, the covalent characteristics of the electronegativity strengthen, resulting in a bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra. Hence, the PL emission spectra of these ABX3 NCs can be tuned covering the entire visible spectra based on bandgap engineering. Highly optical absorption is the basis for fabricating efficient solar cells with thin absorbers. The absorption coefficient of halide perovskites is much higher than that of GaAs within the visible light range because of strong antibonding between the Pb s orbital and I p orbital, which leads to the VBM–CBM transition probability of CH3NH3PbI3 comparable to that of GaAs with a direct bandgap.3 A high PLQY is an important parameter to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit (SQL), which determines the peak performance of the reciprocal action occurring in single-junction solar cells and LEDs.7 Millimeter-sized halide perovskite crystals showed poor PLQYs at low excitation intensity due to the dissociation of excitons caused by ionic characteristics.8 Perovskite NCs surrounded by organic media with a low dielectric constant have a poor shielding effect on electron–hole coulomb interactions. Therefore, compared to the bulk phase, the exciton binding energy (Eb) of NCs increased by an order of magnitude. It can also be speculated that the PL emission of NCs results from exciton recombination rather than bimolecular recombination of free carriers. The higher exciton binding energy results in high PLQYs by reducing the exciton dissociation probability prior to radiative decay.9 Tuneable emission spectra, high absorption coefficients and high exciton binding energy make halide perovskite NCs a class of promising highly emissive materials.
Although most of the perovskite studies focused on lead perovskites, the toxicity of lead in perovskite NCs limits the prospects for large-scale use in business. Toxicity has become a major challenge in halide perovskites. Therefore, massive efforts have been made to replace lead with less- or non-toxic metals (Bi, Sb, Sn, etc.) in the recent development of halide perovskites. However, compared to lead-perovskites, most lead-free perovskites (such as CsSnX3) are more unstable under ambient conditions and have lower PLQYs because of their higher defect density.10 Even so, benefitting from being more environmentally friendly, many researchers are committed to lead-free perovskites. Stimulated by the further development of lead halide perovskite with excellent properties, research on lead-free perovskite has also seen another upsurge. More than 30000 papers on lead-free perovskites have been published since 2019. Therefore, the search for lead-free perovskite NCs with stable and excellent performance is an urgent research topic.
Here, we will cover halide perovskite NCs from lead to lead-free with a high PLQY and narrow FWHM. The mechanism of highly emitting will be summarized as well. In addition, the application of these materials in LEDs will be analysed, presenting the state of the art of perovskite LEDs and making a breakthrough for achieving high color quality, purity, and white-light emission. Finally, we will discuss the challenges to be addressed, which include improving the stability of the devices, to obtain lead-free halide perovskites with high performance.
2. Lead halide perovskite
Lead-based perovskite NCs (LPNCs) have superior optoelectronic properties, such as long carrier transport distance, high absorption coefficient, excellent charge transport, and high PLQY.11–13 These properties confer them great promise in the field of optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells.14–21 To date, the maximum PCE of LPNC-based solar cells can be up to 24.2%,22 and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LPNC-based LEDs reaches more than 20%.23 According to the A cation, lead halide perovskite can be further divided into organic–inorganic (hybrid) lead halide perovskite and all-inorganic lead halide perovskite.
2.1 Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite
In the past few years, solar cells based on hybrid lead halide perovskite have attracted wide attention due to their excellent photoelectric properties. For organic–inorganic halide perovskites with the formula APbX3, the A cation is an organic molecule, which is commonly methylammonium (CH3NH3+, MA) with RA = 0.18 nm and formamidinium (NH2CHNH2+, FA) with RA = 0.19–0.22 nm. The most famous among these perovskites is CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I), which is the first published solar cell based on perovskite.3 In general, perovskite NCs composed of bromide have higher stability than perovskite NCs composed of iodide.24 In addition, tunable light emission in organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs has been demonstrated by controlling the composition of halide substituents as well as the size and shape of NCs.25,26 Chemical composition has a strong influence on effective exciton mass and electronic energy. The geometric shapes and dimensions of NCs affect their photoelectric properties by changing the band structure. Therefore, it is important to master the ability of systematically manipulating the shape and dimensions of NCs.27
Zhang et al. developed a ligand assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method to prepare colloidal MAPbX3 quantum dots (QDs). In the LARP approach, a polar solvent (e.g., N-dimethylformamide (DMF)) act as a solvent to dissolve the inorganic salts and molecule ligands, while a non-polar solvent (e.g., toluene) act as an antisolvent to facilitate reprecipitation. MAPbBr3 colloidal QDs exhibit a high PLQY up to 70%, tunable emission from 400 to 750 nm and FWHM of 28–36 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a. Except for the high exciton binding energy (Eb) of QDs, their high PLQY can be attributed to two other reasons. One is the reduction of the surface trapping effect due to the richness of Br− on the QD surface. The other is the efficient radiative recombination of excitons guaranteed by the large exciton binding energy. Wide-color gamut white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) were successfully prepared from green emissive MAPbBr3 QDs and red emissive K2SiF6:Mn4. These results show the great potential of MAPbBr3 QDs for wide-color gamut display devices.26 With the same method, solution-processed, core–shell-type and mixed MA–OA lead bromide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPs) were prepared. A core–shell shape can obviously improve the stability, efficiency and brightness of semiconductor NCs.26,28 Core–shell type nanoparticles can only form in the presence of PbBr2 during coprecipitation of MABr and OABr. The MAPbBr3 NPs exhibit green emission at 521 nm with a narrow FWHM of 24 nm and a high PLQY up to 80–84%. An enhanced PLQY of 92% with a blue shift was obtained by changing the MABr:OABr ratio to 8:2, as shown in Fig. 1b. Additional experiments confirm that the core–shell type structure results in a high PLQY by limiting charge carriers and passivating non-radiative recombination sites.29 This research is a step closer to solving the problem of perovskite air stability and raises the prospects of the development of color-adjustable perovskite LEDs. Huang et al. successfully controlled the size of resulting MAPbBr3 QDs by modifying the temperature in the LARP process. The as-prepared QDs exhibit a tunable emission peak range from 475 to 520 nm by changing the temperature-dependence size of QDs, as shown in Fig. 1c. The QDs are characterized by an outstandingly high absolute PLQY up to 93% and a narrow FWHM of 20–50 nm. The high PLQY benefits from using surface ligands with long chains and high precipitation temperature resulting in high crystallinity of the core. The long chains can effectively control the NC size by acting as self-termination of crystallization and increase the non-radiative lifetimes by increasing the precipitation temperature.30 These ultra-high PLQYs offer outstanding potential for optoelectronic applications, such as lasing and LEDs. Schmidt et al. synthesized MAPbBr3 NCs by solution-induced recrystallization. This synthetic approach employed MABr and long chain alkyl ammonium bromide to react with PbBr2 along with oleic acid (OA) and octylamine (OLAM) in octadecylene (ODE). Long chain amine ligands are conducive to controlling the size of NCs, and OA inhibits polymerization and improves colloid stability. The MAPbBr3 NCs were stable for more than 3 months. This made it possible to prepare a homogeneous thin film by a spin-coating method at RT. Highly crystalline MAPbBr3 nanoparticles were obtained with a high PLQY up to 20%. A thin film LED was also prepared and compared with a bulk film LED, an appreciable improvement in the electroluminescence is observed.31 Highly luminescent MAPbBr3 nanoparticles with an enhanced PLQY of 83% were achieved by further optimizing the molar ratio of OABr:MABr:PbBr2 (8:12:5), which results in high recombination lifetime and excellent photostability.32 Another common method of synthesizing perovskite NCs is the template-assisted approach. The perovskite NCs were prepared by spin-coating a precursor consisting of an MA halide and PbX2 onto a mesoporous silica or alumina film as the template. By this method, perovskite NPs with different sizes can be easily prepared with a PLQY of above 50% by using different pore size templates.25,33 In 2017, Demchyshyn et al. obtained NCs with a PLQY of up to 25% for MAPbI3 NCs and up to 60% for MAPbBr3 NCs by using nanoporous silicon and alumina thin films as templates (Fig. 1d). High PLQY is mainly due to the large Eb of NCs. The LEDs prepared by MAPbBr3 NCs have a current efficiency of ∼0.09 cd A−1 and an EQE of ∼0.03%. The performance can be further optimized due to a high PLQY up to 90%.27 Zhong's group synthesized monodisperse MAPbBr3 colloidal QDs by the emulsion method, which can provide better control on perovskite crystallization. In this method, two immiscible solvents (DMF and n-hexane) were mixed to constitute an emulsion system. A demulsifier (tert-butanol/acetone) was then added into the emulsion system to induce crystallization. The size of MAPbBr3 QDs could be tuned (2–8 nm) by the amount of the demulsifier. As shown in Fig. 1e, MAPbBr3 QDs exhibit a high PLQY up to 80–92%, which is overall higher than that prepared by the LARP method. Green LEDs fabricated with CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs exhibited a maximum current efficiency of 4.5 cd A−1, power efficiency of 3.5 lm W−1, and EQE of 1.1%.34 Through optimization, perovskite LEDs prepared by the emulsion method may be widely applied in thin film displays, solid-state lighting, and other solution-processed optoelectronic devices. With this method, pure MAPbBr3 colloidal QDs were controllably synthesized by Liu et al. The resulting MAPbBr3 colloidal QDs with a maximum PLQY of 90.2%, high stability and color tunability (from green to violet) can be achieved by modifying the amounts of ligands (OA and OLAM) (Fig. 1f). In addition to its promising application in WLEDs, MAPbBr3 QDs can be used as single-component multicolor-emitting materials.35 Liu et al. showed that the PLQY of MAPbBr3 can be greatly enhanced by introducing water to form MAPbBr3 QDs@PbBr(OH) microrods. The PLQY can be increased from 2.50% to 71.54%, and the PLQY of a sample in aqueous solution decreases minimally over 1 year. Based on these merits, LEDs based on MAPbBr3@PbBr(OH) were successfully fabricated. The luminescence intensity of the as-prepared LEDs can reach 9549 cd m−2.36

The substitution of CH3NH3+ with a larger cation can make the crystal structure of ABX3 have a higher symmetry. However, oversize cation would make it fail to format the three-dimensional framework due to size limitation. Therefore, HC(NH2)2+ (FA) with a size smaller than CH3CH2NH3+ but larger than CH3NH3+ is another common choice for A sites. Better stability towards heat, moisture, and chemicals is often a feature of FAPbX3 perovskites which can be attributed to higher symmetry.37,38 Unlike more popular MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3, FAPbBr3 NCs can produce green emission in the region of 530–535 nm, which is especially suitable for TV displays.
In 2016, high quality FAPbBr3 colloidal NCs were synthesized by the LARP method by substituting FA with MA. DMF acts as a solvent to dissolve FABr and PbBr2, and toluene was selected as an antisolvent. The as-prepared FAPbBr3 NCs have a high PLQY of 55–65% with a narrow FWHM of 20 nm. They also demonstrated that as the temperature increases from 180 to 360 K, the FWHM increases and PL intensity reduces (Fig. 2a). The LEDs based on these FAPbBr3 NCs have a bright electroluminescence of up to 2714 cd m−2, maximum luminous efficiency of 6.4 cd A−1 and power efficiency of 5.7 lm W−1.39 This is the first report on high brightness LEDs based on FAPbBr3 NCs in the literature. Tong et al. synthesized FAPbBr3 NCs with the LARP method as well. The PL of high-quality FAPbBr3 NCs is characterized by a high PLQY of 76% with a narrow FWHM of 20 nm. The PL lifetime is 13.2 ns according to the time-resolved PL decay curve. The same as MAPbX3, the PL emission can be tuned from 452 to 646 nm by modifying the halide composition with FAPbBr3 as a template (Fig. 2c). On account of excellent PL properties, they manufactured a liquid-crystal display (LCD) backlight with a wide color gamut of 116% NTSC (Fig. 2d) and a WLED by coating the FAPbBr3/(Sr,Ca)AlSiN3:Eu2+/PMMA mixture on a blue GaN chip (Fig. 2e and f).40 Chin et al. developed 2D-3D hierarchical composite films comprising (OA)2(FA)n−1PbnBr3n+1 microplatelets attached to FAPbBr3 NCs. The 2D-3D hierarchical composite films exhibit a high PLQY of over 80% in the green spectral region and enable an energy cascade. LEDs based on these FAPbBr3 NCs exhibit a record high efficiency of 57.6 cd A−1 with an EQE above 13% and power efficiencies exceeding 58 lm W−1, which are high-performance luminescence metrics that are unparalleled in the field of perovskite LEDs.41 FAPbBr3 NCs were also synthesized by Zu et al. with an ultrapure green backlight which featured a desired emission at 534 nm and a narrow FWHM of 20.5 nm (Fig. 2g). In addition, it covers 85.7% of the Rec. 2020 standard in the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) 1931 color space (Fig. 2h). Therefore, FAPbBr3 NCs synthesized by Zu et al. can be signified as the “greenest” backlight. In addition, the PLQY of the as-prepared FAPbBr3 NCs can be up to above 90%. In addition, they studied the effects of different ligands on nanocrystals, including morphology, crystallinity, photoluminescence, and stability. Compared to short chain ligands, long chain ligands with sufficient passivation can significantly improve the PLQY and stability.42 Protesescu et al. employed a hot injection method to synthesize highly monodisperse cubic-shaped FAPbBr3 NCs. In this method, an FA–Pb precursor was fabricated by the reaction of Pb and FA acetates with OA in ODE. Then, oleylammonium bromide (OAmBr) was injected at 130 °C and cooled to room temperature (RT) and FAPbBr3 NCs were obtained. FAPbBr3 NCs exhibited excellent PL properties such as a high PLQY of 85% and narrow FWHM of <22 nm. NCs with different sizes can be fabricated by adjusting either the amount of OAmBr or the reaction temperature. A higher quantity of OAmBr and lower reaction temperature lead to smaller NCs. And the PL spectra can be tuned in the range of 470–540 nm by adjusting the NC size (Fig. 2b).43

2.2 All-inorganic lead halide perovskite
As mentioned above, due to size limitations, the inorganic cation that can be replaced in the A site is the cesium cation (Cs+). CsPbX3 NCs are usually a class of 0D perovskites. By anion exchange, the PL emission spectra of CsPbX3 NCs can be tuned over the entire visible spectrum with a narrow emission FWHM and high PLQY even up to 100%.44–46 Compared to the above hybrid lead perovskites, all-inorganic lead perovskites tend to have better thermal stability under low-energy electron illumination.47,48 Compared to hybrid perovskite NCs with polydisperse NCs, all-inorganic perovskite often yields monodisperse NCs far less soluble in common solvents, which leads to better control over the size and shape.49,50 With better photostability, all-inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs are more suitable to be introduced into the perovskite layer and hole transport layer (HTL) to control the perovskite band structure and improve hole extraction.51 And thus all inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs have great potential for increasing the power conversion efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.51
Monodisperse colloidal CsPbX3 NCs with a cubic shape were synthesized by Protesescu et al. with the hot injection method, which is the most common method for CsPbX3 NCs synthesis. PbX2 in high boiling ODE was quickly injected with Cs-oleate at 140–200 °C. The absorption and PL emission spectra can be tuned covering the entire visible spectral region by halide substituents and quantum size-effects (Fig. 3a). The CsPbX3 NCs showed a high PLQY up to 90% with a narrow FWHM of 12–42 nm and wide color gamut covering up to 140% of the NTSC color standard. Radiative lifetimes are determined to be 1–29 ns.52 Gao et al. prepared CsPbBr3 NPs by the hot-injection method as well. The NPs presented excellent stability and a high PLQY of up to 80%, which make CsPbBr3 NPs promising for solar cell applications. In addition, a Cs1−yMAyPbI3−xBrx passivation layer is formed by reacting CsPbBr3 NPs and MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Cs1−yMAyPbI3−xBrx passivation layer has a positive impact on improving charge collection. As 2% CsPbBr3 NPs are introduced, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on MAPbI3 is increased to 20.46%.51 Except for the hot injection method, the emulsion method (as done by Zhong et al.34) can also be used for the synthesis of CsPbX3 QDs. Two immiscible solvents (DMF or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), OLAM and OA) were chosen to form an emulsion system. Subsequently, toluene was added into the emulsion system as a demulsifier to induce the crystallization process. With this method, PL spectra of the as-prepared samples exhibit red emission with a PLQY of 80% and FWHM of 35 nm, green emission with a PLQY of 95% and FWHM of 20 nm and blue emission with a PLQY of 70% and FWHM of 18 nm (Fig. 3c). Excellent stability was revealed by a PLQY retention rate of 90% at room temperature for 30 days. As shown in Fig. 3d, WLEDs with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.30) were fabricated, which is very close to the standard white color (0.33, 0.33).53 WLEDs with pure white color and high stability demonstrate good application prospects in display devices.

As the geometric shape of NCs affects their optical and electronic properties, Sun et al. systematically controlled the shape of CsPbX3 NCs by varying the organic acid and amine ligands in the LARP approach. Hexanoic acid and OLAM were used to form quantum dots; OA and dodecylamine were used to form nanocubes; acetate acid and dodecylamine were used to form nanocubes, while OA and OLAM were used to form NPs (Fig. 4a). The PL spectra of CsPbX3 QDs were characterized by a high PLQY up to >80% and tunable emission over the visible range from 380 to 693 nm. The shape-dependent PL decay lifetimes vary from several tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, and this will create opportunities for applications such as in displays, lasing, LEDs, etc.54 Akkerman et al. successfully prepared CsPbX3 NPs by an adaptation of the solution-induced method. By controlling the amount of HBr in the synthesis process, they can accurately tune the thickness of the CsPbBr3 NPs and thus tune the bandgap sensitive to the thickness. The PLQY of the 5 layer CsPbBr3 NPs can be up to 31%. CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 NPs could be prepared as Br− anions substituted with Cl− and I− anions, while maintaining the morphology including the size and shape.55 Pan et al. carried out a comprehensive study to investigate the influence of surfactant ligands on the shape, size, and surface properties of CsPbBr3 NCs by varying the hydrocarbon chain composition of carboxylic acids and amines. They demonstrated that compared with the commonly used Cs2CO3, cesium acetate is a better precursor for synthesizing CsPbBr3 with more volatile shorter chain acids and amines. It mainly relies on the greater solubility of cesium acetate in a broader temperature range. Nanocubes were obtained by using oleylamine and carboxylic acids with decreasing carbon chain lengths. NPs were obtained by using OA and amines with shorter carbon chain lengths, except oleylamine. In addition, the thickness of NPs is dependent on the carbon chain length. Shorter chain amines tend to form thinner NPs. Both NPs and nanocubes showed a high PLQY (22–87%).49 Bekenstein et al. employed the hot injection method to prepare CsPbBr3 NPs by modifying a lower temperature between 90 and 130 °C. Perovskite CsPbBr3 NPs were synthesized directly; CsPbI3, CsPbCl3, and mixed halides were synthesized through anion exchange. The NPs with different thicknesses were obtained by changing the reaction conditions, and the thickness could be confirmed by absorption and PL spectra. The high PLQY (84%) is exhibited in CsPbX3 NPs with band gap emission over the entire visible spectral region by varying the thickness and chemical composition (Fig. 4c).56 Shamsi et al. used OA instead of ODE (as done by Protesescu et al.52) to synthesize CsPbBr3 NPs. The lateral sizes of NPs can be tuned up to a few micrometers by varying the molar ratio of shorter ligands and longer ligands, whereas the thickness remains just a few unit cells constant. As the molar ratios equal to 0.52, the sample has a PLQY of 33% at 456 nm with an average PL lifetime (τ) of 4.3 ns.50 Large-area patterning is a crucial process in manufacturing integrated optoelectronic devices. Perovskite NCs are more difficult to pattern because they are solution-based soft materials. Ozcan et al. developed a new coating method to prepare CsPbBr3 perovskite NPs with a desired pattern by electrospraying a precursor solution on an ITO substrate. The thickness of the NPs, which can be tuned by manipulating the ratios of OLAM and OA, results in the PL emission spectra in the range of blue and green (Fig. 4d). The PLQY of the films varies between 30 and 40%.57

3. Lead-free halide perovskite
Although having the excellent properties mentioned above, the toxicity of lead hinders their wide applications. To address the toxicity of lead, researchers have now stepped-up efforts to develop new lead-free perovskite materials. Finding metal-halide perovskites with properties close to lead perovskites and without toxic elements becomes the next important topic for perovskite NCs. Theoretical studies suggest that the Pb2+ cation with lone pair electrons 6s2 can determine the electronic structure of Pb-based perovskites by participating in the formation of the CBM and VBM.2,3 Therefore, the metal ion used to replace Pb2+ should possess an electron configuration of ns2np0, which is similar to Pb2+ to guarantee the performance of perovskites.
Until now, many metal elements such as Sn(II), Sn(IV), Ag(I), Sb(III), Bi(III), and Mn(II) have been applied as a substitute for Pb in perovskite.58–63 With conditions of coordination and charge balance, only Sn and Ge can both meet and result in traditional perovskite structures.27 The rest of lead-free perovskites should be considered to be perovskite derivatives. In general, lead-free perovskites can be divided into three categories:
(i) Group-14 elements such as Sn are used instead of lead to form traditional perovskite structures;
(ii) Double halide perovskites with the formula A2BB′X6 in which the B-site of ABX3 is substituted by mixed cations, such as Cs2AgBiX6;
(iii) Adjacent kin elements, like Bi and Sb, are used for the substitution of lead to form double perovskite variants with the formula A3B2X9.
In the case of Sn-based halide perovskite, its long-term stability poses a challenge. The Sn(II) in CsSnX3 was susceptible to being oxidized to Sn(IV) as CsSnX3 was exposed to air for only 5 minutes.64 Additionally, the crystallization rate of Sn-based perovskites is much faster than that of Pb-based perovskites due to lower solubility in common solvents, which leads to higher intrinsic defect density.65,66 Thus, while Sn-based halide perovskites (ASnX3) are firstly explored, their properties are typically unsatisfactory due to high intrinsic defect density and being readily oxidized.35,67 Double halide perovskites are relatively more stable, but the photoluminescence of which is not high due to the indirect bandgap (Fig. 5), which is not conducive to the preparation of photoelectric devices.68,69 The double perovskite variants exhibit indirect and direct bandgaps, and large carrier effective masses are observed because the VBM and the CBM are relatively localized resulting from the isolation of [Bi2I9] bioctahedra. Thus, the photoluminescence of double perovskite variants is higher than the rest of the lead-free perovskites.70,71 What's more, the defects in Bi-based halide perovskites are generally shallow due to the upshift of the VBM result from consisting of antibonding hybridization between Bi 6 s and halide p orbitals.27 Bi-based halide perovskites are more promising due to better stability than Sn2+.26,28

3.1 Organic–inorganic lead-free halide perovskite
For Bi-based halide perovskite, halide composition is the critical factor influencing the morphology of NCs. The Bi-based perovskite NCs exhibit a 0D structure for I, a 1D structure for Cl and a 2D structure for Br, as shown in Fig. 6.3,72,73

MA3Bi2X9 perovskite QDs were synthesized by the LARP method. DMF and ethyl acetate were used to dissolve MABr and BiBr3 and octane was used to promote precipitation. The PL peak could be fine-tuned from 360 to 540 nm by halide substitution (Fig. 7a). MA3Bi2Br9 QDs present an emission peak at 430 nm with a PLQY of 12% and FWHM of 62 nm. The value was even comparable to all-inorganic Pb-based QDs with similar emission peaks. It should be noted that the PLQY further increased to 15% by replacing Br with Cl.74 Further research demonstrates that the PLQY is up to 54.1% for Cl-passivation of MA3Bi2Br9 QDs with a slight blue shift at 422 nm and a FWHM of 41 nm, as shown in Fig. 7b. One reason is that Cl− anions are located on the surface of MA3Bi2Br9 QDs and effectively suppress surface defects. Cl-passivated MA3Bi2Br9 QDs also present better stability due to the passivation effect. A more efficient blue emission was achieved by this method.73 The results highlight the potential of MA3Bi2Br9 QDs for applications in phosphors, scintillators, and LEDs.

3.2 All-inorganic lead-free halide perovskite
All inorganic Cs3Bi2Br9 has much better thermal stability than MA3Bi2Br9. Cs3Bi2X9 NCs were synthesized by the LARP method. CsBr and BiBr3 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Isopropanol was used as a counter solvent to precipitate NCs. The PL emission peak of Cs3Bi2X9 NCs is tunable in the range from 400 to 560 nm by halide substitution. The ligand-free Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs showed a low PLQY of 0.2% because of the fast-trapping time (2–20 ps). The PLQY can be drastically increased to 4.5% by using OA to passivate the trap states. The PLQY can be further enhanced to 22% by capping with octylammonium halide and oleic acid, which is 110 times that of ligand-free ones.22 Colloidal QDs of Cs3Bi2Br9 were also synthesized with ethanol instead of isopropanol. OLAM and OA were used to stabilize the colloidal solutions of Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs. In addition, the hydrolytic product BiOBr self-passivated Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs, which further enhanced the stability. The PL peaks of Cs3Bi2X9 QDs with different halide compositions can be tuned from 393 to 545 nm (Fig. 8a). Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs present a high PLQY of 19.4% with a FWHM of 48 nm at 410 nm. As Br was substituted by Cl, the PLQY increased to 26.4% and a wider FWHM of 59 nm was obtained. The possible reason is the passivation effect of Cl−. WLEDs were fabricated by combining blue-emissive Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs and yellow-emissive Y3Al5O12 (YAG) with violet-emissive GaN chips. A correlated color temperature of 8477.1 K and CIE color coordinates of (0.18, 0.03), (0.40, 0.57), and (0.29, 0.30) corresponding to the QD/silica, YAG and WLED were obtained.73 Cs3Bi2I9 QDs exhibit a fairly low PLQY because of the poor stability in air.72

The other frequently-used trivalent substitute of Pb is Sb. Zhang et al. synthesized Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs by replacing Pb2+ with Sb3+ by the LARP strategy. DMF or DMSO was selected as the solvent, and the antisolvent was octane. A tunable PL emission peak was achieved from 370 to 560 nm by varying the halide composition (Fig. 8b). The PLQY was determined to be 11% for Cs3Sb2Cl9 QDs, 23% for Cs3Sb2I9 QDs and 46% for Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs. In addition, air stability and photostability were tested to prove the good stability of Sb-perovskite QDs.75 Ma et al. successfully synthesized the Cs3Sb2X9 QDs by a modified solution supersaturated recrystallization approach. The PL spectrum demonstrated a broad spectral tunability region of 385–640 nm. More importantly, a satisfactory PLQY value of 51.2% was obtained in Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs without quick PL degradation. From this, for the first time, Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs based electrically driven violet LEDs were successfully fabricated with an EQE of ∼0.206% and remarkable working stability.76 The results highlight that lead-free Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs have great potential for use in LEDs with an environmentally-friendly and stable violet emitter.
As mentioned above, the photovoltaic performance of Sn-based perovskites is typically unsatisfactory because of their high defect density and poor stability. For CsSnX3, the PLQY was as low as 0.14 with tri-n-octylphosphine, oleylamine and oleic acid as ligands.64 Replacing Sn2+ with air-stable Sn4+ to form Cs2SnI6 NCs has been widely studied for relatively better stability. Wang et al. successfully synthesized Cs2SnI6 NCs by a hot-injection method. The morphology of the as-fabricated Cs2SnI6 NCs including spherical QDs, nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts and NPs can be tuned by the reaction time and ligands, as shown in Fig. 9a. The PLQY of the Cs2SnI6 NCs increased to 0.48%.4 In addition, Bi-doped Cs2SnCl6 NCs were fabricated with a PLQY up to 78.9% at 360 nm and the PL exhibited excellent stability under an ambient atmosphere (Fig. 9b). This is the highest PLQY ever reported for all inorganic lead-free perovskite. A wide FWHM of 66 nm and a large Stokes shift of 90 nm were also observed. The transient deformation of the crystal lattice resulted from the polarizable lattice in halide perovskite and resulting the so-called self-trapped excitons should be responsible for the wide FWHM and the large Stokes shift. Bi-doped Cs2SnCl6 NCs exhibit excellent stability due to the full inorganic composition, stable Sn(IV) and the formation of the BiOCl protective layer. Due to high PLQYs and excellent stability, they constructed WLEDs by mixing Cs2SnCl6:2.75% Bi with yellow phosphors (Ba2Sr2SiO4:Eu2+ and GaAlSiN3:Eu2+) and demonstrated that the Cs2SnCl6:Bi perovskites are promising for lighting applications.10

Double halide perovskite Cs2AgBiX6 NCs were formed by replacing Pb2+ cations with Ag+ and Bi3+ cations. Yang et al. synthesized high crystallinity Cs2AgBiX6 NCs by the LARP method with DMSO as the solvent and isopropanol as the anti-solvent. Cs2AgBiX6 NCs show a continuously tunable emission varying from 395 to 575 nm by modifying the halide composition. The same as Cs3Bi2X9, the PLQYs of Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiI6 are rather low (0.7 for Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs and 0.1 for Cs2AgBiI6 NCs, respectively), while the Cs2AgBiCl6 NCs exhibit a 100-fold improvement in the PLQY (6.7%) because Cl− can passivate the traps induced by surface defect.71
High PLQY is one of the prerequisites for perovskite materials to achieve optoelectric applications. However, the above values of lead-free perovskites are far behind those attained by lead-based ones. Another lead-free family of ternary copper halides has attracted great attention due to its potential applications in LEDs. The PL spectra of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs exhibit an intense emission at 445 nm with a line width of ∼63 nm. What's more, the PLQY of the Cs3Cu2I5 NCs reached ∼87%, which is much higher than that of lead-free perovskite NCs. Cs3Cu2I5 NC based LEDs were demonstrated with color coordinates of (0.16, 0.07) and a high EQE of 1.12%, which are comparable with the best-performing lead-halide perovskite based blue LEDs (Fig. 10).77

To better present the description above, Table 1 summarizes some representative optical properties of perovskite NCs, such as emission spectra/peaks, FWHMs and PLQYs. The results show that the substitution of Pb with low-toxic elements may reduce the photovoltaic performance of Pb-based perovskite. All the same, non-toxic, better structure stability of double perovskites and controllable dimensional changes of Bi-perovskites promote the study of lead-free perovskite.

Conclusions and outlook
In summary, we have discussed highly emissive lead and lead-free halide perovskite NCs, as well as synthesis methods, continuously tunable band gaps, FWHMs, PLQYs, etc. Typical methods for the synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals include ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP), emulsion processes, hot injection, template-assist, etc. Light emission peaks can be tuned over the entire visible region by controlling the halide composition or the size and shape of NCs. High PLQYs, narrow FWHMs, high exciton binding energies, color tunability, and facile solution-processing have inspired the application of perovskite NCs in LEDs with high color quality, purity, and white-light emission.
Despite the excellent optical properties of perovskite NCs, several challenges remain to be overcome.
(i) Foremost is the desire to address the poor stability of perovskite NCs caused by easy decomposition. They are extremely sensitive to oxygen, moisture, high temperature and electron beams. Most of the papers have focused on the properties of perovskites, whereas the related mechanisms have not yet been extensively investigated, which are important to prevent degradation from happening. At present, there are two main methods to solve the instability. One is changing their chemical composition to obtain a stable structure. The other is encapsulating NCs to prevent degradation. Thus, researchers should pay more attention to the study of the mechanism of stability and explore solutions to prevent degradation.
(ii) Apart from instability, eliminating or reducing the toxicity of lead is another urgent problem. Research efforts to exploit lead-free perovskite NCs have made great progress in the past few years. Non-toxic or low-toxicity cations, such as Sn(II), Sn(IV), Bi(III), and Sb(III), have been used as Pb substitutes to prepare lead-free halide perovskite NCs. Some of them exhibit high brightness, such as Cl-passivation of MA3Bi2Br9 QDs, Cs3Bi2Br9 capped by octylammonium halide and oleic acid, etc. Overall, however, the PLQY and stability of lead-free halide perovskites are inferior to those of lead halide perovskites. The degradation mechanism of lead-free perovskite NCs is currently lacking as well. In fact, the effect of non-radiative recombination processes and defects in lead-free perovskite is not clear yet. Further understanding of these mechanisms is of great significance for improving the PLQY and stability of lead-free perovskite NCs and further broadening their application in the fields of LEDs, solar cells, photodetectors, lasers, etc.
