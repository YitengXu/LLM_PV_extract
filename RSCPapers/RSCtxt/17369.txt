    , Accepted 12th March 2018First published on 13th March 2018AbstractPerovskite-phase cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9; X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals were synthesized using a hot-injection approach. These nanocrystals adopted ordered-vacancy perovskite crystal structures and demonstrated composition-tunable optical properties. Growth occurred by initial formation of Bi0 seeds, and morphology was controlled by precursor and seed concentration. The Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals demonstrated excellent stability under ambient conditions for several months. Contrary to previous reports, we find that photoluminescence originates from the precursor material as opposed to the Cs3Bi2X9 nanocrystals.
Halide perovskite compounds have generated interest as semiconductors with widely tunable properties that are compatible with inexpensive processing methods. The unique properties of halide perovskites show great potential for use in optoelectronic applications like photovoltaics (PVs). Halide perovskite materials typically have the general structure ABX3, with A as a cation (CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+, Cs+), B as a metal (Pb, Sn), and X as an anion (Cl−, Br−,I−). From ∼3.8% efficiency in 2009,1 the performance of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI)-based solar cells has increased rapidly to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 22% in 2017.2–9 MAPbI has several properties that contribute to this high performance in PVs – a direct bandgap of ∼1.5 eV, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, high defect-tolerance, and small exciton binding energies.10–16 However, stability and toxicity remain an issue for MAPbI and related halide perovskite semiconductors.17,18 It is well-known that exposure to moderate humidity, temperatures, or insolation can degrade MAPbI.19–23
Attempts to improve stability of halide perovskite PVs have typically involved partial or full substitution of the A-site cation and X-site anion.2,24–30 Using colloidal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) can also enhance stability.31 Swarnkar et al. processed halide perovskite NCs into thin films with enhanced stability.32 Perovskite CsPbI3 NCs adopt the black cubic perovskite phase (α-CsPbI3), which is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature in the bulk.33 The enhanced stability of the α-phase has been attributed to surface stabilization by the cationic ligands,34 though the NCs can eventually revert back to the yellow non-perovskite δ-phase35 which has poor optoelectronic properties.
In addition to addressing stability, there have been efforts to develop Pb-free halide perovskites. Alternatives to Pb include other 6s2 elements such as antimony and bismuth. Recently, bismuth halides and oxyhalides36,37 have demonstrated promise as PV materials, aided by the soft polarizability and defect tolerance of bismuth.38 Initial PV devices with BiI3 as the active layer possessed a PCE of 1%.36 Bismuth has also been incorporated into defect perovskites with formula A3B2X9. Cs3Bi2I9 films in hexagonal phase were incorporated into ∼1% efficient solar cells.39 NCs of bismuth based halides have been synthesized via room-temperature reaction40,41 and hot-injection.42 Work has also been done on synthesizing antimony halide NCs,43 showing promising photoluminescence quantum yield.44 In general, there is much promise for lead free halide NCs,45 motivating research into growth mechanisms to further enhance efforts to optimize these materials.
Given the feasibility of synthesizing cesium bismuth halide NCs, we investigated the hot-injection synthesis of Cs3Bi2X9 NCs, where X includes Cl, Br, and I, in order to elucidate the growth mechanism. To synthesize Cs3Bi2X9 NCs, we initially adapted the method for synthesizing CsPbI3 NCs developed Protesescu et al.,33 with modifications to the precursor stoichiometry (see ESI† for details). In a typical reaction, heated Cs-oleate was injected into a heated mixture of bismuth halide salt, octadecene (ODE), oleic acid (OA), and oleylamine (OLA). To quench reactions, room-temperature toluene was injected directly into the crude reaction mixture while stirring. To avoid degradation, the NCs were precipitated by simply centrifuging the NCs (see ESI† for details).
Bulk Cs3Bi2X9 is known to adopt an ordered-vacancy perovskite structure47 (Fig. 1b). The cubic ABX3 perovskite (Fig. 1a) has corner-sharing octahedra of PbX6, with the A-site cations in the cuboctahedral voids. The A3Bi2X9 structure, in contrast, has pairs of face-sharing BiX6 octahedra which form Bi2X93− dimer-like units. These double octahedron are surrounded by the A-site cations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of Cs3Bi2I9 NCs powders confirmed that the NCs synthesized here had this structure (Fig. 2a). The prominence of the (006) reflection compared to the (203), (204), and (205) reflections suggests that the nanocrystals grow anisotropically, with preferential growth along the c-axis.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that Cs3Bi2I9 NCs are faceted and polydisperse (39.5 ± 9.3 nm diameter) with regards to crystallite size (Fig. 2b). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) confirms that the Cs3Bi2I9 NCs are single crystals with an ordered defect perovskite structure (Fig. 2c). In many TEM images of Cs3Bi2X9 NCs, we observed the presence of small (<3 nm) particles; the lattice of these particles could not be resolved. We found that these small particles are formed in the BiI3/OA/OLA reaction precursor (Fig. 3a) before injecting Cs-oleate. This implies that these particles could be Bi0 seeds that form during the dissolution of BiI3. This is consistent with previous reports,48 where Pb0 seeds were found to form after the dissolution of PbI2 in a mixture of ODE, OA, and OLA. We hypothesize that these Bi0 seeds then react with injected Cs-oleate, with some control of growth afforded by variation in reactant concentration and additional ligands.

The Cs3Bi2I9 NC morphology was found to be sensitive to the ratio and concentration of Bi and Cs precursors used during synthesis. When using a near stoichiometric concentration of BiI3 and Cs-oleate ∼40 nm quasi-spherical NCs were formed (Fig. 3b). In this case, the reaction occurs under conditions of slight excess of Cs-oleate, possibly indicating that excess oleic acid ligands or Cs-oleate will facilitate the growth of spherical NCs over the more faceted NCs. This type of effect has been observed before – previous reports have demonstrated that the morphology of metal and metal chalcogenide NCs can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of alkali metal oleate precursor used during synthesis.49,50 We found that reducing the amount of BiI3 precursor results in a lower concentration of Bi0 nuclei, which could impact the growth and resulting size of the NCs, consistent with a previous report that found precursor concentration for Cs3Bi2X9 had an impact on resulting NC size.41 Using four times excess of BiI3 resulted in more faceted particles with higher polydispersity and the ubiquitous appearance of Bi0 metal seeds. In contrast, when an eight times excess of BiI3 was used, no additional change in the Cs3Bi2I9 NC morphology was observed (Fig. 3d). However, there was a larger concentration of small seed-like particles, supporting the proposed mechanism of formation of Bi0 seeds.
These results imply that the growth of the Cs3Bi2X9 NCs is initiated by the number of Bi0 nuclei; we hypothesize further control over size and morphology could be obtained by controlling the number of these nuclei in solution. In support of this hypothesis, we found that aging the BiI3/ODE/OA/OLA precursor prior to the injection of Cs-oleate promotes the formation of anisotropic long rectangular NCs (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The morphology of the Cs3Bi2X9 NCs can be further tuned by introducing different capping ligands during synthesis. For example, we found that including trioctylphosphine (TOP) into the precursor mixture resulted in a higher concentration of rectangular NCs (Fig. S1, ESI†). This could indicate that TOP attaches to specific facets of the Cs3Bi2I9 NCs during nucleation and growth. Similar anisotropic growth was reported for CsPbI3 NCs that were synthesized in a reaction mixture containing polar molecules.48 Udayabhaskararao et al.48 deduced that the polar environment in the CsPbI3 NC reaction mixture facilitated amine protonation, with ammonium species acting to passivate surfaces51 and preferentially bind to replace the Cs+ ions. It is possible that a similar mechanism could explain our observed morphology when adding TOP, which is moderately polar. However, given that aging the TOP-free precursor also results in the appearance of long rectangular nanostructures (Fig. S2, ESI†) and considering that TOP is a reducing agent, adding TOP to the reaction mixture may accelerate the formation of Bi0 seeds, simulating what would occur in an “aged” precursor.
We found that changing the reaction temperature had little effect on the size or shape of the Cs3Bi2I9 NCs (Fig. S3, ESI†). Increasing reaction time resulted in a relatively small increase in particle size. Based on our studies of reaction time, it appears that the NC size and shape are rapidly defined within the first few seconds of reaction (Fig. S4, ESI†).
The Cs3Bi2I9 NCs demonstrate remarkable stability under ambient storage conditions for long periods of time. The characteristic absorbance peak at 489 nm remains unchanged for at least 100 days when stored in a vial outside the glovebox after exposure to ambient conditions and the XRD pattern matches to the Cs3Bi2I9 reference (Fig. S5, ESI†). In contrast CsPbI3 NCs have been reported to degrade in a few days once exposed to air.48 This stability makes Cs3Bi2I9 NCs promising for incorporation into highly stable optoelectronic devices.
The synthesis method could be extended to other halides (TEM shown in Fig S6, ESI†) by using different BiX3 salts. Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs exhibited a similar morphology to Cs3Bi2I9, but the Cs3Bi2Cl9 NCs formed rectangular nanoplatelets. It was observed that the Cs3Bi2I9 had the fewest number of Bi0 seeds at concentrations equivalent to the other halides – this may be due to solubility differences between the BiX3 salts. The BiI3 was the most readily soluble. By varying composition, the absorbance maximum of the Cs3Bi2X9 NCs (where X indicates either single- or mixtures of halides) could be tuned between 331 (X = Cl) and 489 nm (X = I) as seen in Fig. S7a (ESI†).
We noticed that mixed halide NCs (X = Br, I or Br, Cl) had broader absorption peaks compared to single-halide NCs. This implies that the mixed-halide NCs may be a mixture of single-halide NCs rather than mixed-halide alloy NCs; however, in TEM only a single morphology is observed (Fig. S7b and c, ESI†). This behaviour is markedly different than CsPbX3 NCs, which are known to readily exchange halides even with other halide-containing NCs in colloidal dispersions.52,53 The apparent inability to synthesize mixed-halide Cs3Bi2X9 NCs could be explained by differences in mobility of anions in the defect perovskite structure, differences in B–X bond energies, or differences in precursor decomposition kinetics.
The measurement and investigation of PL properties and improvement of PL quantum yield is the subject of ongoing research, with the expectation that the predicted excellent defect-tolerance of Cs3Bi2X954 should result in easily detectable PL with decent PL quantum yield. However, initial results have shown that PL observed in the reaction products is also found in the reaction precursor prior to injection of Cs-oleate (Fig. 4). While similar trends in PL have been reported in other manuscripts40–42 the true origin of this PL is unclear, given the difficulty in separating the precursor material from the resulting nanoparticles via centrifugation and the lack of analysis of the precursors in the aforementioned literature.

In conclusion, we report the synthesis of Cs3Bi2X9 NCs with an ordered-vacancy halide perovskite composition, identified factors that influence size and morphology, and characterized their composition-tunable optical properties. The growth mechanism was found to have similarities to that of CsPbI3 NCs, where growth is initiated by Bi0 metal seeds that subsequently react with injected Cs-oleate. The widely-tunable absorbance and air stability of these Cs3Bi2X9 NCs shows an important step toward stable and efficient Pb-free perovskite optoelectronic devices.
