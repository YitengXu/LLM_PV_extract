    , Accepted 10th January 2011First published on 4th February 2011AbstractA strategy for reduction of CO2 is described that produces formic acid from CO2 (ca. 80% formic acid yield) via the oxidation of a zero-valent metal under hydrothermal conditions. The oxidized metal can be regenerated using glycerin, which produces lactic acid. Hydrogen production is demonstrated through metal oxidation in the presence of CO2 with zero-valent Fe, Mn, Zn, and Al metals under hydrothermal conditions, where it is found that a maximum hydrogen formation yield of ca. 99.4% was achieved. The metals, once oxidized, could be readily reduced (ca. 100% for Fe) to their zero-valent state by contact with glycerin. The results demonstrate that a carbon cycle can be driven by the oxidation and reduction of commonly available metals.

Broader context
Methods for CO2 reduction are urgently needed to reduce CO2 emissions and to minimize global warming. In this study, high-yield reduction of carbon dioxide into formic acid by a zero-valent metal/metal oxide redox cycle is demonstrated. In the cycle, carbon dioxide is reduced to formic acid via oxidation of a metal under hydrothermal conditions. The metal oxide is regenerated to its zero-valent state by oxidation of glycerin. The results show that a carbon cycle can be driven by the oxidation and reduction of commonly available metals. The proposed cycle has many advantages over water-splitting cycles that include: (i) no excess oxygen requirements since oxygen is recycled chemically, (ii) no hydrogen requirements including pumps or storage, because hydrogen is derived from water and is reacted with CO2 in-situ, (iii) no exotic catalysts or harsh reagents usage, because CO2 promotes in-situ hydrogen production, and (iv) no direct electrical requirements, since the cycle uses chemical energy in the oxidation and reduction steps and the cycle is exothermic.

Hydrothermal chemistry has played an important role in via Fischer–Tropsch-, Strecker–Sabatier- and other-type mechanisms1 and is essential in promoting circulation of carbon throughout the Earth. For example, geochemical reduction-oxidation (redox) couples in the mantle2 and in hydrothermal vents via the H2-CO2 redox couple3 provide the necessary environment for abiogenic hydrocarbon formation via serpentinization.4 Studies on CO2 and H2-bearing aqueous fluids in the presence of magnetite,5 cobalt-bearing magnetite,6 iron-chromium oxide,7 or formic acid aqueous solutions in the presence of pentlandite ((Fe2Ni7)S8),8 show that CO2 can be reduced through many reaction pathways. Thus, if redox couples in nature could be combined with hydrothermal methods being studied for material conversions,9 an efficient scheme could be realized to recycle carbon and produce chemicals. Methods for CO2 reduction would help to reduce the amount of CO2 linked to global warming10 with the exception of CO2 in geological storage.11
In this work, we present a strategy for reducing CO2 under hydrothermal conditions with zero-valent metal (M0) that produces formic acid and hydrogen via the oxidation of the M0and chemical products such as lactic acid via the reduction of the metal oxide (MOx) with the input of a suitable organic chemical such as glycerin (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Carbon cycles with biochemicals as reductants via metal/metal oxide redox cycles. 
In the first step of the cycle, water is used as the sole source of hydrogen for reduction of CO2 and the M0 undergoes oxidation to MOx. In the second step, the MOx is regenerated to M0 by using an organic chemical as reductant (Fig. 1). The overall reaction of the cycle for the case of glycerin reductant can be represented as follows: CO2 + C3H8O3 → HCOOH + C3H6O3(1)
Theoretically, formic acid produced in the CO2 reduction step could be used in powering fuel cells,12 while the lactic acids formed in the metal regeneration step could be used for making biopolymers.13 The power required for driving the cycle could be obtained through solar energy, since the input chemicals can be from bioresources and the overall reaction (eqn (1)) is exothermic (see ESI†). As discussed later, the conversion of iron oxide and glycerin is close to 100% and thus the atom efficiency is very high for the cycle (see ESI†).
To examine the possibility of the first step, formation of H2 from water under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of zero-valent metals Zn, Al, Fe, Mn and Ni was examined for the case in which CO2 was supplied in the form of bicarbonate. In the absence of CO2, no hydrogen was produced with Fe or Ni (Table 1). In the presence of CO2, hydrogen was not produced when using Ni (Table 1, entry 2), however, hydrogen was formed in quantity when Fe was used. Furthermore, the increase in the initial amount of CO2 supplied led to a clear increase in the hydrogen production (Table 1, entries 5–7). These observations show that CO2 promoted oxidation of Fe to allow the formation of hydrogen from water. For Mn, Zn and Al, hydrogen was formed both in the absence and in the presence of CO2 (Table 1). The CO2 supplied in the form of bicarbonate readily promoted the formation of hydrogen from water with a ca. 99.4% maximum hydrogen formation yield.

CO2 reduction with Fe, Zn, Al and Mn under hydrothermal conditions was investigated and formic acid formed in all cases (Fig. S3†). When Zn was used (Fig. 2A), formic acid yields of ca. 75 C-% were obtained. For Al, yields of ca. 65 C-% (percent carbon basis) were obtained. The selectivity of formic acid on a carbon basis was close to 100%. The relative efficiencies of the metals for converting CO2 into formic acid (Fig. 2), defined as the molar ratio of HCOOH/metal, were Al > Zn ≫ Mn > Fe, which was almost the same as their activities.
 Fig. 2  Effect of (A) the ratio of metal reductant to the initial CO2 (573 K, 120 min), (B) reaction temperature (120 min) and (C) reaction time (573 K) on the formic acid yield as defined in Table 1 (NaHCO3 = 1 mmol). 
To assess systematic deviations due to reactor walls, experiments were performed with Teflon-lined vessels. Formic acid yields were low in the absence of Ni when Fe or Mg was used, but increased in the presence of Ni (Table 2, entries 1, 2), showing that Ni catalyzed the formation of formic acid from CO2. The formic acid yield decreased when using either Zn or Al (Table 2, entries 3, 10, 11) showing that Ni catalyzed the decomposition of formic acid into methane, which was verified by analysis using gas chromatography. Although wall effects do exist, their influence on the results could be understood and thus they do not affect the conclusions relating to the proposed cycle.

To examine the possibility that other metals may be more efficient than Ni for promoting the formation of formic acid from CO2, Cu, Co, C (graphite), ZnO, Al2O3, Fe3O4 and TiO2 were investigated. It was found that Cu promoted the formation of formic acid, and that the catalytic activity of Cu was significantly higher than Ni (Table 2), entries 5–8 and Fig. S4†). In the presence of Cu, a formic acid yield of 48% could be achieved (Table 2, entry 8), which is the highest formic acid yield from CO2 that has been obtained to date with Fe0 reductant under hydrothermal conditions.
In the second step of the cycle, glycerin was selected as being suitable to reduce the metal oxides, since it is available from renewable resources. Experiments with FeCl2·4H2O and glycerin were conducted at 553 K in the presence of NaOH without water to avoid re-oxidation of Fe0. In experiments using a glass reactor, Fe0 did not form. However, when the reaction system was studied with a pressurized SUS 316 tube reactor, Fe0 formed as shown in Fig. 3 (A). At 523 K (Fig. 3 (B)), only the Fe peak was observed, indicating that all Fe2+ was reduced. Experiments with FeCl3 showed that Fe3+ could be reduced into Fe0 (Fig. 3 (C)). The case for FeCl3 may be very complex as it may form Fe(OH)3 or FeOOH based on the reaction conditions. However, it was found that not only Fe2+, but also Fe3+, could be readily reduced to Fe0 using glycerin.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the solid residue after the reaction with FeCl2·4H2O (A, 553 K, B, 523 K), FeCl3 (C, 523 K), Fe(OH)3 (D and E, 523 K), Fe(OH)3 obtained by dissolving the reduced Fe3O4 after 5 cycles into first HCl and then NaOH (F, 523), or Fe(OH)3 with glycerin mixture (G) and glycerin for 30 min using Cu-Kα with a wavelength of 0.15481 nm. Besides E, all results were obtained using the SUS reactor. The results for E were obtained using the Teflon-lined reactor. 
The reaction products of glycerin and FeCl2·4H2O or FeCl3 were analyzed and the liquid solution was found to contain mostly lactic acid (Fig. S5 A†) that had a concentration of over 95% after subtracting residual glycerin in the liquid phase. The gas phase contained only hydrogen. The lactic acid yield reached 82 C-%. The mechanism for Fe reduction probably involves a glycerin alkoxide transition (Fig. S2†) to give the overall reaction: C3H8O3 + Fe(OH)x → C3H6O3 + Fe0 + xH2O(2)
An experiment that used Fe(OH)3 directly as the starting material showed that the reduction of Fe3+ into Fe0 went closer to completion than when using FeCl3 (Fig. 3 (D)), which means that glycerin might react directly with Fe(OH)3 as shown in eqn (2). Experiments with a Teflon-lined reactor using Fe(OH)3 as a starting material showed that Fe(OH)3 was also completely reduced into Fe0 (Fig. 3 (E)), demonstrating the lack of wall effects for reduction of Fe2+ or Fe3+ to Fe0 using glycerin. The examination of the kinetic effect of the reduction of Fe3+ into Fe0 at 250 °C with reaction time from 5 min to 30 min showed that the reaction rate of the reduction of Fe3+ is fast, and most of the Fe3+ is converted into Fe0 in 10 min with complete conversion being reached in 30 min (see Fig. S6†).
To demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the cycle, we conducted experiments with the reduced Fe0 obtained by reducing Fe(OH)x with glycerin at 523 K for 30 min. The Fe(OH)x was obtained by reaction of the oxidized Fe3O4, under optimal conditions for producing formic acid in the presence of Cu (Table 2 entry 8). Iron was cycled 5 times. Results showed that the formic acid yield with the reduced Fe0 after 5 cycles was almost the same as that with Fe0 reagent with 200-mesh (Table 2 entry 12). The XRD pattern of the reduced Fe0 after 5 cycles was almost the same as that of the Fe0 reagent (Fig. 3 (F) and S 7†). Particle distribution of the reduced Fe0 was finer than Fe powder with 200-mesh (Table S3 and Fig. S8†). Analysis of the dissolved amount of iron in the liquid samples with an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometer showed that the amount of dissolved iron in the solution was low (ca. 3 × 10−3%), which means that there was practically no loss of iron. Further experiments were performed using glycerin solutions containing CH3OH, methyl ester and free acids in glycerin (ratios given in Table S 4†) to examine the effect of impurities that might be contained in crude glycerin. The results showed that the iron obtained by the crude glycerin solutions was almost the same as that for the case of when pure glycerin was used (see Fig. 3 (G)). Examination of the additives after reaction showed that the methyl ester itself underwent no changes although some CH3OH was oxidized into formic acid as shown by the increase in formic acid concentration that occurred when the crude glycerin solutions were used (Fig. S9†).
A possible mechanism for hydrogen generation with Fe0 is: Fe0 + CO2 + H2O → FeCO3 + H2(3) 3FeCO3 + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2 + 3CO2(4)
Fe0 first reacts with CO2 and H2O to form FeCO3, which undergoes decomposition to form Fe3O4 and CO2 (see the ESI†) and thus CO2 has a catalytic role. As shown in Table 1, the hydrogen yield (YH2) of Fe in the presence of CO2 was more than 50%. For Mn, besides Mn3O4, MnCO3 was also formed (Fig. S1 (C)†), indicating that some metals react with CO2 to form stable carbonates under hydrothermal conditions. For Zn and Al, the corresponding oxides ZnO and AlO(OH) were detected (Fig. S1 (D) and (E)†) thus these lead to hydrogen formation through the loss of water molecules. Although the mechanism of hydrogen production with Zn and Al might seem to be unrelated to CO2, the hydrogen yield, YH2, increased in the presence of CO2, and a YH2 of nearly 100% was obtained in the presence of CO2 (Table 1, entries 13 and 16). The mechanism of improving hydrogen production for these metals can probably be explained as the shift of the reaction (eqn (5)) to the right to form the oxide due to consumption of hydrogen in the presence of CO2. (5)
The proposed carbon cycle can be compared with some of those in the literature. Others have proposed to use Fe0 as a reducing agent for CO2 but have only demonstrated low formic acid yields.14 Chemical-looping, which uses metal oxides for the oxygen source, employs hydrocarbons as reductants to reduce the metal oxides and oxidize hydrocarbons efficiently in power generation systems.15 The proposed cycle has many advantages over water-splitting cycles that include: (i) no excess oxygen requirements since oxygen is recycled chemically (Fig. 1), (ii) no hydrogen requirements including pumps or storage,16 because hydrogen is derived from water and is reacted with CO2in situ, (iii) no exotic catalysts or use of harsh reagents, because CO2 promotes in situ hydrogen production (Table 1), and (iv) no direct electrical requirements, since the cycle uses chemical energy in the oxidation and reduction steps and the cycle is exothermic.
In conclusion, a carbon cycle can be achieved by using the oxidative potential of zero-valent metals to reduce CO2 to formic acid in the presence of water and the reductive potential of bio-derived chemicals such as glycerin to reduce the oxidized metal oxides to their zero-valent state for recycling. The cycle can be expected to have low energy requirements because it is exothermic and the inputs are commonly available materials described here as zero-valent metals and bio-derived chemicals. The proposed cycle is simple, efficient, and robust as evident from the following points:
(i) it requires neither elaborately prepared catalysts nor expensive reagents,
(ii) it requires neither hydrogen gas nor high purity CO2 and obtains high conversions on the order of minutes,
(iii) it requires neither high purity reagents nor pure solvents as demonstrated by the use of recycled zero-valent iron catalyst and crude glycerin reductant.

Methods for CO2 reduction are urgently needed to reduce CO2 emissions and to minimize global warming. In this study, high-yield reduction of carbon dioxide into formic acid by a zero-valent metal/metal oxide redox cycle is demonstrated. In the cycle, carbon dioxide is reduced to formic acid via oxidation of a metal under hydrothermal conditions. The metal oxide is regenerated to its zero-valent state by oxidation of glycerin. The results show that a carbon cycle can be driven by the oxidation and reduction of commonly available metals. The proposed cycle has many advantages over water-splitting cycles that include: (i) no excess oxygen requirements since oxygen is recycled chemically, (ii) no hydrogen requirements including pumps or storage, because hydrogen is derived from water and is reacted with CO2 in-situ, (iii) no exotic catalysts or harsh reagents usage, because CO2 promotes in-situ hydrogen production, and (iv) no direct electrical requirements, since the cycle uses chemical energy in the oxidation and reduction steps and the cycle is exothermic.
