    , Accepted 18th May 2016First published on 18th May 2016AbstractSustainable and efficient conversion of solar energy to transportable green energy and storable fuels, hydrogen, represents a solution to the energy crisis and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels, which are mainly responsible for the rise in global temperature. Solar water splitting using semiconductors, such as silicon, is promising to satisfy the global energy demand by producing hydrogen molecules. However, the solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of a silicon photoelectrode is suppressed by overpotential, high reflectance and/or instability in liquid electrolytes. Herein, we report the synthesis of multifunctional solution-processed TiO2 nanorods on a 4-inch p-silicon wafer with controllable heights and diameters for highly efficient water splitting photocathodes. The solution-processed passivation layer of TiO2 nanorods reduces the overpotential of the silicon photocathode due to its catalytic properties. The TiO2 NRs also dramatically improves the light absorption of silicon due to the antireflective ability of the nanorods. The reflectance of silicon is decreased from 37.5% to 1.4% and enhances the saturated photocurrent density. The Pt-decorated (1–2.5 nm diameter) TiO2 nanorods/p-Si photocathodes show a short circuit current density of up to 40 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage ∼440 mV and incident photon to current conversion efficiency of >90% using 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with simulated 1 sun irradiation. The heterostructure photocathodes are stable for more than 52 h without noticeable degradation and an ideal regenerative cell efficiency of 2.5% is achieved.
Introduction
The search for an alternative and inexpensive source of green energy is vital to reduce the rate of increase of global temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and to diminish the use of limited fossil fuels.1,2 Water and solar energy are inexhaustible and widely distributed natural resources. Integrating these abundant resources with efficient photoactive materials for hydrogen production is among the best options to satisfy the global energy demand and mitigate global warming caused by fossil fuel burning.3–5 Among the various photoelectrodes researched for SWS to date,4,6–10 silicon is one of the most widely studied materials since it has a suitable optical band gap (1.12 eV) to absorb the widest part of the solar spectrum (visible light), as shown in Fig. 1a, and generates a sufficient amount of energy for water splitting (2H2O + hν → 2H2 + O2). However, silicon photoelectrodes suffer from photocorrosion in liquid electrolytes due to the position of their thermodynamic redox potentials, which are in close proximity to the redox potential of water (H+/H2)/(O2/H2O).11 Silicon photoelectrodes may corrode through photoelectrochemical, electrochemical and chemical routes. The first two routes require net charge transfer between the photoelectrode and electrolyte, whereas the chemical corrosion involves reactions that cause degradation/dissolution of the electrode materials without the necessity of net charge transfer between the electrode and the electrolyte solution.12 The corrosion causes surface defects that enhance the recombination rate and facilitate the formation of an insulator, i.e., an oxide layer, at the surface. A thick oxide layer can inhibit the transfer of minority carriers from silicon to the electrolyte solution and/or from the electrolyte to silicon.12 Moreover, silicon has a refractive index, shown in Fig. 1c, at visible light wavelengths, ∼37% of the incident light is reflected in air.13–15 The severe photocorrosion and the high reflectance of silicon can jeopardize the solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) and hinders prolonged operation of the electrode.16

Recent research on silicon photoelectrodes has focused on designing a surface passivation layer that protects against chemical and/or photo-induced corrosion without degrading the inherent photoactive ability of silicon.5,14,17–21 Although many materials have been studied as a passivation layer for silicon photoelectrodes, the reported efficiencies are not economically viable5,22–24 because the high reflectance of planar silicon was not seriously considered. In addition, the low efficiencies could be related to poor interfacial contacts between silicon and the protective layer and/or inappropriate selection of materials in terms of work function and band gap offsets. A significant improvement in the onset potential and stability of the silicon photocathode was reported using an epitaxially grown strontium titanate (SrTiO3) protective layer with Pt/Ti thin film catalysts.17 Likewise, a thermally grown SiO2 interfacial tunnelling layer between a Pt/Ti thin film and (100) p-type silicon shows a better onset potential for reducing water but a low photocurrent density.18 TiO2 thin films have been widely studied to passivate silicon photoelectrodes.12 Seger et al.,20 reported 72 h stability with a 520 mV onset potential for a silicon photocathode using a conductive TiO2 thin film and 1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The TiO2 thin film could improve the performance of the p-InP photocathode due to the large valance band offset between the photoactive material and the passivation layer.25 We emphasize that the complex synthesis of the protection layer and the usage of the noble metal thin film catalysts increase the cost of H2 production per kilogram.26–29 Herein, we report the synthesis and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of TiO2 nanorods (NRs) on a 4-inch p-type silicon (Si) photocathode by a facile and cheap hydrothermal method, in which the diameter and length of NRs are tailored. The solution-processed passivation layer of TiO2 NRs reduces the overpotential of silicon for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the catalytic behaviour of the synthesised oxide layer. We show that TiO2 nanorods dramatically reduce the light reflectance at the electrolyte/TiO2 NR/p-Si interfaces and protect the Si photoelectrode from photo-induced corrosion. A TiO2 NR/p-Si photocathode decorated with Pt nanoparticles (1–2.5 nm in diameter) exhibits state-of-the art PEC performance in terms of overpotential, saturation photocurrent, and long-term stability.
Effects of TiO2 nanorods on p-Si
TiO2 is an n-type wide band gap semiconductor with a band gap energy of 3.0–3.2 eV. When deposited on a p-Si substrate, an n-TiO2/p-Si heterojunction is formed. Since the electron affinity of p-Si (XSi ≈ 4.0 eV)30 is smaller than that of TiO2 (XTiO2 ≈ 4.3–4.5 eV)31,32 and the work function of p-Si (Φp-Si ≈ 4.9 eV) is slightly higher than that of TiO2 (ΦTiO2 ≈ 4.6–4.8 eV),33–39 the offset between the conduction band minimums and the downward band banding facilitates the transport of photogenerated minority carriers (electrons) from p-Si through TiO2 to the location where hydrogen ions are reduced. Simultaneously the majority (holes) carriers travel to the back contact of the photocathode, as shown in Fig. 1b. Since TiO2 exhibits high transmittance of visible light, most of the illuminated sunlight reaches the silicon. It is noted that the TiO2 layer (reflective index, nTiO2 ∼ 2.64 at 550 nm)40 suppresses the Fresnel reflection at the electrolyte/p-Si (nSi ∼ 4.09 at 550 nm)41 interface over a broad range of wavelengths. In addition, TiO2 itself has catalytic properties for water splitting, excellent chemical stability and no toxicity.11,42
Use of TiO2 NRs rather than a planar TiO2 layer on p-Si has several advantages. TiO2 NRs, which have a much larger surface area than the planar layer, have an increased number of reaction sites for the HER. TiO2 NRs can further reduce light reflection at the electrolyte/p-Si interface compared with a planar TiO2. If the areal density of TiO2 NRs changes gradually (denser at the bottom than at the top), the incident light is propagated into the p-Si substrate with negligible reflection at both electrolyte/TiO2 NR and TiO2 NR/p-Si interfaces, as shown in Fig. 1b. When the areal density near the top surface of NRs approaches zero, then the refractive index of the top surface is expected to become identical to that of the electrolyte, leading to perfect antireflection at the interface, as shown in Fig. 1d.
To achieve the desired density gradient in TiO2 NRs, we used a hydrothermal method. At the beginning of the synthesis of TiO2 NRs on p-Si with a 5 nm-thick TiO2 seed layer, the concentrations of the precursors are high enough for nucleation and growth of TiO2 NRs, and thus the areal density of TiO2 NRs is high. As the synthesis time increases, the concentrations of the precursors decrease, since little amount of the precursor was used to nucleate and form TiO2 NRs on the surface of silicon. For sufficient growth time, the density of TiO2 NRs could decrease from the bottom to the top. Furthermore, the fully grown TiO2 NRs could dissolve gradually for an extended growth time at higher temperatures in the acidic solution, which also results in the change of areal density from the bottom to the top. Therefore, the areal density of NRs becomes smaller with increasing length of NRs, leading to density gradients in the TiO2 NRs. We have grown TiO2 NRs with different morphologies on p-Si substrates using a solution-processed hydrothermal method. By controlling the synthesis time and temperature, we could tune the diameters and heights of TiO2 NRs, as shown in Fig. S1† that corroborates the previous work on TiO2 NRs on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate.43 Using fixed concentrations of the precursors, a higher synthesis temperature and longer synthesis time resulted in thinner and longer TiO2 NRs.
Results and discussion
Microstructure and optical properties of synthesized TiO2 nanorods on p-Si
We have successfully demonstrated the growth of TiO2 NRs on 4-inch Si wafers. The TiO2 NRs were grown uniformly over the entire wafer. The p-Si wafers with TiO2 NRs became dark blue-black in colour due to highly enhanced diffuse scattering, as shown in Fig. 2a. Even after Pt deposition on the TiO2 NR/p-Si wafers using electron-beam evaporation, there was no noticeable colour change. Each NR tilts from the surface in the normal direction of the substrate. Lengths of the NRs changed from 100 to 2000 nm and diameters are in the range of 30–50 nm, as seen in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 2b–d. The total thickness of the TiO2 NR layer was measured to be ∼1.2 μm over the substrate. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images in Fig. 2e–i revealed that Pt nanoparticles (∼2.5 nm in diameter), which were invisible by SEM, decorated the surface of TiO2 NRs. The synthesized TiO2 NRs were rutile, which is consistent with the results of X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. S2†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated the existence of –OH and –H2O bonds on the TiO2 surface, which may facilitate adsorption of H+ ions for the HER (Fig. S3†).44,45

The optical reflectance of the synthesized samples at 400 to 1200 nm was measured. The reflectance of bare p-Si, TiO2 seed layer/p-Si, and TiO2 NR/p-Si samples is shown in Fig. 3a–c. Bare p-Si and TiO2 seed layer/p-Si samples showed similar reflectance values to the incident light. The reflectance values of p-Si and TiO2 seed layer/p-Si samples for an incident angle of 40° at 550 nm were 37.5% and 34.4%, respectively. In contrast, the light reflectance of the TiO2 NR/p-Si sample was very low. The dramatic reduction of reflectance in the TiO2 NR/p-Si sample compared with p-Si and TiO2 seed layer/p-Si samples is highlighted in Fig. 3d and e. For example, the reflectance of the TiO2 NR/p-Si sample was 1.4% for an incident angle of 40° at a wavelength of 550 nm. Such a dramatic reduction in light reflectance in the TiO2 NR/p-Si sample would enhance the solar energy conversion efficiency of the photoelectrode.

PEC properties
All linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of bare p-Si (S1), TiO2 seed layer (5 nm)/p-Si (S2), TiO2 NR/p-Si (S3), Pt/p-Si (S4), Pt/TiO2 seed layer (5 nm)/p-Si (S5) and Pt/TiO2 NR/p-Si (S6) samples studied in this paper were measured using a single compartment glass cell with a three electrode set-up and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte without any sacrificial reagent and stirrer (Fig. 4a). The average exposed area of photocathodes to the electrolyte solution is about 0.5 cm2. The S1 sample showed an onset potential of about −0.75 V [the voltages provided are relative to the RHE, unless noted otherwise] and the saturated current density was ∼32 mA cm−2, which is similar to previous reports.46–48 After the 5 nm-thick TiO2 film was deposited over p-Si using an electron-beam evaporator, the onset potential is anodically shifted by 0.25 V and the saturated current density is increased by ∼1 mA cm−2. The improvement is attributed to the catalytic properties of the TiO2 layer and the slight reduction in the light reflectance. The S3 sample shows an anodic shift of ∼0.75 V and the increment of the saturated current density by ∼8 mA cm−2 compared to the S1 sample. However, when the S3 sample was annealed at 500 °C for 1 h under ambient air, the PEC performance decreased markedly (Fig. S4†). The annealed TiO2 NR/p-Si sample exhibited a hump in the middle of the LSV curve, which is a result of the high series resistance of the TiO2 layer. The hydrothermally grown TiO2 NRs, which are probably nonstoichiometric and defective,49,50 allow the transfer of carriers through the oxide layer with a small potential drop. This finding corroborates previous reports that the as-grown TiO2 films exhibited better water splitting ability than annealed TiO2 films.19,20 The LSV curves were converted to Tafel plots, and the potentials were plotted as functions of the logarithm of current density (Fig. S5†). The linear portions of the curves were collected to determine the Tafel slopes. With the TiO2 NRs, the Tafel slope decreased from 178 mV dec−1 to 123 mV dec−1. Water reduction for the evolution of hydrogen occurs by the accepted three-step mechanism, i.e., the Volmer (Tafel slope of 120 mV dec−1 in an acidic electrolyte), Heyrovsky (40 mV dec−1), and Tafel (30 mV dec−1) steps.51–53 The Tafel slope of 123 mV dec−1 for the TiO2 NR/p-Si sample indicates that the HER occurred by the Volmer reaction with this cathode structure. The short circuit photocurrent density of the TiO2 NR/p-Si photocathode is 40 mA cm−2, which is the highest photocurrent ever reported for photocathodes based on planar p-Si for solar water splitting.17,20,48 However, at −0.4 V, the current density is about 45 mA cm−2 which is slightly higher than the theoretical limit current density of crystalline silicon, i.e., 44 mA cm−2.54 The large increase in photocurrent is attributed to the antireflective properties of the density-graded uniform TiO2 NR layer. Moreover, the antireflective layer, TiO2 NRs, could absorb a UV light better than silicon and thus probably contribute to the total current density of the photocathode (Video S1†).

The decoration of Pt nanoparticles significantly improved the onset potentials of the three samples (Video S2†). The saturated current densities of S4, S5 and S6 samples were ∼33 mA cm−2, 32 mA cm−2 and 40 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. a reference hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. The variation of current density in the negative potential regions of each electrode originates from the hydrogen bubbling on the surface of photocathodes. The saturated photocurrent density was not affected by Pt decoration because the amount of deposited Pt nanoparticles was very small; the nominal thickness of Pt deposited by electron-beam deposition was 0.3 nm. After the Pt decoration, the Tafel slope of the S6 sample was evaluated to be 49 mV dec−1, which indicates that the Pt nanoparticles promote the HER on the surface of TiO2 NRs by the Heyrovsky reaction mechanism.51–53 We performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to elucidate the charge-transfer resistances in the S2, S3, S5 and S6 samples. The external bias voltages for the EIS measurements of the samples were selected by considering the onset potentials of the individual samples. The S2 sample showed a single semicircle in the Nyquist plot due to the negligible series resistance of the thin TiO2 layer. The other three samples displayed two semicircles, as shown in Fig. 4b and c. The measured data were fitted to the equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 4b, consisting of constant phase elements (CPEs) associated with the Si substrate (CPESi) and the TiO2 layer (CPETiO2) and charge-transfer resistances (Rct) from the Si to TiO2 (Rct_Si) and from TiO2 to the redox couples in the electrolyte (Rct_TiO2). The first semicircles in the Nyquist plot yield Rct_Si, whereas the second semicircles are related to Rct_TiO2. The charge-transfer resistances obtained from the fittings are summarized in Table 1. The Rct_TiO2 of the S3 sample (346 Ω cm2) was still lower than that of the S2 sample (505.97 Ω cm2), confirming that the electron transfer from the as-grown TiO2 NRs to the redox couples where protons were reduced was indeed enhanced. After the TiO2 surface was decorated with Pt nanoparticles, Rct_TiO2 decreased to 20.3 Ω cm2 for the S5 sample and 51.96 Ω cm2 for the S6. Following Pt decoration, Rct_Si also decreased because the charge transfer between the TiO2 and the electrolyte affects the charge transfer between the p-Si and the TiO2.

The LSV curve of S6 samples (pink colour) in Fig. 4a shows the potential at the maximum power point (Vmp) and current density at the maximum power point (Jmp) of the photocathode and was used to calculate the ideal regenerative cell efficiency (ηIRC) of the photoelectrode which is suggested by Robert H. Coridan et al.55 to identify the efficiency of the system. The ideal regenerative cell efficiency is given by: (1)where J is the photocurrent density at zero bias, Is the intensity of illuminated light (100 mW cm−2) and ff is the fill factor. The calculated ideal regenerative cell efficiency for the S6 samples is 2.5% which is smaller than that of the p-Si passivated by SrTiO3 (4.9%),17 considering that the ideal regenerative cell efficiency of a three-electrode system and the applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of a two-electrode system are comparable. However, our photocathode showed a 37% higher photocurrent density at 0.0 V vs. RHE and extended stability.
The dark current is 0.0 mA cm−2 even at −1.2 V vs. RHE and the photocurrent density is higher than 40 mA cm−2 above 0.0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4d). The slight decrease in the photocurrent toward highly negative potentials is due to the crowded hydrogen bubbling at the surface of TiO2 NRs. Boettcher et al.,48 reported Si-based photocathodes with the photocurrent saturation within ∼100 mV vs. RHE. Our photocathode doesn't reach the photocurrent saturation within ∼100 mV probably due to the non-uniform distribution of Pt catalysts on the surface. With the chopped light, we could measure the open circuit voltage of the photocathode. The open circuit voltage was ∼440 mV, which is similar to the potential difference (∼0.45 eV) between the Fermi level and the middle of the band energy of p-Si. The ability of a photocathode sample to convert the absorbed photons to useful electrical current was examined by measuring the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the photocathode. The IPCE spectra of S2, S3 and S6 samples were measured using the applied potentials at which saturated photocurrents were obtained. As shown in Fig. 4f, the S6 sample exhibited IPCE values of ∼90% over the entire visible spectrum, while the S2 and S3 samples showed ∼70% IPCE values, clarifying the high quantum efficiency of the antireflective Pt/TiO2 NR/p-Si photocathode.
The chronoamperometry of S4, S5 and S6 photocathode samples were measured (Fig. 5). The photocurrent of S6 was stable for >40 h. The LSV curve measured after 40 h (Fig. 5, inset) is similar to that measured before the chronoamperometry test. After letting the sample stand in ambient air for 1 week, we measured the LSV curves again. After more than 300 cycles, the sample showed no considerable degradation of PEC performance, as shown in Fig. S5.† In contrast, the S4 sample was highly degraded and showed no photocurrent in tens of minutes that corroborate with the works of L. Ji, et al.17,56 However, after etching the photocathode for ∼20 s in 2% HF, the photocurrent was restored. It confirms the formation of an insulating oxide layer on the surface that makes the bare silicon photocathode unstable.48 For the S5 sample, the saturated photocurrent was maintained for only 1 h and then the current density decreased at ∼0.23 mA cm−2 min−1, approaching zero after 3 h. This indicates that the TiO2 seed layer was too thin to protect against corrosion of p-Si.20,57

Conclusion
We have successfully grown highly uniform and multifunctional TiO2 NRs on a 4-inch p-silicon substrate using a hydrothermal synthesis method. The catalytic and conductive ability of the grown TiO2 NRs resulted in a high anodic potential shift and facilitates transfer of photogenerated minority carriers from the photon-absorbing substrate (silicon) to the electrolyte. We also demonstrated that the grown TiO2 NRs were passivated on a silicon photocathode for more than 52 h without any notable reduction in their hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Furthermore, the Pt (nanoparticles 1–2.5 nm in diameter) decorated TiO2 NR/p-Si photocathode exhibited a high saturated photocurrent density of 40 mA cm−2 at 0.0 V vs. RHE and an onset potential of 440 mV. The reflectance of silicon was dramatically reduced to 1.4% from 37.5%; hence, it can be used to increase the efficiency of a silicon-based photovoltaic cell by enhancing the solar harvesting ability. We believe that our TiO2 NRs are also applicable to Si photoanode for oxygen evolution.

A p-Si (100) wafer was cleaned with acetone and isopropanol alcohol, in conjunction with ultrasonication and soaked for 1 min in 2% HF to remove residual organic solvent from the surface. Then, a 5 nm-thick seed layer of the TiO2 film was deposited using an electron-beam evaporator (KVE-E2004L) and annealed for 5 min under high vacuum using a rapid thermal analyzer. TiO2 NRs were grown on the pre-deposited 5 nm TiO2 seed layer by hydrothermal synthesis using a large autoclave with precursors tetrabutyl titanate, DI-water, and HCl solutions with volume ratios of 1.6%, 49.2%, and 49.2%, respectively. The precursors were added to a glass beaker and stirred vigorously using magnetic stirrer until the cloudy colour changed to watery. Then the solution was transferred to a Teflon beaker in which the substrate was placed at the bottom keeping the active face up. The Teflon beaker which had the precursor solution and the substrate was inserted into the autoclave and sealed carefully. The growth was carried out for 30 to 120 min at 180–220 °C in an oven. Subsequently, Pt nanoparticles (diameter 1–2.5 nm) were deposited on the surface of hydrothermally grown TiO2 NRs using an electron-beam evaporator.
Characterization
XRD data were acquired using a Bruker Miller Co., D8-Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA at a scanning rate of 0.06° s−1. Samples for XRD measurements were taken from the as-grown TiO2 nanorods and annealed at 500 °C. Surface and cross-sectional images were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, MERLIN Compact) and transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were carried out using a Kratos AXIS-His and a monochromated Al-Kα (hν = 1486.58 eV) X-ray source to determine the composition of the synthesized rod. The high-resolution spectra of the Ti 2p, O 1s, and C 1s and Pt 4f core levels were identified using a pass energy of 100 eV through a 0.4 mm analyser slit width. Each high-resolution scan was measured four times and summed, using 50 meV steps with a dwell time of 157 ms per step. Film composition was estimated using CasaXPS (ver. 2.3.16) peak fitting, in which the integrated intensities were divided by the Wagner relative-sensitivity factors after a Shirley background subtraction. Angle-dependent reflectance measurement of the sample was carried out using a homemade system equipped with an automatic rotating sample stage and a photodetector. The incident light was generated from a Xe arc lamp source with a monochromator (Mmac-200).
PEC measurements
All PEC performance measurements were carried out in a three-electrode configuration consisting of the prepared working electrode, calomel reference electrode, and a Pt wire as a counter electrode with 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution and we consider the pH of the electrolyte as zero. All potentials were applied versus the calomel reference electrode and converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the Nernst equation: VRHE = Vcalomel + Ecalomel + 0.059 × pH(2)where VRHE and Vcalomel are the applied potentials against the RHE and calomel reference electrode, respectively. Ecalomel = 0.24 vs. the standard hydrogen electrode. A Xe arc lamp was used as a light source and calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) at the sample location using a standard Si photodiode. In each PEC measurement of the photocurrent, the sample was cathodically polarized at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 under illumination or in the dark. The photocurrent was recorded using a computer-controlled multichannel electrochemical analyser potentiostat (IVIUMnSTAT), which was simultaneously used to control the potential. The chronoamperometry measurements were performed using an applied potential of 0.0 V. The IPCE measurements were carried out using a computer-controlled monochromator (MonoRa150) and an amplifier for photocurrent detection. EIS spectra were recorded using the same potentiostat in the preceding three-electrode configuration. A sinusoidal voltage perturbation, with an amplitude of 10 mV and frequencies ranging from 350 kHz to 1 Hz, was superimposed on the bias voltage to gather the EIS data under illumination. The EIS data were fit to the equivalent circuits, as discussed in the text, using the Z plot 2.x software.
