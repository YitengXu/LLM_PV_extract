    , Accepted 5th December 2013First published on 9th December 2013AbstractThe rapid progress of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics has been boosted by (i) design and synthesis of novel conjugated donor materials, (ii) control and optimization of device fabrication, and (iii) the development of new device architectures such as tandem and ternary solar cells. Computationally driven material design has attracted increasing interest to accelerate the search for optimal conjugated photovoltaic materials, and the exploration of chemical methodologies is highly desirable in pushing the efficiency further towards the theoretical limit. Based on the motif of donor–acceptor polymers, around 50 comparable polymers were constructed and investigated, derived from an easily accessible thiophene–quinoxaline alternating polymer donor showing power conversion efficiency up to 7%. We performed a systematic density functional theory (DFT) study on the heteroatom effects of combining fluorine, nitrogen and chalcogen substitutions onto the donor/acceptor units as well as the effect of extending π-conjugation in the donor moiety, in order to gain insight into how structural modifications to the conjugated backbone can affect the molecular structure and electronic properties of a conjugated polymer. It is found that the trends in the energy levels and band gaps of these polymers correlate well with their structural modifications. Finally, by examining the systematically evaluated data in the energy diagram, we proposed three important ways of energy level modulation, showing potential chemical methodologies that can be applicable to further modify and optimize existing polymer backbones. Especially such energy level modulation can be applied to meet the particular requirements of different device architectures (including tandem and ternary solar cells) on the donor components, such as a prominent photocurrent or photovoltage combined with a high efficiency, to further maximize the overall performance of organic photovoltaics. This will provide valuable guidance and chemical methodologies for a judicious material design of conjugated polymers for solar cell applications with desirable photovoltaic characteristics.
Introduction
Solution-processed, large-area, lightweight, potentially flexible organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) offer great promise in power generation by harnessing solar energy that can be affordable, inexhaustible and clean.1 The past four years have witnessed the rapid progress in OPVs, especially with power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5% to 8.5%2 and 9.35%3 respectively reported for conventional and inverted single-junction solar cells, mainly attributable to design and synthesis of novel conjugated donor materials as well as control and optimization of device fabrication.3a,4 The development of new device architectures including tandem5 and ternary6 solar cells has now enabled OPVs to break through the benchmarking efficiency of 10%.4a,5c,d However, the current challenges for OPVs are still to improve photovoltaic efficiency as well as durability and cost-effectiveness, to compete with silicon-based solar cells.4b,7
In bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)8 polymer solar cells, the photoactive layer typically consists of a bicontinuous interpenetrating blend of an electron-donating polymer and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The design and synthesis of new conjugated donor materials with desirable chemical and physical properties has played a key role in realizing highly efficient OPVs, along with an improved understanding and control behind the photovoltaic device operation in terms of charge generation,9 separation,10 transport11 and extraction.12 Thousands of different conjugated donor polymers have been extensively synthesized and investigated in order to obtain the most promising candidates out of them.13 One well-established approach to obtain conjugated polymers is based on the strategy of donor–acceptor polymers,14 which could not only form strong interchain interactions that favor charge transport, but also fine-tune the electronic structures of conjugated polymers, resulting in desired optoelectronic properties. In this approach, π-electron-rich (donor) and π-electron-deficient (acceptor) conjugated moieties are combined into the repeating units of conjugated polymers, forming internal donor–acceptor structures. The energy levels and band gaps of conjugated polymers can thus be controlled by choosing appropriate donor and acceptor moieties, with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level determined synergistically by the donor and acceptor moieties and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level by the acceptor moiety.15
Material design through band gap and energy level tuning has been illustrated by Scharber et al.5b,15b Both the band gap of the donor polymer and the LUMO-level offset of the donor polymer to the acceptor fullerene derivative (i.e. LUMODonor − LUMOAcceptor) need to be optimized independently, which are limiting factors for the maximum short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) values separately. Neither the band gap of the donor or the LUMODonor − LUMOAcceptor difference correlates monotonically with the PCE.5a,b,15b Decreasing the band gap of the donor material will broaden the absorption spectrum, making it possible to harvest more photons for charge generation. But this means that the HOMO level of the donor (HOMODonor) is raised or the LUMO level of the donor (LUMODonor) is lowered. Raising the HOMO level of the donor material will decrease the maximum value for VOC, approximated by (LUMOAcceptor − HOMODonor)/e. Lowering the LUMO level of the donor material will reduce the LUMO-level offset of the donor material to the acceptor material used. The LUMODonor − LUMOAcceptor difference is considered to provide the driving force for exciton dissociation as well as to prevent recombination of photogenerated charges.16 Even though the maximum achievable PCE can be predicted, the realization of this relies on the judicious molecular design and synthesis, especially in exploration of chemical methodologies.15b,17 Furthermore, the design of efficient tandem solar cells requires an achievable high VOC or high JSC in conjunction with a high PCE from the donor components to be integrated, in order to maximize the overall performance.5a,c,d,13p,18 All of these require a better understanding of material design and device design.
Computationally driven material design19 has attracted increasing interest.20 In the literature, many quantum-mechanical simulations on the polymer systems have focused on the donor–acceptor polymer concept and physical insight extensively. However, a comprehensive study of structural fine-tuning in relation to energy level modulation for controllable design of conjugated donor polymers appears to be lacking, which can be useful methods for materials chemists in their future material design.
In this work, we focus on the molecular structure and electronic properties of donor–acceptor polymers and in particular investigate the effect of backbone manipulations on the resulting energy levels based on a thiophene–quinoxaline alternating copolymer. Through a series of structural modifications to the conjugated backbone (i.e. the repeating unit), we aim to provide insightful guidance and chemical methodologies to the future judicious design of conjugated donor materials, especially to meet the particular requirements of different device architectures on the donor components, such as a prominent photocurrent or photovoltage combined with a high efficiency, to further maximize the overall performance of OPVs.
Theoretical calculations
Quantum-chemical calculations by density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs21 were performed to investigate the electronic structure of these polymers by employing the B3LYP22 hybrid density functional. The basis sets used for the calculations are the split valence 6-31G(d) basis set23 for all the atoms except Te atoms for which the effective core potential (ECP) corrected lanl2dz basis set24 is employed. SCF tolerance is set so that the maximum remaining force on an atom in the system is less than 4.5 × 10−4 au and the maximum structural change of one coordinate is less than 1.8 × 10−3 au. For computational simplification, the alkoxy side chains on the acceptor (quinoxaline or pyridopyrazine) unit were replaced with methoxy groups and the alkyl side chains on the donor unit were replaced with methyl groups, and the backbones were simplified to two repeating units unless specified otherwise. All of the optimized molecular structures are in a stable local minimum of the ground state potential energy surface, as ensured by analytical second derivatives of the Hessian matrix calculated at the same level of theory. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations25 were performed to assess the excited-state vertical transition energies and oscillator strengths based on the optimized molecular geometries at the same level of theory. Hybrid functional B3LYP has successfully been used widely to compute organic molecules. It takes account of some dynamic correlation by mixing in the exact exchange from Hartree–Fock, which is important in order to describe long-range interactions like conjugation well.26 It is worth mentioning that since the calculations reported in this study are performed within the same framework, we are able to provide a systematic evaluation of the intrinsic properties (e.g. electronic properties) of the organic molecules and polymers, by reasonable comparison of their respective trends. Our previous combined experimental and computational studies27 as well as many other studies20d,28 show that the methods used here can be suitable for this purpose. In addition, some experimental data will also be included in our discussion where available to compare with the trends of the calculated properties.
Results and discussion
Model polymer
Donor–acceptor polymers based on quinoxalines are among the best conjugated donor materials in organic solar cells, with PCE as high as 6–8%.13k,n,29 Among them, one particularly promising conjugated donor polymer consisting of alternating thiophene and quinoxaline units, which combined a high efficiency (up to 7%) with an efficient synthesis method,29a,b serves as one parental structure of intensive studies to further understand the structure–property–performance relationships of conjugated donor materials and to further explore possibilities of improving the photovoltaic performance, such as modifications in chemical structures with fine-tuned molecular orbital energies, favorable side-chain architectures, and sufficient molecular weights.27a,30 In particular, we demonstrated an effective chemical strategy through energy level modulation by introducing fluorine and selenium substitutions into conjugated polymers, which can lower the HOMO energy level while keeping the optical gap almost unchanged for achieving a high VOC.27a In this study, we take the TQ polymer as a model polymer, and by applying modification in the backbone structures (i.e. the repeating units) we try to build up an empirical relationship in providing information for new material design through a systematic comparison. We have focused our comparison in three different aspects in terms of energy level modulation: (i) incorporation of fluorine substituents and imine nitrogen into the acceptor moiety, (ii) the heteroatom effect of chalcogen substitution on the donor moiety, and (iii) incorporation of conjugated fused heteroarenes. The building units investigated in this study are shown in Chart 1.

We have explored several conformations resulting from the different configurations of the alkoxy groups, phenyl ring side chains, and backbone cis–trans isomerism, which can be found in the ESI† for TF2Q as an example (Fig. S1, ESI†). Due to the small energy difference between most of the conformers, we have chosen to take the trans conformation as a basis of comparison to minimize the influence of steric hindrance, and to compare the backbone conjugation and electronic properties of the polymers.
Electronic effect of fluorine and nitrogen incorporation into the acceptor units
Fluorine substitution on the acceptor units of the polymer backbone is an effective chemical method to tune the energy levels of donor–acceptor polymers, which deepens the HOMO levels and the LUMO levels simultaneously.31 This approach has been employed to develop many new conjugated polymers that show efficiency exceeding 6%.13a–c,e,f However, the fluorine substitution of the two protons on the quinoxaline ring in the TQ repeating unit decreased the PCE to 1.6% for the TF2Q polymer even though a high VOC of 0.99 V was obtained.30a When only one fluorine atom was introduced,32 the resulting TFQ polymer was able to obtain a VOC as high as 0.95 V with a PCE of 4% close to that of the TQ polymer. This comparison suggests that the extent of fluorine substitution needs to be optimized.
In addition, the incorporation of electron-withdrawing imine nitrogen atoms will increase the acceptor strength,33 as occurs for conjugated materials based on benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole,34 thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine,35 quinoxaline,13k,n,29 pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine,30a,33b,36 [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine,33b,37 and their derivatives (see Chart 2). Quinoxaline and pyridopyrazine present some advantages over benzothiadizole in terms of the presence of additional substitution sites away from the backbone for introducing solubilizing side chains (onto the pyrazine ring). This can be engineered so as not to cause interruption of backbone conjugation by substituent twisting. Thienopyrazines usually result in a very small optical gap accompanied by a high-lying HOMO level and appear to be less interesting for use in polymer:fullerene solar cells.35c,d The use of pyridopyrazine is drawing increased attention although an impressive efficiency is still lacking. But the high photovoltaic performance of thiadiazolopyridine-based conjugated donor materials38 suggests the importance of desirable structural regioregularity control37b as well as the potential of analogous pyridopyrazine as a promising building block in designing conjugated donor materials. We therefore choose to focus on the fine modifications on the quinoxaline core structure as the acceptor unit while keeping the side-chain architecture on the acceptor units unchanged, for a fair comparison.
 Chart 2  Some basic building blocks containing imine nitrogen in the literature. 
By varying the extent of fluorine substitutions and incorporation of imine nitrogen, five basic acceptor units bearing the same side chains (i.e. di(meta-alkoxyphenyl)) are studied (Chart 1). The LUMO levels of these units calculated by DFT follow the order Q > FQ > F2Q > PP > FPP, which agrees with the effect of fluorine substitution on the energy levels in reducing both HOMO and LUMO levels. Interestingly, incorporation of imine nitrogen results in even deeper energy levels than difluorination on the quinoxaline backbone ring, which demonstrates the strong electron-withdrawing effect of imine nitrogen in an aromatic ring. From DFT, a deepening of ∼0.5 eV in the LUMO level is observed from Q to FPP, showing a wide range of energy level changes. The HOMO levels follow the same trend as observed for the LUMO level, but the difference of the deepening is almost halved. As the frontier atomic orbitals of fluorine and nitrogen lie below those of hydrogen and carbon respectively, both the HOMO and LUMO of the separated acceptor units will be lowered upon substitution of hydrogen with fluorine or carbon with nitrogen. Because the contribution of the atomic orbital (pz) of fluorine (or nitrogen) incorporated into the separated acceptor units is larger in the LUMO (relatively more localized on the fused conjugated core unit) than in the HOMO (relatively more localized to the conjugated side groups) of their molecular orbitals, the change on the LUMO levels is relatively more significant. As a result, the HOMO–LUMO gaps of these acceptor units also follow the same trend (Q > FQ > F2Q > PP > FPP) (see Fig. S2, ESI†).
When donor–acceptor polymers are constructed based on these quinoxalines or pyridopyrazines as the acceptor unit with thiophene as the donor unit, DFT shows that the trend of the LUMO levels with various acceptor units is retained (Fig. 1). By checking the frontier orbitals of these donor–acceptor structures (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†), we find that their LUMOs consist of the bonding linear combination from the LUMOs of the respective segments (except LUMO+1 for tellurophene, see further discussion). Therefore, the structural changes (i.e. by incorporating electron-withdrawing fluorine or imine nitrogen) on the acceptor units will contribute to the LUMOs of the donor–acceptor polymers in the same way as to the LUMOs of the separated acceptor units, thereby retaining the trend of the LUMO levels with various acceptor units (Q > FQ > F2Q > PP > FPP). This results in a deepening of their respective LUMO levels by ∼0.4 eV from the separated acceptor units to the thiophene-based donor–acceptor polymers constructed (with two repeating units).39 The HOMOs of these donor–acceptor polymers arise from the antibonding linear combination from the highest occupied orbitals of the corresponding acceptor units with the right symmetry (HOMO−3) and the HOMOs of the corresponding donor units (except HOMO−1 for tellurophene) (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). As a result, a similar trend is followed, except that the difluorination still maintains a deeper HOMO level than the others. The HOMO−3 energies of these acceptor units follow the same trends of their HOMOs. As a consequence, the lower these HOMO−3 energies of the acceptor units are, the lower HOMO levels the donor–acceptor polymers would have, following the same trend as the HOMO levels of the separated acceptor units. However, in the cases with the inclusion of fluorine substituents on the acceptor units, there is an additional lowering of the HOMO due to through-space intramolecular stabilizing interactions between fluorine substituents and the neighboring donor unit in the donor–acceptor structures. We believe that the involvement of fluorine in the antibonding linear combination of the separated segments and interaction of the lone pair of fluorine with π-orbital of thiophene in the constructed donor–acceptor polymers (see Fig. 2) can stabilize the system that is not possible for the hydrogen or imine nitrogen atoms on the acceptor units, which is doubled for TF2Q compared to TFQ. This extra stabilization tends to increase the HOMO–LUMO gaps, which can counterpoise the opposite trend as seen on the separated acceptor units upon fluorination, resulting in variation of the trends of the HOMO levels and the HOMO–LUMO gaps, when these acceptor units are combined with different donor units (Fig. 1, S2 and S5, ESI†).40 Here for example, TF2Q has a slightly larger HOMO–LUMO gap than both TFQ and TQ, with TFQ very slightly lower than TQ. It is found that the chosen calculation methods in this study are indeed suitable for the investigated systems, by comparing these calculated results with the available electrochemical measurements of the synthesized polymers at hand (Fig. 1).30a

Note that single fluorination as well as incorporation of imine nitrogen may introduce structural irregularity. Many studies have shown that regioregularity is usually preferred over the regiorandom structures for polymers to perform well.37b,38b–d With the calculation level performed in this study, certain regioregularity is assumed. By further comparing additional regioregularity in the case of thiophene as the donor moiety, we find that conclusions drawn by staying with the structural regioregularity can be held (Fig. S6, ESI†). Hence, identical regioregularity has been assumed for all of the donor–acceptor polymers constructed for the calculations for fair comparison.
Heteroatom effect of chalcogen substitutions into the conjugated electron-rich units
Thiophene has served as a widely used building block in semiconducting polymers.41 It is often used, for instance, as donor units, conjugated bridges, and conjugated side chains. Further chemical modifications derived from thiophene range from solubilizing side chain attachment, oligomerization, to fusing. All of these have played a crucial role in designing new conjugated polymers. In the meantime, substituting sulfur in these thiophene-based structures with other analogous chalcogen elements, such as oxygen, selenium and even tellurium, has attracted increasing interest in further improving their photovoltaic performance. Here we will discuss the electronic difference by using different chalcogenophenes (Chart 1) as donor units in the donor–acceptor polymers. The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of these five-membered rings decrease with atomic numbers (Fig. S7, ESI†). The LUMO levels follow the same trend with the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (decreasing with atomic numbers). The HOMO levels, however, follow a different trend, that is, sulfur < selenium < oxygen < tellurium. All of these trends agree well with previously reported experimental observations.42
The LUMOs of these five-membered heterocycles can be attributed to the antibonding linear combination of the pz orbital of the corresponding heteroatoms with the π*-orbital of the carbon framework of the rings except tellurophene. For tellurophene, the molecular orbitals have a different order where the lowest σ*-orbital is the LUMO and the antibonding linear combination of the pz and π* orbitals gives the LUMO+1, due to the smaller electronegativity of tellurium. Here we note that the order of the molecular orbitals of these chalcogenophene units has been observed experimentally before.42b With increasing atomic numbers, the sizes of chalcogen atoms increase, resulting in an increase in the chalcogen–carbon bond length in the five-membered rings (Table 1) and a reduction of orbital overlap, as a consequence of which, the antibonding character of the LUMO+1 of tellurophene or the LUMOs of the other three chalcogenophenes will be reduced.42b In addition, the energies of the pz orbitals of these chalcogen atoms increase with increasing atomic numbers, resulting in less overlap with the π*-orbital of the carbon framework of the rings. All of these will result in a lowering of their LUMO levels with increasing atomic numbers (Fig. S7, ESI†). The HOMOs can be assigned to the 1a2 π-orbital of these chalcogenophene units except tellurophene (2b1 π-orbital, due to the smaller electronegativity of tellurium42a) (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†). The 1a2 π-orbital does not mix with the heteroatom pz orbital for symmetry reasons and therefore should have similar energy regardless of different chalcogen atoms.42a Due to the different sizes of these heteroatoms, the C–C single bond lengths of these five-membered heterocycles slightly increase in the order T < Se < Fu < Te, while the CC double bond lengths slightly decrease in the same order. As a result, the calculated HOMO energy levels agree well with the degrees of bond-length alternation (BLA) within the carbon framework of these chalcogenophene units (Table 1), even though the difference is almost negligible. All these factors discussed here will contribute together to their HOMO–LUMO gaps (Fig. S7, ESI†).

Interestingly, we find that these trends can be retained separately in most cases when constructed as donor–acceptor polymers, as seen in combination with quinoxaline (Fig. 3) or fluorinated pyridopyrazine units (Fig. S8, ESI†). It is also noteworthy that comparison of the calculated results with the available electrochemical measurements of polymers27a (Fig. 3) can further confirm the reasonable choice of calculation methods in this study.

Effect of extended conjugation and fused units in the donor moiety
As noted above, the incorporation of conjugated fused heteroarenes is a useful approach that can result in rigid and coplanar conjugated polymer backbones, enhancing effective π-conjugation and facilitating intra- and intermolecular charge transport. This strategy has resulted in many efficient conjugated donor polymers. Several fused thiophene-based units are investigated to explore the electronic properties of the donor–acceptor polymers, which may also provide valuable information on other chalcogenophene analogues. These include thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT),43 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),2,3,13a,k naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT),44 and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTP).5c,34c For comparison, 2,2′-bithiophene (DT) as well as thiophene (T)29a,b,45 is also included. It has to be noted that such comparisons, based on the extrapolation from the comparison of oligomers to that of polymers, need cautions with systematic error arising from the different conjugation saturation nature for different structures as well as the influence of different conjugation path lengths, because the conjugation path lengths in the calculations are very often shorter than the effective conjugation lengths.
First, a band gap narrowing is observed from BDT > DT > DTP when constructed as donor–acceptor polymers, as shown in combination with quinoxaline (Fig. 4, and S9, ESI†). This trend agrees well with the trend of these separated units, given their comparable conjugation path lengths. NDT-based donor–acceptor polymers show the largest HOMO–LUMO energy gaps given the largest conjugation path length within comparison. However, it may not be straightforward to further compare the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of these separated donor units with the other donor units (T and TT). Indeed, for these single units, the conjugated path lengths of these donor units vary, from two double bonds for T, to three for TT, to four for DT, DTP and BDT, to five for NDT. Finally, by performing additional calculations with increased numbers of repeating units to obtain a comparable conjugation path length for indirect comparison (Table 2 and Fig. 4), it can be concluded that the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps are narrowed generally following the order NDT > BDT > T > TT ≈ DT > DTP. Furthermore, the resulting LUMO levels of donor–acceptor polymers based on these units are close to each other.

Implications and guidance for material design
It is interesting to analyze how structural modifications can affect the electronic properties of the resulting molecules. Some first empirical rules may be drawn to provide insight to further modify and optimize other related semiconductors.
Firstly, one can modulate the energy levels while keeping the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps almost unchanged through structural modifications. For this purpose, optimization of fluorine substitutions in conjunction with sulfur–selenium exchange may be considered.27a Lowering the LUMO level while keeping an identical band gap, along with a deepening in the HOMO level, may allow for a higher VOC along with a comparable JSC to result in a higher PCE, which may be applicable for designing the front subcell donor component in tandem solar cells where a high photovoltage is always highly desired, or for conjugated donor polymers in single-junction solar cells, to maximize the overall photovoltaic performance. By grouping the computed models with similar HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Fig. 5), one can see more clearly what kinds of chemical methodologies can be applicable for such energy level modulation. For example, single fluorination is usually effective to lower the LUMO level without obviously changing the band gap of the polymer (e.g. from TQ to TFQ or from SeQ to SeFQ). By taking optical gaps (slightly different from HOMO–LUMO gaps)46 into account, we have previously shown that synergistically incorporating selenium and fluorine may in reality minimize the LUMO-level offset while keeping the optical gap almost unchanged.27a

Secondly, one can also tune the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps while maintaining an identical HOMO level modulated by chemical methods. Reducing the energy band gap while keeping a comparable HOMO level may allow for a similar photovoltage with a broader spectral coverage for photocurrent generation. As a result, improvement in PCE will be possible. By grouping the evaluated models with identical HOMO levels, potential chemical approaches to narrow the band gap of conjugated polymers while keeping a comparable HOMO level can be found (e.g., from TQ to SeFQ to FuPP to TeF2Q to TePP, see Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Energy diagram of the different polymers grouped by similar HOMO levels. 
Last but not least, one can also tune the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps while retaining a comparable LUMO level mediated by chemical methods. A simple strategy already shown in our previous discussion can be extending π-conjugation in the donor moiety by oligomerization or fusing to combine with a carefully chosen acceptor unit, without introducing extra different heteroatoms into the backbone. Alternatively, by grouping the computed models with similar LUMO levels, one can also find additional possible chemical methods (see Fig. 7). As a result, one may achieve an optimal band gap for maximizing the efficiency as a compromise of the VOC and JSC changes, i.e. reducing the band gap at the same LUMO level increases the HOMO level and consequently may increase JSC but decrease VOC. Unlike the previous two ways of energy level modulation, this unpredictable method is actually the most commonly used today when a new acceptor unit is developed. Therefore, our result here will provide some valuable insight in better designing conjugated donor polymers. And above all, these three ways of energy level modulation is strongly dependent on the material structure and the energy level matching with the acceptor materials used, and therefore can be applied in different contexts,5a,b,15b but the trend with structural modifications may be very insightful in designing new materials.

Conclusions
We report a comprehensive computational study of structural fine-tuning in relation to energy level modulation for future design of conjugated donor polymers, especially to meet the particular requirements of different device architectures (including tandem and ternary solar cells) on the donor components, such as a prominent short-circuit current density or open-circuit voltage combined with a high power conversion efficiency, to further maximize the overall performance of organic photovoltaics. We have performed a systematic DFT and TD-DFT study on heteroatom effects by combination of fluorine, nitrogen and chalcogen substitutions onto the donor/acceptor moieties of a thiophene–quinoxaline alternating polymer as well as the effect of extending π-conjugation in the donor moiety, aimed to get insight into how structural modifications to the conjugated backbone can affect the molecular structure and electronic properties of a conjugated polymer. The motif of donor–acceptor polymers has been applied to construct around 50 comparable polymers. It is found that the trends in the energy levels and band gaps of these polymers correlate well with their corresponding structural modifications. Finally, the energy diagrams of the systematically evaluated data were sorted out for energy level modulation in three different ways to search for potential chemical methodologies that can be applicable to further modify and optimize existing polymer backbones. This work will provide valuable guidance and chemical methodologies for a judicious material design of conjugated polymers with desirable photovoltaic characteristics. This study also calls for future investigations of the trends of band gap and energy level tuning over a broader range of structural modifications.
