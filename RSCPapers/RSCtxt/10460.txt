    , Accepted 4th September 2012First published on 7th September 2012AbstractA series of (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical micro/nano-structured solid solutions with precisely controlled chemical composition were synthesized via a facile one-pot solvothermal method. ZnO, Cu2O, and In(OH)3 are used as the starting materials and dissolved in ethanol dithiocarbamic acid which is formed from CS2 and ethanolamine in situ. The ethanol dithiocarbamic acid not only serves as a thermally-degradable ligand, but also acts as sulfur source during synthesis, and can be completely removed by a simple calcination process. As-prepared (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x microspheres have a hierarchical micro/nano structure composed of around 7 nm nanoparticles. These samples show excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible-light irradiation without any noble metal loading owing to their high surface area (as high as 101.6 m2 g−1) and unique hierarchical structure.
Introduction
Multi-component chalcogenide solid solutions, such as Cd1−xZnxS,1–3 (CuIn)xZn2(1−x)S2,4–6 (Ga1−xZnx)(N1−xOx),7 Cd0.1SnxZn0.9−2xS,8 (Zn1+xGe)(N2Ox),9 and (AgIn)xZn2(1−x)S2etc.10 have been extensively investigated due to their tunable band gap properties as promising semiconductors in the utilization of solar energy. Among these different solid solutions, the quaternary Zn–Cu–In–S system (ZCIS) has been receiving much attention because of its high photocatalytic activity and comparably low toxicity. Alloyed ZCIS solutions possess a tunable band gap in the range 3.7 (ZnS) to 1.5 eV (CuInS2), covering the whole visible light spectrum, and a high absorption coefficient of the order of 105 cm−1.11 There are several reports about water photo-splitting using ZCIS as the photocatalyst.5,12,13 Previous studies show that the conduction band level of the ZCIS photocatalysts greatly affects their photocatalytic activities.4,5 Besides, loading Pt or Ru particles on ZCIS photocatalysts could dramatically improve the hydrogen generation efficiency in aqueous solutions containing S2− and SO32− as electron donors.5,13
It is noteworthy that highly active and visible light-driven photocatalysts rely not only on their energy structure, but also on their surface morphology and crystal structure. Bulk ZCIS particles may result in a high recombination rate of photo-induced electron–hole pairs and a reduced photocatalytic activity. A valid solution for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency is to load Pt or Ru as the co-catalysts on the surface of the photocatalysts, since the Schottky barrier formed at metal–semiconductor interfaces will decrease recombination of photo-generated charge carriers. However, the use of expensive noble metals is not always desirable for practical applications for budgetary reasons. Therefore, it is preferable to increase the surface area of the photocatalysts and various strategies have been adopted. Kudo et al. prepared a series of bulk CZTS solid solutions with a surface area of 3.3 m2 g−1, and the highest H2 evolution rate for those nonloaded samples was 30 μmol h−1 g−1.5,14 Recently, Guo et al. synthesized ZCIS solid solutions with a surface area of 44.3 m2 g−1 by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant. But these samples lack structural regularity and have no evident increase of H2 generation compared to the bulk CZTS solid solutions.13 More recently, a series of (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x/TiO2 nanocomposites with a surface area as high as 200 m2 g−1 were synthesized by our group. However, a laborious process was needed to remove the oleic acid before these nanocomposites could show photocatalytic behavior in aqueous solution. Moreover, these very small non-capped nanocrystals tended to aggregate and thus lose their stability. In particular, difficulties in the reuse and recovery of these extremely small particles were inevitable.4 On the other hand, the micro/nano hierarchical structure has been an attractive feature to enhance the photocatalytic activity and stability of photocatalysts in the field of functional materials.15–19 The special micro/nano hierarchical structure has been proved to be feasible for improving the photocatalytic properties of semiconductors.16,20,21 However, a hierarchical structure has hitherto seldom been attained for ZCIS solid solutions. These existing results motivated us to further explore the unique ZCIS solid solutions, which combine the advantages of a tunable energy structure and a hierarchical micro/nano structure. Our aim is to synthesize ZCIS solid solutions with a mesoporous structure which allows better adsorption, diffusion and reactivity during the photocatalytic process.
In this paper, we present a facile solvothermal method to synthesize hierarchical micro/nano-structured (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions by using ZnO, Cu2O, and In(OH)3 as the starting materials. The ethanol dithiocarbamic acid, which is generated from CS2 and ethanolamine in situ, served as thermally-degradable ligand and sulfur source, and no template was required. Finally, (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical solid solutions were obtained by removal of the thermally-degradable ligands via a simple calcination process. The energy structures of a series of solid solutions could be easily controlled by varying the cationic precursor ratios. In addition, H2 photo-evolution for these specimens was investigated under visible light irradiation without any co-catalysts. This research could be extended to synthesize other hierarchical multi-component chalcogenide solid solutions.
Experimental section
Chemical synthesis and characterization
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Aladdin Inc. A series of (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x samples (Table S1†) were prepared in a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The samples were labeled according to nominal ZnS–CuInS2 molar ratio. In a typical synthesis of (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 microspheres, 0.8 mmol of ZnO, 0.05 mmol of Cu2O, 0.1 mmol of In(OH)3, 10 mmol of CS2, and 10 mmol of ethanolamine were dissolved in 15 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) by ultrasound at room temperature until complete dissolution. Next, the solution was transferred to the autoclave, and the reaction was maintained in a furnace at 453 K for 12 h. The resulting product was isolated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol, and air-dried at room temperature. All the samples were made from ethanolamine unless noted. The crystal structures of the products were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer (Cu Kα1 radiation). UV-vis diffuse reflective spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer and converted from reflection to absorbance by the Kubelka–Munk method. SEM images, element mapping, and EDX results were obtained with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010). TEM images were obtained with a FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were calcined at 723 K for 5 min under nitrogen atmosphere before performing N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 M apparatus.
Hydrogen photo-evolution process
Hydrogen photo-evolution processes were executed using a top-irradiation Pyrex photoreaction cell with a gas-closed circulation system (Changtuo Company, Beijing). A 300 W Xeon lamp equipped with a cutoff filter provided visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). The light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun using a Newport optical power meter (model 842-PE). For each experiment, 50 mg of calcined (ZnS)x(CIS)1−x microspheres were suspended into 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO3 and 0.5 M Na2S as hole sacrifice agents by continuous magnetic stirring inside the Pyrex photoreaction cell. The reaction system was deaerated several times before irradiating with visible light. The volume of yielded H2 was determined using online gas chromatography (GC-2010, Shimadzu, N2 carrier) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD2-C, VICI, Valco instruments company).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 depicts the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for a series of as-prepared (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions. All the samples show similar patterns composed of three broad peaks, which can be indexed to the zincblende structure without any other peaks due to impurities. The change of the crystal structure with varying x values is not obvious, and the average crystallite size is around 7.1 nm calculated with the Scherrer formula according to the half-height width of the (111) diffraction peak. Note that the crystal sizes of our (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions are remarkably smaller than those previously reported in the literature, indicating a higher surface area could be achieved. In addition, the diffraction peaks successively shift to a higher angle as the value of x increases. This observation demonstrated a linear decrease of the lattice parameter c as the ZnS content increases, as shown in Fig. S1,† indicating the samples are homogenous solid solutions rather than mixtures or hetero-structures according to Vegard's law. Based on thermogravimetric (TG) analysis results (Fig. S2†), the samples were calcined at 723 K under nitrogen atmosphere for 5 min to remove ligands thoroughly. As shown in Fig. S3,† the calcination process does not induce any phase transformation or crystalline change, demonstrating a good thermal stability of the as-prepared (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x samples.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra and the corresponding digital photograph of the as-prepared samples. With decreasing ZnS amounts, a gradual color change from white to green to orange was observed. Consistent with the color change, the onsets of the absorption edges monotonically red-shift accordingly, indicating a molecular level incorporation between CuInS2 and ZnS components, which is consistent with the results of XRD patterns. The band gap energy of each sample listed in Table S1† was calculated from the onsets of absorption edges employing the Kubelka–Munk equation. Clearly, the as-prepared samples show a tunable band gap in the range 2.35 to 3.47 eV. Therefore, these (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x microspheres can be driven by visible light to split water into hydrogen, and the effect of the band gap energy on the photocatalytic activity will be investigated and discussed later.

Electronic microscopes were employed to further study the microscopic structures of as-prepared (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions. According to the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images presented in Fig. 3, all the samples exhibit a spherical outline with a rather uniform size of several hundred nanometers. Numerous nanograins combine together to form the hierarchical micro/nano structured microspheres with a relatively rough surface. The as-prepared microspheres can be dispersed in water. Unlike the bulk CZTS solid solutions, our microspheres have low bulk densities. Besides, the solid solutions show different microspherical outlines when the monoethanolamine is replaced by either 1-butylamine or diglycolamine during the synthetic process, suggesting that the morphology of the solid solutions is strongly dependent on the molecular structure of the capping agent, as shown in Fig. S4.†

Fig. 4 displays a representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image for (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 microspheres and the corresponding high resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image. Under TEM observation, these (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 microspheres with an average size of 760 nm are revealed to be composed of (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 nanoparticles with a size of around 8 nm. HR-TEM results clearly demonstrated high crystallinity on the surface of the microspheres. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping result in Fig. 4 revealed that individual elements of the solid solutions are homogeneous and well-distributed in the microsphere. These observations are quite consistent with the XRD results. In addition, Fig. S5† shows the EDX spectra of as-prepared (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions, and the corresponding element analysis results are listed in Table S1.† Note that the chemical composition of the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x microspheres can be precisely controlled by changing the precursor ratios of ZnO/Cu2O/In(OH)3.

Scheme 1 illustrates the formation mechanism of the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres. In our research scope, the ‘R’ represents either a , or a , or a  group depending on the synthetic process. First, ZnO, Cu2O, and In(OH)3 were dissolved in dithiocarbamic acid which was generated from CS2 and primary amine in situ, to form the Zn, Cu, and In precursor solutions. Afterwards, the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres were formed by a solvothermal reaction at 453 K. At high temperatures, the dithiocarbamic acid R–HNCSSH was partially decomposed to release S2− ions as a sulfur source which served as capping agents at the same time. The (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres were capped by excess R–HNCSSH after the reaction. Thus, the R–HNCSSH is considered to be the morphology-directing reagent for the formation of (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical solid solutions. In order to verify the effect of the ligands on the morphology of the products, 1-butylamine and diglycolamine with different carbon chains were also used to synthesize the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres. Consequently, the outlines of the final products synthesized in DMF solution are greatly affected by the morphology-directing reagents, as shown in Fig. S4.† The microspherical outline may derive from the combined effect of both oriented growth and Ostwald ripening.21 To activate the photocatalysts, the thermally-degradable ligands must be removed from the surface of the microspheres before conducting water splitting reactions. After a calcination process at 723 K, the hierarchical structure of the microspheres can be retained as SEM images and XRD patterns show in Fig. S2,† indicating excellent morphology stability for our samples.

To identify the porous nature of the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres, typical N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are provided in Fig. 5. The calculated Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area can be as high as 101.6 m2 g−1, and the type of IV hysteresis loop shows the medium pore size centered at 3.42 nm and a narrow pore size distribution calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The large surface area with mesoporous framework is highly beneficial for heterogeneous catalysis. For photocatalytic processes, this structure benefits the exciting light harvest because of possible multiple scattering. Furthermore, it can achieve more active sites for photocatalytic reactions.

To explore the potential photocatalytic ability, water splitting reactions on the calcined (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical solid solutions were performed under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). The H2 yields for different photocatalysts were monitored at 1 h intervals. No H2 was detected without irradiation. Note that all the photocatalysts can split water into H2 upon irradiation, and the amount of H2 increases with prolonged exposure. As presented in Fig. 6, the photocatalytic abilities of (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x microspheres are strongly dependent on their compositions and the band gaps. Among all the photocatalysts, (ZnS)8/9(CuInS)1/9 shows the highest hydrogen evolution rate (approximately 91 μmol h−1 g−1). Even the worst photocatalyst, (ZnS)2/3 (CuInS2)1/3, has an H2 evolution rate of nearly 20 μmol h−1 g−1, which greatly exceeds most of the previously reported ZCIS photocatalysts with similar composition and band gap energy.5,10,13,14 In addition, the photocatalytic stability of (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 microspheres was further evaluated (see the right-hand side panel of Fig. 6). No deactivation was observed, indicating good irradiation stability of the sample. These results prove the excellent water photo-splitting activity for the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions. Actually, the energy band gap of the photocatalysts plays a decisive role in their water splitting abilities, since the primary steps of water photo-splitting involve the absorption of radiation and its conversion into spatially separated electron–hole pairs. The conduction band position of the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions shifts with an increase of ZnS content, which leads to a lower redox potential to reduce H2O to H2. However, increasing ZnS content will enlarge the band gap of the alloys and reduce the absorption range in the visible light region, to the detriment of the water splitting ability. Similarly, increasing the CuInS2 component (x < 8/9) shows negative effects on H2 generation which are caused by lowering conduction band edges. As a result of the trade off between the band gap and conduction band edge for CZTS solid solutions, the optimal band gap was found to be 2.78 eV for (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 microspheres. The most effective H2 generation of (ZnS)8/9(CuInS2)1/9 is ascribed to the most suitable band gap with rather moderate conduction band edge. At the same time, the excellent water photo-splitting performance is also related to the unique hierarchical structure with a high surface area for the photocatalysts. The intimate contact of each nanocrystal on the microspheres facilitates fast transmission of the photo-induced carrier, and no surface ligands retard the interfacial charge transfer. Very importantly, the porous framework prevents the unwanted aggregation of nanocrystals, benefiting the harvest of light irradiation whilst favoring the free diffusion of H2O molecules. Therefore the possibility of e−–h+ recombination is reduced and the water splitting efficiency is enhanced substantially, even in the absence of noble metal co-catalysts. Considering the above analyses, it can be concluded that the excellent photo-hydrogen-evolving properties of the (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x solid solutions originate from the synergetic effect of the tunable band-gap and the unique hierarchical porous structure. Moreover, the micro/nano structured outlines allow the materials easy separation for recovery after experiment.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of homogeneous (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres with a tunable band gap have been successfully synthesized via a simple solvothermal method. ZnO, Cu2O, and In(OH)3 were dissolved in ethanol dithiocarbamic acid which served as the thermally-degradable ligand and sulfur source. The ethanol dithiocarbamic acid plays a pivotal role in the formation of monodisperse (ZnS)x(CuInS2)1−x hierarchical microspheres. These hierarchical microspheres have a porous structure with a surface area as high as 101.6 m2 g−1 and exhibit excellent water splitting performance up to 91 μmol h−1 g−1 without noble metal loading. The excellent photocatalytic water splitting properties of these solid solutions are attributed to the synergetic effect of the tunable electronic structure and the unique hierarchical porous structure. These monodisperse hierarchical microspheres with a tunable band gap and a high surface area may have potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. In addition, this synthetic route could be extended to prepare other multi-component metal sulfide microspheres, such as CdxZn1−xS, (ZnS)x(AgInS2)1−x, (ZnS)x(Cu2SnS3)1−xetc.
