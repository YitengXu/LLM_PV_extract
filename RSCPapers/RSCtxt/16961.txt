    , Accepted 7th September 2021First published on 10th September 2021AbstractOrganic solar cell (OSC) is an important device that harvests solar energy and converts it into electrical energy using organic conjugated molecules as photoactive materials. Appreciable research efforts have been performed during the last few decades to develop novel photoactive materials and employ different designed device architectures and fabrication processes to improve the performance of OSCs. Different types of donor (simple/ladder-type) and acceptor units can be used to design and synthesize new photoactive materials and further molecular engineering can be performed to enhance the optoelectronic properties of these materials. Ladder-type units (those having fused four or more conjugated rings), such as indacenodithiophene (IDT), indolocarbazole (ICz), indaceno-[3,2-b]-thiophene (IDTT) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT), can be introduced as donor units to construct photoactive materials. IDT is a rigid, coplanar π-conjugated unit containing five fused rings. Different types of IDT-core-based light harvesting materials have been developed for OSCs and a power conversion efficiency of 12% has been attained. Until now, only one review on indacenodithiophene-based polymer solar cells was available in the literature and it discussed the factors affecting the band gaps and film morphologies of IDT-based molecules. In contrast, this review article examines the recent research done in the area of IDT-based materials for use in OSCs. The impact of different kinds of donor/acceptor units on the overall performance of IDT-based materials is also discussed. Additionally, we discuss the effects of alkyl/aryl side chains on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of IDT materials.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices harvest solar energy and convert it into electrical energy using organic molecules as light harvesting materials. Due to their high-power conversion efficiency, inorganic solar cells such as silicon solar cells still dominate industrial production.1 However, there are some drawbacks associated with inorganic solar cells, such as their high-cost production, complex fabrication and environmental toxicity.2 Numerous attempts have been made during the last few decades to resolve the technological and material issues accompanying organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices to make them commercially available. Presently, developing organic π-conjugated molecules for use as photoactive active materials for light harvesting in OPV cells has become a broader interest because of their potential advantages, such as low production cost, higher absorption coefficient, light weight and flexible device fabrication.3,4 Significant progress in organic photovoltaics has been attained not only by the development of novel photoactive materials but also by employing different device architecture designs and fabrication processes.5–8 The solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell is the most widely used device architecture in OSCs. In this device architecture, a blend film of photoactive materials (donor and acceptor) is coated between two different electrodes (cathode and electrode). Recently, an inspiring PCE of 18% was obtained for a single junction BHJ solar cell.9–11 Both the donor and acceptor materials play an important role in the overall performance of BHJ devices. More significantly, the optoelectronic properties of organic (polymer/small) semiconductor materials can be easily tuned via innovative molecular design and synthesis.12 The molecular modification of conjugated photoactive materials is an important driver in the OPV technology protocol. To develop an efficient OPV material, researchers should design a molecule which contains several properties, such as high solubility, tunable optical band gap and energy levels, high molar extinction coefficient and charge carrier mobilities of donor and acceptor, favorable blend film morphology, stability and durability. The optical band gap of a molecule can be reduced by increasing the conjugation of the molecule and incorporating an electron withdrawing group in the π-conjugated backbone to enhance the light harvesting properties and molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of the molecule, which are favourable for high values of EQE and Jsc in OSCs. Different types of alkyl side chains improve the solubility and morphology of blend films. The short circuit current density (Jsc) can be increased by extending the absorption and thus the PCE of the solar cell also increases. Noncovalent bonding interactions increase the planarity and rigidity of the molecular back bone which increases the charge carrier mobility of the molecules.13 The performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been drastically improved via the introduction of ladder-type conjugated molecules (containing four or more conjugated fused aromatic moieties as a central core unit) as light harvesting materials. The ladder-type units effectively restrict rotational disorder, resulting in lower reorganization energy. Ladder-type molecules exhibit red-shifted absorption, energy-saving intramolecular charge transfer, significant aggregation and crystallinity.14 A variety of polymers and small molecules, such as indacenodithiophene (IDT), indolocarbazole (ICz), indaceno-[3,2-b]-thiophene (IDTT) and benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b] dithiophene (BDT), have been developed using different types of ladder moieties.15,16 The binding energy of the exciton (electron–hole pairs bound by an electrostatic force of attraction) EB is equal to 0.2–1.5 eV. A large amount of energy is required to generate charge carriers (electron and hole) during the photoinitiated current generation process. This force is supplied by the offset of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies, ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO, respectively, between the donor and acceptor materials at a bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Consequently, the exciton dissociation process induces energy loss through charge transfer at the interface. ΔECT = Eex − ECT ≈ ΔEHOMO(LUMO) − EB,(1)where Eex is the lowest photogenerated exciton (S1) energy of the donor or acceptor.
Another type of energy loss originates from both radiative (ΔEr) and nonradiative (ΔEnr) recombination at the interface: ΔErec = ECT − qVOC = ΔEr + ΔEnr,(2)where VOC is the open-circuit voltage and q is the electron charge. The total energy loss in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is equal to the sum of ΔECT and ΔErec. Eloss = ΔECT + ΔErec = Eex − qVOC(3)Hence, the total energy loss in OPVs is the difference between the lowest photogenerated exciton energy of a donor/acceptor and the open circuit energy (0.7 eV for fullerene-based acceptors and ≤0.6 eV for NFAs). Energy loss because of charge transfer is one of the factors in the decrease of both the VOC and power conversion efficiency of OPV cells. Compared to fullerene derivatives, the easily tunable molecular structure and energy level of NFAs are advantageous to improving the photovoltaic performance and morphology of the blend film in OSCs. Compared to fullerene-based OSCs (having ΔECT > 0.3 eV, ΔEnr of 0.3–0.4 eV and a total Eloss >0.7 eV), the NFAs-based OSCs exhibit ΔECT values of 0.1–0.2 eV, ΔEnr of 0.2–0.3 eV, and a total Eloss ≤0.6 eV. The NFAs with a ladder-type core (especially fused thiophene containing cores) and cyano- or chloro-substituents expand the electron density distribution throughout the molecules, lower the EB and energy loss, and enhance the PCE of OSCs.17 In contrast to other building blocks such as benzothiophene (BDT), cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT), and naphthodithiophene (NDT), the pentacyclic IDT molecules with an extended conjugated system could produce highly desirable photo-physical and electronic properties such as high carrier mobility and low degree of energetic disorder.
IDT is a rigid, coplanar π-conjugated unit containing five fused rings. In the IDT moiety, five aromatic units are fused to form a single π-conjugated molecule with two bridging atoms. The two bridging atoms in IDT introduce the planarity in the molecule, decrease the energy loss from conformational disorder and provide an opportunity for alkyl/aromatic side chains which are beneficial to enhancing the solubility of the target molecules and the blend morphology of OPV devices (Fig. 1). Due to its potential advantages, like high hole mobility and ease of structural molecular engineering, IDT has been used as an important central building block for the construction of efficient light harvesting materials for OSCs.18–21 Different types of IDT core based light harvesting materials have been developed for OSCs and a power conversion efficiency of 12% has been attained.19 This review article examines the synthetic route of IDT cores with different side chains (alkyl and aryl) as well as recent research done in the area of IDT-based materials such as NFAs, hole transport materials and dyes for solar cell applications. For ease of understanding, the IDT-based materials are divided into four different catagories: polymer acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors, donor–π–acceptor conjugated polymers, and dyes. The impact of different kinds of donor/acceptor units on the overall performance of IDT-based materials is also discussed. Apart from this, we also discuss the effects of alkyl/aryl side chains on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic performances of IDT materials. In addition to covalently bonded ladder-type units, different ladder-type moieties with non-covalent interactions have also been developed.22–25 An affordable and eco-friendly quinacridone unit based ladder-type polymer (PIQA) with non-covalent interaction was explored by Fang's group.26 The synthetic scheme of two IDT cores with different side chains (alkyl and aryl) and PIQA is described in Scheme 1. Further functionalization can be done at the thiophene ring of the IDT moiety via Suzuki and Stille cross-coupling reactions. A variety of IDT-based materials (polymer donor and non-fullerene acceptor) have been explored and used in organic solar cells.19,27–31 Many highly efficient OSCs fabricated in recent years are materially correlated with IDT-based polymers and small molecules, which indicates that these materials have become an important category in organic photovoltaic devices.

2. Polymer acceptors
Importantly, the IDT core exhibits strong absorption in the 400 nm to 600 nm region of solar radiation which can be improved via introducing an electron withdrawing analogue that shifts the strong absorption towards the higher wavelength region of the solar spectrum.32 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BT) is one of the most widely used electron deficient units in electron donor and acceptor materials for OSCs. Due to its quasi-quinoidal structure and vacant π antibonding molecular orbitals, BT behaves as an electron deficient unit. Hence, BT reduces the band gap of the target molecule, which is beneficial to attaining a high open circuit voltage (VOC).33 Ting et al. were the first to explore amorphous polymer molecules based on IDT and BT conjugated units with a PCE of 6.45.02% (Fig. 1, A1).34 This IDT core underwent several advances in a very short time. By incorporating one and two fluorine atoms in a BT unit of polymer of A1, two new polymer materials (A2 and A3) were synthesized by Jen's research group.35 The electron withdrawing ability of fluorine atoms lowers the energy of both the HOMO and LUMO. Polymers A2 and A3 show lower-lying HOMO energy levels (−5.38 eV for A2 and −5.48 eV for A3), low band gaps (1.72 eV for A2 and 1.78 eV for A3), strong interchain interaction induced aggregation and high charge carrier mobility. The PCEs of polymers A2 and A3 reached 5.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Further, new polymer material A4 was explored using a strong electron withdrawing acceptor thiadiazolo[3,4-c] pyridine (PyT) unit in place of the BT unit. Acceptor PyT contains a pyridine ring in place of the benzene ring in BT.36 Polymer A4 exhibited a lower band gap and lower-lying HOMO energy level compared to its BT analogue. A PCE of 3.41% was obtained for polymer A4 which was fabricated with fullerene derivative PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester). The innovative polymer molecule A5 with IDT as the donor unit and monofluoro-2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole (FBSe) as the acceptor unit was developed by Li and co-workers.37 Polymer A5 showed broad ranging absorption and a low-lying HOMO energy level. The BHJ solar cell with the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/bis-C60/Ag attained a PCE of 4.65% with a VOC of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 10.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.53. The energy levels and device performances of A1–A5 are listed in Table 1.

3. IDT-based non-fullerene acceptors
Indacenodithieno thiophene (IDTT) is the extended form of indacenodithiophene (IDT). Both IDT- and IDTT-based materials have strong intramolecular charge transfer and absorption in a wide range of solar radiation. Because of their rigid co-planer structure, lower reorganization energy, and easily tuneable molecular and optoelectronic characteristics by molecular engineering, IDT or IDTT central core based non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with different chromophoric units as flanking groups have attained tremendous applications in BHJ.38 These acceptor materials contain out-of-plane alkyl or aryl side chains which are advantageous for easy processability, phase separation and enhanced charge carrier mobilities. A variety of IDT core based NFAs with different modifications at the side alkyl chains, such as π-spacer and terminal chromophoric groups, have been explored.
The first IDT core based NFA (DC-IDT2T) using thiophene as the linker and dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (DC) as the flanking group was developed by Zhan's research group. The BHJ solar cell based on the DC-IDT2T acceptor gave a PCE of 3.93%.30 Further IDT-based NFAs were explored by the same research group (Fig. 2).31,39,40 Two new acceptors, IDT-2BM and IDTT-2BM, using fused ring indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenothienodithiophene (IDTT) units as the central core and strong electron deficient unit 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-ylmethylene)malononitrile (BM) as the flanking group, were explored by same research group. The OSCs based on PBDTTT-C-T as donor and IDT-2BM and IDTT-2BM as acceptor gave PCEs of up to 4.26% and 4.81%, respectively (Table 2).41

Laio and co-workers developed a fused 10-heterocyclic (indacenodithiophene-indacenodithiophene) containing NFA (IDTIDT-IC) with a low LUMO energy level, broad absorption and low band gap. The OSC based on PTB7-Th:IDTIDT-IC composite film yielded a higher PCE up to 6.48% with lower energy loss than PTB7-Th:IDT-IC blend film based solar cells (PCE = 3.16%).42 The ITIC acceptor material was developed using IDTT as a core unit flanked with INCN acceptor groups which afforded a PCE of 6.8% when fabricated with PTB7-Th polymer donor material.31 The ITIC acceptor achieved maximum PCEs up to 12.80% when fabricated with different polymer donor materials.43–50 Another NFA (IEIC) was synthesized using IDTT as the central core, alkyl substituted thiophene as a spacer and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidine)malononitrile (INCN) as terminal end groups. The OSCs fabricated with the blend film of low band gap PTB7-Th (polymer donor) and IEIC (small molecule acceptor) achieved a PCE of 6.31% (Table 2).39
The new NFAs IT-M and IT-DM were developed via introducing mono and di-methyl substituted INCN as flanking groups in ITIC. The electron donating methyl group decreases the electron negativity of INCN, resulting in the elevation of the FMO energy levels of the molecules and, therefore, enhancing the VOC of OSCs. The OSC based on PBDB-T:IT-M film afforded a PCE up to 12.05%, while a PCE of 11.29% was attained with a PBDB-T:IT-DM based OSC.51 Another IDT based NFA, IC-C6IDT-IC, containing six hexyl side chains, was developed under one-step, facile reaction conditions. The OSCs based on PDBT-T1:IC-C6IDT-IC composite film without any post treatment achieved a PCE of over 8.71%.52 The weak electron donating IDT and IDTT cores have elongated π-frameworks and inflexible coplanar structures; due to this, NFAs made up of these units have a narrow band gap, high molar extinction coefficient in the range of 350 to 700 nm and high charge carrier mobility which is advantageous for high FF, Jsc and PCE in OSCs. Hou and co-workers developed a new NFA (IT-4F) by fluorination of ITIC at the terminal end group and attained a PCE up to 13% with polymer donor PBDB-T-SF.53 The IT-4F acceptor offered an outstanding efficiency of 14.4% when fabricated with PBDB-T-2Cl donor material (Table 2).15
Benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b] dithiophene (BDT) is a symmetrical, rigid medium electron donor, widely used as an electron rich unit to develop conjugated polymer donor materials for OSC applications. Recently, by incorporating different fused hetero aromatic units and further molecular modifications at the alkyl side chain and terminal electron withdrawing groups, a variety of BDT core based NFAs were explored. Of these, a few BDT based efficient NFAs are discussed in this review to compare IDT-, IDTT- and BDT-based NFAs. A bis-thiophene substituted BDT core (BDT-T) based NFA with an IC terminal group attached via a thiophene linker (BTCN-M) was developed by Liu et al. Because of the high steric hindrance of the alkyl groups present on the BDT unit, BTCN-M revealed weak π–π stacking as an acceptor material. Hence, the OPV devices based on BTCN-M:PBDB-T composite films showed a PCE of 5.89%.54 As an isomer of ITIC, an NFBDT acceptor based on a heptacyclic benzodi(cyclopentadithiophene) (FBDT) unit as the central donor and IC as flanking groups was developed by Kan's research group. Because of the symmetric, planar conjugated BDT unit, NFBDT has a low optical bandgap and the OPV device based on the PBDB-T:NFBDT blend film showed a PCE of 10.42%.55 By adding a 2-ethylhexyloxy side chain on the BDT core of NFBDT, a near-IR absorbing BT-IC NFA was designed and synthesized by Liao and co-workers. OSCs based on this acceptor offered PCEs up to 9.6% and 10.5% when fabricated with J61 and J71 donor materials, respectively.56 The ITIC2 NFA with 5-(2-ethylhexyl) thiophene units as conjugated side chains was an additional evolution of NFBDT which increased the optical absorption, intermolecular interaction and π–π stacking. Consequently, a high PCE of 11.0% was attained when it was blended with the polymer donor FTAZ.57 By introducing a Cl atom at the terminal end group of BT-IC, a new NFA (BT-CIC) was synthesized by Forrest et al. Electron withdrawing Cl atoms decrease the energy band gap and extend absorption via increasing intramolecular charge transfer. The single junction OSC based on PCE10:BT-CIC gave a PCE of over 11.2%.58 New NFAs, NFBDT-Me and NFBDT-F, with methyl and fluorine substituents at the terminal end groups (INCN) of the NFBDT acceptor, were also developed. Compared to NFBDT devices, NFBDT-Me and NFBDT-F based devices gave higher PCEs of 11.00% and 10.62%, respectively.59 Chen and coworkers explored two NFAs (F–M) via adding a methyl substituent at the flanking group of the F–H acceptor and (NOBDT) by introducing an octyloxy side chain at the core unit and a fluorine at the terminal, achieving a PCE of 10.55% when fabricated with wide band gap polymer PBDB-T and narrow band gap polymer PTB7-Th, respectively. A tandem OSC based on PBDB-T:F-M (front cell) and PTB7-Th:NOBDT (rear cell) demonstrated an outstanding PCE up to 14.11% with a VOC of 1.71 V.60 A new NFA (NCBDT-4Cl) containing an octyl side chain at the central unit and fluorine at the flanking group of the NFBDT acceptor was explored and the PBDB-T:NCBDT-4Cl based OSC offered a PCE of 14.1% (Table 2).61
4. IDT-based donor–π–acceptor conjugated polymers
These types of polymer materials are composed of alternating IDT donor and BDD acceptor units connected via π-spacers. These materials have easily tunable energy levels, optoelectronic characteristics and charge carrier mobilities.62–66 The photoelectronic properties of this type of molecule basically depend on the donor and acceptor moieties, while the π-bridge also plays a vital role in decreasing the steric hindrance and transforming the molecular conformation of the polymer backbone. Thiophene is a frequently used π-bridge for the synthesis of D–π–A molecules to lower the steric hinderance with adjacent groups; an additional intermolecular S–S non-covalent fragile interaction was also observed in such molecules. Benzene and selenophene are rarely used as π-spacer units in this type of material. The large distortion between the benzene H-atoms and neighbouring groups lowers the π–π stacking and intramolecular interaction and, hence, the molecules exhibit hypochromic shifted absorption.20,67,68 On account of the lower aromaticity of selenophene, the quinoidal resonance in the ground state of the polymers increases.69–72 The thiazole moiety can also be used as a π-bridge. Due to the presence of the more electronegative N atom in thiazole, the energy of FMO energy levels reduces. Two D–π–A conjugated polymers (PSeBDDIDT and PTzBDDIDT) with an IDT moiety as the donor and BDD as the acceptor were designed and synthesized for OSCs (Fig. 3).73 The photoelectronic characteristics of IDT-based D–π–A conjugated polymers are summarized in Table 3.

5. IDT-based dye materials for dye sensitized solar cells
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are supremely encouraging third-generation solar cells with high efficiency, cost effectiveness and straightforward device structure. A simple dye molecular design contains three units: an electron rich unit as the donor (D), a π-spacer and an electron deficient unit as the acceptor (A). Here, we discuss IDT (central π-spacer) and extended π-conjugated IDTT (spacer) based dyes with different donor and acceptor units (Fig. 4). The photoelectronic properties of these dyes are presented in Table 4. IDT-based dyes absorb light in the range of 490–520 nm. A series of p-hexyloxy phenyl substituted IDT (central π-spacer) based dyes (DPInDT, DTInDT and DMPInDT) employing different donors (diphenyl amine, p-methyl diphenyl amine and p-methoxy diphenyl amine) and cyano acetic acid as the acceptor were explored by Won et al. Because of the strong electron donating ability of p-methyl diphenyl amine and p-methoxy diphenyl amine, DTInDT and DMPInDT exhibit red shifted absorption and emission spectra compared to the DPInDT molecule, which indicate that the photoelectronic properties of dyes can be easily altered via increasing the electron donating ability of the donor unit in target molecules. Among these three dyes, the DTInDT molecule gave the highest efficiency of 6.67% with the highest Jsc and VOC values.74

6. Effect of side chain in IDT-based molecules
The IDT core has four positions for side chain (alkyl/aryl) substituents, which improve the solubility and morphology of composite films and hence increase the overall performance of OSCs. Compared to alkyl side chain-containing polymers, the phenyl side chain-based polymer materials show high VOC and low hole mobility. Szarko and co-workers reported the design and synthesis of IDT-based polymers with different side chains on thiophene and benzothiophene and also studied the impact of these modifications on the performance of OSCs.75–77 McCulloch and co-workers explored four IDT-based D–A polymers (B1–B4) using BT as the acceptor and different alkyl side chains as solubilising groups at the IDT donor unit (Fig. 5). The long linear alkyl side chains are beneficial for improving the optoelectronic properties of the molecules. Therefore, the hexadecyl substituted IDT based polymer B4 shows a more red shifted absorption profile than lower alkyl chain containing analogues. The branched alkyl side chains of medium length are advantageous for better phase separation and good PCEs of solar cells. (The medium length branched chain increased steric bulk and affected the π–π stacking distance, but has good solubility and chirality in comparison to shorter branched chains.) Because of this, polymer B2 offered higher efficiency than the B1, B3 and B4 polymers.78 A new IDT based polymer material with phenyl side chains and a quinoxaline spacer was synthesized by Yu's research group. Furthermore, polymer materials with molecular engineering at the phenyl side chain (changing the position of the alkyl groups at the phenyl ring) were explored by same research group. Dang and co-workers synthesized four polymers (B5, B6, B7 and B8) by changing the position of the hexyl group at the phenyl hexyl side chain of the IDT unit and by introducing different electron withdrawing groups at the quinoxaline π-spacer (Fig. 6 and Table 5). The meta-phenyl hexyl side chain containing polymers have higher VOC, Jsc and PCE values compared to the para-phenyl hexyl side chain containing polymers. Because of the higher steric hindrance occurring in the para side chain, the distance between the polymer backbones increases and hence B6 and B7 show lower PCE values than their meta-phenyl hexyl side chain containing analogues. Due to the greater electron donating effect of the alkyl side chain in para position, the IDT based polymers with para phenyl-hexyl side chains have a higher HOMO energy level and lower VOC.79 Apart from IDT based polymers, IDT derivative indacenodiselenophene (IDS) based polymer materials (B9 (PIDSeBT-OC8), B10 (PIDSeBT-C6), B11 (PIDSeDFBT-OC8) and B12 (PIDSeDFBT-C6)) were designed and synthesized by Cheng's research group. Additionally, different molecular engineering was performed on the side chains of the IDS unit and the acceptor units to understand the impact on the overall performance of donor materials. Among these polymers, B10 (PIDSeBT-C6) offered better optoelectronic properties and the highest PCE of 3.9% without any post treatment (Fig. 7 and Table 5).76

7. Conclusion
Indacenodithiophene (IDT) is a widely employed planar, rigid, ladder-type weak electron donating unit used to construct polymers and small molecule photoactive materials for OSC applications. The optoelectronic properties, light harvesting efficiency, charge transportation ability and molecular packing can be easily improved via state-of-the-art molecular design and synthesis approaches. This paper concentrates on different types of IDT-based materials, such as A–D–A, D–π–A and D–A, as well as further modifications in those materials to improve the overall performance of OSCs.
IDT shows absorption in the 400–600 nm range of solar radiation which can be improved via incorporating different electron deficient and rich units such as BT, TT, TPD, and DPP to develop materials for OSCs. IDT-based materials have low band gaps (2–1 eV) with propitious FMO energy levels. Side chain substituents at the IDT units play an important role in increasing solubility as well as other properties of optoelectronic materials. Aryl side chains reduce the band gap by increasing the conjugation of target molecules. IDT-based conjugated polymers with good solubility, wide absorption in the visible and near infra-red regions and appropriate energy levels have been used as donor materials for fullerene and non-fullerene based OSCs. Apart from donor materials, IDT-based acceptor materials, especially NFAs, are encouraging alternatives to fullerene derivatives. A variety of IDT-based A–D–A NFAs have been developed with innovative modifications at the central core and terminal end groups to fabricate efficient BHJ solar cells. Still, more efforts in the development of IDT-based materials are required to increase the performance of OSCs. We need to understand the correlation between different units of the molecule and the microstructure of molecules, their charge mobility and photoelectronic characteristics. We hope that this review will provide guidelines for the design and synthesis of efficient IDT-based materials for OSC applications.
