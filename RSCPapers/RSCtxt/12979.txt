    , Accepted 14th October 2017First published on 16th October 2017AbstractHerein, we developed a highly stable planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a novel architecture (ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/carbon tape). The PSC was developed under atmospheric conditions using GO/PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer and carbon tape as a back contact. The fabricated device showed good stability and performance with a power conversion efficiency of 5.2%. The fabricated devices were exposed to ambient condition for 96 h to show excellent stability. Remarkably, we found that the stability of the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell was attributed to the presence of GO, which inhibited direct contact between PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3.
1. Introduction
The major challenge in today's world is to develop low-cost, robust, high-power conversion, efficient and regenerating power resources. Harnessing solar energy has been considered as one of the most promising route to address the world energy crisis.1 In the last few years, thin film solar cells have become more popular due to their easy fabrication process, low cost, light weight and high performance.1 Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSC) have attracted considerable attention because of their easy manufacturing process, low cost and high performance.2,3 Various research groups have improved the performance of the PSC through the solvent engineering, mixed halide perovskites and employing different metal oxides such as Al2O3 and TiO2, which require high temperature that makes them unsuitable for flexible power sources.4–7 To overcome such issues, a planar hetero-junction PSC with the architecture (ITO)/HTL/CH3NH3PbX3/1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl-(6,6)C61(PCBM)/metal cathode was developed.8 In a PSC, the use of Au and Ag metals requires thermal evaporation, which involves complicated vacuum technology. Moreover, the use of expensive metal electrodes also increases the manufacturing cost of the PSC. Therefore, an alternative material is required to replace these precious metal electrodes. Graphene and graphene oxide (GO) play a vital role in the field of materials science due to their exceptional properties. GO has also been employed in solar cells due to its unique properties such as its high electrical/thermal conductivity, low band gap, mechanical strength and tunable work function. There exist few reports on GO based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a PCE of up to 13.3%.8–10 Recently, Agresti et al.11 reported a PSC with modification of GO with Li and the obtained PCE was found to be 11.14%, while in another report the PCE reached up to 12.94% on introducing nitrogen doped graphene oxide. However, in the reported literature, PCE of the devices was quite interesting but the use of expensive metal contacts (Ag/Au or ZnO/Au) limits their application for commercialization. Stability is also another major drawback for the PSC devices, which need to be addressed. Therefore, to overcome these issues, we have designed PSC device with the novel architecture (ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/carbon tape). In this study, the fabricated PSC device involve GO as an efficient hole transport layer with carbon tape as a metal contact. The as-fabricated PSC device (ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PCBM/carbon tape) shows a reasonably good PCE with high stability for 96 h.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Alfa Aesar and were used as received.
2.2 Instrumental
The powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) were analyzed using a Rigaku, Japan, RINT 2500 V X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The structural properties and elemental constituents of the synthesized samples were characterized using a Supra 55 Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) attached with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy system (Oxford Instruments’ X-max, Aztec). Furthermore, the morphological characteristics were also observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM CM 200). The photocurrent−voltage analysis was carried out using a homemade solar simulator composed of a xenon arc lamp connected with a PGSTAT 204N under the AM 1.5G condition of 100 mW cm−2 illumination.
2.3 Synthesis of MAPbI3
First, CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized according to a method reported elsewhere.8 MAPbI3 was synthesized by grinding equimolar quantities of MAI and PbI2 using the solid state reaction method. The synthesized black powder of MAPbI3 was heated at 120 °C and then placed in a desiccator till further use.
2.4 Fabrication of PSC
An indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate with a sheet resistance of ∼10 Ω sq−1 was etched using 2 M HCl and zinc powder. Subsequently, it was washed with detergent, followed by acetone and ethanol using an ultrasonicator. An aqueous solution of GO (synthesized according to our previous report) and PEDOT:PSS was spin coated onto the ITO glass substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and baked at 120 °C for 25 min; subsequently, a 40 wt% MAPbI3 precursor solution was spin coated at 6000 rpm for 40 s and heated at 100 °C for 30 min. PCBM in chlorobenzene (30 mg mL−1) was deposited onto the surface of the deposited perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 60 s and finally a carbon tape was pasted to complete the device (ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/carbon).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization
GO was employed as an efficient hole transporting layer incorporated between the PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3 to improve the stability of the PSC device. To check the formation of GO, an XRD pattern was recorded with a 2θ range of 2°–80°. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern for the synthesized GO. The obtained results exhibited a very strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.97°, corresponding to the (001) plane, which confirmed the formation of GO. This could be due to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the carbon sheets.12
The phase purity and the formation of MAPbI3 powder were checked by recording the XRD pattern in the 2θ range of 10°–60°. The XRD pattern of the synthesized MAPbI3 powder exhibited well-defined (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), (411), (314) and (204) planes, which were in agreement with the previously reported literature.13,14 Furthermore, the diffraction peak appearing at 2θ = 10.57° was attributed to the (001) plane corresponding to PbI2 (Fig. 1).13,14
 Fig. 1  XRD pattern of synthesized MAPbI3 powder; inset shows the digital image of the MAPbI3 powder. 
To show the effect of the hole transporting layers, MAPbI3 films were prepared on PEDOT:PSS (red), GO (black) and GO/PEDOT:PSS (blue). The XRD patterns for the prepared films were recorded and the observed peaks corresponded to the (110), (220), (310), (312), (224) and (314) planes, which were in good agreement with the previously reported literature (Fig. 2).15
 Fig. 2  XRD pattern of MAPbI3 films prepared on PEDOT:PSS (red), GO (black) and GO/PEDOT:PSS (blue); inset shows the digital image of the respective films. 
The obtained data showed a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 13.71°, assigned to the (110) plane for all the MAPbI3 films on different hole transporting layers with high crystallinity. The other diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ = 28.37° and 31.81° corresponded to the (220) and (310) planes, respectively, which are present for all the prepared films on different hole transporting layers. However, the other planes (312), (224) and (314) were present with strong diffraction peaks for the MAPbI3 films prepared on (GO) and (GO/PEDOT:PSS) compared to the MAPbI3 films prepared on (PEDOT:PSS). Therefore, a higher PCE could be expected for the prepared devices with (GO) and (GO/PEDOT:PSS) compared to the prepared device with PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, we have investigated the role of the hole transporting layer using UV-vis spectroscopy and FE-SEM analysis to check the absorption and surface morphological properties, respectively.
The absorption peak for MAPbI3 films prepared on different hole transporting layers were observed between 750–800 nm using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 3). The light harvesting ability was found to be similar for all the prepared CH3NH3PbI3 films on different hole transporting layers. The formation of pin hole-free MAPbI3 films is desirable to achieve high performance PSCs with good stability. Moreover, to control or minimize the deviation in the surface morphology of the MAPbI3 films is also the most important factor and a huge challenge. Previously, researchers have prepared perovskite films by solvent engineering16 to overcome such issues; still, the formation of high crystalline, pin hole free perovskite film remains a challenge.
 Fig. 3  UV-vis spectra of MAPbI3 films prepared on PEDOT:PSS (red), GO (black) and GO/PEDOT:PSS (blue). 
Therefore, we studied different hole transport layers to achieve homogeneous, smooth and pin hole-free perovskite films. Fig. 4 shows the FE-SEM images for the MAPbI3 films prepared on PEDOT:PSS, GO and GO/PEDOT:PSS. The MAPbI3 film prepared on GO/PEDOT:PSS was found to be homogeneous and had large crystalline domains compared to the MAPbI3 film prepared on GO or PEDOT:PSS.8 From all the observations, it can be concluded that GO/PEDOT:PSS provides a smooth surface for the formation of a homogenous pin hole free MAPbI3 film which was found to be much better than those mentioned in previous reports.18,19 We believe that the incorporation of GO between PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3 has efficiently improved the performance and stability of the PSCs.

Recently, Lee et al. developed perovskite solar cells with a lateral configuration and achieved a PCE of 4.83%.16 Similarly, in our case, the MAPbI3 films were found to grow laterally with instant crystallization along the plane (001) as confirmed by cross sectional FE-SEM (Fig. S2A and B, ESI†) and TEM (Fig. S2C–E, ESI†) images. The lateral growth of the MAPbI3 could be due to the instant crystallization, which may open new routes towards perovskite solar cells for large scale production.16,17 The selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern confirms crystalline nature of the MAPbI3 film with bright spots (Fig. S2F, ESI†).
3.2 Device working and performance

Scheme 1 shows the energy level diagram of the fabricated planar heterojunction PSC. The performance of the planar PSC depends on smooth carrier transport to electrode from different layers such as hole transport and electron acceptor layers.

In general, PEDOT:PSS has been widely used as a hole transport layer from the MAPbI3 layer to the ITO glass substrate, but PEDOT:PSS suffers from some latent problems such as poor electron blocking ability, high acidity, hygroscopic nature and inhomogeneous electrical properties. Thus, to overcome these issues, an alternative hole transport layer was designed using a composite of PEDOT:PSS. The work function of GO is well known to be in agreement with the work functions of PEDOT:PSS and ITO, which provides an efficient way to transport the hole from the MAPbI3 layer to the ITO.8
GO was employed as a hole transport layer in the fabrication of planar PSC because of its vertical resistivity and suitable work function (4.9 eV).8 The potential of GO as a hole transport layer was evaluated using J–V characteristics as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The effect of GO as a hole transport layer was verified by three fabricated planar PSC devices: (i) PEDOT:PSS (device I), (ii) GO (device II), and (iii) GO/PEDOT:PSS (device III) and their performances were investigated using solar simulator conditions (Fig. S3, ESI†). The PSC device, which was fabricated using PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer, showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.1% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58 V, current density (Jsc) of 7.8 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 0.42. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS layer was replaced by GO as a hole transport layer which exhibited a PCE of 3.5% with an improvement in the current density as well as open circuit voltage, which suggested that the introduction of GO as a hole transport layer was more efficient. Further, we have fabricated a planar hetero-junction PSC device by employing GO/PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport layer; to our surprise, the PCE achieved an improvement of 5.2% compared to that of the other two devices (Table 1). In all the devices, carbon tape was used as a back contact to replace the expensive metal electrodes and these obtained results revealed the successful introduction of carbon tape in a planar heterojunction planar PSC. The optimization of the PSC devices is an important factor to keep a check on the performance of the devices. Since the thickness of the hole transport layer largely affects the performance of the solar cell devices, we have optimized the PSC device performance by employing a hole transport layer deposited at different rpm speeds by the spin coating process. PSC devices with a GO/PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer deposited at 2000 rpm, 300 rpm and 4000 rpm were fabricated and analyzed. The J–V characteristics of the devices fabricated with a GO/PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer deposited at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm and 4000 rpm revealed that the devices with 2000 rpm and 3000 rpm had poor performance compared to the device fabricated with a hole transport layer deposited at 4000 rpm (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, ESI†).

The stability of the PSCs is a serious issue; thus, to check the stability, we stored the fabricated PSCs devices for 96 h under atmospheric conditions and examined their performances. Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of the PSC device with the GO/PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer deposited at 4000 rpm after 96 h, showing higher stability compared to the PSC device fabricated in the absence of a GO (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer deposited at 4000 rpm (Fig. S5, ESI†) which could be due to the interaction between the highly acidic PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3.
The obtained results suggested that the introduction of GO with PEDOT:PSS prohibits the direct contact between PEDOT:PSS and MAPbI3, which in turn improves the stability of the PSC device. Furthermore, XRD analysis was carried out for freshly prepared MAPbI3 deposited on PEDOT:PSS and GO/PEDOT:PSS before and after exposure to atmospheric condition for 96 h to check the stability (Fig. 6). The obtained results showed that exposure to ambient conditions influences the XRD pattern of the MAPbI3 film deposited on PEDOT:PSS and a clear peak appearing at 12.31° was assigned to the crystal plane (001) corresponding to PbI2 as denoted by # in Fig. 6 (red). However, there was no noticeable difference in the XRD pattern of MAPbI3 film deposited on GO/PEDOT:PSS after exposure to 96 h, which confirmed that the introduction of GO improved the stability of the PSC device. Thus, the observed results suggested that the proposed device with the architecture (ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/carbon) is highly stable with optimized conditions.

Although perovskite solar cells with planar heterojunction architecture have shown excellent performance, the stability and the use of precious metals (Ag or Au) limit their commercialization. Thus, to address these issues, we have used carbon tape as the back contact to replace the metal contact. Previously, some studies have reported PSCs with good efficiency, but still suffered from the stability of the device under ambient conditions. First, we fabricated the perovskite solar cell device in the absence of GO and found that the performance and the stability of the device were poor. However, on the introduction of GO, the performance of the device improved, which could be due to the suitable work function of GO. Moreover, the stability of the device had also improved. The as-fabricated device shows improved PCE and stability over those of reported devices under ambient conditions (Table 2).

4. Conclusion
The role of GO as a hole transport layer in the fabrication of planar hetero-junction PSC with the architecture ITO/GO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/carbon tape was demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, we have developed, for the first time, a planar hetero-junction PSC with such architecture. The fabricated PSC with GO as a hole transport layer has shown excellent performance under ambient conditions with a PCE of 5.2%. In this study, the expensive metals such as Ag and Au have been replaced by simple carbon tape, which tremendously reduces the cost of the PSC with reasonably good PCE as compared to the PSC reported with expensive metals as the back contact.
