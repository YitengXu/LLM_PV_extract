    , Accepted 20th April 2021First published on 21st April 2021AbstractOptical nonlinearity of two-dimensional (2D) materials with a permanent dipole is a subject of intense research in the fields ranging from all-optical signal processing to laser nanotechnology due to the potential outstanding performance of 2D materials in nonlinear optical processes, and the feasibility for extensive integration into optoelectronic devices. In the present work, the group-VA binary monolayers are predicted to have giant and broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) properties superior to some of the most popular NLO materials by first-principles calculations. The SHG susceptibility of the α-PAs reaches up to 8.0 × 106 pm2 V−1, which is nearly 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that of honeycomb monolayer MoS2 and h-BN, and twice larger than the record-high SHG susceptibility of a 2D ferroelectric GeSe monolayer. This intriguing peak is formed by intraband two photon transition ascribed to the relatively small bandgap and large transition matrix elements between valence and conduction band edges. A high-performance nonlinear optical device can be developed using those 2D group-VA monolayer materials with puckled structure and in-plane polarizabilities for multifunctional and integrated optoelectronic applications.
1 Introduction
There continues to be considerable interest in materials with novel nonlinear optical (NLO) properties due to their important applications in optoelectronic technologies, such as optical parametric oscillators, difference frequency generation, laser frequency conversion, and signal communication.1,2 Nonlinear optical properties are highly dependent on the symmetry of materials. In the past few years, a renewed research interest in NLO materials from organic molecules to inorganic NLO crystals with broken symmetry has been ignited in both experiment and theory.3,4 Recently, non-centrosymmetric 2D materials have emerged as an effective candidate with intriguing NLO effects and numerous applications. For example, h-BN5,6 and MoS2 monolayers with broken in-plane inversion symmetry were reported to have a remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) with potential applications in nonlinear optical devices. van der Waals heterostructure,4,7 2D alloy compounds,8,9 and Janus 2D materials with out-of-plane mirror asymmetry10–12 guarantee the generation of even-order optical nonlinearities in their bulk or multilayer structures. Especially, ferroelectric (FE) 2D materials such as group IV monochalcogenides have good NLO properties which motivate us to explore these 2D ferroelectric materials as NLO materials.
2D group-VA materials and 2D group-IVA monochalcogenides are isoelectronic materials with similar puckled structures.13 Black phosphorus has been explored widely as a layered semiconductor material with in-plane anisotropy, tunable bandgap, the high carrier mobility at room temperature and strong infrared responsivity which is promising for high-performance optoelectronic applications.14 Recently, its highly anisotropic and layer dependent third order nonlinear optical effects were also reported.15 However, two critical shortcomings limit its application as a second order NLO material. First, chemical decomposition influences the lifetime of optoelectronic devices, especially under strong light irradiation.16–18 Second, the centrosymmetric D2h point group of the crystal structure eliminates the even order NLO responses. Group-VA binary materials provide the solutions to these two problems. In group-VA binary materials, the interplay between the crystal symmetry and spin–orbit coupling may lead to multiple applications including optoelectronics,19–24 magnetics25 and solar cells.26 For example, black PAs monolayer (α-PAs) has great prospects for photovoltaic devices because of the favorable direct bandgap, extremely high charge mobility of nearly 14000 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 22.1% power conversion efficiency.26–28 The thin film of α-PAs has been fabricated with molecule beam deposition29 or exfoliation30 with high stability.31 The α-NP has high stability31 and can sustain under 1500 K for several picoseconds as verified with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation.32
Earlier theoretical works33–35 revealed that the monolayer structures with puckled shape often possess a large SHG response.36,37 The two-band tight binding model interpreted the giant second harmonic generation and shift current of group-IVA monochalcogenides.38,39 The upper limit of shift current conductivity and SHG susceptibility were predicted through the Rice–Mele model.40 This limit can also be understood in the extended Kuzyk model41 based on the Wannier interpolation.42 In the framework of tight binding models, the underlying correlation mechanisms between second order nonlinear optical phenomena and in-plane polarization are determined by the puckled structure and polar covalent bonds in the armchair direction.36 There is intriguing dependency between in-plane dipole and the second order nonlinear optical susceptibility.38,42 Thus, it is desirable to study the nonlinear optical properties of α-phase 2D group-VA binary materials.
In this work, the SHG properties of a puckled α-PAs monolayer and α-NP monolayer are explored with first principles calculations. The SHG responses of monolayer α-PAs reach nearly twice the largest value of group-IVA monochalcogenides. The anisotropic behaviors of NLO properties are studied through the angle-resolved diagram of the SHG responses in different incident and polarization angles. The critical role of bandgap is identified through analyzing the contributions of different transition components and processes. The permanent dipole plays an important role on the SHG behaviors of α-PAs and α-NP monolayers. Both bandgap and permanent dipole can be modified by structural asymmetry and the polarity of bonds between different elements.
2 Methods
The atom relaxation of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers is performed with Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)43 using the generalized gradient approximations with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation potentials.44 During the optimization, a 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst k-mesh is applied with the kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV to make sure that all forces on each atom is smaller than 10−5 eV Å−1. A 22 Å thick vacuum is used to avoid the fake interlayer interactions. The N–P bond distances in the α phase show a small variation from 1.83 Å to 1.74 Å, shorter than the P–P bond in black phosphorus. The As–P bonds are close to 2.38 Å, showing smaller variation with respect to black phosphorus. The ground state electronic properties are predicted with the all-electron full potential linearized augmented-plane wave (LAPW) Elk code with 150 empty bands and 80 × 120 × 1 k-mesh. The symmetric mirror of α-NP and α-PAs is along the y-axis marked in Fig. 1b and c. The electronic polarization was calculated using the Berry phase method45via Quantum Espresso code with 24 × 24 × 1 k-mesh.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Electronic and linear absorption properties of α-PAs and α-NP monolayers
The structures of the α-NP and α-PAs monolayer are established with substitution of half of the phosphorus atoms in the pristine black phosphorus by (Fig. 1a) nitrogen and arsenic atoms, as shown in Fig. 1b and c.
The band structures and projected density of states (PDOS) of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers are shown in Fig. 2, and the compositions of the edge states are listed in Table 1. The critical information about band structure is shown in Table 2. The α-PAs monolayer possesses a direct bandgap (Fig. 2a) and the band dispersion looks quite similar to that of phosphorene. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) have dominant contributions from the pz orbitals of P and As. Furthermore, the conduction band minimum has more contribution from the py orbitals in comparison with the valence band. These similar characters are commonly observed in monolayer group-IVA monochalcogenide such as GeS, GeSe and SnS.37 In the α-NP monolayer, although the position of VBM is still at the Γ point, the position of CBM lies between Γ and X, and their compositions become more complex. The VBM of the α-NP monolayer is dominated by the pz orbitals, with a minority of contribution from s orbitals. Contributions to the CBM are mainly from the px and py orbitals.

Due to the different electronegativities, phosphorus is the electron donor in the α-NP monolayer, and it is the electron acceptor in the α-PAs monolayer. The stronger polarity of the P–N bond than the P–As bond leads to an indirect bandgap and the absence of parabolic band nature of band dispersion along the Γ–Y direction in the α-NP monolayer (Fig. 2b). The asymmetric wavefunction of the VBM and CBM along the z axis is observed in these two monolayers, especially with larger distortion in the α-NP monolayer. In puckled structures, the dipole moment in each unit cell is along the same direction, thus forming a macroscopic permanent dipole in these 2D monolayers. Two effects of dipole moment on the electronic properties of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers can be observed. First, as shown in Fig. 2, the α-NP monolayer has large dipole moment, 0.0244 cm−2, which is 1.62 times as large as that of the α-PAs monolayer, 0.0150 cm−2. This leads to the large modification of band dispersion of the α-NP monolayer in contrast to that of black phosphorus. Second, in the α-NP monolayer, the local transition from the top valence band to the lowest conduction band is more likely to occur, because these bands consist of orbitals from the same atoms. Those features have significant effect on SHG susceptibilities.
GW-BSE calculations of the imaginary part of the dielectric function are carried out for the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers. The quasiparticle shift, which is taken as the difference between the energy of the most stable exciton and the electronic bandgap, is introduced in the GW-BSE calculations. Like that of phosphorene, the linear dielectric responses of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers exhibit an anisotropic feature: the onset of the α-PAs monolayer along the armchair direction (y) is below 1.14 eV, corresponding to the first exciton state composed of electrons and holes at the Γ point. The absorption onset along the zigzag direction (x) appears at 1.85 eV, composed of the first exciton state dominated by the transitions at the point (1/6, 0, 0) in the first Brillouin zone. For the α-NP monolayer, the onsets of the first peak are 2.7 eV and 3.49 eV for εyy and εxx respectively. Their intensities are significantly stronger than the other transitions, showing the highly localized character of the exciton state. The linear responses amended by the scissor operator have similar features to that obtained from GW-BSE calculations, as shown in Fig. 3. Though there still exists controversy about the role of exciton in the prediction of the second-order nonlinear optical properties,46–49 it is valuable to explore the mechanism of the nonlinear optical response by the prediction based on independent particle assumption, because the role of intrinsic dipole can be certainly observed.

The blue lines are obtained from independent particle assumption with scissor operators to match the first absorption edge and peaks. 
3.2 Second harmonic generation of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers
The SHG susceptibility is obtained according to the sum of states method based on the transitions between electronic states driven by optical excitation.50–52 The susceptibilities could be divided into interband and intraband parts χabc(−2ω, ω, ω) = χabcinter(−2ω; ω, ω) + χabcintra(−2ω; ω, ω) + χabcmod(−2ω; ω, ω), using the expansions deduced by Sharma52 (1) (2) (3)where rbmlrcln ≡ (rbmlrcln + rcmlrbln)/2. The prime on the symbol of sum represents the Einstein summation convention. Wk is the weight of k-points. m, n and l are indices of valence bands, conduction bands and any band that l ≠ m, n.52ωmn is the frequency difference between states m and n. ranm is the interband transition operator between bands m and n along direction a, whereas Δcmn is the group velocity difference between bands m and n along the c direction, which is related to the intraband electron motion. The modification term shows the physical process that the energy of polarizations is modulated by the interband motions. The band tailing parameter is 0.05 eV for eliminating the divergence from the Dirac δ functions.
The 2D group-VA binary materials with black-phosphorus phase possess a similar structural symmetry with ferroelectric group-IVA monochalcogenides: a twofold axis along the zigzag direction and high asymmetry along the armchair direction. The symmetry of the α-PAs monolayer degrades from D2h-7(53) to C2v-1(31) and decreases further to Cs-1(6) for the α-NP monolayer. Due to symmetry degradation, the SHG susceptibility tensors of the α-PAs monolayer have the following seven non-zero components: χ(2)xyx = χ(2)xxy, χ(2)zzy = χ(2)zyz, χ(2)yxx, χ(2)yzz and χ(2)yyy. For the α-NP monolayer, four in-plane and three out-of-plane additional nonzero components emerge: χ(2)xzx = χ(2)xxz, χ(2)zzz, χ(2)zxx, and χ(2)zyy, χ(2)yyz = χ(2)yzy.
The large magnitude of SHG is the first intriguing feature of the in-plane susceptibilities of the α-PAs monolayer. The static second order NLO susceptibility limit of the α-PAs monolayer is 233 pm V−1 for bulk SHG tensor, or 0.443 nm2 V−1 for sheet SHG tensor. It is four times as large as the predicted static second order NLO susceptibility of GeSe, and larger than the susceptibility of promising candidate materials for nonlinear optical devices, such as the predicted SHG susceptibility of MoS2,57 and the measured effective SHG susceptibility of bulk GaAs58(57 pm V−1). It is close to the theoretical upper limit predicted by the two-band tight binding model based on Wannier functions.57 For the dynamical SHG response which are all plotted in Fig. 4, the in-plane χ(2)yyy of the α-PAs monolayer reaches nearly 8 × 103 pm V−1 at the infrared wavelength of 1.3 μm, indicating the strong competitiveness in optical signal possessing in the infrared range as shown in Fig. 4b and Table 3. The sheet SHG tensor is around 1.49 × 107 pm2 V−1 with a nearly 19 Å vacuum layer. This magnitude is much larger than the second harmonic generation of 2D MoS2 (1 × 104 pm2 V−1 ∼ 6 × 104 pm2 V−1) and h-BN (0.1 × 104 pm2 V−1 ∼ 0.6 × 104 pm2 V−1) and is nearly double that of the monolayer GeSe.5

Because of the asymmetry along the z axis, the α-NP monolayer has a weaker out-of-plane SHG response. The ratio between the components of SHG susceptibilities is |χ(2)zzz:χ(2)yyy| ∼ 1:10 at the peak near the bandgap for the α-NP monolayer. Other in-plane susceptibilities χ(2)xxx for both monolayers are vanishing because of the symmetric configuration of atoms along the zigzag direction.
The angle resolved SHG response is predicted with incident angle θ and polarization angle ϕ related to the zigzag direction to explore the anisotropy of the SHG response (Fig. 5). Along the incident light, the parallel SHG response component of the α-PAs monolayer is absent and the intensity of perpendicular component is denoted as:59 (4)

(c) The polar diagram for the SHG parallel component of the α-NP monolayer. 
For the α-NP monolayer, when the incident light is not perpendicular to the surface (θ ≠ 0°), an additional parallel component emerges: (5)
The SHG polarization of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers with incident angle θ = 30°, 45° and 60° are shown in Fig. 5. At the wavelength 1064 nm, the magnitude of absolute value of all related nonzero susceptibilities are |χ(2)yyy|:|χ(2)xxy|:|χ(2)yxx|:|χ(2)yzz| = 265:28.0:71.3:7.51 for α-PAs monolayer, |χ(2)yyy|:|χ(2)xxy|:|χ(2)yxx|:|χ(2)yzz| = 18.3:8.14:13.9:3.35 and |χ(2)xxz|:|χ(2)yyz|:|χ(2)zxx|:|χ(2)zyy|:|χ(2)zzz| = 3.10:34.3:30.9:28.3:3.55 for the α-NP monolayer. The large in-plane SHG susceptibilities of the α-PAs monolayer result in nearly 10-time enhancement of SHG intensity with respect to that of the α-NP monolayer. In all the cases with different incident angles, four-fold symmetries are observed in all SHG intensities due to the orthorhombic structure of the lattice. The dependence on the polarized angle ϕ of the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers are distinct: the critical angle for the maximum of SHG intensity is 45° in the α-PAs monolayer, and 0° in the α-NP monolayer. Both the parallel and perpendicular components of SHG for the α-NP monolayer show better directionality than that of the α-PAs monolayer, and they are suitable for nonlinear optical processes under infrared laser. The nonzero out-of-plane susceptibilities lead to the significant dependence on the incident angle θ. The relatively large out-of-plane SHG responses make the α-NP monolayer an excellent alternative to transition metal dichalcogenides for nonlinear optical devices.
3.3 Discussion
First, we focused on the intriguing in-plane component χ(2)yyy of the α-PAs monolayer. To better understand the SHG susceptibility, the imaginary part of the double-frequency linear optical absorption spectra (Im[εyy(2ω)]) is predicted (Fig. 6a). This is to approximate the two-photon processes with identical energy related to the double-photon resonance. The profile of the double resonant spectra resembles that of the SHG spectra. It illustrates that, at a low energy region, the characteristic peak of χ(2)yyy comes from the double photon resonance. This agrees with the trend in the real and imaginary part of the SHG response, which are shown in Fig. 6c and e respectively.59,60 The contribution from single-photon transition and double-photon transition in the opposite direction largely diminishes the response at the photon energy of 3.5 eV. Explicitly, the marked A, B, C, and D peaks in the spectrum (Fig. 4b) are generated from transitions shown with corresponding shadowed rectangles in Fig. 2a. The peak A corresponds to the resonant energy at the Γ point in the band structure. The peak B at 1.06 eV originates from the double photon transition from the highest valence band to the second lowest conduction band with 1.96 eV transition energy at Γ point. The peak C at 1.28 eV arises from the double photon transitions at the Γ point from the third highest valence band to the lowest conduction band with a 2.39 eV transition energy. The peak D at 1.39 eV originates from the double photon transitions at the band edge of the Y point with a 2.61 eV transition energy.
 Fig. 6  The in-plane SHG components (in atomic units) χ(2)yyy of the α-PAs monolayer (a, c and e) and the α-NP monolayer (b, d and f) corresponding to the photon transition process. The red and blue shadow in (a and b) are the linear optical absorption without double-frequency process (Im[εyy(ω)]) and with double-frequency processes (Im[εyy(ω/2)]) respectively. (c) to (f) are the decomposition of these SHG components into single photon and double photon transition processes. 
In addition, the first peaks of the three in-plane SHG components: χ(2)yxx, χ(2)yyy, and χ(2)yzz, have the same transition origin at the Γ point. They correspond to the blue, red, and black arrows at the right margin of Fig. 2a, respectively. Those peaks have slightly different positions, and their strongest responses follow this order: χ(2)yyy > χ(2)yxx > χ(2)yzz (nearly 78:8.7:1.3), i.e. the dipole moment along the y-axis significantly enhances the corresponding response χ(2)yyy. In addition, the strongest peak of χ(2)yxx is ascribed to the transition from the highest valence band to the second lowest conduction band at Γ point (marked with a blue arrow and green rectangle at the left of the margin in Fig. 2a). The strongest peak of χ(2)xyx corresponds to the transition from the third highest valence band to the second lowest conduction band at the Γ point, as shown by the orange arrow and purple rectangle at the left of the margin in Fig. 2a. The transition with energy 3.70 eV at the M point (green arrow in Fig. 2a) contributes to the predominant peak of χ(2)zzy.
For the α-NP monolayer, the largest SHG susceptibility is 940 pm V−1 for χ(2)zxx, which is comparable to the MoS2 monolayer. It comes from the transition at the Γ point (the red shadowed rectangle in Fig. 2b). Because of the lower symmetry, the α-NP monolayer has more independent nonzero SHG components than the α-PAs monolayer. The spectra of all ten nonzero components are presented in Fig. 4f–m. They share the same peak at 1.57 eV, corresponding to the transition from occupied bands to the conduction band minimum (blue shadowed rectangle in Fig. 2b). From Fig. 6d and f, the peak of the α-NP monolayer at 1.57 eV is wider than that of the α-PAs monolayer, which is related to the indirect bandgap of the α-NP monolayer. In addition, the SHG components in the same response direction have response peaks with similar positions. For example, χ(2)yxx, χ(2)yyy and χ(2)yzz possess peaks with the same photon energy of 1.20 eV at the Γ point. They also have similar peaks at 1.31 eV and 1.57 eV. In the low energy region, their strongest responses follow this order: χ(2)yxx > χ(2)yyy > χ(2)yzz (nearly 9.4:5.1:1.0) and χ(2)zxx > χ(2)zyy > χ(2)zzz(nearly 3.8:1.3:0.6), different from those of the α-PAs monolayer because of the lower symmetry in the α-NP monolayer than the α-PAs monolayer.
The SHG tensor χ(2)yyy of both the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers can also be decomposed into the interband term (eqn (1)) and intraband term (Fig. 7). The intraband term consists of the pure intraband term (eqn (2)) and band modification term due to intraband transitions (eqn (3)). Both the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers show the same behavior. In the low energy range, the intraband term dominates the in-plane SHG responses, and this indicates that the group velocity difference term Δmn of the band structure dominates the SHG response of these materials. In the high energy range above the bandgap, there are comparable but opposite contributions from the intraband term and interband term.60 The role of the interband term in the α-NP monolayer is more important than it is in the α-PAs monolayer. These differences between the α-NP monolayer and the α-PAs monolayer come from two aspects. First, the expansion of bandgap of the α-NP monolayer reduces the overall SHG response. Second, the large modification of wavefunction and the larger dipole of the α-NP monolayer change the band shape thus the transition as implied in the interband term, thus that strong SHG response does not occur in the α-NP monolayer.
 Fig. 7  The decomposition of SHG tensor (χ(2)yyy) into interband and intraband photon transition processes. (a and c) The α-PAs monolayer; (b and d) the α-NP monolayer. 
From eqn (2), the contribution of the two-photon process to the intraband term of SHG susceptibility at a low frequency can be described through the second term −8iωmn−2(ωmn − 2ω)−1ranm{Δbmnrcmn}, involving the effect of two bands m = v and n = c and ignoring the last term of eqn (2). It reaches the maximum at the frequency ω = ωmn/2. The contribution of the intraband two-photon transition is defined as Tabc ≡ −iωmn−2ranmΔbmnrcmn, and the component Tyyy is (6)
The absolute values of Tyyy for the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers in their first Bullion zones are shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. All the values are normalized to the maximum of Tyyy for the α-PAs monolayer, which is 77 times larger than the maximum of the α-NP monolayer. Although the differences of absolute value of momentum matrix elements vynm (Fig. 8g and h) and the group velocity difference Δymn (Fig. 8e and f) between the α-PAs and α-NP monolayers are not obvious, the discrepancy of Tyyy is amplified significantly because of the relatively small bandgap in the α-PAs monolayer (Fig. 8c and d). For the α-PAs monolayer, there exists an intriguing area along the Γ–Y direction and nearby Y point showing a semi-Dirac dispersion in the band structure (Fig. 2a). This semi-Dirac cone leads to an opposite group velocity distribution on both sides. As a result, the region with large velocity matrix is established. With the narrowing of the bandgap, it enables the contribution of Tabc to the SHG susceptibilities. Atomic orbital decomposition reveals that py orbitals dominate this semi-Dirac zone with significant contribution to the enhancement of χ(2)yyy, indicating the important role of the permanent dipole along the y direction. For the α-NP monolayer, there is a similar large contribution along the Γ–X direction due to the parabolic band dispersion at the CBM near the X point. That additional contribution leads to the enhancement of the SHG response along the x polarization direction (Fig. 4f–h and k–m). The permanent dipole leads to the generation of second order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction. It is valuable to note that although the magnitude is small, the α-NP monolayer has more nonzero SHG responses related to the out-of-plane direction, which can utilize incident light in various directions in practical applications.

The values from (a) to (f) are normalized to the maximum of the α-PAs monolayer. 
4 Conclusions
The SHG properties of group-VA binary materials: the α-NP and α-PAs monolayers have been investigated systematically with first-principles calculations. The low symmetry in group-VA binary monolayers produce unique NLO properties. The permanent dipole plays an important role in the electron transition process in three aspects: breaking the symmetry, modifying the band dispersion, and altering the optical matrix elements of those materials. The distortion along the armchair direction and the relatively small bandgap grant the α-PAs monolayer with record high in-plane SHG susceptibility. Because of the large and highly anisotropic SHG susceptibility in visible wavelengths, the 2D group-VA binary materials with α-phase is expected to be star NLO materials and an alternative to ferroelectric group-IVA monochalcogenide. This work provides useful information for developing nonlinear optical materials for information processing and photovoltaic devices with multi-functions and high efficiency.
