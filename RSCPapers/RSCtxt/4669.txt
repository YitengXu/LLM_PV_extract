    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 3rd January 2017AbstractHierarchical nanotubes@mesoporous carbon composite materials were controllably synthesized by an innovative method based on plant waste corncob and nitrogen source melamine via thermal treatment. The corncob provides both a carbon source and a small amount of Fe as the catalyst, while melamine offers a nitrogen source. Corncobs were firstly pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid and then mixed with melamine. After calcination at 800 °C for 2 hours, a new composite carbon material with a unique structure with a large amount of thin walled nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes orderly and vertically growing on the mesoporous carbon frame was obtained. The diameter of nanotubes is ∼50 nm while their length varies from 0.1–20 μm, which could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of pretreated corncob to melamine. Meanwhile, the composite material possesses stable interconnected pores and channels with a high surface area of 1100 m2 g−1, which significantly accelerated the transfer rates of ions and electrons. The electrochemical test results demonstrated that this composite material exhibits a superior capacitance of 538 F g−1 in an aqueous electrolyte and 320 F g−1 in an organic electrolyte at a current density of 1 A g−1. The specific capacitance of the composite material remained up to 90% of the initial value after 10000 cycles, showing excellent long-term cycling stability. For lithium sulfur battery application, the composite material as a sulfur host delivered an initial capacity of 1047 mA h g−1, and exhibited a relatively stable cycling performance, maintained a capacity of 682 mA h g−1 for 300 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5C. The structure, morphology and growth mechanism of the composite material were also analyzed and discussed in detail.
Introduction
Nowadays energy and the environment have become two major issues for sustainable social development. Energy is the main force driving economic and social development, while fossil fuels still occupy the dominant position of all the energy forms. With the over exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels, the greenhouse effect and environmental pollution are getting increasingly deteriorated. Therefore, the development of new and renewable clean energy is becoming significantly important for human survival and development. Biomass energy, stored in the biomass, is one of the most important renewable energies but is far from fully used. The utilization rate of biomass energy is quite low. Derived from plants and animals, biomass can directly or indirectly convert solar energy to chemical energy through photosynthesis of green plants and store it in the bodies. The basic components of plant biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, plant protein and plant lipids, which possess stable molecular structures. Although there are various types of biomass, the main elements of biomass are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and a small amount of sulfur. Nowadays, large amounts of rich carbon-containing biomass is buried with life garbage or incinerated to be poisonous gas. Both ways exacerbate environmental pollution and have been proved to be unreasonable.
Besides being used as fuel, biomass can also be reused by fermenting to be alcohol, pyrolyzing to be syngas fuel and preparing carbon materials. In the past two years, using biomass as a carbon source to synthesize heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials has become an important direction in the carbon nanomaterial field. Nazar L. F. et al.1 selected cellulose as a carbon source while polyrhodanine as nitrogen and sulfur sources to produce a N, S co-doped carbon nanomaterial via an annealing process under an inert atmosphere, and the obtained material had superior chemisorption to the polysulfide compound (Sn2−) and hence improved the cycling stability of lithium–sulfur batteries. Similarly, amaranth,2 water hyacinth,3 corn sticks,4 cattail flower, stem,5 neem leaves6 or other plant waste serving as the carbon source were successfully used to prepare a variety of nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials with NH3 or other nitrogen-containing compounds as the nitrogen source by annealing under an inert atmosphere.7 The synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials exhibit excellent electrochemical activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or electrochemical capacitors. In addition, some biomass like silk,8 glue,9 human hair10 and other natural protein materials were converted to nitrogen (or sulfur, boron)-doped carbon nanomaterials by calcining at a high temperature under an inert atmosphere.11 These nanomaterials show promising prospect in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.12 In these research studies, the biomass source was directly calcined or activated with ZnCl2, KOH, K2CO3, etc., which often ends up with a low yield. Generally, the C–H bond energy is much higher than that of the C–C bond, and the C–H bonds are more difficult to activated. During calcination, the C–C bonds in the main chains of biomass would break faster. Therefore, the biomass was easily turned into small gaseous molecules and volatilized. Usually, the gaseous portion causes up to 90% of weight loss, which is not conducive to the sufficient utilization of the biomass source. Moreover, those biomass sources were basically used to generate mesoporous carbon materials with lots of treatment and no other final structures of carbon materials were formed or discussed to be used as electrode materials.
Recently, the utilization of thermal decomposition products of carbon-containing compounds to interact with heteroatom sources is becoming a new method to prepare doped carbon nanomaterials. In particular, some transition metals (like Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) contained in the biomass can catalyze some carbon intermediates and heteroatom sources into heteroatom-doped nanotubes. Jia J. et al.13 initially synthesized bamboo-like carbon nanotubes/Fe3C through heat treatment with a polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene copolymer (PEG–PPG–PEG, Pluronic P123) as the carbon source, melamine as the nitrogen source and Fe(NO3)3 as the catalyst. This synthesized material exhibited good catalytic activity for the ORR. Yan Y. et al.14 selected glucose as the carbon source, dicyandiamide as the nitrogen source and Ni nanoparticles as the catalyst to form 3D well-interconnected nitrogen-rich carbon nanotube–graphene hybrid architectures for lithium–sulfur batteries. Although the formation mechanism of such nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials is not very clear yet, these findings indicate that it is likely to form nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials with a suitable carbon source, nitrogen source and catalyst through heat treatment. Under pyrolysis conditions, the generated gaseous organic small molecules together with heteroatom compounds are easily activated by the catalyst to generate nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials. Considering that many waste biomass sources are natural carbon precursors, they would partially pyrolyze to be gas molecules with a portion of solid mesoporous carbon nanomaterials remaining during annealing. Moreover, as some biomass contains transition metal elements,15,16 it is highly possible that the biomass could autocatalyze this gas portion with heteroatom sources to generate functional carbon nanotubes, while the solid part forms mesoporous carbon by heat treatment, resulting in a three-dimensional composite material with ordered nanotubes and a mesoporous structure.
Herein, for the first time we report a novel approach to synthesize a nitrogen-doped carbon composite material with biomass waste, corncob. The selected corncob acts as a major carbon source, and the elemental iron17 contained in the corncob functions as an effective catalyst. The corncobs were pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid and mixed with a nitrogen source, melamine. After calcining the mixture at 800 °C for 2 hours under an N2 atmosphere, the composite material constituted by mesoporous carbon and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes with diameter around 50 nm was obtained. The composite shows a hierarchical nanotubes/mesoporous structure, and plenty of ordered nanotubes in situ grew on the surface of mesoporous carbon vertically. This composite with a unique morphology and structure not only avoids the agglomeration of nanotubes themselves but also makes full use of the surface areas of both mesoporous carbon and nanotubes. Thus this carbon composite material exhibits extraordinary performance for supercapacitor and lithium–sulfur battery application.
Experimental
Synthesis of hierarchical mesoporous carbon materials
A large amount of corncobs obtained from food bins were thoroughly washed and crushed into fine powders with a diameter of about 1 μm, and pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid at 60 °C for 2 hours until the yellow powders turned black. After the pretreatment, the corncob powders were thoroughly washed with ultrapure water and uniformly mixed with melamine, and then the mixed powders were heated to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and maintained for 2 hours in a tube furnace under an N2 atmosphere. Finally, the product was obtained. For comparison, the pretreated corncob powders were calcined without melamine using identical steps to prepare corncob mesoporous carbon (CMC).
Material characterization
The prepared carbon materials were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) loaded with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to observe their morphologies and compositions. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was also used to investigate the element distribution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips PC-APD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operating at 40 kV, 60 mA. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on an ESCALAB250 XPS spectrometer with a Mg Kα X-ray source (1350 eV). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was carried out using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR-5300). The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) specific surface area was calculated based on the nitrogen physical adsorption (Beckman Coulter SA-3100, USA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a simultaneous DSC-TGA analyzer (NETZSCH-409PC) from 20 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in air.
Electrochemical measurements in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte
Symmetric, full cell supercapacitors using identical electrodes with a glass fibre separator and Na2SO4 solution were fabricated in Swagelok cells. The free-standing films were prepared by mixing the active material (90 wt%) and poly(tetrauoroethylene) (10 wt%) in dimethyl formamide and then pressed into films. After that, the films were dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The as-prepared films were directly used as electrodes assembled in the full cell supercapacitors. The mass of the active material on each electrode was ∼1 mg cm−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out with a CHI660e electrochemical workstation. The EIS curves were recorded by applying a sine wave with 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz.
Electrochemical measurements in 1 M LiPF6 organic electrolyte
Electrochemical testing of the supercapacitors in an organic electrolyte was conducted with a coin-cell (CR2025) configuration. For the coin-cell assembly, the free-standing films were also prepared with an active material mass of ∼1 mg cm−1. After that the supercapacitors were assembled with two symmetric film electrodes, separated by a microporous membrane (Celgard2400) and filled with 1 M LiFP6 mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carborate (DMC) and ethylene methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1 by weight). CV, GCD and EIS measurements were carried out with a CHI660e electrochemical workstation. The EIS curves were recorded by applying a sine wave with 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz.
The gravimetric specific capacitance of a single electrode (Cs, F g−1), the power density (Pcell, W kg−1) and energy density (Ecell, W h kg−1) of symmetric supercapacitors were calculated using the following equations:18 (1) (2) (3)where I is the current (A), m is the active mass (g), Δt (s) is the discharge duration, and ΔV (V) represents the voltage change during the discharge process.
Electrochemical measurements of lithium sulfur batteries
Electrochemical experiments were performed using 2025 type coin cells. The working electrode was prepared by adding 60 wt% sulfur cathode materials into the active material film to form CMC/S and CNNTs@CMC/S electrodes. The electrolyte was 0.5 M lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (LiTFSI) dissolved in a mixed solvent of 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DOL/DME, 1:1, v/v). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were performed at room temperature in a potential range of 1.7–2.8 V (vs. Li+/Li) at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, and 5C (1C = 1672 mA g−1) with a battery tester (LAND CT-2001A, China). CV was performed with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660C) between 1.7 and 2.8 V at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance (EIS) analyses were conducted using the same equipment from 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz.
Results and discussion
Preparation, morphology and structure
Fig. S1† shows the schematic diagram of using a simple and scalable approach to prepare the nitrogen-doped CNTs@corncob mesoporous carbon (CNNTs@CMC) composite material based on waste biomass corncobs. The corncobs were firstly cleaned and ball milled for 6 hours to obtain fine powders, and then the powders were pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid. The corncobs were activated with sulfuric acid, which could be reused. After being washed thoroughly, the obtained powders were mixed with a certain amount of melamine, and finally the powder mixture was calcined in a tube furnace to obtain the CNNTs@CMC composite material as shown in the SEM image in Fig. S1d.†
A series of comparative tests were conducted to study the critical factors that affect the structure and morphology of carbon materials, Firstly, the raw corncob powders without pretreatment were directly annealed, and the SEM image of the resultant is shown in Fig. 1a, which demonstrates a tight block structure of carbon. Then, the pretreated corncobs were also directly calcined under the same operation conditions, and the SEM image of the product is presented in Fig. 1b; it can be seen that the material possesses a loose mesoporous carbon structure. Comparing Fig. 1a and b, the corncobs pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid were activated, which is beneficial to generate the pore structure. After that, melamine was added to further modify the nanostructure. Fig. 1c shows the SEM image of the calcined product with the mixed powders of raw corncobs and melamine, and there are only chunks of carbon and neither mesoporous carbon nor nanotubes formed, although the carbon source, nitrogen source and Fe element all exist at this time. The SEM image of the carbon composite material prepared with pretreated corncobs and melamine is shown in Fig. 1d, illustrating that uniform nanotubes formed on the surface of mesoporous carbon, which is a unique carbon composite nanomaterial. It is also worth mentioning that when the pure melamine without a carbon source was calcined under the same conditions, no product was obtained, as all the raw materials were volatilized.

What is more interesting is that the morphology and structure of nanotubes in composite material could be adjusted by the ratio of pretreated corncob to melamine. Fig. 2 illustrates the SEM images of the carbon composite materials obtained from different ratios of pretreated corncob to melamine. It demonstrates that a lower melamine content led to less and shorter nanotubes, and a higher melamine content brought up to longer uniform nanotubes. When the ratios of pretreated corncob to melamine were 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:5, the lengths of nanotubes were approximately 100 nm (Fig. 2a), 200 nm (Fig. 2b), 5 μm (Fig. 2c) and 20 μm (Fig. 2d), respectively. Thus the length of nanotubes was controllable. However, the diameter of all the carbon nanotubes is ∼50 nm.

The morphology of the CNNTs@CMC composite material was further investigated by SEM and HRTEM. Fig. 3a is the calcined product of the CNNTs@CMC composite material. Fig. 3b is the corresponding SEM image of the CNNTs@CMC composite material, which indicates a composite material with large mesoporous carbon and many nanotubes on the surface. The enlarged SEM image in Fig. 3d shows the mesoporous carbon with plenty of nanotubes orderly and vertically standing on them, clearly demonstrating the unique hierarchical structure composed of mesopores and nanotubes. Fig. 3c is the TEM image of the CNNTs@CMC composite material, and it demonstrates that the carbon nanotubes growing on the mesoporous carbon are multiple walled with lots of folds and the top of each connects with a spherical catalyst nanoparticle. This unique hierarchical structure of carbon materials is reported for the first time and possesses several merits: (a) the mesoporous carbon established a stable 3D frame structure, preventing itself from collapsing and reuniting. (b) The nanotubes uniformly and orderly in situ growing on the mesoporous carbon framework could suppress agglomeration. (c) This hierarchical structure made full use of the surface areas and pore channels of both mesoporous carbon and nanotubes so that the electrons and ions could transfer faster. Due to the above merits, the composite material with this unique structure can also be utilized in many research fields, including catalysts, fuel-cells, lithium ion batteries, lithium sulfur batteries and so on.

Fig. 4 shows the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of CMC and CNNTs@CMC composite, which displays type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops of type H2 and H3 respectively,19 indicating a mesoporous structure in CMC and narrow mesopores in the CNNTs@CMC composite. The pore size distribution curves show that 4–5 nm pores appear in both of CMC and the CNNTs@CMC composite material. Besides, larger pores with width of appropriate 40 nm also exist in the composite, which is consistent with the inner diameter of those nanotubes. The BET specific surface area of the CNNTs@CMC composite material is 1100 m2 g−1, while the surface area of CMC is 1055 m2 g−1. It is noted that the BET specific surface area of the CNNTs@CMC composite is much larger than that of the common CNTs (appropriately 50 m2 g−1), because this composite material possesses more pores and channels and can effectively avoid the reunion of nanotubes on the surface.20

The XPS analysis in Fig. 5 shows the elements and surface chemistry of the CNNTs@CMC composite material. Five predominant peaks at 168.6 eV, 284.6 eV, 401.0 eV, 531.2 eV and 712.6 eV corresponding to S 2p, C 1s, N 1s, O 1s and Fe 2p 3/2 respectively were clearly observed in Fig. 5a, showing the presence of C, N, O, S and Fe in the sample. The high resolution C 1s peak was resolved into two distinguishable components (Fig. 5b). The main peak at 284.6 eV is assigned to the sp2 carbon, suggesting that most of the carbon atoms mainly exist in the form of graphite carbon.21 The peak at 286.7 eV is assigned to the sp2 carbon bonded with heteroatoms such as C–N/O, further indicating the presence of heteroatoms in the material.22 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s shown in Fig. 5c was resolved to two peaks at 398.6 eV and 401.0 eV, which are assigned to the pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, respectively.23 The percentage of graphitic-N took the dominant position, which would greatly contribute to the electrochemical properties and catalytic activity.24,25 The S 2p spectrum in Fig. 5d displayed two main peaks centering at 167.6 eV and 169.8 eV, which are related to SC and C–SOx–C bonds.

XRD was also employed to analyze the samples from 2θ = 10–70° and is shown in Fig. S2a.† Both of the CMC and CNNTs@CMC composite material show the major peaks of Fe2O3 at 2θ = 26.11°, 30.27°, 35.60°, 43.47°, 48.65°, 53.89°, 57.17°, and 62.73 (PDF: 39-1364). Then, the Raman spectra of CMC and CNNTs@CMC composite material are provided. Obviously, all the Raman spectra exhibit two typical peaks, the D band and G band. The D band at ∼1330 cm−1 originates from the structural defects, and the G band at ∼1580 cm−1 is featured with the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms.22 Generally, the relative intensity ratio of the D band (ID) to G band (IG) reflects the degree of graphitization and the size of any graphitic clusters existing in disordered carbon. In Fig. S2b,† the ID/IG value of CMC is 1.17, while the value of CNNTs@CMC decreases to 1.09, indicating that the CNNTs@CMC composite material has less structural defects.26 The result demonstrated that nitrogen was doped into the lattice of carbon nanotubes and replaced the sp2 carbon atoms. Besides, the TGA curve of the CNNTs@CMC composite was recorded ranging from room temperature to 800 °C under an air atmosphere, as shown in Fig. S2c.† Clearly, a weight loss of approximately 93 wt% at around 450 °C was observed, which corresponds to the carbon combustion reaction with oxygen in the air. The final remain is suggested to be the iron oxide.
Then STEM was used to analyze the element distribution of nanotubes in the CNNTs@CMC composite material. Fig. 6 is the TEM image and the corresponding C, N, O and Fe elemental mappings of nanotubes in the CNNTs@CMC composite material. It illustrates that nitrogen and carbon distributed uniformly on the nanotubes and the nitrogen intensity is strong, indicating that the nanotubes are rich in nitrogen. The ball-like shape on the top composed of iron and oxygen elements is considered as the catalyst that guides the growth of the N-doped CNT element which is not detectable in the nanotubes, suggesting that it remained in the mesoporous carbon and was not doped into the carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, HRTEM was used to characterize the ball-like material on the top (Fig. S3b and c†). The ball-like material shows the characteristic spacings of 0.252 nm and 0.270 nm for the (311) and (104) lattice planes of Fe2O3.27 The composition of the catalyst is consistent with the XRD result.

The previous synthesis process of the CNNTs@CMC composite demonstrated that the pretreatment of corncob by concentrated sulfuric acid is necessary for the successful preparation of the composite, indicating the importance of the pretreatment process. To investigate how the functional groups of corncob changed during the pretreatment process, FTIR was used to investigate the groups of raw corncob and pretreated corncob. As we know, the carbon-containing compounds in corncob mainly consist of cellulose, starch and lignin. Fig. 7a shows that it mainly contains –OH (∼3400 cm−1), C–O (∼1050 cm−1) and CO (∼1715 cm−1) groups.28 After pretreated by concentrated sulfuric acid, the –OH group disappeared because of dehydration and turned into CH– (∼3050 cm−1), CH– (∼600 cm−1) and R–O–R (∼1150 cm−1). More importantly, the sulfonic acid group (–SO3H, ∼1190, 1100, 1068, 1037 and 530 cm−1)29 was successfully connected to the corncobs, indicating that the corncob was sulfonated during the pretreatment process. Finally, the product CNNTs@CMC possesses only a few CN (∼1500 cm−1) and other oxygen-containing functional groups are almost eliminated after the heat treatment.
 Fig. 7  (a) FTIR transmittance spectra of raw corncob, pretreated corncob and CNNTs@CMC; (b) XPS survey of raw corncob, pretreated corncob and CNNTs@CMC. 

Fig. 7b is the XPS survey scan of raw corncob and pretreated corncob, and it demonstrates that both of them consist of C, N, O, S and Fe elements. The main elements in corncob are C and O with a proportion of 64.8% and 27.6%, respectively, and it also contains some N (3.7%), S (3.5%) and a little Fe (0.4%). After the pretreatment with concentrated sulfuric acid, the contents of O and S elements increased to 44.1% and 8.4% owing to the sulfonation, and the content of the N element decreased to 0.6%, as the nitrogen-containing compound in corncob like plant protein was decomposed in sulfuric acid and then washed off. However, the Fe (0.3%) element remained due to the strong adsorption by sulfonic acid group (–SO3H). The final product CNNTs@CMC composite contains C, N, O, S and Fe elements with the contents of 76.9%, 8.2%, 7.8%, 6.4% and 0.7%, respectively, indicating rich heteroatom doping. Fig. S4† is the C, N, O and S scans of raw corncob and pretreated corncob, showing that all of peaks slightly shifted after the pretreatment process, suggesting that the forms of the elements in the corncob changed during the pretreatment. In the C scan spectrum, raw corncob has a dominant peak at 283.3 eV and a small peak at 284.8 eV, indicating the presence of –(CH2–CH2)n– and C–O bonds. The main peak of pretreated corncob at 284.4 eV is assigned to the CHO bond, suggesting that the C–O bond in corncob was oxidized by concentrated sulfuric acid. In the N scan spectrum of raw corncob, the main peak at 398.6 eV demonstrates the existence of pyridinic-N, while the peak of pretreated corncob almost disappeared because the nitrogen-containing compounds were decomposed by sulfuric acid and washed off. In the O scan spectra, the peaks of raw corncob and pretreated corncob at 531.1 eV and 532.6 respectively correspond to the O–H and OS bonds, indicating the sulfonation of corncob by sulfuric acid. In the S scan spectrum of raw corncob, the peak at 167.7 eV corresponds to the S–C bond. After pretreatment, the peak shifted to 169.6 eV corresponding to the R–SO3–R bond, indicating that the sulfonic acid groups were connected to the corncob. Fig. S5† illustrates the possible mechanism of functional groups changing before heat treatment. Raw corncob mainly contains hydroxyl and epoxy groups. The pretreatment with concentrated sulfuric acid can make it be dehydrated and sulfonated. Meanwhile, the iron species connected strongly with sulfonic acid group (–SO3H) and other groups by coordinative bonds. After being mixed with melamine, carbon and nitrogen sources adsorbed well around catalysts, making it easy to generate the composite carbon material.
Through the discussion above, it is deduced that the pretreatment of corncob and the nitrogen source (melamine) is necessary for the preparation of the CNNTs@CMC composite. The pretreatment process, on one hand, promoted corncob to generate loose mesoporous carbon during heat treatment, providing beneficial conditions for the growth of carbon nanotubes; on the other hand, due to the change in composition and structure of corncob during pretreatment, it is easy for the pretreated corncob to release the suitable gaseous carbon-containing compounds during the pyrolysis process to generate N-doped carbon nanotubes. Fig. 8 shows the proposed growth mechanism of the CNNTs@CMC composite. The pretreatment of corncob by concentrated sulfuric acid changed the composition and structure of carbon source as well as the form of the Fe catalyst. During calcination, the solid portion of corncob became the mesoporous carbon, providing a suitable position for the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube growth.30 The other portion of the pretreated corncob was decomposed into some gaseous compounds, and these intermediates together with melamine were adsorbed and activated by the Fe2O3 nanoparticles and then layer by layer assemble near the spherical catalysts to form nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes on the mesoporous carbon. Through this process, the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes with a diameter of about 50 nm orderly grew on the surface of mesoporous carbon, and the CNNTs@CMC composite material was successfully prepared.

Electrochemical performance
CV and GCD testing of the symmetric two-electrode supercapacitors were conducted to evaluate the capacitive performance of the obtained electrode materials (CMC and CNNTs@CMC). Fig. 9a and b show the CV curves of CMC and CNNTs@CMC at 20, 50100, and 200 mV s−1 using 1 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. All the curves showed a nearly rectangular shape with a rapid current response at the reverse potential sweeping and no obvious deformation was observed, indicating that all the materials have a good electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) feature and good rate performance due to their high specific surface area and excellent conductivity. The CV curve of CMC showed a more standard rectangle for basically only double-layer capacitance in CMC, while the CV curve of CNNTs@CMC shows a slightly distorted shape, indicating the presence of pseudo-capacitance. Additionally, the CV curve of CNNTs@CMC shows a larger current density than CMC as shown in Fig. 9c, demonstrating a superior specific capacitance. Fig. 9d and e show the charge/discharge curves of CMC and CNNTs@CMC, respectively. All the curves show a similar charge–discharge outline like an isosceles triangle, but with different charge–discharge durations. The charge/discharge curve of CNNTs@CMC illustrated a longer charge–discharge duration than CMC at a current density of 1 A g−1 as shown in Fig. 9f, which indicated that the CNNTs@CMC delivered a much larger specific capacitance of 538 F g−1 than CMC (341 F g−1). The superior capacitance of the CNNTs@CMC composite is ascribed to its 3D hierarchical structure and rich nitrogen-doping. The unique structure provides a fast electron transfer network and ion diffusion and transport channels. Meanwhile, the nitrogen-doped carbon material possesses enhanced conductivity as well as great hydrophilicity and dispersibility.23 Furthermore, the doped nitrogen atoms in the carbon nanotubes optimized the electron distribution and changed their surficial and interfacial chemistry properties and hence improved the adsorption and electrochemical activities. As the weight fraction of Fe2O3 in the composite is very low (1.0 wt% of Fe from the ICP-AES result, and 0.7 at% of Fe from the XPS result), generally the specific capacitance of Fe2O3 is also low, ranging from 60–200 F g−1.27,31 We therefore consider that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles bring little capacitance to the composite material.

The specific capacitance as a function of current density of CMC and CNNTs@CMC is shown in Fig. 10a. The specific capacitance (Cs) values of CNNTs@CMC were 538, 496, 472 and 450 F g−1, while those of CMC were 341, 332, 315 and 298 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively, reflecting that both of the materials possess high specific capacitance in a wide range of current densities. Fig. 10b shows the Nyquist plots of CMC and CNNTs@CMC supercapacitors, showing a small semicircle in the high frequency region and a nearly vertical line in the low frequency region. The diameter of the semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (RCT), which was estimated to be ∼0.5 Ω and ∼1.1 Ω for CMC and CNNTs@CMC supercapacitors, respectively, indicating faster electron transfer capability of the CNNTs@CMC supercapacitor than that of the CMC supercapacitor.32Fig. 10c shows the cycling stabilities of the CMC and CNNTs@CMC supercapacitors over 10000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The specific capacitances of CMC and CNNTs@CMC remained 90.6% and 94.1% of the initial capacitances, showing excellent long-term cycling stability. It demonstrates that the CMC and CNNTs@CMC composite materials possess stable microstructures, revealing that the carbon nanotubes in situ grew on the mesoporous carbon and could suppress agglomeration.

Further, the electrochemical performance of the symmetric two-electrode CNNTs@CMC supercapacitors in LiPF6 organic electrolyte was also studied. Fig. 11a shows the CV curves of the CNNTs@CMC supercapacitor at various scan rates of 2, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 mV s−1, and all CV curves still remained a good rectangular shape and no obvious deformation was observed, indicating good rate performance. Fig. 11b illustrates that the current density of CNNTs@CMC in the organic electrolyte is lower than that of that in the aqueous electrolyte (Na2SO4); however the working voltage range of 3.0 V in the organic electrolyte is much larger than that in the aqueous electrolyte, which could significantly increase the energy density of the CNNTs@CMC supercapacitor. Fig. 11c shows the charge/discharge curves of CNNTs@CMC in the organic electrolyte at current densities of 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. All the curves show a similar charge–discharge outline like an isosceles triangle, indicating the excellent rate performance. Fig. 11d illustrates the charge/discharge curves of CNNTs@CMC at 1 A g−1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes. The specific capacitance of CNNTs@CMC in the organic electrolyte is 320 F g−1. Therefore, the unique structure of CNNTs@CMC ensures high capacitance in both aqueous and organic electrolytes. The Nyquist plot of the CNNT@CMC supercapacitor as shown in Fig. S6a† demonstrated a small semicircle in the high frequency region and a steep line in the low frequency region. The diameter of the semicircle corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (RCT), which was estimated to be ∼18 Ω, indicating fast electron transfer capability of the supercapacitor. Fig. S6b† shows the cycling stability of CNNTs@CMC supercapacitors over 10000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The CNNTs@CMC remained 90.1% of the initial capacitance, indicating excellent long-term cycling stability in the organic electrolyte. Fig. S6c† shows the Ragone plot of the CNNT@CMC supercapacitor using the data from Fig. 11c, and the values of Ecell and Pcell are 102.5 W h kg−1 and 750 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1, and Ecell remains at 81.3 W h kg−1 whereas Pcell remains at 11546 W kg−1 at 10 A g−1. For the consideration of practical application of the CNNTs@CMC supercapacitor, the CNNTs@CMC was prepared to be a flexible film shown in Fig. S7a† and the supercapacitor was used to light up a LED lamp for a long time as shown in Fig. S7b.†

The lithium–sulfur battery performance of the CMC and CNNTs@CMC composite with sulfur as the cathode was also studied. Fig. 12a shows the CV curves of the CNNTs@CMC/S composite for the first, second and fifth cycles. At the first cycle, two pairs of redox peaks were observed, which were ascribed to redox reactions of sulfur species.33 The CV curves at the 2nd and 5th cycles showed a similar shape, indicating that the CNNTs@CMC/S composite electrode possessed good capacity retention and the CNNTs@CMC effectively prevented sulfur from dissolving into the electrolyte. The charge/discharge curves with two voltage plateaus shown in Fig. 12b agreed well with the CV result. The CNNTs@CMC/S composite electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1047 mA h g−1, maintaining the capacity of 682 mA h g−1 after 300 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5C (1C = 1675 mA g−1), indicating a stable cycling performance.
 Fig. 12  (a) Cycle voltammograms of CNNTs@CMC/S at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1; (b) the charge–discharge curves of CNNTs@CMC/S at different cycles at 0.5C; (c) the rate capability of CMC/S and CNNTs@CMC/S; (d) Nyquist plots of the CNNTs@CMC/S and CMC/S. 

Fig. 12c shows the rate performance of the CNNTs@CMC/S electrode, and it delivered specific capacities of 1080, 980, 870, 780, 709 and 620 mA h g−1 when cycled at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C rates. When the discharge current was reversed to 1C, the discharge capacity returned to 780 mA h g−1. The CNNTs@CMC/S cathode displayed a much better rate performance than the CMC/S composite with a much lower discharge capacity at the same rate. The good rate performance of the CNNTs@CMC/S cathode is likely to profit from its unique structure, and the porous ordered carbon nanotube with a large specific surface area, which facilitated fast electronic/ionic transport and enhanced the reaction kinetics of sulfur.
The Nyquist plots of CNNTs@CMC/S and CMC/S composites as shown in Fig. 12d were provided to further confirm the better performance of the CNNTs@CMC/S cathode. The diameter of the depressed semicircle in the high-frequency region of the plot is related to the resistance (RCT) of charge transfer at the interface in the Li–S batteries and the inclined line in the low frequency region corresponds to the soluble lithium polysulfide diffusion within the cathode.34,35 The CNNTs@CMC/S composite exhibits lower RCT than CMC/S, indicating the better electronic performance.36
Fig. S8† demonstrated the cycling performance of CNNTs@CMC/S and CMC/S in Li–S batteries as cathode materials with about 1.2 mg cm−2 sulfur loading. The CNNTs@CMC/S material delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1047 mA h g−1, and exhibited a relatively stable cycling performance, which maintained the capacity of 682 mA h g−1 for 300 charge–discharge cycles at 0.5C. For comparison, the CMC/S nanocomposite delivered a lower discharge capacity of 859 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, and suffered from rapid capacity decay in the first 50 cycles. In addition, the CNNTs@CMC/S electrode shows the relatively more steady coulombic efficiency, benefited by its well-organized structure.
The superior electrochemical performances could be ascribed to the well-organized structure: (1) the ordered nano-carbon cluster and porous structure not only promote the uniform dispersion of sulfur and avail the contact with electrolyte; (2) the polysulfide can be physically confined in the pores and chemically adsorbed by the N-doping carbon material;37 (3) the ordered structure can commendably retard the expansion of the volume during the charge–discharge processes.
Conclusions
In summary, by using waste biomass corncob as the basic carbon source and melamine as the nitrogen source, we successfully prepared a hierarchical carbon composite material constituted by mesoporous and carbon nanotubes for the first time. The corncobs were pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid, and then mixed with melamine. After that, the mixture was calcined in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 hours. During the heat treatment process, the mixture converted into solid and gaseous parts. The solid portion generated mesoporous carbon, and the gaseous portion catalyzed by Fe2O3 nanoparticles formed nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes on the mesoporous carbon. The composite material illustrated a unique 3D structure with plenty of carbon nanotubes orderly and vertically growing on the mesoporous carbon and exhibited an optimized specific capacitance of 538 F g−1 in aqueous electrolytes and 320 F g−1 with an energy density of 102.5 W h kg−1 at a density of 1 A g−1 in organic electrolytes. The specific capacitance of the composite material remained up to 90% of the initial capacitance. For lithium sulfur battery application, the CNNTs@CMC/S material delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1047 mA h g−1, and exhibited a relatively stable cycling performance, which maintained the capacity of 682 mA h g−1 for 300 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 0.5C. We believe that this approach is novel and it might offer some new ideas for efficiently utilizing waste biomass sources, synthesizing hierarchical functional microporous carbon materials, controllably preparing rich nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and developing high-performance energy conversion and storage devices.
