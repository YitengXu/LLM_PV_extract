    , Accepted 7th December 2018First published on 7th December 2018AbstractThe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitute the two main processes in electrochemical water splitting to produce high-purity hydrogen and oxygen as alternatives to fossil fuel. Catalysts are crucial to high-efficiency conversion of water to hydrogen and oxygen. Although transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are promising HER and OER catalysts due to the unique electronic structure and high electrical conductivity, single-phase nitrides have inferior activity compared to Pt-group metals because of the unsatisfactory metal–hydrogen (M–H) bonding strength. TMNs-based composites in combination with other metals, carbon materials, and metallic compounds have been demonstrated to possess improved catalytic properties because the modified electronic structure leads to balanced M–H bonding strength, synergistic effects, and improved electrochemical stability. Herein, recent progress pertaining to TMNs is reviewed from the perspective of advanced catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. The challenges and future opportunities confronting TMNs-based catalysts are also discussed.Xiang PengXiang Peng received his BS in Metal Materials Engineering from Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 2011 and PhD in Physics and Materials Science from City University of Hong Kong in 2017.

1. Introduction
Because of the limited fossil fuel resource as well as environmental concern, development of clean and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels is important.1–3 Among the various strategies, hydrogen has attracted significant attention because of its high gravimetric energy density beyond that of known fuels, compatibility with electrochemical processes, and energy conversion without CO2 emission.4 In order to replace existing fossil fuel, effective and economical production of high-purity hydrogen gas is the key. In the industry, hydrogen is generally produced by expensive and energy-demanding steam reformation of hydrocarbons derived from fossil fuels. This process inevitably gives out a large amount of CO2 and therefore, green techniques which can produce hydrogen on a large scale are attractive for practical applications. Electrocatalytic water splitting is an environmentally friendly and carbon-free alternative if the power can be derived from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, or geothermal energy.5–7 Currently, noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru and their alloys are the common electrocatalysts, but their scarcity and high cost have limited industrial production.8–12 Hence, there is tremendous interest in developing alternative non-noble-metal based electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting.
Transition metal compounds have attracted increasing interest in the photo and electrochemistry and energy fields, for example, metal-ion batteries,13–16 supercapacitors,17–20 solar cells,21–24 sensors,25–27 and photo/electro-catalysts28–36 because of the multi-valence states, special electronic structure, and physical properties. Many kinds of non-noble-metal compounds including metal oxides, carbides, sulfides, phosphides, etc. have been proposed as electrocatalysts for HER and OER in water splitting37–43 and transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique metal-like physical and chemical characteristics and electronic structure.44 Introduction of nitrogen atoms to transition metals increases the d-electron density and contraction of the d-band makes the electronic structure of TMNs resembling that of noble metals such as Pd and Pt up to the Fermi level.45 Besides the metallic conductivity, TMNs have high corrosion resistance boding well for electrocatalytic water splitting in acidic and alkaline solutions. K. Sasaki et al. have studied the electrocatalytic activity of molybdenum nitride (MoN) in HER.46 However, the catalytic performance for this single-phase nitride is unsatisfactory because the onset potential is −157 mV (vs. RHE). They have further modified MoN by introducing Ni atoms to form Ni–Mo binary nitride. In the binary nitride system, the Mo–H bonding strength is moderated by neighboring Ni atoms resulting in improved catalytic activity (onset potential of −78 mV vs. RHE) and structural stability in acidic media compared to the single-phase nitride.47 In addition, there are synergistic effects between TMNs and non-metal atoms because of modification of the electron density distribution in the hybrid materials with large dispersity and more exposed active sites consequently giving rise to good electrocatalytic activity and stability. For example, Shao et al. have prepared tungsten nitride coupled with nitrogen-rich porous graphene-like carbon with high catalytic activity which needs only 132 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and good stability.48
In this mini-review, the structure and physical properties of TMNs are described and recent development of TMNs-based electrocatalysts is discussed from the viewpoint of water splitting. Several types of TMNs-based electrocatalysts including single-phase TMNs, binary TMNs, TMNs/carbon composites, TMNs/metal and TMNs/metal compounds composites are described. In addition, the challenge and prospect of TMNs-based electrocatalysts are presented from the perspective of high-performance water splitting.
2. Structure and physical properties of TMNs
2.1 Structure of TMNs
Group IVB-VIB TMNs possess unique physical and chemical properties, which are often considered “interstitial alloys” by integrating nitrogen atoms into the interstitial sites of the parent metals.49–53 As a result, the metal atoms are close-packed or near close-packed thus giving TMNs the attractive electrical conductivity.54,55Fig. 1 shows the common crystal structures of TMNs, including face-centered cubic (fcc), hexagon-closed packed (hcp), and simple hexagonal (hex) structures formed by the small nitrogen atoms occupying interstitial positions. Table 1 shows the typical crystal structures of TMNs with different number of nitrogen atoms and transition metals.

2.2 Physical properties of TMNs
There are three different metal-nitrogen (M–N) bonding configurations in TMNs, namely covalent bond, ionic bond, and metallic bond.68 Covalent bonding produces high hardness, brittleness and better tolerance to stress, whereas ionic bonding between the nitrogen atoms and metals in TMNs results in a contraction of the metals d-band making the electronic structure of transition metal similar to that of noble metals such as Pd and Pt, thus providing excellent electrocatalytic performance.45 Metallic bonding in TMNs provides good electron transfer and high resistance against corrosion. Generally, TMNs have small electrical resistivity, for instance, TiN (27 μΩ cm), VN (65 μΩ cm), NbN (60 μΩ cm), and ZrN (24 μΩ cm).85 In fact, the electrical resistivity of the TMNs is influenced by the non-metal/metal ratio that the electrical resistivity decreases with increasing the non-metal content at room temperature.85 Especially, superconductivity is common among all fcc TMNs of IVB and VB groups.85 Moreover, TMNs have high chemical stability and are not readily corroded in diluted acidic or alkaline solutions. These properties make them more reliable in electrochemical reactions in comparison with the corresponding metals or metal alloys.
3. Preparation of TMNs
The preparation methods of TMNs can be divided into physical methods such as laser ablation, arc discharge, evaporation, and pulsed-laser deposition86–91 as well as chemical methods. Chemical synthesis is more preferred for TMNs and the methods can be divided into five categories: (1) direct nitridation of the transition metals,92 (2) nitridation of transition metal oxides,53,64,66 (3) ammonolysis of metal chlorides,93,94 (4) solvothermal method,95,96 and (5) thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors.97,98
TMNs are generally prepared by a topochemical process using metal oxides as precursors and N2, NH3, urea, and nitrogen-containing organic chemicals as the nitrogen sources. Typically, annealing under N2 to produce TMNs requires high temperature (>1200 °C).99 Using supramolecular complexes as nitrogen source to produce TMNs needs several kinds of nitrogen-containing organic chemicals and moreover, the TMNs were formed via a slow solid-state process.100 Compared to these preparation protocols, producing TMNs by thermal ammonia reduction (gas–solid reaction) at a moderate temperature (normally 300–800 °C) by a simple operation is preferred, as schematically shown in Fig. 2. During the conversion process, the nitrides maintain the morphology of the oxides but produce a large number of mesopores on the surface due to volume shrinkage from oxides to the corresponding nitrides. Conversion of transition metal oxides (TMOs) to TMNs by ammonia annealing has been employed to produce TMNs with different morphologies from zero dimension to three dimensions. For example, Peng et al. have prepared mesoporous TiN nanotube arrays from TiO2 nanotube arrays57,58 and mesoporous VN nanosheets from V2O5 nanosheets64 by ammonia annealing. Gao et al. have prepared VN nanowires by nitriding V2O5 nanowires67 and Ma et al. have synthesized Mo2N nanobelts by nitriding the MoO3 nanobelts precursor.74 Ta-based TMNs have also been prepared by ammonia reduction after anodization.101–103 TMOs such as Nb2O5, NiO, CoO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, and WO3 have been converted into the corresponding TMNs by thermal nitridation.104–113 The ammonia annealing method can be applied to single-phase TMNs as well as binary TMNs. Jia et al. have prepared Ni3FeN nanoparticles through thermal treatment of NiFe-layer double hydroxide nanosheets under ammonia at 500 °C and formed an efficient overall water splitting electrocatalyst.114 Jia et al. have reported an efficient bifunctional electrode consisting of Ni0.2Mo0.8N nanorods on Ni foam prepared by topotactic transformation of NiMoO4 nanorods at 550 °C under flowing NH3.115

Recently, ammonia nitriding has been adopted to prepare nitride-based composites by in situ phase separation from the complex oxide. Hybrid composites can be produced due to the different bonding energy between the metal atoms and non-metal atoms. For instance, Peng et al. have prepared the composite of VN and metallic Co via nitriding of the Co2V2O7 precursor at a controlled temperature.65 Li et al. have produced a series of mixtures composed of NiCo-based oxides and Ni3N by ammonia annealing of NiCo2O4 (ref. 116) and Xiao et al. have reported a scalable method to produce two-dimensional (2D) nitrides such as MoN, W2N, and V2N by nitriding the corresponding 2D hexagonal oxides under ammonia.117 As shown in Fig. 3, 2D hexagonal TMOs-coated NaCl (2D h-TMOs@NaCl) is obtained by annealing the metal-based precursors@NaCl powders under Ar at 280 °C.118 The 2D h-TMOs@NaCl powders are slowly heated in ammonia at 650 °C and during this process, the salt acts as the stabilizer to avoid morphological changes during transformation from TMOs to TMNs.119 The 2D TMNs@NaCl powders are washed in deionized water and filtered to remove the salts. This method has been demonstrated to produce large and high-quality 2D metal nitride flakes.

The thermal chemical methods utilizing ammonia gas have drawbacks such as the high temperature, long annealing time, as well as toxic precursors. However, physical methods such as magnetron sputtering are suitable for thin film growth but difficult to be applied in fabrication of 3D nanostructures. Fortunately, nanostructured TMOs have been converted into their corresponding TMNs via plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) method which is a 3D surface modification technique at room temperature.120–122 In addition, the high efficient PIII technique can convert TMOs into TMNs completely in a short time using a radio frequency (RF) nitrogen plasma.123 For example, Zhang et al. have prepared CoN and NiMo-based nitrides by RF PIII.123,124 Other TMNs such as TiN,125–127 Ni3N,128 TaN,129–131 GaN,132 and AlN133,134 have also been prepared via plasma treatment.
4. Mechanism of electrochemical water splitting

Fig. 4 shows the typical electrochemical water splitting system comprising three components: cathode, anode, and electrolyte. Both the cathode and anode are coated with electrocatalysts to accelerate the water splitting reactions. When an external voltage is applied to the electrodes, water molecules are decomposed into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen on the cathode and anode, respectively. The electrochemical water splitting reaction can be divided into two half-reactions: oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Considering the different electrolytes in which water splitting takes place, the water splitting reactions can be expressed as follows:
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of an electrochemical water splitting system. 
Total reaction:  2H2O → 2H2 + O2(1)
In an acidic electrolyte:  Cathode: 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2(2) Anode: 2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e−(3)
In an alkaline electrolyte:  Cathode: 2H2O + 4e− → 2H2 + 4OH−(4) Anode: 4OH− → 2H2O + O2 + 4e−(5)
HER in acidic media is normally associated with three possible reactions, but in alkaline media, the reaction mechanism is still not well understood.135 In the acidic media, the first step in HER is the Volmer step: H+ + e− → Hads. During this reaction, a proton absorbs and reacts with an electron to produce an adsorbed hydrogen atom (Hads) on the catalyst surface. In the second step, hydrogen is produced by the Tafel step (2Hads → H2) or Heyrovsky step (Hads + H+ + e− → H2) and then desorbs from the catalyst surface. However, adsorption and removal of H atoms on the electrode surface are competitive processes. Binding energies between the catalyst surface and H atoms that are neither too large nor too small for the overall HER reaction because weak bonding leads to poor adsorption of the reactant and strong bonding makes it difficult to remove the product. The HER kinetics combines absorption and release of hydrogen atoms assessed by the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH). Theoretically, ΔGH of Pt is nearly zero and so it is the best hydrogen evolution catalyst in acidic media as verified experimentally. However, Pt is an expensive noble metal with a limited supply thus hindering commercial production and the major challenge is to design and develop non-noble-metal based alternatives with a nearly zero ΔGH.
OER is the other half reaction in electrochemical water splitting. During OER, oxygen molecules are produced by several proton/electron-coupled procedures.15–17 To produce an O2 molecule, a process with four electron transfer is required. However, the OER process occurs via multi-step reactions with single-electron transfer in each step. Thus, the energy barriers accumulate at each individual step rendering the OER kinetics sluggish resulting in a large overpotential. In order to overcome the large energy barrier during OER, electrocatalysts with a low overpotential, high stability, and low cost are desirable. Although noble-metal-based materials (such as RuO2 and IrO2 (ref. 136 and 137)) have high stability in a wide range of pH in OER, the high cost is the major commercial obstacle. In this respect, carbon-based materials and transition metal-based catalysts including Mn, Co, Ni, and Fe, and their composites are promising alternatives.138–142
TMNs are found to be excellent electrocatalysts for water splitting. Introducing of nitrogen to transition metals modifies the electronic structure of the metals by increasing the density of state (DOS) near the Fermi level and the redistributions of DOS in turn produce electrocatalytic properties similar to those of noble metals.44 Consequently, metal nitrides have higher electrocatalytic activities in electrochemical catalytic reactions than the corresponding pure metals.143,144
However, similar to transition-metal-based carbides, phosphides, and sulfides, metal nitrides also tend to be converted into the corresponding metal oxides slightly on the surface during the OER due to electrochemical oxidation.65,145
5. TMNs based catalysts for electrochemical water splitting
Many TMNs such as single-phase nitrides, binary nitrides, and nitrides-based composites have been investigated as catalysts in both HER and OER and they show good activity and stability in a wide pH range.
5.1 Single-phase TMNs
Single-phase TMNs such as MoN, VN, WN, NbN, TiN, Ni3N etc. have been studied in electrochemical water splitting and show promising catalytic ability. The comparison and summary of recently reported TMNs-based catalysts are presented in Table 2. Xie et al. have shown metallic MoN nanosheets with atomic thickness to be an efficient platinum free electrocatalyst in HER146 and Mo atoms on the surface act as active sites to reduce protons to hydrogen. This work provides fundamental understanding and is helpful to optimize the surface structure to achieve high HER activity. Murthy et al. have fabricated several metal-doped Mo3N2 films using magnetron co-sputtering and evaluated the HER activity in a phosphate buffered medium (pH = 5).147 Both the onset potential and stability of the Mo3N2 films are enhanced in a near-neutral medium.

Tungsten-based compounds exhibit a similar behavior as molybdenum-based compounds. Moreover, tungsten nitrides have better corrosion resistance and stability under neutral and higher pH conditions compared to tungsten carbides.148,149 Shi et al. have fabricated WN nanorod arrays (NA) by nitridation of the corresponding WO3 NA precursors.150 The WN NA serving as a robust integrated 3D hydrogen evolution cathode can be operated from pH of 0 to 14 with good catalytic performance and durability. Ren et al. have prepared porous WN nanowires arrays (NWs) by N2 plasma treatment of WOx NWs for a short time (10 min). The WN NWs show enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media. Their strategy suggests a facile way to fabricate active and stable catalysts for HER.151
TMNs have potential application in OER. Xu et al. have reported metallic Ni3N nanosheets as an efficient OER electrocatalyst.152 The first-principles calculation and electrical transport measurements suggest that Ni3N has an improved electron density by dimensional confinement resulting in intrinsically metal-like characteristics (Fig. 5a and b). As a result, the Ni3N nanosheets show a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1 which is better than those of bulk Ni3N (85 mV dec−1) and NiO nanosheets (59 mV dec−1) as indicated in Fig. 5. The excellent OER performance can be attributed to the change in the surface electron density enhancing the electrical conductivity based on the metallic behavior.

Although single-phase TMNs have promising electrical conductivity and activity in electrochemical water splitting, single-phase TMNs have steady M–H bonding strength which is either higher or lower than that of Pt-based catalysts resulting in inferior activity compared to Pt-group metals.162 Moreover, the long term stability of some single-phase nitrides are not satisfactory under extreme electrochemical conditions.163 A simple way to improve the electrochemical activity of single-phase TMNs is to alter the electronic properties by introducing another metal to weaken M–H or strengthen M–H bonding.164
The “volcano plot” elucidates the HER theory of single transition metals.148,165 Navarro-Flores et al. have proposed a synergetic mechanism to account for the enhanced kinetics in hydrogen evolution observed from NiMo, NiW, and NiFe bimetallic carbide alloys.166 The binary metal nitrides show a similar electrocatalytic behavior. Chen et al. have synthesized NiMo nitride nanosheets on a carbon substrate (NiMoNx/C) and demonstrated high HER electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential and small Tafel slope.46 The nanostructured cobalt molybdenum nitride (Co0.6Mo1.4N2) reported by P. G. Khalifah et al. shows high activity and stability in HER under acidic conditions that a small overpotential of 200 mV is accomplished at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for a small catalyst loading of 0.24 mg cm−2, as shown in Fig. 6.144 Wei et al. have prepared bimetallic vanadium–molybdenum nitride (MoVN) thin films for HER and the materials show superior electrocatalytic activity in an alkaline electrolyte in contrast to bare VN and Mo2N in addition to excellent long-term durability. This study reveals the potential of bimetallic TMNs as high-performance HER catalysts.167

Catalysts based on binary TMNs perform well in overall water splitting. Wang et al. have fabricated a three-dimensional porous NiCo2N on nickel foam and both OER and HER are enhanced as exemplified by small overpotentials of 0.29 and 0.18 V at 10 mA cm−2, respectively.168 Yan et al. have designed and prepared porous interconnected iron-nickel nitride nanosheets on a carbon fiber cloth with a low mass loading of 0.25 mg cm−2 and the materials exhibit excellent catalytic activity in OER with an overpotential of 232 mV at 20 mA cm−2 and HER with an overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA cm−2.169 The results suggest a new route to prepare low-cost and efficient bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting. Wang et al. have synthesized Ni3Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors on the nickel foam (Ni3Fe LDHs/NF) by a typical hydrothermal reaction followed by high temperature annealing under NH3 to obtain Ni3FeN on Ni foam (Ni3FeN/NF).157 The nanosheet structure is preserved after the thermal treatment and excellent conductivity is observed. The Ni3FeN/NF delivers good performance in both OER and HER and can be directly used in electrochemical water splitting.
5.3 TMNs/carbon composites
Carbon based materials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanosheets, are excellent conductive supports for electrocatalysts. Firstly, the carbon materials not only prevent the catalysts from aggregating but also increase the dispersion of active sites.170–172 Secondly, coupling TMNs with carbon materials is found to create a synergistic effect between the components which can modulate the electron density as well as the distribution of the electronical potentials of the composite to balance the hydrogen surface adsorption/desorption behavior, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic properties.173 Thirdly, the carbon species around the TMNs serve as a mask to protect against corrosion. Therefore, TMNs combined with carbon materials have demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity in acidic and alkaline media.46,154,173,174 Chen et al. have prepared the NiMoNx/C catalyst by reduction of ammonium molybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O] and nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·4H2O) and it exhibits excellent activity in HER with a small overpotential, large exchange current density, and small Tafel slope (Fig. 7).46 The NiMoNx/C nanosheets show high corrosion resistance in acidic media due to the protection by carbon. Ojha et al. have fabricated FeNx and Mo2N nanocomposites in situ on N-doped CNTs and investigated the synergistic effects of Mo2N and FeNx for HER.175 FeNx and Mo2N anchored on the conductive N-doped CNTs reduce the internal contact resistance thus facilitating charge transfer leading to high electrocatalytic HER activity.

Carbon-supported TMNs composites are appropriate for overall water splitting. Chen et al. have used a self-template route to fabricate a unique hybrid composite by encapsulating cobalt nitride (Co5.47N) nanoparticles in three-dimensional (3D) N-doped porous carbon (Co5.47N NP@N-PC) polyhedral to produce active bifunctional electrocatalyst.176 Co5.47N NP@N-PC as both the cathode and anode in alkaline solutions can drive the overall water splitting reaction with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of only 1.62 V, which is superior to that of the Pt/IrO2 couple. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co5.47N NP@N-PC can be ascribed to the high conductivity of the Co5.47N, electronic modulation of N-doped carbon towards Co5.47N, and the hierarchically porous structure.
5.4 TMNs/metal and TMNs/metal compounds composites
Guided by the “volcano plot”, heterostructures composed of TMNs and metals or metal compounds are desirable to balance the M–H bonding strength to enhance electrochemical catalysis due to the interaction at the interface of TMNs and metals. Morozan et al. have reported the synergetic effects between Mo2N nanoparticles and gold.177 This approach combines Mo having a higher M–H bonding strength with gold having a lower M–H bonding strength, each component being selected to catalyze a targeted step of the HER, thus leading to improved HER activity in acidic medium. Synergetic effects have also been observed from non-noble-metals and TMNs. Peng et al. have prepared metallic Co nanoparticles embedded in the VN composite (Co/VN) as shown in Fig. 8.65 Phase separation occurs during nitriding due to the different bonding energy between the metal atoms and non-metal atoms. The Co/VN composite has good OER activity as demonstrated by a small overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as well as a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec−1. Excellent stability after 2000 cyclic voltammetry cycles at a large current density of 200 mA cm−2 with an overpotential shift of only 34 mV is demonstrated. The non-noble-metal/TMNs composite with good OER performance and low cost indicates promise in high-efficiency OER in alkaline media.

Composites based on TMNs and other transition metal compounds such as transition metal carbides, nitrides, sulfides, and oxides have been investigated as water splitting electrocatalysts due to the modified M–H bonding strength and synergetic effects among the components.116,145,175,178–181 The synergistic effects rendered by TMNs and transition metal carbides have been shown to yield excellent HER activity both experimentally and theoretically. Charge transfer at the interface between TMNs and transition metal carbides facilitates hydrogen evolution and more importantly, the free energy of hydrogen adsorption at the interface between these composite is very close to that of the commercially available Pt/C catalyst, suggesting practical application in electrocatalytic water splitting.179 Recently, our group has fabricated NiCoO2/CoO/Ni3N composite nanosheet arrays (NiCoON NSAs/NF) in situ on the 3D nickel foam, as shown in Fig. 9a.116 There are more active sites due to the oxygen vacancies on NiCoON NSAs after the treatment with NH3 and the face-centered cubic NiCoO2 enhances formation of active Ni–Co layered hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species (NiOOH) in comparison with spinal NixCo3−xO4 during the electrochemical process. Furthermore, the Ni3+-rich surface incorporated with Co facilitates the formation of β-NiOOH. Consequently, in the alkaline solution, the NiCoON nanocomposite has excellent catalytic OER properties (Fig. 9b–e) such as a small overpotential of 247 mV (at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1, which are better than those of NixCo3−xO4 and most Ni- and Co-based catalysts.

6. Conclusion and outlook
Electrochemical water splitting to produce high-purity hydrogen and oxygen with the aid of electrocatalysts is an environmentally friendly and economic strategy to generate energy and mitigate the use of fossil fuel. In this mini-review, recent progress pertaining to the development and application of TMNs as non-noble-metal and low-cost electrocatalysts in water splitting is described. TMNs such as WxN, MoxN, TiN, NixN, FexN, CoxN, as well as their binary and composites possess excellent physicochemical properties such as high electrical conductivity and unique electronic structure giving rise to the outstanding performance in electrochemical water splitting. Owing to the modified electronic structure and moderated M–H bonding strength, binary nitrides and TMNs-based composites deliver enhanced performance compared to single-phase nitrides.
Although considerable development has been achieved from TMNs electrocatalysts in water splitting, there is much room to improve the catalytic properties of TMNs in HER and OER. Moreover, several fundamental issues need to be better understood in order to design efficient non-noble-metal based catalysts.
(i) Mechanism
A thorough understanding of the mechanism of HER and OER in electrochemical water splitting is crucial to the design and fabrication of high-performance catalysts. Nitride composites combined with metals, carbon materials, or other transition metal compounds have higher electrocatalytic activity than single-phase TMNs possibly due to the balanced M–H bonding strength and synergetic effects between components, but the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. For example, the interface between the different components in TMNs-metal carbides should be different from that of TMNs-carbon composites due to the different electronic structure between the metal and carbon. The surface/interface and the reaction sites need to be identified in situ to fathom the catalytic mechanism.
(ii) Surface engineering
Both HER and OER occur on the surface of the catalysts and therefore, the atomic arrangement and defects in the near surface play crucial role in the water splitting reaction and dominate the electrocatalytic activity. Defects are traps for electrons and limit the charge transfer efficiency thereby impeding the water splitting kinetics. Fortunately, TMNs have metallic conductivity that facilitates high-efficiency charge transfer. To study the active sites and their evolution during water splitting is of great significance in order to understand the electrocatalytic mechanism and life time. It is important to understand the chemical states on the catalyst surface in situ and derive the relationship between the surface chemistry and electrochemical performance.
(iii) Long-term stability
Electrocatalytic water splitting is often conducted in either an alkaline or acidic aqueous medium, which can produce surface polarization of TMNs under extreme pH conditions. It is important to protect TMNs-based electrocatalyst from corrosion in the electrolyte in order to maintain the high activity and stability. Heterostructures loaded or embedded with TMNs on various substrates to mitigate the polarization reaction is believed to be an effective strategy to improve the long-term stability.
