    , Accepted 27th October 2022First published on 28th October 2022AbstractIt is generally believed that the inverted structure is more beneficial for constructing highly stable organic solar cells (OSCs), but the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of current inverted OSCs lags significantly behind that of conventional-structure ones. Herein, a novel composite hole transport layer (HTL) is developed by combining a small molecule, [2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) with molybdenum oxide (MoO3) to simultaneously optimize efficiency and stability. Benefiting from the favorable surface morphology, enhanced built-in potential, and suppressed recombination of this composite HTL, an impressive PCE enhancement from 17.46% for the control device based on MoO3 alone to 18.49% for the optimal device with the composite HTL is achieved with the PM6:L8-BO-F:Y6-BO active layer, which represents the best PCE for inverted OSCs to date. In addition to achieving a high PCE, adopting this 2PACz/MoO3 HTL also improves the device stability. The unencapsulated device maintains 96.4% of its initial PCE after being stored in nitrogen for 8000 h, while that of the MoO3-based device degrades to 86.3%. Additionally, after 220 h of continuous illumination under a white light emitting diode light source at 100 mW cm−2, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device maintains 75.5% of its initial PCE value, while that of the MoO3-based device degrades to 65.5%. These results demonstrate the superiority of this composite HTL in simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of the inverted device and providing an efficient strategy for fabricating high-efficiency inverted OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have received extensive attention within the academic and industrial communities because of their tunable optical properties, light-weight, and flexible fabrication.1–4 In the past few years, owing to the fast developments in active layer materials, interface materials and device structures, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has undergone continuous breakthroughs.5–10 The PCE of the state-of-the-art single-junction device has been pushed over 19%, demonstrating the great potential for practical application.11 Therefore, more efforts have started to focus on employing “greener” solvents and/or deposition methods to enable up-scaling and, potentially, industrialization.12,13 Nevertheless, nearly all of the aforementioned high-performance OSCs are based on conventional structures. It is generally believed that an inverted structure is more beneficial for constructing high-stability OSCs. For instance, Jang et al. reported that the stability of an inverted-structure device based on the PM6:Y6 active layer was better than that of the conventional structure. The inverted device showed ∼73% PCE retention after 300 h of illumination, whereas the conventional device retained only 5% of its initial PCE after only 100 h of illumination.14 Although inverted OSCs present great potential for improving stability, these devices still lag behind current conventional devices in terms of PCE. Therefore, inverted OSCs with simultaneous improvement in PCE and stability are imperative to meet the practical application requirements.
The interface layer between the active layer and electrode plays a key role in the device operation, and can greatly enhance the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and filling factor (FF) of the device.15 Interface modification strategies that insert another material between the interface layer and active layer or between the interface layer and electrode to form a composite transport layer are regarded as effective ways to further improve the performance of inverted OSCs, and have already been adopted for electron transport layers (ETLs). Based on the composite electron transport layer, both the efficiency and stability of target OSCs have exhibited noticeable enhancement.16–19 For example, Zhou et al. reported that aqueous polyethylenimine (a-PEI) modification on the ZnO surface simultaneously enhanced the efficiency and stability of nonfullerene organic solar cells.19 The device efficiency was improved from 15.2% for the ZnO ETL to 15.7% for the device based on a-PEI-modified ZnO. After 1000 h of AM 1.5 G illumination, the PCE of the cell without a-PEI modification degraded to 43% of its initial value, while the device with a-PEI modification maintained 75% of its initial PCE. Yip et al. reported stable inverted OSCs using a fullerene self-assembled monolayer to modify the cathode interface.20 The devices showed excellent stability under continuous illumination with a LED light source at 100 mW cm−2, achieving an extrapolated operational T80 lifetime of 34000 hours. The composite transport layer method has also been reported in inverted devices, for instance, PEDOT:PSS/MoO3, CuBr2/MoO3, DPA2F/MoO3, NPB/MoO3, and MoO3/PEIE devices.21–25 However, it can be found that there is still a huge gap between the efficiency of the devices based on these composite hole transport layers (HTLs) and the current optimal efficiency values in the OSC field. Therefore, developing efficient composite HTLs to promote the efficiency of inverted devices takes on great importance.
Herein, we developed a novel 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL by combining 2PACz with MoO3 to construct a highly efficient inverted device. Energy dispersive spectroscopy measurement demonstrates that 2PACz mainly exists on the surface of the blend film and forms a composite HTL with MoO3. We adopted this composite HTL in a ternary system with PM6 as a donor and L8-BO-F and Y6-BO as acceptors. The device based on the composite HTL obtains a remarkable PCE of 18.49%, which is the highest efficiency among inverted OSCs and is much higher than those of the control devices based on 2PACz (6.11%) and MoO3 (17.46%) HTLs. Additionally, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device also exhibits enhanced storage and light operation stability. Our research revealed that compared to the MoO3-based device, the insertion of the 2PACz layer enables favorable film morphology of the active layer, better ohmic contacts between the active layer and anode, enhanced built-in potential, and decreased interface transport resistance, which is conducive to carrier dissociation and extraction. Moreover, in-depth studies show that the 2PACz/MoO3-based device exhibited longer lifetimes and shorter extraction times. Additionally, lower recombination rate coefficients (krec) were obtained, and bimolecular recombination and surface trap-assisted recombination were effectively suppressed, which partially accounts for the performance enhancement. Thus, this strategy provides an efficient way to achieve high-efficiency inverted OSCs.
Results and discussion
2PACz is a small molecule anode interface material that has been successfully applied in conventional OSCs and metal halide perovskite solar cells and shows excellent electron-blocking and hole-selective properties because of its carbazole group.26–32 The chemical structures of 2PACz and the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) materials (PM6, L8-BO-F, and Y6-BO) are shown in Fig. S1,† and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor films are shown in Fig. 1a. 2PACz was used to develop the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL with MoO3. To verify the existence of the 2PACz layer on the surface of the BHJ to form the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL, we carried out energy dispersive spectroscopy measurement to plot the vertical elemental distributions of the device based on ITO/AZO (∼40 nm)/active layer (∼120 nm)/2PACz (∼5 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (60 nm). As presented in Fig. 1b (mapping images can be seen in Fig. S2†), the element phosphorus (P) was selected to track the elemental distribution of 2PACz. As expected, the curve for the element P showed a strong peak at ∼70 nm, indicating the existence of abundant 2PACz molecules. Beyond 70 nm, the P element content begins to fall and remains at a constant value between 75–195 nm, but stops diffusing after 195 nm, where the AZO signal starts to emerge, indicating that the 2PACz molecules diffused slightly into the active layer. Therefore, the vertical distribution of the P element proved that the 2PACz layer mainly exists on the surface of the blend film and forms a composite HTL with MoO3.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out to explore the effect of 2PACz above the active layer on the film morphology.Fig. 2a is the blend film without 2PACz, which exhibited a rough surface with a root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of 2.21 nm. In contrast, the existence of 2PACz on the surface of the active layer greatly smoothed the active layer, with a notably reduced RMS of 0.73 nm (Fig. 2b), implying that the voids in the blend film were partially filled by 2PACz. This obvious change can be seen in the height profiles recorded along the white lines in the corresponding images (Fig. 2d and e, respectively). This smooth film with fewer traps could provide close contact between the active layer and MoO3, decreasing the possibility of recombination and contributing to increasing FF.33 The TEM results also show more continuous and uniform phase separation morphology (Fig. 2f) for the sample with 2PACz modification than the control sample (Fig. 2c). These morphology results indicate that the roughness of the blend film can be dramatically reduced with the assistance of 2PCAz molecules. Thus, compared with the MoO3-only layer, the existence of the 2PACz layer can ensure good interfacial contact between the blend film and MoO3 and improve the film-forming quality of MoO3, which might have a positive influence on carrier transport and extraction, enabling higher device performance.

To compare the performance of the inverted devices, we adopted the structures ITO/AZO/BHJ/HTLs/Ag (more details about device processing are provided in ESI†). The performance of the 2PACz/MoO3 HTL-based devices was compared by tuning the concentrations of 2PACz. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. S3,† and the corresponding parameters are given in Table S1.† The J–V curves of the three optimal devices under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3a and S4a,† and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The champion device performance is obtained when the concentration of 2PACz is 0.5 mg mL−1. The devices with only 2PACz exhibit a poor PCE of 6.11% with a VOC of 0.42 V, a JSC of 25.97 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56.46%. The device with only MoO3 shows a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 26.99 mA cm−2, and a FF of 77.01%, achieving a moderate PCE of 17.46%. Remarkably, the devices based on the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL give a remarkable PCE of 18.49%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 27.41 mA cm−2 and an impressive FF of 79.68%. The performance improvement is mainly correlated to the large increase in FF and slight increase in VOC and JSC (Fig. 3b), implying that the insertion of 2PACz might enable better interfacial contacts, and thus be conducive to hole transport and suppression of carrier recombination. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 3c and S4b.† For all devices, the integrated current density values deduced from the EQE curves are in good agreement with those obtained from the J–V curves. It can be seen that the EQE response of the 2PACz/MoO3 exceeds 80% in the range of 480–810 nm, and is higher than that of the MoO3 device beyond 570 nm. The photovoltaic performance results demonstrate the potential advantages of the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL strategy in boosting PCE.

To understand why the 2PACz/MoO3 devices exhibit a higher VOC, we carried out ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement. Generally, energy level mismatch would cause poor ohmic contact, resulting in a dramatically reduced VOC, JSC, and FF, which can be effectively eliminated by interface regulation.34 From previous research, we found that the work function (WF) of 2PACz is −5.10 eV.30 In addition, UPS measurements were carried out to calculate the WF of the Ag electrode covered with MoO3 and the composite HTL, respectively, to evaluate the ohmic contact properties. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, after being modified by MoO3, the WF of Ag is changed from −4.28 to −5.31 eV. In contrast, after incorporating 2PACz, the WF of 2PACz/MoO3/Ag is changed to −5.40 eV, which is closer to the highest occupied molecular orbital of PM6 and indicates that the introduction of 2PACz plays a key role in regulating the energy level arrangement between the active layer and anode. The lower ΔWF can decrease the energy barrier between PM6 and the anode electrode, enabling better ohmic contact and achieving a higher VOC. To further clarify the enhancement of VOC, capacitance–voltage (C–V) analysis was carried out to calculate the built-in potential (Vbi). The measurement was operated in the dark condition with a frequency of 5 kHz. The Mott–Schottky curves of the three devices are depicted in Fig. 4c and S5a,† and Vbi can be calculated using the equation (1)where C is the value of capacitance, V is the voltage applied in the devices, A is the device area, e is the element charge, ε0 and εr are the vacuum permittivity and relative dielectric constant, and ND is the carrier density.35 From Fig. 4c and S5a,† we can see that the Vbi of the 2PACz- and MoO3-based devices are 0.70 V and 0.72 V, respectively. Remarkably, the Vbi of the 2PACz/MoO3-based devices increases to 0.77 V after incorporating 2PACz, which suggests that optimized ohmic contact could contribute to the enhancement of Vbi between the BHJ and electrode, further leading to an efficient hole extraction process and higher VOC in the device based on the 2PACz/MoO3 HTL.36

To investigate the influence of the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL on the hole injection and transport properties, we carried out dark current measurements based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6/HTLs/Ag device structure. As can be seen from Fig. 4d, when the ITO/PEDOT:PSS is positively biased (i.e., negative bias on Ag/HTL), all devices show similar J–V curves, implying identical hole injection and transport processes. When a positive bias is applied to the Ag/HTLs electrode, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device exhibits slightly higher current density than the MoO3-based device, indicating that hole injection from 2PACz/MoO3 to PM6 becomes more efficient after inserting 2PACz. Fig. 4e and S5b† show the hole mobility (μh) of the hole-only devices, which is calculated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.37 The 2PACz-based device exhibits the smallest μh of 6.39 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, which could relate to its poor hole injection performance. Nevertheless, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device gives a μh of 3.06 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that of the MoO3-based device (2.20 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result proves that the incorporation of 2PACz is beneficial for hole transport and further performance improvement. The electron blocking ability can be depicted by the dark J–V characteristics of the devices based on ITO/AZO/BHJ/HTLs/Ag.38,39 As shown in Fig. 4f, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device shows a lower leakage current density that is about one order of magnitude lower than of the MoO3-based device under reverse bias. The lower leakage current density indicates the excellent electron-blocking ability of the 2PACz/MoO3 HTL, which has a pronounced impact on suppressing the surface recombination of holes and electrons.40 Therefore, the better hole injection and transport, and electron blocking ability collectively contribute to the impressive improvements in JSC and FF in the 2PACz/MoO3 HTL-based inverted OSCs.
It is well established that the FF is governed by the recombination process, which can reflect the dynamic process of charge generation, transport, and collection in OSCs.41 A higher FF originates from a faster exciton dissociation, enhanced charge transport, and suppressed recombination.42 Accordingly, the charge generation and dissociation process of the three devices was studied using the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. S6.†Jph is calculated as Jph = Jlight − Jdark, where Jlight is the current density under light and Jdark is the current density in the dark, while Veff is defined as V0 − Vapply, where V0 is the applied voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2, and Vapply is the applied voltage bias.43 The photocurrent can reach saturation in a large effective voltage region, where most of the excitons can separate and generate carriers under an applied field, and then be collected by electrodes. The exciton generation and dissociation ability of the devices can be determined by the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) and exciton dissociation probability (P(E,T)). Gmax and P(E,T) are defined as Jsat/qL and Jph/Jsat respectively, where q represents the elementary charge, L is the film thickness and Jsat denotes the saturation current.44 The corresponding results of the devices can be seen in Table S2.† The Gmax values of the 2PACz- and MoO3-based devices are 1.57 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.50 × 1028 m−3 s−1, respectively, while that of the 2PACz/MoO3-based device is 1.53 × 1028 m−3 s−1. Generally, exciton dissociation in high-performance devices relies on the built-in potential, and a high built-in potential can be conducive to exciton dissociation.45,46 From the above discussion, it can be seen that even though the 2PACz-based device has the largest Gmax, it has the lowest P(E,T) value (96.77%) due to the its smallest Vbi, while those of the MoO3-and 2PACz/MoO3-based devices are 97.40% and 98.27%, respectively. These results indicate that the incorporation of 2PACz facilitated exciton generation and dissociation, leading to an obvious increase in FF.
Non-geminate recombination dominates the recombination process in OSCs, which can be classified into bimolecular recombination and trap-assisted recombination.47 To investigate the carrier recombination behavior of the three devices, the light intensity (I) dependence of JSC was first determined. According to the power law JSC ∝ Iα, the exponent α represents the degree of bimolecular recombination, which should be close to 1 if the bimolecular recombination behaviors of the devices can be discriminated.48 As shown in Fig. S7a,† the α value of the 2PACz-based device (0.999) is higher than that of the MoO3-based device (0.989), while that of the 2PACz/MoO3-based device is 0.993, indicating that the insertion of the 2PACz layer will slightly suppress the bimolecular recombination. In addition, imbalanced hole and electron mobility can also cause the deviation of α.49 It is therefore likely that the deviation of the value of α can be caused by bimolecular recombination as well as imbalanced charge mobility.50 Additionally, the light intensity dependence of VOC is illustrated in Fig. S7b.† The curve with a slope of kT/q can be used to evaluate the dominant recombination behavior (where k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge and T is the temperature in Kelvin), where a slope of kT/q indicates the dominance of bimolecular recombination.51 In contrast, a slope of 2 kT/q indicates the dominance of trap-assisted recombination.51 As presented in Fig. S7b,† the 2PACz/MoO3-based device exhibited a slope of 1.15 kT/q, which is smaller than those of 2PACz (1.26 kT/q) and the MoO3-based device (1.22 kT/q). These results indicate that the 2PACz/MoO3-based devices have weak bimolecular recombination and suppressed trap-assisted recombination after incorporating 2PACz, accounting for the improvement in the FF. Zonno et al. developed a method to distinguish the existence of trap-assisted BHJ or on the surface via the equation J0 = Jgenexp(−qVOC/kT), where J0 is the saturation current density, VOC is the open-circuit voltage, kT is the thermal energy, q is the elementary charge and Jgen is approximated to JSC.52 It is indicated that in this method, J0 will increase with the active layer thickness if bulk recombination dominates, otherwise, it will decrease or remain constant with increasing thickness owing to surface recombination. The suppressed surface recombination can be observed in Fig. 5a for the 2PACz/MoO3-based device, illustrating that J0 increases as the thickness increases from 50 to 400 nm, revealing the dominance of bulk recombination in the device. In contrast, for the MoO3-based device, J0 first decreases at a relatively low thickness and then increases with increasing thickness. These results indicate that the device with 2PACz above the active layer can suppress surface recombination more effectively than the MoO3-based device, implying the dominance of bulk recombination in the 2PACz/MoO3-based devices. Fig. 5b and c present diagrammatic illustrations of the carrier extraction and recombination processes of those interface structures, showing a suppressed surface recombination process at the BHJ/HTL interface with the composite HTL. We infer that surface and bulk recombination do exist in the BHJ/MoO3 device. The spin-coating of 2PACz, which can accelerate hole extraction but block electrons, results in effectively suppressed surface recombination.

Transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were further carried out to analyze the carrier extraction time and carrier lifetime (τ) in the two devices.53 As shown in Fig. 5d, the single MoO3-based device shows a charge extraction time of 0.20 μs. In comparison, by inserting the 2PACz layer, the charge extraction time was reduced to 0.16 μs, which indicates the superior carrier extraction ability of the 2PACz/MoO3-based device. As shown in Fig. 5e, the carrier lifetime of the 2PACz/MoO3-based device is 41.7 μs, which is approximately twice as long as that of the MoO3-based device (20.8 μs). Research has shown that the charge carrier lifetime is usually in inverse proportion to the trap density, and the longer carrier lifetime indicates that the surface trap density may be reduced in the 2PACz/MoO3-based device.54 The result implies that the surface trap density may be reduced in the 2PACz/MoO3-based device, and further suggests that surface recombination is effectively suppressed, which could account for the improvement of FF.55 In addition to the carrier lifetime, it is necessary to obtain more charge recombination kinetics parameters for better analysis of the recombination process. Fig. S8a† shows the carrier lifetime extracted from the TPV as a function of VOC in a semi-log plot under different LED intensities.56 The lifetimes are found to follow an approximately exponential dependence on the VOC values, showing that the 2PACz/MoO3-based device has a longer lifetime than the MoO3-based device at all light intensities, indicating decreased recombination. The charge density (n) versus VOC was plotted based on the carrier extraction (CE) measurement, and the results are shown in Fig. S8b.†57 The representative n values measured at 100% LED intensity were estimated to be 4.75 × 1016 cm−3 for the 2PACz-based device, 5.83 × 1016 cm−3 for the MoO3-based device, and 6.53 × 1016 cm−3 for the 2PACz/MoO3-based device. In comparison with those of the 2PACz- and MoO3-based devices, higher n values are obtained over the whole VOC range for the 2PACz/MoO3-based device, which is in agreement with the enhancement of JSC.58 The derived carrier lifetime curves under different carrier densities are shown in Fig. S8c.† Subsequently, the recombination rate coefficients (krec) were further extracted from the carrier lifetime and carrier density via krec = 1/(λ + 1)nτ to distinguish the extent of nongeminate recombination, where λ represents the recombination order determined from the data shown in Fig. S8c,† and were calculated to be 1.633 for the 2PACz-based device, 1.944 for the MoO3-based device, and 1.837 for the 2PACz/MoO3-based device, respectively.59 The plot of krecversus n is shown in Fig. S8d,† and it is found that the krec values of the 2PACz/MoO3-based device are substantially lower than the krec values of the 2PACz- and MoO3-based devices at all applied light intensities, which is consistent with the improvement of the FF value, indicating that carrier recombination is suppressed after incorporating the 2PACz layer.
The superior carrier extraction ability can also be proven by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement.60 The IS curves shown in Fig. 5f and S9† were fitted using an equivalent circuit model (Fig. S10†) with a bulk recombination resistance (Rbulk), carrier transport resistance (Rtran), and series resistance (Rseries), and the relevant data are summarized in Table S3.† As can be seen from Fig. 5f, S9, and Table S3,† an apparent change is observed in the 2PACz/MoO3-based device. The MoO3-based device shows a Rtran of 123 Ω, which is larger than that of the 2PACz-based device (32.8 Ω). However, in comparison to the MoO3-based device, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device shows a remarkably decreased Rtran of 24.2 Ω, demonstrating that the incorporation of 2PACz can facilitate the carrier extraction.61
Finally, we compared the stability of the inverted devices with different interfacial structures. For the storage stability test, the devices were stored for about 8000 h in a glovebox filled with nitrogen without encapsulation, and their PCEs were irregularly measured during this time. As depicted in Fig. 6a, the PCE of the MoO3-based device was reduced to 86.3% of its initial value, while the 2PACz/MoO3-based device still maintained 96.4% of its initial PCE. Additionally, the light operation stability of the two devices was measured under a LED light source at 100 mW cm−2. As can be seen in Fig. 6b, after 220 h, the 2PACz/MoO3-based device maintained 75.5% of its initial PCE value, while that of the MoO3-based device decreased to 65.5%. In addition, we further explored the universality of this composite HTL method using other active layer combinations. The molecular structures of PTB7-Th, Y6, IT-4F, and PC71BM are shown in Fig. S11.† The J–V curves of the devices based on PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6-BO, PM6:IT-4F, and PTB7-Th:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 6c, and their corresponding data are listed in Table S4.† With the help of the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL, all these devices achieved higher PCEs than the corresponding MoO3-only-based devices. Representatively, the PM6:Y6-BO device based on 2PACz/MoO3 achieved a higher PCE of 17.47%, while the control device only attained a PCE of 16.70%. Fig. 6d and Table S5† summarize the superiority of our work in terms of PCE compared to other inverted devices, demonstrating that the VOC, JSC, and FF are all enhanced, especially the FF, which was consistent with the above studies. These results prove that the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL is an efficient strategy for simultaneously improving inverted device efficiency and stability.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the 2PACz/MoO3 composite HTL is an effective strategy to simultaneously enhance the efficiency and stability of the inverted device. Using this composite HTL, the devices based on the PM6:L8-BO-F:Y6-BO active layer obtained a brilliant PCE of 18.49%, which is among the highest efficiencies reported to date for inverted single-junction devices. In comparison, the device based on the MoO3-only HTL achieved a moderate PCE of 17.46%. Our results demonstrate that the insertion of the 2PACz layer enables favorable active layer morphology, better ohmic contacts between the active layer and anode, enhanced built-in potential, and decreased interface transport resistance, which are conducive to carrier dissociation and extraction, and the suppression of carrier recombination. In addition, we verified the universality of this composite HTL in several other different active layer systems, demonstrating a versatile strategy to enhance the efficiency of inverted OSCs and offering prospects for the future commercialization of OSCs.
