    , Accepted 17th August 2020First published on 17th August 2020AbstractThe global consumption of critical metals has significantly grown in recent decades. However, their natural sources are depleting; valuable metal recycling and recovery from industrial material flows is needed to guarantee reliable and sustainable access to metal production, which is in line with the concept of green manufacturing and process innovation to develop green chemical processes. Compared with conventional hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical processes, the electrochemical strategy has been extensively investigated and applied to the extraction of metals from industrial wastes, owing to its advantages of high efficiency and selectivity, easy operation, low energy consumption, and environment friendliness. This review provides an overview of the present status and outlook on electrochemical technologies, based on the electrochemical redox mediation mechanism, used to extract valuable metals from industrial wastes, including metallurgical slag, electronic scrap, spent batteries, spent catalysts, fly ash, alloy scrap, and nuclear waste, from the perspective of technical, mechanistic, and environmental impact. Special focus is given to electrochemical redox mediation technologies including electrochemical oxidation and reduction, slurry electrolysis, membrane electrolysis, molten salt electrolysis, electrokinetic separation, and external field-intensified electrochemical extraction. Furthermore, challenges and future strategies for electrochemical extraction of valuable metals from the perspective of a coupled green process and highly efficient regeneration/extraction, to technological improvement and environmental impact evaluation were proposed.
1. Introduction
Driven by rapidly increasing industrial activities, the environmental pollution due to discharged waste and the scarcity of valuable metal-based raw materials have become prime global concerns.1–5 Industrial waste streams are produced from several processes, such as metallurgical, electronic, petrochemical, battery, nuclear, etc.6,7 Due to the potential risk of highly toxic metal ions being released and the economic value of discarded valuable metals, the metal extraction from waste streams is of critical importance and becomes an absolute necessity. Compared with natural ore resources, the valuable metals contained in industrial waste have high grade and pure composition, making it easy to control the extraction and recovery processes.8 In order to achieve environmental and metal sustainability for green manufacture, sustainable processes and techniques need to be developed for the recycling of metals from industrial waste.
The application of the principles of green chemistry and especially the treatment of industrial waste have pushed forward the improvement of greener chemical processes driving the construction of clean chemical industries. These green chemical approaches must not only consider industrial waste reduction, but also the entire treatment process including metal extraction, energy consumption, the toxicity of solvents and reagents, etc., with all of these aspects defining the overall environmental impact. The success of secondary metal recovery depends on the process of retrieving and recycling metals embedded in spent materials or abandoned structures. Conventionally, pyrometallurgical (including smelting, roasting, converting, and refining) and hydrometallurgical (including leaching/dissolving, solution purification, and metal recovery) technologies are employed to recover metals.9,10 However, most conventional methods involve high-temperature processing, a long process flow, emission of pollutants (waste gas, wastewater, and sludge), equipment corrosion, and costly chemical addition. Electrochemical metal recovery is an emerging field that offers a sustainable strategy for extracting valuable metals from industrial wastes. Electrochemical processes have high efficiency, environmental compatibility, broad tunability, and minimal chemical usage, all of which comply with the crucial guidelines of green chemistry.11 Electrochemical redox mediation has important implications for the promotion of metal extraction. For example, treatment of spent LiFePO4 batteries, electronic waste, and Cr-containing and As-containing wastewater could be tuned by electrochemical [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3−, Fe2+/Fe3+, Cr6+/Cr3+, and As3+/As5+ redox targeting processes.12–15 M/Mn+ redox mediation is helpful for metal deposition and production, while O2/H2O2 and H2O2/·OH redox mediation processes contribute to the oxidation capacity in the electrochemical oxidative dissolution steps.16
Electrochemical metal extraction from industrial waste originated from the fundamental investigations of alloy corrosion phenomena and electrochemical dissolution of ores and minerals (e.g. chalcopyrite, molybdenite, and gold ore).17–22 Inspired by those studies, in the last few decades, electrochemical extraction and recycling systems were gradually established in many kinds of industrial wastes and urban mines. Electrochemical metal extraction has gained increasing attention, especially in the last decade, as seen in Fig. 1, where the number of publications and citations related to this topic is plotted from 2007 to 2020, demonstrating the necessity to review its progress and outlook. Furthermore, it fits well with the criterion of green chemistry regarding the circular economy, near “zero-emission”, and other green characteristics. Electrochemical recycling processes involved with short-cut reaction and materials circulation may alter the current metal recycling model and efficiently promote the recycling of different metals from more complicated industrial waste streams.

Herein, the current status and recently developed strategies of electrochemical valuable metal extraction and recycling from industrial wastes were systematically summarized. This review intends to be a powerful tool for researchers in the pursuit of exhaustive information on the electrochemical treatment of industrial wastes by electrochemical oxidation, electrochemical reduction, slurry electrolysis, membrane electrolysis, molten salt electrolysis, electrokinetic separation, and external field-intensified electrochemical extraction processes, as shown in Fig. 2. It encompasses the treatment of several kinds of industrial wastes including metallurgical slag, waste electrical and electronic equipment, spent batteries and catalysts, fly ash, alloy scrap, and nuclear waste, focusing especially on electrochemical redox mediation and high-efficiency metal extraction and recovery, which conforms to the green manufacturing and process innovation. Meanwhile, the challenges and perspectives on the future strategy and development of electrochemical extraction technology are expounded in detail. From the viewpoint of the fundamental study, redox reaction design on both the anode and cathode, and redox pathway and mechanism illustrations are focused on. From the angle of practical application, spent industrial materials that can be recycled need to be detoxified and regenerated for further use, while in-depth extraction of valuable components and harmless disposal should be processed for the non-regenerable industrial wastes. The objective of this review is to present a detailed understanding of the state-of-the-art including the processes and future directions for different electrochemical metal extraction strategies and to provide a general guideline for the electrochemical treatment of industrial wastes.

2. Current electrochemical methods of metal extraction
Electrochemical metal extraction has received increasing attention because it is not only a green and environmental compatibility technique via the employment of the green redox mediator “electron” without large toxic chemical input, but also a mild, operation-feasible, and highly efficient pathway avoiding a complicated and long process and harsh reaction conditions. Specifically, for electrochemical redox mediation, anodic redox pairs (including M/Mn+, H2O/·OH, Cl−/Cl2, Fe2+/Fe3+, etc.) and cathodic redox pairs (including Mn+/M, O2/H2O2, H2O2/·OH, etc.) can be tuned to achieve the goal of metal dissolution, metal deposition, separation, and redox pair regeneration. On the one hand, the recycling and remediation of industrial waste and valuable metal extraction are pollution reduction routes. On the other hand, metal extraction via the electrochemical method is considered a sustainable and clean production strategy for reducing the environmental burden towards resource recovery in comparison to traditional methods. The above sustainable, closed-loop process can prevent waste or at least minimize the amount of the waste, and the regeneration of the redox mediator, while electrochemical oxidation or reduction of valuable metals can ensure sustainability. Therefore, electrochemical metal extraction and industrial waste recycling belong to the category of green chemistry,23 which meets eight requirements, including (1) prevent waste, (2) atom economy, (3) less hazardous synthesis, (4) design benign chemicals, (5) benign solvents & auxiliaries, (6) design for energy efficiency, (7) catalysis, and (8) inherently benign chemistry for accident prevention.
2.1 Electrochemical oxidation
Electrochemical direct oxidation involves the oxidation by direct electron transfer to the anode surface.24 Specifically, electrons are released from a powder of industrial waste, causing an increase in the valence and oxidative dissolution of valuable metals. The waste powder can be melted to ingots, which are suitable for use as anodes and can be treated through the anodic dissolution process.25 Anodic dissolution is a selective and environmentally friendly method for the treatment of industrial waste, in which an external voltage is imposed on the anode to facilitate the anodic dissolution of valuable metals with no oxidants or pretreatments necessary.26
Electrochemical indirect oxidation mainly occurs in the bulk solution by a chemical reaction with the electro-generated active species. Therefore, the indirect oxidation rate depends on the concentration of redox mediators that are generated at the anode or cathode surface.27 The species that participate in the indirect oxidation process include oxygen, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive chlorine species (RCS), etc. All are electrochemically generated from agents existing in the bulk solution, such as water, oxygen, and chloride. The so-called electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), which are based on the electrochemical generation of strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (·OH) have caused increasing interest in recent years.28,29 ROS, as one of the most important redox mediators, are chemically reactive chemical species containing oxygen, comprising ·OH, H2O2, HO2−, O2−, O22−, ·O2−, and 1O2, which are widely investigated in biology,30 resources and environment fields,31–33 and recently recognized in sub-molten salt hydrometallurgical processes.34 Electrochemical ROS generation involves the anodic production of physisorbed ·OH at the anode surface (denoted as M(·OH)) and the so-called electro-Fenton reactions (reactions between cathodically-generated H2O2 and transition metal species, such as Fe2+). H2O2 is produced from M(·OH) dimerization, and cathodic oxygen reduction (in alkaline solutions, oxygen is reduced to HO2−, the conjugate base of H2O2).35–37 RCS are the main indirect oxidation agents employed in wastewater treatment, which is based on the direct oxidation of Cl− at the anode to yield Cl2 and its disproportionation to form HClO.38
The whole electrochemical oxidation process is environmentally friendly as it is carried out in a single reactor, at a relatively low temperature (<100 °C, usually room temperature) and consumes only the green reagent electron without generating waste. Solid waste powder could be used as a sacrificial anode or reactant, where valuable metal/heavy metal ions are selectively released to the electrolyte during the electrochemical oxidation.
2.2 Electrochemical reduction
Electrochemical deposition, or electrodeposition for short, is a well-known and exceptionally versatile electrochemical reduction method to extract metals from a solution containing a salt of the metal to be deposited by the action of an electric current on a conductive material substrate as a cathode. Electrodeposition can be categorized into the following three processes: (i) electroplating, (ii) electrophoretic deposition, which occurs in a particle suspension, and (iii) underpotential deposition, which occurs at a potential less negative than the equilibrium potential.39 Various metal ions can be separated through the mediation of different Mn+/M redox potentials (standard electrode potentials). Electrodeposition, as an attractive and promising metal separation method that has a low environmental impact, operates with high energy efficiency and can be performed with minimal involvement of auxiliary materials. Recent progress demonstrated that metal electrodeposition from novel green solvent electrolytes, such as ionic liquids, occurs without hydrogen evolution, increasing the cathodic current efficiency compared to deposition from water and avoiding porosity within the deposited metal.40
Electrowinning and electrorefining are two typical industrial electrometallurgical processes and are important techniques for the large-scale, economical, and straightforward purification of non-ferrous metals. In electrowinning, the chemical species yielding the metal enters the cell as a dissolved compound, e.g. in a solution pumped into the cell. In contrast, electrorefining is a similar process to remove impurities from a metal anode (anodic dissolution) and form a high-purity metal cathode (electrodeposition). Process intensification strategies during electrodeposition, such as cyclone electrowinning and supergravity field electrodeposition, were further developed for the recovery of valuable metals from industrial wastewater.41,42 Electrodeposition-redox replacement (EDRR) was also proposed for the recovery of noble metals (Pt, Ag, Au, etc.) from low concentration wastewater,43–45 in which a thin layer of a sacrificial metal is deposited during an electrodeposition step and then spontaneously replaced by a nobler metal during a redox replacement step.46 Electro-reductive leaching was used as a valuable metal extraction method for the reductive leaching of solid wastes containing high-valence metals, e.g. Mn2+ leaching from MnO2-containing electrolytic manganese residue and Co2+ leaching from spent LiCoO2 batteries.47,48
2.3 Slurry electrolysis
Slurry electrolysis is a relatively recent electrometallurgy process that replaces the three main stages (leaching, solution purifying, and electrowinning) of traditional hydrometallurgy with a single step performed in an electrochemical reactor, which could directly obtain products from finely ground industrial wastes. The synchronous oxidative leaching of the powdery slurry and reductive deposition of metals occur on the anode and cathode, respectively. It has been successfully used in the extraction and recovery of Mn, Cu, Li, Ag, Au, Zn, Pb, Fe, Sb, and other metals from their minerals or “urban mines”, while simultaneously decreasing the electricity consumption and cell voltage for electrolysis.49–51 Slurry electrolysis is enticing due to its short technological process, low reagent and energy consumption, and environmental friendliness.
2.4 Membrane electrolysis
Membrane electrolysis has arisen from the chlor-alkali industry. Indeed, industrial chlorine and caustic electrolysis units are almost exclusively based on membrane electrolysis.52 In general, a membrane is defined as a barrier separating two fluid streams and facilitating selective mass transport between these two streams. The electrochemical potential gradient or chemical concentration gradient between the streams acts as a driving force. Ion-selective membranes are based on the interactions between ions in solution and fixed ions in the membrane. In the electrometallurgy field, learning from the core concept of water electrolysis and the chlor-alkali industry, as the electrolysis process proceeded, the anodic pH value continually decreased while the cathodic pH value continually increased. Valuable metals can be tuned and simultaneously extracted in the cathodic compartment in the form of pure metal (deposition),53 metal hydroxide (after cathodic hydrogen evolution),54 and metal carbonate (with the help of CO2).55 Membrane electrolysis is usually carried out at room temperature or below 100 °C, making it an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process.
2.5 Molten salt electrolysis
Molten salt possesses high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical windows, which makes it an excellent electrolyte for extracting and refining metals and alloys, storing energy, and synthesizing materials. Molten salt electrolysis is widely used for electrometallurgy, such as electrolytic reduction of metallic compounds to metals (molten salt electrowinning) and purification of metals (molten salt electrorefining). For instance, molten salt electrolysis was found to be the best possible route in Al production from the Na3AlF6–Al2O3 system, which is the dominating industrial technique to obtain an 80∼90% amount of rare-earth metals, including Ce, La, Nd, and Pr.56,57 Li is produced by electrolysis of a molten LiCl–KCl mixture.58 Recently, molten salt electrolysis was successfully utilized in the simultaneous extraction of Fe, V, Ti, Cr, and Mn from vanadium slags59 and recovery of Co and Li from spent LiCoO2 batteries.60 There are large differences in the environmental impacts of different molten salt electrolysis processes. For example, in the case of spent LiCoO2 battery recycling, the molten salt not only provides a desirable electrolyte to electrochemically break the chemical bonds of LiCoO2, but also acts as a green solvent to separate Li2CO3 and electrolytic Co and CoO. In addition, CO2 generated from the consumable carbon anode is converted to Li2CO3, which avoids greenhouse gas emissions and belongs to the category of “green chemistry”. However, in other molten salt electrolysis cases, CO2 emission and high-temperature operation may be the remaining issues need to be solved.
2.6 Electrokinetic separation
Electrokinetic separation, as an environmentally friendly and adaptable method, has been widely studied in detoxifying solid wastes with fine particles. In electrokinetic separation, metal ions are migrated and transported by the combined mechanisms of electrolysis, ion exchange, electromigration, electrophoresis, and electroosmosis with a direct current of low intensity or a low electrical potential difference through electrodes. Generally, the direct current electric field is much more effective at driving charged ions through the interspace of the grains than the natural hydraulic gradient. Recently, the electrokinetic separation technique was reported on the V extraction from spent catalysts,61 As extraction from mine tailings,62 and heavy metal extraction from fly ash.63 The heavy metals (e.g. Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, etc.) on the solid waste could escape into the environment, causing groundwater pollution by infiltration and the runoff of rainfall, and ultimately affect human beings. Electrokinetic separation is a high-efficiency strategy for the extraction of heavy metals, which decreases the risk of secondary pollution in the environment.
2.7 External field-intensified electrochemical extraction
External field-intensified electrochemical extraction is generally targeted at trying to radically increase mass transport rates on the electrode surface or to increase interfacial mass transfer between fluid phases,41 including photoelectrochemical (PEC) extraction, the microbial electrochemical strategy, rotating electrode extraction, and the introduction of the ultrasonic, magnetic, microwave, and supergravity fields. The light-intensified electrochemical process is primarily regarded as a way of supplementing the electrical energy required for electrolysis based on the PEC process, which involves the conversion of light energy into electrical energy, and charge separation and transfer on the semiconductors. In the ultrasonic-electrochemical mode, ultrasound accelerates the mass transport, decreases the viscosity of the pore fluid, increases the porosity and hydraulic conductivity, and eliminates the migration barriers during the electrochemical process. For example, ultrasound-electrokinetic extraction of Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd from fly ash was investigated for enhancing the leaching efficiency of heavy metals.64
The microbial electrochemical strategy, in which the electron transfer chain associated with microbial respiration plays a key role, can contribute to the routes of valuable metal extraction.65 The working principle of microbial electrochemistry for metal recovery is aroused from that microorganisms may colonize the anode, the cathode, or both. For example, the cathode could provide the reducing power (typically H2) to the microorganisms, which can use the energy gained while simultaneously reducing the metal ions as the electron acceptor. Several methods have been employed to achieve desirable metal extraction or recovery via microbial electrochemistry. Electrochemically active microorganisms have been used either at the anode to lower the overall energy consumption of the process by oxidizing organic compounds or at the cathode to catalyze the metal deposition and microbial reduction or precipitation of metal ions. Microbial electrolysis cells and microbial fuel cells have recently emerged as promising methods for anodic organic wastewaters treatment with simultaneously producing the reducing equivalents for the generation of cathodic metal recovery. Till now, the microbial electrochemical strategy has been reported for the recovery of Au, V, Cr, Ag, Cu, Fe, Hg, Se, Cd, Zn, Ni, Pb, etc.66 Furthermore, the cooperation of the above-mentioned external fields could further improve the electrochemical extraction efficiency. For example, light irradiation and the microbial electrolysis cell were synergistically combined for efficient W and Mo deposition, achieving deposition of 81.5% (W) and 97.2% (Mo) with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.5%.67 From the environmental perspective, following the recovery of valuable metals, these external field-intensified methods have no harmful environmental impact and would be economically beneficial and environmentally sustainable due to the enhanced extraction efficiency.
3. The state-of-the-art for electrochemical metal extraction from industrial waste
The rapid industrialization process generates a variety of industrial wastes, mainly including metallurgical slag, electronic waste, spent catalyst, spent battery, fly ash, alloy scrap, and nuclear waste. Table 1 gives the metal contents of a list of different industrial wastes. These waste materials, which are causing serious environmental problems via improper disposal, can act as potential/secondary sources or artificial ores for valuable metals. This section reports a review of valuable metal extraction from various industrial wastes via electrochemical redox mediation strategies, including the technical aspect and environmental impact, which helps in the selection of a appropriate and green electrochemical strategy for the comprehensive recycling of industrial wastes.

3.1 Metallurgical slag
The metallurgical industry creates a huge amount of slags that are by-products in the production of metals. These metallurgical slags cause a huge source of waste without proper recycling and utilization. As a secondary raw material, the most efficient and economical option for reducing the metallurgical slags is through recycling. On the other hand, at least, poisonous metal components need to be removed in order to achieve a harmless stockpiling. The present investigations from the literature for the treatment of metallurgical slags are based on the above two strategies: material recyclying and toxicity reduction. Slags from various metallurgical flows were treated and utilized in different ways based on different slag characteristics. Herein, electrochemical methods were successfully applied in the treatment of electrolytic manganese residue, vanadium slag, chromium slag, mine tailings, and other residues.

3.1.1 Electrolytic manganese residue. 
Electrolytic manganese residue is an acid leaching residue produced by H2SO4 leaching of manganese carbonate ores, which contains manganese and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and seriously damages the ecological environment. The amount of electrolytic manganese residue is 8–12 times that of the corresponding electrolytic metal manganese product. Shu et al.96,97 and Tian et al.98 proposed electrochemical Mn extraction and NH4+-N leaching via the introduction of a Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair, H2O2 or surfactant additives. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 3a, contributed by the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair, high-valence Mn (+4, formed as MnO2) is reduced to the low-valence soluble Mn species (mainly Mn2+) by Fe2+, the produced Fe3+ is reduced and regenerated to Fe2+ in the cathodic region, and thus improves the Mn extraction efficiency.96 The extraction efficiency of Mn reaches 96.2% under the optimum conditions of a current density of 25 mA cm−2 on DSA-SS electrodes and 9.2 wt% H2SO4 media, which is 51.8% higher than that attained without an electric field and Fe2+. With the help of H2O2 additive, the leaching efficiencies of Mn and NH4+-N are strengthened up to 88.07% and 91.50%, respectively.98 Mn and NH4+-N are further recovered as MnCO3 and struvite, and the recovery efficiencies are 98.6% and 98.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, owing to the effect of electrochemical leaching and Fe2+-induced Fenton reaction, the proposed method can promote leaching of other heavy metals (including Zn, Cd, Pb, and As) from electrolytic manganese residue. On this basis, surfactant additives (tetradecyl trimethylammonium chloride (TTC)) and an anode iron plate were used to synergistically enhance the leaching behavior, as shown in Fig. 3b.97 Considering the environmental impact, electrochemical tuning of the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair or assistance with H2O2 has a low impact as those additives are green and harmless to the environment, while organic surfactant additives need to be well separated or removed after electrochemical treatment. Except that, based on the electromigration mechanism, electrokinetic remediation of Mn and NH4+-N from electrolytic manganese residue was also reported by using a pulsed electric field in different agents (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and citric acid (CA)), achieving the highest removal efficiency of Mn and NH4+-N of 94.74% and 88.20%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3c.99 These studies provide a practical electrochemical system to achieve the goal of both harmless disposal and valuable metal recovery from electrolytic manganese residue.

3.1.2 Vanadium and chromium-containing slag. 
Vanadium slag is obtained by the blast furnace oxidizing and converter blowing from vanadium–titanium magnetite in the ferrous metallurgical process, which is also considered as the main raw material for the V production. High-temperature sodium roasting and calcification roasting are the main ways for V extraction, which oxidize the insoluble low-valence vanadium (+2, +3, and +4) in spinel into water-soluble V(V). However, some vanadium spinel remained unoxidized, while the problems relevant to high energy consumption and low resource utilization efficiency during high-temperature roasting are still unsolved. Electro-oxidation or electrochemical oxidative dissolution was reported for the V extraction from vanadium slags. Wang et al.100 introduced an electrochemical field to enhance the decomposition of vanadium slag in concentrated NaOH medium. V and Cr spinel in the vanadium slag can be directly electrochemically oxidized on the anode surface. Under the optimal conditions (40 wt% NaOH, 120 °C, and a current density of 750 A m−2), the extraction percentages of V and Cr could reach 95% and 90%, respectively. The reaction temperature by this approach is 60∼280 °C lower than that by other alkaline liquid oxidation methods, and the alkaline concentration also decreases by over 30%, demonstrating substantial advantages and prospects in terms of industrial application. Liu et al.70,101 reported enhanced leaching of vanadium slag in acidic solution (40 wt% H2SO4) by electro-oxidation, which is conducive to breaking down the outside Si layer to release the remaining V and disrupting the uneven distribution of VO3− to facilitate directional movement. In addition to the direct anodic oxidation, other anodic products, such as O2 and high-valence Mn and Fe species, are also getting involved in the oxidation of M(V2O3) to M(VO3)x. Deng et al.69,102 further investigated V leaching in electrocatalytic oxidation and coupling catalytic oxidation by adding sodium persulfate from low-temperature sodium roasting vanadium slag, as shown in Fig. 4a. In terms of the electrochemical redox mediation concept, ·OH and oxygen are produced from the circulation of water and persulfate/sulfate. Compared with sulfuric acid leaching (high acid consumption and high concentration of impurities) and salt-roasting methods (high temperature and toxic and harmful gases emission, such as HCl and Cl2), electrochemical oxidation is an environmentally friendly process, which has the lowest environmental impact and offers good selectivity for vanadium. However, the utilization of concentrated alkaline or acid media is the remaining issue that needs to be solved, which may cause corrosion on the reactor and electrodes in long-term practical application.

Chromium pollution has been historically widespread across the world. It is difficult to remediate polluted sites caused by Cr-containing waste, including chromite ore processing residue (COPR) and chromium residue, and thus, most chromium-slag is simply deposited over a span of decades. Chromium residue is generated from iron and steel mill wastewater treatment, including reduction of Cr(VI) and V(V) by Fe or FeSO4, and NH3 precipitation processes. Peng et al.71,103,104 optimized the Cr residue treatment from the selective electrochemical oxidative dissolution of V (>91%) by electro-oxidation and addition of H2O2 in NaOH medium to the two-step coupling dissolution of V (>95%) and Cr (>96%) under electrochemical field and H2O2 addition, respectively. Herein, both the electrochemical field and H2O2 additives are focused on promoting the conversion of V(III)/V(V) and V(IV)/V(V) redox pairs, as shown in Fig. 4b. As for the Cr slag, Yu et al.105 aimed to develop electrochemical remediation for Cr(VI) in chromium-slag leakage with self-generated electricity via a urea-Cr(VI) cell, in which urea is employed as the fuel and Cr(VI) from the leakage of the dichromate slag serves as the oxidant. The removal percent of Cr(VI) can be achieved higher than 96% after 18 h with the leakage Cr(VI) concentration of 2.69 mM. This unique approach explores the feasibility of the technique without external energy input for simultaneous chromium-slag remediation and generation of electricity.


3.1.3 Other metallurgical slags. 
Furthermore, electrochemical extraction and electrochemical redox remediation were applied in the treatment of galvanic sludge, Te-containing Doré slag, and As-containing mine tailings. Galvanic sludge arises from the precipitation of rinse-water or spent electrolytes and etchants in electroplating and electronics plants. The most common method of galvanic waste disposal is as landfill but this is not an environmental-friendly approach. Huyen et al.68 combined H2SO4 leaching and electrowinning (using a batch recirculation Porocell reactor with a 3D carbon felt cathode, as shown in Fig. 4c) to achieve >99% Cu extraction from the sludge, which is a green process. The combination of aqua regia leaching and the electrowinning process was also reported by Halli et al.,106 for the Te recovery from the Doré slag, which is considered to be an irretrievable resource and secondary product from the treatment of copper electrorefining anode slime. The challenge by focusing on the recovery of diluted Te via the EDRR was stressed, as shown in Fig. 4d, resulting in ∼64 wt% purity in the deposits from the EDRR Te recovery from the Doré slag. The ED and EDRR—when combined—offer the opportunity to decrease Te wastage via the mediation of a redox reaction between the sacrificial metal and Te, whilst enhancing the overall sustainability of Te production. The EDRR recovery of Te has a significant impact on the overall environmental and economic sustainability of a Cu smelter process. Considering the strong corrosive effect of 30% aqua regia, even to the Pt cathode, alternative effective leaching methods were appealed to investigate for further reducing the costs. Besides, Isosaari et al.62 utilized the electrokinetic remediation method to separate As from Cu–W–As mine tailings and prevent it from leaching into the environment. Chemical equilibrium modeling results suggest that oxalate and phosphate ions (as additives) could prevent the formation of As-bearing minerals and affect their electrokinetic mobility.

3.2 Waste electrical and electronic equipment
The lifespan of electronic devices has become relatively short, creating a large amount of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE, also called e-waste), which is classified as one type of urban mine. As nearly 40% of e-waste is comprised of valuable metals, e-waste is an invaluable unconventional resource. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of e-waste is alarming due to severe environmental impacts and challenges associated with complex resource extraction that has led to the use of toxic chemicals. The complexity of e-waste requires the development of a new generation of sustainable processes that can separate and extract valuable metals.4

3.2.1 Waste printed circuit boards. 
Printed circuit boards (PCBs) which are key components in electronic equipment, have a yearly accumulation of 1.5∼2 million tons, representing 6 wt% of the total WEEE. Waste PCBs are considered an attractive secondary source of metals due to the high content of Cu (16 wt%), Sn (4 wt%), Ni (2 wt%), and precious metals (0.1 wt%). The electrochemical leaching of metals from waste PCBs can reduce the amount of acid and recover valuable metals without loss. The recycling of metal components from waste PCBs by employing the electrooxidation method has been explored using chlorine, oxygen, and HClO. Kim et al.75 reported leaching of Cu and other base metals, such as Pb, Sn, and Zn, from waste PCBs via electro-mediated Cl2 generation by employing two different reactors: (a) a combined reactor facilitated with simultaneous Cl2 generation and metal leaching, and (b) a separate metal leaching reactor connected with the anode compartment of a Cl2 gas generator. However, the environmental impact of Cl2 limits their large-scale application.
Fogarasi et al.74 reported a combined chemical–electrochemical oxidation process, involving acidic ferric chloride solution, for the simultaneous recovery of Cu and separation of Au-rich residue from waste PCBs. A laboratory-scale leaching plant is realized, which allows the recovery of a high-purity Cu deposit (99.04%) at a current efficiency of 63.84% and specific energy consumption of 1.75 kW h kg−1 Cu. Simultaneously, the Au concentration in the Au-rich solid residue is 25 times that in the initial waste PCBs. Based on that, they further reported the second method for Cu recovery from waste PCBs by chemical dissolution with Fe3+ combined with the simultaneous electrowinning of Cu and oxidant regeneration (electrochemical Fe2+/Fe3+ redox mediation) to increase the overall process performance.107 The optimal hydrodynamic conditions are provided at 400 mL min−1, leading to the 75% dissolution of metals and low specific energy consumption (1.59 kW h kg−1 Cu). A new type three-chamber electrochemical reactor connected in series with a chemical reactor equipped with a perforated rotating drum is used, which employs ceramic separators instead of anion exchange membranes, being cheaper and less sensitive to the electrolyte composition.
Before the pilot or industrial-scale application, it is necessary to make an environmental impact assessment of the developed process. Fogarasi et al.108 applied the Biwere–Heinzle method for the early environmental assessment of the above two copper recovery processes (direct electrochemical oxidation and electrochemical Fe2+/Fe3+ redox mediation for Cu dissolution) using the mass balances calculated for the optimal conditions. Both electrochemical processes have a very low environmental impact globally and the highest risks of toxicity can be attributed to the acidic solutions. Among them, it is evident that the process using the redox-mediated dissolution has a lower environmental impact than the direct one, because the regenerated leaching solution can be used for further processing of PCBs without the addition of fresh reagents.
Cocchiara et al.109 investigated the leaching of all exposed metals on PCBs by using 0.5 M H2SO4, 0.4 M CuSO4, and 4 M NaCl. Air was blown into the leaching solution to regenerate Cu2+ ion, which acts as the predominant oxidant species. The key role in the dismantling/leaching process is played by Cl− that stabilizes Cu+ through the chloro-complex formation. In galvanostatic and potentiostatic modes, pure Cu is obtained after the removal of all surface impurities by dipping in acidic concentrated NaCl solution. Yang et al.78 developed a slurry electrolysis process for the extraction and recovery of valuable metals from PCBs. The microstructure of the Cu product could be well-tuned to get the micro-Cu powder and superfine Cu powder.110,111 Furthermore, the ionic liquid [BSO3HPy]HSO4 and [MIm]HSO4112,113 were also used to partially replace H2SO4 in the H2SO4–CuSO4–NaCl slurry electrolysis system, which may be limited by the economic factor for practical application.


3.2.2 Scrap mobile electronics. 
Lister et al.114 and Diaz et al.13 reported a comprehensive electrochemical process for the recovery of valuable and critical metals from scrap mobile electronics, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. The electrochemical recycling process generates oxidizing agents at an anode to dissolve metals from the scrap matrix while reducing dissolved metals at the cathode. A flow chart is developed where two stages of electro-recycling are proposed: (i) initial dissolution of Cu, Sn, Ag, and magnet materials by using Fe3+ generated in acidic sulfate solution and (ii) final dissolution of Pd and Au by using electro-generated Cl2 in an HCl solution. Rare earth elements (REEs) are selectively extracted from the ferromagnetic fraction by utilizing anaerobic extraction in an acid media. The whole process is well-optimized using the response surface methodology,115 reducing the specific energy consumption of the electrochemical recovery process to 1.94 kW h per kg of the recovered metal. Economic evaluation results indicated that the electrochemical process is a competitive alternative for the recovery of valuable metals from electronic waste when compared with the traditional black Cu smelting process.116 A significantly lower capital investment, 2.9 kg e-waste per dollar of capital investment, can be achieved with the electrochemical process vs. 1.3 kg per dollar in the black Cu smelting process.

(c) Schematic illustration and (d) workflow of Cu and Au extraction from CPU sockets by slurry electrolysis. Reproduced with permission.79 Copyright 2019, Elsevier. 
Furthermore, to quantify and compare the environmental impact of the electrochemical, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical processes, life cycle analysis has been conducted.117 The most influential input in the electrochemical method is HCl, and for the pyrometallurgical method it is copper scrap, while for the hydrometallurgical method, it is the oxidant that dominates the overall environmental footprint. The electrochemical process has lower chemical consumption, enhanced controllability, and reduced energy demand compared to the other processes. The results demonstrated that the electrochemical process has the lowest environmental impacts compared to the other two processes, which warrants further development of the electrochemical process at the industrial scale.


3.2.3 Other electronic wastes. 
Abbott et al.7 reported the electrocatalytic recovery of metals from complex mixtures (GaAs wafer-material, model Cu/Zn system, and natural Au–Ag alloy) using deep eutectic solvents, while the dissolution and subsequent selective recovery of elements from complex mixtures necessitate electrochemical redox mediation. Herein, chloride-based deep eutectic solvents, such as ethaline, are used to simplify the speciation of solutes and to allow redox potentials to be modified, compared to standard aqueous values. Instead of cyanidation, an environmentally hazardous process for Au extraction, the redox mediator used here is iodine, as it demonstrates high solubility, fast electron transfer, and reversible redox behavior whilst maintaining a high redox potential to oxidize most metals. From a sustainability perspective, iodine is available in large quantities and is environmentally benign once it has been reduced to iodide.
Rudnik et al.77 reported anodic dissolution of smelted low-grade waste electronic parts (Cu–Zn–Sn–Ag–Pb alloy, 80∼92% Cu) in acid sulfate and sulfate-chloride solutions, resulting in distinct metal separation with Cu and Sn co-deposited on the cathode, Pb and Ag accumulation in the slimes, while Zn, Fe, and Ni were transferred to the electrolyte. Haccuria et al.76 proposed a one-step recovery of Cu from electronic waste by combining anodic dissolution and cathodic deposition in a single chamber cell with an ammonia-based electrolyte. Moreover, slurry electrolysis was utilized for metal extraction from powder CPU sockets in the HCl–NaCl–H2O2 electrolyte.79 As shown in Fig. 5c and d, Cu powder is successfully deposited onto the cathode, and Au is leached out and enriched in the electrolyte, which is up to 95.73%. However, it is inconvenient to recover Au in this electrolyte because its concentration is too low (about 9.98 ppm). In order to accumulate Au, Yi et al.81 reused the electrolyte up to 13 times in recycling not only Cu but also precious metals such as Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt, which could significantly lower recycling costs as well as environmental pressures.
Conventional methods for the Au extraction from wastes involving nitrohydrochloric acid or cyanide requires not only costs for the agents, but also the expensive treatment of the waste solution. Moriwaki et al.118 proposed an eco-friendly and cost-effective one-step electrochemical method for the extraction of Au from the e-waste anode as nanoparticles stabilized by phospholipids, which is achieved by applying an AC voltage for 5 s to Au-containing e-wastes. In this process, Au is rapidly extracted from the e-wastes without using any expensive equipment or applying toxic reagents. Liu et al.82 proposed a potential-controlled electrodeposition method for the recovery of Pd nanoparticles from waste multilayer ceramic capacitors in 0.5 M HNO3, which produces high-purity Pd (>99%) with a high recovery rate of 99.02%. In summary, Table 2 provides a summary of the typical processes and experimental details of electrochemical metal extraction from e-waste, indicating that a high extraction efficiency is obtained via these electrochemical strategies.

3.3 Spent batteries

3.3.1 Spent lithium-ion batteries. 
LIBs have been regarded as the most promising “green battery” due to their high energy density, good design flexibility, and long lifespan in comparison with other types of batteries.119 In recent years, various types of LIBs have been extensively explored and practically applied, including LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, Li(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2, LiFePO4, etc.120 Currently, the cathode is considered the most valuable component due to the composition consisting of scarce or valuable metals such as Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, as well as FePO4. The state-of-the-art recycling processes, which are generally based on chemical leaching methods, have critical issues like enormous consumption of chemicals and secondary pollution, and always involve tedious procedures.
Meng et al.48 reported a cathodic reduction method for leaching of Co from spent LiCoO2 LIBs. The LiCoO2 powder is used as the cathode and Al foil is separated by dissolving in 5 wt% NaOH. The electrochemical leaching efficiencies reach 90% for Co and 94% for Li using 1.25 mol L−1 of malic acid and a working voltage of 8 V for 3 h at 70 °C. Unlike the conventional ways that employ strong acid lixiviants and reducing agents, molten salt electrolysis was utilized by Zhang et al.60 to recover Co and Li from spent LiCoO2 LIBs, which employs electrons as the reducing agent and molten salt as a solvent to recycle spent LIBs. As shown in Fig. 6a, the spent LiCoO2 is electrochemically reduced to either CoO or Co at the cathode, releasing Li2O into molten salts where Li2O combined with CO2 generated at the carbon anode to produce Li2CO3. After electrolysis, CoO/Co and Li2CO3 are leached out from the molten salts in water, and the recovery rates of Li and Co are high up to 85% and 99%, respectively. The slurry electrolysis strategy, reported by Li et al.,51 was employed for the economically feasible recovery of Li and Mn from scrap LiMn2O4 in H2SO4–MnSO4 electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 6b. More than 99% and 92% of Li and Mn are leached out at 90 °C, and the current efficiency of the cathode and anode can reach 77 and 62%, respectively. Phase analysis indicated that pure MnO2 is deposited in 1.0 mol L−1 H2SO4, and LiMn2O4 cannot be leached into Mn2+ directly. The leaching of Mn2+ from scrap LiMn2O4 involves the steps of Li leaching and MnO2 leaching. Finally, a closed-loop process is proposed for the recovery of high-purity Li2CO3 (99.59 wt%) and MnO2 (92.33 wt%) from scrap LiMn2O4. Prabaharan et al.88 studied the electrochemical recovery of Co, Mn, and Cu from spent LIBs including the steps of electrochemical leaching (99% leaching efficiency of Co and Mn), electrochemical deposition of Cu, and separation of Co and Mn from the leach liquor. The metallic Co and electrolytic MnO2 are recovered at 200 A m−2, pH 2∼2.5, and 90 °C. The overall recovery of Co, Cu, and Mn is above 96%, 97%, and 99%, respectively. In terms of the environmental impact, the effluents generated are the saturated sodium sulfate liquid effluent (could be crystallized) and graphite solid effluent, both showing major commercial applications and can be sold out as byproducts.

For the recycling of spent LiFePO4 batteries, Yu et al.12 reported an important electrochemical redox mediation approach in light of a redox targeting-based process to obtain high-purity LiOH (99.90%) and FePO4 (99.97%), as shown in Fig. 6c. With 0.20 M [Fe(CN)6]3− solution as a selective and regenerative redox mediator, LiFePO4 is readily broken down into FePO4 and Li+via the redox targeting reaction between the redox mediator and LiFePO4, with a recycling efficiency for Li up to 99.8%. With a regenerative oxygen flow cell, the consumed [Fe(CN)6]3− is instantaneously regenerated while Li+ is separated and collected from the counter compartment in the form of LiOH. The results demonstrated that with suitable redox mediators, the electrochemical strategy can be designed for the recovery of LiOH and FePO4. Li et al.121 reported anionic membrane slurry electrolysis for selective recovery of Li and FePO4/C from spent LiFePO4. Inspired by the charging process of the LiFePO4 battery, as shown in Fig. 6d, spent LiFePO4 is delithiated and oxidized to FePO4 by the function of electrons from the slurry electrolysis system. The leaching efficiency of Li can reach 98% and over 96% of Fe is recycled as FePO4/C. On account of claiming Li and environmental sustainability, there is a conspicuous benefit of recycling spent LiFePO4 batteries by electrochemical redox mediation from the economic and environmental impact viewpoint. In summary, typical electrochemical recycling processes of spent LIBs are provided in Table 3, illustrating that the extraction ratio is high but still needs further investigation for optimizing the mass-transfer properties and reducing the work conditions.

3.3.2 Spent lead-acid batteries. 
The spent lead-acid batteries contain PbO2 film cathodes, sponge metallic Pb anodes, fiberglass mat separators, and aqueous sulfuric acid electrolyte solutions. Typically, the average mass of Pb pastes from one spent lead-acid battery is a 6 kg mixture of PbSO4 (50∼60 wt%), PbO (5∼–10 wt%), PbO2 (15∼35 wt%), and metallic Pb (2∼5 wt%).123 The lead-acid battery recycling industry is very well established, but the conventional pyrometallurgical processes, with high energy consumptions and expensive gaseous and liquid pollution abatement technologies, are far from being environmentally benign. Recently, green electrochemical recycling of spent lead-acid batteries was developed. Maruthamuthu et al.124 investigated the electrokinetic separation of sulfate and Pb from a spent lead-acid battery sludge (a mixture of (PbO)4Pb(SO4), Pb2O3, PbSO4, Pb(S2O3), and Pb2(SO4)). As shown in Fig. 7a, the sulfates and Pb2+ are migrated respectively into anode and cathode compartments, and insoluble Pb oxides are accumulated at the central compartment, which needs to improve the separation of Pb and sulfates efficiently from the sludge and also completely eliminate the presence of Pb oxides in the central compartment. Pan et al.125 reported a high-purity metallic Pb recovery method by electrolyzing PbO obtained from waste lead-acid batteries in alkaline solution, achieving the cell voltage of 1.23 V, the current efficiency of 99.9%, the Pb recovery efficiency of 99.8%, and the energy consumption of 317 kW h per ton Pb at 20 mA cm−2. The sodium ionic exchange membrane is used to prevent HPbO2− from being oxidized to PbO2 on the anode. Alternatively, Pan et al.91 further developed a H2-PbO fuel cell to recover high-purity Pb, along with electricity (only H2O as the by-product) from spent lead-acid battery, with an anolyte of 20% NaOH and a catholyte of 20% NaOH + 0.1 M PbO at 5 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 7b. The overall reaction of the fuel cell is H2 + PbO(s) → H2O + Pb(s). Furthermore, a deep eutectic solvent (choline chloride/urea, 1:2) was applied for the dissolution of PbSO4, PbO2, and PbO, Pb(II) electro-reduction, and Pb electrodeposition processes (coulombic efficiency >90%).126 Ionic liquids, including 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and hydrophobic Brønsted acidic amide-type ionic liquids,127,128 were also reported for the electrochemical extraction of Pb from the spent lead-acid batteries.

In total, the existing lead pyrometallurgical processes and developing hydrometallurgical processes are facing environmental issues, including high energy consumption with toxic Pb emission, high electricity consumption, toxic chemical utilization and severe corrosion of metallic components, respectively. The electrochemical Pb recycling from spent lead-acid batteries, as a green and sustainable process, is not only related to the sustainable development of the Pb industry, but also reducing Pb pollution in the environment.


3.3.3 Spent photovoltaic devices and Ni–Cd batteries. 
Spent photovoltaic devices and spent Ni–Cd batteries were also recycled via electrochemical strategies. Poll et al.129 reported electrochemical recycling of Pb from hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, and MAPbI3−xClx) photovoltaic devices using deep eutectic solvents. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements have identified the atoms solvating the dissolved Pb to be Cl, forming a [PbCl3]− species. The results demonstrate that up to 99.8% of Pb is removed from the solvent using a Pb working electrode, which is a hugely effective method to recover Pb from HOIP-based solar cells, both for future market end-of-life disposal as well as the increasing number of test cells currently being generated in research laboratories globally. For the environmental impact, the advantage of the deep eutectic solvent electrolyte over aqueous solvents is the reduction in the risk of the waste solution being introduced to the water supply, as well as there is no need to use volatile organic solvents and concentrated acids. Furthermore, the electrochemical process significantly reduces the environmental footprint of high-temperature smelting. Hazotte et al.130 developed the recovery of Cd, Co, and Ni from spent Ni–Cd batteries by electro-assisted leaching and electrodeposition in a single-cell process, producing solid residue composed of Ni and C, Cd-free Ni and Co salt solution, and metallic Cd.

3.4 Spent catalysts
Catalysts have a very wide range in the oil refining industry, chemical engineering, power plants, and the automobile industry, and the number of uses is increasing gradually. However, during processing, catalysts get contaminated due to the heavy metals, coke, and other poisonous elements and become deactivated over a period of time. When the activity of the catalyst declines below the acceptable level, that catalyst is usually regenerated and reused, but regeneration is not possible every time. After a few cycles of regeneration and reuse, the catalyst activity may decrease, and further regeneration may not be economically feasible. These spent catalysts contain valuable metal resources, which are classified as hazardous waste concerning its disposal. Conventionally, pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes have been employed for the recovery of spent catalysts. However, due to the long process flow, high energy consumption, and heavy waste emission, it is highly desirable to develop an effective and green technique for disposal of spent catalysts. The waste-free electrochemical recovery of spent catalysts based on the electrochemical redox mediation core concept was reported as an emerging development direction, due to its simple flowsheet, low energy consumption, high output, and low environmental impact.

3.4.1 Spent fluid catalytic cracking catalysts. 
Deniz et al.61 reported the electrokinetic extraction of V from spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts. FCC catalysts are used in petroleum refining processes to accelerate the conversion of the cracking reaction and increase the yield of the desired product, and are composed of an inert matrix (usually kaolin), an active matrix (alumina), a binder (silica or silica-alumina), and a zeolite Y. However, residues of As, V, and Ni from the impurities in crude oil can poison and clog the porous structure of catalysts. Electrokinetic processes exhibit good performance for V extraction within 48 h and 81.62 kW h kg−1 energy consumption under the best operating conditions of 0.5 mol L−1 H2SO4 concentration and an electric potential of 5 V. A response surface is generated for V extraction to provide better visualization of the behavior response as a function of the studied variables. Except for V, typically, spent FCC catalysts contain at least 0.5% rare earth (La and Ce). Zhou et al.131 reported electro-oxidation and solvent extraction of REEs from spent FCC catalysts after 2 M HNO3 leaching and Fe removal steps (Fig. 8a). Electrochemical oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ and in situ extraction employing 100 mM di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) in n-octane give rise to La3+ in a high purity of up to 99.5% and Ce4+ up to 100% in a single extraction step. However, the organic extraction agent carries a risk of being oxidized during the electrochemical oxidation process, thus causing reagent loss. Organic wastewater should also be considered from an environmental perspective.

3.4.2 Spent automotive catalysts. 
The spent automotive catalyst is an important source of platinum group metals (PGMs) since they contain metals in considerably higher concentrations than the ores from which they are extracted. Kim et al.132 developed an eco-friendly technique of using electrogenerated Cl2 for the extraction of PGMs from the spent automotive catalysts (containing 0.128 wt% Pt and 0.015 wt% Rh). The proposed process involves in situ electrochemical Cl2 generation and innocuous treatment, while the chloride resource is recycled via the electrochemical reduction step of the unconsumed Cl2, called “innocuous treatment” after leaching, which markedly decreases the requirement of Cl− for Cl2 generation and enhances the process safety compared to the conventional scheme. The efficiency is enhanced by a fast dissolution and high solubility of electro-generated Cl2 as ClO− in an alkaline NaCl solution. Over 99.6% of Pt and 65% of Rh from the spent automotive catalysts could be leached without discharging the unconsumed Cl2 into air under the conditions of 100 g L−1 solid/liquid (S/L) ratio and 80 °C in 8.0 M HCl solution.


3.4.3 Spent selective catalytic reduction catalysts. 
The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 to harmless N2 and H2O has primarily been applied to control NOx emissions.133 V2O5–WO3/TiO2 catalysts are at the core of the SCR technology in stationary source applications, particularly for coal-fired power plants. As is a serious poisonous element for commercial V2O5–WO3/TiO2 because of the consumption of Lewis acid sites.134 Xue et al.83 reported a sustainable electrochemical detoxification and regeneration process for the spent V2O5–WO3/TiO2 catalyst disposal (Fig. 8b). In this process, As is efficiently removed by the EAOPs, where HO2− and highly oxidative ·OH are in situ generated from the two-electron ORR and electro-Fenton-like reaction, respectively, via electrochemical mediation of O2/HO2− and HO2−/·OH redox pairs. After electro-oxidative dissolution, the catalyst support (TiO2 and WO3) is recovered for the subsequent re-fabrication process. The regenerated SCR catalyst shows a comparable deNOx catalytic activity to the fresh catalyst. The present electrochemical strategy provides a promising approach for the spent SCR catalyst utilization and further understanding of in situ electro-generated ROS. The process that has been developed is cleaner and more environmentally friendly, in line with the concept of zero waste generation and material regeneration.

3.5 Fly ash
Fly ash from the incineration of municipal solid waste and the combustion of coal is a source of secondary pollutants (containing Cu, Zn, Pb, As, Ni, and Cd), and has been classified as hazardous waste and requires effective treatment before landfill or comprehensive utilization. Compared to them, electrochemical strategies can not only improve the heavy metal extraction ability, but also increase the proportion of the stable form of heavy metals on the residue, which reduces harm to the environment.

3.5.1 Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash. 
The major elements in municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash are Ca, Si, Al, Fe, Mg, Na, K, and Cl, and common oxides in MSWI fly ash are CaO, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, Na2O, and K2O. MSWI fly ash is often disposed of in landfills, which may be recycled for the production of cement and concrete, road pavement, glasses and ceramics, agricultural nutrients, stabilizing agents, adsorbents, and zeolites.135 However, before landfill or recycling, heavy metal extraction is needed from both environmental and resource considerations.
Electrokinetic separation has been studied in the treatment of MSWI fly ash regarding its environmental friendliness, compatibility, and multifunctional adaptability. The heavy metal components are migrated into the specific area by the combined mechanisms of electrolysis, ion exchange, electromigration, and electrophoresis with a direct-current electric field being imposed on the sample region. However, electrokinetic separation has intrinsic drawbacks regardless of the promising aspects, such as pH dependency, concentration polarization, concentration focusing, and secondary electrochemical reactions. MSWI fly ash has a high acid buffering capacity and excellent adsorption characteristics, which perplexes the acidification process of the electrolyzer and prolongs the remediation time during the electro-kinetics processes.
Zhang et al.136 and Huang et al.63 reported an enhanced electrokinetic process for the heavy metal extraction from MSWI fly ash with a unique 3D electrode system, which is more effective in elevating the extraction of heavy metals compared with the traditional 2D electrode, achieving the maximum extraction efficiencies of 79.54%, 67.34%, 81.34% and 59.11% for Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd, respectively. In terms of the mechanism, not only hydrolysis (water splitting) but also anodic oxidation (·OH production) and cathodic reduction (metal deposition) processes occurred. The ·OH facilitates the generation of mediated oxidants such as O3, H2O2, HPO52−etc., changing the chemical valences of heavy metals, increasing the immigration resistance of ions, and impacting the speciation and phases of the new compounds.
Afterward, Huang et al.64 further reported low-frequency ultrasound-enhanced electrokinetic remediation for extraction of Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd from MSWI fly ash, reaching the maximum removal efficiencies of 69.84%, 64.24%, 67.74%, and 59.93%, respectively. The synergetic action of acidification and ultrasonication is demonstrated to be most effective in enhancing the remedial efficiencies in the electrokinetics process compared with other activation systems. Heavy metals are continuously extracted from the solid grains of the fly ash by protonic attack and bubble implosion. The obtained risk-assessment-code values indicate that the adoption of the ultrasound-enhanced electrokinetic remediation system reduces the environmental toxicity for fly ash to the maximum extent. Tian et al.72 reported the electrochemical washing method for extracting heavy metals from MSWI fly ash with the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Under the optimal conditions (a current density of 35 mA cm−2, the EDTA dosage of 0.5 mol L−1, pH = 2, t = 4 h), the extraction efficiencies of Cd, Ni, Pb, Cu, As, and Zn are 100%, 99.59%, 97.78%, 85%, 74.69%, and 85%, respectively.


3.5.2 Coal fly ash. 
Coal fly ash (CFA), produced from coal combustion in thermal power plants (more than 800 Mt per annum worldwide),54 is one of the largest solid waste resources. There are adverse environmental and health effects caused by the landfilled and impounded CFA. Composed of 40∼60% alumina component, high-alumina CFA is produced mainly in China, while the recovery of alumina is being widely investigated to make it a potential substitute for bauxite. Sulfuric acid leaching-carbonation and alkaline hydro-chemical methods were applied for the alumina recovery from CFA.137 Alumina extraction from high-alumina CFA has to be evaluated from the environmental perspective and cleaner extraction of alumina should be paid more attention. Shi et al.54,138,139 proposed a green electrochemical Al extraction process from CFA via H2SO4 leaching-membrane electrolysis, acid baking-electrolysis, and H2SO4 leaching-single chamber electrolysis. Membrane electrolysis with a two-membrane and three-chamber cell for Al extraction was developed. Al(OH)3 is the main product with a yield of 64.48% and the energy consumption is 4.88 kW h kg−1 Al(OH)3 after 20 h electrolysis (Fig. 9a and b). In the middle chamber, Al3+ migrates to the cathodic chamber to form Al(OH)3 precipitate under the combined action of direct current and the exchange membranes. On the cathode side, H2O gains electrons and reacts with Al3+ on the cathode to form Al(OH)3 and H2. On the anode side, H2SO4 and O2 are generated due to the water oxidation. In the whole process, Al2(SO4)3 solution in the middle chamber can be refreshed to attain continuous electrolysis. Moreover, acid baking-electrolysis was also developed to extract Al(OH)3 from CFA.138 During acid baking, the maximum Al leaching efficiency reaches 86.8% under the optimal conditions (T = 200 °C, tacid baking = 90 min, and tball milling = 5 min). After electrolysis, porous Al(OH)3 is the main product with a specific surface area of 33 m2 g−1. In these electrochemical Al recovery processes, the impurity ions (Ca2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, and Mg2+) in the leachate might influence the electrolysis process, which deserves future study. From the perspective of energy consumption, the above H2SO4 leaching combined room-temperature membrane electrolysis method, without additional heating, is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than the high-temperature baking-electrolysis process.

3.6 Magnet scrap and alloy scrap
Alloy scrap is produced during metal product fabrication or when a metal-containing product reaches its end of life, which includes conventional alloy scrap (e.g. Cu-based, Ni-based, and Al-based alloy scrap), magnet scrap, cemented scrap, etc.

3.6.1 Magnet scrap. 
NdFeB magnet scrap consists of 20∼30 wt% of REEs, which are an important secondary resource containing Nd, Pr, Gd, Dy, and Ho.140 It has been estimated that the total production of NdFeB magnets will reach 120000 tons by 2020.141 Recycling of REEs from spent magnets will play an important and complementary role in the total supply of REEs in the future. In hydrometallurgical processes, NdFeB magnets are completely leached in HCl acid, while Fe is unselectively co-extracted along with REEs. In pyrometallurgical processes, REEs can be selectively leached from NdFeB after an energy-intensive high-temperature (900 °C) roasting pretreatment step. However, the main drawback is the sluggish kinetics and requiring a long time to completely extract REEs. To enhance the extraction kinetics and decrease the acid dosage, Venkatesan et al.11,92 reported a room-temperature electrochemical process for efficiently recycling NdFeB magnet waste via in situ electrochemical oxidation and membrane electrolysis (Fig. 9c and d). In situ electrochemical oxidation is performed to selectively oxidize Fe2+ in the HCl leaching solution to Fe3+. More than 98% of REEs are selectively precipitated with oxalic acid as rare-earth oxalates and Co is recovered by the electrowinning process to obtain pure metallic Co. Despite the excess utilization of oxalic acid, this process is environmentally benign without solid waste or wastewater release. The leaching followed by electro-oxidation can be carried out in the same reactor, thereby simplifying recycling steps.
Membrane electrolysis was developed to selectively recover REEs followed by partial leaching of NdFeB magnet waste.11 The acid liberated from the oxidation of Fe2+ is captured in the anolyte and used in leaching the undissolved magnet waste. Higher than 95% of REEs are leached into the solution and all the Fe is removed as the Fe(OH)3 precipitate. Oxalic acid is also used as a precipitating agent to separate REEs from Co. The whole process consumes only NaCl, oxalic acid, and current and produced rare-earth oxides with a purity of ≥99%. As Fe is the major component of the magnet along with REEs, the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox is well mediated electrochemically. The major limitation that affects the process efficiency is the cathodic hydrogen evolution side-reaction. Makarova et al.25 reported electrochemical leaching of Fe and REEs from NdFeB magnets with sulfuric and oxalic acids using a unique 3D-printed Ti basket. The addition of oxalic acid in the leaching solution allows leaching at a lower cell voltage and separation of REE-oxalate precipitates. The electro-leaching behavior of Nd, Fe, B, and REEs in the mixed acid solution and the formation of metal oxalates were further discussed. Xu et al.142 proposed a facile anodic dissolution method for the simultaneous recovery of REEs and transition metals from NdFeB magnets, which enables a selective REEs extraction and precipitation, and a simultaneous Fe deposition with the total re-use of the electrolyte.


3.6.2 Alloy scrap. 
Owing to the increasing use of Mg alloys in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, and biomedical industries, more Mg-based alloy scrap is being produced. Wu et al.95 described a facile electrochemical method based on corrosion science to degrade waste Mg alloys. Mg alloys are immersed in a NaCl solution and a small voltage is applied to accelerate degradation (Mg + 2H2O → Mg2+ + 2OH− + H2). The solid degradation products are composed of mainly Mg(OH)2 nanosheets and can be used to remove dyes from the simulated sewage effectively via adsorption/aggregation, providing insights into how to turn Mg wastes into useful forms to lessen the environmental impact.
Furthermore, Benyahia et al.143 studied the electrochemical leaching of valuable metals (mainly Al, Ti, and Cr) from aircraft waste metal layers. Feng et al.94 reported the electrochemical dissolution of spent cobalt white alloy in an H2SO4 solution, obtaining an anodic current efficiency of 54.6% and a high recovery efficiency of Co (100%) and Fe (98.56%). The anodic passivation occurred due to the high Si content and generation of colloidal SiO2, which covered the anode surface and hindered the alloy dissolution. NH4Cl could accelerate the electrochemical dissolution of cobalt white alloy and preferentially adsorb on the anode surface and undermine the SiO2 coating and passive film. Wang et al.93 proposed an in situ electro-generated ROS-enhanced anodic dissolution mechanism for the recovery of cupronickel alloy scrap. Much higher leaching rates of Ni, Zn, and Cu are reached by the integrated electrochemical strategy than that of the direct anodic dissolution process, which is attributed to the in situ produced H2O2 and ·OH via the oxygen reduction reaction and electro-Fenton-like reaction, respectively.
In addition to aqueous electrochemical recovery, Zhang et al.144 utilized the molten-salt electrolysis method for the separation of Co and W from cemented carbide scrap in the NaCl–KCl melt at 750 °C. The WC-15 wt% Co cemented scrap sacrificial anode is dissolved to Co and W ions and consequently discharge on the cathode to deposit Co and W during electrolysis. According to the anodic polarization curve analysis, Co in the anode is oxidized at 0.25 V. Only Co is dissolved and deposited at a low potential, whereas W is dissolved and deposited when the potential exceeded 0.7 V. Co and W are well separated by a two-step electrolysis, thus producing Co powder (100 nm in diameter), W powder (below 200 nm in diameter), and porous carbon.

3.7 Nuclear waste
The accumulation of nuclear waste, especially spent nuclear fuels, from nuclear power plants is a major hurdle in the use of nuclear energy. The UO2 fuel is very insoluble especially under reducing conditions, but the solubility increases by orders of magnitude under oxidizing conditions, making the fuel susceptible to corrosion, which inspired us that extraction or dissolution of U could be tuned by electrochemical oxidation processes via an electrochemical redox mediation. Shoesmith et al.145 validated the electrochemical model for the oxidative dissolution of used nuclear fuel by comparing the dissolution rates of UO2, used fuel powder, and fuel pellets (temperature over the range 25∼75 °C). Good agreement was obtained between the measured and predicted rates in aerated carbonate solutions confirming that the dissolution reaction is electrochemical in mechanism and that its rate can be predicted electrochemically. Wu et al.146 reported an electrochemical study of H2O2 oxidation and decomposition on the nuclear fuel. The anodic oxidation and open circuit decomposition of H2O2 on the UO2 surface have been investigated voltammetrically and using linear polarization resistance measurements over the pH range from 9.5 to 12.6. At high pH, H2O2 decomposition occurs on an unblocked UO2 surface and the pH dependence of the reaction suggests that HO2− is the electroactive form of peroxide. The competition between H2O2 oxidation and UO2 dissolution on the anode suggests that the H2O2 decomposition could be the primary pathway for H2O2 consumption, instead of the H2O2-driven UO2 corrosion, suppressing the corrosion and dissolution rate. Based on mixed potential theory and consisting of a two-phase fuel surface made up of UO2 and a noble metal-bearing fission product phase in contact with groundwater, Jerden Jr. et al.147 investigated the fuel matrix dissolution model as an electrochemical reaction/diffusion model for the dissolution of spent UO2 fuel. The corrosion potential at the surface of the dissolving fuel is calculated by balancing cathodic and anodic reactions occurring at the solution interfaces with the UO2 and noble metal surfaces. Dissolved O2 and H2O2 generated from groundwater are the major oxidizing agents that promote fuel dissolution. Huang et al.148 combined electrochemical synthesis with the traditional ferrite method to remove Co2+ from liquid radioactive waste. The sacrificial Fe anode was used to generate Fe2+ and Fe3+, followed by the hydrolysis of Fe3+ producing reddish-brown iron precipitate (Fe(OH)3). The final sediment is mainly composed of a mixture of CoFe2O4 and Fe3O4. The highest removal efficiency of Co could reach 99.99% (the concentration of Co2+ in the effluent was 0.447 μg L−1) under the optimal reaction conditions. The above electrochemical strategies for recycling of nuclear waste show the advantages of relatively low capital cost, potential for high metal recoveries, suitability for industrial scale applications, and reduced flow path and environmental impact.
In addition to aqueous electrochemical dissolution, molten salt electrolysis has been used to reduce spent oxide nuclear fuel to a metallic form for a closed fuel cycle in combination with a metal-fuel fast reactor.149 In the molten-salt electrochemical reduction process, oxide fuels are loaded at the cathode basket in molten Li2O–LiCl salt and are electrochemically reduced to the metal form.150 The reduction of UO2 in the salt phase is caused by two different pathways, including direct reduction (UO2 + 4e− → U + 2O2−) and an electro-lithiothermic reduction assisted by the Li+/Li redox mediation and Li metal produced in the basket (Li+ + e− → Li; UO2 + 4Li → U + 2Li2O). The anode system is one of the decisive factors of the process stability and economics for the U electrochemical recovery. Due to the poor reduction yield and severe carbon contamination of carbon-based anodes and direct dissolution of the Pt anode, boron-doped diamond (BDD) has been tested as an alternative anode in a system rich in O2−. Chen et al.87 reported U-containing metallic/ceramic composites that are being developed to immobilize combined metallic and oxide waste streams generated during electrochemical recycling of used nuclear fuel (at 1650 °C). More than half of the added UO2 is reduced by Zr (UO2 + Zr → U + ZrO2) to form Fe–Zr–U intermetallics. Most of the remaining UO2 reacts with Nd2O3 to form zirconates. However, high-temperature operation may limit its practical applications.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
Efficient electrochemical metal extraction and recovery from industrial wastes are essential for improving sustainability and reducing environmental risks, and contributing to the construction of a sound material cycle. In summary, this article has reviewed the state-of-the-art for a variety of electrochemical processes for various kinds of industrial wastes to meet the criteria of “end-of-waste”. In this system, electrochemical redox mediation plays a crucial role because it involves and promotes not only metal dissolution and deposition processes, but also redox mediation or ROS generation from O2/H2O/additives. On this basis, the rational design of electrochemical processes and optimization principles/directions are presented, including selection of electrode, electrolyte, and electrochemical reactor, and design of suitable redox pairs (e.g. the production of ROS, the sequence of oxidative dissolution and electrodeposition).
The use of a waste-free green electrochemical strategy in extraction processes is especially advantageous for the recycling of highly toxic and high-priced metals to eliminate waste-producing chemical redox reagents. The process of extraction and recovery makes sense only if the cost of recovery is much less than the value of the precious metal or the detoxification can meet environmental restrictions. The current industry of metal recovery and recycling is widely based on metallurgical processes with extreme reaction conditions and a considerable amount of secondary residue/waste being landfilled or discarded. Being environmentally friendly is one of the key advantages of the electrochemical recovery pathway. Green electrochemical processes provided a novel pathway to realize the improvement with the elimination of waste generation, technology innovations, and high extraction/recovery performance therefore becoming inevitable, in which electrochemistry and electrochemical redox mediation are expected to play more important roles than they were in the past.
Meanwhile, electrochemical metal extraction from industrial waste is probably still in infancy and there are some challenges for further investigation of more practical and efficient electrochemical strategies, such as anode passivation, low-concentration target metals, electrode stability, sluggish kinetics, undesired current efficiency, and side-reactions. The above discussion and review provide the following opportunities and more efforts should be made to promote the development of the electrochemical metal extraction process.
(1) Towards coupled green processes. Along with the rapid development of industry, the environmental burden of chemical production is becoming more concerning. Taking into account the whole set of Green Chemistry principles allows for a complete assessment of the environmental impact of metal extraction and recovery processes. The green electrochemical process adopted herein could be coupled together with other green strategies (including upstream and downstream processes), so that the whole process could be in line with the Green Chemistry principles.
(2) Environmental impact evaluation and life cycle assessment. The potential environmental impacts of the electrochemical metal extraction system need to be systematically assessed before industrial-scale application by accounting for the environmental exchanges (emissions, consumption of reagent and energy) over the entire life cycle of the system. Some measures (e.g. automated process control, novel electrode design) would lead to a significant reduction of the environmental burden and offer great potential for optimization. Future research is required to develop cost-effective, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly electrochemical processes, in particular, to achieve the pollution control.
(3) Electrochemical regeneration or extraction with high efficiency. Long processes and complex technologies are needed for the destruction and recovery of spent materials. To achieve industrial material reuse or recycling, highly efficient electrochemical repair/regeneration strategies are preferable in order to shorten the process and lower the cost. Unfortunately, most of the industrial waste cannot be reused at all, which could be considered as a completely abandoned waste. In terms of increasing the efficiency of metal extraction from these waste materials, electrochemical processes are usually mass transport limited, but electrocatalytic processes can circumvent some of these issues. Particularly, strong oxidizing species participating in electrochemical indirect oxidation processes could be produced by highly efficient electrocatalytic processes, which may extend to ozone, persulfates, perphosphates, percarbonates, and periodates.
(4) Emerging energy devices recycle. More attention should be focused on future recycling of the emerging energy devices with improved specific energy, energy density, cost, safety, and grid compatibility, including Li–S batteries, fuel cells, metal–air batteries, solar cells, etc.151 In other words, electrochemical extraction and regeneration of those devices involve electrochemical reactions, and should be considered while being developed in a lab-scale and in commercial applications.
(5) Experience from other metal extraction fields. For example, Li intercalation electrodes and rocking-chair Li ion battery systems were successfully applied in the selective electrochemical extraction of Li from brines,152,153 which may have the potential to be used in the field of valuable metal extraction from industrial wastes with proper adjustment.
(6) Combining energy production and metal extraction. Combining electricity, fuel, and metal extraction from industrial waste aims to develop a novel cost-effective electrochemical system in a single interlinked process. In this way, the co-production of energy and valuable metals will be possible and maybe optimized according to market demands in the future.
