    , Accepted 2nd June 2011First published on 22nd June 2011AbstractIn recent years, considerable efforts have been made to improve the performance of photoactive nanostructured materials for water splitting applications. Herein, we report on the assembly and use of a bacteriorhodopsin (bR)/TiO2 nanotube array hybrid electrode system. Photoanode materials composed of ∼ 7μm long self-ordered and vertically oriented nanotube array of titanium dioxide films were fabricated via the anodization of Ti foil in formamide electrolytes containing NH4F at room temperature followed by sensitization of the electrodes with bR. The stability of bR on the TiO2 surface was found to depend on the pretreatment process of the TiO2 films. Our results demonstrate the opportunity to fabricate fairly stable bR/TiO2 hybrid electrodes that can be used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW/cm2), the hybrid electrodes achieved a photocurrent density of 0.65 mA/cm2 which is a ∼ 50% increase over that measured for pure TiO2 nanotubes (0.43 mA/cm2) fabricated and tested under the same conditions. In the presence of a redox electrolyte, the photocurrent increased to 0.87 mA/cm2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of bR/TiO2 hybrid electrodes in photoelectrochemical water oxidation cells. We believe the proton pumping property of bR can be used in a variety of applications, especially those related to third generation photovoltaic cells.

Broader context
Green and efficient energy technologies are the driving force of a paradigm shift based on how we should power our society. To this end, solar water-splitting to form hydrogen and oxygen is an attractive protocol for the generation of clean fuels. However, it is a challenge to design stable structures that can be used as anodes in the photoelectrochemical cells. In this regard, functionalizing semiconductors with biologically active materials to achieve light-assisted water oxidation is a promising avenue to pursue. Herein, we create the first bR/TiO2 nanotube hybrid photoanode to perform water splitting and generate photocurrent. The bR/TiO2 hybrid photoanode shows a better photoelectrochemical performance than either the TiO2 or bR alone. We believe our bR/TiO2 hybrid photoanode provides a new perspective method for developing versatile bio-photoelectric devices for solar-to-fuel generation. We are very optimistic that optimization of this system and related assemblies could lead to a breakthrough in the field.

1. Introduction
Researchers have been actively trying to transfer solar energy into a fuel for the last 40 years without profound success despite the fact that nature has been doing so for millions of years through photosynthesis. There are two distinct photosynthetic systems in nature: chlorophyll (using electron pump system) and bacteriorhodopsin (using proton pump system).1 Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a natural light activated protein, is found in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarum.2–4 The exceptional stability of bR makes it a potential biomaterial for various applications. bR can absorb sunlight and transform it into electricity which makes it promising for a plethora of applications especially those related to solar energy conversion.5,6 However, the photocurrent of bR-based photovoltaic cells is still limited to the pico-ampere range.7 This is mainly due to the fact that the photocyle of bR takes 15 ms to finish. A shortcut of the photocyle is expected to enhance the proton pumping effect of bR. Recently, we developed a new bR solution-based photoelectrochemical cell that takes advantage of the plasmonic field effect of nanoparticles to modify the photocycle of bR8,9 thereby increasing the duty cycle of proton production by decreasing the photocycle time to 70 μs.10–12 Upon the addition of silver nanoparticles (with a resonance peak in the blue light region), the plasmonic field of the silver nanoparticles was found to significantly enhance the generated photocurrent density up to 25 nA/cm3, 15 times higher than that of pure bR.9 This mechanism was further verified by spectroscopic and kinetic studies.13 Although the plasmonic field enhancement of bR produces a photocurrent that is orders of magnitude higher than the previous reports, it is still not sufficient for realistic applications.
Fujishima and Honda reported the generation of hydrogen gas viawater splitting using TiO2 under UV light irradiation.14 Since then, H2 generation based on various semiconductors has been extensively studied.15 Of particular interest are anodically fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays, which are being widely investigated due to their advantageous properties such as low cost, abundance, stability and vectorial charge transfer.16–25 However, the wide bandgap of this material (3.0 − 3.2 eV) limits its spectral response to the UV region of the light spectrum, which accounts only for less than 5% of the full solar spectrum.26 More efficient visible light utilization would render this material quite attractive for solar energy conversion applications.
The relatively low efficiencies and high costs of first and second generation photovoltaic cells, compared to traditional energy sources, have limited their mainstream use. The third-generation of such cells aims at decreasing the cost while achieving higher efficiency.26 The concept behind this new generation is to use materials that are both nontoxic and highly abundant. The abundant and environmentally friendly bio-conjugated semiconductor hybrid systems seem to be promising as a third generation photoelectrochemical/photovoltaic technology.27 To this end, Grätzel developed chlorophyll-based dye-sensitized solar cells.28,29 In those devices, photo-excited chlorophyll injects electrons into the conduction band of a TiO2 photoanode to power an external load which in turn are being re-introduced into the cell through the use of a redox electrolyte.28,29 However, the majority of the bio-conjugated semiconductor hybrid systems treat biomaterials as dye molecules that absorb visible light and transfer electrons to semiconductors. In addition to extending the absorption to the visible range (intense absorption peak in the range 500–600 nm) and transferring electrons to the photoanode, bR's unique proton pumping characteristic can successfully be applied to solar-driven hydrogen production.1–13
In this work, we create the first bR/TiO2 nanotube hybrid photoanode to perform water splitting and generate photocurrent. The bR/TiO2 hybrid photoanode shows a better photoelectrochemical performance than either the TiO2 or bR alone. A possible mechanism for the observed enhancement of photocurrent has been investigated. The electron transfer property of bR, in the presence of redox electrolyte, is also discussed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication and characterization of TiO2 nanotube arrays
Prior to anodization, pure titanium foil samples (2.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.25 mm) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone followed by a deionized (DI) water rinse. The anodization was performed in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, with the titanium foil as the working electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode, at room temperature (approximately 22 °C) at 20V for 20h in a formamide-based electrolyte containing 0.2M NH4F, 0.1M H3PO4 and 3 vol.% H2O. Agilent E3612A DC power supply was used for potentiostatic anodization. After anodization, the samples were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried under a stream of nitrogen. The as-anodized samples were crystallized by oxygen annealing at 500 °C for 4 h with a heating and cooling rate of 1 °C/min. The morphology of the as-anodized samples was examined using a Zeiss SEM Ultra60 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed on the TiO2 films using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha XPS with an Al anode. Spectra were charge referenced to O 1s at 532 eV. The crystalline phases were detected and identified by a glancing angle X-ray diffractometer (GAXRD) on an X'pert PRO MRD with Copper source.
2.2 
          Sensitization of TiO2 with bR
Native bR in the purple membrane (PM) from Halobacterium Salinarium was prepared by a standard method described by Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius.30 Strain S-9, with a higher PM yield and an absence of carotenoids, was chosen for these experiments. The PM suspension was stored at −10 °C for further use. The bR solutions were light adapted before the measurements. The photo-bleached bR was prepared following the method presented by Oestergel et al.31,32 Briefly, the purple bR was suspended in 1.0 M hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 by 1.0 M NaOH. Light irradiation by a Xe lamp filtered through a Corning filter type 3–66 and 3–67 was then performed. The complete removal of retinal took 4–5 h to accomplish (see supporting information, Fig. S1). The bleached samples were washed with DI water and centrifuged three times at 19,000 g to remove excess NH2OH. Two methods were used to attach bR onto TiO2 surfaces: without a linker and with a linker. Attaching the bR onto the TiO2 without a linker was accomplished by simply immersing the TiO2 thin films into a bR solution and leaving them overnight. The excess bR solution on the TiO2 surface was washed out then the electrode was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. In the other method, the linker used was 3-Mercaptopropionic acid. Here, the TiO2 electrode was first soaked in the 3-Mercaptopropionic acid solution overnight. Then it was cleaned under nitrogen gas, transferred into a bR solution and sonicated for 4 h. The concentration of bR for both methods was 0.1 mM.
2.3 Optical and photoelectrochemical characterization
The optical characterization of the bR/TiO2 films was performed using a Shimadzu UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer UV-3101PC. The photoelectrochemical properties were investigated in 1.0 M citrate buffer of pH7 (Diagnostic Biosystems) using a three-electrode configuration with TiO2 nanotubes as photoanode saturated Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and platinum foil as the counter electrode. A 0.02 M redox electrolyte (Iodolyte AN-50, from Solaronix, Inc. Switzerland) was added to the citrate buffer for electron transfer experiment. The addition of iodate does not result in any change in the pH of the test electrolyte. A scanning potentiostat (Solartron, model 1287) was used to measure dark and illuminated currents at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. A 150 W ozone-free xenon arc lamp fitted with an AM 1.5G filter was used as the light source. The incident power intensity of the radiation from the AM 1.5 light was set to 100 mW/cm2.
3. Results and discussions
3.1 Synthesis and structural characterization

Fig. 1 shows the morphology of the anodically fabricated titania nanotube arrays. The tubular structure with nearly uniform wall thickness throughout the length of the tube is evident. The fabricated nanotubes were found to be approximately 7 ± 0.2 μm in length with outer diameters of 140 ± 2 nm and wall thicknesses of 20 ± 2 nm.

After annealing at 500 °C for 4 h in dry oxygen ambient, the pure anatase phase of TiO2 was formed as confirmed by GAXRD measurements (Fig. 2a). XPS analysis was performed (Fig. 2b and 2c) to confirm that formation of oxide is achieved as evidenced by the O1s and Ti2p peaks with the molar ratio Ti/O being close to the stoichiometric proportion. Note also that both Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks are observed with a separation of 5.7 eV, which confirms the presence of Ti4+.17,18 The above characterizations confirm the synthesized TiO2 nanotubes to be highly crystalline anatase.

The main absorption range of native bR in solution phase occurs between 500–600 nm and the maximum absorption peak lies at 568 nm (Fig. 3). Anchoring bR molecules onto a TiO2 surface effectively expands the absorption region of TiO2 from UV to visible light. Herein, we used two different protocols to attach bR to TiO2 and followed the treatment effect on the absorption properties of the resulting bR/TiO2 assembly. In the first protocol, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in a solution containing bR. This method is expected to result in the physisorption of bR onto TiO2 surface where the binding force between bR molecules and TiO2 surface is weak. The random attachment of bR onto the surface of TiO2 results in a broad bR absorption peak that lacks its characteristic band structure (peak 2, Fig. 3). In the other protocol, 3-Mercaptopropionic acid was used as a linker to attach the bR molecules onto the surface of TiO2. In this case, a well-established bR absorption peak was observed (peak 3, Fig. 3). Note also that the absorption intensity of bR improves upon the use of linker molecules.

3.2 
          Proton pumping effect of bR
Upon conducting the photoelectrochemical tests, almost half of the bR anchored onto the TiO2 surface without a linker were lost into the electrolyte solution after several electrochemical runs (see SI, Fig. S2†) and we were left with a patchy electrode surface. However, no noticeable change for the bR molecules attached to TiO2 using linker was observed even after multiple runs. Therefore, the photoelectrochemical measurements are only reported for the samples prepared via anchoring bR to TiO2 using linker.
The photocurrent density-versus-potential measurements are shown in Fig. 4. The maximum obtained photocurrent of pure TiO2 (shown in black) is 0.43 mA/cm2 with a photocurrent onset voltage (VOn) of −0.49 V. When bR molecules are anchored to the TiO2 surface (shown in green), the maximum value of photocurrent jumps to 0.65 mA/cm2 and the VOn is shifted to −0.56 V, i.e. the maximum photocurrent density increases by about 50%. The open-circuit voltage represents the contribution of light toward the minimum voltage needed for the water-splitting potential (1.229V).18 Therefore, it seems that the bR/TiO2 photoanode requires less voltage for water oxidation than the pure TiO2 photoanode. Note that the VB and CB of TiO2 at pH 7 are still straddling the oxidation and reduction potentials of water, i.e. in favorable positions to allow water splitting.33 To explain how bR may enhance the performance of TiO2, it is necessary to describe the processes of photoelectrochemical water-splitting reactions using TiO2 photoanode:34

Absorption of photons by the TiO2 photoanode results in the formation of electron-hole pairs (e−/h+). The photogenerated holes oxidize water and the resulting hydrogen ions migrate to the cathode through the electrolyte. On the other hand, the photogenerated electrons move from photoanode to cathode through the external circuit. Then, reduction of the hydrogen ions by the transferred electrons at the cathode occurs. In a typical TiO2-based photoelectrochemical cell, the only source of protons is the water oxidationvia the photogenerated holes. However, when bR is anchored to the TiO2 surface, bR can provide another channel for proton production as it is a well-known proton pump.1 In our designed cell, the proton pumping process of bR continued with light irradiation and the generated protons drifted from the photoanode to the cathode. Although the exact mechanism by which the proton pumping of bR may enhance the photocurrent is still unknown and under investigation, it might be the fact that proton concentration at the cathode is different from that at the anode results in different local pH environments. It was shown that a bias may be imposed through the existence of two different pH values over the anode and cathode (a chemical bias) thus helping in charge separation and consequently more photocurrent.33 The voltage imposed by the chemical bias was shown to be estimated at room temperature by the pH difference at the anode and cathode as: ΔV = 0.05916 × ΔpH.33 This pH effect was extensively studied by Hubb et al. to investigate the energetics of various nanocrystalline metal oxide/dye couples as a function of pH.35–38 It is worthy to mention that the possibility that bR sensitization method may result in different local pH environments is an important step toward the fabrication of better titania-based water splitting devices.
Additionally, bR is expected to function as a traditional dye in the same way dye molecules act in dye sensitized solar cells, i.e. absorb visible light and help extend the system's absorption capability. The enhanced proton generation and the extended absorption spectrum of bR/TiO2 are expected to improve the hybrid electrode performance.
It may be questioned whether the improvement of the performance of the bR/TiO2 photoanode is due to a structural change or chemical modification of TiO2 during the sample preparation process rather than the addition of bR. Therefore, we designed two experiments show that the proton pumping characteristic and the extended absorption spectrum of bR may be held responsible for the observed enhancement in the hybrid electrode performance. The first experiment uses the same bR/TiO2 sample under the same experimental conditions except a filter is used to cut off the light between 500 to 600 nm for sample irradiation. Note that the unique absorption band of bR lies between 500 and 600 nm (yellow light) and the light in this region is the source for initiating the bR photocycle, i.e. bR could not accomplish the proton pumping process in the absence of such light. The obtained photocurrent under these conditions is shown in red in Fig. 4a. The maximum photocurrent density of bR/TiO2 in the absence of yellow light is 0.47 mA/cm2 and the VOn is −0.50 V. The performance of the bR/TiO2 photoanode in the absence of yellow light is as same as that of the pure TiO2 photoanode (0.43 mA/cm2, −0.49V) indicating the possibility that proton pumping may be considered as a determinant factor in enhancing the electrode performance.
In the other experiment, bleached bR was used instead of native bR. Retinal is in the center of bR and is the component responsible for triggering the bR photocycle after retinal photo-excitation by yellow light. The retinal of bR can be extracted by photo-bleaching resulted in a retinal-free bR which is characterized by the absence of its absorption peak at 568 nm,32 (see Fig. S1). The bleached bR is anchored, under the same conditions as the unbleached (native) version, to the TiO2 surface. No obvious absorption peak in the visible range of bleached bR/TiO2 was observed and the main absorption was shown only in the UV region, characteristic of TiO2. As bR is unable to accomplish proton pumping without retinal, the bleached bR on the TiO2 surface is not expected to increase the concentration of protons even under full light irradiation. The maximum obtained photocurrent density of bleached bR/TiO2 is 0.47 mA/cm2 and the VOn is −0.49 V (Fig. 4b). These values are the same as pure TiO2 indicating no enhancement in the electrode performance. These two experiments suggest that the increased photoelectrical performance of the bR/TiO2 hybrid system can be related, in part, to the proton pumping effect of bR and not surface or structural change of TiO2 photoanode.
As the stability of the hybrid electrode is critical, we studied the change in the photocurrent response over time. The photocurrent response was almost identical over 50 cycles demonstrating the rigid structure of bR/TiO2 photoanode (Fig. 5). To further confirm the stability of the fabricated photoanode, steady state photocurrent measurements were performed at constant applied bias (0.6 VAg/AgCl) over a reasonable long time, see Fig. S3. The photocurrent of pure TiO2 photoanode was constant over the entire time. However, the bR/TiO2 photoanode showed a slight increase in photocurrent with time which might be related to the continuous proton pumping effect of bR over the extended illumination time. These results show that bR/TiO2 hybrid electrodes can be used for many applications because of their high stability and performance.

3.3 
          Electron transfer effect
An open question remains as to whether bR can inject electrons into TiO2 in the same way dyes do in dye-titania system. Recently, Thavasi et al. used bR triple mutant E9Q/E194Q/E204Q (3Glu) to construct an excitonic solar cell and found that 3Glu could help transfer electrons from a redox electrolyte to the anode.39 Lu et al. has also found the trans-membrane protein complex from non-sulfur bacteria (Rb. Sphaeroides) to have the same electron transfer effect.40 Herein, the electron transfer effect of bR has also been investigated in our system by introducing an additional source of electrons to the electrolyte system, i.e.redox electrolyte (iodide/tri-iodide). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of bR were previously determined by surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) to be −3.8 eV and −5.4 eV.41 The energy diagram of bR and TiO2 is shown in Scheme 1. The conduction band (CB) energy of TiO2 is located at −4.2 eV and therefore electron injection from the bR into TiO2 is energetically favorable, see Scheme 1. In the presence of the redox electrolyte (0.02M I−/I3−), the electrons from the redox molecules can be caught by bR molecules which in turn is expected to inject them into the TiO2 surface. The I–V characteristic curve upon the addition of redox electrolyte is shown in Fig. 4a. The maximum photocurrent density is found to be 0.87 mA/cm2 and the VOn is −0.64 V. Compared to the value of bR/TiO2 in the absence of redox electrolyte (maximum photocurrent of 0.65 mA/cm2 and VOn of −0.56V), a 33% increase in the photocurrent was obtained which can be mainly attributed to the electron transfer effect of bR. To insure that the observed increase in photocurrent is not due to the oxidation of iodine, pure TiO2 electrodes were tested in the same electrolyte with and without the addition of the Iodolyte redox couple, see Fig. S4. Similar photocurrent densities were obtained in both cases proving that oxidation of iodine is not contributing to the observed increase in photocurrent upon the use of bR/TiO2 hybrid electrode.

4. Conclusion
Bacteriorhodopsin/TiO2 hybrid electrodes were fabricated by anchoring bR molecules onto the surface of anodically fabricated TiO2 nanotube arrays with and without linkers. When used as photoanodes to split water photoelectrochemically, the bR/TiO2 electrodes anchored with a linker showed increased photoelectrochemical performance compared to pure TiO2. A ∼ 50% increase in the photocurrent density was observed when TiO2 was sensitized with bR. It is proposed that the enhanced photocurrent generation is due to the proton pumping effect of bR. In the presence of a redox electrolyte, the bR/TiO2 photoanode achieved even higher photocurrent. This enhancement is based on the band alignment of the HUMO-LUMO levels of bR compared to the band edge positions of TiO2 in a similar way used in dye-titania systems. The photocurrent response after multiple measurements revealed the high stability of the fabricated hybrid electrode. We believe our bR/TiO2 hybrid photoanode provides a new perspective method for developing versatile bio-photoelectric devices for solar-to-fuel generation. We are very optimistic that optimization of this system and related assemblies could lead to a breakthrough in the field.

Broader context
Green and efficient energy technologies are the driving force of a paradigm shift based on how we should power our society. To this end, solar water-splitting to form hydrogen and oxygen is an attractive protocol for the generation of clean fuels. However, it is a challenge to design stable structures that can be used as anodes in the photoelectrochemical cells. In this regard, functionalizing semiconductors with biologically active materials to achieve light-assisted water oxidation is a promising avenue to pursue. Herein, we create the first bR/TiO2 nanotube hybrid photoanode to perform water splitting and generate photocurrent. The bR/TiO2 hybrid photoanode shows a better photoelectrochemical performance than either the TiO2 or bR alone. We believe our bR/TiO2 hybrid photoanode provides a new perspective method for developing versatile bio-photoelectric devices for solar-to-fuel generation. We are very optimistic that optimization of this system and related assemblies could lead to a breakthrough in the field.
