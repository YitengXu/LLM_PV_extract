    , Accepted 23rd May 2018First published on 24th May 2018AbstractSilver (Ag) nanowires (NWs) are promising building blocks for flexible transparent electrodes, which are key components in fabricating soft electronic devices such as flexible organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Typically, Ag NWs have been synthesized using a polyol method, but it still remains a challenge to produce high-aspect-ratio Ag NWs via a simple and rapid process. In this work, we developed a modified polyol method and newly found that the addition of propylene glycol to ethylene glycol-based polyol synthesis facilitated the growth of Ag NWs, allowing the rapid production of long Ag NWs with high aspect ratios of about 2000 in a high yield (∼90%) within 5 min. Transparent electrodes fabricated with our Ag NWs exhibited performance comparable to that of an indium tin oxide-based electrode. With these Ag NWs, we successfully demonstrated the fabrication of a large-area flexible OLED with dimensions of 30 cm × 15 cm using a roll-to-roll process.
Introduction
A flexible transparent electrode is one of the key components in fabricating soft electronic devices including flexible organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), touchscreens, and organic solar cells.1–6 Although indium tin oxide (ITO) has been widely used as a transparent conducting oxide, its brittleness has limited the application in flexible electrodes.7,8 To date, various nanostructured materials including carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metal nanowires (NWs) have been explored to prepare highly flexible, transparent, and conductive electrodes.9–16 Among these candidates, silver (Ag) NWs have attracted much attention as promising building blocks for flexible transparent electrodes owing to mechanical flexibility and excellent optoelectronic properties of Ag NW films.17–25 High-aspect-ratio Ag NWs can form a percolation network with a relatively low number density of NWs and thus junctions between them that give rise to contact resistance and are therefore desirable for fabricating electrodes with both high electrical conductivity and optical transparency.26,27 Hence, the development of effective strategies for the synthesis and processing of high-aspect-ratio Ag NWs is critical to the implementation of high-performance Ag NW-based flexible transparent electrodes and OLEDs.
Since the first report by the Xia group, the polyol reduction of AgNO3 in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as a polymeric stabilizer has been the most widely used method for the synthesis of Ag NWs.28,29 This method typically employed ethylene glycol (EG) as both a solvent and a reducing agent. Much effort has been devoted to the development of a rapid and high-yield synthetic route to Ag NWs with high aspect ratios.30–39 For instance, the Xia group reported the rapid synthesis of Ag NWs with the addition of CuCl or CuCl2 to EG-based polyol synthesis, which enabled the production of Ag NWs within 1–1.5 h.30 Ko and his co-workers reported a repeated seeded growth method to produce long Ag NWs with high aspect ratios of about 1000–3000, but it required multiple, time-consuming steps.26,31 Microwave-assisted rapid syntheses of Ag NWs have also been reported, but the resulting NWs exhibited relatively low aspect ratios, typically less than 500.32,33 Despite considerable progress in Ag NW synthesis, it still remains a challenging task to produce high-aspect-ratio Ag NWs via a simple and rapid process.
Recently, we have developed a new route to the polyol synthesis of Ag NWs that does not require the use of any organic or polymeric stabilizers, but it took a long period of time for synthesis (∼15 h).40 In this work, we newly found that the addition of propylene glycol (PG) to EG-based polyol synthesis facilitated the growth of Ag NWs, allowing the rapid production of long Ag NWs with high aspect ratios of about 2000 in a high yield (∼90%) within 5 min. The resulting NWs exhibited excellent colloidal stability when they were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with the use of 1,2-dodecanediol (DD) as a stabilizer. By applying these Ag NWs as anode materials, we successfully demonstrated the roll-to-roll production of a large-area flexible OLED with dimensions as large as 30 cm × 15 cm.
Results and discussion
Ag NWs were synthesized by modifying the previously reported PVP-free polyol method, which was based on the use of AgNO3, EG, and trace amounts of Fe(NO3)3 and NaCl. Typically, an EG/PG mixture solution containing AgNO3 and trace amounts of Fe(NO3)3 and NaCl was prepared at room temperature, and then heated at 180 °C for 5 min without stirring (Fig. 1A). The volume ratio of EG to PG was 1:1. The color of the mixture solution changed from transparent yellow to gray during the synthesis (Fig. 1B). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the product revealed the formation of long, pentagonal Ag NWs in high yield (ca. 90%) (Fig. 1C and D). The NWs had an average length of 77 μm, and an average diameter of 40 nm (Fig. 1E and F), and thus aspect ratios of about 2000. Occasionally, Ag NWs longer than 100 μm were observed during SEM analysis (Fig. S1†). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the resulting Ag NWs matched with that of face-centered cubic Ag (JCPDS card no. 04-0783) (Fig. S2†), confirming the formation of metallic Ag NWs. As in the case of previously reported, EG-based synthesis, Ag NWs obtained in this synthesis were grown from AgCl particles that had been formed at very early stages of the synthesis through the reaction between AgNO3 and NaCl (Fig. S3†).40 These AgCl particles provide preferential sites for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of Ag NWs.

The rapid growth of Ag NWs observed in this study was enabled by introducing PG into EG-based polyol synthesis. For a better understanding of the role of PG, we conducted control experiments by varying the ratio of EG to PG under otherwise identical conditions and quantitatively examined the time-dependent conversion of AgNO3 to NWs during the synthesis. To do this, we obtained a calibration curve to determine the concentration of Ag NWs. Fig. 2A shows UV/vis spectra recorded from Ag NW dispersions with different concentrations of NWs, which had been prepared by diluting the highly concentrated Ag NW dispersion in IPA. In the UV/vis spectra, a peak centered at 383 nm is associated with the transverse surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Ag NWs. The intensity of this peak was proportional to the concentration of Ag NWs, from which we were able to obtain a calibration curve for the concentration of Ag NWs with quite good linearity (R2 = 0.999) (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C displays UV/Vis spectra recorded at different stages of the synthesis conducted with an EG:PG ratio of 1:1. The transverse SPR peak of Ag NWs appeared at 3 min, and then rapidly increased in intensity within the next 2 min. From these UV/vis spectra and the calibration curve, we calculated the conversion of AgNO3 to NWs during the synthesis. For the synthesis conducted with the EG:PG ratio of 1:1, a plot of the conversion as a function of time revealed that the conversion rapidly increased after 3 min and reached up to 91% at 5 min (Fig. 2D). In the same manner, we also calculated the conversions for the syntheses that had been conducted with the EG:PG ratio of 3:1 and EG only (Fig. 2D and S4†). In the former and latter cases, the conversions at 5 min were 45% and 24%, respectively, which further increased with time and reached 94% and 75% at 10 min, respectively. Our results clearly show that the addition of PG facilitates the growth of Ag NWs, which may be attributed to a relatively strong reducing power of PG compared to that of EG.41,42 When the synthesis was conducted with only PG, however, we observed the formation of micrometer-sized Ag particles with irregular morphology (Fig. S5†). This observation suggests that further acceleration of the reduction kinetics may lead to the homogeneous nucleation and growth of Ag into irregular particles.

We tested Ag NWs for application in transparent electrodes. Our synthesis does not involve the use of any organic or polymeric stabilizer, and thus yields Ag NWs with bare surfaces, which have relatively low colloidal stability due to the absence of a stabilizing effect provided by surface-capping molecules. We found that the colloidal stability of the as-synthesized Ag NWs can be dramatically increased by introducing DD as a stabilizer, without causing deterioration of the optoelectrical performances of NW electrodes. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis of the DD-stabilized Ag NWs confirmed the adsorption of DD molecules on the NW surface (Fig. 3A). We compared the colloidal stability of bare and DD-stabilized Ag NWs by dispersing them in IPA (0.5 wt%). The bare Ag NWs flocculated in 1 day and eventually precipitated in 7 days, whereas the DD-stabilized Ag NWs exhibited excellent colloidal stability without precipitation even after 7 days (Fig. 3B). These DD-stabilized Ag NWs were deposited on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate using a bar coating method, and then the NW film was subjected to salt-induced welding using an aqueous NaCl solution (10 wt%) and subsequent washing with water. Fig. 3C displays a typical SEM image of an Ag NW network film on a PET substrate, showing the uniform distribution of NWs on the substrate. Fig. 3D shows a plot of transmittance at 550 nm versus sheet resistance for transparent electrodes fabricated with the DD-stabilized Ag NWs. For comparison, we also prepared electrodes using bare Ag NWs under otherwise identical conditions. As can be seen in Fig. 3D, both the electrodes exhibited similar performances. The DD-stabilized Ag NW film exhibited a transmittance of 88.8% at 12.1 Ω sq−1, which was comparable to the performance of a commercial ITO electrode (transmittance of 88.5% at 12.5 Ω sq−1). The absorption and reflection of the DD-stabilized Ag NW film were as low as 1.0 and 11.0%, respectively (Fig. S6†). Our Ag NW electrodes exhibited haze values ranging from 1 to 5% over transmittance ranging from 88 to 98%, which were slightly higher than those of electrodes prepared with commercial Ag NWs with a smaller average diameter of 20 nm (Fig. S7†). Our results clearly show that the introduction of DD as a stabilizer provides an effective way of improving the colloidal stability of Ag NWs while retaining their intrinsic optoelectrical properties.

We first used a DD-stabilized Ag NW electrode (12.1 Ω sq−1 at 88.8% and 550 nm) as an anode for a small-area OLED (2 mm × 2 mm) and compared its performances with that of an OLED fabricated with an ITO electrode (12.5 Ω sq−1 at 88.5% and 550 nm). Fig. 4A shows the basic structure of the OLED fabricated in this study, which consisted of (i) a hole injection layer of 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN), (ii) a hole transport layer of N,N′-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (NPB), (iii) an electron blocking layer of 4,4′,4′′-tri(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA), (iv) an emissive layer of 2-methyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (MADN) doped with 1,6-bis(N-phenyl-p-CN-phenylamino)-pyrenes (pyrene-CN), (v) an electron transport layer of LG201 doped with lithium quinolate (Liq), (vi) an electron injecting layer of Liq, and (vii) a thermally deposited aluminum (Al) cathode. Fig. 4B and C show the current density and luminance characteristics of the OLEDs based on the Ag NWs and ITO electrodes. At 6 V, our Ag NW-based OLED exhibited a current density of 99.6 mA cm−2 and luminance of 9389.9 cd m−2, which were comparable to the performance of the ITO-based OLED (115.5 mA cm−2 and 9917.6 cd m−2). The luminous current and power efficiencies of our Ag NW-based OLED (9.4 cd A−1 and 6.9 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2, respectively) were comparable to those obtained for the ITO-based OLED (10.0 cd A−1 and 8.3 lm W−1 at 1000 cd m−2), as shown in Fig. 4D and E. Fig. 4F shows a photograph of the Ag NW-based OLED under bending, illustrating its flexibility.

We also successfully fabricated a large-area flexible OLED using a roll-to-roll process (Fig. 5A). In the first step, a large-area planarized Ag NW electrode on a PET substrate was prepared with the use of a polyimide (PI) film as an Ag NW-carrying substrate (Fig. 5B). The DD-stabilized Ag NWs were coated onto a PI film using a Meyer rod, and then a UV-curable prepolymer resin was dropped onto the Ag NW-PI film surface. This film was laminated with a PET film and then exposed to UV light for curing the resin. After curing, the embedded Ag NW film on the PET film was peeled off from the PI surface to obtain a transparent electrode (Fig. 5C). This embedded Ag NW electrode provides a flat and smooth surface which is enough to fabricate OLEDs without an additional surface planarization process. The embedded Ag NW electrode was pattered using a screen printer (Fig. 5D). Then, OLED layers were deposited directly on the embedded Ag NW electrode using a roll-to-roll vacuum deposition process. Fig. 5E and F display the photographs of a flexible OLED with dimensions of 30 cm × 15 cm fabricated by our roll-to-roll process. These results suggest that our Ag NWs prepared from the rapid polyol synthesis are promising alternatives to the brittle ITO for the fabrication of large-area flexible displays and lighting devices.

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a rapid and high-yield synthetic route to Ag NWs. It was found that the addition of PG to the EG-based polyol reduction of AgNO3 in the presence of trace amounts of NaCl and Fe(NO3)3 greatly facilitated the growth of Ag NWs. The colloidal stability of the as-synthesized Ag NWs with bare surfaces could be improved by introducing DD as a stabilizer. The transparent electrode prepared using our DD-stabilized Ag NWs showed performance comparable to that of a commercial ITO electrode and was applied as an anode for OLEDs. Furthermore, a large-area flexible OLED (30 cm × 15 cm) was successfully demonstrated using a roll-to-roll process. Our strategy is expected to be particularly useful for the high-throughput production of high-aspect-ratio Ag NWs.
Experimental
Synthesis of Ag NWs
In a typical synthesis of Ag NWs, 4 mL of PG (Samchun) was placed in a 22 mL vial at room temperature. Then, 450 μL of 40 mM Fe(NO3)3 (Alfa-Aesar) solution in EG (Samchun), 300 μL of 15.75 mM NaCl (Samchun) solution in EG, and 3.25 mL of EG solution containing 76.5 mg of AgNO3 (Aldrich) were mixed with PG in the vial. The reaction mixture was kept at 180 °C for 5 min without magnetic stirring, and then cooled down to room temperature. The as-synthesized Ag NWs were diluted with IPA containing DD (5 wt%) and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant and residual reagents were discarded. Two cycles of precipitation and redispersion were repeated. Finally, Ag NWs were washed with pure IPA to remove excess DD and then dispersed in 10 mL of IPA.
Fabrication of transparent electrodes
An Ag NW dispersion was coated onto a PET film by using a Meyer rod (no. 20). After coating, the electrode was soaked in an aqueous NaCl solution (10 wt%) for 40 s, and then washed with deionized water.
Fabrication of large-area OLEDs using a roll-to-roll process
An Ag NW dispersion (0.5 wt%) was placed into a moving dispenser, and then coated onto a PI film by a Meyer rod (no. 18) at a constant speed of 1 cm s−1. The Ag NW-coated film was dried at 45 °C with an infrared (IR) dryer. To prepare the Ag NW/PET electrode, a UV-curable resin (NOA63, Norland) was firstly coated onto a PET film by using two rollers. The Ag NW/PI film and the UV-resin-coated PET film were made to face each other and laminated at a pressure of ∼0.6 MPa. The laminated film moved under UV irradiation (wavelength of 360 nm, 5000 mJ cm−2), and the resin was completely cured. After the curing step, PI and PET films were separated. The Ag NWs were fully transferred from the PI film to the PET film in this step. The Ag NW film was patterned with a commercial UV-curable insulator ink (Paron 310 T, Chang Sung Corporation) using a screen printer, and the ink was cured under UV irradiation. The insulator-patterned Ag NW film was placed in a home-made roll-to-roll thermal evaporator and dried in a high vacuum (3 × 10−7 torr) with an IR heater to eliminate moisture in the resin and the PET film. The Ag NW film moved at a constant speed of 5 cm min−1. Organic materials and the cathode metal were deposited on the Ag NW film under 8 × 10−7 torr to fabricate OLED devices. HAT-CN (thickness of 35 nm) and NPB (80 nm) were adopted as a hole injection layer and hole transport material, respectively. TCTA (20 nm) was employed as an electron blocking material. For blue fluorescence emission, MADN and 5% pyrene-CN were exploited as the host and dopant materials (20 nm), respectively. An electron transport layer (LG201, LG Chem. Ltd, 40 nm) doped with 50% Liq, an electron injection layer (Liq, 1.5 nm), and Al (100 nm) cathode were successively deposited. After deposition, the OLED device was then moved from the evaporator to a nitrogen-filled glove box at a moisture concentration under 1 ppm. The fabricated OLEDs were encapsulated with a barrier coating film (FTB3–125, 3 M). The small-area OLED (2 cm × 2 cm) was fabricated with the same structure as that of the large-area OLED, and a roll-to-roll process was not applied.
Characterization
SEM images were obtained by using a SUPRA 55VP instrument (Carl Zeiss). Powder XRD pattern was obtained with a D8-Advance (Bruker AXS) diffractometer equipped with a rotating anode and a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). FT-IR spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS-66/S instrument. UV/vis spectra were recorded using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV/vis spectrometer. The sheet resistance of NW films was measured using a CMT-SR2000N four-point probe measurement system. The OLED performance was measured using a spectroradiometer (CS-2000, Konika Minolta) and source meter (Keithley 2400).
