    , Accepted 28th October 2014First published on 31st October 2014AbstractThe metastable tetragonal Cu2Se phase as nanoflakes has been synthesized for the first time by treating CuCl2 taken in a mixture (1:1) of 1-octadecene and oleylamine with H2N–(CH2)3–SePh dissolved in 1-octadecene. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), HRTEM, SEM-EDX and XPS have been used to authenticate the nanoflakes. The XPS of Cu2Se nanoflakes indicates oxidation states of Cu and Se as +1 and −2 respectively. The size of the majority of Cu2Se nanoflakes was found to be between 12 and 14 nm. The nanoflakes have been explored for Suzuki and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions in the presence of TBAB in DMF and DMSO respectively. For Suzuki coupling conversion was found upto ∼86% in 15 h at 110 °C when loading of Cu was 1 mol%. In case of Sonogashira coupling conversion was found upto 82% in 15 h at 160 °C (Cu loading: 1 mol%). The catalytic efficiency of Cu2Se nanoflakes for Suzuki coupling reaction is greater than that for Sonogashira coupling. These nanoflakes have been found reusable for a second time. Most probably TBAB facilitates the release of CuBr from the nanoflakes which catalyze both reactions, as catalytic efficiency is very low in the absence of TBAB and CuBr has been found to activate readily both the coupling reactions. In comparison to many other copper based nano-crystals, the present nanoflakes are a better activator.
Introduction
Carbon–carbon cross-coupling reactions viz. Heck, Suzuki–Miyaura and the Sonogashira catalyzed with palladium are among the most important protocols, used abundantly in organic syntheses and widely studied in recent decade1,2 as the resulting biaryl and acetylenic products are extremely valuable intermediates. These reactions are key steps in the total synthesis of a large number of natural products, biologically active compounds and a variety of organic building blocks having applications in several fields, such as pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine-chemical industry,3 polymer and materials science.4 Further these three coupling procedures generally involve the use of complexes of phosphine ligands with palladium. The drawbacks of such Pd based catalyst systems are their sensitivity for moisture/air, high cost and toxicity. Therefore, the task of developing palladium and phosphine free catalytic systems is a challenge of current importance. Thus attempts are being made to employ less expensive and toxic transition metal complexes as catalyst.5 Among them, copper-based alternatives are particularly attractive, due to their low cost and harmfulness to the environment.6 Of the various copper based options its salts are not reusable whereas such possibility exists with copper chalcogenides, which have shown potential for efficient solar cells due to their capability of bandgap engineering apart from the advantages of low-temperature synthesis, economical and convenient post-processing.7 Among these chalcogenides, copper selenides are unique8 as they are found in many phases and structural forms with different stoichiometries such as CuSe, Cu2Se, CuSe2, Cu3Se2, Cu5Se4 and Cu7Se4 as well in non-stoichiometric form such as Cu2−xSe. Out of these selenides Cu2Se has attracted considerable attention due to its unique properties like large thermal power, a direct band gap of ∼2.2 eV and superionic conductivity.9 Recently, efforts have been made to synthesize Cu2Se as advanced nano-architectures with different morphologies, including particles, flakes, tubes, cages, and dendrites10 because size, shape and the phase structure have a great impact on the performance of a desired material.11 The Cu2Se is also envisaged as an interesting material as it can be synthesized in various crystallographic forms, monoclinic, cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal and orthorhombic. Among them, the cubic phase is thermodynamically stable while the tetragonal phase is metastable.12
Copper based catalysts (nano-clusters as well as salts) are not unknown for chemical synthesis.13 There are few reports also on the use of copper nanocatalysts/salts for the Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions.14 Rothenberg and co-workers15 have reported copper containing mixed nanocluster catalysts for both Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira cross-coupling. Li et al.16 have reported reusable nano Cu2O–PPh3–TBAB system for cross coupling of aryl and heteroaryl halides with terminal alkynes. They have also reported CuI-DABCO (ligand) catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions in the presence of TBAB. Zhang et al.17 have reported ligand free copper(II) oxide nanoparticle catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions. Basu et al.18 have explored Pd–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in macroporous ion-exchange resins as heterogeneous catalyst for Sonogashira coupling. Miura and co-workers19 have reported CuI-PPh3 as catalyst for Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. Ma and Liu20 have catalyzed coupling reactions of aryl halides with terminal alkynes with CuI-N,N-dimethylglycine.
Monnier et al.21 have used Cu(acac)2-β-diketone system for Sonogashira type cross coupling of aryl iodides with phenyl- and hexylacetylene, which affords disubstituted alkynes in good yield. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of tetragonal Cu2Se nanoflakes and its catalytic properties (probably not of many other nanostructures also) for Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling have not been investigated so far. Thus for the first time, we have designed a synthetic method for Cu2Se nanoflakes and investigated their catalytic applications for Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions. The easy route for the synthesis of Cu2Se tetragonal nanoflakes developed by us is based on 3-(phenylseleno)propylamine (H2N–(CH2)3–SePh) as a selenium source which has been prepared by a slight modification of the method reported in the literature.22 It is reacted with CuCl2 using non-coordinating 1-octadecene (ODE) as solvent and oleylamine as both the reductant for Se and the ligand for the nanostructures. The Cu2Se has been found to catalyze both coupling reaction at 1 mol% (Cu) in the presence of TBAB efficiently and is reusable. These results are described in this paper.
Experimental
Chemicals and reagents
3-Chloropropylamine hydrochloride, diphenyldiselenide, potassium carbonate, caesium carbonate, NaBH4, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB), phenylboronic acid, phenyl acetylene, copper(I) bromide, copper(II) chloride, oleylamine (OAm), 1-octadecene (ODE), 4-bromobenzaldehyde, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, 4-bromo-benzonitrile, 4-bromoaceto-phenone, 4-bromobenzoic acid, bromobenzene and 4-bromotoluene procured from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) were used as such. All solvents (AR grade) viz. toluene, acetone, chloroform, acetonitrile, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol were dried and distilled before use by standard procedures.23 The progress of the catalytic reactions was monitored with 1H NMR spectroscopy. The products obtained in Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling were authenticated by matching their proton NMR spectroscopic data with the literature values.24,25
Physical measurements

1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Spectrospin DPX 300 NMR spectrometer at 300.13, and 75.47 MHz respectively. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the normal standards. All reactions were carried out in an oven dried round bottom flask under ambient conditions. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were carried out on a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiations with scan speed of 1 s and scan step of 0.05°. HRTEM studies were carried out using an instrument TECNAI G2 20 operated at 200 KV to understand nature of nanoparticles and their elemental compositions. The specimens for these studies were prepared by dispersing the powdered sample in toluene by an ultrasonic treatment, placing few drops of dispersed sample on a porous carbon film supported on a copper grid and drying it in air. SEM-EDX studies were carried out using Bruker-AXS Energy Dispersive X-ray System (Model QuanTax 200) for elemental compositions. For X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements a commercial electron energy analyzer (Phoibus 150 from Specs GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and a nonmonochromatic Mg Kα X ray source were used. The 1253.6 eV energy was used to excite photoelectrons.

Synthesis of 3-(phenylseleno)propylamine (L). 
Diphenyldiselenide (0.312 g, 1.0 mmol) dissolved in 30 mL of EtOH was stirred under reflux in N2 atmosphere. Sodium borohydride (0.080 g, 2.0 mmol) was added to it as a solid so that it became colorless due to the formation of PhSeNa. A solution of 3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride (0.520 g, 4 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of EtOH was added to it drop wise with stirring. The resulting mixture was further refluxed for 5 h. Thereafter, it was stirred for overnight at room temperature. After cooling, cold water (30 mL) was poured into it and the mixture extracted with chloroform (4 × 25 mL). The extract was washed with water (3 × 40 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator resulting L as light yellow viscous oil.22


Synthesis of Cu2Se nanoflakes. 
Copper(II) chloride (1.0 mmol) was added to oleylamine and ODE (5 mL each) taken in a flask and the mixture heated for 1 h at 80 °C on a Schlenk line under nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter, temperature was increased to 250–280 °C and a suspension of 3-(phenylseleno)propylamine, (0.5 mmol) made in 1 mL of ODE was quickly injected with a syringe. The temperature was allowed to rise to the pre-injection level. The reaction after injection was continued for 30 min. Thereafter the reaction flask was cooled rapidly to room temperature and 5 mL of toluene added. The crude product was separated by centrifugation at 5680 rpm for several minutes. The crude product was washed with methanol (20 mL) for 3 times to remove the byproducts. Finally, the product was dried and stored in vacuo.

General procedure for catalysis of Suzuki Miyaura and Sonogashira cross coupling reaction
Aryl bromide (1 mmol), phenylboronic acid/phenylacetylene (1.2 mmol), K2CO3 (2.0 mmol), DMF/DMSO (2 mL) and nanoflakes (equivalent to 1 mol% of Cu) and 1 mmol of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) were taken in a round bottom flask, which was placed on an oil bath under anaerobic condition at 110/160 °C respectively for Suzuki/Sonogashira coupling reactions. The mixture was stirred and the progress of reaction was monitored with TLC. When maximum conversion of ArBr into product occurred, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. It was mixed with water (20 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL) respectively for Suzuki/Sonogashira coupling. Organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Its solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator and the product subjected to 1H NMR. In case of impure product, further purification by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate and hexane mixture as an eluent, was carried out and NMR of the purified product recorded.
Results and discussion
An easy route has been developed for the synthesis of Cu2Se nanoflakes by treating a suspension of 3-(phenylseleno)-propylamine with copper(II) chloride, in oleylamine and ODE at 250–280 °C. The present synthesis of Cu2Se avoids the use of toxic, pyrophoric and expensive TOP used earlier.26 The Cu2Se nanoflakes have been characterized with SEM-EDX, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM-EDX pattern of the tetragonal Cu2Se nanoflakes is shown in Fig. S1 of ESI.† Except the small C and O peaks originated from the adsorbed organic capping reagent(s), only Cu and Se peaks are exhibited. The atomic ratios of Cu and Se for the sample was found close to 2:1, implying that nanoflakes are chemically stoichiometric Cu2Se. Its PXRD pattern, shown in Fig. 1 has peaks consistent with those reported for standard tetragonal phase of Cu2Se (space group: P42/n) with the lattice parameters of a = 11.521 and c = 11.740 (JCPDS 29-0575). In Fig. 1 the observed PXRD pattern, given in JCPDS 29-0575 are shown. The matching between the two is good.

On the basis of SEM-EDX and PXRD analysis the presently synthesized sample of Cu2Se is its pure tetragonal phase. The size and shape of the present Cu2Se nanoflakes have been examined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The Fig. 2 showing the HRTEM of the present tetragonal phase of Cu2Se reveals its shape as nanosized flake-like. Fig. 3 shows the size distribution patterns of Cu2Se nanoflakes and their average size as ∼12–13 nm.

To identify the valence states of Cu and Se in the nanoflakes of Cu2Se, XPS measurements were performed on them. The XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the sample only consists of copper and selenium. The Cu 2p spectrum illustrates that the observed values of binding energies for Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks appearing at 932.4 and 952.4 eV are symmetric, narrow, and devoid of satellite. These values of binding energies are consistent with the recent literature report26,27 and indicate the valences of Cu as +127 in the present tetragonal phase of Cu2Se nanoflakes. In Se 3d spectrum, only a single broad peak at 52–57 eV has been observed (Fig. 4(b)). This broad peak of Se 3d spectrum can be fitted with two symmetric peaks assignable to Se 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively (Fig. 4(b)).
 Fig. 4  High-resolution XPS Cu 2p and Se 3d spectra of Cu2Se nanoflakes (a) Cu 2p and (b) Se 3d. 
The binding energies corresponding to these two peaks are 54.4 and 55.2 eV, respectively, characteristic of Se2−.28 In Cu 2p region a small peak (Fig. 4(a)) marked with arrow appears due to some oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+ on the surface of the nanoflakes.28 Similarly in Se 3d region the small peak also pointed out by arrow in Fig. 4(b) probably arise due to oxidation of Se2− ions on the surface of nanoflakes.
Catalysis of Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions
As Cu nanoparticles are known as efficient catalysts for both Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions,14 we have explored Cu2Se nanoflakes as catalysts for both Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions. The reaction between 4-bromobenzaldehyde with phenylboronic acid/phenyl acetylene in the presence of 1 mmol of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) was used for screening of catalysis with Cu2Se nanoflakes. In absence of TBAB the catalytic reaction was very slow. The presence of TBAB improved the conversions in the present ligand-free copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The DMF, DMSO, EtOH and toluene as solvent and K2CO3/Cs2CO3,/Na2PO4 as base have been explored for the two coupling reactions. The catalyst loading was equivalent to 1 mol% of Cu and exploratory reactions were carried out at 100–160 °C for 24 h under N2 atmosphere.
The results given in Tables 1 and 2 exhibit optimum conditions for catalysis with Cu2Se nanoflakes. For Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction at 110 °C under N2 atmosphere (Table 1) the conversions were found ∼89% and 86% in 24 and 15 h respectively using DMF as a solvent, K2CO3 as a base and nanoflakes equivalent to 1 mol% of Cu as a catalyst. In Sonogashira coupling with Cu2Se nanoflakes equivalent to 1 mol% of Cu as a catalyst ∼83% conversion was achieved in 24 h when DMSO as a solvent and K2CO3 as base were used at 160 °C under N2 atmosphere (Table 2). The scope of Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions with Cu2Se nanoflakes as catalyst was investigated using various substrates (Table 3) under optimum conditions spelled in Tables 1 and 2. The performance of Cu2Se nanoflakes has been found slightly better for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling compared to Sonogashira.

Reusability of catalyst
The recyclability of Cu2Se nanoflakes as catalyst (Table 4) was examined for the coupling of 4-bromobenzaldehyde with phenyl boronic acid/phenyl acetylene under N2 atmosphere. In case of Suzuki reaction (carried out with optimized procedure) after complete conversion (91%), the fresh lot of reactants as per standardized procedure was added to the reaction flask along with 1.0 mmol of TBAB and the coupling reaction continued.

After 24 h the conversion of the added reactants was found to be 68%. The reactants were added for third cycle in a similar manner but without additional TBAB. The conversion (Table 4) in 24 h dropped to 19%. The results of similar recyclability experiments carried out for Sonogashira coupling are given in Table 4.
Proposed mechanism
Copper(I) iodide has been reported earlier to catalyze both Suzuki15,16 and Sonogashira coupling16–21 reactions. The catalysis of both the coupling reactions with present nanoflakes is very slow in the absence of TBAB. Therefore it appears that probably copper(I) bromide is a real catalytic species which carries forward the reaction. This is supported by the fact that CuBr (without TBAB) catalyze Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions of 4-bromobenzaldehyde.
Based on the earlier mechanisms14c,19,21 proposed for catalytic activation of the two coupling reactions with copper(I) halides, the catalytic process activated with Cu2Se + TBAB may be envisaged as shown in Schemes 1 and 2 and for Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions respectively.
 Scheme 1  Proposed mechanism of Suzuki coupling with Cu2Se nanoflakes. 
 Scheme 2  Proposed mechanism of Sonogashira coupling with Cu2Se nanoflakes. 
Nanomaterials are effective catalysts for many organic syntheses due to their high surface area and reactive morphologies. They also offer the advantages of easy recovery of products and recyclability of catalyst.29 Copper(I) halides have been more explored for catalytic organic synthesis than nanoparticles containing Cu(I) which are more likely to be air stable and recyclable. Addition of external ligand(s) is a common feature reported in case of their applications in cross-coupling reactions of aryl halide. On the other hand copper(II) oxide nanoparticles have been used under ligand free conditions.30 It is therefore worthwhile to see present catalytic activation with respect to literature reports on other copper containing nano-phases which have catalyzed such coupling reactions. Their number is of course small. Rothenberg et al.15 have utilized heterogeneous catalysis with copper nanoclusters for palladium and phosphine free Sonogashira coupling of phenyl acetylene with aryl halides. Rothenberg et al.15 have also reported Suzuki cross-coupling using Cu and mixed (with Pd/Ru) nanoclusters as catalyst. The 2 mol% of catalyst is needed at temperature similar to ours but good conversion takes longer time than the present catalysts for some substrates. Unlike these nanocatalysts, in the activation with Cu2Se homocoupling of phenylboronic acid does not occur. For substrate p-nitrobromobenzene complication of hydrogenation resulting 4-phenylaminobenzene was found absent in the present case. Zhang et al.16 have reported the combination of Cu2O nanoparticles with several ligands and TBAB as an efficient and reusable system for the Sonogashira coupling of aryl and heteroaryl halides with terminal alkynes under solventless conditions. Out of PPh3, P(o-tol)3, PCy3, P(2,6-diMeC6H4)3, P(n-Bu)3, POPh3, 1,1-bipyridinyl and DABCO explored PPh3 has been found best as ligand. With Cu2Se there is no requirement of external ligand, a distinct advantage. Ranu et al.31 have reported shape-dependent catalytic activity of copper oxide-supported on Pd(0) nanoparticles for Suzuki reactions and found that oval shaped species catalyze Suzuki coupling better. Zhang et al.17 have explored ligand free copper(II) oxide nanoparticle catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions between terminal alkynes and aryl halides. For good conversion 10 mol% of copper(II) oxide nano particles as catalyst have been reported as optimum. The reaction performed for 12 hours in the presence of potassium carbonate as base in dimethyl sulfoxide at 160 °C gives good conversion. The CuI, Cu(phen)(PPh3)Br and copper nanoclusters have been employed in the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction.19,20,32 Okuro et al.19 demonstrated the first copper catalyzed Sonogashira reaction, but the scope was limited to aryl iodides. Even 1.10-phenanthroline was used as a ligand in the Sonogashira coupling reaction catalyzed with Cu(phen)(PPh3)Br or [Cu(phen)(PPh3)2]NO3. Ma and Liu20 have found that CuI combined with N,N-dimethylglycine as a catalytic system can couple the deactivated aryl bromides with terminal alkynes. The reactions conditions with present nanoflakes of Cu2Se are less harsh in comparison to many Cu based catalytic systems reported earlier for Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling. Further the present nanoflakes of Cu2Se are reusable second time. Thus, Cu2Se nanoflakes appear to be an attractive alternative to many palladium and Cu based catalytic systems.
Conclusion
An easy method of synthesis of Cu2Se nanoflakes using organoselenium ligand has been developed. Powder XRD, XPS, SEM-EDX and HRTEM have been used to authenticate the phase of these flakes as tetragonal, which have been successfully applied as a catalyst for Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions of different aryl bromides. The Cu2Se nanoflakes have been found efficient catalyst (1 mol% loading) for both Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira coupling reactions of aryl halides with arylboronic acid and phenylacetylene respectively. The catalytic efficiency of Cu2Se for Suzuki coupling is slightly greater than that of Sonogashira coupling. These nanoflakes have been found reusable for second time. Most probably TBAB facilitates the release of CuBr from nanoflakes which catalyze both reactions, as catalytic efficiency is very low in the absence of TBAB and CuBr has been found to activate readily both the coupling reactions. In comparison to many other copper based nano-crystals, the present nanoflakes are better activator.
