Spectrom., 1994, 9, 213R-247RAtomic Spectrometry Update—Advances in Atomic Absorption and Fluorescence Spectrometry and Related Techniques(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )Steve J. Hill, John B. Dawson, W. John Price, Philip Riby, Ian L. Shuttler and Julian F. TysonAbstractThis review follows on from last year's review (J. Anal At. Spectrom., 1993, 8, 197R) and describes the developments in atomic absorption and atomic fluorescence spectrometry since that time. Included in this review are fundamental processes and instrumentation in the areas of atomic absorption and atomic fluorescence spectrometry together with advances in related techniques such as atomic magneto-optical rotation spectrometry and laser-enhanced ionization. The review of ‘Atomic Emission Spectrometry’ may be found in JAAS, Volume 9, Issue 4. The full references, names and addresses of authors can be readily found from the Atomic Spectrometry Updates References in the relevant issue of JAAS. However, as an additional service to readers an abbreviated form of each reference quoted (except for those of Conference Abstracts) is given at the end of the review. Comments as to possible improvements for future reviews are welcomed by the review coordinator.
