    , Accepted 16th July 2021First published on 19th July 2021AbstractElectroreduction of CO2 to ethanol with high stability and selectivity is vital for resourceful CO2 utilization. The catalyst derived from PANi/CuBi2O4via an electrochemical activation process shows high faraday efficiency (FE) for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol (∼64.15%). Repeated redox reaction generated the evolutionary surface of PANi/CuBi2O4 with Cu0+ and Bi0+ crossed. Owing to the high priority of the adsorbed O-terminal on the introduced Bi, which is located on the Cu surface, the CO2RR pathway for ethylene is suppressed after C–C coupling, making PANi/CuBi2O4 more likely to produce ethanol. With our thorough investigation of the PANi/CuBi2O4 composite system, the agglomerate behaviour of the catalyst in the activation process can be effectively suppressed leading to the high stability and long lifetime of the catalyst. Our findings highlight the importance of local surface evolution by electrochemical pretreatment while retaining the excellent property by stabilizing the main body of the catalyst.
1. Introduction
Excessive CO2 emissions from traditional fossil fuels increase the risks of climate-change-related problems and the global energy crisis.1–3 The efficient storing of energy from variable production sources, such as solar and wind energy, is still challenging.4 The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR), which is an artificial method of carbon recycling,5,6 plays an irreplaceable role in coupling energy storage and CO2 utilization.
More recently, great progress has been made with converting CO2 into C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, etc.).7–9 However, compared to single-carbon products, generally, multi-carbon products, especially ethanol, have higher energy content and economic value.4 Currently, copper-based catalysts are the only transition metal that can convert CO2 into multi-carbon products.10,11 However, it is hard to approach satisfactory C2+ selectivity with metallic Cu and the structure required for specific C2+ products is unclear. Recently, it was found that oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) shows great selectivity for converting CO2 to C2+ products.12–18 More interestingly, the surface of the catalyst on the electrode showed structure evolution due to the applied potential or the approaching of adsorbates,19–21 which facilitate the formation of Cu-based catalysts with special surface structures by a delicately designed electrochemical treatment.22 Hence, making full use of the surface evolution of OD-Cu suggests an elaborate way of constructing catalysts to produce C2+ products with high selectivity.15–17,23 More specifically, under the applied current, the initial morphology of the catalysts can transform into fragmented nanoparticles, which builds an intricate network of grain boundaries and exposes a variety of high-index facets to enhance the C–C coupling.15,16 Unfortunately, there is serious deactivation of the catalyst during the eCO2RR process, which stems from the particle migration and coalescence process,24,25 such as electrochemical Ostwald ripening and agglomeration phenomenon.19,26 Besides, the original characteristics of the initial catalyst, which favored C2+ products in the eCO2RR process, will be lost.1,19,25 Therefore, it is necessary to consider the structure evolution of the catalyst related to the stability of the as-resulted active structure, especially, the realization of a reconstructed surface on a microscopic scale while maintaining the mesoscopic morphology of the catalyst in the process of electrochemical activation.
On the other hand, Cu-based bimetallic or alloying systems, like Cu–Zn,27 Cu2O–ZnO,28,29 Cu–Ag,2 Cu–Pd,30 and Cu–Bi,31 can remarkably increase the selectivity from CO2 to low-carbon alcohols like CH3OH and C2H5OH. As a p-block metal, Bi is typically used as a CO2RR catalyst with high selectivity for formic acid,32–34 which is attributed to its high affinity for the O atom in CO2. We noticed that the preferred O-terminal adsorption of the intermediate is necessary when it goes through the pathway to EtOH.35 Meanwhile, the bimetallic catalyst containing Bi and Cu shows great potential for the conversion of CO2 to ethanol with the synergistic catalysis effect between Cu and Bi.31 Hence, it is of great significance for converting CO2 into ethanol to find a simple way to build the surface of a catalyst with Cu and Bi crossed.
Compositing metal oxide as a template material provides an alternate way to achieve uniform spatial distribution of two metals at the atomic level.36 It is very feasible to use CuBi2O4 as a promising template for constructing bimetal Cu–Bi ensembles or generating structure deformed CuBi2O4, which are constructed from isolated staggered CuO4 plaquettes and connected with BiO4 units.37 The electroreduction method is a mild route to generate bimetal Cu–Bi ensembles and regulate the delicate surface structure as well. However, serious agglomeration, caused by cathodic corrosion38,39 or interaction between the catalyst and intermediates,40,41 is hard to avoid as it need endure electrolytic reduction for a long time. Considering the good stability of conducting polymers during the electroreduction process, polyaniline (PANi) is expected to work as “Orinus thoroldii” (a kind of grass for suppressing sand immobilization) to protect against catalyst agglomeration (Fig. S1†). Besides, PANi is an excellent material for CO2 storage,42,43 as well as for approaching enhanced CO2 activation and C2 hydrocarbon selectivity in the electrochemical CO2RR process.44
Here, we synthesized PANi/CuBi2O4 as a catalyst precursor with a template Cu–Bi bimetal ensemble on the surface. The PANi served as the structure protection and assisted with CO2 activation. The controlled cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique was used for the pretreatment of the catalyst while the surface evolution was observed over the PANi/CuBi2O4 precursor, which generated the arranged Cu–Bi bimetal ensemble on the surface. As a result, our system achieved a high FEethanol with a high ethanol ratio in C2+ products. By elaborating the PANi/CuBi2O4 composite system, the agglomerate behaviour of the catalyst in the activation process can be effectively suppressed due to the as-formed PANi network, leading to its high stability. Furthermore, we found that suitable O-terminal adsorption on the catalyst surface for the intermediate of CO2 could inhibit the C2H4 pathway and increase the selectivity for ethanol. This research showed significant improvement of the catalyst's stability and extended the understanding of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 after C–C coupling.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of Cu2O
Cu2O was synthesized using a method reported in the literature.45 For a typical procedure: 5.0 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 M) was carefully dropped into 50 mL of CuCl2 aqueous solution (0.01 M) at 55 °C. After adequately stirring for 0.5 h, 5.0 ml of ascorbic acid aqueous solution (0.6 M) was slowly dropped into the solution. The mixed solution was continuously stirred at 55 °C for 3 h. The product was collected by centrifugation and decanting, then cleaned with distilled water. Finally, it was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Synthesis of CuBi2O4
CuBi2O4 was synthesized by using the improved hydrothermal method.46 In a typical procedure, 181.9 mg of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was completely dissolved in 20 mL of HNO3 aqueous solution (2.0 vol%), then PVP (0.75 g) was added into the solution under continuous ultrasonication to form solution A. 37.5 mg of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O was fully dissolved in 20 mL deionized water, then dropped into solution A. Then, 20 mL of KOH (2.0 M) was added dropwise into the mixture under continuous stirring for 0.5 h at room temperature. The solution mixture was turned into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and sealed at 150 °C under autogenous pressure for 12 h. The mixture was washed with deionized water multiple times after cooling to room temperature, then finally vacuum dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Synthesis of PANi/CuBi2O4
PANi/CuBi2O4 was synthesized by following the in situ polymerization growth method. Typically, 12.0 mg of fresh aniline, which had been subjected to decompression distillation at 150 °C, was dissolved completely in 20 mL of aqueous ethanol solution (25 vol%). Then, 80 mg of CuBi2O4 was dispersed in the solution and then stirred adequately for 5 h to form the high-spread mixture. Meanwhile, 23.45 mg of ammonium persulfate (APS) was dissolved in 20 mL of hydrochloric acid (0.2 vol%) and added dropwise into the mixture carefully. Specifically, the polymerization reaction needs to proceed at room temperature for 30 min before being quickly transferred to an ice bath (0–5 °C) for 24 h. Subsequently, the product was washed at least five times with ultrapure water and then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h.
2.4 Material characterization
The crystal structures were investigated by XRD using a Rigaku D/max-3C equipped with a graphite monochromator for Cu Kα (40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 1.542 Å) radiation. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and TEM characterizations were carried out using a JSM-7800F and an FEI Talos F200s G2 equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was performed on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD instrument with a monochromatic A1 Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) at a power of 450 W (30 mA, 15 kV). The TGA was performed using a TGA-DSC1 1600LF and the analysis was carried out under N2 with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. TPD was carried out using a TP-5080. The detailed methods are provided in the ESI† (section 1.2).
2.5 Electrochemical measurement
All electrochemical studies were carried out in a gastight H-cell separated by a Nafion-117 membrane. All the electrochemical experiments used an electrochemical workstation and a typical three-electrode system (CHI 760E, Shanghai CH Instruments Co., China). Before each test, the system was purged using high-purity N2 (99.99%) to exclude any dissolved gases. Pure CO2 (99.99%, 6 mL min−1) was then bubbled into the electrolyte for at least 30 min to saturate the 0.1 M KHCO3 (298 K). Detailed information on the electrochemical activation process and electrochemical measurements is provided in the ESI† (section 2).
2.6 Product analysis

Gas products analysis. 
The gaseous products of the electrocatalytic reduction process were collected using gas bags and analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC-1100) equipped with a TCD detector using N2 as the carrier gas for H2 detection, and an FID detector using N2 as the carrier gas for hydrocarbon gas detection. We used a CO gas analyzer (Sensonic 4000) for more precise measurement. The Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of the gaseous products were calculated using the followed equation:  ngas: moles of gas product (mol);

Q: electric quantity (C);

F: Faradaic constant (96485 C mol−1);

z: the number of electrons needed to generate the gas product.


Liquid products analysis. 
The liquid products were analyzed by 1H NMR (Agilent DD2, 600 MHz) in deuteroxide. Typically, 0.8 μL of DMSO (as the internal standard substance) was added to 20 mL of electrolyzed electrolyte and ultrasonicated for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 400 μL of the mixed solution and 110 μL of D2O (as a deuterated reagent) were added to the NMR tube, which was then left to stand overnight to deuterate completely. 600 MHz 1H NMR was then used for analysis and excitation sculpting was used to effectively suppress the water peak.
The FE of the liquid products was calculated using the following equation:  nliquid: moles of liquid product (mol);

Q: electric quantity (C);

F: Faradaic constant (96485 C/mol);

z: the number of electrons needed to generate the liquid product.

2.7 Computational method
The reaction mechanism for C2+ products, especially for the C2H5OH formation, was analyzed based on DFT calculations. All calculations were performed using the DMol3 package.9,47 The DFT semi-core pseudopotential (DSSP) method was employed to treat core electrons, which introduced some degree of relativistic correction into the core. The gradient-corrected functionals (GGA) with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional were adopted to describe the exchange and correlation potential.48 Meanwhile, Grimme's scheme49 was used to deal with the dispersion correction for DFT. The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) was chosen as the atomic orbital basis set. Detailed information is provided in the ESI† (section 4).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of catalyst structure
Cubic Cu2O (Fig. S2†) and CuBi2O4 (Fig. S3 and S4†) were obtained with the optimized synthesis conditions. The PANi/CuBi2O4 was synthesized by in situ polymerization growth method and the synthesis conditions were optimized to obtain the weakest HER (Fig. S5†).
The SEM images showed that the obtained CuBi2O4 had a regular spherical morphology (Fig. 1-1–3a), while the PANi/CuBi2O4 exhibited a hydrangea shape with some PANi nanoparticles attached to the surface (Fig. 1b-1–3). The morphology change is related to the acid etching during the process of PANi growth, which needed protic acid doping (Fig. S7†). The XRD patterns (Fig. 1c) showed that, after loading the PANi nanoparticles on the surface of CuBi2O4 (PDF#71-1774), CuBi2O4 retains a high degree of crystallinity and three new crystalline peaks appeared at 15.2°, 20.7° and 25.2°, which belong to PANi.50 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images for the local structure of PANi/CuBi2O4 (Fig. 1d and e) and the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images with mappings (Fig. 1f–k and S6†) suggested that the surface was laminated (Fig. 1d–k), and it consisted of CuBi2O4 and PANi with the PANi nanoparticles having a diameter of about 5–10 nm (Fig. 1d). These experimental results confirmed that the PANi nanoparticles were successfully grown uniformly on the CuBi2O4 surface.

3.2 Electrocatalytic performance
From the LSV tests (Fig. 2a) with CO2 or N2 as the inlet gas, PANi did not show any electrochemical activity and the CuBi2O4 did not show satisfactory performance for catalyzing CO2RR. However, with the PANi incorporated on the CuBi2O4, the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 was significantly improved. To investigate the charge transport ability of the catalysts, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out at −0.96 V vs. RHE in N2 and CO2 atmosphere (Fig. S8†). Compared with the EIS performance over Cu2O and CuBi2O4, PANi/CuBi2O4 showed the most remarkable decrease in the diameter of the semicircle, which represents the charge transfer resistance, in the Nyquist curves between the atmosphere of CO2 and N2 at the potential of −0.96 V, which indicated that PANi/CuBi2O4 possesses specificity for catalytic reduction reaction of CO2. These results indicated that PANi/CuBi2O4 can significantly inhibit the HER, but obviously facilitates the electrons transmission from the electrode to the dissolved CO2.

The product analysis indicated the splendid catalytic CO2RR ability over PANi/CuBi2O4. Corresponding to the EIS (Fig. S8†) and LSV (Fig. 2a) results, PANi/CuBi2O4 obviously inhibited the HER (FEH2 = 2.04% at −1.16 V). Besides, it presented noteworthy affinity for the C2H5OH formation pathway over the PANi/CuBi2O4 catalyst; the FEethanol reached up to 64.15% (at −0.96 V vs. RHE) with a very high ethanol ratio in C2+ products (FEethanol/FEC2+: 87.05%) (Fig. 2b and S12a†). This behaviour of PANi/CuBi2O4 is clearly different from that of Cu2O, which favored the production of C2H4 (Fig. 2b). Compared to CuBi2O4, PANi/CuBi2O4 achieved a much lower FE of HCOOH (Fig. 2b), which was the major competitor to ethanol, especially at high potential (Fig. S12a†). Compared with the state-of-the-art catalysts for converting CO2 to C2+ products2,27,51–59 (Fig. 2c, Table S4†), the PANi/CuBi2O4 achieved a significantly higher FE for C2+ products and an excellent ratio of C2H5OH in C2+ products, with high stability over 110 h at −0.96 V vs. RHE (Fig. S19†).
3.3 Mechanism research
The intrinsic reasons for the conversion of CO2 to alcohol by catalysis were further investigated. Complex metal oxides could be reduced to multi-metal catalysts after steady state potentiostatic electrolysis under negative potential.36 Hence, a comparative experiment between CuBi2O4-CR (CuBi2O4 reduced by H2 at high temperature) and CuBi2O4-ER (CuBi2O4 reduced by CV activation) was carried out. The LSV tests of these catalysts in different atmospheres indicated that CuBi2O4-ER had much better performance than CuBi2O4-CR for the electroreduction of CO2 (Fig. S13a†). Further analysis by XRD corroborated that, after treating with H2, the CuBi2O4-CR was reduced completely into bimetal Bi–Cu with phase separation (Fig. S13b†), while after the fragmentation of CuBi2O4-ER by CV activation (Fig. S14†), the reduced Cu on the surface presented in amorphous form with high distribution (no signal for Cu in XRD but it appeared in XPS) (Fig. S15†), which provide CuBi2O4-ER with improved electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the electrochemical pretreatment for the metal oxide catalysts accompanied by surface evolution played an essential step in CO2RR.
The essential impact of the electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) on the performance of the CO2RR was taken into consideration. It generally has a huge impact on the performance of the CO2RR,16,19,60 which is often estimated via electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurement.52 Therefore, the Cdl of the catalysts was measured (Fig. 3a). We observed that the Cdl for the PANi/CuBi2O4 was three times that of CuBi2O4, which could be the major reason for the improved current density for converting CO2. Furthermore, comparing the morphology revealed by the SEM images of CuBi2O4 and PANi/CuBi2O4 after electrochemical activation (Fig. 3c-1–3 and d-1–3), the former showed serious agglomeration, which was ascribed to the electrochemical Ostwald ripening phenomenon, and this was responsible for its lower ECSA. In contrast, PANi/CuBi2O4 almost retained its original structure and morphological integrity on the mesoscopic scale, and noticeably a local surface structure evolution occurred on the microscopic surface (Scheme 1a). The XRD results for PANi/CuBi2O4 after CV activation (Fig. 3b) showed strong peaks reflected from CuBi2O4, which confirmed that PANi was loaded on the surface, like “Orinus thoroldii”, and could truly protect the structure and consistency of the catalyst. As expected, with introducing PANi on the surface, PANi/CuBi2O4 could retain the original excellent properties, which could enhance the electrochemical performance and guarantee the stability and lifetime of the catalyst.

PANi as an N-containing polymer could lower the activation energy due to the efficient trapping of gaseous CO2,44,61,62 which feasibly increased the concentration of CO2 approaching the surface of the catalyst to form a “CO2 pool” atmosphere. It would increase the absolute number and relative probability of activated CO2. The CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was used as an experimental validation to explore the chemical absorption ability for CO2 on the surface of the catalyst (Fig. 4a). To exclude changes to the detector signal due to material decomposition, thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) was investigated (Fig. S16†). The results show that PANi/CuBi2O4 was stable up to 600 °C, which meant that all peaks in the plot were dominated by CO2 desorption. As a result, PANi/CuBi2O4 showed the highest desorption temperature (489.0 °C) for CO2 and the largest CO2 chemisorption capacity (35.20 mL g−1) (Fig. 4b). There was a broad peak on the CO2 desorption curve of CuBi2O4, which indicated the alkaline surface property of CuBi2O4 and was favorable for the adsorption of acidic molecular CO2. Consequently, after electrochemical activation, due to the structure-retaining effect resulting from the incorporation of PANi onto the CuBi2O4 surface, the surface of CuBi2O4 is reconstructed, but the main body is retained (Scheme 1b). Then, PANi could work synergistically with the underlying CuBi2O4 to promote adsorption of CO2, endowing PANi/CuBi2O4 with the ability to efficiently activate CO2.

For the pathway of CO2RR to ethanol, the C–C coupling step is deeply affected by the absorption of CO*.35,63–68 It is reasonable that moderate adsorption of CO would be favored for this step.69–74 As an experimental validation, the CO-TPD program showed that PANi/CuBi2O4 has the special ability to adjust the adsorption of CO (Fig. 4c). Compared to the separate pure CuBi2O4 and bimetallic Cu–Bi, it is evident that PANi/CuBi2O4 adsorbed the largest amount of CO with moderate CO adsorptive strength (the CO desorption peak at 373.0 °C and 473.0 °C). Benefiting from the synergistic work between unreduced CuBi2O4 and PANi, the amount and strength of CO adsorption increased to a suitable level on the surface of PANi/CuBi2O4. LSV tests were carried out in CO and N2 atmosphere for the three catalysts (Fig. 4d). Among them, only PANi/CuBi2O4 showed greater current density in CO than that in N2 atmosphere, which meant that PANi/CuBi2O4 could electrochemically activate the adsorbed CO. This was the key factor for PANi/CuBi2O4 to be able to efficiently generate C2+ products.
The product analysis showed that PANi/CuBi2O4 favours the production of ethanol (Fig. 2b), unlike Cu2O, which easily produces ethylene. It is vital to understand the intrinsic mechanism and how it can be tuned to achieve higher FEethanol. With sufficient analysis of the CO2RR mechanism, which had been reported hitherto,35,66–68,75 we would like to propose that the suitable adsorption of the intermediate's O-terminal is indispensable for Cu-based catalysts to be able to produce C2H5OH. This could be related to the specific surface constitution generated after CV activation, which is conducive to adjusting the O-terminal sorption of the intermediate. The surface constitutions of the catalysts derived from PANi/CuBi2O4 before and after CV activation were investigated based on the XPS measurements (Fig. S17 and S18, Table S2†). The results showed that, after CV activation, much of the Cu2+ (∼73.95%) will be reduced to Cu0+ on the surface of the catalyst. Meanwhile, a small amount of Bi3+ (∼6.60%) will be reduced to metal Bi0+, and the ratio of Bi0+/Cu0+ was about 1:5.6 (Table S2†). Accompanied with this surface reconstitution, the O-terminal might prefer to adsorb on the Bi site, which played a positive role in promoting CO2 to generate ethanol after C–C coupling.
To confirm that Bi prefers O-terminal adsorption, we combined the shift of the metal reduction peak during the electrochemical reduction process and the calculation of the adsorption energy to identify the difference in the tendency of C- and O-terminal adsorption on the Bi. For an experimental investigation, three kinds of Bi2O3 were synthesized by different structure inducers and lye environments (detailed description in ESI† (section 1.1.6)). Subsequently, CV tests were carried out under different switching sequences of N2 and CO2 atmospheres (Fig. S20†). For a typical test process, firstly, 50 cycles of CV test were conducted to activate Bi2O3 in a solution filled with N2, the CV curve was recorded under steady state (blue line on Fig. S20a, c and e†). After that, the solution was quickly changed to a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution, and the recurring CV curves were recorded after another 50 CV cycles under continuous CO2 bubbling (red line on Fig. S20a, c and e†). For all three kinds of Bi2O3, the reduction peaks at 0.1 V, representing Bi3+ reduction,76 moved towards more positive potential (Fig. S20a, c and e†). We then converted the order of inlet gas, namely, with the CV test firstly in a CO2 atmosphere but secondly in a N2 atmosphere. Each peak shifted to more negative potential (Fig. S20b, d and f†). When oxygen is adsorbed, the electrode potential will change to positive.77 This phenomenon showed that the Bi truly prefers O-terminal adsorption. This conclusion was further confirmed by conducting the pre-activation firstly in an N2 atmosphere, then gradually introducing CO2 into the electrolyte, corresponding to the gradual increase of the CO2 concentration in the electrolyte, while recording the CV curves on different CV cycles (Fig. 2d). These results showed that as the concentration of CO2 gradually increased, the peak representing the reduction of metal ions gradually shifted to more positive potential, which meant that it was easier to reduce the metal ions to their low-valence state. The XRD results for CuBi2O4 after electrochemical activation (Fig. S15†) showed that the main crystal planes of the generated Bi were [012], [104], [110]. Additionally, the adsorption energies of the oxygen terminal and carbon terminal adsorption modes on these main crystal planes were explored (Fig. S11†). The calculation results indicated that the main crystal plane of Bi, especially, the Bi(012) had the lowest adsorption energy barrier when adsorbing CO2 by O-terminal adsorption. Both the theoretical and the experimental results confirmed that Bi atom has great potential for adjusting the CO2 intermediate by its higher priority for O-terminal adsorption.
Experimental and theoretical evidence has been reported showing that the formation of ethylene and ethanol on the Cu surface both need to go through the ethoxy intermediate (C2H3O*). It is worth noting that the stabilization of the ethoxy intermediate can steer the reaction to ethane or ethanol.52,68,78
To clarify the cooperative catalysis mechanism between Cu and Bi, we synthesized a series of CuO–CuBi2O4-x by changing the feed ratio of Cu(Ac)2 to Bi(NO3)3 (Table S2, Fig. S3†). They were pretreated by the same activation process and the products were analyzed at −0.96 V vs. RHE (Fig. S12b†). With the 35.2% Bi2O3 catalyst, high FEHCOO− was obtained. However, as the CuO content gradually increased, the FEHCOO− was obviously suppressed, and the FEethylene also gradually increased to reach the maximum at CuO–CuBi2O4-D. As the content of CuO increased, the FEethanol was significantly decreased, while the FEacetaldehyde was significantly increased, reaching the maximal value at CuO–CuBi2O4-E. As reported in the literature,35 acetaldehyde is the previous step on the pathway to ethanol and if the CH2CHO* intermediate is stripped easily, the reaction will stop at acetaldehyde rather than ethanol. Therefore, the proper introduction of Bi on the surface of the catalyst can significantly improve the O-terminal adsorption of the CO2 intermediate and increase the selectivity of ethanol.
The mechanism was further verified by the DFT calculation (Fig. 5 and S21 and S22†). As shown in Fig. 5a, on pure Cu(100) crystalline plane, the free energy barrier of the formation of C2H4 (−1.29 eV) was significantly lower than that of C2H4O* (+0.45 eV), which indicated that the transformation of C2H3O* to C2H4 was more favorable thermodynamically. The diagram of Gibbs free energy at −0.96 V bias potential is shown in Fig. 5c. Although the formation of *C2H4O was weakly exergonic, the ΔG of converting C2H3O* to C2H4 was much lower than that without bias potential, which means the ethylene pathway remains the more favorable one. In contrast, when the Bi atom was introduced to the Cu(100) surface, which has special adsorption towards the O-terminal, the formation of C2H3O* became weakly exoergic and the formation of C2H4 became remarkably endergonic, while the free energy barrier was +0.269 eV (Fig. 5b), which indicated that the pathway to C2H4 would be suppressed. Even at −0.96 V bias potential, the free energy barrier of the formation of C2H3O* was still much lower than that for the formation of C2H4 (Fig. 5d). Because of the effect of the potential, the free energy barrier for converting C2H5O* to C2H5OH remarkably decreased, which could promote the formation of ethanol on the surface of Cu(100) with Bi. In conclusion, with the introduction of Bi on Cu (100), the reaction pathway towards ethane is suppressed while the path to ethanol is facilitated (Scheme 1c), which was consistent with the experimental observations.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized PANi-interspersed PANi/CuBi2O4. The catalyst derived from PANi/CuBi2O4 by an electrochemical activation process showed great stability (over 110 h) and high FE for ethanol (∼64.15%). The enhanced stability was ascribed to the introduction of PANi onto the surface of CuBi2O4. As the PANi acts like “Orinus thoroldii”, during the process of electrochemical activation, the catalyst derived from PANi/CuBi2O4 showed great stability and inherited the original properties from the pre-catalyst, which benefited the CO2 activation and C–C coupling. The local surface evolution of PANi/CuBi2O4 by electrochemical activation resulted in most of the Cu2+ (∼73.95%) being converted to Cu0+ but only a small amount of Bi3+ (∼6.60%) was reduced to Bi0+ on the surface. With the high priority for O-terminal adsorption on Bi, the pathway after C–C coupling for ethylene on the surface of the Cu was obviously suppressed, and it was prone to go through the pathway for ethanol, which is the key to converting CO2 to ethanol. This research promotes the understanding of the surface evolution of metal oxides with electrochemical activation and its mechanism to tune the CO2 RR route for high selectivity.
