Compared to the most stable and widely existing triangle prismatic (2H) phase of MoS2, 1T MoS2 possesses distinct electrochemical and electronic properties, such as a high conductivity, abundant active sites both at the edges and on the basal plane for electrochemical catalysis, and enlarged interlayer distance. Due to these merits, the last few years have witnessed a growing amount of interest in both synthesis and application of this unique material. So far, a series of methods have been developed to obtain 1T rich or 1T containing MoS2 and the applications of 1T MoS2 have covered a wide range of areas from electrochemical reactions, photoelectrocatalysis and photodetectors to photothermal agents, energy storage devices, and biosensors. In this article, to obtain a hint of the key reasons for the formation of 1T structured MoS2 and instruct the exploration of more desirable new approaches, the means for fabricating 1T MoS2 that have been reported are carefully classified and compared with a focus on the detailed procedures and the underlying mechanisms. Meanwhile, a full image of the explored applications with 1T MoS2 is provided with an emphasis on the relationship between the properties of 1T MoS2 and the performance and a hope to inspire the development of other potential applications for 1T MoS2. Additionally, the stabilization issue of 1T MoS2 is discussed with a review of the current efforts. The content will be not only helpful for researchers currently working in the related areas but also instructive for the ones new to this field.Shangli ShiShangli Shi is a graduate student at the School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China).

1. Introduction
With their distinct structure and properties, group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are fundamentally and technologically fascinating. As a typical TMD, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which is a traditional solid lubricant and industrial hydrosulfurization catalyst,1,2 has now been intensively studied for usage in electrochemical reactions,3,4 photocatalysis,5,6 solar cells,7,8 supercapacitors,9–12 batteries13,14 and field effect transistors15,16 and so forth.
Depending on the electron filling in the valence d-orbitals of Mo atoms, MoS2 manifests in different polymorphs, including 3R (rhombohedral polymorph with three layers and Mo atoms in trigonal prismatic coordination), 2H (hexagonal with two layers and Mo in trigonal prismatic coordination as well), and 1T (trigonal with one layer and octahedral coordinated Mo atoms), which exhibit diverse optical and electronic properties.17,18 The 3R phase of MoS2, which is the least studied, shows promise in functional integrated photonics due to its intrinsic special nonlinear behavior.19 The most stable polymorph is the 2H phase, being semiconducting. Bulk 2H-MoS2 has an indirect bandgap of 1.29 eV, while the monolayer 2H-MoS2 possesses a direct bandgap of about 1.90 eV.20–22 In contrast, 1T MoS2 is hydrophilic and metallic (107 times more conductive than 2H MoS2).23,24 Therefore, in electrochemical reactions and energy storage applications, the charge transfer resistance is dramatically reduced with 1T MoS2, providing a much superior performance for the 1T phase of MoS2.24–35 The 1T MoS2 nanosheets also exhibited a unique memristive behavior due to their voltage-dependent resistance change while the 2H counterpart only possesses an ohmic feature.36,37 Furthermore, the magnetism of MoS2 could be significantly enhanced as the crystal structure transformed from the 2H into the 1T phase.38 In addition, the properties of metallic and semitransparent 1T MoS2 provide new opportunities for the development of transparent conductors.
Due to the intriguing properties of 1T phase MoS2, a variety of methods have been developed to synthesize 1T phase MoS2 or 1T incorporated 2H MoS2, which can be broadly classified into two main categories, i.e. top-down and bottom-up approaches.39–47 But controlled preparation of metallic phase MoS2, especially that with high purity and stability, is still very challenging. To drive improvements in the currently developed methodologies and inspire further exploration of newly advanced approaches and technologies for the fabrication of 1T MoS2, a systematic study of reported methods is of importance. On the other hand, 1T MoS2 has been studied for application in a variety of fields. Understanding the influences of the 1T structure on the performance of different applications could not only help to understand the properties of the synthesized 1T MoS2, but will also be inspiring for applying this material in new potential applications. Very recently, Huang et al.48 and Lei et al.49 reviewed synthesis approaches for 1T MoS2 and its application in energy conversion and storage. However, their articles summarized the reported methods with limited comparison and explanations. At present, a comprehensive review article on 1T metallic MoS2 is necessary. Herein, the state-of-the-art in the synthesis of 1T MoS2 is fully presented with a focus on the detailed procedures of the methods which are elaborately classified and compared. The reported applications of 1T MoS2 are evaluated in detail as a second major part. Due to the vulnerable nature of the 1T structure toward heating and aging, the stabilization approaches for 1T MoS2 were discussed in the middle section. This review is expected to provide a comprehensive introduction of 1T MoS2 to readers who are interested in this field and, more importantly, to appeal more research efforts for promoting the development of this unique and powerful material.
2. Structures and verification of 1T MoS2
2.1 Structures of 1T MoS2
The distinct cell structures of the 1T and 2H phases of MoS2 are presented in Fig. 1a. 2H MoS2 has two layers joined by weak van der Waals forces, whereas the unit cell of 1T MoS2 has only one-layer with a thickness of 0.6–0.7 nm. The length of the Mo–S bond, the crystal lattice constant, and the distance (between the upper and lower sulfur atoms) are 2.4, 3.2, and 3.1 Å, respectively.50 In both lattices, the Mo atoms are surrounded by six S atoms in sandwiched S–Mo–S layers, where Mo atoms occupy the center positions of the interstices of the S layers. However, while Mo in the 2H lattice coordinated with S atoms in a triangle prism (2 × √3 superstructure), the coordination of Mo with S atoms in the 1T phase is octahedral (√3 × √3) with the S atoms in the upper and lower planes offset from each other, as clearly observed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 1a).51–54 Based on the structures of the two phases, it could be deduced that with a slipping of the S layer, a phase transition between 2H and 1T would take place.55–57

The electronic structure of 1T-MoS2 is similar to that of a metal. As shown in Fig. 1b, no band gap exists in 1T-MoS2 monolayers.58–60 Meanwhile, the energy of the 1T structure of MoS2 is in the range of 1.18 to 1.51 J m−2 (0.7–0.8 eV f.u.−1), comparable to the surface energy of metals such as copper (≈1.73 J m−2) and gold (≈1.48 J m−2).61
2.2 Verification approaches for 1T MoS2
The 1T phase of MoS2 could be characterized by a number of techniques, including XRD, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and STEM. The confirmation of the presence of the metallic phase usually takes a combination of several characterization results.
XRD is a basic characterization technique to evaluate the crystal phase of a sample. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples with 1T MoS2 were usually provided in relevant studies with a comparison to that of 2H bulk MoS2. When MoS2 was not thoroughly exfoliated, the XRD patterns were used to estimate of the size of the obtained multiple-layered MoS2.37 However, in most cases, because 1T-MoS2 was formed in exfoliated MoS2 with single or few layers, the XRD patterns of the samples were very weak with low crystallinity and little information of the 1T octahedral structure, as shown in Fig. 2a.62 For this reason, XRD is just a way to suggest the successful exfoliation of the material rather than identifying the phases, though sometimes the blue shift of the (002) peak could be observed for the expansion of the interlayer spacing.62,63 In fact, the XRD of pure 1T MoS2 crystals has never been experimentally obtained until very recently when Fang et al.64 achieved a single crystal of 1T MoS2 based on a method reported for the first 1T metallic MoS2.55 As illustrated in Fig. 2b, the XRD pattern of the obtained 1T MoS2 crystal, which shows distinctive peaks, matches with the theoretical one (red lines).

The red lines in (b) were calculated from the single crystal structure of 1T MoS2. 
Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive approach to evidently identify the generation of 1T phase MoS2.24 To obtain an evident Raman signal of MoS2, excitation light in the visible light region (such as 488, 532, and 632.8 nm) is commonly used. More importantly, the laser power should be kept low (less than 0.1 mW) to prevent damage to the sample or in situ phase transition. Fig. 2c shows the Raman spectra of pure 2H MoS2 and 2H MoS2 with an incorporated 1T structure from the work of Tong et al.,62 while Fig. 2d shows the Raman spectrum of pure 1T MoS2 crystals.64 The characteristic peaks of 2H MoS2 are located at ∼380 cm−1 (E12g, due to opposite vibration of two S atoms with respect to the Mo atom), ∼404 cm−1 (A1g, associated with the vibration of only S atoms in opposite directions) and ∼454 cm−1 (ascribed to longitudinal acoustic phonon modes). The signature of the 1T structure in the Raman spectrum appears at around 150, 220, 280, 330, and 405 cm−1, corresponding J1, J2, E1g, J3, and A1g modes respectively.64–66 Among them, the E1g band is related to the octahedral coordination of Mo in 1T MoS2.67 As the A1g bands in 1T and 2H are the same, the formation of 1T in 2H are usually judged by the appearance of J1, J2, J3 and E1g modes.24,68 The clear observation of all the characteristic Raman adsorption bands of 1T MoS2 without the characteristic E1g of 2H MoS2 can indicate the high purity of the as-synthesized 1T crystal.
The atomic status of Mo or S in the triangle prismatic structure and that in the octahedral coordination differ from each other and could be reflected by XPS detection with a 0.9 eV difference in their binding energies.23,69 Therefore, Mo 3d and S 2p regions in XPS investigation become popular and probably the only way currently available to estimate the ratios of 1T and 2H polymorphs of MoS2 in a sample. As shown in Fig. 3a,70 in the Mo 4d XPS region, the peaks of Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2 components of 2H MoS2 are present around 229.2 and 232.3 eV (calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV), while the corresponding peaks of Mo in the 1T structure are identified at higher locations around 228.3 and 231.4 eV. The trend is the same in the S 2p XPS area (Fig. 3b).

Furthermore, if 2H and 1T MoS2 nanosheets are highly dispersed in a solution, they show different colors. Therefore, the generation of 1T MoS2 can be distinguished from the optical properties (band gap structure) of the sample. For instance, according to Geng et al.'s work,71 the 2H semiconducting MoS2 nanosheet (S-MoS2) dispersion is green, whereas the dispersion of 1T metallic MoS2 (M-MoS2) is grey (Fig. 3c). Three peaks at ∼442, 613, and 660 nm are present in the UV-vis absorption spectra of S-MoS2. The first one is attributed to the quantum effect of small lateral-sized S-MoS2 nanosheets. The latter two are typical absorption peaks of bulk MoS2 due to the energy split from the valence band spin–orbital coupling in S-MoS2 with large lateral dimensions. In contrast, no salient absorption bands but a monotonic change is found in the spectra of M-MoS2, indicating its metallic properties.
Bulk 2H MoS2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor with an energy gap of ∼1.2 eV.72 Due to quantum confinement, the band gap increases with decreasing crystal thickness below 100 nm.73 When the thickness reaches a single monolayer, the band gap changes to direct with a value of 1.9 eV. This direct band exhibits strong photoluminescence with ∼104 enhancement compared to its multilayer counterpart.20 However, as monolayer 2H MoS2 transforms into the 1T metallic phase, the photoluminescence intensity decreases dramatically because of the missing of the band gap. In light of this, the change in photoluminescence intensity could be effectively used to reflect the phase transition on monolayer MoS2.69Fig. 3d presents the photoluminescence spectra of chemically exfoliated MoS2 with a high percentage of 1T structure after being heated at different temperatures. Before heating, the PL intensity is very low. When the heating temperature increases, a larger amount of the metastable 1T MoS2 converted to 2H MoS2, resulting in higher PL intensities. Besides, the effect of the MoS2 size is also found, namely, the change in PL after heat treatment is much less in thick MoS2 (∼10 nm), where little 1T MoS2 could be observed.
As shown in Fig. 1 and 3e, atomic images obtained from HAADF-STEM are the most obvious evidence for the presence of 1T MoS2, though not in a quantitative way. The structure of MoS2 is clearly revealed in the images with the distances between the atoms measurable. Additionally, in a few reports,23,74 XRAF was also exploited to investigate the local bond lengths and coordination environment of a given element. Fig. 3e(5) and (6) show the oscillation curves of the Mo K-edge in the k range of 0–14.35 Å−1 and the corresponding Fourier transform (FT) profiles in real space. The dramatic difference between the κ2χ(k) of MoS2 with the 1T phase (N-MoS2) and that of 2H-MoS2 (bulk MoS2) implied a remarkable change in the local atomic arrangements. The FT curves clearly show the length of the nearest Mo–S and Mo–Mo bonds in the two sample, which are respectively 2.41 and 3.18 Å for 2H-MoS2. However, the Mo–Mo bond length of 1T MoS2 is only 2.75 Å. This is consistent with the lower distance of the Mo–Mo bond in 1T MoS2 observed in STEM, even though the value is not exactly the same.
3. Synthesis of 1T MoS2
So far, there have been more than a dozen synthesis approaches for 1T MoS2. They can be broadly classified into two main categories, i.e. top-down and bottom-up routes.
3.1 Top-down synthesis of 1T MoS2
Top-down strategies, represented by chemical intercalation of alkali metals followed by exfoliation, are popular to obtain 1T MoS2 nanosheets, or, most of the time, hetero-structured MoS2 with both 1T and 2H phases. Typically, in a top-down synthesis process, the 1T phase of MoS2 is obtained during the exfoliation of bulk 2H MoS2. In some cases, monolayer 2H MoS2 was used as a precursor to allow an in situ transition of the 2H triangle prism to a 1T octahedral lattice by means such as electron beams75 and Ar plasma treatment.76Scheme 1 illustrates most of the currently reported top-down methods that have been implemented for the synthesis of 1T MoS2.

3.1.1 Chemical intercalation exfoliation. 
The layered properties of MoS2 allow its intercalation of organic molecules, alkali metals, and 3D transition metals. The intercalants, which are electron donors, can enter between the layers and finely tune the electron occupation of the relatively narrow ‘d’ bands of the solid.77 Meanwhile, the strain force induced by the electron transfer from the intercalant is very likely to facilitate the phase conversion of MoS2 from 2H to 1T. A number of experimental methods have been developed to intercalate molecules into the host MoS2 lattice. Among them, immersing crystals or powder in a solution of the intercalants is widely used because of its good control of the intercalated amount. Alkali metals (in hexane) are the most effective intercalants to generate a high ratio of 1T MoS2.
Historically, alkali intercalation, i.e. chemical intercalation with alkali metals, was proven as an effective way to drastically manipulate the electronic properties of TMDs in the early 1970s.78–80 However, the structures of the materials after intercalation were not (or could not be) determined until 1983, when Py and Haering81 revealed that the Li intercalation induced a change of Mo coordination from trigonal prismatic (2H) to octahedral (1T) in 2H MoS2via in situ XRD measurements. So far, alkali intercalation exfoliation has become the most prevailing method to obtain thin-layer metallic MoS2.82,83Table 1 lists the conditions that have been adopted for alkali interaction of MoS2 and the properties of the resultant MoS2.

The alkali interaction exfoliation process must be carried out in an atmosphere protected by inert gas (usually in an argon-filled glove box) as the intercalants are highly pyrophoric in air. As a typical procedure,69 MoS2 in powder,69 on graphite substrates,24 on hollow carbon spheres (HCSs)8 or on a plate84 is firstly dispersed into alkali metal source solution, n-butyllithium, for example, and stirred at a certain temperature (usually at room temperature) for a certain time (6–72 h). The lithiation process can be accelerated with the assistance of ultra-sonication and the increase in the intercalation temperature or the concentration of the intercalant solution.24,85 After lithiation, the sample (LixMoS2), if in the powder form,8,69 is retrieved by filtration and washed with hexane or dry heptane24 to remove excess lithium and organic residues. Subsequently (within 30 min to avoid deintercalation), exfoliation is achieved immediately by ultrasonicating LixMoS2 in water for a certain time (usually 1 h), leading to the formation of a large amount of hydrogen and the separation of the layers. Finally, the sample is centrifuged several times to remove the unexfoliated material and excess lithium in the form of LiOH. If the material is on a large substrate,24,84 it is just washed by rinsing, and immersed in water to react with water for exfoliation.
The intercalation mechanism of alkali metals has been elucidated by DFT calculation and in situ TEM investigation.95–100 In general, the process starts with the adsorption of the molecules on the surface (top layer) of the crystal, followed by electron transfer from the alkali atom to the MoS2 layer through the reaction: 2H-MoS2 + xM → MxMoS2 (M represents alkali metals such as Li and Na).83,101 In the meantime, the van der Waals forces between the first two layers are weakened, allowing the penetration of the intercalants down to the next layer.102,103 The content of metal intercalated into the layer, i.e. the x value of MxMoS2, drastically increased the electronic energy in the MoS2 layer, which is crucial to initiate the structural change from 2H to 1T. And the critical electron concentration required for the phase transition increases with the decrease of layer thickness.104 According to the DFT examination, a 2H-to-1T phase transition takes place when x > 0.4 for bulk MoS2,101 while the additional electron concentrations for the mono- and bi-layers are 0.78 and 0.55 e f.u.−1, respectively.104 Also, in situ TEM measurements revealed that the phase transition occurs from 2H-Na0.5MoS2 to 1T-Na0.5MoS2, where the ratio of Mo3+and Mo4+ is 1:1 and inter-valence charge transfer between the two ions should not be neglected.105
As shown in Table 1, several factors, such as the type and the concentration of the intercalants, the intercalation time, temperature, and pre-treatment of MoS2, could exert influence on the properties of the resultant MoS2. n-Butyllithium is the most widely used intercalant.8,23,24,45,51,84–87,89–91,106,107 With n-butyllithium as the intercalating agent, the average concentration of the 1T structure in the obtained MoS2 is around 70% with an average size of several hundred nanometers and, most of the time, monolayers. Several factors affect the ratio of 1T in the exfoliated samples. Increasing the lithiation time from 48 h to 72 h helps increase the ratio of 1T (comparing no. 1 and no. 2 in Table 1) and the intercalation temperature could play a role as well (no. 1 and no. 3 in Table 1). The status of MoS2 for lithiation is also essential. The intercalation seems to be less efficient when the MoS2 precursor is combined with other materials. For example, using MoS2@hollow carbon spheres (no. 4 in Table 1) as the raw material for intercalation, only 47% 1T MoS2 was obtained in the final sample, though the drying process in the follow-up procedure could also affect the 1T percentage.8 Pre-treatments of MoS2 to expand the layers91 or reduce the sizes29 have been proven effective to accelerate the intercalation and exfoliation to obtain a specific form (nanodots) of 1T MoS2. For example, Tan et al.29 showed that with ball-milled MoS2 as the starting MoS2 in the Li intercalation exfoliation process, ultra-small 1T-MoS2 nano-dots of only 2–5 nm could be obtained (Fig. 4a). Yet, systematic experiments are still lacking to illustrate the relationship between these influencing factors and the ratio of the resultant 1T phase.

Other Li-containing compounds have been employed as lithium sources for the intercalation as well. When lithium borohydride (LiBH4) was used, the Li intercalation was achieved by mixing solid LiBH4 with MoS2 powder and keeping at a relatively high temperature (300 °C).92 This led to around 80% 1T MoS2 phase in the as-exfoliated monolayers, which is higher than the average values obtained with wet-phase intercalation exfoliation at room temperature. The mixture of an alkali metal (lithium, potassium, or sodium) and naphthalene in tetrahydrofuran (THF) has also been evaluated as the intercalating solution with pre-expanded bulk MoS2 (no. 9 in Table 1).70 The intercalation process was carried out in an inert atmosphere with an ice-bath, resulting in single-layer MoS2 flakes (>90%) with a size of up to 400 μm2 and ∼70% 1T phase. Recently, a novel liquid-ammonia-assisted lithiation (LAAL) strategy was proposed by Yin et al. to synthesize mesoporous (holey) 1T phase MoS2 NS (P-1T-MoS2), which possessed even more edges and S-vacancies than conventional 1T phase MoS2 and a high stability (Fig. 4b).94 Compared to the commonly used lithiation approach, this method is distinct because of the usage of lithium pieces (with a MoS2:Li molar ratio of 1:5) as the Li source and the addition of liquid ammonia, where the intercalation took place.
Undoubtedly, the chemical intercalation exfoliation method is a very effective way to obtain mono-layer MoS2 with a high percentage of 1T structure and has been used extensively. However, the method itself is of high risk and has to be dealt with very carefully. Though various intercalants have been explored, safer alternatives would be more favorable.


3.1.2 Electrochemical intercalation exfoliation. 
Electrochemical intercalation of alkali metals into MoS2 was explored in Li-ion batteries108 and used for synthesizing 1T metallic MoS2 because of its effectiveness.109,110 Similar to chemical intercalation, 1T MoS2 fabrication via electrochemical intercalation relies on the interaction of alkali metals (Li and Na) with the MoS2 layers and should be followed by further exfoliation in water, i.e. reacting with water. The major difference is that the driving force of electrochemical intercalation could be much higher so that a larger amount of the metal ions could be intercalated into the MoS2 hosts in a shorter time.111 Although not as widely used as the chemical intercalation exfoliation method, the electrochemical intercalation technology shows great advantages in its controllability and efficiency (Table 2). For a typical electrochemical intercalation process, an alkali metal is used as the anode, MoS2 (in slurry) as the cathode, a solution with metal ions as the electrolyte, and a galvanostatic mode applied to drive the reaction (discharge). Using a series of in situ observation methods, the electrochemical intercalation process has been elucidated. An early-stage intermediate phase, 2H Na0.25MoS2 composed of 2 × √3 superstructures, has been observed by in situ TEM.112 By in situ XRD, it was observed that during the discharge process at a current density of 20 mA g−1in a MoS2/Na cell, 2H MoS2 underwent two stages of transitions, namely, from 2H MoS2 to 2H Na0.5MoS2 with a potential plateau of 0.85 V and from 2H Na0.5MoS2 to 1T NaMoS2 with a second plateau of 0.75 V (Fig. 5a).98 Further Na intercalation (NaxMoS2, 1.0 < x < 1.5) led to little structural changes and a reversible phase transition could be implemented after a de-intercalation (recharge) process. However, if more than 1.5 Na per formula MoS2 was inserted (discharging for more than 8 hours), Na2S and metal Mo would form irreversibly.98 The case is the same in electrochemical Li intercalation into MoS2 (Fig. 5b). When the discharge voltage reached 1.0 V, 2–3-layer MoS2 with a large lateral size of several micrometers and 92.5% 1T phase could be obtained. However, further discharging to 0.8 V led to the fragmentation of the MoS2 layers and the formation of Li2S.99,110 Therefore, a careful manipulation of the discharging time or the operating voltage is of great importance for the electrochemical intercalation exfoliation approach to avoid the decomposition of MoS2.

On the other hand, taking advantage of the facile control of the electrochemical parameters, MoS2 in quantum size could be manufactured. Very recently, it has been revealed by Chen et al.111 that the lower the lithiation rate, the higher the x value in LixMoS2 and the smaller the mean size of MoS2. The low intercalation rate was realized by keeping the discharge current density low in a range of 1.0–0.001 A g−1. After lithiation under 0.001 A g−1 and subsequent liquid exfoliation, the bulk 2H MoS2 transformed into quantum-sized MoS2 (3.0–5.4 nm) with a high proportion of the 1T phase (ca. 92–97%). In contrast, only a 2D MoS2 sheet of large lateral size and nonuniform phase distribution was obtained with a large discharge current density (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5d depicts the influence of the discharge current density on the x value in LixMoS2 and the mean size of the obtained MoS2, suggesting clearly that a larger x value and a smaller size could be achieved with a lower current density. During the process, the x value in the intermediate LixMoS2 reached up to 2.0, which was very difficult to be achieved by merely using the chemical intercalation method.113
In addition, typical systems for electrochemical intercalation require operation in a glovebox to avoid the explosion of the alkali metal, which is used as the anode. Ejigu and co-workers innovatively developed a simple and cost-effective approach which could be performed under ambient conditions in a N2 atmosphere.109 In the experiment, an inert Li salt (LiClO4) was used as the lithium source and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode, instead of the potentially explosive materials (such as metallic Li or organolithium compounds). The optimum intercalation was obtained when thin MoS2 pellets (∼1.0–1.5 mm thickness, 12 mm in diameter) without any conducting additives or polymer binders were used as the anode. With a constant applied voltage of −4.5 V vs. Ag wire, the optimum treating time was 2 h, while a longer electrochemical treatment caused the deposition of Li+ onto MoS2 rather than intercalation. Furthermore, LiClO4 (1 M) in a 1:1 v/v mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) was used to form a solid electrolyte interface so that solvent co-intercalation could be prevented. Finally, through exfoliation in deoxygenized DI water and a thorough washing, tri-layer MoS2 with ∼60% 1T phase was harvested. This ratio of 1T MoS2 is less than that attained in the traditional electrochemical intercalation set-ups. But this method is more desirable because of its safety and convenience. Further optimization of the configuration could be carried out to improve this approach.
Electrochemical intercalation exfoliation of MoS2, in fact, is chemical intercalation with an additional electric driving force which makes the intercalation process controllable. However, a major disadvantage of this electrochemical approach is the limited scale where only a minor amount of MoS2 shaped into the electrode can be intercalated.


3.1.3 Supercritical CO2-assisted exfoliation. 
Recently, supercritical (SC) CO2-assisted exfoliation of 2H MoS2 with the simultaneous transition of partial 2H phase to the 1T phase has been reported by Xu and coworkers.115 By this novel approach, 2H and 1T lattice-matching heterostructures of MoS2 with 1–3 layers, ∼70% 1T and a lateral size of 50–150 nm could be obtained. The process was very facile. First, a simple pre-sonication and centrifugation process was carried out to leave out the large sheets and get a dispersion of MoS2 flakes (in 1:1 ethanol/water). Subsequently, the dispersion was treated in SC CO2 (in a stainless autoclave) at 80 °C and 16 MPa under stirring for 6 h. After the gas was released, the sample could be collected immediately. No tedious washing like that in alkali metal intercalation exfoliation was needed. The mechanism was explained as follows: after exfoliating the 2H MoS2 into single or few-layer nanosheets, SC CO2 partially transformed the 2H into the 1T phase and stabilized the 1T phase for a stronger adsorption of CO2 on the 1T structure. Factors like the composition of the precursors, the applied temperature and pressure all influence the properties of the MoS2 finally obtained.116 Specifically, with the introduction of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) which formed micelles within MoS2, the content of 1T MoS2 could be greatly increased up to 90%.62 As illustrated in Fig. 6, when CO2 molecules weaken the van de Waals force between the layers, the hydrophobic properties of PVP facilitate the bending of the CO2 exfoliated MoS2 layers in the CO2/water system. This bending strain played a key role in the transition to 1T from the 2H phase. Furthermore, similar SC CO2 treatments were used to obtain heterostructures containing 1T-MoS2 and other compounds such as h-MoO3 (ref. 117) or graphene,118 suggesting the wide applicability of this approach.

Compared to the chemical and electrochemical intercalation exfoliation methods, the newly developed SC CO2 exfoliation way could attain thin-layer MoS2 with a high percentage of 1T phase. Besides, it shows advantages in its environmental-friendliness, easier manipulation and more tunable parameters. In-depth investigations are expected to understand the underlying phase-changing mechanism and explore the potential of this method. It is also important to find out how different the 1T MoS2 obtained with this method is from those obtained with chemically exfoliated ones, especially when used for specific applications.


3.1.4 Microwave-assisted exfoliation. 
Similar to the SC CO2-assisted exfoliation method, a facile and mild microwave-assisted exfoliation approach was reported by Reshmi et al. for introducing 1T domains into the original 2H lattice of MoS2.119 Instead of using SC CO2 to introduce into the interlayer space of MoS2, this process relies on microwaves to induce structural instability and generate the 1T phase on pristine 2H few-layer MoS2. A 1T–2H hybridized structure with a sharp interface (1T:2H = 7:3) was obtained after treating the MoS2 nanosheets that were pre-exfoliated in 2-propanol and distilled water (ratio of 2:3) by ultra-sonication with microwaves at 175 °C for 30 min. Decreasing the time of microwave treatment to 10 min resulted in MoS2 nanorods with little 1T phase.120 Though this ratio of 1T is not as high as that achieved in the previous methods, the 1T–2H hybridized structure was very stable and could remain intact even when exposed to a 300 keV electron beam, while 2H MoS2 nanorods suffered instant structural damage under the same conditions. And the 1T ratio can be further improved after optimization, such as increasing the treating time or temperature. However, the container that was used for the microwave treatment and some important reaction parameters like pressure or volume were not mentioned in their work. For an in-depth understanding of the 2H-to-1T transition mechanism and a wider application of this facile method, the influence of the reaction parameters should be systematically evaluated.


3.1.5 Mechanical ball-milling. 
As has been mentioned in Section 3.1.1, mechanical ball-milling could be used to pretreat bulk MoS2 and obtain micro-sized MoS2 before a subsequent lithiation–exfoliation process that resulted in quantum dots of 1T MoS2.29 Interestingly, our group found that, only by mechanical ball-milling without any additives or any other additional treatment for several hours, bulk 2H phase MoS2 would partially transform into its 1T polymorph.37 As the milling time increased, the size of MoS2 decreased along with the increase of the 1T phase concentration. After a 10 h milling, the original 2H bulk MoS2 decreased to 15 nm (23 layers) from 54 nm (35 layers) in thickness and 20% 1T phase of MoS2 was identified by XPS measurement. The material showed unique memristive behavior, distinct from the chemical lithiation exfoliation one, which was probably due to the limited percentage of 1T and the difference in sizes.36,37 In spite of the convenience of this method, strategies to increase the amount of 1T phase by this mechanical approach are to be explored and the underlying mechanism for the phase transition is to be further elucidated.


3.1.6 Introducing sulfur vacancies. 
It has been proposed that the 2H-to-1T conversion could also be triggered with the presence of sulfur vacancies (Vs), which could function as electron donors, in the MoS2 layers.68,121–123 One of the means to introduce sulfur vacancies in MoS2 is by gas treatment. As reported by Yang et al.,121 by subjecting the MoS2 layer to Ar treatment (10 mL min−1 at ambient pressure and 200 °C for 30 min), sulfur was depleted within the MoS2 flake, which led to a partial phase transition from 2H (low-spin) to 1T (high-spin) and magnetization of the sample. Similarly, O2 treatment triggered desorption of S atoms and formation of the 1T phase at the edge of MoS2 with a simultaneous generation of a different ordering magnitude in magnetism. The phase transition was verified by XPS and XANES techniques, as presented in Fig. 7. The Mo 4d and S 2p XPS spectra of MoS2 (Fig. 7a) showed the obvious shifts of peaks to a lower band energy after Ar or O2 treatment, with a larger shift of the O2 treated one. This suggests the generation of 1T MoS2 after the gas treatment and a higher percentage of 1T in the O2 treated sample. In terms of the XANES spectra (Fig. 7b), the main feature of the S K-edge XANES at 2472 eV corresponds to an S2− configuration for MoS2. The pre-edge shoulder at 2470 eV fingerprints the presence of Vs, which gradually emerges for Ar-treated samples and reaches a maximum for O2-treated samples. Besides, a sharp and abrupt pre-edge feature is present in the Mo K-edge XANES of the O2-treated samples. All this indicated that O2 treatment exerts a stronger influence on the Vs-driven phase change and electronic modifications of MoS2. However, the exact percentage of 1T in the obtained MoS2 in this work was not given, making it difficult to compare this method with the others.

Reproduced from ref. 132 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Another reported approach to create Vs on MoS2 nanosheets is solvothermal treatment in ethanol.122–124 Usually, a two-step process was exploited (Fig. 7c), i.e. a first hydrothermal step with (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and thiourea (1:30) as precursors to synthesize MoS2, which was claimed to be a pure 2H phase; and a second solvothermal treatment of the MoS2 obtained in the first one. The temperature of the first step was controlled at 200 °C, while the second was at 220 °C. However, the percentage of 1T phase in the final samples (15–25%) harvested was not as high as that obtained by other methods. Nevertheless, synthesizing MoS2 with other materials (such as graphene) followed by solvothermal treatment could increase the 1T ratio to 50%.123
In addition, it has been reported by Wang et al. that by annealing the original 2H MoS2 covered on carbon cloth in NH3 at 800 °C for 3 h, the 1T structure could be implanted into the 2H phase along with the doped N into the MoS2 lattice.125 This conversion of 2H to 1T was also attributed to the formation of the sulfur vacancies created by the doping of N.
As we can see, though various methods have been tried to introduce sulfur vacancies (Vs) on bulk or monolayer MoS2, the 1T product is usually less than 50%. This could probably be due to the limited total number of Vs that could be formed in the lattice. And the extent of uniformity has to be considered as well. Either by exploring new treating strategies or tuning the precursor MoS2, may a higher percentage of 1T MoS2 be generated.


3.1.7 Strain controlling. 
In the past few years, mechanical tensile and compressive strains have been applied to tune the electronic structure (band gap)126,127 of MoS2 layers and strain engineering has also been predicted to change the magnetic properties of MoS2 with vacancies and stabilize the metastable 1T phase from DFT calculations.93,128–130 In fact, all the methods listed above achieved the implantation of 1T into 2H MoS2 or fully transformed the 2H phase into 1T are probably due to the strain force induced by a certain treatment. In this section, the strain controlling approaches that utilize evident physical forces like compressive, tensile or bending forces, introduced either mechanically or chemically, to realize the transformation of the 2H into the 1T structure will be introduced.
Strain induced by pressing with high pressure was reported by Chi et al. to realize the metallization of MoS2.131 In their study, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements of MoS2 were performed at pressures up to 81 GPa in diamond anvil cells. Discontinuous changes in Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns were observed above 20 GPa, providing valid evidence for the isostructural phase transition from 2Hc to 2Ha modification through layer sliding, as previously predicted theoretically. This first-order transition completed around 40 GPa is characterized by a collapse in the c-lattice parameter and volume and also by changes in interlayer bonding. After the phase transition, MoS2 becomes the metallic 1T phase. This compressive force is extremely high, making the method dangerous and hard to realize. The stability and distinct properties of the metallic MoS2 obtained in this way remained to be examined as well as their potential applications.
Compared to mechanically induced compressive force, milder bending force caused by chemical interaction can lead to a phase transition as well. Hwang et al.132,133 rolled up exfoliated 2H MoS2 sheets into nanoscrolls using N-(2-aminoethyl)-3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-amide (LCA), as a self-assembling agent. During the process, due to the interaction between the amine functional groups of LCA and the edges of MoS2 nanosheets, a bending strain was induced (Fig. 7d). This bending strain induced not only the rolling phenomenon, but also the gliding of the S-plane (over a distance equivalent to a = 3.16 Å, occupying the central site of the 2H lattice), leading to the formation of the 1T phase. Furthermore, the obtained 1T phase (∼26%) was very stable due to the layer-by-layer van der Waals interactions. The ratio of 1T MoS2 could be further increased up to ∼58% (at a maximum bending strain of ∼3.2%) after a heating treatment at 200 °C.
Physical string control is a very straightforward way to tune the phase of MoS2 as it realizes the phase change by simply moving the position of the neighbouring layers. Though a high pressure has achieved the non-metallic-to-metallic change for MoS2, the method is not suggested especially when synthesizing 1T MoS2 for chemical applications, such as batteries, catalysis and solar cells. The forces introduced by chemical interactions are more operable. For the SC CO2-assisted and micro-wave assisted exfoliation method, similar strain force could exist as well during the exfoliation process. Relating these methods to each other, we may find some rules for the phase engineering of MoS2 and its analogues.


3.1.8 Electron injection. 
As mentioned above, electron transfer from the lithium to MoS2 layers plays a key role in the 2H-to-1T phase transition during the chemical intercalation process. Recent studies have revealed that electron injections in different forms, including plasmonic hot electron134 and electron beams etc., are all able to trigger this phase transition on mono- or few-layer MoS2.
By depositing nanoparticles with plasmonic adsorption, like Au, a localized 2H to 1T phase transition around the metal sites could be observed on a MoS2 monolayer with the irradiation of the incident laser in the plasmonic range of the corresponding metal nanoparticles.134 This happened because hot electrons generated by plasmon excitation in Au nanoparticles can transfer into the surrounding MoS2 monolayer due to the higher work function of Au (5.1 eV) than that of the MoS2 nanolayer (2.56 eV). Hot electron doping in the MoS2 layer would then be effectively realized as the Schottky barrier between the thin MoS2 layer and Au nanoparticles is lower than 0.8 eV.135 This induces instability in the MoS2 lattice, which is followed by the phase transition from 2H to 1T (Fig. 8a). Similar observations were also obtained for monolayer MoS2 deposited on a periodic array of Au nanostructures with laser irradiation, as reported by Milekhin et al.136 in a tip-enhanced Raman scattering test (Fig. 8b).

More immediately, an electron beam is used to inject electrons onto monolayer MoS2 and cause the phase transition from 2H to 1T in a selected area. According to DFT calculation by Chia et al., subjecting single layer or bulk MoS2 to electrochemical pretreatment below +0.4 V vs. RHE could finely tune the electrochemical and catalytic properties of MoS2 for a partial phase change from 2H to 1T.46 Lin and coworkers monitored a 2H-to-1T phase transition on a 0.6 at% Re doped MoS2 layer (on a Mo quantifoil grid) at 400–700 °C via in situ STEM.75 The electron beam (60 kV, 0.7–1.8 × 107 e nm−2) and the surface conditions, i.e. the doped Re (though with a low doping amount <1 at%), played crucial roles in this dynamic change, whereas the high temperature was just to promote the transition rate. Three important elemental steps for the transitions were categorized: (i) generation of the α-phase as a precursor or an intermediate state, and (ii and iii) migration of the β and γ boundaries. Fig. 8c depicts the area of the transformed phase as a function of total electron dose (in proportion to time). At the initial stage, the α-phase was created as the intermediate structure. Then in the second stage, after the electron reached a high concentration, the phase transition initiated and the transformed area increased with increasing electron dose. By using this electron beam approach, different types of 1T–2H nanodevices could be designed as presented in Fig. 8d.
However, these electron injection approaches are usually applied on a small scale with monolayer MoS2 and these phase transitions induced by the hot electrons or electrons were claimed to be transient and reversible.75,134 They are more suitable for in situ mechanism study rather than for large scale production of 1T-dominated MoS2.


3.1.9 Ar-plasma treatment. 
A novel phase engineering route that could locally induce a 2H-to-1T phase transition on monolayer MoS2 with weak Ar-plasma bombardment has been reported by Jiang and Zhang et al. (Fig. 9a).76 The typical sizes of induced 1T domains are a few nanometers. The method could be used to tune the functionalities of the device with the prepared monolayer MoS2. With the right plasma energy, the process took place very fast. In 40 seconds, the 1T:2H ratio could increase up to ∼40%, as revealed by decreased PL intensity (Fig. 9b) and shifted XPS peaks (Fig. 9c). However, the kinetic energies of the Ar ions should be carefully controlled to allow the sliding of the top S-layer without etching the whole MoS2 layer. In light of this, the phase transition from 2H to 1T using Ar plasma relies on the formation of sulfur vacancies, which stabilize the 1T structure.

On the other hand, this method is similar to the electron beam approach. The specific area where the phase transition takes place is controllable. But its scale is small and only suitable for subtle devices.


3.1.10 Chemical vapor induced phase transition. 
When exposing a MoS2 film to extensive chemical vapors of butylamine (BuAm) or triethylamine (TEA), both of which are strong electron donors, the 2H-to-1T phase transition also occurred as evidenced by an abrupt change of conductance in the sensor device, quenching of the PL peak (Fig. 9d) and the appearance of the 1T-phase MoS2 J1, J2, and J3 Raman peaks.137 However, the XPS spectra of the MoS2 film before and after exposure to chemical vapors were almost the same. Thus it was hypothesized that the transition was localized to small islands in the film rather than forming domains across the majority of the film. Doping of the chemicals had been eliminated as the transitioned device remained stable under vacuum for days and after annealing at a temperature below its transition temperature. This finding not only provides a novel method for identifying chemical compounds, but also develops a new approach for synthesizing 1T MoS2, i.e. using organic chemicals. However, the phase transition mechanism remains vague. Other electron-donating chemicals can be tried to further improve this approach. And it will be more meaningful if bulk MoS2 can be tuned by this method.

3.2 Bottom-up fabrication of 1T-MoS2
Bottom-up means to prepare MoS2 containing the 1T phase involving all the methods that use precursors other than MoS2. Currently, hydrothermal synthesis is the major bottom-up method used for obtaining 1T MoS2. The colloidal process138 and other possible chemical approaches have also been noticed, but have not been applied for the synthesis of 1T MoS2.

3.2.1 The first bottom-up obtained 1T MoS2. 
Wypych and Schöllhorn are the first researchers who prepared 1T-MoS2 using a bottom-up method.55 They started with the synthesis of KMoS2 by reacting K2MoO4 with dry H2S at 320 °C (12 h) and 470 °C (12 h), followed by reduction with 20% H2/N2 at 850 °C for 72 h. After repeated washing until the pH reached 7–8, during which the reaction shown in eqn (1) took place, the suspension was oxidized by oxidants like K2Cr2O7, MeCN–I2etc. or by galvanostatic anodic oxidation in K2SO4 electrolyte (eqn (2)). Finally, after thorough washing and drying, a highly crystallized bronze colored sample was obtained and defined as 1T-MoS2 because of its hexagonal lattice determined from Guinier photographs. KMoS2 + (x + y)H2O → K1−x(H2O)yMoS2 + xKOH + x/2H2(1) K0.33(H2O)0.6MoS2 → MoS2 + 0.33e− + 0.6H20 + 0.33K+(2) Li1−x(H2O)yMoS2 + (1 − x)/2I2 → MoS2 + (1 − x)LiI + yH2O(3)
However, with insufficient evidence and the color of the 1T MoS2 distinct from that observed in recent studies, where the color of metallic MoS2 was dark (dark blue or black),71,115 the purity of the MoS2 is in doubt.
Very recently, using a method based on this chemical reaction approach, Fang et al.64 claimed the synthesis of pure 1T MoS2 single crystals. In their experiments, LiMoS2 was used instead of KMoS2 as the deintercalation of Li ions causes less damage to the crystal structure of 1T MoS2 compared to that caused by the de-intercalation of K ions. I2, in this process, was working as an oxidation agent, as shown in eqn (3). The sharp XRD patterns revealed its crystallinity and the Raman spectrum suggested the absence of the 2H phase (Fig. 2b in Section 2). This research is not only a confirmation for the effective method used by Wypych and Schollhorn two decades ago, but more importantly, it successfully synthesized bulk 1T MoS2 with high crystallinity, which had never been achieved using other methods.


3.2.2 Hydrothermal preparation of 1T MoS2. 
Hydrothermal approaches are common methods for fabricating defective MoS2 and hybrids of MoS2 and other compounds such as graphene.139–141 Recently, facile hydrothermal routes have been widely used to obtain 1T phase MoS2 or hybrids of 2H and 1T MoS2.74 Listed in Table 3 are selections of reported studies on the synthesis of 1T MoS2 through hydrothermal processes. The two-step methods, where the 1T MoS2 was claimed to appear in the second step via sulfur vacancy control, are also included as the formation of the 1T phase in the first step could be highly possible.68,122,123

Pioneering work related to the hydrothermal synthesis of 1T MoS2 was reported just around 2015 and 2016. In early 2015, Cai et al.122 reported the fabrication of MoS2 with sulfur (S) vacancies and 25% incorporated 1T phase with a two-step hydro/solvothermal method. The first step was a hydrothermal process (200 °C for 20 h) with (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and thiourea (1:30 in molar ratio) to obtain 2H MoS2, while the second step was to retreat the obtained MoS2 at 220 °C for 8 h so that S vacancies and the 1T phase could be produced. Before long, ammonium ion intercalated 1T MoS2, which is highly stable in air, was obtained by Liu et al.74 using (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and thiourea at a molecular ratio of 1:15 at 200 °C for 20 h. The obtained material was around 200 nm in lateral size with 3–5 layers and 61.6% 1T phase MoS2. Then, more strikingly, Geng et al.71 found that nearly pure metallic MoS2 could be obtained with octahedral MoO3, thioacetamide (TAA) and urea as the Mo source, S source and weak reducer, respectively, in a hydrothermal process at 200 °C for 12 h. The key was to keep the octahedral structure of MoO3 and to maintain a mild reducing atmosphere. The former required a low pH value, which was controlled at 4 in the experiment, while the latter depended on the hydrothermal temperature and the type of the reducing agent. Once a higher temperature (240 °C, for example) or a stronger reducer like hydrazine was applied, no pure-1T-phase MoS2 could be obtained. Furthermore, the obtained material exhibited a high stability after more-than-90 day storage in water at room temperature. The evolution process of metallic MoS2, as illustrated in Fig. 10a, started with the growth of MoS3, which consisted of metallic MoS2 and S2− bonds. As the MoS3 grew from one cluster to two and finally to a nanosheet, the S2− bonds on the edge were then removed by the urea in the solution, leaving the central structure, i.e. the 1T metallic MoS2.

Following the pioneering work, a series of investigations regarding 1T-phase-involved MoS2 from hydrothermal synthesis have been carried out in the past three years.3,7,43,63,68,123,142–147 The percentage of 1T varies dramatically with different reaction conditions (including the precursors, solutions, temperatures etc.). So far, a group of precursor formulas have been explored. The most commonly used precursors of Mo are molybdates, such as ammonium molybdate68,74,122,145 and sodium molybdate,7,63,123,144,147 while MoCl5,143 MoO3 (ref. 43 and 71) and (NH4)2MoS4 (ref. 43 and 144) have also been applied. Thiourea7,74,122,123,144,147 is the most popular sulfur source while TAA71,143 and L-cysteine63 have been exploited as well. However, the difference between various Mo or S sources for the formation of 1T phase MoS2 has not been systematically elucidated. Only Liu et al.144 compared MoS2 synthesized using two distinct formulas of precursor solutions, i.e. one with Na2MoO4 and thiourea (1:5) dissolved in water and the other with (NH4)2MoS4 in DMF (both treated at 200 °C for 24 h), which produced 16% and 12% 1T-MoS2, respectively. When phosphomolybdic acid pre-treated in a solution with melamine and HNO3 was used as the Mo precursor and thiourea as the sulfur precursor, an ammonia-doped MoS2 nanoflower with ∼71% 1T phase could be obtained after a hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 20 h. Further reduction in H2 for 3 h at 400–600 °C led to the formation of MoS2 with a decreased 1T percentage (43%) but additional defects and sulfur vacancies.148
On the other hand, the temperature-dependent phase transition of MoS2 in the hydrothermal process has been explored by several groups.7,35,71,144 For example, our group found that MoS2 composed of 7.59% 2H-type and 92.41% 1T-type could be uniformly formed on FTO glass by a hydrothermal method with Na2MoO4 and thiourea (1:5) as precursors at 180 °C for 24 h. However, increasing hydrothermal temperature to 200 °C led to the formation of mainly 2H phase MoS2 with only 3% 1T-type.7 This is because the 1T phase is favorably formed at a relative lower temperature as it is intrinsically metastable. In some cases, a two-step process (i.e. a first step hydrothermal process and a second solvothermal treatment with the product obtained in the previous step) was conducted to obtain MoS2 with vacancies and the 1T phase.122,123,145 But the MoS2 collected through the two-step process seems to show an even less ratio of 1T phase compared to the one obtained immediately after the first hydrothermal process.74
Once an appropriate temperature is set, the ratio of the Mo precursor and S precursor needs to be carefully controlled especially when the S precursor functions as an ammonia supplier as well. An excessive amount of NH4+ in the precursors can play a key role in stabilizing 1T phase MoS2. As reported by Liu et al.,74 when changing the precursor from (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and thiourea to Na2MoO4·2H2O and thiourea with the same Mo:S ratio of 1:2.14, a similar 1T sample could not be harvested unless the ratio of Na2MoO4·2H2O and thiourea was adjusted to 1:30.
Morphology controlled synthesis of 1T or 1T-rich MoS2 is achievable in the hydrothermal process by a fine choice of precursors and templates. In most cases, the 1T MoS2 samples obtained by a hydrothermal process are nanosheets and self-assemblies of nanosheets. With the common Mo and S precursors in water or DMF, usually nanoflowers assembled by MoS2 nanosheets were fabricated.7,144,147,148 When MoO3 nanobelts were used as the Mo precursor, hierarchical nanotubular MoS2 composed of nanosheets of 1T MoS2 could be obtained.43 In another case, adding a piece of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) in the autoclave with MoO3, urea and thioacetamine in ethanol could result in the formation of a porous 1T MoS2 nanotube after the template was eliminated by acid.150
Another merit of the hydrothermal method is that through this facile synthesizing route, functionalized groups can be in situ attached onto 1T MoS2. For example, methyl-functionalized 1T@2H hybrid MoS2 was obtained by solvothermally treating the hydrothermal prepared MoS2 in methanol and it exhibited superior cycling stability and rate capability for pseudocapacitive sodium storage.145
Moreover, the hydrothermal bottom-up method enables in situ growth of 1T or 1T–2H hybrid MoS2 on various substrates and formation of heterostructures.3,7,63,143,151 For examples, by a novel solvothermal engineering route as shown in Fig. 10b, Wu et al. synthesized 1T-phase MoS2 nanosheet arrays on activated CFC (1T-MoS2/CFC).63 A 1T-MoS2@CdS heterostructure with 1T-MoS2 slabs of 2 to 5 layers was also obtained by using a mixture of MoCl5, TAA and CdS nanorods in DMF as the precursor suspension.143 On the other hand, the addition of different substrates or other compounds into the hydrothermal precursors also influences the concentration and regulate the growth of 1T phase MoS2.3,147 By adding Fe3O4 into the precursor for synthesizing 1T incorporated MoS2, FeS2 could be doped on MoS2 nanoflowers with the simultaneous formation of 66% 1T-MoS2.147 The presence of graphene oxide (GO) in a two-step hydro/solvothermal method not only resulted in MoS2 uniformly grown on rGO, but also increased the percentage of 1T MoS2 from 15% to 50% as rGO could effectively donate electrons to promote the phase transition.123 Interestingly, according to the report of Yang et al., only 2H MoS2 (syn-MoS2) could be obtained after a solvothermal treatment in DMF at 200 °C with (NH4)2MoS4 as the precursor, whereas by adding 2H MoS2 sonication-exfoliated in DMF into the precursor, 1T MoS2 (vh-MoS2) would self-assemble vertically on the surface of the added 2H MoS2 during the same solvothermal process (Fig. 10c and d).40 Also, recent impressive work demonstrated that by simply mixing pre-dissolved Mo and S precursors (in 10 mL water) with cobalt acetylacetone pre-dissolved in DMF (30 mL) followed by hydro/solvothermal treatment at 200 °C for 24 h, ultra-stable (∼0.75 nm) single layer MoS2 nanosheets vertically aligned in amorphous CoOOH plates (MCSO) could be formed (Fig. 10e and f).152 This structure was distinct from any other work reported before and the method, being extremely simple, would be inspiring for the synthesis of other hybrid materials with novel properties.
Based on the traditional hydrothermal approach, microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment, as a more efficient hydrothermal method has been applied for 1T MoS2 synthesis recently. With Na2MoO4·2H2O. oxalic acid and thiourea as precursors, MoS2 nanoflowers composed of a hybrid of 2H and 1T phases could be harvested after microwave-assisted hydrothermally treated at 220 °C for just 30 min.149 The concentration of 1T MoS2 could be controlled from 40% to 73% by varying the ratio of S and Mo precursors from 3:1 to 7:1 and the sample with the largest amount of 1T phase (73%) was obtained at a S/Mo ratio of 4.25/1.149
The versatility of the hydrothermal bottom-up method allows researchers to obtain 1T-containing MoS2 in different forms. The quality of 1T MoS2 achieved is comparable to those top-down approaches but the procedures are much easier to handle. But it is still a great pity that stable and pure or higher than 90% 1T MoS2 could be hardly obtained except in the case with MoO3, thiourea and urea as precursors. Though the method is controllable with respect to a number of parameters, the formation processes of 1T MoS2 are yet to be understood. Only through an elaborate manipulation of the hydrothermal procedures, may we be able to further improve the purity and quality of 1T MoS2. And this should be based on a clearer understanding of the mechanism how 1T MoS2 is formed hydrothermally.


3.2.3 High-temperature annealing. 
So far, besides the chemical oxidation and hydrothermal methods, few other bottom-up approaches have been reported. By annealing (NH4)2MoS4 and LiOH at over 1000 °C, Chang et al. found that the coordination of Mo changed from triangle prismatic to octahedral with the intercalation of Li in the layers.124 The hydrolysis of the annealed materials generated 1T MoS2. This method is similar to chemical intercalation exfoliation. However, as (NH4)2MoS4 rather than MoS2 was used as the precursor, we classified this method as a bottom-up process. In fact, different types of MoS2, 2H, 3R, and 1T phases of MoS2 could be synthesized at temperatures of <600, >700, and >1000 °C, respectively. Fig. 11a schematically illustrates the 2H and 1T MoS2 obtained at different calcination temperatures after hydrolysis exfoliation. The colloidal suspension of highly monodispersed monolayer 1T MoS2 sheets synthesized was mainly 300 nm−2 μm in lateral dimensions and exhibited a typical thickness of around 0.7 nm. The distinct difference between the as-obtained 1T and 2H MoS2 could be revealed by optical absorbance spectra as shown in Fig. 11b. At a diluted concentration of 0.05 mg mL−1, the 1T-MoS2 sample, which efficiently absorbed light in the full spectral range from 300 to 1200 nm with a monotonic decrease, appeared to be gray, whereas the 2H-MoS2 sample (MoS2-400), which showed obvious absorption peaks in the range of 0–300 m−1, was yellow green in colour. The Mo 4d and S 2s peaks of the sample obtained at 1000 °C indicate a 1T dominant structure with a percentage of nearly 80% (Fig. 11c). However, the yield of 1T phase MoS2 in this annealing process is quite low as MoS2 sublimates easily at high temperatures (>1000 °C), making this method less appealing unless its production could be improved.

3.3 Comparison of the synthesis methods for 1T MoS2

Table 4 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the various synthesis methods for 1T phase MoS2 discussed above. Among the top-down approaches, chemical intercalation with an alkali metal followed by exfoliation in water is the prevailing method to fabricate 1T metallic MoS2. With bulk 2H MoS2 as the starting material, the majority of the resultant product is monolayer MoS2 with a size of several hundred nanometers. The ratio of 1T polymorph in these monolayers commonly reaches 70% and can be optimized up to over 90%. However, the fabrication procedure is dangerous and complicated with required protection of an inert atmosphere and tedious washing. Electrochemical intercalation exfoliation is an advanced type of chemical intercalation exfoliation with additional driving force for enhanced intercalation. Accordingly, the percentage of 1T could increase to as high as 97% and quantum dots of 1T MoS2 are achievable by suitably adjusting the electrochemical parameters. However, though more efficient and highly controllable, this method faces most of the same issues as the chemical exfoliation intercalation and is even more complex as MoS2 has to be shaped as an electrode or deposited on an electrode substrate and placed into a cell device, thus making it difficult for scaling up. Exfoliation in a mixed solution of 2-propanol and water with the assistance of supercritical CO2 or microwave allows the conversion of ∼70% 2H MoS2 to the 1T structure and the value can reach up to over 90% by adding surfactants. The 1T yield is comparable to that from the chemical intercalation exfoliation, but the process is much greener and more facile, showing more promise for further application. Mechanical ball-milling may be the simplest way to generate 1T MoS2 from pristine 2H MoS2. However, the maximum currently reported value for the 1T amount is 20% after 10 h dry milling. The properties of MoS2 obtained through a longer milling time and addition of solvents such as 2-propanol and water would be interesting to investigate. Introducing sulfur vacancies by gas (Ar or O2) or solvothermal treatment induces a relatively low amount of 1T phase but should be more effective for causing the phase transition in monolayer MoS2. Chemically controlling the strain in the MoS2 layer is of interest to obtain 1T MoS2 with different morphologies, but it is seldom explored. Electron injection (such as electron beam and plasmonic hot electron transfer from plasmonic particles) is the most direct way to cause the phase transition. As the electron dose in the monolayer MoS2 reaches a certain amount, the transition could occur. It must be emphasized that monolayer MoS2 is more sensitive to the environment and its structure is very easy to tune. When exposed to Ar plasma or electron-donating chemical vapor, the 2H-to-1T phase transition in monolayer MoS2 could easily take place. The electron injection methods and Ar plasma, which allow an elaborate control of the phase change on monolayer MoS2, are perfect for in situ mechanism study and the design of mini devices. It is also of importance to produce 1T MoS2 in the bulk phase. Among all the top-down approaches, the compressive strain induced metallic MoS2 could be bulk 1T MoS2. However, with limited information, this remains to be confirmed. Reported bottom-up methods for the synthesis of 1T dominant MoS2 are much fewer than top-down approaches. However, the bottom-up process is lower in cost and much easier to handle and scale up. Pure and stable (in water) 1T MoS2 could be prepared with delicate selection of precursors and good control of the hydrothermal conditions. Hybrids of 1T-dominated MoS2 and other compounds for various target applications could be facilely attained by hydrothermal approaches. Besides, 1T MoS2 single crystals, which manifest distinct different properties from their few-layer counterparts, can be fabricated by oxidizing M1−x(H2O)yMoS2 (M = Li, K). Annealing (NH4)2MoS4 and LiOH can realize a 2H-to-1T transition as well with a relatively high 1T ratio in the product, though this process causes a great loss of the precursor due to sublimation.

Further improving the current synthesis strategies and developing new techniques are still in demand for the fabrication of 1T MoS2 with desired amounts, structures and functionalities. Based on the current understanding about the mechanisms of all the developed strategies, a principle can be obtained that the formation to 1T phase MoS2 is strongly dependent on the electron doping in MoS2 layers. Even in the hydrothermal process, the existence of ammonia is essential to donate electrons and stabilize the formed 1T phase. Thus, the design of new approaches to harvest 1T MoS2 could follow this rule. Hybrid approaches and analogous methods to that used for synthesizing other 1T structured TMDs could be exploited. For instance, a colloidal method, which has been utilized for the synthesis of 1T phase WS2 recently138 may also be a feasible way to produce 1T MoS2 with distinct properties.
4. Stabilization of 1T MoS2
Since the metallic 1T phase of MoS2 is metastable, it tends to relax to the stable 2H structure during heating or aging.23,69,154 Fast backward conversion of the 1T phase to 2H could be caused by a simple irradiation of a femtosecond laser 65or infrared laser.66 Furthermore, 1T MoS2 suffers from re-oxidation when exposed to air.91 Therefore, 1T MoS2 is usually kept in water (or other solution) and in an inert atmosphere to suppress the phase transition and re-oxidation.71,155
Alternatively, several strategies can be applied to stabilize the 1T state.156 DFT calculations showed that an exceeding 20% concentration of adsorbed Li atoms can improve the formation of 1T MoS2 more stable than 2H MoS2,157 and the stability of the 1T phase can be greatly enhanced by alloying with SnS2 to form 1T MoxSn1−xS2.158 Even with a little amount of Sn, the formation energy of 1T MoS2 is significantly reduced. As demonstrated by Enyashin et al. via DFT calculations, the existence of other metal atoms such as Re can assist 1T-MoS2 to be more stable as well.159 Re-doping onto the inter layers of double layered nanotubes of 2H-phase MoS2 led to the transformation of its outer layers into 1T allotropes due to the electron donation from the neighboring doped layers. As shown in Fig. 12a, the charge density on the material increased with the doping amount of Re when the x value in 2H-Mo1−xRexS2 was less than 0.8. This charge transfer from Re not only allowed the generation of stabilized 1T MoS2 layers, but also provided enlarged electronic density on the outer walls of the MoS2 nanotubes and thus significantly enhanced the catalytic activities of the nanotubes. Those calculation results provide a theoretical guidance to improve the stability of 1T MoS2.

Experimentally, a few transition metals have been proven effective to stabilize 1T layered disulfides due to their stronger ionic potential and polarizability. Co stabilized metallic 1T MoS2 monolayers with a largely distorted structure (1Td Co-MoS2) were synthesized via a “bottom-up” method.160 With the existence of Co atoms on the surface of S–Mo–S monolayers via Co–S bonds, rather than substituting Mo, the thermal stability of 1T MoS2 was significantly improved as well as its conductivity (Fig. 12b). However, restacked 1T MoS2 nanosheets with intercalated metal ions like Na+, Ca2+, Ni2+, or Co2+, which have been reported to show enhanced catalytic activity in the HER,148 exhibited little change in the stability of the 1T phase probably due to the unchanged or even decreased total charge of the 1T layer.154
Covalent functionalization of the basal sites has emerged to be an effective way to modify the stability of 1T MoS2 recently.161,162 Compared to 2H MoS2 whose basal sites are almost inert, the basal sites on 1T MoS2 are more reactive toward functionalization due to its metallic character.89,163–165 According to DFT calculation results by Tang et al.,164 the adsorption of functional groups (H, CH3, CF3, OCH3, SCH3, and NH2) was very strong on 1T MoS2 and dramatically stabilized this originally metastable phase as the surface coverage increased. As shown in Fig. 13a, with a crossover coverage (∼25%), the 1T polymorph could be even more stable than the 2H phase. However, the band structure of the 1T MoS2 layer changed as well with the coverage of the molecules (Fig. 13b). Therefore, the number of functional groups must be carefully controlled for desirable applications. Using the reaction of the reduced, chemically exfoliated MoS2 with substituted phenyl diazonium salts to form an organosulfur (S–C) bond, Knirsch et al. achieved the functionalization of 1T MoS2 with surface attached methoxybenzene (Fig. 13c).165 While the metallic properties of the 1T phase remained after the treatment, the functional groups inhibited the reverse conversion of 1T to 2H over a month period at room temperature. Besides, by adding 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (BuMeIm) cations in a dispersion of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets (negatively charged), the stability of the 1T-MoS2-type was significantly enhanced, reflected by the increased temperature (from ∼100 °C to ∼170 °C) required for a 1T-back-to-2H transition.166 The enhanced stability was attributed to the bonding interactions between the sulfide sheets and the aliphatic and aromatic fragment in the imidazolium molecules. The electron donating properties of these organic functional groups play an essential role in the stabilization of the 1T structure in MoS2.167

Another technique to ensure the long-time survival of 1T MoS2 is to grow the material on a certain substrate. A composite of 1T MoS2 and TiO2 (TiO2@MoS2), which was formed with MoS2 vertically rooted into rigid one-dimensional TiO2 nanofibers, was stable over a year.168,169 MoS2 was just grown on TiO2 nanofibers by a simple hydrothermal method (220 °C for 24 h) followed by subjecting to exfoliation by Li-ion intercalation in another hydrothermal process (200 °C for 72 h). The high stability of the hetero-structure could be attributed to the induced surface atomic vacancy concentration and strain effect. It was theoretically predicted that when biaxial compressive strain reaches 9%, 1T-MoS2 would be stable without the change in its metallic properties.130
It has to be noted that while these strategies stabilized the 1T structure of MoS2 to different extents, distortion will be inevitably induced at the same time and the properties of the original 1T MoS2 could be tuned and thus performance in a specific application of the stabilized structure could change either positively or negatively. The influences of the stabilization treatment always have to be taken into consideration.
5. Application of 1T MoS2
As mentioned in the introduction part, the traditional lubricant and hydrosulfurization catalyst, MoS2,1,2 has now been widely used in various fields including electro-, photo- and photoelectro-chemical processes,3,5,6,142 photovoltaic,7,8 energy storage and conversion devices10,12,13,170–172 and electronic devices.15,16 As one type of MoS2 with properties distinct from naturally existing 2H MoS2, 1T structured MoS2 has gained research interest in almost all the areas where MoS2 has been studied.
5.1 Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
Exploration of earth abundant materials to replace precious metal electrocatalysts such as Pt has always been the focus of research for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).173 MoS2 has been intensively studied as an electrocatalyst for the HER. Both theoretical174 and experimental30 studies suggested that the active sites of MoS2 were located along its edges. Plenty of effects have been made towards maximizing the active edge sites to improve the HER performance; however the improvements were very limited due to the large ratio of inactive basal plane sites.39,175,176 Alternatively, Lukowski et al. firstly studied the activity of MoS2 with a different type of crystal structure, namely 1T MoS2, derived by lithium intercalation from flowerlike 2H MoS2 nanosheets grown on a graphite substrate via the CVD approach and found a dramatically promoted HER activity with this type of MoS2.24 While the onset of the HER with pristine 2H-MoS2 was near −200 mV vs. RHE, a significant H2 evolution (J = 10 mA cm−2) was observed at −195 mV vs. RHE with 1T MoS2 obtained after 48 h lithium intercalation at 60 °C and a current density of 200 mA cm−2 could be achieved at −400 mV vs. RHE (Fig. 14a and b). After correction for iR losses, an overpotential at J = 10 mA cm−2 (η10) as low as 187 mV vs. RHE was achieved. More apparent enhancement in catalytic activity was revealed by the Tafel plots (Fig. 14c) with 54 mV dec−1 (43 mV dec−1 after iR correction) for 1T-containing MoS2 and 117 mV dec−1 (110 mV dec−1 after iR correction) for pristine MoS2.

Similar phenomena, i.e. the superiority of 1T MoS2 in the HER, were reported later by many other researchers with 1T MoS2 obtained through various phase engineering routes.32,35,40,41,71,85,92 Voiry et al.92 obtained 1T MoS2 exfoliated from 2H MoS2 with a solvent-free intercalation method and achieved a Tafel plot of nearly 40 mV dec−1. By continuously tuning the phase of vertically aligned MoS2 (on mirror polished glassy carbon) from 2H to 1T via electrochemical intercalation of Li+ ions, Wang et al. demonstrated an onset potential (0.1 mA cm−2) of −113 mV, a Tafel slope of 43–47 mV dec−1 and an exchange current density of 0.13–0.25 μA cm−2 with the best sample obtained at a treatment voltage of 1.1 V.32 Incorporation of the 1T phase in 2H MoS2 using a two-step hydrothermal method allowed the improvement of HER activity with changes in Tafel slopes from 105 to 49 mV dec−1 and an η10 from 188 mV to 64 mV.41 This value of η10 was extraordinarily low compared to that of the highly pure and stable 1T MoS2 obtained by Geng et al. via a facile hydrothermal approach, which showed a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1 and an η10 of 175 mV.71 Yang et al. assembled 1T MoS2 on 2H MoS2 nanosheets via a solvothermal approach with pre-sonication-exfoliated 2H MoS2 and (NH4)2MoS4 (η10, 202 mV; Tafel slope, 60 mV dec−1).40 Cracked 1T MoS2 synthesized by sonication-aided lithium intercalation exfoliation with hydrothermally synthesized 2H MoS2 (onset potential, 161 mV; η10, 274 mV; Tafel slope, 75.3 mV dec−1) exhibited an onset potential of −113 mV, an η10 of 156 mV and a Tafel slope of 42.7 mV dec−1.85 1T@2H MoS2 with 90% 1T phase derived from 2H MoS2 treated with super critical CO2 also outperformed 2H MoS2 but it only achieved a Tafel slope of 70 mV dec−1 and an η10 of 330 mV, and the sample showed <12% decay in electrocatalytic current density after 1000 cycles of continuous operation.62 As seen in the above-mentioned studies, the performance of the 1T-containing MoS2 HER electrode varied from one to another. The influencing factors include the different properties of MoS2 (the percentage of 1T phase, Vs, surface areas, etc.) obtained by the different approaches and the variation of reaction conditions in different labs, which makes it hard to analyse the influence of a specific factor. However, all of the work suggested that the introduction of 1T phase MoS2 into the original 2H one could lead to a lower onset potential, lower Tafel slope and larger current density at the same overpotential.
The advanced HER performance of 1T MoS2 compared to its 2H counterpart was mainly attributed to the ample active sites on 1T MoS2 (unlike 2H which only possesses active sites at the edges) and the higher conductivity of the 1T phase. As confirmed experimentally, the HER activity of 1T MoS2 did not show any significant change after oxidation of its edge sites while the performance of 2H MoS2 decreased dramatically after the same treatment (Fig. 14d).92 Lowering the contact resistance between single layer 2H MoS2 with natural sulfur vacancies and the substrates allowed the activation of the basal planes of 2H MoS2 and a comparable HER activity to that of edge-exposed MoS2 and even 1T MoS2 could be investigated on solely plane-exposed 2H MoS2.86 Besides, while the performance of 2H could be further improved by hybridizing with single-wall carbon nanotubes to enhance its conductivity, the activity of 1T MoS2 remains the same with the same treatment (Fig. 14e).92
The HER performance of 1T MoS2 in acidic solution (0.5 M H2SO4) can be further enhanced by the introduction of more sulfur vacancies94 and the exposure of more edges.29,94 Porous metallic 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets (P-1T MoS2) fabricated using a novel liquid-ammonia-assisted lithiation method outperformed the conventional 1T MoS2 (η10 = 203 mV; Tafel slope = 48 mV dec−1) because it possessed more edges and sulfur vacancies.94 On these porous 1T-MoS2 nanosheets, the cooperative effects of the 1T phase, sulfur vacancies, and edges resulted in a large electrochemically active surface area and an excellent intrinsic HER activity with an η10 and Tafel slope as low as 153 mV and 43 mV dec−1, respectively (Fig. 14f). Similarly, a large number of active sites could be exposed with MoS2 quantum nanodots (3.0–5.4 nm) with a high percentage of 1T phase (92–97%) fabricated via an electrochemical lithiation process with a small discharge current density (0.001 A g−1).111 Thus an excellent HER performance was attained with a typical η10 of 92 mV, a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1, and an exchange current density of 4.16 × 10−4 A cm−2. Nanodots of MoS2 synthesized by another method, i.e. ball-milling assisted exfoliation, with an ∼70% 1T structure also showed an acceptable HER performance with the onset potential, η10 and Tafel slope being −58 mV, 173 mV and 53 mV dec−1, respectively because of their high-density of exposed edge sites.29 Furthermore, the η10 and Tafel slope (140 mV and 40 mV dec−1) for MoSSe nanodots obtained by the same approach were even lower with additional basal-plane Se-vacancies compared to MoS2 nanodots.
Doping other transition metals147 and intercalating different metal ions148 into 1T MoS2 layers are both able to enhance the HER performance of 1T MoS2. FeS2 doping was reported as a way to improve the performance of 1T MoS2 as well and the FeS2 doped MoS2 nanoflowers with 66% 1T-MoS2 reached 10 mA cm−2 at −136 mV, which is comparable to reported values with 1T containing MoS2.147 However, the Tafel slope (82 mV dec−1) exhibited was much higher than that of typical 1T-containing MoS2 and the role of FeS2 was not clearly elucidated. In another study, a lowered overpotential for the HER was also observed on 1T-MoS2 after it was intercalated with cations like Na+, Ca2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ by simply adding these cations to the suspension of 1T MoS2.148 Impressively, the onset potential for 1T MoS2 was lowered by ∼60 mV (from −180 mV for pristine 1T MoS2 to −120 mV) with intercalated Na+ in acidic media. The reason for this enhanced performance was due to the reduced Gibbs free energy for H-adsorption (ΔGH), according to the DFT calculations, while a ΔGH close to zero was obtained with Na+ intercalation.
As another minor way to improve the electrochemical activity of 1T MoS2, subjecting single layer 1T MoS2 to electrochemical pretreatment below +0.4 V vs. RHE, is able to cause a fine positive tuning of the electrochemical and catalytic properties of 1T containing MoS2 (Li+ intercalation exfoliated) for the generation of faster heterogeneous electron transfer.46
Integrating with appropriate substrates, especially conductive carbon materials,3,32,34,123 could not only enhance the electrochemical activity of 1T MoS2 but also stabilize the 1T structures in the meantime. With 1T dominated MoS2 grown on mesoporous carbon fiber and used as an electrocatalyst, the current density reached 200 mA cm−2 at only 200 mV overpotential and the Tafel slope was 66 mV dec−1.32 Hydrothermally obtained 50% 1T incorporated 2H MoS2in situ grown on rGO possessed strong phase coupling, electron transfer ability, a low charge transfer resistance of 12 Ω and a Gibbs free energy of H* near zero.123 Accordingly, a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec−1 and a low η10 of 126 mV were observed using this material as a HER electrode. Similarly, hydrothermally obtained 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as substrates exhibited a remarkable HER activity with an onset potential as low as 50 mV and a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1.34 The outstanding performance was contributed by the uniform distribution of the metallic 1T MoS2 on the carbon nanotubes which possessed a large surface area but also a high conductivity, providing an effective electron transport route to promote the reaction. A more in-depth understanding of 1T MoS2 on carbon substrates was demonstrated by Liu et al. with 1T MoS2 grown on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).3 Similar to the other systems, it was suggested that the strong chemical coupling between SWNTs and 1T MoS2 allowed the uniform growth of MoS2 nanosheets with a small mean size of 5 nm, which provided abundant accessible active catalytic sites for the HER, and the electronic coupling at the interface facilitated the electron transfer. Furthermore, the researchers revealed by simulated deformation charge density that 0.924 electron shifted from the SWNT core to 1T-MoS2 during the solvothermal synthesis process. With these doped electrons from SWNTs, the absorption energy of H atoms on 1T-MoS2 could be weakened, leading to superior electrocatalytic activity. Resultantly, the initial overpotential achieved was as small as ∼40 mV, along with a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1, an η10 of 108 mV, and excellent stability.
Nevertheless, MoS2, both 1T and 2H, generally suffers from low activity in alkaline electrolytes,177,178 where the HER shows lower kinetics and higher sensitivity to the surface structure of the catalysts.179 Meanwhile, alkaline media are regarded to be more competitive for practical large-scale water splitting as few electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can remain stable in acidic media. Recently, strategies have been carried out to enhance the performance of 1T MoS2 in neutral and alkaline media. Zhang et al. enhanced the HER activities of metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets under alkaline and neutral conditions through interface engineering, namely, hybridizing the 2D material with 0D nickel hydr(oxy)oxide (Ni2+δOδ(OH)2−δ) nanoparticles. With the Ni2+δOδ(OH)2−δ nanoparticles as a cocatalyst to facilitate the water adsorption and dissociation, the optimized hybrid catalyst exhibited an η10 of ∼73 mV in 1 M KOH, decreased by 112 mV in comparison to that of pristine 1T-MoS2.180 More impressively, via a facile one-pot strategy, Shang et al. achieved an ultra-stable 1T MoS2 single layer vertically aligned/embedded in amorphous CoOOH (Fig. 10e, named MCSO), which was not only excellent for the HER but also showed remarkable performance for overall water splitting in alkaline media.152 While the advanced (a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−1) and stable (constant current in 25 h at −160 mV) HER activity (Fig. 14g) was mainly attributed to the 1T MoS single layer with its high conductivity and abundance active sites, the CoOOH in this heterostructure not only played a vital role in anchoring and stabilizing the 1T MoS2 as single layers, but also contributed to the outstanding OER performance (with an η10 of 345 mV, a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1 and high stability in 20 h) (Fig. 14h and i). Furthermore, obvious generation of both H2 and O2 could be observed when using this unique material as both the anode and the cathode in 1 M KOH with a 2 V power source (inset of Fig. 14i).
Note that the superiority of 1T MoS2 does not depend only on the specific phase. In some cases, MoS2 samples with a lower amount of 1T phase but a larger number of sulfur vacancies achieved a higher electrocatalytic activity. For example, by treating ammonia-intercalated MoS2 with 71% 1T phase (A-MoS2) in H2, MoS2 with 43% 1T and additional sulfur vacancies (R-MoS2) was obtained.181 The latter outperformed the previous one with a lower overpotential (η10) of 111 mV in alkaline solution. Integrating this excellent material with nickel foam (NF) can further improve the activity with η10 reaching 71 mV, η40 105 mV, exceeding that of Pt/C (η40 = 156 mV). Nevertheless, the Tafel slope of A-MoS2 which possessed a larger percentage of 1T phase (66 mV dec−1) was still smaller than that of R-MoS2 (105 mV dec−1) and R-MoS2@NF (100 mV dec−1), suggesting the importance of the intrinsic conductivity of MoS2 to the HER, implying the great influence of the metallic 1T phase to the Tafel plots.
Additionally, in spite of the higher activity of 1T MoS2 for the HER than 2H MoS2, the instability of the 1T structure upon thermal treatment and aging remains a great concern that impedes its application.71,92 Once the 1T phase decreases, the electrocatalytic activity will go down. Besides the above-mentioned strategies like growing on a substrate and CoOOH protection, which enhanced both the activity and stability of 1T MoS2 involved electrocatalysts, preserving the metallic state of MoS2 to avoid the gradual diminution of activity was also attempted by functionalization of chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets with a series of substituted phenyldiazonium salts (p-NO2Ph-MoS2, 3,5-Cl2Ph-MoS2, p-BrPh-MoS2, p-OCH3Ph-MoS2, and p-(CH3CH2)2NPh-MoS2).167 It was found that the phenyl group formed an S–C bond to MoS2 and removed some amount of excess charge, which hindered the conversion of 1T back to the 2H structure with time and heating thus showing more stable HER performance. However, at the same time, the HER activity was reduced after functionalization with these electron-withdrawing organic substances as the HER activity is intimately correlated with the excess charge density on the MoS2 sheet.3,46,182 The contradiction between the stability and activity of MoS2 in the HER, therefore, has to be considered and balanced in future studies so as to provide valid support for practical application of this material.
Based on the above discussion, it could be seen that 1T MoS2 showed much higher electrocatalytic activity than 2H MoS2 because of its abundant active sites in the plane and high conductivity. However, other factors like sulfur vacancies, layer thickness, porosities and doping elements have to be considered for achieving a high overall efficiency for the HER based on MoS2. The methods, which could synthesize defective and porous 1T MoS2, show great promise in this application.
5.2 Photo(electro)chemical catalysis
Cocatalyst doping is a common strategy for obtaining enhanced performance in photocatalysis. The roles of cocatalysts are to form unique adsorption with the reactant (lower the energy needed to drive the reactions) and to facilitate the electron transfer to the surface active sites (inhibit the recombination of photo-generated charges).183 Therefore, noble metals (Pt, Au, Pd etc.) with their active surface and electron trapping properties are popular cocatalysts for photocatalysis. However, their scarcity and high price drive us to seek for low-cost but still efficient alternatives.
MoS2 has been widely studied as a cocatalyst in photocatalysis because of its outstanding performance in the HER and non-noble metal nature.5 The 1T phase of MoS2 not only possesses these merits of common MoS2, but also shows high charge transport ability and a large number of active sites on the base plane and thus is a more excellent cocatalyst compared to the general 2H phase of MoS2.124,169 1T MoS2 was firstly used in photocatalysis by Urmimala et al. in a photocatalytic H2 evolution system using Eosin Y (EY) as the sensitizer and 15% triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent under the irradiation of a 100 W halogen lamp with a flux of 300 W m−2.182 The H2 production achieved was excellent with a value as high as 30 mmol g−1 h−1 (600 times that of few-layer 2H MoS2), corresponding to a TOF of 6.25 h−1. As 1T MoS2 is metallic without noticeable band gap, electrons could not be photo-excited on 1T MoS2. Drying and aging in water for a month only reduced the activity of the 1T MoS2 from 30 to 24 and 26 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively, suggesting a relatively high stability of the chemically exfoliated MoS2. But after annealing, when the 1T structures transformed into the 2H ones, a drastic reduction in the H2 yield was observed, indicating the essentialness of the existent of the 1T structure. During the photocatalytic process, the electrons were transferred from photogenerated species EY− to the 1T MoS2, which functioned more as an electrocatalyst, rather than a photocatalyst.
The position of 1T MoS2 as an efficient cocatalyst in photocatalysis was then confirmed by Bai et al.169 who used 1T MoS2 nanosheets as a cocatalyst for TiO2 and compared the photocatalytic hydrogen production (25 vol% methanol as a sacrificial reagent) and the Rhodamine B degradation performance of the 1T MoS2/TiO2 hybrid with that of 2H MoS2/TiO2 (Fig. 15a and b) and Liu et al.74 who hybridized metallic MoS2 synthesized via a hydrothermal route with semiconducting CdS nanorods and demonstrated a giant enhancement of the hydrogen yield (21 times higher than that of pure CdS and 3 times higher than that of the corresponding annealed CdS:2H-MoS2). Notably, if 1T-MoS2 was in situ grown on CdS nanorods, forming an intimate nanojunction between the interfaces, the photocatalytic activity of CdS could be boosted by a factor of 39 with the optimum loading (0.2 wt%) of 1T-MoS2.143

To understand the mechanism of the catalytic activity of 1T-MoS2, Wang et al. conducted cycling tests with 1T-MoS2 rooted on one-dimensional TiO2 nanofibers (obtained by chemically exfoliating hydrothermally synthesized TiO2@MoS2) and found that the H2 evolution increased in a super-linear way (Fig. 15c), indicating an optimization (completed after 7 h) of active sites on the exfoliated TiO2@MoS2 at the initial stage of the photocatalytic process.168 Actually, a similar H2 evolution curve was presented in Urmimala et al.'s work182 mentioned earlier (Fig. 15c inset). However, no explanation was given then. Assisted by HRTEM monitoring and theoretical calculations, Wang et al. revealed the gradual phase transition from 1T to 1T′, a distorted 1T structure, with the super-lattice of Mo atoms clustering into zigzag chains (Fig. 15d). It was also suggested by the researchers that the major driving force for this phase transition was the adsorption of hydrogen atoms. In addition, this 1T-involved MoS2 also showed excellent stability with a slight decrease of photocatalytic activity after 360 days.168
Theoretically, hybrids of 1T and 2H MoS2 could also be a photocatalyst, where the semiconducting 2H MoS2 functions as the photocatalyst and the 1T MoS2 as the cocatalyst. Bicrystalline (1T embedded in the 2H phase) MoS2 thin nanolayers with sulfur vacancies have been synthesized by Liu et al. through a simple hydrothermal method and used directly as a photocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution in 80 mL water with 10% methanol as a sacrificial reagent under a 300 W Xe lamp.144 By changing the Mo-precursors from Na2MoO4 to (NH4)2MoS4, samples with an increased ratio of 1T (12% to 16%) and more sulfur vacancies was obtained. The latter also demonstrated an enhanced H2 production rate with stable cycling performance (94% retention after 20 cycles).144
Since metallic 1T MoS2 is highly conductive, it has also been used as an electron mediator in Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalytic systems. Shi et al. sandwiched metallic 1T-phase MoS2 nanosheets between MoO3 and g-C3N4 to fabricate an all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst (MoO3/1T-MoS2/g-C3N4). Thanks to the highly efficient spatial charge separation and transfer induced by 1T MoS2, a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 513.0 μmol h−1 g−1 was obtained on the composite catalyst under >420 nm visible light irradiation, whereas only 39.5 μmol h−1 g−1 and 145.7 μmol h−1 g−1 H2 were generated on the pure g-C3N4 and MoO3/g-C3N4, respectively. Besides, the photocatalyst also showed excellent photo-stability as the originally metastable 1T-phase of MoS2 protected by MoO3 and g-C3N4.184
The metallic nature as well as the abundant basal active sites of 1T MoS2 make it a favorable composite for photoelectrodes as well. Ammoniated MoS2 (with 55.7% 1T phase) synthesized with ammonium as hydrothermal solution was directly used as a photo-anode after being coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, reaching a current density of −1600 μA cm−2 at −1.3 V (vs. SCE), which was much higher than those of commonly hydrothermally synthesized MoS2 (C-MoS2 with ∼25.5% 1T) (−500 μA cm−2) and bulk MoS2 (B-MoS2, 2H phase) (−280 μA cm−2) under the same conditions.33 Besides, the onset potential of A-MoS2 (−0.6 V vs. SCE) was also profoundly higher than that of C-MoS2 (−1.15 V). By forming a heterostructure of chemically exfoliated metallic 1T-MoS2 and planar p-type Si, a highly efficient and robust photocathode for solar-driven hydrogen production with photocurrents up to 17.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE under simulated 1 sun irradiation was obtained.185 The different performance (photo-response and resistances) of 2H and 1T MoS2 and that of drop-cast 1T and in situ CVD grown 1T MoS2 on Si (Fig. 15e and f) revealed the important roles of the conductive 1T MoS2 in the composite and the intimate contact between the Si and MoS2 interfaces, both of which could lower the charge-transfer resistances and contribute to the excellent performance. The case was just similar to exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets uniformly coated on the top surface of TiO2 nanoarrays (NAs), forming a 3D TiO2 NAs/MoS2 photoanode.6 The maximum photocurrent density (∼2.4 mA cm−2) of TiO2 NAs loaded with 1T-MoS2 (0.1 mg) was 3.4 and 1.7 times those of the pristine TiO2 NAs (0.7 mA cm−2) and the TiO2 NAs with 2H-MoS2 (1.4 mA cm−2), respectively. As schematically shown in Fig. 15g, the attached MoS2 to the TiO2 anode was essential to promote the transfer of holes rather than electrons from TiO2 while the electrons went through the wires to the counter electrode for the H2 evolution reaction. And the superiority of 1T MoS2 to 2H MoS2 for the transfer of holes was attributed to the larger impetus and better electrical conductivity of the 1T structure.
The current utilization of 1T MoS2 in photo(electro)chemical reactions as a cocatalyst mainly takes advantage of the conductivity of MoS2. The other properties of MoS2 such as sulfur vacancies, defects, and morphologies have not received much attention. According to the HER performance of the 1T MoS2-based catalyst, MoS2 as a cocatalyst in these photo(electro)chemical reactions could be further modified for an advanced promoting effect.
5.3 Room-temperature thermal catalysis
The excellent performance of 1T MoS2 in the HER has aroused interest in applying this material for other catalytic reactions.186 Guardia et al. used chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets (ce-MoS2) as a catalyst for a series of room-temperature reduction reactions with NaBH4 as a reducing agent, including the reduction of 4-nitrophenol, 4-nitroaniline, methyl orange, and [Fe(CN)6]3−.87 The performance of 1T MoS2 (TOF = 0.74 min−1 for the reduction of 4-NP; 1.39 ± 0.08 min−1 for the reduction of 4-NA; 2.5 ± 0.08 min−1 for the reduction of MO; 392 ± 32 min−1 for the reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3−) was found to be comparable to those of reported noble-metal based materials such as Au NPs (TOF = 0.02–0.49 min−1 for the three reaction)187–189 and Pt nanocubes on an ITO substrate (TOF = 1.7 min−1 for the reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3−).190 Compared to 2H MoS2, which showed a TOF of only 0.015 min−1 for 4-NP reduction (Fig. 16a), the outstanding performance of ce-MoS2 with a large amount of 1T phase in these room-temperature reactions was supposed to be attributed to its abundant active sites that are located not only at the edges but also in the double basal planes and superior conductivity that could promote the electron transfer from the reducing agent to the reactants, similar to that in the HER.

The overlaid gray curve is the result of fitting the experimental curve to an exponential decay function. Reaction conditions: [4-NP] = 0.12 mM, [NaBH4] = 72 mM, and [ce-MoS2] = 89 μM. (b) Schematic of the overall mechanistic pathway for reduction reactions catalyzed by ce-MoS2 nanosheets with NaBH4 in aqueous medium. The BH4− anion hydrolyzes spontaneously in water to give H2 and the BH3OH− anion (1), and then the latter species injects electrons into metallic 1T sites of ce-MoS2 (2), which are finally transferred to the substrate molecule (4-NP, 4-NA, etc.) (3) to trigger its reduction (4).

The mechanism of the catalysis process with ce-MoS2 was found to be distinct from that of the process with noble metal catalysts. The catalysis with noble metals is based on electron injection from BH4− to the catalysts which function as a reservoir for excess electrons and allow the capture of electrons for the reactants once adsorbed on their surface.191,192 This process is independent of the pH value. However, with ce-MoS2 as the catalyst, the reaction stops at pH above 11. Relating this phenomenon to the slow hydrolysis of BH4− anion which stops as a high pH value and through a few control studies, Guardia et al. proposed that BH3OH−, hydrolyzed BH4−, could be the actual reductant involved in the reduction reactions catalyzed by ce-MoS2, rather than BH4− itself.87 The proposed mechanism is schematically shown in Fig. 16b.
To further enhance the stability and robustness of 1T MoS2 for practical catalytic utilization, appropriate substrate materials can be chosen to form a composite with 1T MoS2. Self-assembled 1T-MoS2/rGO has been reported to be an efficient catalyst for 4-NP hydrogenation with a large K to mass value (k = 10388.3 min−1 g−1).193 The function of rGO in the process was suggested to concentrate 4-NP through π–π stacking interactions and to improve the transportation of electrons from NaBH4 to 4-NP.
The key properties of 1T MoS2 in room-temperature thermal catalysis are similar to those in the HER. But due to the difference in reactants, the surface functionalities of the MoS2 used in this field can further be tuned specifically, which may bring about a great improvement to the catalytic performance.
5.4 Supercapacitor
Supercapacitors, or electrochemical capacitors, have shown a fast development in recent years because of their usefulness in hybrid power sources for electrical transportation systems and electronic devices like an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for computers.194–196 They are high-power devices that can operate at high charge and discharge rates (within a few seconds or a few tens of seconds) over numerous cycles. Nevertheless, the widespread use of supercapacitors is a great challenge because of the lack of a device with ideal performance. Many factors including electrode materials, electrolyte, current collector, device structure etc. affect the performance of supercapacitors. The electrode material is considered to be the most essential issue to achieve a high capacitance.197 Desirable supercapacitor electrode materials should be conductive, chemically stable, and low in cost and have a large surface area.198
The unique structural and electronic properties of MoS2 nanosheets, especially the multiple layers stacked by van der Waals force allowing an easy intercalation of foreign ions, endow the material with great potential for application in the energy storage area including supercapacitors.10,170,199–201 However, limited by its semiconducting nature, conventional MoS2 with a typical 2H structure, whether exfoliated,170 mesoporous,201 or integrated with carbon materials,10,200 usually exhibits modest electrochemical storage performances inferior to that of graphene202,203 or MXenes.204,205 The metallic 1T type MoS2 should be more favorable as a supercapacitor electrode material as it is not only more conductive which is beneficial to electron transport for high-power supercapacitors, but also has a high hydrophilicity and a larger interlayer space that would facilitate the intercalation of various ions.206
The performance of 1T MoS2 in supercapacitors was not revealed until recently when Acerce et al.23 fabricated a supercapacitor electrode (5 μm in thickness and 2.5 mg cm−1 in area density) by restacking chemically exfoliated MoS2 with a large ratio (70%) of 1T structure (Fig. 17a). For the intercalation of cations with a high density into the 1T MoS2 layers, the specific gravimetric capacitance of the 1T MoS2 film electrode in Na2SO4 (scan rate: 20 mV s−1) is ∼20 times that of the electrode formed from 2H MoS2 solution (Fig. 17b). Though the volumetric capacitance of the 1T MoS2 electrode varied with different electrolytes, exceptionally high values ranging from 400 to 650 F cm−3 at a low scan rate (<20 mV s−1) could be obtained with all of the electrolytes applied (Fig. 17c). And the high capacitance and rectangular shape of the 1T MoS2 electrode remained even at very high scan rates above 200 mV s−1 (Fig. 17d). Besides, the 1T MoS2 electrodes also demonstrated remarkable capacitive behavior in non-aqueous electrolytes with capacitances as high as 199 F cm−3 in tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEA BF4)/MeCN and 250 F cm−3 in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM BF4)/MeCN at 5 mV s−1. More impressively, the values of energy density and power density in the organic electrolytes (0.11 W h cm−3 and 1.1 W cm−3 respectively at 0.5 A g−1; 0.051 W h cm−3 and 51 W cm−3 respectively at 32 A g−1) was dramatically larger than those obtained with the aqueous electrolytes (0.016 W h cm−3 and 0.62 W cm−3 respectively at 0.5 A g−1; 0.011 W h cm−3 and 8.7 W cm−3 respectively at 16 A g−1). These values were superior to those of most of the reported electrode materials (Fig. 17e).202,203,205,207

The importance of the 1T phase in MoS2 electrochemical electrodes for a high performance in supercapacitors was then verified by other researchers with MoS2 in different morphologies. Thi et al. found that while an excellent specific capacitance of 259 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with great cycling stability after 1000 cycles could be attained for a MoS2 nanoflower electrode with 73% 1T phase in 1 M KCl aqueous electrolyte, the capacitance fell down to below 200 F g−1 if the ratio of 1T phase was only 50%.44 Hierarchical nanotubular 1T-MoS2 (with majority of 1T phase) composed of small ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets delivered a remarkable specific capacitance of 328.47 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, which was 11.7 and 22.7 times that of the material after annealing (with primarily the 2H phase) and commercial MoS2, respectively.43 Meanwhile, the material displays excellent cycling stability with 98.4% retained capacity after 5000 cycles at 3 A g−1 and a high specific capacitance of 250 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a two-electrode symmetrical cell. The excellent supercapacitor behaviors were attributed to the ultrathin sheet-like surface and hierarchical hollow nanostructure which endowed the material with a short ion transmission distance and small volume change during charge–discharge cycles. 1T MoS2 with petal-like nanostructures (MP-LNs), synthesized by the solvothermal method, also presented high specific capacitances with values of 811 F g−1 and 400 F g−1 at current densities of 0.1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, using 1 M KCl as the electrolyte. However, the long-term cycling stability of MP-LNS was poor with a specific capacitance retention of 49.3% at 0.1 A g−1 and 82.7% at 10 A g−1 only after 1000 charge–discharge cycles.208
Well-aligned nanochannels provided by the interlayer space of the MoS2 electrodes are of great importance to achieve a high capacitance as they allow a fast intercalation of the cations. Impressively, ultrafast-rate supercapacitors with extraordinarily high capacitances both in three electrode systems (380 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 105 F g−1 at 10 V s−1 in 0.5 M Li2SO4) and in symmetrical two electrode capacitors (249 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 in 1 M Li2SO4) were achieved through a multilayer M-MoS2–H2O system which consisted of metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets and a monolayer of water molecules covering both sides of the nanosheets.209 The specific capacitance of symmetric MoS2 supercapacitor cells remained at 150 F g−1 (a capacity retention up to 88%) even after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The outstanding performance was mainly because of the fact that while the nearly pure 1T structure facilitated the electron transport in the supercapacitor, the nanochannels (∼1.18 nm in width) between the layers of M-MoS2–H2O were favorable for ion diffusion and adsorption. MoS2 (60% 1T) with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.99 nm, obtained using an ammonium-assisted hydrothermal method, exhibited marvelous charge-storage performance with a specific capacitance decrease by only 41.5% (from ∼354 to 207 F g−1) as the scan speed increased from 1 to 100 mV s−1, and an excellent cycling stability with 95.4% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles.4
To avoid the aggregation and highly possible phase change of 1T MoS2 which could lead to poor supercapacitor behaviors, graphene or reduced graphene oxide has been exploited as an effective phase stabilizer and mechanical support. By filtrating mixed GO and chemically exfoliated 1T MoS2 to form a restacked film followed by an annealing procedure at 200 °C in air, MoS2/GO hybrid films consisting of a high concentration of distorted 1T-MoS2 could be obtained. The hybrid structure, with the highly conductive 1T phase of MoS2 and an intimate binding between MoS2 and rGO, showed ultrahigh volumetric power density (≈207 W cm−3) and volumetric capacitance (≈380 F cm−3 at 10 mV s−1) as well as an appreciable cycling life with a capacitance retention of 95% after 10000 cycles in a strongly basic 6 M KOH electrolyte.210 A hydrothermally synthesized 3D structured matrix with rGO and 1T/2H MoS2 presented a remarkably high specific capacitance value up to 416 F g−1 and a highly stable capacitance behavior over 50000 charge–discharge cycles in three- and two-electrode configurations and symmetric planar devices. The high performance was attributed greatly to the unique rGO-supported structure which allowed the full exposure of the uniformly distributed 1T and 2H MoS2 sheets to the electrolyte, facilitating the surface/near-surface redox reactions.211 Also outstandingly, coin cells constructed from a composite of graphene and 1T-MoS2 obtained by a facile bench-top electrochemical exfoliation reached a volumetric capacitance of over 560 F cm−3 in an aqueous system and 250 F cm−3 in a nonaqueous electrolyte and could maintain over 90% capacity after 5000 cycles.109
Besides, doping with transition metals could lead to improved capacity of 1T MoS2 along with an enhanced thermal stability. Li et al. reported Co stabilized 1T MoS2 monolayers with a largely distorted structure, in which Co–S bonds were formed on the surface of the MoS2 layers, exhibiting a specific capacitance (454 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 3.0 M KOH) more than 4 times that of pristine 1T MoS2 (∼100 F g−1) and an excellent cycling stability (∼100% capacitance retention after 25000 cycles at 10 A g−1).212 The unique distorted 1T structure induced by the stronger ionic potential of Co atoms compared to Mo was the key to the improved thermal stability and conductivity.
Furthermore, 1T MoS2 can be utilized to integrate with other electrode materials for advanced capacitive performance. For example, polyaniline (PANI) is an attractive conducting polymer electrode material on account of its high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost, environmental friendliness, and feasibility for application in large-scale devices.213,214 But it shows poor cycling stability because of the expanded inherent volume and decreased charge transfer efficiency after repeated charge–discharge processes.215,216 By depositing PANI on MoS2 monolayers with 72% 1T phase followed by carbon coating to form a composite electrode, a remarkable capacitance of up to 678 F g−1 (at 10 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4) and a relatively high cycle stability (80%) after 10000 cycles at 100 mV s−1 could be obtained due to the synergistic effects between PANI and 1T MoS2 as well as the thin coated carbon.217 1T-MoS2/PANI heterostructures with alternating stacked layers of the two compounds formed by electrostatic attraction showed good structural stability due to the strong intercalation at the intimate contact between the two materials.12 When used as an electrode material in supercapacitors, the close atomic contact improves the electron and ion transport between the nanocomposites greatly as well as the compatibility of the electrode to the aqueous electrolyte. Resultantly, a specific capacitance of 310 F g−1 could still be obtained at a current density as high as 20 A g−1 (specific capacitance at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g−1 at 470, 440, 410, 370, 340, and 310 F g−1, respectively) with 0.5 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte and the capacitance retention was up to 91% at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles.
In addition, the exciting performance of 1T MoS2 in traditional supercapacitors has also aroused interest to apply it in transparent supercapacitors, a new functionalized energy storage device that can be used in optical circuits, touch screens, electrochromic devices and smart windows.218,219 The electrode in transparent supercapacitors mainly consists of a thin layer (dozens of nanometers or even smaller) of active materials with a very low mass deposited on a transparent conductive substrate (indium tin oxide (ITO), PET etc.). Therefore, areal capacitance (CA) and volumetric capacitance (CV) are generally used for transparent supercapacitor electrodes, rather than gravimetric capacitance (CM) which is commonly used in traditional supercapacitors. Currently, the most efficient transparent supercapacitors have CA values just around 1.0–2.0 mF cm−2,219,220 and developing a transparent supercapacitor with high specific capacitance remained a great challenge. Li D. et al. firstly prepared a transparent 1T-MoS2 nanofilm electrode anchored on ITO glass by alternate layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly of cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and chemically exfoliated few-layer 1T MoS2 nanosheets with intrinsic negative charges.171 ITO/(PDDA/MoS2)20, which possessed 20 alternative layers of PDDA and MoS2 (50 nm in thickness), showed excellent optical transparency with a transmittance of 51.6% at 550 nm, high robustness with little damage after 12 h ultrasonication, and great capacitive performance with areal and volumetric capacitances of 1.1 mF cm−2 and 220 F cm−3, respectively, at a current density of 0.04 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KCl (maintained 73% at 0.1 mA cm−2). Moreover, interestingly, the capacitance increased to 130.6% of the original value after 5000 cycles at 0.06 mA cm−2 due to the gradual release of more Mo active sites during the charge/discharge cycles.221
The extraordinarily high performance of 1T-MoS2 based materials in supercapacitors has aroused significant interest because of their desirable structures and efficient charge transportation properties. The interest is still rising with the aim to achieve an electrochemical capacitor with high electron and energy density as well as a high stability. And the development of transparent devices with 1T MoS2 has just started with a lot to be explored.
5.5 Batteries

5.5.1 Lithium ion batteries. 
Due to their high energy density greater than 180 W h kg−1 and great longevity of about 2–3 years, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been used for consumer electronic products (cell phones, laptop computers, digital cameras, etc.) and electric or hybrid vehicles since their commercialization by Sony Corporation in the early 1990s.222 In LIBs, the electrochemical energy is converted and stored through reversible electrochemical reactions with the electrochemical properties of reactive electrode materials showing a great influence on the battery performance (specific capacity and operation voltage). Graphite is the most commonly used anode in conventional Li-ion batteries but the low theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mA h g−1) severely limited the application of LIBs. So far, in order to obtain next generation high-performance LIBs, numerous materials have been explored.108,223–225 Among them, MoS2 with its layered S–Mo–S sandwich structure analogous to that of graphite, numerous active sulfur sites, low cost and a theoretical capacity twice (ca. 670 mA h g−1) that of graphite is one of the most promising.226–228 Initially MoS2 was studied as a cathode material229 but now it has been widely used as an anode for LIBs.13,108,226,230–232

Fig. 18a shows the first charge–discharge curves of the original 2H MoS2 and exfoliated MoS2 (majority 1T phase) with different amounts of PEO.108 In the first discharge (Li insertion), the plateaus at 1.1 V and 0.6 V are related to the formation of LixMoS2 (eqn (4)) and the reduction of Mo4+ to Mo metal with the generation of Li2S (eqn (5)), respectively. The two plateaus only exist in the first discharge process and never show up again in the following cycles. In the first charge (Li extraction) process, a new plateau at ∼2.2 V, ascribed to the extraction of Li from Li2S, appears and repeats in the subsequent cycles (Fig. 18b). Comparing the performance of the pristine 2H MoS2 and the exfoliated MoS2 with a mainly 1T phase, the capacity of the pristine MoS2 is ∼600 mA h g−1 in the first discharge and decreases dramatically to 200 mA h g−1 in the second cycle, while for the 1T MoS2, an initial discharge capacity of 1000 mA h g−1 and a maintained capacity of above 500 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles were obtained (Fig. 18c). This reveals that exfoliated MoS2 is more favorable for application in LIBs, which could be due to its conductive 1T structure and expanded interlayer space, leading to a more accelerated reaction between Li+ and MoS2.225,233–237 However, the results also reflect the poor cycling stability of 1T MoS2. This in fact is a great shortage with this material as revealed by many other reports.230,231 MoS2 + xLi + xe− → LixMoS2(4) LixMoS2 + (4 − x)Li + (4 − x)e− → Mo + 2Li2S(5)

Fortunately, enhancement in the capacity retention of the 1T MoS2 electrode after cycling has been realized by modification with organic polymer compounds and conducing materials like graphene. Incorporation of polymer compounds like PEO108 and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)PEDOT229 has been demonstrated to show an obvious promoting effect on the performance of 1T MoS2 in LIBs. As shown in Fig. 18a–c, the composite of the exfoliated MoS2 and 5% PEO polymer shows not only increased performances compared to solely exfoliated MoS2 but also enhanced cyclability to a great extent.108 This is because PEO absorbed on the MoS2 nanosheets not only stabilized the structure of MoS2 during the cycling, maintaining its ability to accommodate Li+ ions, but also facilitated Li+ transportation between the solid and electrolyte with Li-doped PEO.
Utilizing the confinement effect of graphene to stabilize 1T-containing MoS2 nanosheets has been found to be an effective way to enhance the cycling performance of MoS2 in LIBs as well along with the improvement in Li storage.238,239 Graphene-wrapped 3D MoS2 hierarchitectures with hybrid 1T and 2H phases, synthesized by a hydrothermal approach with P123, (NH4)2MoS4 and thiourea in reduced graphene/ammonia solution (2.5 g L−1), not only delivered much higher discharge capacities (1086 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at 0.5 A g−1) compared to the solely 3D MoS2 (712 mA h g−1), but also more importantly an enhanced cycling stability.238 After 50 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, 3D MoS2 showed a dramatic decrease in discharge capacity down to 245 mA h g−1 with a capacity loss of 66% while the graphene-wrapped 3D MoS2 electrode retained a capacity of 897 mA h g−1, 82.6% of the initial value. Even at a high current density of 2 A g−1, the graphene protected MoS2 still presented a high reversible capacity of ∼822 mA h g−1 in the second cycle and a capacity retention of 87% after 50 cycles. Similarly, Wang L. et al. synthesized a metallic MoS2 based electrode with Mo atoms confined in the inter-layer space of graphene which were regarded as abnormal lithium-storage sites and achieved an ultrahigh specific capacity of ∼1800 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, 2.6 times higher than its theoretical value.239 Moreover, this special sandwiched 1T-MoS2/graphene demonstrated an excellent coulombic efficiency (CE) close to 100% at 1 A g−1 for each cycle and an outstanding capacitance retention with little decrease in capacitance after 800 cycles and even a minor increase in the following 500 cycles (Fig. 18d). The hybrid of 1T-MoS2/graphene, where 1T MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets with expanded interlayer space (9.8 Å vs. 6.16 Å for common 2H MoS2) were vertically grown on the graphene sheets, delivered a capacity of 666 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 3.5 A g−1, while pure 1T-MoS2 showed almost no capacity under the same conditions.153 After 100 cycles at 0.35 A g−1, 1T-MoS2/graphene maintained a capacity of 1016 mA h g−1 without significant fading. Both the enlarged interlayer spacing that offered more active areas for lithium storage and the highly efficiency electron/ion transport pathway provided by the metallic 1T phase and graphene with C–O–Mo bonding contributed to the high capacity and stability of the batteries.240
Sticking the 1T phase onto other carbon materials could also result in an enhanced reversible capacity and cycling stability. Growing MoS2 nanosheet arrays perpendicularly onto carbon fiber cloth (CFC) with a high coverage using a controllable solvothermal method resulted in a specific capacity as high as 1789 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after subtracting the total capacity of CFC and an excellent cycling stability with a retained capacity of 853 mA h g−1 after 140 cycles at 1 A g−1.235 The discharge capacities of N-doped 1T@2H on carbon cloth were up to 1308 and 538 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 and 2 A g−1, respectively, and remained at 1125 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles and 510 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles.125
Alternatively, by using ZIF-67, a type of Co-containing metal–organic framework (MOF), as the template during the hydrothermal synthesis of MoS2, Lu et al. constructed a hierarchical anode material with a hollow cobalt sulfide polyhedral core surrounded by vertically aligned metallic phase MoS2 nanosheets (CoS@1T-MoS2, Fig. 18e), which also exhibited a high reversible capacity and a long cycling lifespan.151 The hybrid material showed several merits, namely, (1) an enlarged interlayer distance (0.82–0.83 nm) of the 1T MoS2, allowing a more efficient intercalation and extraction of Li+; (2) hollow framework that could effectively accommodate the volume change during cycling and facilitate the diffusion of Li+ ions and electrons; (3) high intrinsic conductivity of metallic 1T MoS2 resulting in ultrahigh charge transfer properties of the electrode; (4) uniformly dispersed metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets out of the CoS polyhedral core, providing abundant sites for the intercalation or conversion. Resultantly, a lithium ion diffusion coefficient (2.35 × 10−11 cm2 s−1) ∼138 times that of Co9S8@2H-MoS2 (obtained by annealing CoS@1T-MoS2 at 700 °C) and a high reversible capacity of 1269 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and 936 mA h g−1 after 220 cycles at 1 A g−1 were achieved on this specially structured material.
More impressively, a recent report of Jiao et al. suggested that by simply structuring the 1T MoS2 anode into porous nanotubes without any combined material, high reversible capacities along with excellent rate performance and cycling stability in LIBs could be realized.150 Porous nanotubes composed of vertically aligned 1T MoS2 nanosheets (Fig. 18f and g) were fabricated using a facile templated solvothermal method. This unique 1T MoS2 maintained a reversible capacity as high as 1100 mA h g−1 after 350 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1. Even when the current density went higher to 20 A g−1, the material could still deliver an appreciable rate performance of 589 mA h g−1 (Fig. 18h). These outstanding behaviors of the metallic MoS2 nanotubes as an anode for LIBs could be attributed to multiple factors including the intrinsic high electrical conductivity of 1T MoS2 (that facilitates the charge transfer in the batteries and the special hierarchical), an enlarged interlayer space of 1T MoS2 (that promotes the reaction kinetics), and the tubular, porous and hollow structure (which was not only beneficial for the transportation and diffusion of the electrolyte but also helpful to inhibit the restacking of the MoS2 nanosheets), maintaining its electrochemical stability.
Note that it has been investigated commonly that the actual capacities of MoS2 including 1T MoS2 are usually higher than the theoretical values. However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Recently, Wang et al. suggested that the extra capacity could be attributed to the contribution of Mo in alloying Li atoms, as shown in eqn (6).239 Another possibility could be that irreversible type LixMoS2 is formed in the first cycle which facilitates the subsequent Li+/Li conversion. As reported by Leng et al. Li1.0MoS2, a bulk nanophase material produced during the chemical intercalation of 2H bulk MoS2, exhibits a much higher capacity, cycle stability and rate capability compared to pristine or exfoliated MoS2 and is reformable and robust during the discharge/recharge process.241 Further mechanism studies are necessary to understand the nature of the battery behavior with MoS2 and maximize the potential of this material for energy storage applications. Mo + yLi+ + ye− → Mo/Liy(6)


5.5.2 Lithium–sulfur batteries. 
Li–S batteries (Fig. 19a) with S and metal Li as the cathode and anode respectively and a separator in between are a type of lithium battery distinct from LIBs.242 Compared to LIBs, Li–S batteries possess significantly higher energy density (2800 W h kg−1) and theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1).243 Nevertheless, the practical application of Li–S batteries is greatly hindered by the following problems: (1) the intrinsic low conductivity of S (5 × 10−30 S cm−1 at 25 °C); (2) the serious shuttle effect of polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) which will dissolve in the organic electrolyte and transfer through the separator to react with the Li anode, leading to a loss of active cathode species; and (3) expansion in volume during the discharge process.244 The shuttle effect of polysulfides is the most difficult but foremost challenge that needs to be overcome.245

To suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, a number of efforts have been made towards the synthesis of the cathode with a material that could adsorb polysulfides246–249 and the modification of the separator to inhibit the penetration of polysulfides.250–253 1T MoS2, as a polar ionic material like TiO2,248 Co3O4,249 and MnO2,246,247 can be used to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides by its strong chemisorption with the polysulfides. Moreover, 1T MoS2 has an advantage over these metal oxides with its high electron-transfer ability (conductivity). Wang et al. well constructed a hierarchical SnO2/1T-MoS2 nanoarray in situ grown on carbon cloth (C@SnO2@TMS) and used as a sulfur host for the cathode in Li–S batteries (Fig. 19b).234 In this special cathode, the large surface area and pores of the porous SnO2 array allowed the confinement of more sulfur, reduced the expansion of sulfur during lithiation and enhanced the chemisorption of polysulfides, while the metallic 1T MoS2 with its abundant active sites and conductivity accelerated the polysulfide redox kinetics. Resultantly, the battery exhibited excellent rate performance, high specific capacity, and a stable cycle lifespan. A high specific capacity of 448 mA h g−1 remained even after 4000 cycles at 5C with a capacity decay of 0.009% per cycle (Fig. 19c). Jeong et al. designed a bifunctional separator by depositing 1T MoS2 and carbon nanotubes (MoS2@CNT) sequentially on a pristine separator (Fig. 19d and f).110 This separator functioned not only as a polysulfide trap (Fig. 19g and h) but also as an upper-current collector. Through optimizing the physical and chemical properties of the electrochemically exfoliated 1T MoS2 and the conjunction with CNTs, a high electrochemical performance and long cycling stability (∼670 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a high current density of 1C) could be obtained in a tandem configuration (layer by layer structure). In addition, the portion of CNTs in MoS2@CNT also affects the batteries, more solid-state polysulfide species reacting reversibly and minimizing the capacity loss along with the increase of CNTs.
These limited but excellent studies, which considered using 1T MoS2 to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, either as an anode or a separator, open the door to Li–S batteries for 1T MoS2. Revealing the underlying mechanism and extending the application of 1T MoS2 in this field will be both interesting and significant.


5.5.3 Sodium ion batteries. 
The popularity of lithium batteries inevitably results in a great consumption of lithium resources.254 However, the amount of lithium in nature is very limited with only about 20 ppm in the crust of the Earth, leading to increasing price of Li,255 whereas sodium (Na), which possesses quite similar chemical properties to lithium, is large in amount and low in cost ($135–165 per ton).256,257 Therefore, as an alternative to Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years.257 The major challenge of Na-ion batteries, similar to that of Li-ion batteries, lies in the development of good electrode materials, the properties of which greatly determined the battery performance.258 While graphite, a common anode material for Li-ion batteries, is unsuitable for NIBs because of the larger ionic radius of Na ions (1.06 Å) than that of Li ions (0.76 Å),259,260 some 2D layered metal sulfides with structures analogous to that of graphite have been regarded as promising anode materials for Na-ion batteries.105,261,262 MoS2 is also among them with its layered structures beneficial for the intercalation of Na+ and a relatively high theoretical reversible capacity of 670 mA h g−1.262–264 When tested as an anode material for a Na-ion battery, MoS2/graphene nanosheets exhibit an obviously high rate capability of 284 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 (≈30C) and 201 mA h g−1 at 50 A g−1 (≈75C) as well as excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 95% after 250 cycles at 0.3 A g−1).265
Enlarging the interlayer space of MoS2 can effectively increase the diffusion of Na+ ions, resulting in higher rate capability and better cycling stability. The 1T octahedral phase of MoS2 usually possesses a larger interlayer distance (0.7–0.8 nm) than its 2H counterpart, making it a more promising intercalation anode material for Ni-ion batteries.145 Li Y. et al. attempted to enhance the performance of Na-ion batteries by increasing the interlayer distance of restacked metallic MoS2 with polyethylene oxide (PEO) (Fig. 20a).266 The interlayer distance increased with the amount of PEO and could be expanded up to 1.45 nm (Fig. 20b) without a change in the particle size and crystallinity of MoS2. PEO2L–MoS2 with the largest interlayer spacing showed the highest capacity (225 mA h g−1) after an initial 5 cycle activation stage and did not show dramatic capacity loss (148 mA h g−1 at the 70th cycle) (Fig. 20c).

Other materials like graphene have also been found effective to expand the interlayer space of MoS2, for example. Taking advantage of the edge defects of graphene nanoribbon aerogel (GNRA), a hybrid of 1T MoS2 and GNRA could be synthesized with the interlayer distances of MoS2 reaching 0.95–1.58 nm. The hybrid structures exhibited good performance for Ni-ion batteries with specific capacities of 372–203 mA h g−1 obtained in a current density range of 0.5–15 A g−1. A capacity of 158 mA h g−1 is still kept even after 1500 cycles at 5 A g−1.240 Another attractive trial was nucleating a thin layer of 1T MoS2 on both sides of graphene tubes to form a freestanding sandwiched MoS2–graphene–MoS2 structure.172 With a high density of 1T MoS2 grown on the graphene backbone, the special structure allowed a fast penetration of the electrolyte and thus an efficient reaction kinetic. The specific capacity obtained in a Na-ion cell was 630 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 for the initial discharge cycle and reduced to 313 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles.
Functionalization of 1T MoS2 with organic groups could stabilize the structure and improve its Na-ion battery behavior both in the aspect of specific capacity and cycling stability. Huang et al. successfully obtained methyl-functionalized MoS2 (M-MoS2) nanosheets with a dominant 1T phase, an interlayer distance of 0.8 nm and an excellent structural stability through a facile post solvothermal treatment.145 Compared to pristine MoS2, M-MoS2 delivered much more desirable cycling stability and rate capability with the sodium storage capacity mainly contributed by pseudocapacitive processes.


5.5.4 Magnesium ion batteries. 
Mg cells have shown potential for reversible storage and conversion of electrochemical energy due to their high theoretical specific capacity up to 2205 mA h g−1.267 Regarded as battery resources, magnesium elements show the same advantages of abundance and low cost as sodium. In particular, the amount of charge per atom of magnesium is twice that of sodium and lithium metal.268,269 Furthermore, it can be manufactured more easily because of its less reactive performance than Li and Na.268 But the drawbacks of magnesium application in batteries are also obvious, i.e. the sluggish insertion/extraction of Mg2+ in cathode materials, which is derived from the larger electrostatic forces and incompatibility of anode/electrolyte due to the high polarization of divalent Mg2+ cations.267,268 Therefore, the main challenge for the development of Mg-ion batteries is the exploration of suitable cathodes that could allow a highly efficient intercalation of Mg2+.270 MoS2, especially highly exfoliated MoS2 with dominated 1T phase, can be used as an attractive host in Mg-ion batteries owing to the weak van der Waals interaction between bilayers and the large interlayer distance.271 Based on the following reaction principles (eqn (7)–(9)), rechargeable Mg batteries with the highly exfoliated graphene-like MoS2 (G-MoS2, 0.65–0.7 nm in interlayer distances) as the cathode and ultrasmall Mg nanoparticles (∼2.5 nm in diameter, denoted as N–Mg) as the anode demonstrated an operating voltage of 1.8 V, an initial discharge capacity of 170 mA h g−1 and excellent discharge/charge cycling ability with 95% retained capacity after 50 cycles at 20 mA g−1 (Fig. 20d).272 Substituting bulk MoS2 (B-MoS2) for G-MoS2, or replacing the fine Mg nanoparticle with a bulk cluster of Mg (B-Mg), resulted in inferior performance (Fig. 20d and e).

Anode: 4Mg → 4Mg2+ + 8e−(8)
Overall: 6MoS2+ 4Mg → Mg4Mo6S12(9)
Similar to Na ion batteries, the interlayer distances of the MoS2 material are especially crucial for an efficient transfer and conversion of Mg/Mg2+. First-principles simulations demonstrated that expanding interlayer spacing could achieve faster Mg diffusion due to weakened interactions between Mg and the host, decreasing the Mg diffusion energy barrier from 2.61 to 0.48 eV and enhancing the diffusion kinetics by 1036 times.273 To further enhance the performance of MoS2 as an anode material for Mg-ion batteries, efforts have been made to enlarge the interlayer spacing of MoS2. PEO is an effective species for expanding MoS2 layers as demonstrated for Na batteries.266 Liang et al. successfully intercalated a certain amount of PEO into the lattice of MoS2 to form a special structure of MoS2–PEO with an interlayer distance up to 1.45 nm, achieving 2 orders of magnitude increase in Mg diffusivity, an reversible capacity in Mg-ion batteries (75 mA h g−1 at 5 mA g−1) approaching its theoretical storage capacity of multilayered MoS2 for Mg storage (111.6 mA h g−1) and an excellent cycling stability.274 However, this was carried out with bulk MoS2 rather than with fully chemically exfoliated 1T structured MoS2, the performance of which could be even better. Another good choice to intercalate into or combine with MoS2 nanosheets could be graphene due to its excellent electronic behavior, high chemical resistance, large specific surface area and good flexibility.275–277 According to Liu et al., intercalating graphene into the chemically exfoliated graphene-like MoS2 significantly enlarged the lattice fringe spacing from 0.62 nm to 0.98 nm and exhibited an enhanced discharge capacity (115.9 mA h g−1) and cycling stability (after 50 cycles, the capacity still remains at 82.5 mA h g−1) compared to exfoliated MoS2 (55.5 mA h g−1 in the 1st cycle and quickly decreased to 13.9 mA h g−1 in the 30th cycle at 20 mA g−1).278
Overall, interlayer space has been highly emphasized in Na and Mg ion batteries. But the methods developed for enlarging the interlayer space seem to be limited. Furthermore, we believe that, besides the interlayer space, the surface properties and structure of 1T-containing MoS2 could contribute greatly to their battery performance as well and thus should be paid more research attention.

5.6 Spintronic devices (ferromagnetism)
Spintronic devices require the integration of semiconductors and magnetic materials so that information can be sensed, stored, processed, and transferred in a nonvolatile fashion. Bulk 2H MoS2 is intrinsically nonmagnetic as the Mo4+ ions are in a trigonal prismatic local coordination where the two Mo 4d electrons are in a spin-antiparallel coordination and the net magnetic moment is zero.122 However, spin-polarization can be observed in zigzag edges and grain boundaries of monolayer MoS2 nanosheets, implying the potential applications of MoS2 in spintronic devices.279 So far, much effort has been made to induce ferromagnetism to TMDs, including doping transition metals,280,281 creating strain and vacancies,93 and changing the layer thickness to create unsaturated bonds.282 Along with these treatments, the 1T phase of MoS2, which is intrinsically ferromagnetic, could be partially formed and played a key role according to recent research.121,122 Cai et al. obtained 1T@2H MoS2 nanosheets with ∼25% 1T phase and sulfur vacancies (Vs) through a two-step hydrothermal process and demonstrated their ferromagnetic properties.122 The as-synthesized 1T@2H MoS2 showed a Curie temperature of 395 K and a robust intrinsic ferromagnetic response of 0.25 μB/Mo at 300 K (room temperature) and 0.35 μB/Mo at 0 K, as suggested by its magnetization (M–T) curves against temperature under zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) modes(Fig. 21a) and magnetization curves (M–H) as a function of the applied magnetic field H at 5 and 300 K (Fig. 21b). The magnetic response is supposed to be intimately correlated with the strengthened Mo4+–Vs exchange interactions based on the EPR results. Similarly, treating the original 2H single-layer MoS2 with Ar or O2 to create Vs on the flakes or at the edge respectively resulted in partial conversion of 2H MoS2 to its 1T counterpart and induction of magnetic ordering (Fig. 21c).121 However, because of the difference in location, the Vs-1T correlation in the Ar-treated and O2-treated sample was distinct from each other and thus led to different electrical and magnetic properties. While the magnetic response in the O2-treated sample is superior, it showed inferior performance to FETs. The paramagnetic properties of 1T@2H MoS2 nanoscrolls (MNs) fabricated via a chemical approach where MoS2 nanosheets rolled up at room temperature and 4 K were also reported as shown in Fig. 21d.132

By doping with Re, a robust ferromagnetic 1T@2H structure could be obtained.283 This generation of net magnetic moments was caused by the formation of 1T-coordinated Mo and the existence of doped 1T Re in the 1T MoS2 with the latter playing a dominant role. While both the magnetism and the 1T ratio of Re increased with the increasing amount of doped Re, the 1T ratio in MoS2 will rise to a saturation value of ∼50% when the Re concentration reached ∼17%, when the maximum magnetism (8 memu g−1) was achieved (Fig. 21e and f). More importantly, the 1T-induced magnetism was thermally stable with the presence of doped Re.
Apparently, according to current studies, the ferromagnetism generates along with the formation of 1T MoS2. The simultaneous formation of sulfur vacancies or some dopants is also of essence. Studies on understanding the contributing factors to the origin of the magnetism is required to make this property more manipulatable.
5.7 Field-effect transistors
Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on ultrathin MoS2 (1–10 layers) channels have been widely investigated because of their large on/off ratios and near-theoretical subthreshold swing values.15,284,285 Contact resistance is a vital problem in ultrathin MoS2 devices as Schottky barriers for electron injection exist between MoS2 and the metal layer, which makes the performance of MoS2 FETs strongly rely on the metal used for source and drain electrodes.286,287 Selecting low-work-function metals with energy levels close to the conduction band of MoS2 is commonly attempted to improve the device performance to reduce the contact resistance.286 Alternatively, Kappera et al. achieved a low-resistance in MoS2 FETs by locally patterning the metallic 1T phase on ultrathin semiconducting MoS2 nanosheets (mechanically exfoliated, 2–3 layers, obtained from SPI) and depositing the metal (Au) on the top of the 1T phase.59 Because the work function of the 1T phase and the conduction band energy relative to the vacuum level of the 2H phase are similar (∼4.2 eV) and an atomically sharp interface between the phases could be formed (Fig. 22a and b), the resistance of 1T contacts (0.2 kΩ μm) is ∼5 times lower than that of 2H with Au (1.1 kΩ μm) at zero gate bias (Fig. 22c–f) and a further decrease occurred at a gate bias of +30 V (inset of Fig. 22f). This low resistance is even superior to that of the current state-of-the-art metal/silicon contacts in CMOS technology (0.3–0.5 kΩ μm).

Copyright 2014 American Institute of Physics. 
The transfer characteristics of the bottom- and top-gated devices with and without 1T phase electrodes (Fig. 22g and h) revealed that the saturation currents with 1T phase electrodes are approximately three times and more than three times higher than that with Au electrodes in bottom- and top-gated devices, respectively. The gate modulations of the 1T channels in both devices were large with on/off ratios >106. The drive currents achieved in bottom-up devices with 1T electrodes is 85 μA μm−1 while the value is 30 μA μm−1 for devices with Au pads deposited directly on the 2H phase. The FET properties measured in air without any encapsulation layer suggest enhanced field-effect mobility of the 1T phase electrode devices (∼50 cm2 V−1 s−1) over that of the 2H contacts (∼15–20 cm2 V−1 s−1), close to what was reported by Fang et al. in their recent work.288 In top-gated devices, the 1T electrode also exhibited substantially advanced performance with the saturation currents 16 vs. 3 μA μm−1 and mobility values ∼12–15 vs. 3–5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The inferior properties of top-gated devices compared to bottom-gated ones were due to the absence of overlap between the gate electrode and source/drain. Furthermore, the performance of the 1T electrode device is highly reproducible and independent of the type of contact metal pad used. The excellent performance of the devices with the 1T electrode could be attributed to the absence of structural and electrical mismatch.
Similar results could be obtained by phase engineering based on chemical vapor deposited monolayer MoS2 with dimensions of tens of micrometers (Fig. 22i).84 After implanting the 1T phase as source and drain electrodes, a contact resistance of ∼200 Ω μm could be obtained. And a high mobility value of 56 cm2 V−1 s−1, an exceptionally large state current of 110 μA μm−1, and a subthreshold swing value of 0.72 V dec−1 were achieved, which are even more advanced than those of the material derived from the mechanically exfoliated MoS2.
In addition, it was found that the subthreshold swing values (which depend on the channel capacitance, the capacitance of the dielectric, and capacitance from interface charges) for both bottom- and top-gated devices with 1T electrodes were lower than those with Au directly contacted with the 2H phase MoS2. This could be caused by the lower interface trap density, the shorter actual channel length and the fact that the source and drain electrodes are side contacts rather than vertical contacts in the 1T phase devices.59
For this specific application which utilizes ultra-thin MoS2, these in situ phase tuning approaches like electron injection and Ar plasma should be efficient, but have not been fully studied. More investigation could be conducted using these in situ strategies in the future for a controllable design of FET devices with advanced performance.
5.8 Memristors
A memristor, short for the memory resistor, is a two-terminal device with an internal resistance that changes based on the history of applied external voltage and current.289,290 As the fourth fundamental passive circuit elements discovered after the resistor, the capacitor and the inductor, it was theoretically predicted by Chua in 1971 (ref. 289) and experimentally realized in a metal/oxide/metal (Pt/TiO2/Pt) structure in 2008 by Strukov et al.290 Integrated circuits with memristors and memristive systems show applications in various area including ultradense, semi-non-volatile memory storage, neuromorphic computing, logic operations and learning networks that require a synapse-like function.291–293 State-of-the-art memristors are based on metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structures with an oxide layer such as TiO2 sandwiched between metal contacts.294 Sangwan et al. were the first to show memristors based on grain boundaries in monolayer MoS2 (synthesized on SiO2 by the CVD method).295 The phase-dependence memristive phenomenon of MoS2 was revealed by our group later.36 The device is constructed by spin-coating MoS2 on Ag foil and further deposited with a thin layer of silver paste on top of MoS2, as shown in Fig. 23a. While the device with 2H bulk MoS2 only possessed an ohmic feature, the one with 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets exhibited a unique memristive behavior due to voltage-dependent resistance change (Fig. 23b). During a continuous sweeping of a bias voltage from 0 mV → 200 mV → −200 mV → 0 mV, an asymmetric pinched hysteresis loop could be obtained with an OFF-to-ON (high resistance to low resistance) alternation at a bias voltage of 66 mV and a back-to-OFF switch at −98 mV. The currents at the ON and OFF states are with three orders of magnitude and the device also showed a high stability with negligible change after 1000 cycles of ON/OFF tests. This difference between 2H bulk MoS2 and 1T MoS2 could be due to the fact that the 1T structure is less stable and can be varied by electrons. When the external electrical field reached a high intensity, a lattice distortion could appear to enhance the delocalization of electrons which would significantly increase the conductivity of the material.

Furthermore, to achieve an ideal memristor with symmetric switches, a structure consisting of Ag/MoS2/Ag/MoS2/Ag layers was innovatively fabricated (Fig. 23c). Sweeping from 0 mV → 1000 mV → −1000 mV → 0 mV, the device successfully exhibited a symmetric pinched hysteresis I–V loop as shown Fig. 23d. The device also showed high stability as confirmed by 1000-time cycling sweeping.
MoS2 with hybrid 1T and 2H phases obtained by a simple ball-milling method also possessed unique memristive behaviors.37 The I–V curves of MoS2 ball-milled for 2 h (MoS2-bm-2h) and 10 h (MoS2-bm-10h) are shown in Fig. 23e and f, respectively. The switching voltages for ON and OFF states were 95 and −26 mV for MoS2-bm-2h and 77 and −39 mV for MoS2-bm-10h. This difference stems from the different amounts of 1T phase in the two samples. MoS2-bm-10h possessed a higher ratio of 1T phase MoS2 and thus more conductive and required lower bias voltage to induce a lattice distortion (transform into the ON state) but a higher bias voltage to recover the distortion (transform into the OFF state).
With the current work, the great potential of MoS2, especially 1T MoS2, for memristive devices has been revealed. This application of 1T MoS2 could be further developed using in situ phase engineering strategies and the functioning mechanism should be studied for further optimization of the devices.
5.9 Dye-sensitized solar cells
A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a photovoltaic device usually composed of a TiO2 photoanode with adsorbed dye, an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte (mostly redox mediator of iodide/triiodide), and a counter electrode to reduce I3−.296 Platinum is the most efficient counter electrode but its application is limited by its scarcity and high cost. So far, in order to find an economic alternative to Pt, a large number of materials have been studied, including conducting polymers,297,298 carbonaceous materials,299,300 alloy compounds,301,302 and inorganic compounds.303–305 Among the inorganic compounds, MoS2 (the widely existing 2H phase) has received great attention because of its outstanding performance for I3− reduction.306 As conductivity is also essential for the cell performance of DSCs, hybrid structures with MoS2 (2H) and carbon materials have been widely studied.305,307,308 The discovery of 1T-phase MoS2 with its high conductivity offers a new strategy for the utilization of MoS2 as a DSSC counter electrode. Using a FTO substrate with in situ grown 1T MoS2 as a DSSC counter electrode, a short-circuit current density (Isc) of 18.76 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a fill factor (ff) of 0.52, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.08% under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 could be obtained.7 The conversion efficiency is 3 times higher than that (1.72%) of the DSSC with a 2H MoS2 counter electrode (Fig. 24a). When combined both types of MoS2 respectively with hollow carbon spheres (HCS) to form 1T MoS2@HCS and 2H MoS2@HCS nanostructures, the power conversion efficiency with 2H MoS2 increased to 8.16% while that of 1T MoS2 was only 0.17% higher (8.94%) (Fig. 24b). The dramatically decreased difference in power conversion efficiencies suggested that the main advantage of 1T MoS2 over advanced DSSCs was its superior conductivity.8 On the other hand, the fact that the activity of 1T MoS2@HCS was still a little higher than that of 2H MoS@HCS and approached that of Pt indicated the favorability of 1T MoS2 for usage in DSSCs. And further modification of 1T MoS2 with elemental doping or structure tuning may enhance the performance of DSSCs.

5.10 Photodetector
Photodetectors, as an important optoelectronic device, rely on the conversion of absorbed photons into electrical signals. A high photoresponsivity is very important for the application of the device as well as a high on/off ratio. The application of TMDs like MoS2 has attracted a great amount of attention due its intriguing electric and optical properties and a potential substitution for graphene which has been commonly used in photodetectors but with unneglectable problems including a high dark state current and short life time if photo-excited carriers induced by the semimetallic nature of graphene.309,310
Compared to 2H monolayer MoS2, monolayer MoS2 with the 1T phase generates a much higher total photocurrent when applied in an optoelectronic device. Yamaguchi et al. examined the effect of local phase transformation (2H into 1T) of MoS2 underneath the metal electrodes in optoelectronic devices with the assistance of scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) (Fig. 25a).47 The 2H phase of MoS2 possesses a band gap and thus a larger amount of photo-excited charge. But, due to the large Schottky battier at the contacts, the active region of a 2H device was very narrow with only the electrons in the vicinity of the electrodes being effective for the current generation (Fig. 25b). In contrast, the active area broadened over the entire area on 1T monolayer MoS2 contacted devices as the Schottky barrier height was greatly reduced (from ∼200 meV down to a few meV) for the metallic nature of this material (Fig. 25c). In the dark, a typical rectifying behavior resulted from the Schottky barriers formed at the contacts was observed for 2H devices, in contrast to a linear increase of the current level for 1T devices (Fig. 25d). When the applied bias (Vsd) was zero, the total photocurrent of the 2H devices was larger than that of the 1T devices (Fig. 25e), whereas, with a low bias, photocurrents more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the 2H ones were obtained for the 1T devices along with a significantly high responsivity (Fig. 25f), implying the great potential of 1T MoS2 in application for optoelectronic devices.

However, the on-off ratio of 1T MoS2 is relatively low due to the high dark state current. Wang et al. fabricated hybrid devices (Fig. 25g) with organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) and 2D MoS2.311 The influence of both metallic 1T MoS2 obtained via a chemical exfoliation approach and semiconducting 2H MoS2 synthesized by annealing 1T MoS2 at 300 °C in a vacuum or argon for 2 h on the performance of hybrid photodetectors was examined. Consistent with the investigations of Yamaguchi et al.,47 the hybrid 1T-MoS2/CH3NH3PbI3 showed typical linear and symmetrical plots of dark current and photocurrent versus voltage due to a lower resistance. And the 1T phase hybrid photodetector exhibits a responsivity of 3096 A W−1 and an EQE of 7.7 × 105%, comparable to that of perovskite-graphene hybrid312,313 and single crystal perovskite photodetectors.314,315 However, as shown in Fig. 25h and i, while the change of currents with the 2H contacted devices in the dark and under irradiation was obvious, the on/off ratios of the devices with 1T-MoS2 were relatively low due to the high base current in the dark, especially when it possessed multiple layers, making them impractical for integrated circuit devices, in spite of their exceptionally high responsivity.
In fact, through careful engineering, 1T phase MoS2 could be well applied in optoelectronic devices including photodetectors. As demonstrated in Wang's work,311 by decreasing the layer and coverage of 1T MoS2, the on/off ratio of the corresponding devices could be increased. The contradiction between a high responsivity and a favorable on/off ratio could also be alleviated by fabricating a 1T and 2H hybrid with precisely controlled phase sites.59,84 Furthermore, strategies like covalent functionalization of 1T MoS2 can be used to partially alter the 1T phase from metallic to semiconducting and provide new opportunities for 1T MoS2 in photonic and optoelectronic devices.89
5.11 Other applications
Besides the applications mentioned above, 1T and 1T containing MoS2 have also been studied in many other fields. Chou and coworkers demonstrated the effectiveness of chemically exfoliated MoS2 (1T ratio >80%), as a near infra-red (NIR) photothermal agent.316 While the NIR photocurrent response of mechanically exfoliated MoS2 was negligible,317 the 1T dominated few-layer MoS2 obtained by lithium intercalation exfoliation, though with poor crystallinity, showed an NIR absorbance with an extinction coefficient of 29.2 L g−1 cm−1 at 800 nm, which was ∼7.8 times that of GO, twice that of gold nanorods (13.9 L g−1 cm−1) and comparable to that of rGO (24.6 L g−1 cm−1).318 This outstanding photothermal properties of the 1T dominated MoS2, along with its hydrophilicity and a biomolecular protein loading capacity approaching that of GO (the current best-in-class material319), endows this material with great potential for application in a wide range of areas involving photothermal ablation therapy and solar paints and coatings. The photothermal effect of 1T MoS2 has to be confirmed by more experimental trials and the mechanism for the photothermal effect needs to be revealed.
In direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), suitable systems for power generation in the field of electro-traction,320 chemically exfoliated 1T MoS2 (ce-MoS2) could play a role as a support for noble catalysts. Yuwen et al. used ce-MoS2 deposited with noble metals (Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt) as an electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation in alkaline media and found that Pd deposited MoS2 nanosheets showed the highest potential for application in DMFCs with their anodic peak current mass density 2.8 times that of a commercial Pd/C catalyst.88 The advanced electrochemical performance for methanol oxidation depended greatly on the synergistic contribution of the catalytic activity of the noble metal nanocrystals and the partially metallic trait of ce-MoS2 which significantly enhanced the conductivity, lowering the charge-transfer resistance. And it can be expected that a further improvement of 1T MoS2 may lead to an even better performance in this reaction.
Recently, the popularity of the 1T phase of TMDs also extended to the field of electrochemical biosensors because of their intriguing properties including their large surface area, fast heterogeneous electron-transfer (HET) rate (good electrical conductivity) and prominent electrocatalytic capabilities.106,321 The existence of 1T MTDs could greatly promote the response of both enzymatic biosensors for indirect electrochemical detection (via an enzymatic inhibition pathway) of fenitrothion, an organophosphate pesticide,321 and second generation glucose biosensors106 mainly attributed to the enhanced HET rate. According to current investigations,106,321 1T dominated WS2 and WSe2 outperformed their molybdenum counterparts (MoS2 and MoSe2) in this application. And in-depth studies are still lacking to understand the underlying reasons as well as the functioning mechanism.
5.12 Concluding remarks on the applications of 1T MoS2

Among these applications, the most studied one is the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), taking advantage of its abundant active sites both at the edge and on the basal plane and an efficient electron transfer ability. A series of strategies have been attempted to improve both the activity and stability of 1T MoS2 for the HER and even the overall water splitting. Nevertheless, the possible change of the 1T phase during electrochemical tests was not examined in detail, while the distortion of the 1T structure was observed when used as a photo-cocatalyst in the first few hours. For energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, the most intriguing traits of 1T MoS2 are its excellent conductivity and enlarged interlayer space. However, not all the 1T MoS2 materials synthesized are pure enough to be highly metallic. Nor can the interlayer spaces being satisfactorily large. In other words, the requirements for the quality of 1T MoS2 in energy storage areas are relatively critical. Besides, a distinct and irreversible first cycle in lithium/sodium ion batteries with 1T MoS2 due to a chemical change of this material has been widely observed but a consensus explanation is still lacking. Spintronic devices utilized the ferromagnetic properties of 1T MoS2 while field effect transistors rely on the low contact resistance induced by the metallic nature of 1T MoS2. The successful application of 1T MoS2 in dye sensitized solar cells and memristors additionally revealed its I3− reduction ability and unique memristive electronic behavior. When applied in optoelectronic devices like photodetectors, despite a high overall responsivity, its large current in the dark made the 1T rich MoS2 material impractical, suggesting that proper phase engineering to keep an optimal concentration of 1T phase or functionalization to induce semiconducting sites is needed. In addition, the photothermal effect of 1T MoS2 has been proven. All of the practices provide a solid reference for other potential applications. In spite of the emerging practices, the exploration of 1T MoS2 for function in diverse systems is still in its early stage, great efforts are desired to understand the kinetics of the different processes with 1T MoS2 and to maximize the roles of the 1T structure (either by enhancing the purity or synergizing with other phases or other compounds).
6. Conclusions
The 1T metallic phase of MoS2 with distinct properties compared to the commonly used semiconducting 2H MoS2 shows potential for application in various areas. Although 1T MoS2 was synthesized early in 1992, wide research interest in this special material has just risen in the past few years. This review offers a comprehensive image of the state-of-the-art of 1T MoS2 in terms of the synthesis methods and applications. Strategies for stabilizing 1T MoS2 are also specifically discussed because of the poor stability of commonly obtained 1T MoS2 after long-term storage or thermal treatment.
So far more than a dozen of methods have been successfully developed and can be broadly divided into two categories, i.e. top-down and bottom-up approaches. Chemical intercalation exfoliation with alkali metals is the most-widely used top-down method to obtain 1T MoS2. The resultant 1T ratio can reach up to 90% with mostly single-layer MoS2. But it is dangerous with risky precursors and time-consuming as well as tedious procedures. Electrochemical intercalation exfoliation is able to accelerate the process and manipulate the intercalation degree, making the fabrication of 1T MoS2 nanodots possible. But it is limited by its small scale and the other disadvantages of chemical intercalation methods. Super-critical (SC) CO2 assisted and microwave-assisted exfoliation approaches are more environmentally friendly and the maximum percentage of 1T achieved by SC CO2-assisted exfoliation could be similar to that of MoS2 obtained by chemical intercalation exfoliation. Ball milling, introducing sulfur vacancies and strain controlling could realize a partial 2H-to-1T phase transition for bulk MoS2 as well but the efficiency and the final ratio of 1T are still not comparable to those of the exfoliation approaches. More efforts can be made to further improve these facile strategies. For tuning the phase of monolayer MoS2, Ar plasma, chemical vapour and electron injection (like electron beams and hot electrons) are helpful. Especially, with Ar plasma and electron beams, the area for phase transition can be elaborately controlled, making them very helpful for mechanism study and fabrication of some monolayer MoS2 devices with special phase distribution. Unlike top-down methods that use existing 2H MoS2 as the precursor, bottom-up approaches obtain 1T MoS2 or hybrid 2H–1T MoS2 from cheaper raw precursors. The synthesis of bulk 1T MoS2 could be achieved with an oxidation method, which was not possible by any top-down approaches. The bulk MoS2 showed super conductivity but its application has not been fully explored. Using hydrothermal methods, MoS2 with a range of 1T ratios, various morphologies and different properties can be obtained by tuning the reaction parameters including the composition of precursors, additives, hydrothermal temperature and solvents. Besides, it is easy to handle. Thus, the hydrothermal synthesis route is very popular for synthesizing 1T-containing MoS2 and compositions of 1T-containing MoS2 and other compounds. Integrating 1T MoS2 with other compounds and growing it on suitable substrates are popular ways to improve the stability of the 1T octahedral structure. Other strategies to stabilize the 1T phase of MoS2 include the intercalation of metal ions, doping of metals like Co and Re, and functionalization with organic groups. However, the enhancement in stability may come along with performance decrease of MoS2 in various applications for the change of surface properties and distortion of the lattice. Thus, this trade-off between the activity and stability of 1T MoS2 has to be dealt with very carefully. Future studies on 1T MoS2 have to pay more attention to achieving a high activity along with a high stability.
Just in the past few years, the superiority of 1T MoS2 has been revealed in a series of applications. Thanks to its abundant active sites both at the edges and on the planes and its high conductivity, it shows much enhanced HER performance compared to its 2H counterpart. Because of this, it can be used as an efficient cocatalyst for photoelectrocatalytic reactions and room-temperature catalysis as well. With conductivity and well-aligned layered structures, energy devices like supercapacitors, Li/Na/Mg ion batteries and Li–S batteries with 1T MoS2 also outperform those with 2H MoS2. And the performance (both activity and stability) of 1T MoS2 in these areas can be further promoted by a number of modifications including structure tuning, doping, intercalating, combining with organic compounds, forming composites with conductive materials etc. The decent performances of 1T-containing MoS2 in spintronic devices, field-effect transistors, dye-sensitized solar cells, NIR photothermal agents, and direct methanol fuel cells have also been demonstrated. But as all the applications of 1T-containing MoS2 in these areas are still in an early stage, the underlying functioning mechanism remains to be elucidated and the performance could be further improved when taking more factors into consideration.
We believe, with the joint efforts of the researchers in the related areas, a mature manipulation of the synthesis, stabilization, and properties for various applications of 1T MoS2 could be achieved in the near future.
