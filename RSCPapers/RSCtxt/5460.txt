    , Accepted 6th March 2015First published on 9th March 2015AbstractFerroelectric solar cells based on ferroelectric oxides have attracted significant attention owing to many unique advantages, such as the switchable photocurrent and photovoltage, and the above bandgap open circuit voltages. However, the small photocurrent densities of the typical ferroelectric solar cells greatly limit their photovoltaic performance. In this report, we experimentally revealed the polarization switching properties of inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites and developed ferroelectric solar cells based on the hybrid perovskites. Hybrid perovskite methylammonium lead trihalide (MAPbX3) thin films exhibited 180° domain phase switching and polarization hysteresis loops. Ferroelectric solar cells based on the mixed halide MAPbI3−xClx thin film demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of 6.7% and the ferroelectric solar cells display switchable photovoltaic effects. This work provides an alternative but exhilarating solution for high-performance ferroelectric solar cells beyond inorganic ferroelectric oxides.
To harvest clean and renewable solar energy, in the past several decades, the research trend has been towards exploring novel materials and photovoltaic mechanisms to achieve higher efficiency in solar cells.1–6 Since the discovery of photovoltaic effects in ferroelectric materials over 50 years ago,7–9 ferroelectric solar cells (FESC) have attracted significant attention owing to many unique advantages. Different from the p–n diode or Schottky diode photovoltaic (PV) devices, whose charge separations are heavily determined by the intrinsic built-in electric fields, in the FESC, ferroelectric polarization plays a dominant role in charge separation and transport.10–12 FESC can provide changeable directions of photocurrent and photo-voltage by polarization switching, and also generate above bandgap open circuit voltages.13–17 These proprieties render FESC a promising candidate in solar-energy conversion. So far, ferroelectric solar cells based on several inorganic ferroelectric oxide thin films have been studied, including BiFeO3,18–21 Pb(Zr, Ti)O3,22–24 BaTiO3,25,26 (PbLa)(Zr, Ti)O3,27 KBiFe2O5,28 [KNbO3]1−x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3−δ]x,29 and Bi2FeCrO6.30,31 However, the photocurrent densities under AM 1.5G solar illumination for most FESCs are very small, generally on the order of μA cm−2 or nA cm−2, which greatly limit their photovoltaic performance with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) below 2%.10–29 The small photocurrent densities are usually ascribed to the wide bandgap, poor light absorption coefficient, small charge carrier diffusion length, or low charge collection efficiency.10–19 A breakthrough in the field of FESC occurred through the recent study on Bi2FeCrO6, which exhibited both small bandgap (1.4–1.6 eV) and large photocurrent density (11.7 mA cm−2) to yield the PCE as high as 3.3%.31 Moreover, stacking of three layers of Bi2FeCrO6 with different bandgaps greatly improved the PCE to 8.1%.31 Besides the inorganic ferroelectric oxides, organic ferroelectric materials (such as P(VDF–TrFE)) have also been exploited to promote the charge separation and thereby enhance the PCE of solar cells.32–35 However, substantial efforts are still needed to improve FESC's performance; more economical materials and device fabrication approaches for high efficiency FESC should be developed for practical and reliable applications.
In the past five years, a new emerging class of perovskite PV materials, inorganic–organic methylammonium lead trihalide MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3,36–40 have demonstrated unprecedented high power conversion efficiency due to the suitable bandgap (1.55 eV),41–44 superior light absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1),45–48 and large electron–hole diffusion lengths (over 100 nm).49–51 Interestingly, ferroelectric domains have been proposed to exist in the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite from both experimental result and computational calculation.52–58 Even though the space group for MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3 is centrosymmetric tetragonal I4/mcm,53 the orientational order of CH3NH3+ dipoles can influence the magnitude of bulk polarization;56,57 as a result, the molecular CH3NH3+ dipoles can reduce the lattice symmetry to quasi I4cm with noncentrosymmetric structure and have ferroelectric properties.56 Rappe et al. reported a strong bulk polarization in MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3 from first-principles density functional theory calculations, and they further explored the energies and electronic structures of domain walls in MAPbCl3, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 thin films.57,58 Padture et al. experimentally observed the ferroelectric domain in the MAPbI3 perovskite thin films by piezoresponse force microscopy.52 This ferroelectric effect offers the opportunity for tuning and utilizing the polarization electric field in inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites for improving the performance of the FESC.
In this report, we study the ferroelectric switching properties of methylammonium lead trihalide (MAPbX3) thin films and propose the ferroelectric solar cells based on the inorganic–organic MAPbX3 perovskite. MAPbI3−xClx, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 thin films all exhibited 180° domain phase switching and polarization hysteresis loops. The polarization states of the ferroelectric methylammonium lead trihalide light absorber show close relationship with the performance of FESCs. The ferroelectric solar cells based on the TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/Au structure demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 6.7%. Symmetrical switchable PV effects were achieved from symmetric FESC with a Au/MAPbX3/Au configuration.
Ferroelectric effects of the mixed halide MAPbI3−xClx thin films were first investigated by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). When a biased alternating voltage is applied to the sample surface, the piezoelectric sample will respond by either volume expansion or contraction according to the converse piezoelectric effect. This response can be used to map out the piezoelectric phase (domain configuration) and amplitude (piezoelectric response) of the specimen accordingly. We investigated the piezoelectric nature of an as-grown MAPbI3−xClx thin film with a thickness of ∼250 nm (Fig. 1). The PFM phase image clearly demonstrates the strong contrast with bright–dark areas, indicating upward–downward oriented domains (Fig. 1b). This observation indicates the existence of a significant magnitude of spontaneous polarization across the as-grown MAPbI3−xClx thin films.

(d–f) show the PFM phase image after electric poling of the sample at +5 V, −5 V, and +5 V, respectively, and the corresponding topology is shown in Fig. S2.† The scale bar is 200 nm. 
To further investigate the polarization switching behavior, positive and negative DC voltage was applied alternately across the sample prior to the piezoresponse phase mapping, as shown in Fig. 1d–f. After electric poling at +5 V DC bias voltage, most of the domains aligned upwards (Fig. 1d). An obvious switching of the domain direction was observed after further poling at −5 V bias voltage. Subsequently, the sample was again poled with +5 V, and the dominant domains switched back to upward direction, indicating the reversibility and repeatability of electric-field-induced polarization. In order to better quantify the switching capability, the sample was poled at selected locations on the film surface by applying DC tip bias during scanning, as shown in Fig. 1c. A sharp 180° phase change in the PFM phase coupled with the dip in the PFM amplitude occurs at coercive voltage (VC) with a magnitude of ±0.5 V. This indicates that the coercive field for the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite is ∼20 kV cm−1. The observation of clear hysteresis loops suggests that the material is highly polarizable and the ferroelectric domains can be switched through external applied field. The bulk hysteresis was also measured by the polarization electric field loop on the Au/MAPbI3−xClx/Au structure (Fig. S3†), and it demonstrated leakage characteristics, which might be due to the relatively high conductivity of the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite. This typical effect of leakage current has also been observed in other ferroelectric solar cells.21,22
Building upon the PFM studies, we propose a ferroelectric photovoltaic device based on MAPbI3−xClx thin films with configuration TiO2/FE/Au, where FE denotes MAPbI3−xClx (Fig. 2). When the FE layer is in its pristine state (Fig. 2a), due to the work function mismatch between FE and Au, it forms a Schottky barrier diode at the FE/Au interface. On the other side, the compact TiO2 thin layer serves as the n-type electron-transport layer (ETL), and a narrow n-FE junction is created at the TiO2/FE interface with smaller work function mismatch than the FE/Au interface. It should be noted that the FE layer shows strong semiconducting properties, which were recently revealed by the electron beam-induced current measurement.59 Under light illumination, the TiO2/pristine-FE/Au structure would demonstrate a PV behavior. The open circuit voltage (VOC) would be representative of the intrinsic built-in electric filed (Ebi) from both the Schottky diode and the n-FE junction. Ferroelectric polarization electric field (EP) can change the width of the depletion regions inside the FE layer, which would be expected to regulate the separation of photo-generated charges.
 Fig. 2  Schematics of electronic band structure for ferroelectric solar cells based on MAPbI3−xClx under different polarization conditions: (a) without poling, (b) after positive poling, and (c) after negative poling. 
When FE is positively poled (ETL side is grounded), negative ferroelectric charges appear in the FE layer on the Au side and positive charges appear on the ETL side. Such ferroelectric polarization leads to the increase of the width of depletion regions in the FE layer (W1+ and W2+) and enlarges the band bending at both FE/Au and n-FE interfaces (Fig. 2b). As a result, a boosting of VOC and JSC would be observed due to additional band bending and better charge separation. And a higher PV efficiency is expected without introducing any extra layer such as the expensive hole-transport layer (e.g. spiro-OMeTAD)!36–40 When the FE layer is negatively poled, as shown in Fig. 2c, the band bending at both interfaces would be reduced and even reversed if large enough polarization is developed. Considering that the driving force for charge separation comes from both Ebi and EP, for a first-order approximation, we have: VOC+ = Vbi + Vp(1) VOC− = Vbi − Vp(2)where VOC+ and VOC− denote the open circuit voltage for FESC after positive poling and negative poling, respectively; Vbi represents the overall band bending potential in the FE layer due to built-in electric field at both interfaces; and Vp comes from the switchable polarization component. If EP is larger than Ebi at an interface, reverse band bending would occur at this interface leading to a switching of the PV diode polarity. Apparently, a substantial Vp, being the major driving force for charge separation in such FESC, would dictate the absolute value of energy conversion efficiency.
Following the concept described in Fig. 2, we experimentally proceed to the FESC device as shown in Fig. 3. The device was composed of a 60 nm compact TiO2 (cp-TiO2) layer, a 250 nm ferroelectric MAPbI3−xClx light absorber and a 100 nm Au top electrode. The corresponding photovoltaic performance of the FESC under different polarization conditions is shown in Fig. 3b. The performance of the solar cell based on as-grown MAPbI3−xClx thin films exhibited poor PV performance with VOC = 0.37 V, JSC = 1.47 mA cm−2, FF = 16.94%, and PCE = 0.09%. After conducting the +2 V poling process, the photovoltaic performance was significantly enhanced to 6.7%. The VOC increased to 0.72 V, JSC jumped to 18.53 mA cm−2, and FF increased to 50.24%. The increase of PCE by 74 times and increase of JSC by 12 times after positive poling suggest the absolutely dominant role of polarization electric field in MAPbI3−xClx in enabling efficient charge separation and transport. On the other hand, the photovoltaic performance was greatly suppressed after −2 V negative poling of the device, where the VOC is switched to a negative value (−0.12 V). These observations match with our proposed mechanism in Fig. 2. According to the given eqn (1) and (2), 0.84 V difference of VOC between the positively poled and negatively poled FESC gives rise to a Vp of 0.42 V, which is consistent with the coercive voltage (VC ∼ 0.5 V) for polarization switching.

For an ideal FESC that operates only based on the polarization electric field, both its photocurrent and photo-voltage should be switchable, and J–V curves under positive and negative poling should exhibit symmetry behavior. Although we did observe that the output current and voltage could be switched in the solar cell mentioned above, they were not symmetrical. This can be simply explained by the asymmetric structure of the FESC device described here. Based upon this understanding, we designed two more cell structures (FTO/MAPbI3−xClx/Au and Au/MAPbI3−xClx/Au) to demonstrate the tuning capability of the electrodes on the symmetry of the J–V characteristics in the FESC.
The FTO/MAPbI3−xClx/Au structure was proposed for the FESC with an electrode/FE/electrode configuration. Due to the incomplete surface coverage of a MAPbI3−xClx thin film on a FTO/glass substrate,36,44,60 the top Au electrode can make direct contact with the bottom FTO electrode of the FESC device, which could short circuit the cell and screen the photovoltaic effect. To avoid this problem, we introduced a 125 nm mesoporous-Al2O3 layer (mp-Al2O3) between FTO and MAPbI3−xClx to develop a high coverage MAPbI3−xClx film on the FTO substrate.44 The ferroelectric film first fills the mp-Al2O3 layer and the excess MAPbI3−xClx forms a 210 nm capping layer on top of mp-Al2O3 as shown in Fig. 4a. The band diagram for FESC based on the insulating mp-Al2O3 for a FTO/MAPbI3−xClx/Au cell is shown in Fig. S6.† FTO is a highly doped n-type semiconductor and has a similar Fermi level as TiO2. Therefore, similar to that of the TiO2/FE/Au structure, band bending in MAPbI3−xClx on the FTO side is a n-FE structure and band bending on the Au side is a Schottky barrier for the pristine FE state (Fig. S6a† or dashed line in Fig. 4b). The as-grown FESC on mp-Al2O3 shows small photovoltaic performance with a VOC equal to 0.35 V (Fig. 4c). After positive poling, band bending should become enhanced at both ends with large depletion regions (red line in Fig. 4b), and a better PV performance was achieved with a VOC+ value of 0.72 V. Negative poling leads to alignment of domains that negates the built-in field (Fig. S6c†). Most FE polarization should be used to counter the original band bending and the leftover FE charges (if there is) finally reverse the band bending at both interfaces. Indeed, experimentally the VOC− value under negative poling case is only −0.11 V. The difference between VOC+ and VOC− leads to Vp = 0.415 V and Vbi = 0.305 V for FESC with a FTO/mp-Al2O3/MAPbI3−xClx/Au structure. This structure perfectly reproduces our findings in the TiO2/FE/Au device and its PV behavior is consistent with our concept. The asymmetric J–V characteristics arise from the asymmetric structure and their associated asymmetric band bending.

For the development of a symmetric FESC, we fabricated a FESC device based on the Au/MAPbI3−xClx/Au configuration. Between the mp-Al2O3 and FTO substrate, a 30 nm Au thin film was added to serve as the bottom electrode; the stack structure of FESC is thus FTO/Au/mp-Al2O3/MAPbI3−xClx/Au (Fig. 4d). According to our previous model, different from the FESC structures in Fig. 3a and 4a, the Au/FE/Au would yield a symmetric PV diode performance. Without poling, the Au/FE/Au has symmetric Schottky barriers on both sides (dashed line in Fig. 4e or S7a†), which will cancel each other out and show negligible effect on the whole device. When FE is positively poled, the left-side band bending in FE would be reduced and even reversed, whereas the right-side band bending would be enhanced (red line in Fig. 4e or S7b†). Overall, we have a possible Ohmic contact on the left side and an enhanced Schottky contact on the right side. Similarly, when FE is negatively poled, the left side forms a stronger Schottky contact and the right side forms a possible Ohmic contact, and we expect a performance similar to that under positive poling. Experimentally, as shown in Fig. 4f, the FESC demonstrated switchable photovoltaic effects: VOC is 0.44 V and JSC is 5.90 mA cm−2 under positive poling; VOC is −0.45 V and JSC is −5.71 mA cm−2 under negative poling. These observations align exactly with our hypothesis. Due to the semi-transparent properties of the thin Au film, the light intensity is reduced after passing through the Au bottom electrode, which leads to a smaller JSC value. ΔVOC under positive poling and negative poling is 0.89 V, which is also consistent with the difference of coercive voltage for polarization switching. The small VOC value for the FESC before poling may be due to the spontaneous polarization of the as-grown MAPbI3−xClx thin film. We studied the switchable ferroelectric PV performance of MAPbI3−xClx solar cells under alternate positive and negative electric poling for many times, and the result in Fig. S4† demonstrates the repeatable photovoltaic response after positive and negative poling.
Besides the MAPbI3−xClx, we also investigated the ferroelectric properties and the performance of corresponding symmetric FESC for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3. As shown in Fig. S8 and S9,† both the as-grown 250 nm MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 thin films demonstrate strong domain contrast with bright and dark areas in the PFM phase image. Hysteresis loops in the PFM phase response at different bias voltage reveal 180° phase switching with coercive voltage at ±0.2 V and ±0.37 V for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 thin films, respectively. This indicates that the ferroelectric effect is a common property of the methylammonium lead trihalide (MAPbX3). The coercive field for MAPbI3 is ∼8 kV cm−1, which is about half for the ferroelectric MAPbI3−xClx. This might be ascribed to the doping effect of the chloride, but the detailed reason is still not clear. For the performance of symmetric FESC devices based on Au/MAPbI3/Au (Fig. S10†) and Au/MAPbBr3/Au configurations (Fig. S11†), switchable J–V curves are also observed. The values of ΔVOC for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 are 0.38 V and 0.66 V, respectively, which are consistent with their coercive voltage.
As shown above, a new prototype of the ferroelectric solar cells based on the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites has been proposed and realized in this paper. Considering the excellent PV performance of the hybrid perovskite materials demonstrated in the hybrid perovskite solar cells,36–44 the ferroelectric properties of the hybrid perovskite thin film will open a new approach to fabricate high-efficiency FESC. The inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite can provide light absorbers with diverse bandgaps ranging from 1.17 eV to 2.28 eV by changing A, B or X in the perovskite ABX3 structure.61–65 This tunable bandgap enables convenient engineering of the FESC structure in the future, and also provides the potential to stack multilayers of hybrid perovskites to increase light absorption and reduce thermalization loss. Moreover, inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites can achieve crystalline structure by simply precipitating out of the solution followed by low-temperature annealing, which avoids the use of expensive growth techniques for the FESC device.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the ferroelectric properties of the methylammonium lead trihalide thin films, and developed a new type of ferroelectric solar cell based on these inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites. The FESC based on the TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/Au structure demonstrated the power conversion efficiency as high as 6.7%, which is a large breakthrough with respect to the FESC based on inorganic ferroelectric oxide. Moreover, for the symmetric FESC structure, both of the directions of the output voltage and output current can be switched by changing the polarization direction of the ferroelectric MAPbX3 thin film. We also found that the open circuit voltage difference between positive-poled and negative-poled FESC is dependent upon the coercive voltage of the selected materials. Due to the excellent PV properties of the inorganic–organic hybrid perovskites, ferroelectric inorganic–organic hybrid materials open a new and promising avenue to develop efficient FESC.
