The porphyrin donors were designed to possess high solubility and strong intermolecular interactions, via the appropriate selection of peripheral substituents: these molecules bear tetraethynyl porphyrin cores with two aromatic and two aliphatic groups in a trans manner. We have also demonstrated the substitution effect on the aromatic groups: energy levels, solubility and film morphology were significantly modified by the substituents, which consequently influenced the efficiencies of the solar cells as well.

Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have recently attracted considerable attention as renewable energy sources. In particular, solution-processed OPVs have been identified as promising candidates because of their potential for low-cost manufacturing, large area coverage, and the compatibility of their active materials with flexible substrates.1 Hence, great effort has been devoted to the development of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells using polymer-based materials.2 However, research and development in BHJ solar cells using solution-processable small molecules have also been picking up pace as a result of the numerous advantages associated with the use of small molecules over polymer materials.3 These include more straightforward synthesis and purification, less batch-to-batch variation in properties, and intrinsic monodispersity. Just a while ago, solution-processed small molecule solar cells managed to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 6%.4 This further convinced us that small molecule solar cells could become significant competitors to polymer-based solar cells in the future. In the search for suitable small molecule donors, various frameworks have been examined, including oligoacenes,5 oligothiophenes,6 boron dipyrromethenes,7 diketopyrrolopyrroles,8 phthalocyanines,9 merocyanines,10 and squaraines.11 However, the more efficient small molecule solar cells4 usually employ oligomer-like compounds, which by definition are not very “small”. Thus, it is important to search for a small molecular framework that possesses the high functionality desired for application in solution-processed small molecule solar cells.
Organic semiconductors used in solution-processed BHJ OPVs need to fulfil the following requirements: (i) strong photo-absorption in visible and NIR region; (ii) high stability towards light, heat and air; (iii) sufficient solubility in solvents; and (iv) strong intermolecular interaction in the solid state for efficient charge transfer. In this article, we will introduce the porphyrin framework as an example of such a desirable organic semiconductor. The porphyrin framework is ubiquitous in nature, and possesses advantageous photophysical and electrochemical properties. These include high photostability, large extinction coefficients, as well as high susceptibility in electron transfer reactions. The properties of porphyrin can be easily tuned by changing the central metal, as well as by modifying the periphery. Furthermore, the metal ion introduced into the central cavity imparts porphyrin with various functions, such as supramolecular assembly.12 In view of these attractive properties, porphyrin frameworks have already been employed in various organic electronic devices, for instance, as light-absorbing dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells,13 or as donors in vacuum-deposited14 or thermally converted OPVs.15 On the other hand, utilization of porphyrin frameworks as small molecule donors in solution-processed BHJ solar cells has been rather limited.16 Generally, it is difficult to obtain enough solubility and strong intermolecular interactions at the same time for planar π-conjugated materials such as porphyrin.17 These drawbacks might discourage the use of porphyrin in solution-processed OPVs. Herein, we report the rational design of porphyrin donors possessing high solubility and strong intermolecular interactions, as well as their performance in solution-processed solar cells. A PCE of 2.5% had been achieved, which is the highest performance obtained among solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells using porphyrin as the active material.
Results and discussion
Molecular design

Fig. 1(a) shows the template for our design of soluble porphyrin donors. Aliphatic substituents are introduced to the 10- and 20-positions to improve the solubility of the porphyrin, while at the 5- and 15-positions, aromatic groups are employed to expand the π-conjugated system. Both aliphatic and aromatic groups are connected to the porphyrin core via ethynyl linkers18 in order to expand the π-system and to maintain the planar structure. In addition, the two aliphatic groups, as well as the two aromatic groups, are located in trans positions. This structural feature is beneficial for intermolecular orbital overlap, giving rise to an ordered structure in the solid state, as observed in triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)-pentacenes.19 Overall, the expansion of the π-conjugated system is expected to improve the light absorption ability of the porphyrin, while at the same time enhance both its electron-donating nature and its carrier mobility. In addition, the trans-aliphatic groups would imbue high solubility to the porphyrin, so that solution processing could be used as the fabrication method. To elucidate the utility of this design, we have employed aryl groups and TIPS groups as the π-faces and the solubilizing groups, respectively.

Synthesis and identification
The synthetic route for the porphyrin molecules is shown in Fig. 2. During the course of synthesis, we have found that the use of magnesium as the central metal atom is necessary for derivatization; also, the magnesium porphyrin complex exhibited unexpectedly high stability. The latter finding is contradictory to the general knowledge of porphyrin chemistry: magnesium-porphyrins are usually unstable, and undergo demetallation easily even upon exposure to very weak acids, such as silica gel.20 We attribute this observed stability to the presence of the four electron-withdrawing ethynyl substituents.
 Fig. 2  A synthetic route for the porphyrin molecules. 
For this synthesis, we chose dibromo magnesium porphyrin 1 as the starting material to prepare our target compounds.21 Sonogashira coupling of 1 with arylacetylenes proceeded smoothly to produce the porphyrins 2 (R = H), 3 (R = NMe2), and 4 (R = NO2) in good yield. Since the installation of both electron-donating (compound 3) and electron-withdrawing (compound 4) acetylenes was successful, various other aryl groups could be introduced in the future to increase the diversity of such materials. Compounds 2–4 were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry, while X-ray crystallography was carried out specifically for compounds 2 and 4 with coordinating solvents (Fig. 1(b) and ESI†). Intermolecular overlap of the π-orbitals of both porphyrin cores and peripheral aryl groups were confirmed via analysis of the crystal structures. The stability of these compounds was evaluated by thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis, and the compounds were found to be stable enough for application in solar cells: the thermal decomposition temperatures were 390 °C for 2, 360 °C for 3, and 300 °C for 4 (ESI†). It should be noted that the solvent molecules coordinating to the magnesium atom could be easily removed at around 100 °C.
Fundamental properties
The optical properties of 2, 3, and 4 in solution are summarized in Table 1. All the compounds showed a Soret band around 500 nm and a Q band around 700 nm (Fig. 3), which is typical for ethynyl porphyrins.21 The Soret and Q bands of 3 and 4 were red-shifted relative to those of 2, probably due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), in which the porphyrin frameworks of 3 and 4 act as acceptor and donor, respectively. For films of 2–4, the absorption spectra were observed to be broader and red-shifted (Fig. 3), because of effective π-overlap.

HOMO and LUMO levels were determined by cyclic voltammetry, and are summarized in Table 2. Due to the presence of different substituents on the aryl groups, the HOMO energy of 3 is higher (−4.89 eV) than that of 2 (−5.11 eV), while the HOMO energy of 4 is lower (−5.31 eV). The energy levels of these porphyrins can be considered to be compatible to those of [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric-acid methyl ester (PC60BM, ca. −3.8 eV and −6.0 eV), which is the most commonly used acceptor material. The HOMO levels of the porphyrins are located within the band gap of PC60BM, while the LUMO levels are sufficiently higher (around −3.25 eV) than that of PC60BM. The rising of the LUMO levels, in spite of the introduction of electron-withdrawing ethynyl moieties at the meso-positions, is attributed to the central magnesium atom.

OPV device performance
Using these porphyrins, BHJ solar cells were fabricated with a general device structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/porphyrin:PC60BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (80 nm), in which the active layer was prepared by spin-coating. After optimization, a PCE of 2.5% was achieved for the device based on 2:PC60BM in a 1:4 mixture (Table 3, Fig. 4). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4(a). This obtained PCE is the highest value reported for porphyrin-based solution-processed small molecule BHJ solar cells. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) of this device was 0.92 V, which is remarkably high, judging from the difference between the HOMO level of 2 (−5.1 eV) and the LUMO level of PC60BM (−3.8 eV). In this case, the HOMO–LUMO gap was 1.3 V, thus differing from the VOC value (0.92 V) by only 0.4 V. This difference is very close to the theoretical limit (0.3 V),22 indicating that VOC was almost at the theoretical maximum.

Black, red, and blue are data from the devices of compounds 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 
In addition, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were also obtained, and found to be in good agreement with their absorption spectra (Fig. 3 and 4(b)).
Besides suitable HOMO–LUMO energy levels, we postulate that the high performance of the device using porphyrin 2 could also be attributed to a good balance of hole and electron mobility in the BHJ device, as well as favorable film morphology. As a proof of principle, we fabricated hole-only and electron-only devices of BHJ layers using the porphyrins and PC60BM in a 1:4 ratio, to evaluate both hole and electron mobility. In compounds 2 and 3, it was found that hole and electron mobility were in good balance (2: μh = 2.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 9.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; 3: μh = 3.7 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 5.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1; 4: μh = could not be determined, μe = 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).23,24 We consider that the relatively high electron mobility of the electron-only device of 4:PC60BM is due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro groups. On the other hand, the device fabricated using 3 exhibited relatively lower VOC because of its higher HOMO level. This is attributed to the electron-donating nature of the dimethylamino groups. Finally, film morphology of the devices was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The lower solubility of 4 resulted in the rough surface morphology of the active layer, as observed in the AFM images (ESI†). Poor performance of the device using 4 is ascribed to this undesirable morphology. We found that the lower solubility of compound 4 is likely due to strong intermolecular π–π interaction between its electron-rich (porphyrin) and its electron-deficient (nitro-substituted phenyl group) moieties. Therefore, it could be clearly seen that the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents on the phenyl groups exhibited a significant effect on device performance, due to their influence on the energy levels of the materials and the morphology of the films.
Conclusion
We have disclosed the design for soluble porphyrin donors used in solution-processed small molecule BHJ solar cells. These molecules bear tetraethynyl porphyrin cores with two aromatic and two aliphatic groups in a trans manner. Compound 2 exhibited the highest performance (2.5% of PCE and 0.92 V of VOC) in BHJ OPV devices employing PC60BM. We have also demonstrated the substitution effect on the phenyl groups: energy levels, solubility, and film morphology were significantly influenced by the substituents, and consequently the efficiency of the solar cells as well. The present result suggests that porphyrin, with appropriate design, can serve as a good framework for small molecule-based solution-processed solar cells. The incorporation of porphyrin chemistry into OPV research is expected to create plenty of opportunities to develop highly efficient and stable organic solar cells.
Experimental section
Chemicals and instrumentation
Compound 1 and 1-ethynyl-4-nitrobenzene were prepared according to published literature procedures.21,25 The other materials were purchased from Tokyo Kasei Co., Sigma Aldrich Inc. and other commercial suppliers and used after appropriate purification. Solvents were purchased from KANTO CHEMICAL CO., INC and purified by a solvent purification system (GlassContour) equipped with columns of activated alumina and supported copper catalyst (Q-5) prior to use. All reactions dealing with air or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under argon. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass plates coated with 0.25 mm 230–400 mesh silica gel containing a fluorescent indicator (Merck). Flash silica gel column chromatography was performed on silica gel (Wako, Wakogel® C-200). NMR spectra were measured on either a JEOL ECA–500 spectrometer or a JEOL ECX–400 spectrometer reported in parts per million from tetramethylsilane. Routine and high-resolution mass spectra were acquired by Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB) using a time-of-flight mass analyzer on a JEOL JMS-700P spectrometer with a calibration standard of polyethylene glycol (MW 1000). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-670 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a HOKUTO DENKO HZ-5000 voltammetric analyzer. All CV measurements were carried out in a one-compartment cell under argon gas, equipped with a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was a 0.1 mol L−1 dichloromethane solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6). Thin films were analyzed using X-ray diffractometry on a Rigaku SmartLab-GIXD with monochromic CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. X-ray crystallographic measurements were performed on RIGAKU R-AXIS RAPID II (imaging plate detector) using monochromic CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The positional and thermal parameters were refined by the full-matrix least-squares method using SHELXL97 program on Yadokari software.

OPV device fabrication and characterization
A 145 nm-thick, patterned indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass with a sheet resistance of 8 Ω per square was used as the substrate. A conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios AI4083) layer was formed on the glass/ITO substrate to obtain a 30 nm-thick thin film. Compound 2 or 3:PC60BM in a 1:4 mixture was dissolved in chlorobenzene to obtain each solution (total concentration, 3.0 wt%). Compound 4:PC60BM in a 1:4 mixture was dissolved in THF/toluene (1/1 wt ratio) to obtain a solution (total concentration, 1.5 wt%). Each active layer was formed via spin-coating on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate: 4500 rpm, 30 s for the blend films using compound 2 or 3, and 3000 rpm, 30 s for the blend film using compound 4. The substrates were then heated at 65 °C for 10 min. Next, Ca (20 nm) and the aluminium electrode (Al, 80 nm) were deposited in a vacuum (3 × 10−4 Pa) on top of the active layer. Devices were encapsulated in a glove box in nitrogen atmosphere. Photocurrent of the fabricated OPV devices was investigated with a sweeping voltage using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit controlled by a computer under simulated solar light using an AM 1.5G light source with a 100 mW cm−2 intensity. Incident light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) with a standard Si photodiode (Bunko-Keiki, BS-520). Current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured for an area of 0.04 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured under a constant power generated by monochromatized photons using a xenon lamp and a halogen lamp. The film thickness is obtained by using a Dektak 6M stylus profiler.

We also determined hole mobilities of compounds 2–4 in the absence of fullerene derivatives by fabricating an organic field effect transistor (OFET) and hole-only devices under the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. FET mobility: 1.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2, 3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 3, and 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 4. SCLC mobility: 4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2, 8.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 3, and 5.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 4. These values were not consistent with the mobility of BHJ porphyrin:fullerene devices, because the effect of morphology was very large.
Solution processed OFET devices using porphyrins. See:
