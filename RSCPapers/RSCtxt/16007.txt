    , Accepted 22nd May 2018First published on 22nd May 2018AbstractA nanostructured nickel and cobalt fluoride catalyst is constructed by a facile strategy carried out in a mixture of ionic liquids under microwave irradiation followed by low temperature thermal-annealing. It is a novel and robust material among the non-noble metal catalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis.
Clean energy such as wind and solar power has received public attention due to the awakening of the awareness of sustainable development,1–3 whilst their reliability and high cost limit their widespread applications. The nature of such a kind of energy is determined by weather conditions, and as a result, the energy supplied is not continuous. One of the promising approaches to address these issues is the production of alternative chemical fuels via electrolysis driven water splitting.4,5 For the electrochemical water splitting reaction, the OER, as a more sluggish half reaction, mainly determines the energy transfer efficiency; and this reaction is also crucial for other kinds of energy conversion and storage devices such as rechargeable metal–air batteries and fuel cells.6,7 The process of oxygen generation from water is a multi-step process that involves a four-electron transfer. Since electrons are transferred one at a time thus increasing the difficulty and complexity, relatively high overpotential is required to drive the reaction. Correspondingly, a highly efficient catalyst is needed to fulfill the water oxidation reaction.8,9
Developing highly efficient OER catalysts is still of great significance to energy conversion devices. Ruthenium oxide and iridium oxide are still recognized as the most powerful catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction,10 while they are not available for large-scale application due to high price and scarcity. Efficient alternative catalysts for the OER based on inexpensive and earth-abundant elements but not at the sacrifice of good catalytic activity and durability are highly preferred for future development. Earth-abundant transition metal based catalysts such as metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal phosphides and metal chalcogenides are found to be promising materials with good performances for the OER. For example, a spinel-type of CoCr2O4/carbon nanosheet composite displays a good catalytic performance and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction with 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 326 mV;11 Sumboja et al.12 found that NiMn LDHs need an overpotential of 350 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2; Liu et al.13 developed MOF-derived CoSe2 microspheres with hollow interiors that exhibit an overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2; sea urchin-like (CoxFe1−x)2P reaches 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 370 mV.14 It can be seen that a relatively high overpotential is still required by these nonprecious catalysts to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a widely used figure of merit equivalent to 12% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.15
The outstanding activities of transition-metal based catalysts for the OER can be related to the 3d electron number of the transition metal ions, the enthalpy for the lower to higher oxide transition, and the surface oxygen binding energy.16 The binding of oxygenic intermediate species is influenced by the surface transition-metal ions whose eg orbitals could bond with surface-anion adsorbates.17 To date, the above-mentioned transition metal-based catalysts have been largely studied, while no reports were found on the transition-metal fluorides that might be efficient catalysts for water oxidation. The fluoride therefore indeed arouses our great interest for application OER. A combination effect by forming nickel and cobalt compounds was reported to create a promising OER catalyst and the atom ratios have a great influence on the nature of catalysts, and thus they were considered when developing transition-metal fluorides with a suitable morphology and composition.
Herein, a 3-dimensional OER catalyst based on nanostructured Ni–Co fluoride is developed using a microwave irradiation strategy following thermal annealing at 300 °C under protection of N2. The catalyst was prepared at different Ni/Co molar ratios in the precursors (1,1, 1,2 and 2,1) and the final products were nominated correspondingly as Ni–Co-F-(1,1, 1,2 and 2,1). Superb performances towards the OER were demonstrated with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 driven by an overpotential of 300 mV on Ni–Co-F-1,1, which is even better than that of the noble IrO2 catalyst. Its excellent catalytic stability was proved by steady and dynamic electrochemical techniques. The current work proposed a new catalyst member for the oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis. And we believe that the activity can be largely improved by efficient structural and morphological design and conductivity modification.
The crystal structure of the fabricated samples is characterized by XRD technology and the corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic diffraction peaks observed at 26.6°, 34.4°, 39.5°, 42.8°, 52.3°, and 55.2° correspond to the (110), (101), (111), (210), (211), and (220) planes of a rutile fluoride structure. Due to a similar structure of Ni and Co in the unit cell, separated NiF2 and CoF2 peaks are not observed but with the peaks sitting somewhat between the pure CoF2 phase (JCPDS no. 33-0417) and the NiF2 phase (JCPDS no. 24-0792). There is no obvious structural difference upon changing the ratios of Ni to Co in the precursors during catalyst preparation. A characteristic peak attributed to metallic Ni and Co is observed at 44.2°, but the intensity is much lower compared with the materials obtained before calcination (Fig. S1, ESI†). An oxidized surface is probably formed but cannot be clearly indicated in the bulk crystal structure.

XPS measurements were carried out to analyze the chemical valence state of the concerned elements on the surface. A whole spectrum survey of the fluorides with different Ni/Co ratios is shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). The concerned elemental peaks are clearly visible. The main peak of C 1s at 284.6 eV is employed to calibrate all the spectra. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p3/2 can be fitted with a spin–orbit doublet accompanied by a satellite peak,18,19 and the peaks at 854.7 eV and 857.3 eV can be assigned to Ni2+ and Ni3+ respectively (Fig. 2a). The Co 2p3/2 peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks located at 781.2 eV and 779.6 eV, respectively, arising from Co2+ and Co3+ pertinent to a satellite peak at 786.59 eV (Fig. 2b).20 The content of the different oxidation states of Ni and Co is analysed in Table S1 (ESI†). By increasing the content of Co in the hybrid, it is interesting to find that the amount of Ni3+ is increased while Co3+ shows an opposite trend probably due to the redox reaction that occurs during the fabrication process (Co3+/Co2+, Ni2+/Ni3+).21 And the highest amounts of Ni3+ (45.9%) and Co2+ (88.2%) are found on Ni–Co-F-1,1 (Table S1, ESI†). F-metal bonding is demonstrated in F 1s at 684.2 eV22 for all the samples and no evident chemical shift is found for all the samples (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The O 1s spectrum can be fitted with three peaks at binding energies of ca. 529.4 eV, 531.2 eV and 532.5 eV for the metal–oxygen, hydroxyl groups, and defect sites with low oxygen coordination, respectively23 (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The peaks of metal–oxygen and hydroxyl groups for Ni–Co–F-1,1 are shifted to a lower binding energy by 0.2 eV compared with the rest two samples. It is consistent with the highest amount of Ni3+ observed on the surface.

The morphology of Ni–Co-F-1,1 is revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nanoparticles assembled like nanorods are observed (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Their morphology is inherited from the samples before calcination (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Nanorod structures assembled from nanoparticles are clearly observed in the TEM image (Fig. S3c, ESI†). A typical nanorod structure that consisted of interconnected nanoparticles is observed in the TEM images (Fig. 3a–c). Visible lattice fringes are observed in the high-resolution TEM images with a spacing of about 0.33 nm, close to the theoretical interplanar spacing of the (110) plane of NiF2 and/or CoF2 (Fig. 3d). In Fig. 3e, the lattice fringes are consistent with the (111) and (200) planes of the metal oxides of Co and Ni probably due to surface oxidation as seen in the XPS spectrum. Well-defined rings are observed in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3f) of Ni–Co-F-1,1 signifying its polycrystalline nature. What's more, the SAED pattern exhibits individual spots associated with concentric rings indexed to the (101), (211) and (202) planes of metal fluoride. Ni, Co, O and F elements are uniformly distributed on the nanorods as can be seen in the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 3g).

The OER performance is probed by linear scan voltammetry (LSV) in N2-saturated 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. A commercial IrO2 catalyst is also compared as a reference. As shown in Fig. 4a, Ni–Co-F-1,1 exhibits the largest current density (∼89.6 mA cm−2 at 1.65 V vs. RHE) for the electrochemical OER among all the electrodes, which is even better than the activity of IrO2 (∼65.4 mA cm−2 at 1.65 V vs. RHE), a classical benchmark catalyst for the OER. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is compared as a benchmark corresponding to a 10% efficient water-splitting device.24 As shown in Fig. 4a, Ni–Co-F-1,1 generates a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 300 mV, lower than those of the other three samples (340 mV for IrO2, 350 mV for Ni–Co-F-1,2 and 420 mV for Ni–Co-F-2,1), superior to some advanced non-precious OER catalysts. For instance, in a 1 M KOH solution and at 10 mA cm−2, CoWO4 nanocubes take 450 mV,25 Ni–Co–P nanoparticles need 360 mV26 and NiCo LDH nanoplates need 367 mV,27etc. This indicates that Ni–Co-F-1,1 is one of the high-efficiency OER catalysts, and a superior non-precious metal catalyst. It is also found that the ratio of Co to Ni during catalyst preparation has an impact on its catalytic performance. The best activity is found with a ratio of 1:1, more or less content of Co in the hybrid both give a lower performance in the OER. Suen et al.28 suggested that the electron density of Co2+ could be a general descriptor for OER activity. Meanwhile, Ni3+ is considered as the active site for the OER, making NiCo2O4 the most active catalyst in the series.29 Accordingly, Ni–Co-F-1,1 possibly exhibits high catalytic activities for the OER since it contains the highest Co2+/Co3+ ratio (∼7.47; ∼3.27 for Ni–Co-F-1,2 and ∼2.52 for Ni–Co-F-2,1) and the lowest Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio (∼1.18, ∼1.62 for Ni–Co-F-1,2 and ∼3.29 for Ni–Co-F-2,1) among the three samples (Table S1, ESI†).

For water oxidation on the nickel-based catalyst, it was proposed that the OER mechanism can be expressed using the following equation:23OH− ⇌ OHads + e−OHads + OH− ⇌ Oads− + H2OOads− + 2NiOOH ⇌ 2NiO2 + H2O + e−2NiO2 + OHads ⇌ NiOOH + Oads2Oads ⇌ O2
The mechanism demonstrated that the redox Ni3+/Ni4+ was significant for the OER on the nickel-based catalyst. The high valence state of metal oxide on the surface is demonstrated to be active for the OER. Similar to the phosphide material,30 even the bulk phase structure of the catalyst is in the form of fluoride, the oxide species formed on the surface of the catalyst play a virtual role in efficient OER catalysis.
The catalytic activity of transition metal-based catalysts highly depends on conductivity, and we believe that the performance can be further improved by appropriate structural design and optimization. The same is the case for nickel phosphide that has a modest activity for the OER when the first work was released.30 The Tafel slope is a key kinetic parameter to show the effect of potential on current density. The potential (η) vs. log(current density) was recorded (Fig. 4b) with its linear portions at a low overpotential fitted to the Tafel equation31 (η = blogi + a, where η is the potential, i is the current density, and b is the Tafel slope). As shown in Fig. 4b, the Tafel slope of Ni–Co-F-1,1 is about 77 mV dec−1, which is smaller than that of Ni–Co-F-1,2 and Ni–Co-F-2,1. This result agrees with the higher catalytic current density of Ni–Co-F-1,1. Thus, it can be concluded that Ni–Co-F-1,1 would be a quite promising material for the OER.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to probe the charge transferability for the OER at a potential of 1.62 V (Fig. S4, ESI†). A simple Randles equivalent circuit is employed to fit the EIS data to obtain the Rct value of each electrode relevant to the O2 evolution reaction activity. Apparently, the Nyquist plots of Ni–Co-F-1,1 show much smaller semicircle diameters indicating that its electron transfer resistance is much smaller than those of the other two catalysts, which is in agreement with the higher charge transport efficiency. Therefore, it could be another reason for the enhanced OER activity.
The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Ni–Co-F-1,1, Ni–Co-F-1,2 and Ni–Co-F-2,1 were determined by the double-layer capacitance of the catalytic surface,32 which is identified using CV measurements to obtain the capacitive current from double layer charging (ESI† and Fig. S5a–f). The electrochemically active surface area is calculated to be 0.775, 0.575 and 0.5 cm−2 for Ni–Co-F-1,1, Ni–Co-F-1,2 and Ni–Co-F-2,1, respectively. It is interesting to see that Ni–Co-F-1,1 has the largest ECSA, which can account for the best OER catalytic performance among the three samples. Since Ni–Co-F-2,1 has the smallest ECSA, it results in less conductivity and lower OER performance. From the facts mentioned above, to fulfill the great advantage of nanostructured catalysts, it is quite important to enlarge their electrochemically active surface areas.
In addition to the high catalytic activity and fast kinetics, durability is also significant for energy generation and cost saving in practical applications.33 As shown in Fig. 5(a), the stability of the Ni–Co-F-1,1 electrode is further evaluated by a constant-potential electrolysis. The electrodes are held at a constant potential of 1.56 V, while the operating current is measured as a function of time. There is no obvious catalytic activity loss during a 10 h operation. As revealed in Fig. 5(b) an imperceptible variation before and after 1000 CV cycles indicates the excellent stability of the Ni–Co-F-1,1 catalyst. These results indicate that the Ni–Co-F-1,1 catalyst is of high activity and good stability as a catalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction.

In summary, a nanostructured Ni–Co-F catalyst as a novel member of the OER catalyst family is tentatively demonstrated for the first time. It can be fabricated under microwave environments using a simple and one-step approach. Resulting from their larger electrochemically active surface area, increased active sites (higher ratio of Ni3+ and Co2+) and faster electron transformation rate, Ni–Co-F-1,1 catalysts show the best catalytic performance towards the OER with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 300 mV. The low-cost, easily-prepared and earth-abundant fluoride materials exhibit high catalytic activity and good stability among many OER catalysts. This may intrigue researchers to develop fluoride based catalysts for the OER. This work is an important step in the development of binary transition-metals as non-precious catalysts for chemical energy storage.
