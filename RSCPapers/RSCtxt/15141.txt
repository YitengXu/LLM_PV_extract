    , Accepted 20th May 2020First published on 21st May 2020AbstractSemiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) have been used in electrical transducers for environmental and health monitoring due to their quasi ballistic electron transport, efficient transconductance, high carrier mobility, good on/off ratio, excellent mechanical properties, etc. Herein, we have prepared a non-enzymatic pesticide sensor to selectively detect methyl parathion (MP, which is a restricted use pesticide according to the EPA) using a silver–zinc oxide (Ag–ZnO) composite decorated s-SWCNT based field-effect transistor (FET). The Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT film is also characterized by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR), Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. The electrical response of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET was measured under ambient conditions in the presence and absence of MP. The hydrolysis of MP took place due to the potent catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO, which led to changes in transistor conductance. Based on this, detection of the different concentrations of MP was demonstrated by using Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET. The Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET device showed a linear response from 1 × 10−16 M to 1 × 10−4 M MP with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.27 × 10−16 M in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). In addition, Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET exhibited acceptable reproducibility and repeatability when employed for MP detection. Moreover, the proposed FET sensor was highly stable under ambient conditions. Finally, the accurate detection of spiked MP is demonstrated in soil and rice samples with good recovery.
1. Introduction
Excess use of pesticides has resulted in the contamination of water, soil, air and food, which is the cause of several issues related to humans and biodiversity.1 Unfortunately, billions of pounds of pesticides are being used every year in the agricultural field to protect crops from pest attack and improve harvesting.1 Among them, methyl parathion (MP, an organophosphorus pesticide) has been widely used as a pesticide. MP has been linked to the increase of neurotoxicity,2 fetal death,2 birth defects,2 genotoxicity,2 and neurodevelopmental problems.3 MP has also been used as a chemical nerve agent in chemical warfare attacks. The presence of residual pesticides and their metabolites has already been shown to affect biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems1 (for example, the catastrophe of honeybee colonies4 and the increase in amphibian mortality).5 Pesticide contaminations have also been linked to different types of cancers (i.e. brain, kidney, breast, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate, leukemia and pancreatic).6 The lethal concentration of organophosphorus pesticide contamination in food and environmental samples is in the range from 3.43 × 10−8 M to 3.43 × 10−7 M.7 Therefore, monitoring pesticide contamination in food and environmental samples is very important.
Generally, liquid chromatography,8 mass spectrometry,8 ion-mobility spectrometry,9 UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy,10 fluorescence spectroscopy,11 surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy,12 surface acoustic wave sensors,13 electrochemical sensors,14 and colorimetric sensors have been used to detect MP.15 These conventional methods could offer high specificity and sensitivity. However, they are also associated with their inherent disadvantages such as requirements of large space, a clean room, trained technical personnel and a continuous power supply; so, they may not be suitable for on-site operation and may become highly expensive. On the other hand, enzymatic MP biosensors have poor stability due to the denaturation of enzymes and are prone to thermal and chemical degradation during fabrication, storage and handling, meaning they cannot be readily incorporated into more sophisticated instruments.16
Field effect transistors (FETs) can be used to detect the target analyte based on its interaction with the transistor surface due to the charge sensitive properties of the nanomaterials and the binding event of the analyte by using a readable electrical signal.17–19 To construct FET-based chemical sensors, 1D materials, 2D materials, organic semiconductors and metal oxides have been used.17,18,20 Specifically, semiconducting SWCNT based field effect transistors (s-SWCNT–FETs) have received great attention for use in radio frequency identification tags,21 logic circuits,22 solar cells,23 chemical sensors24 and artificial skins.25 As demonstrated, s-SWCNTs have several advantages such as quasi ballistic transport of carriers, high physical and chemical stability, robust dispersibility, mechanical flexibility, low-temperature processing and simple chemical modification.22,26 Therefore, s-SWCNT based FET sensors can be used for various applications including national security, food and environmental safety, and medical and forensic analysis.19 Also, the s-SWCNT–FET devices are easily portable, facilitating mass production and on-chip integration, and target analyte detection with less energy consumption.17,18
When voltage is applied through a gate electrode, a semiconducting nanotube switches from the insulating state to the conducting state.27 However, when the s-SWCNT–FET is exposed to interaction with the chemicals, the interaction between the nanotube and the analyte will change the conductance of the nanotube.28,29 Kong et al. utilized s-SWCNT–FETs to detect 2 ppm NO2 and 0.1% NH3.30 Thereafter, such s-SWCNT–FETs have been adopted to detect different kinds of chemicals with improved sensitivity. For example, Chen et al. fabricated flexible and wearable cloth transistors based on aligned s-SWCNTs, which have shown great sensitivity for trace chemical vapors (8 ppb 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and 40 ppb NO2) at room temperature.18 Two models have been proposed to address the mechanism of s-SWCNT–FET based detection. The first one is charge transfer between the analyte and nanotube. The second one is the change in the Schottky barrier distance between the nanotube and the transistors.29 s-SWCNT–FETs have poor selectivity for chemicals if prepared using a printed or drop-casted method, as they exhibit only p-type behaviours under air because of the adsorption of moisture (oxygen/water) or other impurities.19,29 In this case, in order to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the s-SWCNT–FET, polymers, or organic or inorganic-based compounds have been integrated within the FETs.19,29
In this work, for the first time, we have fabricated a sensitive and selective s-SWCNT modified FET based non-enzymatic sensor for MP detection. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle decorated silver (Ag) nanorods are effectively functionalized on s-SWCNTs by a simple drop casting method. Ag–ZnO coated s-SWCNTs were tested using IDS–VGS transfer curve measurements, scanning kelvin probe (SKP) microscopy, UV-vis-NIR, photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopies, FE-SEM and EDS. The as prepared Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensor detected MP in the range of 1 × 10−16 M to 1 × 10−4 M with a limit of detection of 0.27 × 10−16 M. The effects of interferent compounds such as acetic acid, ortho-phosphoric acid, carbaryl, carbofuran, atrazine, bromadiolone, chlorpyrifos, malathion and MP were tested using the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensor. Moreover, MP detection was tested in samples extracted from rice and soil using a Ag–ZnO coated s-SWCNT–FET. In addition, the catalytic sensing mechanism of MP is explained using the Ag–ZnO coated s-SWCNT–FET. The relationships between the band gap of the materials and their catalytic properties are examined. Furthermore, the limit of detection of our non-enzymatic sensor is 0.27 × 10−16 M, which is below the permissible limit (3.43 × 10−8 M MP) set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).31
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Zinc oxide nanopowder (<100 nm, ZnO), silver nitrate (AgNO3), methyl parathion (MP), carbaryl, carbofuran, atrazine, bromadiolone, chlorpyrifos, malathion and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. The s-SWCNT dispersed solution was received from the laboratory of Prof. M. B. Chan-Park.32 AP-SWCNTs were purchased from Carbon Solution, Inc. (Columbia Ave, USA). Acetic acid and ortho-phosphoric acid were purchased from SRL, India. Phosphate buffer was prepared by using sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate (NaH2PO4·H2O) and sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate (Na2HPO4·7H2O). All the chemicals used in this study were of analar grade. The 10 mM MP stock solution was prepared using isopropyl alcohol and further dilutions were made with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M PBS, pH 2) and stored at 4 °C. The 10 mM carbaryl, carbofuran and bromadiolone stock solutions were prepared using dimethylformamide (DMF). Chlorpyrifos and malathion stock solutions (10 mM) were prepared using acetone. The 10 mM atrazine, acetic acid, and ortho-phosphoric acid stock solutions were prepared using DI water. Finally, all the interferent dilutions were diluted with 0.1 M PBS (pH 2) and stored at 4 °C. The pH of the solutions was adjusted using 0.1 M HCl. All aqueous solutions were freshly prepared by using Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm, specific resistivity) collected from a Millipore Water System.
2.2. Preparation of the Ag nanorod solution
The Ag nanorod solution was prepared as follows.33 Briefly, 0.0679 g (0.2 M) of AgNO3 was dissolved in 2 mL of water and 0.35 g (0.2 mM) of ascorbic acid was dissolved in poly acrylic acid (10 mL, PAA). Then, 1 mL of 0.2 M AgNO3 solution was added to 10 mL of 0.2 mM ascorbic acid/PAA mixture and stirred for 30 min with a glass rod and kept standing at room temperature for 48 h.
2.3. Preparation of the Ag–ZnO composite
The Ag–ZnO composite was prepared by a one-pot thermal treatment method.34 Briefly, 0.5 g of ZnO nanopowder was mixed with 1 mL of Ag nanorod solution to prepare a Ag–ZnO paste. Later, 5 mL of ethanol was added into the Ag–ZnO paste and this mixture was poured into an alumina boat and placed in a split-tube furnace. Subsequently, the temperature was raised from 25 °C to 500 °C at a rate of 5 °C per min and maintained at 500 °C for 2 h under air in the split-tube furnace. Finally, the Ag–ZnO composite was collected from the split-tube furnace.
2.4. Characterization
The structural morphologies of the s-SWCNT, ZnO, Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT samples were analysed by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; FEI-Quanta-200FEG) along with energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The crystal structure and phase composition of the as-prepared SWCNTs (AP-SWCNTs), s-SWCNTs, ZnO, Ag, and the Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composites were recorded by using powder X-ray diffraction (X’pert3 powder XRD system, Malvern Panalytical). The FT-IR spectra of ZnO and the Ag–ZnO composite were measured using a Bruker, Alpha-T spectrometer. Absorbance spectra of the as-prepared ZnO, Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT samples were measured by using Ultraviolet–Visible–Near infrared spectroscopy (UV-vis-NIR) on a Carry 5000, Agilent spectrophotometer. The PL spectroscopic analysis was carried out using a Fluorolog Horiba spectrophotometer. The Raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out using a LabRAM HR evolution, Horiba spectrophotometer using 532 nm laser excitation with a 5 mW laser power source. Thin-films were prepared using 100 μL of s-SWCNTs (0.01 mg mL−1), 50 μL of ZnO/s-SWCNTs (1 mg mL−1) and 50 μL of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs (1 mg mL−1) on SiO2/Si wafer and dried completely at 130 °C up to 2 h for Raman characterization.
The surface photo-voltage and work functions of s-SWCNTs, ZnO/s-SWCNTs and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs were measured by using a Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) technique 5050 from KP Technology Ltd, UK. A DC regulated 150 W Quartz Tungsten Halogen (QTH) visible light source was used for the work function and contact potential difference measurements.35,36 The untreated MP and treated MP solutions were injected into an LC-MS 2020 system equipped with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization source in the positive ionization mode (ESI+).
2.5. Preparation of the s-SWCNT–FET
Micro-fabricated FETs (Scheme S1, Fig. S1–S3 and Table S1, ESI†) were immersed in methanol solution containing 1 vol% APTES for 30 min at room temperature, then washed with methanol and dried using nitrogen gas (Fig. S4, ESI†). The separated s-SWCNT solution (0.01 mg mL−1; 99% purity) was further diluted with DI water to attain 0.0001 mg mL−1 concentration.32 This diluted s-SWCNT solution was bath sonicated for 15 min at 20 °C. Subsequently, the bath sonicated s-SWCNT solution was drop casted onto the FET substrate (treated with APTES) at room temperature (Fig. S4A and B, ESI†).37,38 Then, the substrate was air-dried at room temperature for 12 h (Fig. S4A and B, ESI†). To prevent build-up of surfactant and other contamination, the air-dried substrate was rinsed with deionized water and dried using nitrogen gas. Finally, the substrate was baked at 110 °C for 2 h in a hot air oven to remove solvent and avoid solvent build-up.37
2.6. Preparation of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensor
One mg of the Ag–ZnO composite was dispersed in 1 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) and then bath sonicated for 10 min. After that, 100 μL of the Ag–ZnO composite dispersion was coated on the s-SWCNT–FET devices. Subsequently, the devices were dried in a hot air oven at 110 °C for 2 h to form an air stable Ag–ZnO composite on the s-SWCNTs. By this method, Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensors were prepared to detect MP in 0.1 M PBS (Fig. S4B, ESI†).
2.7. Work function (ϕ) measurements
The work functions of s-SWCNT, ZnO/s-SWCNT and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT samples were measured using a Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) technique 5050 (KP Technology Ltd, UK). In the SKP technique, an alternating current voltage Vac(ω) with 78.3 Hz vibrational frequency is supplied to the gold (Au) probe mounted on the above sample surface, which is connected to the ground potential.39 The interaction between the Au probe and the sample surface allows the measurement of the sample surface potential distribution and the electric charge. In this regard, when the Au probe moves into the vicinity of the sample, it determines an electrostatic force (Fω) using eqn (1).39 (1)
Correspondingly, the probe vibrates with the frequency ω. The surface potential value Vs (i.e. the difference between ϕ of the probe and that of the sample) is nullified by an outer voltage Voff through a feedback loop and the electrostatic force (Fω) between probe and sample is counterbalanced. Primarily, the ϕ of the probe is calibrated against the standard Au sample by contact potential difference (CPD) measurement; we can calculate the sample CPD from Voff. Sample ϕ (in mV) is calculated from CPD using eqn (2).39 ϕ = 5100 − CPDAu + CPDsample(2)where 5100 is the ϕ of Au in meV, CPDAu is the CPD between the standard reference Au substrate and Au probe, CPDsample is the CPD between the sample coated substrate and Au probe. All the work function measurements were carried out in the dark and under visible light at room temperature using a Au probe (2 mm diameter). For a better average value of ϕ, the Au probe was scanned across the sample surface area.39
2.8. Electrical measurements of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensors
A semiconductor parameter analyser was used to evaluate the electrical performance of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET, ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET and s-SWCNT–FET using a Keithley source meter (model 2612B). All FET devices were prepared with a back gate configuration, the channel gap between the electrodes is 10 μm and the electrode channel width is 200 μm (Fig. S5, ESI†). The transfer curves were used to measure the drain current at gate voltage (VGS) from −20 V to +20 V with a constant drain voltage (VDS) of 0.2 V. We used the forward sweep of the transfer curve for mobility calculations. The field effect mobility was calculated using eqn (3).40 (3)where μeff is the effective field effect mobility, ε is the dielectric constant of the gate oxide, Lox is the thickness of the gate oxide, Vsd is the source drain voltage, Lsd is the channel length, Wsd is the channel width and dI/dVg is the transconductance.
2.9. Detection of methyl parathion
In order to detect MP, 10 μL of MP solution at different concentrations from 1 × 10−16 to 1 × 10−4 M was dropped into the channel of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET device and incubated for 15 min at 50 °C in a hot air oven and electrical measurements were carried out.41,42 Before each addition of MP solution, the FET device was cleaned to make sure that PBS and other products were removed from the surface of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs. Finally, the source-drain currents were monitored in response to the addition of each of the different MP concentrations. The sample response was noted by the conductance changes in the absence and presence of MP on Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET (Scheme 1).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. FE-SEM and EDS analysis

Fig. 1A shows a visual image of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT functionalized FET device. The morphologies of s-SWCNTs, ZnO, Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs were analysed using FE-SEM. The s-SWCNTs randomly formed a network with the average tube (bundles) diameter between 10 and 30 nm and length between 1 and 3 μm by the drop-casting method (Fig. 1B).38,43 The presence of ZnO nanoparticles of anisotropic shapes can be found in Fig. 1C. Meanwhile, addition of the Ag nanorod solution increased the aggregation of the ZnO nanoparticles after the thermal reduction process, as shown in Fig. 1D. It also confirmed the presence of ZnO nanoparticles with the Ag nanorod in the nanocomposite film.44,45 Next, surface morphology of the Ag–ZnO decorated s-SWCNT nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 1E. It was evident that the Ag–ZnO particles uniformly covered the s-SWCNTs.46 The elemental analysis of ZnO, Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composites was also performed using EDS. From the obtained EDS spectra, the atomic percentages ((50.68% Zn and 49.32% O), (56.28% Zn, 43.67% O and 0.06% Ag) and (10.25% Zn, 52.05% C, 37.69% O, 0.01% Ag)) of the elements indicated that Ag–ZnO is functionalized with s-SWCNTs (Fig. 1F–H).

3.2. XRD, Raman and FT-IR analysis
The crystalline structure of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite was characterized using XRD and the result was compared with the XRD data of the individual components of AP-SWCNTs (unseparated), s-SWCNTs (separated), pure ZnO, Ag and the Ag–ZnO composite (Fig. 2). The XRD pattern of AP-SWCNTs showed peaks at (2θ) 25.59°, 43.95° and 51.40°, which are assigned to the (002), (100) and (004) planes of graphitic carbon, respectively (Fig. 2A).47,48 A small peak at 25.59° indicates the d spacing of the crystalline carbon, whereas the peak at 43.95° is associated with disordered carbon.34,48 But, the XRD pattern of s-SWCNTs (Fig. 2B) showed only a weak peak at 2θ 44.56° due to the (100) diffraction plane of s-SWCNTs. This is because the s-SWCNT thin-film was prepared on Si wafer to record XRD. Generally, the nanotube concentration is very low and contains more surfactants after the separation of s-SWCNTs. Due to these reasons, XRD bands were weaker for s-SWCNTs.49

ZnO diffraction peaks observed at 2θ values of 31.19°, 33.87°, 35.73°, 47.05° and 56.12° are assigned to (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) diffraction planes of the hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS No. 36-1451) (Fig. 2C).48,50 Similarly, the XRD data of the Ag nanorod showed characteristic diffraction peaks at 37.34° (111) and 43.54° (200), corresponding to the crystalline planes of metallic Ag with a face-centred cubic (fcc) structure (Fig. 2D) (JCPDS No. 04-0783).51 But, in the XRD pattern of Ag–ZnO, diffraction peaks and planes were observed at 31.69° (100), 34.35° (002), 36.17° (101), 47.47° (102) and 56.54° (110) (Fig. 2E).52 Interestingly, when we compared the XRD pattern of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite with that of the Ag–ZnO film, it was found that all the diffraction peaks and planes are slightly downshifted to 30.98° (100), 33.62° (002), 35.44° (101), 46.74° (102) and 55.86° (110), respectively (Fig. 2F).46,53 Also, an additional XRD peak and plane is observed at 44.56° (100) due to the s-SWCNTs. These observations suggested that the diffraction plane of s-SWCNTs remains unchanged in the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite.50,53 However, the noted downshift in the XRD peaks of the composite compared to the individual compounds can be ascribed to the changes in the crystallinity of Ag–ZnO by chemical or physical interaction during thermal heating (Fig. 2A–F).34,46,53 It is worth mentioning that Ag peaks were not observed in the XRD patterns of Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composites. This was because of the lower content of Ag present in the composites.46,53 However, the Ag content was confirmed by EDS analysis (Fig. 1G and H).
Raman spectroscopy is an important non-destructive technique used to characterize the microstructure of carbonaceous materials. The Raman spectra of s-SWCNT (Fig. 3A, curve i), ZnO/s-SWCNT (Fig. 3A, curve ii) and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT (Fig. 3A, curve iii) samples were recorded using 532 nm laser excitation. Typical signature Raman peaks of s-SWCNTs, ZnO/s-SWCNTs and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs were present. The radial breathing mode (RBM) band of s-SWCNT (Fig. 3A, curve i) was observed at 175.69 cm−1 due to the presence of the individual nanotubes having a diameter of ∼1.41 nm according to the equation: ω(RBM) = (234/d + 10), where ω(RBM) represents the frequency of the RBM mode (cm−1) and d is the diameter of the nanotube (nm).54 Similar RBM peaks were observed for the other two samples also. In addition, in the Raman spectrum of the ZnO/s-SWCNT sample, a weak peak was observed at 434.43 cm−1 corresponding to the non-polar optical phonon E2 high mode of the wurtzite hexagonal structure of ZnO (Fig. 3A, curve ii).50
 Fig. 3  (A) Raman spectra of pure s-SWCNTs (i), ZnO/s-SWCNTs (ii) and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs (iii) recorded using a 532 nm wavelength with 5 mW laser power. (B) FT-IR spectra of pristine ZnO (i) and Ag–ZnO (ii). 
The Raman signatures in the frequency range between 1450 and 1700 cm−1 (Fig. 3A) showed the nanotube tangential modes with the characteristic G− and G+ features.32 For the s-SWCNTs (Fig. 3A, curve i), the G− peak was observed at 1568.89 cm−1, which was related to the Breit–Wigner–Fano peak from the ZnO/s-SWCNTs (Fig. 3A, curve ii) and the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs (Fig. 3A, curve iii).14 Furthermore, the Raman spectrum of the s-SWCNTs showed a D band (at 1339.73), which came from the carbon nanotubes.55 The D band is due to the presence of defective sites on s-SWCNTs (non-crystalline carbon, sp3 hybridized carbon).55 As can be seen, an insignificant D band is observed for s-SWCNTs and ZnO/s-SWCNTs. This indicates the high quality of separated semi nanotubes functionalized with ZnO (Fig. 3A, curve i and ii). Generally, the ratio between the intensities of the D band and G band (ID/IG) is used to evaluate the degree of disorder of s-SWCNTs.46,55,56 The loss of aromaticity could be caused by the creation of defects by changes in the hybridization of (C–C) sp2 to (C–C) sp3 with the introduction of oxygen or other atoms on the s-SWCNT surface.50,55 The calculated ID/IG ratios for s-SWCNTs, ZnO/s-SWCNTs and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs were 0.02, 0.07 and 0.30, respectively. It was obvious that the ID/IG value is higher for the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite than for ZnO/s-SWCNTs and s-SWCNTs, and it was confirmed that there were more defects on the nanotube surface after successful functionalization with ZnO–Ag (Fig. 3A).46,55,56 This was in good agreement with the earlier reports where the adherence of metal or metal oxide particles on the s-SWCNT surface created a large amount of defects on the nanotube surface.56
The FT-IR spectra of pure ZnO (Fig. 3B, curve i) and Ag–ZnO (Fig. 3B, curve ii) samples were recorded. The metal–oxygen (M–O) stretching mode of ZnO peaks appeared between 400 and 550 cm−1.57 The ZnO peak present at 548.67 cm−1 was shifted to a higher wave number of 554.26 cm−1 in the composites (Ag–ZnO) (Fig. 3B, curve ii).58 The stretching and bending vibrations of C–O and Zn–O–Zn bands appeared at 874.25 cm−1 and 1023.48 cm−1, respectively. Additionally, Ag–ZnO showed a new peak at 1112.06 cm−1 due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the nitrate species from the Ag precursor.59 Bending vibrations of N–H were observed at 1459.98 cm−1 and 1437.64 cm−1 and C–H vibration was at 1382.58 cm−1, respectively. The absorption bands at 2852.48 cm−1 and 2924.30 cm−1 are due to the bending symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of CH2.59,60 Two sharp absorption bands at 1603.62 cm−1 and 1637.14 cm−1 correspond to the carbonyl group present in ZnO and Ag–ZnO, respectively.57,59,61 Similarly, stretching vibrations of the O–H group were observed at 3436.09 cm−1 and 3438.21 cm−1, which revealed the existence of water molecules in ZnO and the Ag–ZnO composites (Fig. 3B).59,60
3.3. UV-vis-NIR and PL spectroscopic analyses
UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was broadly utilized to analyse the pristine SWCNTs and s-SWCNTs (Fig. 4A, curves i and ii). The first inter-band transition (M11) (600–800 nm) of the metallic nanotubes and the second (S22, 800–1200 nm) and third (S33 400–600 nm) inter-band transitions of the semiconducting nanotubes were observed for the pristine SWCNTs.14,32 However, the UV-vis-NIR spectrum of s-SWCNTs showed no trace of the inter-band transition of metallic SWCNTs (M11) and only enhanced S22 and S33 bands were present (Fig. 4A, curve ii). It has been confirmed that the obtained solution was highly pure s-SWCNTs and metallic nanotubes are absent.14,32

Next, the UV-vis-NIR spectra of ZnO and the Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT nanocomposites were recorded (Fig. 4B). ZnO exhibited a sharp band at 374.50 nm, which corresponds to the formation of ZnO particles (Fig. 4B, curve i).62,63 From the absorption spectrum of ZnO, the optical band gap can be derived using eqn (4)44 (4)where ‘Eg’ represents the band gap, ‘α’ depicts the absorption coefficient, ‘n’ depends on the nature of the transition (2 for an indirect allowed transition or 1/2 for a direct allowed transition), and ‘K’ means a constant.44 The band gap value of ZnO from the experimental data was calculated as ∼3.10 eV, which is in good agreement with the value reported in the literature (Fig. 4B, curve i).44,45 The Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT spectrum showed three bands at 370.67, 449.20 nm and 1028.86 nm.43,62 The sharp band located at 370.67 nm corresponds to the presence of ZnO, whereas the other two bands represent the existence of Ag (449.20 nm) and s-SWCNTs (1028.86 nm) (Fig. 4B, curve iii).46,62 The Ag–ZnO composite showed a broad band at 449.20 nm (Ag) along with the ZnO band at 374.50 nm (Fig. 4B, curve ii).62,64 The ZnO band (blue shifted) appeared from 374.50 to 370.67 nm in the absorption spectrum of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite, which can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of s-SWCNTs in the composite compared to Ag–ZnO (without SWCNTs). As a result, the s-SWCNTs withdraw electron density more towards themselves, and this affected the movement of the band position of ZnO.62 In addition, a significant increase in absorbance intensity of ZnO was observed (at 374.50) in the spectrum of Ag–ZnO and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs, which indicated the synergetic effect between materials present in the composites.63,65 The band gap of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs was calculated as ∼2.78 eV, which was less than that of Ag–ZnO (∼3.0 eV) and ZnO (∼3.10 eV) (Fig. S6, ESI†). This Eg value also supported that the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite may have more photo-catalytic efficiency under visible light.44,45
Furthermore, room temperature PL spectra of ZnO and Ag–ZnO samples were measured, as shown in Fig. 4C. The PL intensity of pure ZnO nanoparticles showed a strong intense peak around ∼521 nm because of interstitial oxygen.66,67 But, Ag–ZnO exhibited a low intense PL peak at ∼507 nm (blue shifted), suggesting that Ag nanorods effectively quenched the charge carrier recombination at the interface of ZnO, so that visible photo-catalytic efficiency is increased.67,68 This observation is further supported by the work function and contact potential difference measurements.
3.4. Electrical measurements of the s-SWCNTs–FET devices
As shown in Fig. 5A, the fabricated s-SWCNTs–FET devices showed typical p-type transistor behaviour under ambient conditions. The drain currents increased with the increasing of negative gate voltage.69 The maximum drain current of 0.35 mA was recorded at −16 gate voltage (VGS) with a drain voltage of +2 V (VDS). The transistor also showed moderate current saturation behaviour.17,18 In Fig. 5B, the transfer characteristics of the back-gated s-SWCNTs–FET and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET devices are shown. The as-prepared s-SWCNTs–FET device showed p-type transistor behaviour with Ion ∼ 0.756 μA, and the threshold voltage (VTH) is −4.00 V. More than 20 FET devices were fabricated and tested. The experimental setup for electrical measurements is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The as-prepared s-SWCNTs/FET devices showed on/off ratios that range from 102 to 104 (full sweep IDS–VGS transfer characteristics presented in Fig. S8A, ESI†). Fig. S8(B) (ESI†) exhibits the variation of the on/off ratios for the tested s-SWCNT/FET devices fabricated from the s-SWCNT solution. The s-SWCNT/FET device exhibited a calculated field effect mobility of 0.0416 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the on/off ratio of 103 from −20 to +20 V (Fig. 5B).

3.5. Electrical measurements of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET devices

Fig. 5B shows the IDS–VGS transfer characteristics of various transistors. After modification, the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET device showed a more negative threshold voltage (VTH) (−12 V) than s-SWCNT–FETs (red and black curves). For Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET, VTH shifted from −4 V to −12 V. This may be ascribed to the strong electron donating nature of Ag–ZnO to s-SWCNTs.29,70,71 When the pesticide (MP) solution is placed on the channel of the device, it interacts with the Ag–ZnO composite and affects the electron–hole (e–h) conductance of the s-SWCNTs. Upon addition of MP, Ag–ZnO mediated the electron transfer and converted the nitro group to the hydroxylamine group, which increased the electron–hole conductance of the s-SWCNTs (Scheme 1A and B).
It has been reported that metal-oxides (ZrO2, TiO2, MnO2, etc.) have strong affinity for MP.72–75 In order to show the interaction between ZnO and MP, 10 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 2) containing 1 × 10−6 M MP was mixed with 100 mg of Ag–ZnO and bath sonicated for 10 min at room temperature. This mixture was filtered through Whatman filter paper with the pore size of 11 μm. The filtrate solution was used to record a UV-vis spectrum. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the UV-vis spectra of MP (fresh) and MP reacted with Ag/ZnO show a strong peak at 277 nm, which corresponds to the nitro group of MP.72,73 It was noted that the absorption peak intensity of the treated MP decreased by about 3.52% compared to the untreated MP solution (Fig. S9, ESI†). This confirmed that some amount MP got adsorbed on the Ag/ZnO surface and removed during filtration.
Next, to ascertain the products formed after the hydrolysis of MP at low pH, 10 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH 2) containing 1 × 10−6 M MP was mixed with 100 mg of Ag–ZnO and 100 μL of s-SWCNTs (0.01 mg mL−1) and bath sonicated for 12 h at room temperature. Thereafter, this mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min and 2 mL of supernatant was collected. It was analysed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as shown in Fig. S10A and B (ESI†), and the corresponding identified products are listed in Table S2 (ESI†).
As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), fresh (1 μM) MP in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 2) showed various ions with different m/z values. These peaks are indicated in Table S2 (ESI†) as compounds a to g with m/z values of 113.05, 137.00, 180.95, 194.90, 211.15, 248.90, and 292.85 (Fig. S10A and Table S2, ESI†). However, after treatment with the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT composite, the obtained MP solution showed a different mass spectrum. In the treated sample, four similar compounds (a, c, d and f) along with three new hydrolysed products (compounds h, i and j) of MP were observed (Fig. S10B and Table S2, ESI†). The main compounds (b, e and g) of MP did not appear in the mass spectrum of the treated MP sample. Moreover, the formation of 4-(hydroxyamino) phenol (compound h) is observed only in the treated sample. It was confirmed that Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs effectively hydrolysed MP. Moreover, it was found that in low pH solution, O-methyl O-(4-nitrophenyl) O-hydrogen phosphorothioate (at m/z = 248.90) was the major product of MP.76 It is the result of a bimolecular substitution reaction by a nucleophile (H2O) attacking at the carbon atom of the methoxy group (SN2@C), as reported elsewhere.76–78 These studies confirmed that MP had a strong interaction with Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs and underwent hydrolysis.
As shown in the IDS–VGS transfer curves, the conductance of the device is increased after the addition of different concentrations of MP on Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET (Fig. 5C). The changes in the conductance start to appear from the off state to the on state of the device (+20 to −20 V). This consistent increase in the drain current can be attributed to the presence of MP on the surface of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET, which promotes charge transfer interaction through PS of MP with the ZnO–Ag/s-SWCNT composite.73 This mechanism was also suggested for the hydrolysis of MP on ZrO2, MnO2 and TiO2 surfaces.72–74 We have also proposed a similar mechanism of MP hydrolysis on ZnO–Ag/s-SWCNTs (Scheme 1C).
3.6. Detection of MP on the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET devices
To evaluate the performance of the developed Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET for MP detection, the drain current responses were recorded with various concentrations of MP (Fig. 5C). In order to draw a calibration plot, the changes in drain currents were plotted against added MP concentrations. For this purpose, drain currents were measured at +20 V. Even though the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET device current response was almost the same from +20 to −10 V, the changes are clearer around the positive voltage (+20 V), so it was used to draw the calibration plot (without s-SWCNTs, the FET device did not show any current changes, so the role of semi nanotubes is important).79–82Fig. 5D shows the calibration plot of MP from 1 × 10−16 M to 1 × 10−4 M with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.95678. The limit of detection (LOD) for MP was estimated to be 0.27 × 10−16 M using eqn (5).14,83 LOD = 3SD/S(5)where SD is the standard deviation of the blank (1.6582 × 10−9 A) and S is the slope of the calibration curve (1.837 × 10−8 A aM−1). The calculated LOD (0.27 × 10−16 M) is the lowest one compared with other reported electrochemical sensors for MP (Table S3, ESI†).14
3.7. Selectivity study of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET
The selectivity of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET was investigated by using IDS–VGS transfer curves in the presence of blank (curve i), water (curve ii), 0.1 M PBS (pH 2) (curve iii), 1 × 10−6 M acetic acid (curve iv), 1 × 10−6 M ortho-phosphoric acid (curve v), 1 × 10−6 M carbaryl (curve vi), 1 × 10−6 M carbofuran (curve vii), 1 × 10−6 M atrazine (curve viii), 1 × 10−6 M bromadiolone (curve ix), 1 × 10−6 M chlorpyrifos (curve x), 1 × 10−6 M malathion (curve xi) and 1 × 10−6 M MP (curve xii).84Fig. 6A and B exhibit the current responses of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET with the added interferents. The observed current response of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET to MP was apparently higher than that of the interferent compounds (Fig. 6A and B). This may be due to the absence of interaction between these interferent compounds and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET. The selective response of the device to MP indicated that hydrolysis of MP takes place followed by reduction of the nitro group to hydroxylamine (Fig. S10B and Table S2, ESI†), which is the major reason for the changes in the drain current.85 This study suggested that Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET may be a useful selective sensor for the detection of MP.

(C) Stability of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET tested by IDS–VGS transfer curve measurements from 1 to 35 days under ambient conditions. (D) Enlarged view of the measured region (circled) in (C). 
3.8. Stability, reproducibility and repeatability studies of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FETs
To investigate the ambient stability of the developed FET sensor, consecutive IDS–VGS transfer curve measurements were carried out from day 1 to 35 (Fig. 6C). The drain current changes were monitored after IDS–VGS transfer curve measurements on day 1, 7, 22 and 35. This FET sensor exhibited about a 7.90% decrease in response after 35 days of ambient exposure and storage (Fig. 6D). This study suggested that the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET sensor is relatively stable and suitable for long time storage and analysis.
Furthermore, repeatability and reproducibility of the developed sensor were also demonstrated by measuring the IDS–VGS transfer curves in the presence of 1 × 10−8 M MP. Three different non-enzymatic FET sensors were fabricated independently and used for the determination of 1 × 10−8 M MP in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2). The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the measurements was 2.83%. Subsequently, the same FET sensor was used for three repetitive measurements of 1 × 10−8 M MP in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2). The observed data exhibited a RSD of 0.47% for triplicate measurements.
3.9. Detecting MP in real samples using Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET
The real sample assay procedure was followed as reported in the literature with slight modifications.86–88 Rice was purchased from a local supermarket and a soil sample was collected from the SRM-IST campus. 10 g of rice and 2 g of soil samples were separately sprayed with MP pesticide solution and dried at room temperature for two days (Fig. S11, ESI†). As reported,86 MP can be extracted from a rice sample simply by mixing with ethanol. To do the extraction, 30 mL of ethanol is added to the rice sample, which is shaken well for 30 min and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane filter. The extract was then evaporated to dryness and mixed with 1 mL of ethanol. Finally, the solution was diluted with 0.1 M PBS (pH 2) for further analysis. Similarly, as reported elsewhere,87,88 anhydrous sodium sulphate (200 mg) was mixed with the soil sample to absorb any moisture present. Next, a dichloromethane–acetone mixture (2:1, v/v, 10 mL) was added to the MP sprayed soil sample to separate the organic layer by using a centrifuge. The above sample was bath sonicated for 10 min and then shaken well for 2 min. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min to collect the supernatant, which was again evaporated (almost to dryness) and mixed with 1 mL of methanol. Finally, the solution was diluted with 0.1 M PBS (pH 2) for further analysis.
Fig. S12A and B display the IDS–VGS transfer curves obtained for the extracts obtained from rice and soil without (control) and with spiked MP using the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensor. The drain current changes were monitored by using IDS–VGS transfer curve measurements with 1 × 10−13 M and 1 × 10−8 M MP in rice and soil extracts. Based on this method, the recovery of MP in the rice sample was found to be 99.48% for 1 × 10−13 M and 97.90% for 1 × 10−8 M (Table S4, ESI†). Similarly, in soil samples, recovery of MP was 101.54% for 1 × 10−13 M and 97.91% for 1 × 10−8 M (Table S4, ESI†). The above results suggested that the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs–FET device may be suitable for accurate detection of MP. However, in some experiments, MP concentration was found to be a little higher or lower than the original added concentrations, which may be due to the presence of impurities or common interferent compounds. Despite that, recovery results of MP are acceptable in the rice and soil samples.

3.9.1. Work function measurements of the Ag–ZnO coated s-SWCNTs/FET. 
Photoresponse is a surface phenomenon and changes in the work function could also provide further details about the interaction between Ag–ZnO and s-SWCNTs.39 The work function (ϕ) was calculated from the energy difference between the vacuum level (Evac) and Fermi level (EF). Fig. 7 illustrates the experimental set-up used for the Kelvin-probe characterization. s-SWCNT, ZnO/s-SWCNT and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT films were deposited onto a conducting Pt coated (Ti/Pt: 12/220 nm) SiO2/Si substrate. Fig. 8A–C show the work functions of the materials under dark (black curve) and visible light conditions (red curve).

(D) CPD spectra of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET acquired in air after a short visible light exposure. The dynamic response and recovery curve of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT sensor to visible light is recorded by illuminating a 70 mW cm−2 QTH source. 
The work functions of multi and single-walled carbon nanotubes were found to be 4.95 and 5.05 eV, respectively.89 In addition, work functions of ZnO (∼5.1 eV) and Ag (∼4.7 eV) were determined earlier.39,90 We measured the work functions of s-SWCNTs, ZnO/s-SWCNTs and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs under dark and visible light conditions (Table 1 and Fig. 8). The difference in work functions between s-SWCNTs and Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs under dark and visible light conditions is ∼0.2 eV and ∼0.6 eV. This increased work function of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs suggested that there is a modulation of the Schottky barrier height between the interfaces.39 Work function of the material is strongly dependent upon the grain boundary effects, surface effects and defect chemistry that are sensitive to O2.91 For example, Ag–ZnO exhibited a higher photo-catalytic efficiency under visible light than dark conditions.35,36

Similarly, our work function values also increased under visible light compared to dark conditions. The localization of charges in these defect states leads to band bending and results in the formation of nano Schottky barrier type junctions influencing the work function.39,92,93

Fig. 8D and Fig. S13 (ESI†) illustrate the photo-voltage signals of Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs and s-SWCNTs under dark and visible light conditions at room temperature. In the presence of visible light, the photo-voltage signal of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT sensor was drastically increased compared to that of the s-SWCNTs sensor alone.70 This could probably be related to the ‘Ag–ZnO’ content promoted electron transfer in the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT sensor. When the visible light is “ON”, the initial excitation of the Ag–ZnO electrons is observed, followed by a transition of the electrons from s-SWCNTs to Ag–ZnO by creating a charge-separated species.45 The photo-voltage signal is fully recoverable after turning off the visible light, indicating complete recovery of the transferred electrons.70,94 The photo-voltage signal response and recovery times of the Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT sensor were estimated as 1 s and 3 s, respectively, followed by a slow tilt for s-SWCNTs (Fig. S13, ESI†) that occurs on the order of several seconds.70 Fig. S14(a–c) (ESI†) illustrates schematically the variations in the work functions upon the addition of ZnO and Ag–ZnO to s-SWCNTs, respectively. The donation of electrons by ZnO to the s-SWCNT sensor surface results in a shift of EF toward the VB (Fig. S14b, ESI†). On the other hand, the addition of the Ag–ZnO composite (strong electron donating) leads to a further extension of the EF level toward the VB as depicted by the higher ϕ (Fig. S14c, ESI†).39 In other words, a drastic change in VTH is seen for Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs.
Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNTs with a higher ϕ is suitable for FET sensor applications; the potential barrier induced by the interface state is low enough to make the electrons transfer to the surface of Ag–ZnO, resulting in a higher amount of hydroxyl ion adsorbed on the surface of Ag–ZnO, which improved the non-enzymatic sensing of MP (Fig. S15, ESI†).95 However, the lower ϕ of the ZnO/s-SWCNT composite indicated the presence of less hydroxyl ions on the surface of ZnO, which may not be favourable for the improved sensor performance.95

4. Conclusions
We have reported a label-free MP sensor using a Ag–ZnO functionalized s-SWCNT based FET. FE-SEM and Raman results confirmed that Ag–ZnO was successfully deposited on s-SWCNTs. UV-vis-NIR and SKP results indicated preferential molecular charge transfer between s-SWCNTs and Ag–ZnO. The Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET selectively responded to each addition of MP by drain current changes. The developed FET sensor selectively responded to MP from 1 × 10−16 M to 1 × 10−4 M and LOD was calculated as 0.27 × 10−16 M. Moreover, the proposed non-enzymatic sensor was tested for MP determination in rice and soil samples, which indicated that this sensor may be suitable for real-world applications. Particularly, the constructed Ag–ZnO/s-SWCNT–FET sensor system is simple to operate and provides faster analysis (measurement time in this study: ∼15 min) than the typical antibody based assays (measurement time: 30 min to 60 min) for chemical detection.41,96 Furthermore, the described FET sensing model with metal nanoparticles and s-SWCNT/FET can be used to develop FET based sensors for other types of chemicals. Thus, our results have successfully demonstrated that this non-enzymatic FET sensor has opened up the possibility of developing various kinds of FET devices for pesticide detection. Further improvement and optimization studies toward the detection of different pesticides by using nanoparticle functionalized s-SWCNT–FETs are under progress in our laboratory.
