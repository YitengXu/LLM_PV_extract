    , Accepted 24th July 2021First published on 26th July 2021AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-scale sunlight collectors, consisting of fluorophores embedded in waveguides, which can concentrate part of the absorbed sunlight at the borders of the slab through wave-guided photoluminescence. Benefiting from their low-cost and semi-transparency, they exhibit great potential for building integrated photovoltaics. Among various types of fluorophores, carbon quantum dots (C-dots) have attracted great interest due to their relatively high quantum yield (QY), low-cost, non-toxic composition and simple synthetic methods. Unfortunately, most red-emitting C-dots with high QYs were synthesized using relatively toxic and expensive precursors. The C-dots exhibiting red-emission synthesized using sustainable precursors (e.g. citric acid) have QYs less than 20%. Here we synthesized the red-emitting C-dots produced by using citric acid and urea as precursors and N,N-diethylformamide as the solvent via a solvothermal reaction. The red C-dots have a broad absorption from 300–650 nm, with a QY as high as 40% in ethanol. In addition, the C-dots exhibited good biocompatibility, even for a C-dot concentration up to 1000 μg mL−1. The LSC (LSC area 100 cm2) based on red C-dots exhibited a solar-to-electricity power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.9% under natural sunlight illumination (35 mW cm−2). We combined red-emitting C-dots with green-emitting C-dots prepared via a vacuum heating approach. By using a tandem structure, composed of two slabs each incorporating a different C-dot type, the obtained PCE of the LSC based on the combination of red and green C-dots further increases up to 2.3% (under the same irradiance equal to 35 mW cm−2), which is comparable to the reported PCEs for the LSCs based on C-dots or other types of fluorophores. This work indicates that the red-emitting C-dots produced by low-cost and environmentally-friendly precursors exhibit great potential as building blocks for the environmentally compatible LSCs.
1. Introduction
Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-scale sunlight collectors, which can convert sunlight to electricity.1–4 Typically, an LSC consists of an optical waveguide embedded with fluorophores, which absorb part of the sunlight and re-emit photons.5 Due to the total internal reflection, the emitted photons are guided towards the edges of the LSC. Finally, a solar cell positioned at the edges of the LSC convert the photons into electricity. Benefitting from simple fabrication, adjustable transparency and low-light intensity photovoltaic (PV) response, the LSCs have attracted great attention for application in building integrated PVs (BIPVs).6–8
To date, various types of fluorophores have been used as sunlight absorbers and converters for application in LSCs.2,6–8 Typically, the fluorophores need to have broad absorption, matched with Sun's spectrum, high quantum yield (QY), large Stokes shift (as small as possible spectral overlap between the absorption and emission) and the emitted photons matching the spectral response of the PV cell (Eg ≈ 1.14 eV for silicon).9 During the last forty years, various types of fluorophores have been used as sunlight absorbers and converters for LSC applications, including organic dyes, quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanocrystals and perovskites.6–20 Organic dyes were first used as efficient fluorophores because of their high QYs, and large absorption coefficiencts.9,20 However, the long-term photo-stability of the dyes under UV light is still an open issue.9 In addition, some of dyes have large overlap between their absorption and emission spectra, with very limited Stokes shift.9 Colloidal QDs have been used as fluorophores for LSCs, benefiting from their size-tunable broad absorption, and structure-engineered spectral overlap between the absorption and emission.1,4,17,18 Among various types of colloidal QDs, some colloidal carbon QDs (C-dots) could have several advantages with respect to inorganic QDs, including toxic-metal-free composition (mainly C, N and O), simple synthetic approaches (solvothermal or microwave), surface functional groups tunable absorption/emission spectrum, and good photostability.21–24 Compared to most inorganic QDs or perovskite nanocrystals, the synthesis of most C-dots does not need an air-free reaction system and the handling of C-dots (post-purification and device preparation) does not need special protection.21–24 C-dots have been used as fluorophores for LSC fabrication.5,21,25 For example, N-doped C-dot-based LSC exhibited an optical efficiency of 3.94% (LSC dimensions: 2.5 × 1.6 cm2).21 Gong et al. fabricated a tandem LSC based on yellow and red C-dots, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% (LSC dimensions: 10 × 10 cm2).26 Many kinds of precursors have been used for high-quality red-emitting C-dots with high QY (30–60%), such as phloroglucinol, N,N-dipropyl-paraphenylenediamine, p-phenyldiacetonitrile, and terephthalaldehyde.23,27–29 However, these precursors are still relatively toxic or expensive, compared to most widely used citric acid (CA) and urea precursors, which are low-cost and environmentally friendly.30,31 Miao et al. reported the synthesis of C-dots with emission ranging from 550–700 nm via a solvothermal approach using CA/urea as the precursors and dimethylformide (DMF) as the solvent,30 but the currently obtained QY for red C-dots is still low (below 20%).30 In addition, the PCE of LSCs based on C-dots synthesized using CA/urea is still low compared to LSCs based on other types of C-dots.4,32
In this work, we followed the reported reference to produce red-emitting C-dots employing CA and urea as precursors, and N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) as a solvent via a solvothermal reaction.33 The as-prepared red C-dots have a broad absorption from 300–650 nm and a QY of 35 ± 5% in ethanol. The as-prepared red C-dots have low toxicity at a concentration of 1000 μg mL−1 tested through the CCK method. We also synthesized the green C-dots using CA and urea as precursors via a reported vacuum-heating approach.24 A typical laminated structure was used for LSC fabrication (10 × 10 cm2). The LSC based on red C-dots exhibited a PCE of 1.9% (35 mW cm−2). With further combination with green C-dot-based LSCs, the tandem LSC exhibited a PCE of 2.3% (35 mW cm−2). This work indicated that the C-dots synthesized using CA/urea hold great potential for the development of low-cost, biocompatible, environmentally-friendly and highly efficient LSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30 (MW: 50000) and K90 (MW: 1000000), CA, urea, DMF, DEF, NaOH, hexane, petroleum, ethyl acetate, ethanol and methanol were obtained from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd, China. All chemicals were used as purchased.
2.2. Synthesis of C-dots
C-dots were synthesized via a solvothermal approach as reported previously.30,33 Typically, CA (1 g) and different amounts of urea (0.3–1 g) were dissolved in DMF or DEF (10 mL). After the CA and urea were completely dissolved in the solvent by sonication, the clear solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (25 mL) and reacted for 3–9 h at 160–180 °C. After naturally cooling the reaction temperature to 25 °C (12 h after reaction), the autoclave was opened slowly and the obtained mixture was transferred into a centrifuge. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 r.p.m. for 15 minutes. The supernatant was collected, and 10 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (20 mg mL−1) was added. After 10 min of stirring, 50 mL of hexane was added to the mixture. The precipitation was collected and redispersed in 0.5 mL methanol. Silica gel column chromatography was used to filter the remaining impurities in the C-dot methanol solution. Specifically, the silica gel was placed in the column, and then a mixture of petroleum and ethyl acetate at a volume ratio of 10:1 was poured into the column to make the silica gel completely wet until it was sticky. The obtained C-dot methanol mixture was added into the chromatography column. The collected mixture was centrifuged at 6000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a dialysis bag with a molecular weight of 500 Da for 24 hours. The ethanol outside the bag was replaced every 6–12 hours. The obtained C-dots in ethanol were dried and the slurry was freeze-dried. Finally, the powder was obtained for further use and characterizations.
The green C-dots were prepared via a reported vacuum-heating approach using CA (1 g) and urea (2 g) as precursors with the presence of CaCl2 (1 g).7,24 Typically, the CA, urea and CaCl2 were dispersed in water. Then the mixture was pumped for 20 min at 60 °C to obtain a slurry. Subsequently the slurry was heated to 120 °C and further to 180 °C. Finally, the mixture was heated to 250 °C and kept at this temperature for 60 min. After cooling the reaction temperature to 25 °C, ethanol was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 6000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and transferred into a 3000 Da dialysis bag for 12 h. Finally, the solution inside the bag was collected and dried.
2.3. Biocompatibility evaluation
HL-1 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing non-essential amino acids (NEAA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The cytotoxicity evaluation of C-dots (Red and Green C-dots) was performed through Cell Counting Kit-8 (Meilunbio, China). HL-1 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 per well. Red and green C-dot aqueous solution was dispersed in culture medium at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 μg mL−1 and further added into each well for 24 h incubation. After that, cells were washed with PBS lightly and the CCK-8 solution was added into each well, which was further kept at 37 °C for 1 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured to evaluate the cell viabilities with a reference wavelength at 650 nm. In order to take in vitro bioimaging, the HL-1 cells (1 × 105) were cultured in 35 mm glass bottom dishes. After 24 h incubation, C-dots were diluted with 2 mL MEM to obtain a concentration of 200 μg mL−1 and the mixture was added into dishes for 2 h incubation. After rinsing with PBS, cells were observed using a Leica TCS-SP5 laser scanning confocal microscopy. Green C-dots and red C-dots were excited by 405 nm and 488 nm wavelength lasers, respectively.
2.4. LSCs fabrication
The C-dot powders with different amounts were dispersed in a PVP K30/K90 mixture (mass ratio of 1:1) with a final concentration of 0.5–1.5 mg cm−3 in the PVP matrix. Compared to PVP K30, the PVP K90 can avoid the detachment of the polymer film from the glass. The C-dot/PVP mixture (10 mL ethanol solution) was sonicated for 30 min and then centrifuged at 6000 r.p.m. for 10 min to avoid any of the bubbles. The mixture was poured on a 10 × 10 cm2 glass substrate. A glass rod was swiftly rolled over the substrate to obtain a uniform film after evaporation of ethanol.17 After the mixture on the glass slide was dried at 25 °C for 6 h, another glass slide was put on the top of the C-dot/PVP film. After 12 h drying at 25 °C, commercial PVs were attached on all the edges of the LSC by a transparent epoxy glue to measure the PCE of the LSC.34,35
2.5. Characterizations
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the C-dots were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo Electron Co.). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the C-dots were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. The structure and morphologies of the C-dots were investigated using a JEOL JEM2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM). Absorption spectra of the red/green C-dots and the LSCs were acquired with a UV-2600 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Fluorescence spectra were acquired using an Edinburgh FLS980 instrument. QYs of C-dots dispersed in ethanol solution were measured by using Rhodamine 6G as a reference. The QYs of the C-dots/PVP film (0.5 × 0.5 cm2) were measured by using an integrating sphere coupled with an Edinburgh FLS980 spectrophotometer.
The PCEs of the LSCs were measured under natural sunlight (May and June, 2021, sunny day, Qingdao China, 35–70 mW cm2).35 The calibrated PV cell (Zolix QE-B1) and the power meter (Newport Model 843-R) were used to measure the power intensity of the sunlight. Similar values were obtained for both of the methods. Eight commercial polycrystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells with an area of 1.1 × 5 cm2 were attached to four edges of an LSC using epoxy glue. The width of the c-Si solar cell (1.1 cm) was larger than the thickness of the LSC (∼7.3 mm). We used black tapes to mark the excess area of the cell to block the light. A parallel connection was used for all PVs. The J–V curves of the coupled LSC-PVs and the standalone PV were obtained using a voltage source meter (Keithley 2400). No mirrors were used during the J–V measurements.
The PL intensity of LSCs was measured by PL spectroscopy upon illumination (365 nm UV lamp, 100 mW cm−2) in ambient conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and properties of C-dots
To obtain the C-dots with broad absorption, we followed the reported approaches to tune the molar ratio of CA/urea, meanwhile using different solvents of DMF and DEF.30,33 The as-prepared C-dots (160 °C, DEF) have an average size of ∼5 nm with a clear lattice (Fig. 1a). The measured d spacing is around 0.29 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of the graphitic carbon.30,33 The C-dots produced using DMF at 160 °C exhibited a mean size of 3.6 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is smaller than that produced by the C-dots using DEF. As reported previously, the DEF can improve the dehydration degree, thus enhancing the carbonization of the C-dots.33 Based on FT-IR measurements, the as-prepared C-dots have the surface functional groups of COOH, OH and NH2 using CA/urea (Fig. S2, ESI†), imparting to them excellent colloidal stability in polar solvents. XPS analysis confirms the presence of C, N, O and Na in C-dots after NaOH treatment (Fig. S3, ESI†).

The C-dots dispersed in ethanol have an absorption spectrum covering from 300 to 650 nm. Compared to the C-dots using DMF, the DEF can promote the dehydration of the precursors, thus enhancing the absorption in the range of 550–600 nm, similar to the findings reported previously.33 A red-shift of the PL peak can be found by increasing the molar ratio of CA/urea or the reaction temperature (Fig. 1c), which can improve the carbonization degree of the C-dots during the reaction.33 At 180 °C, the C-dots exhibited a PL peak position located at ∼580 nm and broad absorption ranging from 300–650 nm, which matched well the Sun's spectrum in the UV and visible range. Using silica gel column chromatography and dialysis, the impurities can be largely removed. The optimized red-emitting C-dots (180 °C, DEF) dispersed in ethanol have a QY of (35 ± 5) %, with a maximum QY up to 40%, which is 2 times higher than the red-C-dots produced using CA/urea as precursors and DMF as solvent (less than 20%).30 The red-shift in absorption is mostly due to the high carbonization degree of the C-dots, which is confirmed by the XPS measurement. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), on the identical reaction conditions, the C-dots produced by DEF exhibited higher carbon content (80%) compared to that (65%) produced by DMF.
3.2. Toxicity evaluation of C-dots
Before using the red and green C-dots as fluorophores for LSC fabrication, their cellular biocompatibility was evaluated using the CCK assay method.36 The CCK-8 assay on the HL-1 cell line was performed at different concentrations of red and green C-dots for 24 h (Fig. 2a). Details are included in the Experimental section. With the increase of C-dot concentration, the viability of the cells exposed to red C-dots decreased slightly and maintained ∼80% of its initial value even at the C-dot concentration as high as 1000 μg mL−1, indicating the low toxicity of the red C-dots. Similarly, we observed that the green C-dots also maintained 90% of their initial cell viability after incubation for 24 h, when the C-dot concentration was lower than 300 μg mL−1. Further increasing the green C-dots concentration resulted in a dramatic decrease of cell viability.

Before the cell incubation, the C-dot aqueous solution was filtered using a 200 nm filter membrane. (b) Fluorescence, (c) bright field and (d) merged images of the green C-dots/cells. (e) Fluorescence, (f) bright field and (g) merged images of red C-dots/cells. The scale bar is 100 μm. 
The standard cell morphologies of red and green C-dots do not show a significant variation after 24 hour incubation with a C-dot concentration of 200 μg mL−1, indicating the low cyto-toxicity of the C-dots at this concentration level. In order to determine the toxicity of the green C-dots at higher concentration, we measured the XPS spectra of the red and green C-dots. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the red C-dots contain Na+ (6%) over C, N, and O, while the green C-dots contain Ca2+ (6%) over C, N, and O. The presence of Ca2+ originates from the CaCl2 precursor during the reaction, which serves as the surface passivation cation for improving the optical properties of the C-dots. The high Ca2+ concentration leads to the low cell viability.37 Our investigation indicates that the C-dots hold low toxicity at a concentration lower than 300 μg mL−1. As the LSC was mainly used for BIPVs, the low toxicity of the C-dots makes them excellent candidates as fluorophores for LSC applications.
3.3. Performance of the LSCs
A typical laminated structure of the LSCs was used for LSC testing.11,38 Typically, the red C-dots were dispersed in PVP ethanol solution, then the mixture was poured on the surface of the glass. Another glass slide was placed on the top of the C-dots/PVP. Finally, epoxy glue was used to attach the PV on the edge of the LSC. A typical configuration and working principle of the LSC are shown in Fig. 3g. The lateral size of the as-fabricated LSC is 10 × 10 cm2 and the thickness of the glass (D) is ∼7 mm. The thickness of the C-dot/polymer film (d) is around 300 μm. The geometrical gain factor (G) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of the LSC and the area of the edges of the LSC coupled with the PV cells. The G (3.4) of the LSCs was calculated from G = L/[4(D + d)]. Using the same approach, we also produced the laminated LSC based on green C-dots. By placing the red C-dot-based LSC on the bottom of the LSC based on green C-dots, we also prepared a so-called tandem-structured LSC following the literature.17 Under room light (indoor), all the LSC exhibited certain semi-transparency (Fig. 3a–c). The LSC based on green C-dots exhibited a transparency of 65% and the LSC based on red C-dots exhibited a transparency of 20% in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). As a result, the tandem LSC exhibited the transparency of ∼20%, guaranteeing the visible light transmitted into the indoor through the LSC-type window. Upon the simulated sunlight illumination (LCS 100, Newport, 100 mW cm−2), a red or green color was seen from the edges of the LSCs (Fig. 3d–f).

(g) Scheme of a typical laminated LSC. 
As shown in Fig. 4a, the C-dots inside the LSC exhibited a distance-dependent PL spectrum. The distance (L) was defined as the distance between the excitation spot on the LSC and the edge of the LSC. Because of the spectral overlap between the absorption and emission (S), the PL of the red C-dot-based LSC shifted to the red gradually (Fig. 4a). As the size of the LSC is large, the small overlap (S) will lead to a significant reabsorption, which decreases the PCEs of the LSC. By using the laminated structure, the PCE of the LSC based on red C-dots is still high as the G factor is small (3.6 for 100 cm2 LSC). Benefitting from the small overlap (S) as shown in Fig. 4b, the PL of the LSC based on green C-dots does not have any PL-shifts as reported previously by our group.7 The typical absorption spectrum of the green C-dots covers from 300–500 nm and that of the red C-dots covers from 300–650 nm (Fig. 4c), which are very suitable for making a tandem structure of the LSC in order to enhance the light absorption efficiency.5,17,25,29,39 In detail, the top LSC based on green C-dots can absorb 12% of the sun's radiation, and the bottom LCS based on red C-dots can absorb a further 9% of the sun's spectrum, as detailed in Fig. 4c. This configuration could enhance the sunlight absorption efficiency. The quantum efficiency of the red C-dots/PVP (0.5 mg cm−3) is ∼35%, which is lower than that of C-dots dispersed in ethanol (40%). A similar result was obtained for the green C-dots. The quantum efficiency decreases from 65% to 60% after phase transfer from methanol to PVP polymer. This decrease is due to the presence of quenchers in the PVP matrix, which serve as recombination centers.4

PL spectra were measured at different optical paths (L) for red C-dot-based LSCs. (c) Calculated solar absorption of the LSCs based on red and green C-dots and solar spectrum (AM 1.5G). The concentration of the C-dots in the PVP matrix was 0.5 mg cm−3. 
For the solar-to-electricity PCE measurement, a commercial solar cell was purchased and used without cutting. The typical size of the solar cell is 1.1 × 5 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and J–V response of the solar cell are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In the PL response range (450–750 nm), the average value of EQE is around 80% (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The solar cell has the Jsc of 31.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.57 V, fill factor (FF) of 69.2% and PCE of 12.5% under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The edges of the LSC were attached by eight solar cells using transparent epoxy glue. The uncovered part of the solar cell was blocked by the black tapes. By optimizing the concentration of the red C-dots, the laminated LSC exhibited a clear concentration dependent J–V behavior upon natural sunlight illumination (70 or 35 mW cm−2) (Fig. 5a and b). C1, C2 and C3 are the concentration of the red C-dots inside the PVP matrix, which are 0.5, 1 and 1.5 mg cm−3, respectively. The following equation was used to calculate the PCE of the LSC: (1)where Pin is the natural sunlight power and Pout is the output powder of the LSC. Alateral is the lateral area of the LSC and PD is the incident power density per unit area (mW cm−2).

With the increase of red C-dot concentration (0.5–1.5 mg cm−3), the measured PCEs of the LSCs gradually decreased (Fig. S7, ESI†). This concentration-dependent PCEs is quite possibly due to the reabsorption energy loss, which is strongly concentration dependent. The solar cells attached on the four edges of the LSC (red C-dots) exhibited Jsc, Voc and FF of 148.6 mA, 0.52 V and 63.6, respectively. The calculated PCE based on eqn (1) is 1.9% for the LSC based on red C-dots (0.5 mg cm−3) upon natural sunlight illumination (35 mW cm−2) (Fig. 5a). By using the tandem structure, the obtained J is further enhanced, and it is higher than the LSC based on red C-dots or green C-dots (Fig. 5a). The solar cells attached on the four edges of the top LSC (green C-dots) exhibited Jsc, Voc and FF of 148.6 mA, 0.52 V and 63.6, respectively. The calculated PCE based on eqn (1) is 1.7% for the LSC based on green C-dots upon natural sunlight illumination (35 mW cm−2). The PCE of the LSC further reaches 2.3% (under 35 mW cm−2 irradiation). This PCE values obtained in this work are comparable to the reported PCEs for the LSCs based on C-dots.21,25,29,40 We carried out computational analysis to investigate the expected functional properties for large-area LSCs. As described in the ESI,† the simulations are based on a modified Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation.14 The theoretical simulation indicates that the laminated LSC based on red C-dots could have an external optical efficiency up to 3% with a lateral size of 1 m2. In a tandem structure, the external optical efficiency could be up to 7%. In addition, the LSC based on red C-dots have a good photostability upon 365 UV illumination (100 mW cm−2). The PL spectrum of the LSC does not show a significant variation after 2 h illumination (Fig. S6a, ESI†) and the integrated PL area maintained 80% of the initial value after 2 h illumination (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Together with the biocompatibility of the C-dots and low-cost precursors, this work indicates that C-dots produced by CA/urea show great potential for commercial LSC applications.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
In conclusion, we demonstrated an efficient LSC based on red-emitting C-dots produced using CA and urea as precursors. The C-dots prepared using a solvothermal reaction have an absorption spectrum ranging from 300 to 650 nm with a QY of 35 ± 5%. In addition, the red C-dots have very good biocompatibility, reflecting the low cell toxicity with a C-dot concentration up to 1000 μg mL−1. Benefiting from these features, the R C-dot-based LSC exhibits a PCE as high as ∼1.9% under natural sunlight illumination (35 mW cm−2). By combining the LSC based on red C-dots with the LSC based on green C-dots, the tandem LSC exhibited a PCE of 2.3% under natural sunlight illumination (35 mW cm−2), which is comparable to the best LSCs based on C-dots reported in the literature. This work indicates that the red-emitting C-dots produced by CA/urea potentially applies to the design and development of low-cost, efficient and ecofriendly BIPVs.
