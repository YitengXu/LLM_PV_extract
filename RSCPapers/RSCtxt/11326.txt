    First published on 22nd January 2019AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been intensively studied in the past decades as a promising method for large-scale solar energy storage. Among the various issues that limit the progress of this field, the lack of photoelectrode materials with suitable properties in all aspects of light absorption, charge separation and transport, and charge transfer is a key challenge, which has attracted tremendous research attention. A large variety of compositions, in different forms, have been tested. This review aims to summarize efforts in this area, with a focus on materials-related considerations. Issues discussed by this review include synthesis, optoelectronic properties, charge behaviors and catalysis. In the recognition that thin-film materials are representative model systems for the study of these issues, we elected to focus on this form, so as to provide a concise and coherent account on the different strategies that have been proposed and tested. Because practical implementation is of paramount importance to the eventual realization of using solar fuel for solar energy storage, we pay particular attention to strategies proposed to address the stability and catalytic issues, which are two key factors limiting the implementation of efficient photoelectrode materials. To keep the overall discussion focused, all discussions were presented within the context of water splitting reactions. How the thin-film systems may be applied for fundamental studies of the water splitting chemical mechanisms and how to use the model system to test device engineering design strategies are discussed.

1 Definition of thin-film photoelectrodes and scope of this Review
As has been extensively reviewed by other authors elsewhere and in this Special Issue, the dilemma between efficiency and cost is a critical challenge that has prevented solar fuels from being developed into a practical technology for large-scale solar energy harvesting and storage. That is, highly efficient or low-cost solar fuel synthesis has been demonstrated separately but not together. At the heart of the dilemma are issues connected to materials which can be used to harvest solar energy and carry out the desired chemical reactions. Such an understanding has underpinned significant research efforts in materials innovations for solar fuel synthesis. Indeed, a wide spectrum of materials in terms of composition, morphology and structure, among other factors, have been proposed and tested, with varying degrees of success in solving the cost–efficiency dilemma. In this Review, we focus on thin-film materials. More specifically, we concentrate on materials whose thicknesses are below a few microns, mostly in the tens of nanometres range. Materials of such characteristic dimensions are unique for a number of reasons. First, they represent a form factor that can be readily studied for materials’ fundamental properties, especially charge behaviours such as excitation, separation, transport and transfer. For instance, most thin films can be readily fashioned into an electrode for the assessment of the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical behaviours, which report on the charge properties of the materials. While better performance may be measured on other morphologies (vide infra), particularly those with nanometre scale features, thin films are often much simpler to study for insights that can guide future efforts aimed at optimizing structures for further improvements. In other words, thin film materials represent a good model platform for fundamental understanding of solar fuel materials.
Second, a rich knowledge base on thin film materials has been generated by decades of intense research on semiconductors. A great deal has been learned about how to synthesize them; a battery of experimental techniques has been developed to readily study them; strategies on how to combine different layers of components with complementary functionalities into a single material have been proposed and proven to be highly effective. The last point is especially valuable for the purpose of solar fuel synthesis because it is widely recognized that a single composition is unlikely to meet all the needs, including light absorption, charge separation, catalysis and passivation. The best hope to realize these functionalities is to construct an integrated system that includes multiple components, each optimized for one or more specific purposes. For example, semiconductors with suitable bandgaps and electronic properties may be used to maximize light absorption and charge separation; heterogeneous and/or molecular catalysts can be introduced on top of the semiconducting light absorber for fast and highly specific charge transfer; additional protection may be necessary for durability. While such a strategy may be implemented in a variety of forms, thin films have proven to be the most straightforward thanks to the rich knowledge base on their syntheses. More importantly, what is learned on thin film materials may be readily transferred for the construction of more complex structures for optimum performance such as various nanostructures.
Our main goal of writing this Review is to summarize and examine existing strategies developed for materials innovations to meet the challenge of efficient and inexpensive solar fuel synthesis. To best serve this purpose, we limit our discussions to semiconductors as the unit for light absorption and charge separation. It is noted that other mechanisms have also been exploited for this purpose, including plasmonic effect and anisotropic charge behaviours in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Interested readers are directed to reviews on these materials such as those cited here.1–3 We note that many of the considerations presented here to further develop these semiconductor materials are shared by materials governed by other mechanisms. Similarly, although we indeed include discussions on protection, readers interested in comprehensive reviews on that topic are directed elsewhere, e.g., by Hu et al.4 and Bae et al.5 Instead, this article places an emphasis on materials-related issues in connection to the processes of charge excitation, transport and transfer. This paper is organized as follows. We start by a general introduction of the synthetic methods of thin films and move on to discussions of thin films based on their composition within the context of solar fuel synthesis. Corrosion protection strategies are next discussed, followed by thin film catalyst layers. At the end of the article, we present various implementations of thin film materials for solar fuel synthesis.
2 Thin film synthesis
A variety of synthetic methods have been developed to produce thin films. Generally, they may be categorized into three major groups based on the nature of the reactions utilized, namely, physical vapor deposition, chemical deposition and electrochemical deposition (Fig. 1). The principles of each method are presented below with selected examples. It is noted that in a complex thin film, which may include multiple layers, each layer may be prepared by a different method. Such a consideration is particularly relevant for the topic discussed here as successful solar fuel reactions often dictate the combination of materials with distinctly different, yet complementary, properties (Fig. 1). The flexibility of using different methods to synthesize different components holds great promise for realizing the desired functionalities.

2.1 Physical vapor deposition (PVD)
Physical vapor deposition refers to synthesis methods which vaporize target materials via physical means for subsequent deposition on the receiving substrates. A key distinguishing feature of PVD is the lack of chemical reactions. The methods to introduce target materials include plasma (sputtering, molecular beam epitaxy), electron beam (e-beam evaporation, molecular beam epitaxy), heat (thermal evaporation, molecular beam epitaxy) and laser (pulse laser deposition). In comparison with other thin film growth techniques, PVD features advantages such as versatility, reproducibility and relatively easy implementation. The resulting materials are often of the highest quality in terms of purity and quality. For these reasons, PVD has been widely used to synthesize nearly every type of semiconductor reported to date. Just within the context of solar fuel synthesis, a large number of examples exist, where high performance photoelectrodes were prepared by PVD. For instance, a Cu(InGa)Se2 photocathode was obtained by the co-evaporation of In, Ga, Cu and Se targets onto Mo-coated glass substrates.6 Materials with similar compositions have also been achieved by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), with the substrate temperature first increased to 300 °C and then fixed at 550 °C (Fig. 2a and b).7 Ta3N5 has been reported to be synthesized by sputtering TaOx thin films onto Ta metal substrates, followed by a facile nitridation process.8 InGaN nanowires have been reported to grow on Si substrates using In/Ga metal and N2 plasma at 600 °C using MBE (Fig. 2c).9 In addition to photoactive materials as noted above, PVD has been used for the deposition of protective layers and/or catalysts. For example, a TiO2 protection layer can be deposited on a Si surface by sputtering a Ti target in a reactive oxygen atmosphere.10 To minimize surface oxidation of Si during the process, a thin layer of Ti (5 nm) was first sputtered to protect the surface. Metal layers (AuGe/Ni/Au and Pt) were e-beam evaporated on the surface of a GaAs photocathode to protect it from photocorrosion.11 Of these examples, the most broadly implemented may be Pt deposition via sputtering as an effective catalyst to improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of photocathodes.12 The limitation of PVD is mainly the high cost due to high-vacuum chamber assemblies, which introduce extra fabrication cost compared with solution-based methods.

2.2 Chemical deposition
The most obvious difference between chemical deposition and PVD is the involvement of chemical precursors and/or chemical reactions during the deposition. Depending on the media within which the deposition is carried out, chemical deposition may be divided into subcategories. When the deposition is mainly performed via vapor-phase processes, we have chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD). For the ease of precursor delivery, volatile materials such as organometallic compounds are most often used as the precursors. The key difference between CVD and ALD lies in that the latter typically features self-limiting surface chemical reactions. CVD has been widely employed to synthesize thin film semiconductors, including metal oxides. For example, Kay et al. reported the synthesis of cauliflower-type hematite (α-Fe2O3) thin films from Fe(CO)5 and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) on a FTO-coated glass substrate at 415 °C (Fig. 3a).13 GaAs-based photoelectrodes have been synthesized by the metal–organic CVD (MOCVD) method at 800 °C, using trimethyl gallium, trimethyl aluminium and arsine (AsH3) as the precursors for Ga, Al and As, respectively.11,14,15 Amorphous silicon (a-Si) was deposited via a plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) method, in which silane (SiH4) was used as the precursor for silicon, and phosphine (PH3) and trimethyl boron (B(CH3)3) were used for n- and p-type doping, respectively (Fig. 3b).16

Different from CVD, the self-limiting surface reaction nature of ALD gives rise to the ability to precisely control the growth thickness by a layer-by-layer deposition process. Consequently, it has been widely used to deposit thin-film semiconductors, protective layers and catalysts. For example, thin-film hematite has been deposited on high-aspect ratio substrates such as TiSi2 nanonets and Si nanowires with Fe(OtBu)6 and H2O as the Fe and O precursors, respectively (Fig. 3c).17,18 ALD-grown TiO2 has been explored as an effective protection layer on both photoanode and photocathode materials. It was found that the crystallinity of TiO2 is sensitive to many factors, including the type of precursors used. When titanium isopropoxide (Ti(i-PrO)4) was used as the precursor, crystalline TiO2 was deposited at 275 °C onto Cu2O, which served as a protection layer.19 When tetrakis(dimethylamido)-titanium (TDMAT) was used as the precursor, amorphous TiO2 was deposited at 150 °C onto BiVO4 that also served as a protection layer.20 ALD was also used to deposit thin films of catalysts. For example, NiO has been deposited on the surface of BiVO4 at 260 °C using bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dionato)nickel(II) (Ni(thd)2) and H2O as the precursors.21 Interestingly, the as-grown NiO is also a p-type semiconductor. In addition to serving as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, it was discovered to further improve the performance of the system by forming a p–n junction with BiVO4.
An advantage offered by CVD and ALD is the control over the purity of the target materials, thanks to the gas-phase nature of the precursor delivery. The low pressures at which the deposition is carried out also ensure a reasonably long mean free path of the precursor species in the reactor, suggesting that most film growth is not diffusion limited. This feature, however, makes the implementation relatively difficult, increasing the processing cost. Such a challenge may be addressed by relaxing the requirements for a vacuum and carrying out the deposition either directly in a solution or in ambient air. The most popularly encountered examples include chemical bath deposition (CBD) and electrochemical deposition. Due to the broad implementation of electrochemical deposition, we will introduce this method as a subcategory next. In this subsection, our attention is focused on CBD and a number of other thin film deposition techniques that involve solutions, including spin-coating and spray pyrolysis.
Various metal oxides, such as hematite, WO3 and BiVO4, have been successfully synthesized by solution methods. For instance, nanostructured hematite thin films were synthesized by immersing a FTO glass into the mixture of FeCl3 and NaNO3 at 100 °C, followed by post-annealing in air (Fig. 4a).22 WO3 thin films were prepared by first mixing the tungsten precursor with H2O2, 2-proponal and poly(ethylene glycol) and then drop-casting the solution onto a FTO glass substrate, followed by post-annealing in air to convert the film to WO3.23 Non-oxide semiconductors have been synthesized by solution-based methods, as well. For example, Cu2ZnSnS4 was obtained by spin coating a homogeneous hybrid ink containing thiourea, Sn2+, Cu2+ and Zn nanoparticles in 2-methoxyethanol onto molybdenum-covered glass substrates, followed by air drying (at 200 °C) and sulfurization processes in a H2S atmosphere at 560 °C (Fig. 4b).24 Note that a post-growth annealing treatment is involved in all examples listed here either to achieve the desired crystallinity or compositions because the synthesis conditions are often not sufficient for the desired materials in a single step, as limited by the solution nature of the precursors or the reactions or both.

In addition to semiconductors, protective layers and catalysts have been synthesized by solution-based methods. For example, Liu et al. reported the synthesis of a ferrihydrite protection layer on the surface of Ta3N5 by immersing the substrates into a solution containing Fe(NO3)3 and NaNO3 at 100 °C (Fig. 4d).25 Further decoration of Co3O4 nanoparticles as OER catalysts was achieved hydrothermally by sealing the substrate with a precursor solution containing Co(CH3COO)2 and NH4OH in an autoclave at 120 °C. Nickel–iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) has been deposited on the surface of Ta3N5 nanorods as a protection layer via a two-step hydrothermal reaction at 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively (Fig. 4c).26 Thin films (5–10 nm) of Ni:FeOOH were deposited on various semiconductors (e.g., WO3/BiVO4, hematite, TiO2 and Si) via a hydrothermal method at 100 °C to serve as an efficient water oxidation catalyst.27
2.3 (Photo)electrochemical deposition
The uniqueness of electrochemical deposition (ED) and photoelectrochemical deposition (PED) methods lies in the use of an external bias and sometimes illumination. On the one hand, it introduced more parameters, such as potential and current, to tune the composition, morphology and the corresponding performance of the deposited materials. On the other hand, the utilization of light to facilitate the deposition in the case of photoelectrochemical processes not only reduces energy input for the synthesis, but also improves the interface between the target materials (e.g., catalysts) and the receiving substrates for better charge transfer. Another benefit is the selectivity – catalysts will be deposited only where they are needed (e.g., where the photogenerated holes are for the OER reaction). The detailed mechanisms and examples of electrochemically deposited semiconductors and catalysts have been reviewed recently.28 For instance, a nickel–molybdenum (Ni–Mo) catalyst has been electrodeposited in the dark or under light illumination on various photocathode materials to serve as efficient HER catalysts. Digdaya et al. reported an amorphous SiC photocathode coated with Ni–Mo, which was potentiostatically deposited at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under standard AM 1.5G illumination from a mixed solution of nickel sulfate, boric acid and sodium molybdate.29 A similar deposition process was also reported by Pan et al. on Cu2O photocathodes, but with a constant current of −1.5 mA cm−2 during deposition and nickel sulfamate as the nickel precursor.30 In addition, various OER catalysts (e.g., transition metal (oxy)hydroxide) have been widely used on photoanode materials via ED/PED. For example, Liu et al. reported amorphous cobalt–iron hydroxide nanosheet catalysts with efficient OER activities in alkaline environments.31 Such catalysts were deposited on BiVO4 photoanodes at a constant potential of −1.42 V vs. Hg/Hg2SO4 from the electrolyte containing equivalent amounts of Co(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)2. Kim et al. showed that FeOOH and NiOOH deposited on the BiVO4 photoanode sequentially by the PED method improved its turn-on potential (Von) and photocurrent density (Jph) at the same time.32 A wide spectrum of semiconducting materials and catalysts has been successfully prepared by (photo)electrochemical methods, making the technique a facile tool for the synthesis of nearly all photoactive materials for solar fuel applications.
3 Representative thin-film materials for solar fuel synthesis
As one of the most exciting research areas during the past decade, solar fuel synthesis has attracted enormous attention. As such, nearly all photoactive materials have been exploited for the purpose of solar fuel synthesis. Comprehensive reviews on such efforts can be found here.33–35 Without repeating these prior publications, we mainly discuss thin film materials next. In doing so, our emphasis is placed on the common issues that limit the performance of a given material for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Representative strategies in addressing these issues on prototypical materials are presented. In this subsection, we use discussions on charge behaviors and stability as a common thread to organize the contents. Additional considerations such as catalysis are presented in the following subsections. We organize the contents in this way because there is rarely a semiconductor that can meet all the common issues. As a result, most of the studies on photolectrode materials have focused on solving one or multiple limitations of a certain material with other promising properties. By organizing the content in terms of undesired properties and the corresponding solving strategies, we hope readers can gain a clear understanding of the research efforts on developing thin-film materials for solar fuel synthesis.
As shown in Fig. 5, solar fuel synthesis on a solid-state material involves several key steps, including charge excitation, separation, transport and transfer. Of them, charge excitation is ensured by the optoelectronic properties of the materials. For semiconductors, the gap in the energy bands acts as a key enabling factor. Similar functionalities may be achieved following other mechanisms such as the plasmonic effect, the quantum confinement effect, or other similar effects on emerging materials (e.g., 2D materials). An important issue that needs research attention here is the energy of photons that can be absorbed and how they match the solar spectrum. As has been shown by the classical Shockley–Queisser analysis, the optimum absorption edge for a single absorber would be 1.34 eV for solar-to-electricity conversion. For the purpose of solar fuel synthesis, the free energy gain of the target reactions imposes another constraint to the consideration, and the optimum absorption edge would be 1.6 eV if the reaction is water splitting.36 Few materials match this absorption perfectly. A handful of examples whose absorption edges are close to this desired value present new challenges such as mismatch of the band edge positions and stability. We will discuss strategies aimed at addressing these issues in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.
 Fig. 5  The schematic shows the charge excitation, separation, transport and transfer process (green arrows) in an n-type semiconductor in contact with an aqueous electrolyte. ECB: potential of the conduction band minimum; EVB: potential of the valence band maximum; Eoxidation: potential of self-oxidation for the semiconductor; E(O2/H2O): potential of water oxidation. The undesired properties including poor light absorption, bulk/surface recombination, mismatch of energetics and instability are indicated by red arrows, with the corresponding strategies listed below as green text. The number of each strategy is also used in Table 1. 
The next step in solar fuel synthesis is charge separation and transport. Ideally, the only competing process of this step would be radiative recombination, the result of which would be photons that may be reabsorbed. In reality, however, recombination by a variety of other mechanisms constitutes the biggest loss in solar-to-electricity conversion. Efforts developed to address this issue arguably represent the biggest portion of materials-related research on solar fuels. We devote the bulk of Section 3.2 to these efforts.
After the charges emerge to the surface, how they are utilized would be the next issue to be addressed. The desired processes would be facile forward charge transfer for solar fuel synthesis. Competing processes, aside from surface recombination that may be regarded as a solid-state process, include corrosion (parasitic chemical reactions that damage the photoelectrode itself) and side reactions (parasitic reactions that compete with solar fuel formation). Moreover, the energetics at the solid/liquid interface is of critical importance. There are a handful of materials that are highly efficient in absorbing light, separating and transporting charges but feature significant mismatch of the energetics with desired solar fuel synthesis reactions. That is, the charges are simply not energetic enough to carry out the reactions as desired. We will discuss these issues in Section 3.3.

Table 1 summarizes reported efforts to address the common issues that limit the performance of a given material. The representative materials are organized in an alphabetic order of light absorbers considering that multiple strategies may be applied in one study. The configurations of photoelectrodes, strategies to address the issues (numbered in Fig. 5) and testing electrolytes (with pH if possible) are listed. When possible, the performance metrics including the turn-on potentials (Von), photocurrent density (Jph) and stability are also listed. All potentials in Table 1 and the main text are versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential if no specific reference electrode is referred to. For Jph in Table 1, positive values are for water oxidation at 1.23 V and negative values are for water reduction at 0 V. For stability, the testing time and the Jph during the test are noted.

3.1 Poor light absorption

3.1.1 Narrow the band gaps or add another light absorber to enhance light absorption. 
A common issue that limits the performance of materials with good optoelectronic properties (such as high light absorption coefficient, facile charge separation and transport) is the narrow absorption region relative to the overall solar spectrum. Two general strategies have been developed to address this issue, including narrowing the band gap and adding another light absorber. For instance, the utilization of TiO2 for practical water splitting is limited mainly by its wide band gap (3.2 eV for the anatase phase), even though it exhibits high incident photo-to-electron efficiencies and good chemical stability. The wide band gap means it can only absorb light in the deep UV region. It was hypothesized that the band gap might be narrowed through methods such as self-doping of Ti3+ and/or oxygen vacancies by chemical reduction or ion doping.37 To this end, Yang et al. reported core–shell nanostructured “black” rutile TiO2, which was synthesized by first forming a reduced shell of TiO2−x with TiO2 nanoparticles and then post annealing in H2S to dope S into the shell of the nanoparticles.38 Diffuse reflectance spectrum indicated that the band gap of the treated TiO2 was 1.3 eV narrower than pristine rutile TiO2. After being assembled into photoelectrodes by spin coating, the S-doped rutile TiO2 showed 30-fold increase of photocurrent density at 1.23 V and a negative shift of turn-on potential by 280 mV compared with pristine rutile TiO2 in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. It is noted that whether the broadened absorption is actually due to the shift of the band edge positions would require additional research.
A better accepted example in tuning the band structures by varying the compositions is found in nitride semiconductors. For instance, GaN features a direct band gap of 3.4 eV, with the conduction band and valence band edges straddling the water splitting potentials. As a photoelectrode, early turn-on potentials and a good fill factor have been obtained. Notwithstanding, its practical applications for solar water splitting are limited due to the wide band gap. To further actualize the promise held by this material, researchers have tried to incorporate In during the synthesis, which was shown to reduce the band gap from 3.4 eV (pure GaN) and to 0.65 eV (pure InN) (Fig. 6a).77 Significantly, the change of the band gap between the two extremes is continuous, depending on the In concentrations in GaN. When used for water splitting applications, a key challenge is the stability of the material. In one example of such efforts, In0.21Ga0.79N films (Eg = 2.3 eV) with an average thickness of 1 μm were synthesized on sapphire substrates by MOCVD.78 After being tested in 1 M HCl at 1.5 V vs. SCE under illumination, In and Ga elements were found in the electrolyte, confirming that the material is being etched during the test. In another example, AlOtaibi et al. reported the synthesis of InGaN/GaN core/shell nanowire arrays (L = 400–500 nm) on Si substrates.9 With a band gap of 2.38 eV, the integrated photoanode reached a 23 mA cm−2 at 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl in a 1 M HBr electrolyte under AM 1.5G illumination. Interestingly, the morphology and composition of the nanowires were confirmed to remain the same even after 24 hours of PEC measurements. The superior stability may be explained by the MBE growth itself, which leads to nitrides of N-termination. It has been shown by Kibria et al. that such a termination offers better stability than Ga termination, which is expected for MOCVD-grown materials.79

Another common application of InGaN is to serve as a photocathode. For example, using Mg as a dopant, Fan et al. reported the synthesis of 600 nm p-InGaN with 25% In composition, which was connected with n-GaN nanowires (150 nm) by tunnel junctions on a n+p-Si substrate (Fig. 6b).61 After decoration with Pt HER catalysts, the integrated photocathode achieved a saturated photocurrent density of −40.6 mA cm−2 at 0.26 V vs. NHE in 1 M HBr, almost twice that of platinized n+p-Si substrates (Fig. 6c). The improved performance was attributed to a combination of the antireflection effect by the nanowires, enhanced carrier extraction and reduced surface recombination. Notably, stable HER over 3 hours was observed at 0.06 V vs. NHE in 1 M HBr.
Tuning the band structures by changing the compositions of materials using methods such as MBE has been shown as a promising method to enhance light absorption by narrowing down the band gaps of semiconductors. By controlling the suitable compositions, the light absorption range can be extended from the ultraviolet part to the near-infrared region, covering the visible light spectrum. However, new issues are introduced by such approaches. For instance, to achieve low-defect and high-quality materials, high-vacuum techniques are usually necessary, greatly raising the cost of the synthesis process. Low-cost alternative synthesis methods, such as solution-based ones, tend to yield materials of inadequate quality that are characterized by low solar-to-chemical-energy efficiencies. How to balance the efficiency and cost will continue to be a key focus for efforts focused on tailoring optoelectronic properties of materials by changing their compositions.
Another strategy to broaden the range of light absorption is to complement the wide band gap material with narrow band gap absorbers. A large number of examples have been reported toward this direction. For example, Mayer et al. reported a dual-absorber photoanode consisting of Si nanowires (Si NWs) and α-Fe2O3.18 Thin films of α-Fe2O3 were deposited by ALD on the surface of high-aspect-ratio Si NWs with conformal coverage. Owing to the larger Eg (2.1 eV) of α-Fe2O3 compared with the one of Si (Eg = 1.1 eV), incident photons with longer wavelength (600 nm < λ < 1100 nm) were transparent for α-Fe2O3 and absorbed by the underlying Si. As a result, the utilization of the overall solar spectrum was improved. In addition, the appropriate band alignment between n-Si and α-Fe2O3 created an appreciable band-bending depth, providing additional photovoltages and guaranteed electron injection from α-Fe2O3 to Si. As expected, the dual-absorber photoanode showed a larger cathodic turn-on potential (0.6 V) and a higher photocurrent density in a 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte compared with the performance of a planar α-Fe2O3 thin film grown on a FTO-coated glass substrate. Similarly, Hwang et al. reported a photoanode consisting of n-type Si NWs and thin films (35 nm) of n-TiO2 on the surface.59 The construction of the n/n junction between n-Si and n-TiO2 not only improved the charge separation due to the band bending at the junction, but also introduced a potential barrier at the interface that blocked the holes back to the TiO2 layer and reduced the loss of holes. In one of these examples, a thin layer of g-C3N4 (Eg ∼ 2.7 eV) was deposited onto TiO2 nanorods by chemical bath deposition, leading to a red shift of light absorption in comparison with bare TiO2.71 An important consideration in approaches like this is how to manage charge flows. In this particular case, due to the formation of a heterojunction between TiO2 and C3N4, photogenerated electrons in C3N4 transfer to the conduction band of TiO2, and photogenerated holes move from TiO2 to C3N4. As a result, the TiO2/g-C3N4 combination enabled a photocurrent density of 1.15 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.8), 2.6 times that measured on bare TiO2. In theory, the strategy of combining materials of complementary light absorption would enable broad light absorption for high performance; in practice, however, how to build a low-defect and intimate interface between different materials remains a challenge.


3.1.2 Reduce reflection to avoid light absorption losses. 
As has been shown in research on solar cells, optical loss due to reflection contributes significantly to the low performance of planar semiconductor materials when used for solar energy harvesting applications. Several strategies have been developed to meet this challenge. In the first approach, light absorption was shown to be enhanced by constructing nanostructures on the surface. For example, Garnett et al. discovered that by carefully controlling the diameter and density of Si nanowires, the path length of incident solar irradiation was enhanced by up to a factor of 73 when compared with Si thin films of the same thickness, thanks to the strong light trapping effect by the nanowire morphologies (Fig. 7a–c).80 Maiolo et al. reported Si microwires synthesized through a vapor–liquid–solid method with Au as the catalyst.81 With a length between 10 and 30 μm, these Si wires showed enhanced photocurrent density and photovoltage in a 1,1′-dimethylferrocene (Me2Fc)+/0 redox system in CH3OH when compared with planar samples. Dai et al. reported Si nanowire (NW) arrays synthesized through a Ag seed assisted etching process.82 In comparison with planar silicon, the Si NWs showed broadband anti-reflection properties with an optical reflectance of ∼0%, while the planar one reflected 19% of sunlight at the Si–water interface.

The simulated absorption spectra are shown in dashed lines. (a–c) reprinted with permission from ref. 80. Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society. (d–f) from ref. 40. Reprinted with permission from AAAS. 
In another approach, designing suitable substrates underneath the semiconducting light absorber was also shown to enhance light absorption through recycling incident photons. For instance, Qiu et al. reported mesoporous BiVO4 deposited on a pre-designed nanocone substrate (Fig. 7d–f).40 The light absorption was enhanced due to light trapping through multiple light scattering in the nanocone structure. Simulations of the electromagnetic wave distribution at λ = 500 nm for Mo:BiVO4 on the nanocone substrate and a flat FTO-coated glass substrate indicated that the incident light was diffracted and redistributed in the nanocone area, owing to the match of the incident light wavelength and the distance between neighbouring nanocone arrays. The results were also supported by enhanced absorption by BiVO4 deposited on the nanocone substrate in the UV-vis absorption spectrum. Similarly, Shi et al. reported the introduction of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) layer to improve the performance of a tandem cell device consisting of a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode and DSSC.83 The DBR layer was placed on the back side of FTO glass for the BiVO4/WO3 photoanode and served as the conductive counter electrode for the DSSC. The DBR layer consisting of multiple layers of materials with high- and low-refractive indices would reflect short-wavelength photons (λ < 500 nm) while transmitting long-wavelength photons, leading to photon recycling by the BiVO4 photoanode. A ηSTH of 7.1% was achieved, corresponding to a Jph of 5.75 mA cm−2, which was 1.1 mA cm−2 higher than the one without DBR layers.
The strategies to reduce the light absorption can be widely implemented to different semiconductor materials. For instance, the light trapping effect and anti-reflection properties through nanostructuring have been achieved on various semiconductor platforms including Si, metal oxides and metal nitrides, etc. with carefully controlled dimensions and structures. In addition, it can serve the purpose of more than reducing the light reflection, such as enhancing the surface area for more catalytic sites and reducing charge recombination (more details in Section 3.2.1). At the same time, some issues may also occur due to enlarged contact area between semiconductors and electrolytes, such as more severe surface charge recombination. Future strategies need to balance between the benefits and drawbacks.

3.2 Bulk recombination

3.2.1 Nanostructuring to match the short diffusion length. 
In one scenario, the recombination of photo-generated charges would take place due to the mismatched diffusion length of charge carriers with the light penetration depth. For instance, hematite features a light penetration depth of 46 nm at a wavelength of 450 nm,84 but its hole diffusion length is reported to be 2–4 nm,85 meaning that most photogenerated holes would recombine with electrons before they are transferred to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. To address this issue, nanostructuring has been applied to reduce the distance of charge transfer from bulk to surface while still ensuring sufficient light absorption, resulting in improved charge collection efficiency. One better-known example of this strategy is the cauliflower-type silicon-doped hematite thin film synthesized by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) from Fe(CO)5 and tetraethoxysilane on FTO-coated glass at 415 °C, reported by Kay et al. in 2006.13 Its photocurrent density in 1 M NaOH at 1.23 V under AM 1.5G light illumination (100 mW cm−2) could reach 2.3 mA cm−2, which can be further improved to 2.7 mA cm−2 with the addition of Co2+ catalysts.
Another example was found in electrodeposited Cu2O, whose electron diffusion length (20 to 100 nm)86 is shorter than the light penetration depth (several μm at 2.4 eV)87 by a large margin. Increasing the aspect ratios of nanostructured Cu2O has proven to be a promising method to address this issue. For example, Luo et al. synthesized Cu2O nanowire arrays via anodization and post annealing treatments.44 A Cu(OH)2 nanowire was first formed by anodization; it was then converted to Cu2O during the post annealing in an Ar atmosphere at 600 °C, featuring diameters of 100–300 nm and lengths of 3–5 μm (Fig. 8a–d). Additional electrodeposited Cu2O was introduced to cover the exposed Cu substrate, which was shown to significantly reduce charge recombination due to the contact between the Cu substrate and the protection layer (Al-doped ZnO). With further decoration of TiO2 and RuOx (as the HER catalyst), the Cu2O nanowire photoelectrode achieved a −10 mA cm−2 at −0.3 V and a turn-on potential of 0.48 V in 0.5 M Na2SO4 buffered at pH 5 (Fig. 8e). By comparison, planar Cu2O films showed a −7.8 mA cm−2 at the same applied potential, indicating the effectiveness of the nanostructuring strategy.

Along the line of using nanostructures to help solve the mismatch between charge diffusion and optical depth, directly growing thin film light absorbers on nanostructures is yet another idea that has been exploited in the literature. For example, Lin et al. reported thin-film hematite (25 nm) grown on TiSi2 nanonets by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Fe2(OtBu)6 and H2O as precursors.17 The TiSi2 nanonet substrate not only provided a high surface area for better charge collection, but also served as a highly conductive charge collector. As a result, the nanonet-based hematite photoelectrodes achieved a 1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V in 1 M NaOH, which was three times higher than that of the planar thin film with the same thickness. To this end, Qiu et al.'s work of depositing mesoporous BiVO4 on nanocone substrates may be regarded as similar.40 Besides the ability to enhance the light absorption as mentioned previously, the nanocone structure reduced the charge transport distance in the photoelectrode, increasing charge collection efficiencies. Consequently, for the BiVO4 nanoporous film of the same thickness on a nanocone substrate and a flat FTO glass substrate, the former showed a much higher photocurrent density (4.18 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V in pH 7 phosphate buffer than the latter (2.10 mA cm−2). With the introduction of the Fe(Ni)OOH OER catalyst, the photocurrent density was further improved to 5.82 mA cm−2.
Another way of growing light absorbing nanostructures is to take advantage of templates with preformed nanoscale features. For instance, Ta3N5 nanorods were prepared using an anodization method with porous anodic alumina (PAA) as the template in a H3BO3 solution under high applied DC voltages (600–650 V), followed by high-temperature annealing in NH3.26,66,88 Using this method, Li et al. reported that 600 nm thick nanorod arrays showed enhanced photocurrent density at 1.23 V in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (by 2.2 times at pH 13) with IrO2 as a catalyst when compared with planar thin films of the same thickness and catalysts (Fig. 8g).88 The improvement was attributed to the decreased distance for the photo-generated holes to reach the Ta3N5 surface in the nanorod configuration. As far as Ta3N5 is concerned, although nanostructures have been shown to be effective in improving the performance, the hole diffusion distance still remains a debate. On the one hand, Ziani et al. reported carrier lifetimes ranging from 3.1 to 8.7 ps in Ta3N5 thin films based on transient spectroscopy measurements. These values would correspond to a diffusion length between 3 and 9 nm.89 On the other hand, Respinis et al. reported a carrier lifetime of 1.6 ms based on time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, corresponding to a diffusion length of 18000 nm.90 Further studies are necessary to reconcile the apparent discrepancies.
The advantages of nanostructuring have been discussed in Section 3.1.2. It is a versatile strategy for semiconductors suffering from short diffusion lengths. In addition, it may introduce more benefits at the same time, such as enhancing light absorption and increasing catalytic surface areas. However, large surface areas introduced by nanostructuring may also lead to side effects such as more defect states and more severe surface charge recombination.


3.2.2 Doping to enhance charge transport. 
In the literature, it has been commonly mentioned that high carrier concentration would improve charge collection. As will be summarized in this subsection, a number of efforts have been applied to increase charge carrier concentrations through approaches such as doping. However, how these approaches work has been poorly discussed. For instance, for an n-type semiconductor (e.g., metal oxide photoanode), dopants that are introduced to increase electron concentrations would decrease hole concentrations under equilibrium conditions according to the mass law. As such, these approaches may be regarded as decreasing bulk recombination thanks to the decrease of the minority carrier concentrations. A more common way of understanding the effect was often referred to in the literature as increasing the majority carrier concentration to improve the transport of photogenerated electrons (in the case of an n-type photoanode); as such, the utilization of photogenerated holes is improved, as well, due to reduced bulk recombination. These two views are actually consistent, just from different angles. A good example in this sub-category is found in hematite, which usually features relatively low majority carrier concentrations (<1018 cm−3).84 Doping has been popularly sought as an effective method to change the situation. An added benefit of doing so is the shift of the equilibrium Fermi levels of electrons (toward the more negative direction), so as to increase the splitting between the Fermi level and the water oxidation potentials and, hence, the degree of band bending for better charge separation.
For instance, Pt4+, in the form of chloroplatinic acid, was added into FeCl3-containing solutions during the synthesis of a β-FeOOH thin film on FTO coated glass at 100 °C, followed by a two-step annealing process at 550 °C and 800 °C to form Pt-doped hematite.51 With an optimized thickness (500 nm) of the hematite thin film and a Pt/Fe ratio of 5%, the photoelectrode exhibited 74% enhancement of photocurrent density at 1.23 V in comparison with the undoped one. The Mott–Schottky analysis showed that the donor density increased by one order of magnitude, supporting the role of Pt4+ as a dopant into hematite, which improved its electrical conductivity. Along the same line, Li et al. treated hydrothermally synthesized WO3 nanoflakes with chemical etching and reduction by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and ascorbic acid, respectively,91 resulting in porous WO3 nanoflakes with increased surface oxygen vacancies (due to the reduction of W6+ to W5+). The high oxygen vacancies not only increased the carrier concentrations, but also narrowed the band gap by 0.1 eV. Consequently, the water oxidation performance at 1.23 V in 1 M H2SO4 increased from 0.62 mA cm−2 for pristine WO3 nanoflakes to 1.10 mA cm−2 for the etch-reduced WO3 nanoflakes. In another study, Liew et al. synthesized Yb-doped WO3 thin films (with thicknesses of 400 to 520 nm) by co-sputtering of WO3 and Yb, followed by post annealing in air at 550 °C.76 EIS analyses indicated a decreased charge transfer resistance and an increased carrier concentration after <0.1 at% Yb doping, which was attributed to the increased oxygen vacancies due to the substitution of W6+ by Yb3+. As a result, the photocurrent densities increased from 0.5 mA cm−2 for bare WO3 to 1.3 mA cm−2 for Yb-doped WO3 at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl in 0.05 M Na2SO4 (pH = 5.4).
Mo6+ and W6+ have been shown to be the most significant dopant for BiVO4, which can substitute V5+ to increase the carrier concentrations. For example, Berglund et al. reported Mo and W doped BiVO4 by e-beam evaporation of Bi, V, Mo and W.42 Both W and Mo doped BiVO4 showed higher photocurrent density at 1.23 V than bare BiVO4, while W/Mo co-doped BiVO4 showed the highest value in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer solutions. In a different system, Han et al. introduced a gradient dopant profile to amorphous SiC to improve charge collection.64 A 10 nm p-type amorphous SiC was first deposited via boron doping in a PECVD growth process, followed by another 40 nm p-type amorphous SiC with a reduced dopant concentration and 40 nm intrinsic amorphous SiC. Due to the increased thickness of the depletion region between p-type and intrinsic SiC, the drift charge transport was enhanced in comparison to the diffusion-controlled process in intrinsic SiC, leading to an anodic shift of the turn-on potentials (∼200 mV). When coupled with a Si photovoltaic module, the photocathode achieved a photocurrent density of −5.1 mA cm−2 at 0 V in 0.1 M sulfamic acid with pH 3.75 under 1 sun illumination. The last example connects this line of research with those focused on improving photovoltaics through controlling the energetics within the buried junctions.
Doping is a promising strategy to enhance the charge transport. On the one hand, such a method has been well-developed in semiconductor fabrication industries, which provides a rich knowledge base to tap into. On the other hand, various dopant elements have been explored, offering many options to modify semiconductors. However, challenges still remain for the doping strategy, such as how to achieve uniform dopant distribution.

3.3 Surface recombination
Even for pristine semiconductors, their surfaces are rich in electronic states whether in a vacuum or in contact with a metal electrode. In addition to the types of states that would be abundant in bulk (e.g., due to dopants and/or impurities), surfaces feature unique defects such as dangling bonds and structural imperfections, which often introduce electronic states within the bandgap. These states are the origin for severe recombination at or near the surface. Significant research efforts have been devoted to understanding and addressing these recombination processes as they play important roles in defining the properties of the overall device. The situation is significantly more pronounced for photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical applications because the surfaces are now in contact with a liquid where chemical reactions take place. Besides the usual suspects that would introduce surface states, chemisorbed species that are either reactants, intermediates or products act as centers to promote charge recombination. Below we discuss strategies that have been attempted to study and deal with this issue.

3.3.1 Use electron/hole scavengers to study the extent of surface recombination. 
Among the various techniques to study surface recombination, using electron/hole scavengers has been widely applied as an important strategy. Taking hole scavengers as the example, they are usually reagents that can be more easily oxidized compared with water, which in principle can eliminate the surface charge recombination. To better reflect the effect, the photocurrent density (Jph) can be expressed via a simplified charge transfer process:92 Jph = Jabs × ηsep × ηinj(3.1)In the equation, Jabs is the photon absorption rate; ηsep is the separation efficiency, representing the fraction of holes reaching the electrode/electrolyte interface without recombining with electrons in the bulk; ηinj is the charge injection efficiency, representing the fraction of holes for a desired oxidation reaction (e.g., water oxidation or scavenger oxidation) without recombining with electrons at the surface. When the hole scavenger is present, ηinj should be 100%. With the assumption that the existence of hole scavenger does not affect Jabs and ηsep, ηinj for water oxidation can be derived from the ratio of Jph for water oxidation and hole scavenger oxidation. Furthermore, Jabs can be estimated from the light absorption spectrum of photoelectrodes. The measured Jph for hole scavenger oxidation can be used to calculate ηsep, helping to understand the extent of bulk recombination.
For instance, Zhong et al. used H2O2 as the hole scavenger to test BiVO4 photoanodes and compared it with the performance in the same electrolyte but without H2O2.93 The ηinj for water oxidation was less than 60% at 1.2 V, which was improved significantly to nearly 100% after the deposition of Co-Pi. This demonstrated the effectiveness of Co-Pi to enhance the charge injection efficiency for water oxidation and reduce the surface charge recombination. Similarly, Liu et al. compared the performance of bare Ta3N5 and Ta3N5 with Co3O4 nanoparticles using H2O2 as the hole scavenger.25 The ηinj for water oxidation increased from less than 20% to 70% at 1.23 V after the deposition of Co3O4, supporting the enhanced charge injection from photoanodes to water. In addition to studying the effect of passivation layer, the hole scavenger was also used to compare the extent of surface/bulk recombination in photoelectrodes prepared from different synthesis methods. For instance, Dotan et al. reported that hematite photoanodes prepared via ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) and APCVD showed different water oxidation performance.92 With the help of H2O2 as the hole scavenger, higher values of ηsep and ηinj for water oxidation were obtained for hematite synthesized by APCVD, indicating less bulk and surface recombination as well as better performance.
Using scavengers is a convenient yet powerful tool to understand the charge transfer behaviours in photoelectrodes. However, it also features some limitations. For instance, the ηinj derived here only represents the overall charge transfer from photoelectrodes to the electrolyte. It is hard to distinguish whether the change of ηinj is due to the change of reaction kinetics or surface charge recombination, especially when some passivation layers and catalysts are present. In addition, it is critical to choose suitable scavengers in order to obtain reasonable values of ηinj. For instance, Gao et al. found that the ηinj of CuWO4 photoanodes for water oxidation was underestimated when H2O2 was used as the hole scavenger.94 The reason was the electron injection from the radical intermediate of H2O2 oxidation to the conduction band of CuWO4, which made the expected 2-hole process a 1-hole process and led to current multiplications. Overall, more details about charge transfer behaviours can be revealed when more characterization tools such as photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and so on are combined. More studies about other techniques will be presented in Section 5.1.


3.3.2 Passivation layers. 
The most straightforward strategy may be to deposit a passivation layer on the surface of a semiconductor. For instance, a thin layer of metal oxides including Al2O3, In2O3 and Ga2O3 has been deposited on an ultrathin hematite (27–30 nm) photoanode via a urea hydrolysis CBD method.95 The idea was to replace the hematite|water interface with a hematite|oxide|water one. By doing so, researchers expect to reduce surface recombination unique to the hematite|water interface. The most direct evidence has been the reduction of the Fermi level pinning effect due to surface states, which is manifested by the increase of the photovoltage and, hence, a reduction of the turn-on potentials. Among those tested, Ga2O3 has proven to be highly effective, which negatively shifted the turn-on potential by 400 mV. The improvement was attributed to the matching crystal structures between Ga2O3 and hematite (<2.5% mismatch), resulting in low strains at the interface.
As will be further discussed later in this Review, the role played by the so-called “passivation layer” can be complex. A simple reduction in the turn-on potentials may be explained by at least three distinct mechanisms, including better catalysis, greater photovoltage or reduced recombination. These three mechanisms themselves are intricately interconnected, as well. For instance, better catalysis generally means faster forward charge transfer and, hence, reduced recombination; greater photovoltage implies better charge separation, which is typically a result of lower recombination. For this portion of discussion, we define these different functionalities as follows. When the surface modification forms a buried junction with the photoelectrode to yield better charge separation, we regard it as mainly improving the photovoltage; when the surface layer chiefly removes surface states to reduce recombination, we consider it a passivation layer; when the surface materials speed up forward electron transfer, we treat it as a catalyst. Within this context, effective catalysts have been widely exploited to improve the performance of photoelectrodes, especially for the sluggish water oxidation reactions. For example, dual-layered FeOOH/NiOOH was deposited on a mesoporous BiVO4 surface by photo-assisted electrodeposition in sequence.32 When BiVO4 decorated with dual-layered catalysts was compared with the bare one and the one with only FeOOH or NiOOH, in terms of the performance for water oxidation and sulfite oxidation, the one with dual-layered catalysts showed the earliest turn-on potentials and the highest water oxidation photocurrent densities. The effectiveness of combining FeOOH and NiOOH was attributed to the better interface formed between BiVO4 and FeOOH to reduce charge recombination, as well as more negative potential drop within the Helmholtz layer at the NiOOH/electrolyte interface (for more negative turn-on potentials) and better water oxidation kinetics. More examples will be discussed in Section 5 and the role of catalysts on semiconductor surfaces will be discussed in greater detail there.
Overall, using passivation layers to reduce surface recombination has been widely applied to improve the performance of photoelectrodes. Such a strategy offers a variety of materials choices to serve as passivation layers, which makes it versatile for different types of study platforms. In addition, the deposition of passivation layer may also shed light on solving other limitations of photoelectrodes. For instance, metal oxide passivation layers can also serve as protective layers to enhance the stability. A catalytic passivation layer, on the other hand, may improve the kinetics of desired reactions. At the same time, however, it also requires a deep understanding of the origins of surface recombination in order to choose a suitable passivation layer. In addition, the deposition of an extra layer on semiconductors may lead to a chance of introducing unexpected interfacial states, affecting charge transfer behaviours.


3.3.3 Surface reconstruction. 
Another strategy to deal with surface recombination is to change the crystal structure at the surface. For instance, Jang et al. reported a regrowth method to improve the performance of bare hematite.22 By repeating the solution-based synthesis of FeOOH and post-annealing procedures in air, the authors found the photovoltage generated by the bare hematite photoelectrode could be increased by 27%. During the re-growth, the surface structures of hematite were dissolved, and the newly grown structures favor the 〈110〉 directions, which reduced the short-range structure disorder on the surface (Fig. 9a). In another study, NaBH4 was used as the H2 source to treat the hydrothermally synthesized hematite at 500 °C.48 Such a treatment mainly introduced oxygen vacancies on the surface of hematite, which was supported by the decrease of prepeak intensities in the surface-sensitive soft X-ray O K-edge XAS spectra in combination with the unchanged peak intensities in the bulk-sensitive hard X-ray Fe K-edge XAS spectra. The authors argued that the optimized oxygen vacancy content on the surface improved the conductivity of hematite and reduced the hole–electron recombination. As a result, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V increased from 0.88 mA cm−2 for pristine hematite to 2.28 mA cm−2 for the H2-treated hematite.

As is true in other complex systems, changes intended for the improvement of one aspect of the system may inadvertently impact another aspect negatively. For instance, increasing oxygen vacancies could be an effective strategy to increase carrier concentrations in WO3 (e.g., Section 3.2.2), but they may also induce surface recombination. In an effort to achieve the positive effect of oxygen vacancies while minimizing their negative impacts, Zhang et al. reported a synthesis procedure combining H2 annealing and O3 treatment, in which case H2 annealing was shown to increase oxygen vacancies in the bulk of WO3 while the subsequent O3 treatment decreased oxygen vacancies on the surface (Fig. 9c–e).72 The Mott–Schottky analysis supported the increase of donor densities after H2 treatments, which remained after O3 treatment. The lowest peak intensities in the photoluminescence spectra of H2/O3 treated samples indicated effective suppression of surface charge recombination, supporting the effect of reducing surface oxygen vacancies. As a result, the H2/O3 treated photoelectrode showed a cathodic shift of turn-on potential (0.15 V) and increased photocurrent densities at 1.23 V in comparison to the samples that were just treated by H2.
Compared with depositing a passivation layer to reduce surface recombination, surface reconstruction avoids the formation of an additional interface, lowering the risk of generating more interfacial defects. However, such a strategy is material-specific and the knowledge obtained from one case study needs to be justified before being transferred to other study platforms.

3.4 Mismatch of energetics
For successful solar-to-chemical conversion reactions, it is of critical importance to match the energetics of the photoelectrode with the desired chemical reactions. In the case of significant mismatches, the photo-generated charges collected from the photoelectrode would not be energetic enough to drive the chemistry in the electrolyte. For instance, while CdSe is efficient in absorbing light and separating charges, photo-generated holes in this material would feature electronic energies too negative for H2O oxidation.96 As such, we do not see examples of using this material for H2O oxidation applications. Instead, sacrificial electron donors are often involved when CdSe is studied in the context of solar fuel synthesis. A more common issue we encounter in the literature that concerns energetic mismatch is the relatively low photovoltages. Si is a good example. In a vacuum, the potential of the valence band maximum (EVB) of Si would be too negative for H2O oxidation; yet, due to the existence and/or formation of native oxides on the surface, Si photoanodes have been successfully used for PEC H2O oxidation, albeit with a low photovoltage as featured by the late turn-on potentials (Fig. 10a).97 Two general strategies have been tested to address this issue, forming buried junctions or tuning the band edge positions.

3.4.1 Forming buried junctions. 
The flat-band potential of Cu2O has been reported at around 0.7 V, which limits the maximum photovoltage when used for H2O reduction. In order to address this issue, a buried p–n junction has been applied to enhance the photovoltage. One example is to replace the Cu2O/H2O interface with a Cu2O/ZnS interface.19 Due to the more negative conduction band edge position and the more negative Fermi level of ZnS relative to the HER potential, the strategy increased the band bending within Cu2O for a turn-on potential of 0.72 V; by comparison, Cu2O without ZnS showed a Von of only 0.6 V in 0.2 M KH2PO4 at pH 7. The increased photovoltage was confirmed by the light open-circuit potential measurements under various light intensities. Another example is reported by Li et al., in which the authors deposited a thin layer of Ga2O3 buffer between Cu2O and TiO2 (as a protection layer) by ALD.45 The idea was to maximize band bending within Cu2O by introducing Ga2O3. Through photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, they found that the conduction band offset between Cu2O and Ga2O3 was in the range of −0.37 to +0.01 eV, suggesting that in addition to a large degree of band bending, electron transfer across the Ga2O3 layer should be facilitated. A stark comparison could be made between Ga2O3 and ZnO, which would also serve the purpose of increasing band bending when integrated with Cu2O. But ZnO features a significant mismatch with Cu2O in terms of the potential of the conduction band minimum (ECB), which would impede electron transfer from Cu2O to ZnO. As such, ZnO is much less desired for the same purpose (Fig. 10b and c). Indeed, a turn-on potential of 1.02 V was achieved for the integrated Cu2O|Ga2O3|TiO2 photoelectrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 buffered at pH 4.26. Pan et al. further advanced this strategy by integrating nanowire nanostructuring, a Ga2O3 buffer layer, a TiO2 protection layer and RuOx as HER catalysts.30 Together, a turn-on potential >1 V and a photocurrent density of −10 mA cm−2 at 0 V, as well as stability over 100 h were obtained at pH 5.
Using a similar strategy on a different material, Digdaya et al. improved the performance of amorphous SiC.63 They deposited a thin layer (25 nm) of n-TiO2 on a-SiC (100 nm) by ALD, replacing the original semiconductor/liquid electrolyte interface with a p-i-n solid junction. Under illumination, photo-generated holes would drift to the p-type amorphous SiC layer and electrons to the n-type TiO2. Due to the formation of a buried junction, the photovoltage was increased by 300 mV. After the electrodeposition of active HER catalysts, Ni–Mo, the integrated thin-film photocathode achieved a turn-on potential of 0.8 V and a photocurrent density of −8.3 mA cm−2 at 0 V in pH 4 phosphate buffer. In addition to forming a buried junction, the TiO2 layer also enhanced the adhesion of the catalysts to the surface, leading to stable HER operation for 12 h.
In addition to aforementioned examples, forming buried junctions has been applied in various semiconductor materials such as Si, III–V compounds, etc., which has been shown as an effective way to improve the photovoltage output. However, some challenges still need to be addressed in this process, such as how to create a defect-free interface and how to achieve uniform deposition on high-aspect-ratio substrates, etc.


3.4.2 Tuning band edge positions. 
Although Si features high photocurrent density as photoelectrodes, its photovoltage has been limited. When it was used as a photocathode, the photovoltage has been limited to 400 mV without additional buried junctions. As a photoanode, theoretically it cannot oxidize water due to the negative position of the EVB. The issue has been shown to be partially addressable by strategies such as forming a metal–insulator–semiconductor interface (e.g., Ni–SiO2–Si), where a high photocurrent density was measured. But the turn-on potential was still relatively positive (1 V), representing a photovoltage of only 0.23 V.98 To further address this problem, amorphous silicon has been developed. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon has a continuously random bonding network, resulting in a relatively large band gap (1.7 eV) and more positive EVB for improved photovoltage and better alignment with water oxidation energy levels. Additionally, a-Si has been shown to be a much more efficient light absorber due to the direct nature of the band gap. Importantly, knowledge of semiconductor thin film growth makes it facile to control the doping type and level of a-Si with ease, making it possible to utilize it for both oxidation and reduction reactions readily. To this end, Lin et al. reported a-Si with a buried p-i-n structure.16 Using a glass substrate decorated with 1.8 μm thick pyramidally textured ZnO, 250 nm intrinsic a-Si (active light absorber) were sandwiched between thin layers of p-type and n-type nanocrystalline silicon via plasma-enhanced CVD. After further decoration of a TiO2 protection layer and Pt HER catalysts, the photocathode showed a turn-on potential of 0.93 V and a photocurrent density of 11.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V in pH 4 phosphate buffer under 1 sun illumination. The reported turn-on potential was even more positive than what was obtained on n+p-Si (usually limited to 0.54 V).
Compared with forming buried junctions, tuning the band edge positions of semiconductors to solve the mismatch of energetics can avoid the risk of forming interfacial defects between different layers. However, only a handful of materials can be modified using such a method, which limits its applications.

3.5 Instability
Among the issues discussed in this section, instability of photoelectrodes is arguably the most unique to photoelectrochemical applications. Concerns such as narrow light absorption, bulk and surface recombination and charge transport are shared by other semiconductor-based applications. But instability defines photoelectrochemical systems because only for this application does one need to subject a semiconductor material to harsh conditions – intense illumination plus extreme pH environments with high salt concentrations. Broadly speaking, we refer to instability as the rapid degradation of the photoelectrode performance. The phenomenon may be attributed to at least three distinctly different causes: (1) the deactivation of the active sites by mechanisms such as accumulation of by-products; here little change to the photoelectrode itself occurs; (2) the deactivation of the photoelectrode due to the loss of photovoltages, where the photoelectrode loses or gains little in a physical sense; (3) significant changes to the photoelectrode due to corrosion during the chemical and/or photoelectrochemical reactions.

3.5.1 The accumulation of byproducts due to parasitic chemical reactions. 
It has been shown that the formation and accumulation of peroxo species on WO3 surfaces during water oxidation may lead to the loss of photoactivities.99 The mechanism is to be differentiated from corrosion, which is well known for WO3 at higher pH (e.g., >4) due to the loosely bound WO3(H2O)x species on the surface.100 How to suppress the side reaction will be the key to reactivate the photoelectrode. Seabold et al. reported that the deposition of Co-Pi on WO3 improved the photocurrent to O2 conversion efficiency from 61% to 100%.75 At the same time, the WO3 was shown to be stable under water oxidation conditions for 12 h after the deposition of Co-Pi in pH 7 phosphate buffer, while the bare one lost 63% of its initial photocurrent density within 1 h (Fig. 11a and b). Other than introducing OER catalysts, Ma et al. used a solution-based reducing reagent, LEDA (lithium dissolved in ethylenediamine), to create an amorphous overlayer on a mesoporous WO3 photoanode.23 Consisted of both oxygen vacancies and tungsten vacancies, such an amorphous layer improved charge transfer efficiency, reducing the formation of peroxide species due to hole accumulation. As a result, both the photocurrent density/turn-on potential and the stability were improved. In a different approach, Wang et al. tailored the orientation of exposed facets during the hydrothermal growth of WO3.74 With increased (002) facets as opposed to (200) facets in WO3, the photocurrent density at 1.23 V was improved from 2.1 mA cm−2 to 3.1 mA cm−2, with the stability also enhanced. Such a result was attributed to the reduced electron–hole recombination and inhibited peroxo-species on (002) facets.

3.5.2 Deactivation of the photoelectrode due to loss of photovoltages. 
It has been commonly observed that the performance of Ta3N5 quickly decayed during water oxidation, which was generally attributed to the oxidation of nitrides. Indeed, nitride oxidation was observed after water oxidation, confirming the formation of oxides. However, it was unclear how the surface oxidation was related to the performance decay. Another puzzle about Ta3N5 is the positive turn-on potentials for water oxidation (>0.6 V), which is significantly higher than what one would expect from the material based on measurements of the band edge positions and Fermi levels in a vacuum. He et al. reported a detailed study on the detailed changes on the surface of Ta3N5 during water oxidation using a combination of photoelectrochemical methods, high-resolution electron microscopy and X-ray core-level spectroscopy (Fig. 11c–f).69 It was found that the oxidation of Ta3N5 nanotubes to tantalum oxide was self-limited on the surface during water oxidation, leading to the formation of a relatively thin amorphous oxide layer (∼3 nm). The surface oxidation process not only introduced increased charge transfer resistance, but also shifted the Fermi level positively by 200 mV, leading to significant Fermi-level pinning that greatly limits the measurable photovoltages. Moreover, chemisorption of H2O onto Ta3N5 alone was found to introduce an additional positive shift of the flat-band potential by nearly 600 mV. This shift explains why most reports on Ta3N5 only observed highly positive turn-on potentials when characterizing the material in water. By comparison, a much less positive potential could be measured in nonaqueous systems, such as acetonitrile. The results imply that even though surface oxidation is relatively mild when measured by thickness, the reaction could suppress the achievable performance of nitrides by a large margin.


3.5.3 Corrosion. 
BiVO4 in near-neutral and alkaline solution is known to be susceptible to chemical and photochemical corrosion, although thermodynamically it is expected to be stable. Toma et al. studied the instability of polycrystalline BiVO4 using various methods, including SEM, TEM, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), in situ electrochemical AFM, ICP-MS and computational prediction.101 It was found that the V in BiVO4 dissolved in the electrolyte. Thermodynamically, a self-passivation process should take place via the formation of chemically stable bismuth oxide on the BiVO4 surface. However, such a process is kinetically hindered at room temperature in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of defective and unstable bismuth oxide or hydroxide. As a result, bulk dissolution of BiVO4 occurs, which would be accelerated by illumination, increased pH and/or applied bias (Fig. 12). It was hypothesized that the photo-induced chemical instability may be a result of the accumulation of holes on the surface and the formation of reactive oxygen species, which could oxidize Bi3+ to Bi5+ or oxidize O2− to O−. To address the instability issue, one common strategy was to incorporate protection layers to avoid the contact between BiVO4 and H2O, and introduce the OER catalyst to guide the hole transfer for water oxidation instead of self-oxidation. Another class of materials that have been intensely studied for their corrosion problems are high-efficiency phosphides and/or arsenides. More details will be discussed next in the strategies on how to protect them.

3.5.4 Protection strategies. 
One common strategy to protect unstable materials is to conceal the reactive surface altogether by one or multiple protection layers. Stable oxide materials (e.g., TiO2) have been used to serve this purpose. The key here is to achieve uniform and compact deposition of protective materials with appropriate thicknesses, so that the contact between the electrolyte and the semiconductor can be separated to prevent corrosion, yet efficient charge transfer across the protection is ensured. Due to the lack of inherent catalytic activities on such protection layers, catalysts are often required. In addition, one should manage light absorption so that the protection layer does not compete with the active material in absorbing in the visible range. For the ease of discussion, we summarize materials studied for the purpose of protection based on their types below.
Catalytically inactive oxide/nitride materials. 
Metal oxides with wide band gaps have been studied extensively as a protection layer for both photocathodes and photoanodes. TiO2 is one of the most representative examples for this purpose, which has been applied to various photoelectrode materials including Si,10,16,97 III–V semiconductors,54,56,57,97 unstable metal oxides (Cu2O,19,30,44,46 BiVO4,20etc.) and metal chalcogenides (CZTS,24etc.). For instance, TiO2 has been reported to serve as a protective material on various photocathodes. Gu et al. reported bilayer protection of GaInP2 photocathodes by amorphous TiOx and MoSx,57 which were deposited by ALD and electrochemical deposition, respectively. Further annealing in an Ar atmosphere at 450 °C improved the crystallinity of MoS2 and TiO2, and led to the formation of a hybrid interface between MoS2 and TiO2 in the form of MoSx/MoOyOz/MoOx/TiO2. Compared with the as-deposited photoelectrode, the annealed one showed not only better fill factors but also enhanced stability. After 20 h of photoelectrolysis at 0 V in 0.5 M H2SO4, the photocurrent density of the as-deposited one decreased from 10 mA cm−2 to 5 mA cm−2, while the annealed one only decreased by less than 20%. In terms of using TiO2 to protect photoanodes, Verlage et al. synthesized III–V tandem cells using MOCVD on n+-GaAs (100).54 The tandem light absorber consisted of an InGaP top cell (Eg = 1.84 eV, 550 nm) and a GaAs bottom cell (Eg = 1.42 eV, 3200 nm), connected by an AlGaAs/GaAs tunnel junction (40 nm). An amorphous, hole-conducting TiO2 layer (62.5 nm) was deposited on the light absorber surface by ALD to prevent photocorrosion as well as to serve as an anti-reflection coating, with additional 2 nm Ni as the OER catalyst (Fig. 13a). When connected to a Ni–Mo cathode in 1 M KOH electrolyte, the device was shown to split water without an external bias at a current density of 8.5 mA cm−2 under 1 sun illumination, which decreased to 7.3 mA cm−2 after 80 h of operation (Fig. 13b). Similar protection layer/catalyst combinations have been shown to be effective in protecting photoanodes of a variety of compositions, including Si, GaP, GaAs and BiVO4.97

Oxide materials as a protection layer face limitations when directly applied to nitride semiconductors (e.g., Ta3N5), which are often sensitive to oxidative conditions. To address this issue, Zhong et al. reported a GaN-protected Ta3N5 photoanode.8 In this study, GaN (50 nm) was synthesized by e-beam evaporation and subsequent nitridation. With Co-Pi as the OER catalyst, the protected photoanode showed a turn-on potential of 0.65 V and a photocurrent density of 8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 13). Importantly, it achieved stable water oxidation at 1.2 V for 10 h (Fig. 13c). Control samples of Ta3N5 without GaN quickly decayed within 1 h, due to the formation of surface oxides (also see Section 3.5.2).
Catalytically active materials. 
Another strategy to protect the photoactive material is to minimize parasitic chemical reactions such as corrosion by speeding up the desired chemical reactions. That is, using catalysts to facilitate charge transfer for desired solar fuel synthesis may be regarded as a good strategy for protection purposes. For water oxidation, transition metal oxide/hydroxides (e.g., CoOx,25,62 Co(OH)2,26,70 Ni(OH)2,21,68,102 NiFe-LDH,27etc.) have been commonly used. For water reduction, precious metal catalysts (e.g., Pt19,47,103) or non-noble-metal catalysts (e.g., MoS257,104) are usually applied. For example, efficient electrocatalysts such as Pt and MoS2 have been shown to stabilize high-performance photocathodes. MoS2 has been used to protect GaInP2, as reported by Britto et al.104 Thin-film GaInP2 (∼200 nm) was coated by a thin layer (3.6 nm) of Mo metal, which was partially converted to MoS2 through sulfurization. In a sulfuric acid electrolyte (ca. 3 M), bare GaInP2 showed quick performance decay (within minutes) and complete failure after several hours due to dissolution. In stark contrast, GaInP2 coated with Mo/MoS2 showed enhanced turn-on potentials during the initial test (presumably due to more exposed edge sites of MoS2) and stable HER performance for 60 h. Along this line, Kumagai et al. reported that the performance of a CIGS photocathode could be improved significantly by adding a thin layer of Ti/Mo between CIGS/CdS and Pt.7 The authors attributed the phenomenon to better electron transfer from CIGS/CdS to Pt. The stability of the integrated photocathode was improved to 10 days.
It is important to note that the protection effect by similar materials is apparent as long as efficient charge extraction from the semiconductors is achieved. For instance, Liu et al. reported that a hydrothermally deposited ferrihydrite layer on Ta3N5, when coupled with Co3O4 OER catalysts, could significantly improve the stability of the latter to up to 6 h (Fig. 13d and e).25 As a comparison, Ta3N5 with only Co3O4 showed 70% of decay within 2 h. The role of the ferrihydrite was revealed as a storage layer for photogenerated holes in the form of positively charged states. Besides the ferrihydrite, the combination of Ni(OH)x and MoO3 was shown to work well as a hole storage layer for the protection of Ta3N5.102 When used alone on Ta3N5, the Ni(OH)x/MoO3 layer featured low charge injection efficiency (<15%) and, therefore, is an inefficient OER catalyst.
Overall, protective layers have become a critical component for high-efficiency but unstable semiconductor materials. Numerous research efforts have been devoted to this research direction, and various types of protective materials have been reported, providing a rich knowledge base for their applications in different study platforms.
Other strategies. 
In addition to depositing protection materials, modifying the photoelectrode|electrolyte interface by strategies such as changing the structures of the semiconductors or altering the compositions of the electrolytes has been reported as effective in addressing the instability issues. To this end, Kuang et al. reported that the crystallinity of BiVO4 nanoparticles was enhanced after a two-step high temperature annealing treatment (800 °C–ball milling–700 °C).41 These nanoparticles exhibited inherently better stability against photocorrosion in comparison to nanoworm BiVO4, which was obtained by annealing at 450 °C. With the introduction of self-generation and regeneration of NiFe-based OER catalysts, the stability was further extended to >1000 h. In terms of surface modification, by tuning the exposed surface of single crystalline GaN to be N-terminated, Kibria et al. found that MBE-grown GaN showed better photostability than the ones grown by conventional MOCVD, whose Ga-terminated surfaces could be easily oxidized to Ga2O3 in the presence of oxygen/H2O and dissolved in the electrolyte, leading to photocorrosion as well as Fermi level pinning.79 Moreover, since the loss of V5+ was involved in the photocorrosion of BiVO4, Lee et al. introduced a V5+-saturated 1 M borate buffer (pH 9.3) for water oxidation test.39 Based on the Le Châtelier principle, the dissolution of V5+ was hindered. As a result, the stability of the BiVO4 photoelectrode was improved. With additional decorations of FeOOH/NiOOH OER catalysts, the stability of BiVO4 in the V5+-saturated electrolyte was extended to 500 h.
Compared with the deposition of protective layers, the aforementioned strategies reduced the decoration materials on semiconductors, simplifying the photoelectrode configurations. However, the broad applications of these strategies beyond the case studies remain to be seen.

3.6 Other issues

3.6.1 High fabrication cost. 
In addition to materials’ cost, the fabrication process itself could incur significant cost. In general, the cost concern limits the scale of implementation for many high-performance materials, especially III–V semiconductors (e.g., GaAs, InGaP, etc.). Many strategies developed to reduce costs of solar cells are expected to be transferrable to solar fuel synthesis, as well. For example, while effective in synthesizing high quality semiconductor thin films, MOCVD tends to be an expensive process. An even more expensive part, however, comes from the usage of single-crystalline III-V substrates for epitaxial growth of solar cell-grade materials. To address this problem, researchers have optimized the synthesis so that the expensive substrates may be recycled for repeated growths. Moreover, other less expensive synthesis methods have been explored to replace the MOCVD, which has been reviewed elsewhere.105 Similar arguments are equally applicable to MBE processes.106
As an example of transferring knowledge learned in research on photovoltaics to solar fuel applications, Kang et al. fabricated GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs based photocathodes and photoanodes using epitaxial lift-off and printing-based assemblies (Fig. 14).11 During the synthesis, p-on-n or n-on-p epitaxial GaAs solar cells were first grown on a GaAs wafer, which were later lifted off and printed on glass substrates. Pt and IrOx·nH2O were deposited to serve as the water reduction and oxidation catalysts, respectively. Such a design allows the reuse of the expensive growth wafer, offering a significant reduction of material costs. Similarly, Young et al. reported the synthesis of inverted metamorphic multi-junctions for water splitting.55 The growth substrate (GaAs) was ca. 100 times thicker than the active light absorbers, which would be a significant waste of expensive materials. A selective chemical etching process was introduced to remove the GaAs substrate after the device was bonded to a flat, rigid Si wafer as a handle. As a result, the expensive GaAs substrate could be reused for the next growth.

3.6.2 Charge recombination at the semiconductor/substrate interface. 
As discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, charge recombination in the bulk or near the surface can lead to decreased charge collection efficiency. In another case, charge recombination can take place at the semiconductor/substrate interface. For example, the formation of a “dead layer” at the hematite–substrate interface, especially in an ultrathin film (with thickness <50 nm), was believed as the result of lattice strains between hematite and the substrate (usually FTO), which would lead to imperfect crystal structures near the interface and induce charge recombination.107 Hisatomi et al. reported that a thin layer of Ga2O3 (2 nm) between the FTO substrate and hematite can serve as an isomorphic structure template for the growth of ultrathin hematite (27 nm) due to their similar crystal structures. After the FTO substrate was modified with Ga2O3, the crystallinity of hematite was improved based on the increased peak intensity observed in XRD. As a consequence, the turn-on potential was cathodically shifted by 200 mV and the photocurrent density at 1.23 V was improved by 15 times.95 Zandi et al used ALD to synthesize Ti-doped hematite by tuning the numbers of Ti precursor (titanium isopropoxide) pulses and Fe precursor (ferrocene) pulses during the ALD process.108 Although Ti4+ has been reported to serve as the dopant to improve the donor density in hematite, the introduction of Ti in this study showed no effect on carrier concentration. Instead, the bulk properties were improved with hole mobility and/or the hole lifetime enhanced after the introduction of Ti, which was due to the elimination of the dead layer. In addition, EIS analysis indicated that a higher density of active sites for water oxidation was achieved after the Ti doping.

4 Thin film protection layer
Thin-film protection materials for photoelectrodes have been recently reviewed in detail.4,5 Here we briefly summarize those thin-film protection materials based on their method of protection. One method protects the semiconductor by isolating the unstable surface from the aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the photoelectrochemical or chemical dissolution of the semiconductor. We refer to this protection method as a physical barrier layer. The other method inhibits photocorrosion of semiconductors by selectively tuning the pathway of photogenerated charge carriers to the desired chemical reactions opposed to the corrosion. Since this method of protection relies on optimizing relative rates of reactions, we refer to it as a kinetic protection layer. Some examples of thin-film protection layers have been discussed in Section 3.5.4.
4.1 Physical barrier protection layer
In order to fully isolate the unstable semiconductors from the aqueous electrolyte, the protection layers are required to be ion-impermeable and pin-hole free. Therefore, deposition techniques that feature uniform coating of dense materials, such as PVD and CVD, are usually applied to deposit the films. On the other hand, since this type of material is catalytically non-active, it's important to control its thickness to be thin and conductive so that the photo-generated charge carriers can be transferred to the catalyst/electrolyte.
Metal thin films such as Ti109 or Pd110 have been demonstrated to protect crystalline Si photocathodes and photoanodes. The metals can form Schottky-junctions with semiconductors and serve as conductive layers, and the photogenerated electrons or holes can be separated and transferred to solution. One limitation of using metal protection layers is the competition of light absorption with the semiconductor underneath. One way to overcome this drawback is to illuminate from the back side of the photoelectrode instead of the electrolyte side. For example, Bae et al. reported that by thinning a p-Si photocathode from 350 μm to 30 μm by wet etching, increased photocurrent density was observed by illuminating the Si from the back side.111 In this configuration, the protection was achieved by depositing Ti/TiO2 (5/100 nm) on the surface. Kang et al. changed the catalytic side of a photoelectrode from the semiconductor/electrolyte junction to the ohmic contact/electrolyte interface using printing-based material assemblies.11 In this case, the “thick” layer of metal contact (AuGe/Ni/Au: 100 nm/30 nm/150 nm) was used to separate the GaAs photocathode from an aqueous electrolyte, realizing 8 hours of stable HER. The unprotected one showed quick performance decay within 2 hours.
As discussed in Section 3.5.4, stable metal oxides and nitrides have been developed as protection layers. For example, amorphous TiO2 has been deposited on a BiVO4 photoanode by ALD, followed by sputtering of Ni on the surface as the OER catalyst.20 With the thickness around 1 nm, this amorphous protection layer achieved stable water oxidation in a pH 13 electrolyte for 120 min, while the bare BiVO4 showed quick decay of performance within 20 min due to the chemical and photoelectrochemical dissolution. On the photocathode side, it has been reported that Cu2O photocathodes can be stabilized via the deposition of ZnO (20 nm) and TiO2 (10 nm) by ALD.46 It should be noted here that the deposition of TiO2 alone didn’t stabilize the photocathode, which was attributed to the formation of pin-holes between the Cu2O/TiO2 interface due to non-uniform growth even upon using ALD. The insertion of ZnO between Cu2O and TiO2 might provide a more uniform hydroxylated surface for TiO2 to achieve conformal deposition. This demonstrates the important synthetic challenge of depositing pin-hole free protection layers to achieve long-term stability.
In addition, some carbon-based materials, such as graphene, have also been used to protect photoelectrodes like macroporous silicon wafers.112 Zhang et al. reported carbon-protected Cu2O nanowire arrays that showed improved stability with a carbon layer compared with the bare nanowires.113 The thin, uniform layer of carbon (20 nm) was deposited via the decomposition of a glucose solution on Cu2O at 550 °C in an N2 atmosphere. The carbon-protected Cu2O also showed photocurrent enhancement from −2.28 mA cm−2 to −3.95 mA cm−2 at 0 V, and the photocurrent decay was inhibited from 87.4% to 19.3% over a 20 min stability test.
4.2 Kinetic protection layer
As discussed above, catalysts are usually necessary to improve water oxidation and reduction performance no matter which semiconductors are studied as the photoelectrodes. Since the nature of photocorrosion is usually the reaction between semiconductors and photo-generated carriers in the presence of H2O, protecting the material by transferring the photo-generated carriers from the semiconductor to the desired chemical reaction should be effective. Indeed, various OER and HER catalysts have been demonstrated to reduce the degree of photocorrosion (some examples have been discussed in Section 3.5.4).
For example, ultrathin Ni metal (2 nm) films have been demonstrated to protect planar n-Si photoanodes.98 The role of Ni was to form a semiconductor–insulator–metal (Si–SiO2–Ni) junction to improve the charge separation of Si, as well as form OER catalyst species on the surface. Combined with a potassium borate and lithium borate electrolyte, the integrated photoanode was shown to be stable against photocorrosion for 3 days. It was suspected that the Li+ helped eliminate the formation of α-phase Ni(OH)2, thus avoiding large volume expansion of Ni layers during the oxidation process and enhancing the stability.
One important factor limiting the protection ability of thin-film catalysts is the chemical instability of catalysts under operating conditions. To address this issue, Kuang et al. recently reported an in situ regeneration method to deposit a NiFe-based OER catalyst on BiVO4 to extend its stability.41 With Ni as the substrate, the BiVO4 photoanode showed gradual performance enhancement during the stability test in a borate buffer (pH 9). This was attributed to the formation of an amorphous NiFe-based catalyst (∼5 nm), where the Ni2+ comes from dissolution of the NiO and Ni(OH)2 layers on the Ni substrate and the Fex+ species comes from impurities in the electrolyte. Long-term stability of over 1000 hours has been achieved, due to the regeneration of the NiFe-based catalyst on BiVO4 sites where the catalyst has been exfoliated or dissolved. Low concentration of Ni2+ (<1 μM) and the borate electrolyte are key factors for this strategy. Higher concentration of Ni2+ caused overloading of the catalyst to increase surface charge recombination, while the choice of other electrolytes, such as phosphate, accelerated the catalyst dissolution.
The application of catalysts as protection layers has its own limitations. First, the relatively slow kinetics of water oxidation and water reduction makes it difficult to fully inhibit the photocorrosion via kinetic control. Second, the stability of catalysts can be an issue. The stability includes both the structural stability of catalysts and their attachment to the substrate. Third, there are more and more reports indicating that porosity and ion permeability are critical to achieve high-performance OER catalysts and form a favorable interface with semiconductors, such as the transition-metal-based (oxy)hydroxide. As a result, the contact between unstable semiconductors and water may not be completely avoided. Therefore, the combination of both types of protection layer may ultimately be the winning strategy to achieve optimized stability and performance of photoelectrodes.
5 Thin film catalysts
The performance of thin film catalysts on photoelectrodes is not only affected by the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst, but also by the interface between the catalyst and semiconductor. An understanding along this direction is critical to design efficient photoelectrode systems. In addition, the problems introduced by the catalysts, such as the parasitic light absorption, need to be carefully considered in order to optimize the overall performance.
5.1 The role of catalysts on photoelectrodes
It has become widely recognized that catalysts are critical components in photoelectrode configurations in order to achieve high performance for both OER and HER. For OER, various catalysts including precious metal (e.g. Ir52,53,114,115) and transition metal (e.g. Co, Ni and Fe) oxides12,62,67 and (oxy)hydroxides22,27,70,116 have been studied extensively and have shown promising results. For HER, precious metal (e.g. Pt19,47,103) and transition metal based catalysts (e.g. MoS2,57,104 CoP,103etc.) have been employed. Many examples have been discussed in Section 3. Despite the critical importance of the semiconductor–catalyst junction and the large number of studies investigating the behavior, the mechanism(s) concerning how the catalysts affect the performance remains a topic of current debate. One of the complications is that different synthetic methods of a given semiconductor can influence the behavior with a given catalyst, coupled with many different semiconductor materials and catalyst compositions that have been investigated using different methods. Below we summarize selected examples and unify the interpretations to present a general picture of the semiconductor/catalyst junction.
Typically, when semiconductors are coated with catalysts, either the turn-on potential or photocurrent density or both can be improved. From a fundamental perspective, the photocurrent density can be described by the following two equations (using a photoanode as the example).117 (5.1) (5.2)
In eqn (5.1), Ps is the concentration of surface holes; P0s is the equilibrium concentration of surface holes; q is the charge of electrons; k is the Boltzmann constant; T is the temperature; Φ is the magnitude of band bending, which is determined by the combination of applied potential (Eapp), photovoltage (Vph, defined as the difference of the Fermi level under dark and light conditions) and the flat-band potential (EFB). Eqn (5.2) is derived from the Butler–Volmer equation assuming that charge transfer kinetics is dependent on the surface hole concentration. In eqn (5.2), ip is the photocurrent of holes under light; i0p is the exchange current in the dark; αp is the hole transfer coefficient; η is the overpotential to drive the water oxidation reaction.
From those two equations, it is clear that the photocurrent generated from photoanodes is determined by a convolution of thermodynamic and kinetic factors (Fig. 15). The extent of band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is determined by the band edge positions and photovoltage which controls the surface electron and hole concentrations. In addition, reduced hole/electron recombination on the surface can also increase the surface hole concentration. The photovoltage determines the position of the hole quasi-Fermi level, which must ultimately be sufficiently positive with respect to the water oxidation formal potential to drive the reaction.
 Fig. 15  The schematic shows how the hole quasi Fermi level (EF,p) affected the performance of photoelectrodes. When there are no surface states (SS) on the semiconductor/liquid interface, the overpotential is mainly the kinetic overpotential (η); when there are SS, recombination decreased the photovoltage, leading to increased overpotential (Vloss). EF,n: the electron quasi Fermi level. 
Similarly, the turn-on potential, another important parameter to describe the photoelectrode performance, is affected by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Since the photovoltage determines the position of the hole quasi-Fermi level, it also limits Von. Therefore, reducing the overpotential of the reaction can further shift the Von to its theoretical value. As a result, the “catalysts” on photoelectrodes can either serve as a true catalyst to reduce the kinetic overpotential, as conventionally defined, or tune the surface energetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, or both.
In order to understand the role of catalysts on semiconductor surfaces, various techniques have been applied, including transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS),118,119 photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS),114,120–122 intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS),68,103,114,123,124 dual-working-electrode (DWE) technique125–128 and more recently potential-sensing electrochemical atomic force microscopy (PS-EC-AFM).129 With more and more evidence being discovered, the roles of catalysts on the semiconductor surface become gradually clear. Here we reviewed thin-film semiconductor/catalyst systems studied by different techniques, and the corresponding conclusions to reveal the role of catalysts.

5.1.1 Transient absorption spectroscopy. 
Barroso et al. reported a TAS study on hematite photoanodes with different materials added to modify the surface (Fig. 16).119 In one system, CoOx was added to serve as the co-catalysts, while a Ga2O3 overlayer was added in another system, which is electrocatalytically inert. Interestingly, a negative shift of Von was observed in both cases. The TAS study under an applied bias showed that both treatments increased the absorption signals attributed to long-lived holes, and the shift of signal amplitude was consistent with the negative shift of Von observed in J–V curves (Fig. 16). From this, the authors concluded that both CoOx and Ga2O3 treatments likely passivate surface states thereby reducing electron/hole recombination and increasing the yield of long-lived holes at the electrode surface.

(b) The J–V curves of ultrathin hematite grown by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) method and hematite coated with Ga2O3 overlayers. Electrolyte: 0.1 M NaOH (pH 12.6); light source: 1 sun, AM 1.5G. The amplitude of 700 nm transient absorption measured at 50 ms after laser excitation as a function of applied bias is shown in (c and d). (a–d) Reproduced from ref. 119 with permission from the National Academy of Science. 
Similarly, Barroso et al. studied the role of Co-Pi, another widely used OER catalyst, on the surface of hematite photoanodes.118 The electrodeposited Co-Pi on mesoporous hematite thin-film photoanodes also shifted the Von to more negative values and increased the Jph at 1.4 V by 0.1 mA cm−2. The TAS results in the absence of applied bias indicated the addition of Co-Pi significantly increased the lifetime of the transient signal by more than 3 orders of magnitude, with the half-life (t1/2) increased from ∼15 μs to ∼30 ms. The authors interpreted this behavior as retarded charge recombination in hematite due to the formation of a Schottky-type heterojunction between hematite and Co-Pi.


5.1.2 Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy. 
PEIS has been widely used to measure the charge transfer processes of photoelectrodes. The key of PEIS lies in constructing meaningful equivalent circuit models that accurately describe the relevant charge-transfer processes which ultimately control the J–V behavior. The development of an appropriate equivalent circuit for photoelectrodes has been extensively investigated by Bisquert et al. during the past decade.120,130–133 By studying the PEIS results for the bare photoelectrodes and the one with catalysts on the surface, the role of catalysts can be clarified.
Klahr et al. studied hematite thin-film photoanodes grown via ALD with different thicknesses of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as an OER catalyst (Fig. 17).120 To overcome complications in interpretation due to heterogeneity of mesoporous photoelectrodes and competitive light absorption by the catalysts, light was illuminated from the back side of FTO-glass substrates. It was found that the photocurrent and turn-on potential of hematite were improved when the thickness of Co-Pi increased. After fitting analysis in the corresponding equivalent circuit for Co-Pi decorated hematite, it was found that the capacitance for Co-Pi (CCo-Pi) increased and the charge transfer resistance from the Co-Pi layer (Rct,Co-Pi) decreased as the thickness of the Co-Pi layer increased. Together with the transient photocurrent measurement and chopped light measurement, it was concluded that Co-Pi improved the performance of water oxidation by efficiently collecting and storing photogenerated holes from hematite. The increased charge separation was invoked to explain the improved performance as it led to reduced charge recombination at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.

Riha et al. studied the effect of a sub-monolayer Co(OH)2/Co3O4 catalyst on the performance of an inverse-opal scaffolded hematite photoanode.121 With deposition of only 1 ALD cycle, the sub-monolayer Co-based catalyst shifted the Von by 200 mV and increased Jph from 1.4 to 2.1 mA cm−2 at 1.53 V. By performing the PEIS measurement on the planar thin-film hematite photoanode and assuming that the charge transfer occurred through the surface states, it was found that the capacitance of surface states decreased after ALD modification when water oxidation occurred, indicating faster hole transfer resulting in lower steady-state hole concentration. In addition, the charge transfer resistance from the surface states was much lower compared with the unmodified hematite. Together, these results were interpreted as the Co-based catalyst accelerating the hole transfer kinetics, thereby acting as the water oxidation catalyst in the conventional sense.


5.1.3 Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy. 
The IMPS technique was developed by Peter et al. in the late 1980s, which measures the phase shift in photocurrent in relation to a sinusoidal modulation of light intensity.134–137 Several assumptions need to be satisfied in order to obtain meaningful IMPS data: (i) the surface hole concentration changes linearly with the light intensity; (ii) the light intensity modulation is sufficiently low so that only the surface hole concentration is altered instead of the degree of band bending; (iii) the reaction process is dominated by a single step kinetically and the surface hole concentration falls into the first-order reaction region. By analyzing the complex photocurrent as a function of light modulation frequency, the surface charge transfer rate constant (ktran) and surface charge recombination rate constant (krec) can be derived, using which the charge transfer efficiency (TE, TE = ktran/(ktran + krec)) can be obtained. The rate constants describe the charge transfer process on photoelectrode/electrolyte interface thermodynamically (krec) and kinetically (ktran).
Du et al. found that decoration of a hematite surface with NiFeOxvia a photochemical decomposition method could shift the Von negatively by 400 mV.116 Measurements of the photovoltage by comparing the open circuit potential in the dark and under illumination revealed that NiFeOx increased the photovoltage by reducing Fermi level pinning, which was caused by the hematite surface states. With the help of IMPS measurements, detailed kinetics parameters were extracted for the NiFeOx/hematite system.123 By comparing the bare hematite and the one with NiFeOx, it was found that ktran remained the same for both photoanodes at 1.1 V for water oxidation, but the one with NiFeOx showed lower krec compared with the bare one (Fig. 18a and b).123 The result indicated that NiFeOx improved the water oxidation performance by reducing the surface charge recombination.
 Fig. 18  Schematic of a bare hematite/electrolyte interface (a) and a hematite/NiFeOx/electrolyte interface (b) showing that the deposition of NiFeOx on hematite mainly decreased the krec, suppressing the charge recombination. (c and d) The schematic shows different hole transfer pathways in bare hematite (c), the one with heterogenized molecular Ir catalyst (het–WOC) (d) and the one with ItOx thin films (e). The values of ktran, krec and transfer efficiency for three hematite samples obtained from IMPS data are shown in (f–h), respectively.

Li et al. studied the effect of two different Ir-based catalysts on the performance of the hematite photoanode.114 It was found that the addition of either IrOx or a heterogenized molecular Ir catalyst on the hematite surface led to a negative shift of Von and increased Jph in 0.1 M KNO3 (pH 1.01). While IrOx was deposited on hematite as a dense thin film, the Ir molecular catalyst was anchored on the surface via direct binding with Ir centers, with the molecular identity retained (Fig. 18c–e). IMPS study revealed that compared with the bare hematite, the IrOx-decorated one showed increased ktran and decreased krec, while the one with the heterogenized molecular Ir catalyst showed only increased ktran but similar krec to the bare one (Fig. 18f–h). By increasing the loading amount of these two catalysts, it was found that only krec increased for the Ir molecular catalyst, while both ktran and krec were improved for IrOx. As a result, it was concluded that the application of the Ir molecular catalyst provided an additional hole transfer pathway while the surface recombination still occurred via surface states at the hematite/H2O interface. As a comparison, the IrOx dense thin film replaced the original hematite/H2O interface to reduce the charge recombination and increased the hole transfer at the same time.
In addition to hematite, IMPS studies have also been applied to other semiconductor/catalyst systems. For example, Zachäus et al. studied the influence of Co-Pi on the charge transfer processes on BiVO4 photoanodes.124 It was found that the performance of BiVO4 was mainly limited by the surface charge recombination instead of water oxidation kinetics. By comparing the ktran and krec of bare BiVO4 and the one with Co-Pi, it was found that the addition of Co-Pi decreased the krec by a factor of 10–20 over the entire potential range (0.6–1.5 V), while the ktran remained unchanged when the potential was less than 1 V. Furthermore, the addition of the efficient RuOx OER electrocatalyst decreased the performance because it failed to passivate the surface states on BiVO4. Moreover, Liu et al. reported that the decoration of ferrihydrite and Ni(OH)x as a “hole-storage” layer on a Ta3N5 photoanode significantly increased its performance.68 IMPS study revealed that the charge carrier lifetime was prolonged by 2 to 6 times after the hole-storage layer deposition. Meanwhile, the krec decreased dramatically while ktran was not improved, indicating that reducing surface recombination rather than enhancing surface hole transfer was the main function of such a hole-storage layer.
In addition to OER catalysts, the effect of HER catalysts on photocathodes has been studied via IMPS.103 Using a Si photocathode with GaN nanowires grown on it, different HER catalysts were deposited including Pt, Ag and cobalt phosphide (CoP). It was found that under all three cases the Von and Jph was improved and Pt was the most effective one, followed by CoP and Ag. The IMPS results revealed that adding Ag or Pt reduced krec by one order of magnitude over a wide potential window (even before Von), while adding CoP only reduced the krec after the turn-on potential. This indicated that CoP functioned as a HER catalyst quite differently from the metals on the semiconductor. For CoP, it couldn’t accept the charge from the photocathode at low applied potential, leading to severe charge recombination and limited photovoltage. On the other hand, the metals (Pt or Ag) can extract the charge through the formation of Schottky junctions and reduce charge recombination. With further enhanced charge transfer kinetics, such as with Pt, the highest performance was achieved.


5.1.4 Dual-working-electrode technique. 
In 2007 Peter employed a second evaporated Ti working electrode to sense the potential of TiO2 nanoparticles away from the conductive substrate to establish a working model of such electrodes used in dye-sensitized solar cells.138 A similar dual working electrode (DWE) technique was used by Lin et al. for dense IrOx and ion-permeable Ni(OH)x OER catalysts integrated on TiO2 photoanodes.125 By depositing a thin layer of porous Au on the surface of the catalyst, without forming direct contact with the semiconductor, they were able to simultaneously sense and control the current and potential of both the TiO2 semiconductor and the catalyst under working conditions (Fig. 19a). Unlike TA, EIS, IMPS methods which are indirect and model-dependent for result interpretation, the DWE offers a direct measure of the catalyst and the interpretation is less ambiguous.
 Fig. 19  (a) The schematic shows the DWE device configuration, in which TiO2 was the first working electrode and the porous gold layer on the catalyst was the second working electrode. The measured open-circuit potentials of the semiconductor (Vsem) and calculated open-circuit potential across the semiconductor/electrocatalyst (SC/EC) junction (Voc) as a function of applied potential on the electrocatalysts (Vcat) are shown for IrOx-coated TiO2 (b) and Ni(OH)2-coated TiO2. The inset band diagrams show how the Voc changed with Vcat in these two systems. (d and e) Illustrate the band bending schematic at the interface of hematite and NiFeOx catalysts under dark and light conditions. (f) Current densities of hematite (Jsem) when the applied potential on hematite (Vsem) was fixed at 0 V vs. E(O2/OH−) while the potential of catalysts (VWE2) was controlled in a chronoamperometry experiment. (g) Current densities measured from catalysts (JWE2) under different VWE2vs. E(O2/OH−), while Vsem was fixed at 0 V vs. E(O2/OH−). (a–c) Reproduced from ref. 125 with permission from Springer Nature.

It was found that the dense, ion-impermeable IrOx formed a Schottky-type buried junction with TiO2, leading to a constant photovoltage of only 0.2 V, which explains the relatively poor performance of this system despite IrOx as one of the best OER catalysts (Fig. 19b). However, since the Ni(OH)x catalyst is ion-permeable, it can store charge via redox reactions of the Ni ions. Since oxidation of the Ni ions lowers the catalyst potential, the photovoltage of the junction with TiO2 increases and this is therefore termed an “adaptive junction” (Fig. 19c). Since the catalyst potential was measured directly, as well as the current at the catalyst which matched the current at TiO2, it was concluded that hole transfer was efficient from TiO2 to Ni(OH)x and the OER occurred primarily via the catalyst. As a result, improved turn-on potential and fill factor were observed for the TiO2/Ni(OH)x system.
Qiu et al. later reported the application of the DWE technique on hematite photoanodes coated with a Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox catalyst where a thin layer of porous Au was deposited on the surface of Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox to form the second working electrode (Fig. 19d and e).127 It was found that the conductivity of the catalyst increased sharply after oxidation of the Ni species, no matter the catalyst was on the conductive substrate (ITO) or hematite photoanode. By monitoring the photocurrent of hematite and the current of the catalyst at the same time over a wide range of applied biases, it was found that hole transfer from hematite to the catalyst occurs with an efficiency of up to 95% (Fig. 19f and g). This result indicates that the Ni0.8Fe0.2Ox not only serves as a hole-collecting contact but also as the catalyst to drive water oxidation. In addition, the authors found that the heterogeneity of the catalyst could affect the hole collection from the semiconductor to the catalyst, which may explain the difference between various reported results for the role of catalysts.
Qiu et al. later reported the effect of semiconductor morphology and catalyst conductivity on the photoelectrode performance via the DWE technique.128 Two types of hematite with different morphologies and two types of NiFeOxHy with different conductivities (as well as OER activity) were combined to illustrate the effect. Electrodeposited (ED) hematite on FTO substrates featured a porous morphology while the ALD electrode forms a compact, dense thin film. Ni0.8Fe0.2OxHy has better conductivity and OER activity compared with Ni0.2Fe0.8OxHy. However, the Ni0.2Fe0.8OxHy decorated ED hematite showed much worse performance than the one with Ni0.8Fe0.2OxHy, while the ALD hematite showed good performance after the deposition of both catalysts. By measuring the potential of the catalyst as a function of semiconductor potential, it was found that charge recombination due to the direct contact between the conductive catalyst and FTO substrate occurred which inhibited the performance. To avoid this shunting, photo-assisted electrodeposition of the catalyst on ED hematite was carried out to avoid the direct contact between FTO and catalyst, which showed much better performance compared with the one deposited via photochemical decomposition. The study pointed out the importance of avoiding shunting using porous semiconductors with catalysts, which could be achieved by the photo-assisted electrodeposition method, or preventing the direct contact between the catalyst and conductive substrate by inserting an insulating layer or electronically insulating the catalyst between them.


5.1.5 Potential-sensing electrochemical atomic force microscopy. 
Although the DWE technique can reveal the electrochemical information of catalyst layers during the reaction, its application is generally limited to planar photoelectrodes. High-aspect-ratio substrates can lead to the non-uniform coverage of the second working electrode layer, resulting in direct electrical shorting to the semiconductor. To overcome this problem, Nellist et al. developed a method to use an electrochemical AFM to sense the local potential of catalysts on different morphologies of photoanodes.129 In this configuration, an electrically insulated AFM cantilever was modified with a conductive nanotip of Pt. As a result, the tip–substrate interaction could be controlled by force feedback through cantilever deflection, so that the potential of the substrate (the catalyst layer) could be detected without damaging the catalyst layer (Fig. 20a).
 Fig. 20  (a) The schematic shows the electrochemical AFM set-up to measure the catalyst potential during (photo)electrochemical water oxidation. The inset is a TEM image of the AFM tip. The band diagram shows the equilibrium of tip potential (Etip) with the catalyst potential (Ecat) during the PEC measurement. (b) The J–V curve of the Co-Pi coated ITO electrode in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and the corresponding tip potentials. (c) The J–V curve of the Co-Pi coated planar hematite photoelectrode in the same electrolyte and the corresponding tip potentials. Light source: 405 nm light with 27 mW cm−2. A clear switching of tip potential is observed in both (b) and (c). (a–c) Reproduced from ref. 129 with permission from Springer Nature. 
The PS-EC-AFM was used to study the effect of Co-Pi on both planar and nanostructured hematite photoanodes. The tip potential didn’t track the increase of substrate potential until the Co2+ ions were oxidized and the catalyst layer became conductive (Fig. 20c). It was observed that similar tip potentials were achieved for both Co-Pi coated ITO substrate in the dark and Co-Pi coated hematite photoanode under light when the current density was the same, indicating that the photogenerated holes were transferred from hematite to the Co-Pi layer to drive the water oxidation reaction (Fig. 20b). Study for other semiconductor/catalyst systems based on this technique can be promising to further reveal the role of catalysts on semiconductors.

5.2 The effect of catalysts on the light absorption
The loading amount of catalysts has a great impact on the water oxidation/reduction performance. In order to achieve the optimized performance, the catalyst loading is considerably high, which introduced another problem in photoelectrodes. That is, the usually opaque electrocatalysts compete with the underneath semiconductors in terms of light absorption. To avoid this competition, mainly two strategies have been employed in the literature: (i) decoupling the reaction sites with light absorption sites; (ii) synthesis of catalysts with high intrinsic activity to reduce the loading amount, which will be transparent for the incident light.

5.2.1 Decoupling reaction sites and light absorption sites. 
The most convenient method to overcome competitive light absorption by the catalyst layer is to illuminate the photoelectrode from the back side (the ohmic contact side) instead of front side (the catalyst side). Such a method requires the deposition of semiconductor thin films on the transparent and conductive substrate, such as the conductive oxide coated glass (e.g., FTO and ITO). In addition, the thickness of semiconductors needs to be controlled so that the photo-generated carriers can reach the surface before recombination. For example, Du et al. synthesized an amorphous NiFeOx layer on the surface of ALD grown hematite (25 nm) via a photochemical decomposition method.116 Due to the brown color of NiFeOx, it competed with the light absorption of hematite. With illumination from the back side of the photoelectrode, the Jph at 1.23 V was enhanced by almost 70%. Similarly, Klahr et al. reported a Co-Pi decorated hematite thin film photoanode.120 Since Co-Pi broadly absorbed visible light, back illumination was used so that the performance of hematite could be optimized by controlling the thickness of Co-Pi thin films.
Another method to achieve this goal is to selectively deposit the catalyst instead of a uniform deposition on the surface of photoelectrodes so that only a small portion of incident light will be blocked by the catalysts even under the front illumination. Such a strategy often requires the synthesis of high-aspect-ratio semiconductors. For example, Shaner et al. reported a Si microwire design consisting of Si microwire arrays with the height of 100 μm, 5–10 μm of Ni–Mo HER catalyst on the bottom of the microwire, with additional 1–3 μm of light-scattering TiO2 particles.139 The light absorption was enabled by the exposed Si microwires, while the photo-generated carriers were transferred to the Ni–Mo HER catalyst on the bottom of microwires. The addition of TiO2 further enhanced the light absorption by light-scattering. In addition, Vijselaar et al. reported the selective deposition of Ni–Mo HER catalysts on the top of Si microwires.140 The Si surface was first conformally covered with SiO2, followed by addition of a photoresist layer, which was etched in O2 plasma to expose the top of wires. Then the exposed SiO2 was etched away so that only the top of Si could be electrodeposited with the Ni–Mo HER catalyst (Fig. 21a and b). Through selective deposition, it was found that the light absorption by Ni–Mo was inhibited compared with the one with the fully exposed Si surface after the same catalyst deposition time. As a result, the Jph was improved by over 6 times.
 Fig. 21  (a) The schematic shows the fabrication process for three types of Si microwires: fully exposed (A), with top exposed (B) and with defined exposed areas (C). (b) The SEM image of Si microwires with Ni–Mo HER catalysts deposited on the top. Scale bar: 10 μm. (c) The schematic shows the synthesis process for side-on (A, on α-Fe2O3) and end-on (B, on WO3) bound Ir DHCs, which involves the adsorption of molecular dinuclear precursors and the removal of organic ligands by photochemical processes.

In addition, the decoupling of light absorption with photocatalytic activity can be achieved by changing the assembly method of semiconductors. For example, Kang et al. reported epitaxial lift-off and printing-based assemblies to prepare the GaAs-based photocathode.11 After removing it from the growth substrate of GaAs wafers, the photocathode was sealed into a transparent, photocurable polymer, which was further assembled onto a glass substrate. As a result, the back ohmic contact layer was facing the electrolyte side, with the Pt HER catalysts on it (Fig. 14b). In this bifacial configuration, the light penetrated from the glass side while the electrons were collected on the back side of the electrolyte.


5.2.2 Synthesis of transparent catalysts. 
There are limitations of using geometrical approaches to reduce the effect of light absorption by catalysts. For example, in conventional tandem cell configurations, it is critical to allow the light absorption by the smaller band gap photo absorber underneath the top absorber. Thus, light must pass through the top catalyst layer before reaching the bottom cell. Therefore, a more ideal approach is to synthesize a transparent catalyst layer with high activity.
For instance, Morales-Guio et al. reported the synthesis of semi-transparent FeNiOx catalysts on hematite photoanodes via photo-assisted electrodeposition.49 It was found that the oxidative deposition of NiOx at pH 5.3 was much slower due to faster corrosion of NiOx films, with Fe incorporation further accelerating the corrosion process. As a result, the loading amount of FeNiOx was low (4–7 nm in thickness), leading to low light absorption by the catalyst layer. In addition, the as-deposited FeNiOx featured a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.1 s−1 with an overpotential of 0.35 V, which was almost 10 times that for NiOx at a similar loading amount. The FeNiOx decorated hematite achieved higher Jph and better Von compared with the bare or NiOx-decorated hematite.
Another approach that has also been reported recently is to reduce the size of the catalyst to the atomic scale, which can result in improved intrinsic activity of the catalyst with high atomic efficiency and negligible light absorption. Zhao et al. recently reported the synthesis of single-atom catalysts (SACs) and dinuclear heterogeneous catalysts (DHCs) of Ir on hematite photoanodes (Fig. 21d–j).53 The DHCs were synthesized via the photochemical decomposition of the organic ligands in Ir homodimers, consisting of two Ir atoms per catalytic site in the form of Ir–O–Ir arrangement. The Ir DHC decorated hematite showed the best Von (0.55 V) and highest Jph compared with Ir SACs and Ir nanoparticles in a pH 6 electrolyte. The measured TOF for Ir DHCs is 2.6 and 5 times higher than those for the corresponding Ir SACs and nanoparticles. DFT calculation indicated that the energy required after the second proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process was much lower in DHCs compared with the Ir SACs. Similarly, DHCs of Ir was synthesized on a WO3 photoanode, but with a different bonding configuration compared with the one on α-Fe2O3 surfaces.115 It was found that only one Ir atom was anchored on the WO3 surface with the second Ir atom on top of the first Ir (end on bonding), while two Ir atoms were anchored on the α-Fe2O3 surfaces (Fig. 21c). The difference comes from the density and distance of binding sites on different surfaces. In addition, the WO3 photoanode coated with DHCs of Ir showed higher product selectivity for O2 instead of peroxide species compared with bare WO3 and the one coated with SACs of Ir, which was explained as a more favorable water oxidation pathway having a second Ir site.
In addition to OER catalysts, synthesis of semi-transparent HER catalysts has also been explored. For instance, Roger et al. reported a hydrothermal synthesis method to deposit Co2Mo9S26 thin films on FTO-coated glass from an aqueous solution of cobalt sulfate, ammonia heptamolybdate and thiourea at 180 °C for 72 hours.141 With a thickness of 300 nm, such a thin film showed a translucent nature, but it still delivered current densities of 10 mA cm−2 at 260 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4. Furthermore, Ding et al. deposited amorphous MoSxCly catalysts on n+pp+-Si micropyramid photocathodes through a low temperature CVD method.142 With a thickness between 40 and 60 nm, the MoSxCly catalysts showed little light absorption in the 500 to 1200 nm wavelength region where Si absorbs strongly. As a result, the integrated photocathode showed Von of 0.41 V and Jph of 43.0 mA cm−2 at 0 V in 0.5 M H2SO4.

6 Applications
6.1 Study platform for fundamental properties of semiconductors and chemical reactions
Water oxidation mechanisms have been studied extensively on different materials. However, it still remains a question that whether the current knowledge, which is usually studied in homogeneous molecular catalysts, is transferrable to other water oxidation systems such as the heterogeneous systems. Photoelectrodes provide a unique study platform for the water oxidation mechanism by constructing a semiconductor/liquid interface, with illumination and applied bias to control the hole concentrations on the surface. Indeed, mechanistic studies on photoelectrodes recently have shown promising results to identify the water oxidation intermediates and pathways. The results can not only increase the understanding of water oxidation pathways, but also shed light on the future optimization of PEC devices. In those studies, the thin film photoelectrodes played an important role, which enabled the application of various techniques. Here we use hematite thin-film photoanodes as the example system for understanding water oxidation mechanisms on thin film photoelectrodes.
For instance, Klahr et al. studied the photoelectrochemical properties of thin-film hematite for water oxidation by impedance spectroscopy.132 The equivalent circuit analysis of impedance results showed a correlation between the appearance of peak for surface state capacitance (Ctrap) with the valley of charge transfer resistance from surface states (Rct,trap) and the turn-on potential of hematite for water oxidation. This leads to a proposed mechanism where the transfer of photogenerated holes took place from the surface states on the hematite/electrolyte interface instead of a direct transfer of holes from the valence band of hematite. Such a correlation could be explained as the photogenerated valence band holes oxidizing surface bound hydroxide to form a water oxidation intermediate species; formation of the intermediate presents itself as storing a hole in a surface state. The intermediate species builds up during the reaction suggesting that the subsequent steps in the overall water oxidation are rate limiting.
Le Formal et al. reported the rate law analysis of the order of water oxidation as a function of surface hole density on a hematite photoanode by photo-induced absorption spectroscopy.143 It was found that under low light intensity (low surface hole concentration) the reaction order was close to 1, while under high light intensity (one sun, high surface hole concentration) the reaction order was close to 3, which corresponded to water oxidation to oxygen. The result provided convincing evidence that surface hole accumulation was required in the four electron water oxidation reaction. This study indicated the possibility of a concerted multi-hole water oxidation reaction on the hematite surface.
In addition, Zhang et al. studied the role of proton transfer during water oxidation on a hematite photoanode.144 By comparing the photocurrent and turn-on potential of hematite in electrolytes with different pH values, it was found that the water molecule is the dominant reaction species for oxidation at low pH (<12) and high potentials (1.2 V), corresponding to a large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) when the hematite was tested in H2O and D2O electrolytes. This result indicates that the cleavage of the O–H bonds of the water molecule was involved in the rate determining step (RDS) of water oxidation, which was a concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) pathway. At higher pH or at low potential, much lower KIE values were observed, indicating that the electron transfer was the dominant pathway. The results indicated that the performance of hematite was limited kinetically by the proton transfer under near-neutral conditions.
More recently, the chemical nature of water oxidation intermediates on hematite surfaces has been revealed by operando attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), which provides direct evidence for the proposed water oxidation mechanism (Fig. 22a and b). Zandi et al. reported a potential- and light-dependent absorption peak at 898 cm−1 on the hematite surface during the water oxidation reaction (Fig. 22c and d).145 The peak intensity increased with the increased applied potential and light illumination, indicating that it corresponded to a water oxidation intermediate on the hematite surface. Through isotope labelling, the chemical nature of this peak was assigned to iron–oxo (FeIVO) groups. A water oxidation mechanism was proposed according to which FeIVO was formed after the first oxidation reaction of FeIII–OH on the hematite surface by valence-band holes.

Zhang et al. reported the detection of water oxidation intermediates by operando infrared spectroscopy in the electrolyte with different pH values.146 Impedance spectroscopy revealed a first-order dependence of photocurrent with the density of surface trapped holes under near-neutral (pH 10), while a third-order dependence was found at high pH (13.6). Furthermore, operando PEC ATR-IR measurements showed a peak evolution at 1100 cm−1 with pH ranging from 8 to 10 under water oxidation conditions (Fig. 22e). Isotope labelling identified the peak assignment to a surface superoxide species that hydrogen bonded to an adjacent hydroxyl group. No peroxide or superoxide species were detected on the surface under water oxidation conditions when the electrolyte pH was higher than 11 (Fig. 22f). The combination of rate law analysis and ATR-IR results indicated a water oxidation mechanism change from near-neutral pH to highly alkaline conditions. Under near-neutral pH, nucleophilic attack of water/OH− onto a metal–oxo species was proposed, while the coupling of neighboring metal–oxo species was proposed under alkaline conditions.
6.2 Constructing the tandem cell configuration
The unique properties of thin-film photoelectrode make the tandem cell configuration possible, moving the field forward to more practical water splitting devices. Among the configurations, thin-film metal oxide photoanodes deposited on transparent substrates (e.g., FTO glass) have been used to couple with smaller band-gap photocathodes or photovoltaics to construct the tandem cell PEC devices. Promising solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies (ηSTH) have been achieved for various materials combinations, and the value has improved gradually due to more optimized photoelectrode component performances and cell designs. On the other hand, the high-efficiency III–V semiconductors have been optimized for integration, which further boosted the ηSTH.
Brillet et al. reported a thin-film hematite or WO3 photoanode stacked on a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC).147 Light was incident on the photoanode before the underlying photovoltaic cell. Under one sun illumination, effective photocurrent densities of 0.95 mA cm−2 and 2.52 mA cm−2 were obtained from the hematite/DSSC and WO3/DSSC devices, corresponding to a ηSTH of 1.17% and 3.1%. Performance remained at 80% of the original value after 8 hours of testing, which was mainly attributed to the instability of the DSSC.
Jang et al. reported the combination of a hematite photoanode with an amorphous Si photocathode to form a tandem device.22 Through the re-growth synthesis method and addition of a NiFeOx catalyst on hematite, a low Von of 0.45 V was achieved for the hematite photoanode. Together with the amorphous Si photocathode which was decorated with TiO2/Pt, a ηSTH of 0.91% was achieved in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 11.8) for 10 hours. In addition, by replacing the NiFeOx with an acid-stable IrOx OER catalyst, the unassisted water splitting by hematite and amorphous Si was achieved in 0.1 M KNO3 (pH 1.01), with a ηSTH of 0.44%.52
Morales-Guio et al. reported the coupling of a hematite photoanode and a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell.49 The light was illuminated from the hematite side, and due to the deposition of an optically transparent FeNiOx catalyst on the hematite surface, the parasitic light absorption by the catalyst was largely avoided. After connecting the integrated photoelectrodes with a Ni–Mo cathode, a photocurrent density of 1.54 mA cm−2 was achieved, corresponding to a ηSTH of 1.9%. The tandem cell maintained 70% of the original performance after 8 hours of testing, which was due to filtering of the solution through the encapsulating layer with time, leading to the quick dissolution of the perovskite cell.
In addition to hematite and WO3, the application of BiVO4 photoanodes in tandem devices can significantly improve the efficiency due to its early turn-on potential for water oxidation. Abdi et al. reported a tandem cell device combining a BiVO4 photoanode and a double- or single-junction amorphous Si solar cell.43 The performance of BiVO4 was optimized through a gradient W doping to enhance the band bending and deposition of a Co-Pi catalyst to improve the water oxidation activity. After coupling with a double-junction amorphous solar cell, Jph of 4 mA cm−2 was achieved for unassisted solar water splitting by shining light from the BiVO4 side to the Si, corresponding to a ηSTH of 4.9%. Stable production of H2 and O2 was achieved for 1 hour without performance degradation in a pH 7 phosphate buffer.
Shi et al. reported the application of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) layer to improve the performance of a tandem cell device consisting of a BiVO4/WO3 photoanode and a DSSC (Fig. 23a and b).83 The DBR layer was placed on the back side of FTO glass for the BiVO4/WO3 photoanode and served as the conductive counter electrode for the DSSC. The DBR layer consisting of multiple layers of materials with high- and low-refractive indices can reflect the short-wavelength photons (λ < 500 nm) while being transparent for the long-wavelength photons, leading to the recycling of the short-wavelength photons in the BiVO4 photoanode. A ηSTH of 7.1% was achieved, corresponding to a Jph of 5.75 mA cm−2, which was 1.1 mA cm−2 higher than the one without DBR layers.

Kim et al. reported a “hetero-type dual photoelectrode (HDP)” as the photoanode in the tandem device.148 By placing the hematite photoanode on the back of the BiVO4 photoanode along the incident light direction, better utilization of the solar spectrum was achieved compared with the case with either BiVO4 or hematite alone. The photocurrent density of the HDP achieved 7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V in 0.1 M KHCO3 with pH 9.2, which was higher than those of BiVO4 (5 mA cm−2) and Fe2O3 (4 mA cm−2) at the same applied potential. Combined with two series-connected crystalline Si solar cells, a ηSTH of 7.7% was achieved.
Compared with the tandem cell device based on metal oxide photoanodes, the monolithically integrated devices based on III–V semiconductors have shown higher ηSTH.
For example, Verlage et al. reported a monolithically integrated device based on an InGaP top cell (Eg = 1.84 eV) and a GaAs bottom cell (Eg = 1.42 eV), which were electrically connected via a tunnel junction in between.54 The integrated photoanode was protected by an amorphous TiO2 layer and sputtered Ni as the OER catalyst. After the photoanode was connected to a Ni–Mo cathode, unassisted water splitting was achieved under one sun illumination in 1 M KOH electrolyte with a Jph of 8.5 mA cm−2, corresponding to a ηSTH of 10.5%. Although the performance gradually decayed after 80 hours of operation, the device maintained ηSTH > 10% for the initial 40 hours of test. Furthermore, it can be integrated into a wireless device to achieve a ηSTH of 8.6%.
Young et al. reported a detailed design of III–V semiconductor top cell and bottom cell in a tandem device to optimize the efficiency (Fig. 23c–e).55 In order to further improve the ηSTH of the III–V tandem device (theoretical maximum ηSTH of 15% for GaInP/GaAs tandem with 1.8/1.4 eV band gaps), a GaInP/GaInAs tandem cell with 1.8/1.2 eV band gaps and an AlGaAs/GaInAs tandem cell with 1.7/1.2 eV band gaps can achieve theoretical maximum ηSTH of 24% and 21%. The long-term pursuit of an ideal device with 1.7/1.05 eV band gaps can achieve theoretical maximum ηSTH of 27%. Based on this, the most critical challenge is to synthesize high-quality III–V semiconductors with tunable band gaps. The author used a compositionally graded buffer (CGB) layer to allow the bandgap combinations that are not constrained by the lattice constant of growth substrates. In addition, the inverted metamorphic growth technique was applied to first grow the top cell with a wider band gap, which improved the quality of top cells to provide sufficient photovoltage. Furthermore, a thin layer (25 nm) of n-GaInP was deposited on the surface of the p-InGaP top cell to form a buried p–n junction, enhancing the charge separation. Another thin layer (20 nm) of n-AlInP was deposited to block the hole transfer and a 10 nm n-GaInP layer was used to protect the unstable n-AlInP from the aqueous electrolyte. With PtRu as the HER catalyst, the integrated tandem cell with a thickness of the effective material of less than 5 μm, achieved a ηSTH of 16.2% under AM 1.5G light illumination. The limitation of this tandem cell was the long-term stability, in which 85% of initial performance was maintained after 1 hour's test.
7 Conclusion
Storing solar energy to overcome the intermittent nature of this abundant resource is of paramount importance to a future society that is primarily powered by renewable sources. PEC water splitting provides a promising route to solving this problem, but the solar hydrogen production technology, using PEC or other methods, is still far from being ready for commercialization. The critical issue lies in the development of photoelectrodes for harvesting solar energy and carrying out the desired chemical reactions efficiently and stably. Among them, thin-film photoelectrodes are unique thanks to features such as serving as a good model platform for a fundamental understanding of important processes and the rich knowledge of thin-film materials. In this review, we summarized the strategies developed for thin-film materials with the purpose of overcoming challenges for efficient and inexpensive solar fuel synthesis.
A variety of synthetic methods have been applied to produce thin-film components of photoelectrodes including semiconductors, protection layers and catalysts. Those approaches can be categorized into physical vapor depositions, chemical depositions and (photo)electrochemical depositions, with corresponding advantages and caveats for each of them. How to balance the cost and material qualities would be a critical criterion to consider in choosing the suitable synthesis methods.
As the key component in thin-film photoelectrodes, light absorbers have been explored using various semiconductors with different compositions, structures and morphologies. However, it is extremely difficult to find a single material that can meet all the needs. Common issues that limit the performance of a given material include light absorption, bulk/surface recombination, mismatch of energetics, instabilities and other issues such as fabrication cost. Representative strategies to address those issues on prototypical materials are summarized. (1) To address the light absorption problems, two common strategies are usually applied, either to narrow down the band gaps by tuning the compositions, or to reduce the optical loss due to reflection. (2) To reduce the bulk recombination, nanostructuring is usually applied to overcome the short diffusion lengths, and doping is applied to decrease the minority carrier concentrations and improve the transport of the majority carriers. (3) The charge recombination on the surface can be addressed by depositing passivation layers or changing the crystal structures at the surface. (4) To deal with the mismatch of energetics, buried junctions can be constructed or the band edge positions can be tuned, resulting in larger photovoltage extractions. (5) The instability issue needs to be considered from its origin, including the accumulation of by-products, the deactivation due to loss of photovoltage and corrosion. Different protection strategies corresponding to the origin of instabilities need to be applied. Among them, the deposition of thin-film protection layers is the most widely used one, divided into physical barrier protection layers and kinetic protection layers.
Thin-film catalysts have been widely used to improve the performance of photoelectrodes. For better design and development of catalysts, a better understanding of their roles is critical but still missing. From a fundamental perspective, the catalysts should help enhance the performance by either reducing the kinetic overpotentials or tuning the surface energetics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces or both. A number of techniques have been developed that can be used to discern the various roles, including transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), dual-working-electrode (DWE) technique and potential-sensing electrochemical atomic force microscopy (PS-EC-AFM). In addition, to deal with the effect of catalysts on light absorption, two common strategies have been applied: (1) decoupling reaction sites and light absorption sites; (2) synthesis of transparent catalysts.
The applications of thin-film photoelectrodes have been divided into two aspects. On the one hand, they can serve as study platforms for fundamental properties of semiconductors and chemical reactions. To this end, thin-film hematite photoanodes are a good example for the understanding of water oxidation mechanisms. On the other hand, prototypes of unassisted water splitting devices have been constructed based on thin-film photoelectrodes of different materials with promising solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies.
We envision that further development of research on solar fuel synthesis will continue to demand and benefit from detailed understanding of the photoelectrode materials. New device engineering on using PEC for practical solar fuel synthesis will likely be needed, as well. Both aspects will require studies on model material systems that are thin-films in form factors. Such efforts will progress hand in hand with efforts aimed at understanding catalysis, as well as new concepts of creative light utilization. Together, these efforts will see a convergence, where practical solutions to the grand challenge of artificial photosynthesis become possible.
