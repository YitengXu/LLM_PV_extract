    , Accepted 17th June 2019First published on 17th June 2019AbstractPhotocapacitors have emerged as promising self-sufficient energy devices that combine solar cells and supercapacitors for simultaneous energy conversion and storage. Despite significant improvements in their performance during the past few years, fabricating photocapacitors with high open-circuit voltage and energy density remains challenging. Herein, with the aid of a carbon-supported graphene/PEDOT common electrode and an ionic liquid electrolyte, we have successfully developed a photocapacitor that can deliver an unprecedented open-circuit voltage of up to 1.8 V (4.7 V for an array of three photocapacitors in series) and an outstanding energy density of 0.18 W h m−2, together with a high overall efficiency of 7.0%. The device also shows good stability and performance under intermittent or low intensity light illumination.
Introduction
With the rapid growth of portable and wearable electronic devices, there is an increasing demand for self-charging, off-grid power systems to drive them. For this purpose, integrating photovoltaic (PV) cells and supercapacitors (SCs) to form self-charging power packs has attracted more and more interest in recent years.1 SCs store the photo-converted electrical energy and mitigate unstable PV outputs induced by fluctuating light densities and diurnal cycles.2–5 Miyasaka and Murakami first proposed the concept of photocapacitors in 2004 to simplify charge transport and storage processes,6 and early attempts to improve photocapacitors were focused on using dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic PV cells to generate electrical energy.3,7–10 For instance, Zhang et al.9 combined organic PV cells with SCs to develop all-solid-state and flexible energy storing fibers. These fibers showed an overall photo-electrochemical-electricity energy conversion efficiency (ηoverall) of 0.82% and could be potentially scaled up for practical applications. Flexible printable photocapacitors composed of DSSCs and SCs showed very stable performance under various mechanical loading conditions in outdoor testing.10 However, the ηoverall of these systems was relatively low, partly due to the low efficiency of solar cells and energy loss caused by unoptimized device configurations. In comparison, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are better candidates in photocapacitors owing to their higher photoelectric conversion efficiency associated with the unique optoelectronic properties of perovskites, including strong adsorption in the visible light range, high carrier mobility, bipolar transport and a long photogenerated carrier diffusion length.11 Xu et al.12 and Gong et al.13 combined PSCs and SCs through external electrical interconnections or a power management circuit, achieving a high output voltage of 1.45 V. Xu et al. directly employed four PSCs connected in series to photo-charge lithium ion batteries and obtained a high ηoverall (7.8%) with excellent cycling stability (17.8 h under continuous illumination).2 Unfortunately, external wires were routinely used to link two separate moieties of energy generation and storage devices, leading to unnecessary ohmic loss. To address this issue, carbon nanotubes,14,15 conductive glue,16 and nanocarbon-based materials17,18 were employed as the common electrode to connect the photovoltaic unit and SC unit in the photocapacitor, greatly improving ηoverall to values as high as 7.1%.19 Despite these significant progresses, photocapacitors are still limited by their relatively low operating voltage (generally less than 1 V) and energy density, demanding further optimization of electrode materials as well as device designs.
Graphene (GR) has been considered as an ideal electrode material in energy-related devices due to its high specific surface area and remarkable electrical conductivity.20–22 In particular, coupling GR with pseudocapacitive materials could significantly improve the capacitance and energy density of SCs.23,24 Among all pseudocapacitive materials, conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (denoted as PEDOT), and polypyrrole have shown advantages of high conductivity and stability and excellent redox pseudocapacitive charge storage in SCs.25 In the current work, we have designed carbon-supported GR/PEDOT (CGP) films as common electrodes in the photocapacitor and selected an ionic liquid electrolyte to widen the potential window of the SC component for a higher operating voltage and energy density.26 As a result, our photocapacitor with an ionic liquid electrolyte showed an unprecedented photovoltage of 1.8 V (4.7 V for an array of 3 devices in series), delivering an outstanding energy density of 0.18 W h m−2 and ηoverall of 7.0%. Meanwhile, the photocapacitor delivered a stable and continuous power supply under different scenarios such as fluctuating sunlight, low-intensity illumination and even complete darkness, thus setting a new benchmark for developing high-performance photocapacitors with a high photocharging voltage and energy density.
Materials and methods
Materials
Carbon paste was purchased from Jujo Chemical Co., Ltd. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-205), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), lithium chloride (LiCl), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and aniline were purchased from Aladdin. Fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO glass, sheet resistance of 17 Ω sq−1) was purchased from Advanced Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Ether was purchased from Beijing Tongguang Fine Chemical Company. All reagents were used without further purification.
Preparation of GR-PEDOT and GR-PANI
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized according to a modified Hummers method27 and the GR foam was then prepared by hydrothermal treatment (150 °C, 12 h) of the GO solution (5 mg mL−1). GR-PEDOT and GR-PANI composites were electrochemically synthesized by using the GR foam as the working electrode to polymerize EDOT or aniline monomers. In a typical procedure, 0.216 g LiClO4 and 212 μL EDOT were added into 20 mL H2O and the mixture was then sonicated for 10 min to form a homogeneous emulsion. Subsequently, this emulsion was used as the electrolyte for electrodepositing PEDOT on the GR foam working electrode by applying a constant potential of 0.8 V for 4800 s via a conventional three-electrode setup, where a Pt film and Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The GR-PANI was prepared with the same experimental setup, except that the electrolyte contained 0.2 M aniline and 0.5 M HCl.
Preparation of CGP film and carbon film/GR-PANI
To improve the conductivity and mechanical strength of GR-PEDOT and GR-PANI materials, they were further coupled with a carbon film support to yield CGP and carbon film/GR-PANI. Briefly, commercial carbon paste was directly doctor-bladed on a glass substrate and soaked in ethanol to remove solvent residues by a solvent-exchange process to form a carbon film. Subsequently, GR-PEDOT and GR-PANI foams were pressed on the obtained carbon film under a pressure of 20 MPa and then dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h to yield the CGP film and carbon film/GR-PANI. A detailed flow chart for preparing the CGP film is depicted in Fig. S1.†
Preparation of electrolytes for SCs
Two electrolytes were used in fabricating the photocapacitor. For the PVA/LiCl hydrogel electrolyte, 6 g LiCl and 6 g PVA powder were added into 60 mL of DI water under intense stirring and the mixture was heated at 80 °C under stirring until it became clear. The ionic liquid electrolyte was prepared by adding 0.5 g PVDF into 1.5 mL of a 0.5 M acetonitrile solution of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4).
Device fabrication
FTO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonication processes in detergent, DI water and alcohol before being dried with argon. Then the clean FTO glass was treated with air-plasma for 3 min. A SnO2 blocking layer was prepared by first spin-coating a colloidal dispersion of SnO2 (2.67 wt%) at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealing it at 150 °C for 30 min. Subsequent deposition of lead perovskite was achieved by spin-coating a DMF solution of PbI2 (0.1 M) and MAI (0.1 M) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The hole transporting layer was then spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s using a solution containing 60 mg Spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt solution (260 mg mL−1), and 35 μL of 260 mg mL−1 4-tert-butylpyridine in chlorobenzene. After the above PSC moiety was aged in an air glove box for 24 h a CGP film was further pressed on top of it (under a pressure of 0.7 MPa) as the common electrode (i.e. the counter electrode of the PSC as well as the working electrode of the SC moiety). Eventually, the aqueous PVA/LiCl electrolyte or the EMIBF4-based ionic electrolyte was dispersed on top of the common electrode before a second CGP film was inserted as the counter electrode of the SC moiety.
Characterization and measurement
The morphology and structure of the PSC were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7500F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by using a Netherlands 1710 diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å). Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) tests were conducted using a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (model XP150) from Sanyounic Technology Co., Ltd. under standard AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements and cycling performance of SCs were obtained using a CHI 660D work station with automatic data acquisition. The areal capacitance (CA) values of the SCs and the photocapacitors were calculated using the following expression: CA = i/[(−dV/dt) × ASC](1)where i, dV/dt and ASC are the discharge current, the slope of the discharge curve and the area (0.08 cm2) of the SC unit, respectively.
The areal energy density (EA) of the photocapacitor was calculated using EA = 0.5 × CA × (ΔV)2(2)where ΔV is the operating voltage window.
The ηoverall was calculated using ηoverall = EA × ASC/(Pin × tc × APSC)(3)where APSC is the effective area of the PSC unit and Pin and tc are the light power density (100 mW cm−2) and photo-charging time of the photocapacitor.
The electrochemical energy storage efficiency, ηstorage, of the SC unit was calculated using ηstorage = ηoverall/PCE(4)where PCE is the efficiency of the PSC.
Results and discussion
To combine photoelectric conversion and energy storage, a PSC was integrated with a symmetrical SC based on CGP films to form a photocapacitor. Herein, the SC, PSC and load were connected during the charging and discharging process (Fig. 1a). During the photo-charge process, the photo-charge part converts light energy into electrical energy using the PSC and stores the energy in the SC. During the discharge process, the SC can provide energy to the load in a dark environment. Fig. 1b shows the schematic structure of the photocapacitor where a CGP layer worked as the common electrode between the PSC and the SC, with A and B being the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. Fig. 1c shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the whole photocapacitor, clearly showing the distinct layered structure of the SC part, while the inset shows the magnified view of the PSC part. The thicknesses of SnO2, perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3), Spiro-OMeTAD, CGP and electrolyte/spacer layers were approximately 550 nm, 2 μm, 1.4 μm, 255 μm and 363 μm, respectively. Due to the flexibility of the CGP film and its compatibility with Spiro-OMeTAD, the CGP/Spiro-OMeTAD interface was smooth and free of notable voids. Meanwhile, the perovskite layer was dense and uniform, and the large grain size implied low intensity of surface traps (Fig. 1d).28–30 The formation of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1e, strong diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 14.01°, 19.94°, 23.44°, 24.46°, 28.38°, 31.8°, 40.46°, and 43.06° originated from diffractions between (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (224), and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure.31,32 As shown in Fig. S2,† the compact carbon film substrate greatly improved the mechanical properties of the CGP film over that of the loosely packed GR-PEDOT film, further preventing water penetration into the PSC when it was used as the common electrode. The J–V curve of the PSC under standard AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 is presented in Fig. 1f. The device exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.32 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.56, leading to a photo-to-electric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.65%. After two days of exposure to air, it almost maintained the same photovoltaic performance (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). With a longer exposure time of 8 days, the PCE and FF dropped to 7.73% and 0.42, respectively, possibly due to the slight degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 by moisture in air.

The electrochemical performance of the SC moiety was first tested with the aqueous PVA/LiCl electrolyte. Fig. 2a shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of symmetrical SCs prepared with carbon film/GR, carbon film/GR-PANI and CGP electrodes, respectively. The carbon film/GR SC showed a relatively small areal capacitance (162 mF cm−2), and the carbon film/GR-PANI SC exhibited a higher areal capacitance of 218 mF cm−2 due to pseudocapacitive charge storage of PANI. Impressively, the CGP-based SC showed the highest areal capacitance of 375 mF cm−2 and the CGP was thus selected as the common electrode in the following study. Fig. 2b shows cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CGP-based SC at different scan rates (from 0.02 to 0.1 V s−1). The rectangular shape for various scan rates indicated its high electrochemical stability and capacitive behavior. Fig. 2c shows GCD curves at various current densities (from 1.0 to 4.0 mA cm−2). The typical symmetrical triangular curve with little voltage drop confirmed the good capacitive performance of the SC. The areal capacitance versus discharge current density was plotted in Fig. S4a.† The areal capacitance of the SC changed slightly from 388 to 290 mF cm−2 as the current density increased from 1.0 to 4.0 mA cm−2, higher than those reported in similar SCs.33–37Fig. 2d displays the photo-charge/discharge performance of the photocapacitor with the PVA/LiCl aqueous electrolyte. Under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, the SC moiety was promptly charged to 0.96 V in 10 s, implying an efficient charge storage in the photocapacitor. After charging, the photocapacitor was then discharged at current densities from 0.5 to 2.5 mA cm−2 in the dark. Since the charging current of the photocapacitor was not constant, the charging process was dynamic and the ηoverall over different photo-charge times was calculated (see eqn (1)–(3) in the Experimental section for detailed calculations) and it reached a maximum of 5.6% within 0.5 s at a discharge current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2e). The photocapacitor also featured slow self-discharging and when fully charged, its Voc remained well above 0.5 V even after keeping it in the dark over 600 s (Fig. 2f).

The stability of the photocapacitor was studied by measuring its performance during repetitive cycles (Fig. 3a). The top panel of Fig. 3a displays the photo-charge/discharge curves at a current density of 3.0 mA cm−2. Impressively, the photo-charge Voc in cycle 460 remained the same as its initial value (0.96 V), confirming its outstanding stability over other reported photocapacitors.5,7,18,38,39 Meanwhile, the photocapacitor was discharged at 1.5 mA cm−2 (bottom panel of Fig. 3a) and the areal capacitance showed no deterioration and a constant energy density of ∼0.2 W h m−2 (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c and d compare the performance of the PSC and the photocapacitor when they were exposed to stable illumination, fluctuating sunlight, and complete darkness. When illuminated using a stable light source (dark yellow region), the voltage of both the PSC and photocapacitor quickly reached 0.95 V. However, the voltage of the PSC rapidly decreased to 0.2 V under fluctuating sunlight, while the voltage of the photocapacitor only dropped to ∼0.9 V (Fig. 3e). When placed in the dark, the voltage of the PSC reached 0 within 40 s, but the voltage of the photocapacitor decreased much slower, proving that the photocapacitor could deliver a more stable output compared to the bare PSC under complex illumination conditions. Apart from fluctuating light illumination, the photocapacitor was illuminated under low-intensities down to 10 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3f) and the Voc of the photocapacitor still reached 0.57 V when exposed to 25 mW cm−2 illumination for 40 s, proving that the photocapacitor could adequately work in weak light scenarios that are more frequently encountered in daily life.

As the PVA/LiCl hydrogel electrolyte only had a narrow electrochemical window (∼1 V), the ionic liquid electrolyte of EMIBF4 was used in this work because of its wider electrochemical window and high safety.41 In this design, two PSCs were connected in series to charge the high-voltage SC; the schematic and circuit diagram of the PSC pack and photocapacitor are shown in Fig. S5a and b.† Correspondingly, the photographs of the PSC pack and high-voltage photocapacitor are displayed in Fig. S5c and d.†Fig. 4a presents CV curves of the high-voltage SC part between 0 and 2.5 V with different scan rates (from 0.1 to 0.5 V s−1). The rectangular shape at various scan rates demonstrated its excellent capacitive nature and stability under a high voltage of 2.5 V. GCD curves at current densities of 0.5 to 2.0 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b) were symmetrical and the areal capacitance of the high-voltage SC ranged from 83.6 to 45.44 mF cm−2 (Fig. S4b†). The J–V curve of the PSC pack (two PSCs connected in series) under standard AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 is presented in Fig. 4c. The device exhibited a Voc of 1.81 V, a Jsc of 8.54 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.52, leading to a PCE of 8.03%. The photocapacitor based on the high-voltage SC could be charged to 1.8 V under 100 mW cm−2 illumination for 10 s, surpassing voltage values in previous reports.4,9,12,19,40,42 When the photocapacitor was discharged in the dark at different current densities from 0.5 to 2.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4d), the discharged charge ranged from 40.44 to 25.28 mF cm−2, with energy densities of 0.18 to 0.11 W h m−2. The ηoverall reached its maximum of 7.0% within 1 s and then decreased (Fig. 4e). Corresponding to the high ηoverall, ηstorage reached its maximum of 87.17% (see eqn (4) in the Experimental section for detailed calculations), higher than that of other reported photocapacitors (Fig. S6†). As compared in Fig. 4f, our device possessed a relatively higher ηoverall and energy density than most photocapacitors. To further increase the power output, a powerpack composed of three photocapacitors connected in series was fabricated to power an array of four light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, the powerpack displayed a stable voltage of ∼4.7 V in 10 s (Fig. 4g) and adequately lit up the LED array even in the absence of illumination (inset of Fig. 4g and Movie S1†), demonstrating its feasibility as a reliable power source under different illumination scenarios.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed a photocapacitor by integrating PSCs with SCs to achieve photoelectric conversion and simultaneous storage of electrical energy. Due to the large pseudocapacitance and excellent conductivity of the CGP common electrode, the photocapacitor with an EMIBF4-based ionic electrolyte showed a remarkable voltage of 1.8 V and an outstanding energy density of 0.18 W h m−2, outperforming previous reported photocapacitors. When connected in series, an array of three photocapacitors delivered a photo-charge voltage of 4.7 V and adequately powered four LEDs even after the light was switched off, validating our photocapacitor as a practical solution to power microelectronic devices under intermittent or low intensity light illumination.
