However, considerably less attention has been paid to the photo-induced processes occurring in these devices, in particular the strong dependence that device efficiencies show upon QD concentration. This study aims to shed more light on this dependence by monitoring these processes occurring at the QD/polymer interface, namely, exciton formation, charge separation and undesired charge recombination.
During the past few years, hybrid molecular photovoltaic devices based on a combination of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and polymers have attracted much attention.1–3 Important research efforts into the CdSe nanocrystal architecture have been carried out in order to improve device efficiency. For example, while the use of CdSe quantum dots has lead to power conversion efficiencies of less than 1%, the use of CdSe nanorods and tetrapods has resulted in increased efficiencies under standard solar simulated light irradiation of 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively.4,5 However, rather less attention has been paid to the study of the fundamental photoinduced processes occurring at the CdSe quantum dot/polymer interface that is believed to limit the device performance (η) to ∼0.7% thus far.6–8 In this communication we study these processes at the interface between poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) polymer and pyridine coated CdSe semiconductor quantum dots where the concentration of CdSe is varied considerably and we find a close relationship between film morphology and charge recombination dynamics which appears to have a direct impact upon device power conversion efficiency. We employ common spectroscopic techniques such as time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and photo-induced transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to probe directly the interfacial electron injection and subsequent charge recombination dynamics in thin films of these materials.
Thin films of dispersed pyridine coated CdSe QDs (4 nm diameter) in P3HT were made where the concentration of the QD is varied (w:w) in the polymer. Thickness analysis was carried out using an Ambios Technology XP-1 Profilometer indicating that the film thicknesses were in all cases around 100 nm, regardless of the nanoparticle concentration in the film. The thin film AFM morphological characterization revealed that the incremental increase of nanocrystals in these films results in the formation of aggregates (Fig. 1). These aggregates lead to the unexpected planarization of the hybrid films, shown by the roughness mean square (RMS) factor that decreases from 28 nm for pristine P3HT to 14 nm for the 90% CdSe sample.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that the UV-Visible and the photoluminescence maximum wavelength do not shift upon variation of the QD concentration (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Furthermore the strong photoluminescence peak at 670 nm due to P3HT decreases while the peak at 550 nm from the pyridine–CdSe QD augments at increasing QD concentrations. It is known that the photoluminescence dynamics of P3HT are sensitive to morphology changes. However, these observations suggest that the nature of the photophysical processes involved have not changed upon increasing amounts of nanoparticles. In turn, the absorption spectra of the QD and the emission spectrum of the polymer do not overlap significantly, and thus, we have assigned the photoluminescence quenching of the P3HT to charge transfer on the nanocrystals rather than energy transfer.
We now turn to the photophysical properties of the thin films. Fig. 2 illustrates the CdSe/P3HT emission decay kinetics upon excitation with a diode laser (λex = 405 nm) with an instrument response of 300 ps. Notice that the decay amplitude decreases with increasing QD concentration. This is in good agreement with previously reported emission steady-state measurements that suggest strong emission quenching due to efficient charge separation at the QD/polymer interface.9 The emission decay parameters are listed in Table 1 and were obtained from fitting the parameters in eqn (1) to the experimental data. I(t) = Io exp[−(τ/t)](1)From these data, we can infer that the yield for electron injection from the P3HT excited state to the CdSe nanocrystal is higher than 90% in the 50:50 (w:w) sample and occurs faster than the instrument response of our system. The former hypothesis is based on the integration of the areas below the emission decay curves while the later one is based on the mathematical procedure published previously by Koops et al.,10 from which the calculated electron transfer must occur faster than 200 ps. Thus, the primary process for efficient devices, namely charge separation at the interface, is occurring in CdSe/P3HT blends when the polymer:nanocrystal ratio is equal or higher than 50:50 (w:w). However, we cannot completely exclude other non-radiative processes competing with charge transfer that might also have an influence on the decreasing intensity of the photoluminescence measurements.

Now we focus on the interfacial charge recombination processes occurring between the free carriers at the CdSe/P3HT heterojunctions. Photo-induced transient absorption spectroscopy has been shown to be a very useful tool to study charge recombination dynamics in PCBM/P3HT films (PCBM: 1-(3-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl-[6,6]methanofullerene) previously.11 The measurements of transient absorption spectra of CdSe/P3HT recorded measuring the decay transient at different probe wavelengths between 650 and 1000 nm, are in good agreement with previous reported literature for PCBM/P3HT blends that assign the observed signal at 980 nm to positive polarons at the P3HT. We have studied the decay of this transient signal in the microsecond–millisecond time scale and found that the dynamics can be fitted with a stretched exponential function (eqn (2), Table 2). F(t) = A exp [−(τ/t)α](2)This fact is rather surprising since previously published reports on transient decays of PCBM/P3HT films display power law exponential decay dynamics (ΔOD = At−α) after low intensity laser excitation (1–17 μW). The nature of such exponential decay dynamics has been assigned to the presence of bimolecular charge recombination of long-lived separated charge species (α = 0.7).11 In similar studies involving MDMO-PPV/CdSe (weight ratio 1:4, MDMO-PPV: poly(2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyl-octyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene) and APFO-3/CdSe (1:6 w:w, APFO-3 chemical name poly(2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-4(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) blends, kinetics display a biphasic dependence on laser intensity.6,9 At values lower than 1 mW cm−2 or 30 mW cm−2 for MDMO-PPV/CdSe and APFO-3/CdSe, respectively, the intensity dependence of the PIA signal (−ΔT/T) with power follows a power law behavior assigned to a monomolecular decay process (α = 1), while at higher intensities it is bimolecular (α = 0.5). In contrast, we have found that for CdSe/P3HT blends the electron recombination dynamics are more dispersive and are best fitted to stretched exponential decay dynamics suggesting that there are multiple decay processes in the blend film probably due to the different energy of the traps present in the nanocrystals (see Fig. 3a, Table 2). We employed low laser excitation energy, 0.087 mW, in our experiments to ensure that the densities of photogenerated charge carriers are below those generated under standard AM1.5 solar radiation conditions resulting in excitation of a small fraction of the polymer. Interestingly, the analysis of our experimental decays using power law dynamics, as reported for P3HT/PCBM, MDMO-PPV/CdSe and APFO-3/CdSe films resulted in unsatisfactory fits.6,9,11

It should be noticed that the exponential factor of the stretched exponential decay also varies, probably due to the differences in trap filling in the hybrid film (Table 2, Fig. 3b). We believe that it can be directly correlated to the formation of aggregates in the hybrid thin films as evidenced by the AFM images in Fig. 1. However, all decays were far from being mono-exponential (α = 1) which is different to what has been previously observed for different blends at low laser intensities.
Our data indicates that even CdSe concentrations as low as 5% are high enough to observe efficient exciton diffusion and formation of free carriers at the CdSe/P3HT interface. However, as Table 2 shows, at such a QD concentration the recombination kinetics are rather fast, in the order of microseconds. Increasing the CdSe concentration in the blend slows down the charge recombination dynamics between photo-injected electrons on CdSe and the P3HT polarons to the millisecond time-scale (Fig. 3b). We believe that the faster back-electron transfer in blend films with lower CdSe concentrations is due to fewer percolation routes for the electrons under such conditions and therefore the electrons are trapped at the nanocrystal surface and recombine with the P3HT positive polarons before they can move to another nanocrystal. Thus, we can assign these decays to fast recombination between CdSe and P3HT where most of the P3HT polarons have recombined before a few tenths of microseconds. On the other hand, increasing the CdSe weight in the blend to 90% promotes the formation of aggregates creating sufficient percolation routes between the CdSe nanocrystals. This allows a random walk of electrons between the different quantum dots, and thus, recombination rate is reduced. These observations are key and indicate a strong correlation between the nature of the charge recombination with the charge transport phenomena in CdSe/P3HT photovoltaic devices. We have prepared functional devices with high QD concentration in order to check which concentration is the most efficient (see Table 3 for resulting parameters and Fig. 4 for P3HT:CdSeJV curve). J–V curves show an improvement of power conversion efficiency as a function of the amount of CdSe added to the polymer up to 96%wt.

This behaviour is in good agreement with the charge injection and recombination data, where the increase in QD concentration improves the charge separation and slows down the charge recombination, resulting in higher efficiencies.
It has been previously demonstrated that the presence of CdSe quantum dots in P3HT films switches the hole transport properties of the P3HT pristine polymer films from field dependent mobility to energy trap model in the absence and presence of CdSe quantum dots, respectively.12 Our results illustrate that even for a low concentration of quantum dots, the recombination dynamics are dominated by the presence of the traps in CdSe, and not by the presence of traps in the polymer. The latter would lead to power law recombination decay dynamics, as observed for fully organic PCBM/P3HT solar cells.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated through various photophysical measurements the influence that the resulting morphology plays in the pyridine coated CdSe QDs/P3HT device performance. Further work is in progress to study the effect of the acceptor shape, i.e. dots, rods or tetrapods on the final efficiency of the hybrid devices.
