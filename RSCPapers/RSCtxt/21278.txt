    , Accepted 23rd November 2014First published on 24th November 2014AbstractHere, we applied colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as an effective p-type hole-transporting material (HTM) for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. By tuning the size of PbS CQDs, we engineered the energy alignment of the valence and conduction band of this new HTM with the perovskite light harvester and achieved conversion efficiencies up to 7.5%. Absorption of PbS CQDs also extends the absorption spectrum of perovskite solar cells into the infrared region.
Thanks to the ambipolar charge transport and high charge-carrier mobilities of organometal halide perovskites, the “positive (p)–intrinsic (i)–negative (n)” thin-film heterojunction has recently emerged as a promising architecture for perovskite solar cells.1,2 For example, Snaith et al. constructed planar p–i–n heterojunction perovskite solar cells having a 15.4% power conversion efficiency (PCE) where the vapour-deposited CH3NH3PbI3−xClx film was sandwiched between the compact TiO2 electron transporter and the spiro-OMeTAD hole transporter.3 Liu et al. achieved a PCE of 15.7% for the ITO/compact-ZnO/solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag.4 Compared to sensitized5 and meso-superstructured6 solar cells using perovskites as a light harvester, the planar “p–i–n” architecture3 is simplified and offers a powerful new degree of freedom to the design and fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells because of versatile choices of both p- and n-charge transport and collection layer materials.
In most state-of-the-art high-efficiency perovskite solar cells, hole transporting materials (HTMs), the most common of which is small molecular spiro-OMeTAD, play crucial roles although hole conductor–free perovskite heterojunction solar cells were reported by several groups.7–9 On the other hand, spiro-OMeTAD is expensive and requires p-type dopants and/or exposure to an ambient atmosphere for optimal functioning at the risk of increasing the production cost as well as degrading the perovskite, hence hindering their application in cost-effective perovskite solar cells. In this context, several HTM candidates besides the spiro-type arylamine such as alternative small molecules,10,11 polymers,12–19 and p-type inorganic semiconductors20–23 have been reported, showing maximum PCEs of 12.8%, 16.2%, and 12.4%, respectively.
Among these HTMs, inorganic HTMs are most cost-effective and have been widely employed in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), however, only CuI,20 CuSCN,21 and NiO22,23 have been reported to be effective HTMs in the field of perovskite solar cells. The selection of inorganic HTMs has to be based on suitable energy band alignment as well as processing compatibility with perovskites. Very recently, PbS quantum dots have been successfully introduced into sensitized perovskite solar cells as a co-sensitizer together with CH3NH3PbI3 to extend the absorption,24,25 but PbS CQDs as the HTM are not yet reported. In this work, we demonstrate planar p–i–n heterojunction perovskite solar cells with a maximum PCE of 7.5% that employ thin films of PbS CQDs as the HTM layer.
As shown in Fig. 1a, we construct the planar PbS CQD/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM device structure on an indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass front contact by a spin-coating method and evaporate 100 nm of Al on top as the back contact. PbS CQDs of various sizes were synthesized through the reaction of Pb-oleate and bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide (TMS) and deposited into p-type compact thin films following a modified published method.26 4 drops of PbS CQDs in hexane (8 mg ml−1) were dropped onto ITO glass substrates, treated with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) methanol solution (10 mg ml−1) and rinsed with methanol. We repeated this layer-by-layer process three times and annealed the as-deposited samples at 70 °C in air for 12 hours. By using TMAOH for solid-state ligand exchange in an ambient environment followed by air annealing to maximize oxygen binding and thus p-doping, we obtained highly robust p-type PbS CQD films with the doping densities around 1018 cm−3.27 The PbS CQD layer thickness is about 20 nm.

The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was formed on top of the PbS CQD film using a two-step sequential deposition process inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox as previously reported,5,23 followed by deposition of the n-type electron transporter PCBM which ensured the selective collection of electrons at the Al anode. Briefly, PbI2 DMF solution (300 mg ml−1) was spin-coated onto the PbS CQD layer and baked on a hotplate at 70 °C for 30 min. When the PbI2 seed layer cooled down to room temperature, it was immersed into a 10 mg ml−1 CH3NH3I anhydrous isopropanol (IPA) solution (preheated to 50 °C), maintained at 50 °C for 45 s, rinsed with absolute IPA solution for 10 s, and finally baked on a 70 °C hotplate for 20 min to complete the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3 absorber layer is approximately 400 nm according to the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the completed devices (Fig. 1b).
For planar perovskite solar cells, flat and compact thin films of each layer are highly desirable for high efficiency. We characterized the film morphology and surface roughness of the as-deposited PbS CQDs, PbI2, and CH layers by atomic force microscopy (AFM) with SEM (Fig. 2). The average surface roughness of the PbS CQD film was 0.84 nm, suggestive of a flat and compact HTM layer. The formation of larger PbI2 crystals on top increased the surface roughness to 5.37 nm. After being immersed into CH3NH3I, PbI2 the crystals immediately reacted with CH3NH3I and transformed into larger CH grains, increasing the film thickness and surface roughness (∼10.58 nm). The CH film grown on the PbS CQD HTM layer remained smooth and nonporous, a key parameter to avoid shunting paths that probably degrade the FF and Voc in such planar devices.

The AFM image sizes are 5 × 5 μm and the scale bar is 0–10 nm, 0–100 nm, and 0–300 nm for (a), (b) and (c), respectively. The scale bars for all SEM images are 500 nm. 
With the benefit of a large excitonic Bohr radius of 18 nm and a low bulk energy bandgap of 0.41 eV, the bandgap of PbS CQDs can be widely tuned from 0.7 to 2.1 eV by facile size-tuning in dot synthesis. This distinct advantage enables us to investigate and understand the role of the energy alignment of the perovskite/HTM interface in determining device parameters. We obtained PbS CQDs of different sizes by varying the synthesis temperature and applied them as the HTM for comparison. Fig. 3a shows the absorption spectra of the smallest 1-, medium-sized 2- and 3-, as well as the largest 4-PbS CQDs, the first exciton adsorption peaks of which were at 890, 1050, 1150, and 1500 nm, approximately corresponding to the energy bandgap values of 1.4, 1.2, 1.1 and 0.8 eV, respectively. We took transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images to characterize the as-synthesized 1-PbS CQDs (Fig. 1 in the ESI†). The average CQD size is approximately 3 nm, in accordance with the previous report. We also recorded the absorption spectra of the PbS CQD film before and after the CH3NH3PbI3 deposition (Fig. 3b). The excitonic peak of the PbS CQD film still remained after CH3NH3PbI3 deposition, confirming the preservation of the quantum confinement of PbS CQDs. We then compared the 600 nm excited photoluminescence (PL) spectra of quartz/PbS CQD/CH3NH3PbI3 samples with quartz/CH3NH3PbI3 and the results are shown in Fig. 3c. The CH3NH3PbI3 bandedge luminance at 760 nm was observed for all the samples but it could be quenched by the underlying PbS CQD layer, indicative of effective charge transfer interactions between PbS CQDs and CH3NH3PbI3, one of the prerequisites for PbS CQDs to be an effective HTM of perovskite solar cells. We applied X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements to study the structural evolution (Fig. 3d). The average grain size estimated from the Scherrer equation using XRD data was approximately 60 nm, consistent with the SEM observation. As the immersion time of the PbI2 film into CH3NH3I increased, the diffraction peaks indexed to tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 enhanced; the prolonged treatment to 45 s resulted in strong diffraction peaks of CH3NH3PbI3 with very small intensities of the PbI2 diffraction peaks, suggestive of a quick and nearly complete transformation from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 at elevated temperatures with a trace amount of PbI2 leftover that may be harmless.

The fact that the reduction in PL intensity is dependent on the size (bandgap) of PbS CQDs provides further evidence that the energy alignment of the PbS/CH3NH3PbI3 interface plays a crucial role in the charge transfer. According to the positions of the conduction bandedge (CB) and valence bandedge (VB) of the PbS CQDs,28 we plotted the energy level diagram of the corresponding materials used in our devices that employed different PbS CQDs in Fig. 4a. The VB of the PbS CQDs in this study all lies near −5.0–−5.1 eV and is shallow compared to the VB of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.4 eV); the ∼0.4 eV valence band offset sufficiently favors hole injection from CH3NH3PbI3 into the PbS HTM. On the other hand, the CB becomes deeper as the PbS CQD size increased and it was deeper than the CB of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.9 eV) in the case of 3- and 4-PbS, showing a conduction band offset favouring the electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 into PbS. As a result, the largest 4-PbS led to a maximum PL intensity reduction. In contrast, the smallest 1-PbS had a CB shallower than −3.9 eV, thereby blocking the electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 into PbS and showed a minimum PL quenching degree.

This picture of band alignment is further confirmed by the photovoltaic device performance measured under standard AM 1.5G illumination. As shown in Fig. 4b and Table 1, the electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 was favored as the CB of PbS became deeper than that of CH3NH3PbI3, lowering both the photovoltage and photocurrent. As a result, the Voc, Jsc and PCE decreased monotonically as the PbS CQD size increased. The smallest 1-PbS (890 nm wavelength and 1.4 eV bandgap) was found to be the most effective HTM owing to the shallowest CB and least light absorbing due to its largest bandgap, so that it could effectively block the undesired electron injection from CH3NH3PbI3 in addition to favouring the hole injection. The Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE were determined to be 0.86 V, 12.1 mA cm−2, 72% and 7.5%, respectively, all of which were improved compared to the device without the PbS CQD HTM layer. The FF may be further increased by intentionally enhanced p-type doping of PbS CQDs. It should be noted that we have also fabricated solar cells employing PbS CQDs as the absorber, that is, ITO glass/PbS CQDS/PCBM/Al. The device showed a very poor power conversion efficiency of less than 0.5% (Table S1, ESI†). We further measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite solar cells using PbS CQDs whose absorption peak is at 932 nm as the HTM. As shown in Fig. 4c, the clear contribution from 800 nm to 1000 nm originates from PbS CQD THE, confirming their additional role as light absorbers that further extend the absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells into the infrared region.

In summary, we constructed planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells employing colloidal quantum dots as effective hole-transporting materials. Owing to the quantum confinement effect, we engineered the band alignment of the CH3NH3PbI3/CQD HTM interface through the size control of PbS CQDs. The hole injection from CH3NH3PbI3 into PbS CQDs is favored by the shallow valence bandedge of PbS CQDs compared to CH3NH3PbI3; the electron injection could be blocked as long as the conduction bandedge position of PbS CQDs is higher compared to CH3NH3PbI3, which could be achieved by decreasing the PbS CQD size. The device based on this new hole transporting material showed an optimized power conversion efficiency of 7.5% with its absorption extended to 1000 nm, thanks to the absorption of the PbS CQD HTM. The availability of various CQD materials combined with their solution-processability and absorption extension could offer a versatile and cost-effective platform to understand and optimize perovskite solar cells.
