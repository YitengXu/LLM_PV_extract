1. Introduction
Perovskites are interesting and important materials because of their unique optical and electrical properties, such as photoluminescence, electroluminescence, large third-order non-linear optical properties, and so on.1 Organometal halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted much attention as a new class of light harvesters for mesoscopic solar cells. Organolead halide perovskite materials are a promising, low cost, easily synthesised set of materials. They act as a light absorber and both an electron and hole transporter. Perovskite nanopigments can be deposited by simple solution processing via spin- or dip coating and perovskite based hybrid solar cells can be easily synthesised using simple and cheap techniques. Inorganic–organic hybrid solar cell band gaps can be easily tuned by chemical management to produce translucent colours which can be used to create colourful solar designs. These mesoscopic solar cells exhibit high power conversion efficiencies and have great potential in real applications. In photovoltaic systems they exhibit ambipolar character meaning they act as both p-type and n-type conductors. Their intrinsic properties can be easily understood by knowing the chemistry of organic and inorganic compounds and these perovskites have large absorption co-efficients as well as high carrier mobilities. During the last decade liquid electrolyte based sensitised solar cells have had some solvent leakage problems but this disadvantage can be easily overcome by using hole transporting materials (spiro-MeOTAD, PCBTDPP, etc.). Previously, perovskite solar cells have been unstable, but recent developments of replacing a liquid electrolyte with a solid material, have enabled researchers to say that the most efficient perovskite solar cells will have around 15–20% power conversion efficiency based on optimized perovskite sensitized solar cells. These recent investigations are indicative of the development of low cost–high efficiency solar cells using organo halide perovskites as light harvesters.

: A mixture of CH3NH3I (0.8 g) and PbI2 (2.314 g) in a 1:1 molar ratio was added into a round bottom flask then dissolved in 4 ml of γ-butyrolactone and stirred at 60 °C for 12 h. To synthesize the mixed halide perovskites, a 3:1 molar ratio of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 were dissolved in anhydrous DMF and stirred at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere overnight.2
2.1 Crystal structure of metal halide perovskites
Metal halide perovskites have a cubic framework structure of composition ABX3 (A = alkali, B = Pb and X = halide) where ‘A’ is a large cation having a 12-fold cuboctahedron coordination and ‘B’ is a metal bonded to six X anions having a 6-fold coordination at the corners and surrounded by octahedron X anions forming a three-dimensional structure (Fig. 1).3

2.2 Electronic properties of perovskites on the metal oxide layer
Perovskites have unique ambipolar properties and hence act as both n-type and p-type materials when irradiated, they absorb light and push an electron into the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 film with an energy gap Eg ∼ 1.5 eV. It has been shown that the electrons can easily transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to the CB of the TiO2 film and the holes generated in CH3NH3PbI3 transfer to the HTM layer. In mixed-halide perovskites Al2O3 plays a significant role and acts as a mesoporous scaffold for the perovskites. When CH3NH3PbI2Cl is irradiated the photogenerated electrons cannot inject into the Al2O3 film due to the very large band gap (Eg ∼ 7–9 eV) of Al2O3 and the holes produced in the perovskite transport to the HTM layer.4
3. Photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells
Perovskites have unique optical properties, high coefficients of optical absorption in the visible region ranging from 104 to 105 cm−14 and superb matching energy levels at the interface with TiO2, which lead CH3NH3PbI3 and the HTM to form a planar heterojunction solar cell. We discuss in detail the photovoltaic performances of perovskite sensitized solar cells below.
3.1 Perovskite-sensitized solar cells with an iodine/tri-iodide redox couple
Miyasaka et al. reported the photovoltaic function of perovskite nanocrystalline particles self organized on TiO2 as n-type semiconductors with a power conversion efficiency of 3.8% and a high photovoltage of 0.96 V on a CH3NH3PbBr3 sensitized solar cell.1c Park's research group reported that thinner films show higher photocurrent densities compared to relatively thicker layers due to the high absorption coefficients of perovskites, one order of magnitude higher than the absorption coefficient of N719 dye. After optimizing the thickness of the TiO2 film, a 6.2% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved which is better than N719 dye (3.89%). Upon optimization of the perovskite coating solution concentration, post-annealing conditions and TiO2 surface modification, the best PCE of 6.54%5 was obtained at AM 1.5 G 1 sun illumination. The stability of this test cell device (CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized solar cell) is approximately 10 min (about 80% degradation) because CH3NH3PbI3 tends to dissolve gradually into the redox electrolyte (I−/I3−).
3.2 Solid-state mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells
To solve the aforesaid mentioned problem, Grätzel, Park and coworkers investigated a new solid-state mesoscopic solar cell using CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals as a light absorber and spiro-MeOTAD as a hole-transporting layer. When submicron thick films of mesoporous anatase were used a high PCE of 9.7% was achieved under AM 1.5 G illumination along with excellent long term stability. The open circuit voltage and fill factor of these devices are varied by increasing the TiO2 film thickness. The energy levels in the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD junction matched well for charge separation. Similar results were observed for the Al2O3/Perovskite/Spiro-MeOTAD system (Fig. 2).6
 Fig. 2  Energy level diagram of hole transporting materials. 
In perovskite hybrid solar cells, HTMs play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiencies, which enhances the fill factor (FF). Recently Seok and coworkers reported different PCEs with different hole transporting materials such as Spiro-MeOTAD, PTAA, PCDTBT, etc., correspondingly, they achieved an 8% PCE with Spiro-OMeTAD with FF 58.8% and with PTAA they achieved a 12% PCE with FF 72.7%, therefore enhancing the fill factor consequently increases power conversion efficiencies.7 A variety of HTMs are displayed in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Structural representation of hole transporting materials (HTMs). 
3.3 Mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells
Etgar et al. assumed that CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles act as a light harvester and at the same time as a hole conductor, rendering superfluous the use of an additional p-type material for transporting the positive charge carriers. CH3NH3PbI3 permits electron injection into TiO2 and hole transport to the gold back contact. A TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction device without a HTM layer showed a PCE of 5.5% under standard AM 1.5 solar light of 1000 W m−2 intensity.8
3.4 Meso-superstructured solar cells (MSSCs)
Proposed meso-superstructures from FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI2Cl/SpiroMeOTAD/Ag, where CH3NH3PbI2Cl adsorbed mesoporous Al2O3 demonstrated a highest efficiency of 10.9% under simulated Air mass (AM) 1.5 full sun illumination. In this study, the photo excited electrons were not injected into Al2O3, which indicates Al2O3 acts as a scaffold layer and CH3NH3PbI2Cl serves as a light harvester as well as an electron-transporting layer.

Perovskites were viewed as “the next big thing” in photovoltaics.9 Perovskite based solid state mesoscopic solar cells are the most efficient photovoltaic devices for highly efficient photo current. These perovskites consist of the formula CH3NH3PbX3 where (X = I, Cl, Br). Organolead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) is highly effective in solid state mesoscopic solar cells and plays a significant role in light absorption exhibiting a broad range of absorption covering the visible to near-infrared spectrum as well as a higher extinction coefficient. Seok's research group reported a solid-state CH3NH3PbI3-sensitized mesoscopic solar cell with a PCE of 12% at one sun illumination.
Similarly, organolead bromide perovskite (CH3NH3PbBr3) plays a significant role as a light harvester in solid state mesoscopic solar cells and it should be a good candidate for hybrid solar cells due to its large band gap energy. Increasing the concentration of CH3NH3PbBr3 steadily enhances the Jsc, fill factor and PCE of hybrid solar cells. Solid state hybrid solar cells consisting of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles as the light harvester show PCEs of up to 3.04%.10 Using a mixed halide perovskite like CH3NH3PbI2Cl achieved an efficiency of 10.9%, and CH3NH3PbI2Br achieved a 4.87%11 efficiency acting as both a light absorber and electron transporting material.
Burschka et al. achieved a 15% PCE using a sequential deposition route for perovskite-sensitized solar cells.12 The perovskite was prepared by depositing a PbI2 solution onto a nanoporous TiO2 film followed by CH3NH3I solution. These sequential depositions provide much better control over the perovskite morphology than previously reported routes. The device specification was as follows: Glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au.
In perovskite sensitized solar cells the thickness and compactness of the absorbing layer play a major role in the power conversion efficiency; if the layer is too thin it can't absorb significantly and if the layer is too thick the exciton diffusion length is shorter than the film thickness consequently decreasing charge collection at the n–p heterojunction. Similarly if the film is not compact or there are pinholes, direct contact between the HTM (spiro-OMeTAD) and TiO2 can be created, leading to a shunt pathway forming which decreases the FF and VOC. To overcome these drawbacks, very recently Liu et al.13 achieved a 15.4% PCE through a dual source thermal evaporation method (Fig. 4) by forming a uniform, compact, flat thin absorbing layer for the perovskite sensitized solar cell. The device specification was as below: Glass/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3-xCl2-x/HTM/Ag.

3.5 CH3NH3PbI3/fullerene planar-heterojunction hybrid solar cells
Indeed, efficient devices have been made where no organic hole transporter is utilized. Cross land et al.14 reported perovskite as a donor material in donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction solar cells and they created a hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite–acceptor planar heterojunction (PHJ) (Fig. 5). The formation of the PHJ at the donor–acceptor interface generates a photovoltaic effect that is the energy levels between the HOMO level of the donor and LUMO level of the acceptor and modulates the magnitude of the open circuit voltage (Voc) and PCE. The device specification was as below.
 Fig. 5  Representation of CH3NH3PbI3/fullerene planar heterojunction hybrid solar cell. 
When depositing or growing a thin layer of C60 on CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite the LUMO level of fullerene is −4.5 eV and the HOMO level of lead iodide perovskite is −5.4 eV; the value for fullerene, −4.5 eV, indicates it is an ideal “electron acceptor” for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite creating a donor–acceptor PHJ system. The photovoltaic performance of the device corresponds to a PCE of 1.6% under standard 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation. Replacing the acceptor material with PCBM which has a LUMO level of −3.9 eV increases the efficiency corresponding to a PCE of 2.4% under standard 1 sun AM 1.5 simulated solar irradiation. The open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of these devices varies by varying the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.15
Perovskites were used as light harvesting materials in 2009 and within a very short period of time a 3.8% power conversion efficiency increased to over 15% by 2013. The year-wise efficiency of perovskite sensitized solar cells is represented in Fig. 6.

4. Challenges in solid state meso structured perovskite solar cells
• The thickness of the metal-oxide active layer should be less than 1 μm, if the thickness increases then the efficiency of the device decreases meaning the Voc, FF and Jsc of the device are effected.
• Replacement of toxic metal Pb by another metal like Ba which is more abundant, is less toxic for eco-friendly systems.16
• Optimization of the active layer; the surface of the active layer should be uniform and rough, poor coverage affects the efficiency of the device, uniform pore filling leads to forming a better planar heterojunction solar cell.17
• Morphology of the cell architecture, better understanding about the cell, and simplification of the cell structure can increase the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
• The effect of poor coverage; insufficient coverage results in a high frequency of shunt paths leading to decrease in photocurrent.
Though we have discussed much about perovskite-sensitized solar cells, here we tabulated the efficiencies for readers convenience (Table 1).

Future perspective
We were inspired to study perovskite sensitized solar cells as they are a light harvesting, inexpensive material, which are highly efficient fast track solar cells for future generation, and these rapid developments suggest perovskites have extraordinary potential in real applications. Perovskites with 20–25% PCEs have become a champion material13 for solar cells and can take the solar industry to new dimensions. We hope this review will be helpful to develop better a understanding of this field (Table 1).
