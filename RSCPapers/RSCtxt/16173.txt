Introduction
Recently, organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit tremendous potential in the world's renewable energy strategy due to their predominant advantages such as low cost, light weight and large-area fabrication on flexible substrates and have attracted much attention.1–4 Much of the focus has been on the development of polymer solar cells that have seen a dramatic rise in efficiency over the last decade. Encouraging power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 7–8% have been achieved from blends of polymer donors and fullerene acceptors.5–7 Small molecules offer potential advantages over conjugated polymer counterparts in terms of defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, high purity, easy purification, easy mass-scale production, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility. However, much less attention has been devoted to small molecule solar cells that have lagged behind their polymer counterparts.8–11 After year 2005, this class of solar cell has seen a growing body of research. Great efforts have been dedicated to develop small molecule materials such as star- or X-shaped molecules,12–16 linear analogs with D–A–D structures,17–24 fused polycyclic arene,25 and other organic dyes.26–28 Now the highest PCEs of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on small molecules are 4–5%,22,29,30 comparable to some of the best known polymer systems, such as regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).1–4 However, the highest PCEs reported for small molecule/fullerene derivative BHJ OSCs are still lower than that of polymer/fullerene derivative BHJ solar cells. The relatively lower efficiency of small molecular BHJ OSCs becomes the biggest hindrance to their application.
Conjugated thiophenes, as one of the largest families of organic semiconductors with potential application in opto-electronics, have been attracting considerable attention over the last few decades.31–33 Polythiophenes such as P3HT are widely used in BHJ OSCs.1–4 Since batch-to-batch difference exists in the polymer preparation, the device performance may change a lot when using different batches. In comparison with thiophene polymers, thiophene small molecules or oligomers possess several advantages for use in OSCs, for example, improved batch-to-batch reproducibility. Vapor-deposited OSCs based on linear oligothiophenes exhibited PCEs as high as 5.2%,34,35 while solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on linear oligothiophenes exhibited PCEs as high as 3.7%.36,37 Solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on dendritic oligothiophenes exhibited PCEs as high as 2.5%.38–45 Relative to linear and dendritic oligothiophenes, star- or X-shaped oligothiophenes gave lower PCEs (0.2–0.8%).46,47
Here we report synthesis of three new X-shaped conjugated oligothiophenes with different length of the arms (1–3, Fig. 1) as well as photovoltaic performance of solution-processed organic solar cells using molecule 2 as donor material and PC61BM or PC71BM as acceptor material. PCEs of 1–1.54% were obtained, which are higher than that reported for the X-shaped oligothiophenes in the literature.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to compounds 1–3 are shown in Scheme 1. Stille coupling of commercially available tetrabromothiophene with 3-n-dodecyl-5-tri-n-butylstannyl-thiophene gave the intermediate a in 66% yield. Bromination of a with NBS at 0 °C gave the tetrabromide b in 96% yield. Stille coupling of b with tributyl-[2,2′]bithiophen-5-yl-stannane and tributyl-[2,2′;5′,2′′]terthiophen-5-yl-stannane afforded compound 1 and 2 in 33% and 35% yield, respectively. Bromination of 1 with NBS at 0 °C afforded the intermediate c in 93% yield. Stille coupling of c with 5-(tributylstannyl)-5′′-(n-hexyl)-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene gave compound 3 in 11% yield. All the new compounds were fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis, except compound 3 due to very poor solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and THF. Compound 1 is oil, while compounds 2 and 3 are solids. Due to oil state of 1 and poor solubility of 3, we did not measure their properties.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of compounds 1–3 are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compounds 1–3 exhibit excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) at ca. 440, 425 and 340 °C, respectively, in nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 2a). The DSC trace of compound 2 is shown in Fig. 2b. Two endothermic peaks due to solid-solid phase transition and melting at around 92 and 118 °C, respectively, were observed from the heating trace. During cooling process, an exothermic peak due to crystallization was observed at around 57 °C.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra in dilute CHCl3 solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption maximum of 2 in solution red shifts 32 nm compared to that of 1, while the absorption maximum of 3 in solution further red shifts 40 nm compared to that of 2 (Table 1). This can be attributed to increase in conjugation length in 2 and 3 due to more thiophene units at arms. The absorption maximum of 1–3 in thin film red shifts 20, 14 and 14 nm compared to that in solution respectively, indicating strong intermolecular interaction in solid state. The optical bandgap Eg estimated from the absorption edge in film decreases with increasing conjugation length of the arm (Table 1).

Electrochemical properties

Cyclic voltammogram of compound 2 is illustrated in Fig. 4. 2 displays only one reversible oxidation peak at 0.58 V vs.Ag/Ag+. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of 2 is calculated to be −5.29 eV by EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV), in which Eox represents the onset oxidation potential vs.Ag/Ag+.48 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level is estimated to be −3.16 eV by ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg (eV). The LUMO level of 2 is higher than that (−3.9 eV) of PC61BM or PC71BM;49,50 the LUMO gap between the donor and acceptor is large enough to guarantee photoinduced electron transfer between them. It is worth noting that HOMO of 2 is 0.5 eV lower than that of P3HT (ca. −4.8 eV)51 due to limited π-electron delocalization in X-shaped oligothiophene relative to that in linear polythiophene. The difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor is as large as 1.4 eV, which could lead to high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of solar cells.

Field-effect transistors
Thin films of 2 were prepared by spin-coating on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified Si/SiO2 substrates and investigated by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD). Fig. 5 shows the XRD pattern of 2. A broad reflection peak accompanied with a sharp peak appeared at 2θ = 21.1° corresponding to a distance of 4.2 Å. This result indicates that some ordered molecular structures could be obtained with a possible π–π stacking distance of ca. 4 Å. Fig. 6 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of 2. The film exhibits a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains and a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.77 nm. These aggregated domains are beneficial to charge transport.

To measure hole mobilities of compound 2, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2 were fabricated on octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treated SiO2/Si substrates through spin-coating process. In a top contact geometry using Au as the source and drain electrodes, 2 exhibits typical p-type semiconductor behaviour in air. The p-type output curve and the corresponding transfer characteristics are depicted in Fig. 7, which exhibits good current modulation and well-defined linear and saturation regions. The field-effect hole mobility (μh) calculated was at around 1.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 with current on/off ratio of 103 and threshold voltage (VT) at around −27 V from the transfer characteristics.

Organic solar cells
Organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells were fabricated by spin-casting the blends of 2:PC61BM (1:2, w/w) or 2:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) as active layer (Fig. 8). Solar cells based on the blend of 2:PC61BM (1:2, w/w) gave an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.93 V, short circuit current (JSC) of 2.71 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.40, and PCE of 1.02%. The PCE is higher than that reported for the X-shaped oligothiophenes in the literature (0.2–0.8%).46,47Fig. 8b shows the typical current density-voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs based on blend of 2:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) in the dark and under illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. Relative to that with PC61BM, VOC (0.94 V) and FF (0.36) are similar, while improved JSC of 4.61 mA cm−2 leads to improved PCE of 1.54%. As shown in Fig. 9, the blend of 2:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) exhibits a broad incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) plateau between 300 and 700 nm with a maximum of 36% at 470 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum of the blend.

The active layer morphology was examined by atomic force microscope (AFM) technique in tapping mode. Fig. 10 shows the AFM topographic images of the films of 2:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend. The film exhibits a typical cluster structure with many aggregated domains and a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.46 nm. The domain sizes estimated by cross-section profiles are about tens nm. These nanoscale aggregated domains are beneficial to charge separation and enhanced efficiency of the OSC.

Conclusions
Three new X-shaped conjugated oligothiophenes with 3 (1), 4 (2) and 6 (3) thiophenes on the arms were synthesized. The state and solubility of these compounds are susceptible to the arm length. 1 is oil, while 2 and 3 are solids. 1 and 2 have good solubility, while 3 has poor solubility. The absorption maximum red shifts and optical bandgap decreases with increasing conjugation length of the arm. 2 exhibits an estimated HOMO of −5.29 eV, and an estimated LUMO of −3.16 eV, and a hole mobility of 1.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1 in air. Solution-processed OSCs based on blends of 2:PC61BM or PC71BM (1:2, w/w) exhibit PCEs of 1.02 and 1.54%, respectively, under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, which is among the highest reported for X-shaped all-thiophene oligomers.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless otherwise stated, starting materials were used as commercially purchased without further purification. Toluene was distilled from sodium-benzophenone under nitrogen before use. Reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. Tributyl-[2,2′]bithiophen-5-yl-stannane,52 tributyl-[2,2′;5′,2′′]terthiophen-5-yl-stannane,53 and 5-(tributylstannyl)-5′′-hexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′- terthiophene54 were synthesized according to the literature procedures.
Characterization
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. Mass spectra were measured on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF Analyzer using MALDI mode. Elemental analyses were carried out using a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer. Solution (chloroform) and thin-film (on quartz substrate) UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen on a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in CH2Cl2 using a computer-controlled Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation, a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model DTG-60) under a nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. DSC measurements were performed using an EXSTAR6000 instrument under N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The nanoscale morphology of blend film was observed by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) (NanoMan VS, Veeco, USA) in contact mode. XRD of thin films was performed in the reflection mode at 40 kV and 200 mA with Cu-Kα radiation using a 2 kW Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer.

          OFET device fabrication and characterization
Field-effect transistors based on 2 films were fabricated in a bottom gate, top contact configuration at ambient atmosphere. Highly n-doped silicon and thermally grown silicon dioxide (300 nm) were used as back gate and gate dielectric, respectively. The substrate were cleaned with pure water, hot concentrated sulfuric acid-hydrogen peroxide solution (concentrated sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide water = 2:1), pure water, and pure isopropanol. Then vaporized octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) was used for surface modification of the gate dielectric layer.
Solutions of 2 in chlorobenzene (about 10 mg mL−1) were spin coated onto hot OTS treated substrates (about 80 °C) to form thin films. Prior to thermal evaporation of top contacts, the films were baked at 80 °C in a vacuum chamber for 30 min to remove the residual solvent. Gold contacts (25 nm) for source and drain electrodes (finger parallel source–drain geometry) were vacuum-deposited at a rate of 1 Å s−1 through a metal shadow mask that defined a series of transistor devices with a channel length (L) of 50 μm and a channel width (W) of 1 mm. The characterization was accomplished by Keithley 4200 SCS with a micromanipulator 6150 probe station in a clean shielded box at ambient atmosphere. Then field-effect mobility was calculated from the standard equation for saturation region in metal-dioxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors: IDS = (W/2L)μCi(VG − VT)2, where IDS is drain-source current, μ is field-effect mobility, W and L are the channel width and length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the dielectric layer (Ci = 9.6 nF cm−2), VG is the gate voltage and VT is the threshold voltage.
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization

          OSC devices were fabricated with indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode and Ca/Al as the cathode. The patterned ITO glass (sheet resistance = 30 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 30 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP A1 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 30 min. A chlorobenzene solution of blend of compound 2 with PC61BM or PC71BM (1:2, w/w) was subsequently spin-coated on the surface of PEDOT:PSS layer as the photosensitive layer. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured by Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A calcium layer (ca. 20 nm) and an aluminium layer (ca. 60 nm) were then evaporated subsequently onto the surface of the photosensitive layer in vacuum (ca. 10−4 Pa) as the cathode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. Current–voltage (I–V) curve was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The input photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) was measured by Stanford Research System model SR380 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with WDG3 monochromator and 500 W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.

Synthesis of c
To a round-bottom flask were added 1 (0.11 mmol, 200 mg), THF (10 mL), and acetic acid (5 mL). The mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and a solution of NBS (0.5 mmol, 89 mg) in THF (10 mL) was added dropwise in absence of light. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h. Water (100 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 100 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (20/1) as eluent yielding an orange solid (210 mg, 93%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.01 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 4H), 6.98 (s, 2H), 6.96 (m, 6H), 6.93 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.90 (t, J = 3.2 Hz, 4H), 6.79 (s, 2H), 2.74 (m, 8H), 1.60 (m, 8H), 1.24 (m, 72H), 0.88 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 139.87, 139.84, 138.79, 138.69, 136.16, 135.96, 135.68, 135.35, 133.67, 133.24, 133.14, 133.08, 132.38, 132.06, 131.38, 130.78, 129.43, 126.42, 124.33, 124.24, 123.75, 123.65, 111.17, 111.05, 32.11, 30.93, 30.55, 29.99, 29.89, 29.86, 29.79, 29.74, 29.70, 29.64, 29.57, 29.44, 22.87, 14.31. MS (MALDI-TOF): m/z 2057 (M+). Anal. Calcd for C100H120 Br4S13: C, 58.35; H, 5.88. Found: C, 58.11; H, 6.02%.
Synthesis of 3
To a three-neck round-bottom flask were added c (0.044 mmol, 90 mg), 5-(tributylstannyl)-5′′-hexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (0.35 mmol, 218 mg), and dry toluene (10 mL). The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min. Pd(PPh3)4 (9 μmol, 10 mg) was added under nitrogen. The mixture was refluxed for two days and then cooled down to room temperature. The mixture was filtered, and the solid was washed with CH2Cl2. Finally, the solid was purified by size exclusion column chromatography over Bio-Rad Bio-Beads S-X3 eluting with chloroform to afford a brown solid (15 mg, 11%). MS (MALDI-TOF): m/z 3061 (M+). Anal. Calcd for C172H196S25: C, 67.40; H, 6.45. Found: C, 67.11; H, 6.32%. We were unable to perform 1H NMR and 13C NMR due to limited solubility.
