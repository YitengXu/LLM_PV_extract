    , Accepted 27th March 2014First published on 28th March 2014AbstractThere is a general consensus to develop renewable energy storage and conversion technologies to replace fossil fuel energy for sustainable development. Currently, the development of high performance energy storage and conversion devices is an important step on the road to alternative energy technologies. Among the newly developed materials, porous carbons and related functional materials including metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids show potential for applications in such devices. Recently, the newly emerging open framework materials, including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic frameworks (POFs), act as outstanding templates and/or precursors to fabricate porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials based on their high surface areas, controllable structures and abundant metal/organic species in their scaffolds. Here, recent significant advances in the development of open frameworks for preparation of porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials are reviewed with special emphases on the applications in the energy and environmental areas.Jian-Ke SunJian-Ke Sun was born in 1985 in Hunan, P.

Broader context
The increasing environmental pollution and energy shortage require the development of new sustainable and renewable energy technologies. Various materials have been optimized to increase energy storage and conversion efficiency. Among them, porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials including metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids play a critical role in developing high-performance fuel cells, Li(S/O2)-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and so on. The newly emerging open frameworks, including MOFs and POFs, are promising candidates as templates and/or precursors for preparation of porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials on the basis of their high surface areas, adjusted pore metrics, abundant metal/organic species, and so on. In this review, we present a survey on the research progress for the use of MOFs and POFs as templates and/or precursors to prepare porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials for applications in energy and environmental areas.

1. Introduction
Carbons, especially porous carbon materials, provide unique benefits such as high specific surface areas and large pore volumes in combination with excellent chemical and mechanical stability.1–3 Such characteristics make them good candidates for wide applications in gas storage and separation,4–6 catalysis,7–9 sensing,10 and energy harvesting, storage and conversion.11–14 These applications strongly depend on their pore structures, and micromorphologies, which are determined by the synthesis methodology. The synthesis of porous carbons with high surface areas could be simply achieved by direct carbonization of organic precursors with physical or chemical activations.15,16 However, the carbon materials obtained from these methods often contain disordered structures with wide size distributions, which greatly limit broad applications, especially in dealing with selective molecular diffusions or discriminations. To control the ordered pore structures with relatively narrow pore size distributions, the use of the template carbonization route is an effective approach. The strategy developed earlier is the hard-template or nanocast method via the replication of a rigid template material which already possesses controlled porosity.17–20 Such an approach could effectively construct nanoporous carbons with desired dimensional structures and ordered micro-, meso-, and macropores depending on the different kinds of hard templates (for example, zeolites, mesoporous silicates, colloidal particles, etc.). Recently, the use of soft templates is emerging as another method to prepare ordered nanoporous carbons. Such an approach involves the cooperative assembly of structure-directing agents (such as block-copolymers) able to form lyotropic phases with suitable organic carbon precursors.21–23 Although this method seems much facile since the processing avoids removing the templates after carbonization, only a few limited examples have been reported until now. The main reason behind this is the requirements of stable organic templates since the less stable ones would be thermally decomposed before completion of the carbonization process.
Emerging as a new class of porous crystalline materials, MOFs,24–29 constructed by alternatively connecting metal ions with organic struts in a three dimensional space, have become a rapidly developing research area and have attracted much attention in the last few years. Compared with conventional porous materials, the most intriguing merit of this material is designable frameworks with a modular assembly process, which can incorporate various functions through carefully choosing the organic struts and metal species.30–32 One of the most intriguing features is their high porosity as well as large surface areas, which make them good candidates in gas storage and separation,33–38 catalysis,39–43 proton conduction,44–47 sensing or recongnition,48,49 thin films,50,51 drug delivery,52,53 and so on.54–58 Recently, the exploration of MOFs in urgent energy and environment-related applications59,60 such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),61 solar cells,62,63 and photocatalytic water splitting64–67 have been rapidly developed. Due to the highly ordered porous structures with abundant organic struts, MOFs would be good candidates for use as templates and/or precursors to give highly porous carbon materials under proper thermolysis conditions.68 Besides, because of the regular arrangement of metal nodes in MOF precursors, the carbon hybrids containing nanostructured metal species (e.g., metal oxides) are prone to be formed in the in situ carbonization process. The combinations of two attractive properties of these two components will enlighten more intriguing applications under their synergistical work. In addition, the purely nanostructured metals/metal oxides could also be the only products from MOF precursors under certain controlled synthesis conditions. Such facile synthesis methods will inspire a new insight in preparation and application of nanomaterials in future.
On the other hand, another family of porous materials that are only composed of organic skeletons, namely, porous organic frameworks (POFs), has experienced rapid growth in last few years.69–79 Owing to the strong covalent linkages in these frameworks, this kind of material features high stability and promising applications in gas captures,80 heterogeneous catalysis,81 light emitting and harvesting,82 and so on. The extremely high concentrations of carbon species in these materials make them intrinsic precursors for preparing carbons. Besides, these precursors employed in preparing nanostructured carbons can themselves be conveniently tailored by variation of the monomers employed or adjustment of polymerization protocols, which allows one to control both chemical compositions and structures of final carbons at the molecular level (Scheme 1).

This review focuses on the newly emerging open frameworks, MOFs and POFs, as templates and/or precursors to prepare porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials, e.g., metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids. We aim to present the progress of investigation, discussion and challenges to applications of porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials derived from the newly emerging open frameworks in the fields of gas adsorption and storage, Li(S/O2)-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, catalysis, and so on. We sincerely hope that this will inspire the interest of readers in using these new open framework materials as templates and/or precursors for synthesis of carbons and related materials with high-performance for energy storage and conversion, who are advised to further read the cited articles and reviews.
2. MOFs as templates/precursors
The MOF scaffolds are composed of metal ions and organic units, which can be transformed to carbons, nanostructured metals/metal oxides or their hybrid materials under thermolysis conditions. The formation of various materials depends on the synthesis conditions, such as gas atmosphere, temperature, post-treatment, and so on. For example, the direct carbonization of MOFs in an inert atmosphere (N2, Ar) usually leads to metal/carbon hybrids. The pursuit of highly porous carbon materials needs to further remove the metal species that exist in the carbons. If the carbonization occurs in an air or oxygen atmosphere, nanostructured metal oxides will be the main products due to the oxidation of carbon species to form carbon oxides at high temperatures. Nevertheless, each kind of the materials derived from MOFs shows promising applications in various areas.
2.1 From MOFs to porous carbons
Recently, the use of MOFs as templates and/or precursors to create nanoporous carbon materials has been quickly developed.59,68 Owing to large surface areas and pore volumes of MOFs, such porous frameworks are promising candidates for preparing carbon materials with high surface areas. Usually, there are two methods to fabricate the porous carbon materials from MOFs. One is using MOF as a sacrificial template and precursor with incorporation of an additional carbon source; some organic compounds such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) or glucose are usually employed in this case by impregnation into the pore space first and subsequent polymerization inside the pore space of the MOFs. The thermolysis of the MOFs with loading of the additional carbon source leads to the generation of porous carbon materials. Another way to prepare the nanostructured carbon materials is through direct carbonization of MOFs since such scaffolds contain abundant organic species that could be used as carbon precursors. Both the two methods have their advantages in purpose to prepare carbons with desired nanostructures and functions. In this section, the use of some prototypical MOFs, such as MOF-5 and its derivative IRMOF series,30 ZIF-8 and its derivative IRZIF series83–85 as well as Al-PCPs (ref. 86) will be described in detail since extensive work has been done based on the use of these MOFs as templates and/or precursors to prepare highly porous carbons with broad applications in gas storage, electrochemical capacitor, fuel cell, sensor and catalysis.
Besides, some other MOFs explored as templates and/or precursors to prepare carbon are also included in this section.

2.1.1 Carbons derived from MOF-5 (IRMOF-1) and IRMOFs. 
In 2008, we, for the first time, reported the use of MOF-5 as a sacrificial template and precursor with FA as the additional carbon source to get carbon materials.68 During the carbonization process, the MOF-5 framework decomposed, behaving as a self-sacrificial template and precursor and resulting in the formation of the nanoporous carbon (NPC) with a large pore volume and high specific surface area (Fig. 1). The resultant carbon materials obtained at 1000 °C exhibit a BET surface area as high as 2872 m2 g−1. Such highly porous carbons exhibited high H2 uptake, which reached 2.6 wt% at 77 K and 1 bar, much higher than the H2 uptake (1.3 wt%) by MOF-5 under the same condition. Moreover, the as-synthesized NPC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as an electrode material for electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) (electrolyte, 1.0 M H2SO4). It exhibited a capacitance of 204 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1, which is higher than that of carbon materials synthesized from SBA-15. The specific capacitance was maintained as high as 258 F g−1 even at a current density of 50 mA g−1. Thus, the nanoporous carbon materials from MOFs have excellent electrochemical properties as electrode materials for EDLC. After that, a systematic investigation of the temperature influence on the pore structures of carbon materials was explored.87 The FA carbon precursor was introduced by the incipient wetness technique instead of vapour deposition. The MOF-5 with incorporation of FA carbon source was calcined at different temperatures from 530 to 1000 °C. The corresponding surface areas were in the range of 1141 to 3040 m2 g−1 and the dependence of BET surface areas on carbonization temperatures showed a “V” shape. All the five NPC samples had a pore size distribution centered at about 3.9 nm. As electrode materials for supercapacitors, the NPC samples obtained at the temperatures higher than 600 °C displayed the ideal capacitor behaviours and gave rise to almost constant specific capacitance (above 100 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1) at various sweep rates, which is associated with their mesoporous characteristics. Hu and co-workers detailedly investigated the thermal decomposition mechanism of MOF-5.88 The decomposition of MOF-5, which could take place at 400 °C or above, produced CO2, benzene, and amorphous carbon besides crystal ZnO. Moreover, the ZnO was covered by amorphous carbon, resulting in the C/ZnO nanoparticles of about 10 nm. Removing ZnO with HCl led to generation of mesoporous carbon materials with a surface area of 1844 m2 g−1. The authors have proposed a mechanism that the decomposition is based on breaking carboxylic bridges between benzene rings and Zn4O clusters.

In 2010, Hu et al. firstly employed the direct thermolysis method to prepare porous carbon with MOF-5 as a carbon precursor.89 Moreover, the introduction of additional carbon sources such as phenolic resin, carbon tetrachloride and ethylenediamine gave two other kinds of carbons. The carbon materials were further activated by potassium hydroxide (KOH). The electrochemical capacitance behavior of these carbon materials were investigated in both aqueous and organic electrolytes. Among the three kinds of carbon materials, the MAC-A (obtained from MOF-5 with carbon tetrachloride and ethylenediamine as the additional carbon sources. ‘A’ means that the obtained carbons are further activated by KOH) exhibited the best capacitances of 271 and 156 F g−1 (at a current density of 250 mA g−1) as well as the highest energy densities on a gravimetric basis of 9.4 and 31.2 W h kg−1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively.
Recently, Zhan and co-workers reported the synthesis of 3D hierarchically porous carbons from pyrolysis of MOF-5 using glucose as the additional carbon source.90 The morphologies and pore characteristics of the products can be adjusted by changing the reaction time. The generated 3D hierarchically porous carbon-based electrode exhibited good supercapacitor behavior with the specific capacitance of 175 F g−1 at a current density of 0.6 A g−1 in a NEt4BF4-PC electrolyte. Furthermore, it exhibited high capacitance retention, since only 5.8% of the initial capacitance (from 175 to 165 F g−1) was lost when the current density was increased from 0.6 to 12 A g−1, suggesting an excellent EDLC performance with a high rate capability. Another example of construction of hierarchically porous carbons using MOF-5 as a precursor with glycerol as an additional carbon source was reported by Yuan and co-workers.91,92 The pore surface areas as well as pore size distributions could be tuned by adding different amounts of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in MOF-5 synthesis process prior to carbonization. The more Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in the precursor, the larger surface area of carbon could be achieved. Moreover, these HPC materials show electrochemical properties with the specific capacitances from 185 to 241 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in aqueous solution of 6 mol L−1 KOH.
Srinivas et al. used the hydrothermally synthesized MOF-5 as a precursor to prepare the hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) with very promising application in CO2 capture at room temperature.93 For a comparison, other two MOFs, namely, MOF-74 and MIL-53, were calcined under the same conditions. The obtained carbon materials were denoted as HPC-5-X, HPC-74-X and HPC-53-X (X is the pyrolysis temperature), respectively. Importantly, the authors have found that the increase of size of the MOF-5 precursor could effectively enhance the pore surface area of the resultant carbon material. The direct carbonization of the millimetre-sized MOFs yield HPCs with a simultaneously high surface area up to 2734 m2 g−1 and an exceptionally high total pore volume up to 5.53 cm3 g−1. Such simultaneously enhanced surface area and pore volume are attributed to their large, millimetre-sized crystallites of the MOF precursor, which leaves more void space due to the extended pores within the crystals after carbonization, compared with the smaller micrometre-sized MOF-5. As for MOF-74 and MIL-53 derived HPCs, the surface areas are in the range of 1260–1900 m2 g−1 with calcination temperatures from 600 to 1000 °C. These results suggest that the design and development of desirable HPCs are not straightforward. Careful selection of a MOF structure and the process conditions play critical roles in obtaining the desirable porosities in the carbons. These MOF derived carbon materials were further used for CO2 capture at room temperature. Notably, the millimetre-sized MOF-5-derived carbon materials (HPC5b2-1100) exhibited superior CO2 capability at room temperature (27 °C) with the amount of 27.4 mmol g−1 at 30 bar (Fig. 2), which is one of the highest values reported in the literature for porous carbons. The room temperature CO2 uptakes in the HPCs at 30 bar show a more or less linear relationship with their BET surface area: a CO2 uptake of 10 mmol g−1 for every 1000 m2 g−1 of surface area. This work enlightens that MOF-derived hierarchically porous carbons should be promising candidates for development of high-capacity carbon-based sorbents for effective precombustion CO2 capture and energy storage applications.

IRMOFs, as the derivatives of MOF-5 (IRMOF-1), were explored as templates and precursors to prepare porous carbons. Yang et al. using IRMOF-1, IRMOF-3, IRMOF-8 as precursors prepared a series of hierarchically porous structures after pyrolysis at 900 °C in an inert atmosphere.94 These carbon materials possessed high surface areas ranging from 1678 to 3174 m2 g−1 and hierarchical ultramicro-/micro-/meso-/macro porosity. It is noteworthy that such MOF-derived hierarchically porous carbon materials possess high hydrogen storage capacity than those of MOF precursors. One of the materials MDC-1 (derived from IRMOF-1) exhibited 3.25 wt% H2 uptake at 77 K and 1 bar and 0.94 wt% H2 uptake at 298 K and 100 bar, which surpassed the properties of all known physisorptive materials.
Recently, the explorations of MOF-derived carbons in lithium–sulphur (Li–S) battery applications have become a newly emerging area. The Li–S battery has a high theoretical capacity of 1657 mA h g−1 of elemental sulphur and a high nominal theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg−1 of cell weight, which make it a very promising candidate in future battery applications. Xu et al. encapsulated sulphur (S) into hierarchically porous carbon nanoplates (HPCN) derived from one-step pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks (MOF-5).95 HPCN with an average thickness of ca. 50 nm exhibited a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous nanostructure with high specific surface area (1645 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (1.18 cm3 g−1). The resultant HPCN–S composite possessed a high specific capacity with an initial discharge capacity of 1177 mA h g−1 (current rate: 0.1 C). It could deliver a discharge capacity of 730 mA h g−1 after the 50th cycle and the columbic efficiency was up to 97%. Such enhanced electrochemical performance of HPCN–S is related to the hierarchically porous plate nanostructure, which not only provides stable electronic and ionic transfer channels, but also plays a key role in confining the polysulfides and accommodating volume variation during the charge–discharge process.
Cheetham, Kumar and co-workers utilized carbonized MOFs for sulphur loading to fabricate cathode structures for lithium–sulphur batteries (Fig. 3).96 Four types of zinc-containing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), namely, RT-MOF-5 (MOF-5 is synthesized at room temperature), Solvo-MOF-5 (MOF-5 is synthesized under solvothermal conditions), ZIF-8 and Zn-fumarate, were directly carbonized in the inert atmosphere and gave rise to carbon materials with different hierarchical pore structures. As for ZIF-8 derived carbons, the microporous architecture with a moderate surface area of 969 m2 g−1 and a small pore volume of 0.4 cm3 g−1 was obtained. For other MOF-derived carbons, the hierarchical pores with large surface areas ranging from 1945 to 4793 m2 g−1 and pore volumes ranging from 1.26 to 3.99 cm3 g−1 were achieved. The impact of pore volume and pore size distribution of the carbonized MOFs loaded with sulphur on the capacity and the cycle life of Li–S batteries were illustrated by the authors. Cell cathodes containing porous carbons from carbonized ZIF-8 and solvo-MOF-5 achieve stable capacities at 332.3 and 219.2 mA h g−1 over 40 cycles. The presence of large macropores in carbonized solvo-MOF-5 is responsible for the loss of capacity with cycling. Because most of the pores are made up of micropores with negligible macropores, carbonized RT-MOF-5 based cathodes have shown excellent cycle stability, achieving 592.1 mA h g−1 over 40 cycles. As for Zn-fumarate derived carbon, the very large surface area and high concentrations of micropore and mesopore make this carbon cathode exhibit the highest initial capacity of 1471.8 mA h g−1. Over the first 40 cycles, the capacity is still impressive at 662.3 mA h g−1.

The introduction of the hybrid MOF composite as a template and a precursor to prepare hybrid carbons was reported by Zhang and co-workers.97 The multi-walled carbon nanotube@MOF-5 hybrid (MWCNT@MOF-5) was prepared under the hydrothermal condition. Then it was carbonized at 900 °C to generate the MWCNT@Meso-C hybrid carbon material. The active sulphur was encapsulated into the MWCNT@Meso-C matrix for a high performance lithium–sulphur battery. The discharge capacity of the MWCNT@Meso-C/S sulphur cathode is 1343 mA h g−1 for the initial cycle and a high reversible capacity of 540 mA h g−1 is retained after 50 cycles. In contrast, the discharge capacity of MWCNT@MOF-5/S sulphur cathode is 874 mA h g−1 for the initial cycle and decreases to 272 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.
“Carbonaceous grease”, which is more hydrostable than MOFs, can be incorporated into such frameworks to help stabilize them against hydrolysis. Recently, Park and co-workers found that a simple heat treatment of MOF-5 at a specific temperature (550 °C) covered the frameworks in an amorphous carbon coating, which shielded the direct exposure of MOFs to moisture, thereby preventing hydrolysis.98 The thermally modified MOFs retained their crystal structures and pore characteristics, even after 14 days of exposure to ambient air. Such scalable and environmentally friendly modification methods provide new opportunities for the commercial preparation of water-resistant MOFs.


2.1.2 Carbons derived from ZIF-8 and IRZIFs. 
ZIF-8 and IRZIFs as other types of templates and/or precursors were extensively investigated in last two years. Compared with MOF-5 or IRMOF precursors, the organic scaffolds with incorporation of an additional element N in ZIFs could effectively functionalize the resultant carbon structures, which are beneficial to the improvement of catalysis, electrochemistry and adsorption performance. In 2011, we firstly used ZIF-8 as both a precursor and a template and furfuryl alcohol (FA) as the second carbon source to prepare the nanoporous carbon material.99 Through changing the calcination temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, the surface areas of resultant carbon materials can be simply tuned from 2169 to 3405 m2 g−1. For a comparison, the direct carbonization of ZIF-8 at 1000 °C led to the porous carbon material with a surface area as high as 3184 m2 g−1. The highly porous carbon materials exhibited hydrogen storage capacities (1 atm and 77 K) of 2.23 and 2.77 wt% for C800 and C1000, respectively, which are much higher than most of MOF precursors. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements showed that both carbon-based electrodes displayed regular rectangular shapes without any redox peaks. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements revealed the specific capacitance of ∼200 F g−1 for both carbons at a current density of 50 mA g−1 (Fig. 4).

Almasoudi et al. employed the chemical activation method to improve the pore surface areas of ZIF-8 derived porous carbons.100 The carbonization of commercial ZIF-8 using furfuryl alcohol (FA) as the additional carbon source between 900 and 1100 °C gives the resultant carbons with BET surface areas ranging from 900 to 1100 m2 g−1. Chemical activation (carbon/KOH weight ratio is 1:4) of the ZIF-templated carbons increases their porosity by between 30 and 240% depending on their carbonization temperature. A sample carbonized at 900 °C has the highest increase of porosity of 240% with the surface area increasing to ca. 3200 m2 g−1 and the pore volume to 1.94 cm3 g−1. The activation process results in an increase in hydrogen uptake capacity (Fig. 5). Such an increase is closely related to rises in the micropore surface area and micropore volume. In 2012, Yamauchi, Ariga and co-workers reported the direct carbonization of commercially available ZIF-8 without additional carbon sources.101 Adjusting pyrolysis temperature gave carbon materials (Z800-1000) with different BET surface areas ranging from 520 to 1100 m2 g−1. The highest capacitance was achieved at 130 F g−1 at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 for Z-800. As a further work on ZIF-8-derived carbons, they developed a facile route for the preparation of monodispersed ZIF-8 crystals with controlled particle sizes ranging from the nanometer scale to the micrometer scale under various conditions.102 The obtained ZIF-8 crystals were further converted into nanoporous carbons through direct carbonization at 1000 °C, retaining their original shapes and sizes. Benefiting from the nanoporous structure, the surface areas of these nanoporous carbon particles were extremely high. All the surface areas exceeded 1000 m2 g−1. Such preliminary research reveals a possibility to fabricate the nanoporous carbons with controlled particle sizes through carefully selecting the MOF precursors.

The controlled surface areas and pore sizes of carbon materials could be simply achieved by carbonization of isoreticular zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (IRZIFs). A series of carbon materials C-68, C-69 and C-70 were prepared using ZIF-68, ZIF-69 and ZIF-70 as templates and FA as the carbon source under thermolysis temperature at 1000 °C.103 Among the three carbons, the C-70 exhibited the highest BET surface area of 1510 m2 g−1, which is due to more porosity of ZIF-70 among three ZIF precursors. These carbon materials displayed promising H2 (77 K and 1 atm) and CO2 (273 K and 1 atm) uptake capacities with the highest values of 2.37 wt% and 5.45 mmol g−1, respectively. Electrical conductivity measurements based on the two-probe (copper) method revealed that C-70 exhibited the highest conductivity with a value of 0.8311 S cm−1, which is consistent with its higher surface area and pore size compared with the other two carbons. Wang et al. fabricated the highly porous carbon materials through direct carbonization (1000 °C) of IRZIFs, namely, ZIF-8, ZIF-68 and ZIF-69.104 These as-synthesized porous carbon materials were activated with fused KOH to increase their surface areas and pore volumes for use in gas storage and supercapacitors. Among the three carbon materials (CZIF8a, CZIF68a and CIF69a), CZIF8a (BET surface area: 2437 m2 g−1) exhibited the highest H2 storage capacity of 2.59 wt% at 1 atm and 77 K, whereas CZIF69a (BET surface area: 2264 m2 g−1) displayed the highest CO2 uptake of 4.76 mmol g−1 at 1 atm and 273 K. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the CZIF69a based electrode possessed the highest supercapacitor performance of 168 F g−1 at a scan speed of 5 mV s−1. Recently, ZIF-7, as another member of ZIFs, was employed as a self-sacrificed precursor with environmentally friendly glucose as an additional carbon source to produce nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Fig. 6).105 The addition of the environmentally friendly carbon source glucose not only improves the graphitization degree of samples, but also favors removal of Zn metal and zinc compound impurities from ZIF, leading to the formation of metal-free in situ nitrogen-doped porous carbons. Compared to other porous carbons, the Carbon-L (the sample was derived from glucose/ZIF-7 composites that were synthesized under liquid condition) exhibits not only much higher electrocatalytic activity, which is close to that of commercial 20% Pt/C, but also better stability and increased tolerance to the methanol crossover effects, which is superior to the 20% Pt/C catalyst. Results indicate that both high electrical conductivity and the content of pyridinic N of the prepared Carbon-L play a key role in electrocatalytic activity for ORR. Owing to the versatility of MOF structures, the MOF-derived porous carbons would significantly enrich the family of nanoporous carbons with novel structures and multifunctional properties including electrocatalysts, sensors, supercapacitors and batteries in future.

Besides the intrinsic components (element: C, N, O) in ZIFs, other external elements were introduced into ZIF precursors to functionalize the ZIF-derived porous carbon materials with improved performance by Maji, Rao and co-workers.106 The light boron element was introduced into the porous carbon materials through direct carbonization of a boron-imidazolate framework [Zn4(1,4-ndc)3(bim)2]·2H2O (bim = tetrakis(1-imidazolyl)borate, ndc = naphthalenedicarboxylate) at 450 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) measurements suggested that the composition of the borocarbonitride was BC4N. BET measurements revealed that the surface area of such a carbon material was 988 m2 g−1. Moreover, the material exhibited significant hydrogen (1.3 wt% at 1 bar and 77 K, and 3.26 wt% at 40 bar and 77 K) and CO2 (48.6 wt% at 1 bar and 195 K and 31 wt% at 30 bar and 273 K) uptake capabilities. Such a high affinity for H2 and CO2 is ascribed to the heterogeneous surface structure with the polar B–C and C–N bonds and NH2 functional groups, which provide effective interactions with H2 and CO2 molecules. Recently, Wu et al. employed the ZIF-8-derived carbon host to incorporate sulphur into Li–S batteries.107 The correct sulphur content and the preparation procedure are critical to embed all of the sulphur into the micropores of the MPCPs and to achieve strong binding between sulphur and the carbon host. Importantly, the composite with sulphur exclusively embedded in micropores exhibits a stable cycling performance with high coulombic efficiency in both DOL–DME and EC–DEC electrolytes, whereas the composite with additional sulphur outside the micropores shows inferior performance as well as different electrolyte compatibility. This work provides some guidance for further studies on the development of cathode materials for Li–S batteries.
The use of ZIF-derived carbons for electrochemical detection was developed by Chen and co-workers.108 Through direct carbonization of lab-synthesized ZIF-8 nanopolyhedra, the nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanopolyhedra (N–PCNPs) with uniform morphology, high surface area (2221 m2 g−1) and narrow pore-size distributions (3.7 nm) was obtained. Such N–PCNPs were used to modify a glassy carbon electrode to electrochemically detect ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). Compared with the bare GC electrode and the reduced graphene oxide modified glassy carbon (rGO/GC) electrode, such a N–PCNPs modified GC electrode was found to perform better efficiency toward electrocatalytic oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA), which exhibited the well-resolved oxidation peaks with the peak potentials at −40 mV, 188 mV and 312 mV, respectively. Moreover, the N–PCNPs/GC electrode could be simultaneously used for sensing three analytes with the detection limits (S/N = 3) of 740 nM, 11 nM and 21 nM for AA, DA and UA, respectively.
Very recently, we have developed a unique strategy to prepare the hierarchically porous carbons from ZIF-8 nanoparticles109 with micro-, meso- and macropores.109a The meso-/macropores have been successfully induced as additional second-order structures by the assembly of microporous ZIF-8 particles in nanometric sizes formed by ultrasonication during the synthesis. Simple carbonization of the resulting ZIF-8 framework with both micro- (1–2 nm) and mesopores (5–40 nm), followed by KOH activation, affords carbon with well-interconnected 3D hierarchically porous frameworks (AS-ZC-800) with micro- (1–4 nm), meso- (5–50 nm) and macropores (50–100 nm). N2 adsorption measurements revealed that the AS-ZC-800 possessed a BET specific surface area of 2972 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 2.56 cm3 g−1. Remarkably, the AS-ZC-800 carbon exhibits extremely excellent performance as a supercapacitor electrode. The specific capacitance in 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte is 211 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1, which slightly decreases to 187 F g−1 at 400 mV s−1. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements revealed that the specific capacitances are 251 and 204 F g−1 at the current densities of 0.250 and 50 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, AS-ZC-800 exhibits very high cycling stability at a current density as high as 5 A g−1 (Fig. 7). For a comparison, the carbon materials synthesized from other types of ZIF-8 precursors without 3D hierarchical pore structures exhibit poorer supercapacitive performance.

2.1.3 Al-MOF-derived carbons. 
Al-MOF is another promising template/precursor to construct the nanostructured carbon material. In 2011, Yamauchi and co-workers used {Al(OH)(1,4-NDC)·2H2O}n (ref. 86) as a host with impregnation of dicyandiamide (DCDA) to prepare nanoporous nitride fibers at a calcination temperature of 600 °C.110 In the same year, this group used the same MOF as a template/precursor with FA as an additional carbon source to produce microporous carbon fibers.111 After carbonization at 1000 °C in the inert atmosphere, γ-alumina nanoparticles (from 2 to 10 nm) are distributed over the entire area of the carbon. Through chemical treatment with HF, the γ-alumina nanoparticles can be easily removed to produce pure microporous carbon. An increase in the BET surface area upon increasing the loading amount of FA is observed. The maximum surface area and pore volume of the obtained microporous carbon reach 513 m2 g−1 and 0.84 cm3 g−1, respectively. In 2012, this Al-PCP precursor was directly carbonized in an inert atmosphere from 500 to 800 °C.112 Surprisingly, the nanoporous carbon (NPC) treated at 800 °C showed a very high surface area (5500 m2 g−1) and a large pore volume (4.4 cm3 g−1) (Fig. 8). Furthermore, its sensing capability for toxic aromatic substances using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technique was examined. The PCP-800 exhibited large adsorption uptakes for benzene vapors and showed a fast response to benzene vapors with the frequency immediately changed (Δf = 392 Hz) after a few seconds. However, such carbon-based QCM sensors exhibited small adsorption uptakes for cyclohexane and hexane vapors. Their frequency shifts (Δf) were 141 Hz (for cyclohexane) and 130 Hz (for hexane), respectively. Such results demonstrated its highly selective affinity for detection of aromatic substances. The graphitic carbon containing sp2-hybridized carbons has a higher affinity for aromatic hydrocarbons than for their aliphatic analogues. The extremely high surface area and pore volume of obtained carbons suggest that the Al-MOF is a very promising template/precursor for preparing NPCs with advanced functions.

Recently, such Al-PCP-derived hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) (PCP-800) was explored as a matrix of sulphur for lithium–sulphur (Li–S) batteries.113 A mixture of the HPC and commercial sulphur powder at different heat-treatment temperatures resulted in HPC–S composites containing 58, 50, 39 wt% sulphur, which were denoted as HPC–58S, HPC–50S and HPC–39S, respectively. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the initial discharge capacity for the HPC–39S composite was as high as 1774 mA h g−1, whereas for HPC–58S and HPC–50S, the values were 1224 and 1466 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity of the HPC–58S composite decreases to 456 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles while those of the HPC–39S and HPC–50S composites remain 690 mA h g−1 and 524 mA h g−1, respectively, after 50 cycles. As a comparison, the MIL-100 (Cr)/S composites with 48 wt% sulphur showed a discharge capacity of only 200 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The improved capacity retention is ascribed to the hierarchical pore structure as well as the strong interaction between the HPC matrix and the loaded sulphur.
In addition to crystalline Al-PCP precursors, other phases of MOFs such as Al-based metal–organic gels (MOGs) were also explored as precursors to prepare highly porous carbon monoliths. Mixing aluminium nitrate and 1,3,5-benzentricarboxylic acid in ethanol solution under hydrothermal conditions gave light yellow wet gels.114 The as-synthesized gels were dried in air or by supercritical CO2, resulting in xerogels (MOXs) and aerogels (MOAs), respectively. PXRD analysis revealed a close relationship to the MIL-100(Al)115 crystal that bears the zeolite MTN topology with two types of cages. The direct carbonization of MOAs gave the carbon material MOA-C with a high surface area (1820 m2 g−1) and a very large pore volume (3.22 cm3 g−1). The pyrolysis of MOXs followed by KOH activation led to the carbon material MOX-C containing a surface area of 3770 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 2.62 cm3 g−1. Both H2 uptake capacities of the carbon samples are higher than the gel precursors. As expected, the MOX-C sample, with the highest surface area and developed micro-porosity, exhibited the highest hydrogen storage capacity of 2.98 wt% H2 at 77 K and 1 bar. Owing to the hierarchical pore structure, the MOA-C displayed better performance as a cathode material for lithium–sulphur (Li–S) batteries.


2.1.4 Carbons derived from other MOFs. 
Besides several extensively investigated prototypical MOF precursors, other MOFs have also been explored as templates and/or precursors to prepare carbon materials. In 2008, Chen et al. reported the large-scale fabrication of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) through one-step direct thermolysis of a metal–organic framework [Ni3(btc)2·12H2O] (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylato) precursor under the protection of an inert gas.116 The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image showed that the as-synthesized CNTs had diameters ranging from 30 to 60 nm and lengths of up to several micrometers (Fig. 9). The thermolysis temperature and reaction time play important roles in the formation of MCNTs. The high temperature (500 °C) and the long heating process (20 h) are essential for the formation of pure CNTs. A possible mechanism for the growth of MCNTs is composed of decomposition, reduction, nucleation and growth. The Ni particles, reduced by the formed carbon and decomposed gas, act as catalysts for the formation of CNTs. This work is the first example of using MOF as the precursor to prepare the CNTs. Compared with reported methods for the synthesis of CNTs, this synthetic route is a simple, controllable and low-cost method to achieve the target.

In 2010, Zhou and co-workers prepared two mesoporous carbons (MgC and BaC) by simple pyrolysis of commercial magnesium or barium citrate.117 The resultant materials with the BET surface areas were BaC, 955 m2 g−1 and MgC, 2322 m2 g−1. The electrochemical test on these two carbon based electrodes displayed the specific capacitances of 180 F g−1 (MgC) and 171 F g−1 (BaC) at a current density of 500 mA g−1 in an ionic liquid (EMImBF = 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) electrolyte (Table 1).

Recently, the use of Fe-based MOFs as precursors has attracted much attention due to the catalytic effect of the Fe element in the carbonization process, which might lead to resultant carbon materials containing intriguing morphologies. In 2011, Youn et al. demonstrated the use of a MOF as a combined catalyst and carbon source for preparing CNTs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.118 A commercially available Fe–BTC (BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) was pyrolyzed under the conditions of Ar:H2 = 14:5 at 700 °C at an Ar flow rate of 100 ml min−1, leading to MWCNTs. They found that MWCNTs in higher yields were produced in the presence of C2H2 as a carbon source at 700 °C. The MOF precursor is composed of high concentrations of finely dispersed Fe clusters that play a key role in CNTs synthesis under relatively mild conditions. Li, Yang and co-workers reported the fabrication of mesoporous graphitic carbon nanodisks with hierarchical structures by direct carbonization of Fe-based CPs (CP-FeSO4 and CP-FeCl2) in a N2 atmosphere.119 The obtained carbon materials (C–Sx and C–Clx, x is the pyrolysis temperature) exhibited mesoporous graphitic nanodisk morphologies with high surface areas and high graphitic degree. The iron species in CPs could act as “built-in” catalysts to catalyze the carbonization for enhancing the graphitic degree of the carbon materials. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the specific capacitance per unit BET surface area (Cs) for four carbon (C-S700, C-S900, C-Cl700 and C-Cl900) materials were in the range of 0.22–0.38 F m−2, which are larger than those of the traditional porous carbon materials with values in the order of 0.1–0.2 F m−2. This work indicates that high specific surface area and high degree of graphitization are of great importance to improve the electrochemical capacitive performances of carbon materials.
Although many research studies on carbonization of MOF precursors have been done in last five years, the effect of different MOF precursors on the resultant porous carbon materials is still underestimated. Recently, Kim and co-workers have found that there is a relationship between the components of precursors and surface areas of resultant carbons.120 High-temperature thermal decomposition of various well-known zinc-containing MOFs gives a series of porous carbon materials. The pore volumes varied in the range of 0.56–2.42 cm3 g−1, while the specific surface areas are between 990 and 1820 m2 g−1 (Table 2). Importantly, it has been revealed that the surface area of carbon materials linearly increases with increasing Zn/C ratio of MOF precursors as seen in Fig. 10. The effect of ligand nature on the resulting carbon porosity has been further systematically studied using the MOFs synthesized from rigid and flexible ligands.121 Aiyappa et al. have claimed that such linear relationship rules are only suitable in the case of MOFs with rigid ligands [i.e., benzene derivatives like 1,4-BDC (1,4-terephthalic acid), 1,3,5-BTC (1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid), and 2,6-NDC (2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid)]. However, the MOFs containing flexible ligands like 1,3-ADA (1,3-adamantanediacetic acid) and 1,4-PAA (1,4-phenylenediacetic acid) result in low surface areas of carbons and henceforth fail to fall in the linear plot. These important findings may allow a precise control of the porosity of the carbon material in a predictable manner by simply selecting the starting MOFs with suitable ligands and Zn/C ratios.

2.1.5 Conclusions. 
MOFs are emerging as very promising templates and/or precursors to prepare highly porous carbons owing to their diverse structures, high surface areas, large pore volumes as well as abundant organic species. The highly porous characteristics make the resultant carbons very attractive applications in energy and environmental fields. Although more and more research work on MOF-derived carbons is reported currently, there are still great challenges in this area. (1) The development of an effective way to control the ordered pore structure of this class of carbons is one of the most important issues. For example, hierarchical pore structures with on-demand mesopore-connected micropores and/or macropores are important for the diffusion or selectivity of molecules and ions in fuel cells and catalysis fields. (2) How to effectively introduce hetero-atoms to change the electronic/chemical properties of carbons should be more focused on. (3) Since numerous MOFs are reported every year, the investigations of newly synthesized MOFs to explore more intriguing properties are expected. (4) Large-scale synthesis methods need to be further developed since sometimes the MOF-derived carbons may lose some surface areas when enlarging the synthesis scale. Such drawbacks are detrimental for practical applications. Now, MOF-derived porous carbons are still in their infant stage, and the advantage of using MOF precursors is still on exploration. More intriguing results in this area could be expected in near future.

2.2 From MOFs to nanostructured metal oxides
Over the past few years, the synthesis, characterization and application of nanostructured metal-based materials have been the subject of extensive research. Numerous methods have been developed to prepare these materials with various sizes, shapes and morphologies. Since MOF scaffolds contain abundant metal ions, it is an alternative to use MOFs as templates and precursors to get nanostructured metal-based materials under suitable calcination conditions. A rich variety of metal ions that are used in MOFs provides abundant opportunities to prepare different kinds of nanostructured metal-based materials from MOFs. Usually, MOFs could be used as templates and precursors to prepare metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides as well as other nanostructured metal-based materials. The morphologies of MOF precursors have great influence on resultant nanomaterials. A comprehensive review focused on preparing nanomaterials from MOFs with varied morphologies and structures was published in 2012.122 In this section, we will only focus on recent MOF-derived metal oxides, and most importantly, their potential applications in energy and environmental fields.

2.2.1 MOF-derived transition metal oxides. 
2.2.1.1 MOF-derived cobalt oxides. 
Co3O4, an important p-type semiconductor, has been widely applied in lithium-ion batteries, heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemical capacitor devices and other areas. Especially, the nanoscaled Co3O4 materials are attractive because their novel nanostructures may lead to enhanced chemical–physical properties for many applications.
In 2010, we, for the first time, developed a MOF route for synthesizing agglomerated Co3O4 nanoparticles.123 A cobalt-MOF {Co3(2,6-NDC)3(DMF)4}n precursor was directly calcined at 600 °C in air, leading to the agglomerated Co3O4 nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼250 nm, consisting of smaller nanoparticles with a size of about 25 nm (Fig. 11). An electrode was composed of mixing 85 wt% Co3O4 nanoparticles, 5 wt% carbon black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), exhibiting a reversible capacity of 965 mA h g−1 after the 50th cycle. Such high electrochemical performance is attributed to the agglomerated nanocrystalline Co3O4, whose unique primary–secondary agglomerated structure favors the enhanced capacity, improved rate capability and prolonged cycle life as an electrode material for lithium ion batteries. This work indicates that facile preparation of Co3O4 from the MOF template is a promising way to get a nanostructured electrode material for high performance of LIBs. Li et al. then prepared the porous Co3O4 nanowires through pyrolysis of cobalt-based coordination polymer nanowires that were assembled by nitrilotriacetic acid and the cobalt salt.124 The coordination polymer nanowires were converted into porous Co3O4 nanowires, which completely preserved the nanowire-like morphology. The specific BET surface area was about 26 m2 g−1. The Co3O4 nanowire-based anode displayed a high initial capacity of 1366 mA h g−1 at a current density of 300 mA g−1. Such a value is much larger than the theoretical total capacity of bulk Co3O4 (892 mA h g−1). The extra capacity is probably attributed to the formation of the surface polymeric layer due to the decomposition of the solvent in the electrolyte that caused the irreversible capacity loss. Moreover, such porous Co3O4 nanowires exhibited a high reversible capacity of 810 mA h g−1 and stable cyclic retention at the 30th cycle. It is believed that the one-dimension porous nanostructures of Co3O4 nanowires, consisting of the small nanoparticles with sizes of about several nanometers, are responsible for the high electrochemical performance. In 2012, the dendrite-like nanostructured Co3O4, made up of many nanorods with diameters of 15–20 nm and lengths of 2–3 μm, has been successfully prepared by calcining the corresponding nanostructured Co-8-hydroxyquinoline coordination precursor in air.125 The Co3O4 nanostructure was evaluated as an electrochemical sensor for H2O2 detection and the results reveal that it has good linear dependence and high sensitivity to H2O2 concentrations changing from 0 to 1.7 mM. Furthermore, such a material could be used as the electrode and the CO oxidation catalyst. The specific capacitance at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 is 207.8 F g−1 (electrolyte: 3 M KOH). The CO oxidation experiment has shown that the Co3O4 nanostructure can catalyze the oxidization of nearly 100% of CO to CO2 at 100 °C, and 50% at about 50 °C, which is much more efficient than that of commercial Co3O4 (it can show 100% and 50% conversions at 175 °C and 140 °C, respectively). After that work, the authors used another one dimensional (1D) cobalt acetate hydroxide {Co5(OH)2(CH3COO)8·2H2O}n prism as a precursor to prepare Co3O4.126 The resultant cobalt oxide keeps the outside configuration of the 1D cobalt acetate hydroxide but turns to be a box with a hollow structure inside through the Kirkendall effect. Such cobalt oxide was tested as the supercapacitor electrode. The CV curves (3% KOH electrolyte) are nearly symmetrical and display two pairs of redox peaks at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. Such broad redox reaction peaks which come from the redox processes of Co3O4/CoOOH/CoO2, are characteristic of the electrochemical pseudocapacitors from reversible faradaic redox reactions occurring within the electro-active materials. Galvanostatic charge–discharging curves have revealed that the specific capacitance is 278 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Moreover, it exhibits a good cyclicity at 2 A g−1.

Very recently, Meng et al. reported the fabrication of porous Co3O4 materials through two-step thermolysis of a Co-MOF {[Co3(abtc)3(bpy)1.5(H2O)3](H2O)2}n (H3ABTC = azobenzene-3,5,4′-tricarboxylic acid, bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine) precursor.127 The as-made Co3O4 displays crystalline and well-defined porous feature (BET surface area: 47.12 m2 g−1) and can be applied as a supercapacitor electrode. The electrochemical results have shown that the porous Co3O4 particles exhibit a high specific capacitance of 150 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte and retain slightly enhanced capacitance after 3400 cycles, which could be ascribed to its higher specific surface area and accessible channel structural features.
2.2.1.2 MOF-derived iron oxides. 
Fe-based oxides are promising materials for their diverse applications including lithium-ion batteries, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement, targeted drug delivery, bio-separation as well as catalysis.
The first preparation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles from MOF precursors was done by Zboril and co-workers in 2004.128 Prussian blue (PB), Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3, as a precursor was directly calcinated at low temperature (250 °C) to give the amorphous Fe2O3 nanoparticles with the sizes ranging from 1 to 4 nm and large specific surface areas of 200–400 m2 g−1. The sizes of PB precursors could effectively influence the specific surface areas of amorphous Fe2O3. A double increase in particle dimensions resulted in approximately a 2-fold decrease in the specific surface areas of particles. At 350 °C, the cubic β-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 polymorphs were identified and their contents were found to be strongly dependent on the initial PB particle sizes and oxidation–diffusion conditions. Generally, the higher relative content of γ-Fe2O3 was obtained from larger PB particles under air-limited conditions.
In 2011, Oh and co-workers reported that the rod-shaped Fe-MIL-88B ({Fe3O(H2O)2Cl(BDC)3·nH2O}n, H2BDC = terephthalic acid)129 can be used as a precursor to synthesize the iron oxide nanorod.130 The calcination of CPP-15 at 380 °C in air using a conventional furnace resulted in the formation of the hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanorod. However, when changing the synthesis condition with the two-step calcination approach (first heated at 300 °C in air, then further caclinated at 700 °C in N2), the magnetite (Fe3O4) could be obtained. Magnetic measurements revealed that these two phases of iron oxides exhibited distinctly different magnetic responses. These results suggest a new strategy for the production of iron oxide that has a well-defined morphology and composition. Recently, such a method has been developed by Cho and co-workers to prepare the spindle-like porous α-Fe2O3.131 The MOF precursor MIL-88-Fe was firstly heated at 500 °C in N2 gas to obtain the black FeOx–C composite, then calcined at 380 °C in air to get the final product of dark red α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 12). The carbon residue could be totally removed in this process. The resultant spindle-like porous α-Fe2O3, consisting of clustered Fe2O3 nanoparticles with sizes of <20 nm, showed the dimensions of length and width of 0.8 and 0.4 mm, respectively. Moreover, the material contained porous character with a BET surface area of 75 m2 g−1. This material was mixed with 10 wt% Ketjenblack and 10 wt% PVDF to form an electrode, which showed a capacity of 911 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C. Even at a rate of 10 C, a comparable capacity of 424 mA h g−1 could be reached. Such outstanding property could be attributed to the interconnected nanometer-sized subunits of the material. The smaller sizes of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles shorten the distance for transportation of Li ions, which is critical to the rate capability. Recently, Zhang et al. have reported that the Fe2O3 microboxes with hierarchically structured shells could be simply synthesized by annealing Prussian blue (PB) microcubes.132 The Fe2O3 microboxes were formed by thermally induced oxidative decomposition of PB microcubes at 350 °C. When the annealing temperature was increased to 550 °C, the porous Fe2O3 microboxes composed of enlarged Fe2O3 nanoparticles were obtained. A complex hierarchical structure consisting of sheet-like Fe2O3 subunits were observed at an annealing temperature of 650 °C. PXRD suggested that the whole thermal transformation process is characterized by two major phases: thermally induced oxidative decomposition of the PB microcubes and further crystal growth of Fe2O3. The former creates the hollow structure of the Fe2O3 microcubes, while the latter leads to the formation of different shell architectures. The hierarchical Fe2O3 microbox-based anode materials obtained at 650 °C displayed the highest reversible capacity of 945 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1. Such remarkable lithium storage properties are due to the unique hollow and porous shell architecture, which facilitates the penetration of the electrolyte and the transport of Li+ ions in the electrode and could efficiently buffer the stress caused by volume variation during the charge–discharge process. Very recently, The same group have found that porous Fe2O3 nanocubes composed of fine Fe2O3 nanoparticles (BET surface area: 44 m2 g−1) could also be obtained at a high calcination temperature, which display a high lithium storage capacity of 800 mA h g−1 after the 50th cycle at a current density of 200 mA g−1.133

The nanoporous iron oxides with hollow interiors could be successfully prepared by calcination of PB nanoparticles with well-defined hollow interiors as starting precursors.134 The hollow cavity sizes in the starting PB nanocubes were a very critical factor to achieve crystalline phase control of the obtained iron oxides. Generally, the calcination of small hollow PB nanocubes (SHPB) at a low temperature (250 °C) led to an amorphous and γ-Fe2O3 mixture. Increasing the temperature to 400 °C yielded an α- and γ-Fe2O3 mixture. However, using large hollow PB nanocubes (LHPB) as precursors, the pure phases of γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 were obtained after calcining at 250 and 400 °C, respectively. As for a comparison, thermolysis of a non-hollow PB precursor always gave amorphous Fe2O3. The obtained hollow iron oxides show very high surface areas because of their nanoporous shells. Moreover, the nanoporous hollow γ-Fe2O3 particles with well-developed crystallinity possess high saturation magnetization (Ms) of 51 and 59 emu g−1 at room temperature and 10 K, respectively. Such characteristics make them very promising candidates for future biomedical applications.
Besides the excellent potential application in electrodes of LIBs as well as magnetic resonance and therapy, the suitable band gaps for efficient absorption in the solar spectrum (e.g., Fe2O3) make it a good candidate in photocatalytic applications. Recently, Lin and co-workers have developed a novel MOF (MIL-101-Fe (ref. 135))-templated approach to synthesize a mixed metal oxide nanocomposite material by first creating core–shell particles, then calcining to decompose the core.136 This facile method produces crystalline octahedral nanoshells composed of hematite Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded in anatase TiO2 with some Fe doping. For the purpose of using as a photocatalyst, such composite materials were further deposited by a little amount of Pt nanoparticles and were tested by measuring photo-induced hydrogen production from water (Scheme 2). With triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial reducing agent, such a composite material possessed high photoactivity for water splitting under continued irradiation with a Xe-lamp. The amount of H2 produced increases linearly during this entire time period, with a total of 30.0 μmol H2 per mg of the material produced after 48 h. Moreover, this composite material can be recovered from a reaction mixture and reused with a fresh solution.

2.2.1.3 MOF-derived copper oxides. 
The CuO materials have engendered extensive attention due to their wide utilization in heterogeneous catalysts, gas sensors, superconductor industry, optical switching devices, and so on. Recently, it is reported that CuO can also be applied to construct solar cells and lithium ion batteries. Compared with bulk materials, the nanostructured CuO materials might exhibit some special physical and chemical properties.
The first example of using a MOF precursor to synthesize CuO was reported by Thakuria et al. in 2007. {Cu(Bic)2}n (Bic− = N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycinate) was directly thermalized at 500 °C for 6 h, resulting in the formation of black CuO (tenorite) microplates.137 In 2009, Chen et al. prepared the CuO microstructure through the two-step calcination of a MOF precursor [Cu3(btc)2] (btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate).138 In 2011, the same MOF was used as a precursor to produce spongy CuO. The resultant material with an average diameter of 10–20 μm consists of nanosheets with average edge lengths in the range of 80–200 nm and thickness of about 30 nm.139
Two coordination polymers, 2-dimensional butterfly-like Cu(C6H4NO2)2(H2O)4 nanosheets and one-dimensional (1D) [Cu(C6H4NO2)(OH)]H2O nanorods (C6H5NO2 = isonicotinic acid), were used as precursors to prepare CuO nanostructures.140 After heat treatment, hierarchical CuO butterfly-sheet-like nanostructures and CuO nanotubes were obtained, which basically preserved the morphologies of the precursors. The photocatalytic and antibacterial studies indicate that the as-obtained CuO samples have great photocatalytic activities for the degradation of Rhodamine B and good bacteriostatic activities. Electrochemical measurements show that the initial discharge capacities of CuO nanosheets and 1D nanotubes are 813 and 933 mA h g−1, respectively. The discharge capacities could basically return to the initial values of 555 and 688 mA h g−1, respectively, after 30 cycles. The results demonstrate that the obtained CuO samples have very stable cyclic performances and the discharge capacities of the CuO samples would be affected by the morphologies of the samples.
The CuO/Cu2O hollow polyhedra with porous shells were fabricated by thermal decomposition of coordination compound [Cu3(btc)2]n polyhedra at 350 °C.141 When tested as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, they exhibited a reversible lithium storage capacity as high as 740 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 250 cycles even if the charge–discharge process was stopped for one week during the test time. In addition, the porous CuO hollow architectures with perfect octahedral morphology are synthesized simply by annealing Cu-based metal–organic framework (MOF) templates.142 Such a CuO octahedron electrode exhibits an initial discharge specific capacity of 1208 mA h g−1 and a reversible capacity of ∼470 mA h g−1 can still be retained at the end of 100 charge–discharge cycles. Another example of synthesis of the CuO nanostructure through a Cu-based MOF (MOF-199) precursor was reported recently.143 The reversible capacity of ∼538 mA h g−1 (∼1.6 mol of Li) was obtained by the conversion reaction. The Li/CuO half-cell retained ∼90% of the initial reversible capacity after 40 galvanostatic cycles and was capable of delivering the capacity of ∼210 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1.
MOF-derived CuO nanostructures could also be used as catalysts. A series of CuO/CeO2 catalysts with well-dispersed copper species were synthesized through calcining MOF-199 containing Ce3+ ions at different temperatures.144 CO oxidation reaction revealed that the catalyst (5%-CuO/CeO2-600) obtained at 600 °C showed the best activity with a complete CO conversion at low temperature. Zamaro et al. used the same MOF precursor to fabricate the CuO/CeO2 nanoparticles.145 These nanoparticles present a very high activity in CO oxidation. Furthermore, it has been shown that this synthesis route employing MOF as a matrix is useful to immobilize CuO–Ce2O nanoparticles in a monolithic reactor, while keeping a high catalytic activity.
2.2.1.4 Other transition metal oxides derived from MOFs. 
Besides above-mentioned extensively investigated metal oxides, some other transition metal oxides that are derived from MOF precursors have also been explored in recent years. In 2003, Xiong et al. prepared the γ-MnO2 nanowire from a MOF precursor [{Mn(SO4)(4,4′-bpy)(H2O)2}n] during a process of oxidization.146 The product consists of nanowires with diameters of 20 ± 40 nm on average and lengths ranging from 3 ± 6 μm. The authors have proposed that the different coordination abilities of ligands would lead to distinct oxidation speeds, and thus a possible faster oxidation along a certain direction, which resulted in oriented growth of metal oxide nanowires. Changing to another precursor [{Mn(N3)2(4,4′-bpy)}n] under the same synthesis condition cannot give γ-MnO2 nanowires. In 2013, Peng et al. proposed a facile route for the formation of large-pore mesoporous Mn3O4via the conversion of the Mn-MOF fabricated in ionic liquid (IL)–water mixtures.147 The hydrophobic IL can self-assemble to form aggregates in water, which work as templates for the pores formation of MOF. Moreover, the morphologies and pore characteristics of Mn3O4 could be tuned by changing different ILs in the MOF synthesis process. The IL with a longer alkyl chain of cation favors the formation of Mn3O4 crystals with large pores. Catalysis tests have shown that these mesoporous Mn3O4 display high activity for methylene blue (MB) degradation. The Mn3O4 with higher porosity and smaller crystal size is more active for the MB degradation.
The mesoporous nickel oxide with a porous structure exhibiting a bimodal pore size distribution (2.6 and 30.3 nm) has been synthesized from a MOF precursor Ni3(btc)2·12H2O (btc = 1,3,5-benzenrtricarboxylic acid).148 The nanostructured NiO displayed flowerlike regular morphology that is similar to the precursor. Such a material was further used as an electrode for the supercapacitor. CV curves of the as-synthesised NiO in 3 wt% aqueous KOH showed a typical pseudo-capacitive behaviour. The specific capacitance (Cs) decreased from 94 to 71 F g−1 as the scanning speed increased from 5 to 200 mV s−1. Charge and discharge measurements revealed that the Cs was 112 F g−1 at a current density of 2.0 A g−1. A decrease of 8% of the initial Cs was obtained after 1000 cycles. Another example of using the same MOF precursor to prepare the NiO catalyst was reported by Sun and co-workers.149 Thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate reveals that the NiO catalyst obtained from the MOF precursor can decrease the two-step decomposition temperatures from 323.5 to 294.0 °C and from 424.6 to 364.5 °C. Such catalytic activity is better than that of commercial NiO powder, which decreases the two-step decomposition temperatures from 323.5 to 307.8 °C and from 424.6 to 386.8 °C.
Lu and co-workers presented a surface coating reinforced framework strategy for the preparation of ordered microporous solids via the nanocasting method using Cr-MIL-101 (ref. 150) as the template.151 Before impregnation of carbon precursors (resol resins), the internal and external surfaces of Cr-MIL-101 were functionalized with aminosilanes coordinated to unsaturated chromium sites to reinforce the MOFs during the carbonization process. They have found that the low degrees of loading and aminosilane functionalization are crucial for the replication of Cr-MIL-101.
Very recently, the use of MOF as a template to prepare the porous titania has been reported by Kondo, Mallouk and co-workers (Fig. 13).152 For replication of the metal oxides from MOF templates, the Ti(O-iPr)4 precursor was firstly loaded into the evacuated HKUST-1.153 After removing the extra Ti(O-iPr)4 and drying the composite in a vacuum, the sample was further placed in an ethanol–water mixture and treated in a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave for 20 h at 200 °C. The outer MOF template was etched by 1 M HCl and 5 wt% H2O2 solution. SEM images have shown that the HKUST-1/titania composite particles after hydrothermal treatment still retain the square bipyramidal shape of the HKUST-1 crystals. Even after removing the MOF template, some titania particles still retain square bipyramidal shapes of the HKUST-1 crystals, which demonstrate that the MOF plays a role of a template like silica. The porous particles have micropores (BET surface area: 270 m2 g−1) that were derived from the MOF template. However, the broad distribution of mesopores was also found in this material. Such a phenomenon arose from incomplete filling of the pores of the template by Ti(O-iPr)4. Although the complete replication from the MOF template didn't achieve in this example, the pioneering work enlightens a new insight of using MOFs as the templates to construct the ordered porous metal oxides in future.

2.2.2 MOF-derived main group metal oxides. 
2.2.2.1 MOF-derived zinc oxides. 
ZnO is an important semiconductor material with a wide direct energy band gap of 3.37 eV and a large excitonic binding energy of 60 meV. Such characteristics make it a good candidate for application in optoelectronics, sensors, catalysis, and so on.
In 2005, Li et al. used two different Zn-based MOFs to prepare the nanostructured ZnO.154 The thermolysis of a 1D zigzag chain-like coordination polymer [Zn(4,4-bipy)Cl2] led to the ZnO nanorods, while changing to another precursor [Zn(ox)(4,4-bipy)] containing a 2D framework gave the radial nanoneedle-like ZnO. They proposed that such selective formation of distinct morphology resulted from the synergistic effect of the coordination polymers and ZnO growth habits. These two kinds of ZnO display different luminescent properties. Upon excitation at 325 nm, both two samples exhibited dual emission behaviors with the main peaks centered at 440 and 520 nm, respectively. However, the green emission of the nanorods is stronger than the radial nanoneedles, which is attributed to the existence of more oxygen vacancies in the nanorods. The use of a 2D MOF precursor Zn(tda)H2O [tda = S(CH2COO)22−] could also produce nanoporous ZnO with a BET surface area of 39.8 m2 g−1.155 In 2009, we found that upon calcination of MOF-5 with platinum tetrachloride impregnated, the platinum-supporting ZnO with an average size of 30 nm was obtained. Such a material exhibited a higher activity for CO oxidation than the conventional Pt/ZnO catalyst.156 Oh and co-workers have taken the established principle of the coordination-polymer template-directed approach one step further and reported the synthesis of micrometer-sized ZnO hexagonal rings.157,158 The hexagonal-ring-like zinc-metalated salen complex assembled by N,N′-phenylenebis(salicylideneimine)dicarboxylic acid, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and Zn(Ac)2 was used as a precursor. The overall size of the hexagonal-ring ZnO was reduced to approximately 1.16 μm from that of the precursor hexagonal-ring CPP (ca. 2.34 μm) (Scheme 3). In 2010, Sun and co-workers investigated the temperature effect on the morphologies of ZnO nanostructures from MOF precursors.159 Calcination of MOF precursor [ZnL]n (H2L = 4-[(1H-imidazol-4-yl)methylamino]benzoic acid) at 500 °C leads to the formation of small spherical ZnO particles. When increasing the temperature to 600 °C, the majority of small spherical shape converts into the polyhedron, and the trend increases in the formation of rod-like morphology. More and more uniform ZnO nanorods appeared by increasing the reaction temperature to 700 °C. The ZnO formed under lower pyrolysis temperature possessed higher photocatalytic activity toward degradation of Rhodamine B.

In 2011, Lu et al. used two different MOF precursors to prepare the ZnO materials with sphere-like particles (ZnO-1) and plate-like particles (ZnO-3).160 Surface wettability measurements showed that both the ZnO-1 and ZnO-3 exhibited the superhydrophobicity with the contact angle (CA) values of 159.2° and 152.2°, respectively. The ZnO-1 had a higher catalytic activity than ZnO-3 for photodegradation of RhB. Ligand-free ZnO nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 100 nm were simply synthesized by solid-state transformation of Zn(II)–organic infinite coordination polymer particles (Zn/2-aminoterephthalic acid/acetylenedicarboxylic acid) at 550 °C.161 The obtained ZnO-1 exhibited strong visible emission centered at 600 nm. Changing the composition of the coordination polymer to Zn/2-aminoterephthalic acid/2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid generated the ZnO-2 with strong visible emission centered at 500 nm. The present work provides a facile approach to synthesize stable ZnO nanoparticles with strong and tunable visible emission by using MOF precursors. Rod-shaped, hexagonal column-shaped, and elliptical aggregation of ZnO were obtained by one-step solid state thermolysis of two Zn-based homochiral metal–organic frameworks.162 These ZnO microparticles showed permanent porosity and displayed visible light emission centered at 605 or 510 nm.
Recently, Yang, Li and co-workers reported the fabrication of metal oxides with controlled morphology and crystal planes by using coordination-polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) as precursors based on template-engaged-quasi-topotactic transformation by an “escape-by-crafty-scheme” strategy (Fig. 14).163 They have found that the Zn–ptcda (ptcda = perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride) precursors with various morphologies (nanoplate, nanoparticle, nanorod) could be inherited by the resultant metal-oxide nanostructures. Solid 1H NMR revealed the formation of perylene by decarboxylation of ptcda after calcination. Meanwhile, the crystal-plane orientation of the CPNs can also be maintained in the final ZnO nanoparticles. A possible mechanism of such a transformation process was proposed by the authors. During the pyrolysis process, the small ZnO crystalline domains formed by decomposition of Zn–ptcda-1 crystallize out as nuclei and grow up into ZnO crystallites through Oswald ripening. The nucleation and growth of ZnO primary particles uniformly occur in the whole Zn–ptcda precursor, and thus the ZnO particles are able to keep the original morphology of the precursor. Importantly, such methods can be extended to get other metal oxides such as Mn3O4 and Co3O4, and even metal sulfides. These results demonstrate that it is a general method for the synthesis of the nanomaterials with desired structures and morphologies. In fact, some other reported results also follow this rule. For example, the octahedral morphology of a Zn-based coordination polymer (Zn/NH2–BDC/BTB) (H2NH2–BDC = 2-aminoterephthalic acid, H3BTB = 4,4′,4′′-benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tribenzoatehe) could be well inherited by the resultant ZnO, which exhibited strong visible emission centered at 575 nm (excitation at 325 nm).164

Another example of using MOF-5 as a self-template for producing porous cube-shaped ZnO particles was reported by Fujihara and co-workers.165 It is the key to control the microstructure of MOF cuboids for the use as an intermediate compound for ZnO. The pyrolysis of the MOF microstructure obtained from N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution gave the cube-shaped ZnO particles with many cracks, while changing to the MOF-5 precursor grown from N,N-diethylformamide (DEF) solution generated the crack-free sample that can well keep the cubic shape. The authors proposed that mesocrystal-like MOF cuboids grown in DEF solution could maintain their shape during the pyrolysis mainly due to the relaxation against a MOF-to-ZnO volume change. The resultant porous cubic ZnO particles exhibited intense visible photoluminescence upon irradiation with ultraviolet light.
2.2.2.2 Other main group metal oxides derived from MOFs. 
He et al. reported the fabrication of mesoporous alumina by thermolysis of a Al-based coordination polymer (MIL-53(Al)) at 650 °C.166 The Al2O3 contained ordered porous arrangements with narrow pore size distributions (4–15 nm) and large surface areas (198 m2 g−1). Moreover, a strong visible emission around 500 nm that was associated with the F+ center could be observed in this mesoporous alumina. Changing to another Al-MOF ([Al8(OH)15(H2O)3(btc)3]n MIL-110) as a precursor could give micro/nanostructured Al2O3 depending on the calcination conditions.167
In2O3 could also be prepared via direct calcination of MOF precursors. In 2009, Oh and co-workers reported In2O3 with controlled morphologies obtained from calcination of coordination polymer precursors.168 When the porous coordination polymer particles (CPP-3,169 [In(OH)(BDC)]n H2BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) were calcined at 550 °C for 45 min using a conventional furnace, the non-hollow In2O3 particles maintaining the original morphology of the precursor CPP-3 with hexagonal rod- and disk-shapes were obtained. Calcining another precursor (CPP-6)170 at 700 °C for 45 min gave rise to the elongated hexagon-, ellipsoid-, and rod-shaped hollow In2O3. This work has established that the composition and porosity of the precursor CPPs affect the resulting In2O3 structure. Recently, the structure-controlled hollow In2O3 was synthesized by directly calcining the In–BDC (H2BDC = terephthalic acid) complex.171 It is demonstrated that the addition of NaOAc plays an important role in determining the nanostructure of In2O3. The hollow structure can be formed at a NaOAc concentration lower than 1 M.
Besides, some other metal oxides, such as PbO, CdO, Bi2O3, and so on with various morphologies could also be prepared from corresponding MOF precursors.122 However, the properties of these metal oxides need to be further explored in future.


2.2.3 MOF-derived lanthanide oxides. 
In addition to the extensive research on the transition or main group metal oxides, lanthanide oxides, another important family of metal oxides, could also be prepared from lanthanide MOF precursors. These materials show wide applications owing to their unique luminescent, catalytic, electrical, and magnetic properties.
In 2009, Liu et al. prepared the shape-preserved Eu2O3 nanorod through calcination of a {Eu2(BTC)3·6H2O}n precursor.172 The material with diameters of 80–100 nm and lengths of 1–2 μm showed strong red luminescence with the peak centered at 610 nm. Compared with the MOF precursor, the surface of Eu2O3 nanorods became rough due to the release of CO2 gas generated in the process of decarboxylation in air. The retention of rod-like morphology of the as-grown crystals during the solid-state transformation suggests a potential approach for fabricating 1D inorganic nanomaterials from metal–organic precursors.
Through pyrolysis of monolithic macroporous foams of lanthanide–organic framework precursors, a series of lanthanide oxides (La2O3, CeO2, Pr6O11, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3) with hierarchically meso-macroporous or macroporous monolithic foams were obtained.173 Owing to the influence of metal ions, the resultant materials exhibited different morphologies. For La2O3 and CeO2 foams, the macropore walls were composed of single crystal flakes and aggregations of nano-crystals, respectively. For Pr6O11 foam, the macropore wall with a meshwork of crystal Pr6O11 nanorod was observed. As for the foams of Sm2O3 and Eu2O3, only irregular macropores with different sizes were obtained. Another example of using Ln–asparagine with controlled morphologies as precursors to fabricate the lanthanide oxides were reported by the same authors.174 The calcination of La–asparagine gave La2O3 microhollow spheres with a wall thickness of ∼100 nm. The thermolysis of the Ce–asparagine precursor led to CeO2 core–shell microspheres. Moreover, it could be extended to prepare microspheres of other lanthanide oxides such as Pr6O11, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3 through calcinations of corresponding lanthanide–asparagine precursors.
In 2011, Park et al. reported a unique strategy to synthesize the hollow lanthanide oxides through calcining the MOF–SiO2 nanocomposite precursor.175 Carboxylate-terminated silica particles were mixed with Gd(NO)3 and H2IPA (isophthalic acid) in DMF and heated at 140 °C for 20 min to give silica@coordination polymer composites. Such hybrid materials were further calcined at 600 °C for 60 min to generate silica@Gd2O3 composites, and then the silica was removed by 10% HF etching, generating the hollow Gd2O3 microspheres. The thicknesses of hollow metal oxides can be easily tuned by modifying the thickness of the coordination polymer shell. Such a method could also be extended to other lanthanide oxides such as Eu2O3 and Y2O3 (Fig. 15).

2.2.4 MOF-derived mixed metal oxides. 
Besides single-metal oxides, mixed-metal oxides could also be synthesized from MOF precursors. The combination of two or more metal components would synergistically work with each other, which might generate more intriguing properties. Perovskite-type oxides, LnMO3 (Ln = lanthanide metal, M = transition metal), comprising f-transition and d-transition metal ions, have been one of the most attractive and interesting mixed metal oxides for technological applications as functional materials in fields of fuel cells, gas sensors and catalysts. In 2007, Mahata et al. prepared GdCoO3 nanoparticles by calcining a mixed-metal organic framework precursor [Gd(H2O)3Co{C5N1H3(COO)2}3]176 at pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 400 to 800 °C. The nanoparticles exhibited various sizes of 3, 12, and 200 nm. The photocatalytic test suggests that the degradation of organic dyes, phenol, and substituted-phenols appears to be faster in the presence of 3 nm GdCoO3 compared to the P-25 Degussa TiO2 catalyst. The reduced formation of unwanted intermediates in the presence of GdCoO3 indicates that this material would prove to be a good photocatalyst in environmental photocatalysis. The use of La[Fe(CN)6]·nH2O as a precursor to fabricate LaFeO3 was successfully carried out at 1273 K.177 The resultant materials possessed highly porous characteristics with ordered pores of 100–200 nm in diameter.
In 2011, Courtel et al. reported the fabrication of AMn2O4 (A = Co, Ni, Zn) series through directly calcining the precursors generated from oxalic acid, transition metal acetate and manganese(II) acetate.178 Further studies on the effect of different sintering temperatures (from 400 to 1000 °C) on particle size were performed. The size of the particles had a significant effect on the performance of the batteries. Among all the samples, the ZnMn2O4 powder sintered at 800 °C (<150 nm) gave the best battery performance with a discharge capacity of 690 mA h g−1 at C/10, along with good rate capability and excellent capacity retention (88%). A two-step process to prepare MMn2O4 (M = Zn, Co, Ni) with flower-like morphology was developed by Yang, Li and co-workers.179,180 The mixed-metal MOFs were firstly prepared through hydrothermal reaction of two kinds of metal acetates, NaOH and ptcda (perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylicdianhydride) and then calcined at 450 °C in air. ZnMn2O4 was used as the electrode for Li ion batteries, which showed the overall capacities for the first discharge and charge as high as 1277 and 730 mA h g−1, respectively, an irreversible capacity of 547 mA h g−1, and a retained capacity of 502 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles, which might be caused by the unique architecture of assemblies of nanoplates consisting of well-crystallized agglomerated nanoparticles.
The NiCo–NTA (NTA = nitrilotriacetic acid) was used as a precursor to prepare NiCo2O4.181 The as-prepared nickel cobaltite displays nanorod-like morphology with about 1 mm length and about 100 nm diameter. Moreover, such nanostructures exhibit a high surface area of 103.4 m2 g−1, which is beneficial for the supercapacitor application. The specific capacitances are 1078 F g−1 and 704 F g−1 at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. The specific capacitance retention is 94.4% after 2500 cycles at 1 A g−1, suggesting its excellent cycling stability. The mixed-metal oxides could also be used in environmental areas. Fu et al. prepared the porous magnetic MnFe2O4 and Mn doped Fe3O4 (Mn/Fe3O4) nanowires through pyrolysis of Fe–Mn–NA (nitrilotriacetic acid) precursors with different Fe(II)/Mn(II) ratios.182 The BET surface areas of MnFe2O4 and Mn-doped Fe3O4 are 37.8 and 45.4 m2 g−1 respectively. Owing to the porous characters, these materials were further used to remove both heavy metal ions and organic pollutants from wastewater. The adsorption capacities of two materials for Congo red reached 180 mg g−1. Moreover, they exhibited high affinity for heavy metals, with which the Pb(II) and Cr(VI) uptakes are around 120–131 mg g−1 and 67.3–73.9 mg g−1, respectively.
In addition to the mixed metal–organic framework precursors, doping of external metal ions in the MOF precursors prior to calcination provides an alternative way to prepare the mixed metal oxides. For example, La–Ce oxide, Eu3+/Tb3+ doped La2O3 as well as some transition metals (Co3+ and Ni2+) doped CeO2 microspheres could be obtained from corresponding metal-doped lanthanide–organic compound microspheres.183 Another example of Ti-doped Prussian blue (PB) analogue K0.25Ti-[Fe0.875(CN)6]·6H2O was used as a precursor to prepare TiO2–Fe2O3 cubes.184 Oh and co-workers formulated a methodology to prepare the hybrid metal oxide particles with tunable compositions.185 The colloidal coordination polymer particles (CPPs) M–MSB–M (MSB = metallo Schiff base, M = transition metal) were chosen as precursors to prepare composition-tunable hybrid metal oxide particles. The thermal treatment of mono-metallic M–MSB–M (M = Zn2+ or Co2+) at 550 °C for 60 min led to the unique multi ball-in-ball MxOy (M = Zn or Co) structures. When changing the components of metal sources of CPPs from monometals to mixed bimetallic ones M′–MSB–M (M = Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+), the multi ball-in-ball hybrid metal oxides Mv′Ow/MxOy (M = Zn or Co, M′ = Cu, Co, Ni) could be obtained after thermal treatment. This work illustrates a general strategy for preparing many new composition-customized hybrid metal oxides. Recently, MIL-100-Fe with preloaded Co(NO)2·6H2O was used as a precursor to prepare CoFe2O4 nanocomposites.186 The compositions of obtained nanocomposites varied with the molar ratios of Fe/Co. Moreover, these magnetic materials exhibited high catalytic performance for oxidation degradation of phenol using potassium peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as an oxidant.


2.2.5 Conclusions. 
MOFs have proved to be suitable precursors for preparing nanostructured metal oxides. The obtained materials show promising applications in energy and environmental fields such as LIBs, capacitors, water treatment, and so on. Compared with other existing methods, the advantages of using MOF precursors could be drawn as follows: (1) the processing procedure is quite simple and low-cost, which gives it potential for large-scale fabrication; (2) the morphologies, particle sizes and components of resultant nanostructured metal oxides can be controlled due to the well-defined MOF scaffolds. Although great progress has been made in this area, some challenges still exist. For example, the precise and clear-cut mechanism of controlled morphology of nanostructured metal oxides from MOF precursors is still unclear. Future work should focus on the formation mechanism and the rules that govern the relation between influential factors and morphologies, with the purpose of designing the metal oxides with desired morphologies and dimensions. Besides, how to control the sizes of metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles from MOF precursors is still unclear. It has been shown that some intriguing nanomaterials could be prepared by direct pyrolysis of MOFs. However, the process sometimes entails complicated steps involving synthesis of MOF precursors. Facile preparation of nanomaterials is highly desired in future research. In addition, since some MOF scaffolds contain other elements such as S, I, Cl, and so on, the exploration of corresponding MOF-derived metal complexes with potential applications can be carried out. For example, MOF-derived metal sulfides with various morphologies were reported.187–189 These materials may be potentially used in photocatalysis such as photoinduced water splitting or photo-degeneration of pollutants.

2.3 From MOFs to carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids

2.3.1 MOF-derived carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids. 
The periodical arrangement of metal nodes in MOF scaffolds provides a possibility to give metal or metal oxide nanoparticles that homogeneously distribute inside the carbon matrixes under proper thermolysis conditions. Over the past few years, MOF-derived carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids have shown great potential for applications in energy and environmental areas. Liu and co-workers employed a cobalt imidazolate framework as a precursor to prepare a carbon–cobalt hybrid material.190,191 The thermolysis of the Co-ZIF precursor at 750 °C led to the hybrid material with a BET surface area of 264 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution revealed that both micropores and macropores exist in this material. Such a material was explored as a catalyst for ORR, which exhibited an onset potential of 0.83 V. The mass activity reached 0.05 A g−1 at 0.8 V or 0.6 A g−1 at 0.75 V. The electron transfer mechanism revealed a dominative four electron transfer process in this reaction. The authors proposed that the use of a ZIF precursor is a prerequisite to generate the catalyst containing densely populated active sites Co–N4 by maintaining sufficient porosity and surface area, which are essential for a non-PGM (platinum group materials) catalytic reaction. As a continuation work on the ZIF-derived carbon–metal hybrid, the non-PGM cathode electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) were prepared by pyrolyzing an iron imidazolate framework.192 The catalyst obtained at low temperature (<900 °C) demonstrated excellent activity towards ORR in the acidic medium. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature is detrimental due to the loss of N content and the specific surface area. To improve the catalytic activity at higher temperature, the catalyst was prepared by calcining mixed Fe-ZIF/ZIF-8 precursors. The membrane electrode assembly made of such a catalyst as the cathode demonstrated an onset potential of 0.977 V and a measured volumetric current density of 12 A cm−3 at 0.8 V in a single cell test. Such obvious enhancement of catalytic performance is attributed to the increase of N content as well as the specific surface area with the help of ZIF-8.
Li, Yang and co-workers have prepared the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) via the direct pyrolysis of Zn-Fe-ZIF by adjusting the amount of dicyandiamide (DCDA), which serves as the extra nitrogen supplier.193 Mechanistic studies suggest that in situ generated Fe and Fe3C catalyzed the pyrolysis of the precursor for the formation of NCNTs. DCDA favors the formation of NCNTs at relatively low temperature due to its inducing effect for the graphitic structure. The NCNTs with iron species and high amounts of graphitic N exhibited higher catalytic ORR activity than commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH solution.
Recently, the use of ZIF-8 with incorporation of iron-acetate/phenanthroline to fabricate a Fe–carbon cathode catalyst has been developed by Proietti, Jaouen and co-workers.194 In their work, the ZIF-8 served as a microporous host for phenanthroline and ferrous acetate to form a catalyst precursor that was subsequently treated by ball milling. Two-step heat treatments, first in argon at 1050 °C, and then in ammonia at 950 °C, were employed for preparing such electrocatalysts containing FeNx active sites. The cathode made with the best electrocatalyst from this work had a volumetric activity of 230 A cm−3 at 0.8 ViR-free. Such a value reached the highest record for non-PGM-based ORR catalysts in PEMFCs, which is close to the US DOE's 2015 target of 300 A cm−3. Moreover, the best catalyst-based membrane electrode produced a power density of 0.75 W cm−2 at 0.6 V in the H2–O2 system, which was comparable to that of a state-of-the-art platinum-based cathode having a load of 0.3 mgpt cm−2. The authors suggested that such high activity of the catalyst was attributed to the interconnected alveolar carbon nanostructure derived from Fe/Phen/ZIF-8, which was favorable for the enhanced mass-transport in the cathodes. In their successive work, the ferrous acetate/TPTZ/ZIF-8 (TPTZ = 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine) was used as a precursor to prepare the catalyst under similar conditions (Fig. 16).195 The activity at the iR-free cell voltage of 0.9 V (corrected for the ohmic voltage loss) was 3.5 A g−1, and the specific current at 0.6 V (uncorrected) was 190 A g−1, which were much lower than those in their previous work. Such poor performance is due to the occurrence of metal-ion exchange between ZIF-8 and Fe-complex during the wet-impregnation step. For improvement of the performance of the catalysts, a method of ball milling of FeAc2, TPTZ, and ZIF-8 to prevent metal-ion displacement between [Fe(TPTZ)2] and ZIF-8 was developed. Such a composite-derived catalyst exhibited enhanced performance of ORR with the current and power densities of 1.05 A cm−2 and 0.63 W cm−2, respectively, at 0.6 V. Such values were similar to those reported by authors for the optimized catalyst obtained from a Fe/Phen/ZIF-8 precursor.
 Fig. 16  Highly active Fe/N/C catalysts for the oxygen-reduction reaction in polymer–electrolyte-membrane (PEM) fuel cells can be obtained from a precursor constructed from the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 and an iron–ligand complex if, and only if, the displacement of ZnII ions from ZIF-8 by FeII ions is restricted (TPTZ = 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine).

The [Fe(Phen)3]2+@IRZIFs can be also used as the precursors to prepare Fe–N–C hybrid electrodes for ORR.196 Among the obtained hybrid materials, the FeNC-70 derived from [Fe(Phen)3]2+@ZIF-70 shows the highest BET surface area, 262 m2 g−1. Such an active hybrid material is highly efficient in the reduction of O2 molecules through the desired 4e− pathway. Electrochemical analysis and structural characterizations predict that the active sites for ORR are most likely to be the in situ generated N–FeN2+2/C moieties.
The cobalt porphyrin-based porous framework as a precursor to prepare cobalt–carbon hybrids was reported by Feng, Müllen and co-workers.197 The resultant nitrogen-rich porous carbons with incorporation of cobalt nanoparticles were denoted as Co-CMP-X (X is the thermolysis temperature). These materials possessed regular ribbon-like monolithic morphology with the surface areas ranging from 229 to 480 m2 g−1. Among them, Co-CMP-800 exhibited the best performance toward ORR in alkaline media, such as a more-positive half-wave potential (−0.18 V vs. AgCl/Ag), a high and stable limiting current (∼4.62 mA cm−2), and an excellent stability (∼96.7% retention after 1000 cycles).
Very recently, the cage-containing MOF-derived metal–carbon hybrid catalyst has been explored for ORR in Li–O2 batteries.198 The reaction of cobalt(II) thiocyanate with the 4′-(4-pyridyl)-4,2′:6′,4′′-terpyridine gives a cage-containing MOF structure. Dicyandiamide is loaded into the pores prior to pyrolysis. The morphologies and properties of the resulting N-Fe-MOF catalysts are found to be strongly dependent on heating temperatures. Interestingly, the N-Fe-MOF catalyst obtained at 1000 °C exhibits a graphene/graphene-tube nanohybrid morphology (Scheme 4). This catalyst displays excellent ORR activity in aqueous and nonaqueous media. Moreover, it is tested as the cathode in Li–O2 battery with electrolyte containing 1.0 mol L−1 LiPF6 in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME). In particular, the average voltage plateau of the N-Fe-MOF catalyst during discharge is 2.80 V, which is higher than those measured with the carbon black (ca. 2.51 V), the MOF-free N–Fe material (ca. 2.62 V), and the Pt/C catalyst (ca. 2.71 V). The N-Fe-MOF catalyst also displays the highest initial discharge capacity (ca. 5300 mA h gcat−1) of all the cathodes studied in this work. In addition, the cell possesses good discharge–charge cycling stability up to 16 cycles without a significant capacity loss at a current density of 400 mA gcat−1 (Fig. 17).

In addition to extensive applications in ORR, the carbon–metal hybrids can be also used in other areas such as LIBs and catalysis. In 2011, Park and co-workers prepared ZnO@C hybrids through direct carbonization of a MOF-5 precursor at 600 °C in the N2 atmosphere.199 Such a hybrid material possessed a BET surface area over 500 m2 g−1 and displayed a high photocatalytic activity for degradation of Rhodamine B under the UV light. Recently, the same group used MOF-5 as a precursor under a modified carbonization condition (pyrolysis at 550 °C in inert atmosphere) to give ZnO quantum dots (QDs)/carbon hybrid (denoted as 550N).200 The ZnO QDs (∼3.5 nm) without intrinsic defects or agglomerations were embedded in hierarchically porous carbon matrixes. Such a hybrid material was used as an anode for lithium ion batteries, which exhibited a high specific charge capacity of ∼1200 mA h g−1 at 75 mA g−1. Moreover, it displayed stable cyclability and good performance rate (Fig. 18). For comparison, the composite materials obtained under other conditions (denoted as 600N and 550N_3H) with large particle sizes and internal defects exhibited poorly electrochemical properties, which suggested that both the crystal sizes and perfectness of the ZnO particles made important contributions to the enhanced electrochemical performance.

Recently, MIL-100-Fe-derived porous carbon–metal hybrids were prepared by a microwave-enhanced high temperature ionothermal method.201 The FA was introduced as an additional carbon source before the thermolysis. A series of γ-Fe2O3/C hybrids were rapidly prepared within 3 min by this method. The products exhibited high surface areas (up to 800 m2 g−1) and magnetic characteristics. One of the hybrid materials (BET surface area: 800 m2 g−1) was tested for water treatment by the adsorptive removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution. Such a magnetic carbon hybrid exhibited a high adsorption capacity (303.95 mg g−1) as well as a perfect magnetic separation performance (Ms = 4.12–19.54 emu g−1) for the MB removal from aqueous solution. Porous N-doped carbon supported palladium nanoparticles (Pd@CNT) was prepared by direct carbonization of the palladium-N-heterocyclic carbene coordination polymer (P-Pd-NHC) at 800 °C.202 Such catalysts displayed high activity and selectivity toward the domino carbonylative synthesis of pyrazole derivatives, which are even higher than that of the representative Pd2+ homogeneous catalyst PdCl2(PPh3)2 within six runs. The well-monodispersed NPs on the graphene-like carbon layer with strong metal–support interaction is responsible for such highly catalytic performance. Moreover, this one-pot methodology could be extended to the synthesis of Ni and alloy (PdxNiy) nanoparticle catalysts (Ni@CN800, PdxNiy@CN800).
Besides the direct thermolysis of the MOF precursor, preloading of the external metal-ion into the MOF scaffold prior to pyrolysis is another way for preparing metal–carbon hybrids. In 2012, Moon and co-workers reported the in situ generation of metal oxide–carbon catalyst during the CO oxidation reaction.203 The Pd nanoparticles supporting redox-active Ni-MOF (Pd@ra-MOF) was used as an active catalyst for CO oxidation. Interestingly, such a precursor can be in situ transformed into PdOx–NiOy/C during the gas phase CO oxidation reaction. Such a hybrid material exhibited sustainable and enhanced catalytic activity through the synergistic stabilization of catalytically active PdO species. Afsahi et al. used Pt-containing MOF as a precursor to prepare the Pt/C hybrid.204 The homogenously dispersed Pt nanoparticles inside carbons were obtained at different temperatures (700, 800, 950 and 1050 °C), which were designated as C1, C2, C3 and C4, respectively. The thermolysis temperatures had great impacts on the sizes of Pt nanoparticles. The minimum size (7.4 nm) was found for the sample carbonized at 800 °C (C2). At higher temperatures, the coalescence of Pt crystal domains prevailed over formation of the initial Pt nanoparticles, which led to bigger average crystal domain size. Since C3 and C4 showed pure electronic conductivities, these two samples were further tested in a fuel cell. The membrane–electrode assemblies (MEAs) made of these electrocatalysts were tested as both the anode and the cathode in a H2–air fuel cell. As the anode, the most promising electrocatalyst (C3) showed a power density of 0.58 W mgPt−1 at 0.97 V, which is comparable to the commercial electrode power (0.64 W mgPt−1) at 0.6 V in a single cell test. As for the cathode, a power density of 0.38 W mgPt−1 at 0.6 V was achieved. A similar method was used to prepare the titanium oxide–carbon hybrid through carbonization of IRMOF-3 supported titanium isopropoxide.205 The resultant material exhibited a high surface area of 1000 m2 g−1. The metal oxide nanoparticles with a small particle size (∼4 nm) were highly dispersed inside the carbon matrixes. This hybrid material is a good catalyst for the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (DBT) with kapp of 3.4 × 10−3 min−1.
A general strategy for the synthesis of highly crystalline metal and metal oxide nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix from MOFs were reported by Banerjee, Poddar and co-workers.206 A series of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles Cu/CuO, Co/Co3O4, MgO, ZnO, CdS, CdO, Mn2O3 were obtained by calcining corresponding MOF precursors. The authors have found that metal ions with a reduction potential of −0.27 volts or higher present in MOFs always form pure metal nanoparticles during thermolysis in N2, whereas metal ions with a reduction potential lower than −0.27 volts prefer to form metal oxide nanoparticles during thermolysis in N2. Moreover, the sizes and shapes of the nanoparticles can be affected by parent MOF structures. Interestingly, the crystallinity of the carbon matrix was also found to be influenced by the gas species during the thermolysis. Through comparison of the carbonization process in N2 and air using MOF-4 as a precursor, the authors revealed that the obtained carbon matrixes displayed distinct morphologies (carbon nanofibers and nanocrystalline graphites were obtained in N2 and air atmosphere, respectively). These metal/metal oxide–carbon hybrid materials exhibited moderate adsorptions for H2 with the amounts ranging from 0.58 to 0.82 wt% at 77 K and 1 bar.


2.3.2 Conclusions. 
From the above research, we can see that MOF-derived carbon–metal hybrids have attracted much attention in recent years, and more and more intriguing work enrich the rapid development of this field. Compared with other methods for loading metal or metal oxide nanoparticles into the carbons, such an in situ generation approach makes nanoparticles highly dispersed throughout the carbon spheres with less aggregation. These materials are very promising candidates for future catalysis, electrode and fuel cell applications. However, one of the current challenges is how to precisely control the particle size, content of the metal or metal oxide in the carbons. Although it has been shown that the calcination temperature would influence the sizes of metal nanoparticles in the carbon matrix,204,207 more research work needs to be explored to illustrate the governing factors in processing the hybrids, which are critical for broad application of this new method in future.

3. POFs as templates/precursors
3.1 From POFs to porous carbons
Recently, the newly emerging porous materials only composed of organic skeletons (here we call them porous organic frameworks, POFs) have also been explored as templates/precursors to prepare carbon materials owing to their highly porous characteristics with very high concentrations of organic species in the skeletons. Mullen's group has done some pioneering work in this area by directly calcining the conjugated microporous polymers to prepare porous carbons for energy storage.208,209 In 2009, they employed rigid dendritic oligophenylene 1,3,5-tris-2′-biphenylbenzene as a carbon-rich unit for the construction of conjugated polymer networks through a Hagihara–Sonogashira coupling.208 The obtained microporous polymers exhibited carbon-rich tubular and fiber-like morphology that depends on the polymerization orientation of the oligophenylene monomer. A template-free and one-step synthesis of one-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNTs) and nanotubes (CNFs) were achieved through a simple carbonization of the as-formed carbon-rich tubular and fiber-like polyphenylene precursors under an Ar atmosphere. Microporous CNTs and CNFs with a surface area up to 900 m2 g−1 were obtained. One of the materials Py-CPN3 was explored as an electrode in an EDLC, which gave the specific capacitances (1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte) of 115, 109, and 103 F g−1 at sweep rates of 1, 5, and 10 mV s−1, respectively. In the same year, they used alkyl-substituted hyperbranched polyphenylene as a precursor to prepare 1D mesoporous nanocarbons (MPNCs-X, X is the calcination temperature) at different temperatures.209 Among them, MPNCs-800 exhibited the highest surface area of 1140 m2 g−1. Such carbon-based electrodes in an EDLC gave the specific capacitances (1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte) of 304, 285, 270, 267 and 243 F g−1 at sweep rates of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mV s−1, respectively (Fig. 19). Moreover, MPNCs-800 showed the best cycling stability with a high capacitance value of 298 F g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5 mV s−1.

PAF-1 (PAF = porous aromatic framework) is a member of the POF family.210 It was synthesized through a nickel(0)-catalyzed Yamamoto-type Ullmann cross-coupling and exhibited a long range ordered structure with a BET surface area of 5640 m2 g−1. In 2011, Ben et al. firstly employed PAF-1 as a precursor to fabricate a series of carbonaceous materials at different temperatures.211 The carbonized PAF-1-s (s is the calcination temperature) exhibited a continuous shrinkage of the pore size and surface area with increase in the thermolysis temperature. Compared with original PAF-1 (BET surface area: 5500 m2 g−1), the surface areas were 4033, 2881, 2292 and 1191 m2 g−1 for PAF-1-350, -380, -400 and -450, respectively. The corresponding pore size distribution shrunk from 1.44 nm of PAF-1 to 1.00 nm of PAF-1-450. Interestingly, such a shrinkage favors CO2 capture. Among the carbonized PAF-1-s, the PAF-1-450 exhibited the highest CO2 uptake of 100 cm3 g−1 at 273 K and 1 bar (the corresponding value for PAF-1 is 46 cm3 g−1). Such enhancement is attributed to the increase of QstCO2 (from 15.6 kJ mol−1 of PAF-1 to 27.8 kJ mol−1 of PAF-1-450) after carbonization. Besides, all the carbonized PAF-1-s exhibited enhanced uptakes of CH4 (from 18 cm3 g−1 of PAF-1 to 31.6 cm3 g−1 of PAF-1-450) and H2 (from 186.0 cm3 g−1 of PAF-1 to 223.0 cm3 g−1 of PAF-1-380). Moreover, the selective affinity for CO2 adsorption of PAF-1-450 was predicted by means of an ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) with Sads values for CO2/N2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/H2 of 209, 9.8 and 392, respectively, at 1 bar and 273 K (Fig. 20). In addition, the physicochemical stability was greatly improved after the carbonization process. PAF-1-450 could be stable up to 471 °C. Moreover, it is insoluble in common organic solvents such as alkanes, alcohols, acetone and DMF. Even after boiling in water and 1 M HCl for 7 days, almost no porosity decrease was observed for PAF-1-450. As a further work on carbonization of PAF-1,212 the authors used a high-temperature KOH activation method to produce the special bimodal microporous carbons (K-PAF-1-X, X is the thermolysis temperature) with high surface areas. Compared with the low-temperature carbonized PAF-1-X series, these high-temperature KOH activated carbons exhibited enhanced gas uptakes. Among them, K-PAF-1-600 showed the highest CO2 uptake capacity of 161 cm3 g−1 at 273 K and 1 bar (equivalent to 24.0 wt%, 7.2 mmol g−1). K-PAF-1-750 exhibited the highest hydrogen uptakes with a value of 342.2 cm3 g−1 (15.3 mmol g−1, 3.06 wt%) at 77 K and 1 bar. Furthermore, high-pressure gas adsorption measurements revealed that K-PAF-1-750 was able to store 1320 mg g−1 of carbon dioxide (56.9 wt%, 40 bar, RT), 207 mg g−1 of methane (17.1 wt%, 35 bar, RT) and 71.6 mg g−1 of hydrogen (6.68 wt%, 48 bar, 77 K). Besides, it also exhibited excellent methane storage ability (0.207 g g−1) at room temperature. The authors proposed that the carbon networks could be expected to create strong polarity on the surface of the frameworks, which imparts the networks with a strong affinity toward gas molecules such as hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide through their high quadrupole moments.

Ma et al. used a modified PAF-1 as the precursor to prepare the microporous carbon materials.213 They firstly post-grafted PAF-1 with sulfonic acid, and then the resultant PAF-1-SO3H was stirred in FA for two days, during which the adsorbed FA was catalyzed by the grafted sulfonic acids to polymerize within the pores of PAF-1. The obtained FA/PAF-1-SO3H composite was carbonized at 900 °C to produce PAF-1/C-900 with a BET surface area of 1174 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution decreased from 14.5 Å (PAF-1) to 5.4 Å (PAF-1/C-900). The PAF-1/C-900 showed a CO2 uptake capacity of 93 cm3 g−1 at 295 K and 1 bar.
Recently, another porous aromatic framework (PAF-6) containing 41% nitrogen in its scaffold was employed as a self-sacrificing template to prepare the porous nitrogen-rich carbon with furfuryl alcohol (FA) as a carbon precursor.214 The carbon material obtained at 1000 °C (POF-C-1000) with high N content (about 6 wt%) displayed the highest surface area of 785 m2 g−1 with a H2 uptake of 1.6 wt% (77 K, 1 bar) and a CO2 uptake of 3.5 mmol g−1 (273 K, 1 bar). The ORR test revealed that POF-C-1000 possessed a higher onset potential (by about 40 mV) than that of the commercially available Pt/C catalyst. Besides the PAF series, other POFs such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were also used as precursors for preparing carbon materials with intriguing morphologies and properties. Recently, Liu et al. reported the preparation of hollow spherical nitrogen-rich porous carbon shells through carbonization of structure-controlled porous organic frameworks (COF-LZU1)215 at high temperatures.216 The obtained carbon materials (NPC-X, X is the carbonization temperature) at different temperatures possessed the BET surface areas ranging from 357 to 525 m2 g−1. CV measurements revealed that NPC-800 showed the specific capacitances (1 M KOH) of 230 and 190 F g−1 at the current densities of 0.5 and 3 A g−1, respectively. 98% of the initial capacitance could be retained after 1500 cycles.
In addition to the carbonization of POF precursors, some carbonaceous materials have been synthesized by an ionothermal method,217 which show excellent performances as gas sorbents and electrodes in EDLCs.218–220
3.2 Conclusions
POF-derived carbons exhibit promising applications in gas capture and energy storage. Compared with other common organic precursors, the exact stoichiometric ratios and tunable structures of POFs make the architectures of resultant carbons more controllable. These advantages are beneficial for the applications in LIBs, fuel cells and sensors in future. Currently, some challenges still exist in this rapidly developing field. The shrinking phenomena are often observed during direct carbonization of POF precursors at high temperatures, which leads to the small-sized pore structures. For wide applications of POF-derived carbons, controlled pore structures, especially hierarchical pores, are highly desired. Besides, the accessible channel in such frameworks would be utilized in future research. Some hetero-atom containing precursors can be introduced into the pores prior to carbonization, and the resultant hetero-atom doped carbons may show enhanced performance in energy storage. As the synthesis of POFs is under rapid development, future work in this area will definitely contribute to the carbon family for energy and environmental applications.
4. Conclusions and perspectives
Nowadays, there is a growing concern related to the energy and environmentally sustainable development, which lies at the frontier of various disciplines of research. Among them, the exploration of porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials such as metal/metal oxide nanoparticles as well as carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids shows great potential for applications in this field. In the last few decades, the newly emerging open framework materials, including MOFs and POFs, have been rapidly developed due to their adjustable structural characteristics and highly potential applications in gas storage, catalysis, and so on. Featuring highly porous characteristics with abundant organic species/metals in such porous scaffolds, these kinds of materials are promising candidates as templates and/or precursors to give porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials under proper synthesis conditions. As described above, the rapid progress in research on open framework-derived porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials were achieved in the last few years. For porous carbons, MOFs and POFs are very promising candidates as templates and/or precursors to give the carbons with ultra high surface areas and pore volumes. However, controlled structural orders of this class of carbons are still rare and remain a great challenge. Especially, the development of effective methods to fabricate hierarchically porous carbons with on-demand size scales is quite important, since such kinds of pore structures could be extensively used in fuel cells, gas storage or catalysis, in which the different types of pores are required for ion transports/storage or molecule selectivities. For MOF-derived metal oxide nanoparticles, although great progress, especially the controlled morphology from the precursor, have been achieved, the exploration of varied morphologies of materials on the performance of fuel cells, LIBs, supercapacitors, catalysts is still desired. Future work should give more attention to this aspect. The research on MOF-derived carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids started relatively late, while many interesting results have been reported over the past few years. The use of MOFs as templates and/or precursors will lead to the metals/metal oxides homogeneously distributed in carbon matrixes. Such uniform arrangement cannot be easily achieved through a conventional post-loading method. Despite the great advantages of using such hybrid materials in fuel cells and catalysis fields, how to control the sizes/contents of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and how to enhance metal–support interactions for improving the performances are still the intractable problems.
To date, the rapid development of MOFs and POFs provides numerous templates and/or precursors to fabricate porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials, which means that there is still much space to improve the physico-chemical properties of these materials. How best to apply the existing open framework materials to get desired nanostructured materials is one of our major aims. Currently, the investigation of open frameworks as templates and/or precursors to prepare porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials for various energy and environmental applications is still in its infancy. Further efforts in this field will certainly contribute to the development and practical applications of future clean and renewable energy. It will be exciting to watch the rapid development of such new fields in the years to come.
We have tried to present an up-to-date overview of such a rapidly growing field, while the subject is so active that many papers have been contributed even during the writing of this article. Therefore, it is hard to take into account all publications in this field in limited pages. We apologize here if some significant contributions were left out.

Broader context
The increasing environmental pollution and energy shortage require the development of new sustainable and renewable energy technologies. Various materials have been optimized to increase energy storage and conversion efficiency. Among them, porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials including metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and carbon–metal/metal oxide hybrids play a critical role in developing high-performance fuel cells, Li(S/O2)-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and so on. The newly emerging open frameworks, including MOFs and POFs, are promising candidates as templates and/or precursors for preparation of porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials on the basis of their high surface areas, adjusted pore metrics, abundant metal/organic species, and so on. In this review, we present a survey on the research progress for the use of MOFs and POFs as templates and/or precursors to prepare porous carbons and related nanostructured functional materials for applications in energy and environmental areas.
