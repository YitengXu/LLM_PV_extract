However, numerous studies have demonstrated that the perovskite materials degrade rapidly under humid air and sunlight, which greatly hinders perovskite solar cells from practical application. In this paper, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are combined with the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) techniques to unveil the microscopic details of the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). DFT calculations show that bulk MAPbI3 reacts readily with water molecules to form a monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O phase. However, subsequent degradation of this monohydrate is energetically unfavorable. On the other hand, in the presence of hydroxyl or hydroxide species, we identify possible pathways that lead to the full decomposition of MAPbI3 to the experimentally-identified degradation products. Furthermore, AIMD simulations were carried out to study the dynamics of the interaction of water molecules, hydroxyl radicals and hydroxide ions with the (110) surface of MAPbI3. Hydrogen transfer (or proton transfer) between the OH (or OH−) species and the CH3NH3 cation of the MAPbI3 surface was observed within the first 1 to 2 ps. Lastly, we studied the possible infiltration of H2O molecules, OH radicals and OH− ions in the (110) surface of MAPbI3 using the CI-NEB technique. The energy barriers for the infiltration processes in the three cases were found to be comparable.
1. Introduction
Since the first pioneering work of Miyasaka and coworkers1 in 2009, metal–halide perovskite solar cells have gained great recognition as the most promising low-cost solar cell technology. The hybrid inorganic–organic perovskite materials, characterized by the chemical formula AMX3 (A = CH3NH3, (NH2)2CH, etc.; M = Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.; X = halide), have several outstanding properties, including their suitable band gaps, broad light absorption spectra, and long charge carrier diffusion lengths,2–7 which have a direct relationship with the high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the perovskite solar cells. To date, the highest reported PCE of perovskite solar cells is greater than 21%, which is close to the PCEs of crystalline silicon solar cells.8
However, despite the unprecedented growth in the photovoltaic performance, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are limited by their poor stability which remains a major obstacle to practical applications.9–16 In general, the crucial elements that affect the stability of perovskite solar cells include the following: (1) the working environment such as humid air, rain, heat and sunlight;17–21 (2) the intrinsic structural instabilities at the interface;22–24 and (3) the device architecture and electrical stress.25–27 For example, Conings et al.18 showed that air humidity is a contributing factor to the decomposition of perovskite materials. Matsumoto et al.10 also found that the rate of decomposition is accelerated with increasing humidity and light intensity. On the other hand, Yang and coworkers28 experimentally observed that hydroxyl radicals (OH) exist in MAPbI3/ZnO systems, and the OH radicals facilitates the degradation process. At almost the same time, Tsang et al.29 also reported that the hydroxide groups (OH−) in MAPbI3/ZnO nanoparticles accelerate the decomposition of the perovskite film.
To unveil the microscopic details of the degradation mechanism of perovskites in the humid air, ab initio studies have been performed to study both static and dynamical properties of water interacting with the perovskite surfaces.30–34 For example, De Angelis et al.30 performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations on MAPbI3 surfaces in contact with bulk water. They found that the MAI-terminated surface readily dissolved in the bulk water. Moreover, it was also found that it is energetically favorable for water molecules to penetrate into MAPbI3 surfaces31 and thus affecting the structural and photovoltaic properties.35,36 Despite these simulation works, the actual mechanism of the decomposition of perovskite to their degradation products in the humid air and the role of water in the process are not well-understood. In our previous work,32 we found that the presence of hydroxyl and hydroxide species facilitates the formation and desorption of CH3NH2 molecules from the perovskite surfaces which has been suggested to be an early step of perovskite degradation.37 Hydroxyl radicals and hydroxide ions can be generated at point defects, step edges as well as on pristine surfaces during photo- or electro-chemical processes on the metal oxides scaffolds like TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3.38–42 Therefore, it is of interest to further investigate the role of these species in the decomposition process of perovskite both in bulk and on the surface.
In this paper, we investigate the decomposition mechanisms of MAPbI3 and its interaction with H2O, OH and OH− species using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) and climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) techniques. After the computational methods are discussed in Section 2, we will present our results in Section 3. We first study several possible degradation reactions of bulk MAPbI3 and its hydration products in the presence of H2O molecules, OH radicals and OH− ions. Next, the dynamical properties of H2O molecules, OH radicals and OH− ions adsorbed on the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface are investigated by AIMD simulations. The (100) surface of MAPbI3 perovskite has been suggested to be more stable than other surfaces.23,43,44 However, degradation is expected to occur on surfaces with different orientations and terminations.43 De Angelis et al.45 also demonstrated that the MAPbI3 perovskites are inclined to grow in (110)-oriented films on TiO2. The degradation of the MAI-terminated (110) surface is therefore studied in this work. After the dynamics of H2O molecules, OH radicals and OH− ions adsorption are studied, the infiltration processes of H2O, OH and OH− species into the surface are examined via the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. Lastly, we conclude our work in the Section 4.
2. Computational methods
The room temperature phase of crystalline MAPbI3 perovskite is tetragonal with the lattice parameters for the bulk structure being a = b = 8.85 Å and c = 12.64 Å.46 In the study of the surface properties, a slab model of the MAPbI3 (110) surface was created by cleaving the bulk perovskite cell of 4 formula units of MAPbI3. Then this slab was multiplied to a  supercell which contains 16 formula units of MAPbI3. The slab model is similar to the one adopted in our previous work32 but with a larger surface area. Moreover, a vacuum length of 12 Å was introduced in the simulation cell which is large enough for the interactions between the periodic images to be negligible. Although the orientations of the CH3NH3+ (MA) cations are expected to be disordered at room temperature, the time-scale and the length-scale of ab initio simulations are too small to sample the random orientations. It has been shown that many properties of MAPbI3 are not sensitive to the cation orientations.47 Moreover, simulations with periodic boundary conditions using fixed MA cation orientation have been adopted in many recent theoretical studies.32,48–51
For the crystal structures of PbI2 and I2, we respectively considered the hexagonal Pm1 phase and orthorhombic Bmab phase,52 while for crystal MAI the P4/nmm phase53 was used. For PbO, we considered both α-PbO (space group: P4/nmm) and β-PbO (space group: PBCM), which were experimentally found to be the decomposition products of MAPbI3 under ambient conditions.54 We found that that β-PbO is more stable than α-PbO by 2.0 kcal mol−1 for each formula unit of PbO. Therefore, we only used β-PbO in the calculations in this work. As for the crystal structures of MAPbI3·H2O55 and (MA)4PbI6·2H2O,56–58 we used the P21/M and P21/N structure, respectively. The isolated molecular calculations on the H2O, OH, OH−, HI, and I− species were performed in the cubic simulation cell of size 15.9 × 15.9 × 15.9 Å3. Moreover, the Makov–Payne correction59 was applied to eliminate the spurious interactions between the periodic images of the charged species (e.g., OH− and I−).
The Car–Parrinello approach was adopted for the AIMD studies. The density-functional theory (DFT)60,61 and Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics62 simulations were carried out using the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.63 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional64 and the ultrasoft, scalar relativistic pseudopotentials65 were used. The van der Waals (vdw) correction of Grimme et al.66,67 was also included to account for the dispersion interactions. A plane wave basis set of 25 and 200 Ry cutoffs were employed for the wave functions and augmented charge density, respectively. We applied spin-polarized calculations for the systems involving an OH radical, while spin-unpolarized calculations were employed to treat the remaining systems. In the AIMD simulations, a fictitious electronic mass of 400 a.u. and a time step of 3 a.u. were chosen. Nose–Hoover thermostats were used for both the ions and the electrons. The average ionic temperature was kept at 320 K. In the study of the minimum energy infiltration pathway of H2O, OH and OH− into the MAPbI3 (110) surface, the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method68 implemented in the Quantum-ESPRESSO package was used. Γ-point sampling was adopted in the calculations involving the MAPbI3 (110) surface and in molecular calculations in vacuum. K-Point meshes are used for the bulk crystal calculations. The size of the k-point mesh for each crystal calculation was chosen to give negligible error as discussed in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Chemical reactions of bulk MAPbI3 with H2O, OH and OH−
3.1.1 MAPbI3 and H2O. Recently, Leguy et al.35 experimentally found that the MAPbI3 films in the presence of water vapor go through a multi-step degradation process: (1) adsorption of H2O molecules and formation of the monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O (reaction (1)); (2) conversion to dihydrate MA4PbI6·2H2O (reaction (2)); and (3) release of H2O molecules to form PbI2 (reaction (3)). On the other hand, Huang et al.54 reported that, besides PbI2, the main degradation products under ambient conditions also include PbCO3, Pb(OH)2, α-PbO and β-PbO. In order to better understand the decomposition mechanisms, we performed DFT calculations to analyze the energetics of the proposed reactions in the presence of water and the structures of the intermediates. The energies of the reactants and products were obtained from DFT structural optimization calculations at 0 K. For those compounds which are solids at room conditions (marked with a subscript (S) in the equations), the calculations were carried out in the bulk with their most stable crystal structures. For the others, isolated molecular calculations were performed. The reaction energies were the difference in the total energies between the products and the reactants form the DFT calculations (ΔE = ∑Eproduct − ∑Ereactant), and were normalized to one formula unit of MAPbI3.

(3)The optimized structures and some selected hydrogen bond lengths of the perovskite MAPbI3, monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O, and dihydrate MA4PbI6·2H2O are shown in Fig. 1. For MAPbI3, each MA cation forms three H⋯I hydrogen bonds. As shown in the figure, the selected hydrogen-bond lengths of one of the MA cations with three I− ions in the inorganic framework of PbI3− are 2.59 Å, 2.88 Å and 2.90 Å. For MAPbI3·H2O, two of the H atoms in the NH3 group of each MA cation forms two H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the water molecules and the hydrogen bond lengths are 1.81 Å. The remaining H+ ion in the NH3 group forms two H⋯I hydrogen bonds (bond lengths = 2.89 Å) with two I− ions in the inorganic framework of PbI3−. Moreover, three H⋯I hydrogen bonds (bond lengths = 2.83, 3.00, and 3.00 Å) are also formed between each H2O molecule and the inorganic framework of PbI3−. Our results show that the H2O molecules in the monohydrate compete to form hydrogen bonds with the MA cations and with the PbI3− framework. This weakens the direct interaction between the MA cations and the PbI3− framework.

Note that when creating pictures (b), (d) and (f), the crystals were rotated and supercells were constructed for better hydrogen bond visualization. 
For the dihydrate MA4PbI6·2H2O, two H⋯I hydrogen bonds (bond lengths = 2.60, and 2.63 Å) are formed between each H2O molecule and the inorganic framework of PbI64−. However, only one H⋯O hydrogen bond (CH3NH3⋯H2O) (bond lengths between 1.84 and 1.92 Å) is formed between the water and the MA cation. Besides, two H⋯I hydrogen bonds (bond lengths = 2.80, and 2.87 Å) are also formed between the two remaining H+ ions in the NH3 group and two I− ions in the inorganic framework.
Table 1 shows the energies of reactions (1) to (3). For reaction (1), the formation of monohydrate of MAPbI3·H2O is exothermic with a reaction energy of −50.2 kcal mol−1. In the presence of water vapor, H2O molecules can readily react with MAPbI3, converting it to monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O. This agrees well with the previous experiments work,21,35 which showed that in the present of H2O, the MAPbI3 perovskite films were converted to hydrated crystal phases such as the monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O.

After MAPbI3·H2O is formed, H2O molecules were suggested to be released and the monohydrate goes through phase separation into MA4PbI6·2H2O and PbI2 (reaction (2)).35 We found that this reaction is endothermic with a reaction energy of +21.6 kcal mol−1. As discussed earlier, MA4PbI6·2H2O can continue to decompose to MAI and PbI2 by further releasing water (reaction (3)). But this reaction was also found to be endothermic with a reaction energy of +25.1 kcal mol−1. Our calculations show that, in the presence of only water, it is not energetically favorable MAPbI3·H2O to further decompose to MAI and PbI2.

3.1.2 MAPbI3 and OH radials. Our previous results from DFT calculations32 also showed that the presence of an OH facilitates the formation of MA molecules in the top layer of the perovskite surface and the desorption of it. This has been suggested to be the first step of the perovskite decomposition process.37 Our previous work agreed with the experimental study28 which found that OH radicals accelerate the degradation of MAPbI3. We therefore studied here the possible degradation mechanisms of bulk MAPbI3 in the presence of OH radicals. We propose Reactions (4a) and (4b) involving OH radicals that leads to the formation of monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O. Besides monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O, reaction (4a) also gives PbO, MAI, HI and I2 as the products, and reaction (4b) gives PbI2, CH3NH2, H2O and I2 as the products. These compounds, which are not produced in reaction (1), were experimentally found to be the main products of perovskite degradation.35,37,52,54As shown in Table 2, the reaction energies for reactions (4a) and (4b) are −45.0 and −43.4 kcal mol−1, respectively. Note that in the calculation of the reaction energies of reaction (4a), we only considered β-PbO because it is more stable than α-PbO according to our calculations. Besides the fact that the reactions are exothermic, their products involve gaseous HI or CH3NH2 that will readily diffuse away upon formation, possibly driving the reactions to the right.

We propose in reaction (5) that the resulting MAPbI3·H2O can further decompose by reacting with OH radicals forming dihydrate MA4PbI6·2H2O and other products. As shown in Table 2, the reaction energy of reaction (5) is +2.1 kcal mol−1, which is much smaller than that of reaction (2) (+21.6 kcal mol−1). Finally, MA4PbI6·2H2O can further react with OH (reaction (6)) to form PbI2 and other products, and the reaction energy was found to be +5.7 kcal mol−1, also significantly smaller than that of reaction (3). Although these two reactions are slightly endothermic, the gaseous products formed will likely diffuse away and drive the reaction to the right.

3.1.3 MAPbI3 and OH− ions. In this subsection, we studied the possible degradation mechanisms of bulk MAPbI3 in the presence of OH− ions. Reactions (7a) and (7b) show two possible degradation reactions involving OH− ions. The reaction energies of reaction (7a) and (7b) were calculated to be −40.7 and −39.1 kcal mol−1, respectively. We then proposed the reaction of the resulting monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O with OH− ion that leads to the formation of products including solid MA4PbI6·2H2O and PbO (reaction (8)). As shown in Table 3, the reaction energy of reaction (8) is about +15.1 kcal mol−1, which is lower than that of reaction (2) (+21.6 kcal mol−1). Lastly, we proposed a reaction to further degrade the MA4PbI6·2H2O in the presence of OH− (reaction (9)). The reaction energy is +23.0 kcal mol−1 which is slightly smaller than that of reaction (3) (+25.1 kcal mol−1). Overall, the degradation reactions involving OH− ions were less favorable than those involving OH radicals. However, the formation of the gaseous products could favor the forward reactions.

3.2 AIMD studies of the MAPbI3 with H2O, OH and OH−
In this subsection, we discuss the AIMD study of the dynamics of the interaction of the MAPbI3 (110) surface with water, hydroxyl and hydroxide. The optimized structures of the pristine MAPbI3 (110) surface are shown in Fig. 2a and b. In this surface structure, the NH3 groups in the top-layer MA cations are pointing downward. This orientation allows the formation of more hydrogen bonds between the MA cations and the inorganic framework as discussed in our previous paper.32
 Fig. 2  (a) Top view and (b) side view of the optimized structure of the MAI-terminated (110) perovskite MAPbI3 surface. Snapshots from the AIMD simulations with the eight H2O molecules adsorbed on the MAPbI3 surface at (c) ∼0.5 ps and (d) ∼9.0 ps respectively. 
3.2.1 MAPbI3 and H2O molecules. We carried out an AIMD simulation for ∼9.0 ps with eight H2O molecules adsorbed on the perovskite surface. Fig. 2c and d show two representative snapshots of the AIMD simulation at ∼0.5 ps and ∼9.0 ps after equilibration. No proton transfer from the MA cations to the water molecules was observed during the entire AIMD run, in agreement with our previous work32 and the simulation studies of others on the similar MAI-terminated (001) surface.30,31 However, the previous AIMD study with the MAI-terminated (001) surface in contact with bulk water found that the top-layer MA cations and I− ions spontaneously dissolved in the water, and that the Pb–O covalent bonds were formed concertedly within 8.5 ps.30 These processes were not observed in our simulations and in the work by Liu and coworker31 when there was only a layer of water on the surface. This suggests that, for the MAPbI3 (110) surface, such a dissolution process only occurs with bulk liquid water but not with one layer of adsorbed water. On the other hand, in the study of the MAPbI3 (100) surface with unsaturated Pb atoms exposed to the water,69 spontaneous formation of Pb–O bonds was observed. However, no Pb–O bonds formation was observed in this work because the MA-I terminated surface has no unsaturated surface Pb atoms. These results show that the surface orientations and terminations, and the conditions at the interface are all expected to play important roles in determining the reactions and stability of the perovskite surface.
3.2.2 MAPbI3 and OH radical. To study the behavior of OH radicals on the MAPbI3 surface, we performed an AIMD simulation with one OH radical and seven H2O molecules adsorbed on the MAI-terminated MAPbI3 (110) surface. To avoid spontaneous hydrogen transfer during the equilibration stage, the bond distances of the H–O bonds in the H2O molecules and the N–H bonds in the MA cations close to OH radical were initially constrained for around ∼0.5 ps. Fig. 3a shows the snapshot of the simulation at ∼0.0 ps and Fig. 3b shows the snapshot of the simulation at ∼5 ps after equilibration. At the beginning, the OH radical was adsorbed on the surface by forming hydrogen bonds with two adjacent MA cations, while the seven H2O molecules were distributed evenly on the perovskite surface. After removing the constraints, we observe that one hydrogen atom in a MA cation is spontaneously transferred to the OH radical to form a water molecule. As discussed in our previous work,32 the transfer of a hydrogen atom to the OH would lead to the formation an unstable CH3NH2+ radical. This radical is expected to immediately draw an electron from the surface to form a CH3NH2 molecule. In this AIMD run, we also found that the resulting CH3NH2 molecule drifted away from the perovskite surface. The formation of the CH3NH2 molecule in AIMD simulation could be the precursor of the proposed reaction (4b).
 Fig. 3  (a) Snapshot from the AIMD simulation with the seven H2O molecules and one OH radical on the MAPbI3 (110) surface at 0 ps. (b) Snapshot from the AIMD simulations of the seven H2O molecules and one OH radical on the MAPbI3 (110) surface at 5 ps. (c) The N–H and O–H bond lengths between the OH radical and the MA cation as a function of time. (d) The distance (along the axis perpendicular to the surface plane) of the center of mass of the resulting CH3NH2 molecule due to hydrogen transfer relative to its location at 0 ps. 
As the simulation continues, some of the H2O molecules and the CH3NH2 molecule formed a cluster among themselves. This suggests that the physisorption of a monolayer of water on the perovskite surface may not be thermodynamically favorable. However, the AIMD simulation with only H2O on the MAPbI3 surface did not show such clustering likely due to the limited simulation time. We plotted in Fig. 3c the O–H and the N–H distances, where the H is the atom involved in hydrogen transfer. As shown in the figure, the hydrogen transfer occurs quickly within the first 1 ps. Subsequently, the O–H bond length fluctuates in the range of about 1.0–1.4 Å. Fig. 3d shows the vertical distance (along the axis perpendicular to the surface plane) of the center of mass of the resulting CH3NH2 molecule after hydrogen transfer relative to its location at 0 ps. As discussed above, the CH3NH2 molecule drifted away from the surface. With one layer of water/OH and the limited time of the simulation, the molecule did not drift far from the surface and diffused back once (∼3.7 ps). However, the drift was found to correlate well with the hydrogen transfer process.

3.2.3 MAPbI3 and OH− ion. An AIMD simulation was also performed with seven H2O molecules and one OH− ion adsorbed on the MAPbI3 (110) surface. The H–O bond distances in the H2O and the H–N bond distances in the MA cations close to the OH− ion were initially constrained for around ∼0.5 ps during equilibration. After equilibration, at 0 ps, the OH− ion was physisorbed on the perovskite surface forming two O⋯H hydrogen bonds with the MA cations as the proton donors (Fig. 4a). Meanwhile, the seven water molecules were distributed evenly on surface forming O⋯H and I⋯H hydrogen bonds. Fig. 4b shows the snapshot from the AIMD simulation at ∼5 ps and Fig. 4c shows the snapshot from AIMD simulations at ∼8.5 ps. As shown in the figures, proton transfer from a MA cation to the OH− ion was observed within the first ∼2 ps. Moreover, the CH3NH2 molecule concurrently diffused out of the perovskite surface. The formation of the CH3NH2 molecule in the AIMD simulation could be the precursor of the proposed reaction (7b). As shown in the Fig. 4c, the CH3NH2 molecule and most of the water molecules cluster together via hydrogen bonding similar to the case with an OH radical. We also plotted in Fig. 4d the O–H and the N–H distances as a function of the simulation time, where the H is the proton involved in the proton transfer. As shown in the figure, the O–H bond fluctuates in the range of about 1.0–1.4 Å after proton transfer (except for the time around 4.5 ps when the distance becomes ∼1.7 Å). Fig. 4e shows the vertical distance (along the axis perpendicular to the surface plane) of the center of mass of the resulting CH3NH2 molecule due to proton transfer relative to its location at 0 ps. The drifting of the CH3NH2 molecule from the surface occurs concurrently with the proton transfer process.

3.3 H2O, OH and OH− species infiltration into the MAPbI3 (110) surface
It was previously suggested that water molecules could readily penetrate from the surface into the perovskite bulk.31,35,36 This phenomenon of the reversible embedding process is similar to that of typical metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),70,71 which are often used for gas storage applications. Furthermore, the infiltration of H2O, OH and OH− could be the early steps of the formation of the degradation intermediates and products in the reactions discussed in Section 3.1. Therefore, it is of interest of investigate infiltration mechanism of these species into the perovskite surface. In this subsection, we discuss the CI-NEB study of the migration pathways of H2O, OH and OH− in the MAPbI3 (110) surface.
3.3.1 H2O infiltration. Fig. 5a shows the optimized adsorption structure of H2O on the MAPbI3 surface before infiltration. As shown in the figure, the H2O molecule forms two H⋯O hydrogen bonds with two top-layer MA cations. Fig. 5b shows the transition state of the infiltration process obtained from the CI-NEB calculation. The activation energy was found to be 12.1 kcal mol−1. In this transition state, the hydrogen bond of one of the MA cations is broken. The other MA cation, however, rotates to follow the H2O as it moves inward, preserving the hydrogen bond. The energetics of the infiltration process is expected to be affected by the initial orientations of the MA cations, and on the breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds during the process. However, our calculated barrier is only slightly larger than the value of 7.1 kcal mol−1 reported in a previous work.31 Fig. 5c shows the optimized structure after the H2O has infiltrated to the bottom of the top layer. In this case, the H2O molecule is also hydrogen bonded to two MA cations, one in the top layer and the other in the layer below. The final structure is lower in energy by 18.6 kcal mol−1 than the initial structure.

3.3.2 OH infiltration. As found in the AIMD simulations in this work and in our previous work,32 there is spontaneous hydrogen transfer from a MA cation to the OH radical to form a H2O molecule upon OH adsorption. Fig. 6a shows the optimized initial structure in which the resulting H2O molecule is adsorbed on the surface forming a N⋯H hydrogen bond with the resulting CH3NH2 molecule and a O⋯H hydrogen bond with a MA cation. We employed the CI-NEB calculations to investigate if this resulting H2O can infiltrate into the perovskite surface and to study the migration pathway. We found an interesting intermediate which is lower in energy than the initial configuration (Fig. 6b). In this configuration, the O in the water forms a covalent bond with a Pb in the inorganic framework and a hydrogen in the water is transferred back to the MA molecule. This structure is lower in energy by 9.8 kcal mol−1 compared to the initial structure. Such a lower-energy Pb–O bonding configuration was not found in our optimization calculations32 or in the AIMD simulations. It was only obtained by the NEB calculations which ensure the minimum energy pathway is followed with the appropriate orientation of the MA cations. Moreover, an energy barrier should exist between the initial and the Pb–O bonding configuration that has prevented the direct access to this lower energy configuration from structural optimization or AIMD simulations. However, our Cl-NEB calculations were not able to obtain this value. The activation energy could be too small to be accurately identified in the calculations.

As the OH radical moves further into the bulk, the system goes through a transition state in which the OH radical shares a hydrogen atom with the same MA cation, while the Pb–O bond is preserved (Fig. 6c). Here, the H–O and the H–N distances are both ∼1.25 Å. The activation energy is +13.7 kcal mol−1. After the transition state, the OH migrates to the bottom of the top layer (Fig. 6d). The hydrogen atom moves back to the MA cation and the Pb–O covalent bond stays intact. The energy of this final structure is lower than that of the structure in Fig. 6b by 2.7 kcal mol−1. Fig. 6e shows the energy profile of the migration path. Our results show that the infiltration process is coupled with repeated hydrogen transfer between the OH radical and the MA cation. Overall, the Pb–O covalent bond remains intact during infiltration which could be the first step of the formation of PbO proposed in reaction (4a).

3.3.3 OH− infiltration. We then investigated the migration of OH− into the MAPbI3 (110) surface using CI-NEB calculations. In the case for one OH− ion adsorbed on the surface, a proton in the MA cation was spontaneously transferred to the hydroxide ions to form a H2O and a CH3NH2 molecule in agreement with our AIMD simulations and our previous results.32 In this configuration, the H2O forms one N⋯H hydrogen bond with a MA cation and one O⋯H hydrogen bond with the MA molecule when adsorbed on the surface (Fig. 7a). We investigate here if the resulting H2O will infiltrate into the perovskite surface using CI-NEB calculations. Fig. 7b shows an infiltration intermediate similar to the case with an OH radical. In this configuration, a Pb–O covalent bond is formed between the O in the OH− and the Pb in the inorganic framework, and the proton that has been transferred to the OH− moves back to the MA molecule. This intermediate is lower in energy by 9.6 kcal mol−1 compared to the initial structure. Again, we did not observe this more stable configuration in our optimization and AIMD simulations suggesting that there should be a barrier separating the initial and the Pb–O bonding configuration. However, this activation energy could be too small to be accurately identified in the CI-NEB calculation.

Fig. 7c shows a transition state as the OH− ion moves further into the bulk. In this transition state, the OH− ion now shares the proton with the MA cation (the distances of the H–O and H–N are ∼1.22 and 1.28 Å respectively), and the Pb–O is intact. The transition state is higher in energy than the structure in Fig. 7b by 15 kcal mol−1. Fig. 7d shows the final structure in which the OH− reaches the inner perovskite slab, also keeping the Pb–O bond but giving the proton back to the MA cation. This final structure is lower in energy by 3.5 kcal mol−1 compared with that of the structure in Fig. 7b. Fig. 7e shows the energy profile of this infiltration process. Similar to the case with an OH radical, the infiltration process of OH− is coupled with repeated proton transfer between the OH− and the MA cation. Moreover, the formation of Pb–O bond could be an early step of forming PbO in the proposed reaction (7a).

4. Conclusions
In this work, we combined DFT calculations with the AIMD and CI-NEB techniques to study the role of H2O molecules, OH radicals and OH− ions on the decomposition of MAPbI3 and their interactions with the MAPbI3 (110) surface. In the presence of H2O molecules, we found that MAPbI3 preferentially transforms into monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O by reacting with the H2O molecules. However, the subsequent the decomposition of this monohydrate was were found to be endothermic. On the other hand, in the presence of OH or OH− species, the formation of monohydrate MAPbI3·H2O is also energetically favorable. We then proposed possible subsequent reactions involving OH or OH− that lead to the decomposition of the monohydrate to different degradation products identified experimentally. The decomposition reactions of monohydrate in the presence of OH are significantly less endothermic compared to those involving only water. However, the energetics of the decomposition is less affected by the presence of OH−. Despite the endothermic nature of the subsequent degradation for the case with OH or OH−, the gaseous products formed are expected to drive the forward decomposition reactions. By identifying and analyzing the possible decomposition reactions, we have concluded that the presence of OH and OH− species greatly facilitates the degradation process, which agrees well with previous experimental results.28,29 Our work also provides important explanation for such accelerated degradation.
The AIMD simulations with OH (or OH−) on the MAPbI3 (110) surface showed that the hydrogen atom (or proton) in a MA cation spontaneously transfers to the OH (or OH−) within the first 1 to 2 ps, forming a H2O and a CH3NH2 molecule. The resulting CH3NH2 molecule then diffuses away from the perovskite surface. The diffusion was found to correlate well with the hydrogen (or proton) transfer process in our AIMD simulations. This provides additional key information of the CH3NH2 molecule desorption process not observed in our previous static DFT calculations.32 We also found that some of the water molecules and the CH3NH2 molecule cluster together through hydrogen bonds suggesting that physisorption of a monolayer of water on the perovskite surface may not be thermodynamically favorable.
Lastly, the infiltration pathways of a H2O molecule, an OH radical and an OH− ion into the MAPbI3 (110) surface were investigated by the CI-NEB technique. We found that the energy barriers for the infiltration processes are comparable in the three cases. Moreover, for the cases with OH and OH−, a Pb atom in the inorganic framework was found to be involved through the formation of a Pb–O covalent bond which could be the precursor of forming the PbO or Pb(OH)2 compounds as the degradation products. In conclusion, our simulation study has identified the roles of H2O molecule, an OH radical and an OH− ion in the degradation of perovskite MAPbI3 and would provide important theoretical foundation to further understand the degradation mechanisms of MAPbI3 under working conditions.
