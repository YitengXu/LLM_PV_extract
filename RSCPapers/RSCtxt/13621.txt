    , Accepted 10th March 2023First published on 13th March 2023AbstractThe traditional methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) is not stable under humid conditions, which limits its application. In this work, a new type of system is designed by replacing two MA cations of MAPbI3 with a chain-like divalent organic cation lying on the surface. Density functional theory calculations are performed to study the geometric and electronic properties of this kind of novel system, such as the hydrogen bonding, energy bands, and optical properties. Three types of divalent cations have been tested, MA(CH2)3MA, MA(C6H4)MA, and MA(C4H2S)MA, denoted as ProDMA, PhDMA, and ThDMA, respectively. It is found that all three divalent cations can improve the thermal and moisture stability of perovskite materials. In particular, ProDMA, without a ring structure in the middle of the chain, has the most suitable size to fill into the available space on the surface where two MA cations are removed, and the corresponding system has the highest stability, especially for water-resistance. At the same time, the performance of the optical absorption and the power conversion efficiency are similar to that of the pristine MAPbI3. This work suggests a promising strategy to improve the stability of perovskite materials by using divalent cations as the protective layer.
1. Introduction
With the continuous development of society, the energy demand is constantly increasing. Developing renewable energy is one of the crucial tasks for human beings at present. Among various renewable energies, solar energy is very popular since there is enormous supply of energy from the Sun to the Earth .1 The organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (PS) MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium, NH3CH3) is one of the essential components of the solar cell. It was first incorporated as a light harvester in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells by Kojima et al. in 2009 and in solid-state solar cells by Kim et al. in 2012.2–4 Since then, PS solar cells have attracted more and more attention and made breakthroughs in the photoelectric conversion performance.5–7 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PS solar cells have reached 25.7%.8
Although a number of studies have researched materials related to MAPbI3 and found their outstanding performance in photoelectric conversion, there are still challenges especially for the low stability in humid and thermal environments.9–11 Wang et al.9 pointed out that the degradation rate of MAPbI3 films in moisture is sensitive to the grain size since the grain boundary allows the quick diffusion of H2O into PS films. The process of decomposition of the MAPbI3 surface in humid environments was studied by Tong et al.12 Research suggested that the H2O molecule could easily penetrate the surface owing to the considerable interspace between MA and PbI3 frame, which can further corrode the whole structure gradually. The deformation of the geometric structure greatly affects the electronic structure, which may decrease the optical absorption performance dramatically. It is of vital importance to adopt strategies to reduce moisture penetration. To solve the problem, Li et al.13 modified the surface of MAPbI3 with the phosphonic acid ammonium additive, which acts as a crosslink between the neighboring grains in the PS structure. The additives increased the PCE from 8.8% to 16.7% and improved moisture resistance. Kim et al.14 designed BDMS-based (butyldimethylsulfonium) PS, using a fully alkylated sulfonium monovalent cation to replace the original MA on the surface to increase humidity stability and retain the structural and optical features of the pristine PS. Bi et al.15 used FEAI (1,1,1-trifluoro-ethyl ammonium iodide) to modify the surface of MAPbI3, also enhancing the stability and performance of the PS solar cells.
The 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type PSs, using long-chain monovalent cations as the connecter between two MAPbI3 PS parts, could improve the ambient stability, but yielded a low PCE.16 The 2D Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type PSs, which use divalent organic cations as the connector between two MAPbI3 PS parts, could further improve the ambient stability.17,18 The divalent cations connect the inorganic layers of two MAPbI3 parts by electrostatic interaction, thus achieving a stronger connection and better performance of interlayer charge carrier transport compared with the 2D RP-type PSs.19 Hang et al.20 researched the 1,5-pentane-diammonium (NH3(CH2)5NH3) based 2D DJ-type PS ((NH3(CH2)5NH3)(MA)3Pb4I13), which is outstanding in photophysical properties and thermal stability. Note that NH3(CH2)5NH3 may also be viewed as MA(CH2)3MA, and thus may be denoted as ProDMA (Pro stands for propyl, and D means di-). Yu et al.19 synthesized 1,4-phenylene-dimethylammonium (MA(C6H4)MA, denoted as PhDMA)-based DJ-type PS (PhDMA)(MA)nPbn+1I3n+4 (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9), and pointed out that the shorter distance between adjacent inorganic layers of 2D PSs results in higher ambient stability. Lu et al.21 developed a bulky divalent cation spacer based on thiophene, 2,5-thiophene-dimethylammonium (MA(C4H2S)MA), denoted as ThDMA, and applied it in the 2D DJ-type PS (ThDMA)(MA)4Pb5I16, which improved the light-soaking stability and thermal stability. However, the PCEs of 2D DJ-type PSs are still lower than those of their 3D counterparts, owing to their inferior optoelectronic properties, such as wider band gaps, higher exciton binding energies, and shorter charge diffusion lengths.22–24 To overcome these shortcomings, surface modification methods need to be explored to improve the material stability while maintaining high PCEs.
The relatively strong interactions between divalent cations and PSs attracted our attention. We noticed that the two ends of the divalent cation were always connected to two PS parts in previous work. An interesting question is whether the two ends of the divalent cation can be stably adsorbed on the same surface of one PS part (i.e., the divalent cation lying on the surface). If possible, can this type of adsorption improve the stability or have adverse effects on the electronic structure? To answer these questions, three types of divalent organic cations mentioned before were selected and tested in this work. They are collectively called xDMA, where x is Pro, Ph, and Th for MA(CH2)3MA, MA(C6H4)MA, and MA(C4H2S)MA, respectively, and there is an MA+ cation at each end of xDMA. The xDMA may replace the original two adjacent MA cations on the surface, lying flat on the surface of the PbI frame. A comprehensive study on the modified structures with these divalent cations was performed, including the size matching of the divalent cations on the surface, the interaction between the surface cations and the PbI frame, electronic structures, and the adsorption of H2O molecule on the surface of the pristine and the surface-modified PSs. The results indicate that ProDMA modified PS is a promising photoelectric material with better thermal and moisture stability and similar electronic structures compared with the popular MAPbI3.
2. Methods
The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to study the geometric and electronic structures of the PSs.25,26 The electron–ion interaction is described using the projector augmented wave (PAW)27,28 pseudopotential method with a cutoff energy of 520 eV. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted in the calculations.29 The valence electronic constituents are 6s26p2 for Pb, 5s25p5 for I, 3s23p4 for S, 2s22p4 for O, 2s22p3 for N, 2s22p2 for C, and 1s1 for H. For the 2D slab model, a 15 Å vacuum spacing was added along the Z direction. The dipole moment correction was performed in the Z direction. The DFT-D3(BJ) dispersion correction of Becke–Johnson damping function30,31 was employed to improve the description of the long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction. The slab model contains four layers of MAPbI3. Further modification is mainly on the top layer of the slab model, in which two adjacent MA cations are replaced by a flat-lying divalent organic cation. Situations change remarkably from the original system, including the interatomic interactions between the cations and the PbI3 frame, the size of the divalent organic cation and two MA+, and so on. Therefore, new systems need to be carefully designed to keep the structure stable. To choose the possible replacement cations, the sizes of the divalent cations and the available space are carefully computed and compared. Besides, the relative positions of these divalent organic cations in the PbI3 frame are also considered to avoid interatomic repulsion and to be facile for making as many hydrogen bonds as possible. For all the slab models, the atoms in the bottom two layers were fixed while the other atoms were fully relaxed until the maximum residual force was less than 0.05 eV Å−1. The convergence criterion for self-consistent calculations was set to 10−5 eV in both the ionic relaxation and the single-point electronic structure calculation. Gamma-centered k-point grids of 4 × 4 × 1, 6 × 6 × 1, and 8 × 8 × 1 were adopted for structural optimizations, single-point calculations, and optical parameter calculations, respectively. The results of band structure and optical absorbance were handled by VASPKIT.32 Cluster models were built which include the surface cations and the surrounding atoms (see Fig. S1 in the ESI† for the detailed description). The wave functions of the cluster models were obtained using the Gaussian 16 program suite33 for further analysis. The reduced density gradient (RDG) method based on non-covalent interactions (NCIs)34 was used for the weak interaction analysis of the surface structure. The properties of bond critical points (BCPs) of the surface structure were calculated using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) topological analysis to quantify the bond energy.35 The analysis of RDG and BCP was performed with the Multiwfn program36 based on the wavefunctions of cluster models.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Construction of the slab models
Bulk MAPbI3 has three common crystal structures, orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic, in which the tetragonal phase is the most stable under ambient conditions.12 The phase transition temperature from orthorhombic to tetragonal is 161.4 K, and from tetragonal to cubic is 330.4 K.37 In this work, only the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3 is considered to reflect the systems at room temperatures.
It was suggested that the orientation of MA in the tetragonal phase MAPbI3 is dynamically disordered and could not be measured by XRD.38,39 Therefore, when the initial structure was set, the experimental values40 were only adopted for the atomic positions of Pb and I (thus the lattice parameters were obtained), while a variety of possible orientations were tested for MA. The optimization includes the position of atoms and the lattice parameters. The most stable structure of bulk MAPbI3 is shown in Fig. 1a, for which the lattice parameters are 8.70 × 8.71 × 12.87, agreeing well with the previous experimental values (i.e., 8.84 × 8.84 × 12.69).40 The structure with the orientation of MA similar to previous research by Tong et al.12 was also tested, while its energy is 0.21 eV higher than the most stable one. The following calculations and discussion are based on the most stable MAPbI3 bulk structure and its slab model, which may account for the subtle differences compared to Tong's work.
 Fig. 1  The top and side views of (a) bulk and (b) slab MAPbI3 (i.e., (MA)2-PS). 
The (001) surface is one of the most common surfaces of MAPbI3,41–44 and the MA-terminated one is found to be more stable than other truncation modes.45 Therefore, a slab model of MAPbI3 (Fig. 1b) was chosen to have an MA-terminated (001) surface for further reactions. This slab model contains four layers of MAPbI3 with two MA cations in each layer, thus denoted as (MA)2-PS. The stoichiometry of 1:1:3 for MA:Pb:I is maintained (i.e., MA8Pb8I24), leading to the other surface being PbI2-terminated. Note that in the slab model of Tong's work,12 both sides of the slab were MA-terminated, which may also cause little differences to our work.
Based on the slab model of MAPbI3, denoted as (MA)2-PS, three divalent organic cations were selected to construct corresponding slab models, denoted as ProDMA-, PhDMA-, and ThDMA-PS, respectively. The divalent organic cation was introduced to replace two adjacent MA cations of the top layer. The sizes of the divalent cations were calculated by Multiwfn to evaluate whether they can be well filled in the available space after removing two MA cations. As shown in Fig. 2a, three I atoms are labeled, and the distance between two iodine atoms is 6.41 and 5.92 Å for I1⋯I2 (dI1–I2) and I2⋯I3 (dI2–I3), respectively. Therefore, the available space is approximately a rectangle with a length of 12.3 Å and a width of 5.9–6.4 Å. The calculated three-dimensional sizes of the divalent cations are shown in Fig. 2b–d. The lengths of the three divalent cations are between 11 and 12 Å, shorter than the length of the available space (12.3 Å). However, only the width of ProDMA (5.1 Å) is short enough to fill in the space with the width of 5.9–6.4 Å. The other two divalent cations, both having a ring in the center of the structure, are much larger in width (6.7 and 6.4 Å for PhDMA and ThDMA, respectively) than ProDMA, and close to or even larger than the width of the available space. Therefore, ProDMA is more suitable to replace two MA cations considering the size matching and the steric effect, while PhDMA and ThDMA may cause the distortion of the surface PbI frame.

A unit cell of (MA)2-PS contains two MA cations on the surface. Replacement of 2(MA+) by an xDMA2+ may have different arrangements if more than one unit cell is taken into account. For a surface with a 2 × 2 cell, there are four types of arrangements for xDMA if periodicity and symmetry are considered. As an example, the optimization results for ProDMA on a 2 × 2 cell surface are shown in Fig. 3. In the first unified arrangement, four ProDMA cations are in the same direction, and the minimum periodic unit is actually a 1 × 1 cell. In the second arrangement, ProDMAs are also parallel to each other, but the system is higher in energy than the unified one by as large as 5.28 eV, which indicates that two parallel ProDMAs can cause a significant repulsion (called parallel repulsion) when they are right facing each other. In the third arrangement, a double staggered structure, a pair of parallel ProDMAs is perpendicular to the other pair. Since there is also parallel repulsion caused by two ProDMAs in the same pair, this arrangement also leads to a higher relative energy (ca. 2.36 eV) than the unified one. The last type of arrangement, a staggered structure with no parallel repulsion, has much low relative energy with respect to the second and the third one, but is still higher than the unified one by 1.12 eV. Because both PhDMA and ThDMA have a ring structure in the middle of the molecule, they will encounter even more severe parallel repulsion in comparison to ProDMA. Therefore, in the subsequent calculations, only the unified arrangement structure is considered, which not only requires fewer computing resources (can be done with a 1 × 1 cell), but also has the lowest relative energy and thus the highest thermal stability.

Red circles indicate four ProDMAs in the 2 × 2 cell, while grey circles are four ProDMAs in the adjacent unit cells due to periodicity. 
3.2 Thermal stability of the divalent cations on the surface
The optimized structures of ProDMA, PhDMA, and ThDMA with the unified arrangement on the surface are shown in Fig. 4. Numbers 1–3 indicate three iodine atoms that are diagonally on the surface of the structure. An xDMA is between I1 and I2 to replace two MA cations of the pristine MAPbI3, while in between I2 and I3 is the space between two xDMAs in a straight line. In (MA)2-PS, the distance between I1 and I2 (dI1–I2) and I2 and I3 (dI2–I3) is 6.41 and 5.92 Å, respectively. The addition of a divalent cation will cause dI1–I2 to become longer and dI2–I3 shorter. The change of dI1–I2 and dI2–I3 caused by ProDMA is relatively small, lengthening or shortening by 0.9 Å (ca. 15%). PhDMA and ThDMA have a great and similar influence on the positions of I atoms. The change of dI1–I2 and dI2–I3 caused by them is about 2.0 Å (ca. 33%). The much more remarkable influence caused by PhDMA and ThDMA, both with ring structures and larger widths than the available space (see Fig. 2), indicates that there are remarkable repulsive interactions (steric hindrance) between them and the surrounding I atoms. This confirms that ProDMA is the most suitable one among the three tested divalent cations for the replacement of two MA cations according to the size matching and the steric effect.
 Fig. 4  The top view of (a) ProDMA-PS, (b) PhDMA-PS, and (c) ThDMA-PS. Numbers 1–3 indicate three iodine atoms that are diagonally on the surface. 
The steric effect can also be reflected by analyzing the electronic structural properties using the RDG method. In the RDG figure (Fig. S2†), spikes in the region with sign(λ2)ρ (denoted as rdg) > 0.01 a.u. indicate repulsion interactions and a larger rdg value corresponds to a stronger repulsion. For (MA)2-PS, there are no spikes indicating a steric effect in the region of (0.01, 0.05) a.u. For ProDMA-PS, there is only one spike with a small rdg value of 0.01 a.u., indicating that the repulsion is not significant. Differently, PhDMA-PS has two spikes with relatively large rdg values of 0.012 and 0.013 a.u., and ThDMA-PS also has a spike with a large rdg of 0.014 a.u. Thus, RDG analysis confirms that the steric hindrance occurs in PhDMA-PS and ThDMA-PS, while it is not significant in ProDMA-PS.
The binding energy (EBE) of the cations on the surface is one of the most essential values to measure the thermal stability.46 For (MA)2-PS and xDMA-PS, EBE is defined as EBE = EA + EPbI − EAPbI(1)
In this equation, EA refers to two times the energy of MA+ for (MA)2-PS and the energy of xDMA2+ for xDMA-PS, respectively; EPbI is the energy of the remaining part after removing the surface cations (i.e., the PbI frame with two additional electrons); and EAPbI is the energy of the whole system. According to the calculated values of EBE (Table 1), the binding of each xDMA2+ on the surface is much stronger than that of two MA cations, indicating that it is thermodynamically favourable to replace 2(MA+) with an xDMA2+. ProDMA has the highest EBE among the three xDMAs, and PhDMA and ThDMA have close values for EBE. The results of binding energy confirm the previous speculation based on the geometric structure – that is, ProDMA has the most stable binding on the surface because of its small steric hindrance.

In addition, the weak interactions between the cations and the PbI frame are analyzed based on the electronic properties at the bond critical points (BCPs).47 Hydrogen bonds are found between NH/CH of the cations and the surrounding I atoms according to the criteria that 0.002 < ρ(rBCP) < 0.034 and 0.024 < ∇2ρ(rBCP) < 0.139 (a.u.),48 in which ρ(rBCP) is the electron density at the BCP. The bond energy of each hydrogen bond (Esingle-HB) is estimated with a fitting formula proposed by Emamian et al.:49 Esingle-HB = 9.674 × ρ(rBCP) − 0.032 (eV)(2)
The sum of Esingle-HB for each type of hydrogen bond within the top layer of a system is given in Table 1 as ENH⋯I and ECH⋯I for NH⋯I and CH⋯I bonds, respectively, together with the total of all hydrogen bonds (EHB). The values of EHB for all xDMA-PS systems are higher than that of (MA)2-PS, further indicating that the strategy of modifying the surface by these divalent cations is energetically reasonable. For each system, the major part of EHB comes from ENH⋯I and the values of ENH⋯I in different systems are very similar. The difference of EHB between (MA)2-PS and xDMA-PS is mainly contributed by CH⋯I. There are actually no CH⋯I hydrogen bonds in (MA)2-PS according to the two criteria based on ρ(rBCP), while ECH⋯I of xDMA-PS is 0.21, 0.52, and 0.23 eV for x = Pro, Ph, and Th, respectively. The nearest CH⋯I distances in (MA)2-PS are quite long, with the shortest bond length (dmin) being 3.29 Å and the average value (davg) being 3.32 Å, which suggests that the interaction between CH and I does not meet the criteria of hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the three xDMA-PS systems generally have shorter CH⋯I bond lengths. ProDMA-PS has dmin and davg of 2.91 and 2.97 Å, respectively, leading to much higher ECH⋯I than (MA)2-PS. PhDMA-PS has four CH⋯I hydrogen bonds, and very short bond lengths (dmin = 2.68 Å, davg = 2.70 Å) due to its large width caused by the benzene ring (Fig. 2 and 4). So ECH⋯I of PhDMA is the highest among the four studied systems. ThDMA-PS also has quite short CH⋯I bond lengths (dmin = 2.80 Å, davg = 2.82 Å), but it has only two H atoms in the thiophene ring, therefore only two CH⋯I bonds. So ECH⋯I of ThDMA-PS is just similar to that of ProDMA-PS.
RDG analysis (Fig. S2†) supports these conclusions about hydrogen bonds. For NH⋯I bonds, the spikes of systems with divalent cations have more negative rdg values than those of (MA)2-PS, indicating stronger NH⋯I bonds in divalent cation systems. NH⋯I bonds correspond to more negative spikes than CH⋯I, suggesting that NH⋯I is dominant in the hydrogen bonding, as in common PS materials.50,51 For CH⋯I interactions, the spikes are in the region near zero for (MA)2-PS, indicating that there are no CH⋯I hydrogen bonds. For ProDMA-PS, the spikes of CH⋯I interactions have a wider and dense distribution in the region of (−0.012, 0.00) a.u. The spikes in the region of (−0.012, −0.01) a.u. correspond to CH⋯I hydrogen bonds, confirming that ProDMA-PS has stronger CH⋯I interactions than (MA)2-PS. In addition to the spikes in the region near zero, PhDMA-PS and ThDMA-PS have spikes with smaller rdg values (ca. −0.016 a.u.), indicating that they have stronger CH⋯I bonds. The similar ECH⋯I of ThDMA-PS and ProDMA-PS is because ThDMA-PS has fewer CH⋯I bonds.
Both EBE and EHB indicate that the replacement of two MA cations by a divalent cation (i.e., ProDMA, PhDMA, or ThDMA) will increase the thermal stability of the system. According to EBE, which considers comprehensive factors of the interactions between the surface cations and the frame (e.g., electrostatic interaction, steric hindrance, and hydrogen bonding), ProDMA is the most suitable divalent cation, although PhDMA is a little better in terms of hydrogen bonding.
3.3 Electronic structural properties of (MA)2-PS and xDMA-PS (x = Pro, Ph, and Th)
The electronic structural properties of the surface-modified PS materials were further analyzed, which may affect the photoelectric properties of the materials directly. Fig. 5 shows the density of states (DOS) and the energy bands of each system. The band gap of the pristine (MA)2-PS is 1.64 eV, which is close to the value calculated by Tong et al. (1.58 eV).12 After the replacement of 2(MA)+ by a divalent cation (i.e., ProDMA, PhDMA, or ThDMA), the band gaps generally did not change much, and were 1.63, 1.51, and 1.62 eV for Pro, Ph, and Th, respectively, and all of them belong to direct band gaps. The projected DOS (PDOS) shows similar characteristics near the band edges – that is, the valence band is mainly contributed by I (partially from Pb), while the conduction band is dominated by Pb. Similar composition and distribution of PDOS for four systems, and thus similar band gaps, may indicate that the substitution of 2(MA+) by the three selected divalent cations can basically maintain the photoelectric properties of the pristine PS materials. For PhDMA-PS, there is a slight difference. The benzene ring of PhDMA makes a non-negligible contribution above the CBM (conduction band maximum) level with two peaks in the range of 2–3 eV, Fig. 5c, which has a repulsive effect on the CBM level. Thus, the CBM level goes down, resulting in a smaller gap of PhDMA-PS than the other three systems by about 0.1 eV.

3.4 Invasion of H2O into (MA)2-PS and xDMA-PS (x = Pro, Ph, and Th)
The invasion of water molecules on the surfaces of four PSs, the pristine (MA)2-PS and the surface-modified xDMA-PS (x = Pro, Ph, and Th) was studied to explore whether the surface-modification of divalent cations has protective effects in humid environments. The shallow surface that may be invaded by water molecules is divided into three zones, O, F, and S, from outside to inside (Fig. 6a), as in Tong's work.12 The relative energy of a system with a H2O in the O/F/S-zone with respect to unadsorbed H2O and the PS is defined as Er-H2O = EH2O–PS − EH2O − EPS(3)where PS indicates (MA)2-PS and xDMA-PS (x = Pro, Ph, and Th), and EH2O, EPS, and EH2O-PS are the energies of a H2O molecule, the PS, and the PS with a H2O, respectively. When the H2O is in the O/F/S-zone, Er-H2O is specified as Er-H2O-O/F/S. The calculated values of Er-H2O are summarized in Table 2.

For the pristine (MA)2-PS, there are two suitable sites for H2O adsorption, labeled as 1 and 2 in Fig. 6b and c. When a H2O is adsorbed on site 1 in the O-zone, Er-H2O-O is not large (−0.30 eV), and the surface atoms do not change their positions obviously. This indicates that the interaction between H2O and the surface is not a strong chemical bonding but weak interactions such as hydrogen bonds. When H2O goes deep into the surface and reaches the F-zone, Er-H2O-F becomes more negative as −0.40 eV. The orientation of the surface MA changes remarkably due to the repulsive interaction between MA and H2O in a tight space. After H2O continues to penetrate the surface and reaches the S-zone, the MA in the F-zone returns to the original orientation while that in the S-zone is distorted a little. Er-H2O-S is −0.33 eV, which is a little lower than that of the O-zone. Similar situations are found when H2O invades from site 2, and Er-H2O values are −0.32, −0.46, and −0.28 eV, which are close to those for site 1. According to these thermodynamic data of Er-H2O, which are all below zero, H2O molecules may invade the surface through both sites 1 and 2. Er-H2O-F is the most negative energy among Er-H2O-O/F/S, indicating that F-zone is the region that may suffer the most damage from H2O. The previous theoretical work also suggested that the MA terminated MAPbI3 surfaces can be decomposed by water.12
Then it is of particular interest to explore whether the divalent cations can protect the surface from the H2O invasion. The invasion of H2O on the surfaces of xDMA-PS (x = Pro, Ph, and Th) has been studied. Two suitable sites are found for each modified surface, as shown in Fig. 7 (taking ProDMA-PS as an example). Site 1 is surrounded by two I atoms and two parallel chains of divalent cations, and site 2 is surrounded by two I atoms and two adjacent endpoints of two long chains on the same line.
 Fig. 7  The invasion process of H2O on ProDMA-PS from (a) site 1 and (b) site 2, with the relative energy (Er-H2O) in eV. 
The invasion process of H2O on ProDMA-PS is shown in Fig. 7. The adsorption of H2O in the O-zone does not cause the structural change of the surface atoms, and Er-H2O-O is −0.28 and −0.30 eV for sites 1 and 2, respectively. These values are a little smaller than those in the O-zone of (MA)2-PS (−0.30 and −0.32 eV), which is beneficial for moisture resistance. More importantly, Er-H2O-F is close to zero (−0.003 eV) at site 1 and even a positive value of +1.28 eV at site 2. From the point of view of thermodynamics, it is not only endothermic for a H2O to go from O- to F-zone, but it is even endothermic (roughly for site 1) to go from the unadsorbed state of water to the F-zone. Therefore, the invasion of water from the O- to the F-zone is thermodynamically inhibited. The Er-H2O-F values for ProDMA-PS are much higher than those of (MA)2-PS. As mentioned before, the repulsive interaction due to the invasion of H2O into a tight space can be relaxed by the orientation change of the two MA cations in (MA)2-PS. However, in the case of ProDMA-PS, the structural relaxation does not occur easily for the long rigid chain of ProDMA2+, which leads to strong repulsive interactions and high relative energy. For the F-zone, site 2 has a much higher relative energy than site 1, indicating that the space of site 2 is even more crowded in this zone. The structure of the system with a H2O in the S-zone is optimized only for site 1. Er-H2O-S is −0.28 eV, which is similar to that in the O-zone and lower than that in the F-zone, because MA in the S-zone can be distorted a little to lower the repulsion. Based on the above results, it is expected that the modification of the surface by a divalent cation ProDMA2+ can prevent water molecules from penetrating deep into the surface of the PS materials and thus improve the stability of the system. Further studies on the band gap and PDOS of ProDMA-PS with a H2O in the O/F-zone (Fig. S3 in the ESI†) suggest that the addition of H2O in ProDMA-PS does not change the band gap (the largest difference is 0.04 eV) and PDOS, indicating that the PS system protected by ProDMA still has good light absorption properties in the presence of water.
The optimized structures of H2O invasion on PhDMA-PS and ThDMA-PS are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† For PhDMA-PS, when a H2O comes to site 1, Er-H2O-O is −0.13 eV, which is higher than that for (MA)2-PS (ca. −0.3 eV), indicating that the adsorption of H2O on the surface is not stable. However, H2O can enter the surface to F- and even S-zone since the values of Er-H2O decrease gradually to −0.26 and −0.30 eV, respectively. The situation of invasion from site 2 is quite similar to that for ProDMA-PS. H2O can only be adsorbed on the surface of O-zone and cannot continue to invade downward, since Er-H2O-F has a positive value of 0.39 eV. Therefore, the modification of the MAPbI3 surface with PhDMA can only protect part of the surface from water erosion. For ThDMA-PS, the values of Er-H2O-O are −0.15 and −0.34 eV for sites 1 and 2, respectively, just similar to those for PhDMA-PS. For site 1, Er-H2O-F is as low as −0.39 eV and increases slightly for Er-H2O-S (−0.31 eV), similar to the case of (MA)2-PS. So H2O molecules may go into both F- and S-zones, and F-zone is the most damaged. For site 2, Er-H2O-F is higher than those of Er-H2O-O and Er-H2O-S, indicating that the F-zone may act as a barrier to prevent water from entering the S-zone. However, Er-H2O-F has a negative value (−0.12 eV), and the barrier of the F-zone is not as high as those for both sites 1 and 2 of ProDMA-PS, and site 2 of PhDMA-PS. So the protecting effect of ThDMA is lower than that of ProDMA and PhDMA. For the three systems with divalent cations, Er-H2O-F has a common feature – that is, the values of Er-H2O-F for site 2 are all higher than those for site 1, which further confirms that the systems may be more crowded with higher repulsive interactions for site 2 than for site 1 when a H2O molecule enters the F-zone. Thus, for each system, it is more likely to be invaded by water from site 1, and the F-zone is of particular importance in blocking water.
As mentioned before, hydrogen bonding interactions in the system play an essential role in the stability of PS materials. The invasion of water into the system will not only change the existing hydrogen bonds but also create new hydrogen bonds between H2O and the system. Therefore, the change of hydrogen bonds due to the existence of a H2O in the F-zone coming from site 1 is investigated for (MA)2-PS and xDMA-PS (x = Pro, Ph, and Th), and the results are presented in Table 3.

The sum of bond energies of all hydrogen bonds within the top layer for each unadsorbed system has already been calculated as EHB and listed in Table 1. For the system with a H2O,  is calculated in the same way as EHB and the bonding between H2O and the PS is not included. Thus, the reduction of the hydrogen energy,  can reflect how large the structural variation of PS materials caused by the H2O is. ΔE′ is 0.24 eV for (MA)2-PS, which is obviously larger than those of xDMA-PS (0.04, 0.11, and 0.00 eV for x = Pro, Ph, and Th, respectively), indicating that systems with divalent cations have higher structural stability than the pristine (MA)2-PS to water. The H2O in the F-zone can make hydrogen bonds with the iodine atoms through HOH⋯I and with the cations through H2O⋯H, with the total bond energy of EHB-H2O and bond lengths of dHOH⋯I and dH2O⋯H. The dHOH⋯I and dH2O⋯H for ProDMA-PS are longer than those for (MA)2-PS, leading to a smaller EHB-H2O for ProDMA-PS. Differently, both PhDMA-PS and ThDMA-PS have higher values of EHB-H2O than (MA)2-PS mostly because they have more hydrogen bonds. This is consistent with the previous discussion about the size of divalent cations. Only the two wider divalent cations (PhDMA and ThDMA) will leave less space for the additional H2O, leading to the formation of more H2O⋯H bonds. The previously defined and calculated relative energy for the system with a H2O in the F-zone (Er-H2O-F) considers all the influence of the total energy by the additional H2O, including ΔE′ and EHB-H2O. All the other influences can be reflected by Eother = Er-H2O-F + EHB-H2O − ΔE′. Thus, a more positive value of Eother indicates higher repulsive interactions, while a negative value of Eother, if possible, indicates attractive interactions. The much more positive Eother values of xDMA-PS show that the replacement of two MA cations by the divalent cation increases the repulsive interactions caused by the incoming H2O remarkably. The repulsion interactions between H2O and xDMA-PS are also confirmed by RDG analysis (Fig. S5†).
3.5 The photoelectric properties of (MA)2-PS and ProDMA-PS
The absorption ability of light with different wavelengths is a vital reference to measure the performance of solar cells. Considering that ProDMA-PS has the most outstanding thermal and moisture stability among the three surface-modified xDMA-PS systems (x = Pro, Ph, and Th), the optical absorption spectrum of ProDMA-PS was calculated and compared with that of the pristine (MA)2-PS. Generally, the linear optical properties of semiconductors can be obtained from the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function ε(ω). However, this method will lead to some calculation deviation for two-dimensional materials simulated by slab models with vacuum layers. An improved approach to calculate the absorption coefficient A(ω) of 2D materials was suggested as32 (4)where  is the normalized conductivity and can be obtained by (5)in the above equation, L is the thickness of the slab, and c is the speed of light. To obtain more accurate absorption spectra,52 the PHS (PBE + HSE06 + Sum rule) method53 was used to deal with the PBE functional calculated A(ω) by considering the energy difference between PBE functional and HSE (Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof) hybrid functional54 while performing the amplitude correction simultaneously based on the sum rule. Fig. 8 shows the light absorption spectra of (MA)2-PS and ProDMA-PS. The two curves almost coincide in the region of 200 to 800 nm. The absorption peak of ProDMA is located at 333.7 nm, which is very close to that of (MA)2-PS at 335.3 nm. Thus, the replacement of two MA cations by a divalent cation ProDMA will not change the light absorption properties of the materials, which further confirms the rationality of this optimization strategy.
 Fig. 8  The calculated optical absorbance spectra A(ω) of (MA)2-PS and ProDMA-PS. 
PCE is a widely used parameter to measure the photoelectric performance of solar cells in experimental work. To compare with the experimental results more conveniently and have a better understanding of whether the modification with ProDMA would influence the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the PCE and some other photoelectric properties of model structures were simulated by Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) software.55 To make the simulation similar to the actual experiments,56 the sandwiched perovskite-based solar cells PS/MAPbI3/PS (PS = the original perovskite, (MA)2-PS, or the modified one, ProDMA-PS) are taken as the light harvesters. TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD are employed as the electron transport material (ETM) and hole transport material (HTM), respectively. Simulation parameters were set carefully according to some previous studies.57–59 More detailed information of the simulation could be seen in the ESI.† The simulated PCEs are 26.88 and 26.47% for the PSC models constructed with (MA)2-PS and ProDMA-PS, respectively. This shows that the modification has a small disadvantageous effect on the photoelectric performance while increasing the stability of the PSCs. The PCE of a similar sandwiched model MAPbI3 simulated by Adihetty et al.56 is about 22.3%, which is a little bit lower than our result. The difference may be caused by the different settings of parameters. Besides, compared with the ProDMA based 2D DJ perovskite with a PCE of 18.41% (experimental value),20 our model with ProDMA-PS modification may yield better PCE. Other simulated photoelectric properties further confirm that the modification will not bring adverse effects, as the open-circuit voltages (VOC) are 1.27 and 1.25 V, the short-circuit current densities (JSC) are 25.13 and 25.14 mA cm−2, and the fill factors (FF) are 84.09% and 84.0% before and after the modification, respectively.
4. Conclusions
Surface-modification of the tetragonal phase MAPbI3(001) surface was conducted by replacing two MA cations with a selected divalent organic cation xDMA2+ (x = Pro, Ph, and Th) lying on the surface. All three divalent cations have suitable sizes to fill into the available space on the surface where two MA cations are removed, and ProDMA is the most suitable one because it is a long chain, while the other two have a ring structure in the middle of the chain. Different arrangements of divalent cations are tested for ProDMA, and the unified arrangement structure is found to be the most stable. According to the binding energy of 2(MA+) and xDMA2+, the replacement of 2(MA+) by a divalent cation xDMA2+ will increase the thermal stability of the system, in which the performance of ProDMA is the best. The binding of MA+ and xDMA2+ is further considered by the change of the surface I–I distances, the hydrogen bonding energy, and RDG analyses. The electronic structural properties of the surface-modified xDMA-PS materials are similar to that of the pristine (MA)2-PS, since the PbI frame, which contributes most to the band edges, does not show much change, further indicating the rationality of the modification. To investigate the protection of xDMA on PS in humid environments, the invasions of water molecules on the surfaces (O, F, and S-zones from outside to inside) of four PSs are researched. (MA)2-PS will be invaded by H2O from both tested sites to the S-zone, and the F-zone is the region that may suffer the most damage. ProDMA-PS can prevent H2O from penetrating into the F-zone. PhDMA-PS and ThDMA-PS can protect the PSs at one site, while H2O may invade from the other entrance. The F-zone, where xDMA cations exist, is of particular importance in blocking water. The different performance of moisture stability is understood by a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bonds of the four systems with a H2O in the F-zone. Finally, the optical absorption spectrum of the most outstanding ProDMA-PS is almost the same as that of (MA)2-PS by using the calculation approach more suitable for two-dimensional materials and the PHS method. Therefore, the surface-modification of the pristine (MA)2-PS by divalent cations xDMA (x = Pro, Ph, and Th) can form a protective layer on the surface, improving both the thermal and moisture stability of MAPbI3. ProDMA coated perovskites are the most promising materials with high thermal and moisture stability while maintaining good photoelectric properties. Our work may provide a practical clue for designing new perovskite materials.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The top and side views of (a) bulk and (b) slab MAPbI3 (i.e., (MA)2-PS).	 

 	Fig. 2  Size matching of the calculation models when two adjacent MA cations are replaced by a divalent cation. (a) The distances between two nearest I atoms in the top layer of the pristine (MA)2-PS. Numbers 1–3 indicate the positions of three iodine atoms. (b, c and d) The calculated three-dimensional sizes of the divalent cations ProDMA, PhDMA, and ThDMA, respectively, with the available space indicated by rectangles (unit for length: Å).	 

 	Fig. 3  Four types of arrangements for ProDMA cations on the surface of a 2 × 2 cell, with (a) unified, (b) parallel, (c) double staggered, and (d) staggered structures. Red circles indicate four ProDMAs in the 2 × 2 cell, while grey circles are four ProDMAs in the adjacent unit cells due to periodicity.	 

 	Fig. 4  The top view of (a) ProDMA-PS, (b) PhDMA-PS, and (c) ThDMA-PS. Numbers 1–3 indicate three iodine atoms that are diagonally on the surface.
