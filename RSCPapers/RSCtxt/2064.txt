Not only is W8 the first reported example in the literature that comprises tetraphenylethylene and naphthalene diimide building blocks, but the device performances [D:A 1:1.2 = 5.26% (P3HT); 8.58% (PTB7)] outlined herein are among the best in the investigated class of three-dimensional non-fullerene electron acceptors.
1. Introduction
Among the renewable energy technologies, the development of organic (otherwise termed bulk-heterojunction) and dye-sensitized solar cells1,2 has attracted researchers globally. The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices in particular are believed to possess a number of advantages, such as light-weight, low-cost, flexibility and remote installation, to name a few, over other technologies such as the conventional silicon-based solar cells.3 In the current literature, the BHJ devices are reported with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >10%.4 This progress is highly encouraging and advocates that the growth and development of organic photovoltaic (OPV) research area is mainly due to the advancement of materials’ design together with improvement of device fabrication strategies.
In the current literature the record efficiencies in the research field of OPV are the result of narrow band-gap polymer donors and soluble fullerene acceptors, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and its C71 analogue (PC71BM), but the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is increasingly challenging the use of fullerene acceptors.5 Over the past two years, the design and development of a number of structural types that have been used as NFA targets have achieved efficiencies at par with the fullerene-based acceptors.6 Thus, it is critical to research new types, such as three-dimensional and acceptor–donor–acceptor, to name two, that can be utilized as NFA materials, and can possess superior properties than their fullerene-based counterparts. Such types should address the limitations of fullerene acceptors, such as strong absorption in the visible region, and limited structural diversity and electronic tunability. Moreover, these types should demonstrate merits, e.g. strong accepting strength, excellent solubility and thermal stability, which make them attractive. Such advantages evidently provide a strong incentive for the development of NFA molecules.
Though the published literature, and the state-of-the-art reviews in particular,7 reveal key examples of a number of types of NFA molecules, we have also seen significant advances in our understanding of the NFA research area that allow the control and prediction of the properties of a thoughtfully designed chromophore.8 We further believe in developing small molecule acceptors, mainly due to their unprecedented advantages over polymeric counterparts. Advantages such as well-defined molecular structure, higher purity, and better batch-to-batch reproducibility are noteworthy and can help to yield high performing OPV devices. However, most of the NFAs based on small molecules exhibit large coplanar molecular structures and high crystallinity, which can result in excessive aggregation leading to unfavourable blend surface morphology. Therefore, it is reasoned that non-planar or three-dimensional (3D) formats are a preferable choice to achieve micrometre-sized phase separation between donor and acceptor domains, and to afford high performing devices.9
In regards to the design of NFAs, a number of structural types can be generated where a variety of donor (D) and acceptor (A) units can be combined to generate structural types such as 3D and A–D–A. We realized that accepting groups such as diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and naphthalene diimide (NDI) can be combined when used as terminal acceptors in conjunction with central conjugated blocks.10 However, NFAs based on a 3D structure comprising NDI unit at terminals have not been explored to a significant extent, though they are highly promising targets given their strong electron withdrawing capacity. Thus, we became motivated to develop an NFA based on tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and NDI functionalities where NDI unit was terminally linked to the central TPE unit. We now report on this novel NFA, 9,9′,9′′,9′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayltetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl))tetrakis(4-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone), coded as W8; see Scheme 1. W8 is a conjugated structure that was synthesized with ease, displayed good thermal stability with excellent solubility, and exerted excellent light-harvesting properties. W8 was evaluated in the solution-processable BHJ devices based on the blends of PTB7 and P3HT (1:1.2 D:A w/w) and afforded PCEs as high as 8.58% and 5.26%, respectively. The PCE value with PTB7 donor polymer is particularly encouraging and validated the potential value of 3D type NFAs. The present work is a continuation of our efforts made in the design and development of small molecule chromophores for organic photovoltaic applications.11

2. Results and discussion
Compound W8 was synthesized in a straightforward manner with moderate yield via the Suzuki coupling reaction between 4-bromo-9-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)ethene. The reaction was run in tetrahydrofuran:water solvent mixture (9.5:0.5 v/v) at 80 °C for 12 h using potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as base and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0) [Pd(PPh3)4] as the catalyst (Scheme 1). W8, a dark purple solid, was purified via simple column chromatography using routine lab solvents (20% dichloromethane in hexane) and its structure was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, MALDI-TOF and elemental analysis. It was found to be highly soluble in a variety of common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform and dichlorobenzene, for instance it had a solubility of >22 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene. High solubility of organic semiconductors is an important prerequisite for solution-processable, thin-film devices and W8 fulfilled this criterion.
While designing W8, we took great care of the fact that it should be a non-planar structure overall. The logic behind this principle lies in the fact that the non-planar molecular arrangements help to prevent strong intermolecular aggregation, sustain elongated and effective conjugation for efficient photon harvesting, and unveil adequate π-surface for electron transport.12 Moreover, the combination of TPE and NDI units was further based on our understanding of 3D materials as efficient NFAs. Such target materials comprise a central double bond which is under strain, twisted and is primed for reduction.13 The TPE is one such unit which allows combining bulky substituents at its peripheries, thus, generating targets with longer central double bond and with the ability to accept electrons. We expected W8 to be similarly activated toward accepting an electron (central bond length = 1.37 Å vs. standard 1.34 Å), hence to act an efficient electron accepting semiconductor (see Fig. S1, ESI†). We further thought to incorporate either lipophilic chains or less-conjugated, cyclic rings containing conventional donor atoms, such as nitrogen, on the outer bay position of the NDI functionality. Not only can it help to enhance solubility, but is advantageous to produce excellent films together with generating a target chromophore with increased conjugation. The choice of such units or lipophilic chains can be made from a variety of chemical entities, for instance octylamine, piperidine, 1-aminocyclohexane, to name a few. In the present case, 4-methyl piperidine was the entity of choice. We have demonstrated this concept in one of our previous reports where we used 1-octylamine on one of the bay positions of NDI functionality.14
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of W8 are reported in Fig. 1. In solution, W8 exhibited strong absorption with an absorption maximum (λmax) at 552 nm (molar extinction coefficient = 71333 L M−1 cm−1 at 5.60 μM). In thin film, the λmax was red-shifted by ∼10 nm and the spectrum indicated a broad absorption right from 300 nm to about 650 nm. The blend film using a combination of PTB7 and W8 (1:1.2 w/w) demonstrated strong light-harvesting ability over most of the visible region together with some of the high energy area, typically between 300–800 nm, thus, suggesting that there exists an efficient charge transfer transition between donor and acceptor domains. The absorption profile of the annealed blend spectrum (annealing at 100 °C for 10 min) further suggested that not only is the blend thermally stable, but exhibits a strong miscibility between the donor and acceptor counterparts. Such types of well-plaited, post-annealed surfaces can certainly be advantageous for better morphology, higher photocurrent density, and better device outcome when compared with as-cast surfaces.

The estimation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level was carried out using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA). The PESA analysis of as-cast and annealed blends suggested the average HOMO value to be −5.73 eV, which was then added to the optical band gap (1.90 eV; film spectrum) to give the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (3.83 eV). The positioning of the LUMO energy level suggested that W8 can certainly achieve a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) when it is fabricated using a variety of commonly used donor polymers PTB7 and P3HT. Achieving a higher Voc is certainly advantageous, especially when compared with the devices using the conventional fullerene acceptors (see Fig. 2 for energy level diagram and Fig. S2, ESI,† for PESA curve). The Gaussian 09 ab initio/DFT quantum chemical simulation package was employed to acquire the theoretical density distribution results represented in the current work.15 The geometry optimization of W8 with truncated alkyl chains was carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory and the frontier molecular orbitals were generated using Avogadro16,17 (see Fig. 3 for density distribution and Table S1, ESI,† for the details of DFT calculations). The DFT calculations clearly indicated a well-segregated density distribution, meaning that the HOMO and the LUMO densities are far apart for efficient charge transfer transition. The HOMO resided on the central TPE unit whereas the LUMO was localised on the peripheral NDI unit. Furthermore, in order to understand the nature of charge transfer transition, we conducted time-dependent DFT calculations (TD-DFT). The TD-DFT calculations provide excitation energies and oscillator strengths (denoted by f) of the lowest singlet states. The computed absorption spectrum (see Fig. S3, ESI†) shows two major transition peaks at 445 nm and 321 nm, with the former peak mainly described as the HOMO → LUMO transition. Theoretical calculations also revealed that W8 exhibits a high optical band gap, which in fact is logical, given its absorption in the high energy area, and a result that provides strong support to our experimental findings. Apart from the properties such as solubility, chemical stability and appropriately positioned energy levels, it is critical for an organic semiconductor to be thermally stable so as to allowing specific device processing, such as annealing, if required. That being said, we conducted thermogravimetric analysis. The thermogravimetric analysis revealed that thermal stability of W8 is excellent, meaning that the blend surface can certainly be annealed and we may see an improvement in the active layer morphology upon annealing (for TGA curve see Fig. S4, ESI†).

After examining the optoelectronic properties of W8, correlating them with those of the conventional donor and acceptor materials, and aligning and analysing them in the energy level diagram, we evaluated its performance as an NFA along with the commercially available donor polymers PTB7 and P3HT in solution-processable BHJ devices under simulated sunlight and monochromatic light illumination. Though we were well aware of a number of device architectures, for instance inverted, we chose a very simple device architecture – indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 38 nm)/active layer (∼75 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) – primarily because of the reasons of processability, stability and reproducibility. Besides, a well-designed NFA should work with most of the device architectures, diverse range of donors and with a number of solvents if it has to be adopted for large-area applications. In the present case, the active layer was a 1:1.2 blend of donor polymer:W8, spin-cast from o-dichlorobenzene on top of the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate. Though we decided to use PTB7 polymer given its complementary properties with W8, we made devices using P3HT too as it is one of the thoroughly studied and most understood polymers in the field of organic photovoltaics and has the potential to be synthesized using low-cost, high-throughput methods. We also fabricated control devices based on P3HT:PC61BM combination. In regards to the fabrication of fullerene-free organic solar cells, it is becoming evident that the use of a high boiling point solvent is preferable as it may affect device performance.18 Therefore, based on such principles and our own understanding of the BHJ device architecture, the active films were spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solutions (1:1.2 D: A w/w).
The characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based on PTB7 and P3HT are shown in Fig. 4. The best as-cast device based on PTB7 showed an impressive efficiency of 5.72% which improved to 8.58% upon annealing. The annealing was done at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The device parameters, Voc = 1.04 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) = 13.41 mA cm−2 and fill factor = 0.62, under annealing conditions were found to be highly encouraging and among the highest numbers in the current literature using the 3D molecular architectures as NFAs. The annealed devices using P3HT afforded satisfactory outcome too, yielding >5%, thus suggesting that the newly designed W8 is compatible with a variety of donor polymers. This validates the use of 3D NFAs and that a well-designed acceptor chromophore should provide good performance under any condition. The superior photovoltaic performance under annealing conditions may be a result of better morphology of the active layer. Our observation of superior device outcome under annealing condition was strongly supported by atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis which was conducted in tapping mode. Based on the AFM analysis it was evident that the blend morphology under annealing condition was superior when compared with the morphology at room temperature. Moreover, PTB7-based blend showed a much smoother surface with a more desirable morphology when compared with P3HT blend. The respective surface roughness for room temperature and annealed blend surfaces based on PTB7 were found to be 1.65 nm and 0.90 nm, whereas the P3HT-based blend afforded a surface roughness of 3.86 nm. Not only superior morphology, but an increase in the short-circuit current density was held responsible for better performance based on PTB7-based devices. The latter is a result which is clearly consistent with the complimentary absorption of PTB7 and W8. See Fig. 5 for AFM images and Table S2 (ESI†) for detailed device parameters. The standard device incorporating the conventional donor and acceptor materials, P3HT and PC61BM, respectively, afforded 3.03% efficiency, a result that corresponds to most of the literature reports.

The root-mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.65 nm, 0.90 nm and 3.86 nm were observed for a, b and c, respectively. 
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement of the blended film with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1.2 is shown in Fig. 6. The blended film of the best annealed device (PTB7:W8 1:1.2) revealed a broad IPCE spectrum ranging from high energy region to the end of the visible spectrum, typically from 320 nm to 800 nm, with an IPCE maximum of approx. 68% at 570 nm. Such an IPCE range is of great significance, and particularly in high energy area, and is most likely possible with the inclusion of NDI functionalities in a given target. This further suggests that W8 can be blended with a variety of other conjugated polymers and small molecule donors to achieve charge generation over a broad range of wavelengths.

Though it was evident through AFM analysis that the annealed blend morphology afforded superior outcome when compared with the as-cast blend, it was thought that annealing might have affected the surface and shifted to somewhat granular morphology. The rationale behind this thought lies in the fact that the morphologies such as granular, worm and bush are generally preferred to morphologies such as amorphous and regular as they produce better device performances. Thus, we conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis in order to observe any surface crystallinity. It was found that P7B7 and P3HT blends were amorphous (see Fig. S5, ESI†), thereby ruling out the possibility of morphologies such as granular and any surface crystallinity being responsible for higher device outcome. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the PTB7 blend further confirmed that the blend surface is a type of surface which is flat, uniform, and is largely free from any cracks and troughs (see Fig. S5, ESI†). It is evident from the recent literature that such featureless blend appearances usually result in relatively higher values of Jsc and FF as is the case of PTB7:W8 blend. Given the amorphous nature of the blends of W8, which was also confirmed by optical microscopy (see Fig. S6, ESI†), it can be argued that it is the target material's greater miscibility with the donor counterparts, and PTB7 in particular, that was an important contribution to the observed device performance.
To gain an insight into the effective charge carrier mobilities, the space charge limited current (SCLC) method was employed to get information about charge transportation using the electron-only devices. The electron-only devices consisting of an active layer sandwiched between a zinc oxide (ZnO) coated ITO electrode and LiF/Al counter-electrode were fabricated (Fig. S7, ESI†). From the current density as a function of voltage data (Fig. S7, ESI†), the electron mobility in the SCLC region can be estimated using the Mott-Gurney equation, J = 9(εrε0μ)/8 × (V2/d3), where J is the current density, V = Vapplied − Vbi; Vapplied is the applied potential and Vbi is the built-in potential resulting from the work-function difference between two electrodes, εr is the dielectric constant of active material, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, μ is the charge-carrier mobility, and d is the sample thickness. Using this expression, good electron mobilities of the order of 10−3 were observed (Fig. S7, ESI†). It is well understood in the literature that the electron mobilities of the observed order are beneficial for achieving higher Jsc and FF values with the resulting photovoltaic devices as is the case of W8. The observance of good electron mobilities together with greater miscibility with the donor counterparts validate the idea of researching NFAs based on 3D formats and underlines the utility of the functionalities used in designing W8. That being said, it will be worth examining a number of acceptor units, such as rhodamine and perylene diimide, that can be linked to the central TPE unit so as to generate novel NFA targets. We are working in this direction to generate a number of similar targets in our laboratories.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel tetra-naphthalene diimide substituted small molecule, W8, was designed and synthesized, and its potential as an electron acceptor is demonstrated. The material is (1) structurally simple, (2) highly absorbing in the visible region, (3) thermally and chemically stable, and (4) can be synthesized via relatively few synthetic steps. These merits give W8 an inherent advantage over fullerene acceptors, such as PC61BM, for which high cost, electronic and structural tuning, and limited absorption are restrictive factors. W8 was designed to be non-planar and it possessed a higher LUMO energy level relative to PC61BM, which is certainly advantageous for achieving a high open circuit voltage. W8 showed its compatibility with two different donor polymers, P3HT and PTB7, and the blend morphology of active layers indicated the present system to be highly intermixed. The device parameters outlined herein are among the top numbers that have been achieved using the combination of a three-dimensional non-fullerene electron acceptor and the commercial donors. The results of this research evidently suggest that W8 is an appropriately designed, highly promising non-fullerene acceptor which can be tested with other potential donors, polymers or small molecules, for future applications in BHJ devices.
4. Experimental details
4.1 Materials and methods
All the reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere, unless otherwise stated. Solvents used for various reactions were dried using a commercial solvent purification/drying system. Solvents used for extractions and column chromatography, and all other reagents were used as supplied by commercial vendors without further purifications or drying.
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using 0.25 mm thick plates pre-coated with Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 silica gel, and visualized using UV light (254 and 365 nm). Petroleum spirits with a boiling point range of 40–60 °C were used wherever indicated. Column chromatography was performed on either 40–60 or 20–40 μm silica gel. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 300, 400 or 500 MHz, as indicated. The following abbreviations were used to explain multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, br = broad, dd = doublet of doublets, and dt = doublet of triplets. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 75 or 101 MHz, as indicated. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were calibrated using residual non-deuterated solvent as an internal reference and are reported in parts per million (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane (δ = 0). PESA measurements were recorded using a Riken Keiki AC-2 PESA spectrometer with a power number of 0.5. Samples for PESA were prepared on ITO cleaned glass substrates and were run using a power setting of 10 nW. TGA experiments were carried out using a Q-500 TGA instrument with nitrogen as a purging gas. The samples were heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Details of spectroscopic measurements, and device fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices were reported previously.8a,11a,b Atomic force microscopy topographic maps were directly performed on the active layers of PTB7:W8 and P3HT:W8 blends using an Asylum Research MFP-3D-SA instrument. The AFM was run in intermittent contact mode (tapping mode) using MikroMasch NSC18 tips (typical resonant frequency ∼100 kHz, typical probe radius ∼10 nm and typical aspect ratio 3:1). TEM samples were prepared by solvent evaporation on a holey carbon grid and micrographs were produced using a JOEL 1010 100 kV TEM. A Bruker AXS D8 Discover instrument with a general area detector diffraction system (GADDS) using a Cu Kα source was utilized to obtain XRD patterns. Synthetic details of 4,9-dibromo-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)ethene were reported previously.8b,19

Synthesis of 4-bromo-9-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-2,7-dioctylbenzo [lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (1). 
A 25 mL round bottom flask was charged with 4,9-dibromo-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (200 mg, 0.30 mmol), 4-methyl piperidine (0.040 mL, 0.33 mmol), N-methyl pyrrolidine-2-one (1 mL) and triethylamine (1 mL), and the reaction mixture was kept under nitrogen flow. The colour of the reaction mixture was immediately changed from colourless to slight pink. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under the N2 atmosphere for 2 h. The completion of reaction was confirmed by TLC. The obtained dark purple solution was poured on ice and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was separated, washed with water followed by brine and evaporated using rotary evaporator under vacuum. The obtained residue was purified using silica gel chromatography (silica gel 60–120 mesh, eluted with 50% CH2Cl2 in hexane) to afford the titled compound as a purple solid (120 mg, 59%).

Synthesis of 9,9′,9′′,9′′′-(ethene-1,1,2,2-tetrayltetrakis(benzene-4,1-diyl))tetrakis(4-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-2,7-dioctylbenzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (W8). 
In a 100 mL vacuum-dried round bottom flask, K2CO3 (132 mg, 0.95 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (22 mg, 0.019 mmol) were added to the solution of compound 1 (325 mg, 0.48 mmol) and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)ethene (80 mg, 0.095 mmol) in THF:H2O (15 mL; 9.5:0.5 v/v) solvent mixture under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. The progress of reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion, the reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water followed by brine, and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The organic layer was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with 20% dichloromethane in hexane to afford W8 as a dark purple solid (148 mg, 58%).
