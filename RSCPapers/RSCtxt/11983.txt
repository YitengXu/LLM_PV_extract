    , Accepted 12th January 2015First published on 14th January 2015AbstractA series of Ca3La3(1−x)Eu3x(BO3)5 (CLBO:3xEu3+) phosphors were prepared by the Pechini-type sol–gel technique. Rietveld refinement was performed using the powder X-ray diffraction data, which shows the occupation of Eu3+ on both Ca2+ and La3+ sites with a preferred location on the La3+ site over the Ca2+ site. In order to enhance the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a novel design is demonstrated by introducing CLBO:3xEu3+ in TiO2-based DSSC. As a new conversion luminescence medium, CLBO:3xEu3+ transfers ultraviolet light to visible light via down-conversion, and increases the solar light harvest and photocurrent of DSSC. The experimental results reveal the feasibility of the conversion luminescence by doping rare-earth phosphors in the DSSC, providing an effective novel method to improve the sunlight conversion efficiency for solar cells.
1. Introduction
Eu3+-doped silicates, aluminates, aluminosilicates and derivatives are widely used in industry for their luminescent properties.1 The emission of the Eu3+ ion typically consists of lines in the red visible spectral area, which correspond to transitions from the excited 5D0 level to the 7FJ (J = 0 to 6) levels of the 4f6 configuration. In some cases, those from higher 5D levels can also be observed depending on the host matrix (phonon frequency and the crystal structure) and the doping rate.2,3 Due to easy synthesis, good chemical stability and low-cost synthesis process, borates are of interest as host lattices (HLs) for doping different luminescent ions.4,5 Ultraviolet (UV) phosphors must have intense absorption in the UV range and high energy transfer (ET) efficiency from the HL to activator. Borates satisfy these conditions because they show a proper forbidden band width.6,7 The crystal structure of the HL Ca3La3(BO3)5 (CLBO) has been determined previously.8,9 The structure consists of isolated BO3 triangles and a distorted [CaO8] and [LaO10] polyhedral, which are able to accommodate the luminescent ions, and thus may serve as a HL for two-center luminescence (Fig. 1b).

Solar energy has been considered as a green and inexhaustible energy source to fossil fuels.10 Because a light-activation mechanism was applied to solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been developed and have shown great promise as a cost-effective alternative to traditional p–n junction silicon-based photovoltaic devices.11,12 Recently, nanosized TiO2 powders have been used as a working electrode for DSSCs due to a higher efficiency than any other metal oxide semiconductor.13 However, the sensitized dyes practically used in DSSCs (i.e., N-719 or N-749 dye) only absorbs visible light, which induces lower sun energy conversion efficiency.14,15 Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the conversion efficiency by extending the DSSCs absorption range to longer or shorter wavelengths. By doping rare-earth (RE) phosphors and using the luminescence down conversion mechanism, the UV light can be transferred into visible light, and then reabsorbed by the sensitized dyes. Moreover, due to TiO2 acting as a sensitizing center for emissions of Eu3+ ions (form a p-type doping and results in the elevation of Fermi level of the photoanode), doping with luminescent ions have been proven to be an excellent method for improving the quality of DSSCs.13,16
In this study, different from other researches (i.e., Baker's group studied improving the light harvesting in DSSC via adding additional light scattering layer formed by silica/polymer nanocomposites17 or increasing surface contact between electrolytes and photoanode18), doping element (Eu3+) were designed to directly substitute the lattice Ti element, not to form a passive layer. Rather, fabricating a cell using combined surface area and charge-transfer enhancement by doping would be a more promising solution. Herein, we were undertaking a detailed study on the structure, optical properties of CLBO:3xEu3+ phosphors and their applications in the TiO2-based DSSC for improving the photovoltaic performance. One of the points of interest in this study is to find out the relationship between the Eu3+ dopant site(s) in the CLBO HL and its corresponding luminescence properties because it is not easy to deduce whether Eu3+ ions enter the La3+ or Ca2+ site or both owing to their different ionic radius and charge characteristics. Moreover, effects on the doped CLBO:3xEu3+ phosphors (not only increases the photocurrent via conversion luminescence but also improves the photovoltage by p-type doping effect) were also investigated in TiO2-based DSSC.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Sample preparations
Eu3+-doped CLBO phosphors were prepared by the Pechini-type sol–gel technique.19,20 The doping concentrations of Eu3+ are 1–16 at.% of La3+. Stoichiometric amounts of the reactants (RE2O3 (RE = La and Eu), H3BO3, CaCO3) were dissolved in concentrated nitric acid, then citric acid was added to the solution. A citric acid to cation molar ratio of 1:1 was employed to prepare the precursor solution. The precursors were dried at 150 °C and heated at 1000 °C for ∼4 h in air. After these processes, polycrystal powders were obtained. The colloid TiO2 was obtained via a previous method (the detailed process is described in ESI†).21,22 The CLBO:3xEu3+ powder was mixed into the colloid ultrasonically vibrating for 70 min and hydrothermally treating at 180 °C for ∼20 h to form a mixed (CLBO:3xEu3+ + TiO2) colloid. A TiO2 film (∼12 μm) was obtained by coating the colloid on the FTO plate with sintering at 430 °C for 25 min. Then, the doping layer of the mixed colloid (∼3 μm) was coated on the TiO2 film in the same process (for transversal comparison, the 15 μm thick CLBO:3xEu3+-doped TiO2 photoelectrode was also fabricated in the same method). Afterwards, the film was soaked in dye N-719 for ∼20 h to form a dye-sensitized film electrode. For comparison, a dye-sensitized TiO2 film electrode without CLBO:3xEu3+ was also prepared, which has the same thickness as the film with CLBO:Eu3+ (∼15 μm). The DSSC was assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 film electrode and a platinum counter electrode, which were clipped together.
2.2. Sample characterizations
The morphology was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Tokyo, Japan) and elemental analysis was analyzed using a SEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. XRD measurements were performed on a D8 Bruker diffractometer employing the Cu Kα radiation and a Vantec multigap detector in the 5–125° 2θ interval. Structure refinement was performed by adopting the Jana 2006 Beta version software,23 using a Rietveld procedure with the fundamental parameter approach in the P63mc space group (SG). The instrumental function was expressed in terms of the geometry of the diffractometer with the relevant parameters reported in Table S1.† The XRD data for structure refinement were collected in the step scan mode with steps of 0.02° (2θ) and a measuring of 2 s per step. Steady luminescence spectra UV-VIS were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrofluorometer with a continuous 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation resource and by single photon counting. Electrochemical experiments were performed on an electrochemical cell filled with an electrolyte solution, in which a Pt counter electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode and a working electrode were immersed. The capacitance–voltage curves and potentiodynamic current-applied potential curves were measured by employing an Electrochemical Workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua Device Co. Ltd., China). The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs were characterized by measuring the J–V character curves using a 150 W xenon lamp (LHX150, Zolix Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) with AM 1.5 G filter (AM 1.5G-3P, Sciencetech Inc., London, ON, Canada). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to one sun (100 mW cm−2) using a reference Si photodiode (PL-RC, Trusttech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DSSCs was measured by measuring the short circuit current under the incident monochromatic light, which comes from a xenon lamp through a monochromator (Omni-λ500, Zolix Co., Ltd). Eletrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were recorded by the same workstation and the measurements were taken over a frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz under standard global AM1.5 solar irradiation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and optical properties

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of CLBO:3xEu3+ (3x = 0 to 16 at.%) phosphors, CLBO HL, as well as the reported pattern of Ca3La3(BO3)5 in JCPDS (no. 31-0277). As an example, the particle image of the CLBO:6%Eu3+ compound is shown in Fig. 1c. Good particle distribution and rounded morphology is observed, which is of advantage to improve the emission intensity. All the diffraction peaks of the samples were consistent with the JCPDS card, which indicates the formation of pure single phases for all the samples. To further confirm the structure of the phosphors, Rietveld structure refinements were performed. Due to that the cationic size of Eu3+ is smaller than La3+ and Ca2+ (for both the 10- and 8-coordinate number (CN)) in the CLBO HL, the occupancies of Eu3+ on both the La3+ and Ca2+ sites were refined, which indicates that the Eu3+ cations can both enter into the Ca2+ and La3+ sites. Eu3+ ions cannot occupy interstitial or B3+ sites due to the large differences in ionic radius. As listed in Table 1, with the increase in the Eu3+ doping concentration, the lattice parameters (a, c and V) become smaller, which further indicates that the Eu3+ cations have been incorporated into the CLBO matrix. There are no La3+ cations entering into the Ca2+ site on neither of the prepared samples, which indicates that it is the Eu3+ ions doping inducing the antisite disorder in the CLBO:3xEu3+ samples. The preferred occupancy of the Eu3+ ions on the La3+ site over the Ca2+ site is due to the fact that La3+ and Eu3+ ions have the same valence state and Eu3+ ions are closer to La3+ than Ca2+ ions considering the chemical bonding. Fig. 1d shows the Rietveld fit of the XRD pattern for the sample CLBO:6%Eu3+, and Table S2† lists the refined lattice constants, the atomic and thermal parameters for the CLBO HL.

a The occupation of Eu3+ on Ca2+ site would induce partial Ca2+ ions coming into La3+ site due to the whole charge balance in the CLBO HL. The possible antisite disorder among Eu3+, La3+ and Ca2+ need to be considered during the refinement process.

The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and PL curves for the CLBO:3xEu3+ (0 ≤ 3x ≤ 16%) phosphors are plotted in Fig. 2 at room temperature (RT). Except the undoped sample, the PL spectra for other samples show line peaks between ∼570 and 720 nm because of the transitions from the lowest excited state 5D0 to the 7Fj levels (j = 0 to 4), while the PLE spectrum (curve a) is composed by two parts: (i) the band located in the UV range originate from the allowed charge transfer state (CTS) band (Eu3+–O2−) and (ii), the sharp peaks from ∼310 to 530 nm are associated with typical intra-4f forbidden transitions. These sharp excitation bands, centered at ∼320, 383, 393, 414, 463 and 526 nm are attributed to the 7F0 → 5D4, 7F0 → 5L7, 7F0 → 5L0, 7F0 → 5D3, 7F0 → 5D2 and 7F0 → 5D1 transitions, respectively.24,25 The intensity of the CTS band is much higher than the 4f–4f transitions in the excitation spectrum due to the allowed electronic transition from the 2p orbital of O2− to the 4f orbital of Eu3+vs. the forbidden transitions within the 4f6 configuration. The curves at the bottom of Fig. 2 show the PL spectra of CLBO:3xEu3+ under λex = 254 nm excitation. The strongest peaks sited at ∼625 and 708 nm are attributed to 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions, respectively. Other peaks centered at ∼580, 593 and 650 nm are assigned to the 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F3 transitions, respectively. Due to that the valence electrons of Eu3+ ions are shielded by the 5s and 5p outer electrons and the 4f–4f transitions of Eu3+ ions are weakly affected by ligand ions, the line shape of emission curves do not change with the different Eu3+ ion doping concentration. The PLE spectra indicate that this type of phosphors can be excited by UV light either indirectly through the CLBO HL or directly through absorption by Eu3+ ions themselves and emit visible light, which is overlapped with the absorption range of the N-719 dye. The PL intensity increases with the Eu3+ doped concentration until a saturated intensity is reached (3x = 6%, critical concentration) under λex = 254 nm. Hence, the doping rate of Eu3+ will be fixed at 6% for the electrochemical analysis in TiO2-based DSSC.
 Fig. 2  (Top) PL and PLE spectra of the CLBO HL and CLBO:1%Eu3+ under λex = 254 and λem = 611 nm, the inset shows the enlarged region of the PLE spectra between 300 and 530 nm. (Bottom) PL spectra of CLBO:3xEu3+ (1 ≤ 3x ≤ 16%) under λex = 254, the inset shows the magnified area for the transition 5D0 → 7F0 located at ∼580 nm. 
Because the splitting of either 5D0 or 7F0 is not possible,2 the presence of two peaks must be due to separate emissions from the two different sites (Eu(La)3+ and Eu(Ca)3+, curve c in the inset of Fig. 2). Namely, Eu3+ ions sited at both La3+ and Ca2+ sites, which is in good agreement with the result reported in Table 1. Actually, these peaks are always very weak or even altogether absent. However, in our case, both sites in the CLBO HL structure have low symmetry, which can readily relax the selection rules. The different Eu3+ sites explained why there are shoulder peaks on each line peak in the PL spectra. According to the crystal field effect, it speculates that the higher CN, the shorter the wavelength of the emission owing to a lower crystal field splitting. We can expect that the peaks at ∼578 nm and ∼580.5 nm are originated from Eu(La)3+ (10-CN) and Eu(Ca)3+ (8-CN), respectively.
Because of the smaller energy gaps between 5D3,2,1 and 5D0, which can be bridged by the vibration energies and manifested in the form of a non-radiative process, emissions from the higher 5D3,2,1 levels to the ground state were not observed in the PL spectra (if exists, the peaks should also be sharp in the shorter wavelengths). The non-radiative multi-phonon relaxation rate of the 4fn Eu3+ configuration can be expressed by eqn (1):25,26 WNR = WNR(0)exp(αnħωp)(1)where α depends on the character of the phonon, WNR is the relaxation rate, ħωp is the highest available vibrational phonon energy, ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, n = ΔE/ħωp is the number of phonons to fill the energy gap. According to eqn (1), high maximum available phonon energy in the CLBO HL can reduce the number of phonons, and thus fill the energy gap and enhance multi-phonon relaxation to bridge the energy level between 5D3,2,1 and 5D0. Hence, this is a nonradiative process whereby excitation energy from an ion decaying from a higher excited state (5D3,2,1) of Eu3+ promotes a neighboring ion from the ground state to the metastable state level, such as 5D1(Eu1) + 7F0(Eu2) → 5D0(Eu1) + 7F3(Eu2). As a result, the higher 5D3,2,1 levels emission can be easily quenched via cross-relaxation and the 5D0 emission becomes dominant. Based on these results, the UV irradiation can be absorbed by the N-719 dye in the TiO2-based DSSC through a down-conversion mechanism, which expects to widen the light absorption range of the DSSC.
3.2. Electrochemical analysis for CLBO:6%Eu3+ doped in TiO2 film
SEM images of pure and CLBO:6%Eu3+ doped TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The typical size of a tightly interconnected TiO2 nanoparticle is ∼20–30 nm and, most of the particle morphology is spherical. For the phosphor doped TiO2 films, the nanoparticles shape is rod-like, and the typical diameter and length of the nanorod is ∼50–100 and 250–450 nm, respectively. The presence of CLBO:6%Eu3+ (6 wt%) elements in the doped TiO2 films were analyzed using EDS, as one can see in Fig. 3c. The estimated composition of the sample is given in Table 2.

The effects of CLBO:6%Eu3+ on the energy level of TiO2 is assessed via Mott–Schottky electrochemical analysis. Fig. 4a shows Mott–Schottky plots (1/C2vs. V) of the TiO2 film with different amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+. According to the Mott–Schottky eqn (2),27,28 the flat-band potential (VFB) can be evaluated, which relates the capacity to the potential difference between the surface and the bulk of a semiconductor ΔV: (2)where ε is the dielectric constant of the material, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, e is the element charge, Ni is the concentration of donors in n-type and acceptors in p-type of the semiconductor, Zi is +1 for donors and −1 for acceptors. One can see a negative shift in the value VFB with an increase of the amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+ from −0.389 V for TiO2 film to −0.874 V for the film doped with CLBO:6%Eu3+ of 8 wt% (Table 3). This result is due to the fact that the pristine TiO2 film is an n-type semiconductor and the introduction of +3 value (Eu3+) metal ions into +4 ones (Ti4+) would induce a p-type doping effect that leads to a negative shift in the VFB with the increase in CLBO:6%Eu3+ amount in the TiO2 film (the same process as the +3 metal ions into +4 ones in Si semiconductor). Note here, doping different amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+ cannot change the TiO2 film semiconductor type. However, the doping rate can influence the Fermi level and the VFB of the TiO2 film.

The potentiodynamic parameters for different amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+ (0 to 8 wt%) compounds doped in TiO2 films were also measured, as one can see in Fig. 4b (current–potential curves). With the increase in the applied potential, one can observe that the insertion of CLBO:6%Eu3+ in TiO2 film first triggers the increase in the photocurrent densities, and then gradually tend to reach a saturation value. Obviously, the photocurrent densities for the CLBO:6%Eu3+/TiO2 system are all larger than the TiO2 film (Table 3).
3.3. Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
To investigate the photovoltaic characteristic of DSSCs under UV irradiation, optical filters were adopted to filter out the light with a wavelength larger than 350 nm. Fig. 4c exhibits the photovoltaic characteristic curves for the DSSCs without and with CLBO:6%Eu3+ (6 wt%) doping under an UV irradiation (24 mW cm−2). The fill factor (FF) and light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency (η) were calculated according to the eqn (3) and (4):12 (3) (4)where JSC is the short-circuit current density (in mA cm−2), VOC is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, and Jmax (in mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curves at the point of maximum power output, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of DSSC without CLBO:6%Eu3+ doping are: JSC = 1.184 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.577 V, FF = 0.530 and η = 0.367%, respectively. For the DSSC doped with CLBO:6%Eu3+ (6 wt%) compound shows enhanced photovoltaic parameters: JSC = 1.398 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.677 V, FF = 0.561 and η = 0.548%, respectively. These results indicate that UV light can be effectively converted to visible light by doping CLBO:6%Eu3+ compound. Hence, for the doped sample, to some extent, the more incident light absorbed, the higher is the efficiency of the DSSC.
The photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs without and with different amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+ doping under a simulated solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4d and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 4. From the experimental results, the values of VOC increase with an increase in CLBO:6%Eu3+ amount in the DSSC. The values of JSC first increases until the concentration quenching (6 wt%) and then decrease. The maximum efficiency of the DSSC (7.953%) is obtained when the amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+ is 6 wt% in the doping layer. For the JSC values, before quenching (6 wt%), the increase can be attributed to the down-conversion luminescence of Eu3+ from UV light to visible light. Furthermore, the changes in TiO2 film energy level can improve the carrier transport at the interface of the TiO2/dye, which helps in improving the JSC. After the doping concentration quenching, perhaps more grain, phase and domain interfaces in the doping layer are created, which can capture photogenerated electrons and holes and result in impeding the charge carrier transportation and leading to the decrease in the photocurrent.29,30 For comparison, the photovoltaic performance of the 15 μm thick CLBO:0.06Eu3+-doped TiO2 photoelectrode is shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†).

Moreover, the VOC is the difference between the Fermi level of the electrons in the oxide film and the redox potential of the electrolyte (VOC = EF(TiO2) − Eredox).31 The changes in VOC are due to the band-edge movement relative to the redox electrolyte energy. When Eu3+ cations were doped in the TiO2 film, the Eu3+ ions will substitute in the Ti4+ ions lattice sites, which induce a p-type doping. Therefore, the conduction band edge of TiO2 moves upward and the Fermi level improves, as a result, VOC increases after the CLBO:6%Eu3+ doping. As could be seen in Table 4, when the ratio of CLBO:6%Eu3+/TiO2 is fixed at 6 wt% in the doping layer, the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC reaches 7.653%, which is considerably higher than the DSSC without RE ion doping (by increasing ∼35%). Different from other studies in this field (spectral converters by RE compound were installed on the front or the back in the TiO2 film), we introduced doped RE compound (CLBO:6%Eu3+) in the doping layer (TiO2 photoanode) of DSSC, which can enhance the effective conversion efficiency and p-type doping effect.

Fig. 5a shows the IPCE spectra of DSSCs without and with Eu3+-doped electrodes. In the light range (300–800 nm), the largest IPCE was observed for DSSC with a Eu3+-doped (6 wt%) electrode and the IPCE of DSSC without an Eu3+-doped electrode is the lowest. The IPCE of DSSC depends on the incident light harvesting and light scattering.32 The light harvesting effect is attributed to the surface area of TiO2 and the amount of the dye adsorbed, and the light scattering effect is related to the shape of TiO2. When the light wavelength is larger than ∼400 nm, the IPCE of DSSCs with Eu3+ (6 wt% and 2 wt%)-doped electrode is considerably larger than the pure TiO2 electrode. The shape and size of Eu3+-doped (6 wt%) TiO2 particles are almost the same as the one with Eu3+-doped (2 wt%) TiO2 particles (Fig. S2†), and their light scattering contribution to the DSSC efficiency should be also almost the same. Therefore, we suggest that the large efficiency improvement of DSSC with the Eu3+-doped electrode is mainly due to the down-conversion luminescence effect rather than light scattering effects.
 Fig. 5  (a) IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on single N719 sensitized and Eu3+ co-sensitized photoelectrodes, (b) Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measured under standard AM 1.5G solar irradiation. 
To further analyze the impact of applying the Eu3+-doped dyes to sensitize solar cell electrodes towards the electron transportation processes at the interface, the Nyquist plots of EIS, measured at a bias voltage corresponding to the Voc, are presented in Fig. 5b. The impedance of diffusion of redox species in the electrolyte is not negligible under illumination because the current flow in the cell is large. On the other hand, the Fermi level in TiO2 approaches the lower edge of the conduction band, thus the electron transport resistance is negligible.33 The equivalent circuit is presented in the Fig. S3.† As indicated in Fig. 5b, three typical EIS spectra exhibit three semicircles in the Nyquist plot. In the order of increasing frequency the features are attributed to the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, electron transfer at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, and redox charge transfer at the counter electrode, respectively. Under light illumination, the second semicircle radius in the Nyquist plot decreased after Eu3+-doped N-719/TiO2, and the values are in the order Eu3+(6 wt%)-doped < Eu3+(2 wt%)-doped < N-719, which indicates a decrease in the electron transfer impedance and an increase in the charge transfer rate at the interface. The total decrease in resistance is beneficial for electron transfer and for further improving the performance of DSSCs. These results suggest that the high performances in TiO2 based DSSC sensitized with Eu3+ are also due to the decrease in the internal cell resistance.
4. Conclusion
In summary, through the Pechini-type sol–gel process, the pure phase of the phosphors CLBO:3xEu3+ (0 ≤ 3x ≤ 16%) were obtained and their photoluminescence properties were investigated. The PLE spectra of the CLBO:3xEu3+ phosphors indicate that the Eu3+ ions can be excited by UV light, while the PL bands are just located in the absorption range of the N-719 dye. As a p-type dopant, Eu3+ ions elevate the Fermi level of the TiO2 film and increase the photovoltage. When the doping amount of CLBO:6%Eu3+ is fixed at 6 wt% in the doping layer, the light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC reaches 7.953%, which is increased by ∼35% compared to the TiO2 film. These results demonstrate that the conversion luminescence in DSSC can provide an effective method to improve the sunlight conversion efficiency for solar cells.
