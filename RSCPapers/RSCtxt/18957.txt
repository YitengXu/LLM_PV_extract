E-mail: chhlu@njut.edu.cn; xzz@njut.edu.cnReceived 19th July 2013, Accepted 4th September 2013First published on 6th September 2013AbstractHexagonal sodium yttrium fluoride crystals with predictable shapes, such as microtubes, microspheres, microrods, micro-bipyramids, microplates, and microprisms, have been synthesized by simply tuning the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+ (RE represents the total amount of Y3+ and the doped rare earth elements such as Yb3+, Er3+). The structural and kinetic factors that govern the phase and shape evolution of NaYF4 crystals have been carefully studied, and the influence of NaF to RE3+ ratio on phase and morphology evolution was systematically investigated and discussed. It is found that the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+ can strongly control the size and structure of as-prepared β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ samples owing to the difference of capping effect of F− on the different crystal planes of β-NaYF4 microcrystals. By choosing bipyramidal β-NaYF4 microdisks as a candidate, the possible formation mechanism was proposed on the basis of XRD analysis and SEM observation of the products at the different reaction time periods. Most interestingly, the upconversion (UC) luminescent properties of β-NaYF4 crystals show that the optical properties of as-synthesized materials with different morphologies exhibit great distinction. This study is expected to be suggestive for the precisely controlled growth of other complex rare earth fluoride compounds and provide a reference for exploration of the morphology-dependent UC luminescence properties.1 IntroductionRecently, the precisely architectural manipulation of nano- or micromaterials with well-defined and controllable morphologies has attracted considerable attention because of the great potential for fundamental effects on morphology, dimensionality, and size on their physical, chemical, magnetic, and catalytic properties.1–3 So far, many efforts have been dedicated to exploring excellent approaches to the preparation of a variety of inorganic crystals with multiple shapes, including rods, tubes, boxes, cubes, octahedron, and whiskers.4–9 However, because of the complexity of crystal structures and compositions of inorganic functional materials, it is still a challenge for us to develop a facile approach to manipulate and control the morphologies of various inorganic crystals, accordingly achieving a better understanding of the observed complex phenomena of crystal growth and revealing the underlying fundamental theories and principles. So, development of a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly synthetic method has become more popular for obtaining inorganic crystals with controllable morphologies. As a typical solution-based approach, the hydrothermal method has proven to be an effective and convenient process in preparing various inorganic materials with diverse controllable morphologies and architectures.10,11 Herein, we will demonstrate the controlled growth of NaYF4 microcrystals with predictable phase and shape. Hexagonal NaYF4 microcrystals with controlled size and shape have been obtained through properly tuning dynamic parameters at different NaF to RE3+ (RE represents the total amount of Y3+ and the doped rare earth elements such as Yb3+, Er3+) ratio. All these can be achieved in a predictable way, which may be suggestive for the controlled growth of inorganic microcrystals, especially for those usually crystallizing in diverse crystal structures.Upconversion (UC) nano- and micro-materials have been extensively studied due to their potential applications in the fields of bioanalytics,12–14 solid-state lasers,15 optical communication,16 flat-plane displays,17,18 and solar cells.19,20 Among these host materials, rare-earth (RE) fluorides with the general formula NaREF4, possessing a high refractive index, low phonon energy and high chemical stability, have been regarded as excellent host matrices for UC luminescence.21–24 In these fluorides, NaYF4 is well-known as one of the most efficient hosts for performing multicolor UC emissions.25–27 The crystal structure of NaYF4 is known to exist in two polymorphic forms, namely, cubic (α-) and hexagonal (β-) phases, depending on the synthesis conditions and methods. Previous investigations have shown that the hexagonal polymorph exhibits considerable enhanced UC emission compared with the cubic polymorph.21,22 Therefore, how to obtain the pure hexagonal phase of NaYF4 is a very important consideration for high luminescence performance. Up to now, several approaches have been applied to synthesize β-NaYF4 structures, such as solid reaction,28,29 coprecipiation,30 molten salt,31,32 solvothermal,33–35 and hydrothermal methods.36–38 Compared with other methods, hydrothermal treatment has proven to be an effective and convenient process in preparing various inorganic materials with controllable morphologies and sizes. Monodisperse hexagonal NaYF4 nanocrystals with different morphologies have been synthesized by a hydrothermal process.39,40 However, it is limited to the investigation of the mechanisms underlying the shape and phase of NaYF4 microcrystals, which may give us a further understanding on the dynamic process governing nucleation and growth of the complex fluoride microcrystals.In this paper, we present a facile and effective hydrothermal route to control the morphologies of NaYF4 by simply tuning the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+. More specifically, we aim to investigate how structural and kinetic factors govern the shape and phase evolution of NaYF4 polymorphs. The mechanism of how the NaF to RE3+ ratio influences the anisotropic growth and the slenderness of NaYF4 is proposed. Taking bipyramidal β-NaYF4 microdisks as an example, the possible formation mechanism for the phase and morphology evolution process of NaYF4 is also presented. Furthermore, the upconversion luminescence properties of Yb3+, Er3+ ions pairs co-doped β-NaYF4 with different morphologies were also investigated in detail.2 Experimental section2.1 ChemicalsAll of the chemical reagents used are analytical grade and were received without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout. YCl3·6H2O (99.99%), YbCl3·6H2O (99.99%), ErCl3·6H2O (99.9%) were purchased from Beijing Founde Star Science & Technology Co., Ltd (China). NaF (98%), C6H5Na3O7·2H2O (99%) were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China).2.2 PreparationIn a typical procedure for the synthesis of NaYF4, 1.56 mmol YCl3·6H2O, 0.40 mmol YbCl3·6H2O, 0.04 mmol ErCl3·6H2O were firstly dissolved in 10 mL H2O with magnetic stirring to form the rare earth chloride solution. Then this solution was added into 20 mL aqueous solution containing 2 mmol trisodium citrate (Na3Cit) to form the metal–citrate complex. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, 30 mL aqueous solution containing different amounts (8, 10, 11, 12, 19, 22, 36 mmol) of NaF was introduced into the above solution. After additional agitation for 15 min, the as-obtained mixing solution was transferred into a Teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave, sealed, and maintained at 220 °C for 24 h. As the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol in sequence, and then dried in air at 80 °C for 12 h.2.3 CharacterizationPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a ARL X’TRA diffractometer at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). SEM micrographs were obtained using a field emission scanning electron transmission microscope (FE-SEM, SU8010, Hitachi). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded on a JEM-200CX with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. Images were acquired digitally on a Gatan multiple CCD camera. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) was taken on a Perkin-Elmer Optima-5300DV spectrometer. UC emission spectra were recorded with a Jobin yvon FL3-221 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a 980 nm laser diode Module (K98SA3M-54W, China) as the excitation source. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.3 Results and discussion3.1 Controlled synthesis of β-NaYF4 crystals with predictable size and shapeVarious shapes of hexagonal-phase NaYF4 microcrystals, such as microtubes, microspheres, microrods, micro-bipyramids, microplates, microprisms, can be controlled synthesized by varying the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+ (RE represents the total amount of Y3+ and the doped rare earth elements Yb3+, Er3+) in the aqueous model system when other synthetic parameters were set as reaction time 24 h, reaction temperature 220 °C, and Na3Cit 2 mmol. The XRD analysis results of these products obtained at different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+ are shown in Fig. 1. As shown, all crystals exhibit diffraction patterns corresponding to highly crystalline hexagonal-system NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 16-0334). The crystal structure of the hexagonal phase is determined with lattice parameters of a = 0.596 and c = 0.353 nm, space group P63/mmc. No other impurity peaks are detected in the XRD patterns, indicating that Y3+ ions have been replaced by Yb3+, Er3+ ions in any ratio with no effect on the crystallinity or phase change because of the similar radius of Y3+, Yb3+, Er3+ (rY3+ = 0.089 nm, rYb3+ = 0.086 nm, rY3+ = 0.088 nm). In addition, careful observation reveals that the relative peak strength of the XRD patterns switches with different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+, implying that the morphology evolution of the as-prepared β-NaYF4 crystals. Fig. 1  XRD patterns of hexagonal NaYF4 samples prepared with different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+: (a) NaF/RE3+ = 5; (b) NaF/RE3+ = 5.5; (c) NaF/RE3+ = 6; (d) NaF/RE3+ = 8; (e) NaF/RE3+ = 11; (f) NaF/RE3+ = 18. The typical FE-SEM images for β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ samples with tunable shapes and uniform size are shown in Fig. 2. At low molar ratios of NaF to RE3+ (NaF/RE3+ = 5), the SEM image in Fig. 2a reveals that β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ consists of uniform hollow hexagonal microtubes with 8.6 μm in length, 0.8 μm in diameter. The magnified SEM image shows a close-up review of one isolated microtube, which clearly displays the inside hollow and outside prismatic structure of the sample which have open ends with wall thickness from 200 to 400 nm. When the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+ is 5.5, microspheres with average diameter about 0.9 μm were obtained (Fig. 2b). At NaF/RE3+ = 6, the general image of β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ is shown in Fig. 2c. It clearly indicates that hexagonal microprisms with protruding centers and crown-like top end on the tops/bottoms side. Moreover, the mean size is calculated to be about 3.3 μm in diameter and 5.3 μm in length. At a medium molar ratio of NaF to RE3+ (NaF/RE3+ = 8), clam-like microcrystals with hexagonal cross-section can be prepared, which is shown in Fig. 2d. And it can be calculated that the average diameter is about 4.2 μm and the thickness is about 0.9 μm. When the experiment is performed at NaF:RE3+ = 11, the morphology of products is the hexagonal microplates with smooth surface, remarkable uniformity, and monodispersity. Analysis of a number of the microplates shows that these microcrystals have an average size of 2.9 μm in diameter and 1.3 μm in thickness. At high molar ratio of NaF/RE3+ (NaF/RE3+ = 18), the regular hexagonal microprisms shaped β-NaYF4 crystals with an average size of 1.9 μm in length and 1.6 μm in diameter are observed from Fig. 2f. From the above-mentioned investigations, it can be seen that the morphology of products can be tuned from microtubes, microspheres, microrods, micro-bipyramids, microplates to microprisms by changing the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+. The corresponding morphologies and dimensions as well as aspect ratios of the products obtained at different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+ are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2  FE-SEM images of hexagonal NaYF4 samples prepared with different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+: (A) NaF/RE3+ = 5; (B) NaF/RE3+ = 5.5; (C) NaF/RE3+ = 6; (D) NaF/RE3+ = 8; (E) NaF/RE3+ = 11; (F) NaF/RE3+ = 18.

Taking a fundamental understanding about the evolution process and deriving a general law about the crystal growth allows us to synthesize β-NaYF4 microcrystals with tunable size and shape. As is known to all, the hexagonal crystals system has four crystal axes: assistant axes and principle axis (c axis). Three assistant axes intersect with each other at a skew angle of 60° in a plane surface, while the principle axis is perpendicular to the plane41–43 (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). According to the general principle of crystal growth, the growth of crystals is related to the relative growth rate of different crystal axes and the difference in the growth rates of various crystal axes results in a different outlook of the crystallite. In general, facets perpendicular to the fast directions of the relative rates of growth have smaller surfaces areas and slow growing faces therefore dominating the morphology. In the case of the β-NaYF4 hexagonal prism shape, the surfaces are typically {0001} for top/bottom planes and a family of six energetically equivalent {10−10} prismatic side planes [(1010), (−1010), (0−110), (0−110), (1−100), and (−1100)] on the basis of the similar models.44,45 When the crystal growth on the directions of the c axis ([0001]) is slower than the growth rate on the direction of the assistant axes, the crystal takes on a hexagonal plate morphology. Otherwise, the crystal is likely to be a long rod or tube at the condition that the growth rate along the c axis is much quicker than the growth rate along the plane surface. According to the results, it can be inferred that the growth rate at different directions of β-NaYF4 could be affected by the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+.In our experiments, NaF is in excess compared with RE3+ and the excessive F− ions inevitably cap the surface of crystals because of the strong coordination effect between F− and RE3+ ions. According to the Gibbs–Thompson theory, the relative chemical potential of a crystal is simply proportional to its surface–atom ratio, determined by the average number of dangling bonds per atom over the entire crystal.41,46 The capping effect of F− could decrease the average number of dangling bonds and further decrease the chemical potential of the crystal, as well as the crystal planes. Detailed observation on the crystal structure of β-NaYF4 indicates that the RE3+ ions density on the different crystal planes is varied. For example, when the density of RE3+ on the {10−10} crystal plane is bigger than the density of RE3+ on the {0001} crystal plane, it results in the capping effect of F− on the {10−10} crystal plane being greater than on the {0001} plane. So the chemical potential of the (10−10) crystal plane decreases dramatically while that of the (0001) crystal plane increases accordingly. As a result, the relative growth rate along [0001] is much quicker than that along [10−10], resulting in microrods with a longer length and higher aspect ratio. Moreover, the chemical potential of different crystal planes can be modified, and the relative growth ratios on different directions could be affected by different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+, finally leading to different crystal morphologies.3.2 Growth mechanisms of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystalsFor a better understanding of the formation processes of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals with different morphologies, reaction samples are carefully investigated by quenching the reaction at different time intervals. Although we know that the reaction doesn’t stop immediately after the autoclave is removed from the heater owing to heat transfer, we do believe that the samples obtained at that time represent certain stages in the formation process.Here, β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ micro-bipyramids are used as representative to investigate the phase and morphology evolution in detail. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ prepared for different reaction times as well as standard data of α-NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 77-2042) and β-NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 28-1192) phases for comparison. It indicates that the samples display distinctively different XRD patterns at different reaction times. As shown in Fig. 3a, only the cubic (α) NaYF4 phase can be obtained for 3 h. When the reaction time is increased to 4 h, a new hexagonal (β) NaYF4 phase emerges in addition to the α-NaYF4 phase, as shown in Fig. 3b. This reveals that the samples transform partially from the cubic phase to the hexagonal phase (α → β) with further reaction. Pure hexagonal β-NaYF4 can be successfully obtained when the reaction time is increased from 8 h to 24 h. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of these samples are shown in Fig. 3c–f, where the diffraction peaks also match well with those calculated for hexagonal NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 28-1192). Moreover, the intensities of the diffraction peaks increase significantly with increasing reaction time, implying that the crystallinity of the sample increases with further reaction. On the basis of the above analyses, it can be concluded that the crystal evolves from the cubic phase to the mixed phase and ultimately to the hexagonal phase with increasing reaction time. Fig. 3  XRD patterns for NaYF4 samples (NaF/RE3+ = 8) as a function of reaction time. (a) 3 h, (b) 4 h, (c) 8 h, (d) 12 h, (e) 24 h, (f) 48 h. The standard data of cubic α-NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 77-2042) and β-NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 28-1192) are given as a reference. It is interesting to find that the sample obtained at 4 h exhibits two different morphologies. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, nanoparticles (region A) and micro-bipyramids (region B) are observed clearly. To provide a further insight into these particles with different morphologies, TEM investigation and EDS analysis are also performed. The TEM image in Fig. 4d reveals that the sample consists of uniform and well-dispersed nanocrystals with a diameter about 30 nm, agreeing with the FE-SEM images. In HRTEM image, the clear lattice fringes confirm the high crystallinity, which agrees well with the XRD results. The determined interplanar distances of 0.32 nm between the adjacent lattice planes agrees well with the d111 spacing of cubic NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 77-2042). In addition, the SAED pattern in Fig. 4(f) shows spotty polycrystalline diffraction rings, which can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of the cubic NaYF4 lattice. Moreover, the EDS in Fig. S2† shows a characteristic intensity profile of Na, Y, Yb, Er and F elements. From the SEM image (Fig. 4b) and TEM image (Fig. 4g), we can see clearly the hexagonal bipyramidal structure of the crystals with a rough surface, whose mean diameter and height are 1.1 μm and 0.3 μm, respectively. The obvious lattice fringes in the HRTEM image (Fig. 4h) confirm the high crystallinity of the micro-bipyramids, which agree well with the XRD results. The interplanar distance between adjacent lattice planes is determined as ~0.29 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing value of the (110) plane of hexagonal NaYF4 (JCPDS No. 28-1192) in the P63/m space group. Moreover, the SAED pattern in Fig. 4i can be directly indexed to the reflection of the hexagonal NaYF4 structure. The clear lattice and the sharp diffraction spots both reveal the single crystalline nature of the micro-bipyramids. The EDS (Fig. S3 in the ESI†) also indicates the presence of Na, Y, Yb, Er, and F elements. On the basis of the above analysis, it can be concluded that these crystals with different morphologies are cubic NaYF4 (nanoparticles) and hexagonal NaYF4 (micro-bipyramids), respectively. Fig. 4  FE-SEM images with low magnification (a), high magnification (b), TEM image of the sample obtained at 4 h; TEM image (d), HRTEM image (e), SAED (f) of nanoparticles; TEM image (g), HRTEM image (h), and SAED (i) of micro-bipyramids. At the same time, the morphologies of the samples are carefully investigated by quenching the reaction at different time intervals. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of the NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ crystals prepared with different reaction times. It is apparent that the six samples present notably different morphologies during the crystal growth. Through a set of experiments, a possible phase and morphology evolution mechanism is shown in Scheme 1 and described as follows. At the early stage, the Cit3− anions introduced into the reaction system can form complexes with RE3+ (RE = Y3+, Yb3+, Er3+) ions through strong coordination interaction. The chelating ability of the RE3+–Cit3− complexes would be weakened under the conditions of high temperature and pressure during the hydrothermal process, resulting that the RE3+ ions would be released gradually. Then Na+ and F− ions in the solution react with RE3+ to generate small nuclei. In a very short reaction time, these nuclei can only grow into cubic-phased NaREF4, which are irregular nanoparticles (Fig. 4a). The cubic NaREF4 seeds have isotropic unit cell structures, inducing an isotropic growth of particles. Therefore, spherical particles are observed in order to minimize the surface energy of the crystal facets. However, these α-NaREF4 particles are unstable and phase transformation (α → β) takes place through a dissolution–renucleation process to form stable β-NaREF4 when the reaction time is increased to 4 h (Fig. 4b). So β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ microdisks as well as a little amount of α-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ nanoparticles can be obtained. It is clear that a small amount of seeds on the surface of β-NaYF4 microdisks exists. The coexistence of two shapes results from the presence of the mixture crystal phases in the corresponding XRD patterns. With the reaction proceeding for only 8 h, the fairly uniform well-defined β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ microdisks with an average length of 3 μm and a thickness of 0.4 μm are produced on a large scale (Fig. 4c). As the reaction time extends to 12 h, monodisperse β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ microdisks with micro-bipyramids morphology can be achieved (Fig. 4d). For varying the geometry of a disk, the parameters used are thickness (H) and width (W). With further reaction, from 12 h to 48 h, the crystal shape changes from bicapped disks to bicapped drums. Both H and W values of these crystals tend to be larger with increasing reaction time but the increase in H, and thus the aspect ratio, changes substantially as seen by FE-SEM micrographs. Fig. 5  SEM images for NaYF4 samples (NaF/RE3+ = 8) as a function of reaction time. (a) 3 h, (b) 4 h, (c) 8 h, (d) 12 h, (e) 24 h, (f) 48 h.  Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the proposed formation and evolution process of the β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ micro-bipyramids. We also investigated the growth process of β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ crystals with other morphologies (microtubes, microspheres, microrods, microplates, and microprisms). As can be seen from the XRD patterns (Fig. S4–S8†), these crystals exhibit very similar phase transformation processes to that of β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ micro-bipyramids. Moreover, the FE-SEM images (Fig. S9–S13†) also reveal a similar phase transformation process (α → β) to β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ micro-bipyramids. Scheme 2 shows the possible formation mechanism of the NaYF4 with different morphologies under different experimental conditions. It is noted that in previous work we have found that the kinetic product (α-NaREF4) is formed as the intermediate phase at an earlier solution stage and then transformed to the thermodynamically stable product (β-NaREF4) through a redissolution and re-growth process. A similar phenomenon takes place in our current system and the conversion from cubic to hexagonal phase directly results in the dramatic morphology changes of the products. The cubic α-NaREF4 seeds have isotropic unit cell structures, which generally induce the isotropic growth of particles, leading to spherical particles. In contrast, the hexagonal-phased β-NaREF4 possesses an anisotropic unit cell structure, which leads to an anisotropic growth along crystallographically reactive directions, resulting in the formation of hexagonal-shaped structure with different morphologies. Scheme 2  Schematic procedure of the formation of hexagonal phase NaYF4 crystals synthesized with different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+. 3.3 UC luminescence propertiesTo investigate the UC luminescence properties of the β-NaYF4 products with different morphologies, Yb3+, Er3+ were selected as co-doped ions to form β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ crystals. It should be noted that the very small amount of doping lanthanide ions (Yb3+, Er3+) did not change the crystal structure and morphology of the host materials. In addition, the detailed chemical compositions analyzed by ICP-OES measurements are summarized in Table 1. The results also show that Yb3+ and Er3+ ions could be doped into the NaYF4 lattice completely. Under 980 nm LD excitation, the UC emission spectra of β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ crystals synthesized by different molar ratios of NaF to RE3+ are shown in Fig. 6A and 6B, respectively. It can be seen clearly that the six samples exhibit quite different emission intensities yet with the same emission bands centered at 521, 539 and 654 nm, which can be assigned to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ion, respectively.26,47Fig. 6C shows the intensities of green and red emission under 980 nm LD excitation. As shown, the β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ microprisms (NaF:RE3+ = 18:1) present the most intense emissions with the largest peak height. The ranking of the emission intensities is NYF-6 (NaF/RE3+ = 18, violet) > NYF-1 (NaF/RE3+ = 5, black) > NYF-5 (NaF/RE3+ = 11, olive) >NYF-4 (NaF/RE3+ = 8, magenta) > NYF-2 (NaF/RE3+ = 5.5, red)> NYF-3 (NaF/RE3+ = 11, blue). Although the exact reason is unclear at present, we can provide the following explanation for this morphology-dependent photoluminescence enhancement. First, it is well known that the surface area of the materials increases with a decrease in the size. The large surface area usually introduces a large number of defects into the crystals, resulting in producing serious drawbacks for phosphors by providing non-radiative recombination routes for electrons and holes in hosts. Therefore, a phosphor with fewer defects will show a great improvement in the luminescent intensity by reducing the surface area of the optical materials.48–50 Compared to microtubes, microspheres, microrods, micro-bipyramids, and microplates, microprisms have the smallest surface area and high crystallinity without visible defects and dislocations which may lead to significant luminescence enhancement. Second, the intensity of luminescence lines of lanthanide-doped materials is known to depend on the orientation of the unique crystal axis relative to the polarization vector of the incident light.51,52 The preferred growth trend of microtubes along the [0001] axes is the strongest, which can contribute to the increased luminescent efficiency. So β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ microtubes have a strong emission intensity, although microtubes possess a high surface area. The output colors change from green to green–yellow with increasing molar ratios of NaF to RE3+, which can be ascribed to the different intensities of the green and red emission bands in the six samples (Fig. 6C). As presented in Fig. 6D, the peak area ratio of the red region (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) to the green region (2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) increases from 0.39 to 1.24 with an increment of molar ratio of NaF to RE3+. The increase in the ratio of red to green emission might be due to the increase in the nonradiative transition probability of 2H11/2 → 4F9/2 and 4S3/2 → 4F9/2, which is most probably ascribed to the different amounts of surface impurities (such as –OH or other groups with vibrational modes of high energy) in various morphologies.53,54 On the basis of the analysis above, the impurities on the surface of the crystals increase incrementally with the molar ratio of NaF to RE3+, inducing the increase of ratio of red to green emission.

In order to deeply investigate the involved UC mechanism in β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, the excitation power-dependent UC emissions of green (521 nm, 539 nm) and red (654 nm) were calculated. It is well known that the output UC luminescent intensity (IUC) is proportional to the infrared excitation power (IIR): IUC ∝ InIR, where n is the absorbed photon numbers per visible photon emitted, and its value can be obtained from the slope of the fitted line of the plot of log(IUC) versus log(IIR).55 As shown in Fig. 6E, the slopes of the linear fit of log(IUC) versus log(IIR) for the 521, 539, and 654 nm emissions in the six samples are 2.01, 1.92, and 1.86, respectively. The results indicate that only a two -photon process is involved to produce the green and red UC emissions, which is in agreement with previous reports. Based on the results, the proposed UC energy transfer process in β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ under 980 nm LD excitation is shown in Fig. 6F and briefly described as follows:56,57 Firstly, the electron of Yb3+ is excited from 2F7 to 2F5 level in β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystals under 980 nm LD excitation. And then the energy of the excited electron is transferred to Er3+ ions. Through a two- or three-photon UC process, the ground state electrons of Er3+ are excited to 4F7/2 levels. For Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 sample, the excited electron in 4F7/2 decays nonradiatively to the level of 2H11/2, 4S3/2, 4F9/2. The green and red luminescence is observed by these transitions from each level aforementioned to 4I15/2. So the green and green–yellow emission of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ samples with different morphologies can be seen by the naked eye (Fig. 6G).4 ConclusionThrough the simple manipulation of the NaF to RE3+ ratio, we obtained β-NaYF4 microtubes, microspheres, microrods, micro-bipyramids, microplates, and microprisms. A mechanism for how the NaF to RE3+ ratio influences the anisotropic growth and the morphology evolution of hexagonal NaYF4 is proposed. And then, the phase and morphology evolution process as well as the formation mechanism are discussed in detail. In addition, the UC luminescence properties of β-NaYF4:20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+ crystals with different morphologies were well investigated under 980 nm laser diode excitation. It is found that the UC luminescence properties of the as-synthesized materials are dependent on the size and morphology. These results not only provide important information for crystal growth and morphology-controlled synthesis of other rare earth fluoride compounds, but also assist in the understanding of the morphology-dependent UC luminescence properties.AcknowledgementsThis project has been financially supported by the Key University Science Research Project of Jiangsu Province (No. 10KJA430016), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 20901040/B0111), the Innovation Foundation for Graduate Students of Jiangsu Province China (CXLX11_0355), and a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).Notes and referencesA.
