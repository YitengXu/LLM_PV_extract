    , Accepted 25th March 2023First published on 28th March 2023AbstractThe study developed a trifunctional electrocatalyst in which Mo provides Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB complexes with versatile multifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400 can serve as an electrocatalyst for the ORR, while Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600 and Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-300 are promising for the OER and HER. The Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400/C electrodes exhibited good discharge power density in the Zn–air battery, outperforming both commercial Pt/C and Pt/C + RuO2. The HER and OER overpotentials at 100 mA cm−2 of current density for Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB complexes are superior to those of well-developed noble electrocatalysts. The tunable electrocatalytic activity of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB opens an avenue for designing low-cost trifunctional electrocatalysts and can be applied for the Zn–air battery and alkaline water splitting.
Introduction
Low carbon emissions are essential to reduce greenhouse gases, and green hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis via renewable power-to-gas applications has been promoted for this purpose.1 Renewable energy sources (solar cells, wind, and hydro-energy) combined with water electrolysis are important for developing environmentally friendly hydrogen production to replace current hydrogen production methods based on polluting fuels. Water electrolysis technologies include alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC).2 However, these types of electrolysis have various disadvantages, limiting their development. For example, AWE has low current density, leading to the use of extremely large electrolyzers, PEMWE requires large amounts of platinum electrodes, and SOEC requires high operating temperatures. In contrast, AWE technology has the advantages of being a mature technology, using non-noble metal catalysts (e.g., nickel, cobalt, iron), and providing high long-term stability due to its exchangeable electrolytes and high hydrogen production rate.3 Therefore, the best electrocatalysts should have lower overpotentials for the OER and HER and increased energy efficiency.
Noble metal electrocatalysts, such as platinum-supported carbon (Pt/C) and Pt–Ru alloys/C, have been applied for the ORR and HER. RuO2 and IrO2 are usually applied for the OER. Nevertheless, obtaining high-energy powers and high-gas evolution, which need to prepare a hung-scale area electrode, led to more noble metal electrocatalysts loading on an electrode and incurs high costs for both Zn–air batteries or water electrolysis.
Metallic Zn anodes do not react violently in the presence of moisture in the air and are very safe. Therefore, it is valuable to apply Zn–air batteries with advantages such as low cost, abundant raw materials, higher energy density, and environmental friendliness.4 The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of electrocatalysts are the primary requirements for the applied anode of the Zn–air battery.5 To replace the noble metal (Pt/C) used in anodes, many cheaper electrocatalysts6–11 have been developed.
Trifunctional electrocatalytic electrocatalysts can satisfy the requirements for the HER/OER of water splitting and the OER/ORR of Zn–air batteries. This approach does not require synthesizing two or three different materials, decreasing costs and manufacturing complexities. However, trifunctional electrocatalyst preparation is challenging, which has led to much research on both single and bifunctional electrocatalysts. Electrocatalysts with metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) structures have been used in the ORR, OER, and HER due to their optimal electronic and geometric structures with active metal centers, leading to highly effective catalytic activity.12,13 Metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) structures involving organometallic/inorganic hybrid complexes, including metal Schiff base (M–SBs) complexes,14 metal phthalocyanines,15 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)16 with metal–N coordination, can adequately prevent the migration of metal atoms.17 However, the structures of M–SBs complexes differ from those of the others, and are synthesized using the azomethine groups (–RCN–) of Schiff base ligands coordinated with various metal ions.18 The formation of the diverse structures of Schiff bases depends on the reaction of the amine structure with carbonyl groups containing ligands in condensation reactions. M–SBs and SBs have been widely investigated for inhibitory antibacterial activities,19 antifungal properties,20 and enzymatic activity,21 among other applications. A few M–SBs have been used with various electrolytes. For example, Co–SBs have high catalytic activity for the HER in the electrolyte 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate.22 Moreover, Ni(II) and Cu(II)–SBs are efficient for electrocatalytic HER in acetonitrile.14 Molybdenum–SBs23 and copper(II)–SBs24 are used for the HER in organic acid solution and the ORR in KCl solution. Therefore, M–SBs have many applications in electrochemistry, especially for trifunctional electrocatalysts.
In previous studies, Fe–Cu–N4 electrocatalysts have been prepared and studied for the ORR, OER, and HER in Zn–air batteries and water splitting.25 However, their HER activity is lower than that of commercial 20% Pt/C. Furthermore, the preparation process of Fe–Cu–N4 electrocatalysts is lengthy and complex. Thus, this study seeks to overcome these disadvantages by developing a convenient and universal approach to synthesizing ternary metal (Fe–Cu–Mo)–SBs. Simultaneously, the key points of preparing novel ternary metal SBs and confirming their multi-functional electrochemical characteristics are addressed. The results indicate that the ternary metal SBs provide stable trifunctional electrocatalysis, which is better than that of other metal SBs with single-functional or bifunctional electroactivity. Although in many reports, the HER and OER performance is defined by the current density at 10 mA cm−2, this does not satisfy the electrolysis requirements for industry, which require current densities as large as 200 mA cm−2. Typical commercial alkali electrolyzers work at current densities between 200 and 500 mA cm−2.26 Therefore, this study highlights the electrocatalytic activity of these novel Fe–Cu–Mo–SBs materials for the OER and HER at densities greater than 10 mA cm−2. The electrocatalytic activities of Fe–Cu–Mo–SBs are increased by optimizing the Mo contact and heating temperatures, and are evaluated to obtain best electrocatalytic properties in Zn–air batteries and alkaline water splitting.
Results and discussion
Structural and morphological characterizations
Unheated SBs were synthesized from the condensation reaction of BTC and TETA in ethanol at room temperature. The SBs can act as a chelating agent27 to react with the Fe, Cu, and Mo precursors and produce unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB. To confirm Scheme 1, FTIR was used to demonstrate the structures of the unheated SBs and unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB, as shown in Fig. 1. The prominent characteristic ν(CN) peaks of the azomethine group of the unheated SBs appeared at 1614 cm−1.28,29 Other peaks were observed at 518 (C–N), 721 (C–H bending), 750 (NH wag, primary), 904 and 927 (H2O stretching of coordinated water), 1022 (C–H bending), 1066 (C–O alcohol group), 1278 (CO, carbonyl group), 1356 (C–N–C), 1433 (ν(COOH), carboxylic acid groups), 1502 (C–C, stretching in the aromatic ring), 1567 (CC of aromatic rings), 1704 (ν(CO) vibration), 3017 (C–H, aromatic), and 3395 cm−1 (ν(N–H), –NH2). The 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz) spectrum shows peaks at chemical shifts (δ, ppm) of 8.78–8.49 ppm (1, 1H, s, –NH), 7.58–7.47 ppm (2, 3H, m, Ar–H), 3.41–3.45 (3, 1H, m, –OH), 3.28 (5, 2H, d, NCH2), 3.12–3.13 (4, 2H, d, –CH2), 3.01–3.09 (4, 2H, s, –CH2), 2.93–2.97 (4, 2H, m, –CH2), and 2.50–2.54 (5, 2H, m, NCH2), as shown in Fig. S1.† In Fig. S2,† the 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz) spectrum exhibits peaks at chemical shifts (δ, ppm) of 167.38–167.66 (1, CN–), 139.28 (2, CCH–), 132.61–133.66 (3, CCH–), 39.0–40.0 (4, CH2–N), and 45.04–45.43 (5, –CH2–). In addition, the 17O NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz) had one peak at a chemical shift (δ, ppm) of 12.61 ppm, which is –OHas, as shown in Fig. S3.†

When the unheated SBs chelated with Fe, Cu, and Mo ions to form unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB, the FTIR spectrum revealed that the SB peak at 518 cm−1 (C–N stretching) shifted to 571 cm−1 (Fe–N, Cu–N and Mo–N vibrations) and 3204 cm−1 (νN–H of the hydrazine group), demonstrating the coordination of the amine groups with the metals.30 The CN peak (725 cm−1) of the azomethine group was observed due to the withdrawal of electron density from the nitrogen atom, indicating the coordination of the NH group (750 cm−1) from SB to the metal ions. In addition, the CO stretching (1278 cm−1) of SB is shifted toward 1245 cm−1 of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB, indicating the linkage between the carboxylic acid group (COOH−) and metal ion (Fe3+, Cu2+, and Mo6+) that led to metal oxide bonding of ν(M–O) vibrations at 644 cm−1 displacement. The positive shift of the COOH– peak of the Schiff base at 1433 cm−1 to 1441 cm−1 also confirmed the linkage between the metal ion and carboxylate oxygen atom.31
The XRD patterns of the unheated SBs and unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB are shown in Fig. 2(a), and their crystalline structures are challenging to identify due to the various metallic oxide and amine compounds. These required further analysis, and the XRD results were used to determine the structures of the unheated SBs and unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB. For the unheated SBs, the XRD results indicated the orthorhombic structure of cyanogen (NCCN) (72-0497) 2θ = 23.7 (111) and 32.6 (121) as well as carbon nitride (C3N4) (87-1522) 2θ = 24.81 (101), 27.61 (110), and 38.55 (002). The appearance of crystallinity in unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB is due to the crystalline nature of the metallic compounds that depend on SB with metallic compounds, which also produces some metal oxide, metal nitrogen, and cubic iron–molybdenum oxide structures. The XRD pattern indicated CuO (JCPDS 74-1021) 2θ = 35.96, 38.67, 39.48, 49.16; FeO (JCPDS 77-2355) 2θ = 41.91; MoO3 (JCPDS 85-2405) 2θ = 23.55, 25.77, 27.51, 29.1, 33.64; Mo2N (75-1150) 2θ = 43.06; Fe2N (JCPDS 76-0090), and Cu3N (JCPDS 86-2284) 2θ = 40.85; C3N4 (JCPDS 87-1525) 2θ = 45.83; Fe2MoO4 (JCPDS 73-0236) 2θ = 34.69. The results confirm that various metals react with N-containing compounds, forming some compounds such as MOx nanoparticles, monodispersed, and aggregated M–Nx in unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB. Therefore, identifying the active sites for unheated SBs and unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB is a significant challenge, and the Fe–N–C catalyst had the same challenge.32 Fortunately, the unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB complexes have better thermal stability (a) as shown in Fig. 2(b), and their SEM images are displayed in Fig. 2(c) and (d).

Effect of Mo content on electrochemical performance
The electrocatalytic ORR, OER, and HER performance of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C and unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C were evaluated. The CV results showed that both complexes have a well-defined cathodic peak with a similar voltage at about 0.59 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), as shown in Fig. 3(a). All the ORR peaks had slightly a less negative potential than that of Pt/C (0.62 V). The ORR activities of the electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes using RRDE were further evaluated by collecting the H2O2% generated, Tafel slope, and n change, as shown in Fig. 3(b)–(e). Table 1 shows the performances, including the half-wave potential (E1/2), onset potential (Eonset), hydrogen peroxide selectivity (%H2O2), and number of electrons transferred (n) at a representative disk potential of 0.4 V vs. RHE. Eonset is the potential corresponding to a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 for the measurement with the electrode spinning at 1600 rpm in a steady-state RRDE experiment. E1/2 is the potential at which the polarization curve current equals half the diffusion current. The results indicated that the highest percentage of produced H2O2 and the lowest n were obtained by unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C, with an ORR activity lower than that of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C. The results showed that mixing Mo into Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB could improve the ORR activity. The n value of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C is approximately 4, which is close to that of the Pt/C catalyst. The Tafel slope of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C was 111.11 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3(b)), which was slightly higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst at 107.39 mV dec−1, indicating an efficient four-electron pathway during the ORR process. These results suggest that combining Mo with Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB has a significant role in boosting the ORR activity.

An OER overpotential of 690 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4(a)) and Tafel slope of 57.61 mV dec−1 (Fig. 4(b)) were obtained from unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C, which were better than those of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C (1150 mV and 63.04 mV dec−1). Simultaneously, the Nyquist plot shows that unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C has a smaller Rct than unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C (Fig. 4(c)), implying lower charge transfer resistance and faster kinetics that enhance electrochemical performance. The Cdl of 9.12 mF cm−2 (Fig. 4(d)) indicated an ECSA of 31.5 cm2 on unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C, which was larger than that of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C with an ECSA of 17.25 cm2, suggesting that unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C had more exposed catalytically active sites during the OER. Moreover, the HER overpotential and Tafel slope of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C are also lower than those of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C (Fig. 4(e) and (f)). RuO2 and Pt/C have lower overpotentials of 560 mV and 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and smaller Tafel slopes of 55.22 mV dec−1 and 38.35 mV dec−1 for the OER and HER. However, when the current density exceeded 20 mA cm−2, the HER overpotential of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C was better than that of Pt/C. This result indicates that the addition of Mo to Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB can improve the performance of the OER and HER, as demonstrated by some reports.33,34

The above results summarize the ORR, OER, and HER performance of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB and unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB, as shown in Fig. 5. The electrocatalytic activity of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB is substantially better than that of unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB. Mo imparts Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB/C with enhanced ORR, OER, and HER performance. Molybdenum (Mo) is important because of its half-filled d-electron shell.35 This could be because the Mo–Nx formed and contained in the unheated Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C structures provides chemical modification that further improves the ORR performance,34 and the preferred type of oxygen adsorption on it contributes to higher activity for the ORR.36 Moreover, the electronic states associated with the Mo–Nx and the suitable local geometry of the Mo sites facilitate oxygen adsorption, as confirmed by density functional theory.36 In addition, the formation of MoO3 in Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB can improve the OER and HER performance due to the oxygen vacancies of MoO3, which support catalytic behavior.37 Another reason could be the synergistic interaction between Fe–Nx, Cu–Nx, and Mo–Nx of trimetal–Nx, leading to an interaction lowering the d band center of Mo, which decreases the Mo–Hads bond38 and thus facilitates the HER. According to the ORR, OER, and HER results, the Mo contained in Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB can have increased activity, leading to better ORR, OER, and HER performance. Furthermore, the synergistic interactions in trimetal–Nx have a critical role in the electrocatalytic process, improving the surface area with more active sites and enhanced electrical conductivity for faster charge transfer,39 yielding excellent ORR/OER/HER catalytic performance.

Effect of different heating temperatures on Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB
Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB electrocatalysts were heated at different temperatures, which increased their electrochemical performance for the ORR, OER, and HER. For the ORR, comparing the CV and RRDE curves, it is difficult to distinguish the differences in the ORR peak (Fig. S4†), Eonset (Fig. 6(a)), and E1/2 (Fig. 6(a)) for Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB heated at different temperatures. Fortunately, the lowest Tafel slope (93.82) in Fig. 6(b), lowest H2O2% (5.18 at 0.4 V) in Fig. 6(c), and higher n value (3.94) in Fig. 6(d) were obtained using Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB heated at 400 °C (referred to as Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400). For the OER, Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB heated at 600 °C (Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600) exhibited a smaller overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7(a)), smaller Tafel slope of 57.61 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7(b)), lower Rct (Fig. 7(c)), and higher Cdl value of 2.56 mF cm−2 (ECSA of 64 cm2) (Fig. 7(d)) than other heating temperatures. For the HER, Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB heated to 300 °C (Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-300) obtained a smaller overpotential of 500 mV at 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7(e)), and smaller Tafel slope of 41.31 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7(f)). In addition, when the current density was more significant than 30 mA cm−2 for the OER and 20 mA cm−2 for the HER, their overpotentials were smaller than those of RuO2 and Pt/C. The results indicate that water splitting at higher current density using these materials can be better than that of novel electrocatalysts.

The XPS survey spectra reveal the presence of Fe, Cu, Mo, N, C, and O in Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB on heating at different temperatures (Fig. 8), which can explain some critical effects for the ORR, OER, and HER. The satellite peaks at 714.3–714.8 eV for each electrocatalyst were associated with Fe2+,40 as shown in Fig. 8(a). Two peaks of Fe2+ were observed at 710.1–710.3 V (Fe 2p3/2) and 722.5–722.7 (Fe 2p1/2), and the other two peaks at 712.2–712.3 eV of (Fe 2p3/2) and 724.8–725.0 eV (Fe 2p1/2) were associated with Fe3+ supplied by Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB at temperatures up to 600 °C. The Fe2+ peaks contributed by iron oxide and the Fe3+ peaks suggest the formation of the Fe–Nx structures.41 However, when Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB is heated to 700 °C, the two peaks of Fe2+ are negatively shifted, indicating that the iron is subjected to more oxidation, reducing the electrocatalytic activity.

For each electrocatalyst, the XPS of Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 showed that the Cu2+ peaks at 934.6 eV and 954.3 eV (Fig. 8(b)) depend on the existence of CuO42 in the electrocatalysts. The 932.5 eV and 952.1 eV peaks correspond to Cu2O, and the 935.9 eV and 955.9 eV peaks are due to Cu(OH)2. The Mo 3d XPS (Fig. 8(c)) consists of 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 double peaks due to coupling orbital and spin motions. Without heating and with heating to 200 °C, Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB exhibited Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 peaks of Mo5+ at 233.99 and 230.61 eV, and Mo6+ peaks at 235.35 and 232.21 eV. These results indicate that MoNx42 and MoOx43,44 structures could be present in the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB electrocatalysts. When the heating temperature was increased from 300 °C to 600 °C, the Mo5+ peaks disappeared, and Mo6+ peaks were formed, indicating MoO3 structure formation in the electrocatalysts. Moreover, at a heating temperature of 700 °C, the formation of metallic Mo gave rise to peaks at 227.4 and 231.0 eV.45 However, metallic Mo has lower catalytic activity than Fe,35 reducing the density and destroying metal–Nx active sites,17 decreasing electrocatalytic performance.
More efforts were devoted to understanding the improvement in the electrocatalytic performance of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB heated to different temperatures in terms of the nitrogen-doped M–N–C graphene structures, such as pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized N,46 and metal–N structures. The successful doping of N atoms into the graphene lattice structures can be confirmed by N 1s XPS, which exhibited pyridinic-N at 398.3 eV, pyrrolic-N at 400.1 eV, graphitic-N at 401.2 eV, and oxidized N at 403.7 eV, as shown in Fig. 8(d). These bonding energies were the same as those reported by Wang et al.46 Moreover, the atom areas% for different heating temperatures are shown in Table 2. When the heating temperature was 300 °C, the pyridinic-N structure had the largest atom area%, leading to the best HER performance. A pyridinic-N structure can facilitate electron transfer45 and inhibit the adsorption of OH*,46 thus remarkably facilitating HER electrocatalysis. The pyridinic-N exhibits higher chemical activity and tends to trap the transition metal atoms Fe, Cu, and Mo.47 Therefore, each electrocatalyst showed a metal–N (Fe–N, Cu–N, and Mo–N in Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB) peak with a bonding energy of 399.2 eV.48 The largest metal-N atom area% was obtained when Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB was heated to 400 °C, accompanied by increased pyrrolic-N atom area%. This result could indicate that some of the N atoms of the pyridinic-N structure at 400 °C were transformed into metal–N and pyrrolic-N structures. More metal–N structures promote the donation of electrons to oxygen molecules and induce more oxygen intermediate bonding, thus remarkably facilitating ORR electrocatalysis.49 In addition, metal–Nx sites are the active centers in catalyzing ORR to improve intrinsic activity and enhance active site density.50 The graphitic-N area% increased with the higher temperature, and the temperature of 700 °C yielded the largest graphitic N area%. However, the oxidized N structure also formed with 50.8% area, affecting the density of pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, or metal–N active sites, reducing the electrochemical performance.

The C 1s spectrum of the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB reveals two characteristic peaks at 284.8 and 285.5, corresponding to C–C and C–N, respectively, for each heating temperature (Fig. 8(e)). The binding energy of 288.5 for CO for a heating temperature of 200 °C positively shifted to 288.5 (300 °C) and 288.9 (400–600 °C) with increasing temperature. At a heating temperature of 700 °C, there is a peak with a binding energy of 289.3 eV corresponding to O–CO formation, indicating a higher degree of reduction with increasing the annealing temperature.
The O 1s of XPS shows a peak with a binding energy at 528.9 eV corresponding to FeO formation for heating temperatures between 500 °C and 700 °C (Fig. 8(f)). Furthermore, the FeO area% at 600 °C is larger than that at 500 °C or 700 °C. According to the mechanism of the OER, one step, MO (metal oxide) + OH− → MOOH + e−,49 led to FeO producing more FeOOH, and further reaction according to MOOH + OH− → M + O2 + H2O + e− (ref. 51) produced more oxygen. The results confirm that the best OER activity is achieved at 600 °C.
Based on the above XPS results, the ORR, OER, and HER performance were improved by Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB structures containing metal oxides (FeOx, CuOx, and, MoOx), metal nitrogen (FeNx, CuNx, and MoNx), and nitrogen-doped graphene (pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N) forming some synergistic effects.52
Zn–air battery performance
The Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400/C electrode of the Zn–air battery demonstrated a maximum discharge power density of 103.15 mW cm−2 at 177.23 mA cm−2 and 0.59 V, which is higher than that of both the commercial Pt/C electrode (66.22 mW cm−2 at 128.09 mA cm−2 and 0.51 V) and the Pt/C + RuO2 (47.72 mW cm−2 at 101.53 mA cm−2 and 0.47 V) electrode in Zn–air batteries, as shown in Fig. 9(a). Under 250 continuous discharge–charge cycles, the Zn–air battery exhibited excellent cycling stability, with results similar to Pt/C and Pt/C + RuO2 driven Zn–air batteries (Fig. 9(b)). The galvanostatic discharge curves of the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400/C driven Zn–air battery at current densities of 5 and 10 mA cm−2 are illustrated to explore the discharge rate performance. Fig. 10(a)–(c) and Table S1† show that its specific capacity and energy density are higher than those of Pt/C and Pt/C + RuO2 driven Zn–air batteries. Therefore, a red light-emitting diode (LED, 3 V) bulb quickly turned on using two Zn–air batteries of 3.08 V (Fig. S5†) with the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400/C electrode, indicating excellent operational practicability (Fig. 10(d)).

Characterization of the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400/C electrode before and after the ORR using Fe 2p, Cu 2p, Mo 3d, N 1s, C 1s, and O 1s XPS is shown in Fig. S6.† For the ORR process, the surface of the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-400/C electrocatalysts absorbed O2via oxidation according to the mechanism O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−.53 Therefore, the Fe2+ peaks disappear, leaving only Fe3+ peaks (Fig. S6(a)†), and the CuO peak area increases after the ORR (Fig. S6(b)†). At the same time, peaks assigned to Mo5+ 3d3/2 (234.2 eV) and 3d5/2 (230.70 eV) and peaks centered at 233.3 and 228.8 eV attributed to Mo4+ 3d3/2 and Mo4+ 3d5/2 were also detected (Fig. S6(c)†). Both the N 1s peak of N–O at 402.9 eV (Fig. S6(d)†) and the C 1s peak of CO at 289.0 eV before the ORR disappear and create a C–O–C peak at 287.4 eV (Fig. S6(e)†). Moreover, an O 1s OH peak at 533.5 eV is observed after the ORR (Fig. S6(f)†), which is contributed by the OH− products absorbed on the surface of the electrocatalysts.
Water splitting performance
In the above studies, Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600@NF and 300@NF acted as both the cathode and anode in the two-electrode assembled electrocatalytic cells. An overall water-splitting potential of around 1.56 V was required to attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and at around 2.03 V a current density of 100 mA cm−2 was obtained (Fig. 11(a)). With an applied current density of 100 mA cm−2, the curves of both H2 and O2 gas indicated sustainable release over time, as shown in Fig. 11(b), matching those computed by the cumulative charge volume ratio, indicating the Faradaic efficiency was nearly 100%. Both the H2 and O2 gas evolution were higher than those of the Pt/C@NF||RuO2@NF assembly electrolyzer (Fig. 11(b)). Testing the cathode and anode for long-term stability via 5000 cycles of CV from 1 to 4 V at 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 11(a)) in 0.1 M KOH solution confirmed that both the cathode and anode are durable in alkaline water splitting. These results show that Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB is a bifunctional electrocatalyst when heated to 600 °C and 300 °C, respectively, for water-splitting in an alkaline environment. This offers a way toward cost-effective, stable, and high-performance electrocatalytic materials.

Fig. S7† compares Fe 2p, Cu 2p, Mo 3d, N 1s, C 1s, and O 1s XPS results for Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600/NF before and after the OER. The elements Fe and Mo show stable activity after the OER, as the Fe 2p and Mo 3d XPS were not changed (Fig. S7(a) and S7(b)†). The XPS of Cu 2p (Fig. S7(c)†) exhibited a 15.5% increase in the Cu2O (1.19 → 16.7%) and a 6.5% decrease in the CuO (56.36% → 49.8%) for Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600/NF, which could be associated with O2 generation according to 4CuO → 2Cu2O + O2↑ (ref. 54) during the OER process. Additionally, the N 1s peak at 402.9 eV corresponding to N–O could be attributed to the electrocatalysts absorbing oxygen, as shown in Fig. S7(d).† The C 1s peaks without changing before and after the OER (Fig. S7(e)†). The O 1s XPS results indicate the OH− molecule from the KOH electrolyte being absorbed on the electrocatalyst55 in the MOOH + OH− → M + O2 + H2O + e− (ref. 53) step, leading to OH peak formation in O 1s at 533.5 eV (Fig. S7(f)†).
During the HER process, the water molecule splits, and hydrogen adsorption occurs on the surface of the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-300/NF electrocatalysts. The Fe 2p and Cu 2p XPS peaks show that the elements Fe and Cu are stable before and after, as shown in Fig. S8(a) and S8(b).† However, Mo 3d XPS results (Fig. S8(c)†) confirm that Mo is more affected than Fe and Cu. The new peaks formed by the Mo5+ contributed by the electrocatalysts contain MoO3, which reacts with adsorbed hydrogen and produces MoO3−x(OH)x structures according to MoO3 + xHads + H2O + xe− → MoO3−x(OH)x + H2 + OH−.56,57 Simultaneously, a new O 1s peak assigned to OH was found at 533.4 eV (Fig. S8(d)†), indicating the surface hydrogen-bonding interactions during the HER process. However, the C–O–C and O–CO peaks of C 1s XPS (Fig. S8(e)†) and an N–O peak of N 1s XPS (Fig. S8(f)†) are formed when they are subjected to the HER, which means that the C–O structure and M–N–C structure of the electrocatalysts were affected during the HER.
To summarize the above results, Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB complexes show promise for electrocatalytic ORR/OER/HER under alkaline conditions, as shown in Fig. 12, implying that optimization of the structure via the addition of Mo and the use of heating would help to advance its catalytic activity. Their electrocatalytic performance was compared with other reports of metal Schiff bases, as shown in Table S2.† These results reveal that designing Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB complexes represents an exciting new opportunity, with the promise of low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for Zn–air batteries and alkaline water electrolysis for energy storage and conversion.
 Fig. 12  Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB can be an ORR, OER, and HER electrocatalyst for use in Zn–air batteries and alkaline water electrolysis. 
Experimental

Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC) was bought from Alfa Aesar. Commercial ruthenium oxide (RuO2), triethylenetetramine (TETA), and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) were purchased from Acros. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) was from Fisher Scientific. Copper(II) acetate monohydrate (Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were supplied from Showa. Commercial 20% platinum with carbon (Pt/C) was bought from Alfa Aesar. Vulcan XC-72 carbon was purchased from Twinstar. Ethanol (99.5%) was from ECHOs, and 20% Nafion solution was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich.
Synthesis of metal Schiff base complexes
An SB ligand was synthesized from the condensation reaction of 20 mmol of BTC and 10 mmol of TETA dissolved in 100 ml ethanol under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 2 h, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 12 h. A white precipitate was observed, and a chemical reaction proceeded in which a carbonyl group on BTC reacted with an amine group on TETA,58,59 as shown in Scheme 1. Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB was prepared using a 1:6 molar ratio of SB (0.54 g of Schiff base ligand dissolved in 50 ml DI water) mixed with a metal salt solution (such as 0.05 M of FeCl3, 0.05 M of Cu (CH3COO)2·H2O, and 0.05 M (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), and 200 ml of ethanol under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB precipitates were washed several times with DI water, centrifuged, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The preparation of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB is shown in Scheme 1. The Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB electrocatalyst was heated at temperatures from 200 °C to 900 °C.
Material characterization
The electrocatalysts were mixed with KBr (1:100 wt%) and ground to powder in an agate mortar. The powder was shaped into a 1.3 cm diameter disc at 500 lb for 3 min using a hot press at room temperature. The disc was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using a Nicolet iS5 (Thermo Scientific) at room temperature within the wave number range of 4000–400 cm−1. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 17O NMR spectra were measured using a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker AV-500, USA). Each sample (∼5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide d6 (DMSO-d6). The elemental compositions and morphological characteristics of the Fe–Cu–N4 900 electrocatalysts were determined via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), using an Oxford Instruments X-Max 150 (UK) and electron impact ionization with a nominal electron energy of 70 eV. Thermogravimetric (TGA) measurements of the mass changes of the examined materials were performed using an SDT Q600 (TA Instruments, USA).
Structure identification was carried out using an Ultima IV (Rigaku) for X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) at room temperature, with a pixel detector using Ni-filtered Cu Kβ radiation (0.154 nm) in the range of 2θ = 10–80° and at a scanning rate of 0.05° s−1. Morphological characteristics were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-7800F, Japan). Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Quantes (ULVA-PHI, Inc.) with a conventional soft Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source operated at 200 W and 15 kV, with a 650 mm beam. The base pressure was maintained at 10 mbar. All XPS data profiles were fitted using XPS Peak 41 software, and the C 1s peak at 284.9 eV was used to calibrate the binding energy.
Electrochemical measurements
5 mg of the electrocatalyst and 5 mg of XC-72 carbon were dispersed in a 950 μl ethanol and 50 μl 20% Nafion mixture solution as an ink. A typical three-electrode system was employed and measured using a CHI 7086E workstation (CH Instruments) with a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE-3A, ALS) to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the electrocatalysts. The disk diameter of the glassy carbon on RRDE was 4 mm (area 0.1257 cm2), surrounded by a Pt ring with a 5 mm inner and 7 mm outer diameter (0.1885 cm2), respectively. The working electrode, counter electrode, reference electrode, and electrolyte consisted of 6.4 μl of ink dripped on the RRDE electrode, a graphite rod (diameter = 6 mm), Hg/HgO electrode (1 M NaOH solution), and 0.1 M KOH, respectively. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential was calibrated as ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.059 pH + 0.118 (pH 14 is 0.1 M KOH).
The number of electrons transferred (n) per O2 molecule and the hydrogen peroxide yield (H2O2, %) in the RRDE experiments were evaluated between 0–1.2 V (RHE) of ring potential and estimated by eqn (1) and (2)60 (1) (2)where id and ir are the absolute current values of the disk and ring currents, respectively. The N value was estimated to be approximately 0.424 as calibrated in 0.1 M KOH with a 10 mM K3Fe(CN)6 electrolyte.
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were obtained via oxygen or nitrogen saturation at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M KOH solution. The disk diameter of the glassy carbon on the RDE was 4 mm (area 0.1257 cm2). The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) for the OER and HER used the RDE at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with iR compensation (85%) in 0.1 M KOH solution. The double-layer charging current was estimated at potentials of 0.8–1.0 V versus RHE at scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 mV s−1. The linear slope was twice the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measured via CVs in a potential range where no apparent Faradaic process occurred, following the expression ΔJ = Cdl × ν. Thus, the linear fitting of the charging currents (ΔJ = Janode − Jcathode) at a specific potential (using 0.9 V vs. RHE) against the scan rates led to a straight line with a slope equal to Cdl. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the sample was then estimated from the Cdl of the catalyst. Subsequently, the ECSA value was mostly 0.04 mF cm−2, as obtained according to the expression ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cs is the specific electrochemical double-layer capacitance of an atomically smooth surface.61,62
Fabrication of Zn-air batteries
Various catalyst inks prepared using 40 mg Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB/C, 40 mg commercial 20% Pt/C, and 20% Pt/C + RuO2 (20 mg of commercial 20% Pt/C mixed with 20 mg of commercial RuO2) were dispersed in a solution containing 377 μl of ethylene glycol, 800 μl of ethanol, and 23 μl of 20 wt% Nafion solution through sonication for 30 min. The cathode for the air electrode was prepared by coating 270 μl of ink (33.3 mg ml−1) on circular carbon paper (Sigracet GDL 29 BC, Ion Power, Inc., USA) with a size of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm (4 mg cm−2) and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The anode was a 0.5 mm thick Zn plate (5 cm × 7 cm; 99.5%). The cathode, an anode, and 100 ml of the electrolyte, which consisted of 6 M KOH with 0.2 M zinc acetate (Showa, Japan), were assembled to form the Zn–air battery. The specific capacity and energy density of the Zn–air batteries were calculated using eqn (3) and (4):63 Specific capacity (mAh g−1) = I × t/w(3) Energy density (mW h g−1) = I × t × V/w(4)where I is the measured current (mA), t is the reaction time (h), w is the weight of consumed Zn (g), and V is the average discharge voltage (V).
The stability of the Zn–air battery was evaluated under cycling with the discharge/charge measurements durations set to 100 s, respectively, and a total of 250 cycles in the ambient environment.
Overall water splitting test
200 μl of (0.01 mg μl−1) ink was prepared by dispersing 10 mg of Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-300/C and Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600/C mixed with 900 μl of ethanol and 100 μl of 20 wt% Nafion solution and sonicated for 30 min. This ink was dripped on 1 cm × 1 cm Ni foam (2 mg cm−2) as the anode and cathode for overall water splitting. These electrodes were dried at 60 °C for 24 h. In addition, Pt/C and RuO2 electrocatalysts were used as a cathode and anode for comparison.
The amounts of H2 and O2 in 0.1 M KOH solution were evaluated via electrolysis using an online Labsolar 6A system (PerfectLight Technology Co., Ltd., China) with an applied current density of 100 mA cm−2. Gas evolution was detected per hour via gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 6890 N network gas chromatograph (USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and Ar carrier gas. The H2 and O2 evolution volumes were calibrated using an injected volume of pure H2, and O2 was linearly dependent on the GC peak area. The theoretical hydrogen quantity was determined using eqn (5):64 (5)V = gas volume (H2 or O2); I = current intensity; T = ambient temperature; t = time; R = universal gas constant = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1; F = Faraday constant = 96485 A s mol−1; p = ambient pressure in Pa. The following applies: 1 Pa = 1 N m−2 (normal pressure 1.013 × 105 Pa). z = number of electrons required for separating a molecule (H2 = 2, O2 = 4).
The faradaic efficiency was calculated by comparing the experimentally measured amount of gas with the theoretically calculated amount using eqn (6):65 (6)
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that the addition of Mo to Fe0.5Cu0.5–SB can enhance the ORR, OER, and HER performance, based on the synergistic coupling of Fe–Nx, Cu–Nx, and Mo–Nx. Simultaneously, Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB can be a trifunctional electrocatalyst for application in the ORR, OER, and HER under different heating temperatures. A heating temperature of 400 °C for Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB results in better ORR performance, and was applied to the cathode of a Zn–air battery that exhibits excellent cycling stability after 250 continuous discharge–charge cycles and can drive a red-light-emitting diode bulb. Furthermore, heating temperatures of 600 and 300 °C for Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB result in better OER and HER performance than RuO2 and Pt/C at 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, the asymmetrical two-electrode electrolyzer integrating the Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-600@NF||Fe0.5Cu0.5Mo0.5–SB-300@NF couple outperformed the state-of-the-art noble-metal pair of Pt/C||RuO2, providing a remarkable cell voltage of 1.56 to reach 10 mA cm−2, as well as good durability for overall alkaline water splitting over 5000 cycles.
