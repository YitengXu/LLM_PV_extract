These electron donors vary in their π-extent to adjust the electronic coupling and the distance with the PDI stacks. Possessing the largest π-extent, BSSBP has strong π–π interactions as well as ionic interactions with (TAIPDI)n. Instead of π-stacking with TAIPDI planes, DANS and ANADS, with a relatively small π-extent, are embedded in the side chains of TAIPDIs via ionic interactions, resulting in a distance increment from the aromatic TAIPDI cores. After excitation, the BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n system exhibits fast charge separation (0.70 ps) and relatively slow charge recombination (485 ps) due to intermolecular electron delocalization along the TAIPDI stacks. On the other hand, charge separation in DANS–(TAIPDI)n and ANADS–(TAIPDI)n occurs within 1.5 and 1.6 ns, respectively, calculated from the quenching of singlet excited states. The lifetimes of charge-separated states are determined to be 44 and 96 μs, at least 105 times slower than that of BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n due to remarkably improved electron transport throughout the (TAIPDI)n.
Introduction
Self-organization of extensive π-systems at the nanoscale provides morphology control and long-range charge transport, both of which are of importance to enhance the efficiencies of photoinduced device applications, such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.1,2 Regarding these aspects, the self-assembly of perylenediimides (PDIs) at the nanoscale has drawn much attention.3,4 Self-assembly of electron deficient π-planes of PDIs in one dimension enhances the charge transport through the intermolecular π-electron delocalization following thermal or photoinduced electron transfer from an electron donor.5–7 Nonetheless, efficiencies of organic solar cells of PDIs fabricated from a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) with a polymer donor are quite low when compared to those in which the fullerene derivatives are employed as electron acceptors. Two main reasons have been proposed for the low external quantum efficiencies of BHJ solar cells of PDIs:8 (i) fast charge recombination when the electronic communication between the donor and PDI is strong owing to π–π interactions; and (ii) fast exciton quenching due to π-stacking of PDI molecules resulting in excimer-like (intermolecular) states9 when charge transfer is reduced, probably because of the increased distance between the polymer donor and PDI aggregates. In the former case, strong electronic communication of PDIs with the donor moieties also enhances the fast charge transfer but the charge transport among the PDI stacks is precluded.10 In the latter case, because the stacking behaviour is preserved, the charge transport is relatively improved.8,11
Disruption of the stacking behaviour of planar PDIs by the substitution of bulky groups from the core region12 or by the junction of two twisted PDIs from imide positions13 has been suggested in order to impede fast charge recombination and exciton quenching. However, disturbance of aggregation prevents the extensive charge transport among the PDI stacks.
Overcoming the fast charge recombination may be achieved by adjusting the distance between the donor and acceptor, which should be long enough to avoid strong electronic coupling and to preserve columnar stacking of PDIs but sufficiently close so that the exciton can be utilized for charge separation before it is quenched or transferred.
Previously,14 we studied columnar stacks of N,N′-di(2-(trimethylammoniumiodide)ethylene) perylenediimide (TAIPDI), in which sulphonated porphyrins intervene between the PDI stacks at various ratios through strong π–π interactions assisted by ionic interactions in an aqueous environment. Following the photoexcitation, the charge separation was quite fast due to strong electronic coupling between the PDI stacks and inserted porphyrins. However, the strong coupling also resulted in fast charge recombination, impairing the long-range photoinduced electron transport along the PDI stacks. We also showed that despite the quenching of singlet excited states of monomer PDI, those of stacked PDIs have sufficient lifetimes for photoinduced processes with closely positioned donor or acceptor components.
In this study, we have examined the self-assemblies of TAIPDI stacks, (TAIPDI)n, with three different electron donors, disodium 4,4′-bis(2-sulfonatostyryl)biphenyl (BSSBP, stilbene-420), sodium 9,10-dimethoxyanthracene-2-sulfonate (DANS) and disodium 6-amino-1,3-naphthalenedisulfonate (ANADS). These electron donors vary in their π-extent to adjust the electronic coupling and the distance with the PDI stacks (Fig. 1). The photodriven electron-transport properties of these self-assembly systems have been investigated by using time-resolved transient techniques.

Experimental
Materials

N,N′-Di(2-(trimethylammoniumiodide)ethylene)perylenediimide (TAIPDI) was synthesized according to reported procedures.15,16 Electron donors, disodium 4,4′-bis(2-sulfonatostyryl)biphenyl (BSSBP), sodium 9,10-dimethoxyanthracene-2-sulfonate (DANS), and disodium 6-amino-1,3-naphthalenedisulfonate (ANADS) and napthalene-2-amine and 9,10-dimethylanthracene, used for the comparison of phosphorescence results, have been obtained from commercial sources (TCI) and used as received. Purification of water (18.2 MΩ cm) was performed with a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Direct-Q 3 UV).
Instruments
Steady-state absorption measurements were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Fluorescence and phosphorescence measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5300PC). Phosphorescence data were obtained from MeTHF–EtOH solutions in the presence of MeI (ca. 10%, v/v) at 77 K. Electrochemical measurements were performed on an ALS630B or ALS730D electrochemical analyzer in deaerated water containing 0.10 M Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. A conventional three-electrode cell was used with a platinum working electrode (surface area of 0.3 mm2) and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The Pt working electrode was routinely polished with ALS polishing alumina suspension (0.05 μm) and rinsed with water and acetone before use. The measured potentials were recorded with respect to a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). All electrochemical measurements were carried out under an atmospheric pressure of N2. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy experiments were conducted using an ultrafast source: Integra-C (Quantronix Corp.), an optical parametric amplifier: TOPAS (Light Conversion Ltd.) and a commercially available optical detection system: Helios provided by Ultrafast Systems LLC. The source for the pump and probe pulses was derived from the fundamental output of Integra-C (780 nm, 2 mJ per pulse and fwhm = 130 fs) at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. 75% of the fundamental output of the laser was introduced into TOPAS, which has optical frequency mixers resulting in a tunable range from 285 nm to 1660 nm, while the rest of the output was used for white light generation. Typically, 2500 excitation pulses were averaged for 5 seconds to obtain the transient spectrum at a set delay time. Kinetic traces at appropriate wavelengths were assembled from the time-resolved spectral data. All measurements were conducted at 298 K. For nanosecond transient absorption measurements, deaerated solutions of the compounds were excited with a Panther optical parametric oscillator (OPO) equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, SLII-10, fwhm = 4–6 ns) with a power of 10–15 mJ per pulse. The photochemical reactions were monitored by continuous exposure to a Xe lamp (150 W) as a probe light and a detector (SpectraPro 300i). The transient spectra were recorded using fresh solutions in each laser excitation. Solutions were deoxygenated by N2 purging for about 15 min prior to the transient spectral measurements.
Results and discussion
Formation of self-assemblies of (TAIPDI)n and electron donors
BSSBP has an absorption maximum at 349 nm in water (Fig. 2). By the addition of (TAIPDI)n, the featureless absorption band of BSSBP starts to decrease with a small shift to 346 nm,17 while the broad and red-shifted absorption of the TAIPDI stacks appears at 507 nm, which is seen at 501 nm in the absence of BSSBP.14,18 Isosbestic points and drastic variations in absorption characteristics indicate an electronic interaction between the components mainly through π–π interactions. The decrease in absorbance at 349 nm continues until the 1:1 stoichiometry between TAIPDI and BSSBP is established, as indicated by the plots of absorbance at 349, 377, 507 nm vs. the molar ratio of added TAIPDI to the total concentration (Fig. 2, Inset). From the slope of the linear plot in Fig. 2, the formation constant (K1) is calculated to be 3.8 × 105 M−1.19,20 After the 1:1 ratio is surpassed upon the addition of further TAIPDI, a small shoulder appears at 377 nm, while the absorption at 349 nm rises moderately, indicating a new ratio along the row of the columnar TAIPDI stacks. The maximum of TAIPDI at 507 nm also shifts to 501 nm with increasing molar extinction coefficient. It should be noted that the ratio given does not represent the individual 1:1 complexes; instead, this expression describes the number of components present along the repeating columnar π-stacks.

(right) Linear plot of [BSSBP]0/(A − A0) vs. [TAIPDI]−1 at 349 nm to evaluate a formation constant. 
Self-assembly of BSSBP with TAIPDI stacks also results in total quenching of BSSBP fluorescence emission at 437 nm due to intrasupramolecular electron transfer from BSSBP to (TAIPDI)nvia strong π–π interactions. The decrease in this emission intensity with a red shift to 444 nm gives a formation constant, as determined from a linear plot, as 1.5 × 106 M−1 (Fig. 3).21 Self-assembly characteristics of TAIPDI with BSSBP resemble those with ZnTPPSK4, which also has an extensive π-system.14

DANS, on the other hand, gives absorption peaks at 403 and 382 nm with a shoulder at 370 nm in water (Fig. 4).22 Titration with TAIPDI causes an indistinct decrease at 403 nm and a very small rise at 370 nm while the peak at 382 nm is nearly fixed. Absorption of TAIPDI stacks first emerges at 510 nm, then shifts to 508 nm. The molar extinction coefficient of TAIPDI is close to that in the absence of DANS. These absorption features reveal that π–π interactions between TAIPDI stacks and DANS are quite limited. Contrary to the slightly altered absorption features, the quenching of fluorescence of DANS is explicitly observed during the titration with TAIPDI stacks (Fig. 4). The emission peak at 460 nm decreases with a shift to 442 nm by the addition of TAIPDI due to intrasupramolecular electron transfer via ionic interactions. Besides, featureless emission characteristics are altered vibrationally because DANS molecules are most probably positioned within the side chains of TAIPDIs while partially overlapping with the TAIPDI aromatic core. Thus, the ionic interactions between TAIPDI and DANS are more influential compared to π–π interactions due to the modest π-extent of DANS. In this way, the distance between π-planes of TAIPDIs and DANS is extended to a degree. A plot of emission at 460 nm vs. the molar ratio of added TAIPDI to the total concentration revealed a break occuring at 0.53, indicating a 1:1 ratio (Fig. 4, Inset). The decrease in the emission intensity at 460 nm affords a linear plot, the slope of which gave the binding constant for DANS–TAIPDI (K2) as 3.0 × 102 M−1 (Fig. 4).21 Compared to that of BSSBP–TAIPDI (K1), this constant (K2) is quite low due to reduced π–π interactions.

(iii) Linear plot of [DANS]0/(I − I0) vs. [TAIPDI]−1 at 460 nm to evaluate a formation constant. 
Lastly, ANADS, bearing small π-extent, has a charge-transition absorption band centred at 352 nm water (Fig. 5). During the titration with TAIPDI, it gave no isosbestic point. A slight shift from 352 to 354 nm exists with a small rise in the absorbance due to probable ionic interactions with TAIPDI side chains.23 (TAIPDI)n gives a maximum at 506 nm. Thus, it can be concluded that there is no or negligible π–π interactions between ANADS and TAIPDI stacks. Similar to DANS, titration of ANADS with TAIPDI also leads to fluorescence quenching due to intrasupramolecular electron transfer via ionic interactions. ANADS gives a broad emission with a maximum at 466 nm. Another similarity is the blue shift of the emission to 441 nm while fluorescence quenching occurs. The emission is completely quenched when 1:1 ratio is reached upon the addition of TAIPDI (Fig. 5, Inset). The decrease at 466 nm provides a linear correlation. From the slope of this linear plot, the binding constant for ANADS–TAIPDI (K3) is determined to be 9.0 × 103 M−1 (Fig. 5).21

(iii) Linear plot of [ANADS]0/(I − I0) vs. [TAIPDI]−1 at 466 nm to evaluate the formation constant. 
Compared to that of DANS–TAIPDI, the stronger binding of ANADS with TAIPDI can be explained by the presence of a second anionic sulphonic group on the ANADS moiety. These anionic groups are strongly attracted by cationic heads of the side chains so that the naphthalene cores barely communicate with the TAIPDI planes. ANADS moieties are most likely to be embedded in the side periphery of TAIPDI stacks. Hence, the distance between the stacked TAIPDI planes and the electron donors has been adjusted in accordance with the π-extents of the donor entities.
Energetics of photoinduced charge separation
The driving forces for charge separation between (TAIPDI)n and electron donors in water have been calculated according to eqn (1):24 ΔGCS = e(Eox − Ered) − ΔES + ΔGs(1)where Eox is the first one-electron oxidation potential of electron donors, Ered is the first one-electron reduction potential of (TAIPDI)n, ΔES is the lowest singlet excited state energy of photosensitizer moiety in the complex, and ΔGs is the static Coulomb energy in water.25–27 The Eox values of electron donors, obtained from water solutions containing 0.10 M Na2SO4 (Fig. S1, ESI†) are compiled in Table 1 together with corresponding ΔGCS and ΔGCR values. The Ered value of TAIPDI was already determined to be −0.25 V vs. SCE in water containing 0.10 M Na2SO4.14

The energy levels of the triplet states have been calculated as 2.58, 1.75 and 2.43 eV for BSSBP, DANS and ANADS, respectively, based on phosphorescence measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†).28 The triplet state energy of PDI was estimated to be 1.20 eV.7,29 Thus, the triplet excited states of electron donors can undergo charge separation.
Photoinduced electron-transfer processes taking place in the corresponding self-assembly systems have been observed by using femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption measurements. To observe the extensive electron transport within the π-stacks of TAIPDI, the amounts of electron donors have been kept to a minimum while sufficient amounts are provided for the highest absorption at excitation wavelength as is possible.
Photoinduced charge separation dynamics of BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n
Femtosecond transient measurements of BSSBP reveal the singlet excited states of BSSBP (1BSSBP*), which gives a broad positive absorption, reaching a climax around 750 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†). The lifetime of 1BSSBP* is determined as 0.8 ns in water. The femtosecond transient spectra of BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n in water display very fast formation of positive absorption with several maxima in the visible region, which are very different from those of 1BSSBP* and 1(TAIPDI)n* (Fig. 6).14 These transient traits can be assigned to the radical cation of BSSBP (BSSBP˙+) and the radical anion of (TAIPDI)n [(TAIPDI)n˙−], which overlapping in the visible region.30–33 Electron hopping in the TAIPDI stacks also has an effect on broadening of the features of (TAIPDI)n˙−.34 In the NIR region, the broad transient around 970 nm distinctly originates from (TAIPDI)n˙−.14,31 Thus, photoinduced electron transfer from BSSBP to TAIPDI stacks can be inferred from the transient spectral signatures of the radical ions of the electron donor and acceptor.
 Fig. 6  Femtosecond transient absorption spectra of BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n in deaerated water at indicated time delays (λexc = 390 nm). 
From the rise of absorbance at 730 and 970 nm, the rate of charge separation (kCS1) is calculated as 1.4 × 1012 s−1 (0.70 ps). Very fast charge separation results from the strong π–π interactions between the donor and acceptor units within the columnar arrays. Similar to the ZnTPPSK4–(TAIPDI)n case,14 the time profile at 730 nm gives a two-component decay (Fig. 7). The first component affords a decay rate constant of 5.8 × 1010 s−1 (τCS1 = 17 ps) while the second component gives a slow decay with a rate constant of 2.1 × 109 s−1 (τCS2 = 485 ps), as a result of electron transport within the TAIPDI stacks, decelerating the charge recombination. The fast charge recombination, which is correlated with the first decay component, results from enhanced electronic coupling between the π-systems of the donor and acceptor14,35,36 and the possible random distribution of the donor entities within the columnar arrays.14 There was no transient signal in the nanosecond transient absorption spectra, suggesting that the charge recombination is complete before 100 ns.37

Photoinduced charge separation dynamics of DANS–(TAIPDI)n and ANADS–(TAIPDI)n
Singlet excited states of DANS (1DANS*) display a broad peak at 550 nm and a smaller absorption around 790 nm, as monitored by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 8). The lifetime of 1DANS* is determined from the decay at 550 nm as 6.0 ns (1.7 × 108 s–1). As shown in Fig. 8, the self-assembly of DANS with TAIPDI stacks exhibits almost identical femtosecond transient patterns to those of the singlet excited state of DANS except for the reduced lifetime to 1.2 ns (kq = 8.2 × 108 s−1). On the other hand, the transient features of the self-assembly of ANADS with (TAIPDI)n are not significantly different from those of 1ANADS* (Fig. S4, ESI†). Similarly, the lifetime of the 1ANADS* (3.1 ns) is also decreased to 1.6 ns (kq = 6.1 × 108 s−1). The shortened lifetimes of the singlet excited states of electron donors suggest the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer to the TAIPDI stacks in both cases. The absence of transient traits of 1(TAIPDI)n* or 1TAIPDI* indicates that there is no singlet–singlet energy transfer from electron donors. The rate of charge separation can be estimated from the quenching of the singlet excited state by using eqn (2):38 kCS = (1/τq) − kS(2)where τq is the lifetime of the quenched singlet excite state due to electron transfer and kS is the rate constant of the singlet excited state without any quenching. Then, kCS for DANS–(TAIPDI)n is estimated as 6.7 × 108 s−1 (1.5 ns) while ANADS–(TAIPDI)n affords a charge separation rate constant of 6.1 × 108 s−1 (1.6 ns). Compared to that of BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n, the charge-separation processes in these self-assemblies are quite slow because of increased distance between the donor and the acceptor.39 Still, the access to the charge separation via the triplet states is feasible because energy levels of the charge-separated states of self-assemblies of DANS and ANADS are below those of triplet states of the electron donors.

To monitor the electron-transfer products, nanosecond transient absorption measurements have been performed for these self-assembly systems. The charge separation is evident in the nanosecond absorption spectra of DANS–(TAIPDI)n as the formation of the radical cation of DANS (DANS˙+) and the radical anion of (TAIPDI)n is clearly observed (Fig. 9). DANS˙+ appears at 420, 560 and 610 nm32 while the typical peaks of (TAIPDI)n˙− emerge at 730, 820, and 980 nm.14,31 There was no signal to assign for the triplet excited states of DANS (Fig. S5, ESI†) or TAIPDI, resulting from the triplet–triplet energy transfer.40 The decay of electron-transfer species follows first-order kinetics. The rate constant for charge recombination is determined to be 2.3 × 104 s−1 from the decay at 730 nm, giving the lifetime of the charge-separated state as 44 μs (Fig. 9, inset). When turning to ANADS–(TAIPDI)n, the nanosecond transient spectra also exhibit the formation of ANADS˙+ at around 400 and 540 nm32 and (TAIPDI)n˙− at 730, 810, and 980 nm as a result of the charge separation (Fig. S6, ESI†). The absence of transients due to the triplet excited states (Fig. S7, ESI†) suggests highly efficient photodriven charge-separation process. The decay rate of (TAIPDI)n˙− at 730 nm was fitted to a first-order plot where the rate of charge recombination for ANADS–(TAIPDI)n was found to be 1.0 × 104 s−1 (τCS = 96 μs).

Photoinduced processes observed in these systems are summarized in energy level diagrams (Fig. 10). Compared to the BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n case, exceedingly long lifetime values for the charge-separated states in DANS–(TAIPDI)n and ANADS–(TAIPDI)n systems can be explained by the presence of improved charge transport in the TAIPDI stacks. The reduced electronic coupling also inhibits the fast exciton quenching of electron donors because of π-stacking with TAIPDIs. Increasing the distance has brought about slow charge separation. However, the higher kCS/kCR ratios of DANS–(TAIPDI)n and ANADS–(TAIPDI)n (29000 and 61000, respectively) than those of BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n and ZnTPPSK4–(TAIPDI)n (667 and 3000,14 respectively) sufficiently compensate this drawback. Because DANS and ANADS molecules are positioned at the side periphery of TAIPDI cores, dominantly via ionic interactions with negligible π–π interactions, long-range electron transport in the (TAIPDI)n has not been interrupted. As might be expected, stacking defects still hinder the electron hopping along these stacks.41 Utilizing the triplet states has an impact on the elongation of the electron transport due to spin restriction rules.42 As a result, the lifetimes of charge-separated states of DANS–(TAIPDI)n and ANADS–(TAIPDI)n are at least 105 times longer than those of tightly stacked BSSBP–(TAIPDI)n.

Conclusions
The columnar stacks of TAIPDI host BSSBP, DANS, and ANADS molecules at various ratios via intermolecular interactions. The π–π interactions mainly govern the self-assembly of (TAIPDI)n and BSSBP, having a large π-extent, thereby favouring the electron coupling. On the other hand, DANS and ANADS, having relatively small π-extents, interact with the side chains of TAIPDI stacks via ionic interactions resulting in a distance increment from the TAIPDI π-planes. The enhanced distance improves the extensive electron transport along the TAIPDI stacks in DANS–(TAIPDI)n and ANADS–(TAIPDI)n after photoinduced electron transfer from electron donors.

Although the transportation of the photogenerated charges in the active layers of the BHJ solar cells has so far been achieved by using π-conjugated polymer donors, which are available for extensive charge delocalization along the polymer backbone, they rarely form one dimensional self-organizations at nanoscale without additional synthetic modifications.

Besides the red shift, the extinction coefficient of TAIPDI (ε) at 501 nm is reduced to 11600 M−1 cm−1 when the 1:1 ratio is established. Normally, it has the ε value of 37500 M–1 cm–1 at 501 nm (ref. 14). After exceeding the 1:1 ratio, ε starts to converge to the normal value.

According to the 1:1 ratio, the absorbance change is given by the equation [BSSBP]0/(A − A0) = (εc − εp)–1+(K1[TAIPDI](εc – εp))−1, where A0 and A are the absorbance of BSSBP and εc and εp are the molar absorption coefficients of BSSBP at 349 nm in the absence and presence of TAIPDI, respectively. This equation predicts a linear correlation between [ BSSBP]0/(A − A0) and [TAIPDI]−1 (ref. 19).
According to the 1:1 ratio, the emission change is given by the equation [BSSBP]0/(I − I0) = (εc − εp)–1 + (K1[TAIPDI](εc − εp))−1, where I0 and I are the emission intensity of BSSBP and εc and εp are the molar absorption coefficients of BSSBP at 437 nm in the absence and presence of TAIPDI, respectively. This equation predicts a linear correlation between [BSSBP]0/(I − I0) and [TAIPDI]−1 (ref. 19).

To calculate the ΔGs, the two correlations have been used (ref. 26): (i) ΔGs (eV) = 0.56 (1/ε) + 0.003 when electron-transfer products are contact ion pair and (ii) ΔGs = 1.52 (1/ε) – 0.064 when electron-transfer products are solvent-separated ion pair, where ε is the dielectric constant of the solvent. Because TAIPDI and BSSBP are closely positioned via π–π interactions, the initial products are assumed to be contact ion pair while those of TAIPDI (ref. 14) and the other electron donors (DANS and ANADS) are accepted as solvent separated ion pairs (ref. 27).

Because electron donors are not so soluble in MeTHF, the mixture of MeTHF and EtOH has been used. Phosphorescence emissions of DANS and ANADS have been compared to those of 9,10-dimethylanthracene and napthalen-2-amine obtained in MeTHF at 77 K. See Fig. S2 (ESI†).

(TAIPDI)n˙− has a broad absorbtion centered at 730 nm (ref. 31). The stilbene radical cation has also broad absorption around 760 nm with a shoulder around 650 nm (ref. 32 and 33). Cis- and trans-isomers of BSSBP may also cause the formation different maxima of radical cation (ref. 32).
