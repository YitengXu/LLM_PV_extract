    , Accepted 11th December 2022First published on 14th December 2022AbstractMolecular self-aggregation and crystallization of the semiconducting polymer (SCP) are key features of organic electronic devices. In this study, we synthesized a new polymer with an asymmetrically incorporated fluorine atom in the TVT (asy-1FTVT) of a donor–acceptor type SCP (asy-PNDI1FTVT) and compared its optical and physical properties with those of two symmetric acceptor polymers (PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT). The molecular aggregation and crystallization behavior of the newly synthesized asy-PNDI1FTVT, containing irregularities within the repeating unit, differed from those of the two symmetric polymers. Atomic force microscopy and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering revealed much lower crystallinity of asy-PNDI1FTVT than that of the symmetric polymers. In performance tests of polymer solar cells with an inverted structure, PTB7-Th:asy-PNDI1FTVT exhibited a well-mixed morphology between the donor and acceptor polymers and efficiently facilitated the charge dissociation process, thereby enhancing the short-circuit current (JSC) and the power conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Semiconducting polymers (SCPs), which contain π-conjugated aromatic rings, are adopted as the active materials in thin-film devices such as organic thin-film transistors, charge transport layers of perovskite solar cells, and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).1–4 SCPs are rationally designed as lightweight, flexible, low-cost materials with large-area fabrication ability. The chemical structures of π-conjugated materials can be systematically tailored to achieve the desired physical and optoelectronic properties.5 Various molecular design strategies, such as chemical substitution of the electron donating or withdrawing groups and side-chain modifications, have been proposed. Among these methods, fluorination of the π-conjugated aromatic rings can effectively control the molecular properties of SCPs.6 The fluorine atom is a representative electron-withdrawing substituent that efficiently reduces the frontier molecular orbitals (i.e., the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) and changes the molecular conformation with little steric hindrance.7 It is also possible to control the molecular symmetry of SCPs by inserting different numbers of fluorine atoms at various positions in the π-conjugated molecules. Molecular symmetry can control the planarity, rigidity, order, and packing tightness of the polymer backbone changing the strong intermolecular interaction, and hence the conformation and morphology of the SCPs. These morphological properties are closely associated with the optoelectrical properties.8–12
In particular, the strong intermolecular interaction of SCPs can increase the crystallinity and self-aggregation which not only decrease the solubility of the polymer in common organic solvents (i.e., processability) but also induce large-scale phase separation between the donor and acceptor polymers. In OPVs, poor intermixing between donor and acceptor polymer photoactive layers13–15 and decreased exciton dissociation with low charge-dissociation ability degraded the device parameters (short-circuit current density JSC, open-circuit voltage VOC, and fill factor FF).16–19 Therefore, the relationship between the morphology and optoelectrical performance must be systematically investigated to enhance the performance of π-conjugated molecule-based OPVs.
In this research, we studied the effect of molecular symmetry on the molecular aggregation and crystallinity of naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based acceptor polymers by measuring their optoelectrical and morphological properties. The bulky NDI units contribute towards self-assembly to form a crystalline structure via strong intermolecular interactions.20,21 To overcome this problem, we developed an asymmetric fluorine substitution strategy targeting the planar π-conjugated molecule unit, namely, the bis(thiophen-2-yl)ethene unit (TVT). We demonstrate that fluorine substitution on the π-conjugated molecule unit controls the aggregation behaviour, solubility, and molecular miscibility of the SCPs. We synthesized a new SCP with an asymmetrically incorporated fluorine atom in the TVT (asy-1FTVT) of a donor–acceptor type SCP (asy-PNDI1FTVT) and compared its optical and physical properties with those of two symmetric acceptor polymers (PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT).22,23 By modifying the symmetry of the SCPs, we significantly altered their physical properties (e.g., crystallinity, solubility, and molecular miscibility). The incorporation of asymmetry in the TVT unit decreased the molecular aggregation and crystallinity properties of the NDI-based copolymers, as determined by optical spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. asy-PNDI1FTVT showed compatible energy levels and enhanced molecular miscibility with those of low crystallinity poly([2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene] (PTB7-Th). The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an all polymer solar cell (all-PSC) was 4.6%. The device based on asy-PNDI1FTVT with PTB7-Th achieved higher device performance (JSC, VOC, and PCE) than the symmetric polymer (PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT)-based devices because it provided a well-mixed donor–acceptor blend system inducing preferential charge transport. By establishing the relationship between the effects of molecular symmetry and morphology, we emphasized the importance of molecular design on aggregation and morphology control.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of the copolymers are described in Scheme 1. asy-1FTVT was synthesized by the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction. To reduce the environmental issues, the titanium chloride reagent conventionally used in the synthesis of TVT and FTVT units was replaced with triethyl phosphite which shows only “flammable” marked in the hazards identification section in the Material Safety Data Sheet. From the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, the LUMO energy levels of PNDITVT, asy-PNDI1FTVT and PNDI2FTVT were determined as −3.89, −3.91, and −3.96 eV, respectively (Fig. S2† and Table 1). The TVT unit and fluorine-substituted asy-1FTVT unit have similar LUMO energy levels, whereas the 2FTVT unit containing two fluorine substituents at the symmetric 1,4 positions has a lower LUMO energy level. The electron mobility (μe) values were calculated using the space charge limited current model as 3.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNDITVT, 3.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for asy-PNDI1FTVT, and 3.20 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNDI2FTVT (Fig. S3†). From these results, it can be predicted that the energy level and electron mobility of asy-PNDI1FTVT are compatible with the use of the active layer in all PSCs. The number average (Mn) and weight average (Mw) molecular weights and polydispersity indices (Đ) of the copolymers are given in Table 1. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements confirmed the effect of molecular symmetricity by fluorine substitution on the thermal properties of the three polymers at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S5†). PNDI-TVT and PNDI2FTVT showed distinctive melting temperature (Tm) and recrystallization temperature (Tc) values. The distinctive Tm and Tc values of PNDITVT (248 and 216 °C) and PNDI2FTVT (277 and 250 °C) were observed in DSC thermograms, while asy-PNDI1FTVT had no thermal transitions. PNDI2FTVT showed a higher thermal transition temperature than PNDITVT, consistent with the stronger intermolecular interactions of PNID2FTVT.23 In addition, PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT showed a distinct thermal transition compared to asy-PNDI1FTVT, which is attributed to the weaker intermolecular interactions of asy-PNDI1FTVT compared to the two symmetric polymers. It is expected that asy-PNDI1FTVT, which contains an asymmetric repeating unit with a fluorine atom in TVT rather than a symmetric polymer (PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT), would tilt a dihedral angle between the donor and acceptor units and change the polymer configuration. To support our expectation, we performed calculations on NDI-based model compounds NDITVT, two regioisomeric NDI derivatives, NDI1FTVT-3,3 and NDI1FTVT-3,8, and NDI2FTVT by using DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level (Fig. S6†). Resultingly, two reigoisomeric NDI1FTVT-3,3 and NDI1FTVT-3,8 (ca. 46°) compounds are predicted to have larger torsions than NDITVT (ca. 42°) and NDI2FTVT (ca. 31°). In addition, NDI1FTVT-3,3 and NDI1FTVT-3,8 contain similar dihedral angles between the donor and acceptor units and asy-1FTVT is randomly sequenced in asy-PNDI1FTVT, a regiorandom polymer.

The steady state UV–vis absorption spectra of the three copolymers, measured in solution and in thin-film states using chloroform, revealed the effect of substituting different numbers of fluorine atoms at different positions on the optical and aggregation properties of the polymers (Fig. 1a–d). The three acceptor polymers showed two distinctive absorption bands in the UV–vis absorption spectra, one at 400 nm and another at 750 nm. The PNDITVT and asy-PNDI1FTVT films exhibited similar absorption edges at 867 and 873 nm, respectively, whereas the PNDI2FTVT film showed a blue-shifted absorption edge at 861 nm. As the two symmetrically substituted fluorine atoms effectively withdrew electrons in the TVT unit, PNDI2FTVT presented a lower HOMO level and a wider band gap (Eg) than the other copolymers.24 When measured in the film state, the absorption maxima (λmax) and edges (λedge) of the three polymers shifted to lower wavelengths compared to those when measured in solution, indicating different aggregate contents in the films formed from the copolymers.25 The absolute aggregation fractions calculated from the solution and film spectra are plotted in Fig. 1d. The aggregation contents were quantified by temperature-dependent UV–vis absorption spectroscopy in the solution phase (Fig. 1e–g). Chlorobenzene was chosen as the solvent because its high boiling point (131 °C) allows UV–vis absorption spectroscopy at high temperatures. The absorption profiles of all polymers were similar at 90 °C, showing a π–π* band around 360 nm and a charge-transfer band around 600 nm, implying a fully disordered polymer chain conformation. The intrachain electronic transitions were little affected by fluorination at the backbone. As the solution temperature decreased to room temperature, the absorption spectra of the three polymers showed red-shifted peaks from 360 nm and 600 nm to 380 nm and 750 nm. The absorption spectra of PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT presented vibronic peaks at 680 nm and 750 nm at room temperature (Fig. 1e and g), whereas asy-PNDI1FTVT showed only a red-shifted peak at 750 nm. The 680 nm peaks of PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT are assigned to a π–π* transition in the intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor units.26 This feature can be explained by the higher planar backbones of the PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT chains compared to that of asy-PNDI1FTVT which is associated with an increased conjugation length.27 The fraction of aggregated chains (fagg) can be studied through the deconvolution analysis of the spectral integration at 90 °C and lower temperature, reflecting the superposition region of ordered and disordered domains.25,28 This can be done by determining the absorption of the neat disordered phase (i.e., obtained at high temperature) and the relative change of oscillator strength between the disordered and aggregated chain conformation (Fig. 1f). The aggregate contents are plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 1h. The fagg values were not significantly changed after solidification, but the fagg of asy-PNDI1FTVT was very low in solution due to the asymmetrical chemical structure, which increased the solubility and processability of this copolymer.

(h) Aggregate content (mol%) versus temperature plots of the three copolymers. 
The emission spectra of the three copolymers at various concentrations were measured in chlorobenzene at 25 °C. These spectra are attributed to a random coil conformation of the amorphous polymer phase, which can examine the intramolecular and intermolecular contributions of charge transfer. As the concentration decreased, the emissions weakened, and the peaks were blue-shifted. Interestingly, the emission peaks of PNDITVT solution were distinctly broader (FWHM = 700–850 nm) than those of asy-PNDI1FTVT and PNDI2FTVT (see Fig. 2a–c). This spectral broadening (Fig. 2a) results from the disordered chains (700–775 nm) and the aggregated chains (775–850 nm).27 This implies that the high planarity of the symmetric polymer backbone induces a stronger interchain interaction and molecular aggregation. To closely examine the energy levels and functions of fluorination with different numbers at different positions, we measured the excitation spectra at emissions near 600 and 800 nm, where the PL intensities of the three polymer solutions (5.0 × 10−7 M) were the highest. Comparing the PL spectra and the UV–vis absorption spectra, the three excitation peaks at 450, 600, and 680 nm originated from the excitation of the NDI units, intramolecular charge transfer, and intermolecular charge transfer, respectively.25,29 A Jablonski diagram of asy-PNID1FTVT is given in Fig. S7.†

We measured the two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) spectra to investigate the effect of molecular symmetry on the microcrystal structure and molecular orientation of the three copolymers (Fig. 3). The PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT peaks were indexed with reference to previous reports,22 and the relevant crystallographic parameters of the three copolymers are summarized in Table 2. The PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT films exhibited lamellar stacking structures with strong (h00) and (00l) peaks in qxy and a (010) peak in qz. Conversely, the asy-PNDI1FTVT film only showed a face-on molecular orientation with a strong (010) peak along the out-of-plane direction.30 In addition, the relative intensity of the (00l) scattering peaks of the asy-PNDI1FTVT film were not strong compared to those of the PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT films, implying that molecular ordering is poor along the backbone direction. The calculated π–π stacking distances (d010) of the PNDITVT, asy-PNDI1FTVT, and PNDI2FTVT films were 3.89 Å, 3.91 Å, and 3.83 Å, whereas the π–π stacking crystallite coherence length values (L010) were 20.8 Å, 21.4 Å, and 19.6 Å, respectively. PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT showed smaller d010 and L010 than asy-PNDI1FTVT, indicating that symmetric polymers tend to form aggregates in solution state due to their more planar backbones, which lowers the solubility of the polymers.31 This result is consistent with the suppression of polymer crystallinity expected by the low aggregation tendency of asymmetric polymers.

To confirm the effect of molecular symmetry with different numbers of fluorine atoms at different positions, we fabricated all-PSCs with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:acceptor polymers/MoO3/Ag. In addition, for clarity of comparison, the devices were fabricated without additional treatment such as thermal annealing and solvent additives. The fabrication procedure is detailed in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are described in Fig. 4d and the JSC was confirmed by external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) shown in Fig. 4e. The photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE) are summarized in Table 3. The VOC increased with the number of fluorine atoms. The VOCs of the PTB7-Th:PNDITVT-, PTB7-Th:asy-PNDI1FTVT-, and PTB7-Th:PNDIFTVT-based all-PSCs were 0.79, 0.74, and 0.66 V, respectively. Because asy-PNDI1FTVT achieves proper HOMO/LUMO offsets with PTB7-Th, exciton dissociations were efficiently facilitated in the blended films, affording PCEs of 4.0%, 4.6%, and 4.3% in the PNDITVT, asy-PNDI1FTVT and PNDI2FTVT-based all-PSCs, respectively. The EQE spectra in Fig. 4e reflect the enhanced JSC values of the asy-PNDI1FTVT-based devices.

Next, we investigated the molecular miscibility between the active layer materials which is an important factor to determine the domain size and phase separation of blend films affecting charge dissociation and transport. The molecular interactions between PTB7-Th and the three acceptor polymers were obtained from contact angle measurements (see Fig. S8†). The surface tensions (γ) of PTB7-Th, PNDITVT, asy-PNDI1FTVT and PNDI2FTVT were calculated as 21.9 (±1.2), 17.8 (±1.4), 18 (±1.1) and 16.3 (±2.5) mN m−1, respectively. The corresponding Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) between PTB7-Th and three acceptor polymers, estimated by the empirical relationship,31,32 were 0.21, 0.19, and 0.41 κ, respectively. The weaker interaction between PTB7-Th and asy-PNDI1FTVT than those of the other acceptor polymers indicates enhanced molecular miscibility, so a relatively small domain size is expected in this blend system. The symmetric polymers PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT showed a stronger self-assembly and presented lower miscibility with PTB7-Th, consistent with the AFM results. The asymmetric, lower crystallinity asy-PNDI1FTVT mixed well with the photoactive components (the donor polymer, PTB7-Th), efficiently forming a well-mixed blend film that facilitated efficient exciton dissociation (Fig. 4f).33 These results suggest that increasing the molecular miscibility between the donor and acceptor polymers favours the film morphology and prevents excessive self-aggregation, resulting in unfavourable phase domain separation.
Conclusions
To demonstrate the effects of molecular symmetry on the optoelectrical and physical properties of polymers, we replaced the conventional symmetric acceptor polymers (PNDITVT and PNDIFTVT) with an asymmetric acceptor polymer incorporating one fluorine atom-substituted TVT unit (asy-PNDI1FTVT). AFM images and GIWAXS data showed that the newly synthesized asy-PNDI1FTVT had significantly lower crystallinity than the symmetric polymers (PNDITVT and PNDI2FTVT) due to a lower self-aggregation property. Among the all-PSCs with an inverted structure, PTB7-Th:asy-PNDI1FTVT delivered the highest PCE (4.6%) and exhibited a well-mixed blend morphology between the donor and acceptor polymers. This morphology efficiently facilitated the charge dissociation process, achieving higher device performance than its symmetric counterparts. By improving the molecular miscibility with the counterpart donor polymer through the control of molecular symmetry, this design method would be an efficient strategy to achieve commercial potential of all-PSCs.
Experimental
Materials and characterization
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was purified in a solvent drying system (J. C. Meyer). All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co. and Sunatech. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements were performed using a Bruker BioSpin AG system operating at 600 MHz (Fig. S1†). Molecular weights were obtained by size-exclusion chromatography using LC solution (Shimadzu) with a chlorobenzene eluent at a flow rate of 50 μL min−1. The molecular weights and dispersity indices were calculated in relation to poly(styrene) standards. A PerkinElmer Pyris 1 DSC instrument was used for measuring thermograms of the resulting polymers under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1. UV–vis analysis was performed with a Mecasys Optizen Pop UV/V spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Flouromax-4 spectrophotometer (Horiba Scientific) with a monochromator and a hybrid photomultiplier detector (PMA Hybrid 40, PicoQuant GmbH). CV was performed in a three-electrode cell of a PowerLab model system (AD Instruments). The scan rate was 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 solution in acetonitrile. The working electrode was a carbon disk (∼0.05 cm2) coated with a thin polymer film. The counter and reference electrodes were platinum wire and an Ag/AgNO3 electrode, respectively. DFT calculations were simulated using the Gaussian 16 package at the B3LYP/631G(d,p) level for backbone structure optimization. The alkyl chains of model compounds were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the calculation process.
Synthesis of the monomers and copolymers

2-(Bromomethyl)thiophene (1).

After stirring at −78 °C for 1 h, chlorotrimethylsilane (11 mL, 26 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature. After stirring for 12 h, the reaction was slowly quenched with water (100 mL). The organic materials were extracted with diethyl ether, and the combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4.
