Remarkably, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have jumped from 3.8% of methyl ammonium lead halide, CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I), sensitized liquid solar cells in 2009, to more than 20% of all solid-state solar cells in 2015. Just over the past 6 years, numerous efforts have contributed to promote PSCs with more attractive properties, in preparation for future commercial applications, such as high PCE, high stability, high flexibility, large area, low cost, environmental friendliness, etc. In this review, we will concentrate on the recent advancements in the aspects of flexibility, stability and large scale of PSCs.

1. Introduction
Developing renewable energy sources has become an increasingly urgent task due to the depletion of fossil fuel supply and the growth of energy demand. Photovoltaic technology has been considered as the most promising strategy to address this problem.1,2 However to date, no solar cell module could satisfy the simultaneous requirements of high efficiency, low cost and long lifetime necessary for commercial applications. Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a new type of solar cell based on mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskites ABX3 (A = CH3NH3 (MA) or NH2CHNH2 (FA), B = Pb or Sn, X = Cl, Br, I or mixed halides), have rapidly attracted much attention and gradually become one of the most important all-solid-state solar cells.3–10 Until now, PSCs have reached the highest efficiency of over 20%,11,12 mainly owing to some fascinating properties of the mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskites ABX3, such as an appropriate band gap, a high absorption coefficient, a long charge diffusion length and solution processability.13–15
As indicated in Fig. 1 and Table 1, early in 2009, the first perovskite-sensitized solar cell based on a conventional liquid iodide/iodine redox couple electrolyte was reported, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81% for CH3NH3PbI3,16 which was further increased to 6.5% by using perovskite quantum dots in 2011.17 Later in 2012, a real breakthrough was achieved for PSCs with a maximum PCE of 9.7% by employing a solid hole-transporting material (HTM) 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD),18 which was quickly increased to 10.9% by replacing the n-type mesoporous TiO2 with insulating mesoporous Al2O3.19 In early 2013, a further enhanced PCE of over 12% for PSCs was reported by applying poly-triarylamine (PTAA) as the HTM,20,21 which promptly jumped to ∼15% in late 2013,22–25 when a new planar heterojunction configuration of PSCs was developed.23 Early in 2014, the PCEs of PSCs were further increased to 16.2% and 16.7% by using the spiro-OMeTAD derivatives as the HTM,26,27 which subsequently grew to 17.01% via controlling the size of the MAPbI3 cuboids.28 Later, this was increased to a confirmed efficiency of 17.9%,3 which then was further increased to 19.3% by engineering the interfaces in an ITO–PEIT/bl-Y doped-TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/spiro-OMeTAD/Au device structure.29 By 2015, one of the highest PCEs to date (up to 20.2%) was achieved in the FAPbI3-based PSCs.30 And, a PCE reaching 21% has been shown in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) chart.12 However, most of all the reported efficiencies were not officially defined values from internationally recognized test centers (i.e., NREL, AIST, etc.) that were capable of enforcing standardized conditions. According to the most recent solar cell efficiency tables (version 47), the current state-of-the-art PSC efficiency is 15.6% with 1.020 cm2 device area certified by the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).12

In general, the cell structure of PSCs can be classified into two types: porous and planar architectures.31 A typical porous PSC device consists of five or six components, that is, a transparent conductive substrate (i.e., fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), or indium tin oxide (ITO)), two metal oxide layers (one blocking TiO2 layer and one mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3 layer), a light absorber layer of perovskites, a HTM layer of spiro-OMeTAD, and a novel metal layer of Au or Ag. In the planar configuration, a mesoporous oxide film is not necessary because perovskite is capable of transporting electrons and holes; however, a thin blocking layer is still required to prevent direct contact between the conductive substrate and the HTM.32 The mesoporous oxide film in the porous PSCs can be a semiconductor material (e.g., TiO2) acting as the electron-transporting material (ETM), or an insulating material (e.g., Al2O3) just serving as a scaffold for the loading of perovskite. The porous PSCs frequently have a cell structure of the n–i–p junction (ETM/perovskite/HTM) by using the TiO2 ETM and spiro-OMeTAD HTM. In addition, an inverted planar heterojunction structure based on the p–i–n junction (HTM/perovskite/ETM) has as well been developed for PSCs usually using the [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) ETM and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) HTM.
During the past six years, most research efforts were put into the structure and crystal optimization of perovskite films via tuning the deposition method,33–41 the material type and fabrication route selection of blocking and scaffold layers,28,42–45 the HTM modification and interface/band-gap engineering.20,46–51 Meanwhile, quite a number of people have shown interest in other aspects of PSCs, for example, flexibility,52–55 stability,42,54,56,57 large scale,56,58,59 full printablility,60–64 semitransparency,65–69 being Pb-free,70,71 integration with other advanced devices,72–74etc. In this review, we will focus on summarizing the recent progress of PSCs in the fields of flexibility, stability and large scale, which will directly determine the commercialization possibility of PSCs in the near future.
2. Flexibility, stability and large area of PSCs
2.1 Flexibility
Nowadays, an important trend in electronic devices is their mechanical flexibility, which is an essential prerequisite for the development of bendable displays, conformable sensors, biodegradable electronic devices, portable electronic chargers and wearable electronic textiles.75–77 However, most of the popular solar cells, such as organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs), as well as PSCs, are mainly based on rigid substrates (e.g., FTO and ITO).78–82 The drawbacks of these substrates are their rigidity, weight, and frangibility which restrict the potential integration of solar cell devices into portable electronics and their conformability to any surface, even curved ones. In this regard, flexible solar cell modules with light weight, bendability, and easy modeling ability have attracted more and more attention.52–54,77,83–89
PSCs are promising as flexible solar cells due to the low temperature processing (<150 °C), all-solid-state structure, and high efficiency. In just a few years, flexible PSCs have made terrific progress and achieved a coveted PCE of 15.3% (Fig. 1 and Table 1), greatly exceeding other flexible solar cells. Roughly, the reported flexible PSCs can be divided into two types according to their cell structures, i.e., n–i–p junction and p–i–n junction, respectively.90 In the following section, we will separately discuss the current advancements of flexible PSCs based on these two types of device architectures.

2.1.1 Flexible PSCs based on the n–i–p junction. 
The transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) polymers coated with ITO act as the most common flexible substrates. The main shortcoming of these conductive PET and PEN substrates consists of their maximum practical processing temperatures of around 150 °C. Above this temperature range, these ITO-polymer substrates start to deform, and even melt at 235 °C.91 However, PSC devices with high PCEs, both in the planar heterojunction and porous cell structures, still require the crystalline TiO2 compact layer to serve as a selective contact for electron collection at the anode.31 Typically, this compact layer is prepared by spin-coating or spray pyrolysis of a solution of TiO2 precursor with subsequent heating treatment at 450–500 °C in order to transform the amorphous oxide layer into the crystalline anatase form, which provides good charge transport properties.92 Nevertheless, this high-temperature procedure precludes the use of either plastic substrates or roll-to-roll processing.
In this regard, many strategies have been exploited to circumvent such contradiction between the flexible ITO–PET/PEN substrates with low-temperature availability and the crystalline TiO2 compact layers with high-temperature requirement, for example, developing low-temperature routes to prepare TiO2 films,58,92–96 introducing other materials (e.g., ZnO,53,97–103 WO3,104 CuInS2,105 NiO,106 SnO2,107,108 CdSe,109 and Zn2SnO4 (ref. 55)) formed at low temperatures, and replacing ITO–PET/PEN substrates with Ti foils.110,111
Firstly, several technologies, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD),112 chemical sintering,113 electrophoretic deposition114 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD),115 have been developed to prepare the TiO2 compact layer for flexible DSSCs. Specially, the ALD method, which shows the deposition of higher quality films, as defined by lower pinhole density, and low-temperature compatibility with conductive plastic substrates, was employed to fabricate flexible PSCs.58,96 Brown's group adopted low temperature plasma assisted ALD of the cyclopentadienyl alkylamido titanium Ti(CpMe)(NMe2)3 precursor to deposit a TiO2 compact layer on ITO–PET substrates, followed by spin coating of a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold by using UV irradiation to remove organic binders and promote interparticle bonding, and thus obtained a best PCE of 8.4% for the resulting flexible PSCs (Table 1).58 In addition, Jung's group reported a flexible PSC based on a planar configuration (Table 1 and Fig. 2a), exhibiting a 12.2% PCE as a result of the employment of a sintering-free, 20 nm thick, amorphous, compact TiOx layer deposited by the ALD method.96 Importantly, mechanical bending of the devices worsened device performance by only 7% when a bending radius of 1 mm was used (Fig. 2b). The devices retained 100%, 95%, 50% of the initial PCEs after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 400 mm, 10 mm and 4 mm, respectively (Fig. 2c). It was indicated that the degradation of the device performance by the bending test was due to the crack formation from the ITO–PEN substrates, implying the good bending durability of the ALD-prepared TiOx layers in flexible PSCs.96

The insets show the real images of the flexible PSCs attached on the human neck, wrist, and finger corresponding to 400 nm, 10 nm and 4 nm bending radii, respectively. (c) Normalized PCE of flexible PSCs as a function of bending cycles with different radii. The insets show the real images of the flexible PSCs taken during the bending tests (reprinted with permission from ref. 96 (a–c): B. J. Kim, et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2015, 8, 916–921.

Secondly, ZnO is an efficient alternative to TiO2 due to its comparable energy levels, good electron transport properties and feasibility of low-temperature preparation. And then, ZnO in the form of nanoparticles (NPs),103 nanorods (NRs),100 and quantum dots (QDs),102 grown via chemical bath deposition, electrodeposition and sol–gel methods,53 has been used in flexible PSCs. For instance, the flexible PSCs based on a ZnO compact layer formed by electrodeposition and ZnO nanorods grown by chemical bath deposition at low temperatures (<100 °C) yielded a highest PCE of 2.62% (Table 1).100 In particular, Kelly's group introduced a thin film of ZnO NPs without sintering as an ETM both in the rigid PSCs (Fig. 3a) and flexible PSCs (Fig. 3b), and created best PCEs of 15.7% and 10.2% (Table 1), respectively. The flexible devices based on ITO–PET substrates showed good bending ability (Fig. 3c).53 Furthermore, ZnO QDs were deposited on the ITO–PET/Gr thin film, subsequently followed by an atmospheric plasma jet (APjet) treatment to improve the interfacial properties of the deposited layers, and achieved a highest PCE of 9.73% when they were organized into a flexible PSC (Table 1).102 Then, Ma's group contributed a carbon-based ZnO/MAPbI3/C planar heterojunction PSC prepared at low-temperatures without using any organic hole conductor and metal electrode, which showed PCEs up to 8% and 4% on FTO glass substrates and flexible ITO–PEN substrates (Table 1 and Fig. 3d). Bending tests demonstrated that the solar cell performance of such flexible devices could retain 80% of their initial PCE after 1000 times of bending (Fig. 3e and f).103

(d) Cross-sectional SEM image of the carbon-based PSCs, (e) photograph of the bending of the corresponding flexible PSCs around one pen with a diameter of 1 cm, and (f) PCE variations after 1000 times bending of two randomly selected flexible PSCs (red triangle or black square) around one pen with a diameter of 1 cm (reprinted with permission from ref. 53 (a–c): D. Liu and T. L. Kelly, Nature Photonics, 2014, 8, 133–138. Ref. 103 (d–f): H. Zhou, et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2015, 119, 4600–4605. Copyright © Nature Publishing Group and American Chemical Society. 
Except ZnO, several inorganic materials (e.g., WO3,104 CuInS2,105 NiO,106 SnO2,107,108 and CdSe,109) fabricated under low-temperature processing have been employed to replace TiO2 in PSCs as well. However, almost all these as-reported alternative materials were deposited on rigid substrates, but few of them have been tried to assemble the flexible PSCs. Recently, highly dispersed Zn2SnO4 NPs prepared at low-temperatures (<100 °C) were introduced into the development of flexible PSCs with a peak PCE of 15.3% (Table 1 and Fig. 4a). The performance of the flexible device retains over 95% of its initial efficiency even after 300 bending cycles. Remarkably, the introduction of the Zn2SnO4 film significantly improved the transmittance of the flexible ITO–PEN substrate from ∼75 to ∼90% over the entire range of wavelengths (Fig. 4b). This makes Zn2SnO4 a promising candidate as an electron-conducting material for high efficiency flexible PSC applications.55

Additionally, Shin's group chose Ti instead of TiO2 as an efficient barrier layer to deposit directly on ITO–PET flexible substrates through RF magnetic sputtering and the resulting flexible PSCs without any metal oxide layer presented a high PCE of ∼8.39% (Table 1).116 Moreover, considering that ITO suffers from some limitations, such as scarcity and high cost of indium, high temperature processing for deposition and inherent brittleness, which would hinder its application in large-scale production, Cao et al. spun coated Ag nanowires (NWs) onto flexible PET substrates to form a NW mesh (Fig. 4c), showing attractive transparent and conductive (TC) properties with a sheet resistance of 19.2 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 90.14% at a wavelength of 550 nm (Fig. 4d). A post fluorine-doped ZnO (FZO) layer was then deposited by the pulsed laser deposition method to improve the TC, stability and mechanical properties (Fig. 4e), and finally the as-organized flexible PSCs exhibited a PCE of 3.29% (Table 1 and Fig. 4c).101
Another design to overcome the intolerance of high temperature for ITO–PET substrates is employing flexible Ti substrates. However, the opaque nature of metal foils should be taken into consideration, that is, light has to irradiate from the counter electrode side. Hence, Jun et al. applied a silver thin film as a semi-transparent top electrode on a Ti substrate (Fig. 5a and b) and achieved a PCE of 6.15% (Table 1) for the resulting flexible PECs with impressive bending stability (Fig. 5c).110 Additionally, Watson's group prepared a flexible transparent counter electrode laminate by doctor blading a mixture of PEDOT:PSS and pressure sensitive adhesive onto a PET film embedded with a Ni grid (Fig. 5d and e). And the as-assembled flexible PSC devices yielded PCEs of 10.3% (Table 1) and exhibited minimal performance degradation in spite of repeated bend cycles (Fig. 5f).111

More impressively, Peng and his co-workers fabricated a novel fiber-shaped PSC through an easy dip-coating process, yielding a best PCE of 3.3% (Table 1). It is significant that the prepared fiber-shaped solar cells were flexible and could be woven into various structures, such as self-powering textiles, which are urgently required for miniature electronic devices.117


2.1.2 Flexible PSCs based on the p–i–n junction. 
Because of the high-temperature requirement for the fabrication of TiO2 compact layers via universal methods, most flexible PSCs based on ITO–PET/PEN substrates would adopt p–i–n structures (or inverted planar structures), in most cases composed of PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM architectures (Table 1),52,54,89,99,105,118–120 which are able to be deposited at a low temperature (<150 °C) and thus suitable for the organization of flexible PSCs using PET substrates.
Specially, Snaith's group employed a device structure of PET–ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/TiOx/Al and achieved a high PCE of over 6% for flexible PSCs (Table 1),52 while Kim and Lee's groups used a self-organized HTM (SOHEL) composed of a conducting polymer (e.g., PEDOT:PSS) and a perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) of tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoro-3,6-dioxa-4-methyl-7-octene-sulfonic acid copolymer to fabricate the flexible PSCs with a PCE as high as 8.0% (Table 1).89 Recently, Kaltenbrunner and his co-workers reported ultrathin (3 μm), highly flexible PSCs with a stabilized PCE up to 13% (Table 1 and Fig. 6a) and a power-per-weight as high as 23 W g−1 (Fig. 6b). They introduced a Cr2O3–Cr interlayer to effectively protect the metal top contacts from reactions with the perovskite and then facilitate the air-stable operation with excellent stability. More interestingly, these ultra-lightweight solar cells were successfully used to power aviation models (Fig. 6c and d).54

Kaltenbrunner, et al., Nat. Mater., 2015, 14, 1032–1039. Copyright © Nature Publishing Group). 
In addition, Bolink et al. used an AZO (Al-doped ZnO)/Ag/AZO coated PET foil as the flexible substrate (Fig. 7a and b) and obtained a PCE as high as 7% for the resulting flexible PSC (Table 1). More importantly, they found that this flexible device was very robust leading to a decline of the PCE of only 0.1% after 50 bending cycles (Fig. 7c).99 In particular, Kelly's group selected an alternative transparent conductive electrode of highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (HC-PEDOT) to ITO for the fabrication of PET-based flexible PSCs (Fig. 7d). HC-PEDOT electrodes can be prepared with low sheet resistance, high surface coverage, high transmittance (Fig. 7e), and highly favourable mechanical properties (Fig. 7f) by using simple fabrication methods. The resulting devices were entirely ITO-free, and displayed PCEs up to 7.6% (Table 1) with very little hysteresis.120

2.2 Stability
The long-term stability of PSCs is another big remaining challenge for PSCs, heavily relating to their commercial viability. To date, the degradation mechanism of perovskite materials when subjected to environmental stresses such as moisture and heating cycles has not been clearly understood.121 To realize the successful commercialization of all solid-state PSCs, it is necessary to achieve devices with high stability in addition to high efficiencies. Recently, large progress on enhancing the long-term stability of PSCs has been made.
Firstly, working at the deposition and modification of perovskite films is one effective way to improve the device stability.13,35,57,122–126 For example, it is found that the application of a mixed halide perovskite is helpful for the stability of PSCs. A mixed halide perovskite of MAPbI3−xBrx (x = 0–3) could be realized by using a simple solution mixture of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3.13 The mixed halide perovskite presented band gap tuning and color control covering almost the entire visible spectrum (Fig. 8a and b) due to the band gap difference between triiodide and tribromide perovskite. In a humidity soaking test, cubic phase MAPbI3−xBrx (x ≥ 0.6) cells have better stability than the tetragonal (pseudocubic) phase MAPbI3−xBrx (x < 0.6) cells after 20 days of stability testing (Fig. 8c). The inclusion of bromide in MAPbI3 will substantially enhance the stability of the MA+ cation in the lattice.3,13 Another, Grätzel's group, modified the surface of MAPbI3 perovskite by spin-coating its precursor solution in the presence of butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride. It was revealed that the phosphonic acid ammonium additive acted as a crosslink between neighbouring grains in the perovskite structure, through strong hydrogen bonding of the –PO(OH)2 and –NH3+ terminal groups to the perovskite surface (Fig. 8d). The additives facilitated the incorporation of the perovskite within a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, as well as the growth of a uniform perovskite layer at the surface, which consequently improved the resulting PCE from 8.8 to 16.7% and particularly enhanced the device moisture stability when compared to pristine perovskite (Fig. 8e and f).57

(d) Schematic illustration of two neighbouring grain structures, (e) variation of PCE with time for unsealed PSCs stored in ambient air at ∼55% humidity in the dark, and (f) evolution of normalized device performance parameters measured under 10% full sun intensity during ageing at 85 °C in the dark (reprinted with permission from ref. 13 (a–c): J. H. Noh, et al., Nano Lett., 2013, 13, 1764–1769. Ref. 57 (d–f): X. Li, et al., Nat. Chem., 2015, 7, 703–711. Copyright © Nature Publishing Group and American Chemical Society). 
Secondly, another method to make stable PSC devices is to control the HTM layers, for example, adding some additives to the typical HTMs (i.e., spiro-OMeTAD127,128 and PEDOT:PSS129), and developing other HTMs.130–133 Snaith's group employed a P3HT/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)–PMMA double layer as a HTM in PSCs (Fig. 9a).134 The P3HT polymer-based HTM showed superior temperature stability compared with the single-molecule based spiro-OMeTAD. The PSC demonstrated remarkable thermal (Fig. 9b) and moisture stability (Fig. 9c). The PCE dropped to 20% of initial efficiency after heating the cell at 80 °C for 20 min (Fig. 9b), which exhibited a temperature coefficient of ∼0.33% °C−1. This result is similar to that of the copper indium gallium (di) selenide (CIGS) solar cell. The hydrophobic PMMA showed a significant waterproof property, which retarded the decomposition of the perovskite layer by water vapor.83,134 Zheng's group employed a functionalized nanographene (perthiolated trisulfur-annulated hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene, TSHBC) as the HTM in PSCs to achieve efficient charge extraction from perovskite (Fig. 9d), yielding a best efficiency of 12.8% in pristine form, which is readily improved up to 14.0% by doping with graphene sheets into TSHBC to enhance the charge transfer (Table 2). Moreover, the devices show improved stability under AM 1.5 illumination in the humidity about 45% without encapsulation (Table 2 and Fig. 9e), primarily due to the hydrophobic nature of TSHBC (Fig. 9f).133

Thirdly, introducing some stable inorganic materials into the cell structures is also considered as a feasible strategy for enhancing cell stability. The participation of insulating Al2O3,135–137 carbon,62,138,139 Cr2O3/Cr,54 NiO,140,141 SnO2,107 ZnO,97,142 and NiMgLiO56 in PSCs has been reported to strengthen their device stability (Table 2). Han et al. fabricated a HTM-free and carbon-based PSC, composed of a simple mesoscopic TiO2/ZrO2/C triple layer as a scaffold to host the perovskite absorber. The 10 μm thick carbon back contact layer played an important role in resistance to water. And this cell exhibited excellent stability under AM 1.5 conditions over 1000 h (Table 2).62 Recently, Chen et al. developed heavily p-doped (p+) NixMg1−xO and n-doped (n+) TiOx contacts to extract selectively photo-generated charge carriers from an inverted planar MAPbI3–PCBM film architecture. The cells retained 97% of their initial PCE (16.2%, area = 1.02 cm2) after keeping them in the dark for 1000 hours, while exposing the cells for 1000 hours under short-circuit conditions to full sunlight from a solar simulator, resulted in a PCE degradation of less than 10% (Table 2).56
2.3 Large scale
Although the recorded PCE of PSCs is already comparable to that of silicon solar cells, they were predominantly obtained by the lab-scale process of spin coating (typically, active area (AA) < 0.2 cm2). Therefore, a large-scale production process, which preferably includes a cost-competitive roll-to-roll printing process, is another big challenge for the future commercialization of PSCs. To date, only a few studies have described the use of scalable solution processes to make PSC devices.32,56,58,59,143–145 Large-scale PSCs are now just at a beginning stage, suggesting that there is more space for innovation and breakthrough.
The practical execution of the large-scale PSCs crucially depends on the processing applied for the perovskite deposition. Therefore, some methods probably related to large-area production have been attempted to use in PSC fabrication (Table 3).32,56,58,59,143–145 For example, spray coating, one of the most promising cost-effective roll-to-roll compatible processes, was used to print perovskite films on TiO2/ITO–PET substrates to produce the flexible PSCs with a PCE of 8.1% (Table 3, AA = 6.5 mm2), which remained at about 60–90% after more than 1000 bending cycles.145 Inkjet printing was applied to convert the spin-coated PbI2 layer to the perovskite layer and to print carbon electrodes, reaching a best PCE of 12.3% for the optimized PSCs (Table 3, AA = 4 mm2). This process is promising since it is scalable and vacuum free.144 A sequential layer by-layer vacuum sublimation method was developed to form a uniform perovskite film with unusual large-scale homogeneous crystalline structures, presenting a PCE as high as 15.4% for PSC devices (Table 3, AA = 5 mm2).32 A scalable doctor blade printing method under ambient conditions was adopted to prepare a large-area perovskite film (Table 3, 15 mm × 40 mm, for 10 cells), and yield efficient printable PSCs with a PCE of 10.15%.143 The electrodeposition technique was exploited to form a PbO2 layer on the TiO2 scaffold, which was then subjected to chemical bath conversion to sequentially generate PbI2 and MAPbI3 perovskite, and the cell area of such electrodeposited PSCs could be easily scaled up to 4 cm2 with an excellent perovskite film uniformity and a PCE of 4.47% (Table 3).146 More impressively, the slot-die coating method with gas-quenching treatment was successfully used to produce pinhole-free PbI2, ZnO and doped P3HT layers. As a result, the best PCE of 11.96% (Table 3, AA = 10 mm2) was obtained from devices fabricated by slot-die coating under ambient conditions.59 Han et al. exploited a hole-conductor-free fully printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cell with a peak PCE of 12.8% (Table 3, AA = 7 mm2) based on the carbon counter electrode (Fig. 10), which has the potential to realize large-scale fabrication in the near future.60–64

Even so, the real active area of PSCs with high performance is still small (Table 3). For instance, Zhu et al. reported the fabrication of planar PSCs with active areas ranging from 0.12 to 1.2 cm2. PSC devices with an active area of 1.2 cm2 presented over 15% stabilized PCE, while a small area of 0.12 cm2 has a PCE of 18.3%.147 Chen et al. showed a PCE up to 16.2% of the PSC device with a cell area of 1.02 cm2.56 Moreover, an efficiency of 15.6% for a 1.02 cm2 PSC cell fabricated by the National Institute of Materials Science, Tsukuba, Japan has been measured at the AIST.12,148
3. Summary and outlook
We have briefly summarized the current development of PSCs in the fields of flexibility, stability and large scale. In the past six years, continuously increasing efforts have been dedicated to manufacturing high-performance PSCs based on organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials, because PSCs are considered as a promising cost-effective alternative to silicon-based solar cells, due to their advantages of low cost, high-efficiency, and simple assembly processes. More importantly, PSCs present potential prospects for use in all-solid-state and flexible solar cells which are attractive power solutions for future wearable device technology. However, flexibility, stability and large scale are three essential issues for this subject.
So far, the most popularly used flexible substrates are ITO-coated PET/PEN foils, and the research focus for flexible PSCs mainly centers on the exploitation of low-temperature methods for the preparation of effective blocking and/or scaffold layers in n–i–p PSCs, as well as the employment of p–i–n PSCs due to their low-temperature operability. In addition, other bendable conductive substrates, such as AZO/Ag/AZO, HC-PEDOT and Ag NW-coated PET foils, and Ti metal sheets, have also been tried to make flexible PSCs. Finally, a fiber-shaped PSC device has been developed as well with a peak PCE of 3.3%. As for stability, most efforts focus on modifying the surface of perovskite films by introducing some effective organic groups and adjusting the interface between perovskite materials and ETMs/HTMs by using some stable organic (e.g., additive to spiro-OMeTAD or new HTMs)/inorganic (e.g., Al2O3 buffer layer) materials in order to strengthen the moisture resistance of PSC devices. With regard to large scale, several techniques including spray coating, inkjet printing, vacuum sublimation, doctor blade printing and slot-die coating methods have been considered as promising strategies to realize the roll-to-roll processed PSCs. Remarkably, fully printable solar cells will be the best expectation for PSCs. Nevertheless, a high-performance PSC device concurrently integrating these three merits has not been reported even at the laboratory level, and more importantly, maintaining high efficiency, high flexibility and long term stability close to those of laboratory prototypes over total large-area modules produced in an industrially applicable manufacturing line is a huge challenge for the future industrialization of PSCs. Consequently, more creative concepts and original studies are persistently necessary to push the upper efficiency limit, bending, scaling and repeatability for the market promotion of PSCs.
