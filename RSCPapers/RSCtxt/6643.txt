    , Accepted 7th September 2015First published on 7th September 2015AbstractAs solution-processable and low-cost semiconductors, organolead halide perovskites are attracting enormous attention for application as promising photovoltaic absorbers capable of a high-power conversion efficiency over 20%. A mesoporous layer of titanium oxide, which requires sintering at high temperature (400–500 °C), serves as an efficient electron collector as well as a scaffold for crystal nucleation. To enable the rapid low-cost manufacture and construction of lightweight flexible solar cells built on plastic films, a sinter-free electron collection layer (mesoporous and compact layer) is required. In this study, a highly crystalline layer of brookite (orthorhombic TiO2) was prepared by a sinter-free solution process as an efficient mesoporous electron collector. Strong inter-particle necking of the brookite nanoparticles by a dehydration–condensation reaction enabled the formation of a highly uniform mesoporous layer at low temperature (130–150 °C). In comparison with an anatase TiO2 meso-structure prepared by high temperature (500 °C) sintering, the brookite electron collector exhibits a photovoltaic performance with a greater fill factor and 100 mV-higher open-circuit voltage.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials represented by CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) have been intensively studied for high efficiency hybrid solar cells.1–6 As solution-processable (printable) and low-cost semiconductors, the hybrid perovskites are promising photovoltaic absorbers capable of a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%.2 High efficiency is generally enabled by the preparation of a high quality void-less perovskite layer of uniform thickness and the quality of an underlying scaffold and charge transport layers that can hold perovskite in a continuous junction. Here, a mesoporous (mp) layer of metal oxide semiconductors serves as an efficient electron collector as well as scaffold for crystal nucleation.6 Among the metal oxides, TiO2 has been the most extensively employed mp electron collector in junction with perovskites. Here, the crystalline form of TiO2 studied was anatase or an anatase-rich type (e.g., Degussa P-25), which is also the common TiO2 semiconductor employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Unlike DSSC, however, the morphology and surface property of the mp TiO2 layer as the scaffold have a significant influence on the quality of the perovskite layer (e.g., crystal size, uniformity, surface coverage on the mp layer) that determines the photovoltaic performance. To date, anatase TiO2,3–5 rutile TiO2,7 ZnO,8 SnO2,9 WO3,10 and SrTiO3 (ref. 11) have been examined as metal oxide electron collectors and scaffolds in perovskite solar cells. Anatase TiO2 has been further studied for surface modification to improve the contact between the mp TiO2 layer and the perovskite layer.12–14
The formation of mp metal oxide films usually requires a sintering process at high temperature (400–500 °C) by using a mesoscopic coating paste. To ensure inter-particle necking and the adhesiveness of TiO2 nanoparticles on a conductive glass, a polymer binder is used as an additive in the precursor paste, which is to then removed after sintering to ensure high conductivity. In contrast, binder-free mesoscopic paste or slurry is required to develop a sinter-free low temperature process for the fabrication of solar cells. Such processes enable rapid low-cost manufacture and the construction of lightweight flexible solar cells built on plastic films.8,15 However, low temperature processes tends to limit the cell performance in terms of voltage and efficiency due to the low carrier collection ability of TiO2 in comparison with the high performance of sintered TiO2 layers.
In this study, we employed brookite nano-TiO2 crystal for the mp scaffold and electron collector of perovskite solar cells for the first time. A significant merit of brookite TiO2 is that a high quality uniform mp-TiO2 layer can be prepared by a sinter-free solution process (<150 °C) from a binder-free precursor paste. The surface of the highly crystalline brookite TiO2 exhibits a high affinity for inter-particle necking and enables the formation of the mp structure, through a dehydration–condensation reaction of the surface hydroxyl groups, at a temperature below 150 °C.16 Furthermore, brookite TiO2 has a conduction band (CB) edge potential slightly (0.01–0.19 eV) more negative than that of anatase TiO2.17 This property of brookite has achieved a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) in the liquid junction structure of DSSC.18–20 In this report, we demonstrate that the brookite TiO2-based meso-structure functions as an excellent scaffold and electron collector for the hybrid perovskite, MAPbI3−xClx, prepared by a one-step solution process, and achieves good photovoltaic performance in terms of high voltage and efficiency with hysteresis-less characteristics.
Experimental
A TiO2 hole-blocking layer (anatase, thickness ∼50 nm) as a common structure was formed on the surface of an F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate (10 Ω sq−1, Nihon sheet glass, 1.1 mm in thickness) by a spray pyrolysis technique using a Ti(acac)2(OC5H7)2-containing ethanol solution at 500 °C. For the complete low-temperature fabrication of perovskite solar cells, the low-temperature processing of a hole-blocking layer such as by chemical vapour deposition21,22 can be employed. However, in this study, the layer was prepared at high temperature in order to compare conventional anatase TiO2 mp layer, sintered at 500 °C on the blocking layer, with the brookite mp layer. An aqueous brookite TiO2 slurry (PECC-B01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., particle size 10–20 nm) was diluted to 33 vol% with ethanol by the addition of a small amount of ethylene glycol mono-tert-butyl ether and was then spin-coated on the above blocking layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrate was dried at 130–150 °C for 1 h. To form the anatase TiO2 mp layer, a TiO2 paste (18NR-T, Dyesol, particle size ∼20 nm) was diluted to 25 wt% with ethanol and spin-coated on the compact layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then the dried substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 1 h. For the Al2O3 mp layer, an Al2O3 slurry (Aldrich, <50 nm in isopropanol) was diluted to 5 wt% with 2-propanol and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and sintered at 500 °C.
A mixed solution of CH3NH3I (2.7 M) and PbCl2 (0.9 M) in N,N-dimethylformamide was spin-coated on the above mp layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 90 min in dry air to form the perovskite MAPbI3−xClx layer. A 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenyl amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) solution in chlorobenzene (0.12 M) containing 0.034 M bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt and 0.098 M 4-tert-butylpyridine was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and aged overnight in dry air. Finally, Au was vapour-deposited on the top of spiro-OMeTAD as a counter electrode. The photovoltaic characteristics of all the devices with an active area of 0.09 cm2 were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under 1 sun illumination by using a Peccell Technologies PEC-L01 solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The IPCE action spectra of the device were measured in ambient air at room temperature on Peccell Technologies' PEC-S20 action spectrum measurement set-up. For characterization of the mp layer and perovskite layer, an X-ray diffractometer (D8 Discover, Brucker) with CuKα radiation source, a scanning electron microscope (SU8000, HITACHI) and an atomic force microscope (SPM-9500J3, SHIMADZU) were employed. The water contact angle was measured with a contact angle meter (CA-X, KYOWA).
Results and discussion
An aqueous mesoscopic precursor solution of brookite was prepared from a slurry of nano-crystalline brookite TiO2 (supplied from Peccell Technologies, Inc., particle size, 10–20 nm) by the homogeneous dispersion of brookite nanoparticles with a water/ethanol mixture by means of a rotation revolution mixer at temperatures of 20–35 °C. To avoid the spontaneous aggregation of brookite nanoparticles, ethylene glycol mono-tert-butyl ether was added to the mixture. The resultant precursor contained brookite TiO2 at a concentration of 5–8 wt%. For electrode fabrication, a mesoporous brookite layer was built on a thin compact anatase TiO2 layer. The brookite precursor solution was spin-coated on a thin anatase TiO2 compact layer (∼50 nm) covering the surface of an FTO transparent conductive layer on glass substrate. The thickness of the brookite meso-structure was ∼250 nm. The substrate was subjected to drying under ambient air at 130–150 °C to cause a dehydration–condensation reaction at the surface of the brookite nanoparticles leading to inter-particle bonding (–Ti–OH + HO–Ti– → –Ti–O–Ti + H2O).16 This simple drying treatment converted the brookite precursor to a mp brookite layer. Fig. 1a shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the mp brookite layer thus prepared on the FTO substrate. In comparison, Fig. 1b shows an mp layer of anatase TiO2 as a reference prepared on the same FTO substrate made by sintering a commercial 18 NR-T paste at 500 °C. Here, the average grain size of the brookite and anatase TiO2 are 18.5 ± 5.0 nm and 18.1 ± 5.3 nm, respectively. SEM images of brookite TiO2 particles suspended in the precursor solution are given in the ESI Fig. S1,† which shows polyhedron-shaped particles with substantially the same size as in the above mp layer. We can see in Fig. 1a and b that sinter-free brookite TiO2 forms a more uniform and denser layer in comparison with sintered anatase TiO2. The smooth surface of the brookite mp layer is more clearly seen on the atomic force microscopy (AFM), as exhibited in Fig. 1c and d. Here, the root mean square surface roughness (Rms) of the brookite layer was 9.09 nm, while the mp anatase layer gave a rougher surface with Rms of 14.59 nm. The strong connection of brookite particles are likely to cause a flatter and more compact layer compared to anatase. Fig. 1e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the brookite mp layer. The brookite TiO2 layer exhibits diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.4°, 30.8°, 36.3°, 37.5°, 40.2°, 42.3°, 46.1°, 48.0° and 49.2°, which correspond to the diffraction pattern of the brookite phase (ICDD 29-1360). The peak at 25.4° is the overlap of two peaks at 25.3° and 25.7° due to the wide diffraction peak based on the small crystal size of the brookite layer. This result shows the successful formation of brookite TiO2 mp layers. The crystal size of brookite TiO2 was 9.7 nm, as estimated using Scherrer's equation23 and from the peak at 30.8°.

Photovoltaic films of perovskite, MAPbI3−xClx, were prepared based on the Cl-mixed single-step synthetic route and spin-coating method, as described previously.4,6 Perovskite solar cells were fabricated by spin-coating spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transport material (HTM) and by vacuum-depositing Au as a counter electrode. Cross-sectional images of the perovskite solar cells with the brookite TiO2 mp layers are shown in Fig. 2a. The average thickness of the TiO2 hole-blocking layer, the mp TiO2 layer and the perovskite layer were ∼50 nm, ∼250 nm and ∼300 nm, respectively.

Even though the mp TiO2 layer was prepared by a sinter-less low temperature coating (130–150 °C), the brookite-based perovskite solar cells achieved the best performance, with a PCE up to 14.3%. The high efficiency of the cell is supported by a high VOC and fill factor (FF). The VOC of the brookite-based cells, 0.97–1.00 V, is approximately 100 mV larger than that of conventional anatase mp TiO2-based cells with an equivalent structure and grain size. One reason for the higher VOC in brookite-based solar cells is the negative CB edge potential of brookite TiO2 compared to anatase (0.01–0.19 eV more negative,17 ESI Fig. S2†) electron selective semiconductors of more negative CB edge can result in a reduction in the short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) due to the lower driving energy of electron injection from the perovskite layer.11,24 However, brookite TiO2-based solar cells exhibit a JSC equivalent to those of the anatase TiO2 cells by maintaining a high value (∼20 mA cm−2). This relation is demonstrated by IPCE showing equal characteristics (70%–80%). Taking into account the distribution of the density-of-state in CB, the higher CB level of brookite can still accept electrons from the CB edge of MAPbI3−xClx (∼3.9 eV vs. vacuum1) as carrier transfer across the TiO2-perovskite interface is enhanced by the good structural continuity of the heterojunction, which we expect for the brookite TiO2. N.-G. Park et al. compared rutile and anatase TiO2 mp layers as an electron collection layer for perovskite solar cells.25 Rutile TiO2, which has low electron conductivity, exhibits slower recombination than anatase, but its VOC was lower than for anatase, due to the more positive CB edge potential. In this study, brookite, which has low electron conductivity19 and a negative CB edge potential, may decrease recombination without causing voltage loss and can result in high VOC and FF.
It is known that perovskite solar cells exhibit high PCE even with use an insulating mp layer such as Al2O3.4,6,26 In this case, the insulating mp layer, incapable of electron collection, works only as a scaffold for perovskite crystal growth. Here the large carrier diffusion lengths of MAPbI3−xClx (>μm (ref. 27–29)) enable excited electrons to diffuse through the perovskite layer (∼300 nm) and directly transfer to a TiO2 hole-blocking layer on the FTO electrode.4 The absence of carrier transfer across the interface of the mp layer and perovskite is assumed to give a small voltage loss and relatively high VOC. For comparison, we also examined a perovskite cell made on a mp Al2O3 as the scaffold, in which the mp layer of Al2O3 was prepared by high temperature sintering (500 °C) similar to for anatase TiO2. For this reference cell, the thickness (∼250 nm) and grain size (19.7 ± 4.6 nm, estimated by SEM observation (ESI Fig. S3†)) were adjusted to similar to the brookite mp layer. The result showed that the Al2O3-based cell could generate a high VOC compared to the brookite-based cell. However, the cell exhibited low FF and was accompanied by significant hysteresis in the J–V characteristics (Fig. 2b and Table 1). The low FF may reflect an increase in the internal resistance due to the non-conductive Al2O3 scaffold and long distance carrier diffusion through the perovskite layer. The series resistance estimated from the J–V curves at VOC was 53 ± 8 Ω and 73 ± 7 Ω (n = 4) for the perovskite solar cells with brookite TiO2 and Al2O3, respectively. As a result, brookite TiO2 yielded a higher efficiency backed by a high FF, which reflects the efficient electron injection from the perovskite to the brookite TiO2. It is noteworthy that the low-temperature processed brookite TiO2 electron collector could maintain a high FF and low internal resistance to achieve a higher efficiency than obtained by sintered mp TiO2 and Al2O3.
On the other hand, the morphology and crystalline quality of the perovskite layer being affected by the underlying mp TiO2 layer strongly affects the solar cell performance.30,31 In addition to a high VOC, another significant nature of brookite TiO2 as an mp collector is its hysteresis-less performance in perovskite cells. The anatase-based cell exhibits hysteretic J–V curves that give larger current density for the backward scan (from −0.1 V to 1.1 V direction) than the forward scan (from 1.1 V to −0.1 V) (Fig. 2b). In contrast, brookite-based cell always exhibited J–V curves with little or no hysteresis. FF was also improved in the hysteresis-less J–V curves. This difference can be explained by the morphology of the perovskite layer formed on the mp layers. The surface morphologies of perovskite layers on the anatase and brookite mp layers are displayed in Fig. 3a and b. While the interiors of both mp TiO2 layers were filled with perovskite, an excess of perovskite is covering the surface of the mp layers. Here, the surface of the anatase TiO2 mp layer was partially covered (capped) with perovskite layer. In contrast, the surface of the brookite TiO2 layer was fully covered with a large grain perovskite layer, thus showing a dramatic improvement in surface coverage. In the mesoscopic structure, the high coverage of perovskite on the mp layer reduces the contact and electrical leakage between the mp layer and HTM and enhances VOC and FF. XRD profiles of the perovskite layers formed on the mp layers are shown in Fig. 3c. Characteristic peaks of the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite layer at 14.2° and 28.5° based on diffraction at (110) and (220) planes32 are observed for perovskite formed on both mp layers. We estimated the perovskite crystal size from the diffraction peak at 14.2° using Scherrer's equation.23 The crystal diameter of perovskite was 81.5 nm on the brookite mp layer, which was more than twice the size, 33.8 nm, obtained for the anatase mp layer. Further, the narrower diffraction bands and higher intensity indicate that the perovskite layer formed on brookite TiO2 has a higher crystallinity than that on anatase TiO2. For the hysteresis-less performance of brookite TiO2 cells, we consider that the large grain size of perovskite with less grain boundary of perovskite improves the interfacial structure at the heterojunction between TiO2 and perovskite that we found to play a role in causing hysteresis.33,34 Such difference in perovskite crystal morphology may be ascribed to the different properties in the crystal phase of TiO2. For example, the water contact angle of mp anatase and brookite were measured to be 7.7 ± 0.8° and 1.4 ± 0.1°, respectively (n = 3), for the films of Fig. 1c and d. The higher hydrophilicity of the brookite surface showed an apparently quicker spread of water on the surface. Since the hydrophilic surface increases the adhesion of perovskite crystal on the semiconductor layer,35 the large crystal size and high surface coverage of perovskite was achieved on brookite TiO2. The active brookite surface,36–39 such as in the (210) plane, may be the cause of the adhesive characteristics of the mp brookite surface.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we employed brookite TiO2 as a conductive mp scaffold for perovskite solar cells. The significant advantage of brookite TiO2 is thus addressed to the low-temperature solution processability without losing, and even improving, the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. The low-temperature fabrication of a MAPbI3−xClx solar cell with brookite TiO2 mp collector achieved a PCE of up to 14.3% without hysteretic behaviour in the photovoltaic performance. In comparison with conventional anatase mp TiO2, VOC was improved by ∼100 mV in the brookite-based perovskite cell. The brookite layer works as an excellent scaffold for the uniform crystallization of perovskite by achieving a high surface coverage with large crystal grains, which can increase FF and reduce hysteresis in the J–V curves of solar cells. We could also fabricate brookite-based flexible perovskite solar cells on plastic substrates, which will be reported elsewhere.
