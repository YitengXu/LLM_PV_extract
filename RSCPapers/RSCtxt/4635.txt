    , Accepted 23rd April 2009First published on 9th June 2009AbstractThis article follows our previous work on the synthesis and characterization of pi-conjugated dendrimers for use in organic solar cells. Here we discuss five new thiophene-based dendrimers that were synthesized in order to study the relationship between their chemical structures and electronic properties. Three of these dendrimers incorporate acetylene spacers, included to relieve steric strain, between the thiophene arms and phenyl cores used in previous studies. Only a small effect on the electronic properties is observed upon inclusion of the acetylene spacer in the three-arm dendrimer, 3G1-2S-Ac. In contrast, a decrease in the bandgap is observed for the four-arm dendrimer, 4G1-2S-Ac, due to a reduction of interactions between the arms in the more sterically congested 1,2,4,5-arrangement around the phenyl core, resulting in delocalization of the exciton through the phenyl core. Incorporation of electron-withdrawing cyano groups on the phenyl core of the three-arm dendrimer, 3G1-2S-CN, resulted in a very large (∼0.5 eV) decrease in the bandgap, due to stabilization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and the low energy absorption band in this material is attributed to a transition with significant intramolecular charge-transfer character. The electronic properties of three- and four-arm dendrimers with electron-donating dibutylaniline moieties attached to the end of the thiophene dendron, 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N respectively, are almost identical, indicating that they are dominated by the arms, with no through-core communication allowed, even for the para-linked arms of 4G1-2S-N. However, there is a significant increase in the molar absorptivity of these materials, concomitant with significant broadening of the absorption spectrum, which is an important attribute in light-harvesting applications.
Introduction

Thiophene based materials have emerged as some of the most promising organic materials for use in light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1,2 field effect transistors (OFETs),3 and photovoltaic (OPV) applications.4 The properties of such materials can be tuned by the length of conjugated chain,5 relative stereochemistry (e.g. regio-regular vs. regio-random polythiophenes),6 and the introduction of functional groups into the backbone or as sidegroups.7 While the majority of research has focused on either straight-chain polymers or small molecules (mostly well defined oligomers), more recently dendrimers have found use in organic electronic applications.8 For example thiophene has been incorporated into dendrimers to tune the emissive color of OLEDs2 and also as electropolymerizable groups for electrode modification.9 The synthesis and properties of all thiophene10 and mixed thiophene–benzene11–13dendrimers have also been described, with promising results for light harvesting applications.

        Dendrimers combine some features of both polymers and small molecules, which make them attractive for molecular electronic device applications. Like polymers, they can be processed in solution and can be deposited as thin films using inexpensive methods like spin casting, spraying or printing. In contrast to polymers, but like small molecules, dendrimers have precisely defined molecular weights and high batch-to-batch reproducibility, features that facilitate derivation of structure–property relationships and can improve consistency in device fabrication. Additionally the smaller molecular weights as compared to polymers make quantum chemical calculations easier, including some calculations on the full molecule rather than simply a small fragment.14
Previously we have reported on the synthesis and characterization of phenyl-cored thiophene dendrimers,11,13–15 including theoretical studies14 and their performance in photovoltaic devices.15 That work has investigated the effects of changing the number and arrangement of dendrons around the core, the degree of dendron branching, and the total number of thiophene units in each dendron on the optical and electronic properties of the molecules in solution and in films. OPV devices that use these molecules as light-harvesters and electron donors have consistently shown high open circuit voltages, up to 910 mV, and power conversion efficiencies near or below 1% under AM1.5 simulated light at 1 sun.15 One of the primary reasons for the low short circuit currents observed was the high bandgap (>2.1 eV) of the dendrimers, which makes them poor absorbers of the solar spectrum. Nonetheless, these studies have established the feasibility of dendrimers as donors in OPV devices, and they have demonstrated that control of the optical and structural properties of the dendrimers is attainable by changing simple features of the molecules (e.g. the number and generation of the dendrons) without significant changes to the fundamental building blocks of a phenyl core and branched oligothiophene dendrons.
For further progress toward using dendrimers in efficient OPV devices, the bandgap of the molecules must be lowered. In this work we show that chemical substitutions commonly utilized in polymers to tune the structure and bandgap are also feasible in dendrimers. Specifically, we have incorporated either weak or strong electron withdrawing functionality, such as acetylene and cyano groups, respectively, or donating functionality, in this case a dibutylaniline group, into dendrimer architectures similar to our previously reported materials. In our earlier work we showed some evidence that steric effects around the core limit the effective conjugation lengths of some of our materials.13,14 Some of the new dendrimers presented here include acetylene bridges between the core and thiophene arms that decrease the steric crowding, particularly in the case of the 4-arm dendrimer, and allow more efficient conjugation of the π systems. Additionally the cyano substituents in one dendrimer give rise to an absorption with significant charge-transfer character at low energy, thus red-shifting the absorption of the dendrimers and improving the overlap with the solar spectrum. Finally, incorporation of dibutylaniline groups at the dendron ends induces steric strain resulting in localization of the excitation to the dendrons themselves.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterisation
The synthesis of the dendrimers was accomplished by a convergent route,16 where the dendrons were synthesized first and then coupled to the core. This route offers the advantage of having only a few steps where the same reaction must occur at several sites on each molecule, thus increasing overall yield. Furthermore, since these dendrimers have solubilizing alkyl groups at the periphery, building the molecules in this way allows each intermediate to be soluble in the required solvents.
The synthesis of the acetylene dendron 4 is shown in Scheme 1. Starting with dendron 1, which has been previously described,13 deprotonation with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) followed by addition of elemental iodine provided 2, a suitable coupling partner for the Sonogashira reaction with trimethylsilylacetylene, in 96% yield. This coupling, catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and CuI, was carried out at room temperature to give intermediate 3, which was used immediately in the next reaction. Deprotection, using a solution of sodium hydroxide in a mixture of methanol and water, gave dendron 4 in 61% overall yield from 2 after column chromatography.

The synthesis of the amino terminated dendron 11 is summarized in Scheme 2. Endgroup 7 was synthesized in 93% yield via a Suzuki coupling between thiophene boronic acid, 5, and 4-bromo-N,N-dibutylaniline, 6. Deprotonation of the α-position of the thiophene with n-BuLi, followed by quenching with tributyltinchloride, gave the stannylated intermediate 8, which was taken on immediately in a Stille coupling with 2,3-dibromothiophene. Using an excess of the stannylated material both brominated positions were successfully substituted, resulting in dendron 9, with an overall yield for the two steps from intermediate 7 of 96%. Another cycle of deprotonation and stannylation, resulting in 10, followed by Stille coupling with 5-bromobithiophene gave the dendrimer arm 11 in 57% overall yield. Initially the sequence from 9 to 11 went in very poor yield, with significant mass of 9 recovered from the reaction mixture. When deprotonation of 9 with excess n-BuLi was followed immediately by addition of tributyltinchloride and the addition of reagents repeated, the yield increased to the reported acceptable 57%.

The 3- and 4-arm acetylene dendrimers and the cyano substituted dendrimer, 13, 15 and 17, respectively, were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling of dendron 4 with the appropriate core (Scheme 3). 1,3,5-tribromobenzene, 12, and 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene, 14, used in the synthesis of 13 and 15 respectively, were both obtained commercially, while 1,3,5-trichloro-2,4,6-tricyanobenzene, 16, used in the synthesis of 17, was prepared using a published procedure.17 In all cases the acetylene containing arm was present in excess. Thus with 6% loading each of Pd(PPh3)4 and CuI, relative to Ar–Br bonds, and Et3N as base, 3G1-2S-Ac, 13, was synthesized in 36% yield. Under the same conditions 4G1-2S-Ac, 15, was obtained in 3% yield while 3G1-2S-CN, 17, gave no product. Several modifications of the catalyst system were made in an attempt to produce 3G1-2S-CN, which was obtained in 30% yield when the catalyst loading was increased to 1 equiv. CuI and 0.3 equiv. Pd(PPh3)4.

Further reaction conditions were investigated in the hopes of decreasing the amount of palladium needed. In one such experiment the copper catalyst was omitted in the hopes of suppressing dimer formation,18 but under these conditions no product was observed. A more active palladium catalyst, formed in situ from 1 equiv. Pd2dba3 and 2 equiv. tBu3PHBF4,19 was also tested. At 5% each of this more active Pd catalyst and CuI loading no product was observed. When the loading was increased to 30% in Pd and 1 equiv. CuI, the yield of purified material, 28%, was comparable to the purified yield obtained with Pd(PPh3)4. Again, even at the higher Pd loading level, no product was observed in the absence of copper. Further attempts to optimize all three Sonogashira couplings of acetylated arm 4 to the various aromatic cores are underway.
The 3- and 4-arm aniline-terminated dendrimers, 19 and 20 respectively, were synthesized by coupling 11, after stannylation by deprotonation of 11 with t-BuLi and addition of tributyltinchloride, to either 1,3,5-tribromobenzene 12 or 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene 14 to give 3G1-2S-N, 19, in 81% overall yield and 4G1-2S-N, 20, in 62% overall yield, respectively (Scheme 4).

The structures and purity of the dendrimers were confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and micro-analysis. Electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry while photophysical properties were investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy, along with steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence. Thermal decomposition was followed by thermogravimetric analysis (see ESI‡).
Electrochemistry

Cyclic voltammetry can be seen in Fig. 1 and 2. Initially reductions were carried out in dry THF and oxidations in dry CH2Cl2, with these sweeps represented by the upper traces in each panel. Subsequently scans encompassing the first oxidation and reduction in a single solution were carried out in THF and are represented by the lower traces.

3G1-2S-Ac and 4G1-2S-Ac. 
For 3G1-2S-Ac one reversible oxidation wave is observed with E1/2 = 0.78 V. Further oxidation leads to decomposition of the material. Upon reduction, a reversible wave with E1/2 = −1.81 V is observed, which overlaps with further reduction waves. These values are close to those seen previously for 3G1-2S,13 which is oxidized with E1/2 = 0.74 V and reduced with E1/2 = −1.77 V. The acetylated material is more difficult both to oxidize and to reduce than the material without the acetylene spacers; the magnitudes of the E1/2 values are both 40 meV larger, possibly indicating decreased delocalization of both charges in the acetylated material.
In the case of 4G1-2S-Ac we find a reversible oxidation wave at E1/2 = 0.74 V and further oxidation waves at Eox = 1.03 and 1.22 V. Upon reduction, reversible waves are found at E1/2 = −1.27 and −1.51 V. Consistent with optical absorption spectroscopy (discussed below), which shows a significant increase in conjugation in 4G1-2S-Ac compared to the sterically crowded 4G1-2S, the reduction and oxidation potentials are significantly lower in the acetylated material. 4G1-2S has previously been found to have reversible oxidation and reduction at E1/2 = 0.84 and −1.68 V, respectively, indicating increased delocalization of charges in the acetylated material.


3G1-2S-CN. 
The cyano-containing material, 3G1-2S-CN, is expected to have a decreased bandgap with respect to 3G1-2S-Ac largely due to a lower lying LUMO, as would be expected by adding a strong electron withdrawing group to the pi-system. This is supported by the more than 1 V shift in the first reduction potential to E1/2 = −0.74 V. A second reduction is observed at E1/2 = −1.35 V.
Although the corresponding re-oxidations are seen in both of these waves, the areas of the peaks are much smaller than the areas of the original reduction waves, indicating partial decomposition upon reduction. This may be related to the apparent photo-instability (further discussed below), namely that population of the LUMO, either electrochemically or by photo-excitation, opens up a decomposition pathway.
Upon oxidation a wave at E1/2 = 0.80 V is observed followed by multiple overlapping waves. This initial oxidation is quite close to the initial oxidation of 3G1-2S-Ac, which occurs at E1/2 = 0.78 V, consistent with the HOMO being confined to the electron-rich thiophene dendron in both compounds. This observation is also consistent with a HOMO–LUMO transition with significant charge-transfer character, which is further supported by calculations (see below).


3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N. 
For 3G1-2S-N three, relatively clean, reversible oxidation waves are observed at E1/2 = 0.39, 0.65 and 0.97 V, a fourth wave may be present near 1.5 V. In the spectroscopic studies (discussed below) the three arms of this material appeared to be completely independent of each other, as well as of the phenyl core. It is possible then that these first three oxidation waves are sequential oxidations of the arms, made increasingly difficult due to columbic interactions. Upon sweeping to negative potentials 3G1-2S-N is observed to have an initial, reversible reduction wave at E1/2 = −1.73 V. Upon sweeping past −2 V a second wave is found at Eox = −2.05 V, although re-oxidation waves due to decomposition products are observed (Fig. 2a, upper trace).
4G1-2S-N is also observed to have multiple reversible oxidation waves, at E1/2 = 0.50, 0.70, 1.03 and 1.55 V. Again these may represent independent oxidations of the four arms of the dendrimer, which would be consistent with the apparent lack of communication between arms observed in optical absorption spectroscopy. Upon sweeping to negative potentials, reversible reductions are observed at E1/2 = −1.63 and −1.81 V. A further irreversible reduction is observed at −2.18 V. In solution, the optical bandgaps of 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N are nearly identical. As expected the electronic bandgaps of the two materials are also nearly identical. However, both the first oxidation and reduction of 4G1-2S-N are shifted by about 100 mV in the positive direction compared to 3G1-2S-N.

3G1-2S-Ac and 4G1-2S-Ac. 
As stated earlier the motivation for incorporation of the acetylene bridge between the phenyl core and the first thiophene ring in the dendrons of 3G1-2S and 4G1-2S was to relieve steric crowding around the core,11,13 particularly in the case of the 4-arm dendrimer, where steric interactions are thought to limit the conjugation length of the chromophore.13Fig. 5 shows the normalized optical absorption spectra of the acetylene-bridged dendrimers, as well as the absorption spectra of the 3G1-2S and 4G1-2S dendrimers for comparison. Fig. 6a and 6b shows the normalized photoluminescence spectra for 3G1-2S-Ac and 4G1-2S-Ac, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Normalized optical absorption spectra of acetylene-bridged, 13, 15 and 17, thiophene dendrimers in degassed tetrahydrofuran. The absorption spectra for 3G1-2S and 4G1-2S are shown for comparison. 
 Fig. 6  Normalized photoluminescence spectra (circles), corrected for the spectral response of the detection system, for (a) 3G1-2S-Ac 13 and (b) 4G1-2S-Ac 15 in degassed tetrahydrofuran—also shown are the fit and Franck–Condon (FC) envelope from the spectral fitting process, the results of which are summarized in Table 2. 
Inclusion of the acetylene group has a negligible effect on the size of the chromophore for the 3-arm dendrimer, since the 1,3,5-substitution pattern means that steric crowding is less of a problem.11,13 As a result both the absorption and emission spectra of the 3-arm acetylene-bridged dendrimer are almost identical, in shape and position, to those for the thiophene-only dendrimer, 3G1-2S.13 This confirms the observation of very similar oxidation and reduction potentials for the two dendrimers, discussed above. In contrast, the absorption spectrum of 4G1-2S-Ac is red-shifted by 80 meV compared to 4G1-2S, due to the reduced steric interaction between neighboring dendrons and the resultant increase in conjugation length, consistent with the electrochemistry results.
The photoluminescence spectra (Fig. 6) of the acetylene-bridged dendrimers exhibit an increased coupling to both low and high frequency vibrational modes resulting in less structure and an increased average Huang–Rhys parameter (Table 2),20,21 compared to the first-generation thiophene-bridge dendrimers. The increased vibronic coupling observed in the steady-state photoluminescence spectra can also be used to rationalize the reduction in photoluminescence quantum yield compared to the first generation thiophene dendrimers.13

The time-resolved fluorescence profiles for 3G1-2S-Ac and 4G1-2S-Ac are described by a bi-exponential decay (Fig. 4a), with average decay lifetimes, τavg, of 655 and 866 ps, respectively. However, it should be noted that the fluorescence decay of the 4-arm dendrimer is longer, due to an increased contribution from a 1 ns decay component (∼60% cf. ∼23%). The precise origin of the two decay components is the subject of a more comprehensive photophysical study.


3G1-2S-CN. 
While addition of the acetylene spacer between the thiophene arm and phenyl core of 3G1-2S, to give 3G1-2S-Ac, has little impact on the photophysics of the dendrimer, further functionalization of the core with three cyano groups significantly changes the absorption spectrum.
The introduction of electron withdrawing cyano groups results in two pronounced peaks, with the lowest energy peak significantly red-shifted by about 470 meV with respect to 3G1-2S-Ac. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD–DFT) calculations, performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory for one G1-2S thiophene arm attached to the cyano-substituted phenyl core through an acetylene group, yield transition density plots for electronic transitions between the occupied and unoccupied orbitals (Fig. 7). These calculations suggest that the peak at ∼400 nm is due to a π–π* transition within one thiophene arm and the core, with only limited transition density located on the terminal thiophene rings (Fig. 7a). Such a finding is consistent with the optical absorption for a linear, α-conjugated quarterthiophene.22 Although calculations predict a completely planar structure for 3G1-2S-CN,14 the meta substitution pattern of the arms means that the increased planarity does not result in a chromophore large enough to produce the magnitude of red-shift observed.13 Also, TD–DFT calculations predict that the lowest-energy absorption is due to an electronic transition with significant charge-transfer character (Fig. 7b), with a shift in electron density into the core consistent with the presence of electron-rich thiophene arms and an electron-poor cyano-substituted core. This is in good agreement with calculations for the whole dendrimer,14 as well as the electrochemical measurements, where a pronounced change of the reduction potential, corresponding to a low-lying LUMO, is observed.

Consistent with absorption into a low energy excited state, the emission of 3G1-2S-CN is significantly red-shifted with respect to 3G1-2S-Ac, suggesting that the emission originates from the intramolecular charge-transfer species. Since emission from charge-transfer states is often less efficient this is also consistent with the reduced photoluminescence quantum yield of 3G1-2S-CN (Table 1). It should be noted, however, that there is a shoulder on the high-energy side of the main emission band (Fig. 3a) and that the emission cannot be described using a spectral fitting routine based on a simple Huang–Rhys model. These observations imply that there may be emission from two distinct optical species, with the high energy emission originating from the species generated by absorption at ∼400 nm. In addition, prolonged illumination resulted in photodegradation of the 3G1-2S-CN sample, resulting in complete attenuation of the low energy absorption band. After degradation, which occurs both in oxygen exposed and degassed samples, the resulting absorption spectrum is almost identical to that obtained for 3G1-2S-Ac. Further studies are currently underway in order to elucidate the precise nature of this photodegradation process.
The cyano-substituted dendrimer also exhibits bi-exponential decay kinetics (Fig. 4a), with an average lifetime of 910 ps, although the theoretical calculations suggest that the nature of the emitting species is likely to be significantly different to the unsubstituted 3-arm dendrimer, 3G1-2S-Ac. In the case of 3G1-2S-CN the long-lived component contributes 41% to the overall decay, resulting in a significantly slower decay. Although the spectral features and bi-exponential decay function indicate that the emission may originate from two distinct optical species a more comprehensive photophysical study of the cyano-substituted dendrimer is underway to elucidate the precise origin of the emission.


3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N. 

Fig. 8 shows the normalized optical absorption spectra of the dibutylaniline-terminated dendrimers, as well as the absorption spectra of the 3G1-3S and 4G1-3S dendrimers for comparison. Fig. 9a and b shows the normalized photoluminescence spectra for 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N, respectively. The photophysical properties of the two aniline substituted dendrimers, 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N, are almost entirely identical: the shape and position of the absorption and emission spectra are similar, with only a slight red-shift (∼10 meV) observed for the 4-arm dendrimer. This is in stark contrast to the previously reported series of thiophene dendrimers where the red-shift upon adding an extra dendron is much larger (>80 meV), due to interaction between the arms located para to each other.13,14 A similar effect is observed in the cyclic voltammetry, where addition of the extra arm has only a small impact on the electrochemistry, and hints towards independent oxidations of the arms without communication through the core.

While the meta arrangement of the dendrons in 3G1-2S-N restricts the maximum possible size of the chromophore to a single arm and the phenyl core, it is not immediately obvious why this would be the case for 4G1-2S-N, where the 1,2,4,5-substitution pattern of the dendrons around the core should allow communication between arms located ortho or para to each other. However, ground-state geometry optimzation, performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, for 4G1- 2S-N suggests that there is a significant degree of twisting of the thiophene dendrons out of the plane of the phenyl core, dihedral angles ∼39 and 55°, that may limit conjugation of the thiophene arm to the phenyl core (see ESI for optimized geometries of 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N).‡
In fact, the absorption spectra of 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N are made up of three distinct features, which can be attributed to chromophoric units with various conjugation lengths (Fig. 8). TD–DFT calculations, performed on a single aniline-terminated dendron connected to the phenyl core, provide some insight into the nature of these chromophores. The higher energy shoulder at ∼350 nm lies close to λmax (333 nm) of the linked thiophene-dibutylaniline compound 7. Since the steric bulk of the thiophene-dibutylaniline terminal groups makes it unlikely that both the α- and β-linked branches can be coplanar with the rest of the arm, and β-linked moieties in thiophene materials are known to be more weakly conjugated than their α-linked counterparts,23 this unit is likely to be present as an independent chromophore in the β-linked position at the branch point in each arm, consistent with the TD–DFT calculations (Fig. 10a). The peak at ∼400 nm lies very close to the absorption maxima of α-quaterthiophene22 and 3G1-1S,11,13 suggesting that this peak is due to a conjugated segment containing four aromatic rings. Fig 10b suggests that this absorption band is due to an optical transition that forms an exciton localized on the phenyl core and first three thiophene rings, up to the branching point, of the dendron. The transition density plot for the lowest energy electronic transition corresponds to a chromophore with some intramolecular charge-transfer character (Fig. 10c), from the electron-donating aniline unit to the thiophene arm, with only marginal conjugation to the phenyl core, even in a more planar arrangement (dihedral angle ∼25°) than is found for 4G1-2S-N. This provides a good indication as to why the optical bandgaps of the 3- and 4-arm dendrimers are almost identical, since the fully delocalized excitons have sufficient space on an individual arm.

While the influence of the electron-rich aniline groups on the absorption onset is small, their significantly broader absorption spectrum and higher molar decadic extinction coefficients suggest that they are better candidates as the light-harvesting material in organic photovoltaic devices than the previously reported dendrimers containing only thiophene in the arms.
The Stokes shift between the absorption onset and electronic origin of emission, which is defined as the energy of the transition between the lowest vibrational levels of the excited state and ground state, is much larger (190 meV) in aniline dendrimers than in the dendrimers with thiophene-only dendrons (<90 meV),13 implying significant geometrical rearrangement between the “hot” exciton, formed upon photon absorption, and “cold”, or relaxed, exciton.14 In fact, the electronic origin of emission of both dendrimers is actually red-shifted by ∼300 meV compared to 3G1-3S,13 suggesting that the relaxed exciton is significantly different to that observed for 3G1-3S, consistent with emission from an exciton with significant charge-transfer character.
The time-resolved fluorescence profiles for both 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N are described by a bi-exponential decay (Fig. 4b), with average decay lifetimes, τavg, of 509 and 597 ps, respectively. However, only a very small contribution (∼1%) of a long-lived decay component is required to obtain a satisfactory fit to the fluorescence decay.

Conclusions
We present the convergent synthesis of target dendrimers in moderate to high yields. We show that use of acetylene bridges between the core and the thiophene dendrons alleviates steric crowding in the 4-arm dendrimer with a corresponding red-shift of the absorption onset and emission energy. In the case of the 3-arm dendrimer steric crowding is less prevalent and as a result the insertion of the acetylene unit has little impact on the spectroscopic properties. Substitution of the phenyl core with an electron-poor tricyanobenzene core is shown to lower the LUMO level of the dendrimer with a corresponding substantial (470 meV) red-shift of the absorption onset, attributed to intramolecular charge-transfer, compared to a dendrimer with an unsubstituted phenyl core. Photoluminescence measurements indicate that emission originates from two distinct chromophores, corresponding to the basic thiophene dendron and the intramolecular charge-transfer species. Inclusion of aniline groups at the end of the dendrons produces structures that show little or no communication between dendrons through the core, independent of the substitution pattern around the central phenyl ring, thus limiting the conjugation length even in the 4-arm dendrimer. The lowest-energy optical transition is again attributed to intramolecular charge-transfer, albeit localized to the aniline-terminated dendron. These dendrimers do, however, show a higher absorptivity in the high-energy region of the visible spectrum where the acetylene-bridge and all-thiophene dendrimers show poor absorption. A large Stokes shift between the absorption and emission of the aniline-terminated dendrimers suggests significant geometrical rearrangement between the “hot” and “cold” excitons, and points to emission from an exciton with significant charge-transfer character. Investigations into the effect of these phenomena on organic solar cell behavior are underway.
Experimental
General

lH and l3C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian unity INOVA AS400 spectrometer and are reported in ppm relative to residual protonated solvent. Elemental analysis was performed by Huffman Laboratories, Golden, CO. Melting points were recorded on a TA instruments DSC 2910 differential scanning calorimeter (10 °C/min) and were taken as the onset to the melting point transition. MALDI spectra were recorded using an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR time-of-flight instrument and ESI spectra were recorded using an Applied Biosystems QSTAR-Pulsar, both at the University of Colorado Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. All MALDI samples were run using dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) as the matrix with chloroform as the solvent in a dried-droplet preparation method. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed under argon using an electrochemical cell driven by a PINE instruments company biopotentiostat model AFCBP1. A platinum working electrode, platinum coil counter electrode and a silver wire quasi reference electrode was utilized with a scan rate of 100 mV sec−1. Decamethylferrocene24 was used as the internal reference for DCM solutions and ferrocene25 was used in THF solutions and the potentials corrected vs.SCE.26
All optical absorption spectra were taken as solutions in THF using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog 3 fluorescence spectrometer with a cooled CCD detector. All spectra were corrected for the response of the detection system. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined relative to a perylene dye (BASF Lumogen yellow 083) in degassed dichloromethane and Rhodamine 110 in degassed ethanol, which have quantum yields of ∼95% and ∼92%, respectively. Fluorescence decays were recorded using time-correlated single-photon counting, with pulsed diode laser excitation at 438 nm (Jobin Yvon IBH). Emission was monitored perpendicular to excitation through a 0.25 m monochromator and detected using a cooled photon counting photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu H6279), which gave a response function of 225 ps. Data were analysed using an established non-linear least squares iterative reconvolution procedure.27 The finite width of the instrument response function was effectively deconvoluted from the measured data to give an overall temporal response of ∼20 ps. Data were fit to either a sum of one or two exponentials and the quality of fit judged using stringent statistical procedures.27

Spectra fitting routine
The emission spectra of the dendrimers were modeled following a method similar to that employed to calculate the optical spectra of oligophenylenevinylenes.28 This approach assumes an approximation of displaced, but undistorted, harmonic oscillators (i.e. the vibrational frequency of the ground and excited states is identical). Within this approximation the electron–phonon coupling constant, or Huang–Rhys parameter (S),21 is related to the projected geometry change between the ground and excited states, ΔQk: (1)where c is the velocity of light, h is Planck's constant, and υk is the considered vibrational mode. Since many vibrational modes couple to the electronic transition the value of υk obtained from the spectral fit is an ‘average’, although it often corresponds to the frequency of a dominant vibrational mode. The Franck–Condon (FC) factors, F0,k, which are a measure of the overlap between the wavefunctions of the 0th vibrational level of the initial (excited) state and the kth vibrational level of the final (ground) state, are then calculated using: (2)
The individual spectral lines are subsequently broadened by a normalized Voigt function, IV(υ), which is calculated using an algorithm formalized by Humlicek29 and discussed in greater detail by Schreier.30 The Voigt function is chosen because the optical transitions of organic chromophores can be homogeneously and inhomogeneously broadened, resulting in the peak profile being a convolution of Lorentzian, IL(υ), and Gaussian, IG(υ), lineshapes. The final modeled spectrum, I(υ), is given by the sum of the individual Voigt peaks representing the vibronic progression, such that the amplitude of vibronic peak k is Atot.F0,k: (3)
The lineshape of the Voigt function is governed by parameters affecting the position (Eem0,k = Eem0,0 − kυk: where Eem0,0 is the electronic origin), width (γV) and shape (σV), a weighting factor that determines the contribution from the Gaussian and Lorentzian components. Non-linear, least-squares optimization (Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm) is used to minimize chi-squared,31 by comparison of the modeled and measured spectra. Finally, it should be noted that the fitting process indicates that the individual peaks were predominantly Gaussian in shape for all of the dendrimers in this study, indicating that inhomogeneous effects dominate the spectral broadening.
Computational methods
To simulate the optical absorption transitions, calculations were performed on a single dendron attached to the central phenyl core for both the cyano-substituted and aniline-terminated dendrimers.
Such an approach is justified, in the case of the 3-arm dendrimers, because of the meta arrangement of the dendrons around the central phenyl core. However, despite the 1,2,4,5-arrangement of the arms around the phenyl core, the significant twisting observed between the arms of 4G1-2S-N and the phenyl ring limits delocalisation of the chromophore to and through the core (see ESI for optimized geometries of 3G1-2S-N and 4G1-2S-N).† In addition, calculations performed on a single dendron attached to the central phenyl core are sufficient to predict the photophysical properties of these dendrimers.
Ground state optimizations were performed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method as implemented in the Gaussian03 package.32 Excited state calculations were obtained using time-dependent density functional theory (TD–DFT) and were also performed at the same level of theory and basis set. Three-dimensional transition density (TD) plots were generated for the electronic transitions taken from TD–DFT calculations according to: (4)where φo and φu represent the occupied and unoccupied orbitals, respectively, and Cµou are the configuration interaction (CI) expansion coefficients of the electronic transition. The transition densities show the spatial location of the optical excitation and also provide information about the electronic transition dipole moment.
