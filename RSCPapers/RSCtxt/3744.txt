    , Accepted 28th April 2017First published on 28th April 2017AbstractThe relationships between the photophysics and structural properties of 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as a function of solvent polarity are investigated both experimentally and by computational methods. Stationary fluorescence measurements are consistent with a model envisaging the presence of three types of conformers in equilibrium in the ground state. They are characterized by different relative orientations of the thiophene rings. Due to a low rotational barrier, the sample in solution is characterized by a distribution of relative internal orientations. By applying the Kawski method, we evaluate the average dipole moment of ground and excited states of the three types of conformers. The ground state dipole moments are small and similar for the three types of conformers. On the contrary, dipole moments differ substantially in the excited state. X-ray diffraction of a single crystal confirms the presence of an orientational disorder of thiophene rings. Transient absorption UV-visible spectroscopy experiments allows the identification of the main mechanisms responsible for the large Stokes shift observed in this push–pull molecule. Time dependent spectra provide a picture of the relaxation processes occurring after excitation: the primary step is an internal charge transfer assisted by thiophene ring planarization which occurs on a time scale ranging from 0.88 to 1.3 picoseconds depending on solvent polarity. Moreover, time-resolved fluorescence measurements are consistent with a mechanism involving planarization accompanied by a stabilization of the charge transfer state as observed in polar solvents. In the latter, longer fluorescence lifetimes are observed along with a quantum yield decrease due to the activation of specific non-radiative relaxation channels. The photophysical behavior of 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole in a solid matrix of polymethyl methacrylate is similar to that observed in solution, but the overall non-radiative process rate is slow with respect to that in the liquid phase. As a consequence, the radiative processes are enhanced giving rise to a fluorescence quantum yield of 90%. Such behavior is consistent with the proposed relaxation model.
Introduction
Organic molecules with a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) framework1,2 with delocalized electrons are widely employed for application in materials science. These push–pull3 molecules undergo a fast intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) upon light excitation. The initially excited state relaxes to a state characterized by a slightly different conformation entailing a charge transfer process.
The ICT state can be twisted (TICT)4,5 when there is rotation of chemical groups or planar (PICT)6 when there is molecule planarization. Photoinduced charge separation represents one of the main properties of these molecules making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
The fields in which such molecules have been utilized span from optoelectronics7 to photovoltaics.8 In particular, many devices have been successfully created using these organic molecules as building blocks. Light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),9,10 organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs),11,12 dye-sensitizing solar cells (DSSCs)13,14 and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs)15,16 are some of the potential applications.
In this paper, we will report a complete photophysical study on 4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTB) (Fig. 1). DTB is a conjugated molecule characterized by a D–A–D framework in which an electron-poor benzothiadiazole core is connected to two electron-rich thiophene rings. The accurate photophysical characterization of DTB represents the first step for the creation of a series of derivatives with optimized photophysical properties. The specific addition of functional groups around the DTB core will be fundamental to enhance and optimize photophysical parameters (molar absorption coefficient, quantum yield, lifetime) and to tune the maximum emission wavelength as a function of the specific application.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of one of the conformers of DTB. 
DTB is characterized by a high molar extinction coefficient (1 × 10−4 M−1 cm−1), high photoluminescence quantum yield (ranging from 0.68 to 0.9) and very large Stokes shift (more than 4500 cm−1) in a number of organic solvents, including a PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) solid matrix. The exceptionally large Stokes shift results in a small overlap between the absorption and emission spectra, also at high concentrations. Therefore, DTB is characterized by a much longer light attenuation path length compared to common scintillators.17
In order to evaluate the structural properties of DTB ground and excited states and to evaluate the solvent effects, ab initio DFT calculations have been performed to complete those already published.18 The calculated data provide an indication that the excited state is more planar than the ground state. UV-visible transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) allows evaluating the contribution of the molecular conformational changes and solvent reorganization dynamics to the Stokes shift.
Experimental
Sample synthesis and preparation
The synthesis of DTB has been performed as reported in ref. 19.
For the preparation of DTB in PMMA, a solution of DTB in dichloromethane with a concentration of 10−3 M was stirred for 30 minutes, then 2 g of PMMA beads were dissolved in the latter solution and stirred for 4 hours. The PMMA solution was drop-casted onto a microscope slide inside an oversaturated chamber. The thickness of the films produced for our measurements ranged from 0.2 to 2 mm with a final DTB concentration of 100 ppm.
Stationary spectroscopy measurements
UV-visible absorption spectra have been measured on a Lambda 950 Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer, using 1 cm path length absorption cells. The fluorescence emission spectra have been collected on a Perkin Elmer LS55 spectrofluorimeter by exciting the samples at 400 nm and using 1 cm path length cells. The samples in the latter case have been prepared by absorbance at an excitation wavelength of the order of 0.01. Relative quantum yields have been obtained comparing the fluorescence spectra of samples with that of the standard Coumarin 153 (ϕf = 0.54612).20 For DTB in PMMA, absolute fluorescence quantum yield measurements using an integrating sphere have been performed.
Absolute ϕf values were obtained using an Horiba Fluorolog®-3 setup. The device is equipped with an integrating sphere (Labsphere®, diameter of 100 mm) with a coating in optical Spectralon® which provides a reflectance >99% over the 400–1500 nm range (>95% within the 250–2500 nm range). The Teflon sample holder has been tilted 30° left with respect to the excitation beam to avoid the loss of the incident radiation. Because of the high intensity of the excitation profiles, the spectra have been recorded using a Gauze neutral density filter with 2.8% transmittance in the 600–950 nm range, positioned at the output port of the sphere, in order to reduce the light intensity without changing the spectral profiles. The detection system is composed of a Synapse CCD camera working in the range between 360 and 941 nm with a holographic grating optimized at 650 nm. The fluorescence spectra have been corrected for the instrumental response. The fluorescence absolute quantum yields were calculated on the basis of de Mello's method21 following the procedure previously described.22
Transient absorption measurements
The apparatus used for the transient absorption measurements has been described in detail in previous works.23–25
The femtosecond laser oscillator is a Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra Physics Tsunami). The short (≤70 fs) pulses were stretched and amplified at 1 kHz repetition rate by a regenerative amplifier (BMI Alpha 1000). After compression, a total average power of 450–500 mW and pulse duration of 100 fs were obtained. The repetition rate of the output beam was reduced to 100 Hz by a mechanical chopper in order to avoid the photodegradation of the samples. The pump pulses at 400 nm were generated by frequency doubling the fundamental 800 nm radiation and its polarization was set to the magic angle with respect to the probe beam by means of λ/2. The white continuum probe pulses were generated by focusing a small portion of the 800 nm radiation on a 3 mm thick CaF2 window and optimized in the 350–750 nm spectral range. The delay time between the pump and probe pulses was controlled by a moveable delay line in a time scale up to 2.0 ns. For the multichannel detection of transient absorption signals, the white light continuum after passing through the sample was sent to a flat field monochromator which is coupled to a home-made CCD detector (http://lens.unifi.it/ew).
The spectra (ΔOD/λ) consist of positive and negative bands. The former are due to excited state absorption (ESA), while the latter are due to ground state bleaching (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE).26 The samples of DTB dissolved in different solvents have been kept in quartz cells (2 mm path length) and under magnetic stirring. The sample of DTB in PMMA (2 mm thickness) has been mounted on a home-built scanner and moved to change the region excited by pump pulses. The integrity of each sample has been checked by visible absorption measurements (Perkin Elmer LAMBDA 950) and microscope inspection before and after the time-resolved measurements. All the sample solutions were prepared so that the absorbance at the excitation wavelength was about 0.5 in all the examined solvents (cyclohexane, acetonitrile and DMSO). The absorbance of DTB in PMMA at 400 nm, as well of the other liquid samples, was about 0.5.

Time-resolved fluorescence measurements. 
Fluorescence lifetimes of liquid DTB samples have been measured using ultrashort laser pulses (duration of ≈300 fs at 1 kHz repetition rate, ≈1 μJ energy) obtained from the same instrumentation used for TAS experiments. After excitation of the samples with 400 nm pulses, the fluorescence has been collected through a quartz lens and focused onto a photocathode of a microchannel plate photomultiplier. Incident scattered light is eliminated by an appropriate set of colored filters. The photomultiplier signal is fed into a digital oscilloscope, 1.7 GHz band-pass, grounded through a 50 Ω resistor. The slightly asymmetric instrumental function, measured by light scattering from a latex solution, had a time duration (FWHM) of 550 ps and is highly reproducible from one experiment to another. The experimental time profiles have been then deconvoluted taking into account the experimental instrumental function and fitted to single exponentials. The kinetic traces show the presence of electronic noise which can be observed also in the instrumental function profile, but this noise does not affect the analysis of the data.
Fluorescence lifetime measurements for DTB in PMMA have been performed by exciting the solid sample with a pulsed source (NanoLED, Horiba) at 455 nm. The 650 nm emission has been collected with the front face tilted by 30° with respect to the excitation beam. The signal was monitored using a TBX-04 photomultiplier tube module (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Fluorescence lifetime measurements have been averaged over three independent determinations.

Data analysis

Solvatochromism. 
The absorption and fluorescence spectra of DTB in solvents of different polarities have been analyzed using the theory of solvatochromism, based on a dielectric continuum description of the solvent and the classical Onsager cavity model. In order to obtain the ground and excited state dipole moments (μg and μe), the model proposed by Kawski has been applied.27
We have consider DTB as a prolate molecule, i.e. an ellipsoids of revolution in which b = c = a/p with the symmetry axis a longer than b (a > b). For a prolate shape, A = 0.174 according to ref. 28 and in the present case, p = 2.
The choice of Onsager cavity radius (a) value is critical and several methods are reported in the literature.29–31 In this paper, it has been extracted from the crystallographic data. The value is 4.25 Å.
Assuming that the molecular symmetry remains the same during the electronic transition and the ground and excited state dipole moments are parallel, the equations which allow the calculation of μe and μg are as follows:28 (1) (2) The values of m1 and m2 can be obtained from the fit of (A − B) and (A + B) plotted as a function of gBK(n) and fBK(ε,n) defined as:28 (3) (4)


Transient absorption spectra. 
The transient spectra have been analyzed by applying a combined approach, consisting of singular value decomposition (SVD)32–35 and the simultaneous fitting of all the collected kinetic traces (global analysis). The aim of global analysis is to decompose the two-way data matrix into time-independent spectra and wavelength independent kinetics.36 Once the number of components is identified through the SVD, the second step involves the parameterization of the time evolution of the spectral components. This was accomplished by assuming first-order kinetics, describing the overall temporal evolution as the sum or combination of exponential functions. In this regard, during the global analysis procedure, we have fixed the nanosecond kinetic components considering the fluorescence lifetimes obtained by time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Global analysis was performed using the GLOTARAN package (http://glotaran.org),36 and employing a linear unidirectional “sequential” model.



Ab initio calculations. 
In order to characterize the electronic structure of DTB, ab initio calculations at the DFT (density function theory) and TD-DFT (time-dependent DFT) levels have been applied. Calculations have been performed using TURBOMOLE version 6.2 software.38 In all the analyzed cases, the convergence criterion for the self-consistent field method (SCF) has been fixed at 10−8 atomic unit (a.u.) and all the geometrical optimizations have been performed assuming that the maximum Cartesian gradient norm of the energy was smaller than 10−5 a.u. In both DFT and TD-DFT methods, the exchange and hybrid correlation functional B3-LYP has been applied together with the def2-TZVP basis set. The solvent dependent effects have been simulated using the COnductor-like Screening MOdel (COSMO).39 In this model, the solvent is considered as a continuous dielectric medium with permittivity ε in which the molecule gives rise to a cavity on the basis of the van der Waals forces. To simplify the analysis, the total electrostatic potential Φtot within the solvent has been imposed to be null.

Results and discussion
Stationary spectroscopy and solvatochromism
The UV-visible absorption spectra of DTB dissolved in acetonitrile (AcN) and cyclohexane (c-hex) are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum of DTB in AcN is characterized by the presence of a symmetric non-structured band with a maximum at 440 nm, a band at 306 nm with a shoulder at 325 nm and another band at 255 nm.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of DTB in AcN (black line) and c-hex (red line). The 440 nm peak undergoes a red shift of 6 nm in c-hex. 
We observe a difference between the spectra of DTB in AcN and c-hex in the maximum of the longer wavelength transition band which results in a red shift of 6 nm in the latter solvent.
As highlighted in a previous work,18 solvent polarity affects more greatly the position of the emission spectra maximum.
In Fig. 3, the normalized emission spectra of DTB in solvents of different polarities, obtained by exciting the samples at 400 nm, are presented. The emission spectra of DTB in non-polar solvents, c-hex and CCl4, are characterized by a narrower band with respect to polar solvents. DTB spectra in polar AcN and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) are instead characterized by a broad band with a tail extending up to 750 nm.
 Fig. 3  Normalized emission spectra of DTB in solvents of different polarities (λecc = 400 nm). 
In all cases, emission spectra are characterized by large Stokes shifts (5869 cm−1 in AcN and 4123 cm−1 in c-hex) increasing with solvent polarity.
With the aim of changing the polarity gradually, we have also collected the DTB spectra in AcN:benzene binary mixtures (from 0 to 1 of AcN). By increasing the quantity of AcN, we observed that the intensity of the initial emission spectrum decreases and new red-shifted features appear. We have also observed the presence of an isosbestic point at 587 nm which indicates the existence of an equilibrium between the two emitting species in solution (Fig. 4). A deeper inspection of the emission spectra of DTB (Fig. 3) in solvents of different polarities shows the presence of three spectral features.
 Fig. 4  Emission spectra of DTB in AcN/benzene binary mixtures. The intensity values have been reported as photonic irradiance and normalized for the absorbance of the respective solutions. 
From ab initio calculations (see next sections), we have identified three representative ground state conformers for DTB characterized by different orientations of the thiophene rings with respect to the benzothiadiazole core (see Fig. 5). These three structures are representative of three main families. In DTB, conformers are not planar (see the next sections and ESI†).
 Fig. 5  Scheme of the three representative ground state conformers of DTB. 
As a matter of fact, the results of molecular dynamics simulations reported in ref. 18 indicate the existence of at least 21 conformations which can be grouped into three main families. These conformers are characterized by different orientations of the thiophene ring planes: there is a majority of non-planar conformers. X-ray data are consistent with the presence of the three conformers in the crystal.
Considering the presence of a structure distribution, Gaussian deconvolution represents a suitable method to distinguish the contribution of a particular conformer family to the fluorescence spectrum. Through the fitting procedure of the emission spectra, we have found that three different Gaussian curves are needed. We ascribe these three spectral features to the emission of the above mentioned conformer families (all the fittings and the fitting procedure are reported in the ESI†).
The fluorescence spectra peak deconvolution of DTB in organic solvents and in AcN:benzene mixtures with Gaussian functions has allowed us to distinguish the peak emission of the three conformers, A, B, and C (see Table 1 and Fig. S1A, B, ESI†). In conformer A, the thiophene sulphur atoms are both inversely oriented with respect to the thiadiazole ring. Conformer B instead shows the thiophene sulphur atoms in the trans position with respect to the thiadiazole ring, while in conformer C the latter atoms are inversely oriented with respect to the benzothiadiazole core.

The spectroscopic data have been used to calculate the dipole moments of ground and excited states (μg and μe) of the three types of conformers. In Fig. S2 (ESI†), we report the plots of the Stokes shift and the sum of absorption and emission maxima (in cm−1) as a function of the solvent polarity scale27 for DTB conformers dissolved in different solvents and AcN:benzene binary mixtures. Through the linear fit of these data, we have obtained parameters m1 and m2 which allow the estimation of μg and μe by applying eqn (1) and (2). Their values (showed in Table 2) have been obtained considering DTB a prolate molecule and using the experimental value of Onsager radius of 4.25 Å.

For all the conformers, the value of μe is larger than that of μg and has an opposite sign. Furthermore, we observe that there is not a significant difference between the ground state dipole moment values. Therefore, there should not be a specific solvent stabilization of any of the three structures in the ground state. In contrast, we expect a large solvent effect in the excited state.
Conformer C has the highest value of μe. In its excited state, it is the most polar and we expect it to be more abundant in polar solvents where it is better stabilized through solvation. From the previous observation, we assert that DTB undergoes conformational changes in the excited state depending on the solvent polarity. Therefore, additional non-radiative processes, due to the internal rotation of the thiophene rings, are promoted in DTB dissolved in polar solvents. Finally, we infer thatD'Alessandro et al.18 had reported that DTB has larger values of the dipole moment in the excited state, as we experimentally observed. The experimental ground state dipole moments are generally smaller than the calculated ones, while excited states dipole moment values are in good agreement with the calculated ones.
Time-resolved fluorescence
DTB fluorescence decay profiles in the analyzed solvents have been obtained with excitation at 400 nm.
The signal decay is mono-exponential in all cases (see Fig. 6) with the lifetime of the excited state which increases with solvent polarity (see Table 3). A lifetime of 10.8 ns has been observed in c-hex as against 16.2 ns in AcN. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φfluo) for DTB in the analyzed solvents have also been estimated and are reported in Table 3.

Starting from Φfluo values, it is possible to calculate the radiative and non-radiative constants (Kr, Knr): (5)where Kr and Knr are the rate constants of spontaneous emission and non-radiative relaxation processes, respectively. The sum of the rates of all the processes depopulating the S1 state, i.e. Knr + Kr, represents the excited state decay rate: Φfluo = Kr·τobs(6)where . Considering eqn (5) and (6) and the lifetime values, we derived Kr and Knr, whose values are also reported in Table 3. The Kr values decrease monotonically as the solvent polarity increases, as well as the Φfluo values. Consistent with the interpretation of the static spectral features reported in the previous paragraph, in non-polar solvents the highest values of Φfluo and Kr have been observed. In contrast, the highest values of Knr have been observed for the two polar solvents, AcN and DMSO, where conformer C is expected to be the most abundant in the excited state.
Transient absorption spectroscopy

Transient spectra in solvents of different polarities. 
Transient absorption measurements have been carried out on DTB dissolved in c-hex, AcN and DMSO. We observe that the position and evolution (dynamical Stokes shift); of the stimulated emission features (between 550 and 600 nm) change with the solvent polarity. Consequently, we estimate the conformational changes leading to the reorganization/rotation of the thiophene moieties as a function of the solvent. TA spectra have been registered by exciting the samples with 400 nm pump pulses and recording the signal in the range between 400 and 750 nm, up to 2 ns. In Fig. 7, the time-resolved spectra of DTB dissolved in AcN along with the UV-visible and emission spectra are reported. The transient spectra are characterized by the presence of partially overlapping signals: GSB around 450 nm, ESA around 510 nm and 690 nm and SE at ∼570 nm. As can be noticed from Fig. 7, the position of the maximum of the GSB signal corresponds to that of the UV-visible absorption spectrum, while the maximum of the SE signal is red-shifted with respect to the static emission spectrum. We ascribe this as a consequence of the presence of the two adjacent ESA signals. Therefore, the observation of a dynamical Stokes shift is limited by the dynamics of the ESA signals.

Because the spectral evolution is complex in all the three analyzed solvents and because the signals derived from different transitions are partially overlapped, we found it suitable to analyze time-resolved data using a global analysis approach employing the GLOTARAN package.36,37 The ns component, obtained by time-resolved fluorescence measurements, is the only parameter kept fixed during the global analysis procedure. The results in terms of the evolution associated decay spectra (EADS) obtained for DTB dissolved in AcN, DMSO and c-hex are reported in Fig. 8, while the entire set of spectra are reported in Fig. S3 (ESI†).

The relative time constants are reported in the inset. The time constants refer to the decay of the associated spectral components. 
As can be noticed inspecting the EADS in Fig. 8, the ESA signal at 525 nm for DTB in c-hex is initially characterized by a single band which evolves into two bands with a time constant of 15 ps. This behavior is not observed in the two polar solvents where instead a time-dependent frequency shift of the SE signal has been observed. This latter is relevant especially in DMSO. For all the solvents, the ESA signal around 700 nm is very intense compared to the GSB signal. However, it is difficult to extract any additional piece of information concerning the ESA intensity because of the superposition of GSB signal with the ESA signal located around 500 nm.
As already pointed out, the dynamics of DTB in all the analyzed solvents is described by three time decay constants.
After excitation, an instantaneous local excited (LE) state40–42 is promoted which then evolves into a lower energy emissive ICT state with time constants ranging from 0.88 to 1.3 ps depending on the specific solvent. These short time constants are ascribable to the ICT process assisted by a change in relative orientations of the thiophene rings with respect to the benzothiadiazole core. The latter process induces an S1 energy stabilization explaining the large Stokes shift observed.
The second time constant, of the order of ∼10 ps, is very similar for all the analyzed solvents and is related to the relaxation of solvent molecules (solvation dynamics) and to the intramolecular vibrational relaxation which takes place on such a time scale.43,44
The longer ns time component is related to the ground state recovery. Fig. 9 summarizes the above described processes.

A similar mechanism has been already observed in p-dimethylamino benzonitrile (DMABM)45 where a rotational motion along the C–N bond gives rise to the final twisted charge transfer geometry that allowed the authors to explain the observed big Stokes shift. It has also been reported that these structural rearrangements are particularly promoted in polar solvents.46


Transient spectra of DTB in the PMMA matrix. 
In order to understand the photophysical behavior of DTB when embedded in a solid medium and to evaluate the possibility of using it in a luminescent solar concentrator, we have also performed its spectroscopic characterization in PMMA. Polymethyl methacrylate is a polymer characterized by optical transparency and a remarkable resistance to photo and thermal degradation. The absorption and emission spectra of DTB in PMMA are shown in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Absorption and emission (λecc = 400 nm) spectra of DTB in the PMMA matrix. 
The absorption maximum is located at 448 nm, while the emission is centered at 550 nm giving rise to a Stokes shift of 4140 cm−1, similar to that observed in c-hex. The peak deconvolution analysis using Gaussian functions has highlighted only the presence of two bands relative to conformers A and B (peaking at 543 and 588 nm). Furthermore, we observe a lifetime of 11.5 ns and a fluorescence quantum yield of 90%. In this sample, the quantum yield is higher with respect to those estimated for DTB in the other solvents, as can be noticed from Table 3. The higher value of fluorescence quantum yield must reflect a decrease in the non radiative decay rate (Knr). In fact, we have obtained values of 12.77 × 10−11 s−1 and 1.42 × 10−11 s−1 for Kr and Knr, respectively. The matrix rigidity promotes the efficiency of the radiative mechanisms with respect to the non-radiative pathways.47
The analysis of the EADS of DTB in PMMA (Fig. 11) shows that the relaxation dynamics is well described by three time constants of 2.6 ps, 13 ps and a longer one in the ns time regime. In the solid matrix, the shortest time (2.6 ps), associated with the molecule conformational change is slightly longer with respect to that in the liquid phase due to the rigidity of the molecule surroundings. Also in this case, the second time component can be ascribed to DTB vibrational cooling and the ns time constant to the excited state decay.

Ab initio calculations
With the aim of exploring the most probable molecular configurations of DTB, we have minimized the structure starting from various initial geometries. For the ground state, we identified three families characterized by different orientations of the thiophene rings (see Fig. 5). The atomic distances calculated for the conformers in vacuo and those obtained from crystallographic data (see ESI†) are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculated geometries obtained for the ground state highlight that the molecular structure is characterized by a wide electronic delocalization distributed on all the three rings. The double bond localization in DTB seems to be that represented in Fig. 1, where the CC distances are on average shorter by 0.03 Å. The calculations also highlight that the ground state optimized structures are not planar. In fact, angles γC1C2C7C10 and γC6C5C11C14 (see Fig. S4, ESI†) assume different values from 0 and 180 degrees. In conformers A and C, having C2 symmetry, the above mentioned angles assume very similar values of 165.73° and 167.67°, respectively, while for conformer B they assume a value of 7.05° (see Table S1, ESI†).
Partial occupancy for the sulfur atoms, along with C–C and C–S bond distances far from the ideal one, has been observed for thiophene rings in X-ray data. This justifies the discrepancy between some experimental and calculated interatomic distances reported in Table S1 (ESI†). The structural elucidation emphasizes that conformer B in the crystal prevails. The comparison between the dipole moments of the three conformers is very significant. Going from conformer A to conformer C, an increase of the excited state dipole moment is calculated, thus confirming the solvatochromism results. The ab initio calculations have been performed also including the solvent effect using the COSMO method.39 We have chosen two solvents having very different values of polarity, namely benzene and AcN. We have found molecular geometries very similar to those obtained in vacuo. The achievement of a conformational equilibrium in solution depends on the energetic torsional barrier height. For this reason, keeping the torsional angle γC1C2C7C10 fixed, we have performed various structural optimizations. We have estimated that the energetic barrier for the rotation of the thiophene rings of 180° is about 12 KJ mol−1, a value that allows the rotational conversion in solution at room temperature. Moreover, we have calculated the excitation vertical energies in vacuum and observed that the band located around 450 nm is characterized for all the three conformers by a single transition involving the HOMO and LUMO. With the purpose of clarifying the nature of this transition, according to DFT theory, we have considered Kohn and Sham orbitals.48 In Fig. 12, the representation of Kohn–Sham orbitals highlights how the HOMO is delocalized on all the three heterocycles, while the LUMO is essentially positioned on the 2,1,3-benzothiazole moiety. These findings along with those of ref. 12 have allowed us to attribute the 450 nm transition to an ICT state. Our results are in good agreement with other works, in which the benzothiadiazole group acted as a charge acceptor in photoconversion processes.49,50
 Fig. 12  Representation of DTB Kohn–Sham orbitals corresponding to the HOMO and LUMO. 
We have also analyzed the molecular structure optimized for the first excited state S1 (Table S2, ESI†). The DTB molecule assumes a planar conformation and the double bond character between C14C11, C12C13, C2C3, C4C5, C10C7 and C9C8 diminishes with a consequent increment of the bond length of 0.015, 0.011, 0.037, 0.037, 0.021, and 0.013 Å, respectively (see Fig. S4, ESI†). As a consequence of ICT, an increment of the double bond character between C3C4 and C2C7, with a consequent reduction of the bond lengths of 0.037 and 0.028 Å, respectively, has been indeed calculated. On the other hand, all the other bonds lengthen, in particular those relative to the SN bonds highlighting the partial antibonding character of the correspondent molecular orbital. Our results are in good agreement with a previous work,18 in which a theoretical-computational study has demonstrated that the S1 vertical state of DTB is characterized by a sharp ICT in which a charge of ≈0.25 atomic units is simultaneously transferred from each of the lateral rings to the central one. The ICT process is scarcely affected by DTB conformational dynamics and also by the solvent characteristics. These findings implies that the charge-transfer character of the S1 vertical transition is maintained in the relaxed S1 state which in turns is responsible for the emission of DTB. Starting from the S1 optimized structure and projecting it in the ground state using the TD-DFT method, we have found that the transition frequencies for all the three conformers are located around 660 nm which corresponds to a Stokes shift ≈4500 cm−1. Considering the results of ab initio calculations and the spectroscopic data, the initial hypothesis of an ICT as a reason for the large Stokes shift has been confirmed. In addition, we can assess that the structural conformational changes, which take place in a time scale around 1 ps, correspond to the thiophene ring planarization.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have studied the relationships between the spectroscopic, structural properties and the dynamics of DTB in solution and in the PMMA matrix. We have characterized the fluorescence spectra of DTB in solvents of different polarities. We observed large Stokes shifts and spectral broadening increasing with solvent polarity. Gaussian deconvolution of emission spectral features has highlighted the presence of three components, which we have attributed to different families of DTB conformers. The relative abundances of these conformers in the excited state change in solvents with different polarities entailing a rotation of the thiophene rings. Such a process determines the activation of non-radiative processes affecting the fluorescence quantum yield. DFT calculations have confirmed the presence of three types of conformers, which are characterized by different orientations of the thiophene rings. The analysis by the Kawski model allowed estimating the dipole moment of the ground and first excited states for the three types of conformers.
X-ray data confirmed the presence of rotational disorder in the thiophene rings in the crystal.
With the aim of clarifying the nature of the large Stokes shift observed and its relationship with structural dynamics, we have performed time-resolved fluorescence and femtosecond TA measurements. Three relaxation processes were identified and their rates were measured.
The main mechanism involved after the excitation process is an ICT accompanied by thiophene ring rotation.
The same experimental characterization has also been carried out for DTB in PMMA. We have observed similar photophysics. In addition, we observed that the radiative mechanisms are strongly promoted in the solid matrix with respect to the liquid phase. All these observations lead to the conclusion that ICT and planarization processes concur with the large Stokes shift. In addition in a solid matrix, such as PMMA, rigidity reduces non-radiative processes although a shortening of fluorescence relaxation time is observed.
The high value of ε, the structural rigidity in the S1 state (which diminishes the probability of non-radiative deactivation processes) and the big Stokes shift (which minimizes auto-absorption phenomena) are the key factors for the high Φfluo. DTB is therefore a good candidate for luminescent solar concentrators. In this regard, in recent papers,51,52 DTB has been tested in a new LSC prototype designed to be integrated in building envelopes. In this preliminary study, the authors have demonstrated a very good energy performance ratio in comparison with standard PV modules. This laid the foundation for the use of the LSC as an innovative building integrated component with a large dissemination potential. Moreover, the present study, shedding light on the photophysics of the DTB molecule, will help to design new DTB-based compounds with improved light harvesting and light emitting properties.
