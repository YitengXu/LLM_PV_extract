The phase transformation and oxygen evolution temperature of delithiated MnPO4 were characterized using in situ hot-stage X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry-mass spectroscopy (TGA-DSC-MS), transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX).

Broader context
Electrochemically active LiMnPO4 nanoplates at lithiated/delithiated state were subjected to thermal stability and phase transformation evaluations for safety as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Charged MnPO4 undergoes amorphization above 180 °C possibly due to the Jahn–Teller effect followed by reduction to Mn2P2O7 with oxygen evolution at 490 °C which coincides with MnPO4·H2O. Although the kinetics of the LiMnPO4 cathode needs improvement, LiMnPO4 can be a safer alternative to other high voltage cathodes when materials design is optimized.

1. Introduction
Recent demands for environmental sustainability have spurred great interest in electrochemical energy storage technology.1,2 Among the many electrochemical energy storage systems, Li-ion battery is currently the leading technology for electric vehicles and is increasingly attractive for stationary energy storage for renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar power.1–3 Consequently, particular interest is focused on different electrode chemistries for large scale batteries that can satisfy more stringent requirements in cost, stability, and most importantly, safety for successful market penetration.1–6
Among cathode materials, olivine structured LiMPO4 (M: Fe, Mn, Co and Ni) cathodes deliver a flat voltage, excellent cycling stability and low entropy change throughout the state of charge (SOC).5,7–14 This is a result of two-phase Li extraction/insertion from the unique ordered orthorhombic structure consisting of close-packed phosphate anions with corner and edge-sharing MO6 and LiO6 octahedrons.9,10,15–21 Among olivine cathodes, LiMnPO4 is a good alternative to LiFePO4 with similar specific capacity (170 mA h g−1) but higher voltage (4.1 V vs. Li+/Li) from the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple within the limitations of conventional organic electrolytes.6,22–24 Thus, recent works have been focused on enhancing the sluggish electrochemical kinetics of LiMnPO4 that may be attributable to several factors including low ionic and electronic conductivities,17,25 high surface energy barrier for Li diffusion,26 slow phase-boundary movement,21,27 small polaronic conduction of Jahn–Teller active Mn3+,19,21 and meta-stability of the delithiated phase.28–31 A clear understanding of these factors has not yet been established but gradual improvements in electrochemical efficiency of LiMnPO4 as a cathode are being reported.17,18,20,22,24,32–40 Another important criteria for successful implementation as a cathode material is safety. Thermal instability of various charged cathodes such as layered LixMO2 (M: Co, Ni, Mn, Al) or spinel LixMn2O4 release O2 at elevated temperatures leading to thermal runaway where the organic electrolyte can ignite, leading to fire and explosion.28,30,41–45 However, olivine-type LiMPO4 (M: Fe, Mn, Co and Ni) cathodes have been promoted as a safe alternative28,46,47 due to the strong P–O covalent bonds in the tetrahedral (PO4)3− anion that inhibit oxygen loss thereby enhancing safety for large scale Li-ion battery applications.30 Since FePO4 is reported to be stable up to 500–600 °C in air without losing oxygen, it is believed that the charged MnPO4 compound, would match the excellent thermal stability of FePO4.28,30,48 However, recent investigations have cast doubt on that assumption by demonstrating the possible decomposition of charged MnPO4 at 120–210 °C with evolution of O2 and heat while fully discharged LiMnPO4 remains stable up to 410 °C or higher.29,30 This is in stark contrast to FePO4. Evolution of O2 during decomposition at elevated temperatures can limit the use of LiMnPO4 as a cathode as it raises critical safety concerns.
In the present work, thermal stability with regards to phase transformation and oxygen evolution of electrochemically charged/discharged LixMnPO4 nanoplate cathodes has been analyzed using in situ hot-stage X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and mass spectroscopy (MS). The surface of the electrochemically cycled LixMnPO4 nanoplate electrodes have been characterized by ex situX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX). Additionally, thermal stability of the charged MnPO4 electrode has been compared with serrabrancaite MnPO4·H2O at elevated temperatures. The impact of structural stability on the safety of high voltage LiMnPO4 cathode is discussed.
2. Experimental

        LiMnPO4 nanoplates were synthesized by the solid state reaction in molten hydrocarbon approach following our previous publication.39 Alternatively, MnPO4·H2O was synthesized by precipitation route following our previous publication.22 Details of the approaches and material characterizations are described in our previous publications.22,39
Microstructures were analyzed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Nova 600) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2010). XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns were measured using CuKα radiation of 1.54 Å in a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI) equipped with a HTK 1200 atmosphere-controlled heating chamber (Anton Paar, Ashland, VA) and a Vantec-1 position sensitive X-ray detector (Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI). Samples were heated at 5 °C min−1 under an ultra high purity (UHP)-Ar atmosphere to various temperatures at which isothermal XRD patterns were measured from 10–70° 2θ at increments of 0.007° per temperature and a 320.8 s total count time per step. The degree of crystallinity was quantitatively estimated using the equation Xc = Ac/(Ac + Aa) (Xc: degree of crystallinity, Ac: crystallized area, Aa: amorphous area on the X-ray diffractogram). A smooth curve which connected peak baselines was computer-plotted on the diffractograms. The area above the smooth curve was taken as the crystalline portion, and the lower area between smooth curve and the linear background baseline was taken as the amorphous section. The respective diffraction peak area was integrated using PDXL software (Rigaku, The Woodlands, TX).
The thermal property and gas evolution of the samples were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (TGA/DSC STA 449, Jupiter Netzsch instrument) equipped with a mass spectrometry (MS) (Aelos QMS 403C) using a standard electron impact ionization detector. The samples were loaded in alumina crucibles with a 60 μm diameter perforated lid inside the glove box and transferred to the TGA-DSC-MS instrument and heated under UHP-Ar flow up to 650 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was performed with a Phi 5000 Versa Probe consisting of a monochromatic focused AlKα X-ray (1486.7 eV) source and a hemispherical analyzer. Wide scan data were collected using a pass energy of 117.4 eV followed by a high-resolution scan with a pass energy of 23.5 eV. The XPS spectra were referenced to an energy scale with binding energies for Cu 2p3/2 at 932.67 ± 0.05 eV and Au 4f at 84.0 ± 0.05 eV. Low-energy electrons at ∼1 eV, 40 μA, and low-energy Ar+ ions were used to minimize the surface charging. All the spectra were collected at normal emission to probe the near-surface elements in the electrodes.
For electrochemical charging/discharging, the LiMnPO4 paper electrode was prepared by ball milling with LiMnPO4 nanoplates and Ketjen black for 4 h in planetary mill (Retsch 100CM) at 400 rpm followed by further milling with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Aldrich) binder for 1 h. The milled LiMnPO4/C/PTFE composite powder was rolled into a paper electrode using isopropanol (anhydrous 99.5%, Aldrich) as a softener. The final active material, Ketjen black and PTFE binder weight ratio was 70:23:7 with active LiMnPO4 loading being 20–40 mg cm−2. The LiMnPO4 paper electrodes were electrochemically cycled in 2325 coin cells (National Research Council, Canada) using an Arbin Battery Tester (Model BT-2000, Arbin Instruments, College Station, TX) at room temperature. 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (2:1) (ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate) was used as an electrolyte with Li metal anode in a half-cell configuration. The Li-ion cells were tested between 4.4 V and 2.0 V vs. Li+/Li using constant current (CC)–constant voltage (CV) charging and discharging at C/50 based on the capacity of 150 mA h g−1. After four electrochemical cycles, LiMnPO4 paper electrodes were collected either at charged or discharged state from the coin cell and washed four times in DMC over a week period to remove electrolyte salts before being subjected to thermal stability and surface characterization.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of as-prepared LiMnPO4, ball milled LiMnPO4/C and LiMnPO4 paper electrode with PTFE binder. Rietveld refinement on the XRD pattern of the LiMnPO4 powder (ESI, Fig. S1†) shows lattice parameters of a = 10.441 Å, b = 6.101 Å, c = 4. 747 Å (Rp: 5.734, Rwp: 7.752, Rexp: 7.53) based on Pnma that match well with ideal olivine LiMnPO4 (JCPDS no. 33-0804, Pmnb (62), a = 6.106 Å, b = 10.45 Å, c = 4.749 Å). From FESEM and HRTEM observations, LiMnPO4 particles are nanoplate-like in shape with preferred growth direction in [010].39 The detailed synthesis and characterization of the LiMnPO4 nanoplate is described in our previous publication.39 No shifts in angles and relative peak intensities of the post-milled LiMnPO4/C XRD pattern indicate that the crystal structure of LiMnPO4 is retained during the milling process. Finally, variations in the relative peak intensities in the XRD pattern of the LiMnPO4 paper electrode confirm that the nanoplate-like texture is maintained even after milling. As a result of the (100) plane being aligned parallel to the paper electrode, the (100) related peaks have stronger intensity than those from randomly distributed (010) and (001) plane peaks. On the other hand, the lattice parameters of the as-prepared serrabrancaite MnPO4·H2O powder based on a monoclinic system (space group: C2/c) were calculated to be a = 6.934 Å, b = 7.477 Å, c = 7.378 Å, and β = 112.3° by Rietveld refinement. Unlike the olivine LiMnPO4 structure, there is no edge sharing between the MnO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra with hydrogen ions residing in a tunnel structure instead of lithium ions. The as-prepared MnPO4·H2O primary particles are nanoplate-like in shape but agglomerated into yarn-ball-like secondary particles. The detailed material characteristics can be obtained from our previous publication.22

The electrochemical voltage profile of the LiMnPO4 paper electrode is shown in Fig. 2 where the electrode was charged at constant current (CC)–constant voltage (CV) mode to 4.4 V and discharged at C/50 to 2.0 V vs. Li+/Li. The electrochemical charging enabled delithiation of LixMnPO4 up to ∼95% of the theoretical value but at a lower rate compared to conventionally coated electrodes due to higher loading of active material (20–40 mg cm−2). Nevertheless, the LiMnPO4 paper electrode is more suitable for thermal stability and surface characterization which is the main focus of our current study. Numerous charged/discharged LiMnPO4 paper electrodes were collected for thermal stability and surface characterization. For the thermal stability study, charged/discharged LiMnPO4 paper electrodes and MnPO4·H2O powders were subjected to in situ hot-stage XRD at 30 °C increments up to 534 °C in UHP-Ar atmosphere as shown in Fig. 3. The discharged LiMnPO4 paper electrode was stable up to 534 °C (ESI, Fig. S2†). On the other hand, significant changes in the XRD pattern of the charged MnPO4 electrode became apparent above 180 °C in agreement with previous reports but reduced to Mn2P2O7 (C/2m) above 470 °C similar to MnPO4·H2O shown in Fig. 3(b). For the charged MnPO4 electrode between 180 °C and 470 °C, some type of phase transformation has been observed. Prior to identifying the crystal structure, the stoichiometry of the unknown phase needs to be clarified since one of the most important safety concerns of delithiated MnPO4 is O2 evolution during reduction to Mn2P2O7 with 5.33 wt% decrease via the following reaction:29,30 (1)

However, the exact reduction temperature has not yet been clearly observed and reported. Evolution of O2 can induce thermal runaway and, in the worst case, explosion. Therefore, fully charged/discharged LiMnPO4 paper electrodes were subjected to TGA-DSC-MS characterization up to 630 °C under UHP-Ar atmosphere as shown in Fig. 4 and 5. The two sharp endothermic peaks at 343 °C and 582 °C for PTFE binder are due to melting and decomposition, respectively. The PTFE binder starts to decompose at 500 °C and is completely decomposed by 600 °C.49 For the as-prepared LiMnPO4 paper electrode, abrupt weight loss was observed between 510 and 550 °C due to decomposition of PTFE. For MnPO4·H2O powder, weight change occurred in two stages between 240–300 °C and 400–490 °C, corresponding to elimination of surface H2O (3.57 wt%) equivalent to ∼0.33 of H2O for the first loss followed by release of lattice H2O and O2 (12.19 wt%) due to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+, respectively. Total weight loss of 15.76 wt% including 5.06 wt% of O2 and 10.70 wt% of H2O are in good agreement with previous reports.50,51 On the other hand, the as-prepared LiMnPO4 powder was stable up to 630 °C without any noticeable weight change. Both electrochemically charged and discharged LiMnPO4 paper electrodes showed continuous weight loss up to 450 °C which is most likely from the decomposition of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formed during electrochemical cycling.52,53 Since the crystal structure of the discharged LiMnPO4 electrode was stable up to 630 °C, the weight loss is less likely from the decomposition of the active materials but from the decomposition of the SEI layers which has been reported for high voltage electrode materials.5,41,54–57 Additionally, a <10% weight increase in the LiMnPO4 electrode following electrochemical cycling suggests possible SEl layer formation above ∼4.0 V vs. Li+/Li.5,33,54–57 Irrespective of the process, similar SEI surface layers will be formed during chemical delithiation using NO2BF4 (LiMnPO4 + NO2BF4 → MnPO4 + LiBF4 + NO2) since NO2BF4 is a strong oxidizing agent with a high redox potential of 5.1 V from NO2+/NO2vs. Li+/Li.29,30 It is known that chemical species such as LiF, ROCO2Li, ROCO2M, ROLi, MCO3, Li2CO3, MF2 (M = transition metal) and polycarbonates can form thermally unstable SEI layers on high voltage cathodes.33,54,57,58 To confirm the presence of the SEI layer, XPS and EDAX analyses on the as-prepared and discharged LiMnPO4 electrodes were compared as shown in Fig. 6. No significant changes in O 1s (530.6 eV),36 P 2p (PO43−: 132.8 eV),33,36Mn 2p1/2 (Mn2+: 653 eV)59 and Mn 2p3/2 peaks (Mn2+: 641.1 eV with a satellite at 646.4 eV)33,59 were observed but changes in C 1s (ROLi: 286.4 eV)58 and F 1s peaks from LiF (685.2 eV)57,60 were observed other than that from C 1s (Ketjen black: 284 eV, C–F PTFE : 291.2 eV)60,61 and F 1s from PTFE (C–F: 688 eV, –(CF2–CF2)–n segments: 689.2 eV) after electrochemical cycling. A slight shift in the Mn 2p3/2 peak after cycling is due to the presence of Mn3+ since the initial coulombic efficiency was 87.5%.33 No significant LiPF6/LixPOyFz (686.5 eV) peak was observed indicating the electrodes were thoroughly washed with DMC. A significant increase in the F content was also confirmed by the EDAX measurement shown in ESI (Fig. S3†).

In the TGA profiles of the charged and the discharged LiMnPO4 electrodes, abrupt weight loss of the charged MnPO4 occurred closer to the reduction temperature of MnPO4·H2O accompanied by a sharp exothermic peak at 490 °C whereas abrupt weight loss of the discharged LiMnPO4 occurred close to the decomposition temperature of PTFE binder. Also, the final weight percent of charged MnPO4/discharged LiMnPO4 electrode at 630 °C was 90.8% (TGA weight difference of 5.6 wt%) which is close to the theoretical Mn2P2O7/LiMnPO4 weight percent of 90.5% when 23 wt% of Ketjen black was subtracted from both electrodes. From TGA results, it is evident that the O2 evolution from the charged MnPO4 electrode occurs at 490 °C since the weight difference between charged MnPO4 and discharged LiMnPO4 at 450 °C was only 0.4 wt% and a more evident weight change difference of 5.64 wt% at 600 °C was observed that matches closely to MnPO4 → 0.5Mn2P2O7 + 0.25 O2↑ (5.33 wt%). The slightly lower weight for the charged MnPO4 at 450 °C is due to delithiation. Excluding the weight of the SEI layer formed on both MnPO4/LiMnPO4 electrodes, the charged MnPO4 electrode would have ∼3% lower wt% compared to the discharged LiMnPO4 electrode.
To analyze the gas species evolved during the heat-treatment, the respective mass spectrometer profiles versus temperature are shown in Fig. 5. The MnPO4·H2O powder released surface H2O (m/z = 18) at 290 °C followed by a release of bulk H2O and O2 (m/z = 16, 32) at 470–490 °C during reduction to Mn2P2O7 consistent with previous TGA results. The as-prepared LiMnPO4 electrode did not release any O2 or H2O but a CO2 (m/z = 44) peak was observed near 550 °C as a result of fluorination by decomposed CFx products from the PTFE binder.49,62–64 PTFE is known to fluorinate oxides as decomposed CFx species react with oxides generating an exothermic reaction with CO2 evolution.49,62–64 Unlike the as-prepared LiMnPO4 electrode, both the charged and the discharged LiMnPO4 electrodes show initial CO2 release between 200 and 400 °C consistent with the weight changes observed in the TGA plot indicating that the continuous weight loss up to 450 °C is a result of the SEI layer decomposition. Such CO2 evolution is commonly observed in the oxidation product of the SEI layer and catalytic decomposition of carbonate based organic electrolytes.42,52,53 The second stage CO2 evolution from the charged MnPO4 electrode occurs at a lower temperature of 530 °C than that from the discharged LiMnPO4 at 550 °C. Additionally, the sharp exothermic reaction at 490 °C was only observed from the charged MnPO4 electrode. From the XRD results, Mn2P2O7 is known to form above 470 °C. Reduction of MnPO4·H2O is an endothermic reaction (Fig. 4) but the highly exothermic reaction in the charged MnPO4 electrode suggests that the released O2 induced oxidation of either carbon, SEI or the PTFE binder to create CO2 gas.51,65 If O2 was released at <210 °C, O2 related peaks would have been detected by mass spectroscopy since the temperature is too low for oxidation of carbon based materials. Based on the TGA-DSC-MS results, the stoichiometry of the charged MnPO4 is maintained up to 490 °C but continuous changes in crystal structure between 180 °C and 490 °C required further understanding. The XRD peaks got broader as the temperature is increased along with a decrease in crystallinity as shown in Fig. 7. The degree of crystallinity of the charged MnPO4 electrode started to decrease from 82% at 180 °C to 45% at 400 °C but increased back to 86% above 490 °C as MnPO4 got reduced to Mn2P2O7. For the discharged LiMnPO4 electrode and the MnPO4·H2O powder, the crystallinity was maintained above 87% even during the phase transition from MnPO4·H2O to Mn2P2O7 at 470 °C. Such amorphization of crystalline MnPO4 strongly suggests a possible second order phase transformation induced by Jahn–Teller distortion.19 On the contrary, MnPO4·H2O was reduced directly to Mn2P2O7 near 470 °C (Fig. 3(b)) without any structural changes in between. This is due to the fact that MnO6 octahedra in MnPO4·H2O are already highly distorted due to the Jahn–Teller effect (ESI, Fig. S4†) and share only the corners. The Jahn–Teller effect is often encountered in the MO6 octahedral environment of transition metals, especially when five 3d orbitals of a transitional metal atom are no longer degenerate, but split into a triplet (t2g) and a doublet (eg) as in Mn3+ ions. Two different (t2g)3(dz2) and (t2g)3d(x2 − y2) electronic configurations exist for the high-spin Mn3+ ion. The former configuration induces two long bonds along the z-axis and four short bonds in the xy-plane whereas the latter configuration induces two short bonds along the z-axis and four long bonds in the xy-plane around the Jahn–Teller distorted Mn3+ ions.19 The MnO6 octahedra in LiMnPO4, MnPO4 and MnPO4·H2O structures are shown in the ESI (Fig. S4†). The MnO6 octahedra in the MnPO4·H2O exhibit almost perfectly distorted (t2g)3(dz2) configurations compared to the charged MnPO4 electrode. Since the MnO6 in the MnPO4·H2O shares only the corners due to the presence of –OH bonds, distortion is much easier than in the MnPO4 structure where MnO6 octahedra also share edges. It is believed that the edge sharing MnO6 in the charged MnPO4 limits the Jahn–Teller effect making it more amorphous. Previously, chemically delithiated MnPO4 were reported to become amorphous when exposed to the electron beam during TEM observation.29 Such crystal structural change might be related to the Jahn–Teller distortion of the lattice induced by the electron beam. A similar phenomenon was observed in delithiated MnSiO4 at room temperature limiting the cycling performance of the Li2MnSiO4 as a cathode.66

Previous ab initio calculation on the equilibrium O2 partial pressure based on ligand field theory indicates that a greater proportion of Mn2+ phases are present relative to Mn3+ in the Li–Mn–P–O phase diagram, whereas the situation is reversed for the Li–Fe–P–O system.28,67 Therefore, the MnPO4 phase directly reduces to Mn2P2O7 with a Mn2+ oxidation state, compared to the FePO4 system where the relative stability of the Fe3+ oxidation state leads to the intermediate mixed valence Fe7(PO4)6, Fe3(P2O7)2 and Fe3(PO4)2 phases before full conversion into Fe2P2O7 resulting in a more gradual O2 release.28,67 The calculated reduction temperature of MnPO4 to Mn2P2O7 was ∼370 °C which is slightly lower than our observation possibly due to the existence of an amorphous MnPO4 phase.28 Therefore, based on our analyses, thermal stability and phase transformation of the delithiated MnPO4 can be summarized as follows: (2) (3)
The tradeoff between higher voltage and thermal stability of the charged cathode may not be absolute since higher voltage can result from either more stable lithiated phase, or less stable delithiated phase. However, trends in higher equilibrium O2 partial pressures in higher voltage materials can arise since the voltage of an electrode material depends on the energy differences between the delithiated and lithiated phases.
From our results, the inherent thermal stability of LiMnPO4 in the lithiated or delithiated state seems to be relatively safer than other >4.0 V cathodes and structural changes >180 °C can be utilized to cause thermal shutdown during thermal runaway. Therefore, LiMnPO4 can be considered a safer alternative to other high voltage cathodes.3,45,65,68 However, for LiMnPO4 to have decent electrochemical activity, nano-sizing is essential which creates high surface area for larger heat generation.21,36,69 Since heat evolution related to the LiMnPO4 cathode is not an intrinsic material property but extrinsic property, smart material design such as carbon coating can significantly reduce surface–electrolyte reactions as compared to Li(NiCoX)O2 (X: Mn or Al) compounds in terms of both onset temperatures and specific heat evolution.36 Consequently, for nanomaterial electrodes to be applied successfully as Li-ion battery electrodes without paying any penalty, smarter material design is necessary.
4. Conclusion

        Phase transformation and thermal stability of the charged MnPO4 cathode were studied for Li-ion batteries. The MnPO4 reduction to Mn2P2O7 with oxygen evolution is observed at 490 °C which coincides with MnPO4·H2O. Charged MnPO4 undergoes amorphization above 180 °C possibly due to the Jahn–Teller effect. Although the kinetics of the LiMnPO4 cathode needs improvement with lower amount of conductive carbon additives, LiMnPO4 can be a safer alternative to other high voltage cathodes when materials design is optimized.

Broader context
Electrochemically active LiMnPO4 nanoplates at lithiated/delithiated state were subjected to thermal stability and phase transformation evaluations for safety as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries. Charged MnPO4 undergoes amorphization above 180 °C possibly due to the Jahn–Teller effect followed by reduction to Mn2P2O7 with oxygen evolution at 490 °C which coincides with MnPO4·H2O. Although the kinetics of the LiMnPO4 cathode needs improvement, LiMnPO4 can be a safer alternative to other high voltage cathodes when materials design is optimized.
