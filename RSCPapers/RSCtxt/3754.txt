    , Accepted 4th October 2018First published on 4th October 2018AbstractThe need for long term, large-scale storage solutions to match surplus renewable energy with demand drives technological innovation towards a low-carbon economy. As a high hydrogen density energy carrier, formic acid streamlines functional storage of unscheduled intermittent power supply. However, the unfavourable thermodynamics of its direct synthesis from CO2 and H2 call for alternative processes to achieve substantial space time yields. This preliminary study investigates the feasibility of continuously producing formic acid in a two-step process by exploiting methyl formate as a thermodynamically stable intermediate. In order to prove the concept, the qualitative efficiency of several three-reactor configurations is evaluated and discussed with respect to the efficiency of a single reactor methanol synthesis over a commercial Cu catalyst. Although concrete solutions are not available yet and identification of formic acid remains arduous, the proposed reactive pathway exceeds the thermodynamic limits of the direct synthesis path over heterogeneous catalysts, and opens up avenues for advances in clean energy production.
Introduction
In the context of a hydrogen-economy, efficient and safe means to store and distribute hydrogen fuel are of utmost necessity to buffer its supply and demand. Indeed, intense research effort is devoted to economic large-scale production of hydrogen from water, exploiting off-peak surplus electricity from intermittent renewable sources of power, such as wind and solar. Currently hydrogen storage is achieved via compression, liquefaction, physisorption, or metallic and complex hydrides.1 However, the handling of potentially explosive hydrogen gas, its low volumetric density despite high gravimetric density, hydrogen loss, and the extensive energy consumption associated with these processes limit its use as a chemical energy carrier and require alternative storage media.
Liquid hydrocarbon fuels remain an ideal transportable energy vector. Such high-energy density liquids can be synthesised in a sustainable fashion by coupling the reducing power of renewable H2 with recycled CO2 waste captured from a point source or the atmosphere, provided that an adequate catalyst exists. Amongst possible hydrogenation products, formic acid (HCOOH with 4.3 wt% H2)2 and its derivatives are high density hydrogen carriers with promising energy storing capacity (53 g L−1), which exceeds pressurised H2 tanks (39.4 g L−1 at 700 bar). In the liquid state under ambient conditions, formic acid streamlines storage and transportation as it can produce high purity H2 (and CO2) when decomposed, in addition to its injection as a fuel in direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs).3 This reversible equilibrium between formic acid and H2/CO2 broadens horizons using CO2 as a building block for hydrogen storage. However, the reduction reaction is energetically hampered and a serious practical difficulty lies in the low thermodynamic stability of formic acid and its fast decomposition kinetics. The use of homogeneous Ru catalysts achieves substantial yields in aqueous media stabilising the product by esterification with alcohols or addition of bases.4–8 Nevertheless, for a large-scale synthesis of formic acid by CO2 hydrogenation, a major challenge remains in the development of heterogeneous catalysts,9–13 which are economically advantageous in product separation and offer potential continuous operation. The use of an external stabilising agent in such operation then becomes counter-productive and rapid product isolation on stream calls for a completely new strategy for a continuous formic acid synthesis from CO2 and H2.
This study explores ways of circumventing the thermodynamic constraints hampering the direct formic acid synthesis by introducing an intermediate step in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The remainder of this article reports the potential of an alternative synthetic path in a series of configurational variations of a three consecutive reactor system, exploiting the intermediary of methyl formate to simultaneously form formic acid and methanol as a valuable by-product. In total, seven configurations are presented, varying the packing modes of three different catalysts under fixed reaction conditions. Explanations for the diverging efficiencies are then advanced before closing with considerations on the purification of the effluent and on the economic viability. Finally conclusions open up opportunities for the development of heterogeneous catalysts for specific hydrocarbons.
Multi-step reaction in flow
The concept
Flow chemistry and novel process windows (NPW) contribute in developing technologies to lead to compact, safe, energy-efficient, economic and sustainable processes to intensify productivity. The former concept achieves so by minimising separation expenditure, while the latter acts on chemical intensification through the deliberate use of harsh chemistries at unusually high pressure, temperature or concentration.14–16 We use microreaction technology to enable the safe application of both concepts and efficiently explore CO2 hydrogenation routes. Making use of heterogeneous catalysis and high-pressure chemistry, the aforementioned major thermodynamic obstacle in the direct formic acid synthesis can be solved, or at the very least mitigated, by inclusion of a secondary reaction to transform formic acid into a stable intermediate sooner than its decomposition. The new pathway shall bypass thermodynamic constraints by reacting short-lived formic acid, or precursors of it transiently adsorbed at the catalyst surface, with methanol to yield methyl formate by esterification.49 Because methanol can also be produced in situ by CO2 hydrogenation via formate species,17 then methyl formate may be synthesised in one operational step by mixing two catalysts. Even though methyl formate shows good chemical properties as a fuel,18 it is not economically viable and it is more advantageous to produce formic acid and methanol rather than methyl formate. Since formic acid is commercially produced by hydrolysis of methyl formate with methanol as a valuable by-product, methyl formate shall act as a stable intermediate allowing an optimal CO2 hydrogenation step before converting it in a second operation step into formic acid and methanol via hydrolysis.

Fig. 1 depicts the reactions composing the synthetic path including methanol synthesis (catalyst 1), methyl formate synthesis (catalyst 2) and hydrolysis (catalyst 3), neglecting the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction as well as the production of water for the sake of brevity.

CO2 hydrogenation network

Table 1 lists the main reactions and thermodynamics involved in the two-step process. Because the complexity of the network strongly contributes to the speculative dimension surrounding CO2 reduction mechanisms,19,20 the tabulated list arbitrarily sequences the reactions according to the likelihood of their occurrence over each individual catalyst: reactions R.1–R.3 for methanol synthesis, reactions R.4–R.5 for methyl formate synthesis, and reaction R.6 for methyl formate hydrolysis. Reaction R.7 sums up the overall multi-step process. Thermodynamic reaction values were calculated on the basis of formation entities in the gas phase due to the predominance of the latter phase under the studied CO2 reduction conditions. The standard enthalpies and Gibbs free energies of formation used for the calculation of standard energies of reaction are tabulated in ref. 21 and 22.

As proof to the statement made in the introduction, the strongly endergonic reaction R.4 confirms the impossibility of an efficient direct conversion of CO2 to formic acid in the absence of a solvent. The operation in the aqueous phase promises a more favourable entropic barrier ( = −4 kJ mol−1), but obstructs methanol synthesis (Le Chatelier's principle) and at the price of additional downstream processing.7,23 Albeit the targeted overall reaction R.7 does not predict more optimistic energetics either, much to the contrary from it having the highest Gibbs free energy, carrying out the series of reactions in a consecutive manner has the power to weaken the endergonic hindrance. The alternative reactive pathway shall do so by breaking down the process into energetically more favourable steps defined by smaller , and by acting on the thermodynamics of single reactions using target-specific catalysts. The high linear-dependency between reactions of the network provides a means to tune the overall process efficiency by acting locally on each equilibrium-limited step and induce a succession of responses for a broader impact.
Exemplified in Table 1, the success of the multi-step route is rooted in the control of the numerous equilibria composing it. Although at the heart of the problem, the propensity of formic acid towards decomposition was not represented in the network for simplicity. For a trustworthy representation of the full process, formic acid dehydrogenation/decarboxylation (reaction R.8) and dehydration/decarbonylation (reaction R.9) reactions need to be accounted for.
For reversible hydrogen storage, it is crucial to manage formic acid synthesis and decomposition in a consistent and timely manner. Decomposition follows either pathway in Table 2 depending on temperature, formic acid concentration and catalytic surface: dehydration is thermally driven, whereas the desired dehydrogenation is an actively researched catalytic process.24–27 The reverse process, that is the synthesis of formic acid from CO2/H2, is generally controlled using a stabilising agent in batch operation. In the absence of a stabilising agent in flow operation, the inclusion of another catalyst to transform formic acid into a transient stable compound provides the ability to favourably disturb the overall chemical equilibrium, by reacting it in a subsequent step back into formic acid along a distinct energetically more favourable reactive route. The extent to which the balance between chemical equilibria can be shifted towards formic acid synthesis then directly ensues from the catalysts selected and the operating conditions. Since the reaction equilibrium of the second step depends on the stream composition exiting the first one, the predominance of one or another compound engenders downstream a cascade of counteracting responses responsible for the whole process efficiency. Methyl formate assumes the pivotal role as an intermediate promoting either hydrolysis or re-esterification as a function of its concentration relative to those of water and methanol. A molar excess of methyl formate or water would hamper esterification, shifting the equilibrium in favour of formic acid synthesis, whereas an excess of methanol would induce the opposite effect as soon as a little formic acid is formed.

Experimental
Catalysts
Three catalysts were used to perform the individual steps depicted in Fig. 1. Pellets of a commercial Cu-based ternary catalyst (Alfa Aesar, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, product number 45776) were used for methanol synthesis,28 crushed and sieved to a 45–63 μm size fraction (referred to as catalyst 1). A 1 wt% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst, pelletised, crushed and sieved to a 100–300 μm size fraction was used as a catalyst selective for formate species (referred to as catalyst 2). The macroreticular resin Amberlyst 15 in the hydrogen form (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of methyl formate (referred to as catalyst 3).29 The beads were crushed and sieved to a 90–125 μm size fraction.
Multi-stage hydrogenation of CO2 in flow
The high-pressure CO2 hydrogenation plant reported in ref. 30 was adapted to house three consecutive reactors as schematically represented in Fig. 2. The temperature of each reactor was controlled independently by means of three steps of resistive heating, while the pressure was controlled by means of a single back pressure regulator placed after either reactor R2 or reactor R3 depending on the operating pressure of the third reactor.
 Fig. 2  Partial scheme of the multistage setup with the three reactors R1, R2, and R3 connected in series with independent heating systems. The back pressure regulator was implemented either between reactors R2 and R3, or after R3 before the online GC (configuration shown here). 
The plant operation and GC analysis followed the general procedure detailed in ref. 28. The three stainless steel microreactors were packed with pure or admixtures of catalyst powders supported on a layer of smaller inert silicon beads and held in fixed position between two stainless steel filters. Although the packing configuration varied, the loading of each catalyst was kept constant in all cases, i.e. 100 mg Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (ca. 10 cm packed-bed), 90 mg Ag/Al2O3 (ca. 12 cm packed-bed), and 40 mg Amberlyst 15 (ca. 10 cm packed-bed).
The Cu- and Ag-catalysts were reduced in a flow of 10 mol% He/H2 for 120 min at atmospheric pressure at respectively 330 °C and 260 °C, whereas the resin catalyst was used in equilibrium with ambient air humidity (15%). The reactors were cooled down to room temperature before pressurising the system with a 10 mol% He/H2 mixture. The desired flow of H2 was set before starting the corresponding CO2 flow for a stoichiometric ratio of CO2:H2 = 1:3 at a total flow rate of 17.5 mL N min−1. Upon reaching a steady feed composition of 23 mol% CO2, 70 mol% H2 and 7 mol% He, the reactor temperatures were increased at 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature. Isothermal and -baric conditions were guaranteed respectively from the small reactor dimensions and from the negligible pressure drop across the fixed-beds during operation. Individual gas hourly space velocities (GHSVs) were defined as the ratio of the calculated total volumetric flow rate of the feed under normal conditions (0 °C, 1 bar) divided by the reactor volume occupied by the corresponding fixed-bed. Further details on the catalyst loadings, GHSVs, and reaction pressures and temperatures are tabulated for each configuration in the following feasibility study (Table 3).

Results and discussion
Synthetic feasibility
The first approach to the two-step process consisted of maximising the methyl formate yields at the outlet of the first process step to increase the likelihood of hydrolysis in the second step. A parallel study singled out Ag/Al2O3 as the most promising catalyst for methyl formate synthesis (list of catalysts tested provided in the ESI†) and attested the need for two consecutive reactors individually packed with a methanol synthesis catalyst and Ag/Al2O3, rather than a physical admixture of both packed in one single reactor due to contrasting optimal reaction temperatures. Thus, the first step of the continuous process in Fig. 1 henceforth refers to the combination of two sequential reactors respectively packed with catalysts 1 and 2 as represented in Fig. 3.

Table 3 presents the setup configurations and the operating conditions of individual reactors together with the overall performance estimated on the basis of the components detected by GC (detailed calculations provided in the ESI†). The outcome of each configuration is described in the list from C1 to C7 and compared to a reference two-reactor system with the methanol and formate synthesis catalysts operated under standard conditions.
• C1 The acid catalyst reactor R3 at 300 bar leads to high CO2 conversion and selectivities to methanol and methyl formate. Traces of DME appear from the dehydration of methanol catalysed by the acid catalyst.
• C2 An increase in temperature to 160 °C in R2 results in lower CO2 conversion and favours methanol synthesis over methyl formate, although the selectivity of the latter remains above the reference value. This outcome can be the result of esterification and consecutive formic acid dehydrogenation causing the co-production of methanol and simultaneous consumption of methyl formate.
• C3 Operating reactor R3 at atmospheric pressure achieves the lowest net CO2 conversion by promoting the dehydrogenation of in situ generated formic acid, and the simultaneous consumption of methanol via dehydration to DME.
• C4 Shortening the contact time in R3 limits the potential re-esterification from the lower methyl formate selectivity and CO2 conversion arising from formic acid decomposition.
• C5 Following reaction R.5, an equimolar feed ratio promotes methyl formate selectivity to an unprecedented 4.22% alongside methanol, although at the cost of lower CO2 conversion.
• C6 Physically mixing the 1 wt% Ag/Al2O3 catalyst to the resin results in similar CO2 conversions at 120 °C, but increases the CO and DME selectivities, whereas the methyl formate selectivity reaches its lowest value. The proximity of the acid sites on the resin might then either enable shorter diffusion paths for the fast hydrolysis of methyl formate and dehydration of methanol, or else almost completely suppress methyl formate synthesis, similar to the effect of acid promoted supported catalysts.31,32
• C7 The stable activity upon increasing the admixture temperature proves the resistance of Amberlyst 15 at 140 °C, and shows favourable methyl formate and DME synthesis over CO. The lower CO2 conversion despite the higher temperature than in C6 hints at a decomposition of formic acid.
The standard operating conditions use Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 packed in reactor R1, followed by 1 wt% Ag/Al2O3 in reactor R2 and eventually reactor R3 loaded with the acidic resin Amberlyst 15. A previous parametric study on methanol synthesis implied that the operation of reactor R1 with a stoichiometric molar feed ratio (according to reaction R.1) at 300 bar and 260 °C guarantees fair methanol yields from reasonable CO2 conversion (>55%) and methanol selectivity (∼29%).28 The co-production of CO from the RWGS reaction was noticed not to distinctly impact the operation of the downstream reactors as it was not directly involved with the intermediate methyl formate, and acted against the thermally driven dehydration of formic acid. Subsequently, the excess methanol at the outlet of R1 would promote the synthesis of methyl formate through transesterification between adsorbed methoxy and formates on the acid sites of the Ag-based catalyst in reactor R2 operated at 140 °C. The synthesis of methyl formate from methanol dehydrogenation was judged unlikely due to the abundant H2 in the stream. A greater Ag-catalyst loading prolonged the contact time to increase as much as possible the methyl formate yields as an intermediate (i.e. lower GHSV in reactor R2 than in reactors R1 and R3). In turn, operating reactor R3 under pressure at its highest allowed temperature of 120 °C offered maximum conversion regardless of the upstream composition.
Product identification and open carbon balance
Methanol, methyl formate, CO and dimethyl ether (DME) were detected as products of the multi-step reaction. However, the quantity of carbon containing products did not amount to the significant drop in CO2, resulting in a carbon loss of 11–29%. The open carbon balance (XC defined in the ESI†) suggested the formation of a carbonated product with a low FID response factor such as formic acid. Because the signal of a FID is proportional to the amount of oxidisable C–H bonds, the attempts to qualitatively trace formic acid in diluted gas streams, let alone quantify it, remained inconclusive. Although a similar GC signal was observed in the analysis of more concentrated gas phase formic acid, the identity of the unknown product could not be unambiguously determined by other analytical means (HPLC, NMR, and GC-MS). The GC analysis of more concentrated formic acid revealed a similar spectrum with several peaks most likely resulting from the decomposition of formic acid. A GC spectrum of the reaction effluent is provided in the ESI,† where CO2, methanol, DME, methyl formate and the unattributed peaks are evidenced in the FID channel (the TCD detector did not show other products than He, H2 and CO). Formic acid is strongly believed to account for the large discrepancy in the carbon balance as the sporadic condensation of the reaction effluent caused by the high conversion in R1 (ref. 28 and 33–35) revealed unequivocally that the medium was acidic in all 7 configurations. The pH analysis was qualitatively measured on pH paper because the amount of liquid generated was too little to use a pH probe for a quantitative gradation of performances. A 1H-NMR analysis (spectrum in the ESI†) supported the presence of formates in the reaction effluent of configuration C7 bubbled in a 1 M KOH(aq) solution. However, this analysis did not allow the origin of these formates to be distinguished because of the time span between sample collection and analysis.
Qualitative interpretation of process performance
It is evident that the absence of reliable analysis of formic acid in dilute gas steams prevents any cogent argument on process efficiency; at least qualitative appreciation of the amounts of formic acid produced is a prerequisite to compare the outcomes of various reactor systems and operation. Nevertheless, the yields, calculated as the product of CO2 conversion and selectivity, give a tangible appreciation of the potential of the multi-stage approach. A high methyl formate yield as in configurations C1, C2, C4, and C5 is a promising indication of an efficient formate catalyst tuning, exceeding by far the negligible yields predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as experimentally measured yields under identical reaction conditions, where a single reactor as R1 reached a maximum 1.50% at 700 bar, and yields at 350 bar did not exceed 0.38% at 260 °C.28 Alternatively, lower formate yields translated to a decrease in CO2 conversion accompanied by a decrease in methyl formate selectivity, which can also be interpreted as efficient conversion into formic acid. As a matter of fact, the absence of the latter at the outlet of R2 and the fast dehydration of methanol to DME over Amberlyst 15 suggest the favourable hydrolysis of the little methyl formate with water. The unclosed carbon balance in all configurations, especially in C6 (XC = 71.34%) and C7 (XC = 75.75%), suggests the production of an undetected carbonated product. As a matter of fact, the carbon deficit thus engendered surpasses up to 12% the ones usually caused by methanol solubilising in condensed water as in the reference configuration (XC = 83.10%).
Rigorous optimisation of the continuous two-step process
These preliminary results keeping the methanol synthesis catalyst under constant conditions confirm the pivotal position of methyl formate and establish the need for tuning of methanol concentration: an excess of methanol improves methyl formate synthesis, however such an excess is detrimental to the subsequent hydrolysis. Consequently, the fast consumption of methanol into DME is a potential solution to continuously remove the former from the balance and promote formic acid synthesis beyond equilibrium while avoiding re-esterification. Hence, an admixture of methyl formate synthesis and hydrolysis catalysts represents the most promising configuration, reshaping the two-step process as in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Scheme of the optimised two-step synthetic approach for the continuous conversion of CO2 and H2 into formic acid and DME via the formate intermediate. 
The ratios of water:methyl formate and methanol:methyl formate in both steps need to be optimised by adjusting the residence time and varying the catalyst ratios. Varying the amount of methanol synthesis catalyst with respect to that of the methyl formate catalyst leads to a tunable methanol excess. Additionally, two moles of water are produced against one mole of methyl formate through reactions R.1–R.3 and R.5, so that a molar excess of water is guaranteed. Finally, an admixed catalyst load in the second step adapted to the upstream catalytic performance should efficiently consume methanol and water to respectively limit the backward reaction and ease downstream product purification.
The multiple reactor system generates a vast set of variables to be tuned for an optimal efficiency. An exhaustive parametric study via grid search or design of experiments of all process configurations, studying the effect for each single reactor of pressure, temperature, contact time, catalyst loading, reactor dimensions and configurations, leads to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities, and is unaffordable.36 The use of autonomous laboratories, however, would open strategies to optimise the two-in-one process. In combination with artificial intelligence, automated characterisation in flow offers smarter, rigorous, yet efficient learning of the multivariate space by capturing and evaluating information in real time. These autonomous laboratories could potentially constitute a platform towards finding optimal operating conditions to reach human-defined goals, in full autonomy.37 Recently, the deployment of autonomous laboratories has been facilitated with the advances in high-level programming languages.37–39
Effluent purification
A practical aspect of importance for the feasibility of the multi-stage process remains in the downstream purification of the product stream. Methyl formate and methanol to a lesser extent profit from very different volatilities at atmospheric pressure rendering their separation possible as overhead products of distillation. The bottom product would however require further processing for the separation of the azeotropic mixture formed by formic acid and water (45% formic acid, 55% water, Tboil,1bar = 106.8 °C). The maximum-boiling azeotrope can be separated via different routes such as pressure-swing or extractive distillation. Otherwise, liquid–liquid extraction with alcoholic solvents40 or organic salts like ionic liquids containing NEt3 as a base41,42 are used to facilitate the distillation for formic acid recovery. Such solutions are sensible for most applications requiring free HCOOH, however they would defeat the purpose of the continuous process investigated herein which aims at producing formic acid free of additives for a straightforward decomposition into hydrogen fuel. For H2 storage purposes, recent heterogeneous catalysts showed high activity with dilute formic acid solutions.24,27 Consequently, an alternative, and therefore CO2-emitting distillation, using the conversion of methanol into gaseous DME, would not only promise increased formic acid yields, but also simplify purification from the liquid effluent. To this aim, the versatility of the acidic zeolite H-ZSM-5 with potential full methanol conversion to DME43,44 and simultaneous hydrolysis of methyl formate would allow the omission of costly dehydration steps. Indeed, not only did H-ZSM-5 (Alfa Aesar, NH4-ZSM-5, product number 45881) reach selectivities to DME exceeding 95% in a dual bed configuration with Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 during CO2 hydrogenation at 350 bar, it was also able to efficiently catalyse the liquid phase hydrolysis of methyl formate.
Energetic and economic feasibility
This section expands the theoretical and experimental foundations of the targeted reactive route to energetic and economic aspects. The process efficiency is currently too low to extract a realistic cost and energy balance; nonetheless general findings from life cycle assessments (LCAs) on CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbon fuels provide a sound starting point for a feasibility analysis. The LCAs examined the environmental impact of different technologies for the generation of green H2 and capture of CO2 from point sources or from the atmosphere.23,45–47
From an environmental perspective, assuming CO2 capture from concentrated sources such as flue gases of coal-fired power plants and H2 production from water electrolysis powered by wind would not allow a carbon-neutral process, but an alternative to sequestration and as one-time recycle of CO2, slowing its net rate of release to the atmosphere. From an energy perspective, the cost of high-pressure operation was shown to be pressure independent, where the compression work up to 400 bar was compensated by advantageous reaction thermodynamics, before slightly lagging behind at higher pressures.48 The surveys agree on the fact that the cost associated with the electrolysis of water weighs significantly more in the total power requirement (60%) than reactant compression (25%). To this respect the equimolar feed ratio shown in configuration C5 to increase formate yields brightens up perspectives for the presented reactive route.
Evidently the technology cannot currently compete for the production of formic acid at an acceptable rate and cost, while protecting the environment with a negative carbon footprint, yet the future amount of anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 motivates the development of formic acid as an energy carrier. With the joint progress in carbon capture, water electrolysis and formic acid dehydrogenation, the better understanding of heterogeneous catalysts drives the design of new generation catalysts, which could increase the technology readiness level (TRL) to competitive reach within an acceptable time frame.
Conclusions
The feasibility of an alternative CO2 hydrogenation pathway is evaluated for a continuous synthesis of formic acid and methanol through a methyl formate intermediate. Previous parametric studies on three specific catalysts, namely Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, 1 wt% Ag/Al2O3, and the acidic resin Amberlyst 15, pinpointed the operating conditions for optimal synthesis of methanol, methyl formate and formic acid, respectively. The present study combines these individual findings into a multi-reactor system in order to exploit methyl formate as pivot between the short-lived surface formate species generated from CO2 and H2 on supported metal oxides and formic acid in a thermodynamically stable liquid state.
Varying the configuration of the catalysts packed in sequential reactors evidenced a range of outcomes from substantially enhanced methyl formate yields to a significant carbon loss attributed to the production of an undetected carbonated product. Operating the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 reactor at 260 °C grants methanol excess for an efficient methyl formate synthesis in subsequent esterification on 1 wt% Ag/Al2O3 at 140 °C. The position of the resin catalyst plays a decisive role in the composition of the effluent stream: (i) secluding the resin in the third reactor at high pressure and/or using an equimolar feed ratio reaches high methyl formate selectivity and yields. (ii) Operating the resin at atmospheric pressure, or physically mixing it with the formate catalyst at high pressure, in contrast promotes the dehydration of methanol into DME. The significant loss of carbon balance in all but one configuration, reaching as low as 71.34%, hints at substantial production of formic acid. Although formic acid is not detected per se, the identity is grounded in solid evidence of the production of an acid compound from pH analysis combined to a one-time NMR analysis. The assumption is supported by the lower CO2 conversion caused by dehydrogenation of formic acid favoured at low pressure and high temperature.
The mere existence of formic acid qualitatively proved the potential of the two-step reactive pathway to alleviate the severe thermodynamic constraints of the direct hydrogenation to formic acid over heterogeneous catalysts. The preliminary experiments also clearly put forward the need for a deeper parametric study based on a reliable estimation of the acid formed. The knowledge of the impact of conditions on the individual and overall reaction tendencies shall lead to maximised formic acid space time yields. Eventually, the deeper understanding shall assist the design of a new generation of robust catalysts, which would render the multi-step process technically, energetically and economically more viable.
All in all, the continuous multi-step approach is the first work of its kind aiming at combining the discovery of advanced catalytic materials for an efficient CO2 valorisation into formic acid. It is evidently too soon to discuss implementation and substantially contribute a mature technology to the targets set by industry and governments in terms of CO2 emission reductions. Yet, the fundamental and applied knowledge gained in this study leaves ample room for continued improvement in catalyst and reactor designs. Such a holistic evaluation is expected to have vast impacts on related CO2 hydrogenation reactions, and the rational development of solid catalysts selective for formates.
