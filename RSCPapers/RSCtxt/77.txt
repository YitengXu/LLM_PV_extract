    , Accepted 22nd December 2017First published on 8th January 2018AbstractFour organic sensitizers incorporating a cross-conjugated cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) π-bridge have been synthesized. As a result of molecular engineering, broad high energy bands and red shifted absorption maxima and onset is observed relative to a benchmark analogue (C218) using a non-cross-conjugated CPDT π-bridge. The use of a cross-conjugated bridge allows a new strategy for tuning dye energetics and introduction of increased absorption uniformity by adding additional high-energy absorption bands. These dyes show solar-to-electric conversion up to 800 nm with one derivative exceeding the performance of C218 under identical conditions.
Introduction
Developing renewable energy conversion systems is important since worldwide power consumption is increasing dramatically. Research on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has been fuelled with the potential for affordable production, excellent tunability of device components and relatively high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from organic light absorbing materials.1–5 DSCs operate by light absorption of a sensitizer which then transfers an electron to an inorganic semiconductor. The electron then traverses an external circuit before being collected at the counter electrode by a redox shuttle, which returns the electron back to the oxidized sensitizer. The sensitizer or dye plays several critical roles in this process concerning efficiency of electron transfers and the breadth of the absorption spectrum used. Recently, SM315 and ADEKA-1/LEG-4 based devices have achieved record PCEs of 13.0% and 14.3% for single- and co-sensitized DSC device efficiencies, respectively.6–9 These exceptionally efficient dyes are designed based on three conjugated structural elements: a donor, a π-bridge and an acceptor (D–π–A). The π-bridge plays the critical role of both allowing the donor and acceptor regions to undergo intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and to define the initial energy levels of the molecule prior to substituent addition. An appropriate π-bridge should: (1) ensure a minimal optical gap to extend the region where sunlight is converted to electricity,10–14 (2) allow for properly positioned dye energetics for rapid electron transfers to TiO2 and from the redox shuttle,15,16 (3) suppress aggregation which lowers PCEs,17 and (4) reduce non-productive electron transfers (recombination).18,19
Thiophene-based building blocks are ubiquitous π-bridges due to excellent ICT properties and synthetic accessability.20–24 A thiophene-based π-bridge 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′] dithiophene (Hx2CPDT) was employed in the design of an exceptionally successful organic dye (C218) with a triphenyl amine donor (TPA) and cyanoacrylic acid acceptor (CAA) with a high molar absorptivity, low recombination rate and wide absorption range.25,26 The dialkylated CPDT bridge has now been incorporated into >125 dyes according to a SciFinder search, yet no conjugated alkene analogues have been evaluated. Herein, we have designed a new series of sensitizers with identical donor and acceptor to C218 that include a solubilizing cross-conjugated bridgehead olefin substituent (CCPh) substituent replacing the dialkyl chains on the CPDT π-bridge of C218 to give CCPhCPDT (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that by introducing the extended conjugated system of CCPhCPDT an increase in spectral response into the NIR region would be observed.27

Results and discussion
Two target dyes YZ11 and YZ13 directly replace the hexylchains of Hx2CPDT with a simple phenyl-alkene. These dyes differ in orientation of the phenyl group either toward the acceptor (YZ11) or toward the donor (YZ13). Since alkyl chains often contribute to DSC device photovoltage increases, we also prepared two 3,5- or meta-dialkylated phenyl derivatives, YZ16 and YZ17, which differ at the alkene conformation.
The synthesis of YZ11, YZ13, YZ16 and YZ17 proceeded in 5–7 steps from commercial materials (Scheme 1). The cross-conjugated aryl group was synthesized via a Negishi coupling of dibromide 1. Alcohol 2 was converted to the benzyl bromide 4 in high yield with the use of PBr3. Next, either commercial benzyl bromide 3 or 4 was converted to a phosphonium salt and a Wittig reaction with 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophen-4-one 5 gave the CCPhCPDT substituted intermediates 6 and 7, respectively. Vilsmeier–Haack reaction on 6 or 7 gave two silica gel column separable E/Z alkene isomers in equal ratios. The isomers were assigned via1H NMR NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) experiments (Fig. 2). By irradiation of the proton on the CPDT ring adjacent to the aldehyde for isomers 8 and 10, the two isomers could be differentiated. 10 shows a response from both the alkene proton and the aldehyde proton signaling that these protons are close enough for a through space interaction to be observed. This gave four separate CCPhCPDT π-bridges, which smoothly underwent an NBS bromination, Suzuki coupling with TPABpin, and a Knoevenagel reaction to give YZ11, YZ13, YZ16, and YZ17.

UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was performed with YZ11, YZ13, YZ16, YZ17 and C218 in dichloromethane to compare changing the π-bridge from Hx2CPDT to CCPhCPDT (Fig. 3, top). The absorption maxima (λmax) and absorption onsets (λonset) for all of the CCPhCPDT dyes were red-shifted relative to C218. The molar absorptivities at λmax for the CCPhCPDT based dyes were measured to be very similar at 15000 to 16000 M−1 cm−1 (Table 1). This is slightly lower than C218 at 20000 M−1 cm−1, however; a high-energy band near 440 nm for the cross-conjugated π-bridge based dyes reached molar absorptivities substantially higher than C218 in this region. The CCPhCPDT based panchromatic dyes show a much more even molar absorptivity across the full spectrum in solution than C218. Among the CCPhCPDT based dyes, the octyl substituents on YZ16 and YZ17 led to slightly higher molar absorptivities than YZ11 and YZ13. Interestingly, the dyes with the aryl groups oriented toward the donor region of the dye (YZ13 and YZ17) have similar absorption spectra with the high energy region being higher in molar absorptivity than the dyes with the aryl groups oriented toward the acceptor. Dye–TiO2 film UV-Vis absorption spectrum were also measured and are compared with the solution measurements as well as correlated to device performances below (Fig. 3, bottom).

Cyclic voltammetry was performed on YZ11, YZ13, YZ16, and YZ17 to estimate the driving forces for electron transfer from the redox shuttle to the dye (ΔGreg) and from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band (ΔGinj, Fig. 4). The ground-state oxidation potentials (0.87–0.93 V versus NHE) of these dyes were more positive than the I−/I3− redox shuttle (0.35 V versus NHE), which favors electron transfer from I− to the oxidized dye.28,29YZ11, YZ13, YZ16, YZ17, and C218 have very similar E(S+/S) values, which indicate that the CCPhCPDT bridge has minimal effects on ground-state state oxidation potential when compared with Hx2CPDT. The excited-state oxidation potentials (E(S+/S*)) for YZ11, YZ13, YZ16, and YZ17 were calculated from the equation E(S+/S*) = E(S+/S) − Eoptg and were found to range from −0.87 to −0.97 V versus NHE which is suitable for efficient electron injection to the TiO2 CB.30 This is significantly lower in energy than the −1.08 V value measured for C218. The energetically lower E(S+/S*) values for the cross-conjugated CCPhCPDT bridge when compared to the Hx2CPDT suggested that the excited-state is stabilized to a greater extent with the extended conjugation bridge with minimal effect on the ground-state oxidation potentials. This provides a valuable method for independently tuning dye redox potentials.

Having established YZ11, YZ13, YZ16, and YZ17 as possessing suitable energetics to work efficiently in solar cell devices, we next evaluated the orbital position and involvement/electronic structure via density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. For efficient DSC devices, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye should be oriented far from the TiO2 surface to reduce the rate of back electron transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye after an electron is injected. Also, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) should be positioned near the TiO2 surface to promote electron transfer upon photoexcitation. The HOMO and LUMO of YZ17 are illustrated in Fig. 5 with the remaining dye orbitals available in the ESI† (Fig. S2). The HOMO is primarily located on the donor and CPDT portion of the π-bridge with some contribution on the CAA (cyanoacrylic acid) acceptor and no contribution on the cross-conjugated phenyl substituent. This is consistent with the CV data which suggests that there is minimal effect on the ground state oxidation potential by introducing the cross-conjugated phenyl substituent onto CPDT. The LUMO is positioned primarily on the CPDT-CAA region with some delocalization on the cross-conjugated phenyl substituent. The HOMO and LUMO of YZ17 are well positioned for devices based on YZ17 to operate efficiently. TD-DFT was performed for each dye to better understand the broad charge transfer bands observed in the absorption spectrum and the broad high energy bands (Table S1, ESI†). In each case, the HOMO–LUMO transition dominates the low-energy vertical transitions (96%), while both the HOMO−1 to LUMO (44%) and HOMO to LUMO+1 (51%) primarily contribute to the high-energy vertical transition. The HOMO−1 is delocalized across the entire dye with the exception of the cross-conjugated phenyl substituent, and the LUMO+1 is entirely localized on the cross-conjugated phenyl substituent and cyanoacrylic acid regions. This result shows that the cross-conjugated phenyl substituent plays a critical role in influencing the LUMO and LUMO+1 resulting in strengthened high and low-energy charge transfer bands.

Solar cells were assembled and characterized according to the equation, PCE = (Jsc × Voc × FF)/I0 where PCE is power conversion efficiency, Jsc is the short circuit current, Voc is the open circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor, and I0 is the sun intensity. A range of PCE's were observed for devices prepared with YZ11, YZ13, YZ16 and YZ17 from 4.2% to 6.7% using the I−/I3− redox couple (Table 2 and Fig. 6). The dialkylated CCPhCPDT bridged dyes YZ16 and YZ17 gave higher open circuit voltages (622 and 671 mV, respectively) than the non-alkylated CCPhCPDT bridged dyes YZ11 and YZ13. For the dyes with the phenyl substituent oriented toward the acceptor (YZ11 and YZ16), similar overall PCE values of 5.4% versus 5.1% were obtained, respectively, with a higher photocurrent observed for YZ11. A significant difference in PCE was observed for devices prepared with YZ13 and YZ17, which have the phenyl substituent oriented toward the donor (4.2% versus 6.7%). This performance enhancement was the result of significant gains to both photocurrent and photovoltage for YZ17 to give the highest performing dye of the series. Under identical device conditions, YZ17 has a higher PCE than benchmark dye C218 due to the panchromatic absorption of YZ17 with a peak incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 67% and an IPCE onset of 800 nm (Fig. 6). This broadened IPCE response translates into a high Jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2 for YZ17 compared to 13.2 mA cm−2 for C218. The Voc and Jsc of YZ17 could be enhanced to give a 7.6% PCE device through the use of N2 bubbling during electrode sensitization to accelerate dye infiltration throughout the TiO2 film. The peak IPCE for this device reaches 77%, although the IPCE spectrum onset is blue-shifted by approximately 20 nm relative to the YZ17-based electrodes prepared without gas flow a higher Jsc value of 14.7 mA cm−2 is obtained.

Comparing phenyl group orientation with device performance, the non-alkylated phenyl group oriented toward the acceptor (E-isomer, dye YZ13) is higher performing by 1.2% PCE. However, for the heavily alkylated phenyls the phenyl group pointed toward the donor (Z-isomer, dye YZ17) is higher performing by 1.6% PCE. We reasoned the bulky chain alkylated phenyl group of E-isomer YZ16 could result in a lower dye loading due to sterics near the surface. Dye loading studies reveal this is the case as YZ17 has a nearly 2× higher dye loading on the TiO2 surface (2.1 × 10−8versus 3.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2, Table S3, ESI†). YZ13 with the smaller phenyl group oriented away from the surface only shows a modestly higher dye loading than YZ11 (4.6 × 10−8versus 3.9 × 10−8 mol cm−2). This suggests that if the dye loadings are similar, the phenyl group oriented toward the surface is higher performing (E-isomer YZ11 > Z-isomer YZ13 in terms of PCE). However, if the phenyl group near the surface has significant steric bulk, the dye loading is significantly diminished and the phenyl group oriented away from the surface will be higher performing (Z-isomer YZ17> E-isomer YZ16 in terms of PCE). Analysis of the film absorption compared to solution absorption reveals a substantial increase in the high energy absorption band of the film (relative to solution) for the donor oriented phenyl groups (Z-isomer dyes YZ13 and YZ17). This significant change could suggest either the dye planarity has changed at the surface significantly or the Z-isomers are more prone to aggregation. For the smaller non-alkylated phenyl group, we observe a correlation between keeping the solution curve shape with film measurements and high performance. However, this gain in performance is offset if the dye loadings are not similar as observed for the alkylated phenyl group dyes.
Electron lifetime studies were undertaken to better understand the higher Voc values observed for the alkylated CCPhCPDT bridged dyes versus the non-alkylated dyes and the higher Voc values observed for YZ17 relative to C218 for devices prepared under identical conditions (Fig. 7). A decrease in electron lifetimes was observed across the series in the following order: YZ17 > C218 > YZ16 > YZ11 > YZ13, which is identical to the order observed for the device Voc values. This suggests the long alkyl chains of YZ17 oriented away from the surface are most effective at reducing the rate of recombination of electrons in TiO2 with the redox shuttle. The broadened absorption and longer lifetime of electrons in TiO2 of YZ17 illustrate the utility of a cross-conjugated CPDT bridge relative to the commonly used Hx2CPDT building block.

Conclusion
Four cross-conjugated CPDT-based organic sensitizers were designed and synthesized. Dye isomers were assigned based on 1H NMR NOE studies, and the dyes were characterized via UV, CV, and computational studies to probe the effects of a cross-conjugated π-bridge on dye energetics. The CCPhCPDT bridge leads to a red-shift of the absorption spectrum and an increase in the high-energy absorption to give a series of panchromatic dyes. The red-shift in the absorption spectrum was found to be due to a stabilization of the dye excited-state oxidation potential. The addition of long alkyl chains onto the cross-conjugated CPDT bridge oriented away from the TiO2 surface was found to reduce recombination of electrons in TiO2 with the oxidized redox shuttle. A peak PCE of 7.6% was observed for YZ17, which surpasses the benchmark C218 under identical device conditions. This performance enhancement was in part due to an extended IPCE range reaching an 800 nm onset for YZ17. The cross-conjugated CPDT bridge approach offers a new strategy for tuning dye energetics to increase light absorption and increase device performance relative to the ubiquitous Hx2CPDT bridge used in C218.
