    , Accepted 21st May 2021First published on 27th May 2021AbstractDeveloping high-efficieny and selectivity catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is significant in converting solar energy to value-added chemicals, and Z-scheme heterostructures are promising materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their narrower band gaps and stronger redox reactivity. In this work, via first-principles calculations we have focused on the performance of a Z-scheme triazine-based g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure for photocatalytic CO2 capture and reduction. The results reveal that the band gap of g-C3N4/TiO2 calculated using the HSE06 method is 2.18 eV, which is smaller than those of g-C3N4 and TiO2. The electrons in the conduction band (CB) of g-C3N4 have a stronger oxidation ability and holes in the valence band (VB) of TiO2 have a stronger reduction ability. The electronic properties indicate that the construction of a heterostructure enhances the catalytic performance. According to the CO2 reduction pathway, the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure has remarkable catalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CH4 and CH3OH; the hydrogenation of CO2 → COOH* with a ΔG of 1.29 eV is identified as the rate determining step. The present work not only emphasizes the significance of the Z-scheme heterostructure, but also paves a promising way for photocatalytic CO2RR.
1. Introduction
The rising consumption of fossil fuels has resulted in the release of an excess of CO2 into the atmosphere, leading to unprecedented global warming, environmental pollution and other urgent problems.1,2 CO2 reduction into high-value-added chemicals and fuels, such as CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH, etc. is a critical goal for renewable energy storage and global carbon balance.3–6 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction converts and stores solar energy in chemical bonds which has attracted increasing attention.7,8 Some semiconductor photocatalysts (e.g., CdS, WO3 and TiO2, etc.) driven by visible light have been used for CO2 reduction. However, single-component photocatalysts have some obstacles, such as high recombination probability of photogenerated charge carriers, imperfect catalytic selectivity, insufficient CO2 adsorption, poor recoverability and so on.9,10 To overcome these limitations, two different semiconductors were assembled to form a heterostructure, which significantly improved the kinetics and selectivity of surface redox reactions.11–13 Particularly, the construction of a Z-scheme photocatalyst can implement high efficiency carrier transfer and retain the maximum redox capacity of the catalyst.14–16 In a Z-scheme heterostructure system, the photogenic electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are effectively separated. Compared to the components, the conduction band (CB) potential of a Z-scheme heterostructure is more negative, and the valence band (VB) potential is more positive, resulting in holes with high oxidative capacity and electrons with high reducing power being generated. Chai et al. prepared a WO3/g-C3N4 Z-scheme photocatalyst which exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB solution due to the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers.17 A transition-metal-oxide/g-C3N4 Z-scheme heterostructure was developed for the photocatalytic H2 evolution. Particularly, Co3O4/g-C3N4 exhibits high-efficiency and high-yield photocatalytic H2 evolution at a rate of ∼370 μmol h−1 within λ > 400 nm due to the suppression of electron–hole pair recombination and the enhanced redox ability.18 The urchin-like CoZnAl-LDH/RGO/g-C3N4 (LDH/RGO/CN) Z-scheme photocatalyst, which is fabricated from layered double hydroxides (LDHs), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and g-C3N4, acts as an efficient photocatalyst for CO2 reduction with an enhanced light harvesting capacity.19 The formation of a Z-scheme heterostructure not only restricts the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, but also promotes the oxidizability and reducibility of CoZnAl-LDH and g-C3N4.
TiO2 is the most common photocatalytic semiconductor used in water purification, pollutant degradation and dye bleaching. The pioneering work by Fujishima, Honda et al. demonstrated that TiO2 can efficiently split water into oxygen under visible light illumination20 and also reduce CO2 to HCOOH, HCHO, and CH3OH.21 However, the high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers in TiO2 leads to a lower quantum efficiency, which affects the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2.22 The anatase TiO2 photocatalyst is only active under ultraviolet (UV) light with a wavelength less than 387 nm due to its wide band gap (3.2 eV). For practical applications, the photocatalyst should be active under visible light. So, the development of photocatalysts is highly required.23
As a metal-free material, graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is considered to be a promising photocatalyst because of its favorable band gap (≈2.7 eV), two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structure with a π conjugated system, high stability, facile synthesis from low-cost materials and non-toxicity.24–27 However, the high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes impedes the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4. Thus, several strategies have been used to enhance the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers and further improve the overall performance of g-C3N4. Among these methods, coupling g-C3N4 with suitable semiconductors is considered to be an effective way to promote the photocatalytic activity.28–34 The heterogeneous Z-scheme SnFe2O4/g-C3N4 composite showed a high photocatalytic activity, and the CO2 reduction rate was 7.56 μmol g−1 h−1 without any co-catalyst and sacrifice reagent, which was higher than those of pure SnFe2O4 and g-C3N4.35 Di et al.36 fabricated a Z-scheme configuration of g-C3N4/SnS2 to improve the ability for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH and CH4. Numerous investigations indicate that the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure can serve as a promising photocatalyst driven by visible light. For example, Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 synthesized via a simple one-step calcination method showed a high photocatalytic performance for oxidation decomposition of HCHO in air, in which the photocatalytic activity is closely related to the content of g-C3N4.37 The synthesized g-C3N4@TiO2 can catalyze photoconversion of CO2 to light hydrocarbons under visible light irradiation, and the photocatalytic tests show that the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure is better than its components due to the high separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes in space.38 Theoretical work on the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure has revealed that the TiO2 surface is negatively charged, and the g-C3N4 surface is positively charged; hence, a built-in electric field at the interface is formed. Under illumination, the built-in electric field accelerates the transfer of photoexcited electrons.30,39 Based on experiments and theoretical studies, it can be certified that g-C3N4/TiO2 is a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst and can serve as an efficient and effective photocatalyst under visible light.
Inspired by the experimental advances in g-C3N4/TiO2, herein, the electronic properties and catalytic performance of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure were investigated, and the CO2RR mechanism was revealed by first-principles calculations. The results show that the construction of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure can efficiently modify the electronic properties by reducing the band gaps of g-C3N4 and TiO2. Meanwhile, the g-C3N4/TiO2 exhibits excellent CO2RR activity, in which CH4 and CH3OH are identified as the main products.
2. Computation details
All the geometric optimizations and single-point energy calculations were carried out using the Dmol3 code.40,41 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was the most common functional which was applied to depict the exchange and correlation effects.42 The relativistic effect of transition metal Ti was treated by the DFT semi-core pseudopotential (DSPP) method, which replaces the core electrons with a single effective potential and introduces some degree of relativistic corrections into the core.43 The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) was used for C, N and O atoms. The PBE+D2 method with the Grimme van der Waals (vdW) correction was employed to precisely describe the weak interactions between intermediates and catalyst.44 All the structures were optimized until the energy, force and displacement are less than 1.0 × 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1 and 0.005 Å, respectively. A conductor-like screening model (COSMO) was used to simulate the water solvent environment throughout the whole process, and the dielectric constant was set to 78.54 for H2O solvent.45 Brillouin zone integration was performed with 4 × 4 × 1 k-points for geometry optimization. In order to effectively avoid the interaction between the neighboring periodic units, a 30 Å vacuum region was set.
Based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) mode proposed by Nørskov et al., the CO2RR performance was evaluated by calculating Gibbs free energy change (ΔG)46,47viaΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGpH + ΔGUwhere ΔE is the computed reaction energy difference between the products and reactants; ΔEZPE is the change in zero-point energies, ΔS is the change in entropies and T is room temperature (298.15 K), respectively. In addition, the entropies and vibrational frequencies of gaseous molecules were acquired from the NIST database,48 zero-point energies of adsorbed intermediates were obtained from the vibrational frequency calculations. Only vibrational modes of the adsorbates were computed explicitly, while the catalyst was fixed (assuming that the vibrations of the substrate were inappreciable).49,50 ΔGpH = 0.059 × pH corrects the free energy under different concentration of H+, the value of pH was set to be zero for acidic conditions in this work. ΔGU = −neU, n represents the number of transferred electrons and U is the electrode potential.
The adsorption energies (Eads) were defined asEads = EA–S − ES − EAwhere EA–S, ES, and EA are the total energies of the adsorbed system (A–S), the substrate (S) and the absorbate (A), respectively. In this definition, a negative adsorption can indicate favorable adsorption.
Furthermore, the band structure, density of states (DOS) and electron density difference were simulated with the plane-wave norm-conserving pseudopotential method as implemented in the Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP)51,52 code using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof HSE06 functional.53
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structures and stabilities
Before constructing the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure, the geometric structures of TiO2 and g-C3N4 were fully optimized and are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The optimized lattice parameters of monolayer triazine-based g-C3N4 are a = b = 4.78 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 60°. The unit cell parameters of anatase TiO2 are a = b = 3.81 Å, c = 9.65 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, which are all in good agreement with the experimental and theoretical values.30,54–56 Due to the higher photocatalytic activity of the TiO2(100) surface than those of TiO2(101) and (001) surfaces,57 a single layer g-C3N4 and a TiO2(100) surface were selected to construct a g-C3N4(001)/TiO2(100) heterostructure. In order to get a matched interface of g-C3N4(001) and TiO2(100) surfaces, the lattices of g-C3N4 and TiO2(100) were redefined by entering new lattice vectors and shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The redefined lattice of the TiO2 surface containing 16 Ti and 32 O atoms and g-C3N4 sheet containing 12 C and 16 N atoms show excellent commensurability between TiO2 and g-C3N4 to obtain a lattice match. The optimized g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f); the lattice constant of the heterostructure is a = 9.60 Å, b = 12.47 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 39.59°. The calculated minimum distance between g-C3N4 and the TiO2(100) surface is 2.30 Å.

The thermodynamic stability of a catalyst is one of the criteria for evaluating the catalyst, which can be confirmed by calculating the interface formation energy. According to the following equationEF = Eg-C3N4/TiO2(100) − Eg-C3N4 − ETiO2(100)where Eg-C3N4/TiO2(100), Eg-C3N4, and ETiO2(100) denote the total energy of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure, monolayer g-C3N4, and TiO2(100) surface, respectively. According to this definition, the calculated interfacial formation energy for g-C3N4/TiO2 is −1.63 eV. The negative formation energy indicates that g-C3N4/TiO2 can be easily formed through an exothermic process.
3.2. Electronic structure
The electronic structure of the catalyst can provide a good understanding of its catalytic performance. The band structures of g-C3N4, TiO2, and g-C3N4/TiO2 were calculated using the HSE06 functional and are plotted in Fig. 2. The band gaps of TiO2 and g-C3N4 are 3.64 eV and 2.74 eV, respectively, which are close to the experimental values.58,59 The computed direct gap of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is decreased to 2.18 eV, which is smaller than those of isolated g-C3N4 and TiO2.

The partial density of states (PDOS) can be used to study the electronic structure in the local environment of the periodic system, and it plays an important role in the composition analysis of the atomic orbital which belongs to the energy band. In particular, the electron distribution near the Fermi energy level provides a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic ability of photocatalysts. The PDOS of TiO2, g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3. In isolated g-C3N4, the valence band (VB) is mainly contributed by N atoms, while the conduction band (CB) is mainly dominated by C and N atoms. For TiO2, the VB is composed of Ti and O atoms, whereas the CB is collectively contributed by Ti atoms. Fig. 3(c) depicts the total density of states (TDOS) of g-C3N4/TiO2, showing that the VB of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is occupied by the atomic orbitals of g-C3N4, while the CB of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is obviously occupied by the atomic orbitals of TiO2. Hence, the VB of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is composed of p orbitals of N and C atoms and s orbitals of N atoms, and the CB is mainly constituted by the d orbitals of Ti.

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure are illustrated in Fig. 4. The HOMO of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure mainly localizes around N atoms and moderately consists of C atoms on the surface of the g-C3N4 layer, whereas the LUMO of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is distributed on the Ti atoms. Therefore, the HOMO is contributed by g-C3N4 while the LUMO is mainly around Ti atoms in TiO2, which conforms to the PDOS.

3.3. Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism in g-C3N4/TiO2
In order to explore the charge transfer mechanism of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure, the CB and VB edge energies of g-C3N4 and TiO2 were estimated from the absolute electronegativity and the band gaps of semiconductors as follows:60,61 EVB = χ − Ee + 0.5Eg(1) ECB = EVB − Eg(2)where χ represents the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor; the χ values for g-C3N4 and TiO2 are 4.73 and 5.81 eV. ECB, EVB and Eg are the band edge energies of the CB, VB and band gap of the semiconductor; Ee is the scale factor between the redox level of the reference electrode and the absolute vacuum scale (AVS) (Ee = 4.44 eV for NHE).
The band edge positions of g-C3N4 and TiO2 and photoexcited electron and hole transfer of the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure are shown in Fig. 5. Under sunlight irradiation, the electrons are excited from the VBs of g-C3N4 and TiO2 to their CBs; simultaneously, the photoexcited holes are left in their VBs. The photogenerated electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 are limited to flow into the CB of TiO2, while the photogenerated holes in the VB of TiO2 can't transfer to the VB of g-C3N4. Finally, the photogenerated electrons and holes are left in the CB of g-C3N4 and the VB of TiO2, respectively. The strong electron coupling at the heterostructure interface efficiently separates the photoelectron–hole pairs. The CB edge potential of g-C3N4 is −1.07 V (vs. NHE), which is more negative than that of TiO2 (−0.44 V), so g-C3N4 has a strong reduction ability to reduce CO2. The VB edge potential of TiO2 (3.20 V) is more positive than g-C3N4 (1.67 V), so the photogenerated holes in TiO2 have strong oxidation capacity. The direction of the built-in electric field at the interface is from g-C3N4 to TiO2, which accelerates the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of TiO2 to the VB of g-C3N4 and prevents the photoexcited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 from flowing into the CB of TiO2. The above results indicate that the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure is a direct Z-scheme heterostructure. The CB of g-C3N4 is more negative than the reduction potential of CO2 to CH4 (−0.24 V vs. NHE) and CO2 to CH3OH (−0.39 V vs. NHE). So CH3OH and CH4 are predicted to be products for CO2RR under sunlight irradiation.

3.4. Mechanism of CO2 reduction on g-C3N4/TiO2
After confirming the geometric structures and analyzing the electronic properties of g-C3N4/TiO2, the CO2RR pathways on the catalyst were studied. All the possible reaction pathways for CO2RR for C1 products on g-C3N4/TiO2 are considered, which are displayed in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  All the considered reaction pathways of CO2 reduction for C1 products on the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure. 
From the interface charge transfer in the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure, the CO2RR occurs on g-C3N4 of g-C3N4/TiO2, and CH4 and CH3OH are predicted to be products. All possible CO2 reduction pathways on the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure were considered and the free energy change (ΔG) for each step was computed. The calculated Gibbs free energy diagrams for CO2 reduction to CH4/CH3OH are illustrated in Fig. 6. The adsorption energies (Eads) of CO2 and intermediates (COOH*, HCOOH, CO, CH3OH and CH4) are summarized in Table 1. The Eads of CO2 is −0.21 eV, indicating that the adsorption is between weak chemisorption and strong physisorption. The Eads values of all intermediates are negative, demonstrating that the adsorption is an exothermic process. In the reduction process, the absorbed CO2 interacts with the H+/e− pair to form a COOH* or *HCOO intermediate (CO2 + H+ + e− → COOH*/*HCOO). The CO2 molecule with D∞h symmetry is chemically stable and the photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a difficult process. CO2 hydrogenation is an uphill process which needs an energy input. The ΔG for COOH* formation on g-C3N4/TiO2 is 1.29 eV. The CO2 molecule hydrogenation to *HCOO needs more energy input, with the ΔG 2.47 eV, so it is not further considered. Both the C and O atoms of the adsorbed COOH* are possible sites for hydrogenation in which the formed COOH* will be further hydrogenated to CO + H2O or HCOOH. The ΔG for COOH* → CO and COOH* → HCOOH are −0.77 eV and −1.03 eV, respectively, indicating that both CO and HCOOH can form. In addition, the Eads of CO and HCOOH are −0.14 and −0.40 eV, respectively, suggesting that the CO and HCOOH can desorb from the catalyst. Besides, the weakly adsorbed CO on the CN material surface also possibly undergoes further hydrogenation.62,63 Hence, both CO and HCOOH hydrogenation on g-C3N4/TiO2 was considered. The ΔG for CO → HCO* and HCOOH → HCO* is 0.51 and 0.77 eV, respectively, showing that CO hydrogenation is thermodynamically more favorable. In the following step, the HCO* can be reduced to HCHO or CHOH* intermediates through the formation of C–H and O–H bonds, respectively. The ΔG values for HCHO and CHOH* formation are −0.62 and 0.56 eV, which are smaller than that of COOH* formation. So HCHO and CHOH* can both undergo further hydrogenation. Clearly, HCHO is energetically more favorable. The HCHO hydrogenation to CH2OH* with ΔG of 0.57 eV is more favorable compared with HCHO → CH3O* (1.56 eV) and CHOH* → CH* (1.24 eV). CHOH* → CH2OH* with the ΔG of −0.61 eV is exothermic. Once CH2OH* is obtained, the CH2OH* can be reduced via two different pathways: CH2OH* → CH3OH or CH2OH → CH2*. The ΔG of CH3OH formation is −1.17 eV and the Eads of CH3OH is −0.39 eV, indicating that CH3OH can be desorbed as a product. The CH3OH generation is apparently more favorable than *CH2 formation. The ΔG of the CH2OH* → CH2* reaction is uphill in the free energy profile by 0.13 eV, and CH2* can be further hydrogenated; both CH2*→ CH3* (−1.49 eV) and CH3* → CH4 (−1.08 eV) are exothermic. The Eads of CH4 is −0.18 eV, suggesting that the CH4 can be a product desorbing from the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure. Based on the above analysis, the most favorable path for CH3OH formation is CO2 → COOH* → CO → HCO* → HCHO → CH2OH* → CH3OH, and for CH4 formation is CO2 → COOH* →CO → HCO* → HCHO → CH2OH* → CH2* → CH3* → CH4 in which CO2 → COOH* is the rate-determining step with ΔG of 1.29 eV in the whole reaction. The structures of intermediates corresponding to two most energetically favorable pathways to generate CH4 and CH3OH on g-C3N4/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 7. We also considered the reaction kinetic aspect of the rate-determining step. The energy barrier for CO2 hydrogenation to COOH* is 2.68 eV, which might be high. But based on the experiments,38 the heterojunction photocatalyst formed from TiO2 and g-C3N4 can produce solar fuel (CH3OH/CH4) by the control of the photoreduction time of CO2.

3.5. Side reaction analyses
During the CO2 reduction process in aqueous solution, a competing reaction such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) should be considered.64 For the g-C3N4/TiO2 heterostructure, the free energy changes of HER in two different sites (N and C) were computed and are shown in Fig. 8. The ΔG for HER on N and C atoms of g-C3N4/TiO2 are 0.10 and 1.30 eV, respectively. So, the hydrogen atoms prefer to adsorb on the N atom in the C3N4-unit. The ΔG for HER on the N atom is obviously lower than that of the rate-determining step of CO2 reduction. In this situation, by adjusting the pH of the electrolyte, HER can be suppressed as much as possible.65 Utilizing nonaqueous solutions under real experimental conditions can also hinder HER.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically investigated the electronic structures and the possible pathways for photocatalytic CO2 reduction on g-C3N4/TiO2 by using first-principles calculations. It has been revealed that the constructed heterostructure can efficiently modify the electronic properties of the semiconductor by reducing its band gap and promote the redox reaction in the photocatalytic system as its CB potential is more negative and its VB potential is more positive, which is beneficial for electron transfers, thereby promoting CO2RR activity. Under a built-in electric field, the photogenerated electrons transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the VB of g-C3N4 and prevent the photoexcited electrons in the CB of g-C3N4 flowing into the CB of TiO2. Hence, a typical direct Z-scheme mechanism is evidenced in the triazine-based g-C3N4/TiO2 nanocomposite. Based on the calculated free energies, the rate-determining step for CO2RR on Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 is CO2 → COOH* with a ΔG of 1.29 eV and the main products are CH3OH and CH4. The present work suggests that g-C3N4/TiO2 could serve as a promising catalyst for the CO2RR with high activity and good stability. The g-C3N4/TiO2 constructed in this work provides a helpful strategy for the future development of a Z-scheme heterostructure for photocatalytic CO2RR and many other reactions.
