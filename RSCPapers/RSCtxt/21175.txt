    , Accepted 31st July 2019First published on 1st August 2019AbstractMacEtch allows subwavelength-structured (SWS) texturing on the GaAs surface without compromising crystallinity. The current density increases greatly, which is directly due to the reduction in the reflectance. Photons absorbed under reduced light reflectance are less affected by the charge recombination arising from crystal defects. The catalytic metal remaining after MacEtch serves as a catalyst for water splitting and increases the open-circuit potentials of the SWS GaAs photocathodes. The SWS GaAs not only amplifies the absorption of light, but also improves the collection of deeply generated photons at long wavelengths. The solar-weighted reflectance (SWR) of SWS GaAs is 6.6%, which was much lower than the 39.0% of bare GaAs. The light-limited photocurrent density (LLPC) increased by approximately 90% and the tafel slope improved as etching progressed. The external quantum efficiency was as high as 80%, especially at long wavelengths, after MacEtch. SWS GaAs photocathodes fabricated using MacEtch significantly reduce reflectance and recombination loss, thereby improving the key performance of PEC for hydrogen production. This technology can fully utilize the high absorption rate and carrier mobility of GaAs and is applicable to various photoelectric conversion device performance enhancements.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen generation using semiconductors has shown significant potential for the direct conversion of solar energy and mass production of storable and clean fuel.1–3 In 1998, for the first time, a dual-junction tandem structure for photoelectrodes was fabricated. It achieved a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 12.4% and demonstrated potential for utilizing compound semiconductor tandem structures.4 Although transition metal oxides such as TiO2, Fe2O3, and BiVO4 have been widely studied based on several advantages, including low cost and stability,5–7 they also have various drawbacks, including narrow light absorption bands and poor charge transport properties. In contrast, gallium arsenide (GaAs), which has been widely studied as a solar material in compound semiconductors, has a 1.42 eV band gap capable of absorbing visible light, a direct band gap for efficient photoelectric conversion, and high mobility for achieving a long minority carrier diffusion length. Due to these excellent physical characteristics, GaAs has achieved a record efficiency of 29.1% in a single photovoltaic (PV) junction device. Many studies have been conducted to improve the efficiency and stability of GaAs as a PEC electrode.8–17 Recently, PEC electrodes using tandem junctions have been published. Such junctions have shown sufficient photovoltage with a light-limited photocurrent density (LLPC) appearing at 0 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).18–22 Therefore, increasing the current density is critical to achieving high STH efficiency. High current density can be achieved by increasing light absorption.
The most widely used method for increasing light absorption is the application of surface antireflection techniques. Such techniques have been applied to many optical devices, such as solar cells,23–25 optical sensors,26,27 and light-emitting diodes.28,29 Conventional antireflective coatings are fabricated using multiple coatings of heterogeneous materials with different refractive indexes.30 However, such coatings often have limited spectral range, thermal mismatch, and poor adhesion and stability.31,32
When such antireflective coatings are used in PEC cells for water splitting, the coated heterogeneous materials tend to interfere with the semiconductor/electrolyte junctions, and negatively affect photon-to-hydrogen conversion. If the oxide antireflective coatings,33,34 that are typically used in solid-state PVs are used, they may interfere with the charge transfer at the interface. Subwavelength structures (SWS) are antireflection structures that are considered alternatives to antireflective coatings. Such structures have dimensions smaller than the wavelengths of incident light.30 The mechanical stability and photoelectric conversion of SWS PEC cell surfaces is easily ensured because SWS do not require the use of heterogeneous materials. Additionally, they can achieve low reflectance over a wide spectral range. PEC water splitting12 and Si-based solar cells35–38 with SWS have been used to improve device performance.
To fabricate SWS, reactive ion etching or nanoscale mask patterns formed via e-beam lithography are necessary.39,40 However, these techniques are expensive and complicated. Additionally, when reactive ion etching using high energy plasma ions is applied to group III–V compound semiconductors, it causes irreparable damage to their surfaces. Surface damages act as recombination sites, reducing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of PEC cells. Metal-assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) is wet chemical etching. Therefore, it only induces oxidation of the parts of the semiconductor that are in contact with the metal, and the technique causes no surface damage.41–45
Recently, several studies using MacEtch have been conducted to fabricate 3D structures from various semiconductor materials.46–51 Si nanowires fabricated on heterojunctions via MacEtch were demonstrated as PEC electrodes.52–55 Several articles of SWS GaAs using MacEtch have also been reported.56–58 However, to the best of our knowledge, no published papers have reported SWS GaAs photocathodes using MacEtch for the application of PEC water splitting.
In this work, we fabricated SWS GaAs PEC photocathodes using MacEtch. Au agglomeration was performed prior to MacEtch for nano-patterning. This is a simple nanopatterning method because it does not employ nanolithography. MacEtch minimizes the damage to the semiconductor surface that is caused by traditional dry etching techniques. Therefore, it is suitable for application to GaAs substrates, whose surface damage is difficult to repair. Additionally, MacEtch is an anisotropic etching process, meaning it has advantages in fabricating high aspect ratio structures. We analyzed the optical properties of the SWS and the efficiency of the SWS GaAs PEC photocathodes. Surface roughness and reflectance were correlated, and their impact on photocathode performance was analyzed.
Experimental section
P-type (100) GaAs (Zn-doped, 1017 cm3) was used as a substrate for the photocathodes. Prior to Au agglomeration to form Au nanoparticles, a 3 nm layer of Au was deposited on the p-type GaAs via thermal evaporation (10−6 Torr, 2 Å s−1) after cleaning the substrate with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized (DI) water. The p-type GaAs was immersed in a hydrochloric acid solution (HCl:DI water = 1:1) for 4 min to remove any native oxides. Next, Au nanoparticles were formed via thermal agglomeration through heat treatment at 600 °C for 100 s. The SWS GaAs was then formed via MacEtch. The etching solution was prepared by dissolving potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in DI water and hydrofluoric acid. The solution was stirred for 30 min before MacEtch. Following the fabrication of the SWS GaAs, 30 nm of Au, 20 nm of Zn, and 100 nm of Au were deposited via DC sputtering, and the GaAs was annealed at 400 °C for 1 min to form an ohmic contact with the GaAs backside. Wires were connected to the backside using Ag epoxy and sealed using an epoxy adhesive (Hysol 1C, Loctite). For measurements, a saturated calomel electrode (0.242 V versus a normal hydrogen electrode) was used as a reference electrode, a Pt wire was used as a counter electrode, and H2SO4 and K2SO4 (0.5 M) solutions with a pH of 1 were used as acidic media. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by applying an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 50 kHz at open-circuit potential. The profiles of the Au nanoparticles and etched GaAs were characterized via field-emission scanning-electron microscopy. The surface roughness of the SWS GaAs was measured via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Reflectance was measured within the 350–800 nm region using an ultraviolet-visible near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometer. The PEC properties of the SWS GaAs were investigated using a solar simulator (YSS-100C-C500H, Yamashita Denso) under air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination. We performed detailed simulations of the SWS GaAs by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method from Lumerical Solutions, Inc. The conditions for the simulations are described in the ESI.†
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the SEM images and schematics of SWS GaAs fabricated using MacEtch. Thin Au layers deposited on the GaAs show no morphological features (Fig. 1(a)). After the thermal agglomeration processes, Au nanoparticles with a maximum diameter of 100 nm were formed on the GaAs (Fig. 1(b)). Although the maximum size of the nanoparticles was approximately 100 nm, most particles had sizes under 20 nm. SWS were fabricated on the GaAs using Au nanoparticles as MacEtch catalysts (Fig. 1(c)). GaAs was etched deeply by the 100 nm Au nanoparticles and relatively shallowly by the Au nanoparticles under 20 nm. Previous research in our lab confirmed that the density and size of Au nanoparticles can be controlled with temperature and the annealing time used for Au agglomeration. These factors directly determine the size and density of the holes in the SWS GaAs. Control of the hole properties allows us to control the reflectivity of the SWS GaAs.58

Au nanoparticles are composed of relatively large particles with a diameter of about 100 nm and relatively small particles of under 20 nm in size. (C) Finally, SWS GaAs was fabricated through MacEtch. GaAs was etched deeply by the 100 nm Au nanoparticles, and relatively shallowly by the Au nanoparticles under 20 nm. 

Fig. 2 shows top and cross-sectional SEM images of the SWS GaAs after MacEtch. The depth of SWS increased with etching time, and the surface roughness increased, as shown in Fig. 3. The surface roughness of the SWS increases with the etching depth, which reduces the reflectance. Top views show that holes of various sizes are etched with particles of various sizes. As the MacEtch time increases, the depth of these holes also increases in the cross-sectional view. The etching depth of the cross-sectional SEM images were generally formed by Au nanoparticles of approximately 100 nm diameter. In addition, etching occurred on all surfaces where the particles touched the substrate, which gouged the substrate in random directions. These features increased the surface roughness, which was ultimately more effective at reducing the reflectance than conventional etching methods that increase the depth in certain directions. Fig. S1† shows the simulation that illustrates the reflectance is more affected by the surface roughness than by the etched depth in a uniform pattern.

As MacEtch occurs in a random direction, the surface roughness increases with etching time. (B) In the cross section, the etching depth increases with the etching time. The etching shown in SEM images was mostly formed by Au nanoparticles of about 100 nm. 
 Fig. 3  SWS GaAs AFM data and the rate of increase for RMS with etching time. Surface roughness of SWS GaAs increases with etching time. At the beginning of the etching process, deep holes formed by about 100 nm-sized Au nanoparticles and nanostructures formed by under 20 nm-sized Au nanoparticles affect the surface roughness at the same time, which shows a high RMS increase rate (5.3 nm min−1). After that, only the change of nanostructure due to the etching of GaAs by under 20 nm-sized Au nanoparticles affects and the rate of increase is relatively constant (2.1–2.6 nm min−1). 

Fig. 3 shows AFM images of the SWS GaAs after MacEtch. As the etching time increases, the surface roughness increases (2 min: 10.9 nm, 5 min: 16.1 nm, 10 min: 29.6 nm, and 15 min: 43.0 nm). For the first 2 min, the RMS increases rapidly, and after 2 min, it slows, and the RMS increases relatively linearly. It is believed that the holes formed by 100 nm Au nanoparticles affect the RMS at the beginning of the etching, but holes formed by 20 nm Au nanoparticles have a major influence on the RMS increase after a specific etching time. The reflectance of SWS GaAs is more affected by surface roughness than etching depth. Surface roughness usually increases with etching depth, but as shown in Fig. S.1,† etching depth in a certain pattern does not significantly reduce the reflectance. These results differ from those of a previous study, where the etching depth was determined to be the main factor affecting reflectance.58

Fig. 4 shows (A) the total reflectance spectra and (B) the solar-weighted reflectance (SWR) of the SWS GaAs as a function of wavelength in the range of 350–800 nm determined by a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The SWR is expressed by the following equation:  where R(λ) is the spectral reflectance of GaAs, and Nphoton is the number of photons of solar irradiation under AM 1.5 G illumination per unit area per unit wavelength. SWS has two effects on the reflectance of GaAs. First, the SWS reduces the variation in reflectance according to wavelength. Fig. S.2† presents simulated electrical field changes inside bare GaAs and SWS GaAs. The SWS GaAs (15 min of MacEtch) exhibited few changes in terms of light absorption at visible wavelengths, where as the bare GaAs could not efficiently absorb light at wavelengths below 460 nm. This means that when the SWS are formed in GaAs, there is no difference in their light absorption according to wavelength, so that effective light absorption over the entire visible light region is possible. This can be confirmed by the experimental results of Fig. 4(A). Bare GaAs shows a reflectance variation of more than 30% over the entire wavelength range. In particular, near 420 nm, its reflectance is close to 50%, which is approximately 15% higher than its reflectance at 750 nm. In contrast, SWS GaAs (15 min of MacEtch) exhibited reflectance values under 10% at all wavelengths with no significant variations over the entire wavelength range. The second effect is that as the MacEtch time increases, the reflectance decreases significantly over the entire wavelength range, which is associated with intrinsic SWS effects and the trapping of photons as surface roughness increases. This can be quantitatively confirmed by the normalized SWR over the full spectrum of visible light. The SWR of SWS GaAs was 6.6% after 15 min of MacEtch, which was much lower than that of 39% before MacEtch, representing a reduction of approximately 80%. This affects the photocurrent of the SWS GaAs photocathode.
 Fig. 4  Reflectance of SWS GaAs with etching for 0 (bare GaAs), 2, 5, 10, and 15 min as a function of the wavelength (350–800 nm). (A) Reflectance and the variation of the reflectance along with the wavelength decrease with etching time. (B) Solar-weighted reflectance also decreases with etching time. This shows that light absorption increases with increasing MacEtch time. 

Fig. 5 presents external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. The measurements were performed at −2.0 V versus Pt, and LLPC was achieved on the photocathodes. The EQE rapidly increases across the entire visible region as the reflectance of the SWS GaAs decreases. Specifically, the differences between the specimens began to grow at wavelengths above 460 nm, and the maximum difference appeared at 830 nm. At this wavelength, the EQE of the bare GaAs was approximately 20%, whereas that of the 15 min-etched SWS GaAs was approximately 80%. At wavelengths below 460 nm, the EQE of the 15 min-etched SWS GaAs photocathode did not show a significant increase. This phenomenon can be attributed to the effects of the GaAs structure on carrier recombination. In a paper published by Boettcher et al. in 2013, the effects of nanostructured photo-absorbers on photon-to-current conversion were analyzed in detail.12 From our simulation results, one can see that the longer the wavelength (within the visible spectrum), the more light is absorbed by deeper GaAs (Fig. S.2†). Excited carriers generated at deep layers of planar GaAs are easily recombined. However, in the SWS GaAs, the probability that an excited carrier can be used for hydrogen generation increases. Therefore, the difference between the EQE values of planar and nanostructured GaAs progressively increases at longer wavelengths.
 Fig. 5  External quantum efficiency (EQE) of SWS GaAs photocathode. As the etching time increases, the EQE increases across the visible region as the reflectance decreases. In particular, it varies greatly with etching time at wavelengths above 460 nm. This is because the SWS easily collect excited carriers compared with the planar structures. 

Fig. 6 presents the Tafel slopes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the SWS GaAs photocathodes. The Tafel slopes gradually decrease as the etching time increases. We believe that the Tafel slope might be affected by Au particles that can act as water-splitting catalysts. Au redistribution tends to increase the number of particles during MacEtch. In previous papers, it has been reported that out-of-plane mass transport occurs through pinholes generated by Au redistribution during MacEtch with Au catalysts.48,51 A more plausible cause for the gradual decrease in the Tafel slope is the increasing surface area. As the etching time of the SWS GaAs increases, the depth of the nanopores gradually increases. A PEC water-splitting reaction can be promoted at sites with increased activity. To better understand the enhanced HER activity of the SWS GaAs electrodes, EIS was performed on all electrodes. Nyquist plots of the SWS and bare GaAs electrodes are shown in Fig. 6(B). The charge transfer resistance (RCT) is reduced as etching time increases. These RCT values are in good agreement with the Tafel slopes.
 Fig. 6  Tafel slope of SWS GaAs photocathodes. The longer the etching time, the larger the surface area of SWS GaAs. At this time, there are more active sites where reactions occur. As a result, the Tafel slope gradually decreases to 2 min: 0.211, 5 min: 0.195, 10 min: 0.189, and 15 min: 0.155. (B) Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and dash lines are fitting results for each electrodes (the inset is the equivalent circuit). 

Fig. 7 presents a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis and the LLPC of an SWS GaAs photocathode. The dotted and solid lines represent the dark and photo currents corresponding to the etching time, respectively. SWS GaAs exhibits much higher current densities with optical illumination than Bare GaAs, and it becomes more pronounced as the etching time increases. Without optical illumination, the electrochemical reaction generates a small amount of current, but its amount is relatively small. MacEtch extends the surface area for electrochemical reactions, and the reduction in reflectance due to increased surface roughness further increases the current density that occurs under optical illumination. Under illumination, the open-circuit potential of SWS GaAs is positively shifted by approximately 0.15 V relative to bare GaAs, and this is considered to be a catalytic reaction due to the Au nanoparticles remaining after MacEtch. Fig. S.3† shows a positive shift in open circuit potential by approximately 0.1 V with Au nanoparticles, suggesting the catalytic activity of water splitting. Typically, subsequent effort is needed remove the noble metal required for the MacEtch catalytic reaction, but this is rather used as a platinum substitute to promote the water splitting of the photocathode. The open circuit potential of the SWS GaAs photocathodes shows no change with respect to etching time. The amount of Au catalyst does not seem to vary enough to change the open potentials. In contrast, the current density of the SWS GaAs photocathodes increases as etching time increases, and this is associated with the decrease in their reflectance. Inset figure is a graph showing the changes in LLPC as etching time increases. The LLPC was measured at an average current density from −0.5 V to −0.7 V versus an RHE. The LLPC values were calculated to be 18.3 mA cm−2 for bare GaAs and 22.8 mA cm−2, 26.5 mA cm−2, 29.9 mA cm−2, and 34.4 mA cm−2 for the SWS GaAs after 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 15 min of etching, respectively. The SWS GaAs photocathode after 15 min of etching showed an LLPC value approximately 90% greater than that of bare GaAs. This phenomenon is caused by the decrease in reflectance of the SWS GaAs. From Fig. S.4,† one can see that the applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the SWS GaAs photocathode increased by approximately 100% compared to the bare GaAs cathode. It can be confirmed indirectly that the efficiency can be increased by approximately 100% when SWS GaAs is applied to a highly STH-efficient tandem junction PEC cell.
 Fig. 7  LSV characterization of bare GaAs and SWS GaAs photocathodes. The solid lines and dashed lines indicate the current density measured under 1 sun illumination and without illumination, respectively. As the etching time becomes longer, the current density in the illumination condition gradually increases. The inset is the LLPC calculated as the average of the current density in the range of −0.5 to −0.7 V vs. RHE. The LLPC of the SWS GaAs photocathode etched for 15 min increased by approximately 90% compared to the bare photocathode. 
Conclusions
SWS GaAs was applied to PEC photocathodes to improve hydrogen generation. SWS GaAs provides low reflectance over the broadband spectrum of light, and the current density increased based on a decrease in reflectance. Additionally, the EQE increased rapidly at wavelengths of 460 nm or longer as etching time increased. The Tafel slope, which is thought to be reduced by changes in metal catalysts and surface reaction sites during etching processes, was evaluated. PEC properties improved when using the SWS GaAs structure, resulting in improved efficiency of PEC cells. It is a significant result that efficiency can be increased by increasing current density through the application of this method to compound semiconductor-based tandem junction PEC cells, which have recently attracted significant attention for their high STH efficiency. These results can be appropriately used as a method to increase current density if a method for securing the stability of GaAs is applied. In addition, this method can be applied to GaAs and other compound semiconductors known to be treatable via MacEtch in the same manner.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram and SEM images of the SWS GaAs fabrication process. (A) Au is deposited on cleaned GaAs by thermal evaporation. (B) Au agglomeration is induced by annealing Au on GaAs. Au nanoparticles are composed of relatively large particles with a diameter of about 100 nm and relatively small particles of under 20 nm in size. (C) Finally, SWS GaAs was fabricated through MacEtch. GaAs was etched deeply by the 100 nm Au nanoparticles, and relatively shallowly by the Au nanoparticles under 20 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of SWS GaAs with etching time. (A) In the top image, many holes were etched by Au nanoparticles with various diameters. As MacEtch occurs in a random direction, the surface roughness increases with etching time. (B) In the cross section, the etching depth increases with the etching time. The etching shown in SEM images was mostly formed by Au nanoparticles of about 100 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  SWS GaAs AFM data and the rate of increase for RMS with etching time. Surface roughness of SWS GaAs increases with etching time. At the beginning of the etching process, deep holes formed by about 100 nm-sized Au nanoparticles and nanostructures formed by under 20 nm-sized Au nanoparticles affect the surface roughness at the same time, which shows a high RMS increase rate (5.3 nm min−1). After that, only the change of nanostructure due to the etching of GaAs by under 20 nm-sized Au nanoparticles affects and the rate of increase is relatively constant (2.1–2.6 nm min−1).	 

 		 

 	Fig. 4  Reflectance of SWS GaAs with etching for 0 (bare GaAs), 2, 5, 10, and 15 min as a function of the wavelength (350–800 nm). (A) Reflectance and the variation of the reflectance along with the wavelength decrease with etching time. (B) Solar-weighted reflectance also decreases with etching time. This shows that light absorption increases with increasing MacEtch time.	 

 	Fig. 5  External quantum efficiency (EQE) of SWS GaAs photocathode. As the etching time increases, the EQE increases across the visible region as the reflectance decreases. In particular, it varies greatly with etching time at wavelengths above 460 nm. This is because the SWS easily collect excited carriers compared with the planar structures.	 

 	Fig. 6  Tafel slope of SWS GaAs photocathodes. The longer the etching time, the larger the surface area of SWS GaAs. At this time, there are more active sites where reactions occur. As a result, the Tafel slope gradually decreases to 2 min: 0.211, 5 min: 0.195, 10 min: 0.189, and 15 min: 0.155. (B) Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and dash lines are fitting results for each electrodes (the inset is the equivalent circuit).	 

 	Fig. 7  LSV characterization of bare GaAs and SWS GaAs photocathodes. The solid lines and dashed lines indicate the current density measured under 1 sun illumination and without illumination, respectively. As the etching time becomes longer, the current density in the illumination condition gradually increases. The inset is the LLPC calculated as the average of the current density in the range of −0.5 to −0.7 V vs. RHE. The LLPC of the SWS GaAs photocathode etched for 15 min increased by approximately 90% compared to the bare photocathode.
