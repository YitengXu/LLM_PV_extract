    , Accepted 10th February 2016First published on 10th February 2016AbstractThis work revealed that the thermoelectric properties of textured SnSe polycrystals, which are made of solvothermally synthesized powders with a preferred orientation grown along the (400) plane, can be enhanced, especially in the range of mid-temperatures. The electrical conductivity for the sintered sample is greatly improved in the whole measured temperature range, attributed to the high carrier concentration and unique mobility change. This results in a large power factor combined with the moderate Seebeck coefficient, especially in the range of 300–650 K, which exceeds 5 μW cm−1 K−2 at 423 K and even larger than 6 μW cm−1 K−2 at 521 K. Benefiting from the enhanced electrical conductivity and the low total thermal conductivity (<1 W m−1 K−1 in the range of 300 to 773 K), a higher ZT value than that reported for undoped single crystals was achieved in a relatively wide mid-temperature range, which reached 0.44 at 522 K and 0.5 at 573 K, and then showed weak temperature dependence in the range from 573 to 700 K. Above 700 K, the ZT value increased with temperature and a maximum value of nearly 0.6 was obtained at the maximum measured temperature of 773 K for the SnSe sample without any deliberate doping.
I. Introduction
Great interest has been attracted in thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their promising applications in waste heat recovery and electronic cooling.1,2 The conversion efficiency of a TE device is mainly determined by the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) for a given material, as ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, κ and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. A larger ZT value means a higher TE conversion efficiency, which requires good electrical transport properties together with a low thermal conductivity. During the past ten years, great improvement in TE properties has been achieved in several systems by optimizing electrical transport properties or reducing thermal conductivities.3–5 In particular, the highest ZT value has improved from 1.0 to 1.7, and even exceeds 2.0 in the IV–VI semiconductor PbTe, which is a classical and best TE material used at mid-temperatures.6–9 However, due to concerns for the limitation of the toxic Pb element and the high cost of the rare Te element in the future application, efforts devoted to search for alternatives with nontoxic and abundant elements are necessary.
Tin selenide (SnSe) was known as a narrow band-gap semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.90 eV at room temperature and a direct band gap of 1.30 eV at high temperature. It has been investigated as an earth abundant and environmentally benign component of photovoltaic devices such as solar cells because its band gap falls within the optimum band gap.10,11 Recent reports revealed that SnSe is a very promising TE material with a high figure of merit.12–20 A ZT value of 2.6 at 923 K was obtained for p-type SnSe single crystals along one of the crystallographic directions due to their extremely low thermal conductivity.12 SnSe is crystallized by a layered orthorhombic crystal structure with zigzag atomic chains composed of Sn–Se in the b–c plane at room temperature. Combining weak bonding along the a direction, the compound shows anomalously high Grüneisen parameters, leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. In addition, the typical layered and anisotropic crystal structure also lead to anisotropic electrical transport properties along each crystallographic direction in the single crystals, since the ratio of Hall carrier concentration to resistivity is much higher within the plane of SnSe slabs than perpendicular to them.12 Therefore, the TE properties along the b and c directions are much more excellent than those along the a direction.
Considering the poor mechanical properties and harsh production conditions of single crystals when used in future practical application, studies devoted to polycrystals are even more important. However, recent literatures show that the TE properties of the polycrystalline SnSe are somewhat disappointing because of the lower electrical conductivity and higher thermal conductivity with respect to the single crystals.13–16 The ZT values of the pristine bulk samples are usually lower than 0.5 at about 750 K. Even for the doped samples, the best peak of ZT is still lower than 1.0.13,14 In particular, it is worth noting that the TE properties in a range of 300–650 K for both single crystals and polycrystals are much poor compared to the performance above 700 K. The ZT value below 650 K is lower than 0.8 for the single crystals and 0.2 for the polycrystals, resulting in an extremely low average ZT value in the whole temperature range compared with PbTe and PbSe,8,21 which is not beneficial for practical applications. Although recent reports22,23 revealed that an ultrahigh power factor and TE performance over a broad temperature range can be achieved in a hole doped single crystal, it is still a challenge for the doped polycrystals due to the influence of many factors, including the lower texturing degree for the polycrystals and the lower electrical transport properties caused by unavoidable defects as compared to the single crystals. In the present study, SnSe polycrystalline samples were prepared by combining solvothermal reaction and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Compared with the solid state reaction of the elements at high temperatures, solvothermal reaction at low temperature shows a high degree of compositional control inherent in the synthesis of multi-element inorganic materials and crystal morphology control during the process of the crystal growth in the solution.24,25 Additionally, the approach here is milder or less complicated and might be elaborated to synthesize other selenide compounds if compared to other solution synthesis methods using toxic reagents or expensive reductants, such as co-precipitation.26,27 By adjusting the parameters for the solvothermal reaction, single phased SnSe materials with homogeneous composition and preferred orientation grown along the (h00) plane were obtained, which lead to a high orientation factor of the corresponding bulk samples. The electrical conductivity for the sintered sample is greatly improved in the whole measured temperature range, which is attributed to the increased carrier concentration, resulting in a large power factor and a high average ZT value.
II. Experimental section
Powders of polycrystalline SnSe were prepared by solvothermal reaction, using SeO2 (99.99%), SnCl2·2H2O (99.9%), hydrazine hydrate (85 wt%) and NaOH (99.9%) as the reagents. In a typical experimental process, 3 mmol SeO2 was dissolved in 20 ml of ethylene glycol (EG) after stirring for ∼20 min. Then 35 ml of hydrazine was added into the Se solution, resulting in a dark red suspension containing the Se source during the process. Stoichiometric amounts of SnCl2·2H2O (6 mmol) and NaOH (4 g) were added into 20 ml of deionized (DI) water as follows and stirred for 10 min until a transparent solution containing the Sn source was observed. It should be noted that excess of Sn2+ is necessary and the mole ratio of SnCl2 to SeO2 should be higher than two, because the Sn2+ itself acts both as a reductant and a precipitant.24,25 In the next step, the Sn containing solution was slowly dropped into the Se containing solution by stirring, which was then loaded inside a 100 ml PTFE (poly(tetrafluoroethylene))-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was then sealed and heated at 120 °C, 140 °C, and 160 °C for 12 h, respectively, followed by subsequent cooling to room temperature. The black SnSe products obtained at different solvothermal temperatures were collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water and ethanol several times before drying in an oven under vacuum at 60 °C for 3 h. Notably, when the solvothermal temperature was as high as 180 °C, no product was produced, possibly because the resultant decomposed in the strong alkaline solutions.24 Finally, SPS (spark plasma sintering) densification of the powder was conducted at 500 °C for 5 min with an axial pressure of 50 MPa to form both disk-shaped and column-shaped bulk samples.
The densities of the SPS-sintered samples were measured using the Archimedes method. The phase structures were investigated via continuous scanning at a scanning rate of 4° min−1 by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D/max-RB diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) under CuKα radiation. The lattice parameters were calculated by step-scan XRD with a step width of 0.020. The microscopic morphology of all the samples was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, LEO1530, Germany), and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) to observe the composition and distribution of the elements. The microstructure and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were observed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM JEOL 2011). The elemental composition and chemical states on (and near) the polished surface of bulk samples were detected using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Escalab 250Xi; Thermo Scientific, UK). Additionally, electronic probe microscopic analysis (EPMA, JXA-8230, JEOL, Japan) was used to observe the distribution of the elements on a polished surface. The Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistance data were recorded simultaneously as a function of temperature from 300 to 773 K using a Seebeck coefficient/electric resistance measuring system (ZEM-2, Ulvac-Riko, Japan). The Hall coefficients at room and elevated temperatures were measured using the Van der Pauw technique under a reversible magnetic field of 0.52 T (8340DC, Toyo, Japan). The thermal diffusivity (D) was measured by using the laser flash diffusivity method (TC9000, Ulvac-Riko, Japan). Thermal conductivity (κ) was calculated using the equation κ = DCpd, where Cp is the specific heat capacity obtained from previous research12 and d is the density. The uncertainty of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity measurements is within 5%, and that of thermal conductivity is estimated to be within 8% by considering the uncertainties for D, Cp and d. Therefore, the combined uncertainty for all measurements involved in ZT determination shown in the plot is estimated to be 15–20%.
III. Results and discussions

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the powders prepared at different solvothermal temperatures. It is clear that high-purity crystalline SnSe without any secondary phase can be obtained at each temperature. However, obvious difference can be observed if compared with the diffraction intensities in (400) and (111) planes. The relative intensities of each peak for the powder obtained at 120 °C are consistent with those of the JCPDS card file (No. #48-1224). Interestingly, the (400) peak became stronger when the powders were synthesized at 140 °C and 160 °C, indicating that preferred orientations occurred along (h00) planes. Meanwhile, the ratio of the integral intensity of the peak (400) to the peak (111) increases with increasing solvothermal temperature, which suggests that the SnSe nanocrystals might tend to accumulate along the (h00) plane rather than the (111) plane in the solution during the solvothermal reaction process. These results revealed that solvothermal temperature has an impact on the crystal growth, which is in agreement with its microstructure as shown in Fig. 1(b)–(e). Most of the powders obtained at 120 °C are flower-like consisting of nanorods about 200 nm in diameter and about 1 μm in length, although a small amount of plate-shaped particles was observed. With increasing temperature, the grain size increased and the flowers were disassembled. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 1(d), most of the powders obtained at 160 °C are composed of plate-shaped grains with an average thickness of about 200 nm and a width in a range of 2–5 μm, which indicates that the growth direction of the grains has been affected. In addition, a SEM image of a single plate-shaped grain with a thickness of ∼165 nm representatively presented in the inset of Fig. 1(d) also shows a clean and smooth surface. Actually, the observed SEM images of the powders during the formation of the final SnSe products at different reaction times suggested that the plate-shaped crystalline grains at 160 °C were formed via coalescence in the a-axis direction after all the flowers disassembled at ∼30 min. Fig. 1(e) shows a TEM image of a representative powder sample prepared at 160 °C for 12 h. The inset shows the electron diffraction patterns of the area pointed by an arrow in Fig. 1(e). Powder composed with plate-shaped grains and a small amount of nanorods can be observed in the image, which is consistent with SEM as shown in Fig. 1(d). The surface of the grain is clean and smooth without any secondary phase to be found. The SAED pattern on the surface of a plate-shaped grain indicates the single crystalline nature of the grain with dots for the (011) and (400) planes, suggesting that the preferred orientations occurred along the (400) plane, which is in agreement with the XRD results shown in Fig. 1(a). It is also noted that some of the grains in each powder have tapering ends which can be seen much more clearly in Fig. 1(e). This might be the result of minimizing the lattice face surface energy during the grain growth process.28

Disk-shaped samples were sintered via SPS to investigate their electrical transport properties. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of all the bulk samples, which are denoted as SS120, SS140 and SS160 according to the preparation conditions of the corresponding powders at different solvothermal temperatures of 120 °C, 140 °C, and 160 °C. The main peaks were enlarged as shown in Fig. 2(b). Notably, the XRD patterns were taken in the plane perpendicular to the pressing direction. All of the samples can be well matched to the phase of SnSe (PDF#48-1224). The calculated lattice parameters of the a axis for all the samples SS120, SS140 and SS160 are 11.5156 Å, 11.5276 Å and 11.5293 Å, and the lattice parameters of b and c axes are 4.4501 Å, 4.4388 Å, 4.4463 Å and 4.1594 Å, 4.1671 Å, 4.1663 Å, respectively, which are consistent with the reported data.29 No obvious differences can be found among the three samples. However, a stronger intensity of the peak (400) with a weaker intensity of the peak (111) compared to the standard diffraction peaks can be observed for all the samples, suggesting the existence of anisotropy. The bc orientation degree for the (h00) crystal planes of the bulk sample termed as F(h00) calculated using the Lotgering method are 0.28, 0.44 and 0.52 for the samples SS120, SS140 and SS160, respectively, which indicates that axial plan is preferentially oriented in the bc-plane. The relative larger F(h00) of SS160 among the three samples was mainly caused by the plate-shaped morphology of the corresponding powder as shown in Fig. 1. Additionally, the strong intensity in the pole figure of the (400) plane near 90° as shown in inset of Fig. 2(a) for the representative bulk sample SS160 further confirmed the existence of preferred orientation. These results are also consistent with the microstructure as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), in which an obvious orientation arrangement of the grains can be observed along the direction parallel to the SPS pressurizing direction. Moreover, a highly dense morphology can be found, which is in accordance with the high relative density of above 95%. Furthermore, the composition and the distribution of elements Sn and Se for the sample SS160 were examined by EPMA as presented in Fig. 3(c) and (d). It indicates that all the elements are homogeneously distributed without enrichment and the average ratio of Sn to Se is close to the stoichiometry of SnSe.

Fig. 4 shows the electrical transport properties of all the bulk samples in the temperature range from 300 to 773 K. A schematic drawing of the test direction for each parameter is shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b), which indicates that the properties were measured along the direction perpendicular to the SPS pressing direction. The data of the undoped single crystal (b axis) SnSe from ref.12 and of the polycrystalline SnSe from ref. 13 and 15 were also given for comparison. In the literatures, the electrical conductivities of SnSe are much lower than those of the traditional state-of-the-art TE materials in spite of the single crystal. The very high ZT of SnSe is attributed to the ultralow thermal conductivity due to the intrinsic anharmonicity of the chemical bonds.12 Undoped SnSe polycrystals have even lower electrical conductivity (<30 S cm−1 below 800 K) than single crystals because of their low carrier concentration (∼2 × 1017 cm−3) and carrier mobility.13 However, the electrical conductivities of all the present samples as shown in Fig. 4(a) have been greatly enhanced, especially in the temperature range from 300 to 650 K. A maximum electrical conductivity of 51.9 S cm−1 for the sample SS120 was obtained around room temperature. With increasing temperature, the value decreased up to 650 K (17.5 S cm−1 at 650 K) and then increased slightly. As for the samples SS140 and SS160, the values of the electrical conductivity and the changing trend at elevated temperature are all similar. At room temperature, the electrical conductivities are 20.1 S cm−1 and 31.6 S cm−1 for the samples SS140 and SS160, respectively. With increasing temperature, the electrical conductivity first increased rapidly and then decreased up to 650 K, resulting in a maximal value of 58.0 S cm−1 and 62.0 S cm−1 for SS140 and SS160 at around 470 K. These values are several times higher than the reported one of the undoped samples and even comparable to the doped samples at the same temperature.13 Above 650 K, the electrical conductivity increased with temperature, which is similar to that of the sample SS120.

Lines in Fig. 5(a)–(c) are guide for the eye only. Schematic drawing of the test direction for each parameter was also shown in inset of the (b). Data from ref. 12, 13 and 15 were also given for comparison; * data from ref. 12; ** data from ref. 13; *** data from ref. 15. 
The temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is shown in Fig. 4(b). The positive values of the Seebeck coefficient demonstrate a p-type conduction by holes as the dominant carriers. No obvious differences can be observed among the three samples except the SS160 one, which shows a slightly higher value. Although the Seebeck coefficients are lower than the reported ones, high values over 200 μV K−1 in the present work are still obtained in the whole measured temperature range. Even though one of the carrier concentrations is 1.02 × 1019 cm−3 at room temperature as discussed below, the value reached 275.43 μV K−1. Moreover, the Seebeck coefficient increases with increasing temperature and then slightly decreases at around 650 K, which is possibly caused by bipolar conduction since noticeable minority carriers would be excited at high temperatures. Actually, this result is consistent with the increased electrical conductivity as described above and also the enhanced carrier concentration over 650 K as shown in Fig. 4(d). Benefiting from the greatly increased electrical conductivity and the moderate Seebeck coefficient, the power factor significantly increased, especially in the range of 300 to 650 K. The change trends of the power factors in all the samples at elevated temperature are similar to those of the electrical conductivity, which first increased and then decreased up to 700 K. When the temperature is over 700 K, the value increases again. Therefore, a maximum power factor of 6.22 μW cm−1 K−2 can be seen for the sample SS160 at 521 K, while a peak value of 5.07 μW cm−1 K−2 can be observed for the sample SS140 at the same temperature. These values are much higher than the reported ones of the undoped polycrystals and even much better than those of the doped samples. In spite of a slightly lower power factor above 650 K, it is significant because a large average ZT value would be expected.
To identify the transport properties at elevated temperatures, the Hall carrier concentration and Hall mobility of the sample SS160 at temperatures from 300 to 773 K are presented in Fig. 4(d). It shows that the Hall carrier concentration has weak temperature dependence, although a slight increase above 700 K can be observed due to bipolar conduction as mentioned above. At room temperature, the Hall carrier concentration is 1.02 × 1019 cm−3, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the reported one of the undoped samples and even comparable to that of the Ag doped samples.13 Therefore, the larger electrical conductivity compared with those in the literatures mainly results from the high Hall carrier concentration here, which is also the reason for the lower Seebeck coefficient than reported in the references.13,15 In contrast, the Hall mobility shows strong temperature dependence. At room temperature, the Hall mobility is 17.6 cm2 V−1 s−1. With increasing temperature, the value increased rapidly and then decreased, which led to a peak value of 38.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 at around 470 K, in accordance with the change tendency of the electrical conductivity at elevated temperatures as shown in Fig. 4(a). Usually, the mobility can be described by a power law μH ∼ T−r, where r is the scattering factor of the carriers. The T−1.5 relation with temperature above 470 K indicates that the scattering of charge carriers is dominated by acoustic and optical phonon branches. However, the scattering mechanisms that dominate the transport cannot fully describe the unique temperature dependence of the mobility below 470 K, which shows a strong dependence of ∼T2.5 and implies the presence of an additional scattering mechanism. Moreover, the experimental data of μH ∼ T2.5 instead of T1.5 suggest that ionized impurity is not a dominant mechanism. In fact, the observed increase in Hall mobility with increasing temperature has been seen in Ag doped SnS, PbS and PbTe based materials, which were well explained by grain-boundary potential barrier scattering combined with phonon scattering.30–32 Generally, the mobility μ dominated by energy barrier scattering can be expressed as follows, if uniform distribution of barriers, of grain-boundary thickness less than the crystallite size L, and of electrical conductivity within the grains higher than through the boundary are assumed.32 (1)where q is the carrier charge, m* is the effective mass, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and EB is the height of the energy barrier in the deletion region. In the present study, a linear relationship can be observed in the plot of log(μT1/2) vs. (kT)−1 in the temperature range of 300–470 K. Fitting the data yields an energy barrier EB of 89 meV, which indicates activation behaviors for carriers through the energy barrier. This suggests that the energy barrier is formed in the SnSe sample. Therefore, the carrier transport below 500 K is mainly dominated by grain-boundary potential barrier scattering. With increasing temperature, the carriers have a higher average energy to get rid of the trap of the defects at grain boundaries. Thus, the phonon scattering mechanism would dominate the transport, since a T−1.5 relation with temperature above 500 K can be observed as shown in Fig. 4(d). It is reported that the barrier is related to the precipitates or chemisorption on the surface of a grain, which would result in an increased trapping of carriers at grain boundaries, forming energy barriers that impede the conduction of carriers between grains.31,32 As the temperature increases, the average energy of the charge carriers increases and therefore the electrical conductivity increases. In addition, a lower energy barrier height would be found in the doped samples with a large carrier density because the chemical potential is deeper in the valence band. In the present work, no intended element was doped or embedded in the samples. Meanwhile, no secondary phase can be found in the XRD patterns. Therefore, the grain boundary energy barrier was possibly caused by chemisorption of oxygen since the sample was prepared in the aqueous solution, or by some undefined doping because of the presence of other elements except Sn and Se during the solvothermal reaction, such as Na.
In order to confirm the composition the bulks, the composed elements and their oxidation states have been confirmed by an X-ray Photoelectron spectra (XPS) study. Ar-ion milling for more than 30 s was carried out on the polished surface before measurement, in order to remove impurities adsorbed on the surface, such as oxygen. The survey scan of XPS for all the samples as shown in Fig. 5(a) indicates the presence of Se (3d), Sn (3d5/2) and Sn (3d3/2) energy states, and a peak for Sn (3d) plasmon loss at 485.73 eV and 494.72 eV, without any energy states of other elements. High resolution XPS scans for Sn and Se as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c) reveal the presence of one valence states for the Sn and Se atoms. The peaks corresponding to Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 are singlet and no accessorial binding energy peaks can be found, indicating divalent characteristics of Sn ions. Similarly, a binding energy peak corresponding to Se (3d) is observed at 53.7 eV, suggesting that Se is attached to Sn2+. High-resolution scan XPS spectroscopy of the element Na was carried out to identify its existence, since no Na element can be found in the survey scan as shown in Fig. 5(a). Unexpectedly, a weak peak corresponding to Na (1s) was observed at 1071.92 eV for each sample, revealing the presence of the Na element. Quantitative analysis by XPS shows that the atom content of the Na is about 1.5% for the samples SS140 and SS160, while the content for the sample SS120 is slightly lower (about 1.0%). Actually, the compositions of all the bulks were also confirmed by EPMA. Quantified results indicate that the Na element was observed at some selected areas. However, the content cannot be given exactly due to the light weight of the Na element.

Since the carrier concentration of the corresponding bulk without any secondary phase has greatly improved compared with the undoped samples in the reference,13 the Na element should be doped in the crystal structure to form a hole dopant. As described in the Experimental section, excess of NaOH as alkaline media was added to the solution during preparation. Therefore, some Na elements might enter into the SnSe crystal structure during the solvothermal reaction. Combining the conduction mechanism of the grain-boundary potential barrier scattering, the Na-doped grain boundaries might be one of the reasons for the barriers. However, the detailed explanation of this phenomenon needs further theoretical and experimental studies. Hence, according to the Hall results, the unique temperature dependence of electrical conductivity is attributed to the unique mobility change. Additionally, conduction through the boundary potential barriers between grains essentially filters low-energy charge carriers, increasing the average carrier energy and consequently the Seebeck coefficient. Actually, it is observed that the Seebeck coefficient in the present work is much higher in comparison with those of the hole-doped polycrystals that were prepared by solid state reaction or mechanical alloying combined with spark plasma sintering.13,20 For example, the Seebeck coefficient of SS160 is 275.4 μV K−1 at 1.0 × 1019 cm−3 at 300 K, while the value of the Ag-doped samples from ref. 13 is ∼200 μV K−1 at the similar carrier concentration and at the same temperature. To further understand the transport properties, the Seebeck coefficient calculation as a function of carrier concentration at 300 K was performed assuming that the electron conduction occurs within a single parabolic band (SPB). The Pisarenko relation suggests an effective mass of md* = 1.20m0 in the present study, which is much higher than the reported value of 0.75m0 in the Ag doped samples, where m0 is the mass of an electron under vacuum.13 Therefore, the larger Seebeck coefficient here compared to the reported values might be caused by the large effective mass. Recently, a hole doped SnSe single crystal was reported to show a high electrical conductivity and a strongly enhanced Seebeck coefficient enabled by the contribution of multiple electronic valence bands.22 The present value is also very close to the value calculated with the full, multi-valley DFT band structure of the hole doped single crystal SnSe.22 Thus, the modified electronic valence band structure caused by Na doping as mentioned above might be the reason for the enhanced Seebeck coefficient. However, further study should be done to clarify it. Thereby, combined with the enhanced electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, a large power factor was obtained in the whole temperature range.
It is also noted that the sample SS160 shows the best transport properties among the three samples. In fact, the Hall carrier concentration and Hall mobility of the samples SS120 and SS140 at temperatures from 300 to 773 K were also investigated in the present study. The result indicates that regardless of the fabricating conditions, the Hall carrier concentrations of all the three bulk samples are similar and have weak temperature dependence, although the value of SS160 is slightly lower among the three samples. However, the Hall mobility of SS120 and SS140 is lower than that of the sample SS160 and shows strong temperature dependence. All the values of the three samples show similar temperature change tendency, which firstly increased and then decreased with increasing temperature. The unique temperature dependence of the mobility is mainly caused by the energy barrier scattering combined with phonon scattering as discussed above. Nevertheless, the largest Hall mobility of SS120 and SS140 is about 19.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 around 400 K, which is much lower than SS160 (38.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 around 470 K). As mentioned above, the different morphology for the powder has caused the different b–c plan orientation degree of the corresponding bulk samples. The F(h00) calculated with Lotgering method are 0.28, 0.44 and 0.52 for the samples SS120, SS140 and SS160, respectively. Thus, the outstanding grain orientation and the obvious layered structure of SS160 as shown in Fig. 3(b) would lead to a lower grain boundary concentration in the direction perpendicular to SPS pressing direction. Therefore, the largest mobility for the sample SS160 among the three samples mainly benefits from the much more highly preferred orientation of the corresponding bulk, since electrons would suffer less scattering along grain boundaries because of the lower grain boundary concentration.33
To identify the TE transport properties in the same direction, one column-shaped sample of SS160 was prepared. Fig. 6(a)–(c) shows the electrical and thermal transport properties as a function of temperature. Schematic drawing of the test direction for each parameter was also shown in inset of Fig. 6(a). All the properties were measured along the direction perpendicular to the SPS press direction, which is the same as those in Fig. 4. As seen in Fig. 6(a), similar electrical transport properties can be obtained compared with those of the disk-shaped bulk for SS160 as exhibited in Fig. 4, suggesting that the sample is stable. Fig. 6(b) shows the thermal transport properties as a function of temperature for the samples. It is observed that the changing trend of the thermal conductivity is consistent with that of the thermal diffusivity. The total thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature from 1 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K to 0.45 W m−1 K−1 at 773 K, which is very close to the reported values of the undoped polycrystalline samples.13 The total thermal conductivity is usually summed by electronic thermal conductivity (κe) and lattice thermal conductivity (κl). In the present study, the κe, obtained by LσT, where σ is the electrical conductivity, L is the Lorenz number; hold less than 10% of the total thermal conductivity, revealing that the heat transport of SnSe is predominated by phonon. Furthermore, the κl decreased slowly above 473 K, suggesting an optical phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity.34 Compared with the traditional materials, polycrystalline SnSe shows a low κl in the whole temperature range attributed to its unique crystal structure. However, it is unexpected that the value is still higher than that of single crystal.12 Actually, similar results were also found in recent reports on polycrystalline SnSe,13–16 which should be further clarified.

The data of some SnSe based samples obtained from ref. 12–14 were given for comparison. Schematic drawing of the test direction for each parameter is also shown in the inset of the (a). Lines are guide to the eye only. 
Combining the electrical transport property and thermal conductivity, the ZT was calculated as shown in Fig. 6(c). A maximum value nearly 0.6 is obtained at 773 K, which is comparable to that obtained in the Ag doped samples.13 It is worth to note that the ZT value in a temperature range from 300 to 650 K has greatly improved compared with the reported values.13–16 It has reached 0.44 at 522 K and enhanced to about 0.50 at 573 K, and then shows week temperature dependence in the range of 573 to 700 K. According to the expression of ZT, the enhanced value mainly benefits from the greatly increased power factor because of the improved electrical conductivity below 650 K as mentioned above. Therefore, the average ZTavg value calculated in the temperature range of 300 to 773 K as shown Fig. 6(d) is about 0.37, which is higher than those of the Ag (ZTavg = 0.26)13 and I (ZTavg = 0.14)14 doped samples, and even much larger than the undoped single crystal SnSe (ZTavg = 0.19)12 in the same temperature range. The improved average ZT of SnSe as an environmental friendly and economic materialis desired for energy recovering from waste heat. A higher ZT value could be expected for the doped samples in further studies.
IV. Conclusions
Polycrystalline SnSe samples were prepared by combining solvothermal reaction and spark plasma sintering and their TE properties in a range from 300 to 773 K were investigated. The results indicated that the pure phase SnSe powder with a preferred orientation grown along the (400) plane can be obtained when the solvothermal temperature is over 140 °C, which leads to a high orientation factor of the corresponding bulks. The electrical conductivity for the sintered sample has greatly improved in the whole measured temperature range because of the increased carrier concentration and unique mobility change due to grain-boundary potential barrier scattering. Therefore, an enhanced power factor was obtained along with the moderate Seebeck coefficient. The total thermal conductivities of all the samples are lower than 1 W m−1 K−1. As a result, higher ZT values than reported for single crystals were achieved in a relatively wide mid-temperature range, which reached 0.44 at 522 K and 0.5 at 573 K, and then showed weak temperature dependence at temperatures from 573 to 700 K. Being analogous to single crystals, the ZT values increased rapidly at high temperatures and a maximum value of nearly 0.6 was obtained at the maximum measured temperature (773 K). This work focused on polycrystals affirmed that SnSe is a promising material in the field of energy recovering from waste heat.
