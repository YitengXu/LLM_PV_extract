    , Accepted 24th January 2018First published on 25th January 2018AbstractWe report the first thermoelectric properties of Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0–0.75 nanocomposites, synthesized by using a facile polyol method. Systematic characterizations using powder XRD, Rietveld refinement of XRD, EDAX, XPS and Raman spectroscopy confirmed their single phase, hexagonal crystal structure with the space group P63/mmc, nominal elemental composition, valence states of the constituent elements and stoichiometric nature. The TEM images showing the CuS formation of nearly perfect hexagonal disk-like particles of average thickness 26.7 nm and breadth ranging in a few hundreds of nanometers with nanorods stacked from these hexagonal nanodisks (NDs) elongated along the c axis corroborate the FESEM images. Attributed to structural phase transition, an anomaly at 55 K is clearly observed in both the thermopower and Hall resistivity data. By increasing x, a systematic reduction in thermal conductivity was observed near 300 K. Consequently, a 50% enhancement in figure of merit was observed for Cu0.9Ag0.1S as compared to pure CuS at 300 K. These results therefore are expected to provide a new direction in improving ZT near 300 K.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, nanostructured materials have received considerable attention because of their associated superior physical and chemical properties compared to their bulk counterparts. In this direction, a completely new hope of improving the thermoelectric efficiencies of new thermoelectric (TE) material devices, compatible with their conventional counterparts such as home refrigerators and various petroleum product engines, has been witnessed during the last two decades or so. They have been correlated with their several attractive features such as dramatic tunability in the electronic density of states (DOS) and introduction of more interfaces.1 They therefore tend to be a possible master-stroke and hence a great hope for engineering nanostructures to enable the well-known electron-crystal phonon-glass requirement in their efficiency determined by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, κ and T represent the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and absolute temperature, respectively. In this expression, while S and σ are coupled with the charge carrier concentration (n), κ is partially coupled with n through the electronic component κe only as κ = κe + κl, where κl is the lattice contribution of thermal conductivity that is dependent on the phonon scattering. As a result, κl can be controlled through a change in the microstructure that leads in turn to a change in the DOS. However, since σ can be less immune to enhanced grain boundaries and smaller dimensions compared to κl due to their significantly different mean free paths, reducing the dimension leads to significantly reduced κl compared to σ and hence the probable enhanced ZT.1 The tuning of DOS by reducing dimensions from a 3D system to 2D, 1D or finally a 0D (quantum dot) system, concomitant grain boundaries or interfaces get multiplied leading to easier manipulation opportunities to possibly vary S, σ and κ quasi-independently. In other words, while nanostructured dimensions still allow the flow of electrons with relative ease such as in crystalline bulk materials (i.e. electron crystal), overwhelmingly enhanced interfaces scatter more phonons effectively thereby reducing κ dramatically (i.e. phonon glass). This situation therefore makes them very attractive for TE applications.
However, till now, most of the commercially available TE materials with higher efficiency contain toxic Bi, Pb, Se or Te. Therefore, nanostructured transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as a special group of potential candidates for replacing rare and toxic tellurium based materials.2–4 One example is the sulphides of copper, in which their stoichiometric compositions can vary in a wide range such as CuS2, CuS (covellite), Cu7S4 (anilite), Cu1.8S (digenite), Cu1.94S, Cu1.97S, and Cu2S (chalcocite).5 Among them, CuS attracts special attention because of its affordability, low toxicity and metal-like behaviour down to ∼5 K. It is an indirect p-type semiconductor with an energy band gap in the 1.55–2.15 eV range.6–8 It is stable up to 507 K and above this, it decomposes into Cu2−xS and gets liquefied.9 It therefore has various technological applications such as in solar cells,10 lithium ion rechargeable batteries,11 gas sensors,12 catalysts8 and thermoelectric devices.2,3
Recently, many strategies have been developed that involved (i) lowering of κ with nano/micro-particles having a complex structure,1,2 (ii) enhancing the value of S by increasing the average energy per carrier through energy filtering,13,14 local DOS increase over a narrow energy range near the Fermi level (EF) with suitable dopants15 and critical phase transition,4,16 and (iii) combination of the above two situations in nanocomposites.1,14,17–22 Due to the liquid-like state of Cu-ions in a rigid sulphide sublattice at high temperature, Cu2−xS possess low κ and show very good ZT. He et al.2 reported the ZT value of 1.7 at 1000 K for Cu1.97S synthesized by crushing the directly melted pure elements in their nominal ratio finely to form micro/nanostructured pellets using spark plasma sintering. Zhao et al.23 reported a ZT value of 1.9 and 1.0 at 973 K for bulk Cu1.97S and Cu2S, respectively, prepared by a melt-solidification technique, which indicates ZT is very sensitive to copper deficiency. Quite a few reports are available with very low ZT (near 300 K) for copper rich compositions (Cu2−xS, x = 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3) with highest ZT = 0.11 at 300 K for x = 0.15.3 Zou et al.17 reported a significant enhancement in the ZT value for the nanocomposites formed by introducing insulating SiO2 nanoparticles into the host Cu1.8S nanomaterials. These are in line with the theoretical reports1,24,25 that if insulating nanoparticles, such as SiO2, can be uniformly dispersed throughout the material, then the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient could be enhanced by a strong carrier scattering at the interfaces while the thermal conductivity could well be suitably reduced. Thus, among these experimental strategies, the formation of nanocomposites and the introduction of a nanostructured secondary phase into the host material are excellent ways to improve the ZT values.
Due to the several advantages on nanostructuring, more attention has already been focused towards chemical routes for the synthesis of CuS NPs in complex forms in several reports using sonochemical,26 microwave irradiation,27 solvothermal,11,28 hydrothermal29 and polyol7,30 methods. Chemical synthesis allows one to control the nucleation rate (or particle size and shape) due to the interfacial interaction between the inorganic materials and reducing agent/surfactant at the atomic scale. As a result, varieties of morphologies of CuS such as rod-like,31 concave cuboctahedrons,28 tubular structure,29 flower-like30 and nanodisks32,33 have been reported. Ghezelbash et al.33 reported the synthesis of hexagonal NDs of CuS using octenoic acid (C-8) and oleylamine (C-18) and produced with very low final yields. These resulting NDs were wrapped with a thick organic layer of ligands used, which is difficult to remove. The presence of an amorphous and insulating organic layer on the surface of NDs produces relatively low density and resistive materials that can create difficulties for their thermoelectric applications. Thus, a simple synthesis method that can produce high yield at low cost is needed, without using reducing agents containing long hydrocarbon chains such as oleylamine or trioctylphosphine.
Herein, we reveal the successful synthesis of hexagonal nanodisks of CuS by a polyol method34 using DEG as the solvent and reducing agent, which gives better crystalline products than those reported earlier.7,30 The formation of NDs has not been reported by this method till now. One idea is to utilize the theoretical and experimental understanding of ZT improvement with the Fermi energy (EF) of a dopant being nearly the same as the EF (i.e. electronegativity) of the host15 and the introduction of electrically insulating nanocrystals in the highly conducting host nanomaterials.1,24,25 The thermoelectric properties of Ag-doped CuS nanocomposites have therefore been investigated here to see the effect of the Fermi energy of Ag (EF = 5.49 eV35) nearly matching the electronegativity of CuS (5.27 eV36) host since this may cause a local enhancement in the DOS near EF, as desirable for enhancing S. Secondly, Ag-doping leads to the formation of an insulating phase of Ag2S in conducting CuS, which is helpful in reducing κ, enhancing S by filtering out low energy charge carriers and hence improving the ZT value. In addition to this, the disk-like nanostructures of CuS reported here may play a very crucial role for the same purpose.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
In a typical synthesis of CuS NDs by the modified polyol method,34 mixtures of 12 mmol of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99% MERCK) and 48 mmol of thiourea (99% MERCK) along with 50 ml of diethylene glycol (DEG, ≥98.5%) were taken in a three-necked round-bottom flask. Thiourea was taken in excess since sulphur is volatile.22 These mixtures were heated at 175–180 °C for 2 hours with a continuous flow of nitrogen gas that produced a black coloured precipitate (ppt). It was left for cooling down to room temperature. The product was directly centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 12 min. The resulting supernatant was discarded and the black ppt was washed with ethanol using probe ultrasonication for 2 min. Ethanol was decanted after complete settling of the NDs. These steps were repeated twice to remove DEG completely. Finally, the ppt was vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 1 h to give the sample in powder form. Finally, a 98% yield was obtained and ∼2% was lost while washing. This yield can easily be scaled up for the production of a few grams. This was used for characterization. For the synthesis of Cu1−xAgxS, we added appropriate molar amounts of AgNO3 (99.999% Aldrich) such that the nominal compositions Cu1−xAgxS: x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 are obtained.
2.2 Characterisation techniques
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies for all the Cu1−xAgxS: x = 0–1 samples were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.54 Å) in the angle range of 20° to 80°. Synchrotron radiation (0.786 Å) XRD data for pure CuS were collected at BL-18B (Indian beamline), Tsukuba, Japan, with a beam current of 401 mA in the angle range of 5–21.5°. The energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) measurements were performed using a JEOL JSM 5600 scanning electron microscope equipped with EDAX. For the analysis of the valence states of the constituent elements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (SPECS, Germany) using Al Kα radiation with an anode voltage of 13 kV and an emission current of 22.35 mA. A full-scan spectrum was recorded with an energy of 40 eV and high-resolution spectra were recorded with an energy of 30 eV. Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Jobin Yvon Horiba LABRAM-HR Visible instrument equipped with an Ar ion laser of wavelength 473 nm. Particle size distribution was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using a Carl Zeiss AURIGA FIBSEM in secondary emissions mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed with a TECHNAI-20-G2 system operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Seebeck coefficient (S) and resistivity measurements of all the samples in the temperature range of 5–300 K were performed in a specifically designed commercially available Dewar flask using differential direct current and a four-point probe in a home-built setup,37 respectively. Hall measurements were carried out on a 9 T AC Transport PPMS (Quantum Design) system, using a five probe method to omit the contribution of longitudinal resistivity. Thermal conductivity (κ) as a function of temperature was measured using a dc pulse laser technique in the temperature range of 5–300 K.38
3. Results and discussion
3.1 X-ray diffraction and EDAX
The as-prepared blue-indigo coloured CuS nanomaterials are first characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1(a and b). All the diffraction peaks of the synthesized CuS are well-matched to those of hexagonal covellite CuS having the space group P63/mmc, without any impurity phase. To further check the phase purity, Rietveld refinement analysis was performed for powder XRD of CuS taken from the lab source (Fig. 1(a)) and the initial parameters were taken from the literature;39 refinement parameters are shown in Table 1. Some low intensity characteristic peaks of CuS were not clear in the lab source XRD. Therefore, synchrotron XRD with λ = 0.786 Å was also performed (Fig. 1(b)), which shows all peaks that are well-matched with the JCPDS – 792321 data of CuS. The refinement of synchrotron XRD is very difficult because of large variations in its background. A crystallographic information file (CIF), generated after Rietveld refinement, is used for the generation of a 3D crystallographic structure of hexagonal CuS in the VESTA40 software (Fig. 2). In CuS, Cu occupies two different Wyckoff sites 2d (Cu1) and 4f (Cu2), whereas S occupies the 2c (S1) and 4e (S2) sites and their positions are tabulated in Table S1 in the ESI.† A primitive unit cell contains twelve atoms, six each of Cu and S, in which two Cu1 atoms have a triangular planar coordination with three S1 atoms. The other four Cu2 atoms have a tetrahedral coordination with one S1 and three S2 atoms and formed alternating layers of tetrahedral CuS4 and trigonal CuS3 planes (Fig. 2(a)). Two successive layers of CuS4–CuS3–CuS4 planes are joined through a S–S covalent bond along the c-axis (Fig. 2(b)). Fig. 2(c) shows the crystallographic view of hexagonal CuS along the c-axis (hkl = 001). In this, the Cu and S atoms form the hexagonal planes on top of each other. The S–S bond length of the S2 groups in the crystal structure is 2.0303(4) Å, the Cu–S distance in the CuS3 triangles is 2.1915(3) Å, and the mean Cu–S distance in the CuS4 tetrahedral is 2.3204(4) Å. The values of refined cell parameters, interatomic distance and bond angles of CuS (Table 1) are very close to that of the bulk.39 The c/a ratio, 4.323(4), is slightly higher than that of the bulk (4.316(1)). This is also greater than the ideal hexagonal value (i.e., c/a > 1.633), which indicates the highly anisotropic structure of CuS. For the minimisation of total surface energy, the preferential exposure of the [0001] plane is usual in covellite CuS because the {0001} facets have a lower surface energy than those of the {100} and {110} ones.28,41 Therefore, the formation of the NDs is expected. Due to probable improper solvent or different Cu-sources, it was not observed in the previous report on polyol synthesis,7,30 needs further investigation, which has been demonstrated in this report for the first time (Section 3.4).

While pure CuS is single phase in its XRD pattern (Fig. 1), many extra peaks corresponding to Ag2S are observed in the Ag-doped samples (Fig. S1, ESI†). Even for x = 0.1, traces of peaks due to the Ag2S phase are found and the intensity of those peaks is further increased with increasing x. These extra peaks match well with those of Ag2S (JCPDS-652356). This suggests the formation of Cu1−yAgyS/Ag2S nanocomposites, where y may be less than x = 0.1–0.75 only. To assess this, the lattice parameters are calculated manually (Table S2, ESI†). Even though there is a slight increase in these lattice parameters indicating that Ag is doped in the lattice of CuS, the trend is not systematic. Therefore, Rietveld fitting of these XRD patterns is attempted in which only x = 0.1 and 0.2 could be fitted successfully (Table S3, ESI†). In these, only a and b, not c, lattice parameters show enhancement with x. This is attributed to the doping of Ag into the CuS lattice. However, on close investigation, it is found that there is deviation in the fraction of Ag expected to be doped nominally in CuS. In x = 0.1, instead of the 10% Ag expected, only 0.98% is found to be doped while 9.02% formed as the extra phase of Ag2S (Table S3, ESI†). Further worsening the situation, for x = 0.2, only 0.45% of Ag is indicated to have been doped in CuS while 19.55% has been consumed to form the extra phase of Ag2S. This worsening trend of doping capability suggests that the amount of Ag doping deteriorates very fast as x increases such that at higher x, there may not be any doping of Ag in CuS. This matches well with the Raman data discussed below. When all the Cu-source is replaced by the Ag-source (i.e. x = 1) in the reaction, perfect single phase Ag2S formed (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The average crystallite diameter of the pure CuS NPs, estimated from synchrotron XRD using the Scherrer formula, is around 20 ± 0.1 nm. Similarly, for the x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 samples, the average crystallite sizes are 23 nm, 26 nm, 31 nm, 37 nm and 43 nm, respectively. This trend clearly shows that the average particle or crystallite size increases as Ag concentration increases. For elemental analysis, EDAX measurement was carried out for the Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0, 0.5 and 1 samples. The atomic percentages of constituent elements are tabulated in Table 2 and their spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In the EDAX spectra, only the peaks of Cu, Ag and S are present and no other impurity elements are detected. The experimentally obtained atomic percentage of Cu, Ag and S are nearly the same as the nominal values.

3.2 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS study of the as-prepared pure CuS NDs has been carried out and the full scan spectrum is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The absence of any other peak except C, Cu, S and oxygen in the full scan spectrum further confirmed its high purity. A high resolution spectrum of C 1s is presented in Fig. 3(a) and it can be deconvoluted into three sub-peaks on the basis of a broad peak feature that is consistent with the literature.42,43 The first peak at 284.6 eV is assigned to hydrocarbon (CC/C–C) associated with the surface of CuS NDs42 and used as an internal reference for nullifying the charging effect. The last two peaks at 286.1 and 287.9 eV match with the C–OH and CO bonds,42,43 respectively. Both of these arose due to the adsorption of DEG (reaction medium) on the surface of NDs. Fig. 3(d) shows the high resolution spectrum of O 1s. This is centred at 532.1 eV and comes from the reaction by-products due to the C–O and CO groups present on the surface of the NDs.43,44 This peak is away from that of CuO (529.2 ± 0.3 eV) or Cu2O (530.2 ± 0.2 eV).45
 Fig. 3  XPS spectra of CuS nanoparticles. High resolution spectrum of (a) C 1s, (b) Cu 2p, (c) S 2p and (d) O 1s. 
However, there are several reports available on the XPS and EPR studies of CuS, wherein a Cu+ ground state was also proposed. Kumar et al.46 reported that CuS contains discreet Cu2+, Cu+, S2− and S22− species. They suggested a model where only the tetrahedral site has Cu2+ centres while the trigonal site has only Cu+ centres. Because of charge neutralization in CuS, one of the tetrahedral sites is Cu+ and another is Cu2+. Therefore, they described the electronic structure of CuS as (CuTd)+(CuT)+(CuTd)2+(S2)2−(S)2− (CuTd = tetrahedral and CuT = trigonal).
With this, the Cu 2p peaks can deconvoluted into two pairs of doublets (Fig. 3(b)). The first doublet with major peaks at 931.9 (Cu 2p3/2) and 951.9 (Cu 2p1/2) eV is consistent with the expected peaks for the Cu+ state.47 The peaks of the second doublet are centred at 933.1 (Cu 2p3/2) and 953 (Cu 2p1/2) eV with a separation of 19.9 eV and they reveal the presence of the Cu2+ state in the CuS NDs.48 In addition, a weak peak at 943.4 eV is observed and is attributed to the satellite peak of Cu2+.45,48 The deconvolution of the S 2p spectrum (Fig. 3(c)) yields two main doublets. The first at 161.7 eV and 162.9 eV correspond to metal sulphides (M–S)49,50 and the second at 163.1 eV and 164.5 eV represents typical values for metal disulphide (S–S).51
3.3 Raman spectroscopic studies
Atomic vibrations of the nanostructured CuS are further characterised by Raman spectroscopy. It is very sensitive to any change in the crystal structure and stoichiometry. The typical Raman spectra of the resulting Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0–0.75 in the range 100–600 cm−1 and a schematic of S atom displacement in the CuS unit cell for A1g Raman modes and that of Cu1−xAgxS are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). An intense peak observed at 473.3 cm−1 (Fig. 4(a), inset) corresponds to the S–S stretching vibrational mode of the A1g symmetry of the S2 atoms at the 4e sites. This is obvious because in the covellite structure of CuS (Fig. 2(a) and (b)), 2/3 of sulphur atoms form covalent S–S bonds. Some less intense peaks centered at 267 cm−1 (attributed to a Cu–S vibrational mode32) and 142 cm−1 are also observed, which are in good agreement with the Raman modes reported by Ishii et al.52 for bulk CuS. In Fig. 4(a), the A1g mode centered at 473.3 cm−1 is red shifted (1.7 cm−1) as compared to the bulk53 and slightly asymmetric towards lower energy, which may be due to the smaller particle size of the NPs. This peak position is shifted towards higher energy for Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0.1–0.75 (Fig. 4(a)). The A1g mode S–S bond of the samples with x = 0.1 and 0.2 shows notable Raman shifts of 2.2 cm−1 and 1.5 cm−1 that match well with 0.98% and 0.45% doping of Ag in CuS, respectively, as indicated in the XRD analysis (Table S3, ESI†). The very slight shift in x = 0.5 and 0.75 as compared to that of CuS is attributed to the probable negligible amount of Ag doping as concluded in the XRD analysis and not the Raman active nature of Ag2S. The substitution of some Cu2+/Cu+ (ri ∼ 73/77 pm) sites by Ag+ (ri ∼ 115 pm) in the CuS host lattice is reflected as a shift in the A1g modes. The difference in their electronic polarizability52,53 and ionic radii may play a crucial role in the shift of the Raman mode (Fig. 4(b) and (c)).

3.4 Morphological studies

3.4.1 Study of FESEM images. 

Fig. 5 represents the FESEM images of the CuS nanoparticles, in which the particles look like rectangular, cubic or hexagonal shape disks. The morphology of the sample shows a tendency of rod formation. Nevertheless, most of the particles have hexagonal disk shapes and their stacking formed a hexagonal rod-like structure. To confirm this structure of stacking rods of nanodisks (NDs), XRD measurements on both the powder and pellet forms have been performed (Fig. S1(c), ESI†). The two spectra clearly show the appearance of enhanced (006) and (008) planes in the pellet suggesting the formation of significantly oriented rods of NDs in the (001) direction with the correspondingly diminished (110) peak at 2θ ∼ 47.99° as seen in the FESEM images (Fig. 5). The cross-sectional views of these rods also show the hexagonal structure. It seems that the presence of smaller particles with random sizes and shapes is due to the incomplete growth or breaking of the hexagonal disks as observed in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The breadths of these hexagonal disks range over a few hundreds of nanometres and the average thickness is nearly 26.9 nm, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 5(b). This is smaller than that measured from atomic force microscopy (38 ± 4) and dynamic light scattering (97 ± 17).34

3.4.2 Transmission electron microscopic studies. 
For further particle size analysis, we performed TEM on the CuS nanomaterials and the collected images are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). In this data, the shapes of the NDs are nearly perfectly hexagonal, associated with skeletal internal structures probably agglomerated from still smaller nanorods (Fig. 6(a) and (b)) but due to an improper dispersion medium (ethanol) they are seemingly agglomerated to form bunches of nanodisks. The thickness of the NDs is 26.7 nm and the breadth ranges over a few hundreds of nanometers. These parameters corroborate well with those of the FESEM images (Fig. 5). Fig. 6(c) represents the selected area electron diffraction pattern collected by taking the zone centre (0001), which confirms that individual NDs are single crystalline in nature. The nanorods made of hexagonal disks were not found in the TEM images because a very thin layer of CuS NPs dispersed in the methanol solution was spread on the carbon-coated copper grid by drop-casting. In contrast, nanorods were seen in the FESEM image since a small amount of the powder sample was directly sprinkled on conducting tape followed by gold coating (thickness of 1 nm) by sputtering (Fig. 5).

3.5 Studies of thermoelectric properties
The Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0–0.75 nanocomposite powder samples were consolidated by cold pressing at room temperature under an axial pressure of 1 GPa for 1 min; the calculated mass density increases with x (Table S4, ESI†). Their Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity were investigated in the temperature range of 5–300 K. In this connection, manipulations of free charge carrier concentration and mobility are very important for the improvement of ZT. In particular, CuS is intrinsically a p-type material and metallic down to 5 K due to the holes in the valence band that mainly originate from the S 3p orbitals,54 with minor contributions from the other Cu 3d and S 3s orbitals. The p-type conduction is clearly reflected in the thermopower (Fig. 7(a)) data of this sample. The increase in electrical resistivity of CuS (Fig. 7(b)) with increasing temperature on the other hand confirms its metallic nature down to 5 K. The calculated values of the Hall coefficient (RH) for CuS at fixed temperatures of 10 K, 50 K, 100 K, 200 K and 300 K are positive, which is consistent with the thermopower data (Fig. 7(a)), and charge carrier density (n) is close to that of the metal (Table S5, ESI†). However, the four probe ρ measurement of the as-prepared Ag2S sample was not possible to measure as its resistance was ∼1012 Ω. In the Ag-doped CuS samples, two main phenomena are expected to happen: firstly, some of the (CuTd)2+ ions would be replaced by the Ag+ ions. This leads to hole doping and increases the effective number of majority charge carriers (holes). Secondly, some Ag+ ions formed an insulating crystalline Ag2S phase that lies at the grain boundary of the host CuS and leads to the formation of the composite. The formation of the crystalline Ag2S phase was also evident from XRD (Fig. S1, ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Temperature dependence of (a) the Seebeck coefficient, (b) electrical resistivity for the Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.75 nanocomposites; and (c) temperature dependent Hall resistivity (ρxy) for pure CuS in the presence of a 5 Tesla field at different applied currents of 20 and 51 mA. 
It is well-known that the Seebeck coefficient (S) is highly sensitive to change in the electronic DOS at the Fermi level (EF) and a small change in the DOS is reflected in the value of S and hence σ that may be explained using the Mott expression;15 (1)where n, μ, q and m* are the carrier density, mobility, charge and effective mass, respectively. Also, n(E) = g(E)f(E), where g(E) is the density of states and f(E) is the Fermi function. The last expression of eqn (1) is valid for metals and degenerate semiconductors (such as CuS). In Fig. 7(a), the absolute value of S for CuS ranges from 3 μV K−1 to 13.5 μV K−1 and follows a continuously increasing trend with temperature above 55 K to 300 K, which is an usual behaviour of a degenerate semiconductor. The value of S ∼ 13.5 μV K−1 at 300 K is nearly thrice that of the single crystalline value of S = ∼5 μV K−1,55 which shows the importance of nanostructuring. This enhancement is well in accordance with the theoretical calculations in which an increase in the DOS near the Fermi level is expected for the low dimensional materials as compared to bulk1,14 and hence S is expected to enhance according to eqn (1).
The temperature dependence of S for the Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0.10–0.75 samples (Fig. 7(a)) overall varies between 3 μV K−1 and 15 μV K−1 in the temperature range 5–300 K. However, its variation with temperature is rather complicated. The Seebeck coefficient for CuS exhibits peculiar behaviour below 55 K. Similar trends are seen in x = 0.1 as well but with a slight reduction in the peak, hump and broad peak near 22 K, 35 K and 50 K, respectively. These latter trends continue to increase with a higher doping level such that at x = 0.75, the peak and hump almost disappear while the broad peak at 50 K turns out to be a relatively prominent peak. As seen from eqn (1), a small change in the DOS is notably reflected in the S value. These unusual changes in the S value around 55 K, not observed for the single crystal,55 may be associated with the change in the DOS of nanostructured CuS. This may be due to the structural transition from the hexagonal to orthorhombic symmetry at which a little change in the DOS near the Fermi level and in the carrier density occurs.54,55Fig. 7(b) shows the electrical resistivity of these samples in which no anomaly was found near or below 55 K and ρ increases with increasing temperature for each individual sample, confirming their metallic nature. The anomaly around 55 K, attributed to the structural phase transition, is also confirmed from the Hall resistivity (ρxy) (Fig. 7(c)) wherein another anomaly is also seen at 225 K. As its values are quite small, for further clarification, this experiment was repeated with a higher applied current of 51 mA, which clearly confirms the hump at 55 K. This is consistent with the earlier Hall data of the bulk CuS.54 These results suggest that the structural transition at 55 K is due to the change in both the charge carrier density and electronic density of states. The second clear change in ρxy at 225 K is unknown but is in agreement with the change in ρ (on magnification) at the same point (Fig. 7(b)).
Both S and σ at 300 K do not show any significant change for x = 0.05 compared to those of pure CuS (Fig. S4(a–c), ESI†). However, at low temperature, they increase slightly. For x = 0.1, increased S and decreased ρ are seen as compared to pure CuS in the whole temperature range of 5–300 K (Fig. 7(a) & (b)). For the x > 0.1 samples, this trend does not follow. S drops at 300 K for all the samples except x = 0.1 while it enhances below 300 K especially near 50 K as compared to pure CuS (Fig. 7(a)). They may be explained in terms of local enhancement in the DOS and an increase in the carrier concentration combined with the increasing trend of Ag2S fraction as x increases. From eqn (1), S can be enhanced for an increased rate of the change of the electronic DOS at the Fermi level; for instance, by a local increase in g(E).15 As we have already discussed (Section 3.1), for Cu0.9Ag0.1S, a fraction (∼1%) of Ag atoms was able to substitute on the Cu2+/Cu+ sites, and the other Ag-ions form Ag2S (Fig. S1, ESI†). In this situation, the valence band of the host CuS (EF = 5.27 eV)36 may resonate with one of the energy levels of doped silver (EF = 5.49 eV).35 Effectively, this local increase in the DOS near EF may lead to an enhancement in S (eqn (1)). Along with this, the hole density (n(E)) increases through the replacement of (CuTd)2+ by Ag+ that is seemingly quite marginal but sufficient for the reduction of ρ for x = 0.1; a similar situation was not achieved for x = 0.05. While scattering of the holes and phonons due to insulating Ag2S NPs is expected, the mobility (μ(E)) in Cu1−xAgxS is rather complex as x increases (Fig. S5, ESI†).
Actually, there is a competition between the charge carrier density n(E) and the mobility μ(E) due to which the electrical conductivity (σ(E) = neμ) and the Seebeck coefficient (eqn (1)) may either increase or decrease. An increase in the insulating Ag2S NP component with increasing x may lead to effectively more interfacial scattering of the carriers that may cause the filtering out of low energy heat and charge carriers.1,13,14,17,24,25 This may jeopardize the relation for n inversely proportional to μ in σ(E) = neμ such that they may not be so in the present circumstances. This is evident from these parameters at different temperatures (Fig. S5, ESI†). The value of n suddenly increases for x = 0.1 but drops for x = 0.2 compared to that for x = 0 at 300 K (Fig. S5(b), ESI†). At low T, they become somewhat close to each other. The reverse takes place for μ at 300 K for x = 0.2. The trend is diverse at low T especially for x = 0.1. However, n and μ versus T are inversely proportional to each other (Fig. S5(b) and (c), ESI†). While the maximum value of n for x = 0.1 (Fig. S5(b) and Table S5, ESI†) seems to explain the best electrical conductivity (Fig. 7(b)), unfortunately the value of n finally tends to that for x = 0.2 but is smaller than that for x = 0. This shows a rather complicated transport behaviour in the system. Consequently, both S and σ for x = 0.1 are enhanced simultaneously as compared to pure CuS in the whole temperature range (5–300 K) and a 36.8% enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor has been obtained only for x = 0.1 as compared to CuS at 300 K (Fig. S4(d), ESI†).
For thermal conductivity, as is usual, the temperature dependence of Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0–0.75 is considered to consist of the electronic (κe) and lattice (κl) components, i.e. κ = κl + κe. Since we know their electrical conductivity σ (Fig. 7(b) or Fig. S4(c), ESI†) and κe = LσT (Wiedemann–Franz law), where L is the Lorenz number (2.44 × 10−8 W Ω K−2), we calculated κe for all the samples (Fig. 8(a)). It is noted that κe for x = 0.1 is increased by 15.4% at 300 K and maintains a higher value over the whole measurement range (5–300 K) as compared to CuS, and for x > 0.1, it decreases systematically. The lattice thermal conductivities were then obtained from κl = κ −κe (Fig. 8(a)). They are relatively much larger in magnitude than those of κe showing that the thermal conductivity component due to lattice κl dominates over its electronic component κe in the whole temperature range. This is interpreted as the importance of the nanostructuring and Ag-doping in the Cu1−xAgxS nanocomposites. A significant drop of 17.6% in κl at 300 K for the x = 0.1 sample as compared to pure CuS is observed with almost zero slope down to about 160 K. It drops faster below this temperature as temperature decreases. This is associated with a sharp change in the slope below 40 K. These changing trends continue as x increases. When x = 0.5, the slope became negative and a peak-like feature started developing near 30 K, which is most prominent in the x = 0.75 sample. The peak-like features for x = 0.5 and 0.75 (Fig. S4(e), ESI†) are indicative of their more crystalline nature wherein the Ag2S content is the main material while CuS becomes the impurity phase. This may be related to the larger average crystallite size with the main component as Ag2S, while samples with smaller x with smaller average crystallite sizes with CuS as the main component (Section 3.1) perhaps behave as a less crystalline material in the thermal conductivity data. Thus, the total thermal conductivities for the Ag-doped samples are significantly lower than that for pure CuS and systematically decrease with x near 300 K (Fig. S4(e), ESI†). Further, the lattice thermal conductivity of CuS shows a nearly linear behaviour associated with a positive slope at higher temperature with a sudden change in the slope below 62 K. It is therefore interesting to note that the way in which the thermal conductivity enhances or decreases depends on the temperature range that one considers. Even though there is a systematic decrease near 300 K, there is an enhancement at lower temperature. Therefore, since the average particle size increases with x, the expected fall in the thermal conductivity as x increases is seemingly compensated by the more insulating nature of Ag2S than CuS. Associated with these facts are the enhanced grain boundaries (GBs) or enhanced number of particles per unit volume in smaller particle size samples compared to the larger ones. Since GBs are generally relatively more disordered atomically, disordered regions tend to increase (per unit volume of the material) with a decrease in the particle size compared to the cores of particles. In addition, the disorder would be further enhanced due to the presence of more DEG molecules (see Section 3.2) on the enhanced surface area in the smaller particle samples. Simultaneously, while x is increasing, two competing phenomena occur due to the very few Ag atoms replacing Cu sites to increase the number of point defects in Cu1−xAgxS at the cost of forming the more dominant crystalline Ag2S phase with reducing point defects that in turn corroborate quite well with the thermal conductivity data. Therefore, due to the combined effect of an increase in the average crystallite size and consequent reduction in the density of point defects, the overall κl near 30 K increases with increasing x and exhibits peak-like features.
 Fig. 8  Temperature dependence of (a) electronic (κe) and lattice (κl) components of thermal conductivity and (b) the calculated values of ZT for the Cu1−xAgxS, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.75 nanocomposites. 
Thermoelectric figure of merit ZT was obtained for the Cu1−xAgxS nanocomposites (Fig. 8(b)). The highest ZT is 0.003 at 300 K for x = 0.1. This is a 50% enhancement as compared to CuS (ZT = 0.002). However, no enhancement is observed for the x = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.75 samples. Thus, although a systematic suppression of κ with increasing x is obtained at 300 K and the lowest value (1.77 W m−1 K−1) is achieved for x = 0.75 (Fig. S4(e), ESI†), there is no improvement in ZT due to its poor σ. The calculated ZT values at 300 K are tabulated in Table S6 (ESI†). While this ZT value is not encouragingly high for TE applications itself, the formation of a nanostructure (hexagonal NDs) by the polyol method without using ligands with long hydrocarbon chains such as oleylamine is quite promising for the synthesis of other good TE materials. As seen by the trend, the main reason for the very small ZT could be the low temperature (300 K) palletisation/consolidation that produces the low density material.14 In spite of these drawbacks, the ZT value of 0.003 is about 167 times higher than that observed in Bi1.6Cu0.4S3.22 It is expected that these materials at high density will exhibit an enhanced ZT when they are prepared through spark plasma sintering or hot press sintering.
4. Conclusions
We report here the synthesis of Ag-doped CuS nanocomposites made of hexagonal nanodisks of CuS by a simple polyol method. In the thermopower and Hall resistivity data, we observe a signature of a structural phase transition at 55 K. The S and RH results reveal that they are p-type semiconductors and ρ shows metallic conduction. Due to nanostructuring, the S data at 300 K show nearly thrice the value of the single crystalline counterpart. The lattice thermal conductivity dominates over electronic thermal conductivity for all samples, which shows the importance of nanostructuring. With a systematic reduction in the thermal conductivity with increasing Ag-doping, a 50% enhancement in the thermoelectric figure of merit for Cu0.9Ag0.1S at 300 K as compared to that of pure CuS was obtained. These results therefore are likely to excite researchers for future courses of action in improving ZT near 300 K.
