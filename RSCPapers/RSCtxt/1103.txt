    , Accepted 1st June 2020First published on 2nd June 2020AbstractFinding effective molecular design strategies to enable efficient charge generation and small energy loss is among the long-standing challenges in developing high performance non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs). Recently, we reported Y-series non-fullerene acceptors with an electron-deficient-core-based fused structure (typically Y6), opening a new door to achieve high external quantum efficiency (∼80%) while maintaining low energy loss (∼0.57 eV). On this basis, further reducing the energy losses and ultimately improving the performance of OSCs has become a research hotspot. In this paper, we design and synthesize a new member of the Y-series acceptor family, Y18, which adopts a fused benzotriazole segment with unique luminescence properties as its electron-deficient core. Compared to Y6, the benzotriazole-based acceptor Y18 exhibits extended optical absorption and higher voltage. Consequently, the device delivers a promising power conversion efficiency of 16.52% with a very low energy loss of 0.53 eV. Further device optimization by exploiting a ternary blend strategy allowed us to achieve a high efficiency of 17.11% (certified as 16.76% by NREL). Y18 may become one of the most important candidate materials for its broader absorption spectra and higher voltage of Y18 (compared to Y6) in the OSCs field.

Broader context
Recently, various non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged and have greatly promoted the development of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the discovery of Y-series molecules, such as Y6, is pushing the OSCs field to new horizons; these molecules have enhanced the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to over 17%. Although the structure design of the benzothiadiazole (BT)-based molecule Y6 has had great success, the performance of Y-series molecules still has much room for improvement. In this work, we propose a simple molecular design strategy in which we replaced the BT unit of Y6 with a benzotriazole (BTA) unit to synthesize a new A–DA′D–A type NFA, Y18. The BTA-based acceptor Y18 showed a redshift of ca. 30 nm in its optical absorption onset and a nearly 80 meV upshift in its HOMO level compared to the BT-based acceptor Y6. As a direct consequence, an improved PCE of 16.52% with a decreased ΔEloss of 0.53 eV was achieved in a Y18-based device. In addition, by incorporating PC71BM into the host Y18 binary system, a PCE of 17.11% was achieved, which is one of the highest PCE values obtained for ternary OSCs to date. This work shows that ΔEloss can be further reduced by structural modification of the A′ unit in A–DA′D–A type molecules.

Introduction
In the last few decades, considerable progress has been made in the development of bulk-heterojunction structure-based organic solar cells (OSCs).1–8 As an impressive and promising renewable energy technique, OSCs have particular advantages, such as potentially low cost materials and processes, light weight, flexibility, semi-transparency and large-area manufacturing.9–15 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs still lag behind those of inorganic solar cells, such as silicon-based solar cells, which are presently dominating the photovoltaic market.16–18 In organic semiconductors, the absorption of incident photons yields excitons—i.e. electron–hole pairs bound by strong Coulomb forces.5,19–21 The dissociation of the exciton, which occurs at the donor/acceptor interfaces, requires an additional “driving force”, namely the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy offsets between the donor and acceptor materials; this leads to high energy losses ΔEloss (defined by the difference between the optical bandgap and the open-circuit voltage, i.e. ΔEloss = Eoptg − qVoc) in OSCs.22–24
For a long period, OSCs mainly employed fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM) as acceptor materials, with ΔEloss around 0.80 eV or higher. Meanwhile, this so-called ΔEloss can be as low as 0.30 eV in GaAs and only slightly larger in c-Si and organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells (0.40–0.55 eV).23,25–28 Recently, rapid progress in non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has provided effective ways to improve the performance of OSCs because of their tunable energy levels, strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, and tunable planarity and crystallinity.6,29–33 Moreover, replacing traditional fullerene acceptors by NFAs in OSCs has shown promise in reducing ΔEloss.34–36 One reason for this is that efficient charge separation can still occur in NFAs-based OSCs, with small energetic offsets between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donors and acceptors. However, although the energy offset driving force of charge transfer from a molecular exciton on the absorbing species toward the formation of an interfacial charge transfer state between donor and acceptor can be reduced to a very small (or nearly negligible) value, the overall ΔEloss from the optical gap to the open-circuit voltage still has a high value of about 0.6 eV.24,37–39 Therefore, it is still necessary to further reduce ΔEloss in OSCs through designing new polymer donors or new non-fullerene acceptors.22,39–41
In very recent work, we reported a new NFA, Y1, based on the A–DA′D–A molecular configuration (where A and D represent an electron-withdrawing moiety and an electron-donor moiety, respectively). The Y1-based OSCs achieved high external quantum efficiency (EQEPV) (∼75%) while maintaining low ΔEloss (∼0.57 eV). One of the most important features in the molecular design strategy for Y1 is introducing a weak electron-withdrawing moiety of a 2-ethylhexyl-benzo[d]-[1,2,3]-triazole segment in the middle of the central core to form a fused DA′D structure.3,42 This molecular design strategy is based on our previous reported A–DA′D–A type molecule BZIC.43 As a result, Y1 can not only tune the HOMO energy level to match a high-performance donor but can also help enhance the electroluminescence yield of the single components.3 Moreover, Y1 also has the advantage of versatile application in OSCs (such as tandem, ternary and flexible devices)44,45 due to the unique optical and electrical characteristics of A–DA′D–A-type molecules. More importantly, the discovery of Y-series molecules, such as Y6, is pushing the OSCs field to new horizons; these molecules have enhanced the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to over 15%. Although the molecular design of Y6 has achieved great success, the performance of A–DA′D–A-type acceptors still has much room for improvement.3,6
Along these lines, to design a high-performance Y-series acceptor, the first task is to control the ionization energy of its fused central core, which has an impact on the energy level and the bandgap of the target molecule. Specifically, upon replacing the benzothiadiazole unit of Y6 with a benzotriazole unit, the electron-accepting ability of the triazole is reduced compared with that of the thiadiazole-based unit. The lone pair on the middle nitrogen atom of the triazole unit is more basic than the lone pairs on the sulfur of the thiadiazole; thus, it is more easily donated into the triazole ring.46 A new benzotriazole-core-based NFA acceptor, Y18, consisting of a 6,12,13-tris(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-dihexyl-12,13-dihydro-6H-thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]-thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2g]thieno-[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b][1,2,3]-triazolo[4,5-e]indole group with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile, was synthesized for photovoltaic applications. The benzotriazole-based acceptor Y18 shows a redshift of ca. 30 nm in its optical absorption onset and a nearly 80 meV upshift in its HOMO level (measured by cyclic voltammetry) compared to that of the benzothiadiazole-based acceptor Y6. As a direct consequence, an improved PCE of 16.52% with a significantly decreased Eloss of 0.53 eV was achieved in a Y18-based device using PM6 (the chemical structure and molecular weight are shown in Fig. S6, ESI†) as a polymer donor.47 In addition, by incorporating PC71BM into the host Y18 binary system, a higher PCE of 17.11% was achieved. One of our best ternary devices was certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under asymptotic scans, and a PCE of 16.76% was achieved.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route of Y18 is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Compound 3 was synthesized with 75% yield through the Stille coupling reaction of tributyl(6-hexylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane (Compound 1) and 4,7-dibromo-2-(2-ethylhexyl)-5,6-dinitro-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]-triazole (Compound 2) using Pd(pph3)4 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent. The fused central core (Compound 4) was obtained by the double intramolecular Cadogan reductive cyclization of Compound 3 in the presence of triethyl phosphate, followed by the addition of 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane under alkaline conditions. Treating Compound 4 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) at −78 °C, followed by addition of N-formyl piperidine, afforded the key formulate dinitro-intermediate (Compound 5). Finally, the target molecule Y18 was obtained with over 70% yield by the Knoevenagel condensation of Compound 5 and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile. The structure of Y18 was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (NMR) (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). Y18 can be easily dissolved in common solvents such as chloroform (>40 mg mL−1), chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The thermal properties of Y18 were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), Y18 possesses good thermal stability, with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 338 °C under nitrogen atmosphere; this indicates that the thermal stability of Y18 is sufficient for application in OSCs.
Absorption spectra and molecular energy levels
The absorption spectra of Y18 in solution (chloroform) and in thin films at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. S7 (ESI†). Compared to the solution absorption spectrum, an 84 nm redshift can be observed in the film, indicating strong aggregation in the solid state. From the thin films in Fig. 1b, the Y18 film displays a strong absorption from 600 nm to 950 nm with a maximum absorption peak at 848 nm, which is redshifted by ca. 30 nm compared with that of the Y6 film. The Eoptg of the Y18 film (1.31 eV), calculated from its thin-film absorption onset at 945 nm, is 0.02 eV smaller than that of Y6.

The molecular energy levels of the PM6, Y6 and Y18 films were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) as an internal reference. As shown in Fig. 2c, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels for Y18 (the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry results are shown in Fig. S10, ESI†) were estimated to be −5.58 and −3.91 eV, respectively, which are 0.08 eV and 0.17 eV higher than those of Y6 (−5.66 and −4.08 eV); this is probably due to the fact that the electron-accepting ability of the triazole is lower than that of the thiadiazole. This is because the lone pair on the middle nitrogen atom of the triazole unit is more basic than the lone pair on the sulfur of the thiadiazole. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor polymer (PM6) were also estimated to be −5.55 and −3.60 eV, respectively, from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of PM6:Y18, together with that of PM6:Y6 (the molecular structure of the donor PM6 is shown in Fig. S6, ESI†) for comparison, were studied by bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs with an inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S6 (ESI†), Y18 and Y6 molecular structures consist of the same end groups, while Y18 adopts a fused benzotriazole as its central core. Fig. 2a shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding photovoltaic data are shown in Table 1. As a reference, the PM6:Y6 system with an optimized blend ratio of 1:1.2 showed a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 25.2 mA cm−2 and an FF of 76.1% (PCE = 15.7%), where the active layer was fabricated from chloroform solution with 0.5% vol% chloronaphthalene (CN) solvent additive by annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the OSC based on PM6:Y18 with a 1:1.5 weight ratio in the as-cast blend showed the best performance, with a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 23.86 mA cm−2, FF of 64.4% and PCE of 13.36% (the performance of PM6:Y18 with different ratios is included in Table S1, ESI†). Compared with the PM6:Y6 system, the PM6:Y18-based devices under the optimized conditions with CN additive and thermal annealing treatment exhibited a higher Voc of 0.84 V and FF of 76.48%; this resulted in an increased PCE of 16.52%. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the OSCs were investigated to explore the spectral responses of the devices. As shown in Fig. 2b, the device based on PM6:Y18 showed a broad EQE spectrum in the wavelength range of 300–950 nm, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum of the PM6:Y18 blend film (Fig. S8, ESI†). With the CN additive and thermal annealing in the active layer, the maximum EQE value reached about 80% from 520 nm to 850 nm. The Jsc values calculated from integration of the EQE data with the AM 1.5G solar spectra were 23.86 and 25.33 mA cm−2 for the OSCs based on PM6:Y18 without or with blend optimization, respectively, which are in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. The Y18-based device yielded a higher Voc than the Y6-based device; this suggests that ΔEloss decreased to some extent, as the EQE spectrum of the Y18-based device was redshifted compared to that of the Y6-based device (Fig. S9, ESI†).

To further study the influence of the thermal annealing and additives on the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes for the Y18-based OSCs, the exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) were calculated. The photocurrent density (Jph, defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) versus the effective voltage (Veff, defined as V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero) for the OSCs based on PM6:Y18 without and with device optimization were measured to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties. Generally, at high Veff (>2 V), Jph becomes saturated, indicating that almost all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated and that the generated free charge carriers are collected by the electrodes. The charge dissociation and charge collection probability in the devices can be estimated by calculating the value of Jph/Veff under their short-current and maximal power output conditions. As shown in Fig. 2c, the values were calculated to be 94.8% and 97.1% for the devices without and with device optimization, respectively. To further study the charge recombination behaviour of the OSCs, the dependence of Jsc as a function of the light intensity (P) was studied and modelled with the equation Jsc ∝ Pα. If all free charge carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, α tends to approach the limit 1. For the OSCs with solvent and thermal-annealing treatment, α = 0.995, which is slightly higher than that of the as-cast devices (α = 0.990); this suggests negligible bimolecular charge recombination in the PM6:Y18-based devices. Furthermore, the space charge limited current (SCLC)48 method was used to determine the charge carrier mobilities of the Y18-based blend film (Fig. S11, ESI†). For the as-cast PM6:Y18 blend films, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) are 4.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. For the blend films with CN and thermal annealing, μh and μe increased to 5.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher and more balanced mobility ratio (μh/μe = 1.1) in the optimized blend film is responsible for its higher Jsc and FF.
Energy loss analysis
The photovoltaic optical energy bandgaps (EPVg) of the optimized PM6:Y6 and PM6:Y18 blend films were obtained as 1.40 eV and 1.38 eV, respectively, directly from the derivative of the edge of the EQE spectra of their OSCs (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†), as reported in the literature.49 The Y18-based device has a very low ΔEloss of 0.53 eV (EPVg − qVoc), which is lower than that of the Y6-based device (0.58 eV). Comparing the photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs based on PM6:Y18 and PM6:Y6, Voc contributes significantly to the improved PCE of the Y18-based devices. The low ΔEloss of the Y18-based device motivated us to analyse the ΔEloss from the different components. It is well accepted that the ΔEloss of solar cells can be divided into three components (Eloss = Egap − qVoc = (Egap − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc)).22,23,49 The qVSQoc in this equation is the maximum voltage based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, where the EQEpv is assumed to be stepwise (no photovoltaic EQE or absorption is present below the optical gap of the cell). According to the SQ limit, the qVSQoc values for the systems based on PM6:Y18 with or without (w/wo) device optimization are 1.11 and 1.12 V, respectively. The first term of (Egap − qVSQoc) is due to radiative recombination originating from the absorption above the bandgap with a value of 0.27 eV, which is unavoidable for any kind of solar cell. The second term of (qVSQoc − qVradoc, qΔVrad,belowgapoc) is due to additional radiative recombination from the absorption below the bandgap. Compared with inorganic or perovskite solar cells, this value is usually quite high for OSCs. The large qΔVrad,belowgapoc in the OSCs is due to the existence of charge-transfer (CT) states (this term is mainly due to the loss during the CT process). As mentioned in our previous result, the A–DA′D–A type molecule Y1 did not show a clear CT absorption feature or a CT emission feature, which is usually obvious for a donor and the acceptor with significant energetic offset, by measuring the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectra (FTPS) and the electroluminescence (EL) spectra. We consider that this is due to the small ionization energy (HOMO) offset (0.06 eV) between the donor and acceptor. The absorption edge of PM6:Y18 is steeper compared with those with CT features, even for the pristine Y18 (Fig. 3a), which is quite unique because the D:A blend films are usually assumed to have more disordered interfaces than pristine acceptor films. Thus, as displayed in Table 2, the radiative losses (ΔVrad,belowgapoc) of the device based on PM6:Y18 also showed a low value (0.04 eV). The third loss term (qVradoc − qVoc, qΔVnon-radoc = −kTln(EQEEL)) is due to non-radiative recombination, where EQEEL (EL quantum efficiency) is the radiative quantum efficiency of the solar cell when charge carriers are injected into the device in the dark. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Y18-based devices exhibit high EQEEL values with magnitudes of 10−4, and the calculated non-radiative losses (qΔVnon-radoc) are 0.23 eV and 0.21 eV for the OSCs based on PM6:Y18 w/wo optimization. The drop of EQEEL and increase of Jsc in the optimized devices may be related to the interfacial molecular orientation change from face-on, which has less non-radiative recombination, to edge-on, which has more efficient charge generation. However, the EQEEL after optimization is still very high among OSCs. Compared with the star material Y6, which appears frequently in recent reports regarding high-performance OSCs, the blend film with Y18 is more emissive and causes a smaller non-radiative loss (Fig. S14, ESI†). The low non-radiative losses may be due to the synergistic effect of the A–DA′D–A-type molecular configurations and the unique luminescence properties of the benzotriazole-based unit. We observed no clear differences between the absorption and emission characteristics of the pristine Y18 and Y18 blend films; this implies that the energy difference between the local-exciton (LE) state and the CT state is very small, which is consistent with a very small HOMO offset (0.03 eV). As reported recently, the CT state and LE state with low offset may form hybridization, which allows us to explain the low non-radiative loss by the increase in the effective CT to the ground state oscillator strength due to the intensity borrowing mechanism.40 Due to the strong interaction between the CT and LE states, the three-state vibronic model considering the interaction between CT and LE may be a better way to rationalize the low non-radiative loss.

Morphologies of the OSC active layers
The morphologies of the active layers of the Y18-based OSCs were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). In the AFM images (Fig. S15, ESI†), the root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of the PM6:Y18 blend film under optimal conditions is 1.22 nm. Additionally, the TEM images can be used to explore the nanoscale morphologies of the Y18 blend films under the same conditions (Fig. S15, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S16c (ESI†), the neat Y18 film shows a strong out-of-plane (OOP) π–π stacking peak with a (010) π–π diffraction at 1.68 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.73 Å) and a (100) diffraction at 0.43 Å−1 (d-spacing: 14.68 Å). The neat PM6 film also shows face-on and edge-on orientation, with a (100) diffraction at 0.29 Å−1 (d-spacing: 21.78 Å) in the in-plane direction and a π–π stacking (010) diffraction at 1.63 Å−1 (d-spacing: 3.86 Å) in the OOP direction (Fig. S16d, ESI†). For the blend film, the two different (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction arose from the donor and acceptor, respectively, and the (010) peak in the OOP diffraction was a simple combination of the (010) reflections of both the donor and acceptor. Compared with the as-cast film, the optimized film shows stronger crystallinity with a larger π–π stacking distance, and the peak at 1.65 Å−1 in the OOP direction is sharper than that of the as-cast film; this could also be observed in the 2D GIWAXS patterns (Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S16–S18, ESI†). On the other hand, the PM6:Y18 blend films contain more molecules stacked regularly in the OOP direction compared with PM6:Y6 (as shown in Fig. S19, ESI,† which may provide more channels for charge transfer and leads to better performance).

Ternary OSCs with PC71BM as the third component
As reported recently, fullerene derivatives in Y6-based OSCs play a critical role as a third component to further improve the photovoltaic performance.50,51 PC71BM can not only disperse acceptor aggregates but can also provide efficient electron mobility and balanced charge carriers.50 One can therefore consider adding PC71BM to the PM6:Y18 binary system to further enhance the device performance. By introducing PC71BM into the PM6:Y18 film, a much smoother surface is seen for the ternary film, with an Rq of 0.81 nm. Accordingly, a slightly more uniform TEM image can be observed, as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), indicating that PC71BM is beneficial in driving better bicontinuous morphology. Furthermore, it can be seen from the GIWAXS diagrams in Fig. 4c and Fig. S17 (ESI†) that after adding PC71BM to the blend film, the ternary blend film shows similar π–π stacking distances and a slightly decreased crystal size. Although binary OSCs based on PM6:Y18 can achieve high efficiencies, more homogeneous fine film morphologies with suitable phase separation can be observed after the addition of PC71BM.
By carefully optimizing the ratio of PM6:Y18:PC71BM (1:1.5:0.2), we achieved a high PCE of up to 17.11% with a higher Jsc of 26.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.84 V and FF of 77.4% (Fig. 4d and Tables S2 or S3, ESI†). The increased current density of the ternary OSC can be ascribed to its lower EQE spectral response from 680 nm to 850 nm (Fig. 4e). To carefully evaluate the high PCE, we sent our best ternary devices to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under asymptotic scans for 670.1 s. An efficiency of 16.76% was certified, with Voc of 0.836 V, Jsc of 25.82 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.7% (Fig. 4f or Fig. S19, ESI†). The certification efficiency under max power point (MPP) output is quite consistent with our own measured value based on the I–V characteristics, which indicates that the stress stability of the ternary blend device is outstanding. The device still retains 93% of its initial efficiency after 25 days of storage, and the data are shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new A–DA′D–A type organic molecule with benzotriazole as the A′ core unit, Y18, and investigated it as the acceptor component in OSCs in comparison with Y6 as a control acceptor. Based on the experimental results from the absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry, we determined that the benzotriazole-based acceptor Y18 exhibits extended optical absorption and a higher LUMO level. When Y18 was blended with the polymer donor PM6, the device produced a high PCE of 16.52%. The high performance was enabled by the relatively high EQEEL values with magnitudes of 10−4, and the calculated non-radiative losses are 0.23 eV and 0.21 eV for the OSCs based on PM6:Y18 blend films with and without CN solvent additive and thermal annealing optimization. The low non-radiative losses may be due to the synergistic effect of the A–DA′D–A-type molecular configuration and the unique luminescence properties of the benzotriazole-based unit. Further device optimization by exploiting a ternary blend strategy allowed us to achieve a high efficiency of 17.11% (certified as 16.76% by NREL). Our work provides an opportunity to further reduce ΔEloss (mainly non-radiative energy loss) by structural modification of the Y6 molecule. We believe that Y18 will become another important acceptor material for OSCs.

Broader context
Recently, various non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have emerged and have greatly promoted the development of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the discovery of Y-series molecules, such as Y6, is pushing the OSCs field to new horizons; these molecules have enhanced the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs to over 17%. Although the structure design of the benzothiadiazole (BT)-based molecule Y6 has had great success, the performance of Y-series molecules still has much room for improvement. In this work, we propose a simple molecular design strategy in which we replaced the BT unit of Y6 with a benzotriazole (BTA) unit to synthesize a new A–DA′D–A type NFA, Y18. The BTA-based acceptor Y18 showed a redshift of ca. 30 nm in its optical absorption onset and a nearly 80 meV upshift in its HOMO level compared to the BT-based acceptor Y6. As a direct consequence, an improved PCE of 16.52% with a decreased ΔEloss of 0.53 eV was achieved in a Y18-based device. In addition, by incorporating PC71BM into the host Y18 binary system, a PCE of 17.11% was achieved, which is one of the highest PCE values obtained for ternary OSCs to date. This work shows that ΔEloss can be further reduced by structural modification of the A′ unit in A–DA′D–A type molecules.
