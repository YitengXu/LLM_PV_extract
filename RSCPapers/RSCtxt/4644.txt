    , Accepted 31st January 2017First published on 10th February 2017AbstractWe present the synthesis and characterization of a series of A–D–A–D–A-type co-oligomers, comprising dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) moieties as the electron donor, and thieno[2,3-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) or benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTDA) as the central and dicyanovinyl (DCV) groups as the terminal acceptor units. Furthermore, hexylsubstituted bithiophenes were introduced for the elongation of the π-conjugated backbone. The influence of the core acceptor moieties as well as the elongation of the π-system were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The novel co-oligomers were used as the donor material in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJSC) in combination with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the acceptor. The devices exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 5.0% after optimization of the photoactive blend layers by solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The influence and effect of the solvent vapor on the photoactive layer was investigated by solid state absorption spectroscopy and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements.
Introduction
The field of organic solar cells comprising structurally precise molecular donors as p-type semiconductors has undergone tremendous progress due to the versatility of the synthetic routes to develop new materials on one hand and the advancement in device preparation and architecture on the other hand.1–4 Compared to high-performance polymers,5,6 the major advantages of oligomeric materials include their high purity and the absence of batch-to-batch variations.7,8 Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of conjugated oligomer-based solar cells have now reached the 10%-threshold for single-junction devices.9–13 This progress was possible due to the preparation of a large spectrum of high performance molecular donor materials using tailored building blocks that led to the optimization of optoelectronic properties, interfacial processes, control over the active layer morphology, and processing conditions for solar cell fabrication.
Generally, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells (BHJSC) are fabricated at mild temperatures allowing effective optimization methods, such as thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing (SVA), dual thermal-solvent annealing, and additive treatment. On the other hand, for the development of efficient donor materials various strategies for the modification of the key components of the molecular structure such as donor (D) and acceptor (A) units, conjugated bridges, or alkyl chain substitution patterns have come into range. So far, the electron-deficient, fused-heterocycle benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BTDA) is frequently implemented as acceptor moiety in polymeric or oligomeric donors.14–20 Furthermore, fluorinated or alkoxy-substituted BTDA units have been developed leading to novel donor materials for BHJSCs showing promising PCEs over 9%.21–25 Another electron-deficient unit is represented by thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), which has been implemented into co-polymers used in BHJSCs.26–28 The TPD group can enforce backbone co-planarity via intramolecular thienyl (S)–carbonyl (O) interactions29 leading to close π–π stacking in the solid state. The solubility and film microstructure were fine-tuned through alkylation of the imide nitrogen. Indeed, some TPD-containing co-polymers utilized as donor materials in BHJSCs exhibited PCEs of up to 8.5%.30,31 Recently, we have connected TPD as a terminal acceptor to dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as a central donor leading to a structurally defined A–D–A-type co-oligomer, which achieved PCEs in excess of 2.6% in solution-processed BHJSCs.32,33
In this article, we report synthesis and characterization of extended A–D–A–D–A-type co-oligomers 1–4 (Fig. 1) and their implementation as donor materials in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar cells. The molecular design concept utilized DTP units as electron-donating moieties, TPD or BTDA as the core, and DCV as the terminal acceptor groups, respectively. We have further incorporated regioregular hexylsubstituted bithiophene units in order to extend the π-conjugation length of the co-oligomers and to enhance the solubility imposed by the alkyl side chains. Photovoltaic devices prepared by using the novel co-oligomers as the donor and PC61BM as the acceptor achieved PCEs reaching 5.0%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic pathway to co-oligomers 1 and 2 started with the preparation of 2,8-dibromo-5-octylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,34,35 4,7-dibromobenzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole,36 and N-(2-hexyldecyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole8 according to literature-known procedures. DTP was firstly mono-stannylated at the 2-position using n-butyl lithium and trimethyltin chloride to yield 5. Then, the dibrominated acceptor units Br2-TPD 6 and Br2-BTDA 7 were coupled with monostannyl-DTP 5 in a Stille cross-coupling reaction to obtain the D–A–D building blocks 8 and 9 in 95% and 87% yield, respectively. In order to obtain co-oligomers 1 and 2, the intermediate D–A–D derivatives 8 and 9 were formylated at the terminal α-positions via a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction and dialdehydes 10 and 11 were obtained in 73% and 91% yield, respectively. Subsequent Knoevenagel condensation of 10 and 11 with malononitrile rendered co-oligomer 1 in 73% and 2 in 94% yield (Scheme 1).

The syntheses of elongated co-oligomers 3 and 4, which comprise additional hexylbithiophene spacers, are shown in Scheme 2. The previously synthesized TPD and BTDA-containing D–A–D precursors 8 and 9 were brominated at the terminal position with NBS to yield 12 and 13 in 84% and 92% yield, respectively. The dihalogenated D–A–D block 12 comprising the TPD core was coupled with stannylated bithiophene 14 under Stille-coupling conditions to give the extended D–A–D block 15 in 70% yield. Subsequently, 15 was firstly formylated by a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction in 98% yield, followed by Knoevenagel condensation with malononitrile to afford co-oligomer 3 in 92% yield. In order to synthesize co-oligomer 4, dihalogenated derivative 13 comprising the BTDA core was functionalized through a Pd-catalyzed stannylation of the free α-positions using hexabutylditin with a yield of 90%. The bistannylated derivative 17 was coupled with DCV-substituted bromobithiophene3718 to obtain co-oligomer 4 in 60% yield. The route for co-oligomer 3 included more steps, because it was impossible to stannylate TPD dibromo derivative 12 and to react the stannyl with bromobithiophene 18 as it was the case for the corresponding BTDA derivative 17.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of co-oligomers 1–4 were obtained in chloroform at room temperature and in neat films (Fig. 2) and the data are listed in Table 1. The solution spectrum of 1 exhibited a well-structured absorption band with a maximum at 600 nm including vibronic shoulders at 562 nm, 493 nm, and 405 nm. The molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 120000 M−1 cm−1 was the highest in this series. The vibrational splitting and the high ε are strong hints for a high coplanarity of co-oligomer 1 which is presumably caused by intramolecular oxygen (O)–sulfur (S) interactions. In solution, co-oligomer 2 also gave a structured absorption spectrum with bands at 485 nm, 597 nm, and 624 nm. The donor–acceptor charge transfer (CT) absorption band is located at 600 nm for 1 and at 597 nm for 2. One significant structural difference of both oligomers is the core acceptor, among which BTDA has a higher acceptor strength compared to TPD. As a consequence, the absorption band is red-shifted by approximately 24 nm from 600 nm for 1 to 624 nm for 2. The ε for co-oligomer 2 is 78900 M−1 cm−1, which is much lower compared to 1 and is ascribed to the lack of planarization in the molecule. In comparison to the solution spectra, the thin-film absorption spectra of 1 and 2 are broadened covering a range from 400 to almost 780 nm. The absorption maxima are at 588 nm for 1 and at 722 nm for 2. The sharp and structured absorption profile of 2 in the solid-state also suggests that 2 tends to form more extended aggregates than 1. The optical gaps (Eoptg) of 1 and 2 in neat films were 1.60 eV and 1.59 eV, respectively, which are smaller compared to those in solution (1.87 eV for 1 and 1.75 eV for 2). The decrease in the optical gap, as well as the strong bathochromic shift of the absorption in the solid state is caused by increased intermolecular interactions in thin films.

As presented in Fig. 2b the absorption spectra of co-oligomers 3 and 4 in solution afforded featureless absorption bands from 350–750 nm with maxima at 580 nm (ε = 83300 M−1 cm−1) for 3 and at 632 nm (ε = 70300 M−1 cm−1) for 4. The lowering of the ε values for 3 and 4 compared to 1 and 2 further suggests the higher flexibility of the molecular backbone caused by the introduction of the additional hexylsubstituted bithiophene units. The film absorption maxima of both co-oligomers were red-shifted by ∼120 nm compared to the corresponding solution spectra. The optical gaps in the solid state for 3 and 4 were determined to 1.53 eV and 1.42 eV, respectively, which are about 0.25 eV lower compared to the gaps determined from solution spectra. The reason for the smaller band gap of 3 and 4 compared to the shorter counterparts 1 and 2 obviously comes from the longer conjugated backbone, because the acceptor moieties remained unchanged.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of co-oligomers 1–4 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile with tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. Due to the difficulty in obtaining well-defined cyclic voltammograms in dichloromethane or in tetrachloroethane solution at 80 °C, the redox potentials were determined from films of the co-oligomers which were drop-cast from hot chloroform solutions onto the platinum working electrode. The measured redox potentials and the frontier orbital energy levels of the co-oligomers determined from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction wave are presented in Table 2. Although the absolute values of the electrochemical gap (ECVg) are higher compared to the optical gap in films, the trend in both cases is the same, i.e., ECVg decreases going from the shorter co-oligomers 1 and 2 to the more extended 3 and 4. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels are illustrated in Fig. 3 and compared to the LUMO energy level of PC61BM.

Photovoltaic performance
Solution-processed BHJSCs were fabricated by doctor-blading co-oligomers 1–4 as donor (D) and PC61BM as the acceptor (A). All active layers were deposited from TCE solutions at temperatures between 80–100 °C. The standard device architecture was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1–4:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The device performance of each co-oligomer was optimized with respect to the D:A ratios, solvents for solvent vapor annealing (SVA) as well as SVA times. It has been shown earlier that the device performance has been significantly improved upon SVA treatment of the active layer.8,39–43 The device characteristics for the best-performing solar cells for 1–4 before and after SVA are shown in Fig. 4a and the data are summarized in Table 3. The trend in the HOMO energy levels of oligomers 1–4 is clearly reflected in the VOC values of the untreated devices. The VOC value is constantly decreasing through the series from 1.05 V for 1 (EHOMO = −5.83 eV) to 0.59 V for 4 (EHOMO = −5.28 eV).

SVA has a positive impact on the photovoltaic performance of all co-oligomers in the series. This is mainly due to an increase in JSC and fill factor (FF) which resulted in an improved efficiency. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) or chloroform (CF) was used as the SVA solvent. For TPD-containing co-oligomer 1, the PCE was increased almost twofold from 0.8% to 1.52% after exposing the active layer to chloroform vapor for 30 s. This improvement is ascribed to an increase in JSC by 1.21 mA cm−2 and FF by 0.08. The VOC, however, decreased by 0.06 V. In the case of co-oligomer 2 comprising the BTDA core-acceptor, PCE was also increased twofold from 0.82 to 1.59% upon SVA with THF for 30 s resulting mainly from the enhancement of JSC (1.24 mA cm−2) and FF (0.07) values. No further improvement was observed for both oligomers 1 and 2 by changing the SVA solvent or longer SVA treatment times.
For the extended co-oligomer 3 with a TPD central acceptor unit a PCE of 1.75% was measured before SVA with a JSC of 4.6 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.52. For SVA, both CF and THF, were tested. The SVA duration was increased stepwise from 15 s to 120 s. During the treatment with CF, no changes in the color of the active layer were observed. However, an improvement in PCE from 1.75% for the untreated cell to 2.70% was observed already after 15 s of annealing. The best performing cell was obtained after 30 s of SVA treatment displaying a good JSC value of 10.1 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.50 resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in PCE to 4.42%. The photovoltaic performance is presented in Fig. S1† and the results are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
Although the SVA with CF was very successful, the devices were further tested using THF as the SVA solvent (Fig. S2, Table S2†). Surprisingly, for almost all annealing times the PCE of the cells annealed with THF were lower compared to SVA with CF except for annealing times of 45 s to 60 s. The best device was obtained after 45 s SVA, where the PCE was well improved to 5.03% due to a 2.5 fold increase in JSC from 4.6 to 11.5 mA cm−2 and fill factor from 0.52 to 0.63. For other SVA times, the CF treated cells have shown superior performance compared to the cells treated with THF.
Co-oligomer 4, however, displayed a marginal improvement after SVA either with CF or THF. The JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE of the untreated device reached values of 6.3 mA cm−2, 0.58 V, 0.65, and 2.25%, respectively, giving the best results among the pristine solar cell series. The best performing solar cell displayed an efficiency of 2.34% (JSC = 6.34 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.60 V, and FF = 0.62) upon 60 s SVA treatment with CF. When THF was used for SVA the best device exhibited a PCE of 2.32% after 15 s annealing. All photovoltaic parameters for co-oligomer 4 linearly decreased with increasing SVA time indicating that the morphology of the active layer is optimal before SVA treatment and any further domain growth initiated by solvent vapors has a negative impact on the device performance.
Finally, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best performing devices of co-oligomers 1–4 are presented in Fig. 4b. The EQE of the shorter co-oligomers 1 and 2 did not exceed 17%, but showed a good coverage of the solar spectrum. The EQE of the extended co-oligomer 4 displayed the largest coverage of the solar spectrum reaching over 850 nm. A prominent feature of that particular EQE curve was the fact that the acceptor PC61BM seemed to contribute to the generated photocurrent more than the actual donor molecule. The EQE of the best-performing molecule 3 reached up to 55%. The calculated current density values were well in accordance with the J–V measurements by the solar simulator.
To summarize these results, the photovoltaic parameters before and after SVA are compared as graphical view in Fig. 5. These results notably showed the potential of how poorly soluble co-oligomers can also be processed via doctor-blading. Finally, it can be stated that this processing technique is a very good alternative to spin-coating. Another important fact was the large potential of SVA as a rather simple, but very effective optimization technique. In the series, the VOC of the devices decreased with increasing HOMO energy levels. The increases in JSC of the devices from 1 to 4 are in accordance with the red-shifted absorption in the respective UV-vis spectrum. The SVA process however stayed unpredictable. For the shorter co-oligomers SVA seemed to work rather superficial since no change in the absorption profile of the active layer was detected after annealing. The most prominent response to SVA came from 3 where a significant increase in JSC was observed which should be due to a significant change in the active layer morphology. However, no improvement was observed for co-oligomer 4 after SVA treatment.
 Fig. 5  Variation of photovoltaic parameters (PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF) for co-oligomers 1–4 before and after SVA treatment. 
As pointed out above, the large increase in JSC and PCE of 3-based solar cells upon SVA treatment had to be derived from significant morphological changes in the active layer. Measurements of the solid-state absorption of the corresponding blend layers before and after the SVA treatment confirmed the presence of detectable changes in the active layer morphology (Fig. 6). Untreated blend layers with identical composition and thickness as in the respective solar cells exhibited a strong absorption band at ∼380 nm, which was ascribed to the solid state absorption of PC61BM, whereas the absorption bands between 550 and 850 nm were characteristic of co-oligomer 3. Upon exposure to THF vapor for 45 s, a distinct increase in this absorption region was observed and the concomitant appearance of a pronounced absorption shoulder at 745 nm, while the spectral shape below 550 nm remained almost unchanged. This behavior was attributed to increased intermolecular interactions between molecules 3 deriving from a more ordered packing of donor molecules upon SVA, as previously observed for similar blend compositions.8 However, for co-oligomers 1, 2, and 4 after SVA treatment, the absorption band increased in the whole visible region covering the absorption of PC61BM and the donor suggesting poor phase separation compared to co-oligomer 3 (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 6  (a) Thin-film absorption and (b) GIXRD plot of 3:PC61BM active layer before and after SVA with THF. 
These apparent changes in morphology were further analyzed via grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements of the 3:PC61BM blend layers before and after solvent vapor annealing. X-ray diffraction analyses of the untreated blend layers afforded a very sharp signal at a 2θ of 4.15° which was assigned to the donor crystallites in the blend (Fig. 6). The distance between the backbones of adjacent co-oligomer molecules was determined to be 22 Å (d001). The presence of the aforementioned crystallites indicated a certain degree of phase separation in the bulk-heterojunction with detectable donor-rich phases. The relatively low performance of 1.75% PCE deriving from a low JSC of 4.69 mA cm−2 and an FF of 52% was attributed to large recombination rates. Hence, the presence of donor crystallites alone does not result in a highly efficient solar cell. In addition to the mere presence of extended donor crystallites, the distribution as well as the connection of donor-rich phases play a crucial role for efficient solar cells. The signals obtained by the GIXRD measurements of the SVA-annealed blend layer exhibited the anticipated change in morphology showing reflexes at 4.0 and 7.6°. The additional signal at 7.6° was a strong indication of extended long-range ordering of the donor phases. A lamellar packing of the co-oligomers with a repeat distance of 22 Å was evident from the appearance of two reflections corresponding to 22 Å (d001) and 11 Å (d002). The appearance of the second order reflection reflects the improved long-range order upon SVA. Furthermore, a slight splitting of the recorded reflection at ∼4.0° and the tailing of the signal at 7.6° indicate a distribution of crystalline domains with variable spacing and packing properties with longer distances. In terms of the photovoltaic performance, this outcome was well in accordance with the improvement of JSC and FF, a clear indication of reduced recombination rates. Through the GIXRD analysis of the blend layers before and after SVA, it was shown that not only the presence of extended donor crystallites is of great importance, but also the long-range ordering thereof enabling an efficient transport of the generated charge carriers to the respective electrodes. The GIXRD plots of blend layers comprising co-oligomers 1, 2, and 4 did not show any detectable changes after SVA treatment which was well in accordance with the above shown UV-Vis spectra measured before and after annealing (Fig. S4†).
Conclusion
In summary, we have presented synthesis and optoelectronic characterization of a series of A–D–A–D–A co-oligomers 1–4 for application as donor materials in solution-processed BHJSCs. The influence of different core-acceptor moieties and the introduction of hexylbithiophene spacers were evaluated. Optical characterization of co-oligomers 1–4 revealed a steady red-shift of the absorption maxima in solution and in thin-films with a concomitant spectral broadening, which was attributed to the strength of the respective acceptor moieties and the extension of the π-conjugated system. Increasing HOMO energy levels directly correlated with the constant decrease of VOC from 1.05 to 0.58 V when going from 1 to 4. All co-oligomers exhibited a positive response towards optimization via SVA evidenced by enhanced JSC and FF values. After the SVA treatment, devices comprising 1 and 2 could achieve a twofold improvement of PCE from ∼0.8 to ∼1.6%. On the other hand, SVA had a strong effect on the performance of co-oligomer 3-based devices, the efficiency of which was significantly increased from 1.75 to 5.03% deriving from a significant increase of JSC and FF. However, for co-oligomer 4-based devices no change could be observed after SVA. The device performance was further correlated with the nanoscale morphology of the photoactive layers, which were analyzed by solid state absorption spectroscopy and GIXRD measurements. The results showed that the influence of SVA on 1, 2, and 4:PC61BM-blends was marginal with hardly detectable changes in the active layer morphology being well in accordance with the modest improvement of the respective device performance. The results of 3:PC61BM blends showed strong indication of morphological changes after SVA treatment. In this respect, a slight red-shift and a significant increase in the absorbance were observed in the donor regime, most probably deriving from enhanced intermolecular interactions of adjacent donor molecules due to higher order. GIXRD diffraction patterns showed the appearance of an additional reflex suggesting prominent long-range ordering of 3 crystallites in the photoactive layer after SVA proving the potential of this optimization method for future applications.

Mass spectra were recorded with a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS and with a MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Reflex III (trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as matrix). HR-MALDI-MS was performed on a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer solariX from Bruker Daltonics equipped with a 7.0 T superconducting magnet and interfaced to an Apollo II Dual ESI/MALDI source. Melting points of the intermediates were determined with a Büchi B-545 melting point apparatus and are not corrected. Gas chromatography was carried out using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph. HPLC analyses were performed on a Merck Hitachi L7000 equipped with a L7455 photodiode array detector, a L7200 autosampler and a L7100 solvent delivery system using a LiChrospher column (Nucleosil 100-5 NO2). Semi-preparative HPLC was performed on a Merck Hitachi 7000/Shimadzu CBM-20A equipped with a L7420/SPD-20A UV-vis detector and a L7150/LC-8A solvent delivery system using LiChrospher columns (Nucleosil 100-5-NO2). Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel 60 F254 aluminum plates (Merck). Solvents and reagents were purified and dried by usual methods prior to use and used under an inert gas atmosphere. THF, DCM, diethyl ether, DMF, and toluene were purified and dried in an encapsulated solvent purification system, MBRAUN MB SPS-800. Preparative column chromatography was carried out using various glass columns packed either with silica gel (MACHEREY-NAGEL MN Silica gel 60, particle size 0.063–0.2 mm) or flash silica gel (MACHEREY-NAGEL MN Silica gel 60 M, particle size 0.04–0.063 mm). The following starting materials were purchased and used without further purification: malononitrile (Aldrich), n-butyl lithium (Acros), trimethyltin chloride (Aldrich), phosphorus oxychloride (Merck), ammonium acetate (Merck), NBS (Merck), and hexabutylditin (Aldrich).
UV-vis spectra in chloroform solution and thin film were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single compartment cell (5 mL). The platinum working electrode consisted of a platinum wire sealed in a soft glass tube with a surface of A = 0.785 mm,2 which was polished down to 0.25 μm with Buehler polishing paste prior to use to guarantee reproducible surfaces. The counter electrode consisted of a platinum wire and the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. For the measurements, concentrations of 10−3 M of the electroactive species were used in freshly distilled and deaerated acetonitrile (Lichrosolv, Merck) and 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NPF6 (Fluka; recrystallized twice from ethanol). Diffraction patterns were measured using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with a fixed incoming angle of 0.2° and a Cu Kα source.
Device fabrication
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P, VP.AI 4083 solution from Heraeus) was bladed onto pre-cleaned, patterned ITO-coated glass from Naranjo Substrates (15 Ω cm−2) at 50 °C and 30–40 nm thick layers were obtained. Afterwards, the photoactive layer was doctor-bladed from a mixed solution loaded with the donor and PC61BM (Solenne BV). Thin layers of LiF (∼0.7 nm) and Al (∼150 nm) were then deposited by vacuum evaporation at pressures <2 × 10−6 Torr (Nano 36, Kurt J. Lesker Co.). The photoactive areas of the cells were 0.09 and 0.16 cm2. Solvent vapor annealing was carried out according to the literature.39J–V characteristics were measured with an Oriel Instruments solar simulator (class AAA, AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. EQE was measured under monochromatic light from a 300 W xenon lamp in combination with a monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 260), modulated with a mechanical chopper. The response was recorded as the voltage over a 220 Ω resistance, using a lock-in amplifier (Merlin 70104). A calibrated Si cell was used as the reference.

2,2′-(2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis[N-(2-hexyldecyl)-6-bromodithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole] (13). 
Precursor 9 (91.5 mg, 97.4 μmol, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in 10 mL absolute THF and cooled to −85 °C and NBS (35.8, 201 μmol, 2.1 eq.) was added before the mixture was stirred for 1 h at −85 °C under light exclusion. Then, the mixture was poured onto a short flash column (SiO2, 5:2 n-Hex/DCM). Then, the eluent was changed to pure DCM and another fraction was collected. As the column was flushed with pure EA, another band was collected. TLC of the last two fractions were combined to be purified again via flash chromatography (SiO2, 5:3 PE/DCM). Dibromide 13 (90.1 mg, 82.1 μmol) was isolated as a viscous purple liquid in 84% yield.
