    , Accepted 2nd March 2015First published on 10th March 2015AbstractMesoporous self-assembled cobalt oxide (Co3O4) of different shapes was synthesized by a facile soft-chemical process using cobalt nitrate, oxalic acid and phosphoric acid in the presence of cationic templates, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, and pyridinium bromide at 75 °C/2 h followed by calcination at 300 °C. The effect of cationic templates of the samples on the physico-chemical properties, and the photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of Chicago Sky Blue 6B was studied. Pyridinium bromide and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide facilitated formation of particles with different shaped morphology compared to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The rod-like particles having higher surface area exhibited higher photocatalytic performance.
1. Introduction
With the advancement of nanotechnology, controllable and selective synthesis of nanomaterials has attracted intense research interest due to their unique physical and chemical properties, which are significantly different from those of bulk materials.1,2 Morphological tuning of the materials is important because it influences different properties of the materials. Mesoporous nanomaterials with tuned morphology, in particular, are becoming more important for potential applications in catalysis, sensors, fuel cells, supercapacitors etc.3,4
Among the transition metal oxides, nanostructured tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4), a p-type semiconductor, finds widespread applications in chemical sensors,5 lithium-ion batteries,6 optical and magnetic materials,7,8 and heterogeneous catalysts,9 in which their properties are strongly dependent on their size and shape.10 The band gap of the semiconductor lies in the range of 1.9–2.0 eV. Thus it is capable of forming electron–hole pairs upon irradiation with visible light. In recent years, Co3O4 with various morphologies such as nanorods,11 nanowires,12 nanotubes,13 nanobelts,14 nanocubes,15 nanosheets16–18etc. have been synthesized successfully. Chen et al.19 prepared various cobalt-based nanostructured materials (nanocubes, nanodiscs and nanoflowers) by a hydrothermal method. These Co3O4 nanostructures have superior properties to their bulk counterparts in terms of heterogeneous catalysts for NOx reduction, CO oxidation,20 VOC removal21etc.
Visible light covers the largest proportion of the solar spectrum. Thus involvement of easily available, naturally gifted visible light in finding an alternative to energy and environmental issues is a topic of immense research interest.22 Suitable designing of photocatalysts has been focused to perform photocatalytic water splitting or degradation of water soluble organic pollutants under visible light irradiation. Efforts are devoted not only to improve the catalytic efficiency of TiO223 but also to synthesize other less costly visible-light-driven semiconductor composites24–26 and pure transition metal oxide27 catalysts. The photocatalytic role of Co3O4 has been reported by many researchers.28–31 Warang et al. showed the photocatalytic efficiency of Co3O4 for degradation of methylene blue via the photo-Fenton reaction.28 Photocatalytic degradation of methyl violet in the presence of Co3O4 catalysts has been reported by Li et al.29 Lou et al. synthesized Co3O4 nanorods, and studied photocatalytic degradation of different active dyes.30 In recent times, Pan et al. have shown the photocatalytic performance of Co3O4 nanostructured materials for the degradation of methyl orange.31
Mesoporous Co3O4 with higher surface area enhances the adsorption and diffusion of reactant molecules toward better catalytic performance of the oxides. Mesoporous Co3O4 is generally synthesized by either a hard templating route using KIT-6, SBA-15 and SBA-16 silica,32,33 and carbon spheres34 as hard templates or a soft templating process35 using Pluronic block copolymers as soft templating agents. The hard templating route is an effective method to prepare mesoporous metal oxides. However, the hard templating method is tedious involving a multi-step reaction pathway for the removal of hard templates, use of harmful hydrofluoric acid or sodium hydroxide etc. Therefore, development of a simple, environmentally benign method is important for the synthesis of mesoporous transition metal oxides. Zheng et al.36 synthesized flower-like mesoporous Co3O4 by a solvothermal method. Mesoporous Co3O4 microcubes were synthesized by a solvothermal method using diethylene glycol (DEG) as an organic solvent.37 Wang et al.38 synthesized porous Co3O4 nanowires by annealing the as-prepared cobalt carbonate hydroxide by a hydrothermal method. Zhu et al. reported a solvothermal approach for the shape-controlled synthesis of porous Co3O4 following thermal decomposition of the corresponding cobalt carbonate/hydroxide intermediates.39 Metal carboxylates are effective precursors for the synthesis of metal oxides in terms of low cost, easy synthesis process etc. Using a reverse micelles process, copper oxalate nanorods with tuned size and morphology were prepared by Ranjan et al.40 Guo et al. synthesized various transition metal oxides with high crystallinity by thermal decomposition of the corresponding transition metal oxalate.41 We have reported the synthesis of mesoporous CuO with multi-shell patterned structures obtained from the thermal decomposition of copper oxalate.42 Using organic solvents like N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), Wang et al. synthesized cobalt oxalate and mesoporous Co3O4 nanostructures.43 Nanostructured Co3O4 was obtained via thermal decomposition of a nanostructured cobalt oxalate precursor synthesized through a microemulsion-mediated technique44,45 and a surfactant-free soft chemical precipitation process.46
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a class of low temperature molten salts composed of organic cations and inorganic or organic anions with high polarity and a pre-organized solvent structure. They have little measurable vapour pressure, high thermal stability, and tunable solubility for inorganic and organic molecules. Due to their unique properties, they have been used as solvents, additives, templates, or precursors in designing materials synthesis.47 Ionic liquids have been exploited for the synthesis of zeolites, inorganic–organic hybrid materials,48 mesoporous silica49etc. Wang et al. reported the synthesis of ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide) modified BiOI which showed superior photocatalytic activity to the unmodified BiOI.50 Microwave-assisted synthesis of cobalt oxalate nanorods in the presence of an ionic liquid followed by their thermal conversion to Co3O4 rods was reported by Wang and Zhu.51
Keeping the above views in mind, the objective of the present investigation is to study the role of different cationic templates in the formation of self-assembled different shaped mesoporous Co3O4via a simple soft chemical, ligand-assisted process using cobalt nitrate, oxalic acid, and phosphoric acid at 75 °C/2 h followed by calcination at 300 °C. In this work, the effect of ILs, pyridinium bromide (PB) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (IB), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as templates on the physico-chemical properties of Co3O4 was studied. The structures of CTAB, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, and pyridinium bromide are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The photocatalytic performance of the synthesized products was evaluated and illustrated in terms of morphology and textural properties. Chicago Sky Blue 6B (CSB) (chemical structure shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), a carcinogenic azo dye widely used in the textile, paper, food and pharmaceutical industries,52 was degraded using the Co3O4 catalysts. This study provides new insights into the design and synthesis of other transition metal oxides for their various applications. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the effect of cationic templates (CTAB and ILs – PB and IB) on the morphology and textural properties of designed mesoporous different shaped Co3O4 particles, and their dual influence on the rapid visible-light-driven photocatalysis by synthesised pure Co3O4 catalysts.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis
Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (IB), and pyridinium bromide (PB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)3·6H2O), oxalic acid and phosphoric acid were obtained from Merck, India. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experiment.
In a typical experiment, 20 mmol cobalt nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in 140 mL of water followed by addition of different amounts of cationic templates, CTAB, pyridinium bromide and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, each maintaining the template: Co(NO3)2.6H2O molar ratio as 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. The mixture solution was stirred vigorously at 75 °C for 2 h. A total of 60 mL of 12 mmol oxalic acid solution in water containing 2 mL of phosphoric acid was slowly added into the former solution under vigorous stirring at 75 °C. The Co(NO3)2·6H2O:oxalic acid molar ratio was maintained as 1:0.6. The stirring was continued for 5 minutes to obtain a pink viscous mass. The hot viscous material was quenched in ice water followed by centrifugation (6000 rpm) and washing (thrice) with acetone. It was then dried at 60 °C for 24 h followed by calcination at 300 °C for 2 h at the heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The samples were designated as CTAB-0.2, CTAB-0.3, CTAB-0.4, IB-0.2, IB-0.3, IB-0.4, PB-0.2, PB-0.3, and PB-0.4 prepared using CTAB, IB and PB each with template: Co2+ molar ratios of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4.
Characterization
The thermal behaviours of the uncalcined (as-prepared) particles were studied by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) using a Netzsch STA 449C, Germany from room temperature to 600 °C in an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the calcined powders were performed using a Philips X'Pert Pro PW 3050/60 powder diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The characteristic vibration bands of the products were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy (Nicolet 5PC, Nicolet Analytical Instruments, Madison, WI) using KBr pellets at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The Raman spectrum was recorded using a RENISHAW spectrometer with 514 nm radiation from an argon laser at room temperature. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were conducted at 77 K using a Quantachrome (ASIQ MP) instrument. The samples were outgassed in vacuum at 250 °C for 4 h prior to the measurement. The surface area was obtained using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method within the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.20 and the pore size distribution was calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The nitrogen adsorption volume at the relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99 was used to determine the pore volume. The morphology of the particles was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy, FESEM, using a Zeiss Supra™ 35VP instrument operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, and transmission electron microscopy, TEM, using a Tecnai G2 30ST (FEI) instrument operating at 300 kV. The UV-visible spectra were recorded using a UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3101PC, Shimadzu).
Photocatalytic test
In a typical photocatalytic test, 20 mg of the prepared Co3O4 sample was mixed with 60 mL of 10−5 M Chicago Sky Blue 6B (CSB) dye solution followed by stirring for about 30 minutes in the dark for homogenization. Aliquots were taken out, filtered using a Millipore filter paper (pore diameter 0.22 μm). The filtrates were analyzed using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Rest of the dye solution was placed in a rectangular box (68 cm × 25 cm × 36 cm). At the inside top of the box two tubes, each with a power of 18 W, are attached. The solution was irradiated from a distance of 11 cm with visible light (λ = 465 nm) at room temperature in the photoreactor. After a time interval of 3 minutes of irradiation, aliquots were collected, filtered and monitored using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The decrease in absorption intensity at λmax = 618 nm indicates the photocatalytic degradation of the organic dye.
3. Results and discussion
Ligand-assisted synthesis of different shaped mesoporous Co3O4

Fig. 1A shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples synthesized at 75 °C/2 h using different templates, (a) CTAB, (b) IB and (c) PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3. It confirms the characteristic peaks of hydrated cobalt oxalate which can be indexed to the orthorhombic phase of CoC2O4·xH2O (JCPDS No. 25-0250). After calcination at 300 °C, the cubic Co3O4 phase (JCPDS File No. 43-1003) was formed for the corresponding samples (Fig. 1B). It is to be noted that the presence of Co2+ in the as-prepared CoC2O4·xH2O is octahedrally coordinated,53 and it is in metastable form. Co3O4 has a spinel structure containing Co3+ in an octahedral coordination and Co2+ in a tetrahedral coordination,54 which is thermodynamically stable. Therefore, upon calcination of the as-prepared CoC2O4·xH2O in an air atmosphere, the thermodynamically stable Co3O4 spinel was formed. By changing the molar concentration ratio of template: Co2+ to 0.2 and 0.4, the crystallization behaviours remain unchanged for both the (A) as-prepared and (B) calcined samples as evidenced from their XRD peak positions (Fig. S2 (a) CTAB-0.2, (b) IB-0.2, and (c) PB-0.2; and Fig. S3 (a) CTAB-0.4, (b) IB-0.4, and (c) PB-0.4, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the (A) as-prepared and (B) calcined samples synthesized using (a) CTAB, (b) IB and (c) PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3. 
DTA and TGA of the as-prepared (uncalcined) samples prepared using (A) CTAB, (B) IB and (C) PB each with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3 is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). In TG analysis, it is observed that a significant mass loss occurred in two distinct steps i.e., up to 200 °C and 200–300 °C. The curves show the endothermic peaks at around 165–170 °C, accompanied by a sharp mass loss of 19% and 15% using CTAB and IB, and PB, respectively, up to 200 °C in the TGA curve. The DTA curves exhibit the exothermic peaks at around 265–270 °C with a sharp mass loss of about 37% in the temperature range 200–300 °C. The endothermic peaks of the samples attributed to the removal of structural water correspond to the first step mass loss of 15–19%. The exothermic peak was due to decomposition of cobalt oxalate revealing the second step mass loss of about 37%. A small fraction of mass loss (2–4%) occurred from 300 to 600 °C which could be due to the removal of a residual amount of templates entrapped in the samples. Based on the thermal analysis, the total decomposition process can be expressed as: CoC2O4·xH2O → CoC2O4 + xH2O(1) 3CoC2O4 + 2O2 → Co3O4 + 6CO2(2)
The FTIR spectra of the as-prepared samples synthesized using CTAB, IB and PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3 are shown in Fig. 2A, while Fig. 2B reveals the FTIR spectra of the corresponding calcined samples. For the as-prepared samples (Fig. 2A), the absorption band at around 3358 cm−1 is assigned to the water of hydration. The strong peak at 1627 cm−1 is attributed to the CO stretching vibration, while the absorption bands at 1363 cm−1 and 1315 cm−1 are ascribed to C–O asymmetric and symmetric vibrations, respectively. It indicates the presence of bridging oxalates with all four oxygen atoms coordinated to the metal atoms.55 The asymmetric O–C–O band appears at 833 cm−1, and the symmetric C–C–O band is found at 487 cm−1. However, for the calcined samples (Fig. 2B), two sharp absorption bands are noticed at 565 cm−1 and 667 cm−1, which correspond to spinel Co–O stretching vibration mode,56 the former peak was assigned to octahedrally co-ordinated Co3+, while the latter was due to tetrahedrally co-ordinated Co2+. By changing the molar concentration ratio of template: Co2+ to 0.2 and 0.4, the FTIR peak positions remain unchanged for both the (A) as-prepared and (B) calcined samples (Fig. S5 (a) CTAB-0.2, (b) IB-0.2, (c) PB-0.2; and Fig. S6 (a) CTAB-0.4, (b) IB-0.4, (c) PB-0.4, ESI†).
 Fig. 2  FTIR spectra of the (A) as-prepared and (B) calcined samples synthesized using (a) CTAB, (b) IB and (c) PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3. 
Raman spectra of CoC2O4·xH2O prepared using CTAB, IB, and PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3 are shown in Fig. 3A. For CTAB-templated samples, the stronger band at 1470 cm−1 with a shoulder at 1447 cm−1 along with other bands at 917 cm−1, 589 cm−1, and 531 cm−1 corroborated with the presence of cobalt oxalate.57 Interestingly, in the presence of pyridinium bromide (PB), each Raman peak shifted a little extent to lower wavenumbers, while a significant shifting of the corresponding peaks to 1455 cm−1, 1434 cm−1, 896 cm−1, 572 cm−1, and 511 cm−1 for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (IB)-templated samples is noticed. Due to more delocalization of π-electrons58 in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide compared to pyridinium bromide, the Raman peaks of the former sample shifted toward lower wavenumbers compared to those in the latter sample. For the calcined samples prepared in the presence of CTAB, the characteristic bands at 195 cm−1, 522 cm−1 and 618 cm−1 were attributed to the F2g Raman active modes, and those appeared at 481 cm−1 and 688 cm−1 were due to Eg and A1g modes, respectively (Fig. 3B). The Raman mode A1g corresponded to the characteristics of octahedral sites, and Eg and F2g modes were assigned to the combined vibrations of the tetrahedral site and octahedral oxygen motions.59 The peak shifting toward lower wavenumbers for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide-templated sample is also noticed in calcined samples. From thermal analysis (Fig. S4A–C, ESI†), it is clear that a little amount of template remained undecomposed even after calcination at 300 °C, which could contribute to peak shifting due to the presence of more delocalized π-electrons in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide as observed in the case of as-prepared samples.
 Fig. 3  Raman spectra of the (A) as-prepared and (B) calcined samples synthesized using (a) CTAB, (b) IB and (c) PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3. 

Fig. 4a–c shows the FESEM microstructures of the calcined (300 °C) samples prepared using (a) CTAB, (b) IB and (c) PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.2. It is clear that flake-like particles were obtained using CTAB, while IB and PB rendered dice-like particles in which the smaller particles self-assembled in an appropriate alignment. The higher magnification images of the corresponding microstructures are shown in Fig. S7a–c (ESI†). Interestingly, with an increase in the template: Co2+ molar ratio to 0.3, the flake-like particles of CTAB-assisted samples transformed to a mixture of dice and rod-like particles (Fig. 4d). From the higher magnified FESEM image (Fig. S7d (ESI†)), it is seen that the dice-like particles come in the vicinity of each other, dissolve and combine forming a nut-bolt-like shape (marked with rectangle). Upon increasing the concentration of CTAB, more and more template molecules adsorb onto the surface of the crystals via hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force, thus favouring a nut-bolt-like shape. In the presence of IB and PB with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3, dice-like particles generated at the lower concentration of ILs (template: Co2+ = 0.2) transformed into rod-like particles which is shown in Fig. 4e and f, respectively. Fig. S7e and f (ESI†) reveals the higher magnified images of the corresponding samples. With a further increase in the template: Co2+ molar ratio to 0.4, the rod-like morphology was obtained for all the samples prepared in the presence of CTAB (Fig. 4g), IB (Fig. 4h) and PB (Fig. 4i). However, CTAB-assisted samples show a little bit aggregation in rod-like particles as compared to IB and PB-assisted samples; the microstructures are clearly observed from their higher magnified images of the corresponding samples (Fig. S7g–i, ESI†). The morphology of the as-prepared CoC2O4·xH2O samples synthesized with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3 shows a mixture of dice- and rod-like particles in the presence of CTAB, and rod-like microstructure in the presence of IB and PB (Fig. S8a–c, ESI†). It indicates that morphology remains unchanged through the transformation of CoC2O4·xH2O to Co3O4 after calcination at 300 °C.
 Fig. 4  FESEM micrographs of the calcined samples synthesized using CTAB, IB and PB with different concentrations: (a) CTAB-0.2, (b) IB-0.2, (c) PB-0.2, (d) CTAB-0.3, (e) IB-0.3, (f) PB-0.3, (g) CTAB-0.4, (h) IB-0.4, and (i) PB-0.4. 
It is to be noted that different cationic templates show different morphologies. It is due to different chemical structures and the nature of interactions of the templates with the nuclei. In the presence of CTAB, self-assembly of the surfactants leads to the formation of micelles and bilayer structures.60 A seed-nuclei oriented attachment process occurs via adsorption of colloids by sharing a CTAB bilayer.61 At lower concentrations of CTAB, the growth of the particles becomes random due to the metastability of the adsorbed colloidal particles surrounded by the CTAB bilayer. It renders flake- or dice-like morphology. However, with an increase in the CTAB concentration, more and more CTAB bilayers are formed resulting in preferential adsorption of more nuclei onto the seed particles, and the growth of the particles is oriented in 1D direction. This results in rod-like morphology of the particles. It is worth mentioning that unlike the long-chain alkylammonium surfactant (CTAB), the short chain ILs (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and pyridinium bromide) cannot preferentially self-assemble into micelle structures and bilayer aggregates through the rearrangement of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecular chains in solution. In the case of ILs, π–π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding62–64 of the neighbouring imidazolium and pyridinium rings occur. The cationic parts of ILs i.e., pyridinium and 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium ions are aligned and arrayed along seed layers, which is driven by coulomb coupling force with the Br− ions. It favours the formation of rod-like structures. However, at relatively lower concentration of ILs, dice-like particles are formed instead. It demonstrates that an optimum concentration of IL is required for hydrogen bond–co–π–π interaction toward the formation of rod-like particles.

Fig. 5a–i shows the TEM images (low and high magnified images) of the calcined (300 °C) samples prepared using CTAB, IB and PB, respectively, with template: Co2+ molar ratios of 0.2 (Fig. 5a–c), 0.3 (Fig. 5d–f) and 0.4 (Fig. 5g–i). At a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.2, the flake-shaped particles of CTAB-assisted samples, and dice-like particles formed in the presence of IB and PB are clearly noticed from TEM images. In the presence of IB and PB each with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3 and 0.4, and in the presence of CTAB with a CTAB:Co2+ molar ratio of 0.4, the rod-like morphology (diameter of the rod ranges from 100–500 nm) of the particles was identified. However, at a CTAB:Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3, the synthesized particles comprised of dice and rod-shaped particles. The presence of interparticle pores and the pores generated within the interface of nanorod arrays are observed from TEM images. The pores were not uniform with a lack of particular size and shape. The as-prepared CoC2O4·xH2O samples prepared with a template: Co2+ molar ratio of 0.3 also indicate the presence of dice- and rod-like morphology using CTAB, and rod-like microstructures in the presence of IB and PB (Fig. S9a–c, ESI†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. S10a–i, ESI†) of the calcined (300 °C) samples prepared using CTAB, IB and PB, respectively, with template: Co2+ molar ratios of 0.2 (Fig. S10a–c, ESI†), 0.3 (Fig. S10d–f, ESI†) and 0.4 (Fig. S10g–i, ESI†) corresponded to the cubic Co3O4 phase (also confirmed from XRD patterns) with polycrystalline nature of the samples, which was further confirmed by the corresponding HRTEM images (Fig. S11a–i, ESI†). The d-spacing of 0.24 nm, 0.28 nm and 0.46 nm corresponded to the lattice planes of (311), (220) and (111) cubic Co3O4, respectively.

Fig. 6 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the calcined (300 °C) samples prepared using (a) CTAB, and (b) IB and (c) PB with template: Co2+ molar ratios of (A) 0.2, (B) 0.3 and (C) 0.4. It displays type IV isotherm plots according to the IUPAC classification, which indicated the mesoporous characteristic of the sample. The curves show type H-3 hysteresis loop. It indicated that asymmetric, interconnected, slit-like mesoporosity existed in the samples. The BJH pore size distributions (PSDs) of the corresponding samples derived from adsorption data of the isotherms are shown in the insets of Fig. 6. The PSD curves indicate the absence of regular shapes and sizes of the pores in the samples. During thermal decomposition of CoC2O4·xH2O to Co3O4, interparticle mesopores were generated65 which could have been originated from the mesoporous voids66 between the nanocrystallites of Co3O4. Table S1 summarizes the textural properties of the samples (ESI†). The BET surface area of CTAB-assisted samples decreased with an increase in their relative molar concentration (with respect to Co2+) from 0.2 to 0.3 followed by an increase in the surface area value for a relative molar concentration of 0.4. However, the BET surface area of IB and PB-assisted samples increased with an increase in their relative molar concentration from 0.2 to 0.3 followed by lowering of the surface area value for a relative molar concentration of 0.4. It is noteworthy that the morphology of the particles could play a significant role in changing the BET surface area values. The flake-like and rod-shaped particles obtained in the presence of CTAB with 0.2 and 0.4 relative molar concentrations, respectively, rendered higher surface area compared to that obtained with the 0.3 relative molar concentration of CTAB, the latter exhibited rod-like particles along with dice-shaped morphology. Due to the formation of dice-like particles obtained in the presence of IB and PB with the relative molar concentration of 0.2, the BET surface area values became lower. However, the rod-shaped particles obtained in the presence of ionic liquids with a relative molar concentration of 0.3 significantly increased the BET surface area. The pore volume of all the samples ranged from 0.33 to 0.44 cc g−1, while the pore size ranged from 19–53 nm.

Optical absorption study
To study the optical absorption characteristics and band gaps of the synthesized Co3O4 particles, the UV-vis spectroscopy study was performed. The absorption spectra of the prepared Co3O4 particles show two peaks, at about 440 nm and 725 nm (Fig. S12a–i, ESI†), which are due to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT). The former peak could be assigned to O2− → Co2+, while the latter represents O2− → Co3+ LMCT.67 Considering the absorption data, the optical band gap was calculated using the Tauc equation: (αhν)n = K(hν – Eg)(3)where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the energy of photons, the value of n depends upon the material of the photocatalyst (n = 2 for direct allowed transition, n = 1/2 for indirect allowed transition, and n = 1/3 for indirect forbidden transition), in the present case n = 2, Eg is the band gap, and K is a constant.
Fig. S13a–i (ESI†) shows the plot of (αhν)2versus hν. The band gap is calculated by extrapolating a tangent to the x-axis. For the Co3O4 semiconductor, two optical band gaps are obtained based on its band structure.68 In the Co3O4 semiconductor, the valence band (VB) possesses dominant O 2p character, whereas 3d orbitals of Co2+ prevail in the conduction band (CB). The 3d orbitals of Co3+ remain as sub-bands between the aforementioned VB and CB. The transition from the VB to the CB renders true band gap energy (Eg2), while Eg1 is assigned to O2− → Co3+ excitation. The values of Eg1 and Eg2 (Table S2, ESI†) of Co3O4 photocatalysts with different morphologies are in the range of 1.4–1.5 eV and 1.5–1.9 eV, respectively. These values are comparable to those reported for Co3O4 semiconductors.69
Photocatalytic degradation study
Before irradiation with visible light, the adsorption ability (mg g−1) of the samples onto the dye (kept in the dark for 30 minutes for homogenization) was studied. Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows the dye adsorption capacity (mg g−1) of different samples. It reveals that the samples, CTAB-0.3, PB-0.2 and IB-0.2, having less surface area exhibited relatively lower adsorption capacity compared to that of the samples, IB-0.3, CTAB-0.4, PB-0.3, IB-0.4, CTAB-0.2, and PB-0.4, having more surface area. In this case, the morphology of the samples has a little influence on dye adsorption. However, to study the effect of morphology as well as surface area of the samples, the photocatalytic activity of different shaped Co3O4 samples for the degradation of CSB in the presence of visible light was investigated. As the degradation of CSB proceeded, the characteristic absorption of CSB at λmax = 618 nm gradually decreased. A blank (without using a catalyst) experiment was performed for photocatalytic dye degradation to prove the photocatalytic performance of Co3O4. The degradation profile of CSB after the photocatalytic reaction with different Co3O4 catalysts prepared using CTAB, IB and PB at relative molar concentrations (with respect to Co2+) of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 is shown in Fig. S15, ESI.†Fig. 7A shows a linear plot of ln(Ct/C0) vs. time, which confirmed the pseudo-first order kinetics of the catalytic reactions. It is clear that the dye concentration decreased with time; the rate of decrease of concentration in the presence of Co3O4 catalysts prepared using different templates with various concentrations is as follows PB-0.3 > IB-0.3 > CTAB-0.4 > IB-0.4 > PB-0.4 > PB-0.2 > CTAB-0.3 > IB-0.2 > CTAB-0.2 with their rate constant values of 14.3 × 10−2 min−1, 12.1 × 10−2 min−1, 7.8 × 10−2 min−1, 7.3 × 10−2 min−1, 6.4 × 10−2 min−1, 3.8 × 10−2 min−1, 2.8 × 10−2 min−1, 2.2 × 10−2 min−1, and 2.2 × 10−2 min−1, respectively. Fig. 7B represents a 3D plot exhibiting dependence of the rate constant of photocatalytic azo-dye degradation on morphology and surface area of the photocatalyst. It is also shown in tabulated form (Table S3 in the ESI†). It reveals that the maximum rate constant i.e., the maximum photocatalytic efficiency (95% dye degradation) was obtained for rod-like particles having higher surface area (PB-0.3). Compared with previous results, the degradation rate of CSB using the synthesized rod-like Co3O4 photocatalysts (PB-0.3) having higher surface area was found to be maximum (Table S4 in ESI†). Interestingly, unlike adsorption capacity (before irradiation with visible light), the dye degradation efficiency of different samples in the presence of visible light is dependent on the morphology as well as surface area of the samples. The stability of catalytic efficiency was checked for 5 cycles using the catalyst, PB-0.3, which shows maximum catalytic efficiency (Fig. 7C). It shows that the catalytic activity remained practically the same as that of the original catalyst indicating the recyclability of the catalyst.

It is interesting to point out that two properties i.e., morphology and surface area of the samples, play a significant role in photocatalytic efficiency of Co3O4. The particles with rod-like morphology having higher surface area rendered higher catalytic efficiency. For PB-assisted Co3O4, the sample PB-0.3 with rod-shaped morphology and the highest surface area resulted in maximum catalytic efficiency. However, the sample CTAB-0.2 having higher surface area than the samples, CTAB-0.3, CTAB-0.4, IB-0.2, IB-0.3, IB-0.4, PB-0.2, and PB-0.4, contributed the least catalytic efficiency due to flake-like morphology of the former particles.
Mechanism of dye degradation
Initially the dye molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst. The well-known mechanism of photoexcitation of the semiconductor photocatalyst upon irradiation with light is involved. The schematic of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 8. The photocatalyst upon irradiation with light of suitable wavelength renders migration of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band through the band gap (Eg), generating electron deficit holes. Thus formation of electron–hole pairs occurs.70 Generally, the photocatalytic reaction takes place at the surface of the photocatalyst. The electrons and highly oxidative holes present on the surface of the photocatalyst are trapped by oxygen and water, respectively, or by the surface adsorbed dye molecules. Thus a photocatalyst can allow facile migration of photogenerated charge carriers from the interior bulk to the surface, which is required to inhibit hole–electron recombination.24,71 The nanosized channel walls in mesoporous photocatalysts facilitate faster electron migration from bulk to the surface of the photocatalyst.72 Hence, mesoporous photocatalysts can successfully degrade water soluble organic pollutants by inhibiting recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. In the VB, the holes are trapped by water molecules to form ˙OH radicals.73 At the same time, the electrons in the CB of the Co3O4 semiconductor react with dissolved molecular oxygen present in water to produce superoxide radical anion O2˙−. This O2˙− reacts with H2O to furnish ˙OH and HOO˙ having powerful oxidizing ability.74 Upon reacting with these powerful oxidizing agents, the dye gets oxidized and decolorized.18 The furnished electron is able to regenerate the photocatalyst.
 Fig. 8  Mechanism of photoexcitation and dye decomposition using a semiconductor photocatalyst. 
With an increase in the surface area of the photocatalyst, the adsorption of the dye as well as the desorption process are facilitated. Mesoporous semiconductors of high surface area not only restrict recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, but also provide more surface reactive sites for the photocatalytic dye degradation process. Interestingly, it is to be noted that the morphology of photocatalysts plays a dominant role in reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs, which influences the efficiency of photocatalysts. Photocatalysts with rod-like morphology exhibit better photocatalytic efficiency than those with flake-like morphology in spite of having almost the same surface area. It is reported that one-dimensional (1D) structures favour fast electron transport resulting in significantly reduced recombination of the photogenerated charges.75 Moreover the true band gap (Eg2) measurement depicts that the flake-like photocatalysts possess a lower band gap than the rod-like photocatalysts. Thus the former shows lower photocatalytic efficiency.
Apart from the morphology effect of samples, the band gap of the photocatalysts plays a significant role in the increased photocatalytic efficiency, although having nearly the same surface area. It can be inferred that mesoporosity, high surface area, 1D (rod-like) morphology of Co3O4 photocatalysts, and higher band gaps are responsible for rapid degradation of the model water soluble organic pollutant under visible light irradiation.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the effect of cationic templates in tuning morphology and surface textural properties of Co3O4 toward excellent visible light photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of Chicago Sky Blue 6B. The ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and pyridinium bromide) generated rod-like structures (it is an ideal morphology to be attained by Co3O4 photocatalysts for a faster reaction rate) more favourably than when using CTAB due to the presence of π–π stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding in the former. Among all the photocatalysts, PB-0.3 having rod-like morphology and the highest surface area shows the maximum rate of photocatalytic dye degradation. This work provides a facile synthetic approach for tailoring morphology, textural properties and other physico-chemical properties by using various soft templates and ionic liquids for the synthesis of other metal oxides, which could be exploited for visible light photocatalysis applications.
