    , Accepted 5th September 2018First published on 8th September 2018AbstractTetrahedrite–tennantite (TET–TEN, Cu12Sb4S13–Cu12As4S13) nanoparticle (NP) alloys spanning the entire Sb–As composition range were synthesized using a hot-injection method without any detectable impurities. Thin films of TET–TEN NPs were prepared from colloidal NP inks and heat treated in sulfur vapor, hydrogen sulfide, and nitrogen atmospheres. Under sulfur, the TET–TEN films were oxidized to tetragonal famatinite–luzonite (Cu3As1−xSbxS4). Heat treating under a reducing hydrogen sulfide atmosphere stabilized the mixed TET–TEN alloy compositions, though the endmember compositions partially decomposed via loss of volatile pnictogen sulfides. Losses of pnictogen and sulfur atoms were most significant when heat treating under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Collectively, these results suggest that TET–TEN materials can be reversibly interconverted to famatinite–luzonite by selecting an appropriate annealing atmosphere. Our work serves as the foundation for both the synthesis and production of device-quality TET–TEN and related chalcogenide NP thin films.
1. Introduction
Semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) offer many advantages over bulk materials for the fabrication of thin-film electronic devices due to their size-dependent characteristics. Optoelectronic properties of NPs are correlated with NP size due to quantum confinement effects, and NP surfaces can be functionalized with a variety of ligands for colloidal stability in many solvents, thus enabling the use of low-cost and high-throughput manufacturing methods such as direct inkjet printing.1–3 These qualities have spurred significant scientific effort into synthesizing novel NP-based semiconducting compounds for use in energy-related applications. High-efficiency photovoltaic devices have been demonstrated for NP-based CdTe4,5 and Cu(In,Ga)Se2,6 and a high figure of merit has been reported for NP-based Bi2Te3 thermoelectric devices.7
While long-chained carbonaceous ligands enable facile solution-phase deposition of NP films, they typically hinder final device performance due to their electrically insulating nature. As such, as-deposited NP thin films are often heat treated to remove or modify the surface-bound ligands and improve electronic transport. For sulfide-based materials, a variety of thermal anneals have been incorporated into thin film fabrication protocols. Elemental sulfur and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) have both been used to remove ligands and densify NP films of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu(In,Ga)S2, respectively.8,9 The use of a reactive selenium atmosphere to convert CuInS2 and CuInSe2 NP films into micron-sized grains of CuInSe2 was first demonstrated by Guo et al.10,11 This heat treatment is now a widely-used method to convert sulfide-based materials into their selenide analogs and aggregate carbonaceous ligands into a “fine-grain” layer whose effect on device performance appears to be relatively benign.12–15
Recent energy-related research has seen an increased focus on semiconductors comprised of earth-abundant elements to minimize feedstock expenses and alleviate concerns regarding large-scale materials availability for terawatt-scale manufacturing.16 One such class of materials is the copper antimony sulfide (Cu–Sb–S) family, which has been studied in both thermoelectric and photovoltaic contexts. Extensive research on tetrahedrite (TET, Cu12Sb4S13), has revealed promising thermoelectric properties in natural, synthetic, and alloyed samples.17–25 Additionally, TET and its derivatives are candidates for use in solar energy conversion due to predicted conversion efficiencies exceeding 20% and ideal band gap energies of ∼1.5 eV.26,27
The isostructural analog of TET, achieved by substituting antimony with the more earth abundant element arsenic, is tennantite (TEN, Cu12As4S13).28–30 The TET–TEN system forms a complete solid series between Sb and As, enabling the tuning of optoelectronic properties via alloying.31,32 Furthermore, the mismatch of Sb and As radii in a mixed alloy crystal lattice may improve thermoelectric performance by increasing phonon scattering without significantly hindering carrier transport.33 Sb–As alloying has been shown to tune the optical band gap in Cu3As1−xSbxS4 NPs,30 improve the power factor (a thermoelectric parameter) of Cu3As1−xSbxSe4 NP films,34 and boost the thermoelectric figure of merit in blended TET–TEN mineral samples.17,18
Controlled syntheses of TET35–38 and TEN39 NPs have been previously reported in the literature. Development of a solution-based synthesis represents a more scalable route to Sb- and As-based chalcogenide films when compared to more common techniques such as spark plasma sintering. Developing thermal treatments to remove surface-bound ligands and densify NP-based TET–TEN films is necessary for future optoelectronic device development; however, there have been no reports detailing a synthetic protocol for TET–TEN NP alloys or heat treatments for thin films formed from such NPs. In this manuscript, we report the first synthesis of impurity-free TET–TEN NP alloys and demonstrate the effects of elemental sulfur, H2S, and inert atmospheres on the phase stability and composition of TET–TEN NP alloy films at elevated temperatures. We show that the oxidation state of sulfur during heat treatment is critical for controlling the final bulk phase of the film, and that antimony, arsenic, and sulfur are prone to escaping from the films at elevated temperatures. These data are critical knowledge for future development of Cu–Sb–S, Cu–As–S, and related material systems.
2. Experimental section
Materials
All materials were used as received with standard air-free handling procedures. Antimony(III) chloride (SbCl3, 99.99%), arsenic(III) chloride (AsCl3, 99.95%), and sulfur flakes (S, 99.99%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Copper(I) chloride (CuCl, 99.99%) was obtained from Strem. Oleylamine (80–90%, OLA) was obtained from Acros Organics; it was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw (FPT) cycles and stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox before use in making stock solutions. Ethanol (EtOH, 200 proof) was obtained from Koptec, hexanes (98.5%, mixture of isomers) were obtained from Fisher, and toluene (99.5%) was obtained from Macron. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S, 1%; balance argon) was obtained from Airgas (an Air Liquide Company). Note that AsCl3is highly toxic and must be handled under an inert atmosphere using proper personal protective equipment at all times!
Nanoparticle alloy synthesis and washing procedure
To synthesize TET–TEN NP alloys, a two-step hot injection method was adapted from previous reports by Balow et al.30,39 All syntheses were performed using standard air-free techniques. Three stock solutions were prepared in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Solution A contained 1.6 mmol CuCl, 0.571 mmol SbCl3, and 8 mL FPT OLA; Solution B contained 1.6 mmol CuCl, 0.571 mmol AsCl3, and 8 mL FPT OLA; Solution C contained 9 mmol S flakes and 6 mL FPT OLA. All solutions were sealed and placed on a stir plate and heated to 65 °C for dissolution. Solutions A and B stirred with heat for 2 h, while Solution C stirred for 0.5 h with heat and the remaining 1.5 h without heat. Immediately prior to injection, mixed cation precursor solutions were made by combining Solutions A and B in nitrogen-purged vials sealed with Teflon septa. The Cu12Sb4S13 precursor solution contained 3.0 mL of Solution A, the Cu12(As0.25Sb0.75)4S13 solution contained 2.25 mL of Solution A and 0.75 mL of Solution B, the Cu12(As0.50Sb0.50)4S13 solution contained 1.5 mL of Solution A and 1.5 mL of Solution B, the Cu12(As0.75Sb0.25)4S13 solution contained 0.75 mL of Solution A and 2.25 mL of Solution B, and the Cu12As4S13 solution contained 3.0 mL of Solution B.
A three-neck reaction flask containing 7.0 mL OLA and a Teflon stir bar was sealed and attached to a Schlenk line. The flask was evacuated and refilled three times with argon. The flask was then heated under vacuum to reflux (∼115 °C) for 1 h. The flask was then refilled with argon, and the temperature was increased to 250 °C. Once the temperature reached 250 °C, 0.8 mL of S-OLA (Solution C) was injected into the vessel, and 2.0 mL of the appropriate mixed cation solution was injected 20 s later, inducing a rapid nucleation event. The reaction was maintained at 250 °C for 30 min and then cooled naturally to room temperature. Once the vessel was below 40 °C, the flask contents were extracted into a 25 mL centrifuge tube for washing and purification. The centrifuge tube was topped with EtOH and centrifuged at 14000 rpm (∼17100 × g) for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in ∼10 mL hexane by vortexing. The tube was then topped with EtOH, vortexed, and centrifuged as described previously. The hexane–ethanol wash was repeated one final time. The remaining NP pellet was suspended in ∼5 mL toluene and stored for later use.
Heat treatments
Samples were prepared for heat treatments by drop-casting ∼200 μL of the toluene NP ink onto glass and silicon substrates. The toluene was then slowly evaporated at room temperature in air to form thin films. For each heat treatment, the five samples of distinct compositions were treated together in the same vessel.
Sulfur anneal
The sulfur anneals occurred in a three-zone tube furnace (Applied Test Systems, Inc. Series 3210) with a quartz tube. Zone 1 contained sulfur flakes, Zone 2 contained the samples, and Zone 3 was left empty. The tube was evacuated and refilled with argon three times to purge the system of oxygen and moisture. Zone 1 was heated to 200 °C, and the other two zones were heated to the desired reaction temperature (350 °C or 450 °C). A steady backflow of argon (10 sccm) was introduced to minimize sulfur transport towards the samples during the initial heat up. Once the temperatures had equilibrated, a graphite box containing sulfur flakes was pushed into Zone 1 to heat the sulfur flakes and generate sulfur vapor (15 min). Then, the five thin films were inserted into Zone 2 using a manual push–pull rod, and the argon flow was reversed to carry sulfur vapor towards the samples for 1 h. After the sulfurization, the furnace was opened, and the heaters were turned off. The direction of the argon flow was again reversed to purge the atmosphere and minimize condensation of sulfur onto the thin films. The samples were naturally cooled below 40 °C before removing the samples to ambient air.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) anneal
The five samples were loaded into a graphite sample holder and secured outside the heating zone of a vertical tube furnace (Applied Test Systems, Inc., Series 3210). A quartz tube was placed over the samples and sealed within the furnace. The H2S and argon gas lines were purged with argon for 10 min. The tube was then evacuated and refilled with argon three times and then heated to the annealing temperature (350 °C or 450 °C) under 100 sccm argon flow. Once the target temperature was reached, the argon lines were closed, and H2S/Ar gas flow was initiated (20 sccm). After 1 min, the samples were pushed into the center of the tube furnace using a manual push–pull rod and treated for 1 h. The heaters were then turned off, the H2S/Ar flow was halted, and a 100 sccm argon flow was initiated. The furnace jacket was opened, allowing the samples to cool naturally to 40 °C before opening the tube to ambient air.
Hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic and corrosive. To ensure safe operation, both the hydrogen sulfide tank and annealing furnace are stored within a fume hood. The furnace is equipped with an H2S detector with a solenoid shutoff valve that will close in the event of a detectable leak above 10 ppm. The concentration of H2S is 1%, which is below the lower flammability limit (LFL) of 4%; more stringent safety precautions must be taken when working at higher concentrations. The gas outlet of the furnace is also equipped with an aqueous 0.5 M copper(II) sulfate solution to scrub any residual H2S gas from the exhaust.
Nitrogen anneal
The five samples were placed on a ceramic hot plate and isolated from the ambient atmosphere using a custom-made bell jar that was sealed to the hot plate with vacuum grease. The top of the bell jar was connected to a vacuum and nitrogen purge line. The apparatus was evacuated and refilled with nitrogen three times. The inlet nitrogen flow was set to 7 cfm using a rotameter, and the vacuum pump was adjusted such that the internal pressure of the bell jar was maintained at 100 Torr. The hot plate was set to the desired temperature (350 °C or 450 °C) for 1 h. After the treatment, the samples were cooled naturally to 40 °C before returning to atmospheric pressure and opening to the ambient environment.
Characterization
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data were collected on a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer equipped with a copper Kα X-ray source. Parallel beam geometry was used with an incidence angle of 0.5°. Raman spectra were collected using a Horiba/Jobin-Yvon LabRAM HR800 confocal microscope equipped with a 633 nm He:Ne laser through a 100× objective lens. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using either an FEI Nova NanoSEM at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV or a FEI Quanta 3D FEG dual-beam field emission SEM at an accelerating voltage of 7 kV. Scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data (SEM-EDS) were collected using a FEI Quanta 3D FEG dual-beam field emission SEM at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV with an Oxford INCA Xstream-2 silicon drift detector. All SEM-EDS was analyzed using AZtec software. Rietveld refinement was conducted using MAUD software.
3. Results and discussion
Characterization of synthesized Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 nanoparticles
The as-synthesized alloy NPs have a cubic crystal structure (space group I3m) as determined using GIXRD (Fig. 1). All observed diffraction peaks in the endmember TET and TEN compositions are assignable to references for Cu12Sb4S13 (JCPDS 01-075-2211) and Cu12As4S13 (JCPDS 01-073-3934), respectively. The most intense reflections are indexed to the (222), (440), and (622) planes for both cubic TET and TEN. The cubic alloy series displays a linear shift in lattice parameter, as predicted by Vegard's law for alloy materials (ESI;† Fig. S1).40,41 No extraneous diffraction planes are observed in the GIXRD patterns, suggesting an impurity-free synthesis.

Raman spectra of the Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 NPs were collected to check for amorphous impurity phases (Fig. 1). The TET and TEN endmember compositions closely match reference spectra for mineral Cu12Sb4S13 (RRUFF ID R040164) and Cu12As4S13 (RRUFF ID R050474), respectively, with slight discrepancies resulting from heavier elemental impurities (e.g. Zn, Ag) in the reference spectra. All mixed compositions exhibit lattice vibrational modes (100–150 cm−1) and symmetric (Sb/As)–S stretching modes (350–390 cm−1) similar to those found in the endmember reference spectra. The peaks display two-mode behavior, and the position of each peak shifts slightly with changing composition; both observations are consistent with a previous report.42 Only the vibrational modes reported for TET and TEN spectra were detected, further indicating impurity-free NPs.
The bulk elemental composition of the nano-sized particles (ESI,† Fig. S2) was investigated by SEM-EDS (Table 1); the results suggest off-stoichiometric compositions. Such off-stoichiometry is not surprising, as NP surfaces are commonly cation-rich due to preferential binding of electron-donating ligands to under-coordinated metallic surface sites.43 Furthermore, variable composition ranges (particularly copper-rich compositions) in both the TET and TEN systems have been reported previously.28,29,44–48

Characterization of nanoparticles annealed in sulfur
GIXRD data (Fig. 2) indicate complete conversion from the cubic TET–TEN alloy series to structures containing fully oxidized arsenic and antimony with a nominal stoichiometry of Cu3As1−xSbxS4. These alloys have a tetragonal crystal structure corresponding to the famatinite–luzonite (FAM–LUZ, Cu3SbS4–Cu3AsS4) mineral series. The diffraction patterns of the purely Sb and As samples match with the respective FAM and LUZ references (JCPDS 01-071-0555 and JCPDS 01-074-1125); we attribute a slight difference in peak position between the Cu3AsS4 reference and heat treated sample to the presence of antimony in reference spectrum JCPDS 01-074-1125. A shift to higher 2θ was observed as the ratio of arsenic to antimony increased, suggesting a contraction of the unit cell as arsenic occupies antimony sites in the lattice. Arsenic-rich compositions show an additional, but minor reflection around 28° 2θ that is assignable to the (210) plane of the orthorhombic polymorph enargite (ENG, Cu3AsS4, JCPDS 01-082-1464). Additionally, the intensity of this peak is reduced with increasing antimony concentration, suggesting that the tetragonal crystal structure is stabilized by the incorporation of antimony in the lattice. Rietveld refinement (ESI,† Table S1) confirms that increasing the antimony concentration decreases the relative proportion of the orthorhombic phase in the final film. The preferential formation of the tetragonal phase at high Sb concentrations is expected, as the FAM–LUZ series freely substitutes Sb and As at pnictogen lattice sites, while the ENG phase only remains stable up to ∼12 at% Sb substitution at As sites.29,49

GIXRD peaks marked with a * correspond to the (210) plane in orthorhombic enargite Cu3AsS4 (JCPDS 01-082-1464). 
Raman spectroscopy data (Fig. 2) also indicate the conversion of TET–TEN NP films to the FAM–LUZ alloy series upon heat treatment in a sulfur atmosphere at 450 °C. The vibrational modes of the Sb endmember match well with the Cu3SbS4 reference mineral (RRUFF ID R110021), while the As endmember is slightly shifted from the Cu3AsS4 reference mineral (RRUFF ID R060390); this discrepancy is again attributed to the presence of Sb in the reference spectrum. The characteristic ν1 bands, resulting from Sb–S and As–S stretching vibrations, shift to higher wavenumbers with increasing arsenic composition between 320 and 340 cm−1, with peak positions in close agreement with the FAM–LUZ alloy NP series.30 In each spectrum, there is a fixed vibrational mode near 494 cm−1 that is not present in the Raman spectra of the reference minerals; this stretch is likely due to elemental sulfur (S–S modes) that has reacted with the OLA ligands remaining in the film.50–52
SEM-EDS measurements (Table 2) were taken to determine bulk compositions of the films after the sulfur heat treatments. The Cu/(Sb + As) ratios are expected to remain identical for stoichiometric TET–TEN and FAM–LUZ compositions. However, after sulfurization, the Cu/(Sb + As) atomic ratios increased relative to the starting NP compositions, indicating a slight loss of pnictogen species. The Sb/(Sb + As) ratios of the mixed-composition samples also increased compared to their starting values, suggesting that arsenic is more readily lost from the films than antimony. Furthermore, Sb was observed in the treated TEN endmember and vice versa, implying that pnictogen species were carried between samples through the vapor phase, as all samples were heated together. Similar phase conversions were observed for NPs heat treated at 350 °C (ESI,† Fig. S3).

Characterization of nanoparticles annealed in H2S
GIXRD data (Fig. 3) obtained for the TET–TEN NP films heat treated in H2S at 450 °C for 1 h show maintenance of the cubic TET–TEN crystal structure in the mixed Sb and As compositions. These results differ from those of the elemental sulfur treatments, as the phases that exist after H2S anneals contain Sb or As in the nominal +3 state, rather than +5. In contrast to the stabilized alloy compositions, the endmember NP films underwent phase changes and decomposition at 450 °C. The heat treated Cu12Sb4S13 NP film displays crystallographic planes characteristic of the monoclinic skinnerite phase (SKI, Cu3SbS3, JCPDS 01-083-0563), as well as a smaller diffraction peak at 29.8° 2θ that is assignable to TET. Note that SKI is not observed in the sample annealed at 350 °C (ESI,† Fig. S4), consistent with previous studies in which SKI was only formed at higher temperatures.44,53 Additionally, the heat treated Cu12As4S13 film predominately contains digenite Cu1.8S (JCPDS 01-088-2045) impurity peaks. Rietveld refinement (ESI,† Table S2) was used to quantify the phases present after annealing; the data confirm that the endmember films decompose most readily during the H2S heat treatment. These observations are supported by a previous report suggesting that TEN is unstable at elevated temperature and decomposes into copper sulfide and arsenic sulfide intermediates.54 However, this decomposition does not occur at 350 °C (ESI,† Fig. S4 and S5).

(A) Cu12Sb4S13, (B) Cu12(As0.25Sb0.75)4S13, (C) Cu12(As0.50Sb0.50)4S13, (D) Cu12(As0.75Sb0.25)4S13, and (E) Cu12As4S13. The peak marked with (*) in GIXRD spectrum A is attributable to the (222) stretch of tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13 (JCPDS 42-560), and the peaks marked with (+) in spectrum E are attributable to digenite Cu1.8S (JCPDS 01-088-2045). The stretches in Raman spectrum A match with Cu3SbS3 and CuSbS2 spectra reported in the literature.55,56 
The obtained Raman spectra (Fig. 3) corroborate the stabilization of the TET–TEN cubic crystal structure in the mixed alloy compositions, with peak positions matching those of the starting NP alloys. The treated Cu12As4S13 film also displays peaks characteristic of the TEN phase, though digenite Cu1.8S was not detected in the Raman spectra. These data suggest the formation of localized copper sulfide impurities that are difficult to detect due to the relatively small sampling area. Raman spectra taken on the Cu12Sb4S13 film suggest a multiphase material. The modes near 130 cm−1 and 309 cm−1 have been reported in SKI thin films,55 and the mode at 333 cm−1 matches closely with the Raman mode of chalcostibite CuSbS2.56 The presence of multiple phases in the treated film is unsurprising, as TET decomposes to SKI through a CuSbS2 intermediate phase.57 Note that the Raman spectra of treated Cu12Sb4S13 varied across the surface with some spectra closely matching TET references (ESI,† Fig. S6), suggesting inhomogeneous surface composition after heat treatment. In the mixed pnictogen films, the TEN v1 vibrational mode (near 390 cm−1) was significantly reduced in intensity relative to the TET v1 vibrational mode (near 350 cm−1), implying more significant losses in As-rich compositions during the H2S heat treatments.42 To quantify the losses, SEM-EDS data (Table 3) were acquired on the treated films. The Cu/(Sb + As) ratios increased above the starting values, significantly more than the NPs that were heat treated in elemental sulfur vapors. There was also As present in the Sb endmember (and vice versa), again suggesting the mobility of Sb and As species in the vapor phase. The magnitude of these elemental losses suggests that H2S is less effective at suppressing decomposition than elemental sulfur.

Characterization of nanoparticles annealed in nitrogen
GIXRD (Fig. 4) data show a cubic crystal structure for all TET–TEN compositions, with some Sb-endmember decomposition into skinnerite Cu3SbS3 (JCPDS 01-083-0563) and As-endmember decomposition into digenite Cu1.8S (JCPDS 01-088-2045) after heating in nitrogen. Rietveld refinement (ESI,† Table S3) of the GIXRD spectra confirms the relative stability of the mixed alloy compositions when compared with the endmembers. Similar to the H2S treatments, the Raman spectra (Fig. 4) display peak shifts consistent with the cubic alloy phases, and the magnitude of the TEN v1 modes are significantly reduced relative to the TET v1 modes, suggesting more extensive decomposition in As-rich films. SEM-EDS measurements (Table 4) also show a greater loss of arsenic compared to antimony, with Sb/(Sb + As) ratios significantly higher than the starting NP values. The elemental analysis also reveals pnictogen losses in excess of the maximum observed stable composition ratio of Cu/(Sb + As) = ∼3.5:1.28,44 With the severe losses of arsenic and antimony, it is likely that highly localized copper sulfide species are scattered throughout the film but are undetectable by XRD or Raman. Significant compositional variations were observed across the film's surface, as evidenced by the high standard deviations of the SEM-EDS elemental ratios. It is evident that a nitrogen atmosphere is even less effective at suppressing elemental losses than sulfur and H2S atmospheres.

In all three atmospheres (ESI,† Fig. S8–S10), grain growth was observed, indicating that the heat treatment protocols may be fine-tuned to produce thin films with uniformly dense grains.
Discussion
The nature of the heat treatment atmosphere was critical for controlling the final phase of the TET–TEN NP alloys. It has been shown that Sb and As exist exclusively in the +5 state in the FAM–LUZ system and mostly in the +3 state in TET–TEN.22,35,58 Under an elemental sulfur atmosphere, the cubic NPs converted to a tetragonal phase upon annealing at 450 °C. This may be achieved by the simultaneous oxidation of Sb and As (from +3 to +5) and reduction of sulfur (from 0 to −2), forming Cu3SbS4–Cu3AsS4 alloy phases as described below:Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 + 3S → 4Cu3As1−xSbxS4
Annealing the TET–TEN NPs in 1% H2S still provides a sulfur-rich atmosphere, but it is slightly reducing instead of oxidizing. Consequently, the Sb and As cations remain in the nominal +3 state rather than the more oxidized +5 state. Additionally, the copper in the digenite Cu1.8S impurity phases primarily exists in the +1 state instead of +2, highlighting the role of H2S in controlling the nominal oxidation state of the multivalent atoms. The net effect of the H2S treatments was to form larger grains of the TET–TEN phases, as evidenced by SEM micrographs (ESI,† Fig. S8). These outcomes are not surprising, as H2S has been used to promote grain growth in other semiconductor systems, albeit in higher concentrations than used here.59,60
The loss of Sb and As species from the films is a critical observation with far-reaching implications. As seen in Table 5, pnictogen losses were greatest under a nitrogen atmosphere, followed by H2S, and finally sulfur vapor. Additionally, As-rich alloys demonstrated greater elemental losses after heat treatment. The SEM-EDS elemental ratios show losses in both the H2S and nitrogen-treated films, but the GIXRD-calculated ratios suggest less loss. Because the GIXRD data can only provide information regarding the crystalline portion of a material, it is likely that amorphous Cu–S phases exist throughout the treated films. Previous reports on the decomposition mechanisms of TET–TEN and related systems note such elemental sulfur and pnictogen sulfide losses during decomposition, as well as the formation of copper sulfides.21,54,61–64 It is therefore plausible that the TET–TEN alloy films decompose into binary sulfides and elemental sulfur upon heating. The decomposition phases such as Sb2S3/As2S3 and sulfur have relatively high vapor pressures and are likely removed during heat treatment in the effluent gas stream. Copper sulfide phases remain and may form crystallites (and hence become detectable by GIXRD) or become trapped at grain boundaries in the final films. It is also important to note that the lattice parameters of the heat treated films also shift linearly as expected from Vegard's law (ESI,† Fig. S11), suggesting that the compositions of crystalline grains remain relatively unchanged when compared with the pre-heat treated films.
Table 5 Cu/(Sb + As) ratios for the various 450 °C heat treatments. SEM-EDS data is reproduced from Tables 1–4, and the XRD-calculated results are computed using weight fractions estimated by Rietveld refinement (ESI, Tables S2 and S3). GIXRD-calculated results were not determined for the starting NPs or sulfur due to the lack of binary phases appearing in the GIXRD spectra

One possible solution to mitigate elemental losses at higher temperatures is to supply an atmosphere containing a partial pressure of pnictogen and sulfur species. Selection of the appropriate atmosphere must be done carefully, as the nominal oxidation state of sulfur in the annealing atmosphere can modify the final phase of the material. Implementation of a closed annealing system52 or maintaining a vapor pressure of volatile pnictogen sulfide species above the samples65 are two methods that have been utilized in closely related material systems (Cu3AsS4 and CuSbS2, respectively) and may be applied to the TET–TEN family.
The interconversion between cubic TET–TEN NPs and tetragonal FAM–LUZ NPs appears to be reversible if an appropriate annealing atmosphere is used. The FAM–LUZ NP alloy series was synthesized according to a previous report30 and then heat treated in sulfur, H2S, and nitrogen atmospheres as described in this manuscript. Under the elemental sulfur atmosphere, the FAM–LUZ phases were maintained, while H2S and nitrogen anneals resulted in conversion to the TET–TEN phases (ESI,† Fig. S12–S14). These two material systems have the same nominal copper-to-pnictogen ratio, suggesting that oxidation or reduction of the cations and the addition or removal of sulfur would result in interconversion between these crystallographic phases.30 This may be achieved through the use of reducing H2S (if TET–TEN is desired) or oxidizing sulfur (if FAM–LUZ is desired) atmospheres during heat treatment; however, controlling pnictogen losses in this setup remains a challenge. Introducing a gas stream of elemental As or Sb in conjunction with H2S may be an additional route to control these elemental losses. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of stabilizing and/or interconverting the TET–TEN and FAM–LUZ material families by rational selection of an annealing atmosphere, allowing for fabrication of materials with desired crystal structures and optoelectronic properties. Similar chalcogenide NP systems may also display comparable behavior, offering new insight and methodologies for synthesis of novel materials.
4. Conclusions
We have reported the first synthesis of Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 NPs alloys via a two-step hot-injection. NP-based thin films were heat treated in oxidizing (sulfur), reducing (H2S), and inert (nitrogen) environments to control the phase and composition of the synthesized Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 NP alloys. Heat treating under an elemental sulfur atmosphere oxidized the antimony and arsenic in the Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 materials, converting the cubic crystal structure to tetragonal Cu3As1−xSbxS4. Conversely, the oxidation states of antimony and arsenic were maintained when heat treating in H2S. Additionally, an increase in grain size was observed after all heat treatments. Elemental losses were observed when heating the Cu12(As1−xSbx)4S13 films in sulfur, H2S, and nitrogen, likely due to volatilization of sulfur and binary pnictogen sulfide species. These data provide insight into the stability of this material system and reveal the importance of the heat treatment atmosphere in both stabilizing and controllably converting between the TET–TEN and FAM–LUZ crystal systems. These results provide a foundation for future development of antimony and arsenic chalcogenide-based materials and offer insight into heat treatment conditions necessary for tuning and optimizing the optoelectronic properties for future device applications.
