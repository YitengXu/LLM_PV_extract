The influences of NaF content, Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the crystal structure and shape of the as-synthesized NaLuF4 crystals were systematically investigated.

As for Li+ doped α-NaLuF4, UC luminescence intensities of green emission (538 nm) and red emission (644 nm) in α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals with 20 mol% Li+ doping are enhanced by 20 and 3.5 times compared to their Li+-free counterpart. As for Li+ doped α/β-mixed NaLuF4, with the increase of Li+ content, the phase transforms from the α/β-mixed phase to hexagonal then to cubic. UC emissions of 538 nm and 644 nm in NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals doped with 5 mol% Li+ are enhanced by 26.5 and 23 times, respectively. Besides, it is found that with the higher temperature and prolonged time, the morphology of NaLuF4 changes from nanoparticles to microtubes, resulting in the dramatic increase of UC emission intensity. The effects of Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the enhancement of UC emission intensity are discussed in detail. This study provides an effective and facile approach to obtain nano/micro-crystals with controllable structures and excellent optical properties.
1. Introduction
Trivalent lanthanide ion (Ln3+) doped upconversion (UC) materials have currently attracted extensive attention due to their potential applications in fields such as bioprobes, associated lasers, display devices, photocatalysis, and solar energy conversion.1–8 UC nano/micro-particles can emit ultraviolet and visible light under near-infrared excitation based on an anti-Stokes process.9,10 Up to now, NaYF4 with low phonon energies and a high refractive index has been considered as the most efficient host matrix for UC emission,11 and hexagonal (β-) NaYF4 crystals have higher fluorescence efficiency than cubic (α-) NaYF4 crystals.12 With the same crystalline plane as NaYF4, the NaLuF4-based system also has excellent UC emission, which has received more and more attention.13–16 Ln3+ doped UC materials have many advantages, such as high photochemical stability, sharp emission bandwidths, and long luminescence lifetime.17–19 However, compared to traditional downconversion phosphors, one of main drawbacks of UC materials is their low quantum efficiency, which restricts their practical applications.20 Recently, many efforts have been made to develop different methods to enhance the UC luminescence intensity, such as the formation of core–shell structure,21 the incorporation of noble-metals,22 and the introduction of non-Ln3+.23 Though these efforts have provided huge development for their practical applications, it is still a challenge to enhance the UC luminescence intensity. It has been proved that the introduction of lithium ions (Li+) plays a significant role in the enhancement of UC emission intensity.24,25 The doped Li+ with small ionic radius can be easily inserted into the host lattice substitutionally or interstitially, which will modify the local symmetry around the Ln3+, leading to the increase of UC luminescence intensity. For instance, Zhang et al. reported 8 and 5 times enhancement of 452 nm and 479 nm UC emissions in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanocrystals through doping Li+.24 Zhao et al. demonstrated enhanced red UC emission by doping different concentrations of Li+ into GdF3:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals.25 However, there is no report on the enhancement of UC luminescence intensity by doping Li+ in α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals. Besides, Zhao et al. reported that the morphology of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ crystals changed from rod to disk and finally to polyhedron with the increasing concentrations of Li+. However, there is no report on the phase transformation and shape evolution by introducing Li+ in NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals.
To date, in order to obtain a desired crystal shape, many efforts have been devoted to the method for controlling the crystallization process and its physical mechanism.12,26 Especially, hollow fluoride materials with low densities and high surface area have attracted much attention.27–29 For instance, Yang et al. prepared β-NaYF4 microtubes through a hydrothermal route using PSS as the shape modifier.27 Yang et al. reported a facile process for the preparation of β-NaLuF4 microtubes via a molten-salt method using NaNO3-KNO3 as the medium.28 However, owing to the difficulties in controlling the nucleation and the complexities of crystal growth during the reaction process, it is still a challenge to manipulate the fabrication of NaLuF4 microcrystals with hollow structure. Typically, hydrothermal treatment is an effective and convenient method for synthesizing various inorganic materials with controllable structures and morphologies.30,31 During the hydrothermal growth of crystals, some external parameters such as hydrothermal reaction temperature and reaction time may greatly affect the crystallization process and shape evolution of particles in a solution-based system.29 Besides, the addition of salts such as NaF may also have a significant influence on the shape of crystals.32
In this paper, a series of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nano/micro-crystals with different crystal structures were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using citric acid as a chelating agent. The influences of NaF content, Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the phase and shape of the as-synthesized NaLuF4 crystals were systematically investigated. We first report Li+ doped α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals and the phase transformation by introducing Li+ in NaLuF4 crystals. UC emissions of 538 nm and 644 nm in Li+ doped NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals are remarkably enhanced compared with the Li+-free counterpart under 980 nm excitation at room temperature. Besides, β-NaLuF4 microtubes could be obtained with the higher temperature and prolonged time. The effects of Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the enhancement of UC emission intensity are discussed in detail.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All of the chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. 1 M of Lu(NO3)3, 0.5 M of Yb(NO3)3, and 0.1 M of Ho(NO3)3 stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the corresponding rare earth oxide (99.99%) in dilute nitric acid (30%) at elevated temperature.
2.2 Synthesis of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals
NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using citric acid as a chelating agent. In a typical procedure, 1 mmol of Ln(NO3)3 (0.79 mmol of Lu(NO3)3 (1 M, 0.79 mL), 0.2 mmol of Yb(NO3)3 (0.5 M, 0.4 mL), and 0.01 mmol of Ho(NO3)3 (0.1 M, 0.1 mL)) were added into an aqueous solution containing 2.5 mmol of citric acid (2 M, 1.25 mL) and 10 mL of deionized water to form the RE-Cit3− complex. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, 20 mL of aqueous solution containing 6 mmol of NaF (1 M, 6 mL) and 14 mL of deionized water were added into the above solution to form a colloidal suspension. After additional agitation for 30 min, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL-Teflon vessel, sealed in an autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 10 h. As the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in air at 80 °C for 12 h. NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals with the tuning of structure were prepared by a similar process as described above only by changing the NaF content (6–18 mmol), reaction temperature (120–210 °C), and reaction time (0.5–15 h), respectively.
2.3 Synthesis of Li+ doped NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals
Li+ doped NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using citric acid as a chelating agent. As for the synthesis of the sample with 6 mmol (total amount) of Na+ and Li+, 1 mmol of Ln(NO3)3 (0.79 mmol of Lu(NO3)3 (1 M, 0.79 mL), 0.2 mmol of Yb(NO3)3 (0.5 M, 0.4 mL), and 0.01 mmol of Ho(NO3)3 (0.1 M, 0.1 mL)) were added into an aqueous solution containing 2.5 mmol of citric acid (2 M, 1.25 mL) and 10 mL of deionized water to form the RE-Cit3− complex. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, [20 + (x/4)] mL of mixture containing 6-x mmol of NaF (1 M, 6-x mL), x mmol of LiNO3 (1 M, x mL), x/2 mmol of NH4HF2 (2 M, x/4 mL) and 14 mL of deionized water were added into the above solution to form a colloidal suspension and kept stirring for another 30 min. Finally, the suspension was transferred into a 50 mL-Teflon vessel, sealed in an autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 10 h before leaving to cool naturally. The precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in air at 80 °C overnight. The sample with 8 mmol (total amount) of Na+ and Li+ was prepared by a similar procedure under the same experimental conditions.
2.4 Characterization
The phase and structure of the as-prepared products were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using the D-Max 2200VPC XRD from Rigaku Company. Morphologies and sizes were determined using an Oxford Quanta 400F Thermal Field Emission environmental Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM). UC photoluminescence spectra were recorded using an Edinburgh Instrument FLSP920 combined fluorescence life and steady-state fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 2 W 980 nm laser excitation at a power of 500 mW. The spot size of the 980 nm laser on the samples is ∼0.05 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Factors influencing the structure and the possible formation mechanism
In the following sections, the effects of NaF content, Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the phase and morphology of the final products are investigated in detail. Moreover, the possible formation mechanism for NaLuF4 samples is presented.

3.1.1 Effect of NaF content. 
α-NaLuF4 nanocrystals and β-NaLuF4 microcrystals can be obtained by simply adding different NaF content into the initial solution. The XRD patterns and the corresponding SEM images of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals on adding different NaF content (6, 8, 10, 15, and 18 mmol) at 180 °C for 10 h are shown in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the sample exhibits pure α-NaLuF4 (JCPDS 27-0725) when the NaF content is 6 mmol. The related SEM image [Fig. 2(a)] shows the formation of small cubic nanoparticles. With the NaF content increases to 8 mmol [Fig. 1(b)], β-NaLuF4 phase emerges in addition to the α-NaLuF4 phase, indicating that the sample partially transforms from cubic to hexagonal phase. Correspondingly, a mixture of β-NaLuF4 microprisms with an average length of 8.0 μm and some cubic nanoparticles on the surface of the hexagonal microprisms is presented in Fig. 2(b). The outline of the prisms can be clearly seen in the inset of Fig. 2(b). When the NaF content reaches up to 10 mmol [Fig. 1(c)], the sample is composed of α/β-mixed NaLuF4, and β-NaLuF4 becomes the main phase. The corresponding SEM image [Fig. 2(c)] exhibits two distinct particle morphologies including small nanoparticles (cubic phase) and larger microtubes with a mean length of 18.1 μm (hexagonal phase). From the inset of Fig. 2(c), it can be obviously seen that β-NaLuF4 microcrystals with the hollow structure. With the NaF content further increases to 15 and 18 mmol [Fig. 1(d and e)], the cubic phase disappears completely and only the hexagonal phase exists, indicating that pure β-NaLuF4 (JCPDS 27-0726) can be obtained under these conditions. Fig. 2(d and e) shows that the corresponding samples are irregularly shaped β-NaLuF4 microcrystals. Moreover, the surfaces of the crystals are coarse, as presented in the insets of Fig. 2(e). The above results demonstrate that the change in NaF content plays a key role in determining the phases and shapes of the samples. In our synthesis conditions, NaF is excessive compared with Lu3+. Owing to the strong coordination effect between F− and Lu3+, the excessive F− inevitable capped on the crystal surface.32,33 According to Gibbs–Thompson law, the relative chemical potential of a crystal is simply proportional to its surface-atom ratio, which is determined by the average number of dangling bonds per atom over the entire crystal.34 Due to the capping effect of F−, the average number of dangling bonds and the chemical potential of the crystal (as well as the crystal plane) would decrease. Based on the high anisotropic structure of β-NaLuF4,28 the density of Lu3+ on the {0001} facets is smaller than that on {100} facets, leading to the weak adsorption ability of F− on the {0001} facets. Thus, compared to the {100} facets, the {0001} facets may have the lower chemical potential.32 As a result, the relative growth rate along [0001] direction is much faster than that along [100] direction, resulting in the formation of β-NaLuF4 microcrystals with the large scale. However, when the NaF content increases up to 15 and 18 mmol, indicating 15 and 18 mmol Na+ are added into the initial solution, the irregular and distorted β-NaLuF4 microcrystals can be found. As is known, the excessive Na+ could act as a mineralizer and increase the chemical potential of the solution,35 leading to a dissolution–recrystallization process of β-NaLuF4, and this process would cause the formation of irregular crystals with rough surfaces. This is in good agreement with previous report in the system of β-NaLuF4 microcrystals.36

3.1.2 Effect of Li+ doping. 
In order to study the effect of Li+ on the phase and morphology of NaLuF4 crystals, a series of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nano/micro-crystals doped with different Li+ concentrations were synthesized. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to report Li+ doped α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals and the phase transformation by introducing Li+ in NaLuF4 crystals.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns (a) and the main diffraction peak (b) of different Li+ (0, 5, 10, and 20 mol%) doped α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals prepared with the NaF content of 6 mmol at 180 °C for 10 h. As shown in Fig. 3(a), when the Li+ concentration is lower than 20 mol% (including 20 mol%), all diffraction peaks of the samples can be indexed as pure α-NaLuF4 (JCPDS 27-0725) (the Li+-free sample has been mentioned in the part of ‘Effect of NaF content’). No other impurity peaks are detected, indicating that the low concentration of Li+ doping has no influence on the crystalline phase of α-NaLuF4 nanocrystals. In the cubic lattice, Na+ and Ln3+ occupy the same lattice site [Scheme 1(a)]. When a low content of Li+ doped into the lattice, they may occupy either the lattice sites or interstitial sites. Fig. 3(b) shows that the main diffraction peak moves towards larger angles as the Li+ content increases to 5 mol%, and shifts in reverse when the Li+ content is from 5 to 20 mol%. According to Bragg's law 2dsinθ = nλ (d is the interplanar distance, θ is the diffraction angle, and λ is the diffraction wavelength), d decreases when θ increases, while d increases when θ decreases. Due to the smaller ionic radius of Li+ (0.68 Å) than that of Na+ (0.97 Å), some Na+ can be substituted by Li+ [Scheme 1(c)], causing d decreases; and Li+ may also occupy the interstitial sites of the host lattice [Scheme 1(d)], leading to d increases. Because d is the interplanar distance, the unit cell shrinks when d decreases, and expands as d increases. Thus, the experimental results indicate that the crystal unit cell shrinks when the Li+ content is below 5 mol%, whereas the unit cell expands with higher content from 5 to 20 mol%. Similar results were also obtained in previous report of Li+ doped β-NaYF4 system.24 It is worth to note that the contraction and expansion of unit cell distort the local crystal field around the Ln3+ in the host lattice, perturbing the forbidden transition around Ln3+ and thus affecting their UC emission intensity.37 The SEM images of Fig. 4(a–d) shows that the samples are composed of a great deal of small cubic nanoparticles when the Li+ concentration is 0, 5, 10, and 20 mol% (the Li+-free sample has been mentioned in the part of ‘Effect of NaF content’). Their corresponding average diameters are 129 nm, 172 nm, 195 nm, and 229 nm, respectively. Thus, the size of α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles can be readily tuned by adjusting the doped Li+ concentration. As shown in the insets of Fig. 4(a–d), it can be found that the surfaces of the particles get more and more rough as the Li+ content increases gradually.

Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns (a) and the main diffraction peak (b) of different Li+ doped α/β-mixed NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals prepared with the NaF content of 8 mmol at 180 °C for 10 h. As shown in Fig. 5(a), a mixture of α- and β-phase is obtained without the addition of Li+ (has been shown in Fig. 1(b)). The crystal structure transformation from α/β-mixture to pure β-phase (JCPDS 27-0726) is completed through increasing the Li+ content, and pure β-NaLuF4 can be achieved when the Li+ content reaches to 5 mol%. No other diffraction peaks are detected even the Li+ content increases up to 20 mol%. According to Liu et al.'s report on Gd3+ doped NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, with the increase of Gd3+ dopant content, the phase transformation from cubic to hexagonal (more energetically stable) could occur due to the decrease of the formation energy per atom in cubic phase.17 As for our experimental observations, a small amount of Li+ doping may induce the formation of a stable crystal lattice with pure hexagonal phase in α/β-mixed NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals because of the decreasing formation energy per atom in cubic phase. Fig. 5(b) exhibits that the main diffraction peak moves towards lower angles as the Li+ content increases to 5 mol%, and shifts oppositely when the Li+ content is from 5 to 20 mol%. In the hexagonal lattice, Na+ and Ln3+ occupy the same lattice site due to their similar ionic radius [Scheme 1(b)]. The peak shifting indicates that Li+ dominantly occupy the interstitial sites, and more Na+ can be substituted by Li+ when the Li+ concentration is between 5 and 20 mol% [Scheme 1(e)]. From the above analysis, it is creditable that Li+ can be doped into the host lattice. On doping with the increased Li+ to 40 mol%, the crystal phase transition from hexagonal to cubic is obtained, as presented in the corresponding XRD result. The phase change is caused by a relatively large amount of Li+ doping. When a high content of Li+ doped into the crystal lattice, the imbalance of the crystal structure would be induced, resulting in the distortion of the electron cloud of the ions.38 As a result, Ln3+ cannot coordinate with F− of the same number as in the β-NaLuF4 crystals because of the steric effect, which would lead to the imbalance of hexagonal crystal structure and thus the transformation to cubic phase. Similar phenomenon was also observed in Li+ doped β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals.38 The above XRD results are supported by the corresponding SEM images, as presented in Fig. 6. The Li+-free sample [Fig. 6(a)] consists of small cubic nanoparticles and β-NaLuF4 microprisms with a mean length of 8.0 μm (has been mentioned in the part of ‘Effect of NaF content’). The inset of Fig. 6(a) exhibits that the prisms with scrappy ends, and numerous nanospheres are attached on the surfaces. When the doped Li+ concentration increases from 5 to 20 mol%, NaLuF4 microcrystals with hexagonal structure are shown in Fig. 6(b–d), which are consistent with the corresponding XRD patterns. Furthermore, the inset of Fig. 6(b) presents that the sample with hexagonal structure is composed of microprisms and microrods. The prisms with scrappy ends and concave centers on the top/bottom surfaces have an average size of 5.2 μm in length and 1.8 μm in diameter, and the rods have a mean length of 6.1 μm (Li+ content = 5 mol%). The insets of Fig. 6(c and d) reveal that the corresponding samples are also composed of two distinct morphologies containing hexagonal microprisms and a small quantity of columnar microrods. The average length of the prisms is calculated to be 2.5 μm (Li+ content = 10 mol%) and 2.8 μm (Li+ content = 20 mol%), and the rods is 2.1 and 1.5 μm, respectively. The electron charge density of the crystal surface increases after Li+ doping, and the change of electron charge density can slow the diffusion of negatively charged F− to the crystal surface.17 Thus, as the Li+ content increases from 0 to 10 mol%, the size of NaLuF4 microprisms would decrease due to an increase in charge repulsion. Interestingly, the prisms have the fusiform ends at 20 mol% Li+ doping. According to Zhao's studies on Li+ doped β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ crystals,39 this can be ascribed to the fact that β-NaLuF4 with high anisotropic structure favors a speedy growth along the [0001] direction. By further increasing the Li+ content to 40 mol% [Fig. 6(e)], the morphology changes to small cubic nanospheres with an average diameter of 243 nm. Moreover, the surfaces of the spheres are coarse, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(e).

The insets are their corresponding high-magnification SEM images. Scale bars are 10 μm for (a–d), and 500 nm for (e). 


3.1.3 Effect of reaction temperature. 
As is known, the phase, shape and size of the grown crystals are highly dependent on the environment, especially the reaction temperature.40

Fig. 7 and 8 show the XRD patterns and the corresponding SEM images of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals prepared with the NaF content of 10 mmol for 10 h at different reaction temperature (120 °C, 150 °C, 180 °C and 210 °C), respectively. It can be seen that pure α-NaLuF4 (JCPDS 27-0725) is formed at 120 °C. The corresponding SEM image [Fig. 8(a)] exhibits the formation of small α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles. When the crystals are grown at 150 °C, α/β-mixed phase NaLuF4 appears in the XRD pattern. Fig. 8(b) shows that the corresponding sample is composed of small cubic nanoparticles and short hexagonal microprisms with an average size of 3.5 μm in length. From the inset of Fig. 8(b), it can be found that a large amount of spherical particles is attached on the surfaces of prisms. At higher reaction temperature of 180 °C, the as-obtained product consists of α- and β-NaLuF4 in the XRD pattern (has been shown in Fig. 1(c)). The related SEM image of Fig. 8(c) exhibits the cubic particles and large hexagonal microtubes with an average length of 18.1 μm (has been shown in Fig. 2(c)). After treated at 210 °C, the corresponding XRD result shows that the crystal has a completely pure β phase (JCPDS 27-0726). Correspondingly, larger β-NaLuF4 microtubes with regularity and smooth surfaces can be observed in Fig. 8(d), and the small nanoparticles disappear completely. The average length of the microtubes is 41.5 μm. Obviously, the microcrystals grown at 180 °C and 210 °C have the hollow architecture, as presented in the insets of Fig. 8(c and d). The above results demonstrate that the higher temperature favors the formation rate of nucleation and the crystal growth rate,27 leading to the formation of β-NaLuF4 with large scale.

3.1.4 Effect of reaction time. 
Because the final microcrystal structure of β-NaLuF4 is formed by small components, to understand the growth mechanism of β-NaLuF4 microtubes, a series of time-dependent experiments were carried out.

Fig. 9 shows the XRD patterns of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals prepared with the NaF content of 10 mmol at 210 °C for different reaction times (0.5 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 10 h, and 15 h). As shown, for the sample prepared with a reaction time of 0.5 h and 1 h, only α-NaLuF4 (JCPDS 27-0725) can be obtained. When the reaction time is prolonged to 3 h, a mixture of primary α-NaLuF4 phase and minor β-NaLuF4 phase is formed, indicating that the final product transforms partially from cubic to hexagonal phase with reaction time prolongation. As the reaction time increases to 6 h, the diffraction peaks of β phase dominate on a large scale, and α phase fall sharply. Pure β-NaLuF4 phase can be successfully achieved with the reaction time further increases to 10 h (has been shown in Fig. 7) and 15 h, where all the diffraction peaks can be in good agreement with the standard data (JCPDS 27-0726). It can be concluded that longer reaction time may induce the phase transformation from α to β in the solution-based procedure.30 The XRD results are well supported by the corresponding SEM images, as shown in Fig. 10. From Fig. 10(a and b), it can be seen that when the hydrothermal treatment for 0.5 h and 1 h, the spherical α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles can be formed. However, these cubic particles are unstable. With further reaction, the phase transformation would take place to generate more stable β-NaLuF4 under a dissolution–renucleation process. Thus, as the reaction time prolongs to 3 h and 6 h, a few β-NaLuF4 microtubes with a mean length of 13.9 μm and 30.1 μm are obtained [Fig. 10(c and d)], which is associated with the mixed phases of α- and β-NaLuF4. The outline and hollow structure of the microtubes (small cubic particles attached on the surfaces) can be clearly seen in the insets of Fig. 10(c and d), respectively. Further prolonging the reaction time to 10 h (has been shown in Fig. 8(d)) and 15 h, the as-prepared products consist of uniform hexagonal microtubes with an average size of 41.5 μm and 25.9 μm in length [Fig. 10(e and f)], and small α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles disappear completely. It can be obviously seen that the uniform β-NaLuF4 microtubes with regularity, smooth surfaces and hollow architecture, as shown in the insets of Fig. 10(e and f). Besides, the tube becomes thicker with prolonging the reaction time from 10 h to 15 h. The above results demonstrate that β-NaLuF4 microtubes can be formed through the aggregation of spherical α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles. Unlike the α phase, β-NaLuF4 possesses an anisotropic unit cell structure, resulting in an anisotropic growth along the [0001] direction.28 The hollow structure is produced due to the growth rate at the edges is faster than that at the center. Similar phenomenon was also observed in the system of NaYF4 crystals.27

On the basis of the above analysis, it can be concluded that the NaF content, Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time are important factors for the crystal structure and shape evolution of the products.

3.2 Luminescence properties
To study the effect of NaF content, Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the UC fluorescence emission of the crystals, fluorescence spectra were measured under 980 nm excitation at room temperature.

Fig. 11 shows the UC emission spectra of α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanocrystals (a) and α/β-mixed NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ crystals (b) doped with Li+ at different content. It can be found that the characteristic emission peaks of Ho3+ remain unchanged through Li+ doping. As shown in Fig. 11, two main peaks in the range of 500–700 nm can be observed. Fig. 14 presents the energy-level diagram of Yb3+ and Ho3+ in NaLuF4 as well as the UC mechanisms for green and red emissions. As can be seen, green emission at around 538 nm and red emission at around 644 nm are attributed to the 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. Fig. 11(a) exhibits that the UC emission intensities at around 538 nm and 644 nm are significantly enhanced as the Li+ content increases from 0 to 20 mol%, and the increased magnitude is different between green and red emissions. The maximum intensities of 538 nm and 644 nm emissions are observed in α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanocrystals with 20 mol% Li+ doping, and the intensities are about 20 and 3.5 times than that in un-doped Li+ sample. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the UC emission intensities in both 538 nm and 644 nm are dramatically enhanced as the Li+ content increases to 5 mol%, whereas decreases when Li+ doping at the content of 10–40 mol%. The highest UC emission intensities of 538 nm and 644 nm are obtained in NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ crystals with 5 mol% Li+ doping, and the intensities are calculated to be 26.5 and 23 times than that in Li+-absent sample. As for Li+ doped α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanocrystals, the enhancement of UC emission intensity mainly comes from the fact that Li+ doping can change the surrounding environment of Ho3+ in the crystal field.24 In the NaLuF4 host lattice, the doped Li+ with a small radius can substitute Na+ or occupy interstitial sites, causing the shrink or expansion of the host lattice and thus perturbing the symmetry of the local crystal field around Ho3+. The asymmetric surrounding environment of Ho3+ may lead to the fast energy transfer from the host to the Ho3+,41 consequently increasing the UC luminescence. The maximum UC emission intensity in the sample with 20 mol% Li+ doping is attributed to the most asymmetric surrounding environment around Ho3+, as presented in Fig. 3(b). Similar results were also obtained in the system of Li+ doped β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticles.24 Li+ doping does not cause the phase transformation in α-NaLuF4 nanocrystals, whereas results in the increasing size from 129 nm to 229 nm, which may have a small contribution to the increase of UC luminescence. As for Li+ doped α/β-mixed NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ crystals, the enhancement of UC emission intensity maybe arise from two factors: one is that Li+ doping may cause the breakdown of crystallographic site symmetry; another is that Li+ doping leads to the phase transformation. As is known, NaLuF4 is an excellent UC host material, and β-NaLuF4 crystals have higher fluorescence efficiency than α-NaLuF4 crystals.42 Thus, the highest emission intensity in the sample with 5 mol% Li+ doping is attributed to the most asymmetric surrounding environment of Ho3+ (as shown in Fig. 5(b)) and the crystal structure transformation from α/β-mixture to pure β-phase. When the Li+ content increases from 5 to 20 mol%, the emission intensity decreases, which mainly comes from the decreasing asymmetry of local crystal field, as presented in Fig. 5(b). Besides, with the Li+ content further increases to 40 mol%, the emission intensity sharply decreases due to the crystal phase transition from hexagonal to cubic.

Fig. 12 shows the UC emission spectra (normalized to Ho3+ 644 nm emission) (a) and the corresponding chromatic coordinates (b) of α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanocrystals doped with Li+ at different concentration. As shown in Fig. 12(a), the relative intensity of green emission is enhanced distinctly as the Li+ content increases from 0 to 20 mol%. The inset of Fig. 12(a) exhibits that the green-to-red (G/R) ratio is improved significantly with the Li+ content increases gradually. The G/R ratio of α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanocrystals with 20 mol% Li+ doping (G/R = 2.04) is about 5.7 times higher than that of the un-doped Li+ sample (G/R = 0.36). Consequently, Li+ doping can improve the G/R ratio, resulting in the enhancement of the relative brightness of green emission. The CIE chromaticity diagram and the corresponding calculated chromatic coordinates are shown in Fig. 12(b), it can be found that the color point moves from the saffron yellow region (0.488, 0.504) to the green region (0.318, 0.669) when Li+ doping at the content of 0–20 mol%.

The inset of (a) shows the dependence of the G/R ratio on the concentration of Li+. 

Fig. 13 shows the UC emission spectra of NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ crystals prepared with the NaF content of 10 mmol for 10 h at different reaction temperatures (a) and NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ crystals prepared with the NaF content of 10 mmol at 210 °C for different reaction times (b). It can be seen that the emission spectra of the samples are similar in shape, and the only difference between the bands is their intensities. As shown in Fig. 13(a), β-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ microtubes obtained after being treated at 210 °C have the highest UC emission intensity, and strong green emission can be observed under 980 nm excitation. However, the small cubic nanoparticles grown at 120 °C show the lowest intensity. Fig. 13(b) presents that the maximum intensity can be gained in β-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ microtubes with large scale after 10 h hydrothermal treatment, while α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanoparticles treated for 0.5 h and 1 h with the weakest intensity. The difference in the emission intensity is ascribed to different phases of the samples. As mentioned above, NaLuF4 is an excellent UC host material, and β-NaLuF4 offers the enhanced fluorescence efficiency compared with its cubic phase counterpart. The higher temperature and longer reaction time are favorable for the transition from the α-phase to the β-phase in the solution-based procedure, and the proportion of the β-phase increases with an increase of reaction temperature and hydrothermal treatment time. Thus, the UC fluorescence intensity of NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ crystals is dramatically improved.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the influences of NaF content, Li+ doping, reaction temperature and reaction time on the phase and shape of the as-synthesized NaLuF4 crystals were investigated systematically. A possible formation mechanism for the phase evolution process of NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ is also presented. To the best of our knowledge, we first report Li+ doped α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals and the phase transformation by introducing Li+ in NaLuF4 crystals. As for Li+ doped α-NaLuF4, the phase transformation does not occur, whereas Li+ doping leads to the increasing size of the particles from 129 nm to 229 nm. UC luminescence intensities of green emission (538 nm) and red emission (644 nm) in α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ nanocrystals doped with 20 mol% Li+ are enhanced by 20 and 3.5 times compared to their Li+-absent counterpart, which can be attributed to the fact that Li+ doping causes the reduced local crystal field symmetry around Ho3+. As for Li+ doped α/β-mixed NaLuF4, with the increase of Li+ content, the phase transforms from the α/β-mixed phase to hexagonal then to cubic. UC emissions of 538 nm and 644 nm in NaLuF4:Yb3+,Ho3+ crystals doped with 5 mol% Li+ are enhanced by 26.5 and 23 times, which can be ascribed to the fact that Li+ doping induces the breakdown of crystallographic site symmetry and the phase transformation. Moreover, the G/R ratio in α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,1%Ho3+ nanocrystals with 20 mol% Li+ doping is about 5.7 times higher than that of un-doped Li+ sample, resulting in the increase of relative brightness of green emission. Besides, it is found that with the higher temperature and prolonged time, the phase of NaLuF4 transforms from cubic to hexagonal, and the morphology changes from nanoparticles to microtubes, which results in the sharp increase of UC emission intensity. The effects of reaction temperature and time on the enhanced UC emission are discussed in detail. As a result of their controllable structures and unique luminescence properties, these phosphors may have potential applications in optoelectronic devices.
