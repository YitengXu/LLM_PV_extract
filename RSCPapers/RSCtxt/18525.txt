    , Accepted 18th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractA simple, facile and visible light driven photochemical synthesis of 2-substituted benzothiazoles and 2-substituted benzimidazoles is achieved with CdSe nanocomposites as a photocatalyst. These nanocomposites are prepared by the molecular self assembly of 2–3 nm sized zinc blende CdSe phase within the layers of montmorillonite (MMT) through intercalation forming lamellar structure. CdSe/MMT exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity towards the synthesis of benzazoles using aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes with better yields, and the efficiency is retained up to five cycles. XRD, XPS and Raman analyses of fresh and used CdSe/MMT reveal the passivation of structural defects due to the formation of a thin layer of CdO on the photocatalyst surface. The mixed phase of CdSe–CdO facilitates the generation of a hetero-junction on the CdSe/MMT surface, which is beneficial for photostability and sustainability. This process is also efficient under solar light and provides easy product isolation on the gram scale. Thus, it may be regarded as a greener methodology for the synthesis of bioactive scaffolds with excellent yields and high chemoselectivity using a tailor-made photocatalyst.
Introduction
Recently, the efficient harvesting and effective utilization of solar energy through a photocatalytic process has become a prime aspect of various scientific developments.1 It has encouraged several researchers to investigate visible light driven organic transformations using a heterogeneous catalyst that affords high yield of the desired product with minimum leaching of catalyst.2 Such a pragmatic shift has arisen due to ever increasing environmental concerns as conventional chemical processes utilize hazardous reagents that ultimately generate secondary toxic wastes. Photocatalysis is a process that explores the potentiality of a photocatalyst, which besides absorbing light can efficiently bring about the organic transformations with high selectivity.3 It spans the large spectrum of applications that include the environmental remediation of aquatic pollutants,4 splitting of H2O for the generation of H2,5 photochemical reduction of CO2,6 solar cells7 which are considered as clean, green and eco-friendly as well as sustainable alternative processes. One such area that has been explored extensively centers around the visible light induced activation of the C–H bond8 as well as C–C, C–N or C–S bond formation9–11 through photogenerated radicals in the presence of a photocatalyst. Designing of a tailor-made photocatalyst is a key towards improved quantum efficiency and its subsequent utilization in these processes. This strategy may be achieved via tuning the band gap of semiconducting nanoparticles and dispersing them in a media thereby forming a heterogeneous nanocomposite.
There are several advantages of nanocomposites: (i) increased surface area, (ii) generation of distinct reactive sites that are beneficial for the efficient absorption of visible light, (iii) uniform dispersion of nanoparticles within solid support that hinders their agglomeration, (iv) electron–hole recombination may be suppressed, (v) strong adsorption capacity of support improves the substrate–photocatalyst interaction via adsorption thereby enhancing the rate of photochemical reaction, and (vi) photo-corrosion of photocatalyst surface may be inhibited. Therefore, they can be used successfully for subsequent reactions without compromising their photocatalytic efficiency.12 These facets result in the development of synergism in nanoparticle–support interactions through the formation of a bi-functional photocatalyst that possesses desired photocatalytic activity for beneficial applications.
To investigate this hypothesis, we have designed a photocatalyst that comprises CdSe nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in montmorillonite (MMT) clay matrix and evaluated its activity towards visible light assisted organic transformations. Three aspects are envisaged: (i) CdSe, being an n-type semiconductor with a band gap (1.65–1.8 eV)13 in the visible region, can efficiently function as a light harvesting site, (ii) formation of lamellar structure with MMT14 and (iii) beneficial adsorption capacity and presence of acidic sites on MMT may enhance the rate of photochemical reaction. Although toxic effects of CdSe NPs are major concern to the environment and human beings, cytotoxicity can be controlled through their surface modification and formation of core–shell structure. Due to formation of such a tailor-made nanocomposite, it is expected that the association of CdSe NPs and MMT would generate synergism in their bonding and result in better photocatalytic activity towards organic transformation. Moreover, MMT is inexpensive, thermally and chemically stable and a photochemically inert material. This proposition is evaluated for visible light induced photochemical synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles.
Benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles, N-containing heterocylic derivatives, exhibit a broad range of biological activities that include antitumor,15 antiulcer,16 anti-HIV17 and antihypertensive.18 These compounds are commonly synthesized by the condensation of aryl 1,2-diamines/thioamine either with carboxylic acids in the presence of an acid or aldehydes with an oxidant. These conversions can be achieved via a catalytic route involving various catalysts like PTSA,19 H2O2/CAN,20 FeCl3/MMT K-10,21 ZrOCl2·8H2O,22 Co(OH)2/CoO,23 1,4-benzoquinone,24 Au/CeO2,25 and nano α-MoO3/TBHP.26 Although these methods are efficient, use of the stoichiometric excess of reagents, cost of the catalyst, prolonged reaction time, occurrence of side reactions, severe reaction conditions, strong oxidizing nature of the reagents and selectivity towards 2-substituted derivatives are some of the environmental concerns of these protocols. Therefore, it is imperative to design a synthetic strategy that involves an eco-friendly approach, wherein the effective utilization of visible light in the presence of a catalyst can be conveniently employed for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzothiazoles and benzimidazoles. For example, green synthesis of these derivatives is achieved in the presence of a dye with visible light.27 Moreover, visible light induced photocatalytic radical cyclization with [Ru(bipy)3]2+ and O2 is carried out using thioanilides.28a These reactions are also reported with heterogeneous photocatalysts such as mesoporous graphite carbon nitride,29 CdS nanosphere,30 nano-TiO2,31 and Pt@TiO2.32
In the present investigation, we report a one-pot methodology that comprises both condensation and photocyclisation with homogeneously dispersed CdSe NPs in MMT matrix. It is also observed that there exists synergism within the photo-nanocomposite framework that enhances the rate of photochemical reaction with quantitative conversion towards 2-substituted benzothiazoles and benzimidazoles.
Experimental
Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. Cadmium acetate (Cd(OAc)2·2H2O (Loba Chemie, UK), selenium powder (Loba Chemie, UK), cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, Sigma Aldrich), montmorillonite K-10 (Fluka), sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Loba Chemie, UK), aldehydes, 2-aminothiophenol and o-phenylenediamine (Sigma Aldrich) were used in this study. Pre-coated TLC plates (silica gel 60 F254) and column grade silica gel (mesh 100–200) were purchased from Merck, India.
Pretreatment of MMT
MMT clay was digested with excess 1 M NaCl solution for 24 h at 60 °C, and the solid was filtered, washed with acetone and dried at 50 °C. The powder was dispersed in distilled water to prepare the colloidal suspension of clay particles and kept overnight. It was filtered, washed with distilled water and acetone and finally dried under vacuum.
Synthesis of CdSe NPs
0.3 g of NaBH4 in 5 mL water was added to 0.78 g Se in 5 mL water to obtain the wine red coloured solution of sodium hydrogen selenide (NaHSe). In another flask, an aqueous solution of cadmium acetate (1.3 g in 10 mL water) was mixed with 10 mL CTAB (0.02 M) solution. To this mixture, NaHSe solution was added dropwise with constant stirring at 40 °C, and the resulting mixture was kept stirring for 1 h. Wine red coloured product was centrifuged at 3000 rpm, successively washed with methanol and then dried under vacuum.
Preparation of CdSe/MMT nanocomposite
0.2 g of CdSe NPs dispersed in 15 mL distilled water was sonicated for 4 h. This solution was added to an aqueous suspension of 1.8 g Na-MMT in 10 mL of water, and the entire suspension was stirred at 40 °C for 2 h. The wine red mixture was filtered, washed successively with distilled water and finally with acetone and the product was dried under vacuum. This resulted in 10% CdSe/MMT nanocomposite, and a similar procedure was adopted for the preparation of 5% and 15% compositions with appropriate amounts of CdSe NPs and MMT (ESI Fig. S1†).
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were obtained on a Phillips X'pert MPD X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL electron microscope (model 1200X). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a VG Micro Tech ESCA3000 instrument using Mg Kα radiation (photo energy 1253.6 eV). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis was performed using a nitrogen adsorption method with surface analyzer system CHEMBET3000, Quantichrome Instruments, U.S. Raman spectra were obtained on a Horiba JY LabRAM HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer operating at 17 mW and 632.8 nm excitation wavelength. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the excitation wavelength of 450 nm. ICP-OES measurements were carried out on Optima 7000 DV ICP-OES Spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). A tungsten lamp (35 W) equipped with a cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as a visible light source. Quantum yields of photochemical reactions were measured using ferrioxalate actinometry (ESI†). 1H NMR (400 MHz and 500 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz and 125 MHz) spectra of synthesized derivatives were obtained on Bruker AV 400 and AV 500 spectrometers either in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm from tetramethylsilane and instrument internally referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS), chloroform or dimethylsulfoxide signals. Reported data is as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s; singlet, d; doublet, t; triplet, q; quartet, m; multiplet, dd; doublet of doublet, br. s.; broad singlet), coupling constants in Hertz (Hz). Melting points were recorded on a melting point apparatus (Mettler Toledo) and were uncorrected.
General procedure for the photochemical synthesis of 2-substituted benzothiazole
A mixture of aldehyde (10 mmol), 2-aminothiophenol (10 mmol) and catalyst (5 mg) in ethanol (30 mL) was taken in a 100 mL double-walled quartz photoreactor equipped with water chiller (ESI Fig. S2†) to maintain the temperature of the reaction vessel. The reaction medium was exposed to visible light (35 W Tungsten lamp) for an appropriate time under constant stirring at room temperature. After the completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated by centrifugation and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate) to yield 2-substituted benzothiazoles.
General procedure for the photochemical synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazole
A similar procedure was adopted for the synthesis of 2-substituted benimidazole with aldehyde (10 mmol), o-phenylenediamine (10 mmol) and catalyst (5 mg) in ethanol (30 mL).
Reusability studies
The recycling experiments were carried out with recovered nanocomposite. After each photochemical reaction, the catalyst was separated by simple centrifugation, and washed successively with ethanol and acetone to remove the adsorbed organic compounds. This recovered catalyst was used for subsequent cycles under identical experimental conditions, and the products were isolated using column chromatography.
Results and discussion
The synthetic strategy adopted in the present investigation is based on the concept of modification of clay with a surfactant that results in the formation of expanded lamellar structure of clay. Logically, CTAB capped CdSe NPs may be intercalated within layers of MMT structure so as to fabricate an inorganic–organic hybrid material with increased layer spacing of MMT (ESI Fig. S1†). Such an approach would result in generating distinct reactive sites (CdSe) not only on the MMT surface but also within its layers, and it may enhance photocatalytic efficiency of the nanocomposite.
Characterization of nanocomposites
The interaction of MMT with CdSe NPs is characterized using X-ray diffraction studies to ascertain the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles within the MMT matrix (Fig. 1). It is observed that the peak corresponding to the layered clay structure of MMT occurring at 7.8° due to (001) plane is significantly broadened and shifted to a lower angle (4.6°) for CdSe/MMT nanocomposite. Such shift attributes to enlargement in the lamellar structure due to the insertion of CdSe NPs within MMT layers through intercalation and their uniform distribution in the clay matrix. On the other hand, the CdSe region exhibited three characteristic peaks at 25.3°, 42.7° and 50.6° corresponding to (111), (220) and (311) reflections of the zinc blende structure of CdSe NPs (JCPDS file no. 19-0191), which remained unchanged after composite formation with MMT. The spherically shaped CdSe NPs of 2–3 nm size are found to be homogeneously dispersed within layered clay support (Fig. 2).

The specific surface area of Na-MMT, CdSe NPs, 5% and 10% CdSe/MMT is found to be 34, 24.4, 68.9 and 177.0 m2 g−1, respectively. Higher value 10% CdSe doped MMT implies that the nanocomposite formation leads to generation of mesoporous structure. CdSe NPs exhibit an emission band at 572 nm, while 10% CdSe/MMT composite displays a band at 528 nm (ESI Fig. S3†). The blue shift for composites is probably due to intercalated MMT sheets as well as surface defects inducing the dissipation of absorbed energy.
Photocatalytic activity of CdSe/MMT nanocomposite
To optimize reaction conditions, the synthesis of 2-phenylbenzothiazole (3a) from 2-aminothiophenol and benzaldehyde is chosen as a model reaction in ethanol (Table 1).

Initially, 5 mg of CdSe NPs is used as a photocatalyst that resulted in 48% of 3a under visible light irradiation within 0.5 h (entry 1). Using nanocomposites (entries 2–4), it is observed that the yield of 3a has been significantly enhanced up to 94% by sequential increase in CdSe loading on MMT with 10% loading (entry 3) found to be adequate with 93% conversion within 0.5 h. In addition, 5 mg of catalyst is sufficient to bring about maximum conversion to 3a (entries 5–7). Moreover, an imine intermediate is obtained when the reaction is carried out with MMT alone (ESI Fig. S4†), and further it does not proceed towards the formation of 3a. These results clearly suggested that there exists significant contribution from both homogeneously dispersed CdSe NPs and MMT support that results in efficient conversion through stronger adsorption and photochemical cyclisation in a synergistic manner. Thus, it may be argued that CdSe-MMT composite provides a nano-heterogeneous center for the condensation of aldehyde and amine leading to an imine intermediate that simultaneously undergoes photocyclisation on the catalytic surface. After screening different solvents for the photochemical reaction, better yield is obtained with ethanol (ESI, Table T1†).
With these optimized conditions, we investigated the scope and functional group compatibility of the visible-light driven photocatalytic synthesis of 2-substituted benzothiazoles using 2-aminothiophenol (1) and aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes (Table 2). It is noted that the formation of benzothiazoles is faster with heterocyclic aldehydes, while longer time is required for aliphatic aldehydes. Such a feature could be ascribed to a stronger adsorption tendency of heterocyclic substrates on the acidic sites of MMT as compared to aliphatic compounds, and consequently this step happens to be crucial towards the photocyclization process. These compounds are obtained in good yields (98–83%) within 20–55 min with quantum yields ranging from 32.00 to 14.55%. Heterocyclic aryl aldehydes possessing either a nitrogen or sulfur atom are efficiently converted to the corresponding benzothiazoles (3j and 3k) in excellent yields (Table 2, entries 10 and 11). On the other hand, there seems to be less influence of substituents present on aromatic aldehyde (entries 1–9), wherein % yield and exposure time is similar; however, slight alteration is observed with hydroxyl, methoxy or nitro derivatives (entries 3, 4 and 6). It is reported that during the photochemical synthesis of halo-benzothiazoles, the dehalogenation of aldehyde results in the formation of mixtures of the desired product and dehalogenated benzothiazoles.28 However, CdSe/MMT nanocomposite selectively converts halo-substituted aldehydes to corresponding halo-benzothiazoles (3g–3i) without the de-halogenation step (entries 7–9). Thus, it may be argued that the stronger chemisorption of aldehydes on the catalytic surface induces facile electron transfer thereby promoting the radical cyclization of imine intermediate to the corresponding cyclic product. Such a tandem process is necessarily occurring because of a stronger association of CdSe NPs within the MMT matrix that favors the photochemical cyclization step in a synergistic manner. However, aliphatic aldehyde seems to be less active towards cyclization as this conversion requires almost 60 min (Table 2, entries 12 and 13). Further assessment of photocatalytic activity of CdSe/MMT can be vouched from TON and TOF characteristics, which are found to be significantly higher for heterocyclic aldehydes (entries 10 and 11), while lowest values are obtained for aliphatic aldehydes (entries 12 and 13). Within aromatic aldehydes, it is observed that the presence of strong adsorbing groups like hydroxyl, methoxy and nitro on clay support favor better conversion with excellent TOF and TON values. Moreover, these values are found to be better as compared to dye27 and CdS30 catalysed photochemical synthesis of 2-substituted benzothiazoles.

Adopting the same strategy, we also investigated the potentiality of CdSe/MMT towards the photochemical synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazoles (Table 3) using aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes with o-phenylenediamine. However, this conversion required a longer reaction time (1.5–3 h), and yields are comparatively lower (94–68%) with quantum yields ranging from 8.88 to 4.44%. It is probably due to the slower generation of the biradical on imine intermediate as a consequence of lesser tendency of amine functionality for radical formation as compared to thiol moiety. As observed earlier, the reactivity of heterocyclic aldehydes is found to be better as compared to aliphatic aldehydes. For example, 2j and 2k yielded corresponding benzimidazoles within 1.5 h (entries 3 and 4), while similar time is required for the conversion of nitro-aromatic aldehyde with an excellent yield (entry 2). The order of TON and TOF values for different aldehydes used in the synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazoles is found to be heterocyclic > aromatic > aliphatic. We have also explored the photocatalytic efficiency of 10% CdSe/MMT under solar light, wherein the synthesis of benzazoles is carried out under sunlight (Table 4). The reaction time is found to be comparatively more than visible light with lesser % yields of benzothiazoles (71–83) and benzimidazoles (67–78). However, these conversions are achieved within shorter time with less amount of catalyst as compared to those reported in the literature.28

Reusability study
The beneficial activity of the photocatalyst can be judged from its successive utilization in photochemical reaction, since it is quite likely that the catalyst surface undergoes photo-corrosion during continuous exposure to light. This aspect is evaluated for the synthesis of 3a and 4a, wherein the catalyst recovered after the 1st cycle is used for subsequent four cycles (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that % yield of these products is not significantly lowered even after five cycles. This observation clearly suggests that the catalyst surface remains active after exposure to light during successive cycles; although slight lowering in the yield may be due to the formation of an oxide layer on the surface. Moreover, the amount of Cd and Se leached from the CdSe/MMT surface after the fifth cycle is found to be extremely low (2.6 and 4.7 ppb) implying that our photocatalyst may be used in a continuous process.

Evaluation of surface properties
To understand the structural changes that have occurred on the catalyst surface during continuous exposure to visible light, we have carried out post-characterization of the recovered photocatalyst after five cycles using XRD, XPS and Raman analyses. It can be seen from the XRD pattern of used 10% CdSe/MMT (Fig. 4b) that the peak positions corresponding to zinc blende structure remain unchanged, although slight broadening is observed for (002) peak probably due to the formation of structural defects on the surface induced by absorption of visible light. This feature is further established by XPS analysis, since this technique is useful in identifying (i) elemental composition of the surface, (ii) their percentage composition and (iii) the exact nature of the respective elements.33 The deconvoluted Cd features for fresh 10% CdSe/MMT comprises two main peaks at 405.85 and 412.71 eV due to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively (Fig. 5a), while the corresponding Se 3d peak is observed at 54.43 eV (Fig. 5d), which are concurrent with those reported for bulk CdSe.34,35 These characteristic peaks primarily originate from the presence of different chemical species of Cd and Se on the nanocomposite surface. For example, the nature of Cd present on the surface of the catalyst can be of two types: (i) Cd bound to Se (Cda) and (ii) Cd bound to other elements (Cdb).36 With this assumption, we have estimated the Cdb/Cda ratio from the integrated Cd 3d signal intensities for fresh and reused 10% CdSe/MMT composite (ESI Table T2†). For fresh catalyst, this ratio is found to be 0.49 that drastically changed to 2.2 for used catalyst, which indicates that the surface of reused nanocomposite is approximately four times richer with Cd ions bound to other atoms. Moreover, the oxygen content of used catalyst (CdSe0.31O0.69) is almost doubled as compared to fresh catalyst (CdSe0.67O0.33) implying the formation of a thin layer of CdO due to light induced surface oxidation of the catalyst.37 This phenomenon is further substantiated by analyzing the oxygen region. The oxygen content arises mainly from (i) adsorbed water, (ii) surface hydroxyl groups on MMT and (iii) oxide, which are observed at 531.6, 533.4 and 532.6 eV, respectively. Out of these, the third peak is ascribed to the formation of a CdO layer whose intensity (ESI Fig. S5†) is increased by almost two times for used catalyst at the expense of a decrease in the intensity for the peak corresponding to absorbed water. Thus, it may be argued that during the photochemical process, the CdSe surface is continuously oxidized during successive cycles resulting in the development of a mixed phase comprising of n-type CdSe and p-type CdO species present on the catalyst surface. This leads to the generation of a p–n type of hetero-junction on the catalyst surface, wherein the continuous flow of electrons from the CdSe core to this junction results in retaining the photocatalytic activity even after five successive cycles. To further address this aspect, we have calcined fresh 10% CdSe/MMT at 100 °C for 3 h, and the residue thus obtained is evaluated for its photocatalytic activity towards the synthesis of 3a. It is observed that its yield is decreased by 20%, implying that the oxide layer indeed influence the photocatalytic activity of CdSe/MMT nanocomposites. Moreover, XPS analysis of the calcined photocatalyst revealed the presence of an additional peak (Fig. 5c) corresponding to Cd bound to oxygen; where, the oxygen content is found to be almost the same (ESI Fig. S5c†) as that of the used catalyst. It implies that the presence of a thin layer of CdO on CdSe also passivates the surface defects as well as immobilizes these charge carriers within the CdSe core38,39 that accounts for better photostability and excellent photocatalytic efficiency of the CdSe/MMT nanocomposite.

CdSe nanoparticles exhibit two characteristic Raman peaks corresponding to longitudinal-optical mode and 2LO photon scattering at 208 and 431 cm−1, respectively.40 Upon nanocomposite formation with MMT, the former peak remains unaltered, while the latter peak is shifted to the lower energy side (413 cm−1) with broadened nature due to the relaxation of momentum conservation as a consequence of the homogeneous dispersion of CdSe NPs within the MMT matrix (Fig. 6a). Although the position of both these bands for reused catalyst does not undergo any significant change, peak broadening is observed with 2LO photon peak (Fig. 6b). This change is evaluated from FWHM of fresh (Fig. 6a) and recycled photocatalyst (Fig. 6b) wherein it is observed that there exists significant enhancement in FWHM (by 30 cm−1) for 2LO photon peak (Fig. 6; inset). Such a feature can be ascribed to passivation of the photocatalyst surface due to the formation of a Raman inactive thin layer of CdO on CdSe core. It implies that longitudinal oscillations on the catalyst surface are responsible for negative photon dispersion that ultimately retains the photocatalytic activity even after continuous exposure to light.41 Thus, it may be argued that the modification of the CdSe/MMT catalyst after continuous exposure to light results in the formation of a robust p–n junction through the passivation of surface structural defects. These features account for the better photostability and excellent photocatalytic efficiency of CdSe/MMT nanocomposites afforded by synergism in CdSe and MMT structures.

To highlight our study, we compared the photocatalytic activity of different heterogeneous photocatalysts that are explored for the synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles under visible light (Table 5). Inspection of this table reveals that these conversions are achieved at reasonably higher irradiation time either with high power or solar light and high catalyst loading.29–32 However, in our case, 10% CdSe/MMT exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity with good yields in less time. The isolated yields are reported for Ag and Pt-doped TiO2, wherein reaction time and catalyst loading is significantly higher as compared to our photocatalyst.31 Although, appropriate comparison can be made with unsupported CdS nanospheres,30 the synthesis of only benzothiazoles is reported with 5 mg of catalyst and a high wattage Xenon lamp. It implies that 10% CdSe/MMT photocatalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic properties due to (a) stronger light absorption capability of CdSe sites that are uniformly dispersed in MMT structure, (b) Lewis acidity of MMT is beneficial for the better adsorption of reactants, and (c) the synergistic association of CdSe and MMT leads to the formation of a bifunctional nature of the photocatalyst. These features are further corroborated with the formation of a photoresponsive p–n junction that accounts for the recycling capability of this nanocomposite.

The plausible mechanism of the visible light induced synthesis of imidazoles and thiazoles is outlined in Scheme 1. This process consists of three steps: (i) formation of imine intermediate, (ii) radical generation and subsequent cyclization and (iii) aerobic oxidation of cyclized intermediate. Since the first step normally requires an acidic condition, it is observed that acidic sites present on MMT are beneficial for imine(I) formation through the adsorptive association of amine and aldehyde on the catalyst surface. Visible light induced generation of radicals is known to be a critical and rate determining step that affects overall conversion to the desired product. In our case, formation of radicals seems to be easier due to the presence of n-type CdSe sites, wherein electron transfer from CdSe to adsorbed imine intermediate is supposed to be faster. Moreover, the stabilization of radical (II) is essential as it accounts for better yield in less time. Although generation of radical on imine functionality seems to occur in an almost identical manner for both imidazoles and thiazoles, formation of radicals on thiol and amine centers is the key factor towards the formation of their respective products. Since the generation of the radical and its stabilization is easier with a sulphur center, the formation of benzothiazoles is achieved in less time with good yields. Moreover, radical cation (II) generation on sulphur and subsequent absorption of liberated electrons by positively charged holes (h+) contributes to an improved rate of photochemical reaction. On the other hand, formation of a biradical on the benzimidazole intermediate seems to be less favored and time dependent, and longer reaction times are required for the photochemical synthesis of benzimidazoles. Thus, it may be argued that the formation of biradicals on imine intermediates is more pronounced for thiol as compared to amine, which is driven by electron donor n-type CdSe sites present on the photocatalytic surface. Finally, aerobic oxidation is essential for the formation of the heterocyclic compound as we could not obtain the desired product under oxygen free (inert) condition; rather imine intermediate is obtained (ESI Fig. S6†). This observation has also been reported for the synthesis of benzothiazoles.28b

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a simple, facile and environmentally benign methodology for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles under visible light using nano-engineered CdSe/MMT as a photocatalyst. The versatility of these nanocomposites can be ascertained by the radical cyclization of imine intermediates formed with aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes at faster rates through efficient absorption of visible light. This behavior is reflected in its repetitive usage, wherein the catalytic activity is marginally reduced during five successive cycles even after prolonged exposure to light. It is established that photocorrosion is inhibited due to the generation of a thin layer of CdO on the catalyst surface, wherein structural defects of zinc blende structure of CdSe is passivated via the formation of a p–n heterojunction on the catalyst surface. These features are manifested due to synergistic interaction between CdSe sites and MMT support within the nanocomposite structure. Thus, the present study clearly demonstrates that the photochemical process for the synthesis of biologically active scaffolds can be achieved by the principles of green chemistry using renewable resources like visible light, air, and an environmentally benign solvent in a highly atom-economical and energy-efficient manner.
