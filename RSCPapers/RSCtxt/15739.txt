    , Accepted 5th June 2023First published on 5th June 2023AbstractCo-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O to produce fuels using proton-conducting electrolysis cells (PCECs) is a promising technology for effective CO2 utilization. The direct production of hydrocarbon fuels using PCECs, nevertheless, remains challenging, and the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation during electrolysis is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate surface engineering as an effective strategy for promoting the CO2/H2O co-electrolysis to produce CH4 using PCECs. A thin CeO2 layer is impregnated selectively onto the BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (BZCYYb) surface of a Ni-BZCYYb fuel electrode. The PCEC with a CeO2-modified electrode exhibited more than 3 times CH4 selectivity at 550 °C and 1250 mA cm−2 than the cell with a pristine electrode. The combination of advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations demonstrates that the decorated CeO2 modulates the adsorption of reactants and facilitates proton transfer for the hydrogenation process, leading to accelerated CH4 production. The result provides critical insight into the rational design of high-performance catalysts for other high temperature electrochemical devices.

Broader context
Low cost and efficient large-scale energy storage technology is key to the implementation of renewable energy sources and advanced nuclear power. The co-electrolysis of CO2/H2O using proton-conducting electrolysis cells (PCECs) has attracted great attention as a promising approach to achieve the goal of power-to-X (H2, syngas or hydrocarbons) due to its unparalleled conversion efficiency at intermediate temperatures (400–700 °C). However, at present, it is still challenging to obtain high value-added products (i.e., CH4, C2H6, etc.) from the CO2/H2O co-electrolysis in PCECs, and the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on the electrode surface is still ambiguous. This paper reports surface engineering as an effective strategy for promoting the CO2/H2O co-electrolysis to produce CH4 using PCECs, achieving triple CH4 selectivity by simple CeO2 impregnation. The scientific findings obtained here provide guidelines for the development of highly active catalysts for other reactions such as photo/electrochemical/thermal water splitting and CO2 reduction.

Introduction
Renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and advanced nuclear power have developed significantly over the past decades.1–3 The produced electricity, nevertheless, still faces challenges of storage and transport. Using H2O and/or CO2 as the feeding gases and electricity from renewable energy sources and nuclear plants as the driving force, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) can achieve the goal of power-to-X (H2, syngas or hydrocarbons) with high efficiency and high rate.4–9 Different from the traditional oxygen-ion conducting SOECs (O-SOECs), proton-conducting electrolysis cells (PCECs) mainly conduct protons and have higher ionic conductivity, offering an opportunity for operation at low temperatures (400–600 °C).10–12 In addition, the separation of H2O from the produced H2 during the electrolysis process could reduce the cost of gas purification.10,13,14
While numerous works have confirmed that PCECs exhibited high efficiency for water electrolysis to produce dry hydrogen,10,15,16 CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using PCECs is less investigated. The relatively lower operation temperature of PCECs, in principle, makes the hydrogenation of CO2 to produce hydrocarbon possible.14,17,18 Nevertheless, most works still reported CO as the main product for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction in PCECs with negligible production of hydrocarbons. For example, Xie et al. used Fe as the CO2 fuel electrode and Ni-BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.16Zn0.04O3−δ as the oxygen electrode of PCECs for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis.19 They reported a CH4 selectivity of 1.8% with a current density of 1.5 A cm−2 at 614 °C. Duan et al. applied Ni-BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ-based PCECs for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis, and obtained a CH4 selectivity of around 6% at 550 °C.17 The same research group further improved the CH4 selectivity to 11% under the same conditions by optimizing the cell configuration and operation parameters.20 To promote the further hydrogenation of CO2 to form hydrocarbons, several research groups introduced noble-catalysts in the fuel electrode. Dimitrios et al. demonstrated that Ru nanoparticles supported on Co3O4 can generate metal–support interactions that promoted CH4 production in PCECs. They obtained a CH4 selectivity of 20% at 440 °C.21 Li et al. infiltrated Ir clusters onto Sm2O3-doped-CeO2 (SDC) and used it as the fuel electrode of PCECs for CO2 electrolysis. By using hydrogen gas as the feeding gas, the cell exhibited a CH4 selectivity higher than 50%.22 A noble-metal-free electrode with good CO2 hydrogenation reaction activity for hydrocarbon production is still to be developed.
Despite all the pioneering works on electrode development mentioned above, the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on the electrode surface of PCECs is still not well-understood. Shi et al. used Ni-BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ (Ni-BZY) supported PCECs for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis and analyzed the intermediate species in the CO2 hydrogenation process by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) and in situ Raman Spectroscopy. They speculated that electrochemically driven protons promoted CO2 molecules to form –OCO– intermediates and ultimately CO on the surface of Ni-BZY.23 Nevertheless, the input of excess hydrogen gas (80% H2 in the fuel electrode) makes it difficult to distinguish the impact of different hydrogen sources. Li et al. reported that different selectivities of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction on the Ir-modified SDC surface are due to the difference in CO adsorption energy.22 For the rational design of the high-performance PCEC electrode for direct electrochemical hydrogenation of CO2 to form hydrocarbons, it is necessary to reveal the reaction mechanism on the electrode surface and identify the key material characteristics that determine the reaction selectivity.
In this work, we adopt a simple infiltration approach to deposit CeO2 selectively on the BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (BZCYYb) surface of the Ni-BZCYYb fuel electrode, achieving a three-fold increase in CH4 selectivity at 550 °C and 1250 mA cm−2 for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using PCECs. Several advanced spectroscopic techniques, including in situ DRIFTS, temperature programmed desorption (TPD), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and synchrotron-based X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS), in-combination confirm that the CeO2 modification layer effectively promotes the formation of C–H reaction intermediates and modulates the adsorption of CO2 and CO on the surface. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results imply that the CeO2 surface exhibits a noticeably lower energy barrier for the further hydrogenation of CO, and weaker hydrogen-bonding and CO adsorption, which are the key factors in promoting the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane. Our results provide critical insight into the role of surface properties in determining the electrode activity towards the electrochemical hydrogenation of CO2 at elevated temperature, which can guide the design of high-performance electrode materials for PCECs.
Results and discussion
The working principle of using PCECs for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis is shown in Fig. 1a. While water vapor was injected on the surface of the oxygen electrode to provide a hydrogen source, CO2 was injected onto the surface of the fuel electrode for hydrogenation reactions. During electrolysis, protons were driven by the electric bias to transport from the oxygen electrode to the fuel electrode surface through the electrolyte. Two different fuel electrodes were used in this work: Ni/BZCYYb (pristine) and CeO2-modified Ni/BZCYYb (CeO2-modified). The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in BZCYYb reacts with H2O to form –OH species, making the surface much more hydrophilic than that of NiO. Consequently, an aqueous solution tends to cover the BZCYYb surface rather than the NiO surface during the infiltration process.24–26 So, we are able to selectively deposit CeO2 onto the BZCYYb surface without covering Ni. As shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1b and c), the pristine Ni/BZCYYb sample contains BZCYYb particles and Ni particles with a relatively rougher surface. After surface impregnation, additional particles, which were assigned to be CeO2, were covered on the BZCYYb surface (Fig. 1c). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Fig. S1a, ESI†) confirmed that while the BZCYYb phase and the Ni phase coexisted in the pristine sample, an extra CeO2 phase was observed on the CeO2-modified sample. Fig. S1b (ESI†) shows the element distribution of the CeO2-modified sample determined by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The distribution of Ce was complementary to Ni, further proving the selective coating of CeO2 on the BZCYYb surface. PCECs with different CeO2 coverages were prepared and tested, with 3% CeO2 exhibiting the optimal performance (ESI† S1). We will mainly introduce the results for the cell modified with 3% CeO2, which is simply referred as the CeO2-modified cell in the following text for clarity.

(f) Normalized impedance spectra at 1.6 V in 5% CO2 at 550 °C, and the inset is the DRT analysis of the impedance spectra in (f) cells with the pristine and CeO2-modified fuel electrodes. The inlet gas compositions in the fuel electrode: 2.6 sccm CO2 + 50 sccm Ar and the oxygen electrode: 100 sccm Ar with 30% H2O. 
The electrochemical performance of the PCEC with the pristine and CeO2-modified Ni-BZCYYb electrodes was systematically evaluated. As shown in the inset figure of Fig. 1d, the cell is with the fuel-electrode-supported structure. BZCYYb and PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ (PBSCF)-BZCYYb were used as the electrolyte and the oxygen electrode, respectively. The current–voltage (I–V) curve (Fig. 1d) showed that the cell with the CeO2-modified electrode (CeO2-modified cell) achieved a large current density. The current density reached 1120 mA cm−2 at 550 °C at an electrolysis voltage of 1.5 V, which was much larger than 939 mA cm−2 for the cell with the pristine Ni-BZCYYb electrode (pristine cell). A high current density of 559 mA cm−2 achieved using the CeO2-modified PCEC at 1.3 V is competitive with other works reported in the literature for the co-electrolysis of H2O/CO2 under similar conditions (Fig. S6a and Table S2, ESI†). The better electrochemical performance for the CeO2-modified cell can also be seen from the voltage–time curves under different electrolysis currents (Fig. 1e). Compared with the pristine cell, the CeO2-modified cell showed similar voltages under a small electrolysis current, but exhibited a noticeably lower voltage under a high currents density. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained with a constant voltage (1.6 V) at 550 °C, showing a lower polarization resistance (Rp) of 0.01 Ω cm2 for the CeO2-modified cell than that of 0.026 Ω cm2 for the pristine cell (Fig. 1f). The distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis was carried out based on the EIS data. As shown in the inset figure of Fig. 1f, an obvious DRT peak was observed in the high frequency range of 102–104 Hz, which decreased noticeably after CeO2 modification. According to the previous literature, this high-frequency relaxation process is related to the interface process occurring near the solid–gas interface.27 The accelerated migration of protons on the anode surface after modification of CeO2, as will be revealed by spectroscopic techniques and DFT calculation results shown in the later section, is likely to be the reason for the decrease in this high-frequency DRT peak. The performance of the pristine and CeO2-modified cells in the fuel-cell mode was also compared with the fuel electrode and the oxygen electrode exposing to fuel hydrogen and air, respectively. The CeO2-modified cell exhibited a higher peak power density and lower impedance than the pristine cell at 600 °C (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The DRT distribution revealed that the lower impedance was mainly derived from the reduction of the low-frequency peak (1–10 Hz), which was ascribed to H2 dissociation.28
We further analyzed the outlet gas composition of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction by gas chromatography (GC) and quantified the selectivity of the reaction product (Fig. 2a and b, Supplementary faradaic selectivity calculation). The quantitative analysis of oxygen gas on the oxygen electrode side was not performed due to interference from the N2 peak in the GC test. For the pristine cell, CO was the main reaction product with a portion ranging from 38% to 23% among the reaction products over the tested current density. By contrast, the CH4 ratio was only 2% at 178 mA cm−2, and increased to 5% at 1250 mA cm−2. Such result is consistent with previous reports for the Ni-based electrode.17,23 By infiltrating CeO2 on the electrode, the CH4 selectivity was significantly enhanced. The selectivity of CH4 reached 17% at 1250 mA cm−2, which was three times of that for the pristine cell. It is important to note that the current density was limited to 1250 mA cm−2 to avoid leaking of electrolytes, which is due to the sharp decrease in the interfacial steam pressure between the oxygen electrode and the electrolyte under a high current density (ESI† S2). Interestingly, we could see that the H2 selectivity for the pristine cell increased from 60% to 72% as the current density increased from 178 to 1250 mA cm−2, while the CeO2-modified PCECs fluctuated in the range of 63–68%. Such a difference suggested that hydrogen pumped by a higher electric bias to the surface of the CeO2-modified electrode could participate in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to produce CH4. In other words, the CeO2 modification layer strongly facilitated the further hydrogenation of produced CO on the surface to form CH4. Notably, the inlet gas compositions on the fuel electrode were CO2 and Ar. The interference of component analysis caused by extra hydrogen was effectively eliminated, especially at a low current density. Moreover, this ensured that the conversion of CO2 came from electrochemical hydrogenation. The produced hydrogen gas during electrolysis could keep the fuel electrode from being oxidized by CO2.

(c–e) Flow rates of CH4 (c), CO (d) and H2 (e) under different electrolysis currents for the cells with the pristine (circle) and CeO2-modified (star) fuel electrodes. The inlet gas compositions in the fuel electrode: 2.6 sccm CO2 + 50 sccm Ar and the oxygen electrode: 100 sccm Ar with 30% H2O. 
The comparison of the co-electrolysis performance could be seen more clearly from the analysis of reaction product flow rates. As shown in Fig. 2c, the CH4 flow rate of the CeO2-modified cell was always higher than that of the pristine cell, reaching 0.19 mL min cm−2 at 550 °C with a current density of 1250 mA cm−2, which was much higher than that of the pristine cell (0.06 mL min cm−2). Such a high CH4 production rate is competitive with the results reported in the literature under similar conditions (Fig. S6b and Table S2, ESI†). Consistent with the higher CH4 flow rate, a lower CO flow rate was observed for the CeO2-modified cell (Fig. 2d). These results implied the higher CH4 selectivity for the CeO2-modified cell. The H2 flow rate of the pristine cell increased from 0.6 to 4.2 mL min cm−2 with the increase of current, but the CeO2-modified cell exhibited a lower increase rate (from 0.6 to 2.8 mL min cm−2). The lower hydrogen gas flow rate at a high current density is likely due to the fact that parts of protons on the surface tend to participate in the deep CO2 hydrogenation reaction to produce hydrocarbon instead of directly forming hydrogen gas molecules (Fig. 2e). All the electrochemical and reaction product analysis results consistently suggested that the CeO2-modified cell exhibited much higher CH4 selectivity than the pristine cell. It is worth noting that compared to state-of-the-art anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers, our CH4 production rate has a significant advantage (Fig. S8, Table S3, ESI†) due to the elevated function temperature and no limitation in the solubility and diffusion length of CO2.29–31 Such a difference in the co-electrolysis performance is likely due to the higher catalytic activity of the CeO2-modified electrode towards the electrochemical CO2 hydrogenation reaction to produce CH4 than that of the pristine electrode. It is important to note that for a longer stability test, the PBSCF powder started to degrade, leading to cell performance degradation. By replacing the PBSCF powder with the PBSCF nanowire to improve oxygen electrode stability, the cell performance could be well-maintained for 100 h (Fig. S9, ESI†), implying the potential for the practical application of PCECs for the production of hydrocarbon from H2O and CO2 co-electrolysis. Although the temperature used in this work (550 °C) was still relatively high for the methanation reaction reported in the literature,32 we demonstrated surface engineering as an effective strategy to promote the co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O to generate CH4 using PCECs. It is worth noting that since the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to produce CH4 is an exothermic reaction,33 a higher function temperature is not beneficial for the production of CH4. However, it can facilitate the migration of protons towards the fuel electrode surface, which promotes the hydrogenation of CO2 because the protons driven by the applied voltage actively participates in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Therefore, there was an optimal function temperature to enable the fast transport of protons for the reaction and maintain enough CH4 selectivity. By surveying the literature (Fig. S10, ESI†), the temperature of 550 °C was chosen as the function condition of this work.
To reveal the mechanism of how the surface decoration layer alters the reaction pathway of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, we carried out several spectroscopic measurements to determine the variation on surface properties, adsorption characteristics and reaction intermediates. First, XAS and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on both the pristine and CeO2-modified electrodes to determine the valence state of Ce. For the Ce M-edge (Fig. 3a), A and A′, C and C′, and B and B′ were attributed to Ce3+, Ce4+ and the mixture of Ce3+/Ce4+ states, respectively.34 The CeO2-modified sample exhibited the lower Peak A, A′ and higher Peak C, C′, which indicated the increase of the surface Ce4+ content after CeO2 modification. Because the Auger peak of Ba overlaps with the Ce 3d XPS peak, the contents of Ce3+ and Ce4+ were not quantitatively analyzed in this paper. Nevertheless, the higher Ce4+ on the CeO2-modified electrode surface could still be clearly seen from the Ce 3d spectra (Fig. 3b).35–38 The increasing valence state of Ce in the CeO2-modified electrode is likely due to the higher oxygen vacancy formation energy in CeO2, which will be discussed later in the DFT calculation results.

(c and d) CO2-TPD and CO-TPD spectra of the pristine and CeO2-modified samples.

(f) Enlarged in situ DRIFTS spectra at 3100 to 2900 cm−1 and 1900 to 1000 cm−1 of the pristine and CeO2-modified samples. 
To evaluate the adsorption characteristics of the pristine and CeO2-modified electrodes, CO2-TPD and CO-TPD measurements were performed on the pristine and CeO2-modified electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the obvious CO and CO2 peaks appeared in both the pristine electrode and the CeO2-modified electrode. The desorption of CO2 and CO appeared at a lower temperature for the CeO2 modified electrode, implying that CO and CO2 adsorption of the CeO2-modified electrode is weaker than that on the pristine electrode. We further performed TPD tests for CO2 and CO on three reference samples of Ni, BZCYYb and CeO2-modified BZCYYb (Fig. S11, ESI†). We did not observe the noticeable adsorption of CO2 and CO on the Ni surface (Fig. S11a and b, ESI†), suggesting that Ni itself is not the active phase that directly reacted with CO2. Similar weaker adsorption (lower desorption temperature) of CO2 and CO was observed on the CeO2-modified BZCYYb surface than the bare BZCYYb surface (Fig. S11a and b, ESI†). As will be discussed in the later section, the weaker CO adsorption on the CeO2-modified electrode surface leads to the stronger bonding of hydrogen on CO, resulting in the facilitated further hydrogenation process of CO to produce CH4.
The reaction intermediates of CO2 hydrogenation were detected by in situ DRIFTS. Since we could not directly apply an electrochemical potential during DRIFTS, we injected reaction gases containing 2.5% H2 and 5% CO2 into the test chamber, which was with a similar composition on the fuel electrode surface of the CeO2-modified cell operating at 1250 mA cm−2. Both the pristine and the CeO2-modified electrodes showed a strong peak related to gaseous CO2 at 2358–2400 cm−1 (Fig. 3e). The in situ DRIFT spectra were subjected to intensity normalization with the adsorbed CO2 peaks. As shown in Fig. 3e, we found that C–H (∼3014 cm−1)17 and surface formyl species (HCO*, 1303 cm−1 and 1261 cm−1)23,39 vibrational modes appeared clearly in the CeO2-modified fuel electrode, but they were almost absent in the pristine fuel electrode (Fig. 3f). In addition, the *OCO peak appeared clearly in both samples, which was related to the high CO selectivity22,23 (23% for the pristine cell and 20% for the CeO2-modified cell) exhibited by both cells, as shown in Fig. 2.
The non-vacuum nature of Raman spectroscopy makes it very suitable for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)/SOEC material characterization.40–45 We prepared a model cell and performed the in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis to investigate the impact of the electric bias on the surface reactions.40,41,45 The sample preparation procedure and test configuration are shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. S12 (ESI†). A nickel mesh was embedded into the BZCYYb oxide matrix and then exposed to the surface by polishing, and CeO2 was then selectively deposited onto BZCYYb without covering the Ni mesh. The other side of BZCYYb was coated with porous Ag to serve as the counter electrode. This model cell was prepared and placed in a Harrick environmental chamber for the in situ Raman spectroscopy test (Fig. S13, ESI†). The gas atmosphere in the chamber was set to be similar with that on the fuel electrode surface during the operation (5% CO2 + 2.5% H2). At a temperature of 550 °C, an extra bias (1–1.6 V) was applied between the Ni mesh that embedded in the CeO2-modifed electrode and the porous Ag counter electrode. Fig. 4b and c show the Raman test results obtained from the CeO2 region (close to Ni) of the CeO2-modified electrode. As the applied bias increased, a peak located at 977 cm−1, which could be attributed to the bending mode of surface hydroxyl (–OH),42 continually increased (Fig. 4b). Such an enhanced surface hydroxyl intensity with the increase of the bias voltage can be seen clearly from the intensity ratio of surface hydroxyl (–OH) to the CeO2 F2g peak as a function of the bias (Fig. 4c). Ni serves as the current connector through which the electrochemical voltage was applied to the electrode to drive the proton. As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), similar to the trend for the –OH Raman signal, the increase of the electrolysis product is obvious under a low voltage, but the growth became slower under a high voltage. These results suggest that the increase of the –OH intensity in the Raman spectra is related to the bias-driven proton migration to the CeO2-modified fuel electrode surface. It is likely that under a low voltage, the kinetics of –OH formation and the CO2 hydrogenation reaction are limited by the number of protons pumped by voltage, therefore showed a strong increase with the voltage. By contrast, under a high voltage, there have been enough protons pumped from the other electrode, and the formation of –OH and the CO2 hydrogenation reaction are limited by the activity of reactive sites on the surface, therefore showed less dependence on the voltage. We did not observe a similar increase of the –OH peak if the Raman test was carried out under a pure CO2 atmosphere without any hydrogen source (Fig. S15b, ESI†). Since the –OH peak is overlapped with the Raman peak of BZCYYb near 977 cm−1 (Fig. S15c, ESI†), we cannot see the evolution of the –OH peak introduced by the applied potential for the pristine electrode. Nevertheless, the results we observed on the CeO2-modified electrode surface did confirm that by applying a bias on the electrode, hydrogen could be successfully pumped to the fuel electrode surface, which could further participate in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

(c) Intensity ratio of the surface hydroxyl (–OH) to CeO2 F2g peak in the in situ Raman spectra in (b). 
To reveal the impact of surface CeO2 on the reaction mechanism of the CO2 hydrogenation process, we carried out DFT calculations to determine the adsorption characteristics and the reaction pathway. The surface structures of CeO2 and BZCYYb before and after the adsorption were optimized as shown in Fig. S16–S21 (ESI†).
According to previous studies, there are several CO2 methanation mechanism pathways, but the reaction in which CO is produced as an intermediate is the RWGS + CO–hydrogenation pathway.46–49 In this pathway, a part of CO diffuses in the form of gas and the other part is adsorbed on the surface of the material to continue hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 5a. We therefore performed DFT calculations directly from CO hydrogenation to simplify the model.

(b) Comparison of the CO adsorption energy (CO Eads), oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evo) and proton binding energy (Ep) in CeO2 and BZCYYb. (c) Side views of the DFT-optimized surface structures of CeO2 (111) and BZCYYb (010) with adsorbed HCO*. (d) The calculated potential energy diagram of CO hydrogenation to CH4 on CeO2 and BZCYYb. The numerical data are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). The corresponding configurations are shown in Fig. S16–S25 (ESI†). 
We first calculated the CO adsorption energy (Eads), oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evo) and proton binding energy (Ep) on the CeO2 (111) and BZCYYb (010) surfaces (Fig. 5b). The CO adsorption energy of CeO2 (−1.38 eV) was notably higher than that of BZCYYb (−3.72 eV), as shown in Fig. 5b. This result agreed with the weaker CO adsorption (lower desorption temperature) we observed for the CeO2 surface using the CO TPD measurement (Fig. 3d). The weaker CO adsorption of CeO2 makes the binding of CO to hydrogen stronger, facilitating the further CO hydrogenation to produce CH4.
We further found that the oxygen vacancy was easier to generate in BZCYYb than CeO2, which was in accord with the lower Ce valence state in BZCYYb observed experimentally from the Ce M-edge XAS spectra and Ce 3d XPS spectra (Fig. 3a and b). Higher Evo in CeO2 means strong metal–oxygen (M–O) bonding, leading to proton binding weakly to lattice oxygen (M–O–H). Modifying the BZCYYb surface with CeO2 with a high Evo may lead to a weaker O–H bond and facilitate the transfer of H+ on the surface to participate in the hydrogenation reactions. Consistent with these theoretical calculation results, we found the clear evidence of electrochemically driven protons on the CeO2 surface by detecting the increase of the –OH peak with an applied voltage in the in situ Raman measurement (Fig. 4).
For hydrogenation of CO to produce CH4, H needs to first bond with the adsorbed CO. The CO-hydrogenation path could be divided into COH* and HCO* paths according to the O and C terminal hydrogenation of CO, while the HCO* path leads to high CH4 selectivity.49–51 The CO hydrogenation energy of BZCYYb and CeO2 was calculated via the reaction energy of CO* + H* → HCO* or COH* (Fig. S22 and S23, ESI†), and the result showed that the HCO* hydrogenation energy of the two substances was lower than that of COH*. The side views of the DFT-optimized surface structures of CeO2 (111) and BZCYYb (010) with adsorbed HCO* are presented in Fig. 5c.
Having confirmed the configuration of H bonding to CO, we further calculated full potential energy diagrams for CO hydrogenation to produce CH4, as shown in Fig. 5d. The reaction energy at each step is presented in the ESI† Fig. S24, S25 and Table S4. Overall, the CeO2 surface exhibited a lower hydrogenation reaction energy for the further hydrogenation of CO towards CH4, which was consistent with the experimental observation of higher CH4 selectivity for the CeO2-modified electrode (Fig. 2a, b and 5d). Notably, the hydrogenation process of adsorbed reaction intermediates (4 → 5, 5 → 6) on CeO2 was found to occur readily with negative changes in reaction energies, indicating a strongly facilitated hydrogenation process.
The combination of the experimental test and the DFT calculation results implied that the CeO2 modification layer effectively enhanced the affiliation of hydrogen to adsorbed CO and weakened surface binding of H+ to facilitate its migration, leading to strongly promoted hydrogenation of CO towards CH4. Consequently, the CeO2-modified PCEC presented higher CH4 selectivity for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction than the pristine PCEC.
Conclusions
In this work, we used a facile solution approach to selectively decorate the CeO2 layer onto the BZCYYb surface of the Ni-BZCYYb electrode. The obtained electrode was used for co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O in PCECs. Electrochemical tests and production analysis suggested that the CeO2 modification significantly promoted CO2 hydrogenation to produce CH4. The CH4 selectivity of the CeO2-modified cell was three times higher than that of the pristine cell at 550 °C and 1250 mA cm−2. Several spectroscopy techniques, including XAS, XPS, TPD and in situ DRIFT results implied that the CeO2 modification layer strongly modulates the adsorption of CO2 and CO on the surface and promotes the formation of C–H on the surface, which is the key reaction intermediate for CH4 production. The in situ Raman spectra further demonstrated that protons can be effectively driven to the surface to participate in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction by an electric bias. Finally, DFT calculations provided further evidence for the weaker CO adsorption and proton bonding on the CeO2 surface than that on the BZCYYb surface. While the former factor leads to the stronger binding of hydrogen to CO and the facilitation of CO hydrogenation, the latter factor promoted the migration of protons after they were driven to the electrode surface. Both factors lead to a much lower energy barrier for further hydrogenation of CO, resulting in higher CH4 selectivity on the CeO2-modified surface. This work demonstrates surface engineering as an effective approach for regulating the reacting path of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis using PCECs. The obtained knowledge provides important insight for the design of highly active catalysts for other high-temperature thermal, solar-thermal and thermo-electrochemical devices.

Broader context
Low cost and efficient large-scale energy storage technology is key to the implementation of renewable energy sources and advanced nuclear power. The co-electrolysis of CO2/H2O using proton-conducting electrolysis cells (PCECs) has attracted great attention as a promising approach to achieve the goal of power-to-X (H2, syngas or hydrocarbons) due to its unparalleled conversion efficiency at intermediate temperatures (400–700 °C). However, at present, it is still challenging to obtain high value-added products (i.e., CH4, C2H6, etc.) from the CO2/H2O co-electrolysis in PCECs, and the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on the electrode surface is still ambiguous. This paper reports surface engineering as an effective strategy for promoting the CO2/H2O co-electrolysis to produce CH4 using PCECs, achieving triple CH4 selectivity by simple CeO2 impregnation. The scientific findings obtained here provide guidelines for the development of highly active catalysts for other reactions such as photo/electrochemical/thermal water splitting and CO2 reduction.
