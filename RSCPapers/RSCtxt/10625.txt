1. Introduction
Graphene, a single layer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms tightly packed into a two-dimensional honeycomb structure, has attracted a lot of attention since its discovery in 2004,1 due to its outstanding mechanical, thermal, optical, and electrical properties. Especially, graphene possesses a high thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1), offers an excellent mobility of charge carriers at room temperature (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), and exhibits an extremely high theoretical specific surface area (∼2600 m2 g−1).2–4 To date, various methods have been developed for the preparation of graphene, including micromechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth, chemical and electrochemical reduction of graphite oxide and bottom-up organic synthesis.3–9 Among these methods, the reduction of exfoliated graphene oxide (GO) was proven to be an effective and reliable method to produce graphene nanosheets owing to low cost and massive scalability.10 Moreover, the surface properties of graphene can be adjusted via chemical modification, which offers tremendous opportunities for the development of functionalized graphene-based materials.8,11 Such graphene-based materials show unique electronic and optical properties and good biocompatibility, which make these materials attractive for many potential applications including energy storage,12 catalysis,13 biosensors,14 molecular imaging15 and drug delivery.16 Recently, functionalized graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted a lot of attention due to their good electron conductivity, large specific surface area and high adsorption.17–22
Since the discovery of the photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,23 a significant progress has been made in the area of highly active oxide semiconductor photocatalysts because of their applicability in solar energy conversion and environmental protection. Some semiconductors (e.g., ZnO, WO3, CdS, Bi2WO4 and BiOCl, etc.) can act as photocatalysts for light-induced chemical transformations due to their unique electronic structure composed of a filled valence band (VB) and an empty conduction band (CB). When a photon with energy of hv matches or exceeds the band gap energy (Eg) of the semiconductor, an electron in the VB is excited into the CB, leaving a positive hole in the VB. The photogenerated holes and electrons play a very important role in pollutant degradation and photocatalytic disinfection, and solar energy conversion including hydrogen production and solar photovoltaics, respectively. However, the photogenerated electrons and holes in the excited states are unstable and can easily recombine, dissipating the input energy as heat, which results in low efficiency of photocatalysis.24–27
During the past decade, a variety of strategies have been employed to improve the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor photocatalysts, for example, via suitable textural design,28–33 doping,34–37 noble metal loading38–40 and forming semiconductor composites.41,42 In particular, numerous attempts have been made to combine graphene with semiconductor photocatalysts to enhance their photocatalytic performance.19–21,43–48 For example, Kamat and co-workers19,20,49,50 produced GO–TiO2 nanocrystalline composites by sonicating dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles and GO in ethanol and demonstrated the feasibility of using graphene as an electron-transfer medium in the graphene/TiO2 composite photocatalysts. This pioneering work has stimulated an extensive research on the preparation, modification, and application of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts. Zhang et al.21 reported graphene–P25 TiO2 composites synthesized under hydrothermal conditions that exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue in aqueous solutions. Ng et al.43 demonstrated a great performance of the BiVO4–GO composite photocatalyst in the visible light range for water splitting. Since many important findings have been reported on the graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts during the past few years, we believe that a comprehensive review on this subject is timely to promote further developments in this exciting area of research. This review is focused on the recent progress in the design, fabrication, modification and applications of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts, and provides some invigorating perspectives on the future developments.
2. Preparation
2.1 Synthesis of graphene
Since the first report on graphene obtained by manual mechanical cleavage of graphite with a Scotch tape,1 a wide range of techniques for the synthesis of this material have been reported.3 In general, these techniques can be divided into “bottom-up” and “top-down” methods. In the bottom-up methods, graphene is synthesized from atoms or molecules via chemical reactions. Some typical examples are epitaxial growth on single-crystal SiC and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metal foil surfaces.5,6,51–53 These resulting graphene films can be easily transferred to polymer substrates by etching away the metal supports. However, these methods are not widely used because of their complexity, limited scaling-up and high cost of the precious metal substrates. To date, high-quality graphene with a well-defined molecular structure was usually prepared by top-down methods such as chemical exfoliation of graphite,54,55 thermal exfoliation56 and electrostatic deposition.57 Especially, the most widely used technique is chemical reduction of GO as shown in Fig. 1, which is usually conducted by Hummers' method.58 According to this method, the reduced GO is prepared by exfoliating graphite oxide, obtained by oxidation of natural graphite powder with strong chemical oxidants, such as HNO3, KMnO4 and H2SO4. The resulting GO product is usually purified by centrifugation, washing, and dialysis to remove some aggregates and various inorganic impurities such as residual ions and acids. More importantly, the exfoliated GO sheets usually possess a rich assortment of oxygen-containing groups, such as carboxylic, hydroxyl, and epoxide functional groups. The presence of oxygen functionalities in GO allows interactions with the cations and provides reactive sites for the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles, which results in the rapid growth of various graphene-based composites. Moreover, the functional GO can be reduced to graphene with partial restoration of the sp2-hybridized network by thermal,59 chemical,60 electrochemical,61 photothermal,62 photocatalytic,63 sonochemical,64 and microwave reduction methods.65

2.2 Preparation of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts
A variety of semiconductor photocatalysts have been used for the synthesis of graphene-based composites and/or functional GO. They mainly include metal oxides (e.g. TiO2,18,21,66–74 ZnO,48,75–80 SnO2,81–83 Cu2O,84 Fe2O3,85 NiO,86 MnO287 and ZrO288), salts (e.g. ZnS,89 CdS,89–93 CdSe,94 Bi2WO6,95 BiVO4,43 Sr2Ta2O7,96 ZnFe2O4,97 InNbO498 and γ-Bi2MoO699), metal-free polymers (e.g. graphitic carbon nitride100,101) and silver/silver halides (Ag/AgCl,102,103 and Ag/AgBr103). The widely used preparation methods are in situ growth, solution mixing, hydrothermal and/or solvothermal method. The following paragraphs will give a more detailed description of the available synthesis routes.

2.2.1 
            In situ growth strategy. 
The direct growth strategy is widely used to prepare graphene based-metal compound composites. The most common precursors of graphene and metal compound are functional GO and metal salts, respectively. Usually, the salt is mixed with GO and then converted to the corresponding oxide, forming a GO/metal compound composite. After reduction of GO, graphene based-metal compound composites were produced. For example, Sn2+ or Ti3+ ions were added into a functional GO dispersion solution and converted to SnO2 or TiO2 nanoparticles at low temperatures. In this process GO was reduced to graphene by SnCl2 or TiCl3.81 The growth of SnO2 and TiO2 nanocrystals of different morphologies on the reduced GO sheets was attributed to the different reduction abilities and hydrolysis rates of Sn2+ and Ti3+, respectively. A graphene–ZnO composite was synthesized analogously. Zn2+ ions were adsorbed on graphene oxide sheets and converted into ZnO nanoparticles with the addition of NaOH and NaBH4 under drying in air at 150 °C.48 After reduction of graphene oxide, a graphene/ZnO composite photocatalyst was produced. In this composite, the size of ZnO nanoparticles formed on graphene sheets was in the range of 10–20 nm with a narrow particle size distribution. Lambert et al.104 also reported the in situ synthesis of composites comprised of flower-like anatase TiO2–graphene oxide by the hydrolysis of TiF4 in the presence of aqueous dispersions of GO. In this case, when the concentration of graphene oxide was sufficiently high and stirring was off, a long-range ordered assemblies of TiO2-GO sheets were obtained. Li et al.105 developed a direct growth of uniform mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres on graphene sheets by a template-free self-assembly process (see Fig. 2). They used titanium sulfate and functional graphene sheets as the starting materials. The epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups on graphene sheets acted as heterogeneous nucleation sites by anchoring anatase nanoparticles, which resulted in the formation of well-dispersed mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres on the graphene sheets. Interestingly, the oriented attachment of some very small primary TiO2 nanoparticles facilitated the formation of a single-crystal-like microstructure within a single nanosphere during the assembly process of these nanospheres on graphene sheets. Further extensions of the direct growth strategy were used to prepare a variety of graphene based-composites. For example, Wang et al.106 used anionic sulfate surfactants to assist the stabilization of graphene in aqueous solutions and to facilitate the self-assembly of in situ grown nanocrystalline TiO2, rutile and anatase, with graphene. Park and co-authors107 prepared TiO2 nanoparticles coated with graphite oxide layers by the spontaneous exfoliation and reorganization of graphite oxides in aqueous slurry without using any chemical reagents under ambient conditions. Du et al.108 also prepared the hierarchically ordered macro-mesoporous TiO2–graphene composite film. They used a confinement self-assembly method to produce the hierarchically ordered porous titania films with two-dimensional hexagonal mesostructures and well-interconnected periodic macropores. Then, graphene was incorporated into the resulting titania framework by in situ reduction of graphene oxide added into the self-assembled system (see Fig. 3).

The in situ growth strategy can avoid the agglomeration of the semiconductor nanoparticles on the graphene sheets. Zhu et al.109 reported a one-pot method for water-phase synthesis of high-quality graphene/TiO2 composite nanosheets using TiCl3 as a reducing agent and the titania precursor. Similarly, a graphene/CdS composite was also prepared by a one-step method using GO and Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O in DMSO.90 During this one-step reaction, H2S released from DMSO acted as both the reducing agent of GO and the sulfide source. Thus, the reduction of GO and the deposition of CdS on the graphene sheets occurred simultaneously, resulting in a uniform and tight distribution of CdS nanoparticles on graphene sheets. The size of the CdS nanoparticles in the composite was around 10 nm (see Fig. 4). Chen et al.110 reported the fabrication of graphene sheets-wrapped anatase TiO2 hollow particles. The electroactive egg-like TiO2 hollow particles were first synthesized, and then these particles were functionalized with aminopropyltriethoxysilane to obtain a positively-charged surface. Next, the negatively charged GO sheets were linked to these functionalized TiO2 hollow particles via simple electrostatic interaction. Finally, the GO sheets were reduced to graphene sheets by thermal treatment under an inert atmosphere, leading to the formation of graphene–TiO2 composites.

2.2.2 Solution mixing method. 
Solution mixing has been widely used to fabricate graphene/semiconductor composite photocatalysts. For example, TiO2 particles and GO colloids have been mixed ultrasonically, followed by ultraviolet (UV)-assisted photocatalytic reduction of GO to yield TiO2/graphene composites.111 Akhavan and Ghaderi112 used a similar strategy to prepare the TiO2/graphene composite thin film. Paek et al.113 synthesized the SnO2 sol by hydrolysis of SnCl4 with NaOH, and then the prepared graphene dispersion was mixed with the sol in ethylene glycol to form the SnO2/graphene composite. Mukherji et al.96 prepared nitrogen doped Sr2Ta2O7 coupled with graphene sheets by mixing the graphene oxide dispersion and Sr2Ta2O7−xNx, followed by reduction of graphene oxide to graphene under xenon lamp irradiation. Zhu et al.103 used the water/oil system to produce GO enwrapped Ag/AgX (X = Br, Cl) composites. They added aqueous solutions of GO and AgNO3 to chloroform solution of CTAB or CTAC under magnetic stirring at room temperature to produce Ag/AgX/GO hybrid composites (Fig. 5). Considering graphene's large network of sp2 hybridized carbon, this material can tend to form strong π–π bonds with other graphite-like materials. Sun et al.100 synthesized a composite polymeric photocatalyst graphene/graphitic carbon nitride by a combined solution mixing–chemical reduction strategy. Graphitic carbon nitride was deposited on the surface of GO sheets to form a layered composite by polymerizing melamine molecules adsorbed on GO due to the π–π interaction of aromatic structures between graphene oxide and graphitic carbon nitride. Similarly, Geng et al.94 mixed graphene oxide sheets and the CdSe nanoparticles modified with pyridine to produce graphene–CdSe quantum dots composites. They thought that pyridine ligands could provide π–π interactions for the assembly of CdSe nanoparticles capped with pyridine on GO sheets.

2.2.3 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method. 
The hydrothermal/solvothermal process, one of the traditional methods for crystal growth of semiconductors, is another effective method for the preparation of semiconductor composites with graphene. In this process, semiconductor nanoparticles or their precursors are loaded on the graphene oxide sheets, which are reduced to graphene. For example, Fu and Wang97 synthesized the ZnFe2O4–graphene composite photocatalyst with different graphene contents by a one-step hydrothermal method in ethanol-aqueous solution. They used Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as precursors of ZnFe2O4, and GO as a source of graphene sheets. During the hydrothermal reaction process, GO was reduced to graphene, and simultaneously ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were formed on the graphene sheets (as shown in Fig. 6). A graphene–Bi2WO6 composite photocatalyst was also prepared by in situ hydrothermal reaction in the presence of GO.95 Furthermore, some solvothermal experiments can result in the semiconductor nanoparticles of special morphology on graphene sheets. For example, Ding et al.114 synthesized graphene-supported ultrathin anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) high-energy facets by a simple solvothermal method. In this process, anatase TiO2 nanosheets directly grew onto the graphene oxide support during the solvothermal growth of TiO2 nanocrystals, and then GO was reduced to graphene via a thermal treatment under N2/H2, giving rise to the unique hybrid structure of the graphene–TiO2 composite. By using a different titanium source, Zhang et al.21 synthesized the graphene–TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst by hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide sheets and Degussa P25 TiO2 powder in an ethanol–water solvent. In order to get a uniform mixture of graphene and the semiconductor photocatalyst, Wang et al.115 used a one-step solvothermal method to produce graphene–TiO2 nanocomposites with well-dispersed particles by controlling the hydrolysis rate of titanium isopropoxide. Very recently, Shen et al.116 found an environmentally friendly route for the preparation of graphene–TiO2 nanocomposites with a one-step hydrothermal method using glucose as the reducing agent. They claimed that this process is simple, scalable, and feasible because it utilizes only water and glucose.

2.2.4 Other methods. 
A nonaqueous atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach has been used to fabricate metal oxide–graphene hybrid nanocomposites. For example, Meng et al.83 reported for the first time the preparation of the SnO2–graphene nanocomposite using SnCl4 and H2O as the ALD precursors. The SnO2 nanoparticles/films as well as amorphous/crystalline phases were obtained by adjusting the growth temperature. Moreover, Du et al.88 developed an electrochemical deposition method to prepare the graphene–ZrO2 composite on a glass carbon electrode.

3. Photocatalytic applications
In recent years, semiconductor-mediated photocatalysis has attracted worldwide attention for its potential in environmental and energy-related applications.24,35,117–121 However, the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs within photocatalytic materials results in its low efficiency, thus limiting its practical applications. Therefore, the suppression of recombination of charge carriers is the key for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of semiconductor photocatalysts. Besides the conventional doping and adding co-sorbents,122 carbon–semiconductor hybrid materials became a new class of photocatalysts, which recently has attracted a lot of attention.123–127 Composites that combine carbon and semiconductor photocatalysts could potentially offer desirable efficiency for separating electron–hole pairs. In this regard, graphene has been examined in combination with a semiconductor photocatalyst, which resulted in improved photocatalytic activity as shown in Table 1. As can be seen from this table the graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts have been widely used for the degradation of pollutants, photocatalytic hydrogen generation and photocatalytic disinfection, etc. In this section the main applications of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts are briefly summarized.

3.1 Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants
In recent years, a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the widespread pollution of effluents from urban and agricultural industries with biorecalcitrant and organic pollutants. Various catalytic techniques have been applied in environmental protection. Photocatalysis has attracted an increasing attention because of its widespread environmental applications such as air cleanup,137–139 water disinfection,140,141 hazardous waste remediation,142,143 and water purification.40,144
Graphene, as a “rising star” material and another allotrope of carbon, has many exceptional properties, such as high electron mobility, theoretically high surface area of 2600 m2 g−1, and high transparency.145–149 Therefore, graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts have been extensively applied to photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds.150–152 These composites possess high dye adsorption capacity, extended light absorption range, and enhanced charge separation and transportation properties. For example, Zhang et al.21 reported the P25 TiO2–graphene composite as a high performance photocatalyst. This composite photocatalyst exhibited a significant enhancement of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) in water under both UV and visible light irradiation compared to the bare P25. As shown in Fig. 7, MB molecules can be transferred from the solution to the surface of TiO2 and adsorbed with offset face-to-face orientation via π–π conjugation between MB and aromatic regions of graphene, and therefore, adsorption of dyes increases compared to that on the bare P25. Moreover, the extended photoresponding range together with enhanced charge separation and transportation properties resulted in the enhanced photocatalytic activity. In addition, the TiO2–graphene composite showed higher activity than the P25–carbon nanotubes with the same carbon content because of the giant two-dimensional planar structure of graphene. Such structure can facilitate charge transportation and adsorption of dyes, which are rarely reported in other TiO2–carbon photocatalysts. However, Zhang and Tang et al.128 found that the TiO2–graphene composite is in essence the same as other TiO2–carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) composite materials as regards to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2. They reported that TiO2–graphene nanocomposite can be used as a photocatalyst under ambient conditions with much higher photocatalytic activity and stability toward the gas-phase degradation of benzene than the bare TiO2. Furthermore, the effect of the graphene content in the composites on the decomposition of benzene in air and MB in water was also studied (see Fig. 8).

Liu et al.129 reported the mechanism of anticharge recombination of the TiO2 nanorods–GO composite for the photocatalytic degradation of MB under UV light irradiation (Fig. 9). They found that the electrons in the GO sheets could react with absorbed O2 to form ˙OH. Thus, the effective charge transfer can reduce the charge recombination and increase the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanorods. Furthermore, the TiO2 nanorods–GO composites showed higher activity than P25–GO composites. This is mainly due to the better contact between GO and TiO2 nanorods and the more effective charge transfer from TiO2 nanorods to GO sheets. These results indicate some possibilities for improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2–graphene composites by optimizing the morphology of TiO2 and the distribution of TiO2 nanoparticles on graphene sheets. For example, Du et al.108 reported the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the hierarchically ordered macro-mesoporous TiO2–graphene composite films for decomposition of MB in water under UV light irradiation. This hierarchically composite film showed much higher photocatalytic activity than the pure mesoporous TiO2 film.

Recently, Zhou et al.130 demonstrated that uniform dispersion of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles with narrow particle size distribution on the surface of graphene sheets assured an enhanced photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB in water under simulated sunlight irradiation. All the aforementioned results revealed that graphene sheets in the composites can promote charge separation and enhance photocatalytic activity. For the TiO2–graphene composite, electron–hole pairs are generated within TiO2 upon excitation under UV light irradiation. These photogenerated electrons tend to transfer to graphene sheets, and then scavenged by dissolved oxygen, facilitating the hole–electron separation.
Meanwhile, the holes can either react with adsorbed water (or surface hydroxyl) to form hydroxyl radicals or directly oxidize various organic compounds. The major reaction steps in this photocatalytic degradation mechanism under UV-light irradiation are summarized by the following eqn (1–5). TiO2 + hv → TiO2 (e− + h+)(1) TiO2 (e−) + Graphene → TiO2 + Graphene (e−)(2) Graphene (e−) + O2 → Graphene + O2−(3) TiO2 (h+) + OH− → TiO2 + ˙OH(4) ˙OH + Pollutants → Degradation products(5)It is known that the TiO2 photocatalyst possesses excellent activity and stability, but requires UV irradiation for effective photocatalysis because of its wide bandgap. It is desirable but challenging to design visible-light responsive photocatalysts. Recently, it was shown that TiO2–GO and TiO2–graphene composites can possess visible-light photocatalytic activity due to the presence of carbonate structural fragments bonded with titanium. For example, Chen et al.131 reported the visible-light driven photocatalytic performance of the GO/TiO2 composites with p/n heterojunction in the degradation of methyl orange (MO). In the aforementioned study, the p-type semiconductor was formed by GO in the GO/TiO2 composite. Thus, a p/n heterojunction in this composite was observed. Interestingly, this p-type semiconductor could be excited by visible light with wavelengths longer than 510 nm, and acted as a sensitizer and as an electron carrier in the composite, leading to the visible-light responsive photocatalytic activity. This finding might help design a good photosensitizer with graphene oxide in the area of photocatalysis. Very recently, Zhang et al.21 also revealed that the P25 TiO2–graphene composite showed an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for decomposition of MB in water. This is mainly due to the fact that graphene in this composite can enhance the light absorption range, promote charge separation and increase adsorption of pollutants.
Apart from TiO2–graphene composites, composites of graphene and other semiconductor photocatalysts such as SnO2–graphene,81 ZnO–graphene,48 Bi2WO6–graphene,95 Ag/AgCl/GO,102,103 Ag/AgBr/GO,103 ZnFe2O4–graphene,97 InNbO4–graphene98 and γ-Bi2MoO6/graphene99 have been reported as efficient photocatalysts for decomposition of pollutants in water. For instance, Zhang et al.81 evaluated the visible-light photocatalytic activity of SnO2–graphene and TiO2–graphene composites for degradation of self-photosensitized rhodamine B (RhB) in water, and found that both these composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance. This could be attributed to the good electrical conductivity and effective charge separation because of the presence of graphene in these composites. Surprisingly, the SnO2–graphene composite system showed better photocatalytic activity than TiO2–graphene. This is mainly due to the fact that the electron transfer from RhB* to SnO2 is thermodynamically more favorable because of the large potential difference between the RhB* and SnO2. Moreover, Xu and co-workers75 reported the graphene hybridized ZnO composite as an efficient photocatalyst. This composite also showed enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB aqueous solution under UV irradiation. Recently, the Bi2WO6–graphene composite photocatalysts were studied by Gao and co-workers95 for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB solution under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 10, electronic interactions and charge equilibration between graphene and Bi2WO6 led to the shift in the Fermi level and decreased the conduction band potential of Bi2WO6. Thus, the negative shift in the Fermi level of G-BWO and the high migration efficiency of photoinduced electrons can suppress the charge recombination effectively, resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Very recently, Zhu et al.103 for the first time reported GO enwrapped Ag/AgX (X = Br, Cl) composites as highly efficient visible-light plasmonic photocatalysts. These photocatalysts displayed an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic degradation of MO in water and high stability as shown in Fig. 11. This observed enhancement was due to the hybridization of Ag/AgX with GO, which improved adsorption affinity of Ag/AgX/GO towards MO molecules. Also, the smaller size of the Ag/AgX nanoparticles in Ag/AgX/GO, the facilitated charge transfer, and the suppressed recombination of electron–hole pairs in the Ag/AgX/GO composite contributed to this enhancement. In another system, graphene sheets were introduced into a visible-light driven ZnFe2O4 photocatalyst for photocatalytic decomposition of MB in water.97 In comparison to pure ZnFe2O4, ZnFe2O4–graphene showed a significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activity due to the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers in the ZnFe2O4 and graphene coupling system.

3.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen generation
Hydrogen energy is regarded as an ultimate clean fuel in the future because of its high-energy capacity, environmental friendliness, and recycling possibility.42,153,154 Photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen using semiconductor photocatalysts has been considered as a promising and attractive approach to produce hydrogen energy. A variety of semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported to catalyze the evolution of hydrogen from water. However, the practical applications of this strategy are limited due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes within photocatalysts. Considering the superior electron mobility and high specific surface area, graphene can be used as an efficient electron acceptor to enhance the photoinduced charge transfer and to inhibit the backward reaction by separating the evolution sites of hydrogen and oxygen (see Fig. 12) for improved photocatalytic H2-production activity.19

Using the graphene/TiO2 composites with different loading contents of graphene, Cui and co-workers136,155,156 studied their water splitting performance using Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents under Xe lamp irradiation. The optimal graphene content was found to be 5.0 wt%, giving a H2-production rate of 8.6 μmol h−1, which exceeded the rate on pure P25 TiO2 by more than 2 times.136 The enhanced photocatalytic H2-production activity was due to the deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles on graphene sheets, which acted as electron acceptors to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers. Very recently, Fan et al.135 systematically studied the efficiency of H2 evolution for the P25–graphene composite prepared by UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction, hydrazine reduction, and a hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 13, all of these composites exhibited better photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution from methanol aqueous solution than P25 alone, and the P25–graphene composite prepared by the hydrothermal method possessed the best performance. The ratio of P25/graphene in the composite also significantly influenced the photocatalytic performance, and the optimum mass ratio has been found to be 1/0.2, giving a H2-production rate of 74 μmol h−1. This value exceeds that of pure P25 by more than 10 times. Moreover, this composite was stable and recyclable, and even it could photocatalyze the evolution of H2 from pure water without co-catalysts. In order to further explore the possible application of TiO2 based-graphene composites in hydrogen production, Choi and co-workers107 showed that the graphite oxide on titania nanoparticles is an efficient auxiliary co-catalyst for the photocatalytic hydrogen production. They found that a hybrid of GO/TiO2 showed an enhanced activity for both photocurrent generation and hydrogen production than bare TiO2 under UV light irradiation. In particular, the photocatalytic production of hydrogen was markedly enhanced in the co-presence of GO sheets along with Pt on the surface of TiO2, which indicated that the cheap and abundant carbon material can be a good candidate for finding an electron attracting reservoir and an auxiliary co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

Even though the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2 nanoparticles has been extensively investigated, the hydrogen evolution rate of such photocatalysts is generally still much lower than that of the state-of-the-art benchmarking photocatalysts such as lanthanum-doped NaTaO3, nitrogen-doped Sr2Ta2O7, and Pt–CdS. A further enhancement of the water splitting performance of these state-of-the-art photocatalysts was proposed by introduction of graphene. For example, Mukherji et al.96 reported nitrogen doped Sr2Ta2O7 coupled with graphene sheets as photocatalysts for increased photocatalytic hydrogen production under solar irradiation. By using graphene as a support for the Pt co-catalyst, the composite containing graphene–Pt and Sr2Ta2O7−xN showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 293 μmol h−1 with a quantum efficiency (QE) of 6.45% under 280–550 nm light irradiation. However, the corresponding rates for pure Sr2Ta2O7 with the Pt co-catalyst and Sr2Ta2O7−xN–Pt without graphene were 106 μmol h−1 with a QE of 2.33% and 194 μmol h−1 with a QE of 4.26% under the same measurement conditions, respectively. Thus, nitrogen doping and usage of graphene as a conductive electron transport “highway” resulted in the improvement of the hydrogen production efficiency in comparison to that of the pristine Sr2Ta2O7 photocatalyst. Similarly, Jia et al.91 studied the photocatalytic H2-production activity of a series of N-doped graphene/CdS nanocomposites from aqueous solutions containing Na2S and Na2SO3 as sacrificial agents under visible-light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 14, the hydrogen evolution rate of CdS was significantly enhanced by loading N-doped graphene. The optimal loading content of N-doped graphene was found to be 2.0 wt%, giving a H2-production rate of 210 μmol h−1, exceeding that on pure CdS (40 μmol h−1) by more than 5 times. The enhanced mechanism is because the potential of graphene/graphene− is lower than the conduction band of CdS, meanwhile higher than the reduction potential of H+, which favors the electron transfer from the conduction band of CdS to graphene sheets and the reduction of H+, thus enhancing photocatalytic H2-production activity.

Also, a metal-free polymeric photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), showed a good photocatalytic performance for hydrogen or oxygen production via water splitting under visible-light irradiation.157 Combining g-C3N4 with graphene sheets gave rise to an increased conductivity and catalytic performance. The resulting graphene/g-C3N4 composites showed a H2-evolution rate 3.0 times higher than pure g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation due to the efficient charge carrier separation on the photocatalyst as shown in Fig. 15.101 Similarly, Ng et al.43 reported that the reduced GO on a visible-light BiVO4 photocatalyst showed an enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting. Compared with pure BiVO4, the photoelectrochemical water splitting reaction rate based on the graphene/BiVO4 composite showed nearly 10-fold enhancement at a 0.8 V bias under visible-light illumination. This significant improvement was attributed to the introduction of graphene sheets, which facilitated the electron transport between illuminated BiVO4 and the electrode, leading to a minimized recombination of photoelectrons and holes. Moreover, the incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the graphene/BiVO4 composite was measured to be 4.2%, which is one order of magnitude greater than that of pure BiVO4 (0.3% at 400 nm).

Interestingly, graphite oxide itself with an appropriately oxidized level can also serve as a photocatalyst for hydrogen production. Teng and co-workers158 reported that a graphite oxide semiconductor photocatalyst with a band gap of 2.4–4.3 eV can steadily produce H2 from an aqueous methanol solution or pure water, even in the absence of Pt as the co-catalyst under visible light irradiation (Fig. 16). Usually, the band gap energy of graphite oxide depends on the number of oxygenated sites, and can be modulated by functionalization or cutting them into nanoribbons. When the conduction band edge of graphite oxide, which is mainly formed by the anti-bonding π* orbital, has a higher energy level than that needed for H2 generation, it can lead to electron injection into the solution phase for H2 generation.

3.3 Photocatalytic disinfection
TiO2-mediated disinfection has been considered as a promising process compared to the common disinfection methods such as chlorination and UV disinfection for its strong oxidizing power, nontoxicity, and long-term photostability, also requiring little or no maintenance.140 Since the use of graphene may enhance the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 under UV and visible-light irradiation, graphene–TiO2 composites may potentially be used to enhance the bactericidal activity. For example, Akhavan and Ghaderi112 found that the graphene/TiO2 composite thin films were able to destroy more than 99.9% of E. coli bacteria in an aqueous solution under solar light irradiation. Such antibacterial activity was significantly improved as compared to the pure TiO2 thin film by a factor of about 7.5. Furthermore, the graphene platelets were chemically stable after photoinactivation of the bacteria.
4. Conclusion and perspectives
In summary, functional graphene can be introduced into various semiconductor photocatalysts to form graphene-based semiconductor composites. The incorporation of graphene into these composites can improve them with unique properties of graphene and possibly induce new properties, such as high dye adsorption capacity, extended light absorption range, and enhanced charge separation and transportation properties, which enhance the overall photocatalytic performance. A variety of methods such as in situ growth, solution mixing, hydrothermal and/or solvothermal strategies have been developed for fabricating the graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts. These composite photocatalysts have been widely used for the degradation of pollutants, photocatalytic hydrogen generation and photocatalytic disinfection.
Graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted extensive attention for their potential in environmental and energy-related applications. Although considerable progress has been achieved, the studies in this field are at the primary stage and further developments are required. First, as an essential component of the composites, the synthesis of graphene is not yet matured and the quality-control issues need to be addressed. New synthesis methods have to be developed for preparing high-quality graphene or graphene oxide sheets with high purity, tunable sizes of layers, compositions and defects. Second, the performance of graphene-based semiconductor composites is limited by the quantity of these composites and their microstructures. Therefore, a more careful design of the functional composites is required to obtain higher quality, more uniform morphology on the nanoscale and better photocatalytic properties. Third, the rapid development of material science and technique in the past few years has resulted in the creation of various advanced photocatalytic materials. Interesting properties may be explored by combining these novel photocatalysts with graphene or graphene oxide sheets. Finally, the mechanisms of photocatalytic enhancement by the graphene-based semiconductor composite systems are partly unclear. For example, whether the photocatalytic activity of TiO2–graphene composites is truly different from other TiO2–C (activated carbon, fullerenes, or carbon nanotubes) composite materials. Furthermore, the explanation of photocatalytic activity by the graphene content in the composites is still controversial. Therefore, more studies are needed to improve the general understanding of the enhancement mechanism of photocatalysts by graphene. Nevertheless, graphene-based semiconductor composite photocatalysts are expected to be developed as robust materials to address various environmental and energy-related issues.
