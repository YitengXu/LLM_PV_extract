Compared to A–D–A-type small-molecule acceptor IDIC-4F, IDT2-DFIC exhibits a low optical bandgap of 1.42 eV with strong absorption in the 450–874 nm region, and upshifted energy levels as an electron acceptor. Furthermore, the IDT2-DFIC-based devices exhibited higher and more balanced charge transport and smoother surface morphology. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the IDT2-DFIC-based devices is 10.06%, which is higher than that of the IDIC-4F-based devices (5.17%). Our work provides an efficient molecular design strategy to construct small molecule acceptors with near-infrared absorption.
1. Introduction
In the past few years, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure have attracted increasing attention because of their tunable energy levels, large absorption coefficient and proper aggregation property as well as low energy loss in OSCs.1–6 To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 15% have been reported in single-junction SMA-based polymer solar cells (PSCs).7–10 Since about 50% of solar radiation is at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, the development of A–D–A-type NF-SMAs with high absorption coefficients in the visible and NIR regions has attracted more attention.11–19 Among them, IDIC-4F and IT-4F are the most widely used NF-SMAs.20,21 However, IDIC-4F and IT-4F display optical band gaps (Eoptg) above 1.56 eV (absorption onsets below 800 nm), which is not beneficial for wide absorption in NIR regions. In order to solve this problem, various chemical modifications of IDIC-4F and IT-4F have been done. And most of the reports are based on A–D–A structural frameworks with an increasing number of rings of indacenodithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) units.22–29 However, these NF-SMAs usually have high planarity and suffer from strong aggregation in the solid state, which lead to large phase separation and reduced exciton diffusion/separation efficiencies of devices.
In this work, we report an A–D–D–A-type NIR NF-SMA (IDT2-DFIC) with dimerized IDT units (IDT2) as a donating core and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) as electron withdrawing end groups (Fig. 1). It was found that the absorption spectrum of IDT2-DFIC was effectively extended with the absorption edge at 874 nm due to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. In addition, dimerized IDT units are conducive to avoiding intermolecular aggregation for obtaining suitable phase separation domains. More interestingly, the optimized PSC device fabricated with PBDB-T as a donor and IDT2-DFIC as an acceptor achieved a PCE of up to 10.06% (and 5.17% for the IDIC-4F-based device).

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic route of IDT2-DFIC is shown in Fig. 1, and all the experimental details are presented in the ESI.†IDT2-DFIC showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as o-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane and chloroform. The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of IDT2-DFIC is 340 °C, which is higher than that of IDIC-4F (Td = 323 °C).30 Thus, the introduction of dimerized IDT units as the donating core is able to increase the thermal stability of IDT2-DFIC (Fig. S1, ESI†). The recorded DSC curves in Fig. S2 (ESI†) reveal that both IDIC-4F and IDT2-DFIC do not present any distinct endothermic and exothermic peaks during a heating and cooling process from 100 °C to 250 °C under an N2 atmosphere. It indicates that IDIC-4F and IDT2-DFIC could be amorphous in the given temperature range.
2.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of IDT2-DFIC and IDIC-4F were measured in chloroform solution and the thin film state (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3, ESI†). Because of the enhanced ICT effect, IDT2-DFIC shows broad absorption bands ranging from 450 to 850 nm in solution, whereas IDIC-4F only absorbs light from 450 to 750 nm. Moreover, IDT2-DFIC shows maximum UV-vis absorption at 707 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.23 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which is also larger than that of IDIC-4F (0.73 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 663 nm). In the film state, the absorption onset of IDT2-DFIC extends to 874 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap (Eoptg) of 1.42 eV, which is decreased by approximately 0.21 eV when compared with IDIC-4F. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Table 1, the LUMO energy levels of IDT2-DFIC and IDIC-4F were estimated to be −3.97 and −4.11 eV, respectively. The HOMO energy levels of IDT2-DFIC and IDIC-4F were estimated to be −5.39 and −5.79 eV, respectively. Interestingly, IDT2-DFIC shows a higher ELUMO compared with IDIC-4F because of the strong electron donor ability of the dimerized IDT units (Fig. 3). The relatively high ELUMO for IDT2-DFIC is beneficial to achieve high Voc in PSCs, given the strong correlation between the Voc and the difference between the EHOMO of the donor and the ELUMO of the acceptor in PSCs.31–34

2.3 Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of IDT2-DFIC and IDIC-4F, we fabricated PSCs with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Upon the optimization of the film preparation (Fig. S5–S10, ESI†), the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC devices showed a PCE of 10.06% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 16.06 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.22%. The PBDB-T:IDIC-4F devices showed a PCE of 5.17% with a Voc of 0.64 V, a Jsc of 13.13 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.56% (Fig. 4a). The higher Voc of the IDT2-DFIC-based device is due to its higher LUMO energy level (−3.97 eV) than that (−4.11 eV) of IDIC-4F. Moreover, the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC devices show a low energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc) of 0.51 eV, which is lower than that of the PBDB-T:IDIC-4F devices (0.99 eV). The IDT2-DFIC-based device exhibited a broader photo-to-current response range of 300–900 nm, compared with that (300–800 nm) of the IDIC-4F-based device. Besides, the EQE of the IDT2-DFIC-based device was higher than that of the IDIC-4F-based device, and the maximum EQE values of the IDT2-DFIC and IDIC-4F based devices reached 71% and 61%, respectively (Fig. 4b). The calculated Jsc obtained from the EQE curves was 15.50 and 12.79 mA cm−2 for the IDT2-DFIC and IDIC-4F based devices, respectively, which are close to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. We also measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) to investigate the charge generation, dissociation, and extraction properties (Fig. 4c). Assuming all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes, the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) is only limited by the total amount of absorbed incident photons, thus the value of Jsc/Jsat characterizes the charge extraction under short-circuit conditions. Jsat was calculated to be 14.18 mA cm−2 and 16.54 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:IDIC-4F and PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC-based devices, which were calculated by fitting the curve of the net photocurrent. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss = Jsc/Jsat) were calculated to be 93% and 97%, respectively. The higher exciton dissociation probabilities indicate that the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes are quite efficient in the devices, especially in the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC-based devices. A dark current density (J0) of 1.60 × 10−8 mA cm−2 and 1.00 × 10−6 mA cm−2 was obtained for the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC and PBDB-T:IDIC-4F-based devices at dark saturation (Fig. 4d). The better overall diode characteristics suggest that the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC-based devices have lower recombination of free carriers and better efficiency of carrier extraction than the PBDB-T:IDIC-4F-based devices.35–37

2.4 Charge mobility and film morphology
The hole-only and electron-only devices were investigated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method,36,37 and the related data are summarized in Table 2. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC blend films without post treatment were 3.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and μh and μe were enhanced to 5.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the films with thermal annealing (TA) treatment. The PBDB-T:IDIC-4F blend films without post treatment showed 6.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and μh and μe were enhanced to 1.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the films with TA treatment. Compared with the IDIC-4F blend films (μh/μe = 1.52), the IDT2-DFIC blend films showed more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.07). Obviously, the higher and more balanced hole–electron mobility of the IDT2-DFIC-based devices is in favor of the higher FF level in the devices (Fig. 5).38–41

The morphology of the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC and PBDB-T:IDIC-4F blend films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 6, without post treatment, the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC and PBDB-T:IDIC-4F blend films showed root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of 3.61 and 3.38 nm, respectively. After TA treatment, the RMS roughness slightly decreased to 3.21 nm for PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC and 3.27 nm for PBDB-T:IDIC-4F. The smooth surface suggests good miscibility of PBDB-T with IDT2-DFIC or IDIC-4F within the films, which is essential for practical applications. Besides, more obvious fiber-like nanostructures were observed for the PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC blend films, which contributes to good charge transportation and higher device performance.42–45

3. Conclusion
In summary, an A–D–D–A-type NIR NF-SMA IDT2-DFIC has been synthesized. Compared to A–D–A-type small-molecule acceptor IDIC-4F, IDT2-DFIC exhibits a low Eoptg of 1.42 eV with strong absorption in the 450–874 nm region, and suitable energy levels as an electron acceptor. Furthermore, PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC blend films exhibited higher and more balanced charge transport properties and smoother surface morphology. The PSCs based on PBDB-T:IDT2-DFIC showed a high PCE of 10.06%, with a low Eloss of 0.51 eV, while the PBDB-T:IDIC-4F-based devices gave an inferior PCE of 5.17% with an Eloss of 0.99 eV. Our study suggests an efficient molecular design strategy to construct NF-SMAs with NIR absorption.
