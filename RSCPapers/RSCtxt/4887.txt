Introduction
Recent studies on siloles (silacyclopentadienes) have revealed that these materials possess a number of favorable attributes for application in organic electronics. Electron mobilities ca. two orders of magnitude higher than that of tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium (Alq3), which is widely used as an electron-transport (ET) material in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), has been measured for some siloles.1 The electron affinities of 1,1-diaryl-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsiloles were recently measured using inverse-photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) and were found to be comparable to that for Alq3,2 suggesting comparable ease of electron injection. Many siloles exhibit very high photoluminescence  (PL ) quantum yields  in the solid state (as high as 97 ± 3%),3 suggesting applications as lumophores.4 Utilizing these properties, some groups have developed silole-based electrogenerated chemiluminescence ,5 and constructed chemo- and biosensors  for detecting chemical (e.g., explosives and chromium(VI))6 and biological analytes (e.g., antibodies).7 Light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been fabricated using siloles as emissive or ET layers and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) as high as 8% were achieved.8 Organic solar cells have been fabricated using a blend of silolepolymers and the soluble fullerene derivative PCBM as the active layer, with power conversion efficiencies as high as 5.4% being reported under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G.9 Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have been fabricated using fused-ring siloles—either small molecules or polymers—as the active layer with the highest hole mobility reported being 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1.10Siloles are also attractive in that simple synthetic modifications can provide significant control of the electronic properties through varying either the donor/acceptor strength of the exo-cyclic substituents or the position of those substituents on the silole ring. Several review articles have summarized the synthesis and characterization of silole small molecules and polymers.11 In the present review we present the most recent developments on the molecular engineering of siloles, in particular the effect of substituents on electronic structure and on organic electronic device behavior.
Role of the silicon atom
The use of simple siloles for electron-transport applications is intrinsically linked to their ease of reduction. To help explain this ease of reduction of siloles, compared to dienes  such as cyclopentadiene, which have superficially similar molecular structures, and to help provide a framework for understanding some of the substituent effects discussed in subsequent sections, we briefly review the electronic structure of the basic silole ring system, C4H4SiX2. Although the stabilization of the LUMO  of silole relative to that of a diene  has been attributed to overlap between the LUMO  of the diene  portion and an empty 3d on silicon,12 Hartree–Fock studies led Yamaguchi and Tamao to identify the relevant silicon-based orbital as a local Si–X σ-antibonding MO.13a Several other computational studies employing different computational methods2,13 also support the idea of π*–σ* conjugation, which is shown schematically in Fig. 1, along with the essentially diene -like HOMO .13c
 Fig. 1  Schematic partial MO diagram for a silole showing that the HOMO  is similar to that of a diene , while the LUMO  is stabilized by the interaction of the diene LUMO  with a Si–C σ* orbital. 

Siloles can also be compared to their ring-expanded analogues, 1,2-disilacyclohexadienes (Fig. 2).14 While X-ray crystallography shows that the five-membered rings of siloles such as 1 are nearly planar,15 the additional SiMe2 group renders the central ring of 2 markedly non-planar.14a The crystal structures of dithienodisilacyclohexadienes also show highly non-planar six-membered rings.14b The difference in geometry of 1 and 2 leads to different electronic properties. 1 shows two irreversible oxidation peaks and two irreversible reduction peaks in its cyclic voltammogram. In contrast to 1, 2 shows only two irreversible oxidation peaks, the first of which occurs at ca. 0.4–0.5 V less oxidising potential than that of 1.14a DFT calculations also suggest 2 to be less readily reduced than 1 due to less efficient π*–σ* conjugation.14a Dithienodisilahexadiene derivatives have also been found to be slightly more readily oxidised than their dithienosilole analogues.14b Absorption maxima for 2 are blue-shifted relative to 1 (340 vs. 361 nm in CHCl3), presumably again reflecting less stabilisation of the LUMO  in the former compound. The fluorescence of 1 is weak in solution, but considerably brighter in the solid state,16 while 2 shows hardly any emission in either solution or solid state.14 This difference, at least in solution, may be related to increased conformational flexibility associated with the non-planar six-membered ring.

1,1-Substituent effects
A variety of different groups have been introduced in the 1,1-positions of siloles.2,17,18 However, the effects of the substituents on the silicon atom are generally rather slight and are largely inductive in nature, as shown, for example, by Hartree–Fock calculations.17a Both frontier orbitals  are stabilised or destabilised by σ-electron-withdrawing and -donating groups, respectively, with the LUMO  being slightly more sensitive, due to the contributions from Si–X π*–σ* conjugation discussed above. Accordingly, more electronegative 1,1-substituents generally lead to slightly longer absorption maxima. Thus, Yamaguchi et al. found that the absorption maxima of siloles3 (Fig. 3) shifted to longer wavelengths in the order of H < alkyl < Ph < F (from 305 to 318 nm in CHCl3).17a Absorption data for 5a–c (Fig. 3, Table 1) are consistent with the same trend.2

Electrochemical data also support the picture described above: the peak oxidation potentials of siloles4 (Fig. 3) vary from +0.61 to +1.02 V vs. FeCp2+/0 between R1 = R2 = SnMe3 and R1 = R2 = Cl examples, the trend following the inductive electron-withdrawing strength of the substituent.17b,19 The peak potentials for siloles5 (Fig. 3, Table 1) show a similar trend. Comparison of the 1,1-dithienyl example, 5b, with 5a again emphasises the dominance of inductive effects; 2-thienyl is a π-donor but a σ-acceptor.2 Thin-film ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities (EAs)20 measured by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and inverse-photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES), respectively, for siloles5 are also shown in Table 1; the data are broadly consistent with the electrochemical picture, although the differences between 5a and 5b are largely masked by experimental uncertainties.2
It is worth pointing out that solid-state IPs and EAs are important in assessing the applicability of organic materials in electronic devices. Although IPs and EAs can be estimated from solution electrochemical data, the values in Table 1 are the first direct measurements for siloles; the experimental IPs are considerably higher than those for typical hole-transport materials such as N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-di(3-methylphenyl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (TPD) (5.38 eV, adiabatic),21 while the EAs may be compared to an IPES value of −2.0 to −2.5 eV for the widely used ET material, Alq3.22 This suggests that hole injection barriers into these materials are expected to be rather large, while electron-injection barriers similar to those obtained with Alq3 may be achievable for the more electron-poor examples.
An alternative means of adjusting the electronic properties of silolesvia the 1,1-substituents is to incorporate these two substituents into a cycloalkyl ring, as in siloles6 (Fig. 3).14a,18X-Ray crystallography indicates that the strain induced by the spiro structure in 6a both lengthens the exocyclic silicon–carbon bonds and twists the two Si–CH2 bonds from being perpendicular with the ring. DFT calculations indicate that these geometric changes decrease the extent of the antibonding interaction between the silicon p-orbital and the 1,1-disubstituted carbon orbitals, leading to an overall stabilisation of the σ*–π* LUMO  relative to that of the unstrained analogue 1 (Fig. 1).14a Accordingly, relative to 1, 6a is some 0.23 V more readily reduced and exhibits red-shifted absorption and fluorescence maxima.14a Expansion of the exocyclic ring leads to decreased ease of reduction, consistent with a less strained structure (although the potentials cannot be directly compared to that for 1 due to different solvents employed in the two studies). Interestingly, the absorption and emission maxima for the species with largest exocyclic ring, 6c, are blue-shifted with respect to those of 1 (Table 2).18a The MO picture that emerges from Hartree–Fock calculations is consistent with DFT studies on 6a.18a

2,5-Substituent effects
Several studies have examined the effects of 2,5-substitution in siloles.23 Yamaguchi et al. investigated absorption, fluorescence and cyclic voltammetry of a wide range of siloles in which the aryl groups in the 2- and 5-positions are varied; some of these compounds are shown in Fig. 4 with data in Table 3.23a While substitution at the silicon atom has principally inductive effects on the electronic and optical properties of siloles, the 2,5-substituents have both σ- and π-effects on the electronic and optical properties. For examples in which the aryl groups are m- and p-substituted phenyl groups, including 7a–d (Fig. 4), the electrochemical peak oxidation and reduction potentials can be correlated with the Hammett coefficients σ+ and σ−, respectively, i.e. on the ability of the substituent in that position to stabilise a positive or negative charge, respectively, through the phenyl group through both inductive (σ) and resonance (π) effects. In particular strong π-donors (such as p-NMe2) lead to facile oxidation, whereas strong π-acceptors (p-NO2) lead to facile reduction, with groups having strong π-donor or -acceptor effects exhibiting considerably red-shifted absorption maxima with respect to groups exerting primarily inductive effects. The combination of the silole ring with other electron-rich or electron-poor heteroaromatic rings in the 2,5-positions has also been used to tune the redox potentials of siloles;23a in particular, the series with five-membered heterocycles (7e–g) all exhibit similar optical spectra, while the ease of oxidation decreases and the ease of reduction increases consistent with the π-electron-donating and withdrawing character of the heterocycles. The case of 2-thienyl (7e) substituents serves as another example of the different nature of electronic effects in the 2,5- vs. 1,1-positions;23a in the former they act as π donors, while, as discussed in the previous section, in the latter they act as weakly inductively electron-withdrawing groups.2

These substituent effects can readily be rationalised by reference to the partial MO diagram of Fig. 1. Both the HOMO  and LUMO  of the silole core have considerable π-character on carbon positions 2 and 5 and so both frontier orbitals can overlap with π-orbitals associated with the aryl groups in these positions. This is confirmed by several quantum-chemical studies of 2,5-diarylsiloles; for example, DFT calculations show that the HOMO  and LUMO  of 1 are destabilised and stabilised, respectively, relative to those of 1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylsilole due to extension onto the 2,5-phenyl groups.23b However, the dihedral angle between aryl and silole rings plays an important role; thus, replacement of phenyl groups with 1-naphthyl groups in the 2- and 5-positions (7h) leads to blue shifts of absorption and fluorescence (Table 3), presumably due to higher dihedral angles  arising from the greater steric bulk of the naphthyl groups, while in general, replacement of phenyl with substituents having more extended conjugation, but comparable or reduced steric hindrance, as in the styryl- or biphenyl-substituted siloles (7i and 7j), leads to bathochromic shift  in absorption and emission maxima relative to 1.23a Replacement of the styryl groups of 7i with bulkier 2,2-diphenylvinyl or triphenylvinyl groups has also been found to lead to blue-shifted absorption maxima, as well as greatly reduced fluorescence quantum yields, and to less facile and less reversible electrochemical reduction.5 The effects of extended conjugation in the 2- and 5-positions can be compared to that in 1,1-positions; an electrochemical, PES, IPES, optical, and computational study indicates that replacement of the 2,5-phenyl groups of 5a with dimethylfluoren-2-yl groups (11a, discussed in the following section) leads to much larger changes in the electronic properties than introduction of the dimethylfluorenyl groups into the 1,1-positions.24
Arylethynyl groups have also been introduced into the 2,5-positions of siloles.5,23c–d In one study, donor and acceptor aryl groups were introduced in an asymmetric fashion so that silole is essentially a bridging group in a π-conjugated donor–acceptor system; as shown for three examples (8a–c, Fig. 4, Table 3), sequentially increasing the asymmetry results in increasingly bathochromic shifts  in the electronic absorption spectra.23c The magnitude of this effect is similar to that seen in comparable donor–acceptor systems in which the central silole ring is replaced with a p-phenylene group25 or removed to leave a diyne.26 Furthermore, among the siloles with arylethynyl groups at 2,5-positions, simple structural modifications on the terminal arenes (e.g., increasing the size of the alkyl groups on the terminal arenas) resulted in significant increase in fluorescence quantum efficiencies (Φf) with minimal effect on emission wavelengths.23d Replacing a single phenyl group on 8a (Φf = 9%) with a mesityl group (Φf = 10%) exhibits a minor impact, but switching both phenyl groups to both mesityl groups leads to marked luminescence enhancement (Φf = 30%). Further changing the mesityl groups with triisopropylphenyl groups results in a further increase in Φf (41%).
The bis(dipyridyl)-substituted silole9 (Fig. 4, Table 3) is among the most promising siloles for organic electronic applications;1,3,23b,23e–f the electron mobility of 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 is the highest measured for siloles and is independent of exposure to air, and efficient OLEDs have been fabricated using this compound as an electron-transport material. Optical and device behaviour has been compared to a number of related species; the experimental spectra and DFT frontier orbital energies23b are similar to that of the analogous pyridyl derivative,23e the calculations indicating that the frontier orbitals do not extend onto the outer pyridyl ring.23b The solid-state device behaviour has not been fully accounted for in terms of solution molecular properties and it has been speculated that the molecular packing and intermolecular interactions play important roles in this material.23b
3,4-Substituent effects
Although the 1,1- and 2,5-substituents of siloles has been extensively varied, there have been only a few reports on the effect of 3,4-substituents on electronic structures of siloles,11d,24,27 in part due to synthetic limitations. In the series of 1,1-dimethyl-2,5-dithienyl derivatives formed by 7e and 10b–c, the fused-ring alkyl and phenyl substituents lead to blue and red shifts, respectively, in both absorption and fluorescence spectra,27 while if 10a is compared to 1, removal of the phenyl groups leads to a red shift in absorption, but a very slight red shift in the emission maximum. The presence of 3,4-phenyl groups also significantly reduces the fluorescence quantum yields, presumably due to the availability of additional torsional modes. In the comparison of 10a–c, the differing torsion angles, resulting from different degrees of steric crowding, presumably plays a role. For compounds 11a and 11b (Fig. 5, Table 4) the phenyl and 9,9-dimethylfluoren-2-yl groups presumably exert similar steric demands (similar dihedral angles are obtained by DFT calculations for the two structures) and the electronic effects can be compared more directly.24 While replacement of the 2,5-phenyl groups of 5a (Fig. 3, Table 1) with 9,9-dimethylfluoren-2-yl groups to afford 11a leads to increased ease of both oxidation and reduction, and to red-shifted absorption and fluorescence spectra, consistent with extension of both HOMO  and LUMO  over a larger π system, introduction of additional fluorenyl groups in the 3,4-positions leads to little change in spectra and to slightly more facile reduction and slightly less facile oxidation,24 suggesting that inductive effects dominate over orbital delocalisation. These results can be understood by DFT results for 2,3,4,5-tetraarylsiloles which show considerably less extension of both HOMO  and LUMO  onto the 3,4-aryl groups than onto the 2,5-groups,2,14a,23b,24 which may, at least in part, be interrelated with the observation that larger dihedral angles  are generally found both crystallographically and computationally between the 3,4-rings and the silole ring, than between the 2,5-rings and the silole ring.2,14a,15,24

Fused-ring siloles
Recently, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole derivatives (Fig. 6) have become widely used building blocks for incorporation into conjugated molecules and polymers.14b,28 The HOMOs  of these species might be anticipated to resemble those of 2,2′-bithiophenes. Thus, 12a is oxidised at +0.78 V vs. FeCp2+/0, which is similar to, but slightly more anodic than, that at which its dialkyl-bridged bithiophene analogues, 13, are oxidised.14b Hartree–Fock calculations, however, suggest considerable stabilisation of the LUMO  relative to that of other bithiophene derivatives, presumably due to the characteristic π*–σ* conjugation of siloles. Consistent with this prediction, the absorption maximum of 12a (356 nm in THF) is red-shifted from those of either 13 (323 nm) or 2,2′-bithiophene, 14a (304 nm). The absorption is also red-shifted relative to siloles free of conjugated substituents at the 2- ,3- , 4- and 5-positions, such as 3, but blue-shifted with respect to 2,5-dithienyl siloles.14b The low LUMO  energy of dithienosiloles, compared to that of bithiophenes, has also led to their use as electron-transport materials,14b,28c while their oligothiophene character has led to use of some examples as hole-transport materials.28b
 Fig. 6  Some of the many dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole derivatives that have been studied (12), along with bithiophene derivatives (13, 14) with which they are compared in the text, related fused ring systems (15, 16), and some molecules containing linked dithienosilole building blocks (17, 18). 
A wide variety of 2,6-substituted dithienosilole derivatives have been studied and generally their optical and electrochemical properties parallel those of analogous bithiophenes. Thus, substitution of the dithienosilole core with a strongly π-accepting tricyanovinyl group to give 12b leads to considerable red-shifted absorption (to 512 nm in THF) and emission (574 nm), presumably due to the donor–acceptor character of 12b, as does substitution of bithiophene to give 14b (λmaxabs = 484, λmaxem = 563 nm);28a12b and 14b also exhibit reductions, presumably acceptor-based, at much less reducing potentials than 12a and 14a. Similarly, as expected for bithiophene derivatives, extension of the π-system through the presence of additional thiophene, benzene, or pyridine rings (as in the examples shown in Fig. 6) leads to red shifts of absorption and fluorescence maxima and to increased ease of oxidation (the effect on the oxidation potential being greatest for electron-rich thienyl substituents and least for electron-poor pyridyl groups; few reduction potentials have been published).28c As one might expect, additional ring fusions, as in 15, leads to a red-shift in absorption and emission compared to the 12a and slightly more facile oxidation, while replacement of the thiophene rings of 15 with pyrrole rings in 16 leads to a further red shift and to increased ease of oxidation.28e
Oligomers containing more than one dithienosilole unit have also been synthesised.28b,f As one would expect from oligothiophene chemistry, linkage through the 2/2,6-positions to form a dimer (17a) or trimer (17b) leads to red-shifted absorption (453 and 498 nm, respectively, in THF) and emission (533 and 576 nm, respectively) maxima relative to corresponding monomeric species.28c Other through-conjugated linkages also lead to significant red shifts, while a compound with a pyridine-2,6-diyl bridge (17c) exhibits much less shift relative to appropriate monomeric model compounds.28c As one might expect from the principally inductive effects of the substituents in simple siloles (see above), linkage of two dithienosiloles through the Si atom with alkanediyl or arenylene bridges has very little effect at all on the spectra; 18 exhibits an absorption maximum of 360 nm in THF, very similar to that of the corresponding monomeric species.28f
Other fused-ring siloles include dibenzo derivatives and their spiro-derivatives (including 19, Fig. 7); the spiro derivatives have been shown to exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields (0.31–0.54) in the solid state.29 The phenyl-substituted dibenzosilole derivative, 19, shows an absorption maximum (304 nm in THF) similar to those of siloles free of conjugated substituents in the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-positions, such as 3, and moderately red-shifted with respect to analogous phenyl-substituted spirofluorene derivatives and to terphenyl. As expected, extension of conjugation by replacement of the phenyl group by biphenyl leads to a further red shift and increased ease of reduction (and surprisingly, to little change in the ease of oxidation). Finally, we note that compounds 20a and 20b can be regarded as containing one or two pairs of fused siloles, respectively.30 The absorption maximum of 20a is at 360 nm in THF, considerably red-shifted relative to that of related dibenzosiloles, such as 19, while the additional conjugation present in 20b leads to a maximum of 424 nm. These compounds can also be regarded as SiMe2-bridged derivatives of trans-stilbene and (E,E)-1,4-bis(styryl)benzene, respectively, and show considerably red-shifted spectra with respect to those species; in part this can be attributed to planarisation, but experimental and computational comparison of 20a with its CMe2-bridged analogue show that the silicon also has an electronic effect, demonstrating once more the role played by π*–σ* conjugation in silole-like systems.

Conclusions and outlook
High-efficiency light-emitting diodes, organic solar cells, high-mobility field-effect transistors, and fluorescent detection of TNT-type explosives have all been reported based on silole derivatives, indicating the potential importance of siloles to materials chemistry. A key challenge related to all these areas of application is to control electronic structures and properties of organic semiconductors by modifying their chemical structures. Therefore, we have surveyed what is known about the relationships between silole structures and optical and electronic properties, since such an understanding is a basic requirement for rational design of the functional molecules. To summarise:
(1) The presence of the silicon atom in the silole core plays a key role in determining electronic structures, absorption, emission, energy levels, and charge transport properties of siloles through π*–σ* conjugation.
(2) The electronic properties can be tuned through varying either the donor/acceptor strength of the exo-cyclic substituents, with the effects of substitution differing between different positions on the silole ring. In simple siloles, substituents in the 2,5-positions typically exhibit the largest effects on the redox and optical properties of the siloles.
(3) The 1,1-substituents exert primarily inductive effects upon the properties of the silole core; accordingly, although strong σ-acceptors may be used to lower both HOMO  and LUMO , both increasing the ease of reduction and decreasing the ease of oxidation, and having only minor effects upon absorption and fluorescence spectra.
(4) Substitution at the 2,5-positions provides the greatest potential for tuning the optical properties of siloles since these substituents can exhibit strong π-interactions with the silole core, allowing one to destabilise the HOMO  through the use of strong π-donors, or stabilise the LUMO  through the use of strong π-acceptors.
(5) The properties of fused-ring siloles can be understood by analogy to related silicon-free systems (bithiophenes in the case of dithienosiloles) and simple siloles.

Quantum yields are in many cases much higher in the solid state than in solution; this effect has been referred to as “aggregation-induced emission” and can be understood in terms of suppression in the solid state of internal conversion mechanisms associated with torsions around substituent–silole bonds:
