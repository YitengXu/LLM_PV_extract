    , Accepted 22nd September 2022First published on 24th September 2022AbstractThe compromise between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) poses a big challenge for high performance semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs). Herein, a molecular weight-regulated efficient sequential deposition (SD) strategy is first employed to improve the performance of ST-OSCs.

Broader context
The compromise between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) poses a big challenge when attempting to fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs). Herein, we report a molecular weight-regulated efficient sequential deposition (SD) strategy, which is first employed to improve the performance of ST-OSCs. Four batches of the narrow bandgap polymer donor PCE10-2F with different molecular weights were synthesized. Simply regulating the molecular weights of the polymer is discovered to well balance independent film formation and miscibility of the donor/acceptor interface during the SD process. Combined with the acceptor Y6 film optimized by dual additives, the overall performance of SD-processed devices achieves superior performance compared to those of BC-processed devices, thanks to the favorable morphology, optimized charge dynamics and reduced energy loss. Optical simulations reveal that the SD process favors a convenient and precise control of an individual layer for the optimization of light transmission with limited degradation in device performance. The corresponding ST-OSCs achieve high PCEs of 11.11–10.01% and high AVTs of 39.93–50.05%, showing breakthrough performance in ST-OSCs. More importantly, a successful balance of PCE and AVT produces a LUE of 5.01%, which is a champion value of ST-OSCs without complex optical engineering.

1. Introduction
Organic semiconductor materials have shown discontinuous absorption, which can selectively absorb invisible light wavelengths that the human eye cannot perceive, while transmitting visible light that the human eye can perceive. These features make organic semiconductors have unique advantages in the preparation of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs).1–4 The application of ST-OSCs on architectural surfaces (e.g. panes, building facades) is very significant and has been considered as a promising candidate for building integrated photovoltaics.5–7 To date, the development of high-performance ST-OSCs is becoming the next research focus in the rapidly growing field of organic solar cells (OSCs).8–12
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST-OSCs is far behind those of opaque devices, because apart from PCE, evaluation of ST-OSC device performance also needs to consider other key factors, including average visible transmittance (AVT), color rendering index (CRI), color coordinates, and color temperature.13 Generally, for practical ST-OSC applications, the AVT value of ST-OSC devices should exceed at least 25% to meet the practical applications.14–17 Actually, an AVT of 50% is the prerequisite for power-window application.18 However, ST-OSCs that have such high AVT but still possess high efficiency are rarely reported. It is because the pursuit of high transmittance inevitably leads to low light utilization and photocurrent loss, causing a significant decrease in the PCEs. The compromise between the PCE and the AVT poses a big challenge when attempting to fabricate highly efficient ST-OSCs. Therefore, all-narrow bandgap (all-NBG) materials (Eoptg ≤ 1.6 eV) with strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region are often selected as the active layer of ST-OSCs, including NBG donors and NBG acceptors.19 To more intuitively evaluate the comprehensive performance of ST-OSCs, light utilization efficiency (LUE) (LUE = PCE × AVT) is used to assess the balance of PCE and AVT in a ST-OSC.20–22 In recent years, ST-OSCs have made great progress by designing near-infrared absorption organic semiconductors, adjusting device structures, and developing high transparent electrodes.23–27 For example, NBG acceptors with strong near-infrared absorption and good visible light transmission were developed for the multifunctional ST-OSC devices, such as colorful or infrared reflection of heat dissipation devices.24,28,29 To date, an advanced ST-OSC has achieved an impressive PCE of 14.15% but has a low AVT of 20.0% and a low LUE of only 2.83%.30 Recently, favored by the combination of outcoupling coating with an anti-reflection layer, the LUE of the device has reached over 5.0%, but it required very complex optical engineering, which is not conducive to mass production.14,31
In traditional ST-OSCs, one-step blend casting (BC) is the most prevalent method for the preparation of an active layer, constructing a bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) with molecularly mixed domains of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials. To achieve a highly efficient ST-OSC, besides maximizing the selective absorption of invisible light, an ideal BHJ active layer must allow optimal charge dynamics, including fast exciton dissociation, efficient and balanced charge transport. However, the morphology of the BC active layers is very complex and highly relies on both intrinsic properties of the materials (e.g. solubility, aggregation, and D/A interfacial interaction) and the fabrication conditions (e.g. D:A ratio, solvents, and optimal treatment).32 Therefore, precisely controlling the microstructures of the BC films to develop the favorably vertical distribution of the D:A blend (p–i–n structure) is a key challenge for BHJ solar cells.33–36 In addition, the absorption of the donor is usually in or partly in the visible light region, thus regulation of the D/A ratio is necessary to improve AVT; however, the D/A in BHJ needs to be fixed in a certain ratio to obtain the best performance, severely limiting the independent optimization of each component in ST-OSCs. Moreover, the BHJ structure contains a large number of D/A interfaces that cause light scattering and parasitic absorption, resulting in light loss in the devices.37
Sequential deposition (SD) technology is a two-step deposition to form quasi-layer-by-layer structure, where the donor material and the acceptor material are deposited sequentially.38 Compared to BC, SD has some unique advantages: (1) Donors and acceptors can be independently controlled and regulated, such as their thickness, crystallinity, etc. (2) The SD-processed active layer can enrich the donor at the anode and the acceptor at the cathode, thus forming an ideal vertical distribution of the D/A, which can improve the charge selectivity transport and suppress charge accumulation and recombination at interfaces. (3) The significantly reduced D/A interfaces can effectively reduce light scattering and parasitic absorption, improving the light transmission.37,39 However, there are still two key issues that should be addressed for developing high performance SD devices. On one hand, both D and A materials should possess high crystallinity and self-standing film-forming properties to prevent the underlying layer from being washed away during the deposition process of the upper layer; on the other hand, moderate compatibility at the D/A interface is also critical to improve the D/A interaction and construct a favorable p–i–n architecture for efficient charge dissociation and transport.40 How to balance the above two contradictory issues is very crucial and still needs to be addressed for SD devices. Although the two-step SD method has been regarded as a potential alternative to the one-step BC method for producing highly efficient and stable OSCs, to date, research on the SD-processed ST-OSCs is still limited.
Herein, we report a molecular weight-regulated efficient SD strategy, which is first employed to improve the performance of the ST-OSCs. Four batches of the NBG polymer donor PCE10-2F with different molecular weights were synthesized. It has been found that adjusting the molecular weight can fine-tune the crystallinity of the polymer donor, not only facilitating the formation of dense and robust films for an efficient SD process, but also rationally controlling the compatibility of the D/A to enhance favorable interfacial contact for charge dissociation and transport. Combined with the acceptor Y6 film optimized by dual additives, the selective absorption of the active layer in the invisible light region is further improved. The overall performance of SD-processed devices achieves superior performance compared to that of BC-processed devices, thanks to the favorable morphology, optimized charge dynamics and reduced energy loss. The SD-processed PCE10-2F:Y6-based opaque device achieves a record PCE of 14.53%. At the same time, optical simulations reveal that the SD process favors a convenient and precise control of an individual layer for the optimization of light transmission with limited degradation in device performance. The corresponding ST-OSCs achieve high PCEs of 11.11–10.01% and high AVTs of 39.93–50.05%, showing breakthrough performance in ST-OSCs. More importantly, a successful balance of PCE and AVT produces a LUE of 5.01%, which is a champion value of ST-OSCs without complex optical engineering.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Optoelectronic characterization

Fig. 1a presents the chemical structures of PCE10-2F and Y6. A series of polymer donors (PCE10-2F) with different molecular weights were readily synthesized via the Stille reaction by simply changing the reaction time.13,23 The Experimental section of the Supporting Information gives the detailed synthesis and characterizations (Fig. S1, ESI†). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the four polymer donors are determined to be 32.4, 40.8, 53.3 and 61.1 kDa, and the polydispersity index (PDI) is 2.33, 2.04, 2.04 and 1.33, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). According to the Mn, the four polymer donors are named as PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa, PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa and PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa.

UV-vis absorption spectra of pure PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa, PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa, PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa, and Y6 films are plotted in Fig. 1b. It can be found that all the polymer donors have strong absorption in the range of 600–800 nm with maximum peaks at ∼700 nm in the solid states, avoiding the sensitive band region of the human eyes to solar light (400–700 nm). The donor and acceptor show complementary absorption, in favor of efficient light utilization. The optical and electrochemical parameters of polymer donors are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The optical band gaps of PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa, PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa, PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa and Y6 calculated from the absorption spectra are 1.60, 1.59, 1.58, 1.57 and 1.33 eV, respectively. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels derived from cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Mn has a slight impact on the energy levels of the polymers. In Fig. 1c and Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), as Mn increases from 32.4 to 61.1 kDa, the HOMO levels increase slightly.
2.2 Molecular aggregation properties
The molecular aggregation property of the active layer materials, especially of the underlying materials, is very important, even decisive for the SD-processed devices.39,41 To evaluate the molecular aggregation behaviors of the polymers, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of PCE10-2F with different molecular weights were measured in chlorobenzene solutions (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4, Table S1, ESI†). The heating process of the polymer solutions was recorded from 20 °C to 100 °C (Fig. 2a–d). The absorption curves of these four polymer donors have two absorption peaks: the 0–1 peak corresponds to intramolecular charge transfer, the 0–0 peak is related to molecular aggregation, and the ratio of I0–0/I0–1 reflects the relative strength of molecular aggregation.42 Four polymers display distinct 0–0 peaks with much higher intensity than the 0–1 peaks, especially at low temperature, which is attributed to the intense pre-aggregation of polymers in their solutions. As the temperature increases, the 0–0 peak gradually decreases, and both 0–1 and 0–0 peaks are blue-shifted, corresponding to the destruction of pre-aggregation of the polymers. Fig. 2i shows the ratio of I0–0/I0–1 to estimate the aggregation degree. The I0–0/I0–1 values are 1.300, 1.398, 1.418 and 1.440 for PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa, PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa and PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The gradual increase in I0–0/I0–1 reveals progressively enhanced aggregation as the Mn of the polymer increases. It is worth noting that the pre-aggregations in the polymer solutions with Mn values of 53.3 kDa and 61.1 kDa are less temperature-dependent and more stable than the other counterparts, which can facilitate the formation of more dense thin films in actual devices. As revealed by Fig. 1c, the molecular weights do affect the absorption profiles of these polymer donor films. With the increase of Mn, the 0–1 peaks of four polymers slightly red-shift, together with gradually increased (0–0) peaks, as a result, the I0–0/I0–1 significantly increases (Table S1, ESI†). These results indicate that increase of molecular weights induces stronger intermolecular interactions and higher crystallinity of the polymer films. We further compare PCE10-2F with the state-of-the-art NBG polymer PCE10 and wide-bandgap polymer PM6 (Fig. S5, ESI†). All the four PCE10-2F polymers show more favorable aggregation behavior than PCE10 and PM6, beneficial for the fabrication of SD devices. Fig. 2e–h show the absorption change of four polymers before and after being flushed with chloroform, a solvent used for the deposition of the upper layer in the SD process (see the ESI†). Obviously, thanks to the highly crystalline and dense film induced by the high molecular weight, the absorption spectra of polymers with higher Mn (PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa and PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa) hardly change before and after flushing, indicating good corrosion resistance of the polymers. In contrast, the absorption intensity of polymers with lower Mn (PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa and PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa) decreases significantly after chloroform flushing.

Apart from regulation of the molecular weights, the use of additives is also important to fine tune the molecular aggregation.43 It is well known that the crystallization and orientation of the photoactive materials are sensitive to solvent additives. The representative additives are 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). Taking PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa as an example, the normalized UV-Vis absorptions of PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa after being treated with different additives (0.5% CN, 0.5% DIO or 0.25% CN + 0.25% DIO) are shown in Fig. 2j. After normalization of the 0–0 peaks, all the 0–1 peaks of the additive-treated polymers increase with the decreased I0–0/I0–1 ratios, demonstrating that the additive treatment does not improve but reduces the crystallization of PCE10-2F. With the DIO additive, prolonging the treating time causes significant destruction of molecular aggregation (Fig. S6, ESI†). We further used the additives to regulate the molecular aggregation of acceptor Y6, as shown in Fig. 2k. The pristine Y6 shows a maximum absorption peak at 825 nm. With the addition of CN, DIO or CN + DIO, the maximum absorption peak shifts to 809, 846 and 843 nm, respectively. Notably, compared with the blue-shift band of the CN-treated Y6 film, the absorptions of DIO or CN + DIO-treated Y6 films undergo a distinct red-shift (by 21 nm and 18 nm respectively), implying the improved crystallinity of the acceptor films. From Fig. 2j and k, it can be seen that the additive treatment does not improve but reduces the crystallization of PCE10-2F, while treatment of the acceptor with DIO or CN + DIO additives can achieve red-shifted absorption and improved crystallinity, so we speculated that additive-free donors and DIO or CN + DIO-treated acceptor are more beneficial to achieve better device performance. Fig. 2l compares the normalized UV-Vis absorptions of the BC film (CN + DIO) and SD film (CN + DIO only for acceptor Y6). The peak A of the BC and SD films assigned to the polymer donor PCE10-2F is at about 710 nm, while the peak B assigned to the acceptor Y6 exhibits a red shift by 30 nm for the SD film (840 nm) relative to the BC film (810 nm). These findings agree with the above UV observations of the individual polymer donor and acceptor. Independently manipulating the donor and the acceptor by additives during the SD process achieves a superior absorption in the NIR region, which is beneficial to improve JSC but without affecting the AVT of ST-OSCs.
2.3 Molecular orientation and crystallinity
Molecular orientation and crystalline properties of the neat polymer donor and acceptor were investigated by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. 3 and Table S2, ESI†). All pristine polymer films display a face-on oriented structure with significant scattering in the out-of-plane (OOP) (010) direction (Fig. 3a–d). More importantly, the (010) scattering peaks of the polymers at a qz of 1.606–1.616 Å−1, assigned to the π–π stacking, become stronger and stronger as the Mn increases from 32.4 kDa to 61.1 kDa. The corresponding d-spacing of PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa, PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa and PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa is 3.912 Å, 3.898 Å, 3.893 Å, and 3.888 Å, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). Obviously, the gradually increased Mn favors a closer π–π stacking, which will facilitate charge transport in the vertical direction. The crystallite coherence length (CCL) values are 9.845 Å, 12.017 Å, 12.516 Å and 13.620 Å for PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa, PCE10-2F-40.8 kDa, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa and PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa, respectively. The crystal sizes also increase with the increase of Mn, which is consistent with the trend of polymer aggregation observed in temperature-dependent UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Therefore, the GIWAXS test illustrates that film aggregation and crystallinity have been well manipulated by controlling the molecular weights of the polymers.

The pristine Y6 film also exhibits a strong (010) peak and a weak (100) peak in the OOP and in-plane (IP) direction, respectively, indicative of a preferential face-on orientation (Fig. 3e).44 After being treated with a mixture of 0.25% DIO and 0.25% CN additive, the diffraction (010) peak of the Y6 film is shifted from 1.708 Å−1 to 1.764 Å−1, with the d-spacing decreasing from 3.679 Å to 3.562 Å (Fig. 3f and Table S2, ESI†). The related CCL of the double-additive-treated film is much longer than that of the pristine film (38.396 Å vs. 24.44 Å). In particular, the double-additive-treated film emerges at a new peak at qz = 0.589 Å, suggesting the multi-scale ordered stacking of Y6 (Fig. 3g). These signals of the GIWAXS measurement demonstrate the crystallinity of the Y6 film after additive treatment has been greatly improved, as confirmed by the red-shifted absorption band of the additive treated film shown in Fig. 2k.
2.4 Traditionally opaque devices
To reveal the photovoltaic properties of the OSCs with PCE10-2F and Y6, the opaque devices were prepared via the BC and SD process with a traditional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO45/Ag. The structures of the active layer prepared by BC and SD methods are confirmed by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and the schematic diagrams of BC, SD processing methods and the corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. 4a–d. The SD device exhibits a quasi-bilayer structure with a donor/acceptor interface (Fig. 4b), whereas the BC device exhibits only a single active layer (Fig. 1d). According to the results of UV observation in Fig. 2, the strong corrosion resistance induced by high molecular weights can be effective against washing from the upper layer, which is very encouraging for layer-by-layer deposition (Fig. 4e). The active layer thickness of all BC and SD-OSCs is controlled at about 100 nm. Various optimization methods are performed to obtain the best device performance (Fig. S7 and Table S3, ESI†). It is worth noting that the optimal donor/acceptor ratio of the device processed by the BC method is 1:2, which is quite different from the 1:1.2 ratio widely used in Y-series solar cells, which may be due to the unique photo-electronic property of PCE10-2F (Fig. 1c and Fig. S4, ESI†). The accurate D/A ratio of the SD film is difficult to be evaluated. From Fig. 2l, we can see that the profiles of the two films are similar, but the intensity of the polymer donor in the SD film is slightly lower than that of the BC film, indicating that the D/A ratio is less than 1:2.

Fig. 5a shows the schematic representation of the final device structure. The J–V curves of high performance optimal devices recorded under simulated AM1.5G sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) are provided in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. According to the UV and GIWAXS results, for the SD devices, the polymer donor was deposited with no additive, but the acceptor Y6 was deposited with a mixture of 0.25% CN + 0.25% DIO as an additive to obtain the best performance. For the BC devices, the optimal fabrication condition is also with the 0.25% CN + 0.25% DIO as an additive. As shown in Table 1, the OSCs processed by the BC method performs similarly with PCEs ranging from 13.04% to 13.40%, indicating that the efficiency of BHJ devices is not sensitive to the batch of polymer PCE10-2F. However, the parameters of VOC, JSC and FF of the BHJ devices show a great difference. VOC decreases from 0.785V for PCE10-2F-33.4 kDa to 0.773V for PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa, resulting from their upshifted HOMO levels. The enhanced JSC with the Mn increasing is relative to the increased extinction coefficient of the polymers (Fig. S4, ESI†). When using the SD method to replace the BC method for device fabrication, the PCEs of the devices are distinctly improved, due to the improved VOC, JSC and FF. The SD-processed devices show a saddle-like trend of the performance that rises first and then falls, as the Mn of the polymers increases. Among these devices, the one based on PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa performs best, delivering an outstanding PCE of 14.53%, which shows significant improvement over the device by the BC process (PCE = 13.40%). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 14.53% is the champion performance for all-NBG materials-based OSCs. Such high efficiency is also the best device performance based on PCE10-based polymers (Table S4, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5c, compared with the BC-processed OSCs, SD-processed OSCs have significantly enhanced EQE responses in the NIR region (700–900 nm), associated with their higher JSC. The JSC values obtained from J–V curves (Fig. 5b) are consistent with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 5c and Fig. S8, ESI†) integrated current densities, indicating the good reliability of the results.

The charge dynamics were investigated to explain the JSC and FF difference between these devices. The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was performed to detect the charge carrier transport in the devices (Fig. S9 and Table S5, ESI†). As the molecular weight of PCE10-2F increases, both hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the device increase, which contributes to the improvement of JSC. In addition, the SD devices show a better μh/μe balance compared to the BC devices. More balanced charge mobilities demonstrate the reduced charge accumulation and recombination via the SD process, accounting for the improved FF. Expectedly, among these polymers, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa with highest JSC and FF shows the fastest and most balanced charge mobility. The charge recombination kinetics of the OSCs based on BC and SD operating conditions were also probed by the JSC and VOCversus light intensity (Plight) (Fig. S10, ESI†). The decrease in the slopes of kT/q and α values approaching 1 confirms the suppressed biomolecular and trap recombination in the SD device relative to the BC device.
The increase of VOC is the main factor for the improvement in the PCEs of the SD-processed devices relative to their corresponding BC processed ones. It has been reported that the DIO additive can promote the crystallinity and downshift LUMO of the acceptor Y6, leading to a distinct reduction in VOC of the devices.46 We speculate that the VOC difference of OSCs between SD and BC processes may be related to the effect of additives. Therefore, we investigated the effect of additive treatment on the performance of OSCs processed by SD and BC methods. The corresponding device performance and parameters are shown in Table S6 (ESI†). For all the SD-processed devices, when the donor is treated with the additive CN, there is little change in all performance parameters relative to the untreated devices, indicating that additive CN hardly affects the polymer donor. However, when the polymer donor is treated with the additive DIO, the PCEs of SD-processed devices decrease significantly. These results are consistent with the UV observation. Intriguingly, in the case of SD-processed PCE10-2F/Y6, the DIO additive exerts influence on both the donor and the acceptor, as revealed by the lower VOC of the DIO-treated single layer (PCE10-2F or Y6) than the untreated devices, and the lowest VOC is obtained by the DIO-treated double-layer (PCE10-2F and Y6). Similarly, the BC-processed devices with DIO or CN + DIO additives all obtain relatively low VOC values. In addition, for SD-processed OSCs, the VOC remarkably increases from 0.785 V to 0.794 V when molecular weights increase from 33.4 to 61.1 kDa, which is probably due to that as the Mn increases, the underlying donor forms a denser and more stable film to effectively avoid the penetration of the DIO additive into the underlying donor layer. However, a highly dense and crystalline film will also reduce the interface area and the interaction between the underlying donor and the upper acceptor, which strongly affects charge generation and collection. Consequently, PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa with the highest molecular weight does not obtain the best performance but shows a lower PCE of 13.82% together with reduced JSC and FF than PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa, despite its highest VOC and robust film-forming property (Fig. 5b–d and Table 1).
The top surface morphology of the blend films prepared by BC and SD methods was probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5d, g and Fig. S11, ESI†) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5e, h and Fig. S12, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), when the Mn of the donor PCE10-2F is 33.4 kDa, smooth surfaces appear in both BC and SD-processed active films, with the root mean square (RMS) of 1.27 and 1.78 nm, respectively. The similar roughness indicates that PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa and Y6 have been mixed similarly in SD-and BC-processed films, due to the low corrosion resistance of PCE10-2F-32.4 kDa. However, when the Mn gradually increases to 61.1 kDa, the RMS of the BC-processed films gradually increases to 2.28 nm and the phase separation becomes much larger, resulting from the gradually improved crystallinity of the polymer donor. The enlarged BHJ phase separation leads to a lower FF along with the Mn increase (Fig. S12, ESI†). The molecular weight-independent surface morphology is also observed for the SD films. In fact, for the SD processed films, AFM probes the surface of the Y6 film. With the increase of the Mn, the surface morphology of the film deposited using the SD method becomes much rougher, and the highest RMS of 3.78 nm is obtained for the PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa/Y6 film, which is the closest to the surface of the pristine Y6 film. This observation confirms that ideal vertical phase separation with the p–i–n junction has been established in the BC-processed blend films, which is conducive for efficient charge abstraction and suppressing charge recombination, consequently yielding the improved JSC and FF of SD-processed devices relative to their BC-processed counterparts (Fig. 5b and Table 1). However, PCE10-2F-61.1 kDa with the highest crystallinity effectively prevents the erosion of the upper Y6 film and produces the most standard layer-by-layer structure, but the worst mutual compatibility between the donor and the acceptor is detrimental for the optimization of the charge dynamics, accounting for its reduced PCE values (Table 1). Fig. 5f and i show the GIWAXS of the PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa/Y6 and PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa:Y6 films. In the BC film, a preferential face-on orientation is observed, with a prominent (100) peak at qxy = 0.0936 Å−1 in the IP direction, and a (010) peak at qz = 1.700 Å−1 in the OOP direction (Fig. S13, ESI†). However, in the SD film, there is a sharper (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.710 Å−1, associated with a d-spacing of 3.674 Å than that of the BC film (3.696 Å). In addition, the SD film also has a larger CCL than the BC film (19.861 Å vs. 18.452 Å). The tighter molecular packing and higher crystallinity of SD films are very helpful to enhance the charge transport. Moreover, the stacking of the films reflected by the morphology measurement is in accordance with their light absorption of the films.
Furthermore, the detailed component energy loss (Eloss) was further quantitatively analyzed by sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) and electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) experiments (Fig. 5j–l, Fig. S13, ESI† and Table 2). According to the theory of detailed balance, Eloss can be divided into three different components (Eloss = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3).47 The first part is the unavoidable energy loss (ΔE1), defined as the energy difference between the charge transfer state and the local excitation state of the donor or acceptor material. Devices based on BC and SD operating conditions have the same ΔE1 value (0.260 V). The second component (ΔE2) is from the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap. The SD device exhibits a lower non-ideal radiative attenuation value ΔE2 than that of the BC device (0.046 V vs. 0.055 V). The EQEEL of the SD device is 1.90 × 10−5, while that of the BC device is 1.37 × 10−5 (Fig. S14, ESI†) Therefore, the third part, non-radiative recombination loss (ΔE3) can be calculated to be 0.281 V for the SD device and 0.290 V for the BC device, according to the equation of ΔE3 = –kTlnEQEEL (k is Boltzmann constant, T is the room temperature). The much smaller non-radiative recombination loss of the SD-processed device may be related to the lower recombination energy from its more favorable morphology, accounting for its superior performance than that of the BC-processed device.

2.5 Absorption selectivity regulation and simulation
Although the main absorption of the NBG active layer is located in the NIR, PCE10-2F still has some absorption in the visible region. To further optimize the transmittance of the active layer, we manipulate the thickness of PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa, in view of its best performance. Fig. 6a presents the transmission spectra of active layers with different thicknesses of the donor, while retaining the same thickness of the acceptor. It can be found that reducing the thickness of PCE10-2F is very helpful to improve AVTs of the active layer. In particular, the thickness of PCE10-2F is reduced from 60 nm to 40 nm and the AVT of the active layer increases from 62.59% to 70.07%. In order to reveal how the thickness of the donor affects the device performance of OSCs, we also prepared the corresponding opaque devices using the SD method, and the performance parameters are shown in Fig. 6b and Table 1. As the thickness of PCE10-2F is reduced, device parameters show different trends. The VOC remains almost unchanged, while the JSC gradually decreases, but the FF is improved. The reduced JSC is obtained from the reduced amount of the photoactive materials, and the increased FF is due to the reduced internal resistance with a decrease in thickness. The resulting PCE and AVT of the active layer are 14.53% and 62.59% for the 60 nm PCE10-2F film, 14.10% and 66.23% for the 50 nm PCE10-2F film, and 13.51% and 70.07% for the 40 nm PCE10-2F film. The corresponding EQE spectra are shown in Fig. 6c. It is obvious that as the thickness of the donor decreases, the EQE response of the devices is greatly reduced in the region of 400–700 nm, which corresponds to weakened visible light absorption. Compared with the transmission spectra in Fig. 6a, it can be clearly observed that the decrease in EQE response corresponds to the increase in transmittance, reflecting the trade-off between light utilization and light transmission in semitransparent device applications. Moreover, the response change in the near-infrared region (700–900 nm) is small, and even if the thickness of PCE10-2F is reduced to 40 nm, it can still maintain a high EQE response of more than 70%. These results indicate that reducing the donor thickness can greatly improve the transmittance of the active films, but with less influence on the device efficiency (Fig. S15, ESI†), which is very beneficial for the preparation of highly efficient ST-OSCs.

Simulated electric field intensity |E|2 of ST-OSCs by SD processing with D/A thicknesses of (d) 60/40 nm, (e) 50/40 nm and (f) 40/40 nm. 
Meanwhile, optical simulations were performed on the preparation of ST-OSCs under the above device conditions to analyze their optical loss. According to the curves of refractive index-n and extinction coefficients-k (acquired by the spectral ellipsometry technique) of active layers with wavelength according to different donor (40–60 nm)/acceptor (40 nm) thickness ratios (Fig. S15, ESI†), the simulated electric field intensity |E|2 under the ST-OSCs devices with the thickness of 60/40 nm, 50/40 nm, and 40/40 nm is shown in Fig. 6d–f. The Ag (15 nm)/MoO3 (35 nm) electrode is chosen as a transparent back electrode for optical simulation. All the SD-processed ST-OSCs show a weak light intensity distribution in visible light. This is because the reduction of the D/A interface can effectively suppress light scattering and parasitic absorption, thereby reducing light loss in the device.37 Obviously, the light intensity distribution varies with donor thickness. As the thickness of the donor decreased from 60 nm to 40 nm, the simulated electric field intensity in the visible region of 400–550 nm gradually decreases. These observations imply that tuning the donor/acceptor thickness in the active layer using the SD method is conducive to enhance the selective absorption of the device and improve the AVT of the devices.
2.6 Photovoltaic performance of semitransparent devices
Inspired by the above results, PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa is selected as the donor, and a series of SD-processed ST-OSCs were fabricated using the normal structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (25 nm)/active layer (80–100 nm)/PDINO (20 nm)/Ag (15 nm)/MoO3 (35 nm), with different donor thickness ratios (40–60 nm), as shown in Fig. 7a. The J–V curves, transmittance spectra, transmittance spectra of the used electrode, reflectivity spectra and the corresponding EQE curves are shown in Fig. 7a–c and Fig. S16 (ESI†). The detailed device parameters are listed in Table 3. Compared with the opaque devices, the ST-OSCs show decreased PCEs but increased AVT, due to the effect of the ultra-thin Ag electrode.13 When the thickness of PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa is 60 nm, the PCE of the ST-OSCs is 11.11%, JSC is 20.37 mA cm−2, VOC is 0.785 V, FF is 69.48%, and AVT is 39.93%, giving a high LUE of 4.44%. As expected, the efficiency of ST-OSCs gradually decreases as the thickness of PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa decreases, showing the same trends in opaque devices. At a thickness of 50 nm, the PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa/Y6 device provides a PCE of 10.56% and an AVT of 45.62%, yielding a notable LUE of 4.82%. Encouragingly, when the thickness of PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa is reduced to 40 nm, the device still obtains a competitive PCE of 10.01% and a prominent AVT of 50.05%. Consequently, the best LUE of 5.01% is achieved. Fig. 7d, e and Tables S7, S8 (ESI†) display the comparison of our results with those reported in the recent literature. It clearly shows that all the PCEs of the ST-OSCs are the highest values with the AVT over 37%. More importantly, the LUE value of ST-OSCs is the champion value without complex optical engineering. These results demonstrate that a good balance of PCE and AVT has been achieved in these devices (Fig. 7f). Additionally, the PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa/Y6 (40/40) ST-OSC device shows a clear and bright background (Fig. S17, ESI†). This means that when an ST-OSC is used as a power generation window, no additional artificial lighting is required, as its high AVT for efficient transmission of natural sunlight. We further studied the influence of molecular weight on ST-OSC devices (Fig. S16 and Table S9, ESI†). We found that the variation trend of photovoltaic performance of ST-OSC devices with different molecular weights is very similar to those of opaque devices. Furthermore, quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) (QUE = EQE + T, T is the transmittance) was used to elucidate the light energy utilization of ST-OSCs. Note that the QUE values should be generally below 90% in the entire spectral region.14 From Fig. S16 (ESI†) we can see that the maximum EQE + T of these devices is 87%, confirming the reliability of these values.

Besides the PCE and AVT, human color perception should also be considered and evaluated when ST-OSCs act as power generation windows.13 Color perception can be expressed in color coordinates. The transmission spectra of ST-OSCs are used to calculate the color coordinates, and the corresponding results are plotted on the CIE 1931 (x, y) chromaticity diagram (Fig. 7g). Moreover, the correlated color temperature (CCT) is also given for evaluating the optical properties of ST-OSCs. The CIE (x, y) color coordinates of devices (60/40 nm, 50/40 nm, 40/40 nm) are located at (0.260, 0.279), (0.262, 0.285) and (0.265, 0.290), respectively, associated with the CCT of 13368, 12435, and 11615 K, respectively (Table 3). Obviously, as the thickness of the donor PCE10-2F decreases, the color coordinates are closer to the white point (0.313, 0.329) and AM 1.5 G (0.320, 0.332), indicating that the color is closer to the neutral color, due to the smoother transmission of the active layer between 400 and 580 nm. Fig. S17 (ESI†) shows a photo of the SD-processed devices (40/40 nm) put in front of the Nanchang University campus buildings and landscape. After stitching with the background photo, the application scene of power generation windows is simulated, which is shown in Fig. 7h. Compared with the background photo, the buildings and scenery can be clearly seen through ST-OSCs with small visual differences, implying the good aesthetics and transparency of the device.
3. Conclusions
In this manuscript, we demonstrate a molecular weight-regulated efficient SD method for the formation of the active layer to achieve high-efficiency ST-OSCs. Simply regulating the molecular weights of polymer donor PCE10-2F is discovered to well balance independent film formation and miscibility of the donor/acceptor interface during the SD process. In addition, the NBG small molecule acceptor Y6 is well-optimized using dual additives for higher crystallinity with larger CCL. Consequently, with independent optimization of donors and acceptors, the overall performances of the SD devices are much better than those of the BC counterparts, due to the favorable morphology, optimized charge dynamics, and reduced energy loss. PCE10-2F-53.3 kDa/Y6 obtains an impressive PCE of 14.53% for the opaque device, which is the highest PCE reported for all-NBG OSC devices. Furthermore, independent regulation of each layer by the SD process favors a convenient optimization of light transmission. As a result, the corresponding ST-OSCs achieve PCEs of 11.11–10.01% with an AVT of 39.93–50.05%, all of which are the record values of ST-OSCs. Note that without complex optical engineering, a champion LUE of 5.01% is obtained, indicating the successful balance of PCE and AVT. These findings demonstrate that the molecular weight-regulated SD method is a facile and promising strategy for highly efficient opaque and ST-OSCs.

Broader context
The compromise between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT) poses a big challenge when attempting to fabricate highly efficient semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs). Herein, we report a molecular weight-regulated efficient sequential deposition (SD) strategy, which is first employed to improve the performance of ST-OSCs. Four batches of the narrow bandgap polymer donor PCE10-2F with different molecular weights were synthesized. Simply regulating the molecular weights of the polymer is discovered to well balance independent film formation and miscibility of the donor/acceptor interface during the SD process. Combined with the acceptor Y6 film optimized by dual additives, the overall performance of SD-processed devices achieves superior performance compared to those of BC-processed devices, thanks to the favorable morphology, optimized charge dynamics and reduced energy loss. Optical simulations reveal that the SD process favors a convenient and precise control of an individual layer for the optimization of light transmission with limited degradation in device performance. The corresponding ST-OSCs achieve high PCEs of 11.11–10.01% and high AVTs of 39.93–50.05%, showing breakthrough performance in ST-OSCs. More importantly, a successful balance of PCE and AVT produces a LUE of 5.01%, which is a champion value of ST-OSCs without complex optical engineering.
