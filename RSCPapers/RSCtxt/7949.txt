    , Accepted 30th November 2022First published on 30th November 2022AbstractCsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) show great potential in various applications due to their size-dependent and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, it is still challenging to synthesize size-tunable CsPbBr3 QDs with purple emission. Herein, CsPbBr3 nanospheres (NS) with purple emission (432 nm) and wavelength-tunable photoluminescence were synthesized using a two-step recrystallization method for the first time. A nanocube (NC) strategy resulting from CsPbBr3 nanosphere self-assembly via polar solvent-induced surface ligand mismatch was proposed. The self-assembly process endows the QDs with wavelength-tunable photoluminescence ranging from 432 to 518 nm. The significant reduction in defects during self-assembly was confirmed by transient optical spectroscopy measurements, photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), and the disappearance of tail bands in the long-wavelength region of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. This theory demonstrated that the decrease in high defect surfaces and increase in specific surface area were the reasons for the decline in defects. Most importantly, these QDs could be used for the active jamming of optical imaging systems based on charged-coupled devices (CCDs), including laser imaging radar and low light level (LLL) night vision systems. QDs significantly increase the mean square error (MSE) of the image, while the detection rate of the target by the artificial intelligence algorithm decreased by 95.17%. The wide wavelength tunable emission caused by structural changes makes it arduous for silicon-based detectors to avoid the interference of QDs by adding filters or by other means.
Introduction
CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) have unique optical and electrical properties, such as high transmission efficiency,1,2 adjustable bandgap,3,4 low excitation threshold,5,6 stable stimulated radiation,7 and facile preparation at room temperature or relatively low temperatures.8 These QDs have attracted research attention due to their significant application potential in the fields of photodetectors,9–11 X-ray detection,12 light-emitting diodes, solar cells,13,14 and lasers.15 An array of improvements has been achieved in the last few years, where CsPbBr3 QDs have been tuned from blue to green,16,17 without the doping of other ions, as first reported by Kovalenko et al. Nevertheless, a significant amount of work must still be completed to prepare purple-emitting CsPbBr3 QDs, thereby achieving tunable emissions ranging from purple to green. Recently, by regulating the length and width, Liu et al. synthesized CsPbBr3 purple-emitting nanowires with a tunable width.39 However, as far as we know, purple-emitting CsPbBr3 NSs have rarely been synthesized.
It is known that the excellent optical performance of CsPbBr3 QDs originates from their high defect tolerance.19 Several theoretical and experimental studies have suggested the potential presence of non-negligible defects in CsPbBr3 QDs, which have been regarded as one of the pivotal elements affecting the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of the perovskites in terms of energy conversion or luminescence emissions. Thus, in addition to the direct synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs with high crystallinity, where extreme caution and strict operations are usually required, efforts to alleviate the surface defects of post-synthesized CsPbBr3 QDs are urgently needed.20 Several strategies,21,22 such as self-assembly,23,24 have been developed to passivate surface traps and minimize defects to enhance device performance.25,26 The self-assembly synthesis of large-sized perovskite nanocrystals with a tunable wavelength and alleviated defects has proven to be a straightforward and empirically reliable strategy.27,28
Charged-coupled devices (CCDs) have been widely used in laser imaging radar,29,30 low light level detection,31 missile guidance,32 space remote sensing,33 recognition,34 and inspection for civilian or military purposes.35 Countries worldwide have recognized the tremendous power and effect of photoelectric guidance devices based on CCDs and their significant role in photoelectric equipment for developing weapons.36 However, they can be easily overwhelmed by high-power light.37 Strong light is an important means of interfering with photoelectric guidance devices based on CCDs.38 Active jamming actively emits optical decoys to mislead photoelectric systems, while the adjustable emission wavelength and the high PLQY of the CsPbBr3 QDs endow CsPbBr3 QDs with unique advantages in the active jamming process of CCD-based optical imaging systems.
In the present work, purple-emitting CsPbBr3 NSs with PL wavelength of 432 nm and a full-width wavelength at half maximum (FWHM) of 11 nm were prepared using a two-step recrystallization method at low temperatures for the first time. The particle radius was regulated via self-assembly induced by surface ligands, with an adjustable PL wavelength from 432 to 518 nm. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results showed that the assembly process significantly reduced defects by fusing high defect surfaces and increasing the specific surface of the unit volume. Subsequently, QD interference in the CCD imaging experience and the feasibility of its active interference against optical imaging systems such as CCD-based laser imaging radar were verified. Moreover, its effective interference effect on the optical imaging devices was further determined through an active jamming experiment of the LLL night vision system.
Methods
Reagents
Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.0%), oleic acid (OA, 90%,), oleylamine (OM, 80%–90%), and tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.9%) were purchased from Macklin. Toluene (99.5%) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).
Synthesis and characterization of purple-emitting CsPbBr3 QDs
A two-step recrystallization process was carried out to obtain the purple QDs. The typical synthesis process was as follows. Precursor solutions were prepared by adding PbBr2 (0.4 mmol), CsBr (0.4 mmol), OA (1 mL), and OM (0.5 mL) to DMF (10 mL) under stirring at room temperature. Then, 50 μL of toluene was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of precursor solution and injected into 5 mL of toluene. The CsPbBr3 QDs were formed by reacting at 1–7° centigrade for half an hour. The solution started to give off bright purple light under a 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamp.
Self-assembly of the QDs for wavelength tuning
For bright blue and green light emissions, we added 100 μL, 200 μL, and 400 μL of THF to the purple quantum dot solution, which was stirred gently for 10 min.
Sample characterization
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-F200 instrument at 200 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern were performed using an FEI Talos-F200S microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured by Thermo Scientific Evolution 220 UV-vis instrument, while the PL spectra and PLQYs were assessed by an Edinburgh FLS1000 spectrophotometer under an excitation wavelength of 365 nm. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed using an X'Pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) absorption spectra were measured by a Thermo Scientific Evolution NICOLET iS50. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+, where 3 mL of CsPbBr3 QDs were placed 5 cm to the left of the low-light-level night vision instruments in a quartz dish to simulate an aerosol environment, and the experimental distance of 128.1 m was measured by an AS-1500vh handheld laser rangefinder. Histograms were obtained using a MindVision MV-SUF1200MT, and the AM-2 low-light-level night vision device was used to verify the interference effect on the photoelectric system.
Computational details
Crystal structures and each stable surface were investigated using the DFT implemented by Materials Studio software. The employed periodic cell dimension was a = b = c = 5.934 Å, and the DFT calculations were conducted by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh (PBE) exchange–correlation function. The corresponding Brillouin zone sampling k-point set-mesh parameters were 4 × 4 × 4 for the CsPbBr3 QDs (PDF no. 54-0752). The surface energy was calculated by eqn (1): (1)where n is the number of layers in the slab, Eslab is the total energy of an N-layer slab, Ebulk represents the energy of a formula unit of the bulk material, and A is the area of the surface. The projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential method was employed with an energy cutoff of 450 eV and with an adjusted k-point sampling density. The surface energy was calculated using the slab-vacuum model. Notably, the first 5 layers on the top and bottom were fully relaxed, the 2 bulk layers had fixed atomic positions, and the vacuum interval was more than 15 Å. The time-resolved PL decay curves of the NSs and NCs were fitted by the biexponential function, as shown in eqn (2), while the average life was obtained from eqn (3): (2) (3)
The MSE was calculated by eqn (4), and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was calculated by eqn (5): (4) (5)where m, n is the image pixel value, and MAX is the maximum value of the image brightness. Image recognition utilized the OpenCV computer vision library, whereas the mean shift algorithm was used for filtering, the Canny algorithm was used for edge detection, and the find contour function was used to find the contour in edge mapping.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1b presents the representative TEM and HRTEM images of the CsPbBr3 NSs. The diameter was about 2.6 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. S1a†), corresponding to NPLs of roughly 4 unit cell thickness, which was much smaller than the Bohr exciton radius of the CsPbBr3 QDs of 7 nm.39 The CsPbBr3 NSs were synthesized via a low-temperature secondary recrystallization method as the basis of the self-assembled NCs. The crystal nucleus formed with the injected toluene in the first step. In the second step, toluene was implanted rapidly again at low temperatures to control the size of the NSs. Representative TEM and HRTEM images of the NCs after self-assembly for 20 min are presented in Fig. 1d. The product was not subjected to any purification procedures, which proved that the self-assembly process was highly pure, uniform, and controllable. At this time, the size of the NCs was 6.2 ± 0.8 nm (Fig. S1b†), while the interplanar distance of the HRTEM image was measured to be 0.29 nm, which perfectly corresponded to the (200) plane of cubic CsPbBr3. As shown in Fig. S2b,† the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of the different parts of the NCs demonstrated that all parts of the assembled NCs were orthogonal, with no crystal transition in the assembly process. The corresponding SAED pattern in Fig. S2d† further demonstrated the excellent crystallinity of the QDs after self-assembly, and its atomic distribution and cell diagram are shown in Fig. S3a–c.† Additionally, as shown in Fig. S4a,† the diffraction peaks located at 15.2, 21.6, 30.6, 34.4, 37.8 and 43.9° were indexed to the (100), (110), (200), (210), (211) and (200) planes of CsPbBr3 QDs, respectively. Furthermore, the EDS results shown in Fig. S4b and c† revealed the presence of Cs, Pb, and Br in the QDs.

To reveal the formation process of the NSs, the evolution of the growth reaction at different time points was monitored by TEM (Fig. 1a). At the initial stage (0–10 min), the NSs were spontaneously aligned and fused to form NCs. The two NSs combined along the (110) crystal plane (Fig. 1c), and then more NSs were added at 5–10 min (Fig. S2a†). As the intraparticle coarsened or ripened, the NCs appeared at 20 min. At this time, the NCs were smaller than the Bohr exciton radius. At a later stage (20 min–2 h), the two NCs combined into larger NCs (Fig. 2e), with a Bohr exciton radius of more than 7 nm (Fig. S2b†). The FFT patterns of the corresponding selection (Fig. 1f and g) proved that the contact parts had an (10) crystal orientation. A schematic diagram of the corresponding fusion process is shown in Fig. 1h. The half-unit cell of the NCs with CsBr and PbBr2 terminals on the (110) surface combined into a new cell, and when self-assembly was allowed to continue at this time, it grew into large particles exceeding 100 nm (Fig. S2c†).

FTIR and XPS analyses were used to elucidate the ligand detachment and variations during the assembly process. FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of a large number of OA/OAm ligands, as evidenced by the solid C–H stretching bands18 near ∼2900 cm−1 (Fig. 2a). With increasing THF, the C–H stretching band signal gradually weakened, indicating a significant loss in the organic ligands during the self-assembly transformation.40 Compared to the dilatory progress of self-assembly, the addition of the THF space destroyed the dynamic balance of the QD surfaces, and the OA/OAM ligand was lost within 30 s and changed slightly with the progression of self-assembly (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c illustrates the XPS results, indicating that despite the presence of Cs, Pb, and Br, the existence of N and O on the CsPbBr3 QDs was attributed to the chemical adsorption of OAm/OA or DMF. The high-resolution Cs 3d chemical states are shown in Fig. 2d, and two peaks at 724.3 and 738.3 eV were detected, which corresponded to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. The spin–orbit splitting energy at 14 eV reflected the +1 valence of Cs. The spectrum of Pb 4f is displayed in Fig. 3e, which was listed as two separate peaks with binding energies of 143.2 and 138.3 eV, corresponding to Pb 4f 7/2 and Pb 4f 5/2. Furthermore, as highlighted in Fig. 3f, Br 3d had two different binding states at 68.3 and 69.3 eV, which were attributed to Br− in external PbBr2 and on the inner side of CsPbBr3.8 The surface binding energy of the NCs shifted by about 0.3 eV compared to the NSs, further proving the change in surface coordination conditions.40

Based on the above observations, we proposed the following mechanism of the NSs forming NCs. Due to the highly symmetrical nanosphere, the dipole moment was almost zero. Hence, the CsPbBr3 QDs in equilibrium were under steric repulsion supported by the ligand chains, van der Waals attractions, and charge–charge interactions. After adding the polar solvent THF, the ligands detached from the NS surfaces and became thermodynamically unstable, with a tendency to aggregate. To reduce the surface tension and total energy, under van der Waals attractions and charge–charge interactions, the NSs started to attach and form NCs through the surfaces with the highest surface energy. As shown in Fig. S5,† the detailed growth mechanisms were investigated by DFT, which we used to systematically study the surface energies of the CsPbBr3 QDs at the terminations of CsBr and PbBr2 on the (110) surfaces of 0.30 and 0.43 J m−2. These findings demonstrated that two types of (110) surface terminations potentially coexisted, providing the possibility for assembly. Table S1† shows the surface energies of the CsBr or PbBr2 terminated surfaces by DFT. The (100) facets possessed smaller surface energy than the (110) facets, which was thermodynamically advantageous. The growth of the NSs along the [110] direction led to maximal exposure of low energy (100) surfaces, which was thermodynamically favorable. The HRTEM results (Fig. 1b) revealed that the NSs synthesized at low temperatures would inevitably expose the high-energy (110) and low-energy (100) surfaces. This broke the balance of the ligands by THF, CsBr, or PbBr2 terminated on the (110) surfaces with a high surface energy, which was more favorable for rapid assembly and significantly reduced the (110) facets, where (100) was more exposed. The self-assembled NCs mainly showed a cubic shape driven by various isotropic forces. At the same time, the surface atoms with high energy dissolved or rearranged, reducing the total energy of the system in a process known as intraparticle coarsening or ripening.41 In addition, lattice matching and atomic reconstruction led to the almost perfect and smooth surfaces of the NCs.42
The optical properties of the NSs and NCs were characterized by UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. In UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), during the initial stage (0–10 min), self-assembly resulted in an apparent redshift of 11.44 nm in the absorption spectrum, and the reaction red shift rate decreased with time, due to the rapid increase in particle size brought about by self-assembly. The peak width remained unchanged because self-assembly within 0–10 min was smaller than the Bohr exciton radius. At a later stage (20 min–2 h), the absorption spectrum slowly redshifted, which was accompanied by the broadening of the peak width. This was attributed to the disappearance of the exciton absorption peak caused by the size increase. In addition to controlling the growth time, the size of the NCs could also be controlled by controlling the amount of THF and adjusting the concentration of surface ligands. These small changes were not enough to be directly analyzed by the TEM, but they could be reflected in the redshift and weakening of the first exciton absorption peak in the absorption spectrum of self-assembly within 20 min (Fig. 3b). The PL spectrum (Fig. 3c) and its illustration photos under a UV lamp demonstrated a slight increase in particle size.
As shown in Fig. 3c, the NSs synthesized by low-temperature secondary recrystallization displayed prominent purple emissions at 432 nm, the FWHM was as low as 11 nm, and the PLQY reached 65.78%. To the best of our knowledge, purple-emitting CsPbBr3 NSs were prepared for the first time in which the PLQY was higher than the 58% data value reported by known purple-emitting CsPbBr3 nanowires.39 The CsPbBr3 NSs produced a Gaussian Stokes shift of up to 0.02 eV due to the electronic structure of the small nanocrystals and strong quantum confinement effect, which increased the exciton binding energy and induced a significant Stokes shift. NSs and NCs were all stable. After NSs were dispersed in toluene and placed at room temperature for half a month, they still emitted bright purple light under UV lamp irradiation. From the PL spectrum in Fig. S6a,† the light intensity decreased to 0.63 times. However, a small number of ligands on the surface of NSs spontaneously shed and self-assembled, resulting in the formation of emission peaks at 513 nm. When the polar solvent was not removed, the NCs further self-assembled into large particles until they stopped emitting light (Fig. S2c†). When the polar solvent was removed and re-stored in toluene, NCs still emitted bright green light after one week, but the light intensity decreased to 0.46 times (Fig. S6b†). To further obtain the specific inner properties, the band structure of the CsPbBr3 QDs was calculated based on DFT, as shown in Fig. 3e. This revealed that the band structure of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 QDs was a direct bandgap. The projected density of states (PDOS) of the CsPbBr3 QDs was obtained based on the bandgap data, where the main orbitals occupied by the electrons were Cs-p, Br-s, and Br-p. Excited and recombinant processes associated with the excitons were simplified in Fig. 3f. During excitation, by absorbing a 2.89 eV high-energy photon, an electron transited to the conduction band (step 1), which rapidly decayed on the band edge and formed a free exciton (step 2). Excitons formed by direct recombination, generating a photon emission of 2.87 eV (step 3), or they were trapped by the trap states resulting from defects or doping (step 4). By contrast, the trapped exciton possibly recombined without emission (step 5). When the particle size increased after self-assembly, the absorption peak redshifted, the bandgap became smaller, and a uniformly tunable emission wavelength was generated between 432 and 518 nm (Fig. 3c).
Interestingly, the self-assembly process effectively reduced the density of defect states. This was due to the disappearance of the high defect surface and the increase in the specific surface of the unit volume in the intraparticle coating or ripening. Compared to the surface defects, the bulk defects of the CsPbBr3 QDs were negligible.43–45 However, it has been proven that the (100) surface has a lower density of defect states than the (110) surface.46–49 As mentioned earlier in the self-assembly process, the (110) surfaces combined; thus, reducing the density of defect states. More prominent giant tails on the long-wavelength side were observed in the absorption and PL spectra of the pristine NSs (Fig. 3c), which corresponded to a higher band-edge state density resulting from defects.50 The asymmetric behavior of the tail band in the long-wavelength region was effectively suppressed with the self-assembly process, proving that the defects disappeared.51 As shown in Fig. 3d and Table S2,† the time-resolved PL decay curves of the NSs and NCs were fitted by the biexponential function. The increase in the fast lifetime was credited with the radiation recombination lifetime of intrinsic excitation, and the growth in slow life was attributed to the decrease in the non-radiation recombination process related to the surface traps.52,53 The average lifetime increased from 13.61 to 23.35 ns after self-assembly, indicating that self-assembly effectively reduced the non-radiative recombination pathway, which was further verified by the increase in PLQY from 65.78% to 84.19%. The excessive loss of ligands could still cause an increase in surface traps,18,46 with photocarriers trapped in these defect states, recombining in a non-radiative manner and resulting in a decrease in PLQY.40 However, the effect of self-assembly on the repair of defect density of states was obviously higher than the ligand loss. This is because the (100) surface could produce a yield trap-free compared to the (110) surface before self-assembly, resulting in fully delocalized electronic structures without the need for passivating ligands.47–49
The gray distribution histogram before and after QD active luminescence interference with the silicon-based lidar detector is shown in Fig. 4a. The peak position and width of the target signal in the histogram changed greatly after interference, with no correlation. The QD effectively changed the optical environment, increased the image noise, and brought great interference to target recognition. The response curve of the silicon-based detector in Fig. 4b indicated that it had the highest responsivity in the PL wavelength of QDs from 432 to 518 nm. The comparative experiment in Fig. S7† excluded the influence of other factors such as UV lamps. The response curve further shows that the wavelength tunable emission up to 86 nm caused by structural changes makes it arduous for silicon-based detectors to avoid the interference of QDs by adding filters or by other means. The jamming effect diagram of the LLL night vision system (Fig. 4c and d) further proved that QDs had a practical interference effect on optical imaging devices. PSNR and MSE were used to evaluate the imaging quality affected by QDs, indicating that PSNR decreased by 38.6652 from 45.7108, and the MSE deteriorated from 1.7458 to 8.8422. The image recognition algorithm was used to identify the windows on a building, where 145 targets were identified (Fig. 4e). However, when the light emitted by the QDs added noise to the optical system, only seven targets were detected (Fig. 4f). Hence, the QDs significantly affected the imaging quality of the LLL detector, reduced the signal-to-noise ratio, and interfered with target recognition. Compared with the traditional active jamming method of laser irradiation, the fluorescence emission characteristic of CsPbBr3 QDs enables them to emit light in all directions without using other detection means to determine the position of the detector to be interfered in advance. In addition, QDs can be simply sprayed in the air to cover a large area and thus create a sufficiently large safety area. These results indicated that the CsPbBr3 QDs are promising substrates for active jamming.

Conclusions
CsPbBr3 NSs with wavelength-tunable photoluminescence and purple emission were successfully synthesized for the first time. The emission wavelength was uniformly tuned from 432 to 518 nm by self-assembly into NCs, owing to the effective reduction in the density of defect states. A joint study of simulation and experimental observations indicated that the transformation from NSs to NCs was caused by an instability in the surface ligands, which drove the self-assembly of the high defect state (110) surface. Finally, the interference experiments with silicon-based CCD and LLL night vision systems proved its excellent active jamming capability against the optical imaging system based on CCD. These results may lead to potential practical applications of perovskite QDs in the national defense and optoelectronics fields.
