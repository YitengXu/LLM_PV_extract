    , Accepted 16th July 2019First published on 19th July 2019AbstractDue to the drawbacks of long-term instability encountered in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs), building all-layer-inorganic PSCs composed completely of an inorganic perovskite absorber layer and inorganic charge-transporting layers (CTLs) has attracted increasing interest, due to removal of thermally unstable organic components. To do this, one of the greatest challenges lies in the deposition of efficient and stable inorganic CTLs on top of perovskites. Here, a general strategy, i.e., depositing monodisperse nanocrystals followed by a special thermal treatment, has been proposed to fabricate high-quality carbide–metal oxide (C–MOX) CTLs on top of the inorganic perovskite of CsPbI2Br. Effects of the energy levels, conductivities and chemical stabilities of different CTLs on the efficiency and long-term stability of their corresponding PSCs have been systematically studied. It has been found that the inverted CsPbI2Br PSC based on C–TiO2 yields the highest power conversion efficiency of up to 14.0%, mainly attributed to its best interfacial band alignment and suitable conductivity, and except those based on C–ZnO with lower chemical resistance to halide perovskites, all-layer-inorganic PSCs present excellent stabilities, and could retain >90% of their initial PCEs after aging at 85 °C in the dark and under continuous light-soaking at 45 °C for 1000 hours.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone significant development over the past few years, and their solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been certified to be over 24%.1–3 However, the long-term instability of either the organic–inorganic perovskite absorber layer or the organic charge-transporting layer (CTL) is still problematic for practical applications.4 Especially at an elevated temperature, thermal stress may induce accelerated decomposition of volatile organic components in hybrid perovskites or crystallization of organic CTLs.5,6 Thus, building all-layer-inorganic PSCs composed of inorganic perovskite absorber layers and inorganic CTLs may be a good solution to resolve the instability issues of conventional PSCs.
For the inorganic absorber layer, caesium lead halides [CsPbX3 (X = halide)] have been developed substantially during the past 2–3 years with reports of compelling intrinsic thermal stability.7–14 PCEs of inorganic CsPbX3 PSCs have been achieved up to and exceeding 16%.15 Thus, it is foreseeable that CsPbX3 perovskites are likely to grow in importance to a level comparable to that of hybrid perovskites as high-quality perovskite films are further developed.16
Although organic CTLs can provide effective charge transport, their cost is prohibitively high for large-scale applications, and their long-term operational and thermal instability is concerning.17,18 One strategy to combat the issues of cost and instability is to use inexpensive inorganic CTLs. In organic–inorganic halide PSCs, inorganic CTLs have shown improved light-soaking and thermal stability under long term aging conditions.19–23 For example, using CuSCN as the hole transporting layer material, the device retained >95% PCE of its initial value after light-soaking for 1000 hours at 60 °C.22
However, building efficient inorganic CTLs, especially depositing adequate inorganic CTLs on top of the inorganic perovskite layer, is still a significant challenge. There are several reasons as follows. First, due to their low formation energies, perovskites are susceptible to degradation when exposed to oxygen, moisture, polar solvents, heat or other high-energy irradiation. Thus, conventional thin-film deposition techniques, like magnetron sputtering, electron beam evaporation, etc., are inapplicable, whereas for the low-temperature solution method, limited solvents are used..24–26 Second, to obtain a sufficient blocking effect for interfacial charge-recombination, and to prevent direct contact and further chemical reactions between the highly corrosive perovskite layer and metal electrode layer, CTLs are required to be pin-hole free in morphology.27
This is a serious challenge. Mai et al. attempted to deposit ZnO nanoparticles on top of CsPbBrI2; however, the morphology of the ZnO layer is poor, with many pin-holes in the surface, so a large leakage loss and a bad interface contact exist, leading to a sharp “s-shaped” J–V curve and inferior photovoltaic performance.28 Third, for efficient CTLs, suitable conductivity and a band alignment well-matched with perovskites are required. In our previous work, a high-quality CsPbI2Br film of sufficient thickness was prepared; however, due to the mismatched band alignment of the CsPbI2Br/PCBM interface, a small open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of just 0.98 V and a nonideal PCE of 9.14% were obtained.29 Thus, material screening for CTLs is required because, without it, only through a fortuitous accident would one obtain a material with both the desired conductivity and band structure. This raises the need for a general strategy to prepare a series of CTLs quickly.
In this work, a general strategy to fabricate inorganic CTLs on top of perovskite has been proposed, and a series of all-layer-inorganic PSCs based on pin-hole free carbide–metal oxide (C–MOX) hybrid electron-transporting layers (ETLs) have been successfully fabricated. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay and Mott–Schottky measurements have been implemented to demonstrate how the energy levels and conductivities of ETLs determine the specific photovoltaic parameters of PSCs, and the effects of the ETLs' chemical properties on the PSCs' stability have been thoroughly analysed. Through material screening, the carbide–TiO2-based PSC achieved a champion PCE of 14.0% and the all-layer-inorganic PSCs exhibit good long-term thermal stability: ∼8% PCE loss at 85 °C in the dark and ∼5% under continuous light-soaking at 45 °C for 1000 h. The present study provides methodological guidance for preparing all-layer-inorganic PSCs and provides inspiration for researchers to improve the photovoltaic performances (both efficiency and stability) of PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the schematic of the process of fabricating efficient inorganic ETLs on top of the inorganic perovskite. In the first step, oleic acid (OA)-capped nanocrystals (NCs) monodispersed in nonpolar solvents were prepared. The as-prepared solutions could be stably stored for several months, which is convenient for future large-scale device fabrication. Nonpolar solvents were chosen to avoid damaging the perovskite. This choice usually brings about the agglomeration of NCs due to the uncontrolled evaporation of solvents, leading to a heterogeneous morphology with many pin-holes in the prepared NC films. Thus, to prevent this, OA, with long alkyl chains and large steric hindrance, has been used in the synthesis here. A series of OA-capped NCs monodispersed in chlorobenzene (CB) were prepared with appropriate concentrations. In the second step, OA-capped NCs were deposited uniformly upon the perovskite layer. Through spin-coating, OA-capped NCs are well-arranged to form a flat solution film. Benefiting from the small particle sizes and monodispersity, the NCs could be well packed by themselves and fill the voids and pits of the perovskite to avoid hole formation in the ETL or at the perovskite/ETL interface. This provides the preconditions for the final pin-hole free morphology of the ETLs and adequate electrical contact at the interface. Finally, the as-deposited ETL films were annealed in a N2 atmosphere. The N2 atmosphere is used to prevent the perovskite from being attacked by H2O and O2, while the annealing temperature should facilitate thermal decomposition of OA and prevent degradation of the perovskite.
 Fig. 1  The schematic diagram of the fabrication of efficient inorganic ETLs on top of perovskite layers. 
According to the literature, the initial decomposition temperature of OA is ∼200 °C,30,31 which is too high to prevent the degradation of organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites but is acceptable for the inorganic perovskite with comparably high thermal stability. Here, the annealing temperature was set to 250 °C, slightly higher than the temperature for the initial decomposition of the functional groups of OA, which was demonstrated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†). This temperature promises a mild rate for bond-breaking of the long-alkyl chains of OA anchored on the NCs. From the largely decreased water contact angle (Fig. S2, ESI†), the removal of long chains of OA can be demonstrated. The annealing time was optimized to 30 min (Fig. S3, ESI†). As can be seen, when the annealing time was extended to 1 h, no obvious changes in the photovoltaic properties were found, indicating that annealing at 250 °C for 30 min will not destroy the underlying perovskite. The simple annealing process provides NC films with much improved electrical behaviour and preferred energy band structures for electron transport and hole blocking. As a result, uniform, pinhole-free and effective charge-extracting inorganic carbide–NC ETLs have been fabricated on top of perovskite layers by this simple, inexpensive, easily repeatable and commercially scalable method.
Using this general method, four metal oxide (MOX)-based ETLs, namely carbide–TiO2, carbide–In2O3, carbide–SnO2, and carbide–ZnO (C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO), have been prepared. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results in Fig. 2a demonstrate the pure phases of the as-synthesized TiO2, In2O3, SnO2, and ZnO NCs, without any other impurity peaks.32–36 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 2b demonstrate the monodisperse character of the NCs. As can be seen, all the NCs are well separated and possess uniform particle sizes of a few nanometers (5–15 nm). Photographs of the as-prepared NC solutions are shown in the insets. As can be seen, each kind of NC dispersed in CB can be stable for several months, which is greatly beneficial for future commercial production. Additionally, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) results (Fig. S4a, ESI†) also demonstrate the monodisperse granulometric distribution of the NCs. The high degree of crystallization of the as-prepared NCs can be verified from the high-resolution TEM images (Fig. S4b, ESI†), in which the interplanar spacing of each kind of crystal shows good consistency with the XRD results. The demonstrated high-crystallinity and pure phases of the NCs indicate low defect densities and limited charge trapping and non-radiative recombination, which benefit efficient charge transfer and charge extraction when they are employed as ETLs.

After annealing at 250 °C for 30 min in an N2 atmosphere, homogeneous and pin-hole free carbide–MOX (C–MOX) hybrid layers were fabricated on top of perovskite layers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2c) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2d) have been used to characterize the morphologies of the obtained C–MOX hybrid layers. From the uniformity in the images and the low roughness, it can be inferred that flat, homogeneous and pinhole-free films have been achieved, with continuous and close stacks of nanoparticles. The perfect morphologies obtained here demonstrate the general applicability of our method.
Having obtained the expected morphologies, UPS (Fig. 3a) combined with UV-vis absorption (Fig. S5, ESI†) has been carried out to characterize the band structures of the C–MOXs. The calculated Fermi energy (EF) values of C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO are −3.82, −4.15, −3.93 and −3.87 eV versus vacuum, respectively, a little more positive than those of the corresponding pure MOXs.19,37–39 This may be caused by the carbon hybridization effects, which induce many shallow donor levels near the bottom of the conduction band, leading to the upward movement of EF.40 The more positive EF of C–MOX hybrid ETLs indicates that their corresponding PSCs may achieve larger built-in fields and higher VOC values. The conduction band energies (ECB) of C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO are −3.63, −3.70, −3.74 and −3.68 eV, respectively. All of these are more negative than that of CsPbI2Br (−3.56 eV from Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating band alignments well-matched with the perovskite for charge extraction. The conductivities of the C–MOX ETLs are measured and presented in Fig. 3b. As can be seen, the electrical conductivities for C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO follow the order of C–In2O3 (3.5 × 10−4 S cm−1) > C–ZnO (1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1) > C–TiO2 (4.3 × 10−5 S cm−1) > C–SnO2 (2.3 × 10−5 S cm−1). The conductivity was calculated using the equation I = σ0Ad−1V, where A is the sample area and d is the thickness and are 0.04 cm2 and 240 nm.41 It is unexpected that C–SnO2 has the lowest conductivity, as crystalline SnO2 is reported to be more conductive than crystalline TiO2.39 Here, the possible reason may be as follows. The obviously smaller grain size of C–SnO2 compared with those of the other three C–MOXs would result in many more grain boundaries, which are disadvantageous for electron transport in the film, resulting in an unsatisfactory conductivity. Thus, more accurate control of the morphology and grain size of NCs is needed in future work. Different band structures and conductivities of C–MOXs may give different photovoltaic performances of their corresponding PSCs.

All-layer-inorganic PSCs completely composed of inorganic perovskite absorber layers and inorganic CTLs have been built with the inverted structure FTO/Li, Mg doped NiOx (NiMgLiO)/CsPbI2Br/C–MOX/Ag (Fig. 4a). CsPbI2Br perovskite films were prepared based on our previous work,29 with sufficient absorbance and high crystal quality. Fig. 4b shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the CsPbI2Br film on a NiMgLiO layer. As can be seen, the CsPbI2Br film consists of large crystals with dimensions greater than 500 nm and shows homogeneous and pinhole-free morphology. Then, all-layer-inorganic PSCs have been fabricated based on different C–MOX ETLs with a thickness of ∼80 nm (Fig. 4c and S7, ESI†).To demonstrate the effect of band alignment on the characteristic parameters of photovoltaic performance, like short-circuit current (JSC) and VOC, photovoltaic parameters for devices with different ETLs have been measured and statistically analysed, as shown in Fig. 4d. The parameters were extracted from the J–V curves of 10 independent devices for each ETL. The average values of VOC follow the order of C–TiO2 (1259 mV) > C–SnO2 (1175 mV) > C–In2O3 (1021 mV) > C–ZnO (861 mV), while JSC follows the trend of C–In2O3 (14.96 mA cm−2) > C–TiO2 (14.60 mA cm−2) > C–SnO2 (13.78 mA cm−2) > C–ZnO (12.31 mA cm−2). As is known, VOC is determined by the built-in field of the PSC and the charge recombination in the absorber or at the interfaces. Thus, Mott–Schottky measurement has been conducted to study the built-in fields of PSCs with different ETLs. As shown in Fig. 4e, the built-in fields extracted from Mott–Schottky curves follow the same order as the VOC values, C–TiO2 > C–SnO2 > C–In2O3 > C–ZnO, which is almost consistent with the corresponding EF arrangement except for C–ZnO. On the other hand, there are two main issues related to electron extraction to determine the JSC values: the difference between the ECB of the ETL and that of the perovskite was reported to indicate the driving force for electron extraction28 and the conductivity of the ETL is a determining factor for electron transfer and transport. From Fig. 4a, it is observed that the electron extraction driving forces are 0.06, 0.14, 0.18, and 0.12 eV for C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO, respectively. All ETLs show positive driving forces, indicating their well-matched band alignment to avoid the injection barriers. Thus, conductivity may play a more important role in effective charge transfer and high JSC. From Fig. 3c, it can be observed that the electrical conductivities follow the order of C–In2O3 > C–ZnO > C–TiO2 > C–SnO2. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay measurement was implemented to characterize the interfacial electron extraction of each perovskite (PVK)/C–MOX interface. The fitted PL lifetimes from the curves in Fig. 4f for C–In2O3, C–TiO2, C–SnO2, and C–ZnO are 0.52, 0.71, 0.93, and 1.32 ns, respectively, following the order C–In2O3 > C–TiO2 > C–SnO2 > C–ZnO, almost consistent with the conductivity and JSC arrangements expect for C–ZnO. The lowest JSC and VOC, as well as the longest PL lifetimes, may result from the formation of numerous defects at the C–ZnO/perovskite interface, as some have reported.42 Especially for the unexpected lowest VOC, we suspect it may be due to chemical corrosion at the CsPbI2Br/C–ZnO interface, which results in a chemical potential shift of C–ZnO in the completed device in comparison to sole C–ZnO (without contact with CsPbI2Br) measured by UPS. We also conducted XRD to demonstrate the destruction of perovskite by C–ZnO as discussed below. Thus, the above results and analysis show that a more positive EF of the ETL leads to a larger built-in field of the PSC, leading to a higher VOC, and the highest JSC of C–In2O3 indicates that electrical conductivity is more decisive for electron extraction. Finally, the average PCE follows the order of C–TiO2 (13.71%) > C–SnO2 (11.34%) > C–In2O3 (10.67%) > C–ZnO (6.24%), and devices based on C–TiO2, C–SnO2, C–In2O3, and C–ZnO achieve stabilized efficiencies of 13.12%, 10.73%, 10.36% and 5.83% within 500 s, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). The typical J–V curves of devices based on different ETLs are shown in Fig. 4g, and the series resistances (Rs) of each kind of device have been fitted and are 7.97/20.0, 6.04/14.4, 11.4/26.2, and 12.4/25.2 Ω cm2 for reverse/forward-scan curves of PSCs based on C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO, respectively. Obvious hysteresis can be observed. The hysteresis index (HI) has been calculated to be 0.058, 0.057, 0.086 and 0.158 for PSCs based on C–TiO2, C–In2O3, C–SnO2 and C–ZnO, respectively, where the HI is defined by the equation .43 The smaller hysteresis of C–In2O3 and C–TiO2 devices compared with C–SnO2 and C–ZnO devices may be caused by the more effective charge transport of C–In2O3 and C–TiO2, which is also indicated by the lower Rs values of C–In2O3 and C–TiO2. Thus, further improvement of the conductivity of ETLs is needed to decrease the hysteresis, for example, by suitable doping of the metal oxides, by dimension optimization of NCs, or by developing other semiconductor NCs like sulfides with ideal conductivity. Besides, further interface engineering, such as simultaneous optimization of both the electron- and hole-transport layers and interface passivation, should be conducted in future studies to solve the problem of hysteresis. Finally, a champion PCE of 14.0% was achieved using the device containing the C–TiO2 ETL, with a JSC of 14.72 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.26 V, and fill factor (FF) of 0.76 (Fig. S9, ESI†).

The long-term thermal stabilities of the all-layer-inorganic PSCs were tested using the structure FTO/NiMgLiO/CsPbI2Br/C–MOX/Bi/Ag, in which an inert Bi interlayer was inserted to enhance the metal electrode's stability according to our previous work.44 According to the damp heat test given in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard (IEC 61215),45 we conducted thermal testing at 85 °C for 1000 h. Since humidity stress can be avoided by perfect encapsulation, we focused on aging in N2 to remove the effects of humidity in this work. The simply encapsulated all-inorganic PSCs in a N2 atmosphere present robust thermal stabilities. As shown in Fig. 5a, after 1000 h of aging at 85 °C in the dark, all the devices retained >90% of their initial efficiencies except for those based on C–ZnO. Fig. S10† presents the changes of photovoltaic parameters. As can be seen, the decay of the PCE mainly originated from the decline of the JSC. The operational stability has also been evaluated. According to the light-soaking standards in IEC 61646:2008 (Thin-film Terrestrial Photovoltaic (PV) Modules—Design, Qualification and Type Approval) and the suggestions of Grätzel et al. and Snaith et al.,46–48 the light-soaking tests were carried out under continuous illumination (white light LED array with a UV filter; the intensity was calibrated to achieve the same JSC from the PSCs as that under 1 sun AM1.5G solar irradiation) in a N2 atmosphere at 45 °C under maximum power point tracking (MPP). As shown in Fig. 5b, the all-layer-inorganic PSCs with C–TiO2, C–In2O3, and C–SnO2 ETLs retained 95.1%, 93.1%, and 92.2% of their initial average PCEs after 1000 h, respectively. The thermal and light-soaking stabilities demonstrate that the all-layer-inorganic PSCs in this work are among the most stable PSCs based on CsPbI2Br or other inorganic caesium lead halides (Table S1, ESI†). The robust thermal stability of all the PSCs originated not only from the stable inorganic perovskite and Bi/Ag electrodes, but also from the chemically stable inorganic ETLs.
 Fig. 5  (a and b) Long-term thermal and light-soaking stability of devices with different ETLs. The thermal stability was monitored at 85 °C in the dark in a glovebox containing an inert N2 atmosphere with encapsulation, and the light-soaking stability was monitored at 45 °C under continuous light-soaking (white light LED with a UV filter, with the light intensity calibrated to achieve the same JSC from the PSCs as that under 1 sun AM1.5G solar irradiation) during MPP tracking. (c) XRD of different CsPbI2Br/MOX samples before and after annealing at 250 °C for 30 min. The samples were prepared by dropping 200 μL NC solutions on top of CsPbI2Br films. 
In contrast with the C–TiO2, C–In2O3, and C–SnO2, C–ZnO led to the destruction of CsPbI2Br and the fast decay of the device performance. As shown in Fig. 5c, XRD patterns of different CsPbI2Br/MOX samples before and after annealing at 250 °C for 30 min have been obtained. After being heated at 250 °C for 30 min, there is obviously a decrease of the perovskite intensity for the CsPbI2Br/C–ZnO sample, while the reference C–TiO2, C–In2O3 and C–SnO2 exhibit negligible changes indicating their robust chemical resistance to halide perovskites. In the magnified low-intensity spectra, there are additional peaks for the annealed CsPbI2Br/C–ZnO sample at 23.3° and 33.1°, which may be attributed to the (100) and (110) planes of ZnxPb1−xO (Jade PDF#23-1497). The decreased intensity of CsPbI2Br and the newly appeared ZnxPb1−xO phase demonstrate that C–ZnO can react with CsPbI2Br, leading to the inferior photovoltaic performance and poor stability of C–ZnO-based PSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of metal oxide nanocrystals (NCs)
All the precursors used here were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. TiO2 NCs were synthesized by a solvothermal method. 5 mmol TB (titanium butoxide), 25 mmol OA (oleic acid), and 100 mmol absolute ethanol were added to a 40 mL Teflon cup. The obtained mixture was stirred for 10 min followed by transfer into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave containing a 20 mL mixture of ethanol and water (96% ethanol by volume). The system was then heated at 180 °C for 18 h. The obtained white precipitates were washed several times and then dried at RT to obtain the TiO2 NCs. In2O3 NCs were synthesized by a simple thermal decomposition method. A mixture of indium acetylacetonate (300 mg, 0.73 mmol), OA (3 mL), and 1-octadecene (17 mL) was stirred under a N2 flow in a four-necked flask with a distillation setup. This mixture was heated to 270 °C for 30 min at 10 °C min−1. Then the mixture was held at 270 °C for an additional hour. After it was cooled to RT, 30 mL ethanol was added. The product was separated by centrifugation, and the precipitates were dissolved in hexane. After washing several times and drying at RT, In2O3 NCs were obtained. SnO2 NCs were synthesized by a two-phase solvothermal synthesis approach. In a three-necked 100 mL flask, 1 mmol tin(IV) acetylacetonate dichloride was dissolved in 5 mL OA by gradually heating to 140 °C with magnetic agitation in a N2 atmosphere. Then the temperature was held at 140 °C for 1 h. After cooling in a N2 flow, 30 mL toluene was added to obtain the oil phase. The aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving NaOH in 10 mL freshly refluxed deionized water. The aqueous solution and the oil phase were placed in a 100 mL Teflon cup, which was sealed tightly in a stainless-steel autoclave and placed in a preheated furnace at 180 °C for 18 h.
Then the supernatant liquid was washed several times and then dried at RT to yield SnO2 NCs. ZnO NCs were synthesized by a simple thermal decomposition method. In a standard synthesis, zinc acetate dihydrate and OA in a 1:1 ratio were mixed in 1-octadecene. The mixture was then heated to 180 °C while stirring and degassed for 1 h to remove water from the system. After that, the solution was heated under N2 to 300 °C. When the solution turned white, the heating was stopped. Upon cooling, the solution was centrifuged, and the NPs were washed repeatedly and re-dispersed in chlorobenzene. All the as-synthesized NCs in this work were dispersed in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 40 mg mL−1.
Film preparation and device fabrication
The FTO-coated glass substrates (TEC-15, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, alcohol, and acetone under sonication. After this, they were dried in a N2 flow. A p-type NiMgLiO compact layer (∼20 nm-thick) was deposited on the FTO glass by spray pyrolysis according to our previous work.20 After cooling, the glass was immediately placed in a N2-filled glovebox. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), PbI2 (99%, TCI), and PbBr2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) stoichiometrically in a mixed solvent of DMF (Sigma-Aldrich) and DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) with a volume ratio of 2:3. The perovskite film was deposited by an anti-solvent-extraction method: typically, 70 μL of the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 45 s; after the first 3–5 s, a quick drop-casting of diethyl ether was performed, and the perovskite film was then annealed at 260 °C on a hot plate. Then 70 μL metal oxide NC solutions were spin-coated at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. After annealing at 250 °C for 30 min, the electron transport layers were obtained. Finally, 90 nm metal electrodes were thermally evaporated under high vacuum (<5 × 10−4 Pa) to complete the device fabrication. After evaporating the electrodes, encapsulation was conducted. Cover glasses and a UV curable adhesive were used to seal the devices, and the sealant areas were illuminated under UV light for 10 min to cure the adhesive. It should be noted that the whole encapsulation process has been conducted in a N2-filled glove box.
Characterization
SEM, TEM and AFM images were obtained using a Nova Nano 450 scanning electron microscope (FEI Co., The Netherlands), a Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co.), and an SPM-9700 atomic force microscope (Shimadzu Co., Japan), respectively. XRD characterization was performed on an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical B.V. Co., The Netherlands). The UPS measurements were performed on an AXIS ULTRA DLD-600W Ultra spectrometer (Kratos Co., Japan). The UV-Vis spectra were measured on a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Co., USA). The time-resolved PL spectra were measured at 650 nm on a DeltaFlex Fluorescence Lifetime System (Horiba Scientific Co., Japan) with DeltaDiodes as the excitation source. A solar simulator (Oriel, model 9119) with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to provide an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was precisely calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector. The active area of each solar cell was determined to be 0.09 cm2 by using a black metal mask. The long-term light-soaking test was carried out using a CHI1000c multi-channel electrochemistry workstation (Chenhua, Co., China) in a N2-filled glovebox.
Conclusions
In summary, a general methodology to deposit high-quality inorganic CTLs on top of inorganic perovskites was proposed, and a series of all-layer-inorganic PSCs with robust long-term stability were fabricated. The flat, uniform and pin-hole free morphologies of CTLs were achieved through uniform deposition of the monodisperse OA-capped MOX NCs. Annealing in N2 at high temperature improved the electrical conductivity and the band structure of the resultant C–MOX hybrid films and prevented damage to the perovskite layer. The specific effects of the band structure and conductivity of ETLs on each photovoltaic parameter were discussed thoroughly in this work. Our experiments demonstrate that a more positive EF leads to a larger VOC, and better conductivity results in a higher JSC. Finally, the all-inorganic CsPbI2Br PSC with the hybrid C–TiO2 ETL achieved a champion PCE of 14.0%, among the highest PCEs of inverted CsPbI2Br PSCs. Furthermore, the chemical stability of ETLs was tested. It was demonstrated that C–TiO2, C–In2O3 and C–SnO2 have enough chemical stability, while C–ZnO can react with the CsPbI2Br perovskite and form ZnxPb1−xO, leading to the unexpected poor efficiency and the fast decay of the PCE. Robust long-term stabilities of C–TiO2-, C–In2O3- and C–SnO2-based PSCs were proven. They retained >90% of their initial PCEs at 85 °C in the dark and >92% under continuous illumination at 45 °C for 1000 h, which make them of interest for practical photovoltaic applications. The present study provides a general method to prepare CTLs as top layers on perovskites simply and conveniently, which is also favourable for the future scaled-up mass production of all-layer-inorganic PSCs. The clarified relationships of the chemical, electrical, and band-structure properties of ETLs with the photovoltaic parameters and long-term stability of the corresponding PSCs give significant information for research on interfacial engineering.
