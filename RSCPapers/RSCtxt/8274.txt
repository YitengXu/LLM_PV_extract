    , Accepted 8th May 2013First published on 9th May 2013AbstractThe use of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) end-capped with anthracene (P3HT-A) in a blend with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is demonstrated to physically stabilize bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells. Bulk heterojunction-based devices are known to undergo phase separation of donor and acceptor materials during operation resulting in the formation of large (μm scale) PCBM crystals that dramatically decrease the photovoltaic characteristics of the cell. By way of a facile UV-curing step, the P3HT-A chain most likely reacts with PCBM fullerene via a [2+2] cyclo-addition to stabilize the blend. Photovoltaic devices based on P3HT-A and PCBM have been optimised in terms of thermal annealing to obtain initial devices to determine the UV-curing protocols. UV-exposure was found to improve device stability while simultaneously having a minimal effect on device efficiency. Optical microscopy demonstrates that the few reactions of P3HT-A with PCBM are efficient enough to prevent the formation of micro-sized PCBM crystals responsible for the failure of solar cells.
Introduction
In organic photovoltaic devices, the main limitations are conversion efficiency and performance stability. Many strategies are currently being pursued to develop new materials for the active layer. For around a decade, the most studied system has been blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).1 One problem that has been raised is the influence of the morphology on device performances and notably their stability.2 Several strategies have been developed to control the morphology during thin-film deposition, but it remains essentially unstable,3 and over time the two components tend to phase separate leading to the formation of large PCBM crystals.4,5 A recent review reports the problem of the morphology in this system and various strategies to overcome the dramatic effect of the separation of phases.6 A first study showed an improved hole mobility and photovoltaic properties with the use of a crosslinked polythiophene with vinylene–terthiophene–vinylene as a conjugated bridge.7In situ crosslinking of the polymer in the bulk heterojunction thin film is a convenient way to freeze the morphology during the phase segregation process at a certain optimized stage. Miyanishi et al.8 demonstrated an improvement of the stability of the morphology with the use of a thermally crosslinkable polythiophene, poly[3-(5-hexenyl)thiophene] (P3HNT). Despite the very weak cross-linking yield (4%), polythiophene became insoluble and the formation of PCBM crystals was clearly diminished, as shown by optical microscopy. The performances of the device were comparable to those of the non-crosslinked device. Similar results were obtained by using a photocrosslinkable bromine-functionalized P3HT in the blend with PCBM.9 The stability of the conversion efficiency of the devices at 150 °C is significantly increased, thanks to UV exposure. Once again, the formation of large PCBM crystals is reduced in photocrosslinked layers according to optical microscopy. Photocrosslinking of π-conjugated materials on intrinsically un-crosslinkable materials using a nitrene-based additive blended with the host polymer has also recently been investigated.10 The authors developed a way to crosslink virtually any material since the crosslinking reaction involved the polymer alkyl side chains without affecting the semiconducting backbone.
Here, we present a convenient route to increase the stability of the morphology of the blend by using polythiophene end-capped with anthracene moieties. The results suggest that the anthracene reacts with fullerene, retaining its diffusion in the bulk heterojunction. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to show that anthracene was successfully grafted onto P3HT chain-ends. The optical microscopy showed a clear decrease of the formation of PCBM crystals by using P3HT-A when UV treatment was performed before thermal annealing. Annealing temperatures were optimized on solar cells and duration of UV treatment was varied to check its effect on photovoltaic performances. Finally, AFM images of thin-films of P3HT-A with and without PCBM showed an interesting structuration as deposited films.
Experimental procedure
2,5-Dibromo-3-hexylthiophene was prepared according to the procedures already described.11 All other materials were purchased from Aldrich or ABCR. THF was used freshly from distillation over benzophenone and sodium under nitrogen. All reactions were performed in flame-dried reactors flushed with dry nitrogen.
Synthesis of P3HT-A
In a three necked round bottom flask, THF (31 mL), 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (0.931 g, 2.85 mmol) and 2 M isopropylmagnesium chloride in THF (1.6 mL) were mixed with vigorous stirring for 2 h at 29 °C. Ni(dppp)Cl2 was added in one portion (26 mg, one part to 60 parts monomer). The mixture was stirred for 23 h at room temperature. Finally, freshly prepared methylanthracene magnesium chloride was added (2.44 mmol) in THF (2 mL). The polymerization was quenched with 1 M HCl (5 mL). The polymer was precipitated in ethanol, washed in a Soxhlet apparatus with ethanol, and recovered with chloroform. Yield 64%, GPC: Mn = 5600 g mol−1. Đ = Mm/Mn = 1.14. 1H NMR (ppm): 7.0 (s, 20H), 2.8 (broad, 40H), 2.6 (t chain end, 2H), 1.7 (m, 42H), 1.4 (m, 84H), 0.9 (s, 63H); minor peaks due to chain-ends: 7.8–7.9 (anthracene, broad, ca. 0.4H), 7.5 (anthracene, broad, covered by rotational peaks), 7.1 (s, 1H chain end), 6.8 (1H chain end, s), 5.5 (anthracene, broad methylene).
Instrumentation
UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-21021PC spectrometer using solutions in THF. Polymer molar masses were estimated against polystyrene standards by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a blank of 4 columns (HR 0.5, 2, 4 and 6®) of 300 mm × 5 μm Styragel at 40 °C, THF eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 controlled by a Waters® 2690 pump, an ERC® INC 7515A refractive index (RI) detector and a Waters® 996 multiple wavelength UV-visible photodiode array detector. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in 1 cm quartz cuvettes, in L geometry, on an Edinburg Instruments FS900 spectrometer. Measurements were performed with an Innova AFM (Veeco Instrument Inc.). The images were scanned in tapping mode under ambient conditions and recorded as topography and phase images; only phase images are presented in the present paper. Rectangular silicon cantilevers from Veeco-probes (MMP-12100-10) with a resonance frequency of about 150 kHz were used.
Photovoltaic devices
Commercially available PCBM (99.5%, Solaris) was used without further purification. Solar cells were prepared according to the following procedure. The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass anodes (10 Ω □−1, Kintech) were purchased partially etched. They were cleaned in successive ultrasonic baths using, sequentially, de-ionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. UV-ozone treatment was applied to the substrates in order to increase the hydrophilic nature of the surface and to remove any residual contamination. A conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-compl-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Aldrich Conductive Grade) as a water-based solution, was spin-coated on top of the ITO sheets, followed by a thermal treatment under vacuum (10 mbar) at 100 °C for 30 min to remove residual moisture. Further fabrication steps and characterizations were carried out under inert atmosphere (N2) inside a multiple glovebox system. P3HT-A was dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) at 1 to 4 wt% to tune layer thicknesses. Solutions of P3HT-A and PCBM were prepared with a weight ratio of 1:1 and stirred on a hot plate at 45 °C for 24 h. These composites were spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT: PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 1 min. The achieved layer thickness was controlled using an Alpha-step IQ profilometer and was kept at 75 ± 5 nm. Finally, the aluminum cathode (100 nm) was thermally evaporated under a secondary vacuum (10−6 mbar) through a shadow mask determining the active surface (8.4 mm2). Thermal annealing was performed in the glovebox by means of a hot plate for 20 min at various temperatures. UV treatments were performed before electrode evaporation in a BLX-E Fisher chamber equipped with five 8 W tubes at a 365 nm wavelength in the glovebox. UV doses were simultaneously measured with a VLX-3W radiometer with wavelength selective sensors. One hour of exposure corresponds to a dose of 10 J cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells were measured with a computer controlled sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) under illumination using an AM1.5 solar simulator Atlas (solarcelltest 575) set at 100 mW cm−2, with an IL1400BL calibrated radiometer, in the glovebox.
Results and discussion
The polymer used here in this study was P3HT modified on one chain end by an anthracene unit (P3HT-A) (Scheme 1). The polymer was prepared according to the GRIM method.12,13 The anthracene moiety was introduced in situ on the end of the polymerization to end-cap the polymer chains. GPC analyses afforded molar masses Mn = 5600 g mol−1, Đ = 1.14 and 1H NMR analysis indicated there to be on average one anthracene moiety per seven chains.

Anthracene and its derivatives are known to undergo [4+4] dimerization upon longwave UV irradiation (>350 nm) and were the subject of numerous studies (see references therein).14 The dimer can be restored to the original molecules upon exposure to shortwave UV light or upon heating. Coursan and Desvergne described the use of anthracene on polymers to reversibly photodimerise ω-anthryl-polystyrene.15 The dimerisation occurred at 336 nm and when irradiated at lower wavelength (228 nm) the original ω-anthryl-polystyrene chains were quantitatively recovered. These reactions were studied in solution (degassed THF), however, the challenge here was to obtain them in the solid state. The reaction already described in the solid state is the cycloaddition of anthracene on fullerene derivatives.16Scheme 2 shows the structure of P3HT-A and both scenarios of dimerisation and fullerene addition.

The first concern was to confirm the end-capping of the polymer chains with anthracene, to which end UV-visible spectrometry was used. Fig. 1 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of anthracene and P3HT-A in THF solution. With this result, it was not possible to confirm the presence of anthracene on chain-ends of the polymer, probably due to the low proportion of anthracene compared to P3HT. Thus, fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on dilute solutions as the maximum absorbance obtained by UV-visible absorption is below 0.1 (Fig. 2).

 Fig. 2  Fluorescence emission spectra of P3HT-A in solution (THF) at various concentrations (λexc = 373 nm to excite the anthracene moiety and λexc = 440 nm to excite the P3HT sequence). 
Fluorescence spectra were recorded at two excitation wavelengths, at the maximum absorption of anthracene (at 373 nm) and at the maximum absorption band of polythiophene (440 nm). At concentrations of 0.078 mg mL−1 and 0.041 mg mL−1, no emission was observed by exciting in the absorption band of anthracene. The emission of anthracene was recovered, with weak emission of polythiophene, in solutions at lower concentrations (0.008 mg mL−1) (by exciting at 373 nm in the absorption band of the anthracene). These observations suggest intermolecular energy transfer from anthracene to polythiophene, cut off by dilution at lower concentrations. The residue of free anthracene was most likely excluded from P3HT-A by careful precipitation and Soxhlet purification, a technique known to remove traces of impurities and oligomers.17
A series of experiments were undertaken in order to promote a possible photodimerisation between two anthracenes in the solid state by UV irradiation. Thin films of P3HT-A were prepared by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solutions and then thermally treated for 5 min at 120 °C in order to force the crystallization of the P3HT chains. The improvement of UV-visible absorption showed changes of the structuration at the solid state (figure not shown). The thin films were finally UV irradiated for 24 h under nitrogen atmosphere. No change was observed, concerning intensity or absorption range after this UV irradiation. Solubility testing revealed that the films were completely soluble indicating that no crosslink reactions occurred. All the samples were analyzed again by GPC, to check that no dimerizations, which would double the molar masses, had occurred.
Then, the blends of P3HT-A with PCBM (1:1 by weight) were studied as thin films by UV-visible absorption, after several different treatments (see Fig. 3). Various durations of UV treatment—15, 30 (not shown) and 60 min—were considered to estimate its effect on the structuration of the blend after a thermal treatment. The shortest durations did not seem to hinder the structuration of the blend as the spectra exhibited a strong vibronic structure after only 5 min of thermal treatment at 120 °C (Fig. 3a). However, for long UV treatment, such as 60 min, a long thermal treatment was required to obtain an optimised UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  UV-visible absorption spectra of P3HT-A:PCBM as thin films after various treatments: (a) after 15 min of UV treatment; and (b) after 60 min of UV treatment. 
Thin films of P3HT-A:PCBM blends were spin-coated from chlorobenzene solutions to be compared upon thermal annealing (2 h at 150 °C) without and with UV pretreatment. Fig. 4 shows the effect of UV treatment. In the case that no UV treatment was applied to the thin film, large PCBM crystals appeared. With the UV treatment before thermal annealing, the formation of PCBM crystals is almost entirely prevented. Since no crosslinking was observed in the case of the pure UV-treated P3HT-A layers with no PCBM, this result suggests that the anthracene moiety most likely reacts on the fullerene sphere. This reaction allows P3HT-A to “grab” PCBM and limits its thermal diffusion and thereby diminishes macro-crystal formation.
 Fig. 4  Optical microscopy images of P3HT-A:PCBM layers after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 2 h (a) without UV treatment and (b) with UV treatment (365 nm) prior to annealing. 
To go further in the study of the UV treatment, two different treatment sequences were performed. One with UV treatment before thermal annealing and another one with UV treatment after thermal annealing.
More precisely, the first series consisted of a UV treatment (365 nm) of 10 h (Fig. 5b) before a thermal treatment of 20 min at 160 °C (Fig. 5c) and another one of 3 h at 120 °C (Fig. 5d). In the second series of treatments, the first thermal treatment (Fig. 5e) was realized before the UV curing (Fig. 5f). A final thermal annealing of 3 h at 120 °C was performed to follow the evolution of the morphology (Fig. 5g). The first thermal treatment at a quite high temperature was chosen to force the phase segregation and promote the germination of PCBM crystals. From all these images, a strong difference of behaviour was observed. Indeed, in the first series, the UV curing performed before any thermal treatments seemed to prevent the formation of PCBM crystals. In contrast, in the second set of treatments, the first thermal annealing was dramatic for the stability of the morphology as small crystals of PCBM were formed. The following UV exposure did not inhibit the growth of the crystals and there is a clear difference between images in Fig. 5d and g. This observation confirms that UV exposure promotes reactions that slow down the formation of PCBM crystals, and as we showed that no reaction of crosslinking occurs between polymer chains, we can assume that these reactions take place between a polymer chain ended with anthracene and PCBM.

We examined the morphology of thin films prepared from P3HT-A to check whether the anthracene plays a role in the nano-scale structuration. The AFM phase images obtained on thin films without and with PCBM are presented in Fig. 6. The morphology of P3HT-A in thin films as deposited from chlorobenzene solution presented a highly fibrillar structure (Fig. 6a). In the case of the blend with PCBM, the fibrillar morphology is lost as presented in Fig. 6b, PCBM tends to separate the nanofibrils of P3HT-A. The magnified image presented in Fig. 6c confirms this hypothesis with the observation of smaller fibrils of P3HT-A probably dispersed in an amorphous matrix of P3HT-A and PCBM.

Optimisation of thermal annealing was performed in order to get the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) (Fig. 7). The optimal temperature was 160 °C to yield the best PCE of 1.2%, probably due to the low molar mass of this polymer (5600 g mol−1). Low molar masses were preferred to best control the concentration of chain ends. It should be noted that the aim was to demonstrate the working principle of the process rather than obtain high efficiencies; it is most likely that this system can be extended to much higher molar mass materials, or given its effectiveness with only one-seventh of chain-ends carrying anthracene, used as additives to higher molar mass systems.
 Fig. 7  Optimisation of P3HT-A:PCBM-based PV cells in terms of annealing temperature. 
Various durations of UV treatment were performed to determine if it would affect solar cell performances (Fig. 8 and 9). Fig. 8 presents the evolution of PCE with UV time of exposure. It appeared that for short times of exposure to UV treatments, a slight decrease was observed. After longer times (above 2 h), the PCE increased again to a value higher than that of the initial series. The two sets (without and with thermal annealing) exhibited the same trend.

 Fig. 9  Effect of UV exposure on J/V curves. 
The J/V curves presented in Fig. 9 clearly showed the decrease of the short circuit current density and the open circuit voltage after the short UV exposure of 15 min. Then for longer times, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) goes back to its initial value while JSC continues to increase. At this stage it is difficult to explain this behaviour, but it was important to notice that UV exposure did not affect the performances of the solar cells.
Conclusions
In this study we have shown that P3HT end-capped with anthracene could improve the stability of the morphology of the active layer. A UV treatment (365 nm) before thermal annealing was efficient to limit the formation of PCBM crystals in the P3HT-A:PCBM blend (1:1 by weight), as observed by optical microscopy of thermally aged films. In contrast, non-UV-treated active layers show large fullerene crystallization after thermal ageing. The device performances obtained after different UV treatments were not reduced by the UV treatment.
