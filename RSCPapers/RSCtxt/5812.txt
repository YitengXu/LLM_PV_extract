    , Accepted 11th July 2014First published on 14th July 2014AbstractTwo indacenodithiophene-based molecules with different side chains, BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12, have been designed and synthesized for solution-processed, small-molecule organic solar cells (OSCs) donor materials. By optimizing the side chains, the hole mobility of the materials is modulated, which has been proven by the organic field-effect transistor (OFET) performances. Solar cells based on BTIDT-C6 show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.83%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about indacenodithiophene-based, solution-processed, small-molecule OFETs, and it is also one of the highest PCE reports for the indacenodithiophene-based, solution-processed, small-molecule OSCs. This report makes indacenodithiophene-based small molecules the third type of high-efficiency (5% PCE), solution-processed, small-molecule OSCs donor materials, in addition to benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienosilole (DTS).
1. Introduction
During the past two decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in low-cost, flexible, large-area photovoltaic devices.1–6 Through prolonged effort, single-junction PSCs have exceeded 9% PCE.7 However, polymer donor materials always suffer from batch-to-batch variations, difficulty of purification, and broad molecular weight distributions. In contrast, solution-processed, small-molecule, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells could overcome these issues very well.8–13 Recently, dramatic progress has been made, and PCE of 6–8% have been achieved by small-molecule BHJ OSCs.14–20 Despite the recent appreciable advances, the overall small-molecule device performances are relatively low compared with their polymer counterparts. In addition, the high PCE small-molecule donor materials were limited to benzodithiophene14 and dithienosilole21,22 with deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, which could provide a high open circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cell devices. New high performance donor materials for solution-processed, small-molecule BHJ solar cells are urgently needed.
The copolymers based on indacenodithiophene have been employed in PSCs due to highly planar structures and high carrier mobility.23–28 PSCs based on tetraphenyl-substituted indacenodithiophene have exhibited PCE of more than 7%.29 The indacenodithiophene-based, small-molecule donor materials could also be promising due to the highly planar structures and hole mobility of the indacenodithiophene segment. At the end of 2013, Hou et al. reported the first indacenodithiophene-based, small-molecule donor materials, and the PCE of these molecule-based solar cells reached around 4%.30 At the beginning of 2014, Zhan et al. reported a similar small molecule, which could be used as both donor and acceptor and exhibited the highest PCE, around 3%.31 In addition, Cao and Su et al. also reported indacenodithiophene-based small molecules with tunable side chains.32 This pioneering work on indacenodithiophene-based small molecules made this type of material a promising candidate for high performance solar cell donors, besides benzodithiophene14 and dithienosilole.21,22
Besides the aforementioned small-molecule backbone design, which determine the main photoelectronic properties of donor materials, side-chain engineering also plays a critical role in improving molecular solubility and film-forming properties, which is a prerequisite for their applications in solution-processed solar cells.33,34 Side-chain engineering of polymer-donor materials can significantly improve PSC performance when the polymer-conjugated backbone is completely same.35–38 It is also necessary for small-molecule donor materials. Moreover, it is easy to modulate the small-molecule crystallinity by choosing different side chains. Crystallinity could have great influence on the device performances for solution-processed, small-molecule solar cells. In particular, it will influence the acceptor/donor interpenetrating network, which leads to the changes of roughness in AFM morphology and crystal-domain size.39,40 With proper side chains, the small molecule-based solar cells will produce higher device performances with high Jsc and FF, which originates from the good donor/acceptor interpenetration network in the active layer.
In this work, we synthesized two indacenodithiophene-based small molecules, BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 (Fig. 1). By optimizing the side chains, the hole mobility of the materials is modulated, which has been proven by the OFET performances. The side chains also help the small molecule donor materials to form extremely smooth donor/acceptor bulk heterojunction thin films, which produce near 5% PCE solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about indacenodithiophene-based, solution-processed, small-molecule OFET, and it is also one of the highest PCE reports for indacenodithiophene-based, solution-processed, small-molecule donor materials.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and thermal properties
BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 were synthesized by the routes shown in Scheme 1. Sn-IDT-C6 was prepared according to the literature.25 Sn-IDT-OC12 was synthesized by an improved experimental procedure. The TMS groups on 1,4-bis-(5-trimethylsilylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-benzene-dicarbonate were introduced to facilitate the later intramolecular cyclization reactions. As a result, the yields of product 2 could be increased. By the Stille condensation of the 4-bromo-7-(5-(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-thiophen-2-yl)-thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole with Sn-IDT-C6 and Sn-IDT-OC12, respectively, the targeted molecules BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 were synthesized. The chemical structures of two molecules were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS. The melting points of the two molecules were measured by the micro-melting point apparatus. BTIDT-C6 has a higher melting point at 110.2 °C, as BTIDT-OC12 has much lower melting point at 69.4 °C, which suggests BTIDT-C6 exhibits better stability than BTIDT-OC12. The DSC analysis of BTIDT-C6 reveals that the melting temperature is 96.7 °C. However, the DSC curve of BTIDT-OC12 does not show any useful information. It may be that the low melting point of BTIDT-OC12 or amorphous nature leads to the DSC measurement difficulty.

2.2. Optical properties
The UV-vis spectra of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 in chloroform solution and in thin film are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 are found to be similar both in solution and film. These two molecules show two peaks at ∼400 nm and ∼600 nm in both solution and film. Compared with the absorption peak at 587 nm of BTIDT-C6 in solution, the absorption peak of BTIDT-C6 thin film has a red shift of ∼16 nm, whereas BTIDT-OC12 does not show a clear red shift. This indicates an effective π–π packing in the BTIDT-C6 thin film. The optical band gaps of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 are estimated to be 1.82 eV and 1.78 eV, respectively, according to Eoptg = 1240/λ.

2.3. Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3). A three electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode has been used. The potentials were internally calibrated using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is found to be 0.43 V vs. SCE. According to the empirical equation,EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) (eV)ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.4) (eV)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12. 
The HOMO energy levels of these molecules are highly similar (∼−5.35 eV). The electrochemical band gaps of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 are 1.66 eV and 1.61 eV, respectively. The low HOMO energy levels indicate that these two molecules maintain good stability in the air and could afford a high open circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cell devices.
2.4. Field-effect transistor (FET) characteristics

Fig. 4 shows the transfer and output curves of the OFET devices based on BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12. The device performances of BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 are summarized in Table 2. The OFET device of BTIDT-C6 showed a higher hole mobility of 5.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of BTIDT-OC12 with hole mobility of 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. BTIDT-OC12 with longer side chains increases numbers of alkyl, which decreases the contents of active conjugated compositions. And the amorphous nature of BTIDT-OC12 molecule is another reason for low OFET mobility. The AFM height images (2 μm × 2 μm) of the BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12 on SiO2/silicon substrates are shown in Fig. 5, and the root-mean-square (RMS) are 0.310 nm and 0.278 nm for BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12, respectively. The results show that the side chain helps the molecule form very uniform film for OFET devices.

2.5. Photovoltaic properties
We fabricated the OSC devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC61BM/Ca/Al using the method of solution processing as in our previous studies.41–43 The blends of small molecules and PC61BM at various weight ratios of 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4 have been used to optimize their device performances. We found BTIDT-C6- or BTIDT-OC12-based device performances do not significantly change with varying the DA ratio within the range of 1:2 to 1:4, which will be beneficial to future industrial manufacture. We further optimized the device performances using a PC71BM acceptor with device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM (1:3)/Ca/Al. The thicknesses of BTIDT-C6/PC61BM, BTIDT-C6/PC71BM, BTIDT-OC12/PC61BM and BTIDT-OC12/PC71BM films were 100 nm, 103 nm, 96 nm and 98 nm, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curve of the OSC devices based on the blend of BTIDT-C6 or BTIDT-OC12/PC61BM or PC71BM under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Table 3 summarized the detailed device performances. Finally, the best solar cell obtained from BTIDT-C6:PC71BM (1:3) showed a PCE of 4.83% with an Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 11.01 mA cm−2, and an FF of 48.17%, and BTIDT-OC12 showed a PCE of 4.06% with an Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 10.00 mA cm−2, and an FF of 43.30% at the same conditions. We can find that the characteristically high Voc of the OSCs devices is obtained by BTIDT-C6 (0.91 V) and BTIDT-OC12 (0.94 V) because of their deep HOMO energy levels.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on BTIDT-C6/PC61BM or PC71BM and BTIDT-OC12/PC61BM or PC71BM (1:3) are shown in Fig. 7. Both the devices exhibited a photoresponse range from 300 to 800 nm, with a maximum EQE of 67.9% for BTIDT-C6/PC71BM and 60.0% for BTIDT-C12/PC71BM. To confirm the accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements, the Jsc (10.89 mA cm−2 for BTIDT-C6/PC71BM and 9.95 mA cm−2 for BTIDT-C12/PC71BM) were calculated from the integration of the EQE curves, which agree well with the Jsc (11.01 mA cm−2 for BTIDT-C6 and 10.00 mA cm−2 for BTIDT-C12) obtained from the J–V measurements. In addition, the EQE curves of the PC71BM-based devices show higher EQE response in the region (500–700 nm), which contribute to the higher Jsc of the PC71BM-based devices.44 Mobility measurements via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method disclose the hole mobility of 8.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BTIDT-C6:PC61BM device, 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BTIDT-C6:PC71BM device, 5.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BTIDT-OC12:PC61BM device and 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BTIDT-OC12:PC71BM device (Fig. 8). The PC71BM-based device shows higher hole mobility than that of the PC61BM device. This could be another potential reason that the PC71BM device exhibits larger Jsc than the PC61BM device. The SCLC results show that the hole mobility of BTIDT-C6 is higher than that of BTIDT-OC12, which agree well with that of the OFET measurements. As a result, the high hole mobility could improve the Jsc and FF in OSC devices, which make hole transport easier in the OSCs active layer.45,46

The surfaces of the molecule/PC71BM blend films are both smooth and uniform.

3. Conclusions
Two indacenodithiophene-based A–D–A-type small molecules, BTIDT-C6 and BTIDT-OC12, have been designed and synthesized. The side chains do not show obvious influence on the optical and electrochemical properties of these two molecules. However, the photovoltaic performance and OFET properties show a close relationship with different side chains. BTIDT-C6 with shorter side chains improves the hole mobility up to five times more than BTIDT-OC12 and has a higher PCE of 4.83%, which makes indacenodithiophene-based small molecules the third type of high-efficiency (5% PCE), solution-processed, OSC small-molecule donor materials, besides benzodithiophene (BDT) and dithienosilole (DTS).
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
All starting reagents were commercially obtained as analytical reagents and directly used without any purification. Toluene and THF were purified by vacuum distillation under nitrogen prior to use. 5-(Tri-n-butylstannyl)-5′-(2-ethylhexyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, 5-trimethylsilyl-2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)-thiophene, 4-dodeoxy-1-bromobenene and (4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)-bis(trimethylstannane) (Sn-IDT-C6) were synthesized as reported in the literature.25,47–49
4.2. Instruments and measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were taken on a Bruker AVANCE-III 600 Spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra (MS) were recorded under APCI mode on a Bruker Maxis UHR-TOF spectrometer. Melting points were measured with a SGWX-4A micro melting point apparatus. UV-Vis absorption spectrum was measured with a Hitachi U-4100 pectrophotometer. The organic molecule films on quartz used for absorption spectral measurement were prepared by spin-coating their chloroform solutions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. Surface roughness and morphologies of thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an Agilent 5400 or VEECO Multimode V working at the tapping mode.
4.3. Fabrication of field-effect transistor (FET) devices
Bottom-gate/bottom-contact transistors were fabricated on Au-patterned SiO2/Si substrate (W/L = 3173:10). The thickness of SiO2 is 100 nm, and the high doped silicon was used as the bottom-gate electrode. After standard cleaning (15 min ultrasonic process in acetone, isopropanol and DI-water, sequentially), 5 mg mL−1 small molecules dissolved in chlorobenzene were spin-coated on the substrates at a speed of 1000 RPM for 1 min and the active layer around 20 nm was formed on the substrate after coating. The substrates were then annealed on a hot plate at 50 °C (BTIDT-C12 sample) or 100 °C (BTIDT-C6 sample) for 30 min before the device test. I–V curves were measured by a Keithley 6212 source meter, an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer and an HP 4284A LCR meter in the MBRAUN nitrogen glove box under darkness.
4.4. Fabrication and characterization of organic solar cells
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic baths of acetone, toluene, methanol and isopropyl alcohol sequentially. An oxygen plasma treatment was then made for 20 min, spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm and dried under argon for 20 min at 120 °C. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-coated from different blend weight ratios of donor (15 mg mL−1) and PCBM in deoxygenated anhydrous chloroform solution on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. The active layer thickness was measured by a Dektak 150 profilometer and was ∼100 nm. Finally, Ca (10 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa on top of the active layer. The photovoltaic performance was measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation using a Xe arc lamp in an argon atmosphere (<0.1 ppm H2O and O2), and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using Keithley 2400. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained by a source meter, silicon photodiode and a computer-controlled light source-monochromator-lock-in system.
4.5. Synthesis

Diethyl-1,4-bis(5-trimethylsilylthiophen-2-yl)-2,5-benzene-dicarbonate (1). 
Diethyl-2,5-dibromoterephthalate (3.04 g, 8 mmol), 5-(trimethylsilyl)-2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)-thiophene (8.91 g, 20 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (462 mg, 0.4 mmol) were mixed in toluene (60 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was heated to reflux for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, it was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography over silica gel, eluting with petroleum ether and ethyl acetate (v/v, 10/1) to give (1) as a white solid (1.29 g, 31%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.81 (s, 2H), 7.18 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 7.14 (d, J = 3.4 Hz, 2H), 4,21 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 4H) 1.13 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 6H), 0.34 (s, 18H).


4,9-Dihydro-4,4,9,9-(p-dodeoxyphenyl)-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b]dithiophene (3). 
To a solution of 4-dodeoxy-1-bromobenene (6.14 g, 18 mmol) in THF (10 mL) at −78 °C was added n-BuLi (11.25 mL, 18 mmol, 1.6 M in hexane), the mixture was kept at −78 °C for 1 h, and a solution of compound (1) (1.06 g, 2 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was then added slowly. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight and then poured into water and extracted with chloroform. The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was washed with hexanes to give (2) as a white, solid crude product. The white product was then directly dissolved in acetic acid (25 mL) and 1 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h. After pouring into water, the mixture was extracted with chloroform. The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was washed with water, an aqueous sodium carbonate solution and methanol to give (3) as a yellow solid (1.28 g, 51%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.38 (s, 2H), 7.23 (d, J = 4.9 Hz, 2H), 7.14 (dd, J = 6.9 Hz, 8H), 6.96 (d, J = 4.9 Hz, 2H), 6.76 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 8H), 3.89 (t, J = 6.5 Hz, 8H), 1.73 (m, 8H), 1.41(m, 8H), 1.35–1.20 (m, 64H), 0.87 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 12H).
