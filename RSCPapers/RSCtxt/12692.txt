    , Accepted 26th January 2018First published on 26th January 2018AbstractIn this paper, we focus on the controlled growth mechanism of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures via the hydrothermal method. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results reveal that at a lower hydrothermal time, the initial nucleation involves the formation of short and thin β-FeOOH nanorods. The subsequent increase in the hydrothermal time leads β-FeOOH to form thicker and longer nanorods. However, high-temperature quenching (HTQ) at 800 °C for 10 min causes the conversion of akaganeite to the hematite phase and activation of hematite by Sn4+ diffusion from a FTO substrate. Sn4+ diffusion from the FTO substrate to the hematite nanostructure was elaborated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An α-Fe2O3 nanorod photoanode prepared by a hydrothermal reaction for 3 h and HTQ exhibits the highest photocurrent density of 1.04 mA cm−2. The excellent photoelectrochemical performance could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the optimum growth of α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays and Sn4+ diffusion. Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) studies revealed that the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared at 3 h and HTQ exhibited a long electron lifetime (132.69 ms), and contribute to the enhanced PEC performance. The results confirmed that the controlled growth of the β-FeOOH nanorods, as well as Sn4+ diffusion, played a key role in charge transfer during the photoelectrochemical application. The charge transfer mechanisms in α-Fe2O3 nanostructure photoanodes prepared at different hydrothermal times and high-temperature quenching are also investigated.
1. Introduction
With the continuous increase in global energy demand, worldwide research has focused on the conversion and storage of sustainable green energy.1,2 Solar energy-driven systems are among the promising systems to solve world's future energy needs.3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting offers a promising route for the production of green and renewable fuel (hydrogen) from water using solar energy at a semiconductor–electrolyte interface.4,5 Since the pioneering work on PEC water splitting was demonstrated by Honda and Fujishima using TiO2,6 several metal oxides, such as WO3,7 ZnO,8 BiVO4,9 GaN, InGaN,10 and Fe2O3,11 have been studied as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. However, most of these have a wide band gap and must be modified to shift that energy band gap, by doping with a substitutional element, to extend the photoresponse to visible light.12 Due to its favourable band gap (α-Fe2O3: 2.0–2.2 eV), extraordinary chemical stability, appropriate solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, and abundance in the Earth's crust, hematite (α-Fe2O3) is considered to be one of the alternative photoanode materials for PEC water splitting.13,14 However, hematite suffers from a short hole diffusion length, extremely poor conductivity, and poor oxygen evolution kinetics, which are some of the major drawbacks when it comes to its practical use.15 Many efforts have been made to overcome these problems, such as the synthesis of 1-D nanostructures,16,17 which sufficiently improves the charge transport, and doping, which improves its conductivity.18,19 Hematite nanostructures have been fabricated by a variety of techniques, such as spray pyrolysis,20 electrodeposition,21 sol–gel processing,22 and hydrothermal synthesis.23 Among them, hydrothermal synthesis is cost-effective, simple, and provides good control over the growth and morphology.24,25 Hydrothermal synthesis has been widely used to make hematite nanostructures, but many factors that affect the performance of the final product are still unclear.26 Recently, researchers have found that the nanorod growth mechanism is highly dependent on the HCl concentration of the hydrothermal solution.27 Based on the previous studies,28–30 it is expected that the hydrothermal/solvothermal process can encourage the growth of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructures. Li et al. reported the controllable size and morphology of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructures by fine-tuning the hydrothermal temperature.31 Jang et al. grew hematite (α-Fe2O3) by electrochemical deposition and achieved the maximum photocurrent density of 0.15 mA at 1.23 V vs. the RHE under the growth conditions of 70 °C and 10 min.32 Wickman et al. reported that the thermal treatments during the synthesis of hematite are found to affect the performance of hematite electrodes. Fe2O3 films oxidized at 750 °C delivered a photocurrent density of 0.6 mA at 1.1 V vs. the RHE from water oxidation.33 Jia et al. obtained ultra-thin α-Fe2O3 (hematite) films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using radio frequency (RF) sputtering. They reveal that the trapping of charges on the surface is the reason for the limited PEC performance.34 Wang et al. showed an ∼0.1 mA cm−2 photocurrent density for 1D α-Fe2O3 photoanodes synthesized through a simple solution-based method.35 Sinha et al. also reported the photocurrent density for the DC magnetron sputtered hematite (α-Fe2O3) to be 0.075 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. the RHE and concluded that the photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting of hematite photoanodes suffers from low performance and efficiency.36 To overcome the limitations of α-Fe2O3 such as the short hole diffusion length (L = 2–4 nm) and the poor charge transport properties associated with the α-Fe2O3 phase37,38 and to enhance the efficiency of the hematite photoanodes, metal ion incorporation or doping hematite with different metals, such a Ti,39 Mn,24 Sn,18 and Mg40 doped α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have recently been successfully studied, and have shown improved electrical and optical properties.31 In general, most of the reports related to elemental doping in hematite photoanodes can be classified as either in situ doping or ex situ doping.41 Despite these advances, such as α-Fe2O3 nanostructures and doping elements, there is still much speculation concerning the fundamental mechanisms of the hydrothermal reaction and the growth of products.42 Thus, there still remains the challenge of developing simple and versatile approaches to synthesize 1-D nanostructures of α-Fe2O3, which will facilitate the understanding of the shape, size, and photoelectrochemical dependent properties of α-Fe2O3. It is, therefore, necessary to further investigate the factors affecting the hydrothermal growth of α-Fe2O3 nanorods by conveniently controlling the desired morphology through a hydrothermal method. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on the simultaneous study of the effect of the hydrothermal growth mechanism and Sn4+ diffusion during the high-temperature quenching of α-Fe2O3 nanorods to enhance the photoelectrochemical performance.
In this work, a simple and cost-effective method was utilized to show new possibilities of improving the photoelectrochemical response of the 1-D hematite nanorods. Initially, to understand the growth mechanism of the β-FeOOH nanorods, we varied the hydrothermal reaction time. As the hydrothermal reaction time increases from 1 to 9 h, the β-FeOOH nanorods grow perpendicularly on the FTO substrate. Above 9 h, the nanorods are aggregated and form a nano-sized, coral-like structure on the pre-deposited nanorods. After high-temperature quenching, the as-grown β-FeOOH nanorods convert into the hematite phase, in addition, Sn4+ diffusion from FTO further activates the hematite photoanodes. The α-Fe2O3 nanorod films prepared by a hydrothermal reaction for 3 h and high-temperature quenching showed the best PEC performance, due to the formation optimal aspect ratio of 1-D nanorods with essential Sn4+ diffusion from FTO substrates. The remarkable enhancement in photocurrent density arises from the higher donor density and lower charge transfer resistance at the hematite/electrolyte interface, the optimum diffusion length of photogenerated charge carriers which is confirmed by the Mott–Schottky and impedance measurements. The possible growth mechanism and the effect of Sn4+ diffusion on the PEC performance of the hematite nanostructure are also explained.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of a hematite nanostructure
The FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) coated glass was ultrasonically cleaned, using acetone, ethanol, and distilled water. Cleaned FTO glass substrates were placed inside a Teflon cylinder at an angle against the wall of the cylinder with the conducting side facing down. To deposit the Fe2O3 nanorods, 75 mM FeCl3·6H2O and 0.5 M Na(NO3)2 were added to the aqueous solution and the pH was adjusted to 1.5 using concentrated HCl. The resulting solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon cylinder lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was placed inside an oven at 100 °C for 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 h. β-FeOOH films hydrothermally synthesized on FTO substrates were cleaned with distilled water several times to remove contamination and dried using N2 gas. The films were then quenched at 800 °C for 10 min to convert β-FeOOH to α-Fe2O3, as well as to induce Sn4+ diffusion from FTO to the hematite nanostructure (Scheme 1). The β-FeOOH nanorod films prepared by a hydrothermal reaction for 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 h are denoted as FH1, FH3, FH6, FH9, FH12, and FH18, respectively. The α-Fe2O3 nanorod films prepared by the hydrothermal reaction for different times and HTQ are denoted as FH1Q, FH3Q, FH6Q, FH9Q, FH12Q, and FH18Q, respectively.

2.2 Characterization
The crystal structure of the photoanodes was examined using high-resolution XRD at the 5A beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PLS-II) in Korea. A monochromatic X-ray of 17.9 keV (λ = 0.0693 nm) was selected by using a double crystal monochromator, and the standard θ–2θ scan was performed. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of the hematite photoanodes were collected by using a Shimadzu UV-Vis-spectrophotometer (UV-2600). The morphology of the hematite photoanodes on the FTO substrate was analyzed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEM-2010, JEOL) at the Center for University-Wide Research Facilities (CURF) at Chonbuk National University. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL JEM-3100F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The sample for TEM was prepared by placing a drop of the sample suspension in ethanol on a standard carbon-coated copper grid. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy was applied to investigate the local structure of Fe in Fe2O3 photoanodes. The spectra for the Fe K-edges were recorded in fluorescence mode at the 7D beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. The incident beam was monitored with a He-filled IC Spec ion chamber, and the fluorescence signal from the sample was measured by using a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector under a helium atmosphere. The obtained spectra were analyzed by using Athena and Artemis in the IFEFFIT suite of programs. FEFF 9 codes were also used to generate the theoretical standard for the calculation of structural parameters through a nonlinear EXAFS fit.43 Photoelectrochemical characterization was performed by means of an Ivium CompactStat potentiostat in a 1 M NaOH electrolyte solution (pH 13.6). A three-electrode cell configuration was used in this experiment, with the prepared photoanode acting as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The applied potential was reported against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by using the following equation:44 (1)
The collected potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation, where ERHE is the converted potential vs. the RHE,  is 0.1976 V at 25 °C, and EAg/AgCl is the applied potential against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 1.(2)
The charge carrier densities (Nd) were calculated from the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot by using the following equation:45 (1/C)2 = (2/e0εε0Nd)(E − EFB − kT/e0)(3)where C is the capacitance (F cm−2), e0 is the electron charge, ε is the hematite dielectric constant ∼80, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the carrier density, E is the applied electrode potential, EFB is the flat band potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the surface morphology of hematite nanorods (NRs) obtained at different hydrothermal synthesis times followed by HTQ. Fig. 1(a)–(f) show that as the hydrothermal reaction time increases from 1 to 18 h, the diameter of the hematite nanorods varies from 69 to 222 nm. This is typically responsible for the highest photocurrent density for different hydrothermal reaction times in the current study. Initially, as the reaction time varies from 6 to 9 h (Fig. 1(c and d)), the diameter of the hematite nanostructure seems to flatten from 110 to 176 nm. However, the diameter of the FH9Q sample tends to increase because the β-FeOOH nanorods melt and regrow during the HTQ process, which is attributed to the formation of agglomerated nanorods.46 FESEM cross-sectional images (Fig. 2) indicate that the as-prepared nanorods are roughly perpendicular to the FTO substrate. However, a close inspection of the nanorods shows that with the increasing hydrothermal reaction time, the length of the hematite nanorods varies from 174 to 573 nm, respectively. A comparative analysis of FH6Q and FH9Q samples shows that upon changing the reaction time from 6 to 9 h, the average length of the hematite nanostructure decreases from 466 to 452 nm. Thus, by adjusting the hydrothermal reaction growth times the improvement in the length and diameter of the nanorods can be observed. After an increase in the reaction time above 9 h, Fig. 1(d–f) show several alterations in the morphologies of FH9Q, FH12Q, and FH18Q photoanodes. Thus, along with the aggregation of nanorods, the average diameter and length of the nanorods increase; the average diameter increases from 176 to 222 nm and the length of the hematite nanorods increases from 452 to 573 nm, respectively. In addition, it is interesting to see that as the hydrothermal time increases from 9 to 18 h, the nanorods scatter randomly on the substrate (Fig. 1(d–f)). This phenomenon may be ascribed to the hydrothermal reaction reaching a dissolution–deposition balance beyond 9 h.47 Also, it is clearly indicated that the superstructures evolve from the nanorods, which look like nanocorals at higher hydrothermal times (9, 12, and 18 h). However, to check the effect of annealing temperature on the morphology of the nanorods FESEM top view and cross view analyses of the as-prepared akaganeite (β-FeOOH) nanorods are shown in Fig. S1 and S2.† By comparing the samples before and after annealing it is seen that after high-temperature quenching, the morphology of the hematite NRs changed considerably. Table S1† lists the calculated average values of the diameter and length of hematite nanorods and β-FeOOH nanorods prepared at various hydrothermal times. It indicates that the average length of hematite nanorods reduces, while the diameter considerably increases, which are consistent with the observations reported previously.48,49Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the α-Fe2O3 nanorod films prepared at different hydrothermal reaction times and HTQ. As shown in Fig. 3, all the diffraction peaks are indexed to the hematite (α-Fe2O3, denoted as ‘H’, JCPDS 33-0664) on an FTO substrate (denoted as ‘F’, JCPDS 41-1445). It is apparent that photoanodes grow with the preferential (104) and (110) planes at all reaction times. To clarify the intensity variation with respect to the hydrothermal reaction time after HTQ, the magnified views of the H(104) and H(110) peaks are shown in Fig. 3B. It is seen that as the hydrothermal time increases from 1 to 9 h, the intensity of H(104) increases indicating the highly crystalline nature of the samples, whereas the peak intensity of FH9Q reduces. Other XRD patterns show no marked difference. In order to estimate the crystallite size of the hematite phase, the Scherrer method was employed for the (110) plane. The crystallite size is nearly the same, except for FH1Q, as summarized in Table S2.† However, as the hydrothermal time increases from 1 to 9 h, the length of the hematite nanorods increases, so the (104) and (110) diffraction peak intensities of hematite gradually increase. Fig. S3† illustrates the XRD patterns of the β-FeOOH nanorod films prepared at different hydrothermal reaction times. Except for the FTO substrate peaks, all peaks match with the β-FeOOH (akaganeite) peaks (denoted as A′, JCPDS 75-1594).50 The XRD pattern of FH18 shows high intensity compared to the other samples. This is because prolonging the hydrothermal time induces the growth of nano-corals on the nanorods which led to an increase in the average diameter and length as shown in Fig. S1 and S2.† To study the influence of the hydrothermal time on the optical properties of the hierarchical nanostructures of α-Fe2O3, UV-Vis absorbance measurements were conducted. The UV-Vis absorbance and band gap of the hematite quenched after the hydrothermal synthesis are shown in Fig. S4(A and B).† In the case of FH1Q the low absorbance has been observed whereas in the case of other conditions for samples (FH3Q, FH6Q, FH9Q, FH12Q, and FH18Q) the absorption band slightly red shifts. This phenomenon is caused by the thickness of a photoanode, which is formed by the smaller diameter and shorter length of nanorods in FH1Q. Thus, the shift in the absorbance edge towards a longer wavelength upon prolonging the hydrothermal time indicates broadening of the optical band gap. The band gap of the prepared hematite photoanodes is ca. 2.0–2.1 eV, which is calculated from the Tauc plot (Fig. S4B†). It correlates well with a previous report.13 The chemical compositions of the hematite prepared by hydrothermal synthesis for different times and the HTQ process were analyzed by XPS. Fig. S5† shows the survey scan and XPS spectra of Fe 2p and O 1s cores. The survey scan spectrum (Fig. S5A†) indicates the presence of the expected elements Fe, O and Sn on the surface of all HTQ processed samples. The presence of an Sn ion in the survey scan may arise from the diffusion of Sn4+ directly from the FTO conductive substrate at HTQ. The high-resolution XPS narrow scan of the Fe 2p core level of the Fe2O3 thin film appears as a doublet consisting of two broad peaks at the binding energies of 710 and 724.2 eV, which correspond to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 lines, respectively (Fig. S5B†). The satellite peak of the Fe 2p core observed around 719 eV indicates that Fe3+ is the dominant species in the as-prepared samples.51,52 The O 1s peak for all photoanodes is observed around 529.5 eV, which is attributed to the O2− forming oxide with iron (Fig. S5C†).53 Table S3† shows the elemental composition of the prepared hematite photoanodes. Fig. 4A shows that the narrow scan spectra of the Sn 3d peaks for α-Fe2O3 photoanodes possess two intense peaks around 486 (Sn 3d5/2) and 494.5 eV (Sn 3d3/2). These results confirm that Sn4+ diffused into the lattice of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods during the HTQ process of the hydrothermally synthesized β-FeOOH samples.54,55 However, the intensity of the Sn 3d peak decreases in the samples prepared at an increasing hydrothermal synthesis time and HTQ, meaning that the relative Sn concentration on the surface of the films decreases rapidly. When the hydrothermal reaction time increases, the length and diameter of the hematite nanostructure also increase, leading to an increase in the thickness of the hydrothermally deposited α-Fe2O3 photoanodes. Thus, due to the increased thickness of nanorods, the diffused Sn4+ ion from the FTO is not detected at the surface of the photoanodes. So the intensity of the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 peaks reduces in the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared by prolonging the hydrothermal time. Thus, the amount of Sn4+ diffusion is higher for the FH1Q photoanodes whereas the Sn4+ diffusion is lower in the sample prepared at the longer hydrothermal time (Fig. 4B).

Surprisingly, Table S3† shows that FH6Q, FH9Q, and FH12Q show similar Sn4+ diffusion from the FTO substrate. Generally, the diffused Sn4+ in the hematite photoanodes from the FTO substrate can serve as electron donors, which enhances the donor density, and improves the conducting properties of hematite quenched after hydrothermal synthesis.55,56
In addition, in order to obtain deeper insight into the microstructure of the Fe2O3 photoanodes deposited in the FH3Q and FH18Q, the detailed TEM observations were further carried out. Fig. 5A shows the TEM image of an FH3Q nanorod (sample prepared by scratching the powder from the film) with a width varying from 78 to 104 nm. On the other hand, in FH18Q, the average diameter increases with the aggregation of nanorods as shown in Fig. 5B and Fig. S6.† This is due to increasing the hydrothermal synthesis time and HTQ. It is found that the size and shape were similar to those of FESEM observations. To clearly identify the spatial distributions of Fe, O, and Sn in the hematite photoanodes deposited in FH3Q and FH18Q, TEM EDS and elemental mapping were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. S7.† The Fe and O signals are uniformly distributed while the Sn signal was observed up to the top of the nanorods in FH3Q, however, for FH18Q, the Sn amount is higher at the bottom of the nanorods and decreases toward the tip. These results correlated with the XPS analyses.

Fig. 6 shows the geometrical structure around a central Fe atom viewed as the Fourier-transform spectra of the Fe K-edge EXAFS functions. The first peak at 0.8–2.0 Å associated with two kinds of Fe–O bonds appears at the lowest distance for FH1Q, but FH6Q and FH9Q have the peaks shifted to a higher distance. Table S4† shows this behavior more clearly. FH1Q exhibits a discriminatively short Fe–O bond distance, and a small Debye–Waller factor. FH6Q and FH9Q have large Fe–O bond distances comparable to those (1.946 and 2.116 Å) of the reference hematite powder.57 When Sn4+ with a larger radius in FTO is diffused into the α-Fe2O3 lattice after HTQ, it can definitely affect the ordering as well as the distance of the Fe–O bonds by being located at the Fe site. The shortened Fe–O bond distances for FH1Q are due to high Sn4+ diffusion and are so uniformly diffused that the bond order does not get worse, but maintains a superior bond ordering on a 2-D substrate. In the cases of FH6Q and FH9Q with mild Sn4+ diffusion, the Fe–O bond distances recover to the level of a non-confined structure. Considering that the Debye–Waller factor increases in the sequence of FH1Q < FH3Q ≈ FH6Q ≈ FH9Q < FH12Q ≈ FH18Q, it is suggested that the hydrothermal reaction time highly affects the local structural ordering.

The PEC performance of the as-synthesized photoanodes was evaluated for solar water splitting. In order to optimize the hydrothermal reaction time, the current density–voltage characteristics of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared by hydrothermal synthesis for different times and the HTQ process were evaluated, and are shown in Fig. 7A. Under dark conditions, the J–V curves of all the hematite photoanodes are similar and do not show a significant response below 1.65 V vs. the RHE. The plot clearly reveals that the generation of photocurrent increases linearly with the applied potential bias over the entire potential range. FH1Q shows the photocurrent density of 0.94 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE under 1 sun illumination. However, FH3Q shows the highest photocurrent density of 1.04 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. This may be because the light absorbance dominates the current and thus thicker films absorb more light, therefore, producing higher photocurrent density.58 However, except for FH1Q, even though the remaining samples reach the maximum light absorption, they show the lower value of photocurrent density. This may be because the higher hydrothermal time (more than 3 h) forms a thicker film, which not only increases the surface area of the electrode but also increases the recombination site.59 In addition to light absorption in nanorods, Sn4+ diffusion in hematite photoanodes at HTQ is another factor that enhances the donor density, and aids in speeding up the charge transport. The photocurrent of FH6Q is lower than that of FH3Q, and the reduction in the photocurrent of FH6Q is attributed to the formation of longer and thicker nanorods that possess less Sn4+ diffusion from FTO towards the top of the nanorods. The XPS results show that when the nanorods are longer, the Sn4+ diffusion up to the top surface of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods is difficult. The photocurrent of FH12Q and FH18Q decreases from 0.84 to 0.78 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the RHE, because of the longer nanorods with an aggregated structure and the recombination at the surface. Thus, the significant enhancement of the photocurrent of FH3Q and the shorter hole transport distance as compared to the other photoanodes are believed to be the more rapid interfacial charge transfer rate prepared samples (FH1Q, FH6Q, FH9Q, FH12Q, and FH18Q).

To describe the photo-response efficiency of photoelectrode materials, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) is calculated using the following formula:60 η (%) = J × (1.23 − V)/P × 100(4)where J is the photocurrent density under visible light irradiation (mA cm−2), V is the applied voltage vs. Ag/AgCl and P is the power density of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 7B shows the plots of the calculated ABPE as a function of the applied bias for the hematite quenched after hydrothermal synthesis at different times. The calculated ABPE values of FH1Q, FH3Q, FH6Q, FH9Q, FH12Q, and FH18Q are 0.57%, 0.63%, 0.51%, 0.56%, 0.50% and 0.47% at 1.67 V vs. the RHE, respectively. FH3Q, which showed the highest PEC performance in the J–V curve (Fig. 7A), showed the highest efficiency of 0.63%. Furthermore, to evaluate the charge transport kinetics and interfacial properties of the α-Fe2O3 nanorods prepared at different hydrothermal times and the HTQ process, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out at 1.23 V vs. the RHE under 1 sun illumination conditions, as shown in Fig. 7C. Nyquist plots obtained from EIS are fitted with an equivalent circuit using Z View (inset shows an equivalent circuit), and Table 1 gives the electrochemical fitting parameters. The RS is the series resistance, which mainly includes the sheet resistance of the FTO substrate, external electrical circuit, RCT1 and CPE1 depict the charge-transfer resistance and the double-layer capacitance at the FTO/α-Fe2O3 interface, and RCT2 and CPE2 depict the charge-transfer resistance and the double-layer capacitance of the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface, respectively. All samples exhibit similar RS values of 20–30 Ω, which indicates the good conductivity of the FTO substrates.61 It is clearly evident from Table 1 that the RCT1 value of FH1Q is lower, compared to the other photoanodes (from FH3Q to FH18Q). This is due to the smallest length, the diameter of the nanorods and the higher Sn4+ diffusion in FH1Q, at 800 °C for 10 min, which leads to effective charge collection at the FTO substrate.62 However, with an increase in the hydrothermal time the RCT1 values increase, indicating the less diffusion of Sn4+ in nanorods after increasing the length and diameter. These results are well matched with the XPS results of Sn4+ diffusion. The higher RCT2 (179.1 Ω) value for FH1Q indicates a low charge-transfer at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface. This is because the lower aspect ratio (smallest length and diameter) generates a lower number of charge carriers. Upon a further increase in the hydrothermal time (i.e. FH1Q to FH3Q), the RCT2 values decrease from 179.1 to 142.0 Ω. This indicates that due to the small and optimum size of hematite nanorods, the Sn4+ diffusion of FH1Q and FH3Q is easier and helps in the enhancement of the photocurrent performance. On the other hand, the RCT2 values of FH6Q, FH9Q, and FH12Q do not show a noticeable difference as shown in Table 1. This is attributed to the effect of the aggregated nanorods on the pre-formed nanorods (parent nanorods) that led to an increase in the thickness and saturation of recombination sites which may form on the surface of nanorods. Thus, the HTQ process of FH1Q leads to higher Sn4+ diffusion (Fig. 4A, XPS analysis) than the optimum value of Sn4+ in FH3Q, and thus provides lower photocurrent density. However, a lower charge-transfer resistance (RCT2) for FH3Q enhances the efficient charge transfer between the α-Fe2O3 nanorod and the electrolyte. The overall PEC performance is due to the enhanced charge transfer at the α-Fe2O3 nanorod/FTO and α-Fe2O3 nanorod/electrolyte by the reduced values of RCT1 (due to Sn4+ diffusion) and RCT2 (effect of aspect ratio variation). Generally, when the resistance of the photoanode increases, the photocurrent decreases, because charge separation, electron transport, and hole transfer are the main factors in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC).48 As a result, FH3Q appears to offer the best PEC performance among the as-prepared photoanodes.

To further understand the role of the growth of hematite nanorods and Sn4+ diffusion with respect to the hydrothermal time and HTQ process, Mott–Schottky (MS) measurement was performed. Fig. 7D shows the Mott–Schottky plot of α-Fe2O3 nanorod samples prepared by both hydrothermal synthesis and the HTQ process. The Mott–Schottky slope and intercept provide the donor density and flat band potential of the as-prepared photoanodes.63 The donor densities of FH1Q, FH3Q, FH6Q, FH9Q, FH12Q, and FH18Q are 1.10 × 1020, 1.86 × 1020, 1.26 × 1020, 1.81 × 1020, 1.57 × 1020, 1.57 × 1020, and 1.22 × 1020 cm−3, respectively. The higher donor density value for FH3Q is due to the enrichment of electrons from Sn4+ diffusion in the nanorods. Generally, the higher value of donor density helps in photoanodes. The flat band potential (VFB) from the MS plot is 0.51 V vs. the RHE for FH1Q and 0.57 V vs. the RHE for the other as-synthesized samples. The positive shift in the VFB of the FH3Q photoanode indicates the decreased band bending, and helps to facilitate efficient charge transfer. Thus these results correlate strongly with the J–V curve of the α-Fe2O3 nanorod films prepared at different hydrothermal reaction times and high-temperature quenching.
Furthermore, to explain the charge recombination dynamics within the hematite quenched samples after hydrothermal synthesis, the intensity modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS) analyses were carried out under open-circuit conditions as shown in Fig. 8. In IMVS, as the external circuit is open, the changes in the surface hole concentration are probed by the photovoltage which further responds to surface recombination. Thus, IMVS analysis can be used to evaluate the electron lifetime or the rate of electron recombination. The electron lifetime (τn) is directly obtained from the IMVS result by the using following formula:64 τn = 1/2πfmin(IMVS)(5)where fmin(IMVS) is the frequency at the imaginary minimum. The calculated values of the electron lifetime (τn) are 83.8, 132.69, and 72.38 ms corresponding to FH1Q, FH3Q, and FH18Q, respectively (inset of Fig. 8). Notably, as compared to FH1Q, FH3Q, and FH18Q, the electron lifetime of FH3Q is higher, which means less recombination and efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers in the film.65

The longer electron lifetime obtained in the IMVS results reflects the lower trap states existing in FH3Q, and leads to reduced charge recombination. Thus, the IMVS results of FH1Q, FH3Q, and FH18Q are quite consistent with the enhancement of PEC performance and the lower RCT2 values from the EIS fitting results. The stability of the photoanode is one of the significant issues in the PEC water splitting application. Hence, to evaluate the stability of the FH1Q, FH3Q and FH18Q photoelectrodes, we measured the current density versus time under continuous simulated AM 1.5G illumination at an applied potential of 1.23 V vs. the RHE. Initially, to show the stability and the current value without light illumination, the current curves in the first five minutes were obtained in the dark. The photocurrent in the I–t curves remained constant and closely matched that of the linear sweep voltammetry curves shown in Fig. 7A, indicating that the prepared photoanodes are very stable over the illumination time. Fig. 9 shows the photoelectrochemical performance of the samples (FH1Q, FH3Q, and FH18Q) obtained before and after an extended testing for 1 h which reveals 99% stability after the PEC water splitting for 1 h.

The inset shows a short-circuit photocurrent response (chopped curve) of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes synthesized for (a) FH1Q, (b) FH3Q, and (c) FH18Q at 1.23 V vs. the RHE. 
The charge transport mechanism and Sn4+ diffusion in α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared at different hydrothermal times and HTQ are shown in Fig. 10. In hydrothermal synthesis nanorods grown from the nucleation sites and during their further growth the thickness and length of the nanorods vary with the reaction time. Furthermore, after the HTQ, Sn4+ ions diffuse from the FTO substrates. The FH1Q shows a small diameter and length, and thus demonstrates low light absorption and more Sn4+ diffusion, compared with the other samples (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4†). Due to the lower thickness and sufficient Sn4+ diffusion, the photogenerated electrons follow the high mobility. However, the sample (FH1Q) shows a lower PEC performance due to insufficient light absorption for the hematite photoanode. After an increase in the hydrothermal time to 3 h (FH3Q), the thickness of the photoanode is optimum for sufficient light absorption and optimum Sn4+ diffusion, and thus the FH3Q sample shows the best PEC performance. However, a further increase in the hydrothermal time of 3 h, the growth (length and diameter) of the nanorods increase and the electron recombination becomes more. Thus, in the case of a higher hydrothermal time, even though there is sufficient light absorption, the photogenerated electrons are recombined, which leads to the lower PEC performance. At the prolonged hydrothermal time, in particular, the photogenerated charge carriers of FH18Q are recombined due to the increased thickness and surface states. Also, this phenomenon results in the low conductivity of the hematite photoanode, because of the increased thickness, formation of grain boundaries and prevention of effective Sn4+ diffusion for the hematite nanorod films. However, the result indicates that our strategy of enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance of hematite using optimum hydrothermal time and Sn4+ diffusion by HTQ provides a promising approach for high-efficiency PEC water splitting. In the follow-up studies, such an approach could be greatly improved and utilized for more promising semiconducting materials with novel nanostructures.

4. Conclusions
We have grown time-dependent β-FeOOH nanorods on a FTO substrate using a hydrothermal method. High-temperature quenching (HTQ) converts β-FeOOH nanorods to α-Fe2O3 nanorods and leads to diffusion of Sn4+ from the FTO substrate. By varying the hydrothermal reaction time, it was found that the PEC performance of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode is crucially affected by both the morphology and the Sn4+ diffusion. The best balance between the morphology and Sn4+ diffusion exhibits a higher photocurrent density of 1.04 mA cm−2 in FH3Q. When the hydrothermal time increases, the photocurrent could also be influenced by the thickness, the presence of grain boundaries between the parent nanorods, and the particles grown on their top surface. Impedance measurement and the MS plot of the α-Fe2O3 nanorod photoanodes prepared under optimum conditions appear to demonstrate lower charge transfer resistance and higher charge carrier density. The optimum Sn4+ diffusion in the nanorod photoanodes results in a higher electron lifetime and reduces photogenerated carrier recombination. Thus, our work has opened a promising avenue for developing high-efficiency hematite based PEC photoanodes on the FTO substrate for PEC water splitting.
