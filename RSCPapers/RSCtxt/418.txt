    , Accepted 24th September 2022First published on 26th September 2022AbstractMolecular engineering of high-performance non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is critical to enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs). In this work, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT are employed to investigate the effects of π-bridge engineering on the photoelectric performance of high-performance NFA Y6. This π-bridge engineering principally involves (1) inserting different types of π-bridge units between the fused-ring core and the terminal unit of Y6, and then the π-bridge unit with better performance is screened for the next study, (2) inserting different numbers of screened π-bridge units between the fused-ring core and the terminal unit of Y6, and (3) modifying the side chains of the screened π-bridge unit with halogen atoms. Theoretical results predict that the selenophene π-bridge has superior properties in terms of dipole moment, exciton binding energy, and light absorption compared with other π-bridge units. In addition, studies on different numbers of selenophene π-bridges suggest that increasing the number of selenophene π-bridges has significant advantages in enhancing light absorption and electron transport capabilities for enhancing the short circuit current density (JSC). Meanwhile, the study of π-bridged side chains substituted with different halogen atoms indicates that the substitution of halogen atoms can play a significant role in reducing the exciton binding energy and raising the transferred charge amounts. The results obtained in this work are expected to be used to design new Y6 derivatives.
1 Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) have been widely employed in photovoltaic building integration, wearable devices, transparent cells, and greenhouse roofs due to their unique advantages such as light weight, environmental friendliness, low cost, and roll-to-roll mass fabrication.1–5 The most important component of OSCs is the active layer material consisting of electronic donor materials and acceptor materials.6,7 Electronic acceptor materials in OSCs are mainly divided into fullerene acceptors (FAs) and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). However, there are several limitations of FAs, such as the high cost, weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions, and poor device stability.8–10 Compared with FAs, NFAs have low cost, good energy level adjustment, and superior stability.8,9,11 Accordingly, the excellent performances of NFAs have received a lot of attention from researchers, which has led to the rapid development of NFA OSCs.12–15
Nowadays, organic photovoltaic devices (donor: D18, acceptor: Y6) based on NFAs have reached high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 18%,15 which are attributed to the emergence of the novel A–DA′D–A (D: donor, A/A′: two different acceptors) type of NFA Y6.16 The terminal group A of Y6 consists of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-1-ylidene) malononitrile (2FIC), and the central group DA′D of Y6 consists of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-core-based fused-unit dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole (TPBT). Compared with the previous A–D–A type of NFA, the central group DA′D introduced in Y6 can provoke a stronger intramolecular electron push–pull effect (IEPP). This can further regulate molecular energy levels and strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effects as well as the light-harvesting in the visible and NIR regions.17,18 Thus, the first Y6-based OSC (D: PM6, A: Y6) gained a high PCE of 15.7%.16
Since the appearance of Y6, researchers have carried out a lot of modification research on the backbone and side chain of Y6, and they found that modifying the backbone of Y6 is one of the effective strategies to further improve the PCE of Y6-based OSCs. Generally speaking, the modification of the backbone of Y6 mainly includes the modification of the fused-ring core and the addition of π-bridge fragments. In terms of backbone modification of Y6, researchers have made great progress in modifying the fused-ring core of Y6. For instance, Li and co-workers19 replaced the benzothiadiazole unit of Y6 with a benzotriazole unit and synthesized a new Y-series NFA, Y18, and the PCE of the OSC (D: PM6, A: Y18) reached 16.52%. Zhou et al.20 replaced the benzothiophene of the fused-ring core of Y6 with quinoxaline and constructed a new Y6-based NFA named AQx-2, and the PCE of the OSC (D: PM6, A: AQx-2) was up to 16.64%. Gao et al.21 created a new acceptor BP5T-4F by fusing five thiophene units into the core of Y6, and the PCE of OSC (D: PM6, A: BP5T-4F) raised to 16.70%. However, as far as the π-bridge engineering of Y6 is concerned, only the following reports are available to the best of our knowledge. For example, Hai et al.22 attached vinylene to one side (BTP-1V-2F) of the core of Y6, and the PCE (14.24%) of OSC (D: PM6, A: BTP-1V-2F) is one of the highest values for binary single-junction OSCs based on an ultra-narrow bandgap NFA with a bandgap below 1.29 eV. Zheng and coworkers23 attempted to add two thiophene units to both sides of the core of Y6 to design and model a new acceptor BTTPT-4F-2T. Their theoretical results indicate that the complexes (D: PM6, A: BTTPT-4F-2T) have advantages in charge transfer rate at the donor–acceptor interface, light absorption, and electron mobility over the complex (D: PM6, A: Y6).
As mentioned above, it is clear that there are only a few reports on π-bridge engineering for Y6, and the effects of inserting different types and numbers of π-bridge units and π-bridge side chain modifications on the properties of Y6 have not been systematically investigated. In addition, π-bridge engineering has been experimentally demonstrated to effectively alter the IEPP effect and energy level to further enhance the PCE of OSCs.24–28 Therefore, based on the above considerations, we first screen the most promising candidates among different types of five-membered ring π-bridges, and on this basis, we further explore the effects of different numbers of π-bridge and π-bridge side chain modifications on the photoelectric properties of Y6.
In recent years, quantum chemical calculations have been widely used to study the side chain and fused ring modification and optoelectronic properties of Y6.29–34 At the same time, considering the cost and time of experimental synthesis of all possible Y6 derivatives, it is extremely essential to screen Y6 derivatives with excellent synthetic properties by quantum chemical calculations and to summarize the effects of π-bridge on Y6. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT)35 and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)36 have been proven to be effective methods for calculating the electronic structure of organic molecules.37 Therefore, DFT and TD-DFT are employed to calculate the following performance metrics: (1) dipole moment, affecting molecular stacking and active layer morphology.38–41 (2) Frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), altering open circuit voltage (VOC) and energy level matching.42,43 (3) Exciton binding energy (Eb) and singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔEST), critical for exciton dissociation and voltage loss.44–48 (4) UV-vis absorption spectra, measuring photon absorption. (5) Recombination energy, vital for the rate of charge transfer.49 Based on these key performance metrics, the effects of the π-bridge on Y6 photoelectric performance are comprehensively analysed.
2 Computational details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian16 software package (Revision B.01).50 To reduce computational costs, the alkyl side chains of Y6 and its derivatives were simplified to methyl groups. And the polarizable continuum model (IFE-PCM)51 was applied to simulate the solvent environment (chloroform). The hybrid density functional B3LYP and basis set 6-31+G(d) were chosen to optimize the geometry structures and frequency calculations were performed to exclude imaginary frequency, which are widely used in calculating photoelectric properties of Y6-based acceptors.30–34 Due to the problems of electron self-interaction error and derivative discontinuity in traditional DFT, we chose the long range corrected (LRC) functional CAM-B3LYP31,52 with the 6-31+G(d) basis set to calculate the dipole moment, frontier molecular orbital energy, excited states, exciton binding energy, and singlet–triplet energy gap. The recombination energies of Y6 and its derivatives are performed at the level of B3LYP/6-31+G(d) (see the ESI,† Table S2). Here, a total of 50 one-electron excited states were calculated. To thoroughly study the ICT characteristics of S0–S1 of Y6 and its derivatives, the transferred charge amount and charge density difference (CDD) were analysed using the Multiwfn 3.8 (Dev) program.53 The VMD (Revision 1.9.3) programs54 were employed to achieve the HOMO–LUMO orbital diagrams.
The exciton binding energy Eb, the Coulomb interaction that stabilizes the exciton with respect to free electrons and holes, is one of the key factors to the optoelectronic performance of organic materials.55 If Eb is low, the excitons are loosely bound, favoring the generation of free electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, if Eb is high, the excitons are strongly bound, which is favorable for the recombination of free electron–hole pairs.56 Therefore, organic photovoltaic materials with low Eb can gain efficient exciton separation.44 Experimentally, the exciton binding energies can be obtained by applying several complementary experimental techniques.57 In theory, Eb is usually defined as the difference between the fundamental gap (Efundg) and the optical gap (Eoptg).55,56 Eb = Efundg − Eoptg(1) Efundg = IP − EA(2)where Eoptg represents the vertical excitation energy from the ground state (S0) to the first singlet excited state (S1) calculated by TD-DFT, IP stands for electron ionization potential, and EA stands for electron affinity.
ΔEST is also an important metric to measure organic photovoltaic materials, and it refers to the difference between the lowest non-charge transfer (CT) singlet state (S1) and triplet excited state (T1). Lower ΔEST can effectively reduce the voltage loss of exciton dissociation and charge recombination.29,47 ΔEST = ES1 − ET1(3)
The recombination energy λ is a key performance metric for calculating the charge transfer rate based on the semi-classical Marcus theory, which predicts the charge transfer properties of NFAs and interfaces.49 The lower λ can improve the transfer rate of electrons and holes. Generally speaking, λ is mainly divided into internal reorganization energy λi and external reorganization energy λo. In this work, only λi is considered. It can be divided into electron recombination energy λe and hole recombination energy λh. The λe and λh can be expressed as58,59 λe = (E−0 − E0) + (E0− − E−)(4) λh = (E+0 − E0) + (E0+ − E+)(5)Here, E−0(E+0) is defined as the energy of anion (cation) ion under the neutral structure, E0− (E0+) represents the neutral energy under the anion (cation) ion structure, E0, E−, and E+ represents the optimized neutral structure energy, anion structure energy, and cation structure energy, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 The choice of π-bridge units

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the structures of Y6 and its different types of π-bridge derivatives, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(b), nine different types of π-bridge units are chosen to connect the TPBT unit and 2FIC unit of Y6 to gain the corresponding derivatives, which are named BTP-2C-2F, BTP-2N-2F, BTP-2O-2F, BTP-2Si-2F, BTP-2P-2F, BTP-2S-2F, BTP-2Ge-2F, BTP-2As-2F, and BTP-2Se-2F, respectively (see Fig. S1 for the optimized structures, ESI†). The π-bridge unit with the most promising performance is selected for further study based on the following criteria: moderate dipole moment, small exciton binding energy, and enhanced absorption strength. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the dipole moments of BTP-2C-2F, BTP-2Ge-2F, and BTP-2O-2F are all greater than 11.00 D, while the dipole moments of Y6 and the remaining π-bridge derivatives are lower than 9.00 D. Suitably enhancing the dipole moment can enhance molecular self-assembly and improve molecular crystallinity.40,60 Conversely, an excessively large dipole moment can lead to unwanted aggregation, which is not conducive to phase separation and exciton dissociation.41 For example, Hou and co-workers synthesized the Y6-based NFA BTPTT-4Cl with a dipole moment of 1.44 D, slightly larger than that of Y6 (0.64 D). Consequently, the aggregation of BTPTT-4Cl is slightly increased compared to Y6 in the experimental measurements, which in turn enhances the JSC. The PCE of OSC with PM6 as donor and BTPTT-4Cl as NFA increased to 16.1% (average).39 In contrast, a counterexample is the Y6-based acceptor BTPT-4F synthesized by Cao et al.61 The PCE of OSC P2F-EHp/BTPT-4F is only 1.09%. The reason for this sharp drop is that its too large dipole moment (11.64 D) induces strong aggregation and large domains.33,62 Moreover, the large grain size is not conducive to the donor–acceptor interpenetration, hindering the effective charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface.61,63 Therefore, BTP-2S-2F, BTP-2N-2F, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-2As-2F, BTP-2P-2F, and BTP-2Si-2F have excellent properties in terms of dipole moment.

As shown in Fig. 2(b), the Eb of BTP-2N-2F, BTP-2S-2F, BTP-2Se-2F, and BTP-2P-2F are lower than that of Y6 by 0.125 eV, 0.024 eV, 0.007 eV, and 0.014 eV, respectively, while Eb of BTP-2As-2F and BTP-2Si-2F are higher than Y6. Christine et al.64 demonstrated that lowering Eb can promote exciton separation and increase VOC to improve the PCE of OSCs. Hence, BTP-2N-2F, BTP-2S-2F, BTP-2Se-2F, and BTP-2P-2F may be potential acceptor materials with excellent properties. As can be seen from Fig. 2(c), BTP-2Se-2F and BTP-2S-2F have higher absorption intensity and wider absorption range than BTP-2P-2F and BTP-2N-2F, which may be beneficial to enhancing the short-circuit current density (JSC).65 Since the introduction of thiophene as a π-bridge unit between the TPBT unit and 2FIC unit of Y6 has been studied, this work selects selenophene as the π-bridge unit to connect the TPBT unit and the 2FIC unit of Y6 for further study.
In order to further explore the influence of the length of selenophene π-bridge on the photoelectric performance of Y6, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-4Se-2F, BTP-6Se-2F, and BTP-8Se-2F are designed. In addition, the π-bridge side chains of BTP-2Se-2F are bilaterally substituted with halogen atoms (–F, –Cl, –Br) to gain the corresponding derivatives BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F. The structures of Y6 and its seven selenophene π-bridge derivatives are shown in Fig. 3 (see Fig. S2 for the optimized structures, ESI†).

3.2 Electronic properties
The dipole moments of Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives are illustrated in Fig. 4(a) and (b). It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that the dipole moment first rises rapidly from 0.15 to 4.88 D as the number of selenophene π-bridges increases from 0 to 1, then as the number of selenophene π bridges increases from 1 to 3, the dipole moment first remains constant and then slightly increases from 4.88 to 5.06 D, and finally when the number of selenophene π-bridges exceeds 3, the dipole moment decreases from 5.06 to 4.31 D. This suggests that an excessively long selenophene π-bridges length may lead to a decrease in the dipole moment. The moderate dipole moment can enhance the self-assembly and molecular packing to improve the morphology of OSCs, which is beneficial to the enhancement of the PCE of Y6.39–41 Therefore, increasing the number of selenophene π-bridges of Y6 may be beneficial to strengthen its PCE.

The HOMO, LUMO, HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Egap (eV)), and HOMO/LUMO orbital distribution of (c) Y6, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-4Se-2F, BTP-6Se-2F, and BTP-8Se-2F and (d) BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F. All results are obtained at the level of CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/PCM. 
It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the side chains of the selenophene π-bridge modified with halogen atoms will lead to further increase of the dipole moment of BTP-2Se-2F from 4.88 to 10.04 D, and the increase in the dipole moment is related to the electronegativity of the halogen atoms. The greater the electronegativity, the larger the rise in the dipole moment. Applying this strategy is helpful to adjust the dipole moment of NFAs. However, excessive dipole moment may lead to unnecessary aggregation and the formation of oversized aggregates, resulting in the inability to obtain a suitable phase separation size as well as the formation of nanoscale interpenetrating network structures between the donor and the acceptor.33,61 In addition, the large aggregates or grains in the system will diminish exciton migration to the donor/acceptor interface and is not favorable for charge separation.41,63 Therefore, the too large dipole moments of BTP-2SeF-2F (10.04 D) may induce strong aggregation and hinder the transfer of charges at the donor–acceptor interface.
The HOMO/LUMO energy level and the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Egap) are closely related to the electronic properties, carrier transport properties, and optical absorptions that affect the PCE of the OSCs.66,67 As seen in Fig. 4(c), the LUMO energies of the four derivatives increase slightly with the increase of the length of π-bridge, and the LUMO energies of the four derivatives are 0.08–0.09 eV higher than those of Y6. It is beneficial to enhance the VOC of OSCs based on these derivatives because the VOC is directly related to the energy offset between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor.42 At the same time, the four derivatives have higher HOMO energies than those of Y6 by 0.34–0.56 eV and the HOMO energies of the four derivatives gradually rise with the increase of the number of π-bridges. Such results may be due to the fact that the HOMO energy level of the entire conjugated acceptor molecule is dominated primarily by the electron-rich aromatic unit in the acceptor, and the introduction of electron-rich aromatic ring selenophene as π-bridges as well as increasing the number of electron-rich fused ring selenophene π-bridges can further enhance the electron-donating ability of the derivatives.68–71 In addition, the HOMO energy grows more rapidly compared with the LUMO energy, resulting in a lower Egap for the four derivatives than that of Y6, and the Egap gradually declines from 3.84 to 3.37 eV with the increase of the number of π-bridges. As can be seen in Fig. 4(d), modifying the selenophene π-bridge side chains with halogen atoms leads to a slight decrease in the HOMO energy and the LUMO energy of BTP-2Se-2F, which may be attributed to the fact that the halogen atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing substituents.72 And the LUMO energy decreases faster, so that BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F have lower Egap than those of BTP-2Se-2F by 0.08–0.11 eV. The lower Egap will lead to the reduction of the optical gap and red-shift of the absorption spectra.17 Therefore, the designed selenophene π-bridge derivatives may all exhibit a red-shift of the absorption spectra compared with Y6.

Fig. 4(c) and (d) also exhibit the HOMO/LUMO orbital distribution of Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives. It can be seen from the orbital distribution diagrams that the HOMO of Y6 is mainly distributed on the TPBT unit, while the LUMO is delocalized in the whole molecule, indicating that Y6 is localized excitation. For the selenophene π-bridge derivatives, HOMO is mainly distributed in the TPBT unit and π-bridge unit, and LUMO is primarily distributed in the π-bridge unit and 2FIC unit, with less distribution in the TPBT unit. This implies that the electrons of the S0–S1 excitation of selenophene π-bridge derivatives are transferred from the TPBT unit to the π-bridge unit and 2FIC unit, and there is a more significant ICT trend than Y6.
The results of frontier molecular orbital analysis suggest that π-bridge modifications could be used as effective methods to tune the energy levels of Y6 to better match different donor materials and gain higher PCE.
3.3 Optical properties
The absorption spectra of Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives are displayed in Fig. 5. The detailed λmax (by the S0–S1 transitions), major orbital transition contribution, oscillator strength, and excitation energies of Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives are exhibited in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that as the number of selenophene π-bridges increases from 0 to 4, the molar absorption coefficient of Y6 rises from 1.21 × 105 to 2.36 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1, and the absorption range becomes evidently broader and exhibits a red-shift of 28–40 nm, which is attributed to the enhancement of conjugation effects by extending π-bridge length. Although the λmax of BTP-8Se-2F is blue-shifted by 10 nm than that of BTP-6Se-2F, it can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that BTP-8Se-2F further broadens the absorption range and enhances the absorption strength of BTP-6Se-2F, which can be explained by the reduction of Egap and the enhancement of conjugation effects.
 Fig. 5  Simulated UV-vis absorption spectra of (a) Y6, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-4Se-2F, BTP-6Se-2F, and BTP-8Se-2F and (b) BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F at the level of of CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/PCM. The half-width of the absorption spectra is set to 0.333 eV. 
As exhibited in Fig. 5(b), the absorption spectra of the derivative BTP-2Se-2F exhibits a further red-shift from 638 to 654 nm, which is attributed to the enhanced IEPP effects and reduced Egap. Among them, the main absorption peak (by the S0–S1 transitions) of BTP-2SeCl-2F and BTP-2SeBr-2F exhibit a slight red-shift of 4 nm compared with BTP-2SeF-2F, which may be attributed to the larger atomic sizes and stronger conjugation effects of chlorine and bromine atoms compared with fluorine atoms.73,74 However, the molar absorption coefficient of BTP-2Se-2F exhibit a slight decrease by modifying the selenophene π-bridge side chains with halogen atoms, but all of them are higher than that of Y6.
These results imply that the selenophene π-bridge derivatives exhibit a wider absorption range, higher absorption intensity, and red-shift of absorption spectra than Y6, which may be beneficial for Y6 to absorb solar radiation and enhance the JSC for improving PCE.65,75 Hence, we can consider extending the length of selenophene π-bridge and modifying its side chain as feasible methods to enhance the light absorption performance of Y6.
3.4 Exciton binding energy and singlet–triplet energy gap
The exciton binding energy Eb is one of the key factors to the optoelectronic performance of organic materials. A strong Eb will lead to extra energy loss in the exciton separation process of OSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize Eb to reduce the energy loss during exciton dissociation.7,23 The Eb of Y6 and its derivatives are illustrated in Fig. 6(a) and (b). From Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that the Eb of Y6 gradually decreases from 0.364 to 0.228 eV as the number of selenophene π-bridges increases from 0 to 4, and the Eb decreases almost linearly with the number of selenophene π-bridges increases from 1 to 4. As can be seen from Fig. 6(b), the Eb of BTP-2Se-2F is further reduced from 0.357 to 0.272 eV by modifying the selenophene π-bridge side chains with halogen atoms, which is attributed to the halogen atoms strengthening the IEPP effects of BTP-2Se-2F. Moreover, chlorine and bromine atoms have larger atomic sizes compared with fluorine atoms, so BTP-2SeCl-2F and BTP-2SeBr-2F have lower exciton binding energies than BTP-2SeF-2F.73 In general, the extension of the selenophene π-bridge and the selection of halogen atoms to modify the side chains of selenophene π-bridge can effectively reduce the Eb, which indicates that selenophene π-bridge derivatives are more easily split into free-charge carriers than Y6 and the energy loss of exciton dissociation of Y6 can be further reduced.
 Fig. 6  The exciton binding energies (eV) of (a) Y6, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-4Se-2F, BTP-6Se-2F, and BTP-8Se-2F, and (b) BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F; the singlet–triplet energy gaps of (eV) of (c) Y6, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-4Se-2F, BTP-6Se-2F, and BTP-8Se-2F and (d) BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F. All results are obtained at the level of CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/PCM. 
The singlet–triplet energy gaps ΔEST of Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). Based on the analysis in the previous section on light absorption characteristics, the selenophene π-bridge derivatives exhibit a red-shift of the main absorption peak (by the S0–S1 transition) compared to Y6, which indicates the downshift of the optical gap and predicts the reduction of ES1 and ET1 of derivatives.23 Indeed, it can be seen from Fig. 6(c) that with the gradual extension of the conjugate bridge, the ES1 and ET1 of Y6 decrease from 2.036 to 1.924 and 1.226 to 1.059 eV, respectively. However, the ET1 decreases more rapidly, so the derivatives obtain higher ΔEST than those of Y6 by 0.026–0.062 eV. It can be seen from Fig. 6(d) that ES1 of BTP-2Se-2F further drops from 1.923 to 1.886 eV, ET1 drops from 1.087 to 1.065 eV, and the ES1 drops faster. Thus, BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F obtain lower ΔEST than that of BTP-2Se-2F by 0.013–0.018 eV, but the ΔEST of three derivatives are all higher than Y6. This suggests that extending the length of the selenophene π-bridge and selecting halogen atoms to modify the side chains of selenophene π-bridge cannot further reduce the ΔEST of Y6, which may increase the energy loss of Y6 during charge recombination.47
These results imply that extending the conjugation length of π-bridge and modifying the side chains of selenophene π-bridge units with halogen atoms can promote the dissociation of excitons, but are not conducive to the further reduction of the single–triplet energy gap of Y6.
3.5 Recombination energies
According to previous reports on Y6-based receptors, the calculation method B3LYP can be applied to describe the recombination energies of Y6 and its derivatives.32,33 The computational method CAM-B3LYP may not be suitable for calculating the recombination energies of Y6 and its derivatives by the analysis (see the ESI,† Table S2). Therefore, the calculation of the recombination energy is performed at the level of B3LYP/6-31+G(d). As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), the electron recombination energies λe of Y6 and its seven derivatives are considerably smaller than the hole recombination energies λh, indicating that Y6 and its seven derivatives are more appropriate as electron-transporting materials.76 As displayed in Fig. 7(a), the λe is in the order of BTP-6Se-2F < BTP-8Se-2F < BTP-4Se-2F < BTP-2Se-2F < Y6, suggesting that increasing the number of selenophene π-bridges may be beneficial for improving the electron mobility by reducing the λe. Among them, BTP-8Se-2F obtains a larger λe than BTP-6Se-2F, probably because the molecular backbone of BTP-8Se-2F is too long, which tends to deform the molecular backbone and is not conducive to charge transport.77 As can be seen from Fig. 7(b), the selection of halogen atoms to modify the selenophene π-bridge will not be able to further reduce the λe of BTP-2Se-2F, but all of them are lower than that of Y6. This suggests that the modification of side chains of selenophene π-bridge with halogen atoms is beneficial to enhancing the electron transport capability of Y6.
 Fig. 7  The recombination energies (eV) of (a) Y6, BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-4Se-2F, BTP-6Se-2F, and BTP-8Se-2F and (b) BTP-2Se-2F, BTP-2SeF-2F, BTP-2SeCl-2F, and BTP-2SeBr-2F are obtained at the level of B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/PCM. 
The new Y-series NFAs we designed all show lower λe than Y6, indicating that these acceptor materials are worth considering as excellent candidates.
3.6 Intramolecular charge transfer
In order to quantify the charge transfer in electron excitation, the amounts of net charge transfer of the S0–S1 transition (corresponds to the main absorption peak) of Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives are calculated, as shown in Fig. 8, and the detailed charge transfer amounts between each fragment are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives are divided into intermediate fragment 1, π-bridge fragment 2, and terminal fragment 3, respectively. For the electron excitation process of Y6, the direction of charge transfer is from fragment 1 to fragment 3 with a net transfer of 0.180 electrons. For the selenophene π-bridge derivatives, the direction of charge is transferred from fragment 1 to fragment 2 and fragment 3 with net transfer of 0.166–0.234 electrons. Thus, the introduction of the selenophene π-bridge can cause a stronger ICT effect by raising the transferred charge amounts. However, BTP-8Se-2F obtains slightly smaller amounts of net charge transfer than Y6, probably because the molecular backbone of BTP-8Se-2F is too long, which tends to deform the molecular backbone and is not conducive to charge transport.
 Fig. 8  The amount of net charge transfer of S0–S1 between TPBT (red, fragment 1), π-bridges (green, fragment 2), and 2FIC (blue, fragment 3) molecular fragments of Y6 and its seven selenophene π-bridge derivatives. (Net transfer is the amount of total charge transferred from fragments 1 and 2 to fragment 3.) 
In addition, the transferred charge amounts of BTP-2Se-2F are further raised from 0.234 to 0.278 electrons by modifying the selenophene π-bridge side chains with halogen atoms, which is attributed to strong electronegativity of the halogen atoms that strengthen the IEPP effects of BTP-2Se-2F. Therefore, the selection of halogen atoms to modify the side chains of π bridge units is an effective strategy to promote intramolecular charge transfer.
The hole–electron distribution indexes and the charge density difference (CDD) are also evaluated for Y6 and its selenophene π-bridge derivatives, as shown in Table S4 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). It can be observed from the CDD that the charge density on the TPBT unit decrease and the charge density at selenophene π-bridge unit and 2FIC unit increase. Thus, the transition type can be preliminarily estimated to be π–π* charge transfer excitation, in which the charges are transferred from the middle TPBT unit to the π-bridge unit and the 2FIC unit. In addition, the analysis of the hole–electron distribution indexes demonstrates that both the introduction of the selenophene π-bridge and modification of the π-bridge side chains with halogen atoms can lead to more efficient exciton separation, which is consistent with the above analysis results.
In general, extending the length of π-conjugation and modifying the side chains of selenophene π-bridge units with halogen atoms can lead to a stronger ICT effect for improving the charge transfer characters, but the excessively long selenophene π-bridge length may be not conducive to the increase of intramolecular charge transfer amounts. Moreover, introducing the selenophene π-bridge and modifying the π-bridge side chains with halogen atoms is beneficial to further strengthen the separation of excitions.
4 Conclusions
In this work, a series of new Y6 derivatives are designed based on Y6 applying π-bridge modifications, and the photoelectric metrics of these new Y6 derivatives are calculated using DFT and TD-DFT methods. The following conclusions are drawn from this work:
1. The study of different five-membered ring π-bridges shows that the thiophene π-bridge and the selenophene π-bridge all have superior properties in terms of dipole moment, exciton binding energy, and light absorption compared with other π-bridges. Compared with the thiophene π-bridge, the selenophene π-bridge has higher absorption intensity and larger exciton binding energy. In this work, only the selenophene π-bridge is further studied.
2. The results of the studies on different numbers of selenophene π-bridges show that the derivatives have higher LUMO energy levels compared with Y6, and the LUMO energy levels increase with the number of selenophene π-bridges, which can provide larger VOC. In addition, the selenophene π-bridge derivatives exhibit a stronger absorption intensity (over 45%) and a red-shift of 28–40 nm of the main absorption peak (by the S0–S1 transitions) in the NIR regions compared to Y6. The absorption intensity and absorption range of Y6 keep strengthening and broadening with the increase of the number of selenophene π-bridges. At the same time, the selenophene π-bridges derivatives reduce the Eb of Y6 by 13–29% and exhibit the trend of decreasing with the growing number of selenophene π-bridges. All of the above properties play an important role in improving the PCE of Y6-based OSCs. However, extending the length of the selenophene π-bridge cannot further reduce the ΔEST of Y6 and too long a molecular backbone is not conducive to charge transport, which may increase the energy loss of Y6 during charge recombination.
3. The results of the side chain modifications of the selenophene π-bridge show that the selection of halogen atoms to modify the side chains of the selenophene π-bridge will lead to the reduction of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BTP-2Se-2F, particularly the LUMO energy level, which is conducive to the further reduction of the Egap. Furthermore, the side chain modifications of the selenophene π-bridge can further reduce the Eb and ΔEST, promote the red-shift of 12–16 nm of the main absorption peaks (by the S0–S1 transitions), and enhance the ICT effects of BTP-2Se-2F. However, the recombination energy of BTP-2Se-2F and the ΔEST of Y6 could not be further reduced.
In conclusion, the photoelectric performance of Y6 is enhanced by extending the conjugated bridge and modifying the side chains of the selenophene π-bridge, so we can believe that π-bridge modifications are effective strategies to tune the photoelectric performance of Y6, and we hope that this study can provide some theoretical support for the experimental design of new high-performance Y6 derivatives.
