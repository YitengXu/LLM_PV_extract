, Accepted 11th August 2014First published on 11th August 2014AbstractZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod array films were successfully synthesized by aqueous solution growth followed by a spin coating process and studied for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting under solar light. Through the spin coating process, ZnFe2O4 was found mainly to exist at the top surface of the α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. After being modified by ZnFe2O4, the α-Fe2O3 nanorod film was identified as a suitable surface treatment, and showed an increased photocurrent density when used as the photoanode. It was demonstrated that ZnFe2O4 increased the charge carrier density and acted as the oxidation cocatalyst. These results suggested that surface treatment by ZnFe2O4 should be a practical strategy to improve the efficiency of α-Fe2O3 or other metal oxide photoanodes for PEC solar fuel conversion.
Introduction
To meet the world's increasing energy demands, efficient hydrogen generation from photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes has been a significant objective for researchers in recent decades.1–4 Some metal oxides, such as TiO2, WO3, ZnO, α-Fe2O3, and BiVO4 have been developed or modified to obtain high-performance photoanodes in PEC water splitting cells.5–9 Hematite (α-Fe2O3), an n-type semiconductor, has many benefits for PEC water splitting, including good chemical stability, efficient visible-light absorption, non-poisonousness, low cost and earth-abundance. The band energy gap of 2.1 eV allows hematite to utilize a large portion of solar light for photoanodic water oxidation.10 However, the experimental solar hydrogen conversion efficiency is still far from the theoretical value in an ideal tandem PEC configuration,10,11 because hematite has relatively poor conductivity, high charge recombination rates, poor oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm).12–16
Nowadays, numerous strategies have been tested to overcome hematite's disadvantages toward efficient solar water splitting, for example, manipulating hematite with nanostructures, metal ion doping, creating heterojunction to enable charge separation and surface modification.17 Many previous works demonstrated that the modification of hematite surface with oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) could effectively promote the PEC performance.17,18 According to Tilley's study,19 IrO2 nanoparticles, acting as OECs, were deposited by electrophoresis onto the hematite photoanode to lower the kinetic barrier for interfacial charge-transfer. In this case, the overpotential required for water oxidation was remarkably lowered and a photocurrent density of 3 mA cm−2 was achieved for PEC water splitting with hematite at applied potential of +1.23 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) under simulated sunlight. Cobalt compounds have also been used as OECs for PEC water splitting when coated on the surface of anodes.20,21 Riha et al.22 found that the PEC water oxidation performance was significantly improved for hematite photoanodes coated with an ultrathin [Co(OH)2/Co3O4] by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Co2+ monolayer, Co(OH)2, CoOx, and cobalt(II)–phosphate complexes (Co–Pi) were also investigated as efficient OECs for PEC water splitting over hematite photoanodes.23–25 Hu et al.26 used CoF3 to modify the surface of Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 thin film photoanodes, which improved photocurrent significantly by shifting the flat-band potential negatively, and allowed photogenerated electrons to directly reduce water to hydrogen without an external bias. Other than OECs, the PEC performances can be also improved by passivating surface states to reduce charge recombination. Xi et al.27 reported that PEC performance can be increased by depositing a very thin ZnO overlayer on top of a thin film of hematite. After ZnO surface treatment, the photocurrent density was increased by more than 40% to 1.08 mA cm−2 at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl and the onset potential for water oxidation was shifted by ∼170 mV.27 It was proposed that the ZnO overlayer changed the flat band potential of hematite and reduced surface defects.27
On the other hand, the formation of nanostructured architectures improves charge collection efficiency by shortening the distance that the charge carriers have to travel for surface water splitting reaction.28,29 Specifically, one-dimensional nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes have shown promising performances for PEC water splitting, mainly due to the channelized electron transport and delayed electron–hole recombination.17,30 For example, Lindgren et al.31 reported that α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays showed much higher PEC performance than nanoparticulate α-Fe2O3, as the designed nanorod structure reduces the transport distance required for photoinduced charge carriers to reach the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.
ZnFe2O4 was generally used as powder-like or colloidal photocatalysts for the decomposition of organic compounds32–37 or photochemical hydrogen production from water. Moreover, it can sensitize wide band gap semiconductors (e.g., TiO2) in visible light region,38,39 due to its relatively narrow band gap (1.9 eV) and decent photochemical stability.18 In this study, α-Fe2O3 nanorod films were firstly fabricated by a low cost and large scalable solution growth method, and then ZnFe2O4 was used to modify α-Fe2O3 nanorod films by a facile spin-coating method using Zn and Fe contained precursor solution, with the nanorod structure kept for directed charge transfer.17 Due to the difference between ZnFe2O4 and α-Fe2O3's conduction and valence band edge positions, the electrons generated in the ZnFe2O4 layer can move to the α-Fe2O3 side, and the holes can move from α-Fe2O3 side to the ZnFe2O4 layer.40 It was then found that ZnFe2O4 could increase the charge carrier density and reduce surface charge recombination by absorbing more photons and catalyzing surface oxidation reaction, respectively, which resulted in enhanced PEC performance for water splitting over α-Fe2O3 photoanode. By varying the concentrations of the ZnFe2O4 precursor solutions within a wide range, the modifying amounts of ZnFe2O4 can be easily tuned and optimized to achieve the highest PEC performance for solar water splitting. Further considering the practical application of α-Fe2O3 photoanode for solar energy conversion, the presented facile film-fabrication process and suchlike will be more likely acceptable. The above information may provide novel hints for further contribution to high efficiency and low cost photoelectrode fabrication and modification.
Experimental
Sample preparation
All the experiments were conducted at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China. All chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorod films were fabricated on the conductive fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) glasses via an aqueous chemical growth method developed by Vayssieres.41 After ultrasonically cleaned by acetone, alcohol and deionized water for 10 minutes, consecutively, two FTO glasses were placed back-to-back and were leant against the inner wall of the cap sealed glass bottles. Then, 20 mL of deionized water, 3 mmol of ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O), 20 mmol of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and 50 μL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37.5 wt%) were added to the bottles. After heating in an oven for 24 hours at 100 °C, yellowish iron oxyhydroxide (akaganite, β-FeOOH) film was formed on the FTO substrate. The β-FeOOH film was carefully rinsed by deionized water, dried at room temperature, and then annealed at 750 °C for 10 minutes with ramping rate of 25 °C min−1 to obtain the α-Fe2O3 nanorod film. The film color changed from yellowish to dark red, suggesting successful conversion from β-FeOOH to α-Fe2O3.
The ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films were prepared by spinning coating ZnFe2O4 precursor solutions with different concentrations onto the top of β-FeOOH nanorod films at a fixed rotation speed of 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and subsequently annealed at 750 °C for 10 minutes with ramping rates of 25 °C min−1. The ZnFe2O4 precursor solution was prepared using ethylene glycol as the solvent and citric acid as the coordinating agent.42 Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were used as the zinc and iron resources, respectively. 5.57 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 15.13 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water containing 43.16 g of citric acid with continuously stirring under 80 °C. Then aqueous ammonia was added slowly until the color of the solution did not change. After stirring for 30 min to fully accomplish the reaction, a transparent greenish ZnFe2O4 precursor solution was obtained, which was then diluted using distilled water to different concentrations. Different ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films were obtained by spinning coating ZnFe2O4 precursor solutions with different concentrations (e.g., 9 and 45 mg mL−1), which were denoted as ZFO-1 and ZFO-2, respectively.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared nanorod films were carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, using Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 15.4184 nm)). A Raman scattering study was performed on a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer using 514.5 nm irradiation from an argon ion laser at 20 mW. Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a HITACHI UV4100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped with integrating labsphere diffuse reflectance accessory. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed by a Kratos spectrometer (AXIS Ultra DLD) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.69 eV) and with a concentric hemispherical analyzer. The charge calibration was done by correcting C 1s line of adventitious carbon setting to 284.8 eV to compensate the charge effect. The surface and crystal morphologies of the films were conducted using a JEOL JSM-7800F field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) from and a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM) at an accelerating voltage of 300 KV.
Photoelectrochemical studies
PEC performances were measured under simulated solar light in a three-electrode configuration by a scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments, CHI 760D). Pristine and ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays mounted onto a specially designed electrode holder were used as the working electrodes. The surface areas exposed to the electrolyte were fixed at 0.785 cm2. The light intensity was measured by a fiber optic spectrometer (AvaSpec2048), and was set at 100 mW cm−2 through an AM 1.5 G filter (Oriel). A platinum foil, an Ag/AgCl electrode, and an aqueous solution of 0.1 M glucose and 0.5 M NaOH (pH = 13.0) were used as the counter electrode, the reference electrode, and the electrolyte, respectively. N2 gas was continuously bubbled through the solution before and during the experiment to remove any dissolved O2 and, therefore, suppress the reduction of O2 at the counter electrode. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a 300 W Xe lamp integrated with a computer-controlled monochromator (Beijing Optic Instrument Factory), a photochopper (PARC) and a lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery) were used for photocurrent detection. The absolute intensity of the incident light from the monochromator was measured with a radiometer/photometer (International Light). All IPCE measurements were carried out under potential-controlled conditions, with 0.5 V as the applied potential versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Mott–Schottky measurement in dark was carried out in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at a frequency of 1000 Hz, with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.
Results and discussion
XRD measurement was performed on pristine and ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 films, with XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1A XRD peaks at 24.1°, 35.7°, 41.1°, 49.6°, 62.5°, 64.2° corresponding to (012), (110), (113), (024), (214), (300) reflections confirmed the formation of α-Fe2O3 phase with rhombohedra crystal system (standard card JCPDS 24-0072). There was no peak shift, stretching or shrinking, and no additional peaks appeared other than FTO's XRD peaks. The absence of any indication of ZnFe2O4 XRD patterns implies that the amount of ZnFe2O4 loaded onto α-Fe2O3 nanorods was tiny and under the detection limit of XRD characterization.

Raman spectra for various samples are shown in Fig. 1B. Previously reported by Kumarn et al.43 that undoped α-Fe2O3 (hematite) displayed exclusively the characteristic peaks of α-Fe2O3 at 220, 241, 288, 402, 488, 602 cm−1, which perfectly matched Raman spectra in Fig. 1B, again confirming the hematite phase for these obtained films. In addition, ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 samples displayed an additional but weak peak at around 655 cm−1 with intensity increasing with an increase of ZnFe2O4 precursor concentration. Other than this, there were no significant differences between pristine and modified α-Fe2O3.
The optical absorption properties of the films were calculated by absorbance = 1 − transmittance − reflectance after measuring its spectral reflectance and transmittance (Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI†).44 The absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. 1C. The absorption edge of pristine α-Fe2O3 is around 590 nm, lying in the visible region, with band gap of ca. 2.10 eV, which is quite close to the previously reported values.45,46 After ZnFe2O4 modification, although the absorption onset and calculated band gap (Fig. S3 in the ESI†) remained almost unchanged, the amounts of light absorbed by the ZFO-1 and ZFO-2 films increased in visible light region, because of the decreased transmittance of the ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 films (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).
XPS Zn 2p spectra of α-Fe2O3 nanorod films after surface treatment with ZnFe2O4 was shown in Fig. 1D to reveal the existence of Zn ions from ZnFe2O4. The binding energies for Zn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 levels were located at 1022.1 eV and 1045.4 eV, respectively, matching well with the previous results.47,48 These values are assigned to the Zn2+ state,27 which to some extent means the presence of ZnFe2O4 at the top surface of α-Fe2O3 nanorod films.
Fig. 2A shows the SEM image of the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorod film, with thickness of ∼600 nm and the diameter of 30–60 nm. After treatment with ZnFe2O4, the film thickness did not change greatly (inset in Fig. 2B and C), while the diameter of nanorods increased gradually with the increasing concentration of ZnFe2O4 precursor solutions (see Fig. 2B and C). With the nanorods' cross section maintained round-like shape, the increase in diameter can be attributed to the surface covered by ZnFe2O4. Fig. 2D shows the XPS etching profile of Zn:Fe molar ratio for ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 (ZFO-1) nanorod film. It was easily observed that Zn stayed on the top of α-Fe2O3 nanorods after the treatment of ZnFe2O4, with the etching time prolonging, the molar ratio of Zn:Fe decreased rapidly. Similar element distribution depending on etching depth was also observed in our previous studies on Cr and W doped α-Fe2O3 nanorod films fabricated by spin-coating Cr and W contained precursor solution on the top surface of α-Fe2O3 nanorod films.45,46 This should be due to the surface tension of precursor solution which cannot get into the in-between space of the nanorods. Thus, it is reasonable that by the spin-coating method the ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod arrays can possess relatively large amount of Zn on the top surface of the nanorod film.

Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of pristine and ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films. Pristine α-Fe2O3 shows the morphology of nanorods (Fig. 3A), as grown in aqueous solution.41,45 The high-resolution TEM image of pristine α-Fe2O3 film (Fig. 1B) reveals that the surface of the nanorods is very clean and smooth, with clear lattice fringe spacings of 2.69 and 2.51 Å corresponding to the (104) and (110) planes of α-Fe2O3, respectively. When compared to the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorods, nanoclusters were attached to the surface of nanorods (Fig. 3C). Lattice fringe spacings, different from those of α-Fe2O3, were observed for these attached nanoclusters. Fig. 3D reveals clear lattice fringe spacing of 2.55 and 2.99 Å, which agrees well with the (311) and (220) plane of cubic spinel phase of ZnFe2O4 (JCPDS 79-1150), respectively, which indicates the successful modification of ZnFe2O4 on α-Fe2O3 nanorods.

The photoelectrochemical performances of the pristine and ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 films were evaluated by measuring the photocurrent density as a function of applied bias vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 4A. The result shows that the surface treatment with ZnFe2O4 brings a great improvement in the PEC performance for the α-Fe2O3 nanorod film. The photocurrent density increased from ∼0.24 mA cm−2 for pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorod film to ∼0.44 mA cm−2 for the ZFO-1 film at 0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Further increasing the concentration of ZnFe2O4 precursor solution for the surface treatment of α-Fe2O3 nanorod film leads to a decrease in PEC performance as obtained for the ZFO-2 film, with photocurrent density of ∼0.30 mA cm−2 at 0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Decrease in photocurrent density is probably because the superfluous ZnFe2O4 loaded on the α-Fe2O3 nanorods might block hole transport to the electrode/electrolyte interface for oxidation reaction.

The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured to further evidence the improvement of PEC performance for the ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films. One can observe in Fig. 4B that the ZFO-1 film showed substantially enhanced IPCE values when compared to the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorod film over the entire wavelength range of 300–600 nm, with IPCE value at 380 nm increased from 8.8% to 17.8%. However, the IPCE value at 380 nm was decreased to 13.6% for the ZFO-2 film, which agrees well with the decreased photocurrent density, as shown in Fig. 4A. As expected from the band gap of α-Fe2O3, all the three IPCE curves drop rapidly at wavelength of 600 nm.49 Anyhow, pristine α-Fe2O3 has the lowest IPCE value, indicating that surface treatment with ZnFe2O4 successfully improved the PEC efficiency of α-Fe2O3 nanorod film.49–52
Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis was conducted for the pristine α-Fe2O3 and ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films, to investigate the effects of ZnFe2O4 on the electrochemical properties of α-Fe2O3. As shown in Fig. 5, the positive slopes indicate that both pristine and ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films are n-type semiconductors with electrons as the majority charge carriers. In general, the smaller the slope, the higher the electron donor density (Nd). As calculated from the slopes of M–S plots using the equation: Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1, where e0 is the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (ε = 80), ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, the electron donor densities were determined to be 5.1 × 1019, 1.2 × 1020, and 9.8 × 1019 cm−3 for pristine α-Fe2O3, ZFO-1 and ZFO-2, respectively. This remarkable increase in electron density for α-Fe2O3 after ZnFe2O4 modification should be related to the enhanced optical absorption, which could produce additional electrons in the conduction band of ZnFe2O4. Moreover, those electrons would transport from ZnFe2O4 to α-Fe2O3, due to the higher energy level of the conduction band of ZnFe2O4 than α-Fe2O3.40 Thus, the increase in electron density in α-Fe2O3 could contribute to the PEC activity enhancement by ZnFe2O4 treatment. M–S analysis also shows that the flat-band potential (Vfb) of ZFO-1 cathodically shifts by 23 mV, when compared to that of pristine α-Fe2O3. This flat-band potential shift is probably due to the efficient hole transport from α-Fe2O3 to ZnFe2O4 as deduced from their valence band difference.40 Thus, here ZnFe2O4 acts as an oxidation cocatalyst, accelerating surface oxidation reaction and reducing surface charge recombination,53 which could be considered as another reason for the improved PEC performances of ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films. Then, the proposed mechanism of charge transfer as well as band structure of ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 nanorod films are schemed in Fig. 6 to elucidate the positive effects of ZnFe2O4 on the PEC performances. However, after modified with too much ZnFe2O4, the flat-band potential of ZFO-2 shifts anodically by 47 mV indicating that the hole transport from α-Fe2O3 to ZnFe2O4 is blocked, which then results in a decrease in PEC performance.

Conclusions
To conclude, ZnFe2O4 surface treatment on α-Fe2O3 nanorods was reported to be efficient to improve the photoelectrochemical performance. It was revealed that ZnFe2O4 was covered on the top surface of α-Fe2O3 nanorods by a spin-coating process. The photoelectrochemical performance was greatly increased by ZnFe2O4 treatment, with photocurrent density increasing from 0.24 mA cm−2 for the pristine α-Fe2O3 nanorod film to 0.44 mA cm−2 for ZnFe2O4 modified α-Fe2O3 at 0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The photoelectrochemical performance improvement should be due to the increased electron density as well as the catalysis effect of ZnFe2O4 reducing charge recombination and accelerating surface oxidation reaction.
