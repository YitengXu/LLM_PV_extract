    , Accepted 13th September 2013First published on 16th September 2013AbstractNanostructured TiO2 possesses unique optical and physical properties as well as exhibiting quantum confinement effects and has attracted much attention in energy conversion and storage research. The energy related applications of nanostructured TiO2 can be grouped into four main categories: lithium-ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), fuel cells, and super-capacitors. Nanostructured TiO2 with high crystallinity and/or a porous structure exhibits enhanced electron or ion transfer properties, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolytes, and consequently electrochemical processes proceed with high efficiency due to accelerated molecular adsorption. Its unique optical properties lead to improved photovoltaic performance and its bifunctional mechanism produces anti-poisoning effects on catalysts. This review discusses recent scientific and technological advances of nanostructured TiO2 from the perspectives of energy conversion and storage.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has attracted much attention since the discovery of its excellent photocatalytic performance in water splitting when illuminated by ultraviolet (UV) light.1–3 Subsequent development has spurred applications in environmental protection such as air purification4,5 as well as for energy conversion devices like solar cells.6,7 In 1991, O'Regan and Gratzel developed a low-lost and high-efficiency solar cell with a 10 μm thick and optically transparent film composed of nanoscale titanium dioxide particles.8 Since then, there has been extensive research into the energy applications of nanostructured titanium dioxide.9–12 Because the physical and chemical properties change as the size of a titanium dioxide particle shrinks to the nanometer scale, nanostructured TiO2 exhibits the following advantages: photochemical stability, high catalytic efficiency, strong oxidation ability, and nontoxicity.13–20 In addition, owing to the strong surface, volume, quantum, and macroscopic quantum tunneling effects, nanostructured TiO2 delivers unique performance in acoustic, optical, electrical, magnetic, thermal, and other applications.21 In particular, energy conversion and storage involve physical interactions and/or chemical reactions at the interface. In TiO2, which is typically an n-type semiconductor, current can be generated when a photon stimulates the injection of an electron into the conduction band. The movement of electrons and holes is determined by quantum confinement, and hence, the photons are affected by the size and geometry of the materials.10–12 Consequently, the surface area, energy, and chemistry play important roles in energy conversion, and as such, nanostructured TiO2 offers many advantages favoring heat and charge transfer as well as accommodating the dimensional changes associated with chemical reactions and phase transitions. For example, a large surface area provides more sites for charge recombination in DSSCs22,23 and smaller pores limit the penetration of electrolytes in supercapacitors.24,25 Energy conversion or storage devices made of these materials can be produced by facile and controllable processes without secondary pollution.26–30 The applications of nanostructured TiO2 fall into four categories: lithium-ion batteries,31–35 DSSCs,36–41 fuel cells,42–44 and supercapacitors.45,46 In this paper, recent progress in the fabrication and application of nanostructured TiO2 in energy conversion and storage is reviewed and various factors affecting the conversion efficiency are discussed.
2. Nanostructured TiO2 in lithium ion batteries
2.1 Introduction to lithium ion batteries
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are promising energy storage devices in mobile electronics, electric cars, and renewable energy systems operating on intermittent energy sources such as wind and photovoltaics.47 A lithium-ion battery consists of three major components: anode, cathode, and electrolyte. The device functions by converting a chemical potential into electrical energy via Faradaic reactions, which include heterogeneous charge transfer on the surface of the electrode. These reactions are accompanied by mass and charge transfer in the electrodes as well as dimensional variation, and the surface area and migration distance are critical parameters for determining the battery’s performance. The composition, crystal structure, and morphology of the electrodes influence the reaction rate and transfer processes and can be manipulated to alter the overall electrochemical performance.48
The active cathode and anode materials in a typical LIB are LiCoO2 and graphite respectively (Fig. 1).49 They are electrically insulated by a porous polypropylene membrane and an intervening electrolyte of LiPF6 in a mixture of organic solvents (e.g. ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate). During discharge, the potential difference between the anode and cathode drives the Li+ ions from the anode to the cathode internally through the electrolyte. The reverse process occurs during charging.50 The reversibility of the charging and discharging reactions on the electrodes determines the efficacy of the battery. The important performance indicators are capacity, cyclability, and rate capability, which depend on the properties of the active electrode materials. Research and development of economical and efficient energy-storage materials is a hot topic and nanostructured TiO2 has attracted immense interest in this respect.51

2.2 Nanostructured TiO2-based Li-ion batteries
Considering the safety concerning overcharging and the stable voltage plateau at 1.78 V, anatase TiO2, a typical Li-ion intercalation compound, is often used as the negative electrode in Li-ion batteries. The following typical lithium intercalation–deintercalation reaction occurs during the electrochemical process on the TiO2 anode: TiO2 + XLi+ + Xe− = LiXTiO2, (0 ≤ X ≤ 1)(1)
Unfortunately, low electrical conductivity, poor rate capability, and poor cycling performance can be induced by structural changes in the bulk materials during the lithiation process. However, nanostructured TiO2 materials such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods, and nanoparticles can be used to overcome some of the drawbacks of the bulk materials.52–57 Nanostructures with proper size and morphology can enhance the performance of a Li-ion battery, especially in reversible Li ion storage.58 This is because the distance over which Li ions must diffuse in the solid state can be reduced and in comparison with conventional bulk electrodes, the current density in nanostructured TiO2 electrodes is more effective due to their larger surface area.59,60
2.3 Factors affecting TiO2-based LIB performance
Because of its excellent rate capability, good safety, environmental friendliness, and low cost,61–68 nanostructured TiO2 has attracted extensive interest as a potential anode material in high performance LIBs.68 Recently, much attention has been paid to Li insertion, because nanostructured TiO2 not only favors Li ion insertion/extraction at low voltage but it also expedites the process. The anodes are electrochemically stable and not easily passivated upon exposure to a liquid electrolyte in high-power lithium-ion batteries.69–73 However, the morphology and structure of TiO2 affect the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries and these factors are discussed in the following sections.

2.3.1 TiO2 particle size. 
The size effect of TiO2 on electrochemical cycling in lithium-ion batteries has been studied. As the particle size diminishes, the Li storage capability increases due to the larger surface area.74 For example, the discharge capacity of a rutile material with an average particle size of 300 nm (R300) is only 110 mA h g−1, but 378 and 338 mA h g−1 are achieved from particles with sizes of 15 nm (R15) and 30 nm (R30), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, in the R15 rutile electrode, 0.6–0.7 (the Li insertion ratio, Li:Ti) of the Li can be cycled reversibly and the discharging capacities are 132 and 118 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively,74 indicating that the rutile nanoelectrode has a high rate capability.
 Fig. 2  (a) Voltage profiles of rutile TiO2 with different particle sizes (R15, R30, and R300 denote particle sizes of 15 nm, 30 nm, and 300 nm) and (b) capacity versus cycle number in coin-type half cells at a rate of 0.05 A g−1. Reprinted with permission from ref. 74. 
Hu et al. have indicated that nanometer-sized rutile materials have a higher electroactivity in Li insertion than their micrometer-sized counterparts.75 The electrochemical behaviors of rutile materials with different particle size and shape are illustrated in Fig. 3a. At room temperature, for the rutile materials with an average diameter of 10 nm and length of 30–40 nm, up to 0.8 mol of Li can be inserted in the first discharging process and about 0.5 mol of Li can be reversibly inserted/extracted in the subsequent discharging/charging processes. In contrast, only 0.1–0.25 mol of Li can be inserted in the micrometer-sized rutile structure.75 This can be ascribed to slow Li diffusion along the ab-plane of the micrometer-sized rutile structure due to kinetic restrictions. The first discharge curve acquired from the nanometer-sized rutile materials can be divided into three regions. As shown in Fig. 3b, the voltage decreases gradually from 2.4 to 1.45 V in the first region, which is linked to the thermodynamically preferred surface storage of 0.15 mol of Li due to the reduced particle and crystallite size. In region II, a narrow plateau appears at 1.4 V corresponding to 0.35 mol of Li insertion. In region III, further Li insertion results in the formation of small crystal grains, which do not change significantly during the subsequent charging process.

In comparison with the bulk or macro/micrometer-sized materials, nanometer-sized rutile TiO2 possesses excellent cycling capacity and high rate performance, thereby making it suitable for use as the anode in high-power LIBs. There are two reasons for the excellent high rate performance.59,60,74,75 The short Li+ diffusion length and increased specific surface area are obvious factors. In a short discharge–charge time, the diffusion length is the predominant factor determining the Li+ insertion efficiency at high current rates, and a large surface area enhances the storage efficiency. Another possible reason is that because of the large surface area of the nanostructured materials, the small specific current density may also lead to a high rate performance.70


2.3.2 TiO2 structure and morphology. 
Besides the particle size, the structure and morphology of the nanostructured TiO2 influence the electrochemical performance of LIBs, altering the Li insertion capacity, electrochemical stability, and rate capability.76–81 Mesoporous TiO2 has been shown to be a suitable Li insertion electrode material because it can improve the cycling life, rate capability, and high power density of LIBs.77 Wang et al. have developed a low-temperature approach to produce highly crystalline mesoporous rutile TiO2 comprising mainly of interconnected rutile nanorods aligned along the [001] direction.77 Their results show that mesoporous rutile TiO2 with a pore size varying from 2.2 to 3.8 nm has an excellent Li insertion activity (Fig. 4) and can accommodate up to Li0.7TiO2 during the first discharging step and Li0.63TiO2 in the second discharging step. Up to 0.55 Li (Li0.55TiO2, 185 mA h g−1) can be charged and discharged reversibly at a rate of C/5 in the subsequent cycles with excellent capacity retention. The advantage of this mesoporous crystalline rutile structure is that the capacity is retained well with less than 10% capacity loss even after more than 100 cycles. Meanwhile, its mesoporous structure remains stable over the Li+ insertion cycles.

Hierarchical nanostructured rutile TiO2 has been reported to deliver enhanced LIB performance.64,78 Using oxalic acid and TiOSO4 as reagents, Fei et al. have fabricated rutile titania sub-microflowers and microspheres composed of nanorods, by a facile hydrothermal method.78 In comparison with the hierarchical anatase spheres self-assembled from ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets,64 these materials have a similar discharge capacity and cycle stability at the 0.5 C discharge rate and lower discharge capacity at the 1 C discharge rate. Although Chen's work shows that electrodes made of 3 nm rutile titania exhibit long term cycle stability after over 300 cycles with a capacity loss of 0.17 per cycle and a good rate capability up to a 30 C rate, mainly due to there being more lithium insertion sites as a result of the large surface area and short diffusion path,61 the hierarchical rutile microflowers comprising of nanorods have a large discharging capacity at a small discharging rate. That is to say that as well as by changing the nanoparticle size, the performance of LIBs can be adjusted by changing the hierarchical structure of the nanostructured TiO2 because this change can lead to the efficient solid-state diffusion of Li+ as a consequence of the small building blocks.61,62,64,78
By controlling the nano-TiO2 shape the performance of LIBs can be enhanced, and consequently there has been much progress in the synthesis and application of TiO2 nanoparticulates, nanotubes, nanofibers, nanowires, and nanobelts as electrodes.79–86 These materials, which can be synthesized using a simple aqueous technique or electrospinning with a high yield, have diameters of 40 to 60 nm and lengths of up to several micrometers. The TiO2-B polymorph is an excellent intercalation host for Li capable of accommodating up to Li0.91TiO2-B (305 mA h g−1) at 1.5–1.6 V vs. Li+(1 M)/Li and has excellent capacity retention on cycling. As shown by the charging and discharging curves of LixTiO2-B nanowires at the rate of 10 mA g−1 in Fig. 5a, these nanowires have a much better rate capability than the nanoparticles (Fig. 5b).79

(b) Comparison of the cycling behavior of TiO2-B nanowires, TiO2-B nanoparticles, and nanoparticulate anatase at 200 mA g−1. Reprinted with permission from ref. 79. 
Nie et al. have adopted a hydrothermal method to synthesize one-dimensional TiO2-B nanobelts,80 which have a very high reversible intercalation–deintercalation lithium capacity of up to 265 mA h g−1. A similar performance can be achieved from c-axis grown rutile TiO2 nanorod array anodes.81 Dong et al. have fabricated these materials on metallic titanium sheets hydrothermally81 and shown that the reversible electric capacity can reach 133 μA h cm−2 after cycling for fifty times at 15 μA cm−1. The electrical capacity is 10 times larger than that of the normal TiO2 anode, indicating that the nanorod array anode can effectively improve the performance of LIBs.
A simple electrospinning process encompassing post-nitriding has been employed to synthesize TiO2 nanofibers with different structures.83 The nitrided TiO2 hollow nanofibers deliver a rate capability twice that of pristine TiO2 nanofibers at 5 C, which is attributed to the shorter lithium ion diffusion length and high electronic conductivity along the surface of the nitrided hollow nanofibers.83
The different crystalline forms of titanium dioxide also affect the electrochemical performance of TiO2-based LIBs. Ryu et al.'s results reveal that the amorphous TiO2 nanotube electrodes have better rate capability than anatase nanotube electrodes.84 They observe a higher discharge capability of 0.088 mA h cm−2 from the former compared to 0.047 mA h cm−2 for the latter. The difference in the rate capability between the two structures is ascribed to the better reversibility and higher Li+ diffusivity of the former.84
Recent research also confirms that some structures enhance the electrochemical performance of TiO2 electrodes.85,86 For example, the calcined TiO2 flakes (CF-TiO2) prepared by Yang et al. possess a larger reversible charge–discharge capacity as well as a better rate capability and cycling stability than anatase TiO2 nanoparticles.85 The nano-sized grains in these flakes may eliminate the dual phases in a single particle during lithiation, thus improving the cycling performance significantly. The larger surface area provides a larger electrode–electrolyte contact area, shorter solid state path lengths for both Li+ and electron transport, and eventually a better rate capability of the CF-TiO2.85Fig. 6 shows the variation in the specific charge–discharge capacity with respect to the cycle number for CF-TiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles at a constant current density (C/20).85 The yolk–shell nano-architecture has recently been shown to improve the electrochemical performance of sulfur–TiO2.86 An initial specific capacity of 1030 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C and coulombic efficiency of 98.4% over 1000 cycles can be achieved from this electrode and the capacity decay after 1000 cycles is as small as 0.033% per cycle.86 It is believed that the internal void accommodates the volume expansion caused by sulfur during lithiation, consequently producing a complete shell to minimize polysulfide dissolution.86

2.3.3 Doping. 
Doping control is important because the performance of electrode materials can be affected. The doping process can affect the electronic structure of TiO2 altering the electronic,87,88 optical,89,90 photoelectrical,91–93 and electrochemical performance.94 The effects of aliovalent ions on the electrical conductivity are related to the concentration of the electronic charge carriers but the effect on mobility is insignificant.95 Recent research shows that doped TiO2 is a promising anode in lithium-ion batteries.96–98 Nam et al. have prepared metal-nanoparticle-doped one-dimensional titanium dioxide nanofibers (1D-TiO2) by a one-step electrospinning process, in which Au or Ag nanoparticles 5 to 10 nm in diameter are incorporated into the TiO2 nanofibers.97 Because of the altered crystallinity and size of TiO2 in the Ag-doped 1D-TiO2 and Au-doped 1D-TiO2 nanofibers, Li+ diffusion and charge transfer are promoted. In particular, the specific capacity of the electrodes made of the nanoparticle-doped 1D-TiO2 nanofibers increases by at least 20% and the rate performance goes up by a factor of two compared to 1D-TiO2.
A similar process has been adopted by Zhao et al. using carbon as the dopant.98 By means of electrospinning, Zhao et al. have prepared a highly flexible self-standing thin-film electrode composed of mesoporous rutile TiO2–C nanofibers with a low carbon content (<15 wt%). These materials, which can be used directly as electrodes in LIBs without further treatment, deliver outstanding electrochemical performance. As shown in Fig. 7, stable capacities of 122, 108, and 92 mA h g−1 can be reached at rates of 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively. A value of 70 mA h g−1 can be maintained even at a high rate of 10 C and the experimental results confirm that the mesoporous rutile TiO2–C nanofibers have good electrochemical characteristics in lithium-ion batteries.98 Wang et al. have incorporated carbon species into porous TiO2 hollow shells using multiple sol–gel processes followed by carbonization.99 The porous TiO2–C nanocomposites significantly improve the cycling performance in Li ion storage and rate capability up to 10 C.99 Compounds have also been introduced into TiO2 to form TiO2 composites.100–105 These composites including TiO2–graphene nanocomposites,101 mesoporous TiO2–C–Cu composites,102 nanoarchitectured TiO2-B/ACF,103 and FeS–TiO2 nanostructured materials104 enhance the storage rate of TiO2-based LIBs by offering electrons to TiO2.

Cai et al. have prepared TiO2–graphene nanocomposites by a facile gas/liquid interface reaction.101 The TiO2–graphene nanocomposites are promising anode materials for LIBs boasting a high specific capacity and excellent rate performance. Fig. 8 presents the initial discharge–charge curves of the TiO2–graphene nanocomposites and bare TiO2 nanoparticles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V. The specific charge capacity of the TiO2–graphene nanocomposites is much larger than that of the bare TiO2 nanoparticles due to the four following factors: (1) the lithium storage performance of graphene is obtained during the discharge–charge of the TiO2–graphene nanocomposites between 0.01 and 3.0 V; (2) the graphene sheets prevent aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles; (3) graphene facilitates electron transfer; (4) the mesoporous structure can provide a large electrode–electrolyte contract area and short path length for both electron and Li-ion transport.101

The ordered mesoporous TiO2–C composites embedded with Cu nanoparticles (TiO2–C–Cu) have been prepared via an evaporation induced self-assembly method and in situ crystallization.102 The TiO2–C–Cu composites display promising lithium insertion/extraction characteristics as anode materials for LIBs. Fig. 9 shows the cycling performance of TiO2–C and TiO2–C–Cu at 0.5 C. The capacity of TiO2–C decays more quickly than TiO2–C–Cu after the 15th cycle. It is believed that Cu nanoparticles embedded in the composites improve the conductivity significantly and enhance the efficiency of Li+ diffusion and the coulombic efficiency.102

An additive-free flexible film electrode (TiO2-B/ACF) fabricated by anchoring TiO2-B nanosheets on non-woven activated carbon fabric (ACF) has been reported by Liu et al.103 The ultrathin TiO2-B nanosheets expedite lithium storage due to intrinsic open channels, large surface area, and reduced diffusion length. The carbon nanofibers not only allow easy access for ions but also produce electrodes with good conductivity and high mechanical flexibility. As a result, the flexible binder free TiO2-B/ACF electrodes have high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and superior long-term cycling stability.103
An electrode made of anatase TiO2 modified FeS nanowires exhibits an improved reversible capacity of 510 mA h g−1 after 100 discharge–charge cycles at 200 mA g−1, which is much larger than that of the pristine FeS nanostructure electrode.104 Meanwhile, the FeS–TiO2 electrode possesses enhanced rate capability and long-term cycling stability with little performance degradation. This superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the incorporation of anatase TiO2, which increases the conductivity of the integrated electrode and favors lithium insertion/extraction at the electrode/electrolyte interface as well as diffusion of lithium ions.104

2.4 Remarks
Based on the discussions above, nano-structured TiO2 electrode materials improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries. The large surface area of nano-TiO2 materials such as nanosheets and nanotubes enhances the cycling performance of LIBs as a result of better conduction, larger contact area between the materials and electrolyte, shorter Li+ diffusion distance, and stable structure during charging and discharging. Future improvement pertaining to the control of the structure and doping process of TiO2 nanomaterials will improve the conductive ability, lithium power, and cycle life. In summary, nano-TiO2 will likely become the mainstream material in future high-performance lithium-ion batteries.
3. Nanostructured TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
Solar energy is the preferred renewable energy source as the sun delivers to the earth 1.2 × 105 terawatts (TWs) of energy, which exceeds the current energy need of 13 TWs.106 This translates into the idea that by covering only 0.1% of the earth's surface with solar cells with 10% efficiency, our energy needs will be satisfied.107 However, solar energy currently constitutes far below 0.1% of the global energy demand (Fig. 10)108 because of the major obstacles encountered in the production of large-scale solar materials, including cost and efficiency. It is necessary to develop new techniques to capture sunlight more effectively and produce photovoltaic materials more economically.109,110 Since DSSCs are considered to be one of the major types of photovoltaic devices, improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs is of paramount importance.

3.1 Overview of DSSCs
DSSCs have been widely studied by researchers111–115 and Fig. 11 schematically illustrates their structure and operating principles.116 The heart of the device is the nanocrystalline mesoporous oxide film with a thickness of about 10 μm and porosity of 50–60%. It is often made of a network of TiO2 nanoparticles with average diameters between 10 and 30 nm to establish electrical conduction. The mesoporous layer is typically deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) on a glass or plastic substrate and attached to the surface of the nanocrystalline film is a monolayer of the charge-transfer dye. Photo-excitation of the latter induces injection of electrons into the conduction band of the oxide keeping the dye in the oxidized state. The dye returns to the ground state via electron transfer from the electrolyte, which is usually an organic solvent containing a redox system such as the iodide/triiodide couple. During the regeneration of the sensitizer the iodide intercepts the recapture of the conduction band electron by the oxidized dye. The I3− ions formed by the oxidation of I− diffuse over a short distance (<50 μm) through the electrolyte to the cathode that is coated with a thin layer of a platinum catalyst, where the regenerative cycle is completed by electron transfer to reduce I3− to I−.116–119 The device converts light into electrical energy without a permanent chemical reaction.

3.2 Nano-TiO2 in DSSCs
Owing to its large specific surface area, high efficiency, low cost, and flexibility, nanostructured TiO2 holds high promise as an electrode in DSSCs. TiO2 exists in various structures including anatase, rutile, and brookite.120,121 The rutile form is the thermodynamically most stable phase while anatase is the preferred structure in DSSCs, because the bandgap of the latter is 3.2 eV, which is larger than that of rutile (3.0 eV). In addition, the latter has a larger conduction band edge energy than the former, thereby producing a higher Fermi level and Voc for anatase in DSSCs for the same conduction band electron concentration.
Improvements in TiO2 electrodes in DSSCs in terms of light absorption, light scattering, and charge transport, which control the charge recombination and enhance the interfacial energy, are being made. Advanced DSSCs typically employ a mesoporous TiO2 electrode fabricated by the following process. A TiO2 blocking layer (about 50 nm thick) is deposited on a transparent conducting oxide such as FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) to prevent direct contact between the redox mediator in the electrolyte and FTO.122 A light absorption layer composed of a 10 μm thin film of mesoporous TiO2 particles provides a large surface area for sensitizer adsorption and good electron transport to the substrate.121 A light scattering layer is produced on top of the mesoporous film. It consists of a 3 μm thick porous layer consisting of 400 nm TiO2 particles123,124 and finally, an ultrathin overcoating of TiO2 is deposited chemically.114,115
3.3 Factors influencing the conversion efficiency of DSSCs

3.3.1 Preparation processes. 
Substantial progress has been made recently in the synthesis of TiO2 nanostructures using methods such as sol–gel,125–129 hydrothermal,130–132 solvothermal,133–135 sonochemical,136,137 chemical vapor deposition,138,139 and physical vapor deposition.140,141 The conversion efficiency of the DSSCs depends on the fabrication process. Hore et al. have found that alkali-catalyzed conditions produce mesoporous TiO2 with slower interfacial recombination and a higher open circuit voltage, but the quality of dye adsorption is reduced compared to the acid-catalyzed TiO2.142 This has been corroborated by Lee et al.143 who have prepared two types of nano-TiO2 by sol–gel and solvothermal methods. Their results show that the energy conversion efficiency of the TiO2 modified by the latter method is approximately 8.51%, while the value for the former modified TiO2 is only 5.93% under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 of simulated sunlight with N719 as the dye (Fig. 12).143 Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) reveals that the electrons are transferred more rapidly to the surface of the solvothermally modified TiO2 film than the sol–gel modified TiO2 film. This is due to the smaller particles, stronger absorption, and larger red-shift of the TiO2 synthesized by the solvothermal process.

Nanostructured TiO2 not only provides a large internal surface area to the photoelectrode film, but also gives rise to other functions enhancing optical absorption or electron transport.144–146 Besides TiO2 nanoparticles, many other nanostructures such as nanobelts, nanowires/nanorods, nanotubes, hierarchical micro–nanostructures, and core–shell structures of TiO2 have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, the efficiency record of 11–12% for DSSCs is still held by nanocrystalline TiO2 films.147,148
3.3.2.1 Morphology. 
The morphology of nanostructured TiO2 affects the conversion efficiency. Dhas et al. have synthesized anatase TiO2 nanoleaves (NLs) with a large surface area (∼93 m2 g−1) hydrothermally,149 and the performance of DSSCs made with the NLs has been compared to that made of hydrothermal TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and Degussa P25 powder. The DSSCs composed of the NLs boast a higher conversion efficiency (∼5.6%) than those made of NPs (∼4.8%) and P25 (∼4.5%). The highest efficiency (∼6.5%) is achieved from DSSCs composed of mixed NLs and NPs with a ratio of 50:50 (Fig. 13).149 In the NP and NL mixture, the dye loading was more than 50% greater than that for the NP films. Moreover, the DC resistance to diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte is substantially lower. These two aspects are believed to be responsible for the higher efficiency of the former.

3.3.2.2 Lengths of TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). 
TiO2 nanotube arrays are used in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)150 and a larger tube length can enhance both the short-circuit current density and conversion efficiency. The results are summarized in Fig. 14.150 Pan et al. have recently produced a TiO2 nanotube array with ∼10 nm TiO2 nanoparticles by infiltration with a TiCl4 solution by a hydrothermal process.151 Compared to DSSCs made of bare TiO2 nanotubes, these mixed NT and NP structures (8 and 13 μm long) double the dye loading and boost the photocurrent by nearly 100%. This is because of the enhanced photovoltage and filling factor of the structure with a small serial resistance. The overall photon conversion efficiency of the DSSCs made of the NTs is improved by 152%, 107%, and 49% for 8, 13, and 20 μm long NTs, respectively, indicating that TiO2 nanotubes that are too long are not optimal. This is attributed to the small electron collection efficiency induced by electron trapping during transport in the nanotubes.

3.3.2.3 Nanoporous structure. 
A high light-to-energy conversion efficiency has been achieved from DSSCs composed of nanoporous TiO2 electrodes.152 The key is to employ a mesoporous TiO2 electrode, which has a large internal surface area supported by a monolayer of the sensitizer.8 The device absorbs a large proportion of the solar energy (46%) and has an efficiency of over 80% for the conversion of photons to electrical current. The overall light-to-electric energy conversion yields are 7.1–7.9% for simulated solar light and 12% in diffuse daylight. There is strong evidence that the nanoporous TiO2 electrode enhances the energy-conversion efficiency of the DSSCs device.153 In comparison with nano-TiO2, under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight with N719 as the dye, the conversion efficiency of DSSCs made of nanoporous TiO2 increases from 4.23% to 8.71% and the current density rises from 9.60 to 16.66 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 15.153 This can be explained by an adsorption mechanism. In the nanoporous structure, more dye molecules can be absorbed on the nanoporous structured TiO2 than the nano-TiO2 particles and so electrons can be transferred rapidly in the nanoporous TiO2 film.

3.3.2.4 Core–shell structure. 
Core–shell TiO2 electrodes can enhance the performance of DSSCs.154–159 Their structure consists of nanoporous TiO2 covered with a shell of another metal oxide, which possesses the ability to retard the recombination processes by forming an energy barrier at the TiO2 surface.154,155 The conduction band potential of this shell should be more negative than that of TiO2 in order to generate an energy barrier for the reaction between the electrons in TiO2 and the oxidized dye or the redox mediator in the electrolyte.156–158
There are two common techniques used to fabricate nanoporous TiO2 core–shell electrodes.160,161 The first process utilizes ZnO-covered nanocrystalline TiO2 composed of TiO2 cores and zinc oxide shells prepared by the addition of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O into a TiO2 colloid solution followed by annealing.160 An energy barrier forms at the electrode/electrolyte interface and between the individual TiO2 nanoparticles. The second approach involves nanoporous TiO2 as the thin shell, which acts as an energy barrier at the electrode/electrolyte interface to slow the interaction between the electrons in the electrode and electrolyte ions to enhance the conversion efficiency by a factor of 2.2.161
In general, a well-defined core–shell configuration of a nanoporous electrode is usually made of a TiO2 core coated with Nb2O5,154 SiO2,159 ZrO2,159 Al2O3,161–164 or MgO.165 Zaban et al. have discovered that TiO2–Nb2O5 nanoporous electrodes can improve the performance of DSSCs by over 35%.154 A schematic diagram showing the bilayered nanoporous electrodes and the related I–V curves are depicted in Fig. 16A and B, respectively. The three types of core–shell electrodes show better I–V performance than the bare TiO2 anode. By adopting optimized deposition conditions, the photocurrent increases from 10.2 to 11.4 mA cm−2 and the photovoltage rises from 661 to 730 mV, accompanied by an increase in the fill factor from 51.0 to 56.5%. As a result, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell increases by 35% from 3.62% to 4.97%.154 The shell materials sometimes shift the conduction band potential of the core rather than forming an energy barrier. For example, a coating of TiO2 with a SrTiO3 shell produces a shift of the TiO2 conduction band in the negative direction.155,156 Growth of an overlayer of Al2O3 on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film improves the DSSC performance. For instance, a 4-fold retardation of the interfacial charge recombination and 30% improvement in the photovoltaic device efficiency have been observed.164 Diamant et al. have found that nanoporous SrTiO3-coated TiO2 electrodes improve the open circuit photovoltage while reducing the short circuit photocurrent, resulting in a 15% improvement in the DSSC conversion efficiency.155

3.3.3 Metal doping. 
Metal doping in nano-TiO2 improves the conversion efficiency of DSSCs.166–168 It is related to the electrical surface-state modification induced by metal doping. The doping process leads to significant changes in powder aggregation, charge transfer dynamics, and dye adsorption. As reported by Jeong et al., a TiO2 nanocrystalline film used in conventional DSSCs is modified in a AgNO3–EtOH solution to adsorb 3 to 8 nm Ag nanoparticles (Fig. 17).169 Compared to the 7.1% efficiency obtained from the cell without Ag nanoparticles, Ag doping improves the efficiency by 25% (to 8.9%) as a result of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect stemming from the Ag nanoparticles. SPR generated by the metal nanoparticles enhances the optical absorption by the solar cell films by either generating light scattering to prolong the optical pathway or causing a local field enhancement to improve the optical absorption cross-section of the dye.169 The optimal size of Ag nanoparticles is about 19 nm to enhance optical absorption by the dye-sensitized nano-TiO2 film.157 In practice, Ag nanoparticles with a size of over 19 nm may yield a more substantial SPR enhancement but the internal surface area of the photoelectrode film reduces, resulting in less adsorption and a decrease in the overall conversion efficiency.170

Reprinted with permission from ref. 169. 
Su et al. have recently proposed a promising plasmonic solar cell.171 The photoelectrode is composed of TiO2 nanoparticles with 6 nm Au nanoparticles to serve as the sensitizer for light harvesting (Fig. 18a). The optical absorption of the Au-adsorbed TiO2 film is proportional to the amount of adsorbed Au nanoparticles (Fig. 18b). The efficiency of the photoelectrical conversion increases with the amount of Au nanoparticles, from 0.016% for 1 layer of Au nanoparticles to 0.75% for 5 layers of Au nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the short-circuit electrical current increases from 1.076 to 5.192 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. 18c. The photoexcited electrons near the surface of the Au nanoparticles may have enough energy to overcome the Schottky barrier at the Au/TiO2 interface and are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 due to the SPR effect and overlap of the SPR absorption band.171 Al and W doped nano-TiO2 semiconducting powders have been incorporated into the working electrode of the DSSCs.172 Ko et al. have observed that the Al-doped TiO2 electrodes increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) but reduce the short-circuit current (Jsc). On the contrary, W-doped TiO2 shows the opposite effects. The dual Al and W nanoparticle doped TiO2 raises the DSSC efficiency on account of an enhanced photovoltage and photocurrent compared to the undoped one (Fig. 19).172 Ag and Au are the most common metals that are used to enhance the optical absorption by solar cells, because they do not have many interband transitions, which may limit light absorption. Chou et al. have investigated the effects of Ag/Au addition.173 A layer of TiO2–Au (or TiO2–Ag) composite particles is deposited on the FTO-glass substrate of the working electrode of a DSSC. With increasing Au (or Ag) content in the composite particles, the conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC increases. Furthermore, the η values of the DSSCs with a film of TiO2–Au (or TiO2–Ag) on the working electrode always exceed those of the conventional cells because of the Schottky barrier.173

3.4 Remarks
Nanostructured TiO2 can improve the performance of solar cells due to their unique optical and/or electrical properties arising from their special structural characteristics. These optical or electrical properties can be utilized to either increase the optical absorption of the solar cells, or improve the electron transport in the solar cells. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques or processes to optimize the structure, morphology, and photoelectrical conversion capability in order to further enhance the performance of DSSCs.
4. Nanostructured TiO2 in fuel cells
A typical fuel cell is illustrated in Fig. 20.174 According to the different types of electrolytes used, fuel cells can be divided into alkaline fuel cells (AFCs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs), molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs), and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The PEMFCs can further be subcategorized as hydrogen fuel cells and direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). Because no hydrogen production is required by DAFCs, they have good prospects as convenient fuel sources in applications such as portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and chemical power sources. A DAFC is a proton exchange membrane fuel cell utilizing alcohol as the fuel, and theoretically, its specific energy density is larger than that of a LIB.175 In addition, this type of cell has a simple structure, low working temperature, easy way to add fuel, and wider application to portable appliances. Recent research activities have mainly focused on direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) and direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs).176,177

4.1 Nanostructured TiO2 in DAFCs
The slow kinetics and catalyst poisoning effect induced by CO have hampered the wide acceptance of DAFCs, but with a better understanding of the bifunctional mechanism, advanced electro-catalysts may solve these problems. Succinctly speaking, a second component like Ru can expedite the oxidation of CO to CO2 and adsorb oxygen-containing species near the poisoned Pt sites.163,164 It has been observed that transition metal oxides such as CeO2, ZrO2, and TiO2 enhance the electro oxidation of alcohol on the surface of Pt and their good stability has caught the eyes of many researchers.178–180 In fact, owing to its excellent photocatalytic ability, non-toxicity, and low price, TiO2 is widely used in fuel cells and various forms of nano-TiO2 are used as co-anode catalysts in DAFCs.181–185

4.1.1 Nanostructured TiO2 as a catalyst carrier. 
Its high stability and resistance to acids and alkalis in conjunction with its large surface area render nanostructured TiO2 a potential catalyst carrier. According to the bifunctional mechanism, the adsorbed hydroxyl groups on the oxide surface are transferred to the adjacent precious metal catalyst, thus accelerating the oxidation of these species and circumventing the catalyst poisoning effects. The active sites of the catalyst are thus released and the catalytic performance is improved.186 The different forms of nano-TiO2, for instance, nanotubes, nanorods, and nanobelts, influence the transfer effects. Guo et al. have used porous TiO2 nanorods as carriers to obtain a new type of Pt/TiO2 catalyst.187 The Pt nanoparticles are uniformly loaded on the porous TiO2 nanorods and the Pt/TiO2 catalyst retains the porous structure which benefits the mass transfer during the methanol electro oxidation. Pd nanoparticles can also be scattered on the surface of TiO2 nanotubes and used as a catalyst for methanol oxidation,188 and compared to the use of pure Pd, this dispersion of Pd on TiO2 nanotubes yields a better catalytic performance.


4.1.2 TiO2 composite materials as the catalyst carrier. 
A good catalyst carrier in DAFCs requires not only good electrical conductivity, but also good proton performance.189 A TiO2–C composite carrier can satisfy these two requirements. Shim et al. have synthesized a Pt–TiO2–C catalyst190 and found that the performance of the composite catalyst is better than that of a Pt catalyst without TiO2. Cyclic voltammograms reveal that the electrochemically active area on the Pt–TiO2–C catalyst increases significantly. On account of oxidation, the ability of Pt to adsorb hydrogen and oxygen weakens. The catalytic improvement can be attributed to the interface between the Pt and oxide as well as the synergistic effects produced by the spread of the middle interface. Xiong et al. have fabricated a TiOx/Pt/C catalyst191 and both the synthesis method and subsequent heat treatment affect the catalytic activity. The TiOx/Pt/C catalyst exhibits a higher catalytic activity and methanol resistance than the Pt/C catalyst because of the larger electrochemically active area, change of electronic properties, and enhanced resistance to methanol permeation.191,192 Chen et al. have observed that addition of TiO2 to the catalyst substrate benefits the dispersion of the Pt and Ru atoms on the cluster surface. The morphology of the catalyst is thus altered enabling dispersion of the catalyst in carbon.193 By changing the TiO2 content in the catalyst, the nanostructure can be tuned.193 Mixed TiO2 nanotubes have been incorporated into a Pt/C catalyst using an aqueous solution method to control ethanol electro oxidation.194 Song et al. have observed that TiO2 nanotubes enhance the utilization rate of Pt and the activity of the ethanol oxidation. CO stripping experiments reveal that the TiO2 nanotubes reduce the CO oxidation peak potential and promote ethanol oxidation.194 Further experiments disclosed that water in the TiO2 nanotubes plays an important role in the improvement of the co-catalytic properties.195

4.2 Photocatalytic properties of TiO2 in DMFC applications
A hybrid carbon fiber electrode comprising of a TiO2 semiconductor photocatalyst and Pt–Ru catalyst has been developed to boost the performance of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) as shown in Fig. 21.196 TiO2 can improve the performance of the Pt–Ru catalyst in darkness. Incorporation of this photocatalyst provides a new way to minimize the content of the precious metal and enhance the performance of DMFCs. At a low catalyst loading of 0.15 mg cm−2 at 295 K, a 25% enhancement in the peak power density is attained during light illumination. Park et al. have used Pt and TiO2 targets to produce nanostructured Pt–TiO2 electrodes with sputter deposition.197 The efficiency of methanol oxidation is improved by 30% in the presence of ultraviolet light compared to the situation without light. This is ascribed to the photo-produced holes in TiO2 under UV light illumination resulting in enhanced oxidation of methanol. Chu et al. have fabricated a nanoporous TiO2 membrane based anode catalyst by the sol–gel method.198 Pt/Ni/Ru nanoparticles (atomic ratio = 1:1:1) are deposited onto the TiO2 nanoporous membrane by electrodeposition. By using the Pt–Ni–Ru/TiO2 catalyst, the current density of ethanol oxidation is 2.5 times higher with sunlight compared to that without light due to the large number of stimulated photo-produced holes in this catalyst.198

5. Nanostructured TiO2 in supercapacitors
5.1 Introduction to supercapacitors
As energy storage devices, supercapacitors have attracted growing interests in recent years.199–204 According to the mechanism governing charge storage, supercapacitors can be classified as electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) that are based on electrostatic charge diffusion and accumulation at the electrode–electrolyte interface and pseudocapacitors that are dominated by Faradaic reactions on the electrodes.205–207 The limited charge accumulation in the electrical double layer restricts the specific capacitance of EDLCs in a relatively small range between 90 and 250 F g−1. On the contrary, pseudocapacitors made of metal oxides or conducting polymers have higher specific capacitances of 300–1200 F g−1via surface redox reactions.208–214
There are two common ways to enhance the electrochemical capacitance and stability of an electrode. The first way is to adopt a nanostructured electrode with a very large effective area. It has been demonstrated that nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanosheets, and mesoporous nanostructures have higher specific capacitances than their bulk counterparts.211–218 The second technique is to increase the electrical conductivity of the electrode by introducing conductive materials. For example, carbon materials as excellent electrical conductors have been used to form composites with metal oxide electrodes.217–220 Recently, nanostructured TiO2 has been used to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes due to the semiconducting properties, large accessible surface, and long-term chemical stability.221–226
5.2 Approaches to enhance electrochemical performance

5.2.1 Nanostructured TiO2 electrodes. 
Besides its excellent semiconducting properties, nanostructured TiO2 boasts nanoscale dimensions with a highly defined geometry and large surface area. It is thus suitable for electrochemical capacitors. Salari et al. have synthesized self-organized TiO2 nanotubes and nanocrystalline TiO2 powders221,225 and the aligned TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NT) fabricated on the Ti substrate serve as the working electrode. The electrode shows exceptionally high values compared to the conventional TiO2 electrode in supercapacitor applications.


5.2.2 Composite TiO2 nanotubes as electrodes. 
TiO2 nanotube arrays possess distinct advantages such as the provision of rigid tubular channels as well as a large number of active surface sites for redox reactions, ion diffusion, and charge transfer. These benefits, which have been discussed from the perspectives of rechargeable lithium batteries also apply to electrochemical supercapacitors.227 Incorporation of TiO2 nanotubes into metallic oxides or hydrous oxides can improve the performance of these compounds because of the better dispersion of the metal oxides or hydrous oxides and subsequently have better utilization. Wang et al. have used TiO2 nanotubes as a solid support to disperse metal oxides.228,229 A new composite composed of Co(OH)2 and TiO2 nanotubes has been synthesized by chemical precipitation230 and the electrochemical capacitance determined by cyclic voltammetry and charging–discharging tests shows a maximum specific value of 229 F g−1. The TiO2 nanotubes supply a three-dimensional network for the composite enabling the homogeneous dispersion of Co(OH)2 resulting in enhanced utilization.230 Superior capacitance performance and larger energy density can be achieved from tailored NiO–TiO2/Ti composites based on the encapsulation and microstructure modification of electroactive NiO.231 Electroactive NiO incorporated into TiO2 nanotubes grows from the inner wall to the top surface leaving an open pore mouth. The flower-like nanocomposite retains 92.3% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles and shows a good stability in the continuous charging–discharging process, as shown in Fig. 22.231 This superior energy storage performance can be attributed to the highly accessible redox reaction sites on the three-dimensional NiO on the TiO2 nanotubes.231

6. Conclusion and outlook
This review summarizes recent progress pertaining to the use of nanostructured TiO2 in four important energy-related applications: lithium-ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), fuel cells, and supercapacitors. Nanostructured TiO2 enhances the performance of these devices due to its unique geometrical characteristics as well as its optical and electronic properties. Although the benefits of TiO2 nanomaterials have been extensively reported, more insightful understanding of the relationship between the performance of energy-conversion/storage devices and the TiO2 nanostructure is needed and must be studied further. New mechanisms associated with the TiO2 nanostructure will be discovered and the knowledge will increase optical absorption properties while reducing charge recombination. At the same time, it is important to develop new structures. For example, in lithium-ion batteries, optimized structures can lead to more efficient intercalation–deintercalation and cycling stability of Li ions simultaneously. With regard to supercapacitors, TiO2-based composite materials can deliver a high storage density at a low cost. All in all, in energy conversion/storage applications, the synthesis of appropriate nanomaterials continues to pose challenges because the device performance is related to the specific characteristics of the nanostructured TiO2 such as surface morphology, structure, and surface chemistry.
