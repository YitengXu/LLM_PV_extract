    , Accepted 23rd October 2016First published on 8th November 2016AbstractSolution-processible ZnO nanoparticles prepared using the sol–gel method are promising cathode interfacial materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs), but always suffer from trap-induced surface charge recombination and thickness-dependent charge collection. Herein, solution-processible gallium-doped ZnO (GZO) nanoparticles are prepared via the facile sol–gel process. The photophysical experiment discloses that Ga doping reduces the surface deep traps of the resultant GZO nanoparticles. The single-junction PSCs employing the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM blends as the active layers and the optimized GZO nanoparticles as the cathode interfacial layers have achieved PCEs of 9.83% and 7.34%, respectively, higher than those (8.69% and 6.37%) of the corresponding control devices using pure ZnO nanoparticles as the cathode interfacial layers. Moreover, the PSCs show almost unchanged photovoltaic performance with the GZO layer thickness increased up to ca. 100 nm. The enhanced photovoltaic performance originated from the suppressed interfacial charge recombination and effective charge extraction due to partial passivation of surface deep trap states in GZO nanoparticles. This is the first report using Ga-doped ZnO as the interfacial layer to prepare high-efficiency PSCs and the enhanced device performance make it a promising cathode interfacial material in practical large-scale manufacturing of PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted continuous attention as a kind of promising photovoltaic technology due to their unique features including light-weight, flexibility, low-temperature and large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing, etc.1,2 Substantial achievement has been made with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% for single-junction BHJ PSCs profiting from the development of novel photoactive and interfacial materials.3–6 Introduction of suitable interfacial layers between the electrodes and the photoactive BHJ layer is able to improve photogenerated charge carrier extraction and suppress possible charge recombination, and hence increase the PCE of the PSCs.7,8 Based on this consideration, various kinds of interfacial layers have been attempted in PSCs including conjugated polymers, transition metal oxides and hybrid materials, etc.9–18 Among various cathode interfacial layers, solution-processible ZnO nanoparticles have been widely used in PSCs due to their intrinsic advantages, such as high transparency in the visible region, environmental stability, solution-processibility and low-cost.19–23 In addition, the inherent high electron mobility of crystalline ZnO nanoparticles allows them to be used as thick interfacial layers which are highly required in printed manufacturing of PSCs. However, it has been found that the surface deep traps on ZnO nanoparticles may result in charge recombination and limit the photovoltaic performance enhancement of the resultant devices.21,24,25 Some efforts have been made in passivating surface deep traps of the ZnO interfacial layer to improve the photovoltaic performance. For example, ultra-violet light soaking, self-assembled monolayer modification and surface modification with conjugated polymers, insulating polyelectrolyte and ethanolamine have been developed to passivate the ZnO surface deep traps.24–30 The reduced interfacial charge recombination and improved electron extraction have boosted the photovoltaic performance. On the other hand, interior doping of ZnO nanoparticles is an alternative to restrain surface charge recombination and improve electron extraction. The doping of main group-III elements is an effective approach to passivate ZnO surface traps since the doped main group-III elements can replace Zn sites and serve as n-type dopants to generate free electrons.31 Aluminum has been doped to passivate the surface deep traps of ZnO nanoparticles due to its strongly amphiphilic feature.32–34 Gallium (Ga) is also an effective n-type dopant to passivate the surface deep traps, but few attempts are reported and these methods still require relatively high temperature annealing.35,36
Herein, a series of Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) nanoparticles are prepared via the facile wet chemistry method at a mild temperature. Detailed studies disclose that Ga doping in ZnO nanoparticles restrains to the surface deep traps and enhances the electron-transport capability. The solution-processible GZO nanoparticles are successfully used as cathode interfacial layers to fabricate high-efficiency PSCs without any further post treatment such as thermal annealing. The PSCs employing GZO nanoparticles as the cathode interfacial layers exhibit excellent charge extraction and low charge recombination compared to the control devices with pure ZnO nanoparticles as buffer layers. Consequently, both the fill factor (FF) and short-current density (JSC) of the PSCs are improved. For example, the PCE of the conventional PSCs based on the poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blend is improved from 8.69% to 9.83% with FF increased from 62.57% to 67.23% and JSC increased from 17.80 mA cm−2 to 18.99 mA cm−2, respectively. The PCE of PSCs based on the poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):PC71BM blend is also increased from 6.37% to 7.34% with the optimized GZO to replace ZnO nanoparticles. This work provides an easy-accessible Ga-doped ZnO nanoparticle that is promising for replacing commonly used ZnO as the cathode interfacial layer in printed PSCs.
Experimental section
Synthesis of pure ZnO and GZO NPs
Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) were individually dissolved in methanol to form clear solution. Gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) was added into the zinc acetate solution according to the pre-set Ga/Zn feed ratio while the total concentration of the mixture solution was kept at 0.01 M. The mixture solution (0.01 M, 120 mL) was heated at 60–67 °C and then the KOH solution (0.02 M, 60 mL) was added dropwise into the mixture solution. The mixture solution was kept at 60–67 °C depending on the pre-set Ga/Zn feed ratio and was stirred for about 3.5 h. The resultant products were collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol three times. The final products were dissolved in 1-butanol with different concentrations for use. Pure ZnO nanoparticles were also synthesized using the same procedure without adding gallium nitrate.21
Pure ZnO and GZO NP characterization
Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was performed using a Thermo Scientific iCAP6300 to determine the Ga content in GZO nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ZnO and GZO NPs were recorded using a FEI TECNAI F20 system operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Absorption spectra were collected using an Agilent Cary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a HITACHI F-4600 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 using monochromatized Al Kα (hν = 1486.8 eV) excitation. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was carried out under helium discharge lamp excitation (21.2 eV) and the samples were biased at −10 V to separate the sample and the secondary edge for the analyzer. The topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the pure ZnO and GZO NP films on the active layer were taken on a SPA-300HV instrument with a SPI3800N Controller in the tapping mode.
Fabrication and measurement of PSCs
PSCs with a conventional structure were fabricated. The ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω □−1 were subjected to a routine cleaning procedure with ultrasonication in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and de-ionized water sequentially. The cleaned ITO substrates were dried in an oven at 130 °C for 1 h and subsequently were treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. A 30 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS (Baytron Al 4083) layer was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates and was annealed in an oven at 140 °C for 30 min. The substrates were then transferred into a N2-filled glove box to spin-coat the active layers and the cathode interfacial layers. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM or PCDTBT:PC71BM blends were used as active layers. The chlorobenzene (CB):1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) (97/3, v/v) solution containing the PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5 in weight) blend in 10 mg mL−1 was spincoated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a 240 nm-thick PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer. The 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution containing the PCDTBT:PC71BM (1:4 in weight) blend in 4 mg mL−1 was spincoated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce a 220 nm-thick PCDTBT:PC71BM layer. The active layers were aged for 45 min and annealed at 50 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the samples were spin-rinsed with methanol. The pure ZnO or GZO layers were deposited via spin-coating from their 1-butanol solution and their thickness was adjusted by changing the concentration and spin-coating rates. Finally, an Al cathode (100 nm) was thermally deposited in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 3.5 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of each cell was ca. 0.08 cm2 defined by the overlapping area of ITO and the Al cathode. The thickness of the various layers was measured using a Dektak 6M Stylus Profiler. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A Newport solar simulator with an AM1.5G filter was used to provide 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar light for illumination of the solar cells. The light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon diode with a KG-5 visible color filter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed on an Enlitech QE-R spectral response measurement system under short-circuit conditions.
Results and discussion
The final contents of Ga ions in GZO nanoparticles prepared with various Ga/Zn feed ratios are determined by the ICP-AES method. The ICP-AES results of a series of GZO nanoparticles are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). With the initial Ga/Zn feed ratios of 0.5%, 1%, 3% and 5%, the detected Ga/Zn ratios correspond to 0.31%, 0.51%, 1.43% and 2.48%, respectively. These results indicate that the Ga ions are readily doped into the ZnO nanoparticles and their concentration can be effectively tuned by varying the initial metal ratio. The different GZO nanoparticles are denoted by their initial metal ratios for convenience. The TEM images of pure ZnO and a series of GZO nanoparticles are displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). All prepared ZnO and GZO nanoparticles are rather monodisperse, with an average diameter of about 4.5 nm for ZnO and a slightly decreased one of 3.7 nm for all GZO nanoparticles. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure ZnO and GZO nanoparticles in the film are plotted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The absorption peaks are similar for all the samples, and the optical band gap (Eg) is calculated to be 3.41–3.44 eV based on Tau'c formula. The XRD patterns of the prepared ZnO and GZO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1(a). The ZnO and GZO nanoparticles are crystalline and are indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite structure. It is noted that Ga doping in ZnO nanoparticles does not break the crystal structure of ZnO since it shows the same XRD pattern. A slight variation in the relative intensity of the (002) diffraction peak and broadening for all peaks are observed for GZO samples, which could be assigned to the reduced crystal size due to the doping of Ga ions in the resultant GZO.37 XPS is employed to further investigate the surface elemental composition of ZnO and GZO nanoparticles. Fig. S3(a–j) in the ESI† shows the Zn 2p3/2 (a–e) and O 1s (f–j) peaks of the corresponding samples, which are deconvoluted with the Gaussian–Lorentzian function. Zn 2p3/2 XPS spectra demonstrate only one oxidation state Zn2+ in all the samples. The O 1s XPS spectra were fitted into two peaks at 530 eV and 531.48 eV, which are assigned to the Zn–O band and hydroxyl groups bonded to the metal atoms.24,38 The Ga 2p XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 1(b). The intensity of Ga 2p peaks gradually increased upon increasing the initial Ga/ZnO feed ratio, which is consistent with the ICP-AES results.

The possible changes in the effective work function (WF) of the GZO nanoparticles caused by Ga doping are studied by UPS measurement and the UPS spectra are plotted in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Although the Ga content is different in the GZO samples, the effective WF of the ZnO and GZO samples is about −3.84 eV. The AFM images of the obtained ZnO and GZO nanoparticles spin coated atop the active layers are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The surface morphologies of the ZnO and GZO films are similar. The root mean square (RMS) value of pure ZnO films is about 4.24 nm, while the RMS values of different GZO films are in the range of 3.33–3.72 nm. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of all the samples are characterized to shed light on the changes in surface defects in GZO nanoparticles and the results are displayed in Fig. 2. The unique emission peaks at 417 and 434 nm can be attributed to the shallow defects, while the wide band emission from 450 to 600 nm for ZnO nanoparticles can be ascribed to the deep defects.39 The blue emission is generally assigned to the Zn interstitial, H interstitial or Zn interstitial-related complex defects. These shallow donors can contribute significantly to the conductivity.39–41 The green-yellow emission originated from the oxygen vacancies of ZnO nanoparticles, which would trap charges and result in charge recombination in PSCs.20,24,42,43 As revealed in Fig. 2, the pure ZnO nanoparticles possess a high density of deep defects. With the incorporation of Ga ions into ZnO nanoparticles, the emission from oxygen vacancies gradually decreased and finally disappeared in the 5% GZO sample. It indicates that the deep defects are effectively suppressed by doping Ga in ZnO nanoparticles. The possible changes in the surface defects for ZnO and GZO nanoparticles with different Ga-doping concentrations are illustrated in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

The effects of ZnO and GZO interfacial layers on the photovoltaic performance are investigated in single-junction PSCs with a conventional device configuration. The active materials and device structure are shown in Fig. 3. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs are fabricated with the active layer thickness being fixed at ca. 240 nm. The illuminated J–V curves of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with pure ZnO and GZO nanoparticles as the cathode interfacial layers (37 nm) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The detailed photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding PSCs are summarized in Table 1. More than 25 devices were fabricated for each type of device in order to obtain reproducible results. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with pure ZnO interfacial layers demonstrate an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.78 V, a JSC of 17.80 mA cm−2, and a FF of 62.57%, resulting in a PCE of 8.69%. When the GZO nanoparticles are used to replace pure ZnO as the cathode interfacial layer, the corresponding PSCs exhibit improved photovoltaic performance with their PCEs increasing to 9.67–9.83%. The increased PCE of the PSCs employing the GZO interfacial layer benefits mainly from the increased JSC and FF. The PSC employing a 3% GZO interfacial layer demonstrates a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 18.99 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.23%, leading to the highest PCE of 9.83%. The EQE curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 4(b). All the devices using ZnO and a series of GZO buffer layers show high quantum efficiencies at the range of 350–750 nm. Upon replacing GZO nanoparticles with ZnO nanoparticles, the EQEs are further increased with the maximum value up to 80%. The calculated JSCs from EQE curves are given in Table 1, which are consistent with the measured JSCs with an error less than 2%.

The charge extraction capability of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs employing ZnO or GZO cathode buffer layers is investigated via the photocurrent density (Jph) dependence on the effective bias voltage (Veff). Typically, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD stand for the current density under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is determined using Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when the photocurrent is zero, and Vbias is the applied external voltage.44 The relationship between Jph and Veff could reflect the status of photocurrent extraction in PSCs. Fig. 5(a) shows the Jph dependence on Veff for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with 37 nm-thick ZnO or GZO cathode buffer layers. Jph reaches a saturated region (19.4 mA cm−2) for all the devices at above 2 V, where all photogenerated holes and electrons are extracted to the respective electrodes without recombination. In the region below 1 V, Jph is strongly dependent on Veff since the photogenerated charge carrier extraction would compete with the charge recombination due to low internal electric field. It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that a sudden change in Jph occurs at about 0.25 V for the PSC with a ZnO interfacial layer while it occurs at only about 0.16 V for the PSCs with GZO interfacial layers. This result indicates that the PSCs employing the GZO interfacial layers demonstrate stronger charge extraction capability than the PSCs with ZnO interfacial layers at a low internal electric field. The enhanced charge extraction can be attributed to the replacement of GZO to ZnO as the interfacial layer since other device conditions are the same. The electron-only devices with a structure of glass/ITO/ZnO or GZO (47 nm)/Al are fabricated to estimate the electron-transport properties of ZnO or GZO nanoparticles and the dark I–V curves of these devices are plotted in Fig. 5(b). All devices exhibit ohmic behavior. The GZO-based devices show lower resistances than that of the ZnO-based device due to enhanced charge transport in the GZO layers. The I–V characteristics of these devices under illumination are also characterized to further clarify it and the results are displayed in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The ZnO-based device shows more obvious photo-induced conductivity as compared to the GZO-based devices. It is inferred that the deep traps in ZnO nanoparticles are passivated with light soaking and the conductivity is enhanced. In the case of GZO nanoparticles, as we discussed above, the deep defects are suppressed with Ga doping and the GZO-based devices show weak photo-induced conductivity enhancement. Thus, the reduced deep traps and enhanced electron-transporting capability of GZO nanoparticles favor suppression of possible interfacial recombination and improvement of charge extraction.

A thickness-insensitive interfacial layer is rather crucial for PSCs in view of its further commercialization.21 It should be able to be processed by the roll-to-roll large-scale processing technique without deteriorating remarkably the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We have fabricated a set of PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs employing the 3% GZO interfacial layer with its thickness increasing from 15 nm to 96 nm. The illuminated J–V curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 6 and the variations of detailed photovoltaic parameters are plotted in Fig. S8 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 6, these PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs exhibit very similar J–V characteristics with the GZO thickness varying from 15 to 96 nm. The JSC values of these PSCs are varied from 17.29 to 19 mA cm−2 and the FFs are 64.06–65.75%. The PCEs of these PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs are changed from 8.82% to 9.73%. The slightly changed FF indicates efficient charge extraction even if the 3% GZO layer thickness is increased up to 96 nm.45–47

The validity of the GZO nanoparticles as cathode interfacial layers in other photovoltaic systems is also evaluated. The PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs using the ZnO and GZO interfacial layers have been fabricated. The illuminated J–V and EQE curves of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs exhibit a similar trend to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs when a series of GZO nanoparticles are used to replace ZnO nanoparticles as cathode interfacial layers. The PCDTBT:PC71BM PSC with a ZnO interfacial layer shows a VOC of 0.90 V, a JSC of 13.05 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.27%, respectively, resulting in a PCE of 6.37%. Upon replacing GZO with ZnO as the interfacial layer, the VOC values of the resultant devices remain unchanged, but the JSC values increased to 13.49–13.68 mA cm−2 and the FF values increased to 58.93–59.47%. Finally, the PCEs of the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs with GZO interfacial layers are remarkably increased to 7.26–7.34%. As shown in Fig. 7(b), all the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs with ZnO and GZO interfacial layers demonstrate high EQEs over 70%. Upon replacing GZO with ZnO as the cathode interfacial layer, the peak EQE of the devices is increased to over 80%. The calculated JSC from EQE curves given in Table S2 (ESI†) are consistent with the measured values with an error less than 2%. As discussed above, although the deep defects are gradually reduced upon increasing the concentration of Ga in GZO nanoparticles, the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices is not further enhanced. It implies that small amounts of deep defects in GZO do not influence obviously the final photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices.

Conclusions
In summary, a kind of solution-processible Ga-doped ZnO nanoparticles is prepared via a facile sol–gel process. Introduction of small numbers of Ga ions in crystalline ZnO nanoparticles effectively reduces the deep-level traps. The single-junction PSCs employing PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PC71BM as the active layers and the optimized GZO nanoparticles as cathode interfacial layers have achieved PCEs of 9.83% and 7.34%, respectively, higher than those (8.69% and 6.37%) of the corresponding control devices using pure ZnO nanoparticles as the cathode interfacial layers. Moreover, the PSCs show slightly changed photovoltaic performance with the GZO layer thickness increased up to 96 nm. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is attributed to the partial passivation of deep trap states and improved electron extraction of the GZO buffer layer in comparison with the ZnO counterpart. This is the first report using Ga-doped ZnO as the interfacial layer to prepare high-efficiency PSCs and the enhanced device performance makes it a promising cathode interfacial material in practical large-scale manufacturing of PSCs.
