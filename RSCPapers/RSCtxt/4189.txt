    , Accepted 27th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractMethanol production based on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is one possible method for synthesizing electrofuels (e-fuels). A multi-electron system for reducing CO2 to methanol using multi-biocatalysts and an artificial cofactor has attracted significant attention. For example, using formate, formaldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase, CO2 is electrochemically reduced to methanol via formate and formaldehyde intermediates, with the rapid reduction of formate to formaldehyde being a particularly important step. Here, we developed a system for the electrochemical production of formaldehyde from formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FldDH; EC.1.2.1.46) using methylviologen (MV2+) as an artificial cofactor. Application of a single-electron reduction potential of MV2+ (−700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl electrode) to electrolyte containing formate and FldDH resulted in formaldehyde production, and this production improved as the pH of the electrolytic solution increased. The maximum conversion yield for formaldehyde production was 1.1%, achieved at pH 10.3 after 3 h continuous application of an external electrochemical bias. Thus, the electrochemical formaldehyde production efficiency catalyzed by FldDH with MV2+ as an electron mediator was determined for the first time. Furthermore, the interaction between the substrate binding site of FldDH and the cation radical of MV2+ was predicted by docking simulation, providing insights into the electrochemical formate reduction process. Since the reduction of formate catalyzed by FldDH to formaldehyde is a two-electron reduction process, two molecules of cation radical of MV2+ are required. There is insufficient space in the substrate binding pocket of FldDH for two molecules of the MV2+ radical cation and thus the re-reduction of MV2+ bound to FldDH is an important process. Our findings indicate that efficient electron injection from the electrode into MV2+ bound to FldDH is a key process in formate reduction, an important step towards the reduction of CO2 to methanol.
Introduction
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the major cause of global warming and thus efforts to reduce CO2 levels have recently increased globally.1–3 Various CO2 utilization technologies (CCU) have attracted significant attention,4–10 with electrofuels, commonly known as “e-fuels”, being a promising next-generation fuel.11,12 E-fuels are an emerging class of carbon-neutral replacement fuels produced by storing electrical energy from renewable sources in the chemical bonds of liquid or gas fuels. E-fuels can be synthesized using hydrogen produced by surplus electricity and CO2 as raw materials. In addition, a method of directly electrochemically converting CO2 into a liquid fuel such as methanol using surplus electric power has been widely studied.13–16 Copper electrodes are typically used in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C1 and C2 compounds, but selectivity for the target product remains an outstanding key issue. Selectivity for methanol production via electrochemical CO2 reduction can be achieved using a biocatalyst with excellent reaction specificity. For example, NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FldDH) and alcohol (ADH) dehydrogenase reduce CO2 to methanol via formate and formaldehyde by the electrochemical cofactor NAD+/NADH redox couple, as shown in Fig. 1.17,18
 Fig. 1  Electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol with FDH, FldDH and ADH using NAD+/NADH redox couple. 
However, the NAD dimer (NAD)2 is formed instead of enzyme-active NADH by single-electron reduced NAD+ in the electrochemical process, also as shown in Fig. 1.19–23 (NAD)2 is thus an enzyme-inactive cofactor for these dehydrogenases. To avoid the formation of (NAD)2, the electrochemical NAD+ reduction to NADH via ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) with methylviologen (MV2+) as an electron mediator has been suggested. Even if the electrochemical NAD+ reduction to NADH could be accomplished, the affinity between NADH and dehydrogenase does not change, thus, biocatalytic activity cannot be controlled in the electrochemical system using NAD+/NADH redox coupling. As FNR is a very expensive biocatalyst, in addition, a method has been devised to directly act the redox of MV2+ on the biocatalyst. Furthermore, the electrochemical system using only MV2+ redox is simpler than that using FNR/NAD+ system.
Several studies on systems that use an artificial cofactor such as MV2+ for biocatalysts instead of NAD+ have shown that single-electron reduced MV2+ (cation radical form: MVr+) acts as a cofactor for some NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases.24–26 MV2+ is reportedly easily reduced to MVi+ by using a visible light-driven redox system consisting of an electron donor and a photosensitizer. We previously reported a visible light-driven redox system for CO2 reduction to methanol by linking the single-electron photoreduction of MV2+ with water-soluble zinc porphyrin (zinc tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate: ZnTPPS); these three biocatalysts are shown in Fig. 2(a).27–29 In this system, MVt+ functions as a cofactor for the biocatalysts FDH, FldDH and ADH. By hybridizing several biocatalyst and photosensitizing molecules, CO2 is reduced to methanol by visible light energy, making it a possible CCU technology using renewable energy.
 Fig. 2  Visible-light driven CO2 reduction to methanol with the system of triethanolamine (TEOA), ZnTPPS, MV2+, FDH, FldDH and ADH (a) and electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol with the system of MV2+, FDH, FldDH and ADH (b). 
However, improvements are required, including the need for an electron donor such as triethanol amine (a sacrificial reducing agent), and improved efficiency of each step of the dehydrogenase cascade (FDH, FldDH and ADH) for the single-electron photoreduction of MV2+. One possible solution for CO2 reduction to methanol involves linking the electrochemical reduction of MV2+ and biocatalysis, which is simpler than the visible light-driven redox system, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
In the future, the use of a solar cell as a power source will allow simpler visible light energy-driven CO2 reduction to methanol compared to the visible light-driven redox system shown in Fig. 2(a). However, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol using a system comprising MV2+, FDH, FldDH and ADH, shown in Fig. 2(b), remains problematic because NADH and MV˙+ are common electron mediators for the three dehydrogenases, resulting in competition by the hydrogenases for the common electron mediators. Furthermore, there is a large difference in the optimum pH of the three dehydrogenases. For example, the optimum pH of the FDH-catalyzed reduction of CO2 to formate is 6.0 to 6.5,30–33 whereas the optimum pH of FldDH and ADH is above 7.0.34–39 It is therefore necessary to optimize each electrochemical system involving the three dehydrogenases and then ligate each system into a cascade. To our knowledge, no intermediate in formate or formaldehyde production in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol, shown in Fig. 1, has been reported, and there are no examples of individual electrochemical reduction processes catalyzed by FDH, FldDH or ADH, except for the reduction of CO2 to formate by FDH. As a result, details such as the reaction efficiency of the process involving FldDH and ADH in the electrochemical reduction system shown in Fig. 1 and 2(b) remain unknown. In addition, the prediction of direct interactions between electron mediators such as MV˙+ and NADH and these dehydrogenases are important in electrochemical reduction systems.
In this work, the electrocatalytic reduction of formate to formaldehyde with FldDH using MV2+ as an artificial cofactor was developed, as shown in Fig. 3, as a step towards CO2 reduction to methanol. Furthermore, the mode of MV2+ or the cation radical of MV2+ binding to the substrate binding site of FldDH was predicted by docking simulation, allowing us to discuss the electrochemical formate reduction process.

Experimental
Materials
FldDH (EC.1.2.1.46; code: FDH-65-01) was purchased from Thermostable Enzyme Laboratory Co., Ltd. MV2+ dichloride was supplied by Tokyo Kasei Co. Ltd. Proton-permeable Nafion® 115 film was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. Carbon fabric paper (CFP) (TGP-H-030) was obtained from Toray Industries, Inc. Platinum wire, glassy carbon and Ag/AgCl reference (RE-1B) electrodes were obtained from ALS Co., Ltd. All other chemical regents were of analytical grade or the highest grade available.
Cyclic voltammogram measurements
All cyclic voltammograms were measured using a potentiostat (Hokuto Denko HZ-3000) with a three-electrode glass cell under argon gas-saturated 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM MV2+, 100 mM sodium formate and FldDH, and a glassy carbon working electrode. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. All potentials were measured relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
Electrochemical reduction of formate to formaldehyde with FldDH
The electrochemical reduction of formate to formaldehyde was conducted using a platinum wire counter electrode, a TGP-H-030 CFP working electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode using an H-type electrochemical cell. The area of the FCP electrode was 1.5 × 2.5 cm (3.75 cm2). FldDH was added to the working electrode side of the cell. The chambers between the working and counter electrode sides were connected using Nafion® 117. The electrolyte in the counter electrode side was 17 mL of argon gas-saturated 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer. The electrolyte in the working electrode side was 17 mL of argon gas-saturated solution containing 100 mM MV2+, 0.13 mM formaldehyde and FldDH (4.6 units mL−1) in 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer. The pH of buffer solution ranged between 6.0 and 10.3. The external bias was set to −700 mV against the Ag/AgCl electrode, given the single-electron reduction potential of MV2+. The formaldehyde concentration was quantified using Nash reagent composed of acetylacetone and acetic acid/ammonium acetate buffer.40–45 Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the chemical reaction used to quantify formaldehyde using Nash reagent. Details of the formaldehyde quantification method and the calibration curve (Fig. S2, ESI†) are described in the supporting information. Formaldehyde produced in the electrochemical cell was measured using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy at various reaction times by sampling the solution in the working electrode side.
Docking simulation between FldDH and dication or cation radical of MV2+
The crystal structure of FldDH (EC.1.2.1.46) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (PDB ID: 1KOL)46 to prepare a molecular model of FldDH for docking simulation with MV2+ or the cation radical form of MV2+ (MV˙+). The FldDH structure contains NAD+ and sulfonate ion as substrates and these were removed to build the FldDH model used for docking simulations with MV2+ or MV˙+. The docking simulation was carried out using the MyPresto version 5.0 program provided by the Next Generation Natural Product Chemistry (N2 PC).47 A docking site for the substrate was generated by setting the grid size to 40 × 40 × 40 points with a grid spacing of 0.61 Å centered on the original ligand of the FldDH crystal structure. The grid box contained the entire substrate-binding pocket of FldDH, providing enough space for ligand translational and rotational walk. The standard docking protocol for rigid and flexible ligand docking was carried out. The FldDH substrate binding pocket for MV2+ or MV˙+ comprised 11 amino acid residues (D27, G47, S48, H51, V197, R222, R267, H269, P299, G336, T338) and were allowed to move flexibly to accommodate MV2+ or MV˙+. The molecular models were subjected to 100 independent runs per ligand, and other parameters were set to the default values.
Results and discussion
Cyclic voltammogram of MV2+ in the presence of sodium formate and FldDH

Fig. 4 shows the cyclic voltammograms of MV2+, a mixture of MV2+ and sodium formate, and a mixture of MV2+, sodium formate and FldDH in argon gas-saturated 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 7.4). In all cases, a cathodic current based on the single-electron reduction of MV2+ was observed at −700 mV with reference to the Ag/AgCl electrode.

As shown in Fig. 4, the CV of the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+ shows a symmetric curve in reduction and oxidation. Cathode and anode currents in the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+ were estimated to be −1.3 and 1.2 mA, respectively. In addition, cathode and anode potentials were estimated to be −721 and −473 mV, respectively. These results indicate that MV2+ is reversibly redoxed in the potential range between 0 and −900 mV. On the other hand, CV of the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+ and formate also shows approximately symmetrical curve in reduction and oxidation. Broadening of the cathode potential peak in the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+ and formate was observed. Cathode and anode currents in the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+ and formate were estimated to be −1.0 and 0.9 mA, respectively. In addition, cathode and anode potentials were estimated to be −698 and −480 mV, respectively. The addition of formate in the buffer solution slightly reduced the cathodic and anodic currents based on MV2+. Moreover, the cathodic potential based on MV2+ has shifted to the positive side. In the CV of the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+, formate and FldDH, a sigmoid curve was observed on the reduction side, and the peak of the cathode potential based on MV2+ was broadened. The sigmoidization of the CV curve suggests that the FldDH promoted the reduction of formate using MV2+ as an electron mediator. In contrast, anodic current (0.7 mA at −485 mV of anodic potential) based on MV2+ was observed in the sodium pyrophosphate buffer solution containing MV2+, formate and FldDH. We have previously reported that MV2+ does not function as a cofactor for the oxidation of formate to CO2 catalyzed by NAD+-dependent FDH. It is predicted that MV2+ also does not function as a cofactor in the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate catalyzed by FldDH.
Electrochemical reduction of formate to formaldehyde with FldDH using MV2+ as an electron mediator

Fig. 5 shows the time dependence of the current density with continuous potential application (−700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl electrode) in the electrochemical reduction of formate to formaldehyde with MV2+ and FldDH under various pH conditions. Under all pH conditions between 6.0 and 10.3, the formate reduction current density was ca. −5.8 mA cm−2 with an external bias of −700 mV against the Ag/AgCl electrode. Fig. 5(f) shows a photograph of the system at pH 10.3 after applying a continuous potential for 1 h: the color of the solution in the working electrode side changed to dark blue, attributed to MV˙+ production. The color of the solution in the working electrode side changed to dark blue under all pH conditions, suggesting that MV2+ is electrochemically single-electron reduced to MV˙+. We estimated that ca. 650 μmol electrons were generated by application of an external bias for 3 h, based on Faraday's second law of electrolysis.

Fig. 6 shows the time dependence of formaldehyde production due to electrochemical formate reduction with continuous potential application (−700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl electrode) with MV2+ and FldDH under various pH conditions. Under all pH conditions between 6.0 and 10.3, the amount of formaldehyde produced increased with increasing continuous potential application time. In all cases, an induction phase of formaldehyde production was observed after 1 h external bias application. As the pH of the electrolyte increased, the amount of formaldehyde produced tended to increase with external bias application time. Under the pH 10.3 condition, 20 μmol of formaldehyde was produced after 3 h external bias application, providing a conversion yield of formate to formaldehyde of approximately 1.1% under the pH 10.3 condition. There are no previous reports of an electrochemical reduction system of formate to formaldehyde catalyzed by FldDH using NADH or MV2+ as an electron mediator, and thus this is the first determination of the conversion yield for formate to formaldehyde by this electrochemical reduction system.

We previously reported that the Faraday efficiency of MV2+ reduction in this system without any biocatalyst is ca. 85%.38 Linking the electrochemical reduction of MV2+ and the catalytic function of FldDH provides a system for formate reduction to formaldehyde. However, the amount of formaldehyde produced is less than 10% of the theoretical yield based on the electrons obtained by the application of an external bias for 3 h.
The low yield of formaldehyde upon the electrochemical reduction of formate by MV2+ and FldDH was investigated further. We previously reported that even if MV2+ is electrochemically reduced to produce a large excess of MV˙+ for FDH catalysis, the rate of CO2 reduction to formate is slow.48 FDH-catalyzed CO2 reduction requires two electrons, and thus it is necessary to supply electrons from MV˙+ to CO2 twice in FDH. We therefore investigated the interaction of MV˙+ at the substrate binding site of FldDH by docking simulation.
Docking simulation for MV2+ or MV˙+ and FldDH
Docking simulation was conducted to clarify the binding of MV2+ or MV˙+ to the substrate-binding site of FldDH. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the docking score for MV2+ (blue) or MV˙+ (red) to the substrate-binding site of FldDH. The RMSD value was estimated as the measure of the average distance between the backbone atoms of the superimposed FldDH. The docking score for MV2+ or MV˙+ binding to FldDH was an estimated value of the binding affinity by a function of score. The binding mode of MV2+ or MV˙+ to the substrate binding site of FldDH was evaluated from the relationship between the RMSD and the docking score. There is no significant difference in the RMSD value between MV2+ and MV˙+. MV2+ and MV˙+ in several clusters (a total of 100 conformations) were bound within 50 Å of the substrate-binding pocket in FldDH. Fig. 8 shows the docking simulation for MV2+ or MV˙+ to the substrate-binding site of FldDH. The substrate binding site of FldDH is composed of 11 amino acid residues, of which five (S48, H51, P299, G336, T338) are involved in the binding of the nicotinamide moiety of NADH.46

 Fig. 8  Docking simulation for NADH (a), MV˙+ (b) or MV2+ (c) to FldDH. The substrate-binding pocket with amino acid residues (S48, H51, P299, G336, T338) and Zn2+ of FldDH is also shown in each figure. 
The docking simulation result shown in Fig. 8 suggests that MV2+ or MVo+ bind near the substrate binding pocket of FldDH, similar to NADH, and that MVs+ can bind to Zn2+ near the active site,49–54 allowing the reduction of formate to formaldehyde. However, there is insufficient space in the FldDH substrate binding pocket for two molecules of MV2+ or MV˙+.
In the electrochemical reduction of formate by FldDH, the amount of formaldehyde produced is strongly dependent on the pH of the electrolytic solution and thus we investigated the pH dependence of the amino acid residues comprising the substrate binding pocket of FldDH. As mentioned above, the substrate binding pocket of FldDH is composed of aspartic acid, serine, valine, proline, threonine, two glycines, two histidines and two arginines, and the binding of MV2+, MV+ or NADH directly involves glycine, serine, histidine, proline and threonine. The isoelectric point (pI) of these amino acid residues is less than 6.0, excluding histidine and proline. As shown in Fig. 8, glycine, threonine and serine comprise the MV2+ or MVo+ binding site near the Zn2+ of catalytic active center. The chemical structures of MV2+ and MVn+ are not affected by pH. Moreover, since the pKa of formic acid is 3.75, it is not significantly affected because it is present as formate in the pH range 6.0 to 10.3. These results suggest that the structure of the FldDH substrate binding pocket complexed with FldDH-MV+ or MV2+ is not significantly affected in this pH range. In addition, since the substrate formate binds near the Zn2+ of the catalytic active center of FldDH, as shown in Fig. 8, formate access to the catalytic active center is likely not inhibited by MVa+ or MV2+ binding to the substrate binding pocket.
As shown in Fig. 3, the reduction of formate to formaldehyde catalyzed by FldDH requires two molecules of MV˙+. A previously reported48,55 possible mechanism for the electrochemical production of formaldehyde from formate by FldDH using MV2+ as an artificial cofactor is shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Possible mechanism for the electrochemical formaldehyde production from formate with FldDH and MV˙+. 
The mechanism shown in Fig. 9 can be summarized as follows.
1. MV˙+ binds to the catalytic active site of FldDH to form a FldDH-MV˙+ complex.
2. An electron transfers from MV˙+ to the formate binding site of FldDH in the complex.
3. After accepting electrons from the electrode, the MV2+ moiety of the FldDH-MV2+ complex is re-reduced to form FldDH-MV˙+.
4. The electron transfers from MV˙+ to the formate binding site of FldDH in the complex.
5. Formate is reduced to formaldehyde by FldDH-MV2+.
6. MV2+ dissociates from the FldDH-MV2+ complex.
Process 3, the re-reduction of MV2+ bound to FldDH, is predicted to be slower than the other processes. The reduction of formate to formaldehyde by MV˙+ and FldDH depends on the external electron injection source, suggesting that efficient electron injection from the electrode into the MV2+ bound to FldDH is key for formate reduction. Thus, efficient redox of MV2+ in the FldDH substrate pocket is important in the reduction of formate to formaldehyde catalyzed by FldDH using MV2+ as an electron mediator. Electrochemical processes thus require a method for efficient electron injection from an electrode into the FldDH-MV complex.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the electrocatalytic production of formaldehyde from formate by FldDH using MV2+ as an artificial cofactor, with the ultimate aim of reducing CO2 to methanol. Application of a single-electron reduction potential to MV2+ (−700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference) in electrolyte containing formate and FldDH resulted in formaldehyde production. Production was greatly dependent on the pH of the electrolytic solution and was highest at pH 10.3. After 3 h continuous application of an external bias of −700 mV, the maximum conversion yield for formaldehyde production was 1.1% at pH 10.3. We clarified the mechanism for the electrocatalytic production of formaldehyde from formate by FldDH using MV˙+ by investigating the interaction between FldDH and MV2+ or MV˙+ using docking simulation. The results suggested that MV˙+ binds near the substrate binding pocket of FldDH, and MV˙+ can bind to Zn2+ near the active site for formate reduction to formaldehyde. However, there is insufficient space in the FldDH substrate binding pocket for two molecules of MV˙+. Thus, the re-reduction of MV2+ bound to FldDH is an important process, and efficient electron injection from the electrode into the MV2+ bound to FldDH is likely a key process in formate reduction. In the future, the efficiency of formate reduction by this system will be improved by developing an efficient system for injecting electrons from the electrodes into the MV2+ bound to FldDH.
