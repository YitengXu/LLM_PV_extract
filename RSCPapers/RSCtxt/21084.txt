    , Accepted 7th August 2021First published on 16th August 2021AbstractGradient valence-distributed vanadium oxygen hydrate hybrid (G-VOH) nanowires are designed by one-step hydrothermal synthesis for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. It is mainly constructed by superficial NH4+-intercalated VOH ((NH4)2V10O25·8H2O, named as NVOH) and inner deeper vanadium reduction VOH (V3O7·H2O, named as VOH). In the unique nanostructure, both NVOH and VOH are active matrices involved in the Zn2+ electrochemical reaction. Moreover, the outer NVOH functions as a Zn2+ transport framework to provide fast Zn2+ transport capability for the inner VOH. Additionally, the gradient vanadium valence distribution in hybrids enhances the vanadium multi-valence redox kinetics, resulting in significant improvement for the Zn2+ storage capacity. Meanwhile, NVOH also functions as a framework support to suppress the inner VOH crystal structure conversion during the charge/discharge process, facilitating its electrochemical stability. Thus, the G-VOH nanowires obtain a high specific capacity of 434 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, as well as long cycling stability with 86% capacity retention at 2 A g−1 after 1500 cycles. Moreover, the assembled quasi-solid-state G-VOH||Zn batteries achieve a superior specific capacity of 241 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. The strategy of the preparation of gradient valence-distributed vanadium oxygen hydrate provides a new idea for the development of cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries.
1. Introduction
With the overdevelopment and consumption of natural resources, the utilization of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar energies, has been considered as a future energy solution approach. Unfortunately, it still lacks efficient utilization due to the uneven energy distribution in the room and time dimension of such renewable energy. It is necessary to provide a reliable energy storage system with excellent performance, so as to intelligently regulate the distribution of electricity generated by wind and solar farms.1–3 Recently, conventional lithium-ion batteries, which currently dominate the secondary batteries market, are far from the ideal option for large-scale energy storage systems due to their high cost and safety problems.4–8
Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) make the use of zinc metal as the anode, and cheap manganese oxides, vanadium-based compounds, polymer or Prussian blue as cathodes.9–11 At the same time, metal zinc has a relatively low REDOX potential (−0.762 V vs. H2/H+) with a high theoretical mass-specific capacity (850 mA h g−1) and volumetric specific capacity (2400 mA h cm−3), which is one of the most promising alternatives for large energy storage systems.6 However, among those candidate cathodes, manganese oxides are still in the initial research stage due to their unclear reaction mechanism and the dissolution problem of manganese in the cycling process.12,13 Organic cathode materials are also limited by their low theoretical specific capacities.14,15 Vanadium-based compounds, especially intercalated vanadium oxide hydrate (VOH), have been widely studied due to their high theoretical specific capacity (about 589 mA h g−1) and excellent electrochemical stability when cycling at high current densities.16,17 However, in the actual research, the capacities of vanadium-based compounds have always been unable to achieve satisfactory performance due to their insufficient electrochemical reaction. Presently, people use cation intercalation in the V–O interlayer to stabilize the crystal structure, as well as improve the Zn2+ redox kinetics. Many cations, such as Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Li+, and NH4+, have verified their effects in improving the electrochemical performance of VOH.18–23 In addition, manipulations of the vanadium valence in VOH, according to the introduction of oxygen defects or surficial modification, are widely regarded as potential approaches by adjusting the charge density distribution of V–O layers to further accelerate the Zn2+ redox kinetics.24–26
Inspired by the above research, in this paper, gradient vanadium valence-distributed vanadium oxygen hydrate hybrid (G-VOH) nanowires are designed by a one-step hydrothermal process. With the introduction of thioacetamide in the hydrothermal environment, the hybrid nanowires exhibit different degrees of reduction for vanadium valence distribution. The outer layer of G-VOH is constructed by the NH4+-intercalated VOH ((NH4)2V10O25·8H2O, named as NVOH), and the inner layers are deeper vanadium reduction VOH (V3O7·H2O, named as VOH). In the unique nanostructure, both NVOH and VOH are active matrices involved in the Zn2+ electrochemical reaction. The outer layer NVOH displays a larger interlayer spacing of 1.07 nm, which functions as a Zn2+ transport framework to maintain the stable Zn2+ migration channels from NVOH to VOH. Additionally, the gradient vanadium valence distribution in hybrids enhances the vanadium multi-valence redox kinetics. The gradient vanadium valence hybrids, in which the higher vanadium valence is outside for NVOH and the lower vanadium valence is inside for VOH, may be conducive to the formation of the electric field pointing from the outside to the inside, similar to the built-in electric field in the PN node. Under the electric field force, Zn2+ may be more likely to migration and diffusion in vanadium oxygen hydrate. Meanwhile, the crystal structure evolution of inner VOH can be suppressed by the framework support of outer NVOH; thus, both NVOH and VOH obtain high electrochemical stability. Thus, under the synergistic effect of NVOH and VOH, the G-VOH realizes high capacities at high current densities, as well as long cycling stability for aqueous ZIBs and flexible quasi-solid-state ZIBs. The Zn2+ storage mechanism for the hybrid nanowires and their synergistic interaction between NVOH and VOH are systematically investigated by the following physicochemical characterization and electrochemical evaluation.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of G-VOH
V2O5 (98%), thioacetamide (TAA, 99.5%), and H2O2 were purchased from Sigma Co. Ltd, MACKLIN, and Chengdu Kelong Co., Ltd, respectively. All of these chemical reagents were directly used without further purification. G-VOH was synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method. A solution of 50 mL 0.04 mol L−1 V2O5 was prepared by adding V2O5 powder into deionized water with H2O2. Then, 30 mL, 0.04 mol L−1 TAA solution was added to the prepared V2O5 solution at 30 °C and stirred for half an hour. The resulting golden precursor solution was transferred into a sealed 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated to 180 °C and maintained for 6 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the products were centrifuged and collected, followed by washing with ethyl alcohol several times. Finally, green solids were obtained by vacuum drying for 24 h to remove the water and ethyl alcohol.
2.2 Material characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected by a PANalytical X′Pert Pro diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). A Nicolet 6700 FTIR Spectrometer was used to acquire the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra information. Raman spectroscopy tests were performed through the Renishaw RM 1000-Invia λ = 785 nm within the wavenumber range from 100 to 2000 cm−1. A Thermo Scientific K-Alpha apparatus with Al Kα radiation was used to carry out the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The morphologies were characterized by the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FEI INSPECT-F, 20 kV) and transmission electron microscope (FEI Talos F200S).
2.3 Electrochemical analysis
A 2032 type coin cell was assembled to investigate the electrochemical performance of G-VOH in the air atmosphere. A zinc foil with 100 μm was used as the anode after it was polished. Meanwhile, for the glass fiber (GF/A), the 3 M zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) solution was used as the separators and electrolyte, respectively. G-VOH was coated onto the titanium foil after it was polished. The active materials were well ground with acetylene black and PVDF binder to form a slurry (active material, acetylene black, and PVDF binder with a mass ratio of 7:2:1). The mass loading of the active materials for each piece is about 2 mg cm−2. The electrodes were fully dried for 12 h in a vacuum oven at 65 °C before assembly. Electrochemical tests were carried out in the voltage range of 0.4–1.6 V with current densities ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 A g−1 with the Neware test system. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis was carried out using the Neware workstation at 50 mA g−1 and a charge/discharge time and interval of 2400 s and 1200 s, respectively, for each step after activating for 30 cycles. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) test was carried out on CHI760 Shanghai ChenHua workstations within the voltage range of 0.4–1.6 V at 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted within the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.
2.4 Assembly of the quasi-solid-state battery
The quasi-solid-state battery has been assembled, which uses a zinc foil of 100 μm (cut to a disc shape with a diameter of 18 mm) as the anode, the G-VOH as the cathode, and 1.5 M ZnSO4 in PVA (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA1799.) as the gel electrolyte (Fig. 6a). The cathode slurry was prepared in the same as the previous aqueous cell. The gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing 3 M ZnSO4 solution and PVA solution at 80 °C for 10 min to form the gel solution. Then, the obtained gel was further rolled into a film with a thickness of 400 μm, and cut into a disc shape with a diameter of 18 mm. Finally, the quasi-solid-state was assembled and sealed in a vacuum bag with an appropriate conductive electrode ear.
3. Results and discussions
The physicochemical characterization details of G-VOH are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of G-VOH in Fig. 1a displays the mixed phases composition of NVOH (PDF No. 26-0097) and VOH (PDF No. 28-1433). The typical (001), (003), and (020) peaks for NVOH appear at the 8.3°, 25.9°, and 50°, respectively. Meanwhile, the main peaks of the (020), (101), and (002) peaks for (V3O7) (H2O) appear at the positions of 10.4°, 26.3°, and 50.3°. Furthermore, the rest of the diffraction peaks can match these two phases well, although some of them overlap with each other. The FTIR spectrum for G-VOH is displayed in Fig. 1b. Most of these characteristic peaks in the sample correspond to the characteristic peaks for vanadium pentoxide, in which the peaks at 775 and 534 cm−1 are related to the vibrational response of the V–O–V ring in G-VOH.27 The vibrational response of VO rises at the position of 1014 cm−1. Meanwhile, a shrinking vibration peak located at 1400 cm−1 reveals the existence of a vibrational response for NH4+ in NVOH.28 Moreover, the peaks that appear at 1631 and 3440 cm−1 are ascribed to the vibration of –OH from H2O in NVOH and VOH. After analyzing the FTIR result again, it was found that the absorbance peaks for –OH appearing in Fig. 1b show two shoulder peaks near the main peak, which may be ascribed to different chemical environments for H2O in G-VOH. The main peak appearing at 3548 cm−1 is attributed to the vibrational response of –OH from the physically absorbed H2O. Meanwhile, the shoulder peaks at 3440 and 3248 cm−1 correspond to the vibrational response of the binding reaction of H2O with G-VOH. The ratio for H2O has been calculated from TG analysis, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). There is a 2.8 wt.% weight loss below 150 °C, which can be ascribed to the evaporation of the physically absorbed H2O. When the temperature further increases to 350 °C, there is a 4.7 wt.% weight loss, which results from the binding H2O in G-VOH. Both physically absorbed H2O and interlayer binding H2O in G-VOH work as lubricants during the Zn2+ storage process.29,30

A Raman spectrum for G-VOH is shown in Fig. 1c. The bending vibration response of the –O–V–O–V– chain appears at 145 cm−1, while the bending vibration response of VO is located at 283 and 409 cm−1. It can be ascribed to the modes of the orthorhombic crystalline structure for VOH.31 However, a characteristic peak at 283 cm−1, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), can be divided into two response peaks, which are located at 283 and 310 cm−1, respectively, indexed to the bending vibration response of VO from NVOH and VOH.32,33 Moreover, two peaks appearing at the positions of 527 and 701 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration response from V3–O and V2–O, respectively.27 In addition, the peak arising at 997 cm−1 results from the vibrational response of the terminal VO bonding in NVOH and VOH.31
Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the typical nanowire morphology of G-VOH for a span of about 100 nm wide. Moreover, Fig. S3c (ESI†) through Fig. S3f (ESI†) display the EDS mapping for G-VOH, in which clear signals for V, O, N, S are uniformly distributed among the area. Fig. 1d–h further identify the vanadium valence change in G-VOH nanowires under different depths by sputtering. Fig. 1d shows the high-resolution results of V 2p for the surface of G-VOH. There are two pairs of strong signal peaks at the position between 510 eV to 527 eV. Those fitting peaks at 524.8 eV and 517.2 eV are ascribed to the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 for V5+, respectively. Besides, another pair of peaks at 523.4 eV and 515.8 eV are indexed to the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 for V4+, respectively. The stronger V5+ peak intensity for the nanowire implies a higher chemical valence of vanadium for the outer NVOH.34 As it can be see from Fig. 1d–h, the content of V5+ gradually decreases, while V4+ and V3+ increase with the increase of the etching depth. When the surface is etched at depths of 3 nm, 6 nm, 10 nm and 20 nm, the contents of V5+ decrease from 60.7% to 46.8%, 43.1, 30.6 and 28.7, respectively. However, V3+ does not appear on the surface and at depth of 3 nm, and gradually increases from 4.5% to 17.2% and 21.6% after the etching depth reached 6 nm, 10 nm, and 20 nm, respectively. At the same time, the ratio of V4+ first increases from 39.2% to 53.2% from the surface to etch at 3 nm. Then, the reduction degree of V4+ further increases. Parts of V4+ are transformed to V3+, corresponding to the decrease of ratio of V4+ to 49.8% under the depth of 20 nm. The variation curves of the V element in different valence states are shown in Fig. 1k. The different vanadium valence change in G-VOH from the surface to the inner part indicates a gradual vanadium reduction process change in the hybrids.
The vanadium valence distribution in G-VOH was further investigated by TEM (Fig. 2). A single G-VOH nanowire (Fig. 2a) was selected, and it reveals that the V, O, N, and S elements are uniformly distributed in the single nanowire from the EDX mapping. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern from the G-VOH nanowire displays a typical single crystal structure with regular diffraction spots. Meanwhile, as can be seen in Fig. 2c, some diffraction spots can be indexed to the (001), (003), and (400) planes of the NVOH phase (red circle), and the (101), (060), and (002) planes of the VOH (yellow circles) phase, respectively. Many divisive spots that appear in the X-ray diffraction results of the hybrids might be ascribed to the superposition of the crystal planes for NVOH and VOH (such as (003) of NVOH and (101) of VOH, with spacing near 0.334 nm). Furthermore, from the analysis of the possible structure from the higher magnification of TEM (Fig. 2d and inset Figure), a clear interphase can be distinguished. The superficial phase has a lattice spacing of 0.342 nm, corresponding to the (003) plane of NVOH. Furthermore, a significant difference can be seen from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern from a different area of Fig. 2d. It can be observed from the inner nanowires (Fig. 2e) that the main diffraction spots are ascribed to the crystal planes of VOH, which show (002), (101), (020) planes, respectively. However, at the edge of the nanowires (Fig. 2f), it shows significant (003) diffraction spots for NVOH. Meanwhile, the diffraction spots for VOH disappear, and only the (002) plane is left. It means that the hybrid nanowires are composed of superficial NVOH and inner deeper vanadium reduction VOH.

Fig. 3 exhibits the electrochemical property for G-VOH. First, the CV curves (Fig. 3a) were measured to analyze the initial reaction process for G-VOH. Different from the typical two-step reaction process for V2O5, G-VOH exhibits four pairs of peaks (peak 1–peak 4). These oxidization peaks are located at 1.07, 1.02, 0.73, and 0.60 V, while the reduction peaks are located at 0.97, 0.84, 0.64, and 0.49 V, respectively. It means a multi-step redox reaction happens in G-VOH. Among these four pairs of peaks, the first two redox peaks at 1.07/0.97 V, and 1.02/0.84 V are related to the transformation of V5+/V4+ in NVOH and VOH. Furthermore, the redox peaks at the lower voltage range can be ascribed to the transformation process between V4+ and V3+ in these two phases. The intensities of the redox peaks for V4+/V3+ look stronger than those of the redox peaks for V5+/V4+, which indicates an improvement in the redox capability from V4+ and V3+. The enhancement phenomenon usually comes from the electrocatalytic activity of V4+ in the original G-VOH, and has been confirmed by the previous works.20,26,27 The high redox peaks at 1.3 and 1.5 V can be indexed to the redox process resulting from the occupation of the interlayer spacing of the [VO] polyhedral in NVOH by Zn2+.35 Moreover, during the following cycles, there are some redox peaks changes between the 1st cycle and the following cycles, indicating a little crystal structure evolution for G-VOH.

(d) Ragone plot comparison of PANI–VOH with state-of-the-art vanadate ZIB cathodes from the literature. (e) Cycling performance of G-VOH, tested at 2 A g−1. 
Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves for the first three cycles of G-VOH are tested at 0.1 A g−1, and are shown in Fig. 3b. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of G-VOH overlap well with each other, and these curves show a long slope without distinguishable plateaus, then reach a specific capacity of 404 mA h g−1 after three cycles. Additionally, G-VOH gradually reaches the maximum specific capacities of 434 mA h g−1 and remains at 94% capacity retention after 100 cycles (Fig. S4, ESI†). Insightful details of the redox process are revealed in the dQ/dV vs. voltage curves (Fig. S5, ESI†). It reveals significant reduction peaks, as well as wide oxidation peaks, qualitatively agreeing with the CV results. Fig. 3c further evaluates the rate property of G-VOH, which tests at the current densities at 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 A g−1 after each activating for 10 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. The G-VOH also displays high capacities of 400, 386, 362, 327, and 292 mA h g−1 at the corresponding current densities. Examining the charge-discharge curves at different rates, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), one can easily notice that all of the curves display multi-stages slopes between 0.4–1.6 V at both discharge and charge processes. Fig. 3e displays the long cycling performance for G-VOH tested at 2 A g−1. It exhibits capacities of 325 mA h g−1 after activating for several cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Then, the sample remained at 86% capacity retention after 1500 cycles after replacing the Zn counter-electrode, inspired by previously reported work.36
The superior electrochemical performance for G-VOH can be attributed to the typical gradient valence-distributed vanadium enhancing the vanadium multi-valence redox kinetics, resulting in significant improvement for the Zn2+ storage capacity. The comparison of the energy density and power density of G-VOH with other high-performance ZIB cathodes was also obtained from the Ragone plot (Fig. 3e). The G-VOH displays excellent energy densities of 380 and 327 Wh kg−1 at power densities of 500 and 2000 W kg−1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance is comparable with that of the state-of-the-art cathode published in the literature, such as vanadate hydrates (VOH, HVO, NVOH, Mg-VOH, Mn-VOH, NH4+-VOH, PEDOT-V),32,33,37–41 MoS2,42 and vanadium oxides (V3O7/V2O543).

Fig. 4a shows the GITT analysis, which is employed to evaluate the diffusion behavior of Zn2+ in the G-VOH at a different voltage state during the cycle. The calculation details are supplied in the ESI.†44,45 As shown in Fig. 4b, during the cycle process, the Zn2+ diffusion coefficients in G-VOH maintain a stable value of 6.7 × 10−10 cm2 s−1 without drastic fluctuations. Moreover, in order to study the evolution of the electrochemical property for G-VOH, the Nyquist plots from the EIS analysis of the G-VOH electrodes are also provided in Fig. 4c. All of the Nyquist plots exhibit one suppressed semicircle with a straight line. The corresponding equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 4c) is related to the contact resistance (Rsol) between the electrolyte and Zn2+, and the migration resistance of Zn2+ (Rs + Rct) in the surface layer and charge transfer resistance. CPE1 refers to the surface film capacitance and double-layer capacitance. The Warburg impedance (W) refers to the diffusion process of Zn2+ within the active electrode.46,47 When compared with the Rs + Rct of the fresh G-VOH electrode (152.2 Ω), the value of Rs + Rct in G-VOH decreases to 39.2 Ω and 25.4 Ω, after 50 and 1000 cycles, respectively. Meanwhile, the Zn2+ diffusion coefficient is calculated by the low frequency range from EIS according to the formula of ESI.† For the cycled G-VOH electrode, it shows a gradual increase from 2.6 × 10−18 cm2 s−1 of fresh battery to 3.3 × 10−17 cm2 s−1 after the 50th cycle. It further reaches 5.6 × 10−16 cm2 s−1 after the 1000th cycle, which increases by an order of magnitude after cycling for a long time. This means that the G-VOH electrode maintains stable electronic and ion transportation.48 According to Fig. 4b, c and the fitting results in Table S1 (ESI†), the ion diffusion efficiency is improved after the 1000th cycle. It can be speculated that after the repeated cycles, the crystallinity of the hybrids might be broken down and further transformed into a nanocrystal structure. The nanostructure would further increase the specific surface area of the materials, and shorten the ion transform channel, ultimately leading to an increase in the ionic diffusion coefficient.

To investigate the electrochemical mechanism of Zn2+ ion storage during the cycle process, ex-XRD, TEM, and XPS analysis were performed on G-VOH electrodes at various voltage states (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5a and b, when the battery discharges to 0.8 V, the diffraction peak of (001) for NVOH gradually shifts from 8.4° to 8.1°, corresponding to an interlayer distance expanding from 10.4 to 10.9 Å. Upon further discharges to 0.4 V, the peak at 8.1° for NVOH remains. Meanwhile, most of the peaks belonging to inner VOH become weaker, which indicates that VOH transforms to a nanocrystalline form. Meanwhile, the (101) phase for VOH shifts from 24.9° to 24.5° when discharged to 0.4 V. Moreover, a new peak ascribed to (Zn(OH)2)3(ZnSO4)(H2O)5 (named as ZnSOH in Fig. 5b) appears at 16.3°,49 in relation with the side reaction of the electrolyte. Upon further charging to 1.0 V, the lattice spacing for the (001) plane of the outer NVOH remains at 10.9 Å, demonstrating that the Zn2+ transport and diffusion channel along the [00l] direction maintains stability after cycling. On the contrary, the (020) peak for VOH reappears and becomes strong when the battery charges to 1.0 V, which indicates that the crystal structure can be returned after Zn2+ de-intercalation. When it further charges to 1.6 V, those (020) and (101) peaks for VOH continue to strengthen. At the same time, the (101) peak for VOH gradually shifts to 25.8°. Meanwhile, the (001) plane of NVOH goes back to 10.4 Å again after the voltage reaches 1.6 V. A newly appeared peak for ZnSOH becomes weaker along with the charging process, implying the dissolution of ZnSOH. This demonstrates that the crystal structure of both NVOH and VOH are reversibly changed during the charge and discharge process. This might be coming from the gradient vanadium valence distribution in the hybrids suppressing the dramatic crystal structure evolution during the Zn2+ intercalation and extraction process.

This viewpoint can be further confirmed through the HRTEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 5d, e, and Fig. S7 (ESI†). Fig. 5d reveals the SAED result collected at a fully discharged state from Fig. S7c (ESI†), which shows a dark diffraction spot indexing to the (101) plane of VOH and a bright spot for the (003) plane of NVOH, respectively. Meanwhile, other spots that appear in the SAED pattern of the fresh sample (Fig. 2c) become ambiguous. The above phenomenon is consistent with the weaker diffraction peaks of VOH in the XRD results for the discharged sample. However, when it comes to the fully charged state (Fig. 5e collected from Fig. S7d, ESI†), the diffraction spot for the (101) plane of VOH becomes bright again when recharged to 1.6 V. Interestingly, as can be seen in Fig. 5e, the blurred diffraction rings indexed to the typical polycrystalline patterns for (120) and (130) planes of VOH are detected, indicating that VOH in G-VOH transforms to a nanocrystalline form. However, the (003) plane for NVOH still can be seen during this charge process, implying the stability of the outer NVOH. Moreover, as can be seen in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the morphology of the original nanowire (Fig. 2a) suffers a small structural collapse after discharging to 0.4 V (Fig. S7a, ESI†) and recharging to 1.6 V (Fig. S7b, ESI†). Clear lattice fringes can be seen in Fig. S7c and S7d (ESI†). Ex situ XPS analysis (Fig. 5f and g) was conducted to identify the vanadium valence variation in the surface of G-VOH.

Ex situ XPS analysis (Fig. 5f and g) was conducted to identify the vanadium valence variation in the surface of G-VOH. Fig. 5f displays the V 2p spectrum of G-VOH at a fully discharged state. It exhibits the V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 peaks in the binding energy range of 510–529 eV, corresponding to the satellite peaks of V5+ (517.7 eV and 525.2 eV), V4+ (516.4 eV and 524.2 eV), and V3+ (514.3 eV and 522.3 eV), respectively.50,51 Compared with the original state of G-VOH, the contents of V5+, V4+ and V3+ are 29.8%, 55.6%, and 14.6%, respectively, indicating that the outer NVOH is involved in the electrochemical reaction. Most of the V5+ elements are transformed into V4+/V3+ during the discharge process. Furthermore, apart from the surface vanadium valence change, the inner vanadium valence of VOH also arises from the reduction process. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) of the XPS results after etching at 20 nm, the peak intensities of V4+ at V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 binding energies further increase. The content of V5+ decreases to 29.2% and those of V4+ and V3+ increase to 49.7% and 21.1%, respectively. This indicates that the inner VOH also contributes large Zn2+ storage capability. When further charged to 1.6 V again (Fig. 5g), the binding energy of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 shifts to the higher binding energy. Mathematically, for about only 38.9% V4+ remains in G-VOH, which is almost equal to that in the superficial fresh sample. It confirms the high electrochemical reversibility for G-VOH.
Combined with the above analysis, the electrochemical mechanism of G-VOH can be ascribed to the electrochemical storage process of both NVOH and VOH (Fig. 5h). Both NVOH and VOH are active matrices involved in the Zn2+ electrochemical reaction; meanwhile, the outer NVOH functions as a Zn2+ transport framework to provide fast Zn2+ transport capability for the inner VOH. Besides, the crystal structure evolution of inner VOH can be suppressed by the framework support of the outer NVOH; thus, both NVOH and VOH obtain high electrochemical activity. Furthermore, Zn2+ can migrate from NVOH to VOH easier on the one hand due to the larger interlayer and stability for NVOH. On the other hand, the viewpoint that the gradient vanadium valence hybrids (in which the higher vanadium valence is outside for NVOH and the lower vanadium valence is inside for VOH) may be conducive to the formation of the electric field pointing from the outside to the inside, similar to how the built-in electric field in the PN node may play some role in the typical electrochemical property. Under the electric field force, Zn2+ may be more likely to migration and diffusion in vanadium oxygen hydrate. Thus, the hybrids obtain high capacities at high current densities, as well as long cycling stability for aqueous ZIBs and flexible quasi-solid-state ZIBs. It will also benefit the electrode to retain stable Zn2+ redox kinetics, resulting in higher Zn2+ storage capability and better rate performance.
A quasi-solid-state battery based on G-VOH was also assembled (Fig. 6). There is a small difference in the characteristics between the liquid electrolyte and quasi-solid-state battery for their initial discharge curves. The initial discharge curve of the aqueous G-VOH||Zn battery (Fig. 3b) shows a long slope below 1.0 V without distinguishable plateaus, which means a more sufficient Zn2+ intercalation process accompanies the continuing valence change of the vanadium ions in G-VOH. However, for the first discharge process of the quasi-solid-state G-VOH||Zn battery (Fig. 6b), it has two gradually varied slopes below 1.0 V, meaning a multi-steps Zn2+ intercalation process. Besides, the higher slope of the discharge curve for the quasi-solid-state G-VOH||Zn battery than that of the aqueous G-VOH||Zn battery indicates a larger polarization phenomenon during the Zn2+ intercalation process. Thus, it displays a specific capacity of 241 mA h g−1 for the initial discharge process. However, after the 500th cycle, the quasi-solid-state G-VOH||Zn battery still maintains 177 mA h g−1, with 73% capacity maintained for the maximum valves. The long cycling stability of the battery in the gel electrolyte indicates its potential application in a future flexible recharge aqueous battery.

4. Conclusion
The gradient valence-distributed vanadium oxygen hydrate hybrid nanowires are designed by a one-step hydrothermal synthesis process for aqueous ZIBs. NVOH on the surface of the designed G-VOH nanowires maintained the stable Zn2+ migration channels from NVOH to VOH. Additionally, the gradient vanadium valence distribution in hybrids enhances the vanadium multi-valence redox kinetics, resulting in significant improvement for the Zn2+ storage capacity. Meanwhile, NVOH functions as a framework support to suppress the inner VOH crystal structure conversion during the charge/discharge process, facilitating the electrochemical stability of the nanowires. Thus, the G-VOH nanowires obtained a high specific capacity of 434 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, as well as long cycling stability with 86% capacity retention at 2 A g−1 after 1500 cycles. Moreover, the assembled quasi-solid-state G-VOH||Zn batteries achieved a superior specific capacity value of 241 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. The strategy of the preparation of the gradient valence-distributed vanadium oxygen hydrate provides a new idea for the development of cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries.
