Fluorine ions play an essential role in the growth process. The novel ZnO nanorod array based gas sensor showed high performance for ethanol detection.Zinc oxide (ZnO) is considered to be one of the most promising functional materials in many areas, such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, piezoelectric transducers, and gas sensors.1–4 Research in the area of ZnO on the nanoscale is motivated by the possibility of shape controlled synthesis with unique properties and various applications. Recently, novel rhombus-shaped ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays have attracted considerable attention. Lu et al. reported an electrodeposition method to grow rhombus-shaped ZnO NR arrays, which showed markedly improved hydrogen storage capacity and power conversion efficiency.5–7 Pei et al. have successfully realized the rhombus ZnO by metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).8 However, these methods face problems of complicated operation procedures and severe operating conditions. Thus it is urgent to introduce a controllable method with low cost, process simplicity, environmental friendliness and high yield of products to synthesize the unique architecture of rhombic ZnO NR arrays. Here, we present a facile fluorine-mediated hydrothermal route to controlled synthesis of mesoporous rhombic ZnO NR arrays, which showed high performance in ethanol detection.In a typical hydrothermal procedure, 4 mmol zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), 16 mmol ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and 8 mmol hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4, HMT) were dissolved in 40 ml high purity water. After stirring, the homogeneous solution was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then a piece of titanium (Ti) foil was immersed. The autoclave was maintained at 95 °C for 24 h inside an electric oven. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrate was removed, rinsed with distilled water several times, and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 h to obtain the precursor Zn(OH)F. Finally, the as-prepared precursors were converted to ZnO via thermal decomposition at 450 °C in air for 4 h.The phase composition and morphology of both the precursor and annealed products obtained by the fluorine-mediated hydrothermal method were firstly investigated systematically. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the typical XRD pattern and SEM image of the precursor Zn(OH)F. The XRD result proves the formation of the Zn(OH)F intermediate. The pattern shows very sharp peaks, and except for those arising from the Ti substrate, all of the diffraction peaks are in good agreement with Zn(OH)F (JCPDS card no. 50-0827), which indicates that the precursor is a pure orthorhombic phase and has good crystallinity. Large-scale and high density arrays of Zn(OH)F NRs are uniformly grown on the substrate with a length of about 15 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†). Fig. 1(b) shows that the NRs are rhombic with an average edge length of 400 nm and an induced edge angle of around 50°, and the surface of the NRs is smooth. Heat treatment of Zn(OH)F NRs resulted easily in rhombus-shaped ZnO NRs, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The XRD pattern corresponds well to hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451), which reveals a complete thermal conversion of the precursor to pure ZnO. The SEM image shows that the NRs also maintain the shape of a rhombus, but with a coarse surface. Moreover, a large amount of pores appeared on the surface, which may be formed due to the dehydration and lattice contraction occurring during the thermal treatment.9,10 Fig. 1  (a) XRD pattern and (b) SEM image of the precursor Zn(OH)F nanorods; (c) XRD pattern and (d) SEM image of the rhombic ZnO nanorods derived from Zn(OH)F nanorods. N2 sorption was used for the characterization of the porous structure of rhombic ZnO NR arrays and for gathering information about the specific surface area and pore size. The N2 absorption–desorption isotherms of the precursor Zn(OH)F (Fig. S2, ESI†) exhibit no holes on the NRs. Fig. 2 with insets shows the pore size distribution of the rhombic ZnO NRs maintained after thermal treatment at 450 °C. It can be observed that the isotherms are characteristic of a type IV with type H3 hysteresis loop which confirms the mesoporous structure.11 BET measurement shows that the ZnO NR arrays have a surface area of 20.5 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution shows a peak at 13.2 nm (inset of Fig. 2). The change is also clearly reflected in TEM images (Fig. S3, ESI†). The typical TEM images indicate that a single NR of Zn(OH)F has a diameter of ∼400 nm with a smooth surface, however, a porous structure with a rough surface for ZnO, which corresponds with the SEM and N2 sorption results. This change leads to the formation of the porous ZnO through the thermal decomposition, without altering the original rhombic shape. Fig. 2  N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm curve of the rhombic ZnO NR arrays and porous volume distribution of the pore size (inset). On the basis of the above-mentioned discussion, we suggest that the formation of rhombus-shaped Zn(OH)F is a prerequisite for the achievement of rhombic ZnO NR arrays. Therefore, surface composition of the white Zn(OH)F was further characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The binding energies obtained in the XPS analyses were corrected for specimen charging by the C 1s peak to 281.9 eV. The O 1s, F 1s, and Zn 2p peaks are shown in Fig. 3(a), indicating the existence of oxygen, fluorine and zinc elements on the sample surfaces of the precursor. The binding energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 are identified at 1018.6 and 1041.7 eV, respectively.12 The O 1s peak shown in Fig. 3(c) at 528.1 and 528.8 eV can be attributed to the lattice oxygen of Zn(OH)F and H2O molecules, respectively. As expected in Fig. 3(d), the F 1s sharp peak at 681.3 eV can be assigned to the lattice fluorine. Fig. 3  XPS spectra of the precursor Zn(OH)F NR arrays: (a) full survey scan spectrum; slow scan spectra of (b) Zn 2p, (c) O 1s and (d) F 1s. In our experiment, F− is considered to play a decisive role in the formation of rhombic Zn(OH)F NR arrays. Fig. 4 shows typical SEM images of the as-prepared nanostructures with different concentrations of NH4F. In the absence of NH4F, the surface of the substrate is covered with hexagon-shaped nanorods of diameter more than 500 nm (Fig. 4a). When 4 mmol NH4F is added, hexagon-shaped nanorods and rhombic nanowires coexist in the product (Fig. 4b). When the amount of NH4F is increased to 8 mmol, rhombic nanowires are the only morphology while the hexagon-shaped NRs disappear entirely (Fig. 4c). When the quantity of NH4F is further increased (16 mmol), the morphology retains a rhombus-shaped architecture, and shows complete nanorods (Fig. 4d). This result strongly indicates that the concentration of NH4F plays an essential role in the growth of the rhombus-shaped nanorod arrays. Fig. 4  SEM images of nanostructures with different concentrations of NH4F: (a) 0 mmol, (b) 4 mmol, (c) 8 mmol and (d) 16 mmol. From the above observations, we suggest that the preferential combination between F− and Zn2+ to form ZnF+ complexes prevents the formation of Zn(OH)2, which has a hexagon-like nanorods structure. The formation mechanism of the rhombic ZnO NR arrays is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5. At the beginning of the hydrothermal reaction, Zn2+ ions interact with F− ions to form ZnF+ complexes. With the temperature of the reactant solution increasing to 95 °C, HMT hydrolyzes into formaldehyde and ammonia, acting as a pH buffer to slowly release OH−. The OH− further react with ZnF+ to form Zn(OH)F crystals. Functional groups (e.g. hydroxyl groups) would exist on the surface of Ti foil containing chemical defects, hydroxyl and carboxyl or carbonyl groups, which are beneficial to heterogeneous nucleation on the supporting substrate.13–15 With the assistance of hydrogen bonding on the Ti foil, the dangling functional groups can act as anchor sites to capture Zn(OH)F crystal seeds and make the as-formed crystal seeds stick firmly to the substrate. The rough surface of the Ti foil is also in favor of nucleus formation and metal oxide growth. These crystals might agglomerate into rhombic crystalline particles on the surface, which could then begin to impinge on other neighboring crystals and finally form into rhombus-shaped NR arrays. After calcination, the porous ZnO NRs are obtained without altering the original morphology of the rhombus-shaped Zn(OH)F precursor during the solid-state reaction. The overall chemical reactions can be expressed with the following formulas: Zn2+ + F− → ZnF+(1) (CH2)6N4 + 6H2O → 4NH3 + 6HCHO(2) NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH−(3) ZnF+ + OH− → Zn(OH)F(4) Zn(OH)F → ZnO + HF↑(5) Fig. 5  Schematic illustration of the formation process of the rhombic ZnO NR arrays. As a result of the large surface areas and mesoporous structure in the ZnO nanorod arrays, it is worthwhile to study its gas-sensing performance. The ZnO NRs directly grown on the Ag–Pd finger regions are randomly oriented, which provides electrical paths between the neighbouring fingers. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristic reveals good Ohmic contacts between the NRs and the electrodes (Fig. S4, ESI†). To make gas sensing measurements, ethanol was introduced into a sealed chamber at the optimal working temperature of 300 °C. Fig. 6 shows typical response and recovery curves between ethanol and ambient air. The response undergoes a drastic ascent on the injection of ethanol vapor and is mostly recovered to its initial value after the test gas is released. Both the response and recovery were very fast, taking about 4 and 6 s, respectively, which is comparable to commercial ethanol detectors. Moreover, the inset shows the nearly linear calibration curve in the range of 10–100 ppm, which confirms that the sensor is quantitative for low concentration ethanol gas detection. The result also shows that the sensor could detect ethanol gas in a wide range of concentrations, starting with the minimum concentration of 10 ppm, which is below the limit imposed for a breath analyser.16 We believe that the high performance for ethanol detection can be attributed to the unique structure of rhombic ZnO NR arrays with a variety of favorable features involving mesoporous structure, high surface-to-volume ratio, and open space of nanoarrays.17,18 Fig. 6  The representative response and recovery curve of the rhombic ZnO NR array based gas sensor with the concentration of ethanol ranging from 10 to 200 ppm at 300 °C (the inset shows the corresponding response curve). In conclusion, mesoporous rhombic ZnO NR arrays were successfully synthesized by a facile fluorine-mediated hydrothermal method involving the formation of the Zn(OH)F precursor and then thermally conversion to ZnO. In the process, F ions play a significant role in the formation of high aspect ratio rhombic nanorod arrays. The rhombic ZnO NR array based gas sensor shows high performance in ethanol detection.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51072181 and 51372224), Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province (project no. 2010R50020).Notes and referencesX.
