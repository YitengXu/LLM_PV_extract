    , Accepted 9th June 2021First published on 11th June 2021AbstractA two-dimensional (2D) Dion–Jacobson (DJ) lead-free semiconductive hybrid double perovskite (HDP) [(3AMPY)2AgBiI8·H2O] (3AMPY = 3-(aminomethyl) pyridinium) (1) has been reported, which shows an attractive narrow band gap of 1.86 eV. Importantly, 1 is the first 2D DJ lead-free environmental friendly HDP constructed by an aromatic diammonium cation with high stability in humid conditions.
The toxicity issue of lead halide perovskites limits their applications in numerous fields.1–4 Low toxicity and narrow band gap of hybrid perovskites have always been the hot pursuit in the field of optoelectronics. From the perspective of environmental friendliness and wide absorption spectrum, increasing number of researchers have paid attention to the lead-free narrow gap hybrid double perovskites (HDPs) because of their non-toxicity and phase stability.5–7 Compared with three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskite materials, low dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid-layered materials can provide more diversity and environmental stability in the selection of various organic cations.8,9 During the past few years, a series of lead-free two-dimensional (2D) HDPs have been successfully synthesized, such as (C3H9NI)4AgBiI8,5 (n-propylammonium)2CsAgBiBr7,7 and (n-butylammonium)2CsAgBiBr7.8 However, the above-mentioned lead-free HDPs all have the Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type structure constructed by chain-like organic amines. Compared with the RP-type lead-free HDPs, the Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type lead-free HDPs constructed by diammonium cations can shorten the distance and eliminate the van der Waals gap between the adjacent inorganic layers. Simultaneously, the neighboring inorganic slabs can be connected via hydrogen-bonding interactions with the diammonium groups, which may effectively promote the charge transport. These advantages make the 2D DJ type hybrid perovskites popular in numerous fields. It is worth noting that even in the lead hybrid perovskites, due to the lack of suitable structural characterization, the kinds of DJ type lead hybrid perovskites are still not abundant and various.10–15 Moreover, most of the cations used to construct 2D DJ type lead hybrid perovskites are linear alkyl diammonium and cyclic diammonium, such as 2-methyl-1,5-diaminopentane,10 1,4-butanediamine,14 and 1,6-hexamethylenediammonium.15
It is well known that the types of organic cations have great influence on the properties of hybrid perovskite materials. Recently, it has been reported that aromatic diammonium cations with delocalized π-electrons show larger dielectric constants and smaller exciton binding energy, which are helpful to the charge transport.16 To the best of our knowledge, there are few 2D DJ type organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites constructed by aromatic diammonium cations, and all of them are lead hybrid materials. For example, Kanatzidis et al. reported a series of 2D DJ lead halide perovskites, (xAMPY)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (x = 3 or 4, n = 1–4). The cations were 3AMPY and 4-(aminomethyl) pyridinium (4AMPY).16 Grätzel et al. reported a phenyl-based 2D DJ hybrid perovskite (PDMA)FA2Pb3I10, (PDMA = 1,4-phenylenedimethanammonium), which shows excellent stability in a humid environment.17 Recently, Liu et al. reported the thiophene-based high-quality 2D DJ (ThDMA)(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 5), which exhibits high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.75%.18 Compared with the 2D DJ type hybrid perovskites constructed by aliphatic diammonium,19,20 these 2D DJ type hybrid perovskites based on aromatic diammonium cations have been greatly improved in stability and numerous other properties, such as electron transfer capacity between the layers,16 light absorption ability and film forming ability.21 Unfortunately, these 2D DJ type hybrid perovskites all contain the toxic metal lead, and so far, there is no case of lead-free HDP materials based on aromatic diammonium cations. Moreover, the reported band gap of these 2D DJ lead hybrid perovskites constructed by aromatic diammonium is still relatively large, such as (3AMPY)PbI4 (Eg = 2.34 eV), (4AMPY)(MA) Pb2I7 (Eg = 2.15 eV) and (PDMA) PbI4 (Eg = 2.42 eV). Recently, Zheng et al. reported (C6H16N2)2-AgBiI8·H2O,22 (C6H16N2)2-CuBiI8·0.5H2O,22 (4-aminomethylpiperidine)4[BiAgI8]2·H2O23 and (4-aminopiperidine)4 [BiAgI8]2·H2O.23 These lead-free HDPs are all constructed by cyclic diammonium cations. Therefore, it is urgent to study the lead-free HDPs with narrow band gaps constructed by aromatic diammonium cations, which have potential applications in solar cells and optoelectronic devices (X-ray detectors, photo-detectors), photo-catalyst, ferroelectric photovoltaics and storage devices.22–25
Herein, we successfully synthesized the first 2D DJ type lead-free HDPs constructed by aromatic diammonium cations (3AMPY = 3-(aminomethyl) pyridinium), [(3AMPY)2AgBiI8·H2O] (1). The π–π interactions between pyridine molecules and the strong hydrogen bonding between inorganic layers synergistically affected the band gap of the material. Fortunately, 1 exhibits an attractive narrow band gap of 1.86 eV comparable to those of 3D hybrid perovskites. Kanatzidis reports that there is a relationship between the band gap and inorganic interlayer spacing: stronger the interactions between inorganic interlayers, narrower the band gap.26 Our conclusion is consistent with the theoretical results previously reported. Our study provides some reliable detailed research for the design and synthesis of lead-free HDPs based on aromatic diammonium cations.
The purity of crystal 1 is confirmed via X-ray powder diffraction (Fig. S1 ESI†), which is consistent with the theoretical simulation. The structure analysis shows that crystal 1 belongs to the triclinic crystal system with the space group of P (Table S1, ESI†) having the following unit cell parameters: a = 8.5258(4) Å, b = 9.7136(5) Å, c = 18.5101(10) Å, α = 86.146(2)°, β = 88.192(2)°, γ = 88.857(2)°. Crystal 1 forms an [AgBiI8]n4n− double perovskite structure, which is assembled by the Bi–I–Ag bridges to form corner-sharing [BiI6] and [AgI6] octahedra and is separated by the [(3AMPY)2]4+ cations in Fig. 1a and b. In Fig. 1(a), 1 adopts a typical 2D monolayered DJ type perovskite framework with a short interlayer distance of 3.536 Å. It is worth mentioning that the introduction of aromatic diammonium cations into lead-free HDPs could enhance the electrostatic interaction within the inorganic layers via the delocalization of the positive charge on the aromatic ring. The interlayer distance of 1 is comparable to that of the lead-based hybrid perovskites constructed by the same aromatic diammonium cations ((3AMPY)(MA)Pb2I7, 3.554 Å) and is smaller than the other lead-based 2D DJ type perovskite ((4AMPY)(MA)Pb2I7, 4.006 Å).16 Moreover, Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show that the structure of 1 consists of [BiI6] and [AgI6] distorted octahedron, particularly the distortion of the AgI6 octahedron is more severe. The bond length in Fig. 1(c) also clearly reflects this distortion. Through calculation,23 the value of distortion (Δd) of the [BiI6] octahedron obtained is 4.27 × 10−4 and the [AgI6] octahedron could reach to 2.53 × 10−2. In short, the introduction of the 3AMPY cation in the process of synthesizing 2D DJ type lead-free HDPs not only affects the distortion of octahedron but also affects the stacking of the adjacent inorganic layers. The replacement of toxic Pb in the rich Pb-halide perovskite hybrids with Bi3+ and Ag+ can not only be beneficial to the development of environment-friendly HDP materials but also endow the acquired lead-free HDPs with strong light absorption abilities of the Pb hybrids. Fig. 2a shows the optical absorption and the energy band gap of 1, which shows a wide absorption range and a stepwise absorption feature. The optical absorption cutoff is at about 675 nm, corresponding to the band gap of Eg = 1.86 eV. Moreover, because of the short interlayer distance and strong interlayer interaction, the band gap of 1 (Eg = 1.86 eV) is smaller than that of (3AMPY)PbI4 (Eg = 2.34 eV).16 Alternatively, we can simply replace the lead in lead-based hybrid perovskites with Bi3+ and Ag+ to adjust the band gap. Fig. 2b shows the stability test of 1 in air condition through experimental test which exposed the 1 to air during 30 days. The structure of 1 remains unchanged after 30 days at 45% humidity condition (Fig. 2b). In addition, there are no obvious changes in the crystal surface after exposure to air for 30 days (Fig. S5†).These are enough evidence to show that 1 has high stability in the humid environment. Further characterization via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2a†) shows that the water molecule evaporates at about 335 k and the compound 1 begins to decompose at 535 K. Fig. S2b† shows the IR spectrum of 1, which shows the bonding information of 3AMPY cations and water molecule. The band at around 3475 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibrations of the OH group, while the bands at 3042 cm−1 and 1536 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of the NH3+ group. The vibration of the CH2 group is shown around 1467–1167 cm−1 and the vibration of C–N and C–C groups are observed in the region of 1076–471cm−1.27,28 In Fig. 3, the Hirshfeld surface analysis is used to study the intermolecular interactions in 1. Among these pictures, the white areas represent the distance of the van der Waals contact, the blue areas correspond to longer contacts and the red areas represent closer contacts. Moreover, from Fig. 3b, we can see that there are numerous small red spots on the fingerprint plot of water molecule, which indicates that there are relatively strong interactions between the water molecule and other molecules around it. In Fig. S3,† the most intense interaction is the H⋯H interaction, which can reach to 33.8%, and the second intense interaction is H⋯I/I⋯H interaction (33.3%), the third intense interaction is the O⋯H/H⋯O interaction (30.2%). In addition, the interaction of H⋯Ag/Ag⋯H is about 2.6%. From this point, it can be explained that it is the existence of H⋯Ag/Ag⋯H interactions that lead to the more severe distortions of [AgI6] octahedrons. Compared with H⋯Ag/Ag⋯H interactions, there is no obvious interaction between H⋯Bi/Bi⋯H. It can be seen from Fig. 3c and d that the interaction between the two organic amine molecules and other surrounding molecules are also different. We also can see that there are three different types of hydrogen bonds in compound 1 (Fig. 4a). One is the N–H⋯I bond formed between the organic amine and inorganic skeleton, another is the N–H⋯O band connecting the organic amine and water molecule, the third type of O–H⋯I bond is the interaction between the water molecule and inorganic skeleton. Moreover, the distance between the adjacent antiparallel 3AMPY molecule via aromatic-aromatic interaction is 3.56 Å (Fig. 4b), which proves the presence of π–π interactions between the pyridinium rings. It also shows that the stability of 1 is due to the interactions of the hydrogen bond, π–π interactions and van der Waals force between these molecules. This conclusion is in accordance with the high stability of compound 1 though experimental measures in air for 30 days in Fig. 2b and Fig. S5.†

The calculated electronic band structure of 1 is shown in Fig. S4.† The calculated Eg (1.85 eV) is almost consistent with experimental Eg (1.86 eV). In order to clarify the contribution of different atomic orbitals to the band gap, the partial density of states (PDOS) are calculated in Fig. 4c. The valence band is mainly contributed by the Ag-4p, Bi-6p and I-5p orbitals, while the conduction band is mainly originated from the Bi-6p and I-5p orbitals. This shows that the semiconductive property of compound 1 is mainly provided by the inorganic skeleton. Moreover, the Bi-6p orbital and Ag-4d orbital overlapped with the I-5p orbital in the energy range from −4 eV to 0 eV, manifesting the strong Bi–I bonds and Ag–I bonds in the inorganic anions. The H-1s orbital overlapped with C-2p, N-2p and O-2p orbitals in the energy region of −4 eV to 0 eV, which proved the strong interactions of the C–H, N–H and O–H bonds in the compound 1. The photoresponse of 1 at 637 nm light has been listed in Fig. S6.†
In summary, we have successfully obtained a novel 2D DJ type lead-free HDP [(3AMPY)2AgBiI8·H2O] (1) with an attractive narrow bandgap of 1.86 eV. It is the first time introduction of aromatic diammonium cations into lead free HDPs, leading to DJ-type hybrid 1 with a short interlayer distance of 3.536 Å. More importantly, the stability of crystal 1 was further enhanced by the presence of strong π–π interactions between the adjacent pyridinium rings. Therefore, we constructed a potential lead-free semiconductive hybrid, which could be used in the electronic and optoelectronic applications.
