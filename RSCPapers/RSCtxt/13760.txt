    , Accepted 31st August 2017First published on 31st August 2017AbstractCharge separation/transfer and photocorrosion are two major factors limiting the photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications of the Ta3N5 photocatalyst. Herein, we have fabricated Ta3N5 single-crystal nanorods with Mg doping by flux-assisted crystal growth, aiming to shorten the charge transport distance and increase the electrical conductivity. The optimized Mg-doped Ta3N5 photoanodes exhibit an unprecedented PEC water splitting activity with an AM 1.5G photocurrent of 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. The high performance is attributed to the fact that the bulk modification, Mg doping, can induce oxygen-impurity surface states as effective electron trap centers, thus increasing the electrical conductivity of Ta3N5 and charge separation efficiency. After a conformal surface modification with CoOOH by a simple electrodeposition method as a water oxidation electrocatalyst to improve the hole extraction and reaction kinetics, the Mg-doped Ta3N5 photoanodes afford an over 4-fold increase in photocurrent (ca. 6.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE) and about 70% retention of the initial photocurrent after 70 min irradiation at 1.0 VRHE. Our results testify that the bulk and surface co-modification is an effective route to develop high-performance PEC water splitting devices.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen generated from photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting offers an intriguing avenue for renewable, clean and abundant fuel production.1–4 However, to enable practical solar hydrogen production, significant advances in efficiency are required before such artificial photosynthetic devices are economical enough to produce hydrogen to compete with fossil-based fuels.5,6 Thus, low-cost, stable and high-performance semiconductor materials are needed.7,8
Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) is a near-ideal photoanode candidate because of its visible-light absorption up to 600 nm, abundant element availability, and well-matched band positions straddling the water splitting redox potential.9–11 It is widely accepted that two main factors limit the PEC activities of Ta3N5: (1) the crystal defects from insufficient crystallinity as well as the low carrier mobility of about 1.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 lead to insufficient charge separation and transport in the bulk of Ta3N5. (2) Surface photocorrosion of Ta3N5 originates from the inefficient hole extraction inducing self-oxidation during irradiation.12–15
For fast separation and transfer of photogenerated charges in the bulk, one-dimensional (1D) Ta3N5 nanostructures, such as nanorods,10,16,17 nanotubes18 and nanowires,19 were grown to overcome its short carrier diffusion length (∼9 nm)12 and improve charge collection efficiency. Additionally, cation doping is another efficient method to enhance charge collection efficiency, owing to the fact that the element doping induced increment of the carrier density can effectively increase the electrical conductivity of Ta3N5. Various hetero/homovalent metal ions, such as Ba2+, Mg2+, Ge4+, Zr4+ and W5+, were introduced into the crystal lattice of Ta3N5 successfully enhancing its electrical conductivity.10,20–25 In particular, the experimental results have indicated that Mg–Zr cosubstitution is able to negatively shift the photocurrent onset potential of the Ta3N5 photoanode to 0.55 VRHE (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) for PEC water splitting.20 Nevertheless, the PEC performances of these element-modified Ta3N5 photoanodes are not high enough and the effect of doping manipulation on photoelectrochemical activity is not fully understood. Take Mg doping as an example, various explanations have been suggested. Mg doping was considered to be beneficial to the introduction of oxygen species and simultaneous elimination of nitrogen vacancies,11,26 changes of surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic,22 and changes in the band gap potentials.20
Depositing an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) onto the semiconductor surface is a typical strategy to improve hole extraction and transfer from the surface of Ta3N5 to the electrolyte, thus decreasing the surface accumulation of holes to protect the Ta3N5 surface against photocorrosion.27,28 Although various Fe, Co, or Ni-containing OECs have been tried to achieve this goal, it is still a challenge to deposit OECs on Ta3N5 photoanodes with a highly conformal coating interface that can efficiently extract and transfer holes from Ta3N5 to the OEC layer.29 Recently, electrodeposition techniques were used to deposit OECs on photoanodes. This technique has clear superiority in uniform coating growth on a complex morphology and adjustable coating thickness. A few successful cases were achieved. Co-Based catalysts and core–shell-structured Ni@Ni(OH)2 were electrodeposited on a flat Si surface to promote the hole-extraction efficiency for robust and stable PEC water splitting.30,31
In this study, using Mg-doped Ta3N5 as a model material, we aimed to understand the nature of the element doping effect, while exploring effective methods to uniformly deposit an OEC layer on Ta3N5 photoanodes with complex nanostructures. 1D Mg-doped Ta3N5 nanorods with high crystallinity were synthesized by flux-assisted crystal growth and were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as a photoanode. Both the 1D nanostructures and bulk Mg doping contribute to the improvement of carrier collection efficiency due to the shortened carrier diffusion distance, increased electrical conductivity and promoted charge separation efficiency. We found that the charge balance by replacing the Ta5+ of Ta3N5 with Mg2+ will introduce oxygen impurities, a shallow electron donor level, which can trap a large amount of photogenerated electrons at relatively high applied potentials, hence increasing the charge separation efficiency and prolonging the carrier lifetime. The conformal CoOOH coating was uniformly electrodeposited on the surface of Ta3N5 nanorods as an OEC catalyst and anti-corrosion layer to promote the extraction and transfer of holes. As a result, an AM 1.5G photocurrent up to 6.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, and a low onset potential of 0.6 VRHE as well as about 70% retention of the initial photocurrent after 70 min irradiation at 1.0 VRHE were obtained for the assembly. These strategies proposed in our study offer a rational design of efficient photoanodes for applications in PEC cells.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of photocatalysts
Mg-Doped Ta3N5 (denoted as Mg-Ta3N5) nanorods were prepared by a Na2CO3 flux-assisted nitriding growth method. Take 5% Mg-Ta3N5 as an example, powders with a 5:0.5 molar ratio of Ta2O5 (2.21 g, Aladdin, purity 99.9%) to MgBr2 (0.09 g, Aladdin, purity 99.9%) were well blended in ethanol solvent, and then dried at room temperature (25 °C). Then the mixed powders were annealed in air at 800 °C for 2 h to yield oxide precursors. Subsequently, the as-prepared oxide precursors were mixed with 0.53 g Na2CO3 (Aladdin, purity 99.99%, melting point 851 °C) according to a molar ratio of Ta2O5:Na2CO3 = 1:1 by manually grinding in an agate mortar. Next, the mixtures (0.1 g) were transferred into an alumina boat (6 × 3 × 3 mm), which was placed at the center of a horizontal alumina tube furnace (inner diameter = 50 mm), followed by heating at 950 °C for 500 min at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 under flowing NH3 at a speed of 1 L min−1. After that, the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature. The Mg-Ta3N5 powders were obtained after being washed three times with distilled water. The molar percentage of Mg could be controlled by simply adjusting the amounts of MgBr2 with other conditions remaining unchanged. In addition, for comparison, pure Ta3N5 nanorods were synthesized without addition of MgBr2.
2.2 Photocatalyst characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, USA) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI), respectively. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images were collected on a double-aberration corrected TitanTM cubed G2 60-300 S/TEM equipped with super-XTM technology. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed using a Rigaku Ultima III using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. An inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (PerkinElmer Optima 5300DV) was used to determine the molar ratio of Ta and Mg. GSB 04-1735-2004 Mg standard solution (100 μg mL−1, National Institute of Metrology, China) and GSB 04-1755-2004 Ta standard solution (100 μg mL−1, National Institute of Metrology, China) were used as standard solutions for ICP-AES analysis. The optical properties were studied by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflection spectroscopy performed on a UV-vis spectrometer (UV-2500 PC, Shimadzu Corp., Japan). A standard BaSO4 white plate was used as the baseline corrections. The spectra were converted from reflection to absorption mode by the Kubelka–Munk function. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a Kα X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Scientific). The binding energies were calibrated with respect to the residual C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using an objective-scanning confocal microscope system, in which the samples were excited through an oil-immersion objective lens (Olympus, SR-ASZ-0103, 150×) using a 40 mW pulsed laser (488 nm).
2.3 Preparation of working electrodes
The as-prepared Ta3N5 particles were deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate using an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method followed by necking treatment.8,9 Typically, Ta3N5 (40 mg) powders and iodine (15 mg) were dispersed in acetone (50 mL) followed by sonication for 30 min to obtain Ta3N5 powder suspensions for EPD. Then, the EPD process for Ta3N5 nanorods and Mg-doped Ta3N5 nanorods was conducted between two parallel FTO electrodes with a distance of 1 cm under 15 V of bias for 3 min. The coated area of the Ta3N5 films was ca. 1 cm × 1 cm. The obtained average thickness of the film on FTO was about 3 μm, which was measured from the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image (Fig. S1, ESI†). The electrodes were dried in air, and dropped with TaCl5 methanol solution (10 mM, 10 μL) and then dried in air at 160 °C for 3 min. After repeating this process five times, the dropped electrodes were heated at 470 °C for 30 min in flowing NH3 (500 mL min−1).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out with a three-electrode system with back-side illumination in an aqueous hydroxide electrolyte (1 M NaOH, pH 13.6, maintained at 293 K). In three-electrode measurements, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Chopped and constant illumination linear sweep voltammograms were collected at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. The simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination was obtained with a Newport Sol3A Class AAA solar simulator, and the power intensity of the incident light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the working electrode using a standard Newport 91150 silicon cell as the reference. The irradiated area was circular with an area of 0.28 cm2 and photocurrent densities were normalized to 1 cm2. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 1.23 VRHE for the as-prepared electrodes in the electrolyte mentioned above under AM 1.5G irradiation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted under the open-circuit potential (OCP) and 500 W Xe light irradiation using an electrochemical analyzer (Solartron 1260+1287) with a 10 mV amplitude perturbation and frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz. The Mott–Schottky plots were measured in 1 M NaOH electrolyte (pH 13.6) at a frequency of 500 and 1000 Hz and an amplitude of 15 mV under dark conditions. The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation: VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.1976. The IPCE can be calculated using the equation (IPCE= 1240 × (Jlight − Jdark)/(λ × Plight)), where Jlight and Jdark are the measured photocurrent and dark current density (mA cm−2), respectively, λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm) and Plight is the light intensity at the specific measurement wavelength (W m−2). The applied-bias-compensated half-cell solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (HC–STH) can be calculated using the equation of η = [(1.23 − Vapp) × (Jlight − Jdark)/Plight] × 100%, where Vapp is the applied potential, and Jdark and Jlight are the photocurrent density in the dark and under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight, respectively. Plight is the power density of AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2).
The photocurrent density obtained in 0.1 M Na2SO3 solution (pH buffered to 7.5) was used to calculate the injection efficiency (ηinj) of surface-reaching holes into the solution to complete the water oxidation reaction process using the following equation (ηinj = Jabs/JHS), where JHS is the measured photocurrent density in 0.1 M Na2SO3 hole scavenger solution and Jabs is the measured photocurrent density without a hole scavenger. The faradaic efficiency was tested under 500 W Xe light irradiation in an airtight Ar flow system using an online micro-gas chromatograph (Agilent, 490 Micro GC). Before measurements, the system was flowed with Ar for 30 min to remove the residual air. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution rates were analyzed during PEC water splitting with a time interval of 30 min.
2.5 Co-catalyst deposition
A Co-containing catalyst was electrodeposited from a solution of 0.01 M cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (pH 5.5) in a temperature-controlled (293 K) three-electrode electrochemical cell, while a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The deposition was performed by a multi-step potentiostatic method. On the basis of linear sweep voltammetric data, a nucleation step was conducted by applying −1.05 V versus Ag/AgCl to initialize the formation of small seed particles (Fig. S2, ESI†), followed by a slower crystal growth step during the desired time (typically 5 s, 10 s or 20 s) at a less negative potential of −0.85 V versus Ag/AgCl. After electrodeposition, the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in a N2 atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of Mg-doped Ta3N5 nanorods
To begin with, Ta3N5 and Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods were prepared in the presence of Na2CO3 flux. The SEM and TEM images exhibit that monodisperse Ta3N5 and Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods with ∼50 nm diameter and ∼300 to 500 nm length were obtained (Fig. 1 and S3, ESI†). Fig. 1b shows the typical TEM image of a single Mg-Ta3N5 nanorod. Apparently, compared with conventional porous Ta3N5 particles from a pseudomorphic and topotactic phase transformation of Ta2O5,9 the Ta3N5 nanorods from nitriding Ta2O5 in molten salt had smooth surfaces. This means that the formation of Ta3N5 nanorods follows a different mechanism. We found that an intermediate phase, NaTaO3, formed during nitriding the mixture of Na2CO3 and Ta2O5. This fact may indicate that the nucleation and growth of Ta3N5 nanorods originated from the ammonolysis-driven phase transformation of NaTaO3 in the Na2CO3 flux. Indeed, the morphology and phase formation of Ta3N5 nanorods depend on the mole ratio of Na2CO3 to Ta2O5. The pure-phase Ta3N5 nanorods can be obtained by using 1:1 Na2CO3:Ta2O5 as the precursor, a stoichiometry of NaTaO3. Ta3N5 nanorods cannot be formed when the molar ratio of Na2CO3:Ta2O5 is lower than 1:1, probably due to the insufficient flux support.15 Similarly, if the ratio of Na2CO3:Ta2O5 is above 1:1, Ta3N5 nanorods cannot be observed and the NaTaO3 impurity remains in the final product, meaning that excessive Na2CO3 flux will screen the nitriding process.

To further visualize the crystal structure of the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorod, a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is provided in Fig. 1c. The periodic lattice fringes and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the nanorod (inset of Fig. 1c) reveal the single-crystal nature of the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorod. The lattice spacing of 0.516 nm was assigned to the (020) planes of orthorhombic-phase Ta3N5. Fig. 1d shows a HAAD TEM image and the corresponding elemental mapping images of the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorod. Clearly, besides signals for Ta and N, the homogeneous distribution of Mg was also observed, further confirming the successful introduction of Mg2+ cations. The molar ratio of Mg/Ta in the product was determined to be 5% by ICP-AES analysis (denoted as 5% Mg-Ta3N5). By varying the amounts of Mg cations added, similar nanorods with a Mg/Ta molar ratio of 3% and 10% were successfully prepared, which were denoted as 3% Mg-Ta3N5 and 10% Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†).
The XRD patterns (Fig. 2a) of all the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods give well-defined diffraction peaks which are similar to those of orthorhombic-phase Ta3N5 nanorods (JCPDS 79-1533). An enlarged view of the (110) XRD peak of Ta3N5 (Fig. 2b) displays that the peak slightly shifts to a smaller angle with the increase of Mg amount, owing to the partial substitution of Ta lattice sites by Mg.20 Replacing Ta5+ by Mg2+ will induce a lattice expansion of (110) due to the slightly larger ion radius of Mg2+ (72 pm) than that of Ta5+ (64 pm). The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of pure Ta3N5 and Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods also resemble each other (Fig. 2c). The steep onset of light absorption at ∼600 nm is attributable to electron transitions from N 2p orbitals to empty Ta 5d orbitals. The chemical composition and valence state of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5 were examined by XPS. The Mg 1s core-level XPS (Fig. 2d) depicts a single peak at 1303.4 eV, which is similar to the reported lattice Mg2+ in the Mg–Ta–O–N system.32 No obvious XPS signal of Mg–O binding energy (1303.9 eV) was observed.33 In Fig. 2e and f, the O 1s XPS peak at 532.3 eV corresponds to the chemisorbed O species (e.g., surface chemisorbed H2O/hydroxyl group), whereas the peak at 530.9 eV belongs to TaOx species.29 The surface lattice O/N of 0.68:1 for Ta3N5 increased up to 1.27:1 for 5% Mg-Ta3N5 as determined by XPS semi-quantitative analysis. The increased content of surface lattice oxygen can be ascribed to the fact that the aliovalent substitutions of Mg2+ for Ta5+ concurrently cause N3−/O2− replacement as a result of charge compensation.20,23,24 After Mg doping, the Ta 4p XPS peak shifts about 0.5 eV towards a higher binding energy, resulting from the fact that Ta in Ta–O bonds tends to lose more electrons than that in Ta–N bonds due to the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom than that of the nitrogen atom.32 Similarly, the N 1s peak reveals a shift of the binding energy from 396.1 to 396.4 eV, attributed to the smaller electronegativity of Mg2+ than that of Ta5+.23 Therefore, XPS analysis further confirms that the Mg cations were incorporated into the Ta3N5 lattice, accompanied by lattice oxygen doping for charge balance.

3.2 Water oxidation performance of the Mg-Ta3N5 photoanodes
The PEC performances of pure Ta3N5 and Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods with different contents of Mg were assessed in 1 M NaOH solution using a standard three-electrode system. As seen in Fig. 3a, without the addition of Mg, the photocurrent density of Ta3N5 at 1.6 VRHE is ∼3 mA cm−2. Such high performance can be ascribed to the fact that the 1D nanostructures provide effective hole transport pathways to improve the carrier collection efficiency.34 More importantly, relative to pure Ta3N5, all of the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorods exhibit lower onset potentials and higher current densities (Fig. S5, ESI†). The optimal nanorods, 5% Mg-Ta3N5, exhibit the lowest onset potential of 0.9 VRHE at the current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and the highest current density of ∼1.5 mA cm−2 at the 1.23 VRHE. To our knowledge, the PEC performance of 5% Mg-Ta3N5 is higher than those of recently reported Ta3N5 photoanodes without modification with an OEC.16,17,19,28,34 Fig. S6, ESI† shows that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) peaks increased with increasing Mg doping levels. Thus, the lower PEC performance at the doping content beyond 5% may be due to the lower crystallinity of Mg-doped Ta3N5. In addition, surface segregation may occur at high Mg doping levels due to the fact that the ionic radius of Mg2+ (72 pm) is 12% larger than that of Ta5+ (64 pm). The composition segregation could increase undesirable charge recombination and reduce the PEC activity of Mg-doped Ta3N5.

3.3 Role of Mg-doping in enhancing the PEC performance
To gain further insight into the influence of Mg doping on the PEC activity of Ta3N5, the flat-band potential (Vfb) and carrier density (ND) at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface were determined by the Mott–Schottky (M–S) equation.35 As shown in Fig. 3b, the positive slopes of the M–S plots suggest that Mg doping in Ta3N5 maintains its n-type semiconductor nature. The Vfb values for both Ta3N5 and 5% Mg-Ta3N5 are ∼0.12 ± 0.02 VRHE, extracted from the M–S plots. In addition, the electron density of 5% Mg-Ta3N5 is calculated to be 8.33 × 1019 cm−3 at the frequency of 1000 Hz, nearly 4 times more than 2.09 × 1019 cm−3 for pure Ta3N5. The ND of pure Ta3N5 is similar to the reported value for un-doped Ta3N5.10 Considering that the increased ND can increase the electrical conductivity and facilitate charge transfer in Ta3N5, Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were recorded under illumination at open-circuit potential (OCP) to access the kinetics of charge transfer. As seen in Fig. 3c, the Nyquist plot of 5% Mg-Ta3N5 has a much smaller impedance arc radius than that of pure Ta3N5, indicating a smaller charge transfer resistance and faster interfacial charge transport in 5% Mg-Ta3N5. The good charge transfer behavior of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5 was further supported by OCP decay analyses, using the equation of ,36 where E represents OCP at any time (V), Elight represents the photo-stationary OCP value, Edark represents the dark-stationary OCP value, and Kr represents the pseudo-first order recombination rate constant (s−1). The OCP transient decay can offer a direct evaluation of the photogenerated electrons getting trapped at the surface. Generally, a longer transient decay time reflects a lower recombination rate. As seen in Fig. 3d, the transient OCP curve of 5% Mg-Ta3N5 shows a substantially slower decay compared to Ta3N5, indicating that Mg doping indeed retarded the carrier recombination.
Generally, Mg2+ acts as an electron acceptor in the crystal of Ta3N5. However, the aliovalent substitution of Mg2+ for Ta5+ concurrently causes N3−/O2− replacement, forming abundant oxygen impurity (ON) defects. The ON in Ta3N5 has been regarded as the main shallow donor defects below the conduction band, and electrons at these shallow donor states have a high mobility.26,37 High electron mobility is beneficial for charge separation, as the electron–hole recombination is hindered.23 Therefore, Mg doping substantially modifies the charge transport of Ta3N5 by forming shallow donor levels, which promote the electron–hole separation and extend the carrier lifetime. Then, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were employed to confirm the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 3e, a PL peak centered at ∼600 nm was observed and can be assigned to the band–band recombination of Ta3N5. The 5% Mg-Ta3N5 exhibits an over 50% decrease in PL peak intensity compared to pure Ta3N5, indicative of a lower electron–hole recombination rate.38,39
On the basis of the above results, a possible mechanism for highly active Mg-Ta3N5 photocatalysts is shown in Fig. 3f. In general, foreign elements are doped into the semiconductor to form a specific defect structure and thus can tailor the physicochemical properties of the target semiconductor. In terms of Ta3N5, by the substitutions of Ta5+ with low valent ions of Mg2+, shallow donor levels (ON) are created due to the requirement of the charge balance. The ON in Ta3N5 has been regarded as the main shallow donor defects below the conduction band, which can provide an efficient charge transfer channel. At low applied potentials (below 0.8 VRHE), the built-in potential of the depletion region can separate the photogenerated charges but is not large enough to enable the totally spatial separation of initially generated electrons and holes. Under the dark equilibrium state, the surface states of 5% Mg-Ta3N5, ON levels, may be filled fully by electrons. The electrons trapped in surface states will be extracted gradually with increasing the applied potentials. A relatively low applied potential is not large enough to extract a large amount of electrons from the surface states, probably due to the slow electron transfer kinetics at the ON levels. The partially emptied surface states can trap a small amount of photogenerated electrons. The unsatisfactory charge separation from the small built-in potential and weak electron trapping by surface states may explain that the Mg doping has little effect on the onset potential of Ta3N5. At high applied potentials (above 0.8 VRHE), the built-in potentials are large enough to accelerate the charge separation and the photogenerated electrons trapped into the surface states were intensified due to the totally emptied surface states which can receive more electrons, hence increasing the charge separation efficiency and prolonging the charge lifetime, thus affording improved PEC activity of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5 photoanode.
3.4 Electrodeposition of Co OEC on Mg-Ta3N5
The self-oxidation of Ta3N5 caused by photogenerated holes is a critical challenge hindering its long-term performance. Thus, in an effort to further improve and stabilize the PEC performance of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5 photoanode, Co(OH)2 was electrodeposited on Ta3N5 and in situ electrochemically converted to CoOOH as an OEC to make maximum use of surface-reaching holes. Electrodeposition of Co(OH)2 on the Mg-Ta3N5 was realized by a multi-step potentiostatic method. On the basis of linear sweep voltammetric data (Fig. 4a), an initial nucleation step was conducted at E = −1.05 V versus Ag/AgCl to initialize the formation of small seed particles (Fig. S2, ESI†), followed by a slow crystal growth step for the desired time (typically 5 s, 10 s or 20 s) at a less negative potential (E = −0.85 V versus Ag/AgCl). The prenucleation step to form a uniform crystal seed layer was essentially important for achieving homogeneous deposition of Co(OH)2 onto photoanodes.
 Fig. 4  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry curves were recorded on pure Ta3N5 and 5% Mg-Ta3N5 photoanodes in a 0.01 M cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate solution (pH 5.5). The scan rate was 30 mV s−1. (b) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves obtained for 5% Mg-Ta3N5/Co(OH)2 (10 s) photoanodes at a 300 mV s−1 scan rate in 1 M NaOH.

Conversion of Co(OH)2 to CoOOH can be easily achieved by electrochemical oxidation.40 To fully oxidize the Co(OH)2 film to CoOOH, the photoanodes were electrochemically scanned in a potential window of 0.2 to 1.6 VRHE at a 300 mV s−1 scan rate for several cycles in 1 M NaOH solution until they reached a stable current curve. As shown in Fig. 4b, the anodic peaks of A1 (∼1.1 to 1.2 VRHE) and A2 (∼1.3 to 1.4 VRHE) are assigned to the oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III) and Co(III) to Co(IV), respectively.40

Fig. 4c shows the high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra of the as-deposited material before CV scanning. The Co 2p XPS spectrum shows two major peaks, ∼781.3 eV for Co 2p3/2 and ∼797.0 eV for Co 2p1/2, and the binding energies of both the two peaks are consistent with the characteristics of Co2+ in Co(OH)2. The Co 2p XPS spectrum also exhibits two small satellite peaks located at higher binding energies, ∼785.8 eV for Co 2p3/2,sat and ∼803.3 eV for Co 2p1/2,sat, which can be ascribed to multiplet splitting or shake-up processes associated with Co2+.41 After CV scanning (Fig. 4d), the Co 2p3/2 binding energy and Co 2p1/2–Co 2p3/2 splitting shifted from 781.3 and 16.3 eV for Co(OH)2 to 780.4 and 15.1 eV, and their satellite peaks disappeared. These obvious changes in Co 2p XPS peaks indicate that the oxidation state of Co is 3+ and the cobalt containing surface active species are CoOOH.42 The TEM image of 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) detached from the photoanode shown in Fig. 4e indicates that the entire surface of the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorod is covered by a highly conformal layer of CoOOH having a mean thickness of about 5 nm, which would be beneficial to efficiently extract photogenerated holes and suppress self-oxidation as well as enhance the PEC performance of the Mg-Ta3N5. HRTEM observations of a Co-containing coating layer did not reveal the crystal lattice image (Fig. 4f), suggesting that the Co-based catalysts are amorphous.
3.5 PEC performance of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH photoanodes
The PEC behaviors of the CoOOH and Co(OH)2 modified Mg-Ta3N5 were studied by current–potential curves analysis. As shown in Fig. S7, ESI,† an obvious oxidation peak at 1.15 VRHE, which originated from the oxidation of Co2+ into Co3+, was observed in Co(OH)2 modified Mg-Ta3N5. Usually, a phase transformation from Co(OH)2 into CoOOH occurs during a positive-going potential scanning. This means that depositing Co(OH)2 on Ta3N5 will induce a capacitance current due to its phase transformation, which may decrease the OER kinetics compared to CoOOH. Then, the effect of the electrodeposited CoOOH catalysts on the PEC water oxidation of the Mg-Ta3N5 nanorod photoanode was evaluated by comparing the photocurrent generation under back-side illumination. As seen in Fig. S8, ESI,† the photocurrent density was dependent on the electrodeposition time of Co species. The photocurrent density first increased and then decreased when the electrodeposition time of Co species was varied from 5 s to 20 s. Considering that 20 s electrodeposition of Co species led to an obvious undesired photo-oxidation current of Co species at ∼1.15 VRHE,20 the best photoanode configuration was obtained by 10 s electrodeposition of Co species (denoted as 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s)). The photocurrent density increased significantly from 1.5 mA cm−2 for 5% Mg-Ta3N5 to 6.5 mA cm−2 for 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) at 1.23 VRHE, and the onset potential from 0.9 VRHE negatively shifted to 0.6 VRHE (defined as the potential where the photoanodic current reaches 0.2 mA cm−2), suggesting that our OEC was particularly robust for extracting holes and promoting water oxidation (Fig. 5a). The photocurrent density of 6.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE was also further confirmed by a photocurrent–time test, which excludes the effect of capacitive current (Fig. S9, ESI†). The faradaic efficiency of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) photoanode for H2 and O2 evolution at 1.23 VRHE was 96% and 88%, respectively, verifying that the photocurrent mainly originated from the water splitting (Fig. 5e). IPCE measurements were further performed to disclose the function of the electrodeposited OEC (Fig. 5b). The result demonstrates that the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) shows about 5 times higher IPCE than the 5% Mg-Ta3N5, with the IPCE value exceeding 50% for the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH photoanode in the entire wavelength range from 380 to 470 nm. Apparently, the CoOOH cocatalyst was helpful to promote efficient charge separation and collection at the surface of the Ta3N5 photoanode. This is also evident in injection efficiency analysis (Fig. 5c), whereby a more pronounced increase of surface injection efficiency is noticed in 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH than in pristine Mg-Ta3N5. For example, the coupling of CoOOH enhanced the injection efficiency from 20 to 50% at the potential of 1.0 VRHE. In the high applied potential region (above 1.2 VRHE), the injection efficiency of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH nanorods reached as high as 80%. The increased charge injection would alleviate the charge recombination at the semiconductor–electrocatalyst–electrolyte interfaces, contributing to the high PEC performance.43 Furthermore, half-cell solar-to hydrogen (HC–STH) conversion efficiencies for the pure Ta3N5 and 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) photoanodes were plotted as a function of applied potential (Fig. 5f), using the current–potential curves shown in Fig. 2a and 5a. The maximum HC–STH conversion efficiency for 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) was as high as 0.78% at 1.02 VRHE.

(c) Injection efficiency for 5% Mg-Ta3N5 and 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) nanorod photoanodes. (d) Time-course photocurrent density curves of the pure Ta3N5, 5% Mg-Ta3N5 (inset) and 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) nanorod photoanodes in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution (pH 13.6) under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) illumination at 1.0 VRHE. (e) Oxygen and hydrogen evolution measurements of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) nanorod photoanode in 1 M NaOH solution with an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE under 500 W Xe lamp irradiation. (f) HC–STH conversion efficiencies of the 5% Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH (10 s) and pure Ta3N5 photoanodes. 
To exclude the difference between the simulated AM 1.5G light source and the real solar spectrum, the solar photocurrent was calculated by integrating IPCE with the standard solar spectrum following Grätzel's method.44 The integrated photocurrent of 6.2 mA cm−2 (Fig. S10, ESI†) was very close to the measured value of 6.5 mA cm−2, confirming that the employed light source precisely simulated the AM 1.5G solar emission in the absorption wavelength range of the Ta3N5 electrode, and the IPCE values as well as photocurrent under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight are credible.
The stability of the photoanode was also significantly optimized after loading CoOOH (Fig. 5d). For pure Ta3N5 and Mg-doped Ta3N5, the photocurrent would rapidly decay to a negligible level within the first few minutes of water splitting reactions. It had been discussed previously in detail that the poor stability is related to the photocorrosion of Ta3N5.13 Once CoOOH was introduced on the Mg-Ta3N5, our optimal photoanode exhibits a steady photocurrent of ∼2.5 mA cm−2 (about 70% retention of the initial photocurrent) reliably at 1.0 VRHE for at least 70 min of irradiation. Though Co is an acknowledged OEC with high activity,8 electrodeposited CoOOH on Ta3N5 surfaces here displayed a much higher duration than previously reported in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution for Ta3N5 photoanodes.16,34,45,46 The greatly enhanced stability was ascribed to the conformal coverage of CoOOH on the photoanode surfaces, which efficiently improves the extraction and transfer of photogenerated holes away from the Ta3N5 surface and prevents photocorrosion.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, Mg-doped Ta3N5 nanorod photoanodes are fabricated and used for PEC water oxidation. Benefiting from the shortened charge collection distance by the nanostructure and the improved bulk charge transfer by Mg doping inducing oxygen-impurity donors, the Ta3N5 photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. This is the highest photocurrent among those reported for Ta3N5 nanorod photoanodes without modification with an OEC. Subsequent modification with an electrodeposited CoOOH OEC further promotes the photoanode activity, achieving an onset potential of 0.6 VRHE and a photocurrent of 6.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Moreover, the photoanode achieves a steady photocurrent of ∼2.5 mA cm−2 (about 70% retention of the initial photocurrent) reliably at 1.0 VRHE for at least 70 min irradiation. The demonstration of the Mg-Ta3N5/CoOOH photoanodes here with excellent PEC water splitting performance will provide useful guidance for the design and fabrication of highly active (oxy)nitride photocatalysts for PEC cell applications.
