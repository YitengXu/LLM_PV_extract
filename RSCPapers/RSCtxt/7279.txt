    , Accepted 3rd November 2017First published on 6th November 2017AbstractAiming at high-efficiency biomimetic CO2 photoelectrochemical conversion, a photoelectrocatalyst with excellent CO2 catalytic activity was designed and prepared by immobilizing CoTPP (cobalt meso-tetraphenylporphyrin) onto g-C3N4 conveniently via self-assembly based on π–π supramolecular interaction. The quasi 3-D structure of CoTPP showed a suitable hole with a size of 3.8 Å × 9.6 Å which favoured CO2 adsorption. The pores formed by the π–π stacking of CoTPP and g-C3N4 also provided additional space for CO2 adsorption, which was confirmed by the appearance of a desorption peak at 250 °C in the temperature programmed desorption measurement for CoTPP/g-C3N4. As a normal efficient homogeneous catalyst in organic media, CoTPP commendably maintained outstanding CO2 photoelectrocatalytic activity in heterogeneous aqueous solution, even at a low overpotential of −0.6 V (vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE). Under 8 h PEC CO2 reduction, formic acid generation on CoTPP/g-C3N4 reached 154.4 μmol with a TON of 137 and high selectivity of nearly 100% in liquid products. The formation of CoTPP–COO− and CoTPP–COOH intermediates by the Co(II) active site and CO2 was investigated by in situ UV-vis and Raman spectra. Moreover, an isotopic labelling experiment indicated that water supplied abundant protons for the production of formic acid.
Introduction
With the rapid development of industry, the world is currently suffering from an accelerated depletion of fossil fuel resources (such as coal, petroleum and natural gas) due to the steady growth in the demand for energy, and which has consequently caused an increase in greenhouse gas (especially CO2) emission.1,2 CO2 conversion to value-added energy and chemical feedstocks (such as CO, formic acid, methanol and so on) has attracted more and more attention. Undoubtedly speaking, artificial electrochemical and photochemical CO2 reduction represents a green approach for energy storage and carbon recycling due to the mild reaction conditions and low energy consumption.3–6
Natural photosynthesis is the most efficient approach to convert CO2 into organic compounds through two photosystem processes (PS I and PS II) on the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast due to the excellent photosensitivity of metal porphyrin compounds.7 Hence, imitating or replicating bio-systems at the molecular level is a promising biomimetic approach for novel artificial systems.8,9 In recent decades, metal organic molecular catalysts have attracted more and more attention due to high selectivity and conversion efficiency in biomimetic photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction.10,11 Metal porphyrin compounds are one of the typical compounds which not only display photocatalytic activity but also electrocatalytic activity.12,13 As is well known, porphyrin compounds contain a large conjugate π bond because of their alternating CC and CN bonds.14 The conjugated π bond causes excellent solar harvesting performance, which accordingly results in outstanding photosensitization performance.15 The four-coordinated metal ion loaded in the center of metal–porphyrin could activate CO2 and insert it into the d orbital of the metal ion to produce a five-coordinated metal–CO2 adduct.16 The metal–CO2 adduct was further reduced to produce the CO2 reduction product. The process exhibited excellent CO2 photo-/electrochemical catalytic performance. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of metal–porphyrin could be regulated by metal ion alteration and organic structure modification.17,18 In accordance with the structure and function, employing a similar strategy, it should be possible to use solar irradiation to convert CO2 and water into an energy-rich product via artificial photosynthesis.
Generally speaking, the metal–organic complex molecular catalyst (such as metal–porphyrin complex) usually showed high efficiency only in homogeneous organic solution while being inactivated in aqueous solution due to the lower solubility.19 But, in homogeneous photocatalytic reactions, the two primary problems of metal–porphyrin molecular catalysts that must be faced were the obvious photocorrosion caused by the instability of metal–organic compounds and the optical opacity caused by the deep color of the solution.20 These two disadvantages further resulted in low efficiency in CO2 reduction under photo-catalytic conditions. Meanwhile, the free radicals formed by molecular catalysts were the crucial intermediate for CO2 reduction, but the dimerization of radicals as a competing reaction caused the inactivation of the catalyst both in homogeneous photocatalytic reaction and in electrocatalytic reaction.21,22 Furthermore, synthetically considering the potential un-recyclability, extra addition of an organic supporting electrolyte and extra electron donors in homogeneous organic catalytic systems, heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysts in aqueous solutions would be more advantageous over molecular-based homogeneous catalysts.23 Moreover the heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic system favored large-scale application and efficient solar energy utilization.
From the viewpoint of the conjugated structural features of porphyrin, it is a reasonable strategy to combine a molecular catalyst on a semiconductor with a similar structure by π–π supramolecular interaction.24,25 Among numerous semiconductor materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a two-dimensional (2-D) polymeric semiconductor with alternating CN and C–N structure, conjugated electrode distribution, metal-free composition and stable catalytic performance has stimulated the interest of many scientists.26,27 At present, g-C3N4 has been developed for multifaceted applications, such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, etc.28–30 g-C3N4 can be synthesized conveniently through the calcination of nitrogen-rich and cost-affordable precursors such as urea and thiourea.31–33 More importantly, due to the large specific surface area and 2-D planar conjugation structure, g-C3N4 was considered a suitable substrate material to combine a catalyst which was equipped with abundant π electrons.34,35 Furthermore, the porous structure was also beneficial for CO2 biomimetic adsorption due to the high surface area.36 In photocatalytic systems, g-C3N4 was a distinctive photosensitizer even in the visible light region, attributed to the smaller band gap (2.7 eV), but the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 was still not satisfactory due to the high recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.37 Therefore, it is commendable to immobilize the metal–porphyrin molecules on g-C3N4 by the self-assembly of π–π supramolecular interaction to adjust the charge distribution in the semiconductor structures due to the similar structure of the two components.38,39 The photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the composite photoelectrocatalyst could increase due to the efficient separation of the excited electrons and holes within the interfacial area.40,41
Herein, aiming at the construction of a biomimetic photoelectrocatalyst for CO2 reduction with better performance, a g-C3N4 nanosheet combined Co–porphyrin (CoTPP/g-C3N4) photoelectrocatalyst based on π–π supramolecular self-assembly was prepared and used for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. X-ray single crystal structure showed that CoTPP was in favor of CO2 fixing and activation because of its quasi 3-D polyporous structure. The density functional theory (DFT) optimized adsorptive mode further confirmed the CO2 activation potential. The photoelectrocatalyst showed an excellent visible-light response due to the synergistic effect of the photosensitivity of the two components. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometric i–t in CO2 saturated aqueous solution exhibited the distinguished CO2 reduction ability of CoTPP/g-C3N4. In particular, the amperometric i–t response indicated that the light on/off caused current increment of CoTPP/g-C3N4 in a CO2-saturated solution was 2.8 times that in an N2-saturated solution, showing outstanding CO2 reduction performance. Furthermore, in situ UV-vis spectra and Raman spectra were employed to investigate the plausible CO2 reduction mechanism. Isotopic measurements in D2O were used to study the proton source during the biomimetic CO2 conversion process.
Experimental section
Preparation of CoTPP molecular catalyst and g-C3N4
CoTPP was prepared according to the literature procedures.42 Generally, to a solution of TPP (614.2 mg, 1.0 mmol) in EtOH (10 mL) was added anhydrous Co(NO3)2 (287.1 g, 1.0 mmol) under the protection of N2. The mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 4 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. The residue was washed with ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum to give a purple solid (850.7 mg, yield: 94.4%).
According to the literature procedure,43,44 urea was used to synthesize g-C3N4 by direct thermal poly-condensation. General procedure: 10 g of urea powder was added to an alumina crucible with a cover, and then heated to 500 °C with a rising rate of 3 °C min−1 and held for 4 h in a semi-closed environment. Bulk forming faint-yellow polymeric g-C3N4 was obtained after cooling down to room temperature naturally. The as-synthesized light yellow g-C3N4 powder was used directly in the following process.
Preparation of CoTPP/g-C3N4 photocathode
The prepared g-C3N4 was immobilized on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) as a substrate electrode. Generally, to a suspension of g-C3N4 (50 mg) in acetone (50 mL) was added I2 (10 mg) under stirring. The mixture was then ultrasonicated for 5 min to give the electrolyte solution. The additional iodine gave H+ by reaction with acetone and g-C3N4 was positively charged. FTO and a Pt plate were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. They were immersed in the solution in parallel at a distance of 1.5 cm, and 15 V of voltage was applied for 25 min using a DC power supply. The electrode was used after calcination at 500 °C for 30 min under the protection of N2. The amount of g-C3N4 deposited on FTO was determined to be 1.7 mg cm−2. The CoTPP/g-C3N4 photocathode was prepared by dipping g-C3N4 loaded FTO in a solution of dichloromethane containing CoTPP. The maximum adsorption amount of CoTPP onto g-C3N4 was about 6% (Experiment, ESI†).
Chemical and structural characterization
The morphology of the as-prepared g-C3N4 was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan). Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) measurements were performed using an AutoChem II 2920 instrument (Micromeritics) to evaluate CO2 desorption. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-7000) was employed to characterize the steady-state fluorescence spectra of g-C3N4. Absorption spectra were obtained by using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis, Agilent 8453). X-ray data of suitable single crystals were collected at 293(2) K with a Rigaku Weissenbery IP diffractometer and graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation [λ(Mo-Kα) = 0.71069 Å]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out on a Kratos ASIS-HS X-ray photoelectron spectroscope equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al Kα) operating at 150 W (15 kV, 10 mA). All the binding energy values for the high-resolution spectra were calibrated with the signal of contaminated carbon C 1s at 284.8 eV. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. Methanol was detected with a Thermo GCMS (a ThermoFisher 310 GC system with a TSQ Quantum XLS Mass Selective detector equipped with an automatic sampling device) by headspace analysis. Sample aliquots were preheated at 90 °C in a 20 mL headspace vial with a septa cap, and 2.5 mL of the headspace gas was injected from a syringe heated to 95 °C and analyzed in the GCMS instrument.
All PEC measurements were performed on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA) using a conventional three-electrode system with the as-prepared electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter-electrode in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution. For the convenience of discussion, all the potentials were converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The electrochemical system was composed of a standard two compartment electrolysis cell to separate the cathode and anode reactions for controlled potential CO2 reduction, and 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. The amperometric i–t curve was obtained with an interval of 200 s for light on/off at the light intensity of 20 mW cm−2 at a constant potential of −1.0 V (light source: LA-410UV, Hayashi, Japan).
PEC reduction of CO2 and product detection
The PEC reduction of CO2 was carried out in a typical 3-electrode-system in a 100 mL homemade double-chamber reactor divided with a proton exchange membrane. Typically, 100 mL of 0.1 M KCl solution was used as the electrolyte solution. The as-prepared CoTPP/g-C3N4 working electrode and the Ag/AgCl (filled with saturated KCl) reference electrode were placed in the cathodic chamber, while a graphite plate counter-electrode (4 × 1 cm2) was placed in the anodic chamber. Before reduction, KCl aqueous solution was bubbled with high purity CO2 (99.99%) gas for 40 min at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 to remove the dissolved oxygen completely. Under such conditions, CO2 reached saturation in the electrolyte. The potential during the PEC reduction was kept constant at −0.6 V under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation (light source: PLS-SXE300 xenon lamp, Beijing Perfect Light Co., Ltd, China, with an AM 1.5 filter). Note that ultrapure water with its conductivity reaching 18.2 MΩ cm was used for the preparation of all the solutions.
The products in the aqueous phase were determined by Nash's reagent method. The Nash reagent was prepared by adding 25.0 g of ammonium acetate, 2.1 mL of acetic acid and 0.2 mL of acetyl acetone into water and making the total volume of the solution up to 100 mL. Then 2.0 mL of the liquid sample was mixed with 2.0 mL of fresh Nash reagent and stirred for 1 h at 60 °C. The final solution was analysed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the absorbance at 413 nm was used for the quantification of formaldehyde.
For the quantification of formic acid, magnesium chips (50 mg) were added into 0.5 mL of the liquid sample followed by the dropwise addition of 0.5 mL 37% hydrochloric acid (10 M) at 0 °C in 10 min. Then 3 mL sodium hydroxide (1 M) was added to the above mixture. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (2 mL) was mixed with 2 mL of fresh Nash reagent and stirred for 1 h at 60 °C for UV-Vis analysis to determine the total amount of formaldehyde. Formic acid can be determined after subtracting the amount of formaldehyde in the total formaldehyde.
A headspace GCMS was used to detect the production of methanol. A chromatographic column (SHRX105MS, 30 m length and 0.5 mm inner diameter) at an oven temperature of 40 °C was employed in combination with an MS detector at 230 °C and helium was used as the carrier gas. Detection at m/z = 31 was chosen to identify methanol as the reaction product. The samples were preheated at 90 °C in a 20 mL headspace vial with a septa cap, and 1.0 mL of the headspace gas was injected from a syringe heated to 90 °C and analysed in the GC/MS instrument. To detect methane, CO and other gaseous products, a thermal couple detector (TCD) and a 5 Å molecular filled column equipped Shimadzu GC2014 gas chromatogram was employed.
Results and discussion
Biomimetic CO2 adsorption on the photoelectrocatalyst
As is well known, CO2 adsorption is the first step in biomimetic CO2 reduction. To investigate the biomimetic CO2 adsorption on Co–porphyrin complex intuitively, the structure of CoTPP was analysed based on single-crystal information (the crystal data and structure refinement for CoTPP are listed in Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 1a, the Co(II) complex is a centrosymmetric structure with the Co(II) ion located at the centre of the metal–organic complex. The Co(II) ion and four coordination N atoms give a Co–N4 coplanar structure with the Co–N distance of 1.961(2) Å. The symmetrical 4 phenyl like paddles are perpendicular to the porphyrin cycle. Due to the paddle-shaped phenyls, a quasi-2 dimensional laminar structure was formed based on the π–π supramolecular interaction of the phenyls in adjacent molecules due to the appropriate distance. More importantly, a quasi-3 dimensional structure was generated due to the two neighbouring quasi-2 dimensional layers stacking face to face based on the π–π supramolecular interaction of the two porphyrin cycles. Precisely because of the formation of the quasi-3 dimensional stereo structure, appropriate holes with the cross-section of 3.8 Å × 9.6 Å were formed which were slightly larger than the CO2 molecule. As shown in Fig. 1b, the holes favoured CO2 biomimetic fixing and activation which was attributed to the Co–O interaction.18 As the CO2 molecule was adsorbed in the hole, the Co(II) coordination centre provided the active site for CO2 adsorption. To further investigate the CO2 adsorption onto CoTPP, an adsorption model was established by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/LanL2DZ/6-31G(d, p) level.45 As shown in Fig. 1c and d, DFT calculation results indicated that the electron cloud distribution of CoTPP primarily focused on the porphyrin cycle. The electronegative O atom of the linear CO2 molecule could insert into the d orbital of the Co atom through the coordination bond that benefited from the electron cloud distribution. The electron cloud was redistributed in the CO2 adsorption model because of the interaction of CO2 and CoTPP. As shown in Fig. 1e, the DFT optimized adsorption model revealed that the linear CO2 molecule was adsorbed onto CoTPP with the angle at 110.02°. Fig. 1f shows the electron cloud distribution after CO2 was adsorbed onto CoTPP. Different from that in pure CoTPP, the electron cloud distribution of CoTPP adsorbed with CO2 was focused on the Co(II) ion and CO2, indicating that the electrons transfer from CoTPP to CO2 for CO2 reduction.46

Similar to natural photosynthesis, a porous substrate for CO2 enrichment was also pivotal in biomimetic CO2 adsorption. Based on the structural properties of CoTPP, a substrate equipped with a π–π supramolecular effect was much more helpful to combine with CoTPP. Among multitudinous semiconductor catalysts, g-C3N4 was one such porous metal-free polymeric semiconductor with N-bridged tri-s-triazine units and was composed of conjugate NC–N bonds. The microscopic morphologies of the as-prepared g-C3N4 were examined using TEM. As depicted in Fig. S1,† pure g-C3N4 displayed a 2D structure of several tens of hundreds of nanometers. Upon acid pretreatment of pure g-C3N4, exfoliated g-C3N4 presented a thin layered structure without obvious bulk domains of g-C3N4. g-C3N4 showed a smooth nanosheet microscopic morphology and the post-accumulative g-C3N4 exhibited a porous structure as shown in Fig. S1c.† Meanwhile, CoTPP also showed a 2-D stratified structure of several decades of nanometers. As a result, the stratified CoTPP could be easily adsorbed onto the g-C3N4 nanosheet (as shown in Fig. S1e & f†) with π–π interaction. As g-C3N4 was a porous material with a layered structure, the specific surface areas of the prepared samples were investigated using nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of g-C3N4, CoTPP and CoTPP/g-C3N4 samples are displayed in Fig. 2a and the specific surface areas and pore sizes of all samples are summarized in Table S2.† The calculated specific surface areas of the samples were ∼72.83 m2 g−1 for g-C3N4, 23.36 m2 g−1 for CoTPP and 52.61 m2 g−1 for CoTPP/g-C3N4. The BJH adsorption pore volume decreased from 0.36 cm3 g−1 to 0.33 cm3 g−1 and the pore diameter increased from 19.68 nm to 25.84 nm after CoTPP was loaded on g-C3N4.

The porous morphologies of g-C3N4 can provide a high specific surface area available for CO2 enrichment, theoretically.47 Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was employed to further investigate CO2 adsorption. As shown in Fig. 2b, the CO2 desorption behaviours appeared at ∼330 °C (30 min) for CoTPP and ∼180 °C (15 min) for g-C3N4 indicating that it was more difficult to remove CO2 from the surface of CoTPP than g-C3N4. This reflected the fact that CoTPP had much stronger adsorption ability than g-C3N4 which may be caused by the robust interaction between the Co(II) ion and CO2. Just as shown in Fig. 1b, CO2 could be adsorbed by two Co(II) ions originating from the neighboring CoTPP layer. After CoTPP was fixed on the surface of g-C3N4, the CO2 desorption performance of CoTPP/g-C3N4 not only combined the two desorption behaviours of the two components, but also produced an additional desorption peak at ∼250 °C (22 min). The desorption temperature was between 330 °C for CoTPP and 180 °C (15 min) for g-C3N4 which may be caused by CO2 insertion into the hole between CoTPP and layered g-C3N4 based on π–π supramolecular interaction.
Due to the π–π stacking interaction, CoTPP/g-C3N4 as a composite catalyst inherited the properties of the two components. As shown in Fig. 2c, the XRD patterns of CoTPP, g-C3N4 and CoTPP/g-C3N4 indicated the recombination maintaining the crystal structure of the two components. The samples of g-C3N4 and CoTPP/g-C3N4 showed two diffraction peaks at around 13.18 and 27.68° clearly, which can well correspond to the (100) and (002) crystal planes, respectively, of hexagonal g-C3N4. The (100) crystal planes related to the interplanar structural packing and the (002) crystal plane reflected the characteristic interlayer stacking of interlayer structural aromatic rings.48 For CoTPP, the diffraction peaks at around 19.18, 22.35, 25.20 and 32.71° corresponded to the different crystal planes of tetragonal CoTPP. All the diffraction peaks of CoTPP and g-C3N4 were reflected on the CoTPP/g-C3N4 hybrid material. The FT-IR and Raman spectra also indicated that CoTPP/g-C3N4 inherited the properties of the two components (Fig. S2 & S3, ESI†). The bands in the range of 1200–1650 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching mode of C–N heterocycles in both CoTPP and g-C3N4. The absorption band at 810 cm−1 was assigned to the breathing mode of triazine heterocycles. The bands of CoTPP/g-C3N4 and pure g-C3N4 at 3300 cm−1 can be attributed to the primary amine group on the surface. In the Raman spectra of g-C3N4, the broadened band centred at 1535 cm−1 originates from the overlap of the G bands of g-C3N4.49,50
Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted (as shown in Fig. 3) to examine the chemical composition and chemical status of the constituent elements in the g-C3N4 and CoTPP/g-C3N4 samples. Referring to Fig. 3a, the XPS survey spectra depicts that C, N and Co elements were detected on the CoTPP/g-C3N4 sample while no Co element was detected on the pure g-C3N4 sample, indicating the loading of CoTPP on g-C3N4. The peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 were located at 780.1 and 795.5 eV, respectively, along with the presence of the two strong satellite peaks of cobalt at 785.1 and 802.7 eV, indicating the presence of Co(II) in CoTPP/g-C3N4, without the formation of any other oxidation state.51–53 The peaks at 284.8 and 288.2 eV were assigned to the CN coordination and sp2-hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN), respectively. The N 1s spectra shown in Fig. 3d can be deconvoluted into four peaks. The peaks centred at 398.9 and 401.7 eV are derived from the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms in CN–C groups and the amino function groups, respectively.54 The peak at around 402.6 eV was attributed to the charging effects or positive charge localization in heterocycles, while that at 400.5 eV is attributed to the tertiary nitrogen in N–C3 groups or in H–N–C2.55,56

Excellent photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction activity
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) measurement was used to investigate the optical properties of CoTPP, g-C3N4, and CoTPP/g-C3N4 (Fig. 4a). As a classic photocatalytic material with excellent UV-vis absorption performance, the band edge of g-C3N4 was located at about 450 nm, which was attributed to the alternating conjugated CN structure. The corresponding energy gap was 2.7 eV based on the Kubelka–Munk relation (Fig. S4, ESI†). Meanwhile, CoTPP also displayed excellent UV-visible light absorption properties due to the conjugated π system with the absorption edge expanding to 700 nm. In CoTPP/g-C3N4, the excellent UV-visible light absorption properties of the two components were well retained to benefit photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Conditions: 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution as a supporting electrolyte, 50 mV s−1 scan rate, CoTPP/g-C3N4 loaded FTO as a working electrode (area: 0.25 cm2), Ag/AgCl (filled with saturated KCl aqueous solution) as a reference electrode, Pt wire as a counter electrode, at room temperature without irradiation. 
In order to testify the photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction capability, the potentiodynamic electrochemical behaviour of CO2 in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution was investigated (Fig. 4b). Without irradiation, no cathodic peak appeared in the N2-saturated solution but an obvious cathodic peak was detected at −1.05 V in the CO2-saturated solution, which was caused by the intrinsic CO2 reduction on g-C3N4. The cathodic peak was further strengthened under simulated solar irradiation due to the excellent photosensitivity of g-C3N4. After CoTPP was loaded on the surface of g-C3N4, the CO2 reduction potential positively shifted to −0.80 V without simulated solar irradiation. The 0.25 V positive shift was mainly caused by the contribution of the catalytic effect from CoTPP according to earlier research.57 Furthermore, the cathodic current increased obviously under solar irradiation which was attributed to the excellent photosensitivity of CoTPP. A similar consequence was also obtained from the cyclic voltammogram (CV) in CO2/N2-saturated KCl aqueous solution (Fig. S5, ESI†). After fixing CoTPP on the surface of g-C3N4, the cathodic current increased obviously and the reduction potential had a large positive shift. This indicated that the prepared photoelectron cathode displayed excellent CO2 catalytic reduction performance.
To further investigate the CO2 photoelectrocatalytic reduction performance, amperometric i–t curves for these electrodes under chopped light irradiation were also recorded as shown in Fig. 4c. The experiment was conducted at −0.8 V with a light on/off interval of 200 s in a CO2/N2-saturated 0.1 M KCl solution. In the N2-saturated solution, g-C3N4 caused a 5 μA cm−2 cathodic current increment attributed to the light harvesting of g-C3N4. The current increment increased to 15 μA cm−2 after CoTPP loading on the surface of g-C3N4, which indicated the distinctive visible light photosensitivity of CoTPP. With respect to the CO2-saturated solution, the current under light irradiation of the g-C3N4 photoelectrode was 26 μA cm−2, 3 times higher than that in an N2-saturated solution, indicating the good CO2 reduction ability. But the value was still much lower than that of CoTPP/g-C3N4 in the CO2-saturated solution. As shown by the pink line in Fig. 4c, the current increment of CoTPP/g-C3N4 under a CO2 atmosphere reached 73 μA cm−2, which further proved the excellent CO2 photoelectrocatalytic reduction performance of CoTPP/g-C3N4.
After 8 h of PEC CO2 reduction, only formic acid was detected in the final liquid phase and a trace of CO was detected in the final gas phase. As shown in Fig. 5, formic acid production increased persistently under the irradiation of simulated solar light even at a low potential (−0.6 V vs. NHE). After 8 hours of PEC reduction, formic acid production can reach 154.4 μmol with a TON of 137 (the equations for the TON and Faraday efficiency are given in the ESI†). The Faraday efficiency can reach 95.4% under such conditions. The time-dependent formic acid production showed that the amount of formic acid increased faster in the original two hours. The formic acid production was 110.2 μmol with a TON of 102 in the beginning two hours. This may be attributed to the higher concentration of CO2 and the preeminent catalytic ability of the catalyst in the original times. As shown in Table 1, to further evaluate the CO2 reduction performance of CoTPP/g-C3N4, a comparison of the CO2 reduction performance with literature reports such as those regarding metal–porphyrin compounds, carbon nitride and molecular catalytical systems was performed. The catalytic performance in our PEC system was not only superior to some other metal– porphyrin complex molecular catalysts based on PEC systems,58–61 but also higher than some noble metal–organic molecular catalytic systems.25,62,63

The formic acid generation following the changed potential was analyzed to investigate the function of potential in CO2 conversion (Fig. 5c). Without potential applied on the photocathode, the pure PC CO2 reduction process produced 39.4 μmol formic acid with a low TON (33.6). From the potential of −0.1 to −0.3 V (vs. NHE), the formic acid amount increased in a slow rate along with the increased potential. In this range, the PEC CO2 reduction was an electrochemically assisted photocatalysis process and the EC process didn't occur at such a low potential. This was consistent with the result of LSV in which the onset potential for CO2 reduction was −0.4 V. The electrons supplied by external potential mainly acted as the electron donor for the PC process. With the further increase of cathode potential, the increasing rate of formic acid production was obvious in the range of −0.4 V to −0.8 V. This indicated that the PEC CO2 reduction was in a photoelectric synergy stage. In this process, the electrode not only catalysed the EC conversion of CO2 directly under the assistance of light irradiation, but also functioned as the electron source for PC CO2 conversion. The LSV also indicated that the CO2 reduction peaks appeared at −0.8 V. But, the formic acid amount increased slowly again as the cathode potential exceeded −0.9 V. This was mainly due to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As the competing reaction, the HER immensely suppressed CO2 reduction after the potential reached the hydrogen-evolution condition (Fig. S6, ESI†).
The plausible CO2 catalytic reduction mechanism
In order to clarify the CO2 reduction mechanism and the electron transfer process, the energy level of CoTPP/g-C3N4 was firstly detected using the Mott–Schottky method.37 As shown in Fig. 6a, the Mott–Schottky plot was obtained in aqueous solution containing 0.1 M KCl at pH = 7.0 to estimate the LUMO for CoTPP (ELUMO) and the conduction band (CB) potential (ECB) for g-C3N4, respectively. It can be calculated from the tangent of the curve that the ELUMO of CoTPP and the ECB of g-C3N4 were −0.97 eV and −1.17 eV, respectively. The more negative CB potential caused the more effective CO2 reduction ability.66 The ELUMO of CoTPP or the ECB of g-C3N4 were more negative than most of the reduction potentials of CO2, indicating that both of the CoTPP and g-C3N4 possess excellent CO2 reduction capacity in theory. Furthermore, the band gap of CoTPP (2.96 eV) was calculated by DFT and that of g-C3N4 (2.7 eV, Fig. S4†) was calculated by the UV-vis DRS method. With regard to the charge transfer mechanism in CoTPP/g-C3N4, two processes may be involved (Fig. 6b). In process I, the photoinduced electrons of g-C3N4 migrated to the CB of CoTPP, while the photoexcited holes of CoTPP transferred to the valence band of g-C3N4; in process II, the photogenerated electrons of CoTPP recombined directly with the photogenerated holes of g-C3N4 through their interfaces (Z-scheme type). The two processes signified that CO2 reduction took place on two different materials.

(b) The possible electron transfer route of CoTPP/g-C3N4 in CO2 reduction; (c) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CoTPP, g-C3N4 and CoTPP/g-C3N4 samples; (d) decay curve of g-C3N4 and CoTPP/g-C3N4; PL was recorded with excitation at 370 nm and the decay curve was monitored at 450 nm. 
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra measurements were employed to further explain which process is the possible way during CO2 reduction. Under optical excitation at 370 nm wavelength, the PL emission peak of g-C3N4 centred at ∼450 nm, attributed to charge recombination (Fig. 6c). After CoTPP fixed on the surface of g-C3N4, the emission peak intensity of the resultant CoTPP/g-C3N4 was much weaker than that of g-C3N4 with the same weight, which suggested a weaker recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in CoTPP/g-C3N4. Because of the similar structural and electronic properties of the two components, the π–π interaction between porphyrin and g-C3N4 contributed to the “linkage” of CoTPP onto g-C3N4, which favored electron transfer between each other. Just due to the close linkage, the photoluminescence of CoTPP/g-C3N4 decreased obviously, which could be attributed to the efficient fluorescence quenching effect that was caused by the photogenerated electron transport from the excited g-C3N4 to the CoTPP molecular catalyst.36 Based on the above discussion, the CO2 reduction process tended to follow process I.
As a powerful technique, time-resolved diffuse reflectance (TDR) spectroscopic measurement was performed to clarify the charge carrier dynamics in the photocatalytic reaction under 400 nm light irradiation as shown in Fig. 6d. The average lifetime for g-C3N4 is about 4.28 ps, shorter than that for CoTPP/g-C3N4 (6.96 ps), which fully implied that the activated state in CoTPP/g-C3N4 was longer lived than that in g-C3N4. In Table 2, the lifetimes determined from the decay of the transient absorption at 450 nm assigned to the trapped electrons are summarized. Upon 400 nm laser excitation, the decay that occurred for g-C3N4 (τ1, 0.04 ps, 89.1%) was much faster than for CoTPP/g-C3N4 (τ1, 0.09 ps, 68.6%). This indicated that the vast majority of the photoelectrons quickly recombined with the holes in g-C3N4. When performed above 1 ps, a similar decay of g-C3N4 (τ2, 1.52 ps, 10.9%) and CoTPP/g-C3N4 (τ2, 1.74 ps, 31.4%) was observed because the trapped electrons escaped from geminate recombination and relaxed into deeper trap levels. The longer lifetimes of electrons were attributed to the remarkable separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.67

In the CO2-saturated solution, in situ UV-vis spectra were employed to further detect the probable intermediate in the CO2 reduction process. Firstly, the UV-vis spectra of CoTPP before and after CO2 blowing for 20 min were recorded. Compared with the spectrum before CO2 blowing, an absorption was observed at 435 nm in the CO2 saturated solution which was caused by the adsorption and binding of CO2 on CoTPP. Then, an increased absorption peak at 445 nm was detected (Fig. 7a) following UV-visible irradiation on CoTPP, which was attributed to the generation of the intermediate during CO2 reduction. The inset clearly shows that the absorption peak strengthened following the irradiation time. To further confirm which intermediate was produced, a simulated reaction was introduced using methyl chloroformate as the substitution for activated CO2. As shown in the steady UV-vis spectra, both TPP and CoTPP had absorption peaks at 445 nm attributed to the conjugated π–π structure of porphyrin while methyl chloroformate had no UV-vis absorption in this area. After 3 eq. of methyl chloroformate was added to the system, a new absorption peak at 440 nm appeared accompanied with the absorption peak at 400 nm weakening simultaneously. As is well known, methyl chloroformate can react with CoTPP spontaneously to generate a five coordinated compound (the structure is shown in the inset of Fig. 7b), whose absorption was at 440 nm precisely. So, the peak at 440 nm that appeared in in situ UV-vis spectra indicated that similar intermediates (Fig. 7c) were produced by CoTPP and active CO2. This was further confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, which was employed to investigate chemical bond formation during the CO2 catalytic reduction process.

(f) MS peak intensities at 1.876 min which indicated DCOOD generation. 
As shown in Fig. 7d, in the CO2-saturated solution, the bands at 423 cm−1 and 496 cm−1 were previously related to the rotation and vibration of the Co–C bond20,68 due to the active CO2 insertion into the centre metal of CoTPP. This proved the formation of a probable biomimetic fixing model intermediate A (CoTPP–COO−) and intermediate B (CoTPP–COOH). The Co–C bond vibration at 496 cm−1 was for intermediate A, which was lowered to 423 cm−1 for intermediate B.18 The bonds at 638 cm−1 and 753 cm−1 that appeared simultaneously with Co–C bond generation are probably attributable to the formation of –COO− and –COOH in the generated intermediate.17,18 The intensity of the three bonds increased with the reaction time. Both the Co–C bond and the COO− bond were generated due to the CO2 biomimetic adsorption onto CoTPP and CO2 fixing. By combining with the PL spectra, in situ UV-vis absorption and in situ Raman results, it could be inferred that the composite catalyst reduced CO2via electron trapping on the Co(II) site, which was similar to the case of the COF comprising Co–porphyrin.69 As CO2 was adsorbed onto the CoTPP site, CO2 reduction can occur to form formic acid by forming the intermediate illustrated above.
As is well known, natural photosynthesis requires the presence of water due to water supplying abundant protons. Similarly, biomimetic artificial CO2 reduction occurring in an aqueous solution will exhibit many advantages. To investigate the proton donor in formic acid production, isotopic measurements were conducted using D2O as the solvent in the CO2 reduction process.22 After 30 min, the headspace GC/MS analyses for the liquid aliquots was employed to detect the generation of formic acid. In the GC spectrum, the retention time of pure formic acid located at 1.876 min. The pure deuterium formic acid marked GC spectrum gave the standard generation of formic acid at 1.876 min (Fig. 7e). The relevant m/z: 48 was detected in D2O solution, which showed the generation of deuterium proton substitutional formic acid (DCOOD) (Fig. 7f). In the reduction system, the deuterium proton only existed in the solvent (D2O), confirming that the protons in the CO2 reaction process were supplied by water.
Conclusions
To sum up, the cobalt porphyrin compound loaded g-C3N4 biomimetic photoelectron catalyst based on π–π supramolecular interaction has been designed and synthesized and its CO2 photoelectrocatalytic properties was explored. Polyporous g-C3N4 and CoTPP exhibited excellent CO2 biomimetic adsorption and fixing, respectively. The loading of CoTPP on the surface of g-C3N4 inhibited the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes; thus an increased electron utilization efficiency in CO2 catalytic conversion can be achieved. As a result, the Faraday efficiency for PEC formic acid production can reach 95.4% under such conditions. At a potential of −0.6 V vs. NHE, the yield rate of formate reaches approximately 154.4 μmol, with a TON of 137 and a Faradaic efficiency of 95.4%. The possible mechanism of the CO2 conversion process was explored. An in situ UV-vis spectra study indicated that the CoTPP–CO2 adduct was the important intermediate to produce the final reduction product. Simultaneously, in situ Raman spectra further confirmed the production of the CoTPP–CO2 adduct. Meanwhile, isotopic measurements indicated that abundant protons in the solvent can promote the production of formic acid. We anticipate that this work will provide useful insights in the design of hybrid supramolecular photoelectrocatalysts with precise self-assembly structures for CO2 PEC conversion.
