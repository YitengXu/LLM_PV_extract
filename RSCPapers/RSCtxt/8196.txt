    , Accepted 16th February 2015First published on 17th February 2015AbstractAsymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on aqueous electrolytes have received widespread attention in energy research in recent years because they provide high energy and power densities in addition to being ‘green electrolyte’. Herein, we report an ASC built with electrospun nanofibers of NiO as battery type cathode material and commercially available high surface area activated carbon as capacitor type anode material with appropriate mass loadings. We synthesized high aspect ratio nanofibers of NiO by simple and cost effective sol–gel based electrospinning followed by annealing. In the end, these nanofibers were composed of densely packed hexagonal nanoparticles of polycrystalline NiO having diameters of ∼15 nm. The ASC was capable of operating in the potential window of 1.5 V in 6 M KOH solution with a gravimetric capacitance of 141 F g−1 and energy density of 43.75 W h kg−1. The ASC showed high retention of the specific capacitance for 5000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles with improved coulombic efficiency.
1. Introduction
Research into electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices is attracting widespread attention due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuels. Supercapacitors (SCs) can be used for energy storage due to their higher energy density compared to conventional capacitors, and they have higher power density and cycle stability as compared to batteries.1–4 However, the use of SCs for practical applications is limited by the lower energy density compared to batteries. This limitation can be overcome by widening cell voltage and improving specific capacitance (energy = 1/2CV2).5 Cell voltage can be increased by using electrolytes such as organic electrolytes and ionic liquids that have higher potential windows.6–9 However, it is highly advantageous to use aqueous electrolytes for SCs due to their environmental benignity, cost effectiveness, high ionic conductivity and ease of handling as compared to non-aqueous electrolytes in addition to their high specific capacitance.10,11 Moreover, the voltage window can be broadened by designing asymmetric SCs (ASC) using battery type faradaic electrodes, which act as energy sources, and capacitive electrodes, which act as power sources; both having different potential windows, thus accounting for a widened cell voltage.12–14
Based on the energy storage mechanism, SCs can be classified into two types: (i) carbon materials based electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) (ii) transition metal oxide (TMO) and conducting polymer based redox supercapacitors, also known as pseudocapacitors. EDLCs store charges at the electrode–electrolyte interface by charge separation, while pseudocapacitors store the electric charge by fast and reversible redox reactions on the surface or near the surface. Pseudocapacitors have higher specific capacitance and energy density, while carbonaceous double layer capacitors have higher electrochemical stability.1,2,13,15 Among the TMOs, nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructure has attracted widespread attention for supercapacitor applications due to its high theoretical specific capacitance (∼2573 F g−1 within 0.5 V) in addition to cost effectiveness, eco-friendly nature and low toxicity.16–18 However, the poor electric conductivity and lack of stability reduces its usage in the pristine form for practical supercapacitor applications. Therefore, a hybrid configuration of NiO in combination with carbon materials can be considered for SC electrodes due to the synergic contribution of NiO and carbon materials.19–21 A wide spectrum of NiO nanostructures can be prepared by different means such as solvothermal, hydrothermal, precipitation, and sol–gel method.20–23 Electrospinning has received more attention as compared to the others due to its simple, versatile and cost effective approach.24–26 Electrospun metal oxide nanofibers are characterized by granular and fibrous morphology, high aspect ratio and large surface to volume ratio, high crystallinity and improved mechanical strength, which makes them ideal candidates for energy storage and conversion applications such as solar cells, lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors. The nanofibrous morphology creates an easy path for the electron transport, and thus improves the energy storage.27–30
There are only a few reports in the literature on the design and development of ASCs based on NiO nanostructures. It has been reported that ASCs based on hierarchical porous NiO and carbon electrodes could operate in the potential window of 0–1.5 V.31 Yuan et al. studied the temperature effect on a gel electrolyte based ASC designed with NiO and activated carbon as electrodes.32 An ASC developed using NiO as the positive electrode and Ru0.35V0.65O2 as the negative electrode could operate at 1.7 V.33 Wang et al. reported an ASC using NiO grown on graphene foam as anode and hierarchical porous nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes as cathode via complex pulsed laser deposition technique using ozone as oxidant.34 Recently, Luan et al. reported an ASC on a carbon fiber cloth using nickel oxide nanoflake arrays and reduced graphene oxide as electrodes.35 In this paper, we report the preparation of highly crystalline and high aspect ratio nanofibers of NiO by annealing an electrospun membrane of nickel acetate–poly(vinylpyrrolidone) composite. An ASC was developed using 6 M KOH as the electrolyte with a battery type faradaic electrode made of NiO nanofibers and high surface area activated carbon composite, while the capacitive type electrode was made from activated carbon. To the best of our knowledge an ASC based on electrospun NiO NFs is being reported for the first time.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of NiO nanofibers
All the chemicals used were of analytical grade and used as received without further treatment. Nickel acetate (CH3COO)2Ni·4H2O; (here onwards referred to as NiAc), ethanol and dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Merck (India) Ltd. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, molecular weight 1300000) and activated carbon (AC, surface area = ∼2200 m2 g−1) were obtained from Alfa Aesar and Kuraray Chemical, respectively. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. In a typical procedure, a known amount of PVP was efficiently dispersed in ethanol by stirring overnight. To this PVP dispersion, a pre-synthesized NiAc solution (in DMF and ethanol) was added and subjected to overnight stirring (the experimental details are reported in the Table S1 of ESI†). The as-prepared NiAc–PVP sol–gel was used in an electrospinning apparatus (PICO India) at an electric potential of 20 kV with a feed rate of 1 mL h−1. Fig. S1 in ESI† shows the schematic of the electrospinning set up. As-spun fibers were collected on an aluminium substrate kept at a distance of 15 cm from the syringe tip. Subsequently, the as-spun fibers were subjected to calcination at 600 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, which resulted in the formation of NiO nanofibers (NiO NFs).
2.2 Characterization of NiO nanofibers
Various spectroscopic and microscopic analyses were carried out for the characterization of as-spun NiAc–PVP NFs and annealed NiO NFs in addition to the X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with PANalytical X'pert Pro diffractometer equipped with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation having a wavelength of 1.54 Å. The patterns were collected over a range of 20–85° in steps of 0.016° per second at room temperature. The Raman spectrum of NiO NFs was recorded using Horiba Jobin Yvon HR 800 equipped with optical microscope and 100× objective lens for a total magnification of 1000. The spectral resolution of the spectrometer was 2 cm−1 and the Raman signals were excited by a helium–neon laser having a wavelength of 632.8 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT Q600 TA) was conducted under nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range of 30–800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The morphology of the nanofibers was observed with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta FEG 400) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a transmission electron microscope (Philips CM20 TEM at 200 kV) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The exact mass of the electrode materials were obtained with a METTLER TOLEDO XS105 analytical balance having a readability of 0.01 mg.
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
ASC was designed from two different types of electrodes, namely, capacitive type negative electrode, prepared from commercially purchased activated carbon (AC), and battery type positive electrode, prepared from a composite of activated carbon and NiO NFs (NiO–AC) on a Toray carbon paper. Electrochemical properties of the prepared electrode (NiO–AC), used to execute as cathode material for the ASC, were studied at room temperature using a three electrode set up in 6 M KOH solution. A platinum wire and saturated silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode served as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. To design the ASC, the positive electrode was prepared by dispersing NiO NFs, AC and PVDF in NMP in the weight ratio of 70:25:5, whereas the negative electrode was prepared from AC and PVDF in the ratio 95:5 by weight. The electrode materials were brush-coated on Toray carbon papers and dried at 60 °C overnight. Because NiO is more stable in KOH solution as compared to neutral and acidic electrolytes, 6 M aqueous KOH solution was used as the electrolyte. Whatman filter paper soaked in 6 M KOH solution was used as separator with stainless steel plates as current collectors. Electrochemical studies of the ASC were investigated with a two-electrode set up using a potentiostat (Ivium Compact Stat, Ivium technologies) at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles were performed in the potential window of 0–1.5 V. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of the device was obtained with an alternating voltage of amplitude 5 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under the open circuit condition.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the typical XRD pattern of NiO NFs. Fig. S2, in ESI,† shows the XRD pattern of as-spun NiAc–PVP nanofibers. All the diffraction peaks could be assigned to a single phase of face centered cubic (FCC) phase NiO (JCPDS card no. #47-1049, a = 4.177 Å). The absence of peaks in XRD corresponding to other phases of NiO or oxides of Ni confirmed the purity of annealed sample. The sharper peaks are indicative of high crystallinity of the NiO NFs. The more intense peak located at 2θ = 43.3° indicates that crystal growth is dominated through (2 0 0) plane, which corresponds to the interplanar spacing d200 = 0.2 nm. The average crystallite size of NiO NF was calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the (2 0 0) peak to be about 10.65 nm.

All the peaks could be indexed to FCC phase of NiO (JCPDS card no. #47-1049); (b) Raman spectrum of NiO nanofibers shows the first order and second order transverse optical phonon mode as well as second order longitudinal optical phonon mode. 
The crystalline nature of NiO NFs was further supported by confocal Raman spectroscopy analysis, which is shown in Fig. 1(b). The peak located at 382 cm−1 could be attributed to the intra-3d transition of Ni2+ in the NiO nanostructure, and its comparable counterpart in bulk NiO is located at 484 cm−1.36 This shift confirms the nanostructure of the NiO, in which the energy levels are quantum confined laterally and differ from the bulk materials. The intense peak located at 505 cm−1 could be assigned to NiO stretching mode and can be described as first order transverse optical phonon mode (1PTO) of NiO NFs. The peaks recorded at 708 cm−1 and 1064 cm−1 could be assigned to the second order transverse optical phonon mode (2PTO) and second order longitudinal optical phonon (2PLO) mode of the NiO nanofiber.37,38

Fig. 2(a) shows the TGA and DSC plots of the as-spun composite fibers of NiAc–PVP. As control experiments, TGA and DSC of pure PVP nanofibers were also performed and plotted in Fig. 2(b). The decomposition of NiAc–PVP takes place in three steps, while that of pure PVP takes place in two steps. For PVP, the initial weight loss (∼9%) under 83 °C corresponds to the evaporation of solvents, such as water and ethanol, present in the PVP nanofibers. The relatively flat portion in the temperature range of 85–383 °C of PVP indicates the slow intramolecular decomposition, while the rapid weight loss starting at 385 °C corresponds to the intermolecular decomposition and evaporation of PVP. The flat portion after 480 °C corresponds to the complete elimination of PVP, which is supported by the two peaks at the temperatures of 61 °C and 450 °C in the DSC curve.39 In the case of NiAc–PVP as-spun fibers, the initial weight loss (∼18%) in the temperature range of 60–130 °C could be ascribed to the evaporation of solvents and partial decomposition (melt) of NiAc with the dehydration of crystal water from NiAc. The additional weight loss in the temperature range of 260–370 °C could be attributed to the complete dehydration and decomposition of NiAc with the formation of NiO; the intramolecular decomposition of PVP was also observed at these temperatures.40,41 The DSC plots further support the TGA analysis; the two endothermic peaks at 68 °C confirm the removal of solvents (such as water and ethanol) and the peak at 450 °C corresponds to the decomposition of PVP. In the case of composite fibers, the sharp peak located at 89.6 °C corresponds to the melting of NiAc with the removal of solvents, and the additional endothermic peaks located at 286 °C and 350 °C correspond to the dehydration and decomposition of NiAc. From the thermal analysis, it can be concluded that 600 °C is the suitable temperature for the formation of NiO from NiAc via annealing.
 Fig. 2  Thermogravimetric plots (a) and differential scanning calorimetry plots (b) of as-spun NiAc–PVP nanofibers and PVP nanofibers. The complete polymer evaporation and formation of NiO occurred below 500 °C, which ensures that 600 °C is the suitable temperature for annealing the as-spun NiAc–PVP fibers. 

Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the typical field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the as-spun NiAc–PVP and calcined NiO NFs. Fig. S3 and S4† show the photographic and optical microscopic images of as-spun NiAc–PVP fibers. It can be observed that the diameter of as-spun and annealed fibers vary in the range of 300–500 nm and 50–200 nm, respectively. As-spun fibers were randomly distributed with web-like morphology, and they had a high aspect ratio. This fact could be explained by the bending instabilities and the partial evaporation of solvents, namely, water and ethanol, which were linked through hydrogen bonding.24–26 However, the annealed fibers were no longer smooth and continuous but rough and thinner as compared to the as-spun nanofibers due to the decomposition of polymer template and other organic parts during annealing at 600 °C.27–30 Furthermore, it is evident from the careful investigation of the FESEM image that the annealed fibers are made of a large number of interconnected nanograins.

The texture and crystal structure of NiO NFs were further analyzed by HRTEM images supported by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4(a)–(d)). Diameters of annealed fibers are of the order of 100 nm, as displayed in the FESEM image. Careful investigation from HRTEM image shows that NiO NFs are composed of a large number of hexagonal and quasi hexagonal nanoparticles with an edge angle of 120° (see inset in Fig. 4(b)). These NiO nanoparticles are highly crystalline in nature as revealed by the well resolved lattice fringes of HRTEM image (shown in Fig. 4(c)), where the crystal growth occurred along the (1 1 1) plane with the interplanar spacing of d = 0.24 nm. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 4(d) indicates the polycrystalline nature of NiO nanoparticles and the sharp diffraction spots could be indexed to the (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) atomic planes of face centered cubic (FCC) phase of NiO, which further supports the XRD analysis.

3.1 Electrochemical characterization

Fig. 5(a) shows the typical CV plots of the NiO–AC composite electrode recorded in the potential window of 0–0.5 V at scan rates of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mV s−1. The CV curves displayed the prevailing pseudocapacitance behavior, in addition to the double layer effect. These distorted and complex CV curves of NiO–AC electrode arises due to the double layer effect of AC and faradic redox reaction of NiO NFs. These phenomena correspond to the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CV plot (for a scan rate of 5 mV s−1) located at 0.35 V and 0.22 V, respectively. The pseudocapacitive oxidation reduction performance of the NiO can be represented as follows:NiO + OH− ↔ NiOOH + e−
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical characterization of NiO–AC NFs cathode against Ag/AgCl electrode (a) CV plots collected at scan rates of 2–50 mV s−1; (b) galvanostatic charging discharging plots collected at the current densities of 1–10 A g−1; (c) variation of specific capacitance as a function of current density; (d) capacitance retention for 1000 galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) cycles performed at a current density of 5 A g−1. 
The narrow redox peak separation indicates the excellent electrochemical reversibility of the NiO–AC electrode and the separation widens with the gradual increase of scan rate. The plateau below 0.25 V belongs to the double layer contribution of AC. Furthermore, the galvanostatic charge–discharges of the prepared NiO–AC composite electrode against Ag/AgCl electrode were investigated at the current densities of 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1 in 6 M KOH solution and were plotted in Fig. 5(b). During galvanostatic charging, the potential increases rapidly and reaches a plateau at 0.4 V followed by slow charging until it reaches its maxima.
Similarly, during discharging, the potential reduces slowly with a relatively rapid discharge at 0.35 V. The non-linear curves further revealed the pseudocapacitive behaviors of NiO and supported the CV plot. The symmetric plots demonstrate the excellent reversibility and coulombic efficiency of the NiO–AC electrode. The specific capacitance (Cs) of the NiO–AC electrode was estimated from the formula, (1)where I is the current density (A g−1), Δt is the time of discharge (s) and ΔV is the potential window (V). The estimated specific capacitance is 248 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The appreciable electrochemical performance of NiO–AC NFs justifies its selection for cathode material for ASC. Electrospun metal oxide nanofibers obtained after sintering at higher temperature display a highly crystalline and fibrous morphology having more electroactive surface area, which enhances the pseudocapacitance. In addition, the tightly packed polycrystalline hexagonal and quasi hexagonal nanoparticles, which provide granular morphology of NiO NFs, greatly improve the specific capacitance. The NiO–AC electrode exhibits specific capacitances of 182, 125 and 98 F g−1 at current densities of 2, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Fig. 5(c) shows the variation of specific capacitance with current densities. The NiO–AC electrode was subjected to 5000 charging–discharging cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 and it showed a specific capacitance retention of 98.2% (see Fig. 5(d)).
To assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor with highest specific capacitance, charge balance (Q+ = Q−) should be maintained in both the electrodes of ASC. Fig. 6(a) shows the typical CV plots of the individual electrodes (AC and NiO–AC) recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the potential windows of 0−1 V and 0–0.5 V, respectively, against Ag/AgCl electrode. The rectangular shaped CV curve of activated carbon electrode displays an electric double layer capacitance, whereas the distorted CV curve of NiO–AC reveals a pseudocapacitance behavior in addition to the double layer effect. Because AC and NiO–AC can store electric charges in the potential windows of −1.0 V and 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, the ASC designed from these electrodes could operate from 0 to 1.5 V. Because maximum achievable potential windows of the electrodes using unit masses are estimated from the corresponding CV plots, the appropriate mass loadings of the electrode materials for designing ASC with highest performance can be determined from GCD curve (see Fig. S5 in ESI†) according to eqn (2) (ref. 34) (2)where Q+ and Q− are the charges of positive and negative electrodes of the ASC having masses of m+ and m−, respectively. The specific capacitances of the electrode materials are Cs+ and Cs− at potential windows of V+ and V− when measured with a three-electrode set up. The specific capacitances of the electrode materials were estimated from the GCD plots according to eqn (1). The mass loading ratio of positive and negative electrodes in the ASC could be estimated to be 1.076 according to eqn (2); thus, 0.5 mg of the negative electrode (AC) and 0.576 mg of the positive electrode (NiO–AC) were used to maintain the charge neutrality of ASC. The electrochemical calculations were carried out based on the total mass of electrode materials in the ASC. After determining the potential windows of each electrode materials, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was designed using AC as the anode and NiO–AC NFs as the cathode. Fig. 6(b) shows the cyclic voltammograms of the designed ASC recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with different voltage windows. It is observed from the CV plots, shown in Fig. 6(b), that the ASC could be operated till 1.8 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. However, during slow scan rates such as 1 and 2 mV s−1, the current increases rapidly until it reaches the breakdown point of electrolyte at the higher voltage windows of 1.7 V and 1.8 V. Therefore, for the sake of safety and long life of ASC, it is highly recommended to operate up to 1.5 V. Fig. 6(c) shows the CV curves of the ASC plotted in the voltage window of 0–1.5 V at scan rates of 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mV s−1. All the CV plots are similar in shape, maintaining a pair of cathodic and anodic peaks. These redox peaks in the CV plots get shifted away from each other as the scan rates are increased. The redox peaks are indicative of the pseudocapacitive nature of an ASC and dominate enormously over the double layer contribution of AC, which is very clear from the large area of corresponding CV plots. CD curves of the ASC are plotted in Fig. 6(d) at current densities of 1.5, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1, within the voltage window of 0–1.5 V. The nonlinear CD plots further supports the fast and reversible redox peaks recorded in the CV plots.

The specific capacitance (Cs), energy density (Es) and power density (Ps) of the ASC (expressed in F g−1, W h kg−1 and kW kg−1, respectively) were calculated from GCD curve according to the formulae (3) (4) (5)where I is the current density (A g−1), Δt is the time of discharge (s), m is the total mass in both the electrodes (g) and ΔV is the potential window (V). Specific capacitances at different current densities were estimated and plotted in Fig. 7(a). The highest value of specific capacitance, i.e., 141 F g−1, was achieved at a current density of 1 A g−1 with a gradual reduction to 93 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. The estimated specific capacitance, energy density and power density of the designed ASC was compared with the previously reported ASCs based on different NiO structures and shown in Table 1. The Ragone plot of the ASC (Esvs. Ps) is shown in Fig. 7(b). The cyclic stability of a supercapacitor determines its application in industry. Here, the designed ASC has been subjected to 5000 galvanostatic charging–discharging cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. The capacitance retention and coulombic efficiency of the ASC are plotted in Fig. 7(c). The last five cycles of the GCD curves are plotted in Fig. 7(d) and the initial five cycles are shown in Fig. S6 of ESI† for comparison. It was found that ASC retains its specific capacitance by 88% with improving coulombic efficiency (η = td/tc × 100), higher than the initial cycles (88–93%). The excellent specific capacitance, cyclic stability performance and columbic efficiency of the ASC could be attributed to the high surface area of AC and well-crystallized granular fibers of NiO nanoparticles. The dominated pseudocapacitance of NiO NFs as revealed from the CV plots over the double layer effect of AC could be substantiated by its unique structure. The granulated nanofibers of NiO provide a large ion accessible surface for ion diffusion and insertion–desertion. Moreover, the well-assembled composite nature of NiO and highly conductive AC facilitate the electronic charge transport between poorly conducting NiO and current collector.

Further electrochemical analysis for determining the internal resistance and charge transport of the ASC was performed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Fig. 8(a) shows the Nyquist plot of the ASC in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a signal amplitude of 5 mV under open circuit potential (OCP). The EIS plot can be easily distinguished into a distorted semicircle at the high frequency region and a straight line with a slope towards the low frequency region. The semicircle represents the charge transfer process and the sloped line represents the capacitive nature of the device. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) could be estimated from the intercept at real impedance axis; it was found to be 6.3 Ω, which constitutes the resistance of the electrolyte, the resistance at electrode–electrolyte interface, the internal resistance of the electrode material and the contact resistance between the electrode and current collector. The diameter of the semicircle reveals the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The impedance spectrum was fitted with Randles equivalent circuit, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(b), which consists of bulk solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), Warburg impedance related to the electrolyte ion diffusion (Zw), double layer capacitance (Cdl) and pseudocapacitance (Cp), and the values for Rs and Rct estimated from the equivalent circuit are 6.2 Ω and 6.4 Ω, respectively. The lower value of Rct could be attributed to the appreciable interfacial conductivity of NiO nanoparticles having a size of 15 nm and the higher surface area of the activated carbon. The large slope in the low frequency region of the Nyquist plot could be ascribed to the Warburg behavior, which arose from the fast ion diffusion across the electrode electrolyte interface. Fig. 8(b) and (c) represent the bode plots of phase angle and bode plot of impedance against frequency for the ASC. The phase angle of 72° at low frequency corresponds to capacitance contribution from both double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. The energy losses in the ASC by irreversible process could be identified from the imaginary part of the capacitance, which is shown in Fig. 8(d) and can be estimated according to the following equation42 (6)where Z′(ω) is the real part of the complex impedance, ω is the angular frequency perturbing the ac signal and |Z(ω)| is the modulus of the impedance.

The frequency at which the maximum capacitance could be delivered is the response frequency (knee frequency) of the supercapacitor (f0), which was found to be 6 Hz. The response frequency divides the capacitive (f < f0) and resistive (f > f0) range of the supercapacitor. The corresponding relaxation time constant (or supercapacitor figure of merit, τo = 1/f0) of the ASC was 167 ms. The smaller time constant indicates the faster discharge of the entire stored energy of the supercapacitor, which justifies the higher power density of the ASC.42
4. Conclusion
Simple and cost-effective electrospinning has been carried out for the synthesis of large aspect ratio nanofibers of NiO, which were composed of densely packed hexagonal nanoparticles. An asymmetric supercapacitor was designed using the NiO NF–activated carbon composite as cathode and activated carbon as anode materials. The device was capable of performing in the potential window of 0–1.8 V at higher scan rates (10 mV s−1), but better electrochemical stability and reversibility could be maintained at 1.5 V. The asymmetric supercapacitor delivered a remarkably high specific capacitance of 141 F g−1 with an energy density of 43.75 W h kg−1 and power density of 7.5 kW kg−1. The ASC exhibited high cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 88% and improved coulombic efficiency of 93% over 5000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles. The relaxation time constant of the ASC was estimated to be 167 ms.
