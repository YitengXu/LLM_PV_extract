    , Accepted 16th October 2015First published on 19th October 2015AbstractThe energy level alignment of quantum dot solar cells is key to many of the performance characteristics of devices. However, only a few of the quantum dot semiconductor systems have been available thus far, which limits the tunability of both the energy level position and absorption band edge. Here, we present a facile strategy for the first time to prepare a series of praseodymium chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots as alternate light harvesters. By sequentially layering quantum dots, rainbow quadruple-stack junctions with energy gradient architecture are constructed. It is demonstrated that the overall charge transfer time constant from the donor to the acceptor is considerably shortened from 877–1099 to 385 ps, thus leading to a significant enhancement in short-circuit current density (as high as 15.40 mA cm−2) and in power conversion efficiency by over 30% compared to its double-stack counterparts. This work reveals that the formation of the cascade energy level is desirable for robust quantum dot solar cells and concrete evidence has been provided to highlight the role of the energy level in improving photovoltaic performances such as short-circuit current density.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed inorganic semiconductors based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have the potential to revolutionize the third-generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.1 Inorganic QD semiconductors have attracted a lot of attention due to their high internal quantum efficiencies, tunable optical and electronic properties by the dimensional effect which may achieve panchromatic solar light harvest, and low-cost solution-processing.2–4 Tremendous progress in QD semiconductors and photovoltaic devices over the past decades has brought the two fields close together, resulting in steady improvement in device performances.5–7 Continuing success of photonic technologies relies on the discovery of new types of QDs, however, only a few of the available QD semiconductor materials have been exploited thus far, such as II–VI,8–12 IV–VI,6,13 carbon14 and silicon15,16 QD semiconductors for the development of photovoltaic applications.
To date, the efficiencies of such devices are still low at the current stage of development, which restricts their potential applications.17–19 In designing efficient QDSCs, many parameters, such as small optical band gaps, slow charge recombination, efficient charge separation/transport at the interface and ease of fabrication, need to be well-balanced and optimized.20–22 On one hand, the present QDSC performances are limited by insufficient solar light harvesting; on the other hand, the challenge of efficiency improvement is the irreversible energy loss that occurs during the charge transfer at the interface, because of the inefficient separation and extraction of the bound electron–hole pairs induced by the not well matched energy level.23–25 In fact, only a small fraction of the solar energy is efficiently harvested and contributes to the photocurrent. Hence, highly efficient QDSCs also require an accelerated electron transport rate in the case of the geminate recombination of the dissociated electrons and holes and do useful work through an external circuit.
Quantum dot multilayers are attracting interest for application in solar cells in recent years.26–28 The multilayer structure can deliver excellent advantages, such as offering greater solar light harvest abilities by tuning the absorption and emission bands throughout the visible region without changing the particle size.29 Besides, different bandgap chromophores can communicate with each other by Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET), which has been shown to improve the charge transfer efficiency.13,30–33 Most importantly, the energy level alignment of the active composite multilayer plays a very important role in the initial photoexcited charge transfer.34–36 It has been well established that the small energy offset between the donor and acceptor can lead to faster charge transfer at the interface and finally higher power conversion efficiency (PCE).37–39
Inspired by these results, we have synthesized a series of novel praseodymium chalcogenide quantum dots by a hydro-thermal method. A robust multilayer, consisting of ultrathin Pr2S3, Pr2Se3 and Pr2Te3 QD films, is coated onto the acceptor mesoporous titania semiconductor (TiO2), thus forming a gradient energy level architecture; consequently, the small cascade energy offset accelerates the charge transfer across the entire photoactive film, funneling the energetic photoexcited charge carrier transport unidirectionally with minimum energy loss.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Chemical reagents including tetrabutyl titanate (97%), polyethylene glycol (molecular weight of 20000), P25 (Degussa), nitric acid (70%), acetic acid (99.7%), acetone, OP emulsifying agent (Triton X-100), praseodymium nitrate (99.99%), glutathione (GSH), isopropanol (99.5%), sodium borohydride (99%), sodium sulfide (98%), selenium (99.99%), tellurium (99.99%), and absolute ethanol (99.5%) are of analytical purity and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Hongkong, China. PEDOT:PSS was provided by Aldrich. Fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, sheet resistance 8 Ω cm−2) was purchased from Hartford Glass Co., USA.
2.2 Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QD synthesis
Preparation of S, Se and Te precursors. As for the Se precursor, a mixture of selenium powder (0.1 g) and absolute ethanol (20 mL) was prepared at room temperature. Subsequently, 0.12 g sodium borohydride was quickly injected into the mixed solution under a nitrogen atmosphere and under vigorous stirring a colorless Se precursor solution was formed; as for the preparation of Te precursor solution, 0.05 g tellurium was dissolved into 25 mL deionized water at room temperature, followed by quickly injecting 0.25 g sodium borohydride into the mixed solution, and after vigorous stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere, a colorless Te precursor solution was formed; as for the preparation of the S precursor, 1.95 g sodium sulfide was completely dissolved into 250 mL deionized water at room temperature under a N2 atmosphere and then under vigorous stirring, a colorless S precursor solution was formed.
2.3 Preparation of GSH-modified Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs
A series of aqueous colloidal Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs were prepared in the presence of GSH as the stabilizing agent.40 Briefly, 50 mL of 0.02 M praseodymium nitrate aqueous solution acting as the Pr precursor was first diluted to 250 mL in a three-necked flask in the presence of 0.16 g GSH, then the pH of the solution was adjusted to 1 by adding a few drops of 0.5 M HNO3, followed by degassing at 100 °C for 2 h under vacuum. Then, the solution was heated to 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 minutes. After that 2 mL of S, Se or Te precursor solution was rapidly injected into the hot solution, respectively, under vigorous stirring for 3 h and then Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 colloidal QDs were formed. Finally, the mixture was hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for appropriate time in an autoclave. Then QDs were purified by precipitation upon the addition of excess absolute ethanol, centrifugation and re-dispersion in distilled water under normal atmospheric conditions. This cleaning process was repeated twice, then the QDs were dried with nitrogen flow and stored in solid form in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.
2.4 Device fabrication
The purified GSH-modified Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs were re-dispersed in deionized water with a concentration of 25 mg mL−1 and used for thin-film fabrication. The TiO2 colloid was prepared by the procedures in a similar way as done in the previous studies.37,38 A layer of n-type TiO2 film with a thickness of ∼300 nm was prepared by coating the TiO2 colloid on FTO glass using a spin-coating technique, followed by sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min. QD multilayers were fabricated on FTO/TiO2 substrates by spin-coating using a layer-by-layer approach. First, three drops of Pr2S3 QD solution were dropped on a static substrate on the spin coater. Then the spin coating apparatus was set to spin at 2500 rpm. After 30 s, the substrate was rinsed with deionized water. The spinning was repeated 3–5 times. After that, Pr2Te3 and Pr2Se3 QDs were successively deposited on top of each other by the same procedure. Next, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the BHJ. Finally, Pt electrodes were deposited on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by thermal evaporation under vacuum. The active area of the devices is about 0.5 cm−2.
2.5 Characterization
The microstructures of the QDs were characterized by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd.). Samples for HR-TEM were prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the samples, placing a small volume of this suspension on carbon-enhanced copper grids, and drying in air. The cross-sectional morphologies were characterized by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800). X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) measurements were performed using an Al Kα X-ray source on a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, USA). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was measured by using a spectrophotometer (FLS920, Edinburgh), in which a xenon lamp and a photomultiplier tube (R955, Hamamatsu) were used as the excitation source and fluorescence detector. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary 300 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out within an electrochemical inert gas cell inside a Faraday cage, in which a three-electrode configuration was used: anhydrous and degassed tetramethylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) in dimethylformamide as the electrolyte, platinum wire as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode and QD film fabricated for use as the work electrode. Mott–Schottky measurements were done at a frequency of 1 kHz in an aqueous solution of 0.05 M Na2SO4 using a BAS 100B instrument and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled QDSCs were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (Xe Lamp Oriel Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulators 94023A, USA) under irradiation of simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp in ambient atmosphere. Time-resolved photoluminescence experiments were performed on a spectrometer (Bruker Optics 250IS/SM) with an intensified charge coupled device detector (CCD, Andor, IStar 740). The QD films were excited by 120 fs laser pulse at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The time resolution of this experiment was determined to be ∼60 ps.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization of QDs
Monodisperse colloidal Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs were prepared by a hydrothermal technique using praseodymium nitrate as the metallic precursor and sodium borohydride as both the reducing agent and electrostatic stabilizer to prevent agglomeration (see methods). The hydrothermal techniques were used to produce high quality QDs as high temperature is essential for accelerating the growth of nanocrystals with narrow size distribution and an enhanced PL quantum yield (QY).41 As shown in Fig. 1, no PL was observed from the initially prepared QD precursors without being subjected to hydrothermal treatment, which is ascribed to the surface disorder of QDs. However, obvious PL in QD precursors is clearly revealed after hydrothermal treatment. Therefore, we conclude that hydrothermal treatment at high temperature, such as 200 °C, is a key and efficient approach to reduce the surface defects and achieve high QY. Furthermore, we investigate the typical temporal evolution of PL spectra of crude Pr2S3, Pr2Se3 and Pr2Te3 colloidal precursors that are taken from the autoclaves, as shown in Fig. 1b–d. In all cases, the PL intensity first increases with hydrothermal reaction time, indicating that the growth of all nanocrystals continues after forming the initial nucleation. However, a notable decrease in PL QY is observed with further reaction time. The reduced PL QY, on one hand, can be interpreted by Ostwald ripening accompanied by the gradual decrease of the particle concentration; on the other hand, the unpredictable defect states introduced during the growth of nanocrystals may be responsible for the decreased PL QY, because those undesired defect states will result in an irreversible energy loss to heat by deleterious relaxations from the defect states without contributing to the photoluminescence. Similar results are observed in photoluminescence blinking only for a single nanocrystal, but never for an ensemble.42,43 As a result, the intermediate reaction times in the middle exhibit the highest PL efficiency, i.e., 16, 12, and 18 h for Pr2S3, Pr2Se3 and Pr2Te3, respectively. Besides, note that these QDs in this study are optimized in terms of the maximum emission intensity except otherwise indicated.

The morphologies of the optimized QDs are shown in Fig. 2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation of QDs suggests that the QDs are highly monodisperse, and the statistical size distributions of Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs are roughly estimated from more than 100 nanoparticles and the results are displayed in Fig. 2d. The diameter of Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QDs falls within the narrow nanometer domain of about 1.5–3.0, 4.5–7.0 and 2.5–5.0 nm, respectively, and the corresponding average diameters are 2.0 (32%), 5.8 (35%) and 3.1 (37%) nm for Pr2S3, Pr2Se3 and Pr2Te3 QDs, respectively. The small size allows maximizing the loading of QDs into the pores of the TiO2 layer. In order to gain additional insights into the chemical state of the QDs, XPS measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), all of the QDs exhibit the 3d binding energy of Pr clearly, which consists of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks and their satellites. The asymmetric 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 profiles with shoulders are Gauss-fitted to locate the satellite peaks from the 3d main peaks. The observation of satellite peaks in Pr 3d is attributed to the interplay between the intra-atomic multiplet coupling and the solid-state hybridization.44 The deconvoluted high-resolution Pr 3d spectrum comprises two main peaks at 934.4 and 954.7 eV, corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 core-levels, respectively, with a spin–orbit coupling (Δ) of ∼20 eV that is in agreement with the related systems.44,45 Therefore, the Pr 3d peaks are unanimously assigned to Pr3+ and that there is no secondary Pr phase such as metallic Pr or its oxides. Besides, the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks lying in the range of 160–164 eV in Fig. S1b (ESI†) suggest the S2− states.17 The Se 3d, Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2 binding energies are observed at 54.4, 572.2 and 584.3 eV, respectively, which confirm the existence of Se2− and Te2− (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†) and eventually the composition of the QDs should be determined as Pr2(S, Se, Te)3.18,46

3.2 Charge transfer in energy gradient QD multilayers
CV measurements were performed to obtain the absolute band edge positions with respect to the vacuum level. The CV characteristics in Fig. S2a (ESI†) show that both the oxidation and reduction waves of the QDs films are clearly revealed, indicating the excellent electron/hole uptake and release capability of these semiconductor crystals. Finally, the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) energy levels can be calculated using the following formula: CB (or VB) (eV) = −4.8 − (E − E1/2) (eV),47 where E is the peak point of the redox potential,48E1/2 is the formal potential of the Fc/Fc+ system of 0.09 V against the Ag/Ag+ system (E1/2 = 0.09 V).47 The electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. The CB edge positions of Pr2S3, Pr2Te3 and Pr2Se3 QDs are elevated gradually from −4.00, −3.81 to −3.71 eV, respectively, while the VB values increase gradually from −6.59, −6.10 to −5.65 eV, respectively. In order to further confirm the above results, the band edge positions of the QDs are separately determined by Mott–Schottky plots and UV-vis absorption spectra. Fig. S2b† shows the Mott–Schottky plots of the QDs, that is, 1/C2 as a function of electrochemical potentials V, where the capacitance C is obtained from the impedance measurement.49 The negative slopes of Mott–Schottky plots indicate that all of the QDs are p-type. The flat band potentials were obtained by a linear extrapolation to C = 0, i.e., the intercept at the X axis.50 Then, the CB energy level was calculated with Ag/Ag+ as reference. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three QDs are shown in the inset of Fig. S2b (ESI†), in which the band edges are determined to be 478, 629 and 527 nm for Pr2(S, Se, Te)3, respectively. Besides, all these QDs exhibit four static prominent excitonic absorption peaks at 592, 483, 469 and 442 nm which can be assigned to the characteristic absorption of the Pr3+ ions from the f–f transitions 3H4–1D2, 3H4–3P0, 3H4–3P1, and 3H4–3P2, respectively.51,52 The band gap Eg was determined from the UV-vis absorption spectra using the following relationship: Eg = 1240/λ eV, where λ is the band edges. Finally, the VB energy levels were obtained based on the known CB and Eg and are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the results obtained from the CV characteristics agree with those determined from Mott–Schottky plots and UV-vis absorption spectra. Note that among the three QDs, both the CB and VB edge positions of Pr2Se3 QDs are located higher than their counterparts (Pr2S3 and Pr2Te3 QDs) and bear the smallest band gap.

It is known that the energy offset plays a crucial role in the charge transfer rate at the donor and acceptor interface. Recent studies have shown that a small energy offset can ensure an efficient charge transfer at the interface, thus leading to an enhancement in charge separation and collection, and eventually photovoltaic performances.37 In order to reduce the excess energy offset, we introduce a multilayer structure that comprises different praseodymium chalcogenide chromophores of different band gaps and band edge positions. Finally, quadruple-stack junctions (Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2) with energy gradient architecture were constructed as shown in Fig. 3a, in which the energy offset was apparently lowered by the small cascade energy offset compared with the double-stack junctions, i.e., Pr2(S, Se, Te)3/TiO2. Now one will wonder whether the energy gradient architecture will benefit the photoexcited charge transfer at the interface. Herein, through time-integrated and time-resolved PL spectroscopies, with selective excitation and probing, we have successfully decoupled charge transfer dynamics and evidenced the enhancement of charge transfer for the energy gradient architecture.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic configuration of the energy gradient architecture with conduction and valence band positions of the blue, green, and red QDs relative to TiO2 and the schematic diagram displaying charge transfer for photogeneration in the multilayers; (b) steady-state PL from Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 films, excited at 400 nm and QD triple-stack multilayers, excited at absorption band edge of red Pr2Se3 QDs, i.e., 629 nm; (c) time-resolved PL decays monitoring the red fluorescence peaks (608 nm) in a pure Pr2Se3 (red circles) and in the Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3 multilayers (black circles) when excited at the absorption edge of Pr2Se3 QD (629 nm); (d) time-resolved PL monitoring the blue fluorescence peaks (434 nm) in a pure Pr2S3 (red circles) and in the QD multilayers (black circles) when excited at the absorption edge of Pr2S3 QD (478 nm). 

Fig. 3b highlights the optical properties of the three optimized QDs, that is, blue, green, and red visual display of emission colors of the different individual QD films under UV excitation (Fig. 5). Besides, the emission peaks located at 434, 507 and 608 nm corresponding to the individual Pr2S3 (blue), Pr2Te3 (green) and Pr2Se3 (red), respectively, are close to the corresponding absorption spectrum edge (478, 527 and 629 nm as shown in Fig. S2b, ESI†). These broad emission bands may originate from a distribution of different emissive states on individual QDs or inhomogeneous diameters of the QDs. Solutions containing populations of these blue, green and red QDs were prepared and used to manufacture spin-cast films of closely-packed triple-stack interpenetrating networks (Pr2S3/Pr2Te3/Pr2Se3). Steady-state PL measurements of the triple-stack QD multilayers demonstrate that the emission peak locating at 480 nm is close to the emission peak of the Pr2S3 QDs. This indicates that the emission from the closely packed QD multilayers evolved into a single spectrum and strongly weighted towards high energies (that is short wavelength), thus exhibiting blue-shift compared to those of Pr2Te3 (507 nm) and Pr2Se3 (608 nm) QDs whereas exhibiting red-shift compared to that of Pr2S3 QDs (434 nm). Excited by 629 nm laser, the electrons at the ground states of Pr2Se3 QDs are promoted to the excited states. Then those photoexcited electrons may be transported to the CB level of Pr2Te3 and finally reach the CB of Pr2S3 QDs. The strong ultraviolet emission at 480 nm is attributed to the fluorescence of recombination of electrons and holes in the Pr2S3 layer. Accordingly, the schematic energy level diagram and diagram displaying charge transfer for photogeneration in the multilayer are shown in Fig. 3a. Different from the FRET, which unambiguously tends to lead to an emission redshift, the fundamental mechanism underlying FRET involves a donor fluorophore in an excitation state, which may transfer its excitation energy to an adjacent acceptor fluorophore (or chromophore) in a non-radiative style by dipole–dipole interactions without exchanging light between the donor and acceptor.30–33 The energy transfer efficiency is governed by spectral overlap between the donor emission and acceptor absorption as well as the distance between donor and acceptor fluorophores. Typically, FRET works efficiently over donor–acceptor distances ranging from 10 to 100 Å, one characteristic of which has been widely identified and exploited in the literature. Although the spectral overlap and the distance requirements can be satisfied in our case, it is inappropriate to interpret the emission shift herein and the to-be-mentioned PL quenching as FRET. Since energy level alignment of the active composite multilayer plays a very important role in the initial photoexcited charge transfer, the decreased energy offset by the cascade energy level formation can boost the charge transfer, which probably can be interpreted by the fact that the energy offset is located in the Marcus ‘inverted’ region. Therefore, in this work, inspired by these incentives, we intend to reduce the CB–CB offset between QDs and TiO2 in virtue of employing a multilayer structure that comprises different praseodymium chalcogenide chromophores of different band gaps and band edge positions, i.e., quadruple-stack junctions (Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2) with energy gradient architecture were constructed as shown in Fig. 3a, in which the energy offset was apparently lowered by the small cascade energy offset compared with the double-stack junctions, i.e., Pr2S3/TiO2, Pr2Se3/TiO2 or Pr2Te3/TiO2.
To explore the photoexcited energy transfer ability, time-resolved single-photon counting PL experiments were performed to evaluate the rate of energy transfer from red (Pr2Se3), green (Pr2Te3) to blue (Pr2S3) QDs. The PL recovery occurs with a series of heterogeneous kinetics, but can be fitted to a bi-exponential function, which was found to be satisfactory in the determination of emission lifetimes:53 I(t) = [a1exp(−t/τ1) + a2exp(−t/τ2)] × F(t)(1)where F(t) is the impulse response function (IRF), which is related to half width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the pulse duration, a (a1 and a2) is the amplitude, and τ is the time constant. Then by fitting to the data points of the PL decays for the films as shown in Fig. 3c and d, the measured fluorescence dynamics was numerically simulated and the obtained numerical values (i.e., the kinetic parameters) are listed in Table 2 and next were used to estimate the average lifetimes of either individual Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 or the QD multilayers from the emission decays by eqn (2): (2)

Compared with the PL decays of individual Pr2Se3 QDs and the QD multilayers, the charge transfer rate constant in QD multilayer kCT1 can be estimated from eqn (3) as follows: (3)
When monitored at 608 nm (low-energy range), a pronounced decrease of PL average lifetime in a multilayer than that in neat Pr2Se3 QDs is observed (i.e., 737 vs. 6476 ps, about 8 times faster than pure Pr2Se3), whereas when detected at 434 nm (high-energy range), a little longer lifetime is obtained, roughly resembling the behavior of the neat Pr2S3 QD film (Fig. 3d). These energy-dependent PL lifetimes unambiguously show that the photoexcited charge transfer does occur in the energy gradient architecture, i.e., from low band gap Pr2Se3, Pr2Te3 to large band gap Pr2S3 QDs. In detail, when the red Pr2Se3 QDs in the multilayer are excited, they transfer the electrons/holes to the green and finally the large blue chromophores, which will quench luminescence in the low-energy range and lead to a notable decrease in PL lifetime. On the other hand, the charge transfer from red, green and to blue QDs enhances PL in a high-energy range and gives rise to a slight increase in PL lifetime. Furthermore, the overall charge transfer time in the QD multilayer is determined to be 832 ps with a corresponding transfer rate of 1.20 × 109 s−1, which is in reasonable agreement with other related systems.30 This remarkable charge transfer rate demonstrates that the present QD multilayer is capable of transporting the electrons and holes in an efficient way. So far, an energy gradient architecture, i.e., the QD multilayer, was engineered to achieve the energy level formation of the QDs and an efficient resonant QD pair. Next, we will evidence that the efficient charge transfer in QD multilayers with a boosted energy transfer rate is capable of generating directed energy flows in QD multilayers/TiO2 junction and enhance the final charge transfer rate at the donor–acceptor interface.
3.3 Photoexcited charge transfer dynamics
The photoexcited electron transfer can be evaluated by the PL QY measurements of the QD layer interfaced with an appropriate electron- or hole-extraction layer.54–56 Comparative studies on the neat QD or multilayer films against the corresponding junctions enable us to assess the charge transfer efficiency. Fig. 4 shows the time-integrated PL spectra of the neat QD, QD multilayer films, double-stack Pr2(S, Se, Te)3/TiO2 and quadruple-stack Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2 junctions. Under the almost identical experimental conditions, the time-integrated PL intensity is greatly quenched when the QD multilayer is interfaced with an electron extraction layer TiO2. In detail, for Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2 quadruple-stack junctions, the PL intensity is quenched by a factor of about 80%, which is higher than those of double-stack junctions, i.e., quenched by 61%, 67% and 58% for Pr2S3, Pr2Se3, Pr2Te3, respectively. It is agreed that the PL quantum yield is sensitive to the degree of the photoexcited charge transfer to the acceptor.54–56 Such a high quenching degree of PL indicates that better charge transfer can be achieved by introducing energy gradient architecture.
 Fig. 4  Steady-state PL from Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 films (excited at 400 nm) and triple-stack QD multilayers (excited at 629 nm) with and without electron extraction layer TiO2. 
Besides, time-resolved single-photon counting PL experiments were performed to investigate the photoinduced electron transfer within junctions and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The PL decays were fitted to a bi-exponential function using eqn (1). The average decay times 〈τ〉 of the neat QD films and the QD multilayers are separately determined to be 3.1, 6.5, 5.6 and 3.6 ns for Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 and QD multilayers, respectively. The emission is dramatically quenched when the QD layer is intimately interfaced with the TiO2 layer, i.e., 682, 937, 713 and 347 ps for Pr2(S, Se, Te)3/TiO2 and QD multilayers/TiO2, respectively, indicating that efficient photoinduced charge transfer at the interface of the junctions has occurred. The average PL lifetimes (τheterojunction) of the double-stack and quadruple-stack junctions were obtained by eqn (2) and are listed in Table 3. By applying the relation τheterojunction = 1/τ + 1/τCT2,54 the charge transfer lifetimes τCT2 can be estimated to be 877, 1099 and 901 ps for Pr2S3/TiO2, Pr2Se3/TiO2 and Pr2Te3/TiO2 junctions, respectively. The quadruple-stack junction with an energy gradient architecture exhibits a much faster charge transfer rate, which is at least 100% faster than the double-stack junctions. Moreover, efficient charge transfer in QD multilayers funnels the photoexcited charge carriers unidirectionally from the small bandgap chromophores to the large bandgap chromophores, which can lead to a boosted energy transfer rate and minimize energy loss; on the other hand, due to the decreased energy offset by the cascade energy level formation, the charge transfer time decreases, which can be interpreted by the fact that the energy offset is located in the Marcus ‘inverted’ region.36

It is agreed that the photon absorption first produces electron–hole pairs (exciton) which are tightly bound by the Coulomb attraction. The initial charge-separation step, electron transfer from the donor into the acceptor conduction band (or the reverse hole transfer from acceptor excited states) can be achieved by utilizing a suitable energy offset between the CB of the donor and acceptor. Usually, a large energy offset between the CB energy level of the donor and the CB edge of the acceptor is necessary to break the Coulomb attraction and enables the initial electron transfer to be energetically downhill. This CB–CB energy offset must be larger than the exciton binding energy in the material to facilitate charge transfer, typically in the range of 0.1–0.5 eV,39 but is closely related to the properties of the materials, such as the dielectric constant. It is worth mentioning that the electron acceptor used in this study, i.e., TiO2, has a quite large dielectric constant (εr ≈ 80), which benefits the electron or hole to develop into freely mobile charge carriers. This has been effectively screened in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.57 Therefore, the large energy offset is not requisite for the present TiO2–QD system. Meanwhile, recent studies have revealed that the decreased energy offset indeed can improve charge transfer.30,32–34 Moreover, Markus C. Scharber and his co-workers have revealed a relation among energy-conversion efficiency of a bulk-heterojunction solar cell, bandgap, and the CB level of the donor, which demonstrates that the energy offset is related to the working principle of the bulk-heterojunction solar cell and can be minimized by optimizing materials to achieve better device performances.23 In this work, the ‘excess’ CB–CB offset is apparently reduced by the small cascade energy offset as compared with the double-stack junctions, i.e., Pr2(S, Se, Te)3/TiO2 in virtue of employing a multilayer structure.
3.4 Device performances

Fig. 6a shows the schematic diagram depicting the assembly of the quadruple-stack junctions consisting of (Pr2S3) blue, (Pr2Te3) green, (Pr2Se3) red QDs and TiO2 (white) layers. Under the illumination of the solar light from the FTO side, the blue QDs absorbed the solar energy first, and then the filtered light excited the green QDs, followed by exciting the red QDs. The morphologies of pure TiO2 and QDs/TiO2 BHJ films are shown in Fig. S3a and b (ESI†), respectively. It can be observed from Fig. S3a (ESI†) that the surface of the TiO2 acceptor (particle diameter of about 20–30 nm) clearly exhibits a loose and porous structure, which on one hand is prone to readily adsorb QDs in the porosity58 in virtue of intermolecular attractive forces;59–61 on the other hand favors the p–n contact for BHJ and offers channels for Pr2(S, Se, Te)3 QD solution across the acceptor layer as shown in Fig. S3c (ESI†). In contrast, the morphology of quadruple-stack junction as shown in Fig. 6c indicates that the QDs have been uniformly penetrated into or covered on the TiO2 acceptor layer. Surface passivation or modification through the use of the inorganic or organic ligands has been demonstrated to play an effective role in improving the QD behaviors, such as suppressing surface traps, controlling the size, linking the QDs to other semiconductors (TiO2) and improving the chemical stability of the QDs.62–64 Note that, in this work, stabilizer GSH was used during the synthesis of QDs. The GSH modified QDs can bring about COOH groups which guarantees that the QDs can tightly anchor on the TiO2 surface. The thickness of the quadruple-stack junction including TiO2 and QD multilayers (Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2) was estimated to be about 300 nm. A closely packed QD multilayer structure was observed, which benefits an efficient charge transfer. It is worth mentioning that after spin coating the Pr2S3 QDs, the substrate was rinsed with deionized water to remove redundant QD liquid. Those QDs that are not well anchored on TiO2 were emptied out for loading new QDs. After spin coating Pr2Te3 QDs three times, the color of the film turns pea green. And then the film was rinsed with deionized water again, followed by spin coating with Pr2Se3 QDs. Finally, the film changes into orange. This indicates that the three QDs are well deposited. However, due to the small size of these QDs (1.5–7.0 nm), the demarcation line between different QDs is hard to distinguish in both the cross-sectional SEM images of the quadruple-stack junction and the pure QD multilayers coated on FTO (Fig. S3d†), however, an intimate interface between TiO2 and the QDs is observed, which is essential for an efficient charge separation in the junction because the photoexcited charge carriers cannot diffuse too long, typically within 100 nm.56

(b) J–V characteristics in AM 1.5G solar simulated light. (c) Cross-sectional SEM image of the quadruple-stack junctions, inset is the high magnification. 

Fig. 6b shows the typical J–V characteristics of double-stack and the quadruple-stack solar cells. Each type of QDSC was tested 5 times under identical experimental conditions, as shown in Fig. S8.† The device performances were significantly improved after introducing energy gradient architecture as summarized in Table 4. Under the almost identical experimental conditions, the prepared quadruple-stack (i.e., Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2) solar cells exhibit a much higher PCE of 4.06% as compared to its double-stack counterparts (2.82% for blue QDs, 3.11% for green QDs, and 3.28% for red QDs). The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the QD multilayer cell has a significant increase to 15.40 mA cm−2 from 10.64–13.82 mA cm−2 for the single QD layer cell, whereas the fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) are similar. The photocurrent density of the assembled QDSC was recorded under irradiation for over 5 h to reveal the stability of the QDSCs under prolonged irradiation as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Only a slight degradation can be observed within 5 h as the photocurrent densities decrease by 3.0%. Although the QDSC was tested for 5 h only, this preliminary result demonstrates the good stability of the GSH modified QDs. The construction of a rainbow solar cell, which employs ordered praseodymium chalcogenide quantum dots with different band gaps, broadens the absorption of the solar light spectrum: when white light enters the cell, blue Pr2S3 QDs (larger band gap) absorb the portion of the light with the higher energy photons (blue region). Then, the filtered light with lower energy photons (red region) penetrates to the inner layers and is absorbed by subsequent QDs (Pr2Te3 and Pr2Se3). It is accepted that the absorption of high-energy photons (blue light) by small band gap chromophores will result in undesired ‘hot’ carriers, both electronically excited and thermally activated, and lose most of their energy by emitting phonons without contributing to electric power.37,65,66 However, the generation of undesired ‘hot’ carriers is greatly reduced in this energy gradient multilayers because of the preferential resonance absorption of high energy photons within the first layer. By creating an ordered energy gradient architecture, it should be possible to enhance the light harvest efficiency.29 Moreover, the energy transfer efficiency can be further improved by the efficient charge transfer between the chromophores. Since the intrinsic exciton lifetimes of the Pr2Se3 QDs are long (>6 ns), so that with a charge transfer lifetime of 837 ps, an exciton can migrate over 7 times on average before the geminate recombination occurs. Furthermore, time-resolved PL analysis indicates that the construction of energy gradient architecture reduces the excess CB–CB offset, thus shortening the photoexcited charge transfer time and leading to an efficient charge separation at the interface of the junction. Although it is difficult to pinpoint the branching ratio of the charge transfer in between the chromophores at this stage, the synergetic effects observed with the energy gradient architecture highlight the crucial role of the multilayer in improving the performance of QDSCs.

It is worth mentioning that for comparison with the concept of funneling energy by FRET, in which energy will be transferred from the large bandgap QDs to small bandgap QDs (as shown in Fig. S5†), one additional quadruple junction was prepared for comparison, i.e., Pr2S3/Pr2Te3/Pr2Se3/TiO2 with analogous energy level formation and the device performance was examined (Fig. S6†). Unfortunately, the QDSCs based on this architecture exhibit poor performances. The observed efficiency of 2.20% for the Pr2S3/Pr2Te3/Pr2Se3/TiO2 QDSC is much smaller than that obtained from the Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2 multilayer (4.06%). Therefore, efficient optoelectronic devices not only require sufficient light harvesting by funneling the energy to the D–A interface via FRET, but also need useful work to coordinate the energy flow with the photoelectric circuit. Unfortunately, it is still technologically challenging to achieve these simultaneously at this stage, due to inappropriate energy levels of the present praseodymium chalcogenide QDs. One schematic diagram of an ideal multilayer is shown in Fig. S7†: the ideal energy gradient architecture can show advantages such as fast charge transfer for the cascade small energy offset, funneling the energy to the donor–acceptor interface via FRET and well-balanced energy flow with the photoelectric circuit. This work is devoted to the energy gradient architecture and its effect on the energy level formation between the donor and acceptor, charge transfer and device performances without paying attention to the further refining design of the devices such as introducing FRET, which should be a promising engineering rule that needs to be considered in future.
4. Conclusions
In this work, luminescent praseodymium chalcogenide QDs exhibiting red, green and blue visual colors have been successfully fabricated by a facile low-temperature hydrothermal approach. We have demonstrated the high performance of quantum dot solar cells through engineering band level alignment at the QD/QD interface by fabricating quadruple-stack junctions (Pr2Se3/Pr2Te3/Pr2S3/TiO2) with energy gradient architecture. In detail, compared with the single-layer QD cells, the sequential layering of larger-band-gap QDs followed by smaller-band-gap QDs (i.e., the QD multilayer cell) provides a faster charge transfer rate at the interface and the averaged charge transfer time constant has considerably decreased from 877–1099 to 385 ps. Owing to these synergetic effects, the quadruple-stack junctions deliver a significant enhancement in short-circuit current density (as high as 15.40 mA cm−2) and hence a PCE of 4.06% compared with those of the double-stack reference systems (2.82–3.11%). This work offers new strategies for photovoltaic applications with selective absorption making use of the quantum size effect. With further improvements in size selectivity, PL quantum yield, absorption band edge as well as energy level matching, we anticipate that these findings permit more efficient unidirectional energy flows in the energy gradient architecture. An improved understanding of the QD optoelectronic properties and further progress in material development could lead to the advances in QD-based solar cells. Moreover, the as-obtained praseodymium chalcogenide QDs also hold great promise in various optoelectronic devices except solar cells, such as light emitting diodes.
