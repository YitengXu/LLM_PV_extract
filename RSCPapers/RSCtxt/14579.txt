    , Accepted 24th June 2019First published on 25th June 2019AbstractHerein, we proposed a simple and cost-effective approach to synthesize perovskite fluoride (NaNiF3) hollow spheres as well as the detailed formation mechanism of these hollow spheres. As an electrode for supercapacitors, the perovskite fluoride (NaNiF3) hollow spheres exhibited a high specific capacitance (1342 F g−1 at 5 A g−1), excellent rate performance and a long cycle stability (more than 90% capacity retention after 8000 cycles). The NaNiF3//AC asymmetric device displayed a wide voltage window (1.65 V) and delivered a maximum energy density (51.78 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 1.65 kW kg−1) with an excellent cyclic stability (100% capacity retention from 1400 to 10000 cycles). The LED lighting further confirmed the high energy and power density of the ASC device.
1. Introduction
Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors have attracted extensive and significant attention over the past few decades due to their efficiency in energy storage applications,1–10 such as in portable electronics, electrical vehicles, power-backups, and many microelectronic devices, owing to their high power density and long cyclic life; moreover, they are considered one of the most important candidates for next-generation efficient energy-storage devices.11–14 Although supercapacitors show high power density, they usually suffer from a relatively low energy density as compared to those of traditional batteries and fuel cells;15–18 to fulfill the high demands of energy storage in the future, the development of advanced supercapacitors with high energy densities without sacrificing their power density and cycle life to a large extent is urgently needed.15 As energy density directly depends on the voltage window and specific capacitance (E = 0.5CV2), supercapacitors with high energy densities can be achieved by exploring new electrode materials that can operate in high voltage windows and provide sufficient specific capacitance.19
During the past decade, perovskite-type materials, especially perovskite oxides (ABO3), have been extensively investigated for different applications such as in solar cells, catalysis, and energy storage devices.20,21 Perovskite oxides have also been investigated as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.22,23 However, the lack of high performance and long stability of perovskite oxides limits their commercial application. Therefore, to fulfill the demands of practical applications in the future, electrode materials with not only a high operating voltage window but also high specific capacitance are essential. Therefore, the exploration of new-types of perovskite materials that can operate in larger voltage windows with high specific capacitance and long cyclic life is highly valuable.
NaMF3 (M = Ni, Co) has a perovskite structure, which exhibits the merits of intrinsic 3D diffusion channels (favoring highly efficient ion and electron transport), metal-fluoride bonds (elevating the redox potential) and high energy density of the material;24 however, to date, the promising applications of perovskite fluorides in supercapacitors have not been thoroughly investigated. Very recently, bimetallic perovskite fluorides have been demonstrated as potential electrode materials for supercapacitor applications and have achieved a relatively good electrochemical performance.24,25 Hollow spherical micro/nano architectures have unique structural advantages for the adsorption of numerous ions, largely shortening the diffusion pathways for both ions and electrons, significantly reducing volume expansions during cycling, etc.26 To the best of our knowledge, only few studies have been reported on the fabrication of perovskite fluorides with hollow architectures. Therefore, further research is definitely needed to design perovskite fluorides with improved characteristics, such as crystal nature, morphology, and conductivity, to enable their better performances.
Herein, we successfully synthesized the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3via a one-step and cost-effective solvothermal process. The hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 was used as an outstanding electrode material in an aqueous 3 M KOH + 0.5 M LiOH electrolyte at room temperature for supercapacitor applications. The perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres exhibited a high specific capacitance (1342 F g−1 at 5 A g−1), excellent rate performance and long cycle stability. Furthermore, for practical applications, an asymmetric 1.65 V aqueous supercapacitor was reported by pairing the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode in a mixture of the KOH and the LiOH (3 M + 0.5 M) electrolyte. The NaNiF3//AC asymmetric device operated in a high voltage window and attained a 51.78 W h kg−1 energy density at the power density of 1.65 kW kg−1, which still retained 40.33 W h kg−1 at the power density of 13.2 kW kg−1. The current study provides prospects for the synthesis of perovskite fluorides as highly efficient nanomaterials for energy conversion and storage applications.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Synthesis of the hollow sphere NaNiF3 nanocrystals
The NaNiF3 hollow nanospheres were prepared via a simple one-step solvothermal process without any surfactants or hard templates. In a typical process, 0.8 mmol sodium citrate dihydrate, 2.16 mmol NiCl2·6H2O, and 8.6 mmol NH4F were added to a mixed solvent of ethylene glycol and water (18:1) and stirred for 1 hour. Then, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon autoclave (54 ml volume) and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled down to room temperature, a light-green colored product was finally obtained after centrifugation and a post-treatment process (i.e., washing several times with distilled water and ethanol and then drying overnight at 60 °C).
2.2. Characterization
The structure of the obtained material was determined by a powder XRD system equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The structure of the material was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS SUPRA 55), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1011) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL-JEM-2100F). XPS tests were performed via the Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer using an Al Ka X-ray source. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and nitrogen adsorption isotherm were measured over P/P0 = 0–1 at 77 K using autosorb IQ (Quantachrome, USA).
2.3. Electrochemical measurements
The working electrode was prepared by mixing 80% active material, 14% carbon black and 6% PTFE binder. The slurry was dropped on a carbon paper (1 × 1 cm2) and dried at 60 °C for 12 hours. The mixture of a 3 M KOH and 0.5 M LiOH aqueous solution was used as an electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanometric charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using a conventional three-electrode cell at room temperature by the CHI760E electrochemical workstation. Before testing for activation, the working electrode was put in the electrolyte (3 M KOH + 0.5 M LiOH) for 12 h. The loading mass of the active material was 2–3 mg. The LAND CT2001A battery test system was used for long cyclic stability.
The specific capacitance was calculated from the galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) curve using the following equation:  where C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, I (A g−1) is the current density, Δt (s) is the discharging time, m (g) is the loaded weight of the active material and ΔV is the voltage window during discharging.

2.3.1. Fabrication of the asymmetric device. 
Activated carbon (AC) was used as the negative electrode, and the hollow sphere NaNiF3 nanocrystals were used as the positive electrode. Both electrodes were prepared using the same abovementioned procedure used for the preparation of the individual electrode, except that Ni foam was used as the current collector instead of the carbon fiber paper. NKK, a TF4840 separator with a 3 M KOH + 0.5 M LiOH electrolyte, was used for the fabrication of the ASC. The mass balance equation was used to calculate the mass ratio between the cathode and the anode.    



The loaded amount of the active material was 4–6 mg cm−2. The energy density and power density were calculated by the following equations:    where E (W h kg−1) is the energy density, C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, V is the voltage window, P (W kg−1) is the power density and Δt (s) is the discharging time.

3. Results and discussions
The synthetic procedure for the preparation of the hollow sphere perovskite fluorides is schematically described in Fig. 1a. The formation mechanism of the hollow sphere included recrystallization accompanied by a morphology and phase change process, which has been described in detail hereinafter.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the formation of the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 (a). SEM images obtained at different time intervals: 6 h (b), 12 h (c), 18 h (d) and 24 h (e). 
The obtained product was composed of sheets after 6 h of heating (Fig. 1b). All the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern (Fig. 2, black line) can be indexed to Ni(OH)2 (JCPDF# 38-0715) and NaNiF3 (JCPDF# 70-2401). An increase in the heating time influenced the morphology and crystal nature of the product. Dramatic changes occurred in both the morphology and the crystal nature after the heating time was increased to 12 h. The major peaks for NaNiF3 were obtained with some minor peaks of Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 2, red line), and the sheets were converted into nanocrystals (Fig. 1c). The pure phase perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 was obtained (Fig. 2, blue line) after 18 h of heating with a mixture of hollow spheres and nanocrystals (Fig. 1d). A further increase in the heating time did not affect the crystal nature of the obtained product (Fig. 2, green line). After 24 h of heating, uniform hollow spheres were obtained (Fig. 1f). According to the abovementioned results, we proposed the mechanism for the synthesis of the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3. The hollow sphere underwent recrystallization accompanied by a morphology and phase change process. At low heating times, Ni(OH)2 was obtained with a sheet-like morphology. By increasing the heating time, Ni(OH)2 was converted into NaNiF3 nanocrystals. After a further increase in the heating time, hollow spheres were formed by the self-aggregation of nanocrystals.

Fig. 3a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared perovskite fluoride NaNiF3, which displays a uniform hollow spherical structure with diameters in the range of 1–2 μm. From the high magnification image, it was revealed that the hollow sphere was constructed by the nanocrystals of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 (Fig. 3b). The TEM images also confirmed the uniform and hollow nature of the spheres, which were composed of the NaNiF3 nanocrystals (Fig. 3c and d). The crystalline structure was further proved by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The average adjacent lattice spacing of ∼2.72 Å corresponded to the crystal plane (112) of orthorhombic NaNiF3 (JCPDF 70-2401), which well-matched with the XRD analysis results. Fig. 3e presents the SAED pattern of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres, which displays clear and bright diffraction spots in the rings, implying their well crystalline nature. The typical (011)/(101)/(111) crystalline planes for standard NaNiF3 can be easily identified, which also correspond to those in the XRD results. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping (Fig. 3f) was used to investigate the elemental distribution of NaNiF3. Targeted elements (Na/Ni/F) were detected for NaNiF3 with a uniform distribution, which would ensure the consistent electrochemical performance of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres as an electrode for the supercapacitor.

The phase composition and crystallinity of the obtained perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres was determined by X-ray powder diffraction. Fig. 4a shows the typical XRD pattern of the as-prepared perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres. All the diffraction peaks well-matched to the standard JCPDS card 70-2401 with an orthorhombic structure and the space group of Pnma (62). The observed peaks at 23.07°, 32.35°, 32.87°, 33.35°, 37.2°, 39.06°, 47.15°, 52.44°, 53.13°, 58.04°, 59.3°, and 68.93° could be assigned to the (101), (200), (121), (002), (102), (112), (202), (301), (222), (321), (123), and (242) planes, respectively, revealing the formation of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3; moreover, peaks related to impurities were not observed. The chemical composition and electronic structure of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A full X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres (Fig. 4b) displayed clear signals of Na 1s, Ni 2p and F 1s. In the wide scan spectra, the C 1s peak was associated with the underlying carbon tape, which was used to fix the sample (considered as a reference); in addition, the appearance of the O 1s peak could be attributed to air contact. The Gaussian fitting of the Ni 2p elements afforded peaks that could be attributed to the two-spin orbit doublets of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 at the binding energies of 858 and 876 eV, respectively. The two shakeup satellites could be attributed to the characteristic oxidation peaks of Ni2+ and Ni3+ (Fig. 4c). The perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 structure with rich Ni2+ and Ni3+ electroactive species was responsible for this extraordinary electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. In the fluoride spectrum, the only one peak centered at 684.9 could be attributed to the metal–F bond (Fig. 4d). As observed from the XPS spectra, the atomic percentage ratio of Na, Ni and F was 1:1:3, respectively, further confirming the formation of the perovskite (NaNiF3) structure.

Nitrogen absorption measurements were used to evaluate the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the as-prepared perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres. The isotherm could be classified into type IV with an H2 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of 0.45–0.9, indicating the presence of micro and mesopores. The obtained hollow spheres of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 exhibited the maximum specific surface area of 33.33 m2 g−1 with the pore volume of 0.102 cm3 g−1 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Thermogravimetric analysis showed the thermal stability of the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3. Only 11% weight loss was observed due to the evaporation of adsorbed water and some organic impurities (Fig. S2, ESI†).
The electrochemical capacitance of the obtained perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow sphere electrode was investigated by the most prominent techniques, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements, in a mixture of the KOH and LiOH (3 M + 0.5 M) electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves at different scan rates (5–20 mV s−1) in the voltage window from 0 to 0.6 V. All the CV curves showed a pair of redox peaks, suggesting a capacitance behavior based on faradaic processes in which electrolyte adsorption took place on the surface of the electroactive material during a reversible process. Note that the clear and sharp oxidation (0.36 V at 5 mV s−1) and reduction (0.15 V at 5 mV s−1) peaks indicated an ultra-high capacitive behavior. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the nickel spectrum of the active material in the charged state. The possible working mechanism for NaNiF3 is presented below: Ni2+ + 3OH− → NiOOH + H2O + e−(i)

(c) Specific capacitance calculated at different current densities. (d) Cycling performance at the scan rate of 20 A g−1 for 8000 cycles. 
Due to electrode polarization, the positions of the peaks in the CV curves were slightly shifted from high to low voltage directions with the increasing scan rate. However, the shape of the CV curves was retained; this indicated its good rate capability. Fig. 5b shows the galvanostatic charging–discharging (GCD) curves at the current densities of 5, 10, 20 and 50 A g−1. The nonlinear character of the charging–discharging curves revealed the pseudocapacitive process, which was also confirmed by the CV results. The specific capacitances at various current densities are shown in Fig. 5c. The obtained hollow spheres of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 1342 F g−1 at the current density of 5 A g−1 and 1080 F g−1 at the current density of 50 A g−1, which was 80% of the capacitance calculated at 5 A g−1; this indicated the excellent rate capability of the electrodes. The Nyquist plot (Z′ vs. −Z′′) derived from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Generally, the small semicircle followed by an almost vertical line represents the ideal behavior of SCs. The Nyquist plots of the perovskite electrodes showed a small semicircle and an almost vertical line, which supported the better capacitive properties of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres. The serial resistance (intercept on the real axis) and charge transfer resistance (diameter of the semicircle) of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 were much lower than those of most of the state-of-the-art electrode materials for supercapacitors. The serial resistances were composed of the contact resistance (between the active material and the current collector) and intergranular electronic resistance (between active particles), whereas the charge transfer resistance was associated with the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Rs and Rct values for NaNiF3 were 1.57 Ω and 0.8 Ω, respectively. The very small values indicated fast kinetics and an improved capacitive behavior. To further investigate the high performance and long-term sustainability of the electrode, a cyclic stability test was performed (Fig. 5d). The hollow spheres of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 showed a very small decay after 5000 cycles performed at a high current density (20 A g−1) and more than 90% retention after 8000 cycles (Fig. 5d). This wonderful performance of the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres exceeded that of numerous perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode materials for supercapacitors (Table S1, ESI†). Similar results were also observed when nickel was used as a current collector (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The energy density and power density of the as-prepared hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 were further investigated to determine the practical application of the supercapacitor. An asymmetric full cell device was fabricated using the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode in a 3 M KOH + 0.5 M LiOH aqueous electrolyte. The three-electrode performance of activated carbon is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Fig. 6a shows the cyclic voltammetry curves at different scan rates (5–80 mV s−1) in the voltage window of 0–1.65 V. The CV curves clearly showed the dual nature of the capacity, battery-type (redox peaks) as well as electric double-layer capacitor (rectangular shape). The area under the curve increased upon increasing the scan rate. However, the position and shape of the CV curve remained the same; this indicated the best rate performance of the device. The cell voltage of the NaNiF3//AC cell could reach up to 1.65 V (Fig. S6, ESI†), which was much higher than that of conventional carbon-based supercapacitors in an aqueous electrolyte (≈1 V)15 as well as most of the reported perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode materials (Table 1). Cell voltage is directly related to energy density (E = 0.5CV2). Therefore, the high cell voltage of the NaNiF3//AC device was responsible for the obtained high energy density, which was also higher than those of most of the reported perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode materials. Fig. 6b shows the GCD curves at the current densities of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 A g−1. In the GCD curves (Fig. 6b), the linear relationship between the charge/discharge voltage and time indicated the capacitor-like behavior.27 The specific capacitance was calculated on the basis of the GCD curves using the mass of the hollow sphere perovskite NaNiF3 and activated carbon (Fig. 6c). Fig. 6c shows the configuration of the NaNiF3//AC asymmetric device. The maximum calculated specific capacity was 137 F g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1, which was much higher than those of the recently reported perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode materials such as SCN//AC (113.8 F g−1),22 Ni–Co–F//AC (70 F g−1),28 KNi0.8Co0.2F3//AC (54 mA h g−1),25 and hollow hetero-NCCS//AC (85 F g−1).29

Fig. 6d displays the Ragone plots for the energy storage performance of the ASC device along with those of the recently reported perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode materials for comparison. NaNiF3//AC with the cell voltage 1.65 V exhibited the maximum energy density of 51.78 W h kg−1 at the power density of 1.65 kW kg−1, which still retained 40.33 W h kg−1 at the power density of 13.2 kW kg−1. The obtained maximum energy density was higher than those of most of the reported perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode material-based ASCs (Table 1) such as KNi0.8Co0.2F3//AC (42.7 W h kg−1 at 0.242 kW kg−1),25 SCN//AC (37.6 W h kg−1 at 0.4339 kW kg−1),13 CoMoO4@graphene//AC (21.1 W h kg−1 at 0.3 kW kg−1),30 amorphous Ni(OH)2//AC (35.7 W h kg−1 at 0.49 kW kg−1)31 and Co3O4@Ni(OH)2//AC (40 W h kg−1 at 0.349 kW kg−1).32
A robust and stable cyclic life of the supercapacitor is very important for its practical applications. In this study, the long-term cyclic performance of the ASC device was assessed in the 0–1.65 V voltage window for 10000 cycles at the discharge current density of 10 A g−1 (Fig. 6e). The ASC device exhibited excellent stability with more than 90% capacity retention after 1400 cycles and 100% retention from 1400 to 10000 cycles. The gradual increase in capacity during the first 400 cycles was due to activation of the electrode material. The stable charge–discharge curves for the last ten cycles (inside in Fig. 6e) provided further evidence for the long-term stability of the NaNiF3//AC ASC device. The image in the inset of Fig. 6e shows the lighting of the LED when the two ASC devices were connected in series, thus demonstrating the high energy and power density of the ASC device. This wonderful performance with high specific capacitance, high energy and power density and long cyclic stability exceeded that of numerous perovskite oxides, fluorides and other state-of-the-art electrode materials for ASC devices (Table 1). A similar performance for the asymmetric device was observed using carbon fiber paper as the current collector instead of nickel foam (Fig. S7, ESI†).
4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated a new approach for the synthesis of the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3via a simple one-step and cost-effective solvothermal strategy. These perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres were used for the first time as an outstanding electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The perovskite NaNiF3 hollow spheres exhibited a high specific capacitance (1342 F g−1 at 5 A g−1), excellent rate performance, and long cycle stability (more than 90% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles). Furthermore, for practical applications, an asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor with a wide voltage window (1.65 V) was reported by pairing the perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 hollow spheres as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. The NaNiF3//AC asymmetric device exhibited the maximum energy density (51.78 W h kg−1 at the power density of 1.65 kW kg−1) with an excellent cyclic stability (100% capacity retention from 1400 to 10000 cycles). These wonderful results demonstrate that the hollow sphere perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 has the potential for application in next-generation high-performance supercapacitors. We believe that this simple and cost-effective approach will generate new directions for the development of high energy/power density supercapacitors.
