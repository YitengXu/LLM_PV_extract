The nanoparticles exhibit an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (ca. 83%) and average recombination lifetime (ca. 600 ns) in toluene dispersion.
1. Introduction
Currently, scientists have shown great interest in organolead halide perovskites with the general formula of APbX3 (A = organic ammonium cation and X = halide anion). These compounds present a three-dimensional (3D) inorganic framework consisting of corner-sharing PbX6 octahedra and small-sized organic cations in the voids between the octahedra.
Organometal halide perovskites combine the favourable properties of the inorganic semiconductor, namely its excellent charge carrier mobility, with the flexibility and low-temperature processability of the organic material.1 In particular, methylammonium (MA) lead trihalide perovskite materials allow low-cost solution processing, and they absorb broadly across the solar spectrum. Easy and rapid generation of charge carriers, transport of both electrons and holes, and high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency are desirable properties for optoelectronic devices.2–5
The revolution in the use of hybrid perovskites as novel materials for solid state solar cells started in 2012, when Grätzel and Snaith reported, practically at the same time, photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies of 9.7% and 10.9%, respectively.6–8 In this regard, thin films of organometal halide perovskites have been recently prepared by vapour deposition; however, the functional perovskites have mostly been prepared as nanoparticulate materials using a template method, specifically by using the pores of mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3,9 which in the case of TiO2 also act as electron transporters. It is likely that these mesoporous materials also improve the uniformity of the perovskite coating.
Remarkably, thin films of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskites capped by poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, have shown high charge mobility and low bimolecular non-radiative recombination (PL decay of ca. 273 ns), thus making it possible to generate carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 1 micron; comparatively, the PL decay of MAPbI3 was ca. 96.6 ns, and the carrier diffusion length was ca. 100 nm.10
Recently, studies on the photophysical properties of simple solution-processed crystalline films of these organic–metallic mixed halides, prepared by spin coating followed by annealing at 100 °C and subsequent capping with a thin layer of PMMA, showed that, at room temperature, they exhibited moderate to high PL quantum efficiencies depending on the excitation density (from 35% at 25 μJ cm−2 to 70% at 1 mJ cm−2).4 The decreased PL efficiency at low excitation density was attributed to the presence of defects that caused non-radiative decay, and it was suggested that at high excitation density, the defects were filled and radiative recombination became dominant. Photoexcitation in the pristine perovskite caused the formation of free charge carriers within 1 picosecond; the carriers underwent bimolecular recombination on the time scale of tens of nanoseconds at higher excitation densities. The long carrier lifetimes, together with the exceptionally high luminescence yield of the films, were unique to these simply prepared inorganic semiconductors. The high PL efficiency evidenced the small contribution of non-radiative pathways to the PL decay of these materials; this is highly relevant and contrasts with the relatively low emission of other semiconductors, which are not capped with a high energy gap inorganic shell (such as CdSe nanoparticles).11
The improved performance of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite compared with that of MAPbI3 in meso-superstructured solar cells has been attributed to lower charge recombination rates rather than to better charge mobility.12
A critical issue of organolead iodide perovskite materials is their stability. MAPbI3 perovskite reverts to its precursors; this is attributed to the hydroscopic amine salts.13 However, the bromide-based perovskites have been proved to be less moisture-sensitive.14
Bromide MAPbBr3 perovskites can be applied as light absorbers for high energy photons, and they can serve as the front cell in tandem cells. This perovskite can provide a higher open-circuit voltage in perovskite solar cells than the iodide analogue.15,16 However, the optical performance of MAPbBr3 perovskite is considerably lower than that of the mixed Br/Cl perovskites.
Thin films of MAPbBr3−xClx perovskites have been prepared by spin-coating the mixtures of the perovskite precursors on top of an Al2O3 mesoporous layer, followed by heating at 100 °C. In particular, MAPbBr2.4Cl0.6 (λmax at 525 nm, average recombination lifetime, τav, 446 ns) exhibited the strongest PL emission among the mixed bromide/chloride perovskites. The τav of CH3NH3PbBr3−xClx perovskites was considerably longer than that of MAPbI3−xClx; this suggests that the former compounds have superior charge diffusion properties. Under the same conditions, MAPbBr3 perovskite showed a much shorter lifetime (τav of 100 ns; λmax at 530 nm).14
We recently reported that six-nm sized MAPbBr3 perovskite nanoparticles can exhibit a considerable PL quantum yield (ca. 20% as a colloidal solution and film; λmax at 530 nm) at low excitation densities.17 These nanoparticles were prepared by simply confining the 3D inorganic framework with octylammonium bromide (OABr). The method involved the use of a 1:1 molar ratio of the total ammonium salt and PbBr2 concentrations, an OABr/MABr molar ratio of 0.6:0.4, in the presence of oleic acid (OLA), and 1-octadecene (ODE). The role of the latter two compounds in the emissive properties of the nanoparticles, if any, was not studied. The electroluminescence measurements of the film prepared from the colloidal solution exhibited a response ten times greater than that of the bulk material.
Encouraged by our preliminary results and those mentioned above, we focused on improving the organic capping of the bromide nanoparticles, taking into account the fact that surface states would be highly accessible for passivation treatment.18,19 We envisaged that some methyl ammonium salt could be lost during the nanoparticle preparation, and that MABr/PbBr2 molar ratios greater than one could be advantageous.
We report here the preparation of highly dispersible MAPbBr3 nanoparticles (Fig. 1), which exhibit an extraordinarily high photoluminescence quantum yield and lifetime, in toluene solution and film, as well as high stability and photostability. These nanoparticles have been prepared by a non-template strategy, adjusting the molar ratio between the total ammonium salts and PbBr2, as well as the OABr/MABr/ODE molar ratio, and by eliminating the use of oleic acid.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and methods
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Toluene was of HPLC quality for spectroscopic measurements.

UV-visible measurements. 
UV-vis spectra were recorded at room temperature using a quartz spectrometer cuvette in a UV-visible spectrophotometer Agilent 8453E.


Photoluminescence steady state studies. 
Steady-state photoluminescence spectra (LPS-220B, motor driver (MD-5020), Brytebox PTI) were obtained at room temperature on a spectrofluorometer PTI equipped with a lamp power supply. Felix 32 analysis software was used to register the data. All the data were acquired using 1 × 1 cm2 path length quartz cuvettes.
The emission spectra (λexc = 350 nm) of the perovskites dispersed in toluene were measured under air atmosphere (unless otherwise indicated).
The photoluminescence spectra and quantum yields of the films were measured with a Hamamatsu C9920-02 absolute PL quantum yield measurement system (λexc = 350 nm).


Time resolved photoluminescence. 
Experiments were carried out using a Compact fluorescence lifetime spectrometer C11367, Quantaurus-Tau with a LED pulse light source of 340, 405, and 470 nm. The average lifetime was obtained from the tri-exponential decays.


Microscopy images. 
Structural and morphological characterization were performed using bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dark field TEM, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). All these characterization techniques were carried out using a field emission gun (FEG) TECNAI G2 F20 microscope, operated at 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by depositing a few drops of the perovskite solution on a carbon film supported on a copper grid (200 mesh); the samples were subsequently dried overnight.


X-ray power diffraction (XRPD). 
The XRDPD analysis was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance A25 diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54060 Å) radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and 30 mA, and LynxEye detector. The powder diffraction pattern was scanned over the angular range of 2-80° (2θ) with a step size of 0.020°, at room temperature.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). 
The spectra were acquired at room temperature using a Bruker DPX300 spectrometer with a 300 MHz Bruker magnet (7 T). The chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS).


Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). 
TGA was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e system with an operative temperature range of 25–1100 °C and 0.1 microgram sensitivity. The samples were heated from 25 to 800 °C with at a rate of 10 °C min−1, under a nitrogen flux of 40 mL min−1.


X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
XPS data were acquired with Specs using a Phoibos 150-9MCD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The incident radiation was 50 W. The C 1s peak at 285 eV was set as a reference for all XPS peak positions.

2.2 Synthesis of nanoparticles

Synthesis of POA1. 
A solution of oleic acid (OLA, 0.30 mmol, 85 mg) in 1-octadecene (ODE, 6.26 mmol, 2.0 mL) was stirred and heated to 80 °C, and then octylammonium bromide (OABr, 0.16 mmol, 33.5 mg) was added. Subsequently, methylammonium bromide (MABr, 0.24 mmol, 26.4 mg, dissolved in 100 μL of DMF) and lead(II) bromide (0.10 mmol, 36.7 mg, dissolved in 200 μL of DMF) were added. No color change was observed after the addition of lead(II) bromide. The solution was cooled to 60 °C and immediately after the addition of acetone (5 mL), the precipitation of a yellow precipitate was induced. The unreactive material was separated by centrifugation (7000 rpm, 10 min, 20 °C).
Samples POA2 and POA3 were prepared following the same procedure but in the absence of OLA and ODE, respectively (see Table S1† for details).


Film preparation. 
The quartz substrates were extensively cleaned using detergent, de-mineralized water, and isopropyl alcohol, successively, followed by 20 min of UV-ozone treatment to facilitate good thin film formation. A solution of perovskite in toluene was spin-coated on top of the quartz substrates at 1500 rpm over 60 s, resulting in the formation of the film.


Photostability assays. 
The photostabilities of POA1 and POA2 samples were analysed using two different irradiation sources. Thus, toluene colloidal solutions in 10 × 10 mm2 quartz cuvettes were irradiated in a Luzchem photoreactor equipped with eight visible lamps (380–490 nm, maximum at 419 nm with a dose of 70.02 Wm−2 in 401–700 nm range). The room temperature photoluminescence of the samples (λexc = 350 nm, λem = 521 nm) was recorded every 5 min.
In addition, 10 × 10 mm2 quartz cuvettes containing the colloidal solutions were placed in the sample-holder of a PTI-LPS-220B spectrometer equipped with a xenon lamp (75 W), and the samples were illuminated with UV light (λexc = 350 nm). The Felix 32 analysis software was used to register the data.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles
The preparation of the nanoparticles was attempted by following our previously reported non-template strategy,17 but using a larger molar ratio of the total ammonium (OABr plus MABr) and PbBr2 salts (specifically, 4:1) and varying the relative molar ratio between the ammonium salts (from 0.8:3.2 to 2.4:1.6). The amount of oleic acid (OLA) was maintained (3:1 OLA/PbBr2 molar ratio), while the ODE/PbBr2 molar ratio was fixed at 62.6:1.0. A control sample (Pc) lacking OABr was also prepared using the same reaction conditions and quantities of all the other compounds. As expected, the solid Pc obtained after precipitation/centrifugation from the control experiment was minimally dispersible in toluene, and it exhibited an emission maximum at λmax = 538 nm, i.e., at a wavelength close to that of the bulk MAPbBr3 perovskite. In contrast, we obtained a more dispersible and emissive perovskite (POA1) by adding OABr and using an OA/MA/PbBr2 molar ratio of 1.6:2.4:1. The change of the OA/MA/PbBr2 molar ratio to 2.4:1.6:1 led to a colloid solution whose emission spectrum showed several peaks, which evidenced the formation of a mixture of perovskites with different stoichiometry (spectrum not shown).
Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the comparison between the absorption and emission (λex = 350 nm) spectra of the toluene dispersion of Pc sample and that of POA1. The toluene dispersion of POA1 exhibited a peak emission that was considerably blue-shifted compared with that of Pc (513 nm vs. 538 nm). In addition, the emission spectrum of the film prepared from the toluene dispersion of POA1 exhibited a red-shifted peak at λmax = 526 nm, a slightly broader peak (full width at half maximum, fwhm, 36 nm vs. 31 nm), and a smaller emission quantum yield (34% vs. 67%) than that of the toluene dispersion.
We then evaluated the role of OLA in the optical properties of the nanoparticles. The preparation of the nanoparticles was carried out under the same reaction conditions, using the OA/MA/PbBr2 molar ratio of 1.6:2.4:1 and maintaining the amount of ODE, but in the absence of OLA (Table S1†). After precipitation and centrifugation, the solid POA2 was dispersed in toluene.
Interestingly, POA2 showed an improvement in the optical properties of both the colloidal perovskite solution and the film prepared from it (Fig. 2). Thus, (i) the absorption spectrum of the colloidal solution showed less scattering than that of the nanoparticles prepared in the presence of OLA, (ii) the nanoparticles exhibited an enhanced emission (ca. 83% yield for the colloid and 72% for the film), and (iii) the emission band of the film was even narrower (fwhm of 30 nm vs. 32 nm for the colloidal dispersion).

The role of ODE in the eventual optical performance of the nanoparticles was also analysed by preparing the nanoparticles under the same reaction conditions as for sample POA1 (OA/MA/PbBr2 molar ratio of 1.6:2.4:1, oleic acid/PbBr2 molar ratio of 3:1), but in the absence of ODE (Table S1†). This sample (POA3) exhibited an emission quantum yield ca. 52% in toluene dispersion and ca. 41% in the film (see spectra in Fig. S2†).
The influence of the alkyl-chain length of the longer ammonium salt on the emissive properties of the nanomaterial was also analysed (Table S2†). The reaction was carried out using ethylammonium bromide (EABr), hexylammonium bromide (HABr), and octadecylammonium bromide (ODABr) instead of OABr, and under all the same conditions as those used for the preparation of POA2. A non-dispersible perovskite was obtained in the case of EABr, while ODABr led to a perovskite with a lower-dimension framework (spectra not shown). However, HABr led to a perovskite (PHXA) dispersible in toluene, which exhibited a narrow emission at λmax 526 nm, i.e., 5 nm red-shifted compared to that of POA2 (Fig. S3†). The PL quantum yield was lower than that of POA1 and POA2 (specifically, 58% for the colloidal dispersion and 38% for the film).
Regarding the size of the particles, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analyses of the emissive samples showed that smaller nanoparticles were obtained in the absence of OLA and ODE. Thus, POA2 and POA3 consisted of spherical nanoparticles with average sizes of 5.5 ± 1.5 nm and 5.9 ± 1.8 nm, respectively (see Fig. 2 for POA2 and Fig. S2† for POA3), whereas POA1 comprised spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 7.0 ± 1.5 nm. In all the cases, most of the nanoparticles were embedded in an amorphous material forming plaques, which were smaller in the case of POA2 (mostly 60 × 50 nm2).
The fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of POA1 and POA2 nanoparticles showed that they possessed crystalline surfaces. The lattice spacing in the HRTEM images and FFT patterns were in agreement with the crystallographic parameters for the CH3NH3PbBr3 bulk material. The interplanar spacings determined from the FFT patterns were 5.91, 4.11, 3.48 and 2.94 Å, which can be attributed to the 001, 011, 111 and 002 family planes of the cubic phase structure of CH3NH3PbBr3 with Pmm space group.
In addition, the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis of solid POA1 and POA2 confirmed the phase purity of the perovskites as well as the crystallinity of the samples (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns of POA1 (a) and POA2 (b). The vertical bars correspond to the peaks of CH3NH3PbBr3 cubic phase. 
The XRPD pattern of the samples demonstrated that they presented an excellent fit to a single-phase model corresponding to the cubic phase of the hybrid organic–inorganic MAPbBr3 perovskite (a = 5.9334 (5) Å, space group = Pm3m).20,21 The XRPD peaks of the samples were very broad. This is consistent with the formation of MAPbBr3, mostly as nanoparticles, particularly in the case of POA2.
The X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS) spectra of POA1 and POA2 were analysed, using a C peak at 285.0 eV as reference. Remarkably, in general, all the peaks of POA2 were slightly shifted to a higher binding energy compared to those of POA1 (see Fig. S4–S8†). In both the samples, the XPS spectrum of Pb 4f showed two symmetric peaks attributed to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels at binding energies (BE) of ca. 138.7 eV and 143.6, respectively. The spin orbit split between the Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 levels was 4.9 eV, which agrees with the value reported in the literature (4.8 eV).22 The very small peak at a lower binding energy (ca. 136.8 eV) could be attributed to the presence of metallic lead, and has also been detected in the XPS spectra of CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 system.23
The Br 3d XPS BE of the perovskite was at ca. 69.1 eV. The N 1s XPS spectra showed the presence of one peak at 402.6 eV, corresponding to the –N– of the ammonium salts.24 In addition, a very small peak at ca. 400.0 eV was also detected in the case of POA1; this could be assigned to a small amount of free amines.25
The deconvolution of the C 1s XPS spectra presented two peaks at ca. 285.7 and 285.0 eV. The peak at the lower energy value can be attributed to C–C/C–H bond, as well as to the CC bond of OLA and ODE; the peak at 285.7 eV can be assigned to the C–N+ bond of the ammonium salts.26 The spectra showed the larger contribution of the peak at a BE of ca. 285.7 eV for POA2 compared to POA1; this is consistent with the results found for the analysis of the composition of the nanoparticles by 1H-NMR and TGA (see below).
Finally, in the case of POA1, the O 1s XPS band at 532.9 eV was accompanied by a small band at 528.8 eV, which was consistent with the presence of small amounts of PbO.27 The formation of PbO could be tentatively attributed to the presence of oleic acid in the preparation of the nanoparticles.28
The quantification of lead and bromine by XPS led to a 73:28 molar ratio for POA2, while the ratio was 68:32 for POA1.
3.2 Analysis of the composition of CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticle samples
The composition of POA1 and POA2, obtained after their precipitation/centrifugation steps, as well as the composition of the resulting supernatants, were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and 1H-NMR. Solvent removal from the supernatant, followed by the addition of ethyl ether, caused the precipitation of a solid (Ss). In addition, the ether solution was distilled, thus recovering ODE accompanied by OABr (plus OLA in the case of the synthesis of POA1).
The TGA of POA1 and POA2 samples was compared with that of the individual precursors (MABr, OABr, ODE, OLA, lead bromide), as well as with that of methylamine and octylamine (see TGA of all the precursors in Fig. S9–S11†). The peak of the first derivative indicates the point at which the greatest rate change on the weight loss curve occurred. The TGA of POA1 (Fig. 4) showed that it lost ca. 16.0% of its weight before reaching 200 °C, followed by a weight loss of ca. 24.0% before reaching 360 °C (corresponding to at least two different components), and then a weight loss of 56.6% before reaching 600 °C. The spectrum showed that 2.6% of the mass did not decompose or sublimate at temperatures above 800 °C. The remaining residue may consist of impurities present in the material or decomposition products. The peaks of the first derivative were at 178, 345, and 580 °C.
 Fig. 4  TGA heating curves of POA1 (black) and POA2 (green) nanoparticles expressed as weight% as a function of applied temperature (a) and the corresponding 1st derivative (b). 
The trend in the POA2 sample (Fig. 4) was considerably similar; however, the temperature of the first derivative peaks shifted to higher values (183, 358, and 616 °C), suggesting a higher stability of the components that were used to build the nanoparticles in the absence of oleic acid. Sample POA2 lost 17.63% weight before reaching 210 °C, followed by a weight loss of ca. 24.15% before reaching 380 °C (corresponding to at least two different components), and then a weight loss of 58.05% before reaching 650 °C. In addition, the sample completely sublimated at temperatures below 700 °C.
The first loss of weight in sample POA1 and sample POA2 could be attributed to the loss of octylamine; however, there was no match between the temperatures of the first derivative peaks of these peaks and those of the amines (Fig. S11†). In addition, MABr and OABr ammonium salts underwent weight loss at a temperature above 200 °C, and 100% weight loss occurred in one step, suggesting the sublimation of these materials (Fig. S9†).29–31 It has been previously suggested that the ammonium salts, such as MABr, are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the perovskite in the form of MA+/Br−, and as a consequence they can be released at a lower temperature than that required for the ammonium salt.32 The second step of the weight loss could be ascribed to the loss of ODE and the remaining ammonium salts (plus OLA in the case of POA1), while the third step is consistent with the loss of lead bromide from the perovskite. Interestingly, the sublimation temperature of the lead bromide in POA2 is closer to that of PbBr2 than to that of POA1.
In addition, the solids obtained after the precipitation/centrifugation of POA1 and POA2 (Ss1 and Ss2, respectively) were also studied by TGA. The spectra (Fig. S12 and S13†) showed the presence of ca. 13% lead bromide. This could be ascribed to the incomplete precipitation of the nanoparticles during the centrifugation step.
Further data on the composition of POA1 and POA2 samples were extracted from their 1H-NMR spectra, which provided information on the molar ratio of the organic components, combined with their TGA spectra, which provided information on the PbBr2 weight percentage in the isolated mass. Fig. S14–S17† show the 1H-NMR spectra of the pure precursors used in the quantification.
The 1H-NMR spectra of the supernatants were also analysed (spectra not included); the data obtained from these, combined with those of the corresponding samples (POA1 and POA2 spectra in Fig. S14† and 5, respectively; spectra of the precursors are included in Fig. S15–S18†), were consistent with the amount of material used in the preparation of the nanoparticles. The molar composition of POA1 and POA2 as well as the yield of isolated perovskite are shown in Tables S3 and S4.† These data indicated that the perovskite nanoparticles capped by the ammonium salts and ODE, which was incorporated into the organic capping via chain interdigitation between the alkyl chains, cooperated in their stability/dispersability.

It has been suggested that iodopentafluorobenzene passivates the excess of iodide ions on the surface of mixed halide (I, Cl) lead perovskites.33 Therefore, we propose that the ammonium moiety of OA binds to the under-coordinated bromide ions of the perovskite nanoparticles.
In addition, ODE may bind to under-coordinated lead ions on the perovskite crystal surface via its double bond, thus passivating these defect sites and decreasing the rate of non-radiative recombination in the perovskite. It has recently been reported that weak Lewis bases can play a relevant role in the emissive properties of perovskites. Moreover, Snaith et al. recently suggested that thiophene and pyridine can bind to the under-coordinated Pb atoms of mixed halide (Cl, I) lead perovskite films, thus enhancing their photoluminescence and solar cell performance (up to 16.5%).34,35
3.3 Time resolved photoluminescence analysis
Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy was used to study the recombination lifetimes of POA1 and POA2 perovskites (in both the colloidal solution and the film). The PL decays were registered at λemca. 520 nm, under both nitrogen and air atmosphere, and fitted with a triexponential function of time (t), (1)where τi represents the decay time and αi represents the amplitude of the component. The emission lifetimes and their corresponding contributions to the total signal are shown in Tables S5–S6.† The average recombination lifetimes (τav) were estimated with the τi and αi values from the fitted curve data according to eqn (2). (2)
The τav values for POA1 and POA2 showed a slight dependence on the excitation wavelength (340, 405, 470 nm) and on the presence of oxygen (Table 1). The toluene colloidal solutions of POA2 exhibited a considerably longer τav than POA1, reaching values close to 600 ns in solution and ca. 410 ns in film. The latter value is close to that recently reported for a MAPbBr3−xClx film. The radiative rate constant (kr) and non-radiative rate constant (knr) were estimated using eqn (3) and (4), where ΦPL is the photoluminescence quantum yield.

These data revealed the remarkably low value of knr, which was not only of the same order of magnitude as kr but was even five times lower, except for the POA1 film. This evidenced the considerable reduction of surface defects that otherwise would trap excited electrons and decrease the emissive properties of the perovskites.
3.4 Stability and photostability of POA1 and POA2 samples

POA2 stored as a solid in the dark and under air atmosphere preserved its emissive properties for more than five months, whereas POA1 was considerably less stable.
The photostability of POA1 and POA2 colloidal solutions under light irradiation in the presence and in the absence of air was studied under two different light sources: fluorimeter lamps (λex at 350 nm) and visible lamps (8 lamps, 400–700 nm, maximum centred at 420 nm). The UV irradiation of POA2 under air atmosphere led to a loss of 7% emission intensity in the first 30 min and an additional loss of 10% after the following 481 min (Fig. 6). Moreover, POA1 presented high photostability, with a decrease of luminescence of <10% after 183 min of excitation at 350 nm (figure not shown). Finally, the photoluminescence of POA2 decreased by only 6% after visible-light irradiation for 75 min under air atmosphere (Fig. S19†).

Conclusions
We have demonstrated here that highly luminescent and photostable CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoparticles can be prepared by following the strategies described for the synthesis of other materials confined in the three dimensions (i.e., zero-dimension materials). The completion of the coordination sphere of the ions at the nanoparticle surface may be the origin for the low non-radiative recombination rate constant of these nanoparticles. The ammonium cation may bind to the under-coordinated bromide anions, whereas a weak Lewis base, such as 1-octadecene, may bind to the under-coordinated Pb cations. The fine-tuning of the molar ratios of all the components eventually results in the formation of nanoparticles with a high photoluminescence recombination lifetime (>420 ns) and photostability under UV light (<18% emission loss after 8.5 h). This perovskite preserves its emissive properties in the solid state, which makes it promising for use in light emitting devices and photovoltaic applications.
