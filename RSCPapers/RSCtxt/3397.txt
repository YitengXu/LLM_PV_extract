    , Accepted 17th April 2015First published on 30th April 2015AbstractA triarylamine-based material DVTPD containing two styryl groups has been developed. Upon isothermal heating at 180 °C for 30 min, DVTPD can be thermally cross-linked to form a solvent-resistant layer to realize the fabrication of solution-processed multilayer devices. The crosslinked DVTPD (denoted as X-DVTPD) layer possesses not only hole-collecting ability (HOMO = −5.3 eV) but also electron-blocking capability (LUMO = −2.2 eV). By incorporation of an ionic dopant, 4-isopropyl-4′-methyldiphenyliodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenylborate) (DPITPFB), into the X-DVTPD material (1:10 in wt%), a favourable morphology of the dopant/matrix layer was formed and the hole-mobility is significantly improved by three orders of magnitude compared to its non-doped state. This DPITPFB:X-DVTPD (1:10 in wt%) layer was employed as the hole-transporting layer to fabricate polymer solar cell devices (PSCs). The EHOMO of the polymer in the active layer relative to the EHOMO of the X-DVTPD (−5.3 eV) governs the hole transportation highly associated with the device performance. The higher-lying EHOMO (−5.0 eV) of P3HT causes a large energy barrier for the hole transportation at the interface, leading to an unsatisfactory efficiency. The EHOMO level of the PTB7 copolymer (−5.15 eV) is closer to −5.3 eV. As a result, the PTB7-based device can achieve 80% of the efficiency obtained from the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device. Furthermore, the PBDCPDTFBT copolymer has the same EHOMO (−5.3 eV) with X-DVTPD. Consequently, the PBDCPDTFBT-based device showed a comparable efficiency of 5.3% to the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device. More importantly, PNDTDTFBT having the lowest-lying EHOMO of −5.4 eV exhibits superior performance with a high PCE of 6.64%, outperforming its reference PEDOT:PSS-based device. This simple and useful hole-transporting system integrating the crosslinking and doping strategies to replace PEDOT:PSS can be widely used in solution-processed organic electronic devices.
Introduction
Polymeric solar cells (PSCs) are promising alternatives for clean and renewable energy due to their potential to be fabricated on large area, light-weight and flexible substrates by solution processing techniques at a lower cost.1 PSCs consist of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer in which the p-type material and n-type material can form interpenetrating and bicontinuous charge pathways.2 Currently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs can reach higher than 8%.3 Highly transparent poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used hole-conducting layer in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and PSCs due to the high conductivity and Ohmic contact with ITO.4 However, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS could chemically etch the ITO surface, resulting in the degradation of the device.5 Furthermore, using water-dissolved PEDOT:PSS inevitably increases water and oxygen content in the devices, which is a major obstacle in the industrial manufacture. Other disadvantages of PEDOT:PSS such as unstable morphology,6 electrical inhomogeneity7 and electron-blocking inability8 were also documented. Therefore, searching for new organic materials to substitute the traditional PEDOT:PSS is desirable for both academic interest and industrial application.
Biphenyl diamine-based molecules such as TPD (N,N′-di-tolyl-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine) have been frequently used as the hole-transporting layers in organic light-emitting diodes owing to their good redox reversibility and electron-blocking ability.9 The TPD-based small molecules require sophisticated and time-consuming vacuum deposition to form thin films which suffer unsatisfactory morphological stability as a result of low glass transition temperatures.10 A more feasible method to make a TPD-based hole-transporting layer for PSCs is via a solution-processing technique. However, a problematic challenge in fabricating a multilayer device by spin coating is that the coated layer will be partially re-dissolved by the solvent used in the following processing step. To alleviate this problem, many strategies such as self-assembled layers,11 orthogonal solvents12 and chemical crosslinking13 have been presented. We have recently reported a crosslinkable TPD-based hole-transporting material (HTM) N, N′-bis(tolyl)-N, N′-bis(vinylphenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (DVTPD) (Fig. 1).14 The two styryl groups in DVTPD can undergo thermal-induced crosslinking without an initiator15 upon heating to form a robust and solvent-resistant layer, thus avoiding interfacial mixing. Although these materials can be technically inserted as an electron-blocking layer in the multilayer light-emitting diodes, integration with a PEDOT:PSS layer remains necessary to achieve the high-performance devices due to the fact that the limited effective conjugation length and the amorphous nature of TPD-based materials exhibit only moderate hole mobilities.14,16 Similarly, the attempt to completely replace the water-based PEDOT:PSS with a single crosslinked HTM layer for PSCs has not been successful so far.

Electrical doping in organic semiconductors has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy to improve the charge mobility and reduce the injection barrier.17 It is envisaged that the TPD derivatives incorporated with a p-dopant will greatly improve the mobility in comparison with the non-doped state, while maintaining their electron-blocking ability because of the intrinsic high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. Moreover, by simply adjusting the dopant/matrix ratio, the charge transporting properties of HTMs can be fine-tuned and controlled. Surprisingly, the combination of a crosslinkable HTM with a p-dopant for polymer solar cells is only sporadically reported.18 Ionic iodonium-based materials have been extensively synthesized and investigated.19 In this research, 4-isopropyl-4′-methyldiphenyliodonium tetrakis(penta-fluorophenylborate) (DPITPFB) is selected as an ionic p-dopant (Fig. 1). The hole-mobility of the crosslinked DVTPD (X-DVTPD) layer increases dramatically after p-doping of DPITPFB (ca. 9% in wt). With the higher mobility and better hole-collection ability, the solar cell devices using a X-DVTPD matrix p-doped with the DPITPFB exhibited significantly enhanced Voc, Jsc, and FF parameters leading to the power conversion efficiencies comparable to those of the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based devices. A detailed investigation and applications of PSCs will be discussed.
Results and discussion
Solvent-resistance after thermal crosslinking
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to determine the cross-linking temperature of DVTPD (Fig. 2). The exothermal peaks from 120 °C to 147 °C were observed in the first scan, which is indicative of thermal polymerization of the styryl groups, while no peak was observed during the second DSC scan. Solvent resistance of the crosslinked DVTPD matrix was evaluated by monitoring the UV-visible spectra of the thin films before and after rinsing with chlorobenzene which is a good solvent for DVTPD. (Fig. 3) The crosslinking degree (CD) of the X-DVTPD to quantify the solvent resistance is defined as the absorbance at 355 nm before rinsing versus after rinsing (afterλ355/beforeλ355). The isothermal heating at 170 °C for 15 min only led to a CD of 70%. Increase of the heating temperature to 180 °C improves the CD to 80%. Eventually, the isothermal heating at 180 °C for 30 min resulted in high solvent resistance with a CD up to 97%. In contrast, the pristine thin film without thermal-induced crosslinking showed almost no absorbance after rinsing, meaning that the uncrosslinked film does not have any solvent resistance. Based on the results, the isothermal heating at 180 °C for 30 min is selected as the crosslinking condition for device fabrication.

Mobility improvement by chemical doping
Chemical doping has been demonstrated as a useful strategy to improve the charge mobility of semiconductors. The mobility of the DPITPFB-doped X-DVTPD layer was measured by the hole-only devices fabricated with the configuration of ITO/DPITPFB:X-DVTPD/Au using space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) theory (Table 1).20 The DVTPD solution was first spin-casted on the ITO and heated at 180 °C for 30 min to form the X-DVTPD. In order to investigate the concentration effect of the dopant on the mobility, DPITPFB, dissolved in an environmentally friendly non-halogen solvent, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, see Fig. 1), was dropped on the surface of the X-DVTPD. After waiting for different times of 0, 15, 30 and 45 seconds for penetration, the substrates were spun at 6000 rpm and washed with PMA to remove the DPITPFB residue. Encouragingly, we found that the mobility is proportional to the dopant penetration time (Fig. 4(a)), which confirms that the DPITPFB can serve as a chemical dopant to increase the hole-mobility of X-DVTPD. After demonstrating the effect of DPITPFB, we directly added DPITPFB into the DVTPD solution with different weight ratios (DPITPFB:DVTPD = 1:12, 1:10, 1:5, 1:3 in wt%) for the fabrication of the hole-only devices (ITO/DPITPFB:X-DVTPD/DVTPD/Au) in which an additional neutral DVTPD layer was used as an electron-blocking layer. It should be noted that the incorporation of the DPITPFB into the X-DVTPD does not affect its crosslinking condition. The undoped X-DVTPD layer exhibited a mobility of 1.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. After doping with DPITPFB, the mobility dramatically increased by more than three orders of magnitude. When the content of the DPITPFB dopant increased in the matrix (1:12, 1:10, 1:5 in wt%), the mobility enhanced slightly to 5.7 × 10−3, 6.8 × 10−3, and 9.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, (Fig. 4(b)) with the concomitant reduction of the turn-on voltages. It is therefore envisaged that this dopant/matrix system could replace the PEDOT:PSS to function as a hole-transporting layer for the PSC applications.

Morphology of the dopant/matrix thin films
The blending ratio between the DVTPD and DPITPFB in the PMA solution will significantly influence the nanostructured morphology of the thin film which in turn plays an important role in determining the hole-mobility and electron-blocking ability. The DPITPFB is an ionic small molecule that tends to aggregate at high concentration. Consequently, too much DPITPFB dopant in the X-DVTPD matrix will detrimentally cause the formation of morphological defects due to phase separation. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the thin films with different DPITPFB:X-DVTPD weight ratios (Fig. 5). The non-doped X-DVTPD film exhibited a smooth root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.30 nm. However, the obvious particles were formed in the thin film in 1:3 ratio, and the roughness dramatically increased to 14.7 nm. The unfavourable morphology will lead to serious dark current and decrease in the fill factor and Jsc.21 When the content of DPITPFB was reduced to 1:5, the roughness of the thin films decreased to 1.9 nm. The thin film of 1:10 ratio showed a very homogeneous morphology with a roughness of 1.53 nm.

Covering ability of the dopant/matrix thin film
During the fabrication of the device, it is inevitable that some dust or particles in the atmosphere will deposit on the ITO surface. Deposition of the subsequent hole-transporting layer could generate the disconnected defects near the particles. Therefore, the ability of the hole-transporting layer to fully cover the shape of the particles is an important criterion to avoid severe defects in the solution-processable multilayer devices. To investigate the covering ability of the dopant/matrix system, we first intentionally dispersed silicon balls with a diameter of 2 μm on the ITO substrate. The DPITPFB:DVTPD blending solution was then spin-cast and crosslinked on top of the surface of the ITO. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the cross-section of the thin film. Fig. 6 shows that the edges of the silicon balls can be fully filled with the hole-transporting materials, indicating that the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer can thoroughly cover the particles to minimize the detrimental effects.

Device characteristics and performances
After demonstrating the capability of the DPITPFB-doped X-DVTPD layer to replace the water-based PEDOT:PSS, we incorporated this dopant/matrix system as the hole-conducting layer into the conventional multilayer solar cells. To test its widespread capability, three donor–acceptor copolymers PTB7,22 PBDCPDTFBT23 and PNDTDTFBT24 blended with PC71BM as well as P3HT blended with ICBA25 were chosen as the photoactive materials for investigation (see Fig. 1). The parameters and the J–V curves are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 7(a). The crosslinking feature of the DVTPD to overcome the interlayer erosion allows us to fabricate the multilayer device via the spin-coating method. The standard device based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDCPDTFBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al exhibited a PCE of 5.31% with a Jsc of 11.80 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.82 V, and a FF of 54.82%. By replacing the PEDOT:PSS with the non-doped X-DVTPD, the efficiency decreased dramatically to 1.07%, indicating the insufficient hole-mobility of the non-doped X-DVTPD layer. In contrast, when DPITPFB was doped into the X-DVTPD (1:10 in wt%) layer, the efficiency significantly enhanced to 5.30% which is already comparable to the PEDOT:PSS-based device. Note that its Jsc of 12.96 mA cm−2 is even higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based device (11.80 mA cm−2). Nevertheless, further increasing the content of DPITPFB to 1:5 and 1:3 adversely deteriorated the efficiency to 4.55% and 1.50%, respectively, which is ascribed to the unfavourable morphologies associated with the aggregation of DPITPFB at high concentration. Moreover, the optimal ratio of the DPITPFB:DVTPD (1:10 in wt%) is also adoptable to the PTB7:PC71BM-based and PNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based devices. The standard device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PNDTDTFBT:PC71BM/Ca/Al delivered a Jsc of 10.77 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 6.54%, while the counterpart device using the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer to replace PEDOT:PSS achieved an even higher Jsc of 11.69 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 6.64%. The EQE spectra of the two PNDTDTFBT:PC71BM-based devices are shown in Fig. 7(b). On the other hand, the PTB7:PC71BM-based device using PEDOT:PSS exhibited a PCE of 5.03%, while the corresponding device using the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer showed a slightly decreased PCE of 4.46%. However, when the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer was applied to the P3HT:ICBA system, the efficiency of the device greatly decreased to 1.92%, which is much inferior to the PEODT:PSS-based device with a PCE of 4.77%. Based on the analysis of the results, we observed that the variations in the device performance are highly dependent on the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) of the p-type polymers. The energy diagrams of the polymers and X-DVTPD are illustrated in Fig. 8(a), while Fig. 8(b) shows the efficiency of the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD-based devices relative to the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based devices as a function of the HOMO of the used polymer. The EHOMO for P3HT, PTB7, PBDCPDTFBT and PNDTDTFBT is estimated to be −5.0, −5.15, −5.3, and −5.4 eV, respectively. The EHOMO of X-DVTPD is ca. −5.3 eV. The energy offset between the EHOMO of the two adjacent layers plays an important role in determining the hole-transportation at the interfaces. The EHOMO of P3HT (−5.0 eV) lies much higher than the X-DVTPD (–5.30 eV). The unmatched energy alignment between the two layers makes the hole extraction from the active layer to the HTL more difficult due to the large energy barrier (0.3 eV difference), leading to the much decreased Jsc (from 8.62 to 7.56) and FF (from 69.2 to 32.4%) compared to the standard PEDOT:PSS-based device. When the PTB7 copolymer (EHOMO = −5.15 eV) was employed, the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer became more effective in transporting holes owing to the reduced energy offset (0.15 eV). Therefore, the device produced about 85% of efficiency obtained from the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device. The PBDCPDTFBT copolymer has an identical EHOMO of −5.3 eV with the X-DVTPD. Without the energy barrier at the interface, the PBDCPDTFBT-based device exhibited as good efficiency (5.3%) as the PEDOT:PSS-based device. More interestingly, the EHOMO of PNDTDTFBT (−5.4 eV) is even lower than that of the X-DVTPD, which provides a downhill charge transportation pathway. As a result, the PNDTDTFBT-based device using the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer delivered superior performance to the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device. These findings suggest that the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD system is specifically suitable and applicable for the low-band-gap polymers with an EHOMO lower than −5.3 eV. Fortunately, the current successful p-type polymers have much lower-lying EHOMO which is an important criterion to reach the high Voc for better performance. This distinct HOMO and Voc relationship was also observed in our device characteristics showing that the PNDTDTFBT-based device has the highest Voc of 0.84 V (EHOMO = −5.4 eV), followed by the PBDCPDTFBT-based device with a Voc of 0.8 V (EHOMO = −5.3 eV), and the PTB7-based device with a Voc of 0.7 V (EHOMO = −5.15 eV). It should also be emphasized that the EHOMO of the crosslinkable host material can be tuned through molecular engineering in order to match the energy alignment of the different polymer materials.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a styryl-functionalized triarylamine-based DVTPD material which can be thermally crosslinked at 180 °C for 30 min to form a solvent-resistant thin film with good coverage ability for the fabrication of multilayer solar cells. The hole mobility of the crosslinked DVTPD can be significantly enhanced by three orders of magnitude through incorporating an ionic DPITPFB dopant. The relative weight ratio between the DPITPFB and DVTPD was optimized to be 1:10 to achieve a good charge mobility and favourable morphology. The DPITPFB:X-DVTPD hole-transporting layer, processed by a non-halogen PMA solvent, was used to fabricate a series of devices incorporating p-type copolymers PTB7, PBDCPDTFBT, PNDTDTFBT and P3HT with different EHOMO levels. The corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based devices were fabricated for comparison. It is found that the device performance is highly dependent on the energy offset between the EHOMO of the X-DVTPD (−5.3 eV) and the EHOMO of the polymer used in the active layer. The P3HT:ICBA-based device with the EHOMO (−5.0 eV) of P3HT upwardly deviating from −5.3 eV showed an inferior device performance due to the high energy barrier for charge transportation at the interface. With the EHOMO level of PTB7 being closer to −5.3 eV, the PTB7-based device showed much improved device efficiency. Because the EHOMO of PBDCPDTFBT is also at −5.3 eV, the PBDCPDTFBT-based device exhibited an identical efficiency of 5.3% compared to the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device. More importantly, PNDTDTFBT having the lowest-lying EHOMO of −5.4 eV exhibited superior performance with a high PCE of 6.64%, outperforming the corresponding PEDOT:PSS-based device. In this research, we have successfully developed a simple and useful dopant/matrix strategy to achieve high-performance PEDOT:PSS-free polymer solar cells.
Experimental section
For the devices with a PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al4083) layer, a filtered (at 0.45 μm) solution of PEDOT:PSS was spun-cast onto a pre-cleaned ITO substrate (thickness is around 30 nm), and baked at 150 °C for 10 min in a glovebox. For the devices with a DPITPFB: X-DVTPD layer, the DVTPD was dissolved in PMA with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1, and DPITPFB was added in the weight ratio needed (3:1, 5:1, 10:1, 12:1 in wt%). The filtered solution (at 0.45 μm) was spin-cast onto a precleaned ITO substrate (thickness is around 30 nm), and baked at 180 °C for 30 min for cross-linking in a glovebox. After the cross-linking step, the device was kept in the glovebox for one day. The photoactive layer was deposited by spin-coating the filtered o-dichlorobenzene solution of the polymer:PC71BM on the DPITPFB:X-DVTPD layer, or PEDOT:PSS, or bare ITO in the glovebox. Then, the devices were covered with shadow masks to define the active area (0.04 mm2) and were transferred to a thermal evaporator. The electrode consisting of calcium (35 nm) and aluminum (150 nm) was thermally evaporated on the active layer sequentially. PTB7 was purchased from Lumtec, and PC71BM was purchased from UR. PTB7 was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (PTB7:PC71BM weight ratio is 1:1.5) and 3 vol% diiodooctane. PBDCPDTFBT was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 6 mg mL−1 (PBDCPDTFBT:PC71BM weight ratio is 1:3). PNDTDTFBT was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (PNDTDTFBT:PC71BM weight ratio is 1:1.2). P3HT and ICBA were both purchased from Lumtec. P3HT was dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene with a concentration of 1.7 wt% (P3HT:PC61BM weight ratio is 1:1). For hole-only device fabrication, the configuration of the device was ITO/doped X-DVTPD/neutral DVTPD/Au. The hole mobilities were calculated according to space-charge-limited-current theory (SCLC). The J–V curves were fitted according to the following equation: J = (9/8)εμ(V2/L3), where ε is the permittivity of the blend film, μ is the hole mobility, and L is the film thickness. All the devices were analyzed under air conditions using a Keithley 2400 SMU source measurement unit and the Oriel Xenon lamp (450 W) with an AM1.5 filter as the solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a standardized reference silicon solar cell to 100 mW cm−2.
