    , Accepted 19th January 2016First published on 19th January 2016AbstractKesterite-structure Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has been proved to be a high-performance Pt-free counter electrode (CE) material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, a green but powerful two-step method based on solvothermal treatment was proposed to synthesize semi-transparent two-dimensional (2D) leaf-like CZTS plate arrays (PLAr) in situ on a FTO glass substrate, without any post-treatments, such as annealing, toxic sulfurization, or coating with other ancillary materials. The growth mechanism of the 2D leaf-like CZTS PLAr based on solvothermal treatment was illustrated. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.09% was obtained by utilizing leaf-like CZTS PLAr as the CE. Surprisingly, the PCE increased to 8.67% assisted by a mirror reflection. The excellent performance of DSSCs could be attributed to the high catalytic surface area, fast photo-generated electron transport at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface, remarkable electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction, low charge transfer resistance toward the reduction of I3− ions, and high diffusion coefficient of the I3−. This work provides a green and feasible approach to construct high-quality metal sulfide nanoarrays on arbitrary conductive substrates under mild conditions (i.e. low temperature, no annealing, green, speediness) and promotes the development of Pt-free sulfide materials for sustainable photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Under the threat of global warming and energy crises, the utilization of green/renewable energy is becoming more and more essential.1,2 Thin-film sensitized solar cells (dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)) have attracted much attention due to their advantages of environmental friendliness, high-throughput manufacturing methods, potentially low production costs, and relatively high efficiency (η = 13%).2–6 Basically, typical DSSCs have a sandwich-type structure, consisting of a platinized fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as the counter electrode (CE), a liquid electrolyte that traditionally contains I−/I3− redox couples as a conductor to electrically connect the two electrodes, and a porous-structured oxide film adsorbed with dye molecules as the photosensitized anode.6,7 As an essential and crucial component in DSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) behaves as a catalyst for the redox couple regeneration in the electrolyte, as well as an electron collector from the external circuit. The CE materials should possess two advantages of high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity.8 Generally, platinum (Pt) deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is usually employed as the CE for DSSCs, presenting high catalytic activity, high efficiency and long-term stability.9 However, the high cost and low natural abundance of Pt have been a major concern. Furthermore, Pt can be dissolved in iodic electrolyte solution and decomposed to unwanted PtI4 and H2PtI6 by-products in the long term.10 Hence, to address the problem of high cost and instability for the Pt CE, many alternative Pt-free materials have been proposed to be used as CE catalysts, including carbon materials (carbon black,11 graphite,12 carbon nanotubes,10 graphene,11etc.), conducting polymers (polyaniline, poly-(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT), etc.), and inorganic compounds (transition metals in the form of oxides, nitrides, carbides, and sulfides8,10,13,14). In recent years, p-type kesterite-structure Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has been proved to be a highly catalytic CE material, due to its advantages of earth abundance (Pt: 0.0037 ppm, Cu: 50 ppm, Zn: 75 ppm, Sn: 2.2 ppm), low-toxicity, a direct band gap of 1.5 eV, and excellent catalytic ability towards the I3− electrolyte. The performance of the DSSCs with CZTS is comparable to that of the cell with Pt, indicating the high potential for CZTS to replace Pt in DSSCs.14 Many approaches have been developed to fabricate CZTS thin film counter electrodes, such as vacuum based deposition (pulsed laser deposition, evaporation and sputtering), chemical vapour deposition, electrodeposition, and solution-based processing (solvothermal or hot-injection methods to synthesize CZTS nanoparticles with post coating and sulfurization). The related CZTS-based device properties of the above reports are summarized in Table S1.† However, most of the aforementioned research studies were focused on the special morphology construction, high crystallization, and super catalytic activity towards the reduction of the ions in electrolytes. Application of rigorous synthesis techniques is unavoidable, such as high vacuum conditions, high annealing temperatures (300 °C–600 °C), using excessive, expensive and toxic organic ligands to control the unique morphology, adopting multiple steps (CZTS ink spin/spray coating with post annealing, more than 12 h solvothermal synthesis), and requiring a toxic sulfur source (H2S or sulfur vapour), to meet the above goals.14–22 In addition, flexible DSSCs based on conducting polymers as a substrate cannot bear heat treatment beyond 150 °C.22 There are no reports on the in situ fabrication of nanostructured CZTS thin films on conductive substrates through solution-based processing without any post-treatments (annealing or sulfurization). Thus, it is necessary to develop a simple, cost-effective, green, and in situ mild synthesis method for good-crystallinity, good-stability, and high-performance CZTS thin films for DSSC application.
Herein, we propose a facile, green but powerful solution method to synthesize semi-transparent two-dimensional (2D) leaf-like CZTS plate arrays (PLAr) in situ on a FTO glass substrate and use it directly as a CE to assemble DSSCs without any post-treatments, such as annealing, sulfurization, or coating with other ancillary materials. The Cu–Zn–Sn alloy composites were firstly electrodeposited on a FTO substrate and then were converted to CZTS directly by a novel solvothermal treatment at low temperatures and short reaction times. It is noteworthy that, as mentioned in the previous reported papers, the conventional solvothermal method was always adopted to synthesize nanostructured CZTS powders, and not to fabricate the CZTS thin film CE directly on the substrate. Furthermore, sulfurization or post heat treatment was essential to acquire the CZTS CE with good adhesion, high crystallization, and super catalytic activity, if the CZTS precursor film was obtained before. There are no reports on the synthesis of pure kesterite-structure CZTS thin films directly on the FTO substrate at 200 °C or below 300 °C. The solvothermally-obtained leaf-like CZTS PLAr film has good bonding strength, high catalytic surface area, high carrier mobility at the CE/electrolyte interface, and superior catalytic activity toward the reduction of I3−/I− ions. The 2D CZTS electrode was introduced as the CE for DSSCs to achieve a PCE of 7.09%, higher than that of the Pt CE. Surprisingly, when a mirror was placed under the testing cell, the PCE increased to 8.67%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the in situ solvothermal treatment to the construction of various sulfide-based nanostructure thin films for the green energy applications in DSSCs, as well as photocatalytic hydrogen generation, supercapacitors, and lithium ion batteries.
Experimental section
Materials
Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O), ethanol, and acetonitrile were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) in analytical purity. Tin(II) sulfate (SnSO4), zinc(II) sulfate monohydrate (ZnSO4·H2O), sodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H7O6·2H2O), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), lithium iodide (LiI), and iodine were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (China) with analytical purity. J & K Scientific Ltd (Shanghai, China) provided the sulfur in sublimed grade (99.5%). FTO glass (sheet resistance 7–8 Ω sq−1), N719 dye (0.3 mM (Bu4N)2[Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2]), and electrolyte (DHS-Et23) were obtained from OPV Tech Co., Ltd (China), Dyesol (Australia), and HeptaChroma (China) respectively. All chemicals in the experiments were used as received. Distilled water was used throughout the work.
Fabrication of CZTS plate array counter electrodes (CEs)
A semi-transparent film of CZTS plate arrays was in situ grown on a FTO glass substrate, first by using electrodeposition followed by adopting a novel solvothermal treatment (as shown in Fig. 1). In the electrodeposition process, metallic precursors of Cu, Sn, and Zn (CZT) films were electrodeposited on an FTO glass substrate simultaneously. The CZT composite layer was deposited at −1.17 V (vs. SCE) for 60 s using an electroplating bath containing 3.5 mM copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O), 2.1 mM tin sulfate (SnSO4), 20 mM zinc sulfate monohydrate (ZnSO4·H2O), and 50 mM sodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H7O6·2H2O). The deposition temperature was kept at 22 °C and the exposed geometric area of the FTO substrate (2 × 1.5 cm2) was 1.5 × 1.5 cm2. After electrodeposition, the CZT precursor film was soaked in distilled water and dried at 70 °C in air. The obtained CZT film on the FTO was converted to the CZTS film via a novel solvothermal treatment. In a typical solvothermal treatment, the CZT film (with the conductive area facing down), 35 ml ethanol and 2 mM (0.0641 g) excessive sulfur powders were put into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave successively. The autoclave was then maintained at 200 °C until the CZT precursor film had been reacted adequately. Various reaction periods (i.e., 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h) were used for the investigation of the conversion process. After the conversion process, the obtained dark brown film was washed with ethanol and dried at 70 °C. Finally, the CZT particle film on FTO was converted to leaf-like CZTS plate arrays (PLArs) without any post heat treatment. The Pt CE was purchased from Dyesol (Australia) for comparison.

Assembly of the DSSCs
For a fair comparison, all the DSSCs were fabricated with TiO2 photoanode materials relying on a standardized fabrication process. Firstly, the clean FTO substrate was subjected to TiCl4 aqueous solution (0.05 M) treatment for the duration of 30 min at 70 °C. A commercial TiO2 paste (P25, Degussa, Germany) was then coated on the above pre-treated FTO substrate by the doctor blading method. A portion of 0.20 cm2 was selected as the active photo-anode area. The TiO2-coated FTO glasses were gradually heated to 500 °C (rate = 2 °C min−1) in air and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min to create a TiO2 film. The total thickness of the TiO2 film was about 18 μm. After the heat treatment, the substrate was subjected to TiCl4 aqueous solution treatment again to acquire more dye absorption. Thereafter, the 80 °C baked electrode was immersed in solution, containing 0.3 mM N719 dye in anhydrous ethanol for 24 h at room temperature under dark conditions. The TiO2 electrode was coupled with one of the various CEs (CZTS and commercial Pt) to fabricate the DSSCs. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the two electrodes by capillarity, and the hole was sealed with hot-melt glue after the electrolyte injection.
Characterization
The crystalline phase and purity of CZTS samples were examined by using a X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU, Smartlab TM9 KW, Cu Kα radiation at λ = 1.541 Å,) operated at 40 kV/200 mA, and a confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw, inVia) using the 488 nm laser line of an air cooled Ar-ion laser. The optical images were obtained by using a digital camera. The morphologies of the synthesized nanostructures were observed by using field-emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACHI, SU-4800) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker, Dimension Icon). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) from FE-SEM was used for the elemental analysis of the CZTS films. The detailed nanostructures and crystal structures were further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2), coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and EDS mapping. The thin films were scraped from their substrates and dispersed in ethanol to form the suspensions for TEM observation. The assembled DSSCs were illuminated by using a solar simulator (94042A, AM1.5 G, Newport, America), and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (91150 V, Newport, America), so as to measure the J–V curves of the solar cell devices. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in acetonitrile solution consisting of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in a three-electrode system, by using a CHI 660E potentiostat, in which the as-fabricated CEs acted as the working electrode, in addition to a Pt sheet (6 cm2) counter electrode and a Ag/Ag+ (CHI 112) couple served as a reference electrode. Tafel polarization curves were obtained using symmetrical cells, at 10 mV s−1, using a CHI 660E potentiostat with a two-electrode system. The symmetrical cell contained two identical electrodes and the film area was confined to be 0.25 cm2. The two electrodes were separated by using a 60 μm thick Teflon tape. The EIS tests of the symmetric thin layer CEs were carried out in the frequency ranging from 0.05 to 106 Hz at 0 V bias with a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV, under dark conditions, using a system of Solartron Sl 1260 and 1287 (Electrochemical interface, the United Kingdom). The impedance spectra were analyzed using equivalent circuit models by using ZView fitting software.
Results and analysis
Fabrication of transparent leaf-like Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) plate arrays (PLAr)
The fabrication process of the leaf-like CZTS PLAr CE is schematically indicated in Fig. 1. There are two stages in the preparation of a high-performance and low-cost CZTS CE. A precursor metallic film composed of Cu, Sn, and Zn is firstly electrodeposited on a FTO glass substrate under potentiostatic control without stirring. Then the precursor CZT film is under solvothermal treatment in a sealed autoclave containing sulfur powders and ethanol for 6 h. It is mentioned in previous studies that homogeneous deposition of the metallic precursor is important to obtain a compact and robust multi-metal sulfide film.23–26 Hence, various parameters (such as concentrations and potential) for electrodeposition of metallic elements were adjusted, specifically for Sn and Zn deposition. Because the Sn prefers to form a lump morphology and the Zn tends to become island shaped most likely due to the side reaction of H2 evolution. As reported in the Experimental section, we finally achieved the best conditions.
Optical and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the as-prepared CZTS films are presented in Fig. 2. It is apparent from the optical images that all the films on the FTO substrate are semi-transparent. The excellent transmittance suggests the CZTS film potential for more light coming into the cells from the counter electrode, so as to improve the photovoltaic performance. After the transformation of the CZT precursor film into CZTS, the color changes from light brown to dark brown, as the CZTS phase can absorb the visible light ranging from ca. 400 to 800 nm. The resulting CZTS film shows a ca. ∼350 nm thick homogeneous and compact layer. Moreover, the whole FTO substrate is uniformly covered by solvothermal-synthesized leaf-like CZTS PLAr with a width of ca. ∼350 nm and a thickness of ca. ∼30 nm. The surface of the CZTS plate is extremely rough and composed of numerous pyramidal nanoparticles with an expanding specific surface area, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and S1.† This unique leaf-like structure is beneficial for higher catalytic activity, as more and more electrolyte can adsorb on the CZTS PLAr and the photo-generated electrons can transfer through the plate arrays into the conductive substrate quickly and effectively. Notably, all the elements are homogeneously distributed over a single CZTS plate (Fig. 4(e and f)).

The phase-structural properties of the as-synthesized CZTS CE are illustrated in Fig. 3. The observed diffraction peaks show that kesterite-structure CZTS films (JCPDS 26-0575) are obtained during solvothermal treatment. The three strong diffraction peaks around 28.5°, 32.9°, and 47.3° are assigned to those crystal faces of (112), (200), and (220) respectively. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the XRD profiles of tetragonal Cu2SnS3 (JCPDS 89-4714) and cubic ZnS (JCPDS 80-0020) are similar to that of the kesterite CZTS phase.15,18,27 The further structural information of the sample on the macroscopic scale is obtained from the Raman spectrum. The peaks from Cu2SnS3 (352 cm−1), ZnS (346 cm−1), and Cu2−xS (475 cm−1) phases are not observed in Fig. 3(b). The biggest Raman peak at 338 cm−1 is from the kesterite CZTS phase.15 These results exclude the presence of other binary or ternary sulfide compounds, with only CZTS existing, which are similar to those in previous reports.15,27 Hence, the pure kesterite-structure CZTS CE is obtained through novel solvothermal treatment for 6 h.

It is noted that the thicker CZTS film for Raman characterization was fabricated with the CZT electrodeposition time extension to 10 min. 
To further study the detailed structures of the products, TEM measurements were subsequently performed. The light contrast in various areas of the TEM image indicates the thin two-dimensional (2D) nature of the plate-like nanostructures. Besides, the curled edge shows that the CZTS plates are composed of multiple layers with a thickness of ca. 30 nm (also confirmed by the AFM image in Fig. S2,† demonstrating a thickness of 30–40 nm), further verifying the ultrathin nature of the CZTS plates. The HR-TEM image shows a crystallographic plane clearly. The plane represents one set of d-spacing, namely 0.31 nm, which corresponds to the (112) planes of kesterite-structure CZTS. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the tetragonal-structure CZTS plates displays several diffraction dots, demonstrating that they are single crystal with great crystallinity. The presence of the major diffraction dots (112) and (220) is in good agreement with those reported in the literature.22,28 No apparent additional sulfide phases are observed and the pure phase of the CZTS film is further confirmed.
To verify the universality and efficiency of the novel solvothermal treatment in synthesizing different nanostructures and multi-metal sulfides, we extended the method to CZTS nanodisk array fabrication, by choosing sodium thiosulfate as the starting sulfur source. In the first step, the CZT precursor film was similarly electrodeposited on the FTO glass substrate, with the morphology of nanoparticles. During the solvothermal treatment, the CZT composite changes to the CZTS phase and nanodisk architecture is well formed (as shown in Fig. S3†). The as-prepared CZTS sheet surfaces are rough, with abundant nanoparticles covering on it. The thickness and diameter of the CZTS nanodisk are ca. 30–70 nm and ca. 300–500 nm, respectively. Raman spectra confirm the conversion from the CZT precursor to CZTS. The TEM result indicates that the obtained nanodisk CZTS exhibits a single crystal structure, with the diffraction dots appearing in Fig. S3(c).† The measured lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.312 nm in the HR-TEM image corresponds to the (112) plane of the kesterite-structure CZTS phase. Furthermore, we also obtained Cu4SnS6 sheet arrays when the Cu–Sn alloy composite was firstly electrodeposited on the FTO glass substrate and sulphur served as the sulfur source. The thickness and width of the Cu4SnS6 sheet are ca. 20–40 nm and ca. 350–580 nm, respectively (as demonstrated in Fig. S4†). The EDS spectra and XRD data confirm the Cu4SnS6 formation. Thus, the above demonstrations serve as a strong testament that this green solvothermal treatment is powerful and versatile for constructing high-quality metal sulfide nanoarrays on arbitrary conductive substrates under mild conditions (i.e. low temperature, no annealing, environment, speediness).
Reaction mechanism
The growth mechanism of the 2D leaf-like CZTS PLAr based on solvothermal treatment is proposed as follows (also shown schematically in Fig. 5(a)). The morphology evolution of CZTS during the solvothermal process is examined by FE-SEM characterization. From Fig. 5(a) and (b), the porous and rough precursor CZT film before the solvothermal treatment is composed of homogeneous particles, with the diameter of 50–65 nm. Interestingly, in the first conversion process for 1 h, many irregular nanoplates appear, however with abundant particles remaining. Most likely, it is due to the “oriented attachment” and “self-assembly” processes29–31 which involve a spontaneous self-organization of adjacent particles so that they share a common crystallographic orientation, followed by joining of these particles at a planar interface. The processes are particularly relevant in the nanocrystalline regime, where bonding between the adjacent particles reduces the overall energy by removing the surface energy associated with unsatisfied bonds.29,32,33 Furthermore, during the solvothermal process, sulfur powder dissolves in a trace amount of water to form H2S and is also further decomposed to S2− species, namely disproportionation.34,35 The released species can serve as the sulfur sources in solvothermal treatment to convert the CZT precursor to the CZTS phase. In addition, the surface of the rough CZT film has many small grain boundaries and ethanol and the above sulfur species can easily permeate into the film to react with the CZT compound to form sulfide at a low temperature and high pressure. As shown in Fig. 6, Cu2S, ZnS, SnS2, Cu–Zn–Sn, and CZTS composite phases are initially formed in the shape of a nanoplate and nanoparticle, acting as the starting crystal nucleus of CZTS plate arrays. It is proposed that the formation of CZTS nanoplates involves nucleation and growth, as described in previous reports.36 With the reaction proceeding to 3 h, the binary/ternary sulfides continue to react with each other and the sulfur species to form the kesterite-structure Cu2ZnSnS4 phase and there are not any impurity phases left, as observed in Fig. 6. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S5,† the dark-field TEM imaging clearly shows that a growing CZTS plate is composed of abundant tiny nanocrystals. The adjacent nanocrystals share a similar growth orientation ([221] direction), and then combine with each other to form a whole single-crystal plate with reaction time extension. For the CZTS 3 h sample, the width of each plate increases from ca. ∼300 nm to ca. ∼600 nm and the surface becomes rougher. The mosaic and rough pointed cone on the surface of the plate can provide high-energy sites for crystal growth (seeing in Fig. S5(b)†). It is energetically more favorable for the crystalline CZTS plates to grow, where they evolve from small nanoplates to well-defined interconnected bigger CZTS plates with sawtooth-structured protuberances (namely the Ostwald ripening process). When the reaction time is 6 h, it is noteworthy that the CZTS plate becomes thinner, with the smooth edge of the plate curling up and becoming cambered. It is hypothesized that the redundant S2− ions or H2S species absorb on the surface or active site of the CZTS plate, and then the above active species react with the surface layer and boundary of the CZTS further, so as to minimize the surface energy and acquire better crystals (as proved in Fig. 6). Thus, the leaf-like CZTS PLArs with a high specific surface area and super crystallinity are preferred to be obtained.

Performance of DSSCs and electrochemical properties of leaf-like CZTS PLAr CEs
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs using CEs based on conventional Pt, and different CZTS thin films were obtained under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1 and each value for cell performance is determined as an average of at least three devices. It is indicated that the DSSCs with leaf-like CZTS 6 h PLAr CEs possess a much better cell performance than others, especially for the JSC. The significantly enhanced JSC values indicate that the rate of hole recovery at the CZTS 6 h PLAr electrode–electrolyte interface is more rapid than that at the other CEs.9,37 A 7.09% efficiency is successfully achieved with the leaf-like CZTS 6 h PLAr CE, which is about 18% times higher than that of Pt CE-based DSSCs (η = 6.01%). As a high-efficiency catalyst for the reduction of I3−, CZTS 6 h PLAr CEs demonstrate great potential application in DSSCs. The higher JSC and FF of the CZTS 6 h CE are due to the considerable improvement in charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface, which reduces the internal resistances, the concentration gradients in the electrolyte, and the recombination rates.38,39 Furthermore, a reflective mirror was used to improve the visible light utilization rate of the CZTS 6 h CE to achieve high transmittance, as shown in Fig. 7. Surprisingly, the JSC increases from 16.32 to 21.78 mA cm−2, when reflecting the light penetrating through the solar cell, and the PCE increases from 7.09% to 8.67% accordingly. The superior catalytic ability of leaf-like CZTS PLArs in DSSCs could be caused by the following reason: first, plate-based catalytic arrays not only increase the catalytic surface area of electrode films but also accelerate the photo-generated electron transport at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface;16,40 second, according to the quantum chemistry predictions, the (202) surface of metal sulfide has overpotential behavior in O2 reduction similar to that observed for platinum electrodes, indicating that the special surface structure of metal sulfide benefits the reduction of I3− ions.41 However, the PCE of the CZTS 1 h device (5.10%) was lower than that of the Pt counter electrode. This could be due to the presence of the secondary phase like Cu2SnS3, ZnS, SnS2 and Cu2S phases (observed in Raman spectra), which have been shown to have poor catalytic activity in the iodine/iodide electrolyte and served as electron recommendation sites.22,42

The observed cell performance enhancement is further investigated by evaluating the electrocatalytic activity of the CZTS and Pt electrodes and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel-polarization measurements were performed in the triiodide electrolyte. Fig. 8(a) shows that the leaf-like CZTS PLAr CE has excellent electrochemical stability in I−/I3− solutions. Two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks are observed in CV curves for all samples. The redox peaks at more negative potentials, represented by peak I and peak I′, correspond to the reaction of eqn (1), and the redox peaks at more positive potentials, represented by peak II and peak II′′, correspond to eqn (2):16,43,44 I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)

As the counter electrode of DSSCs is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−, the characteristics of peak I and peak I′ are the focus of our analysis. The cathodic peak current (IP) at more negative potential and the peak-to-peak separation (ΔEP), which is negatively correlated with the standard electrochemical rate constant of the redox reaction, are two critical parameters for comparing electrocatalytic activities of different CEs.44 Compared to the Pt electrode, though the value of ΔEP (0.72 V) for CZTS 6 h is nearly comparable to that of the Pt (0.71 V), the peak position of the reduction reaction is shifted from −0.49 to −0.55 V. The shift of the reduction peaks toward the negative potentials indicates that the oxidized iodide species, which are formed by scavenging the photoexcited holes of the dye, are easily reduced and regenerated on the counter electrode coated with the heterostructured nanostructure.44 The higher IP of CZTS 6 h at peak I indicates that the leaf-like CZTS PLAr CE produces remarkable catalytic activity for I3− reduction, even better than Pt, which is advantageous for the application of the CZTS material as an efficient CE in DSSCs. Furthermore, the catalytic reaction is a kinetic process, which is related to the electron transfer rate constant and the number of active sites. Peak I′ is wider for the leaf-like CZTS PLAr electrode than that for Pt, which indicates that the 2D CZTS PLAr structure has provided more catalytic reaction sites than the Pt CE.9 Thus, the 2D leaf-like CZTS PLAr CE has superior catalytic activity properties compared to Pt. The conclusion from the CV data is consistent with previous energy conversion efficiency results.
To further elucidate the catalytic activity of the CZTS CEs in the reduction of I3− ions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the symmetrical CZTS and Pt electrochemical cells, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Generally, the high frequency intercepts on the real axis represent the series resistance (RS), which is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of CE materials, resistance of FTO glass substrates, contact resistance, etc. The high frequency semicircle indicates that the electrochemical charge transfer resistance (RCt) is parallel with the corresponding double-layer capacitance (Cμ) at the interface of CE/electrolyte for I3− reduction. The detailed EIS parameters are listed in Table 2. The RS values of the CZTS 1 h, CZTS 3 h and CZTS 6 h CEs are 5.98, 5.05, and 4.98 Ω cm−2, respectively, which are comparable to that of the Pt electrode (4.67 Ω cm−2). The small value of CZTS CEs reflects a good bonding strength between in situ CZTS films and FTO substrates, which in turn promotes the transfer of more electrons from the external circuit or of holes from the electrolyte to the CEs.45 The RS greatly affects the FF and JSC of the solar cell, with higher FF and JSC resulting from the smaller RS value, which is consistent with the result of photovoltaic performance.45 The CZTS 6 h electrode exhibits the smallest RCt value of 5.29 Ω cm−2, indicating an acceleration of high electron transfer at the interface of CE/electrolyte and high catalytic activity, thus leading to higher JSC and FF.8,46,47 The small value of RCt is due to the high contact surface area and fast electron-transfer pathway of CZTS PLArs.47 Furthermore, a higher Cμ value (17.24 μF) represents a larger surface area of the CZTS 6 h, which agrees well with the results obtained from the FE-SEM and AFM analyses.45,48 Accordingly, the leaf-like CZTS PLAr CE shows higher active catalytic properties than Pt for the reduction of I3−, which agrees well with the CV results. For the CZTS 3 h CE, the corresponding RCt value is 6.64 Ω cm−2, which is comparable to that of the Pt CE. However, it can be observed that the RCt value (13.17 Ω cm−2) for the CZTS 1h is larger than 7.17 Ω cm−2, indicating the poor electrocatalytic activity as evidenced by the J–V characteristics of DSSCs.

In addition, Tafel polarization measurements were also carried out with the same symmetrical cells in the above EIS test to further investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the CZTS 6 h and Pt CEs. It is a measurement of logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of applied potential. The Tafel plot consists of three zones: the first one is the polarization zone at the lower potential (−V), the second one is the Tafel zone at the middle with a steep slope, which is the fingerprint of catalytic ability of the CE, and the third one is due to the diffusion region at the higher voltage (V).49,50 The exchange current density (J0) of samples can be evaluated as the intercept of the extrapolated linear region of anodic and cathodic branches when the voltage is zero. It can be seen in Fig. 8(c) that the CE with CZTS 6 h shows the higher J0 than Pt, suggesting the better electrocatalytic activity, in good agreement with the tendency of the cathodic peak current observed in Fig. 8(a).9 The J0 value is directly related to the charge transfer resistance (RCt) and is given by the following eqn (3): J0 = RT/nFRCt(3)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in K, n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and RCt is the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface obtained from EIS spectra.51–54 Therefore, the J0 value is proportional to the RCt value. The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) can also be derived from the Tafel curve at high potential. Jlim is closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalyst.9,45,55 The Jlim value of the leaf-like CZTS PLAr electrode (−2.07 mA cm−2) is higher than that of the Pt electrode (−2.24 mA cm−2), which induces a higher diffusion coefficient, as shown in eqn (4).10,52Jlim depends on the diffusion coefficient of the redox couple in the electrolyte. This Tafel polarization result is consistent with the EIS and CV results. D = lJlim/2nFC(4)where D is the diffusion coefficient of the I3−, l is the electrolyte thickness, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the counter electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the iodic concentration.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a green, effective and powerful two-step method based on novel solvothermal treatment to synthesize semi-transparent 2D leaf-like CZTS PLArs in situ on a FTO glass substrate. The electrodeposited CZT precursor film was completely converted to leaf-like CZTS PLArs after a solvothermal treatment in the period of 6 h. The corresponding SAED pattern of the tetragonal-structure CZTS plate demonstrated its single crystals with great crystallinity. The growth mechanism is related to the “oriented attachment” and “self-assembly” processes. The dissolved S2− ions and hydrolyzed H2S species serve as the sulfur sources in solvothermal treatment to convert the CZT precursor to CZTS. Remarkably, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.09% was obtained by utilizing leaf-like CZTS PLAr as the CE for DSSCs, which was higher than that of Pt (6.01%). Surprisingly, PCE increased to 8.67% under the assistance of a mirror. The excellent performance of DSSCs could be attributed to the high catalytic surface area, fast photo-generated electron transport at the counter electrode/redox electrolyte interface, remarkable electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction, low charge transfer resistance toward the reduction of I3− ions, and high diffusion coefficient of the I3−. This work provides a green and feasible approach to construct high-quality metal sulfide nanoarrays on arbitrary substrates under mild conditions (i.e. low temperature, no annealing, environment, speediness) and promotes the development of sulfide materials for solar cells, photo/electro-catalysis, and electrochemical energy storage applications.
