    , Accepted 18th December 2017First published on 27th December 2017AbstractLately, transition-metal catalysed C–H alkenylation of nitrogen heterocycles has gained increasing attention, often with the intervention of complex and expensive catalytic systems. On the other hand, both, chalcones and indolizines are versatile families of compounds with applications in diverse research areas, including materials science, because of their prominent photophysical attributes. We set forth herein the metal-free regio- and diastereoselective C–H alkenylation of indolizines through a very simple and mild acid–base approach. The most fascinating fact in this remote-site Csp2–Csp2 bond formation is that only one starting material is utilised, which undergoes a formal self-alkenylation to integrate a chalcone moiety and furnish a new family of dyes; a plausible reaction mechanism has been put forward. A one-pot multicomponent protocol was conceived that generates the starting indolizine in situ and has been extended to a multi-gram scale synthesis with equal efficiency. The dyes show a single structure in the solid state but two stable structures in solution (rotamers). Preliminary studies on the optical properties of the dyes reveal a particle-size dependent colour in the solid state and solvatochromism (i.e., different colours in solution depending on the solvent polarity). Remarkably, the solvatochromic behaviour was also displayed in plastics. We believe that this finding opens new avenues in the fields of heterocyclic chemistry, dyes, and materials science.
Introduction
There is a general upsurge of interest in developing more efficient and sustainable processes for the alkenylation of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds based on C–H activation. Among them, the transition-metal free cross-coupling of aryl halides with alkenes is praiseworthy but requires the action of strong bases that curtail the substrate scope of the method.1 The cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of arenes and alkenes (oxidative Heck-type or Fujiwara–Moritani reaction) represents a much more advantageous and resourceful strategy because it skips pre-installation of the halide on the aromatic unit and produces hydrogen as the only byproduct (i.e., high atom economy).2 At any rate, the presence of a noble transition metal is mandatory, normally accompanied by a stoichiometric amount of an oxidant under thermal treatment; ruthenium,3 rhodium4 and, especially, palladium5 catalysts dominate over other metals in this field. Control of both the regio- and stereoselectivity are major issues in this type of reaction; the former is commonly addressed by the introduction of a directing group (e.g., ortho alkenylation) or by activation of HetCsp2–H bonds (e.g., NCsp2–H bonds). Remote site-selective Csp2–H olefination is, yet, a much more challenging and hot topic.6
In recent years, a great deal of attention has been devoted to selective alkenylation of nitrogen heterocycles making use of the power of the CDC tool;7 this additional introduction of functionality can be ultimately used for further synthetic purposes or to enhance the inherent biological activity of the compounds. Pyridines,8 indole derivatives,9 uracils,10 imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines,11 and indolizines12 are some of the substrates successfully subjected to this reaction (Scheme 1). However, the corresponding methods implemented are far from being green and sustainable, and are conditional on close site-selective C–H activation. Furthermore, it seems rather unviable to scale up the procedures from the economic (expensive catalysts), safety (high temperatures in O2 atmosphere), and environmental points of view (use of non-recommended solvents13). Therefore, there is a justification to explore new routes towards heterocycle alkenylation. Moreover, the alkenylation of aromatics by C–H activation also elongates the π system, producing conjugated organic materials with potential exploitation of their photophysical characteristics (e.g., as organic electronic materials).14

In relation with the latter topic, organic dyes with a D–π-A configuration contain both electron-donating (D) and electron-withdrawing groups (A) connected by a π-conjugated section; alternatively, a D–A–π-A configuration can be molecularly designed where the additional intercalated A is a heterocyclic component (Fig. 1). The particular light absorption of these compounds makes them ideal candidates for chemosensors15 and dye-sensitised solar cells.16 Construction of the alkenyl linker usually relies on a Wittig reaction, for which a proper functionalisation of the starting materials is required.

On the other hand, such different types of compounds as indolizines17 and chalcones18 have manifold pharmacological activities in common, namely: antioxidant, anti-tubercular, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, or analgesic activities. Among them, the outstanding antibacterial activity of some heterocyclic chalcones is worth mentioning.19 Moreover, both the indolizine20 and pyridinyl chalcone18a,21 systems are very useful scaffolds in synthetic organic chemistry as well as in materials science. In the latter respect, indolizine dyes have found practical applications as materials in laser-based recording and reading devices,22 thermography and photothermography,22a electrochromic devices,23 and optical filters,24 as well as photoelectric converters.25 Companies of international renown have shown considerable concern for this type of materials.22,24,25 Within the most recent literature, several articles covering the photophysical behaviour (e.g., halochromism, fluorescence, etc.) of indolizine26 and heterocyclic chalcone dyes27 have been reported (Fig. 2). It is worth noting that the more specific 2-pyridinyl chalcones27b–f can additionally behave as probes for sensing of metal ions by coordination through the 2-pyridinylcarbonyl fragment.

As part of our dedication to study the application of supported copper nanoparticles for multicomponent reactions,28 we reported the three-component synthesis of indolizines from pyridine-2-carbaldehyde derivatives, secondary amines, and terminal alkynes catalysed by copper nanoparticles on activated carbon (CuNPs/C) in dichloromethane (Scheme 2).29 Interestingly, heterocyclic chalcones were obtained from the same starting materials in the absence of solvent. Despite the easiness to prepare 1-amino-3-substituted indolizines, the reactivity of this class of heterocyclic compounds remains unexplored. Only very recently, we demonstrated that this type of indolizines could be transformed into indolizidines though a highly chemo- and diastereoselective catalytic hydrogenation.30
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of indolizines and heterocyclic chalcones. 
Considering the aforementioned features of indolizines and heterocyclic chalcones and concluding this introduction, we can say that it is timely to elaborate new structures and synthetic pathways for these kind of compounds. Particularly interesting is the possibility of assembling indolizine and chalcone moieties in the same molecule through highly effective and simple alkenylation methods. We present herein the discovery of a new family of dyes with a D–A–π-A configuration and a crossed indolizine-chalcone motif, which were obtained by simple acid–base treatment of the parent indolizines (Scheme 3);31 the reaction mechanism, a structural interpretation of the dyes in the solid state and in solution, as well as some of their optical properties are also tackled.

Results and discussion
The starting indolizines 1 were synthesized by the three-component reaction of pyridine-2-carbaldehyde derivatives, secondary amines, and terminal alkynes catalysed by CuNPs/C.29 Their response to acidic medium is first presented.
Optimisation of the reaction conditions
Indolizine 1a, derived from pyridine-2-carbaldehyde, dibenzylamine, and phenylacetylene, was deployed as the model compound in order to settle on the optimum reaction conditions. A range of acids was tested at room temperature, followed by neutralisation with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (Table 1); mineral acids or strong organic acids did not produce 2a (Table 1, entries 1–3, 7, and 8). Better performance was observed for the propionic and acetic carboxylic acids; the highest conversion was attained using acetic acid either at room temperature or at 50 °C (Table 1, entries 5 and 10), whereas dilution of acetic acid or higher temperature had a deleterious effect on the yield (Table 1, entries 9 and 11). Careful monitoring of the standard reaction with HOAc at ambient temperature resulted in a quantitative conversion of 1a after 6 h and an isolated yield of about 70% of 2a (Table 1, entry 12).

Substrate scope
In view of the above optimisation, the outreach of this transformation was studied using a minimum time of treatment with HOAc of 6 h. We first studied the effect of the substitution on the 3-aryl group for a series of 1-dibenzylamino indolizine derivatives (Table 2). The presence of electron-donating groups at the para position (1b and 1c) was found to be somewhat beneficial with respect to the unsubstituted counterpart (1a), with the corresponding dyes (2b and 2c) being obtained in good isolated yields. The opposite effect was noted for the existence of para electron-withdrawing groups, with yields around 50% for 2d and 2e. Substitution of the 3-aryl into a 3-alkyl substituent in 1 exerted a certain detrimental effect (compare 2f with 2a). Next, we explored the influence of the amino substituents; the yield also decreased when replacing a benzyl with a methyl group (compare 2g with 2a). The yield shrinkage was more pronounced in the case of N-methyl-N-phenethyl- (2h), N-piperidinyl- (2i), or N,N-dibutylamino- (2j) substituents; the reaction was especially slow in the two latter cases. Dyes bearing an N-methyl-N-phenyl moiety could be also synthesized, either containing the normal indolizine/pyridinyl (2k) in good yield, or the 5-methylindolizine/6-methylpyridinyl (2l) nuclei in very modest yield. Happily, the yield was boosted above 70% when two strong electron-donating groups (i.e., 4-methoxyphenyl) were bonded to nitrogen (2m). This method was proven to be effectual for the construction of chiral dyes, such as in the case of the (R)-N-benzyl-N-(α-methyl)benzylamino derivative 2n. It can be concluded that existence of the 1-dibenzylamino and 3-aryl groups are, in general, essential to obtain good yields. Unfortunately, attempts to obtain the cross-alkenylated products from two different indolizines (1a with 1b, 1c and 1d) were unfruitful due to the lack of selectivity.

In order to upgrade the effectiveness of the process, a three-component one-pot protocol was developed from pyridine-2-carbaldehyde, dibenzylamine, and phenylacetylene, without need to isolate the intermediate indolizine 1a (Scheme 4). It was gratifying to see that the reaction outcome was very similar to that of the pre-formed indolizine.
 Scheme 4  One-pot synthesis of the dye 2a at 0.5 and 187 mmol scale from commercial starting materials. 
Scale up is a hurdle generally encountered in organic synthesis, more markedly in multi-step procedures and in catalysis, which often curtails the transfer of laboratory basic research into the productive sector. In this vein, we strove to adapt the preceding one-pot method to a multi-gram scale (see the ESI‡ for full details). For this purpose, several parameters were readjusted: (a) 0.5 mol% CuNPs/C was exchanged for 5 mol% CuI, with the latter being commercially available and readily accessible for anyone interested in manufacturing this type of dye; (b) the reaction was made greener by removing CH2Cl2 and working under solvent-free conditions; (c) the neutralisation step was executed with NaOH solution instead of sat. NaHCO3 to avoid excessive bubbling; and (d) the purification of the dye was accomplished by recrystallisation in lieu of column chromatography, with the former being always preferred by the chemical industry. We must underline that the use of CuNPs/C is advantageous because it enables an adequate metal separation from the reaction medium by filtration; in contrast, with CuI, washing with ammonia solution is suggested during the work-up for copper removal. Nevertheless, in this manner, 187 mmol (20 g) of pyridine-2-carbaldehyde were converted to 40 g of the pure dye 2a (Scheme 4). The yield achieved (72%) is concordant with that of the small-scale synthesis and denotes a highly reproducible and robust method.
Structural analysis
From the structural viewpoint, we were delighted to discover that the resulting trisubstituted indolizine dyes 2 maintained the original structure of the starting material 1, but had grown up through the 7-position of the indolizine nucleus by the incorporation of a heterocyclic chalcone fragment from another indolizine molecule. In this sense, the dyes 2 can be considered as indolizine-chalcone hybrids selectively bonded through a Csp2–Csp2 bond. Certainly, this is a very singular Csp2–Csp2 bond formation with the following salient features: (a) the conversion of 1 into 2 can be formally considered as a remote-site C–H self-alkenylation reaction; (b) transition-metal catalysis is dispensable; (c) contrary to published alkenylation strategies which result in (quaternary)Csp2–(tertiary)Csp2 bond formation, the more challenging (quaternary)Csp2–(quaternary)Csp2 bonds are made now (i.e., with a 1,1-disubstituted alkenyl fragment); (d) it is worthwhile mentioning the extraordinary selectivity achieved in this reaction, with the dyes 2 being obtained with absolute control of both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity. Thus, out of the ten potential isomers which can be drawn as products (five possible regioisomers at the indolizine positions 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8, each as two possible Z/E diastereoisomers), only one was formed, the 7-substituted E isomer.
The structure of the dyes 2 was unequivocally established by X-ray crystallography of 2a and 2c (Fig. 3).32 The X-ray plot of 2a brings into view a quasi-flat arrangement of the chalcone-indolizine backbone. Conversely, the phenyl group at the β-position of the CO (C15–C16) lays nearly perpendicular to that backbone (C17–C16–C15–C22 torsion angle = 80°) in order to reduce the steric interaction of the ortho Hs with the CO and the C5–H. The phenyl ring on the indolizine heterocycle also appears deviated from co-planarity (C2–C1–C9–C14 torsion angle = 31°) to prevent C2–H/C14–H and C8–H/C10–H interactions. Finally, the carbonyl group and the C–N of the pyridinyl group are exposed to view in an anti-periplanar conformation (O1–C23–C24–N2) to minimise dipole–dipole interactions. The structural X-ray patterns displayed by the dyes 2a and 2c were alike.
 Fig. 3  Plot showing the X-ray structure and atom numbering of the dyes 2a and 2c. 
Surprisingly, the response of the dyes in solution was very different from that in the solid state; duplicity of some NMR signals was observed for all compounds 2 except 2f. For instance, compound 2a exhibited a ca. 1:5 signal ratio in 1H NMR (CDCl3) which was constant irrespective of the reaction conditions or purification method (chromatography or recrystallisation). Apparently, compounds 2 exist as a mixture of two distinguishable rotamers in solution (Fig. 4); the fact that the above ratio varies with the NMR solvent used would bolster this hypothesis (Table 3). In general, the major rotamer seems to be favoured in the more polar solvents (Table 3, compare entry 2 with 5, 7, and 8); this fact entails important consequences in the optical performance of the dyes (see below). The trend to signal coalescence and to equal the population species, noticed by heating, is also typical of rotamers (Table 3, entries 5 and 6).33

The coexistence of the two rotamers could be ascribed to the circumstance that compounds 2 are push–pull highly conjugated systems, possessing the electron-releasing and -withdrawing amino and acyl groups, respectively. Therefore, resonant forms with a partial double bond connecting the chalcone and indolizine core could be drawn (Scheme 5a). The restricted rotation around that bond would lead to two highly conjugated and conformationally stable η-enamino ketones. NOESY experiments are in agreement with the rotamer A being the major one which, in turn, coincides with the structure of 2a in the solid state (Scheme 5b). The conformation suggested for rotamer B is more dubious, albeit it is evident that Hd′ and Hk′ are far each other now (Scheme 5b). In fact, these two protons experienced the most pronounced variation in the chemical shift (ca. 0.40 and 0.55 ppm, respectively) with a displacement to a higher field (Fig. 4). Due to the relative spatial proximity of the β-phenyl and Hk′, the former might exert a shielding impact on the latter by polarisation and field effects.34 The calculated dipolar moments35 for the rotamer A (3.17 D) and rotamer B (1.32 D) marry up with their abundance as a function of the solvent polarity; i.e., the rotamer A prevails in polar solvents. We managed to get a 1H NMR spectrum of the pure rotamer A by dissolving the solid 2a in CDCl3 just before running the NMR experiment (Fig. S1‡). In situ1H NMR analysis of this sample at room temperature disclosed that complete rotamer equilibration was attained after ca. 2 h (Fig. 5 and S2‡).

Rotamers were also observed for dyes of the 3-aryl-1-dibenzylamino series (Table 4, entries 1–5 and 14); the presence of electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of the phenyl group displaced the equilibrium towards the rotamer A (Table 4, entries 4 and 5) and vice versa (Table 4, entry 3). A quite homogeneous A/B ratio was measured for the N-alkylated (non-benzylic) dyes 2g–2j (Table 4, entries 7–10). The most pronounced effect in favour of the minor rotamer B was noted for the N-phenyl substituted dyes 2k and 2l (Table 4, entries 11 and 12), probably due to electron delocalisation of the N lone pair though the phenyl ring. This effect was of less magnitude in dye 2m because the p-OMe groups work in the opposite direction (Table 4, entry 13). Startlingly, dye 2f, bearing two alkyl chains in the chalcone-indolizine skeleton, was held up to view as a single set of NMR signals in solution; the broad signals plotted might be linked to the existence of unresolved rotamers during the time-scale of the NMR experiment at room temperature. The larger conformational freedom of the butyl group, compared to that of the phenyl group, could account for this abnormality. As a general tendency, all the δB data were at higher field than the δA counterparts (Table 4).

Mechanistic studies
The dyes 2 are trisubstituted indolizines which keep the original structure of the starting indolizine 1 and have solely reacted through the 7-position. The reactivity at this position might be supported, in part, by the deuteration studies by Engewald et al. to determine the exchange rate of the indolizine hydrogens in D2O/dioxane at 50 °C (ref. 36a) and in 0.02 M D2SO4/dioxane at 200 °C.36b These studies established the following relative order of reactivity of the positions of the indolizine nucleus against electrophiles: 3 > 1 > > 2 > 7 ∼ 5 > 6 > 8. In our case, the positions 1 and 3 are already substituted and the position 2 is more sterically encumbered than the position 7. Nevertheless, the amino group at position 1 seems to play a paramount role in this selectivity (see below).
When the transformation of 1a into 2a was carried out following the standard procedure, but in CD3CO2D instead of CH3CO2H, no incorporation of D was observed in 2a; this result supports the activating character of acetic acid and rules out any structural role. In situ NMR analysis of the reaction of 1a with CD3CO2D in CDCl3 brought forth a major depletion of the signal intensity for the indolizine hydrogen atoms (e.g., NC5–H, ca. 8.2 ppm) and the benzylic methylene groups (NCH2, ca. 4.2 ppm) (Fig. 6 and S3‡). This outcome could indicate a first deuteration/protonation stage involving the nitrogen atoms. However, signals corresponding to the dye 2a were not present in the spectra. We observed that some dye 2a was formed after prolonged exposure of indolizine 1a to HOAc but the reaction was much slower compared to that subjected to posterior neutralisation with sat. NaHCO3, evidencing the necessity of water and/or base for the onward progress of the reaction.
 Fig. 6  
In situ
1H RMN analysis of 1a with 20 equiv. of CD3CO2D in CDCl3. 
On the basis of the above results, the following reaction mechanism was put forward and exemplified for the substrate 1a (Scheme 6): two molecules of the indolizine 1a are involved in the process, one acting as an electrophile (after proper activation) and the other one as a nucleophile. On one hand, it is our belief that 1a possesses an enamine character and, therefore, it might experience protonation prior to hydrolysis giving the corresponding ketone, with the concomitant loss of dibenzylamine (detected in the reaction crude by GC/MS and 1H NMR). On the other hand, another molecule of 1a would act as a nucleophile through the dienamine subunit,37 exclusively reacting at its less hindered γ position (7 position of the indolizine bicycle), by conjugate addition to an intermediate of the type 3a. Ring opening by C–N bond cleavage in 4a would furnish 5a which would, eventually, undergo re-aromatisation of the indolizine core and oxidation of the dihydropyridine ring, giving rise to the dye 2a.
 Scheme 6  Reaction mechanism proposed for the synthesis of the dye 2a. 
We obtained some evidence on the formation of an intermediate of the type 3a by reacting indolizine 1a with acetic acid, followed by acid evaporation (in air). IR analysis of a sample (Fig. S4‡) exposed to view the absence of acetic acid [typical bands at 3500–2500 cm−1 (O–H); 1758 and 1714 cm−1 (CO)] but the presence of a peak at 1709 cm−1, typical of a five-membered α,β-unsaturated ketone [cyclopent-2-enone, 1707 cm−1 (CO)]. The stretching frequency of the N–H bond in trisubstituted ammonium salts is manifested in the form of a medium-intensity wide band of pronounced structure, with the maximum interval being located at 2700–2250 cm−1. We observed that type of shape in the spectrum of the sample but it is less conclusive because of its low intensity. Unfortunately, dissolution of this sample for NMR analysis mainly gave 2a [1662 cm−1 (CO)].
The amino group can be considered as both a leaving (enamine hydrolysis) and a nucleophilic group (dienamine), contributing largely to the optical and structural properties of 2 in solution. The relatively good isolated yields recorded for a process which implies the reaction of a nucleophile and an in situ generated electrophile is noteworthy, as both are derived from the same molecule. On the other hand, this process entails a change in the intrinsic electronic properties of the indolizine heterocycle because the original pyridine ring (π-deficient) acts now as a nucleophile and the pyrrole (π-exceeding) ring has been transformed into an electrophile.
Optical properties
The heterocyclic chalcone moiety, selectively grafted to the 7-position of the indolizines 2, notably enlarges the π-conjugation system of the indolizine nucleus generating a new chromophoric assembly which confers dye attributes to them. For instance, compound 2a in the solid state exhibits a nice reddish orange colour that resembles that of Congo Red (Fig. 7a). In acetonitrile solution (2.0 × 10−3 M), however, the pale yellow colour of the starting indolizine 1a (λmax = 340 nm) changes into reddish purple for the corresponding dye 2a (λmax = 493 nm), a colour similar to that of a young red wine (rich in anthocyanins) (Fig. 7b and S8‡).

Analysis of the colour of other dyes (Fig. S10 and S11‡) could be nicely rationalised as a function of the substitution pattern. The following remarks could be made taking dye 2a as a reference compound with λmax = 493 nm: (a) the influence of the p-substituent in the 3-aryl-1-dibenzylamino series of dyes is scanty, with a slight bathochromic effect for those with electron-donating substituents (Table 5, compare entries 1, 4, and 5 with 2 and 3); (b) the contribution to colour of the aryl units at the β-position of the carbonyl group and 3-position of the indolizine seems to be negligible (Table 5, compare entries 6 and 14); (c) the bathochromic shift for dyes with a 1-alkylamino (non-benzylic) group is noticeable (Table 5, entries 7–10); (d) on the contrary, the 1-arylamino group leads to a hypsochromic shift with the highest ε (Table 5, entries 11 and 12); (e) the highest λmax was recorded for the N,N-di-(4-methoxyphenyl)amino derivative 2m (Table 5, entry 13). In summary, the chalcone-indolizine framework seems to be the chromophoric component of the dyes, whereas the amino groups are auxochromic components that modulate the colour according to the electronic character of their substituents.

A significant singularity of the dyes 2 is that their colour in the solid state varies with their particle size.38 We briefly evaluated the influence of the particle size on the colour of 2a by spectrophotometry and SEM (Fig. S5–S7‡). A relatively wide maximum absorbance range of 420–520 nm was recorded for a sample of crystalline 2a. For a mortar-ground sample, a variation from reddish orange to almost black was observed (Fig. 7c); this result is consonant with the decrease in the particle size observed by SEM and the near constant absorption in all the visible spectrum.
Another remarkable attribute to be highlighted is that the dyes 2 are solvatochromic, that is, they bring into view a different colour in solution depending on the solvent utilised;39 different sheds of pink, violet, and orange have been observed for 2a (Table 6, Fig. 7d and S9‡). A correlation between the rotamer population, solvent polarity, and visible absorbance can be established; the proportion of the rotamer A generally increases with the solvent polarity while the wavelength decreases (CHCl3, ε = 4.81, A/B = 5.40:1, λmax = 526 nm; EtOH, ε = 25.30, A/B = 6.00:1, λmax = 519 nm; MeCN, ε = 36.64, A/B = 12.00:1, λmax = 493 nm). This hypsochromic (blue) shift of λmax while increasing the solvent polarity is a clear case of negative solvatochromism. A video of the in situ colour change of 2a by solvent polarity modification is available (see the ESI‡).

In spite of the fact that research on functional dyes is a very active research field, its application as a practical technology is often hampered because of synthetic reasons: (a) the expensive materials and catalysts required; (b) the multi-step sequences that decrease efficiency of the process increasing the waste; (c) the non-green conditions and reaction media used; (d) the experimental procedures are implemented at a laboratory scale but are troublesome when scaled up. We took advantage of the optical characteristics of dyes 2 to analyse their colouration power when injected into plastics. A preliminary examination revealed that migration of the dye 2a occurred in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polyamides but high compatibility was found with polyolefins [e.g., polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS)]. Three plates were prepared (Fig. 7e): two with 2a and HIPS (high-impact polystyrene SB), with or without TiO2, and a third one with 2a and PP. The first conclusion is that the dye 2a possesses a strong colouration power at a very low concentration. We were delightfully astonished to observe that the solvatochromic character of the dye was also demonstrated in plastic materials transparent to visible radiation, such as PS and PP. Indeed, three differently coloured plastic plates could be obtained with a single dye. The effect was particularly dramatic when changing the polymeric material from HIPS to PP.
Conclusions
A number of key issues were addressed in this study. Remote-site C–H alkenylation of indolizines is feasible under metal-free conditions. The most impressive peculiarity of this transmutation is that a single starting material is deployed, with the new alkenyl substituent bound to the indolizine nucleus in the product being derived from another molecule of the starting indolizine and being incorporated through a novel regio- and stereoselective Csp2–Csp2 bond formation. Given that the products keep the original structure with only the substitution of a hydrogen atom, the whole process could be described as a case of “molecular clone transplantation.” This type of reaction, in which the same compound acts as a nucleophile and electrophile with partial grafting of the latter on the former, is infrequent in organic synthesis, albeit the aldol self-condensation could be a simplistic example. These products are well-defined D–A–π-A reddish-to-deep violet dyes in the solid state which split into two rotamers in solution. An introductory study to the optical features of these dyes reveals a particle-size dependent colour, high colouration power, and solvatochromic character, also in plastic materials. Moreover, the indolizine/chalcone hybrid structures obtained by this procedure are new and their properties can make improvements to current applications of indolizine- or chalcone-based materials or may allow the discovery of new applications. This survey opens a type of reactivity up to heterocyclic chemistry which might be extended to other properly substituted heterocyclic compounds. The facts that the synthetic procedure is easy (acid–base treatment), mild (ambient temperature), can be conducted in one pot from commercial chemicals, and it is scalable to multigram scale pave the way for the future industrial utilisation of these materials.
