    , Accepted 10th July 2019First published on 11th July 2019AbstractAs the most successful end-capped unit in conventional A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) plays a significant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, an A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFA of TP28, containing the bridge unit of thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP) and the terminal unit of IC, is designed and synthesized. This is the first time that IC groups are introduced into the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs. By selecting four kinds of common electron-withdrawing units including benzothiadiazole (BT), quinoxaline (Qx), benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) and TP, we found that the steric hindrance of the A1 unit may be the key factor in controlling the condensation reaction and only the TP unit could obtain the target molecule. Although the electron-donating capability of the central fluorene unit is relatively weak, TP28 exhibits a quite narrow optical bandgap of 1.47 eV. The PBDB-T:TP28 photovoltaic devices demonstrate a moderate PCE of 5.31%, revealing great potential of such kind of NFA for highly efficient bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs.
1. Introduction
Recently, huge success has been achieved with organic solar cells (OSCs) due to the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).1–4 In comparison with fullerene acceptors, NFAs possess many merits such as a relatively simple purification method, strong light-harvesting capability, and easily tunable energy levels.5–8 From the point of view of chemical structure, symmetric NFAs exhibit promising efficiency, which can be roughly classified into two main types: A–D–A and A2–A1–D–A1–A2.9,10 In the A–D–A type, the strong electron-withdrawing 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) and its derivatives are usually adopted as the terminal groups,11–20 and the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14–15.7% have been realized by adjusting the middle D part to finetune their opto-electric properties.9,21–24 On the other hand, the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs also afford high PCEs of 10–12%25,26 with relatively high VOC of 1.1–1.2 V by choosing rhodanine (R) or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN) as the terminal electron-deficient groups.
For both A–D–A and A2–A1–D–A1–A2 backbone architecture, the terminal groups played a vital role in fine-tuning the energy level, absorption spectrum, molecular crystallinity and electron transport properties.10 An interesting phenomenon is that the widely used IC group in the A–D–A system was never used in the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 skeleton NFAs (as shown in Scheme 1). Thus, further development of novel A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs and investigation of the structure–property-performance correlations are still needed. In particular, the great diversity of chemical structures of A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs drives them to pair well with the classic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to obtain relatively higher PCEs of 4.5–7.0%27–30 compared to A–D–A type NFAs offering PCEs of 1–2%.31 In order to understand the intrinsic reason and further extend the application of the IC group, we tried to introduce the IC group as the A2 terminal group in the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 skeleton molecules, in which benzothiadiazole (BT),32,33 benzotriazole (BTA)10,28,34 quinoxaline (Qx)35 and thieno[3,4]pyrazine (TP)36 were utilized as the bridge A1 units.

We used the IC group to react with dialdehyde compounds containing BT, BTA or Qx, but these reactions cannot occur probably because of the large steric hindrance between the IC group and the bridge units based on benzene-containing electron-deficient two-membered rings. To address this issue, a simple method to decrease the steric hindrance is to replace the benzene with a thiophene ring. Due to the small steric hindrance and strong reaction activity of the TP segment, an IC-based NFA named TP28 could be successfully obtained by reacting the TP-based dialdehyde with an IC segment. TP28 is the first A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type molecule with IC as the end-capped segment, and it exhibits a narrow optical bandgap of 1.47 eV with a broad absorption band from 500 to 850 nm. A moderate PCE of 5.31% was realized by combining TP28 as the electron acceptor and PBDB-T37 as the donor polymer. The preliminary results indicate that the IC group could also be used in the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 skeleton molecules where thiophene-based electron-deficient two-membered rings, such as the TP units, need to be used as the bridge A1 units.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and characterization of TP28
The synthesis route of TP28 is outlined in Fig. 1, mainly including Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The corresponding intermediates and final TP28 are fully characterized by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF (Fig. S1, ESI†) as shown in the ESI.†TP28 shows excellent thermal stability (up to 340 °C with 5% weight loss) (Fig. S2, ESI†). TP28 is readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).

The normalized absorption spectra of TP28 in chloroform solution (∼10−5 mol L−1) and in films are shown in Fig. 2a, together with the absorption spectrum of the p-type polymer of PBDB-T in films. In thin films, TP28 exhibits strong absorption in the NIR absorption with the absorption edge at 845 nm, which is complementary to PBDB-T. TP28 exhibits a narrow optical bandgap of 1.47 eV, calculated from the absorption edge (845 nm). The extinction coefficient of TP28 in both thin films and the solution state was 3.0 × 104 cm−1 and 1.3 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1, respectively. It is worth mentioning that most NFAs possessing NIR absorption must contain complicated central units with a strong electron-donating ability,38 which generally are difficult to synthesize. However, by introducing the quinoidal structure of TP as the π bridge, TP28 can realize the NIR absorption band by just adopting the simple fluorene segment with weak electron-donating ability. From the point of view of material design, the fluorene segment could effectively decrease the material cost.

Cyclic voltammetry was employed to investigate the electrochemical properties of TP28 and PBDB-T with the film on platinum in 0.1 mol L−1 [Bu4NPF6] CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), TP28 shows reversible reduction and quasi-reversible oxidation waves, and the HOMO and LUMO levels of TP28 were calculated to be −5.51 and −4.02 eV. The energy levels of TP28 match with those of the donor polymer of PBDB-T, which has a HOMO and LUMO value of −5.20 eV and −3.52 eV respectively.
To investigate the backbone configuration of the ground state of TP28, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level by using the Gaussian 09 software and the alkyl chains on the fluorene were replaced by methyl groups for simplifying the calculation. As shown in Fig. 3, TP28 adopts a nearly planar geometry and the dihedral angle between the fluorene and TP units is calculated to be around 10°. The electron densities of HOMO are homogeneously distributed at the central fluorene and the TP unit, whereas those of LUMO are delocalized over the whole molecule, suggesting very efficient internal charge transfer (ICT) in these A2–A1–D–A1–A2 systems. To determine the optimized geometry, we calculated three isomer molecules of TP28. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the total energy for the asymmetric isomer of TP28 is less than that of symmetric analogues. In addition, the LUMO and HOMO of TP28 are calculated to be −3.65 and −5.53 eV, respectively. Additionally, the electrostatic potential (ESP) maps from DFT calculations show the negative potential at the N and O atoms (CN and CO groups in the IC unit) of TP28, and also suggest that the TP unit doesn’t possess strong withdrawing ability in the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 backbone.

2.2 Photovoltaic properties of TP28
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of PBDB-T:TP28, the device was fabricated with a traditional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The effects of donor/acceptor weight ratios, solvent additives and thermal annealing (TA) were optimized. The current density–voltage (J–V) curve and photovoltaic parameters of the TP28-based device are shown in Fig. 4 and Tables S1–S3 (ESI†), respectively. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), the photovoltaic device exhibited the maximum PCE of 5.14% without using any solvent additive. Then 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), diphenyl ether (DPE) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were tested as solvent additives to further improve the PCE of the device. After device optimization, PBDB-T:TP28 exhibited the highest PCE of 5.31% (VOC = 0.77 V, JSC = 11.6 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.59) with a weight ratio of 1:1, 1% DPE as the solvent additive in chlorobenzene, and thermal annealing at 140 °C. We believe that with the modulation of chemical structures and/or the optimization of donor polymers, the photovoltaic performance of IC-based A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs could be further improved.
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves of PBDB-T:TP28 devices; (b) EQE spectra of PBDB-T:TP28 solar cells. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement of the photovoltaic device was performed and the corresponding curves are presented in Fig. 4b. The EQE covers a broad response from 300 to 850 nm, suggesting that the absorption of both donor and acceptor materials can contribute to the photocurrent. The maximum EQE value of the device is 46% at 700 nm. The JSC calculated by the integration of the EQE spectrum using the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum is 11.4 mA cm−2, which matches with the value obtained from J–V measurements.
To investigate the active layer morphology of the PBDB-T:TP28 blend film, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the blend film of PBDB-T:TP28 showed a relatively uniform and smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 1.39 nm. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the charge carrier transport of the device was investigated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The result suggests that TP28 has a low electron mobility (2.0 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the blend films were also measured and compared with that of the neat polymer film. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), when excited at the maximum absorption peak of the donor in films (623 nm), the blend film exhibited high PL quenching, implying efficient charge transfer from PBDB-T to TP28.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we firstly introduced the IC group into the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 skeleton NFAs and obtained a new NFA TP28. The final TP28 has a symmetric A2–A1–D–A1–A2 backbone comprising fluorene as the core unit of D, TP as the bridge unit of A1 and IC as the end-capped group of A2. When BT, BTA or Qx were used as the A1 bridge units, the condensation reaction with the IC unit cannot occur probably due to the large steric hindrance, further indicating the importance of selecting TP as the bridge unit. TP28 exhibits an efficient and broad absorption from 500 to 850 nm and maintains a quite low optical bandgap of 1.47 eV. The PBDB-T:TP28 photovoltaic devices offer a moderate PCE of 5.31%. This preliminary result not only demonstrates that the IC unit can be introduced into the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 backbone architecture by choosing a suitable A1 bridge unit, but also indicates that the high-lying LUMO energy level and the low bandgap can be observed by using a weak electron-donating core. We believe such a new NFA could largely extend the application of the classic end-capped segment of IC and its derivatives.
