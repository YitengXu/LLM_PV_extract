The one-dimensional (1D) electrodes designed for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted great attention because of their high charge transport mobility.1 The insufficient surface area of 1D nanostructures is insufficient for high dye loading and light harvesting that eventually restricts the energy power conversion efficiency to relatively low levels. The yield of free charge carriers, especially electrons, is driven by the electronic configuration followed by a specific topography of the photoanode.2 Porous nanostructures of various metal oxides including TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, WO3, Nb2O5, Al2O3, etc., have widely been envisaged in DSSCs for dye attachment and carrier transport.3 Of these, nanostructures of TiO2 and ZnO have a proven record potential in DSSCs since their electronic configurations reduce the probability of electron–hole recombination, favouring efficient charge transportation dynamics. Recently, WO3 has attracted immense attention due to its relatively smaller band gap energy (2.6 eV), which would theoretically utilize ∼12% of incident solar light of the visible region and availability of abundant morphologies including nanoparticles (NPs), nanorods (NRs), nanoporous-walled nanotubes, nanowires, nanoflakes, flake-walls, nanoworms, nanobowls, nanocolumns, nanosponge, etc.4–6 In comparison to TiO2, WO3 possesses a higher mobility and has its conduction band-edge at a more positive location (∼0.5 V). Therefore, it is speculated that the open circuit voltage (Voc) in WO3 nanostructures is limited due to the lower difference between its conduction band and redox potential of electrolytes.7
Here, we report facile low-temperature hydrothermal and chemical wet methods to directly grow WO3 NRs as core and TiO2 NPs as shell to form a core–shell structure on a fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) substrate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the direct unidirectional growth of WO3 NRs on an FTO substrate was realized. Enhancement of power conversion efficiency in the presence of WO3 as a buffer-layer in TiO2-based DSSCs has been achieved on one hand,7d whereas on the other, p-type WO2 as a credible counter electrode is documented.7e Due to lower electrochemical performance caused by difference in electronic structure, rutile TiO2 has attracted less attention than anatase and brookite for use in catalysis, photocatalysis and DSSCs. However, properties like higher chemical stability, higher refractive index, cheaper production cost, etc., have made it more versatile. Shells of insulating and wide band gap metal oxides greatly enhance the photovoltaic performance due to the formation of the charge-separating junction. The broad intention of using these core–shell materials, in many different systems, is to passivate the semiconductor surface, primarily to inhibit electron–hole recombination.8a Moreover, DSSCs performance of core–shell structures is based on the conduction band position of metal oxide, highest occupied molecular orbital level of the sensitizer dye, electrolyte, the type of counter electrode, etc. A practical photoanode should be ideally inexpensive and should have a straightforward, facile and reproducible synthesis protocol with high stability under a wide variety of conditions and time frames. In this communication, we propose a facile photoanode composed of chemically grown WO3 NRs (core) and TiO2 NPs (shell) structures (Scheme 1). A charge separating junction is formed between TiO2 NPs and WO3 NRs. When the electron–hole pairs are generated in dye, electrons can be separated from holes by migrating to TiO2 and then WO3 along the potential gradient, suppressing the electron–hole recombination as illustrated in Scheme 1. Notably, the WO3 NRs were directly grown onto an FTO substrate using the hydrothermal method as reported recently8b [ESI, SI(I) and Fig. S1 (cross-section)†]. A layer of rutile TiO2 NPs ∼10–20 nm on WO3 NRs was obtained using a procedure reported previously.8c Pristine and TiO2 NPs decorated WO3 NRs photoanodes were crystallized at 350 °C for 1 h. The X-ray measurement and diffraction spectra are presented in SI(II) and Fig. S2.† Due to the difference in crystallinities the presence of rutile TiO2 NPs (decorative layer) over WO3 NRs is not well-justified. The topography of polished WO3 NRs is changed into rough after TiO2 NPs decoration [Fig. 1(a, b) and the respective insets], similar to a ZrO2 shell deposited on ZnO NW reported by Plank et al.9 Low and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of WO3 NRs decorated TiO2 NPs confirm [Fig. 1(c–f)] the formation of TiO2 NPs (shell) over WO3 NRs (core). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of WO3 NRs and TiO2 NPs are shown in Fig. 1e and 1f, respectively. The positions of distinct spots and the circular rings confirm the monoclinic and rutile phases of WO3 and TiO2, respectively. Distinct regular spots are due to a high crystallinity in WO3 NRs, whereas a set of rings in TiO2 NPs are caused by a random orientation of the nanocrystallites corresponding to diffraction from different planes of the nanocrystallites. The locations of (101), (111) and (002) planes corresponding to 2.48, 2.18 and 1.47 Å interplanar spacings are in good agreement with JCPDS no. 87-0920, confirming the formation of a rutile TiO2 NPs layer over WO3 NRs. Raman and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements [Fig. 1(g, h)] strongly support this conclusion. Raman peaks at 119, 167, 259, 311, 702 and 791 cm−1 are assigned to monoclinic WO3,10a whereas two representative peaks at 440 and 609 cm−1 correspond to Eg and A1g active modes of rutile TiO210b indicating the formation of WO3 and TiO2 core–shell structure. The surface composition of the electrodes was analyzed using EDX. Along with W, O, and Ti peaks, Cu and C peaks, which arise from the supporting copper grid, are also seen (Fig. 1h). Expected elements including W, Ti and O present over the surface of the WO3–TiO2 core–shell structured photoanode are found in good proportions (Fig. 1h). A hysteresis loop at high relative pressure in the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm for WO3 NRs [SI(III) and Fig. S3(a, b)†] is related to the capillary condensation. Despite the polished and smooth morphology, the pore diameter close to 10 nm and surface area of 1.36 m2 g−1 confirm the mesoporous character of WO3 NRs.11 The peak at 530.02 eV binding energy in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements [SI(IV) and Fig. S4(a–c)†] is assigned to O 1s1/2. The presence of two 4f 7/2 (35.5 eV) and 4f 5/2 (37.7 eV) peaks corresponds to dual states of W.10a The Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks obtained at 458.53 and 464.92 eV, respectively, have bands matching closely rutile TiO2.12 From these observations, the formation of a core–shell structure of WO3 and TiO2 is reconfirmed.

Fig. 2 shows the optical density spectra of WO3 NRs, WO3 NRs-dye, and WO3–TiO2-dye photoanodes. All electrodes show absorbance in the UV and blue regions. The absorbance edge increases at around 480 nm for WO3. The small, but clearly distinguishable hump at 500 nm wavelength is caused by N719 dye adsorption. The amount of dye adsorbed, calculated by dissolving dye in a 1 M NaOH solution and comparing absorbance with a 1 M pure NaOH solution as a reference, was found to be 2.3 × 10−8 mol cm−2 and 15.55 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for WO3 NRs-dye and WO3–TiO2-dye photoanodes, respectively. The current density–applied voltage (J–V) spectra (Fig. 2b) of WO3 NRs, WO3 NRs-dye, and WO3–TiO2-dye electrodes, obtained using a Keithley Model 2400 source measure unit at AM-1.5 radiation, show remarkable changes in three selected cases. The J–V enhancement in the WO3–TiO2-dye electrode is mainly associated with enhanced light harvesting efficiency resulting from the improved bonding across the WO3 NRs–TiO2 NPs interface and strong absorbance of dye molecules over increased surface area with efficient separation and transfer of photo-injected electrons (longer-lived charge carriers), leading to an increase in short-circuit current density Jsc from 0.9 to 5.60 mA cm−2.13 The increased roughness of the WO3 photoanode due to TiO2 NPs loading leads to a higher adsorption of dye, which results in higher photocurrent. The Voc, fill factor (ff) and power conversion efficiency (η%) for WO3 NRs and N719 dye-loaded WO3 NRs electrodes are also considerably smaller than those of WO3 NRs loaded with the TiO2 NPs electrode, implying the importance of the TiO2 NPs layer over WO3 NRs (Table S1†). It is speculated that due to ionic growth and an add-on layer of a few TiO2 NPs, there is an: (a) enhanced bonding strength between the WO3 NRs and FTO and also with N719 dye molecules, (b) enrichment of the surface roughness factor, (c) efficient charge separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs across the interface, (d) accumulation of excess dye molecules, (e) generation of longer-lived charge carriers and (f) direct transport without any random percolations.14 Just for one micron NRs length (Fig. S1†), the η% value of the WO3–TiO2-dye electrode is about 246% times higher compared with the WO3 NRs-dye electrode, revealing that the core–shell electrode not only possesses a high surface area for efficient dye adsorption, but also provides a suitable optical penetration for light-absorption and utilization. A relatively more negative conduction band position of TiO2 might be responsible for higher Voc in the WO3–TiO2-dye electrode compared to either WO3 NRs or WO3 NRs-dye electrodes.15a To support this speculation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out [Fig. 2(c, d)]. The Nyquist plots developed using a fitting circuit shown in the inset with suitable electronic parameters (Table S2†) clearly reveal lower recombination rates for the WO3–TiO2-dye electrode compared with WO3 NRs and WO3 NRs-dye electrodes. Series resistance (Rs), generally inversely proportional to ff, of the WO3 NRs-dye electrode is higher than that of WO3–TiO2-dye (Fig. S5,† starting points), consistent with J–V results, confirming that the TiO2 NPs provide good ohmic contacts between FTO, WO3 and dye molecules.13a The second semicircle in the low frequency region presents the charge transfer resistance (Rct = R2, in the present case) at the working electrode–dye interface. The higher value of Rct confirms poor charge transfer ability followed by power conversion efficiency. Both Rs and Rct have an impact on ff. Minimum Rs and Rct values of the WO3–TiO2-dye electrode over other electrodes signify the importance of the core–shell structure in DSSCs. The IPCE values for three respective electrodes at 520 nm are 32.86%, 9.80%, and 3.02%, confirming an easy charge separation and transfer across the core–shell interface. The electron lifetime (τn) for all three electrodes is calculated by fitting the photovoltage decay plot obtained from the Voc decay measurement (Fig. 2e) and by applying the equation developed by Bisquert et al.15bFig. 2f shows a plot of the log of τn as a function of Voc. Due to the polished surface and a lesser dye amount logτn diminishes quickly with Voc in the pristine WO3 NRs electrode compared to the WO3 NRs-dye and WO3–TiO2-dye electrodes, indicating a lower charge recombination rate (i.e. more efficient electron transfer) in the WO3–TiO2-dye electrode than in WO3. 1-D NRs of WO3 with continuous charge carrier transport pathways prevent the charge carrier recombination and boost the transfer velocity of photogenerated electrons in the external circuit.

In summary, the electrode with WO3 NRs (core)–TiO2 NPs (shell) structures is successfully directly grown on an FTO substrate via hydrothermal and wet chemical methods, respectively, and efficient charge-separation and transfer across the core–shell boundary with a longer-lived charge carrier are demonstrated. Compared with the pristine WO3 NRs electrode, the TiO2 NPs decorated electrode confirmed an order of magnitude enhancement in power conversion efficiency due to extraordinary improvement in photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc and ff). The Jsc, IPCE, and electron lifetime values are higher for core–shell hybrid structure than for only WO3 NRs core structure. The WO3 NRs core structure loaded with TiO2 NPs shell photoanode structure could open up new opportunities for other WO3 nanostructures, which is the topic of our forthcoming research.
