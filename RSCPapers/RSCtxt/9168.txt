    , Accepted 8th December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractIn this study, a self-powered lead-halide perovskite-based deep-ultraviolet (UV) photodetector was prepared using a solution process. A heterojunction of mixed (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 perovskite was utilized as the photo-absorber layer, and spiro-OMeTAD was utilized as the hole injection layer in a vertical structure. The device exhibited an outstanding on/off photocurrent ratio of more than 103, a good responsivity of 52.68 mA W−1, and a high detectivity of 4.65 × 1011 Jones under 254 nm UV illumination without an external bias. Moreover, the detector demonstrated superior stability while retaining a quick response speed after three weeks of storage in ambient air without encapsulation. Thus, the present study has developed a promising photodetector for several applications in the deep-UV region.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, ultraviolet (UV) detectors have received tremendous attention from scientific researchers owing to their promising applications, such as secret communication, image sensing, environmental monitoring, astronomy, and medicine.1–4 In particular, Wenqiang Tan et al.5 reported the online detection of partial discharge in power transformers using UV pulses. Accordingly, the weak discharge signals from high-voltage electrical equipment or insulation systems can be monitored and predicted in the early stages.
Generally, UV radiation is divided into three regions according to the wavelength range: UVA (400–320 nm), UVB (320–280 nm), and UVC (280–100 nm).6 Most UVC radiation from sunlight does not reach the earth's surface, as it is absorbed by the ozone layer; consequently, only a weak signal can be detected.7 UVC rays can also be emitted from artificial light (such as arc welding torches, mercury lamps, and UV sanitizing bulbs) or sunbeds.8 However, even an extremely low exposure to deep UV can have harmful effects.9 Therefore, semiconductor UV photodetectors, which convert incident optical signals to electrical signals, were developed to measure UV radiation.
Previously, several types of inorganic semiconductors, such as Ga2O3, GaN, ZnGa2O4, MoS2/Si, and diamond, have been used for UV detection. However, the fabrication of these materials requires high-temperature, sophisticated, and expensive approaches such as molecular beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, atomic layer deposition, and magnetron sputtering.10–15 By contrast, perovskite materials can be fabricated via a low-temperature solution process. Therefore, these materials are being increasingly employed in optoelectronic devices instead of other semiconductors.16–20 Halide perovskites with mixed anion and cation components have demonstrated that they can significantly improve the solar cell performance and long-term device stability. For instance, Mengjie Sun et al.21 demonstrated that a device with mixed MA/FA/Pb/I/Br components can achieve a power conversion efficiency of more than 19% and stability in the air after one month.
Perovskites have rapidly replaced other semiconductor materials in photodetectors owing to their advantages such as low-temperature fabrication, ease of preparation, low weight, and low operating voltage.22 Moreover, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites exhibit several inherent properties such as a large optical absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and tunable bandgap. In consequence, photodetectors based on halide perovskites reported enable sensitively to detect a broad spectrum from the Gamma to the infrared radiation region with an ultra-fast response speed.23 For example, CH3NH3PbI3-based photodetectors fastly responded to X-ray (response time in hundreds of ps), visible (response time less than 5 μs), and near-infrared radiation (trise/tfall of 71/112 μs).24–26 Especially, regarding to UV detection, Giacomo Maculan et al.27 achieved a detectivity of 1.2 × 1010 Jones and trise/tfall of 24/62 ms at a bias voltage of 15 V in the 300–400 nm region using a CH3NH3PbCl3 perovskite. In a similar region detection, Erjin Zheng et al.28 achieved a higher responsivity of 0.047 A W−1 and a detectivity of 6.87 × 1010 Jones under a bias of 0 V.
Nonetheless, the use of halide perovskites for detection in the UVC region has rarely been reported. In this regard, Zhang et al.29 observed that the response speeds of CH3NH3PbX3 materials are 103 times higher than those of Ga2O3 and ZnO detectors. However, the photodetectors require additional input power and thus, consume higher energy. Thus, self-powered photodetectors are considered promising for practical use. The term self-powered is related to the configurations of devices, such as vertically stacked and laterally structured types. Most photodetectors that utilize a lateral structure such as metal–semiconductor–metal requires an applied bias for the orientation of the photogenerated carriers toward the electrodes. By contrast, vertically structured photodetectors are easier to operate under zero bias because they utilize the significantly shortened pathway of carriers and the hole/electron injection layer.
Thus, this study mainly focused on preparing a self-powered photodetector with a vertical structure via a solution process to achieve high sensitivity in the UVC region. In addition, the influences of bias voltages and light intensities were investigated. Consequently, the prepared photodetector based on perovskite exhibited a favorable detectivity of 4.65 × 1011 Jones and a responsivity of 52.68 mA W−1 at a bias of 0 V under a UV lamp at 254 nm. The device could retain 80% of its photocurrent performance after three weeks. This device is expected to be used in relevant fields.
2. Results and discussion
The crystalline structure of the mixed-halide perovskite was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. 1a, the sharp diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.02°, 19.82°, 28.12°, and 31.57° are assigned to planes (110), (112), (220), and (310), respectively, of the (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 crystal, consistent with previous reports.31,32 The absorption spectrum of the perovskite film on the quartz substrate is displayed in Fig. 1b. It is apparent that the perovskite has strong broadband absorption from 800 nm to 200 nm. Therefore, the photodetector based on this type of perovskite is capable of detecting deep-UV light. The wide absorption range of lead-halide perovskite is ascribed to the narrow bandgap with an energy gap, estimated from the Tauc plot, to be 1.56 eV (inset in Fig. 1b). Additionally, the steady-state PL spectrum (in Fig. 1c) shows the emission peak at the wavelength of 802 nm was compatible with a sharp edge of the UV-vis spectrum. TRPL measurement is performed to evaluate the lifetime of photocarriers as shown in Fig. 1d. The average decay time (τavg) of (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 perovskite, derived from fitting three-exponential decay function, is 269.7 ns. This decay time is longer than the values of MAPbBr3 (τavg = 173 ns)10 and Cl-doped MAPbI3 (τavg = 103.4 ns),33 indicating low bulk recombination accompanied with a large number of separated carriers for charge collection at the electrodes.34

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the perovskite thin film on the quartz substrate is shown in Fig. 1e. The large and densely uniform perovskite crystals with grains at a scale greater than 1 μm, obtained using the two-step solution process, are believed to minimize the grain boundaries.35 Furthermore, the non-uniform growth in nucleation owing to the presence of various halide ions (i.e. FA and MA) resulted in the smaller grains as interconnecting crystallites for filling spatial gaps between the large grains.19 Consequently, the perovskite film tends to be compact and continuous, which contributed to suppressing structural defects. Furthermore, the surface of perovskite material spin-coated on quartz substrate displayed smooth film with root-mean-square roughness (Rq) is approximately 22.043 nm, as shown in Fig. 1f.

Fig. 2a shows the structure of the fabricated device. The layer thickness examined from the cross-sectional SEM image is displayed in Fig. 2b. In this study, the photodetector was built with a vertical configuration, consisting of a perovskite thin film (∼580 nm) operating as the UV absorber layer, spiro-OMeTAD (∼136 nm) as the hole transport layer along with an electron blocking layer, and two ITO/Au electrodes. The energy band diagram of the device is presented in Fig. 2c. When UV light was illuminated on the perovskite, the photogenerated carriers were produced without a bias voltage and were circulated to generate photocurrents, as the energy levels matched well. Moreover, the spiro-OMeTAD layer was inserted between the perovskite layer and the electrode to not only support the hole transfer but also prevent electron injection from the Au electrode, which leads to a low dark current in the device.28 Besides the energy band requirement, the trap densities in the mixed-halide perovskite also affect the efficient charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 2d and e, the I–V curves of hole-only and electron-only perovskite-based devices in dark condition performed the space charge limited currents (SCLC). As expect, the trap-filled limit voltages (VTFL) of the hole- and electron-only devices are 0.195 V and 0.45 V, respectively. Subsequently, the hole and trap densities (ntraps) of both devices are estimated equal to 1.6 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.6 × 1015 cm−3, which were significantly lower than those of halide perovskite reported in the literature.33,36,37 The low charge trapping, favorable for the carrier transfer to electrodes, is a consequence of reducing surface defects in the compact film as mentioned in Fig. 1e.

Fig. 3a plots the current–voltage (I–V) curves of the perovskite detector in a dark environment and under 254 nm light illumination, with a light intensity of 0.774 mW cm−2. The result reveals that the photocurrent significantly increases with increasing negative bias voltage. Notably, the photodetector can operate without an external bias voltage. The time-switching responses of the photodetector under the different bias voltages of 0, −0.05. −0.1, −0.15, and 0.2 V are shown in Fig. 3b. According to the spectra, both the photocurrent and the dark current increase with increasing bias voltage.

(c) R and D* as a function of voltage and (d) the bias-voltage-dependent EQE under the 254 nm light with an intensity of 0.774 mW cm−2. 
The responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) are two key parameters for quantitatively evaluating a photodetector. R, which reflects the response of the photodetector to the incident light, is expressed as R = (Ilight − Idark)/PoptS, where Ilight is the output current (current under 254 nm UV illumination), Idark is the current under dark conditions, Popt is the incident optical power, and S is the effective illuminated area of the device. D* is expressed as D* = R/(2qJdark), where q is the electron charge, and Jdark is the current density of the dark current. Fig. 3c shows that the value of R increased gradually as the operating voltage was increased from 0 V to −0.2 V. This can be explained by the increase in the conversion efficiency of the photodetector from photons to charges under different bias voltages. By contrast, the D* values decreased slightly due to their reciprocal dependence on the dark current, and they showed a remarkably increasing tendency at a higher applied reverse bias. The dark current is minimum for the case of 0 V. Consequently, the highest detectivity value was observed for the self-powered photodetector.
In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was used to examine the optical properties.
It can be calculated as EQE = Rhc/eλ, where h, c, and λ are the Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the wavelength of irradiation (254 nm), respectively. From the above equation, EQE is defined as the proportion of the output number of electrons/holes to the number of incident photons. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 3d, the EQE increased sharply under the applied higher bias voltage because of the higher R value.
For the self-powered photodetector operating under 254 nm irradiation, Fig. S1† depicts a set of I–V curves with different light intensities. The photocurrent tended to increase rapidly with the increase in optical power, both at zero voltage and under an applied bias. The time-dependent photocurrent density curves are shown in Fig. 4a. The photocurrent increased from 0.4899 μA to 1.4153 μA at 0 V when the incident light intensity varied from 0.354 mW cm−2 to 1.01 mW cm−2. This is because the higher the illumination power, the larger the number of photoexcited electron–hole pairs generated, thereby resulting in an increased photocurrent. In addition, the on/off photocurrent ratio at zero bias is calculated to be more than 103 (in Fig. 4b). The relation of generated photocurrent and incident light intensity of photodetector can be fitted from Ilight ∝ Poptθ, where θ is the index of the power exponent. The θ value was determined to be 1 for the device, which indicated the passivation of trap states and defects in prepared perovskite material.2,38,39 Owing to the relation between R and Ilight to be R ∝ (Ilight/Popt), the parameters of R, D*, and EQE are independent on Popt when θ equal to 1. As a result, they are observed to change negligibly over a range of light intensities as depicted in Fig. 4c. Additionally, the wavelength-dependent EQE of the prepared photodetector in the range of 250–1100 nm at zero bias (Fig. 4d) exhibited the window detectable wavelength of the device appropriate 800 nm. The observed line shape is in agreement with the UV-vis spectrum of mixed halide perovskite (in Fig. 1b).

Fig. 5a magnifies the photoresponse of the device under the 254 nm illumination, with a power density of 0.774 mW cm−2 at 0 V, to determine the response time, which is considered an important parameter of the photodetector as it characterizes the response speed to the incident light accurately and quickly. The rise time (trise) (from 10% to 90% of the peak value) and fall time (tfall) (from 90% to 10% of the peak value) of the device at a light intensity of 0.774 mW cm−2 were calculated to be 46 and 47 ms, respectively. This response time is comparable to previous halide perovskite-based photodetector (e.g. trise/tfall: 230/380 ms of MAPbI3−xClx; trise/tfall: 91/101 ms of MAPbI3)33,40 and superior to prevalent metal oxide-based photodetector (e.g. trise/tfall: 2.5/10 s of TiO2; trise/tfall: 0.682/1.77 s of CuO, and trise/tfall: 0.7/2.95 s of ZnO)41–43 and reported photoelectrochemical detectors based on BiQDs (trise/tfall: 0.1/0.2 s) or MoS2 (trise/tfall in the unit of seconds).44,45 It is found that the similarity between rise time and fall time, which is regarded as a result of suppressing traps in the mixed-halide perovskite. More specifically, the photocurrent of a device possessing fewer traps immediately collapsed when the UV-light source turned off, which led to fast tfall, due to the fast declines of photo-carriers. On the other hand, the photo-carriers would be captured for a moment by the numerous amount of traps in the active layer previous to release for contributing to circuit current, which elongated the tfall.

The transient photoresponse insignificantly changed after 260 cycles (in Fig. 5b), accompanied with the photocurrent per cycle remained stable up to longer than 150 minutes (Fig. S2†). This suggests an outstanding reproducibility and photostability of the as-prepared photodetector. Besides, the photocurrent of the device retained appropriately 80% after three weeks of storage in ambient air without encapsulation, revealing the long-term stability of the device. The XRD and UV-vis measurements of (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 on quartz substrate at the beginning and after 3 weeks were examined to further evidence the photostability of the mix-halide perovskite. As shown in Fig. S3,† the extra peak appeared at 12.7° after storage 3 weeks, which was presumably assigned to PbI2. However, the XRD pattern maintained all characteristic diffraction peaks of the perovskite material. Moreover, the UV-vis in Fig. S4† also demonstrated the negligible change of the absorption. This can be explained that using mixed halide ions of FA and MA leads to reducing the number of traps, which cause occurring O2 adsorption in the air.19 Another reason for stability, the prepared photodetector was constructed without a prevalent electron transport layer (TiO2) because TiO2 can degrade the perovskite layer under UV irradiation with moisture.46 The parameters of the UV detector based on inorganic–organic halide perovskite prepared in this study were higher than those of the photodetectors reported in previous studies (see Table 1).

3. Conclusions
A vertically structured perovskite photodetector was fabricated via a solution process at a low temperature. The as-fabricated device displayed excellent photoresponse characteristics to 254 nm deep-UV light at zero bias with a fast response speed of 46/47 ms (rise/fall times) and an outstanding on/off ratio of more than 103. Moreover, the device showed superior stability under ambient conditions. Thus, this study provides a promising sensor for deep-UV detection.
4. Experimental
Materials
PbI2 (Aldrich, 99%), HC(NH2)2I (FAI) (GreatCell Solar, Australia), CH3NH3Br (MABr) (Aldrich, ≥99%), CH3NH3HCl (MACl) (Aldrich, ≥98%), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) (Aldrich, 99.95%), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) (Aldrich, 99%), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich, 96%) were obtained. The following organic solvents were used: dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (99.8%), and acetonitrile (99.93%).
Device fabrication
First, an indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated quartz substrate (15 Ω m−2) was cleaned sequentially with detergent, acetone, isopropanol, deionized water, and ethanol, using an ultrasonic bath. The substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 20 min to remove the residuals and enhance the wettability prior to the deposition of the perovskite film.30
The perovskite film was deposited on the substrate via a two-step method in a glove box. First, the PbI2 solution (600 mg, dissolved in 1 mL of a mixture of DMF and DMSO (0.95:0.5 v/v ratio)) was spin-coated on the substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then, the specimen was heated on a hot plate at 70 °C for 1 min. Then, a mixed organic halide solution of FAI:MABr:MACl (60 mg:6 mg:6 mg, dissolved in a mixture of 1 mL IPA and 10 μL DMSO) was dispersed on the surface of the PbI2 film at 4000 rpm (loading time of 20 s). The perovskite film was obtained after annealing the specimen at 150 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, a spiro-OMeTAD solution (80 mg, dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene, with 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile)) was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Au electrode with a thickness of 80 nm was thermally evaporated under a high vacuum pressure of 8 × 10−6 Torr.
Device characterization
The crystalline structure of the perovskite film was examined using XRD (Rigaku DMAX 2200, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.506 Å) at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The absorption of the perovskite film was recorded using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (Agilent 8453, USA) respectively. The steady-state PL and time-resolved PL of prepared perovskite film were acquired using the spectrophotofluorometer (Fluorolog3 with TCSPC, Horiba, Japan). The surface morphology and roughness of the photodetector were determined using SEM (Hitachi S-4700, Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM; Park systems, PSIA XE-150, South Korea), respectively. The cross-sectional image of the photodetector was captured using a focused ion beam SEM (Hitachi S-4700, Japan). The photosensitivity was recorded through simulated UV irradiation from a 254 nm UV lamp (VL6.LC, France). The lamp was connected to a Keithley source meter (2400, USA) to record the electrical signal of the photodetector. The EQE was obtained by the solar McScience K3100 system (Korea).
