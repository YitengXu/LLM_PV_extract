    , Accepted 30th April 2018First published on 30th April 2018AbstractVery recently, all-inorganic perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) nanostructures such as nanoparticles, nanoplates, and nanorods have been extensively explored. These CsPbX3 nanostructures exhibit excellent optical properties; however, the photophysics involved is not yet clear. Herein, the emission properties and luminescence mechanism of CsPbBr3 nanosheets (NSs) were investigated using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic techniques. Moreover, two kinds of excitonic emissions (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are observed at low temperatures (<80 K) under the conditions of low excitation level. They are revealed to stem from the radiative recombination of trapped and free excitons by examining their spectral features and emission intensity dependences on excitation power. Thermally induced exchange between the two kinds of excitons is found and modeled quantitatively; this has led to the determination of an activation energy of 13 meV. Thermal redistribution of trapped excitons and thermal expansion-induced blueshift of the bandgap are jointly responsible for the abnormal temperature dependence of the position of Peak 1, whereas the latter is predominant for the monotonic blueshift of the position of Peak 2 with an increase in temperature. These results and findings shed some light on the complicated luminescence mechanism of CsPbBr3 NSs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, metal halide perovskites have attracted extensive interest due to their promising optoelectronic applications such as in high-efficiency solar cells,1–3 light-emitting diodes,4,5 lasers,6,7 and photodetectors.8,9 For example, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites were applied as light absorbers in solar cells, yielding power conversion efficiencies over 20%.10 Their inorganic analogues such as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have also drawn significant attention due to their improved stability. CsPbX3 with a three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structure, such as that of single and bulk crystals, showed a poor photoluminescence (PL) signal.11 In the 3D perovskite structure, excitons are easily dissociated into free charge carriers (electrons and holes); then, separated carriers are transported by accessing the connected octahedral lattice due to the low exciton binding energy in the 3D perovskite structure.11,12 Thus, radiative recombination is unfavorable. However, while reducing the dimension from bulk to nanoscale, such as to quasi-2D nanosheets, CsPbX3 can exhibit extraordinary optical properties such as strong luminescence, widely tunable absorption/emission ranges, and narrow spectral width.13–20 For example, Kovalenko and co-workers developed CsPbX3 nanocubes, presenting an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to ∼90% without additional surface passivation.15 Yang and co-workers have demonstrated the PLQY value of 84% in five-monolayer thick CsPbBr3 nanoplates.16 In a recent study, Shen et al. reported almost 100% PLQY in phase-stable CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots.21 Therefore, nanostructured CsPbX3 has been considered a promising light-emitting material.
Despite these remarkable advances, the current understanding of the photophysics of nanostructured CsPbX3 is still quite limited. A study reported by Zeng and co-workers led to the determination of exciton binding energy in quasi-2D CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets.22 An anomalous blue shift of the PL peak position with the increasing temperature has been observed by several groups, but a solid physical explanation seems to be still lacking.23,24 From our point of view, even the photoexcitation landscape, transportation, and recombination mechanisms of excitons in nanostructured CsPbX3 are poorly understood. All these issues are within the domain of photophysics and vital to the promising optoelectronic applications of nanostructured CsPbX3. To deepen the current understanding of the photophysics of these functional nanomaterials, we have presented an in-depth investigation of the steady-state and transient PL properties of CsPbBr3 nanosheet (NS) films. The steady-state PL spectra of the studied CsPbBr3 NSs at low temperatures (e.g. <80 K) comprise a broad emission band at low energy and a narrow emission line at high energy. Based on the peak position, lineshape, and excitation-power dependence, the high energy peak is attributed to the emission of free excitons, whereas the low energy band is attributed to the radiative recombination of trapped excitons. By examining temperature dependences of the relative integrated PL intensities of the two emissions, we revealed thermal migration from the trapped excitons to the free excitons with an increase in temperature.
2. Results and discussion
CsPbBr3 NSs were synthesized by the hot-injection method previously reported by Shamsi et al.25 The NSs were precipitated from the original solution by centrifugation and then re-dispersed in hexane. The cycle of centrifugation and re-dispersion was repeated three times. The centrifugation and re-dispersion will remove partial ligands, but may increase surface defects. Fig. 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the synthesized CsPbBr3 NSs. Well-defined square shapes can be evidently seen in the SEM morphology image. The average lateral size of the NSs was about 700 nm, which was significantly larger than that of CsPbBr3 NSs reported previously.16,22 Owing to their large lateral dimension, the CsPbBr3 NSs tended to lie flat on the substrate. Furthermore, the thickness of the NSs was probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 1b, the AFM image and especially the height profiles obtained along the black lines in the AFM image validate the average 16 nm thickness of the NSs. A fluorescence image of the NSs was obtained by confocal microscopy when the NSs were illuminated with a 405 nm continuous-wave laser diode, as shown in Fig. 1c. The solid sample of NSs for PL imaging was prepared by dropping the NS solution on a glass substrate. The NSs were left behind after evaporation of the solvent. From the PL image, we can see that the NSs emit bright green light under laser diode excitation. Moreover, the room-temperature absorption and PL spectra of the CsPbBr3 NSs were obtained and are depicted as black and red solid lines, respectively, in Fig. 1d. An exciton absorption peak at around 523 nm and emission peak at about 525 nm are observed at room temperature for the sample. The CsPbBr3 NS solid film studied for variable-temperature PL investigations was prepared by dropping a concentrated NS solution on a Si substrate.

Fig. 2 shows the temperature-dependent PL spectra of the CsPbBr3 NS film obtained from 10 K to 200 K. The PL spectra were obtained for the film sample under an excitation of ∼7 μW 405 nm light dispersed with a grating monochromator from a Xe lamp. Weak excitation light was utilized to minimize the possible unwanted influence of intense excitation light on the sample. At higher temperatures, the PL spectra display a single dominant peak. As the temperature decreases to 60 K, a broad band located in the low-energy side becomes observable. At low temperatures, e.g., ≤20 K, the broad band is dominant over the high-energy line. To extract the peak position and obtain the PL-integrated (areal) intensity of each peak, we fitted both emission peaks with a Gaussian lineshape function for the PL spectra below 80 K. For convenience, hereinafter, the low-energy broad band is denoted as Peak 1, and the high-energy line is denoted as Peak 2. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, the two emissions show a thermally driven conversion relationship, which has not yet been reported in CsPbBr3 NSs. For example, the Peak 1 intensity attenuates rapidly, and simultaneously, the Peak 2 exhibits a fast increase in emission intensity as the temperature increases in the low temperature range. Both emissions cross at ∼50 K. When Peak 1 quenches at ∼80 K, Peak 2 reaches its maximum intensity. This apparent conversion behavior is a very interesting phenomenon. In GaInP2 alloy with partial atomic ordering, a similar luminescence channel transition was experimentally discovered and viewed as a direct optical signature of the Mott transition.26 As shown below, the nature of the two emissions has been discussed first.

(c) A color plot of the temperature-dependent PL spectra shown in (a) and (b). (d) PL-integrated intensities of Peak 1 and Peak 2 versus temperature. Solid lines are drawn to guide the eyes. 
In the literature, both emissions have been previously observed in CsPbBr3 single crystals and CsPbBr3-like quantum dots in CsBr single crystals.27,28 The low energy Peak 1 and the high energy Peak 2 were attributed to the emissions of trapped and free excitons, respectively.28 Observation of the excitation power dependences of the two emissions is very helpful for identifying the nature of both emissions. Fig. 3a shows PL spectra obtained at 10 K by varying the excitation power from about 0.05 mW to 30 mW. Note that a 405 nm laser diode was employed as the excitation light source for the excitation-power-dependent PL measurements. At low excitation levels (e.g. 0.05 mW), the low energy Peak 1 centered at about 550 nm was dominant. However, upon increasing the excitation power, the high energy Peak 2 grew rapidly and eventually became dominant. As is known, the nature of the recombination process may be determined from the dependence of the PL intensity on the excitation power.29 Moreover, the PL intensity could be fitted by a power law of the form Lk with 1 < k < 2 for an exciton-like transition (either free exciton transitions or bound exciton transitions), where L is the excitation power.30 In contrast, both the free carrier to bound level transitions (hole-neutral-donor (hD0) or electron-neutral-acceptor (eA0) and electron-neutral-acceptor transitions (D0A0)) will yield slopes much smaller than 1 with a tendency towards 0.5.30 In the case studied herein, the low energy Peak 1 and the high energy Peak 2 are found to have slope values of k = 1.05 and 1.50, respectively, as indicated in Fig. 3b. Thus, it is concluded that both emissions in the CsPbBr3 NSs are excitonic emissions. Peak 2 on the high energy side is due to the emission of free excitons, whereas Peak 1 is due to the radiative recombination of trapped excitons. Br vacancy centers within the CsPbBr3 lattice were reported to be responsible for the trapping centers of excitons on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.31 The larger slope value of Peak 2 in the excitation power dependence of emission intensity could be attributed to the thermalization of the partially trapped excitons to free excitons.

To further analyze the natures of the broad and narrow PL emissions, their time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay curves were measured at 5 K. The measured results are illustrated in Fig. 4a where they are fitted with a tri-exponential function: I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3). The smooth solid lines represent the fitting curves with a short time constant (τ1 = 0.943 ns (0.517 ns)), an intermediate time constant (τ2 = 7.538 ns (3.822 ns)), and a long time constant (τ3 = 220.014 ns (112.738 ns)) for Peak 1 (Peak 2). The average PL lifetimes can be obtained by the expression: τav = ((A1 × τ12) + (A2 × τ22) + (A3 × τ32))/((A1 × τ1) + (A2 × τ2) + (A3 × τ3)). As collective photoluminescence from the CsPbBr3 NSs ensemble was measured in our study, the tri-exponential decay behaviour might result from the size distribution of NSs as compared to the single-exponential decay behaviour for a single CsPbBr3 nanocrystal.32 Therefore, the average PL lifetimes were determined to be 210.337 ns and 83.578 ns for Peaks 1 and 2, respectively. The much shorter PL lifetime of Peak 2 at 5 K may mean that efficient capture of free excitons by trap states occurs at this low temperature that can significantly shorten the lifetime of free excitons.27,28 It also rules out the possibility of free charges playing a role in the emission of Peak 2 since the lifetime of free charges is orders of magnitude larger than that of excitons. As the temperature increases, reverse transfer from the trapped exciton state to the free exciton state will become highly possible due to thermal activation or thermalization of the trapped excitons. Moreover, the thermal motion of free excitons becomes more significant and thus may hinder the recombination of free excitons. As an outcome, the temperature-dependent PL shows an increase in lifetime with an increase in temperature for both peaks (Fig. 4b and c); this is similar to the trend observed by others.22,23 Excitation intensity-dependent TRPL may provide more information on the photophysics of carriers, especially on the recombination dynamics of carriers. Manger et al. recently reveal that germinate pathways along with free carriers and traps are dominant at high carrier densities in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites, such as methylammonium lead iodide perovskite, at room temperature.33 Further studies along this direction are in progress on our samples. The second part of the present study was focused on the thermally driven transfer between the two kinds of excitonic states that might be quantitatively described by a phenomenological theoretical model.34

As shown in Fig. 2, temperature-induced intensity crossover between Peak 1 and Peak 2 occurred at ∼50 K, and Peak 1 became unobservable at 80 K. Therefore, it is reasonably speculated that thermal transfer between the trapped excitons and the free excitons is a major physical mechanism within the temperature range of 10–80 K. Temperature dependence of the integrated intensity ratio of the two emissions with thermal exchange was formulated by Xu and co-workers as34 (1)where I1 (I2), R1 (R2), and Rn1 (Rn2) are the integrated intensity and radiative and nonradiative recombination rates of Peak 1 (Peak 2), respectively. U0 is the trapping rate, and the term U0e−Et/kBT provides the detrapping rate. Et is the thermal activation energy or barrier height characterizing thermal detrapping of the trapped excitons.34 The best fitting result with eqn (1) was obtained by taking R1 = 8.10 × 107 s−1, R2 = 1.76 × 109 s−1, Rn1 = 5.06 × 1013 s−1, U0 = 3.04 × 1016 s−1, and Et = 13.0 meV, as depicted by the red solid line in Fig. 5, where the experimental PL-integrated intensity ratios of Peak 1 with respect to Peak 2 are illustrated in solid squares against temperature. The thermal activation energy obtained in this study (13.0 meV) is in good agreement with the activation energy (10–15 meV) of the thermal quenching of trapped excitons in the CsPbCl3 single crystal reported by Nikl et al.35 It has been argued that the trapping rate of free excitons may increase with temperature.34 Following the argument and speculating that U = U0T (a linear temperature dependence), we may explain the thermal behaviors of the emissions self-consistently. At very low temperatures, the trapping rate U of free excitons is much larger than the detrapping rate Ue−Et/kBT of the trapped excitons. In other words, the trapping of free excitons is extremely efficient. That is why Peak 1 is dominant over Peak 2 at very low temperatures. Moreover, efficient trapping causes a shorter PL lifetime for Peak 2, as observed in Fig. 4. As the temperature increases, the detrapping rate Ue−Et/kBT of the trapped excitons increases exponentially. As a result, Peak 1 attenuates quickly, and Peak 2 simultaneously grows remarkably. From the model simulation results and on the basis of the abovementioned arguments, we may have a physical picture describing thermal exchange between the two kinds of excitons in the CsPbBr3 NS film, as schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 5.

Finally, we have discussed the temperature dependences of peak positions of the two emissions. Fig. 6 shows the measured peak positions (solid symbols) of the two emissions versus temperature. The position of Peak 1 exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on temperature, i.e., redshifts first and then turns to blueshift, reflecting the localized nature of the trapped excitons.36 The position of Peak 2 basically monotonically blueshifts with the increasing temperature over almost the entire temperature range of interest, except for several points at temperatures close to 300 K. According to the Elliott's theory,37 the eigenenergy of a free exciton state is described as. Herein, Eg is the fundamental bandgap of a semiconductor, Eb is the binding energy of exciton, and n is the quantum number. For n = 1 exciton state, optical transition is allowed. If the binding energy of the free exciton does not change with temperature, temperature dependence of the n = 1 exciton state transition shall follow the temperature dependence of the fundamental bandgap of a semiconductor in a certain temperature range.38,39 Since Peak 2 was identified to be originating from the radiative recombination of free excitons in CsPbBr3 NSs, the temperature dependence of its peak position shall reflect the variation tendency of the fundamental bandgap of the CsPbBr3 crystal with temperature. With regard to the temperature dependence of the band gap of perovskite semiconductors, recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the band gaps of perovskite semiconductors exhibit an anomalous blue shift with the increasing temperature.40–46 From these studies including first-principles calculations, it has been revealed that the bandgaps of perovskite semiconductors follow positive linear dependences on temperature in a certain temperature range mainly due to thermal expansion of the lattice. In addition to thermal expansion, electron–lattice–vibration (phonon) coupling has been well justified to make an important and even dominant contribution to the temperature dependence of the semiconductor bandgap. Herein, we follow O'Donnell–Chen's arguments on the contribution of electron–phonon coupling to temperature-dependent bandgap47 and advocate an equation for perovskite semiconductors: Eg(T) = Eg(0) + ATET − S〈ħω〉[coth(〈ħω〉/2kBT) − 1],(2)where Eg(0) is the bandgap at 0 K, ATE is an adjustable parameter accounting for the contribution of thermal expansion, S is a dimensionless adjustable parameter (e.g., Huang–Rhys factor) characterizing electron–phonon coupling strength,48 and 〈ħω〉 is an average or effective phonon energy, which is also an adjustable parameter. Using eqn (2), we attempted to fit the experimental data (solid triangles) of Peak 2, and a best fitting curve (solid line) is depicted in Fig. 6. Various parameters adopted for the best fitting were Eg(0) = 2.285 eV, ATE = 0.597 meV K−1, S = 3.223, and 〈ħω〉 = 28.011 meV. Excellent agreement between the experimental results and fitting results is achieved, leading to a concluding point: thermal expansion is the major mechanism for the observed blueshift of Peak 2.
 Fig. 6  Peak positions (solid symbols) of Peaks 1 and 2 vs. temperature. The solid lines are the fitting curves obtained using the equations described in the text. 
For temperature dependence of the position of Peak 1, an explicit expression may be given as El(T) = Eg(T) − Δ − x(T)kBT,(3)where Δ is a constant due to the energy difference between Peak 1 and Peak 2 at 0 K and x(T) is a temperature-dependent dimensionless parameter accounting for the thermal redistribution of localized excitons due to thermal occupation, thermal escape, etc.36 This parameter can be found by numerically solving the following nonlinear equation:36,49 (4)
Definitions and physical implications of the parameters in the abovementioned equation can be obtained from the localized-state ensemble (LSE) luminescence model developed by Li and Xu.36,49,50 A fitting curve to the experimental data of Peak 1 is illustrated as a solid line in Fig. 6 wherein E0 = 2.285 eV, Ea = 2.272 eV, Δ = 14.4 meV, and σ = 13.6 meV were adopted. It is clear that a good agreement between the theoretical fitting and experimental data is realized.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, the luminescence mechanism of the synthesized CsPbBr3 NSs with good morphology was studied with steady-state and transient PL spectroscopic techniques. A broad emission band at low energy and a narrow emission peak at high energy were simultaneously observed at low temperatures (<80 K) at extremely weak excitation powers. Excitation power and temperature dependences of the two emissions show that these emissions stem from the radiative recombination of trapped and free excitons. Temperature dependence of the relative intensity is quantitatively explained by a model taking the thermal exchange between the free and trapped excitons into account, such that a characteristic activation energy of 13 meV is obtained. For anomalous temperature dependence of their peak positions, the thermal redistribution and lattice expansion are revealed to be main factors for the trapped excitonic luminescence and the free excitonic emission, respectively. This study thus provides valuable insights into the luminescence mechanism of CsPbBr3 NSs, which is a highly promising light-emitting material.
4. Experimental
4.1 Synthesis of CsPbBr3 NSs
The cesium oleate precursor was first prepared by dissolving 0.045 g Cs2CO3 in 5 mL OA at 120 °C for 30 min, and Ar gas was flowed to take the water away. After this, it was heated to 140 °C for 10 min. Next, 10 mL ODE, 0.039 g PbBr2, 0.25 mL OA, 0.25 mL OAm, 0.4 mL OctAc, and 0.4 mL OctAm were added into a 3-neck flask and dried under an Ar gas flow at 100 °C for 30 min. The solution was heated to 120 °C, and 1 mL of cesium oleate precursor solution was swiftly injected into the PbBr2 solution. Then, the mixed solution was heated to 100 °C for 5 min; after completion of the reaction, the reaction was quenched by transferring the flask to an ice water bath. Hexane was added to the crude solution in the volume ratio of 1:1, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. After this, the supernatant was discarded, and the bottom sediment was redispersed in hexane with gentle shaking. Triple purification was conducted in total. The CsPbBr3 NS thin film was prepared by drying a drop of concentrated NS solution on the Si substrate. All the above mentioned materials were purchased from Aladdin.
4.2 Characterization
An FEI Quanta 250 FEG scanning electron microscope was used to acquire the SEM images. The thicknesses of NSs were measured using a Veeco Innova atomic force microscope. Fluorescence imaging was carried out at room temperature via a WITec scanning confocal microscopy system integrated with an Acton monochromator and an Andor CCD detector. The excitation source was a 405 nm continuous-wave laser diode.
4.3 PL measurements
Steady-state PL spectral measurements were carried out using a home-assembled system composed of two Acton monochromators with a focus length of 30 cm.51 A standard lock-in amplification technique was employed. The sample was mounted with silver paint on the cold finger of a Janis closed cycle cryostat providing a varying temperature range from 10 K to 330 K. The excitation light sources were a high-pressure Xe-lamp (Müller, Germany) and a continuous-wave laser diode with a central wavelength of 405 nm. Excitation power was controlled by a variable neutral density filter. In the time-resolved PL measurement, a picosecond laser diode (wavelength: 399.6 nm, pulse duration: 70 ps, repetition rate: 80 MHz, mean power: 0.45 mW) was employed as the excitation source, and a time-correlated-single-photon-counting (TCSPC) system was used. The repetition rate of laser diode pulses was reduced to 2.5 MHz using a pulse picker during the measurement. The PL signal was dispersed with a 32 cm monochromator and temporally resolved using a micro-channel-plate photomultiplier tube (PMT).
