    , Accepted 18th April 2021First published on 19th April 2021AbstractSurface and interface engineering predominantly determines the overall surface dynamics, and the surface layers can benefit substantially from a chemically different underneath layer. Herein, we demonstrate the surface tuning of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) with awaruite (Ni3Fe). The NiFe2O4 grows in the form of a crystalline monolayer encompassing bimetallic Ni3Fe nanocrystals embedded within a polyaniline (PANI) matrix. This is achieved by a simple and highly reproducible chemical approach. Benzyl alcohol (BA) and PANI steer the growth of metallic Ni3Fe covered with a monolayer of NiFe2O4 under mild solvothermal conditions. PANI presumably renders anchoring sites and guides the formation of fine and monodisperse nanocrystals of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe, while BA acts as a reducing agent and controls the nucleation and the growth of NiFe2O4. In the absence of PANI, the formation of large and agglomerated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is observed. The fine interface created between the NiFe2O4 monolayer and Ni3Fe imparts unique and superior surface attributes; Ni3Fe renders a high electroactive surface area and faster charge transport, while the NiFe2O4 monolayer affords high catalytic ability. As a result, the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode efficiently catalyzes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and requires a substantially lower overpotential than those of NiO/PANI, NiFe2O4, and Fe2O3/PANI. The Tafel values suggest that the kinetics of the half-reaction at the catalytic interface of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is much faster (52.3 mV dec−1) than that of NiO/PANI (82.5 mV dec−1), NiFe2O4 (86.0 mV dec−1) and Fe2O3/PANI (108.3 mV dec−1). The turnover frequency of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is 0.27 s−1, 5.4 fold higher than that of NiFe2O4 (0.05 s−1). Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area, electrochemical impedance, surface charge transport properties, and active sites of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 are estimated, compared and correlated to the OER performance. In addition, density functional theory calculations show a decrease in the barrier of the potential-determining step from *O to *OOH, indicating a favorable electronic modulation at the interface of NiFe2O4 and Ni3Fe, which reduces the overpotential requirement.
Introduction
From energy and environmental viewpoints, the surge in the field of solar and wind energy with the aim of developing clean energy technology is continuing to rise. In light of the magnitude and weather-driven energy output of renewable sources (photovoltaics or wind turbines), as well as the energy demand, there is a need for cost-effective energy storage systems to store power for continuous use.1–4 Green hydrogen (H2), produced from water using renewably-generated electrical power, is a promising solution for the future energy demand.5–10 Hydrogen remains a very important chemical precursor for several petrochemicals refining processes. Approximately 120 million tonnes of H2 is produced annually, which is a ∼30 billion US$ market, and the H2 market is likely to reach 50 billion US$ by 2030.11 Currently, >95% of H2 is produced by the ‘steam–methane reforming’ (SMR) process by burning the methane present in natural gas. However, the SMR requires fossil fuels, operates at high temperature, at 700–1000 °C, and, more importantly, emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the environment.
One of the most promising alternative processes to produce H2 at a commercial scale is water electrolysis. Electrolyzers can be directly coupled with photovoltaics or solar cells. Recently, Toshiba unveiled one of the world's largest facilities for the production of “green” H2 in the town of Namie (Fukushima), Japan.12 Solar panels with an approximately 20 megawatt capacity are installed and connected to a water electrolyzer, producing ∼1200 m3 of H2 per h. This is enough solar-powered hydrogen to fill 560 fuel cell vehicles a day. In renewable-driven water electrolysis, surplus electrical power can be utilized for splitting water molecules into its constituents (H2 and O2). Surface-adsorbed water molecules first oxidize at the anode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place, concurrently generating electrons (e−) and hydrogen ions (H+). The e− flow through an external electrical circuit, while H+ diffuses through the membrane towards the cathode. The other half-cell reaction, termed as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), occurs at the cathode producing H2 gas. The thermodynamic requirement of overall water splitting is 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, in the absence of a suitable electrocatalyst and because of the sluggish kinetics of water splitting (the OER in particular), the energy requirement can reach >3 VRHE. This has a substantial impact on the overall cost and efficiency (electrical-to-hydrogen) of electrolyzers. To address these challenges, commercial electrolyzers are equipped with electrocatalysts. Currently, platinum (Pt) and iridium (Ir) are used as the electrode materials in commercial proton exchange electrolyzers.13 However, the cost of Pt and Ir is high, and these metals are kept under the category of “extremely rare earth metals”.
Extensive research is in progress with the objective of developing low-cost, high performance and durable electrodes, both for the OER and the HER half-cell reactions.13–40 For the OER reaction, an array of potential compositions are examined, and the first-row transition metal-based electrocatalytic compositions, such as Ni, Fe, Co and Mn, have shown promising performance.31–40 In particular, the overpotential requirement for nickel-based electrocatalysts to generate the benchmark current density (10 mA cm−2) is relatively low, in addition to good electrochemical stability at high current density.41 Investigations have further revealed that the OER kinetics of Ni-based electrodes can notably be enhanced by incorporating an Fe moiety.42,43 An improvement in the OER kinetics translates into a reduction in overpotential. The combination of Fe with Ni in the oxide form (NiFe2O4, nickel ferrite) induces synergy between the two chemical species, producing a superior electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.44,45 Li and coworkers demonstrated the preparation of mesoporous NiFe2O4 nanorods for the OER.44 The synthesis was achieved in two steps; preparation of a NiFe-based coordination polymer by a solvothermal method followed by decomposition of the as-prepared polymer at 350 °C in air. Similarly, Chen and coworkers prepared a mesoporous alloy consisting of Ni and Fe using a hard-template two-step technique. The electrode material was investigated for the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).46 The synthesis and OER activity of FeNi alloys composited with NiFe2O4 oxide, confined within a carbonitride outer shell, have been demonstrated.47 In this study, a metal organic framework (MOF) was employed as a hard-template. Growth of an amorphous sulfur-doped NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe film of nickel wire was also demonstrated by electrochemical deposition, and the electrocatalyst film was investigated for the OER.48 In addition to the oxide form, layered double hydroxides of Ni and Fe have also shown promising performance in the OER. For instance, improvement in the OER performance of the NiO electrode was observed concurrent with the phase evolution of Ni1−xFexOOH.49 It was further demonstrated that the surface endowed with Fe species were the primary active sites for the enhancement of the OER performance, as well as more favorable for oxidation reactions (shown by methanol oxidation).50,51 Besides, the surface reactivity was remarkably different from that of the parent metal oxide surfaces.49 Moreover, the Fe species, directly from the solution, tend to adsorb onto the defect sites of the Ni surface and improve the OER kinetics.52
These findings indicate that the surface composition or the active sites present on the surface, rather than in the bulk, are predominant in determining the OER kinetics. In this context, proper engineering of the surface layers can enable benefit to be gained from both the outer surface and underneath layer. The interaction between the outer and inner surface layers, which are chemically different, can impart unique surface attributes. This is possible if the surface is grown in the form of a monolayer. However, due to the fast growth kinetics of oxide layers, producing an oxide monolayer remains highly challenging. In this investigation, we demonstrate single-step growth of a NiFe2O4 monolayer on metallic Ni3Fe. The synthesis is carried out in non-aqueous solvothermal conditions; benzyl alcohol (BA) is utilized as a solvent as well as a strong reducing agent. Polyaniline (PANI) is added into the synthesis reaction matrix, which seems to render anchoring sites for discrete nucleation and growth of fine NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe nanocrystals. Both BA and PANI are prerequisite for the formation of a NiFe2O4 monolayer on Ni3Fe. Growth of the NiFe2O4 monolayer around Ni3Fe is confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), which is supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A probable mechanism for the formation of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI involving BA and PANI is discussed. The performance of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe is evaluated in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, and compared with other as-prepared electrocatalysts such as NiFe2O4, NiO/PANI and Fe2O3/PANI. The NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe exhibited the highest OER activity (low overpotential and high mass activity) as compared to other electrocatalysts under investigation. An attempt is made to assess the inherent kinetics at the catalytic interface of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI by estimating the Tafel slopes and turnover frequency (TOF). In addition to electrochemical stability, other crucial electrode attributes, such as electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), electrochemical impedance and surface charge transfer resistance of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI are estimated.
Experimental
Synthesis of polyaniline (PANI)
Polyaniline (PANI) was prepared by oxidative polymerization. Two solutions were prepared by adding 0.5 mL of aniline and 1.55 g of potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) each into 50 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). Then, the two solutions were mixed together, and the reaction was allowed to take place. Polymerization of aniline or formation of PANI was indicated by the change in color. After 7 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mL of water. Finally, the formed precipitate (PANI) was filtered out from the solution using gravity filtration and dried at 90 °C for 4 h.
Synthesis of electrocatalysts
Pure (NiFe2O4) and hybrid (Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4/PANI) electrocatalysts were prepared under solvothermal conditions using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a solvent. Firstly, 25 mg of as-prepared PANI was dispersed in 20 mL of benzyl alcohol. Then, 77 mg of iron(III) acetylacetonate (Fe(C5H7O2)3) and 76 mg of nickel(II) acetate (Ni(CH3CO2)2) were dissolved into the PANI and BA solution, and the solution was kept under stirring. Upon thorough mixing, the suspension was transferred into a PTFE lined vessel (45 mL, Parr Instrument). The vessel was properly closed, kept in an oven and heated at 180 °C. Similar steps were followed to prepare NiO/PANI and Fe2O3/PANI, but, depending on the targeted composition, only a single chemical precursor – either Ni(CH3CO2)2 or Fe(C5H7O2)3 – was added into the solution. The method to prepare NiFe2O4 was akin to that described above, except that PANI was not added into the solution. After reaction, the solid product was obtained, which was washed with acetone and ethanol repeatedly, and dried under vacuum at 90 °C. The electrodes were prepared by depositing the synthesized electrocatalysts on glassy carbon.
Electrode preparation and activity evaluation
The preparation details of the working electrode and electrocatalytic evaluation are presented in the ESI.† Briefly, a fine aqueous suspension of the electrocatalyst was prepared by sonication, and the desired amount was drop-cast on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The as-prepared electrode served as the working electrode, while a platinum coil and saturated mercury/mercury chloride (Hg/Hg2Cl2) were used as the counter and reference electrode. The OER performance was evaluated in a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell using 1.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The current density was obtained by normalizing the current with the geometric area of the GC electrode, unless stated otherwise.
Computational details
Spin polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) software package.53 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was employed with the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method to describe the interaction between ions and electrons.54 According to experiments, we used a computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model to study the 4e OER process on a single-layered NiFe2O4 (001) surface. For comparison, a composite structure was constructed by placing a Ni21Fe10 cluster on the back side of the NiFe2O4 layer, which was cut from Ni3Fe bulk and kept the structure of (100) facets. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was used to avoid the interaction between neighboring models in periodic boundary conditions. The energy cutoff of the plane wave was 450 eV, and the convergence threshold of force in optimization is −0.03 eV Å−1. The k-point meshing for Brillouin zone sampling was set as 3 × 3 × 1.
Results and discussion
The steps involved in the synthesis of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 are depicted in Fig. 1. In our earlier investigations,55,56 we have shown that benzyl alcohol can serve as a solvent, structure directing agent and strong reducing agent. Benzyl alcohol tends to form complexes with metal halides (MXn, X = Cl, Br, I) or metals coordinated with organic moieties57,58 and hence dissolves the metal precursors. The reaction between the metal precursors (iron acetylacetonate and nickel acetate) and benzyl alcohol is likely to occur in 2 steps. First, the acetylacetonate or the acetate group is exchanged with the benzyl group, forming benzyl alkoxide via elimination of enol (in the case of acetylacetonate) and acetic acid (in the case of acetate). Second, the alkoxy group undergoes an intramolecular reaction leading to the formation of a M–O–M bond, and releasing the corresponding aromatic ether.57,58 Under solvothermal conditions, nucleation and growth takes place resulting in extensive evolution of M–O–M (NiFe2O4) networks. The presence of PANI can affect the reaction, nucleation and growth process of NiFe2O4 in two ways. First, the lone electron pairs of N atoms in PANI can provide efficient anchoring sites for Ni and Fe ions, and the formation of nickel and iron benzyl alkoxides can occur at these specific sites or in the very close vicinity of PANI. Second, because PANI has abundant protonated sites, it is likely to render anchoring sites for alkoxides, formed in the bulk after reaction between benzyl alcohol and metal precursors. Such interactions presumably guide a uniform self-assembly and distribution of benzyl alkoxide across the PANI, which can lead to discrete nucleation and growth of fine nanoparticulates. Formation of smaller and fine NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (≤5 nm) in the presence of PANI is corroborated by microscopic studies. Earlier, it has been demonstrated that benzyl alcohol is capable of reducing elements with low oxidation states (e.g., cobalt, copper, nickel etc.) into their metallic form, whereas those with higher oxidation states transform into nonstoichiometric metal oxides. Formation of the Ni3Fe phase can presumably be correlated to chemical interaction between benzyl alcohol and NiFe2O4 nanoparticle surfaces. A smaller size or higher surface area of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles can provide larger sites for the adsorption of benzyl alcohol and thus effective interaction between NiFe2O4 and benzyl alcohol, leading to reduction or formation of Ni3Fe. On the contrary, in the absence of anchoring sites or PANI, formation of bigger NiFe2O4 nanoparticles is likely because of agglomeration and Ostwald ripening. Growth of highly agglomerated NiFe2O4 nanocrystals with bigger size (between 100 and 300 nm) is substantiated by microscopic studies. Bigger particles with limited surface area presumably lead to less interaction between benzyl alcohol and the NiFe2O4 surfaces, or lower possibility of metal reduction.

The XRD patterns of the materials obtained with and without PANI are compared in Fig. 2a. It is interesting to discern that the presence of PANI has a significant impact on the phase growth of nickel iron oxide. In the absence of PANI, nanoparticles of NiFe2O4 are formed; diffractions centered at 30.0°, 35.6°, 43.4° and 57.3° correspond to the (220), (311), (400) and (511) of NiFe2O4.47,48 Upon addition of PANI in the reaction media, two additional reflections are recorded at 44.1° and 51.0°, which correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of Ni3Fe.47,48 The presence of PANI was not indicated by XRD, presumably due to its amorphous nature. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) was employed to confirm the presence of PANI in the composite. The FTIR spectra of NiFe2O4, bare PANI and NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI are compared in Fig. 2b. The spectrum of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI clearly indicates the presence of PANI. The characteristic vibrations, such as those at 797 (NH2 wagging), 1152 (C–H bending –NQN, QNH+–B and B–NH+–B, Q corresponds to the quinoid ring, while B designates the benzenoid ring), 1240 (C–N), 1310 (C–N–C, stretching), 1490 (N–B–N, benzoid), 1590 (CC stretching), 2895 (C–H stretching), and 3200 cm−1 (C–H and N–H), of PANI are observed in the product obtained after synthesis.59 The analysis confirms that the structure of PANI remains unaltered during solvothermal processing.

The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 is presented in Fig. 3. The survey spectrum (Fig. 3a) of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI shows signals of Ni, Fe, O, C and N. The weak signals of C and N are attributed to PANI, as these signals were not recorded in the case of NiFe2O4 (Fig. 3d). The Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows two peaks at 852.8 and 870.1 eV, which are attributed to the zerovalent nickel (Ni0).60 Two peaks are centered at 855.3 and 873.2 eV, corresponding to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, respectively, with spin-energy separation (ΔE) of 17.9 eV.43 Besides, two peaks were also discerned at 858.2 eV and 879.3 eV, which are attributed to the Ni3+ present on the surface. Since the crystal structure of NiFe2O4 is similar to that of Fe3O4, substitution of Fe2+ and Fe3+ by Ni2+ and Ni3+ is possible, and has been observed in many studies.48,61–65 Similarly, in the case of NiCo2O4, substitution of Co2+ and Co3+ with Ni2+ and Ni3+ can occur.66 In addition, two satellite peaks appeared at 862.2 and 880.8 eV. The Ni 2p spectrum of NiFe2O4 (Fig. 3e) also has peaks at 855.3 and 873.2 eV, suggesting the presence of Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, and 858.2 eV and 879.3 corresponding to Ni3+. However, the peaks attesting to the presence of zerovalent Ni were weak.
 Fig. 3  High resolution XPS of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI (a–c) and NiFe2O4 (d–f). 
All of the recorded signals for Ni are in good agreement with the NiFe2O4 phase observed in previous studies.47,48 In the case of the Fe 2p spectrum of both samples (Fig. 3c and f), two peaks are recorded at 710.9 and 724.1 eV accounting for Fe3+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2, respectively.47,48
Microstructural and morphological features of the electrocatalysts prepared in the presence and absence of PANI were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM/HR-TEM). The features of the sample prepared without PANI are shown in Fig. 4a. As can be seen, the particles are relatively large, between 100 and 300 nm, and tend to agglomerate. The XRD patterns confirmed that these nanoparticles are nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4). In contrast, formation of highly uniform, monodisperse, and small nanoparticles is discerned when PANI was added into the reaction matrix. The FESEM and TEM images giving a broader view of the nanoparticle size and distribution are shown in Fig. 4b–e. The average particle size is determined to be ≤5 nm. These nanoparticles seem to be well-embedded within the PANI matrix (Fig. 4d). A close analysis of the high magnification TEM images reveals the presence of light and dark contrasts. HR-TEM was used to calculate the interplanar distance of these two spots. The d-spacings of the dark (inner) spots, focused on two adjacent nanoparticles, are measured to be 1.8 and 2.1 Å (Fig. 4f). These spacings are in very good agreement with those of Ni3Fe; 1.8 Å corresponds to (200) and 2.1 Å is attributed to (111) reflections of Ni3Fe.47,62 The d-spacing of the thinner or outer layer is determined to be 2.5 Å, which corresponds to the (311) reflection of NiFe2O4.47 The TEM studies compliment the XRD patterns, which indicates the existence of Ni3Fe as well as NiFe2O4 in the sample prepared with PANI. Furthermore, HR-TEM observations suggest the formation of a core–shell-type morphology, in which Ni3Fe is the core and NiFe2O4 is the shell.

On the basis of XRD and microscopic findings, it seems reasonable to infer that the PANI steers the growth of core–shell-type Ni3Fe/NiFe2O4 as NiFe2O4 grew in the absence of PANI. Experimental evidence obtained from XRD, XPS and microscopic analyses provides support for the notion that the nanostructured material obtained in the presence of benzyl alcohol and PANI under solvothermal conditions consists of monolayers of NiFe2O4 encompassing Ni3Fe. In addition, these nanocrystals are homogeneously distributed and embedded within nanosheets of PANI, as the chemical composition remains intact during solvothermal processing.
The electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared electrodes towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte are compared. The OER performance is compared in terms of overpotential (η) required to generate 10 mA cm−2, the recommended current density (normalized to the geometric area of the electrode) to compare η for OER and HER reactions. The linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of the electrocatalysts prepared in the presence and absence of PANI are shown in Fig. 5. For comparison, the polarization curves of NiO and Fe2O3 prepared in the presence of PANI are also included. The electrode comprising NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI exhibits the highest OER performance, followed by NiO/PANI, NiFe2O4, and Fe2O3/PANI. Meanwhile, the respective η10 values of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiO/PANI are measured to be 320 and 400 mV, and NiFe2O4 and Fe2O3/PANI failed to generate 10 mA cm−2. The η10 of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI compares favorably with those reported in the literature (Table S1†). Since the current density normalized to the geometric area of the electrode is more valid for smooth and planar surfaces, the as-prepared nanostructured electrocatalysts are likely to consist of rough surfaces. The mass activities (A g−1 against η) of the as-prepared nanostructured electrocatalysts, therefore, were also obtained. The results are compared in Fig. 5b. The mass-normalized activity is discerned to be NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI > NiO/PANI > NiFe2O4 > Fe2O3/PANI. The performance trend of mass activity remains essentially similar to that obtained by normalizing the current with the geometric area of the electrodes. Both of the results complement each other and confirm the superior performance of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI compared to the other electrocatalysts under investigation. It can be fairly argued that the particle size of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe is notably smaller than that of NiFe2O4, in addition to being dispersed on the PANI support, which can render a high catalytic surface area or dense catalytic sites and add to the OER performance. With this view, the electrochemically active surface area of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 was estimated (discussed later). Unlike geometrical surface area, the electrochemically active surface area corresponds to the real area of the electrode that remains exposed to the electrolyte. The polarization curves, normalized to the electrochemically active surface area, of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 are compared in Fig. 5c. As evident, the performance of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is remarkably higher than that of the NiFe2O4 electrode. The findings clearly suggest that the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode possesses superior inherent catalytic ability to that of NiFe2O4, leading to highly efficient OER.

Chemical synergy operative among Ni3Fe, NiFe2O4 and PANI can induce favorable surface attributes, enabling the electrode to perform better. An attempt has been made to correlate the better activity of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode to the Tafel slope, electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), electrical resistance, charge transport at the interface, number of catalytic sites, and turnover frequency (TOF). Besides, density functional theory calculations were carried out to shed further light on the attributes of the surface and interface formed between NiFe2O4 and Ni3Fe.
The electrocatalyst surface plays a very important role in determining the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. The inherent kinetics of the electrodes under investigation can be fairly estimated by calculating the Tafel slopes. The lower Tafel values imply faster reaction kinetics at the catalytic interface – the slope of the Tafel plot and the charge transfer coefficient are inversely related. Fig. 5d shows the Tafel slopes deduced from the polarization curves recorded under identical experimental conditions with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Furthermore, the voltammograms are manually corrected for iR drop. The slopes for NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI, NiO/PANI, NiFe2O4, and Fe2O3/PANI are determined to be 52.3, 82.5, 86.0, and 108.3 mV dec−1, respectively. The findings suggest that the catalytic interface at NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is capable of promoting the OER kinetics, more efficiently than other electrodes under investigation.
The stability of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode is evaluated by conducting potentiostatic measurement under identical conditions that were applied for LSV measurements. The current–time profile recorded at η = 365 mV for 24 h is shown in Fig. 5e. The result indicates that the current density drops from 20 mA cm−2 to approximately 15 mA cm−1 during the first 10 h, and after that the current production was steady and stable for 24 h. The efficacy of the used electrode, obtained after the chronoamperometry test, was examined by re-polarizing it under identical measurement conditions. The curves of fresh and used electrodes are compared in the inset of Fig. 5e. The curves indicate a negligible loss of electrode performance after continuous operation for 24 h, attesting to the fair stability of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode. In addition to LSV, information about the phase structure of the used electrode was obtained by XRD. The XRD patterns of fresh and used NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI are compared in Fig. S1.† As can be seen, the intensities of the (111) and (200) planes corresponding to Ni3Fe are slightly decreased. In addition, the new patterns with low intensity indicate the formation of NiOOH (JCPDS-00-027-0956) and FeOOH (JCPDS-00-022-0353).
Another electrode feature that can have a significant impact on the performance is the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), the electrode surface which remains in close contact with the electrolyte (H+ in this case). The ECSAs of the as-prepared electrodes were calculated in terms of double layer capacitance (Cdl), which was obtained from CVs recorded in the non-faradic potential region with different scan rate ranges (5–70 mV s−1). The Cdl was calculated by plotting the capacitive current against the scan rate. The CVs and corresponding plots of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 are shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† The linear slopes, which are equivalent to twice the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl), are quantified to be 30 mF cm−2 for NiFe2O4 and 50 mF cm−2 (approximately 1.7 fold higher) for NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI. The better ECSA of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI can presumably be attributed to the smaller particle size of the electrocatalytic component. The ECSA quantification indicates that the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode is endowed with superior features, which translates into better OER performance.
Other predominant features of the electrodes that can dictate the OER performance are bulk electrical conductivity and interfacial charge transport capability. Higher electrical conductivity usually has a benign impact on the electrocatalytic activity. The intrinsic electrical conductivity and surface charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrodes were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Since the collected EIS data gave the best fitting results with the Randle circuit, it was used to fit all the data. The potential-dependent Nyquist plots (real vs. imaginary Z) of NiFe2O4, NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and pure PANI are shown in Fig. 6a–c. As expected, the Rct decreases with increasing η in all cases. The NiFe2O4 electrode showed the lowest Rct at all of the applied η, followed by NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and pure PANI. Despite consisting of metallic Ni3Fe, the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode showed lower electrical conductivity and higher Rct than that of NiFe2O4. This is attributed to PANI, a relatively resistive component, present in the electrode. This notion is corroborated by comparing the electrical conductivity of the three electrodes at 0 mV (Fig. 6d). The resistance of PANI is estimated to be 24 kΩ cm−2, while the respective resistances of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 are 14 and 10 kΩ cm−2. Because of the high resistance of PANI, the overall resistance of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode is high, and the highly resistive component has a negative impact on the charge transport properties of the electrode. The Nyquist plots of the three electrodes recorded at η = 100 mVRHE and η = 400 mVRHE are compared in Fig. 6e and f, respectively. At both potentials, the Rct of the PANI electrode is significantly higher than that of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4. For instance, at η = 400 mVRHE, the Rct of the PANI electrode is measured to be 1.3 kΩ cm−2, while the Rct values of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 electrodes are ∼14 Ω cm−2 and ∼5 Ω cm−2, respectively. These findings corroborate that the presence of PANI in the electrode composition substantially reduces the overall electrical conductivity of the electrode. However, the PANI is favorable for other crucial features of the electrode by guiding the confinement, nucleation and growth of fine nanocrystals endowed with unique chemical composition.

In many studies documented earlier, a comparative assessment of electrocatalyst performance was carried out by calculating the overpotential against a fixed (e.g., 10 mA cm−2) current density – the current density normalized to the geometric area of the electrode. Although a geometric area – normalized current density can be justified in the case of electrode materials having smooth and planar surfaces, surface roughness or porosity and mass of electrocatalysts can produce a catalytically effective surface area that can be significantly different from the geometric area. As a result, the assessment of the intrinsic catalytic ability of electrocatalysts on the basis of geometric area can be elusive. The turnover frequency (TOF), which is defined as the number of reacted molecules per active site per unit time, seems to offer a more fair and reliable comparison of electrocatalyst performance. The value of TOF directly relates to the catalytic ability – higher TOF values imply superior catalytic performance.
The TOF can be estimated using eqn (1): TOF = JA/4NF(1)J (A cm−2) = geometric current density obtained by the LSV measurement in 1.0 M KOH, A = 0.196 cm2 (geometric area of GC electrode), 1/4 denotes that four electrons are consumed to produce one O2 molecule from H2O, F = Faradic constant (96485 C mol−1), and N = the number of active sites (mol).

N indicates the amount of active sites, while the TOF is the ability of the catalytic sites to convert H2O into O2 in molecules per second. The number of active sites was estimated from the CVs, which were recorded at pH 7.0 in a phosphate buffer aqueous electrolyte in the potential window between 1.2 and 1.6 VRHE. The scan rate was fixed at 20 mV s−1. The voltammograms are shown in Fig. 7a. The N should be proportional to the integrated charge over the entire potential range, though it is difficult to assign the peaks to a given redox couple. On the basis of a one electron redox process, the upper limit of the catalytic centers is obtained using eqn (2):22 N = Q/2F(2)where Q = voltammetric charge.
 Fig. 7  Cyclic voltammograms recorded between 1.2 and 1.6 VRHE (a) and TOF vs. η (b). The experiments were conducted in a buffer solution (pH = 7). 
The respective N values of the NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrodes are estimated to be 1.52 × 10−5 and 2.43 × 10−5 mol. The values clearly indicate that the surface of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI is endowed with a greater number of functional sites. The calculated N was then utilized to obtain the TOF – the TOF vs. η profile is plotted in Fig. 7b. At η = 320 mV, the η required to produce the benchmark 10 mA cm−2, the TOF values of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiFe2O4 electrodes are estimated to be 0.27 s−1 and 0.05 s−1, respectively.
To obtain further insights into the superior performance of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI for the OER, density functional theory calculations were carried out. Various potential sites on both NiFe2O4 (001) surfaces with and without Ni3Fe were considered, and the most favorable reaction pathways of the two systems are shown in Fig. 8. On NiFe2O4, lower-valent nickel is likely to be the active center. The potential-determining step is the formation of *OOH from *O, with an energy change of 1.72 eV. After coupling with a bimetallic cluster, electrons transfer from the cluster to the NiFe2O4 surface, making the higher-valent iron more reactive. Bader charge analysis indicates that the alloy cluster possesses a partial charge of −3.16|e|, namely 3.16e− transfer from the bimetal to the nickel ferrite. Although the first oxidation step to *OH on Fe is more difficult than that on nickel, the following steps are all promoted. The barrier of the potential-determining step from *O to *OOH decreases to 1.41 eV. As a result, the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe exhibits improved OER performance.

Conclusions
In summary, single-step and facile growth of a crystalline monolayer of NiFe2O4 encompassing metallic Ni3Fe was demonstrated. The nanocrystals of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe were homogeneously embedded within a polyaniline (PANI) matrix. Benzyl alcohol (BA) was utilized as a solvent as well as a strong reducing agent, while PANI presumably rendered anchoring sites for discrete nucleation and growth of fine NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe nanocrystals. Both benzyl alcohol and PANI are prerequisites to obtain the desired composition and morphology. The unique morphological and compositional configuration imparted superior attributes to the electrocatalyst surface; the NiFe2O4 monolayer afforded high catalytic ability, while Ni3Fe rendered a high electroactive surface area and faster charge transport. The as-prepared NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI exhibited significantly higher OER performance; the respective η10 values of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI and NiO/PANI were measured to be 320 and 400 mV, while NiFe2O4 and Fe2O3/PANI failed to produce 10 mA cm−2. Estimation of the Tafel slopes suggested that the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode was endowed with greater interfacial potential, and capable of promoting the OER kinetics much faster than NiO/PANI, NiFe2O4 and Fe2O3/PANI. Despite having lower electrical conductivity than NiFe2O4, caused by PANI, the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI electrode exhibited higher OER performance. The surface of the NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI was enriched with dense catalytic centers and superior catalytic ability per active site per unit time – the TOF of NiFe2O4/Ni3Fe/PANI was 5.4 fold higher than that of NiFe2O4 – in addition to higher electrochemically active surface area. Density functional theory calculations supported the notion of a fine interface operative between NiFe2O4 and Ni3Fe, which facilitates the electron transfer reaction from Ni3Fe to NiFe2O4 and reduces the barrier of the potential-determining step (*O to *OOH). These findings provide a new synthesis protocol that can presumably be pursued to develop crystalline monolayers of other similar active compositions for electrochemical energy conversion devices.
