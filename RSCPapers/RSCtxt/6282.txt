1. Introduction
The recent fast-paced developments in the social economy and industrialization have given rise to the problems of environmental pollution and energy shortage. The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) is mainly caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, resulting in a continuous rise in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.1–3 As a major greenhouse gas, CO2 can cause global warming, leading to disastrous climatic conditions.4 Hence, decreasing the emission of CO2 and rationally utilizing CO2 have become formidable and important research subjects around the world. It is well known that CO2 is a very stable molecule with a nonpolar covalent bond.5–11 The dissociation energy of CO bond in the CO2 molecule is ∼750 kJ mol−1, which is higher than C–H (∼430 kJ mol−1) and C–C (∼336 kJ mol−1) bonds.12 CO2 has high thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness; further, it has very low solubility in water (∼30 mM under room temperature and 1 atm).13–15 Therefore, the activation and conversion of CO2 pose a big challenge.
In the natural environment, green plants absorb solar energy and use CO2 and H2O as raw materials to manufacture carbohydrates with the simultaneous release of oxygen.16–20 Inspired by this natural process, artificial photosynthesis has become a research hotspot, showing rapid developments. In the early stages of this research paradigm, Fujishima and Honda reported certain semiconductor photocatalysts dispersed in water for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.21 In the past decade, many photocatalysts, e.g., TiO2,22–26 g-C3N4,27–31 ZnIn2S4,32–35 Bi2WO6,36–41 graphene (GR),42–46 CdS,47–50 SrNb2O6,51 and ZnO,52–54 have been investigated for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Among these photocatalysts, TiO2 is the most widely used due to its abundance, chemical stability, low cost, and resistance toward corrosion.55,56 With a wide bandgap of ∼3.2 eV, TiO2 can only absorb UV light, which represents 3–5% of the entire sunlight spectrum; therefore, it significantly limits its utilization of solar light.57 Many strategies have been used for improving its activity and extending its light absorption in the visible light region.58–60 Wang et al. firstly reported that adding MgO or polyaniline onto Pt–TiO2 could improve the production of CH4 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.61–63 In another study, Wang et al. also reported the core–shell-structured Pt@Cu2O/TiO2 to produce CH4 and CO for CO2 reduction.64
The well-defined heterojunction between two semiconductors with matching electronic band structures can significantly enhance the separation of photogenerated electrons (e−) and holes (h+), thereby considerably enhancing the photocatalytic performance.65–70. Yu et al. first synthesized a novel Ag2O/Ag2CO3-heterostructured photocatalyst via a one-step phase transformation method. The photocatalytic activity for decomposing methyl orange was 68 and 30 times higher than that of pure Ag2CO3 and Ag2O, respectively.71 Recent studies have found that the unique role of a heterojunction can effectively promote the activity during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels.72–77
In this review, we will focus on the fundamental principles involved in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and highlight the recent advances in TiO2-based heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Moreover, the reaction mode and some typical photoreactors, e.g., slurry photoreactor, optical-fiber photoreactor, monolith photoreactor, and optofluidic microreactor, are further presented and analyzed. Future prospects on the opportunities, research directions, and remaining challenges for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 will be addressed in the last section. We believe this review can provide some useful guidelines for the further development of highly active heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
2. Fundamental understanding for photocatalytic reduction of CO2
2.1 Thermodynamic analysis
Due to its very stable and low energy grade, the chemical transformation of CO2 is highly unfavorable in thermodynamics.78–80 The possible reactions that can occur in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in an aqueous medium are listed in Table 1.81,82 The enthalpy change (ΔH) of all the reactions are highly positive, indicating that the reactions are endothermic and it becomes difficult for the corresponding reactions to occur at ambient temperatures. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is also highly positive and a spontaneous reaction cannot occur. Moreover, it is evident that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 can store more energy than splitting water. Therefore, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels requires a powerful catalyst and a large energy input, which is a big challenge in CO2 reduction.

Table 2 lists the thermodynamic potentials of different products for CO2 reduction with the thermodynamic potentials vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH = 7 in an aqueous solution at 25 °C and 1 atm.83–86 It clearly shows that the thermodynamic potential for the reduction of CO2 to CO2− radicals is −1.9 V by one electron, indicating that the reaction is highly unfavorable. Owing to the structural differences between linear CO2 and bent CO2− radicals, a large kinetic “overvoltage” for one electron reduction is required (in eqn (1)).87 It is evident that the other reactions with multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps have lower standard potentials than one electron reduction; therefore, the other reactions are more favorable.88 Moreover, the thermodynamic potential of CO2 to CH4 is more thermodynamically feasible than that required to reduce H+ to H2. Therefore, the principle for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 toward fuels is relatively complex, and we assume that this process involves multiple proton-coupled electron transfers instead of a single electron transfer.89 With the exception of the listed thermodynamic considerations, we also need to consider the kinetic challenges in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.90 From the perspective of kinetics, H2 formation from the reduction of H2O is more favorable, which is a strong competing reaction when compared with CO2 reduction. We often use selectivity (ratio of the number of electrons reacting with CO2 reduction to the number of all the reaction electrons) to estimate the efficiency of CO2 reduction. Therefore, the selectivity for CO2 reduction is low.

2.2 Reaction mechanism
It is well known that the energy band of a semiconductor is divided into conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB). In order to achieve the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, a good photocatalyst should have suitable band positions and bandgap energy (Eg). Namely, the position of CB should be higher or more negative than the redox potential for CO2 reduction, whereas the VB should be lower or more positive than the oxidation potential of H2O to O2,91,92 and the absorbed light energy (hν) should be greater than or equal to Eg.93,94Fig. 1 shows the band positions of some typical semiconductors, such as TiO2, Cu2O, ZnO, CdS, and Bi2WO6.95–101

The typical processes for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are described in Fig. 2.101,102 The process involves the following three main steps. First, if hν is greater than or equal to Eg under light irradiation, e− and h+ can be produced. Considering the visible light utilization in solar energy, we should develop visible light response photocatalysts that have narrow bandgap energies (Eg < 3.0 eV or λ > 415 nm).103,104 Second, e− and h+ migrate toward the surface of the photocatalyst; at the same time, most e− and h+ may get consumed through the recombination in the surface and bulk. In order to obtain high overall efficiency, it is necessary to quickly transfer the e−/h+ pairs to the surface and suppress the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. Third, after migrating toward the surface of the photocatalyst, e− and h+ are used for the reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. Here, e− reacts with CO2 and H+ to produce CO and hydrocarbon fuels or only with H+ to produce H2. Further, h+ reacts with H2O to produce O2, thereby accelerating H2O oxidation and improving the separation of e−/h+ pairs to further enhance the activity. Increasing the activity of CO2 reduction is a formidable challenge. The recombination of e−/h+ pairs is the determinant factor for photocatalytic activity.105–109 Therefore, in order to obtain high activity for CO2 reduction, we should formulate certain effective strategies, such as using a heterojunction to increase the charge transfer and restrain the recombination of e−/h+ pairs.110–115

3. Design and fabrication of a photoreactor
High photocatalytic activity is not only dependent on the catalyst but also on the photoreactor.116 The reaction modes (solid–liquid and solid–vapor interfaces) and operation modes (batch, semi-batch, and continuous) are important parameters in the design and fabrication of a photoreactor. It is noteworthy that the operation parameters, e.g., temperature, pressure, light source, and light intensity, play important roles in yielding high photocatalytic performances.
3.1 Reaction mode
The solid–liquid and solid–vapor interfaces are the two typical reaction modes for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The schematic of two typical reaction modes are shown in Fig. 3. Fujishima and Honda conducted the pioneering work in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 at the solid–liquid interface,21 and many researchers have since used this reaction mode.117 The solid–liquid interface reaction mode is very simple, where the catalyst is dispersed in a solution. However, the solubility of CO2 in water is very low, resulting in low photocatalytic activity. In order to overcome this issue, an alkaline medium has been used in a solution to increase the adsorption of CO2. Nonetheless, CO32− and HCO3− can be formed in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, CO32− and HCO3− are difficult to reduce as compared to CO2.118 The solid–vapor interface reaction mode can circumvent these problems.119 Wang et al. compared the solid–liquid interface and solid–vapor interface reaction mode of 0.5 wt% Pt–TiO2 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.61,101 It was interesting to find that the CH4 formation rate was 5.2 μmol g−1 h−1 in the solid–vapor interface, which was 3.7 times higher than that of the solid–liquid interface. However, the H2 formation rate in the solid–vapor interface was lower than that of the solid–liquid interface. In the solid–vapor interface, the catalyst was exposed in a CO2 atmosphere to avoid H2 formation. Therefore, the selectivity for CO2 reduction was much higher in the solid–vapor interface, which was more suitable for CO2 reduction in the presence of H2O.

3.2 A typical photoreactor

3.2.1 Slurry photoreactor. 
In Fig. 4a, a slurry photoreactor with a suspended catalyst is shown, which has been widely used in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.120 It has some advantages, such as simple construction, high amount of catalyst, and low cost. Furthermore, it is possible to design and fabricate a large-capacity photoreactor. However, catalyst separation and circulation are drawbacks. Bai et al. first reported Mo-doped titanate nanotube (TNT) photocatalysts in a monoethanolamine solution with a slurry batch photoreactor under UVA (8 W, 63 mW cm−2) irradiation for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH4 and CO.121 It was clearly found that the molybdenum structure and oxygen vacancies played important roles in enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Maroto-Valer et al. fabricated 1 wt% Pd/0.01 wt% Rh–TiO2 in a slurry batch annular reactor system under UVA irradiation.122 The obtained quantum efficiency was about 0.002% and CH4 formation rate was 0.03 μmol g−1 h−1. In order to realize the separation of H2 and O2, Wu et al. designed a slurry reactor with two separate components for O2 and H2 evolution through a Nafion membrane (Fig. 4b).123 Pt/CuAlGaO4 or Pt/SrTiO3:Rh served as the catalyst in CO2 reduction to produce CO, and WO3 was used as the oxidation catalyst for the oxidation of H2O to produce O2. This dual-photocatalyst system yielded high quantum efficiency (0.0051%), which was 2.7 times higher than that of a single-photocatalyst system (0.0019%).

3.2.2 Optical-fiber photoreactor. 
A fixed-bed photoreactor can overcome the disadvantages of catalyst separation and circulation encountered in a slurry photoreactor. The catalysts are often coated onto the fixed supports, such as plates, beads, fibers, and the monolith.5 The fibers can be used as a medium to uniformly deliver light onto the surface of the catalyst. In the optical-fiber photoreactor, the catalyst coated onto the fibers can direct light to enter along the fiber.120Fig. 5a shows the photograph of an optical-fiber photoreactor.124 It has certain advantages such as high surface area and light utilization efficiency; however, it has a comparatively low surface area and low reactor volume with respect to the photocatalysis process. The NiO/InTaO4 catalyst was prepared via the sol–gel method and then coated onto optical fibers and calcined to obtain a uniform layer.124 The quantum efficiency of the optical-fiber reactor was 0.063%, which was much higher than that of the aqueous-phase reactor (0.0045%). In a similar work, Wu et al. also prepared Cu/TiO2 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in an optical-fiber photoreactor, which showed the maximum CH3OH formation rate (0.45 μmol g−1 h−1) under 365 nm wavelength irradiation.125 Wu et al. also reported metal-loaded TiO2 films coated onto fibers in an optical-fiber photoreactor.126 It was found that the maximum quantum efficiency was obtained with 1.2% Cu under 365 nm UV irradiation. In a further study, Wu et al. also researched the Cu–Fe/TiO2 coated onto fibers; Fe and Cu–TiO2 simultaneously promoted C2H4 formation and the quantum yield was about 0.024%.127 A novel optical-fiber monolith reactor with multiple inverse lights for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce CH3OH was reported by Yang et al.128 The maximum quantum efficiency was 0.0177%, which was higher than the internally illuminated monolith.

3.2.3 Monolith photoreactor. 
The monolith photoreactor has high surface area, low pressure drop, and ease in scale-up. The monolith is made up of many internal channels because of which it has a large surface area.129 The catalyst is coated onto the walls of the channels. However, the light cannot efficiently penetrate through the channels because of the opacity of the honeycomb substrate; therefore, the length of the monolith reactor is limited. Fig. 5b shows the photograph of a monolith photoreactor.130 Wu et al. reported that NiO/InTaO4 was coated onto a precoated SiO2 sublayer on the internal channels of the monolith for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in a monolith photoreactor.130 The maximum CH3OH formation rate was 0.16 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the quantum efficiency of the monolith photoreactor was 0.012%, which was much higher than that of the optical-fiber reactor. Amin et al. reported montmorillonite (MMT)/TiO2 for CO2 reduction in a monolith photoreactor.131 It exhibited a high CH4 formation rate (139 μmol g−1 h−1) when compared with a cell-type photoreactor (43 μmol g−1 h−1) owing to the high illuminated surface area and light utilization. Tahir et al. developed a Cu- and N-doped TiO2 nanocatalyst coated onto honeycomb monoliths for CO2 reduction in a monolith photoreactor.132 It was noteworthy that Cu and N could increase the activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction to yield CO.


3.2.4 Optofluidic microreactor. 
An optofluidic microreactor has a precise control of flow, large surface area, enhanced mass transfer, and uniform light distribution; however, there exists a severe problem of limited throughput for practical applications. Fig. 6a and b show the schematic and photograph of an optofluidic planar microreactor, respectively.133 Zhu et al. used an optofluidic planar microreactor to enhance the photocatalytic activity of a TiO2 film in an alkaline environment.133 The increase in the light intensity and NaOH concentration could increase the CH3OH yields, and the increase in the liquid flow and catalyst loading initially improved and then decreased for the CH3OH yields. In a similar study, Cheng et al. reported Cu–TiO2 nanorods for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in an optofluidic planar microreactor.134 It had the maximum CH3OH and CH3CH2OH yields with a flow rate of 2 mL min−1. Fig. 6c and d show the schematic and photograph of an optofluidic membrane microreactor.135 An optofluid with the membrane reactor technology for CO2 reduction of TiO2/carbon paper was reported by Chen et al.135 The CH3OH yield was much higher than those obtained from other types of photoreactors.

4. Design and fabrication of TiO2-based heterojunction photocatalysts
4.1 Coupling with other semiconductors
With regard to bare semiconductor photocatalysts, many strategies have been used to enhance their photocatalytic performance. A well-defined heterojunction structure between two semiconductors can accelerate the charge separation and suppress the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. A p–n heterojunction can be formed when n-type TiO2 couples with some appropriate p-type semiconductor with matching electronic band structures. Fig. 7a shows the schematic diagram of the energy band structure and e−/h+ pair separation of a p–n heterojunction.136 When n-type TiO2 contacts with a p-type semiconductor, the diffusion of e− and h+ can form a space charge region at the interface. The difference in the electric potential can create a strong electric field to accelerate the charge separation of e−/h+ pairs. Except for p–n heterojunctions, other non-p–n heterojunctions exist. The schematic diagram of the energy band structure and e−/h+ pair separation of the non-p–n heterojunction are shown in Fig. 7b. Semiconductor A (SA) and semiconductor B (SB) are tightly bonded to form a heterojunction. Owing to the staggered alignment of the energy levels, e− can transfer from the CB of SA to the CB of SB, whereas h+ transfers from the VB of SB to the VB of SA under light irradiation. The non-p–n heterojunction is also suitable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels, and TiO2 is often used to fabricate such heterojunctions.
 Fig. 7  Schematic diagram showing the energy band structure and e−/h+ pair separation in p–n (a) and non-p–n (b) heterojunctions. Reproduced from ref. 136 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Recently, another Z-scheme heterojunction system has aroused considerable interest.137 It is typically made up of two semiconductors with staggered alignment of band structures. However, the CB and VB of the two semiconductors are only able to initiate reduction or oxidation of half of the reaction and unable to individually sustain the overall reactions. Fig. 8a shows the indirect Z-scheme heterojunction structure; e− in the CB of semiconductor 1 recombines with h+ in the VB of semiconductor 2; e− in the CB of semiconductor 2 and h+ in the VB of semiconductor 1 are utilized for the reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively.138,139 Nevertheless, this structure can decrease the amount of e− and h+ available for the reactions and lead to low photocatalytic activity. The all-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunction structure can circumvent these problems. Fig. 8b and c show that a conductor serves as the electron mediator and many defects exist at the solid–solid interface. Recently, a novel double Zn3(VO4)2/Zn2V2O7/ZnO Z-scheme ternary vanadate heterojunction has been synthesized by Yu et al., which exhibited high photocatalytic activity due to fast interfacial charge transfer and wider light response.140Table 3 summarizes and compares the typical TiO2–semiconductor heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

4.1.1 p–n heterojunction. 
When TiO2 and some p-type semiconductor are in contact, a strong electric field can be created. The produced electric field can accelerate charge separation and suppress the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. It is well known that copper compounds are very promising materials for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, and they are usually used to fabricate such p–n heterojunctions. Furthermore, copper compounds can improve the selectivity for CO2 reduction.141
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is a p-type semiconductor with a narrow direct bandgap (∼2.0 eV), which is a promising material for CO2 reduction.142–144 Ye et al. synthesized a porous-structured Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction via a two-step process as follows.145 First, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) was used as the Ti precursor and heated with microwave assistance at 200 °C for 40 min; then, porous TiO2 was synthesized and dispersed into ethanol. Second, copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2) was used as the Cu precursor and added into TiO2 dispersions and treated with a microwave-solvothermal process at 200 °C for 40 min. Then, a porous Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction was obtained. The BET surface area of Cu2O/TiO2 (206.3 m2 g−1) was 4.04 and 1.04 times higher than that of P25 (51.1 m2 g−1) and porous TiO2 (198.2 m2 g−1), respectively. Moreover, the amounts of adsorbed CO2 of Cu2O/TiO2 (0.27 mL g−1) was much higher than that of P25 (0.05 mL g−1) and porous TiO2 (0.12 mL g−1). The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under UV-vis light irradiation (λ > 300 nm). It was found that the highest CH4 formation rate could be achieved by the Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction catalyst. Fig. 9 shows the schematic of the charge transfer in the Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction. The bandgaps of TiO2 and Cu2O were 3.2 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Under light irradiation, e− could transfer from the CB of Cu2O to the CB of TiO2, whereas h+ could transfer from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of Cu2O, resulting in promoted separation efficiency of the photogenerated e− and h+. This superior performance was attributed to the heterojunction with high separation efficiency of e−/h+ pairs, as well as high CO2 adsorption and more active reaction sites in the porous structure.

Morphology is expected to play a unique role in the photocatalytic performance. In a previous study, He et al. first fabricated Cu2O hollow nanospheres by a soft-template method and then loaded them onto TiO2 through the in situ hydrolysis of Ti(OBu)4 under ultrasonic conditions.146Fig. 10 shows the SEM and TEM images of Cu2O and Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction. The diameter of Cu2O hollow nanospheres was about 80–120 nm, and the Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction also retained the same hollow spheres and diameter. In this case, the highest CH4 formation rate was obtained by the Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction under visible light irradiation. Cu2O in contact with TiO2 could form a p–n heterojunction to yield the efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers as well as stability. In another study, Wu et al. reported Cu dispersion over Cu2O/TiO2 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using a stirred batch annular reactor under UVA irradiation.147 A volcano tendency was evident in the CH4 yield loading with moderate Cu amounts. It was found that the largest CH4 yield could be obtained with Cu loading amount of 0.03%. Recently, a novel example of multicomponent pillared structures of Cu2O-decorated TiO2-pillared tetratitanate was synthesized by Nogueira et al.148 The BET surface area of TiO2/Ti4O9/Cu2O (171 m2 g−1) was 6.84 and 1.18 times higher than that of K2Ti4O9 (25 m2 g−1) and TiO2/Ti4O9 (145 m2 g−1), respectively. TiO2/Ti4O9/Cu2O exhibited the maximum CH3OH formation rate, which was attributed to the synergistic effect induced by the pillaring K2Ti4O9 with TiO2 pillars and the loading of the Cu2O cocatalyst; this yielded the heterojunction structure. These three components could generate e− and h+ under light irradiation. However, Cu2O was the main photocatalyst to generate e− and h+ owing to its narrowest bandgap. Further, e− in the CB of TiO2 could transfer to the CB of H2Ti4O9, which then coupled with h+ in the VB of Cu2O. Furthermore, e− in the CB of Cu2O reacted with the surface-adsorbed CO2 and H+ to produce CH3OH and h+ in the VB of TiO2 reacted with H2O to produce O2 and H+. The electric field at the heterojunction interfaces could accelerate the transfer of e−/h+ pairs and the onset of the absorption band of the semiconductor exhibited a red-shift to improve the CH3OH formation rate.

Ji et al. used the electrodeposition method to deposit Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) onto TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) to fabricate the Cu2O/TiO2 NT heterostructure.149Fig. 11a and b show the SEM images of the TiO2 NTs. The average inner diameter and length of TiO2 NTs were about 80 nm and 800 nm, respectively. Fig. 11c and d show the top and cross-sectional views of the Cu2O/TiO2 NT heterostructure. Cu2O NPs with a polyhedral shape were formed on the surface of the TiO2 NTs. Moreover, the Cu2O NPs were wrapped around the inner and outer walls of the TiO2 NTs. The Cu2O/TiO2 NTs exhibited stronger adsorption in the UV and visible light regions than that of TiO2 NTs. The Cu2O/TiO2 NTs exhibited good photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH3OH, whereas the TiO2 NTs were nearly inactive. The band energy values and charge carrier transfers of Cu2O/TiO2 NTs under visible light and UV-vis light irradiation are shown in Fig. 11e and f, respectively. It is well known that TiO2 is a UV response semiconductor; therefore, only e− can be generated in the CB of Cu2O under visible light irradiation, which then transfers to the CB of TiO2. However, both Cu2O and TiO2 can generate e− under UV-vis light irradiation. Further, e− in the CB of Cu2O can transfer to the CB of TiO2, whereas h+ in the VB of TiO2 can transfer to the VB of Cu2O; thereafter, e− and h+ are effectively separated and the charge recombination process is suppressed. Due to the presence of Cu2O/TiO2 NT heterostructures, the photocatalytic activity was improved. In another report, Yu et al. fabricated the octahedral Cu2O NPs deposited onto TiO2 NTs by an electrochemical deposition method.150 The largest CH4 production rate was 2 ppm h−1 under visible light irradiation with the deposition time for 30 min. The TiO2 NTs structure might offer high surface area and additional active sites. Furthermore, the Cu2O NPs increased light absorption and enhanced the selectivity for CO2 reduction into hydrocarbon products.

Cupric oxide (CuO) is a p-type semiconductor with a narrow direct bandgap, which is also a promising material for CO2 reduction.151–153 Previous studies have clarified that CuO is a good semiconductor to form a heterojunction due to its ability to be used as an electron trap. When CuO couples with TiO2, an electric field is created at the interface. Therefore, the charge separation of e− and h+ is improved. Razali et al. reported CuO loaded onto TiO2 NTs by a facile hydrothermal method.154 The diameter and length of TiO2 NTs with a fibrous-like structure were about 10 nm and several hundreds of nanometers, respectively. However, when CuO was loaded onto the TiO2 NT, the morphology exhibited a considerable change, where they were tied together at the tip and exhibited a bundled, cobweb-like appearance. In the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, the CuO/TiO2 NT exhibited the highest CO2 conversion (∼100% for 2.5 h), which was higher than other metal oxide composites, such as ZnS/ZnO (45%) and immobilized MPc/ZnO (23%).155,156 The CuO/TiO2 NT heterojunction could improve the effective separation of e−/h+ pairs, resulting in improved activity. In another study, Xin et al. reported the CuO–TiO2 photocatalyst for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into HCOOCH3 in the presence of CH3OH, whereas CH3OH was used as a sacrificial reagent to react with h+.157 The interfacial structure between CuO and TiO2 was characterized by HRTEM, and the HRTEM image is shown in Fig. 12a. The typical monoclinic CuO {110} and anatase TiO2 {101} planes with the characteristic lattice spacing of 0.275 nm and 0.35 nm were observed, respectively. A surface-phase heterojunction existed between CuO and TiO2, and the band position of CuO and TiO2 is shown in Fig. 12b. This heterojunction can improve charge migration and accelerate the separation of e−/h+ pairs, enhancing the photocatalytic performance.

A series of Cu (Cu0, CuI, CuII)/TiO2 photocatalysts via an improved impregnation method through the reduction–oxidation steps was fabricated by Gunlazuardi et al.158 The 3 wt% CuO/TiO2 exhibited the highest CH3OH yield (∼442.5 μmol g−1 h−1), which was 3.28, 2.28, and 1.97 times higher than TiO2 (134.8 μmol g−1 h−1), 3 wt% Cu/TiO2 (194 μmol g−1 h−1), and 3 wt% Cu2O/TiO2 (224.3 μmol g−1 h−1), respectively. It was clearly indicated that CuO was the main dopant species that enhanced the CH3OH yield. In a further study, Wilkinson et al. also reported CuO loaded onto TiO2 hollow microspheres by a one-pot template-free strategy.159 Further, it exhibited a higher CH4 formation rate than commercial Degussa P25 due to its large surface area, which contributed toward the adsorption of CO2 and offered a large number of active sites.
In et al. synthesized hybrid CuxO–TiO2 (x = 1, 2) mesoporous heterojunction photocatalysts by two steps, and the synthesis process is shown in Fig. 13a.160 Initially, hybrid mesoporous CuxO/TiO2 heterojunctions for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels were reported. CT07 (TiCl4 was 0.7 mL mixed with the dispersion liquid of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites) had a higher CH4 formation rate (221.63 ppm g−1 h−1) than CuO and TiO2 due to the enhanced light absorption and rapid charge separation. The charge transfer of CuxO–TiO2 heterojunction is shown in Fig. 13b. Here, e− could transfer from the CB of CuxO to TiO2 and react with CO2 to produce CH4. Schaak et al. reported novel hollow CuO nanocubes loaded over titanium oxynitride (TiO2−xNx) by a multi-template strategy (Fig. 13c).161Fig. 13d shows the FESEM images of the CuO–TiO2−xNx hollow nanocubes. N doped onto TiO2 could extend the light absorption capability into the visible light region. The photocurrent density of a thin film of CuO–TiO2−xNx under AM 1.5G irradiation could confirm the formed p–n heterojunction by electrochemical evidence. The CuO–TiO2−xNx hollow nanocubes exhibited a higher CH4 production rate (41.3 ppm g−1 h−1) than Degussa P25 (16.2 ppm g−1 h−1).

In a previous work, GaP was used for the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 in 1978. However, it is rarely used as a photocatalyst owing to the low oxidizing power of its VB.162 Here, e− in the CB can convert CO2 into CH4, but h+ in the VB is unable to oxidize H2O; therefore, bare GaP cannot induce the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. GaP coupled with TiO2 that forms a p–n heterojunction for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was fabricated by Marcì et al. for the first time.163 GaP/TiO2 composites could effectively exhibit both the reduction of CO2 and oxidation of H2O, and the p–n heterojunction could promote the separation of e−/h+ pairs. The highest photocatalytic performance was obtained with 10 wt% GaP, which was ascribed to the band structures and charge transfer between GaP and TiO2.


4.1.2 Non-p–n heterojunction. 
Non-p–n heterojunction is another type of heterojunction. Owing to the staggered alignment of the energy levels, non-p–n heterojunction structures have been already used for promoting the performance of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels.
In previous studies, sulfide semiconductors have received considerable attention. Furthermore, many sulfides (e.g., CdS, PbS) have a narrow bandgap, where the onset of absorption begins in the visible light or even infrared region. However, heavy metal ions, e.g., Pb(II), Hg(II), Cr(VI), and Cd(II), exhibit obvious non-biodegradation and bioaccumulation and cannot easily degrade into cleaner products, which cause severe water pollution and induce serious threats to living organisms.164–167 Moreover, bare sulfide semiconductors exhibit photocorrosion. Recent studies have confirmed that sulfide semiconductors are promising materials for the photosensitization of TiO2 in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.168 Coupling with TiO2 to form a heterojunction can both overcome the photocorrosion of sulfide semiconductors and improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Yin et al. synthesized the CdS/TiO2 heterojunction via two-step hydrothermal methods, and its synthesis process is shown in Fig. 14a.169Fig. 14b and c show the TEM images of TiO2 nanosheets and CdS/TiO2 heterojunction composites. The sizes of the TiO2 nanosheet were about 50–60 nm. The HRTEM image of the CdS/TiO2 heterojunction composite is shown in Fig. 14d, where the typical crystallized cubic CdS {002} and anatase TiO2 {010} planes with the characteristic lattice spacing of 0.334 nm and 0.378 nm, respectively, were observed.170 The CdS NPs were dispersed on the surface and edge of the TiO2 nanosheet, and the interface could form a non-p–n heterojunction. Cyclohexanol was used as the solvent and reductant because the solubility of CO2 in cyclohexanol was much higher than that in water at room temperature. With the optimum molar ratio of TiO2 to CdS (8:1), it exhibited the maximum cyclohexyl formate (CF) yield. The band energy values and charge carrier transfer of CdS/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 14e. The high separation and transfer of e−/h+ pairs in this heterojunction were crucial for its high photocatalytic activity.

Reproduced from ref. 169 with permission from Elsevier. 
A similar finding about CdS/TiO2 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was reported by Fatemi et al.171 Here, 45% CdS/TiO2 exhibited the maximum CO and CH4 formation rates under both UV-vis and visible light irradiations. In another work, Li et al. reported the CdS or Bi2S3 loaded onto TiO2 NTs via a direct precipitation method.172 The CH3OH yields of CdS/TiO2 and Bi2S3/TiO2 were about 159.5 and 224.6 μmol L−1, respectively, which were higher than those of P25 (91 μmol L−1) and TiO2 NTs (102.5 μmol L−1). The loaded CdS or Bi2S3 could improve the visible light absorption and photocatalytic activity. The different sizes of PbS quantum dots (QDs) loaded onto TiO2 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 was reported by Wang et al.173 It was interesting to note that 4 nm PbS-QD-sensitized TiO2 yielded a higher CO2 conversion rate than the 3 and 5 nm counterparts because of the synergetic effects of good light absorption and high charge separation properties. In particular, the decreased activity with larger particles was attributable to the smaller surface areas and longer electron migration paths, whereas the decreased activity with smaller particles was associated with changes in the optical and electronic properties.
Zhao et al. synthesized CeO2 loaded onto 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) TiO2via the gas bubbling-assisted membrane precipitation (GBMP) method.174 The SEM images of 3DOM TiO2 and CeO2/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 15a and b, respectively. From Fig. 15a, it is evident that 3DOM TiO2 had periodic voids, where the average diameter and wall thickness were about 310 ± 10 nm and 40 ± 5 nm, respectively. After the loading of CeO2, the morphology did not obviously change. The result of UV-vis DRS indicated that 3DOM CeO2/TiO2 had a good photoresponse from the UV to the visible light region. 3DOM CeO2/TiO2 possessed high photocatalytic activity. The mechanism for the enhanced activity of 3DOM CeO2/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 15c. In a similar study by Wang et al., the mesoporous CeO2/TiO2 photocatalyst with a 2D hexagonal structure was synthesized via a nanocasting method.175 Its photocatalytic activity was much higher than that of commercial P25.

When compared with sulfides, many oxides do not undergo photooxidation under light irradiation and have been widely used in photocatalytic reduction and oxidation processes. For example, zinc oxide (ZnO) is an n-type semiconductor with a direct bandgap (∼3.3 eV), and it is usually used in photocatalytic oxidation processes.176 ZnO hybrid photocatalysts have aroused considerable attention due to its high effective separation of e−/h+ pairs. Ye et al. synthesized TiO2/ZnO mesoporous “French fries” (MFFs) hybrid photocatalyst via a facile furfural alcohol-derived polymerization–oxidation (FAPO) method.177 The CH4 formation rate over TiO2/ZnO MFFs was 55 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 5.9 times higher than that of commercial P25 (9.3 μmol g−1 h−1). In another work, Wu et al. reported V and W doped onto TiO2 and then coated onto a honeycomb support.178 After doping with V and W, the visible light absorption and charge separation improved. V2O5 and TiO2 could form a heterojunction and doping W6+ could trap e− and react with CO2 and H2O to yield solar fuels. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity was improved.
FeTiO3/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized by Ling et al.179 The highest CH3OH yield of 10% FeTiO3/TiO2 was 0.462 μmol g−1 h−1 and 0.432 μmol g−1 h−1 under UV-vis and visible light irradiations, respectively. Due to the unique band structure and heterojunction over FeTiO3/TiO2, the CH3OH yield was obviously improved. Ye et al. reported SrTiO3 (STO) loaded onto TiO2 NT arrays (TNA) via a facile hydrothermal method and then Au–Cu bimetallic alloys were loaded on the STO/TNA via the microwave-assisted solvothermal route.180 The Au3Cu@STO/TNA exhibited good photocatalytic activity for the generation of CO and CH4 under UV-vis light irradiation. Owing to the alloying effect, the Au–Cu alloy yielded higher activity than that of pure Au and Cu. STO and TiO2 could form a heterojunction to facilitate photogenerated carrier separation.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a moderate bandgap energy (∼2.7–2.8 eV) has aroused considerable attention for photocatalytic applications in the last couple of years. However, its photocatalytic activity is very low because of the high recombination of charge carriers. Various methods, such as using a heterojunction, have been investigated to enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Reli et al. synthesized TiO2/g-C3N4via the simple mechanical mixing of g-C3N4 with TiO2.181 Further, (0.3/1) TiO2/g-C3N4 showed good photocatalytic activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce CH4 and CO. In a similar work, Zhao et al. tuned the mass ratios of urea and Ti(SO4)2 to synthesize g-C3N4–N-TiO2 heterojunction catalysts.182 It was interesting to find that CO was the main product of the g-C3N4–N-TiO2 heterojunction, whereas CH4 and CO were the main products of N-TiO2. Therefore, the g-C3N4 could suppress CH4 formation.
Recently, colorful inorganic materials with high stability and strong absorption in the visible light region have been used for modifying TiO2. AgBr often serves as a photosensitive material to improve the activity. He et al. reported the AgBr/TiO2 photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4, CH3OH, CH3CH2OH and CO under visible light irradiation.183 It was interesting to find that 23.2% AgBr/TiO2 exhibited the maximum yield and high stability.


4.1.3 Z-scheme heterojunction. 
Lately, another Z-scheme heterojunction system has been developed for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.184,185 Gondal et al. first synthesized a direct Z-scheme Si/TiO2via a hydrothermal method.186 The direct Z-scheme Si/TiO2 exhibited better photocatalytic performance for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH3OH than that of individual Si and TiO2, because this Z-scheme system could considerably enhance the separation efficiency of e−/h+ pairs and prolong their longevity. In another report, Xin et al. fabricated ZnFe2O4/TiO2 nanobelts Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst via two-step hydrothermal methods.187 The obtained ZnFe2O4/TiO2 exhibited high photocatalytic performance in cyclohexanol for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under UV light irradiation. Furthermore, the introduction of ZnFe2O4 could extend the response of TiO2 into the visible light region.
The all-solid-state Z-scheme CdS/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/TiO2 core–shell nanostructure for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CH4 was reported by Zou et al., where rGO served as the electron mediator to accelerate the separation of e−/h+ pairs and improve the stability of CdS.188 The charge transfer in CdS/rGO/TiO2 Z-scheme heterojunction system is shown in Fig. 16. Under UV-vis light irradiation, both CdS and TiO2 could produce e− and h+. As the CB of TiO2 was negative than the Fermi level of rGO, e− could transfer from the CB of TiO2 to rGO and then recombine with h+ in the VB of CdS. This process effectively improved h+ in TiO2 for the oxidation of H2O and e− in CdS for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

4.2 TiO2–metal heterojunction
Metals and semiconductors have different physical and chemical properties. When they couple with each other, a heterojunction (Schottky barrier) is produced, which can produce a space–charge separation region.136 The Schottky barrier also works as an electron trap to reduce the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. Further, n-type semiconductors, such as TiO2, usually form this heterojunction. Moreover, the work function of a metal is often higher than that of TiO2. A metal can also produce e− by the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) excitation under light irradiation. The schematic of TiO2–metal heterojunction is shown in Fig. 17.136 Here, e− can flow from TiO2 to the metal in order to align the Fermi energy levels. Therefore, metal and TiO2 are excessively negative and positive, respectively. Further, e− can aggregate in the CB of TiO2 and react with CO2 and H+ to produce solar fuels; h+ in the VB of TiO2 reacts with H2O to generate H+ and O2. Table 4 summarizes and compares the typical TiO2–metal heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

The activation of CO2 is more efficiently performed on TiO2 decorated with noble-metal NPs. Zhao et al. prepared uniform Au NPs supported on 3DOM TiO2via a facile GBMR method.189Fig. 18A shows the UV-vis DRS of P25, 3DOM TiO2, and 3DOM Au/TiO2. It was clearly observed that 3DOM TiO2 exhibited a slight red-shift in comparison with P25, and 3DOM Au/TiO2 had a broad band centered by the Au SPR effect.190 It was interesting to find that increasing the Au amounts could remarkably improve the visible light absorbance. Fig. 18B shows the CH4 production amount under visible light irradiation. The 3DOM Au8/TiO2 exhibited the highest CH4 formation rate (2.89 μmol g−1 h−1), which was 2.61 and 2.03 times higher than those of P25 (1.11 μmol g−1 h−1) and 3DOM TiO2 (1.42 μmol g−1 h−1), respectively. The photocatalytic mechanism of 3DOM Au/TiO2 is shown in Fig. 18C. The 3DOM TiO2 structure could increase the light absorption and diffusion of CO2, and Au also extended the spectral range from the UV to the visible light region.

Charge recombination is an important negative effect on the photocatalytic performance. Chai et al. synthesized Ag-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)@TiO2 core–shell photocatalysts via a one-step method with the core–shell coating approach, where MWCNT and TiO2 served as the core and shell, respectively.191 The HRTEM image of Ag-doped MWCNT@TiO2 (Fig. 19a) showed the Ag–TiO2 heterojunction. In Fig. 19b, the CH4 formation rate was evaluated with respect to the photocatalytic activity. It was revealed that the Ag-doped MWCNT@TiO2 had good stability and 2 wt% Ag doping exhibited the highest CH4 formation rate under visible light irradiation. Fig. 19c shows the charge transfer route in Ag-MWCNT@TiO2. Further, e− could transfer to the MWCNT and Ag to reduce the recombination rate of e−/h+ pairs, improving the photocatalytic performance.

It has been reported that semiconductor nanocrystal QDs that can sensitize TiO2 can make full use of the visible light spectrum and increase charge separation efficiency.192 Wang et al. synthesized Pt/TiO2via a wet impregnation method and then CdSe QDs were assembled on Pt/TiO2.193 Under visible light irradiation, CdSe/Pt/TiO2 exhibited a high CH4 formation rate. In another study, Saravanan et al. reported rGO loaded onto Pt/TiO2 NTs for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. Pt NPs could increase the visible light absorption by the LSPR effect and rGO could be used as an electron reservoir to reduce the recombination rate of e−/h+ pairs.194
4.3 TiO2–carbon heterojunction
GR is a new class of material in carbon atoms, which has a two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon atom in the carbon family.195–198 It has some unique properties, such as high surface area (2600 m2 g−1),199–202 high thermal conductivity (5000 W m−1 K−1),203,204 high mobility of charge carriers (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1),205,206 and good optical transparency (97.7%).207 It was first prepared by Novoselov et al.;208 it has received increased attention due to its potential applications. Furthermore, GR can also improve the separation of e−/h+ pairs and suppress the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. Table 5 summarizes and compares the typical TiO2–carbon heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

The Cu2O/GR/TNA heterostructure for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under visible light irradiation was reported by Cao et al.209 The fabrication steps for the Cu2O/GR/TNA heterostructure is shown in Fig. 20a. TNA was first synthesized by two-step anodization methods on Ti foils and then GR was loaded by cyclic voltammetric reduction. Lastly, Cu2O was loaded by an electrochemical deposition method. It was found that the highest CH3OH yield was achieved by the Cu2O/GR/TNA heterostructure (Fig. 20b). Under visible light irradiation, e− and h+ were produced by Cu2O. With the help of GR, e− could transfer to the CB of TNA; therefore, e− and h+ were effectively separated. The possible mechanism of Cu2O/GR/TNA is proposed in Fig. 20c. The ternary heterojunction could increase the visible light absorption and suppress the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. In a similar study, Chai et al. reported N-doped TiO2 with exposed {001} facet (N-TiO2-001) loaded onto GR sheets to fabricate the N-TiO2-001/GR catalyst via the solvothermal method.210 The N-TiO2-001/GR showed the highest photocatalytic activity due to the high catalytic activity of {001} facet and GR.

Graphene oxide (GO) is a ramification of GR, which has abundant oxygenated functional groups (e.g., –OH, –COOH) on its surface and large surface area.211–213 Moreover, we often use GO as the precursor to fabricate GR–semiconductor composite photocatalysts.214–216 Under chemical or thermal conditions, GO can be readily reduced to GR, which is commonly referred to as rGO.217 The rGO–TiO2 hybrid photocatalyst was synthesized by Chai et al. via a solvothermal method.218 rGO–TiO2 had a high CH4 formation rate (0.135 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light irradiation. The intimate interface between rGO and TiO2 largely improved the transfer of e− from TiO2 to rGO, resulting in the enhanced CH4 formation rate. In a further study, Chai et al. synthesized GO-doped O-rich TiO2 (GO–OTiO2) heterojunction structure via a chemical impregnation method.219 It was found that 5 wt% GO–OTiO2 yielded the highest CH4 formation rate (0.29 μmol g−1 h−1) and good photostability. In another report, noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ag, and Au) loaded onto rGO/TiO2 (GT) were also synthesized by Chai et al., where Pt achieved the highest CH4 yield among these noble metals.220 The photocatalytic performance was strongly related to the work function of the metal, where Pt had the highest work function and e− could effectively transfer from TiO2 to Pt. The possible mechanism of Pt–GT for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 is shown in Fig. 21. Under light irradiation, TiO2 could produce e− and h+. Moreover, Pt could effectively trap e− to react with CO2 and H+ to produce CH4 (path 1). Furthermore, Pt was also deposited onto rGO sheets. Therefore, e− could pass the two-dimensional carbon network to rGO sheets and then get trapped by the Pt sites to react with CO2 and H+ (path 2).

Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a new class of material in the carbon family, which exhibit good efficiency of charge separation and electron reservoir properties.221 These CQDs can absorb visible and near-infrared (NIR) light in the solar spectrum.222 Therefore, coupling CQDs with TiO2 can ensure full use of the solar spectrum. Cao et al. reported N-CQDs/TiO2 heterojunctions for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.223 CH4 and CO were the major products under simulated solar light irradiation. These N-CQDs could serve as the photosensitizer and electrons reservoir to enhance the photocatalytic activity.
4.4 Phase or facet TiO2 heterojunction

4.4.1 Phase heterojunction. 
The phase heterojunction structure only exists in one semiconductor with two or more different crystal phases. Recently, the phase heterojunction has attracted considerable attention for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.224–226 TiO2 has the anatase, brookite, and rutile phases. Anatase-based catalysts usually have high activity when compared with rutile-based catalysts owing to the fast recombination of e−/h+ pairs in the rutile phase. Further, brookite-based catalysts are rarely studied because it is very difficult to synthesize high-purity brookite.227Table 6 summarizes and compares the typical phase or facet of TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

Bai et al. reported that anatase TiO2 nanorods (TiO2–RMA) with the {010} facet modified with rutile TiO2 NPs were synthesized via a one-step method.228 The HRTEM image of TiO2–RMA is shown in Fig. 22a. The clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.32 nm and 0.35 nm for the rutile {110} and anatase {101} facets, respectively, were identified. Rutile–anatase heterojunction showed high CH4 formation rate (2.36 μmol g−1 h−1) under UV light irradiation, and the possible mechanism is shown in Fig. 22b. Due to the fact that the CB of anatase was more negative than that of rutile, e− could transfer from anatase to rutile. Therefore, e− and h+ could be effectively separated. In a similar study, Gray et al. used the structure–function understanding to fabricate anatase–rutile TiO2 phases for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, and high selectivity toward CH4 was obtained.229 Gray et al. used the direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering to synthesize mixed-phase TiO2 films (70% anatase and 30% rutile).230 In another report, Zhao et al. synthesized Au–Pd bimetallic metal loaded onto 3DOM TiO2 with the anatase–rutile phases.231 The Au3Pd1/3DOM TiO2 exhibited the maximum CH4 formation rate (18.5 μmol g−1 h−1) because the Au–Pd bimetallic metal had a relatively low Fermi level than that of TiO2 and the separation of e−/h+ pairs was accelerated.

The anatase, brookite, and rutile phases of TiO2 can be accurately tuned by the solution's pH. For example, Ling et al. synthesized anatase–brookite mixed phases via a facile hydrothermal method.232 The TEM image of anatase–brookite TiO2 is shown in Fig. 23a. It was indicated that rod-like and spherical NPs were the typical structures of the brookite and anatase phases, respectively.233 Anatase–brookite TiO2 exhibited the highest CH3OH formation rate under both UV-vis and visible light irradiations. The charge transfer between anatase–brookite TiO2 is shown in Fig. 23b. Here, e− could transfer from the CB of brookite to anatase to react with CO2 and H+ for the production of CH3OH, and h+ could transfer from the VB of anatase to brookite to react with H2O to produce O2 and H+. Li et al. also reported that the anatase–brookite mixed-phase TiO2 showed the highest CO yield for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 when compared with single-phase anatase and brookite TiO2 and P25.234

4.4.2 Facet heterojunction. 
Recent studies have confirmed that exposed facets play a critical role in improving the photocatalytic performance. On account of the first-principles calculations, the {101} facet of anatase TiO2 is the primary CO2 adsorption site for CO2 reduction.235 Moreover, the {101} facet can accelerate e− transfer from the surface of TiO2 to CO2. Yu et al. first controlled the ratio of coexposed {001} and {101} facets of anatase TiO2 for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4.235Fig. 24a shows the schematic involving the tuning of the {001} and {101} facets of anatase TiO2 by adding HF during the preparation process. At the optimal facet ratio of {101} to {001} with 45 to 55 (adding 4.5 mL HF), TiO2 exhibited the maximum CH4 formation rate (1.35 μmol g−1 h−1). The schematic of {001} and {101} facet heterojunction is shown in Fig. 24b. Under light irradiation, e− and h+ could effectively transfer to the {101} and {001} facets, respectively. Therefore, {101} and {001} facets served as the reduction and oxidation activity sites, respectively. The {101} and {001} facets could form a facet heterojunction to enhance the photocatalytic performance. In another study, N-doped TiO2 with 65% {001} and 35% {101} exposed facets obtained via a facile hydrothermal method was synthesized by Yu et al.236 The improved CH3OH formation rate was ascribed to the synergistic effect between the facet heterojunction, N doping, and surface fluorination.

Due to the unique properties of GR, it is often used as a cocatalyst to enhance the photocatalytic activity. GR loaded on coexposed {001} and {101} facets of TiO2 (GR/TiO2-001/101) was reported by Zhao et al.237 The {001} and {101} facets could form the facet heterojunction, which, along with GR, could accelerate the separation of e− and h+ to increase the CO yield. In a subsequent work, Zhao et al. synthesized Pt/TiO2@rGO core–shell-structured photocatalysts, where TiO2 had 51% {001} and 49% {101} coexposed facets.238 Pt NPs could gather and transfer e− from TiO2 and then transfer to rGO, resulting in high charge separation efficiency. The addition of cocatalysts of Pt NPs and rGO could lead to a high CH4 formation rate and quantum efficiency. Recently, Truong et al. found that the exposed high-index {311} facets of rutile TiO2 nanocrystals comprised two {110} terraces and one {111} step.239 Each branched nanocrystal was bound with four facets of the high-index {331} facet. It was interesting to note that the flower-like particles had a higher CH3OH yield (0.569 μmol g−1 h−1) than that of rod-like particles (0.388 μmol g−1 h−1) for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.

4.5 Other TiO2-based heterojunctions
Dye molecules are usually chemisorbed on the surface of TiO2 for sensitization. Kang et al. reported the TDQD [(E)-3-(5-(4-(5-(4-(bis(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-6,7-diethyl-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxalin-9-yl)thiophen-2-y)-2-cyanoacrylic acid] dye loaded onto commercialized TiO2 (P25) to extend the visible light absorption region.240 It exhibited a high CH4 yield of about 1290 μmol g−1 L−1 after 8 h of light irradiation. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for CO2 reduction due to their high surface area to enhance CO2 adsorption. Petit et al. fabricated NH2-UiO-66/TiO2 nanosheet heterojunctions via an in situ growth method for the first time.241 The heterostructure could offer a high surface area and more active sites. Moreover, the large CO2 adsorption capacity could improve the CO2 level on the surface of TiO2 to react with the active sites to produce CO. Recently, hierarchical P25@microporous Co–Al-layered double hydroxides (Co–Al-LDHs) heterojunction for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with high activity and selectivity to produce CO was also described.242 Here, e− could transfer from the Co–Al-LDH to P25; in contrast, h+ could transfer from P25 to Co–Al-LDH. Therefore, e− and h+ were effectively separated. This may offer a facile method to design and fabricate LDH-based materials for energy conversion and pollutant degradation.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, this review discusses the design and fabrication of TiO2-based heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels is a promising method to overcome energy crises and environmental problems. However, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is far away from industrial applications.102,243–245 On one hand, there are some common bottlenecks in this process. The energy efficiency that evaluates the transformation of photon energy into chemical energy is very low. For example, Chen et al. reported the energy efficiency was 1.158% by NiO/InTaO4 under visible light illumination.246 Furthermore, the instantaneous oxidation of the formed hydrocarbons may occur during CO2 reduction; therefore, we should minimize hydrocarbon conversion under process conditions needed for CO2 reduction.247 In addition, hydrocarbons might be retained on the surface of the catalysts during the synthesis processes; therefore, we should eliminate the impact as much as possible. On the other hand, the selectivity of the desired products is low because the HER reaction is accompanied by CO2 reduction, and it is a rather complex process.248 CO, CH4, HCOOH, CH3OH, HCHO, C2H4, and CH3CH2OH can be observed in some catalytic systems. The adsorption and activation of CO2 onto the surface of catalysts can play some important roles in improving the selectivity toward the desired products. The increase in the catalyst surface area, introduction of surface defects (e.g., oxygen and sulfur vacancies), and noble-metal cocatalysts have been widely selected strategies to enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2.249 The mechanism of CO2 reduction should be comprehensively investigated in future studies. At the molecular level through in situ characterization techniques, we can better understand the reaction pathways of CO2 reduction. The reaction barriers and rate-determining steps of CO2 reduction have an important effect to enhance the conversion efficiency.
Developing efficient photocatalysts is the key for improving the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The attractive properties of heterojunction photocatalysts can be used to increase the charge separation and suppress the recombination of e−/h+ pairs. Therefore, designing a heterojunction is an effective strategy for high-activity photocatalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Currently, TiO2-based heterojunction photocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are still in their early stages of development, and we believe that there is room for developing novel, powerful photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Interfacial or heterojunction quantitative control, facet control, surface decorations, band structure alignment, and interfacial in situ characterization on the heterojunction photocatalysts can also be critically important toward efficient photocatalysis, which should be further investigated.
At the same time, other strategies for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are of equal importance. First, the adsorption of CO2 over the surface of the photocatalyst is a very important step for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The basic metal oxide can increase the adsorption of CO2 and it can serve as a cocatalyst for contributing toward the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Second, the morphology has an important effect on the photocatalytic performance. It influences the surface structure, which can control the energy band position and surface reactivity, and affects the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Third, the size of the photocatalyst particles also influences the photocatalytic activity. The optimum particle size of the photocatalyst affects the charge-carrier dynamics and light-harvesting efficiency. A decrease in the particle size may increase the bandgap energy and decrease the light-harvesting efficiency. Fourth, the reductive half-reaction of CO2 is coupled with the oxidative half-reaction of water oxidation to O2. Further, more attention should be paid to the other half-reaction of water oxidation in future studies. In order to enhance the activity of CO2 reduction, it can accelerate the oxidation reaction by adopting certain typical strategies for enhanced O2 evolution in solar water splitting, such as adding some oxidizing auxiliaries.
Moreover, we also can develop other new types of photoreactors for the reduction of CO2 to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, all the factors should be taken into account in the process of design and fabrication of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels. We hope that this review can stimulate new insights and provide guidelines for future research at the intersection of the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into solar fuels, which can benefit humankind.
