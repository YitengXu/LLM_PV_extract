    , Accepted 19th December 2020First published on 22nd December 2020AbstractPerovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have drawn tremendous research attention recently. However, they are mainly prepared via solution processes, while the devices fabricated using the all-vacuum deposition procedure still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we prepared a cesium-lead-bromide perovskite film using the vacuum deposition method, and realized a more balanced stoichiometry by replacing some CsBr with NaBr. It was discovered that the introduction of an appropriate amount of NaBr not only reduced the insulating Cs4PbBr6 phase in the active layer, but also passivated the trap states effectively, which resulted in a 2-fold increase of the peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PeLEDs to 2% with the maximum luminance reaching close to 40000 cd m−2 and significantly improved device operational stability compared to the undoped counterparts. Furthermore, we fabricated the first top-emissive silicon-based PeLED using the all-vacuum deposition method based on the NaBr doped perovskite films, and achieved a peak EQE of 0.33%, which has provided a promising alternative way for the design and preparation of high-performance silicon-based display devices in the future.
Introduction
Halide perovskites have drawn intensive research attention in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and low fabrication cost, and are emerging as promising next generation optoelectronic materials.1–8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells9 and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs)10 have reached 25.2% and 28.2%, respectively, which show great potential for their commercial application. However, the state-of-the-art high performance perovskite-based optoelectronic devices are mainly prepared via solution processes, while those fabricated using the all-vacuum vapor deposition method remain largely unexplored, especially for PeLEDs.11–13 Compared to solution processes, the vacuum vapor deposition (VVD) method has many advantages in the preparation of perovskite materials, such as avoiding the solubility limitation of precursors especially of inorganic halide perovskites, facilitating the precise control of film composition and thickness, preventing solvent contamination, easy to realize patterning, and so on.14–19 Therefore, VVD is a promising preparation method for the commercial production of PeLEDs, which is also compatible with the current commercial OLED display production facilities. However, the investigation of PeLEDs fabricated using the VVD method remains in the infancy stage with the record EQE value of only 3.26% for the inorganic perovskite system and 5.3% in the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite system,17,20 remarkably lagging behind the solution processed counterparts. As a result, it is urgently desired to explore the difference between the vapor-deposited and solution-processed perovskite films in order to unveil the reason behind the low efficiency of VVD-processed PeLEDs.
In addition to efficiency, the operational stability of PeLEDs also needs to be improved to meet the requirement for practical application.21,22 One major problem that limits the operational stability of PeLEDs is the Joule heating effect, especially under the high-voltage working conditions where the effect of EQE roll-off becomes significant, because most of the injected charge carriers will recombine non-radiatively to produce heat that increases the temperature of the devices and promotes the ion migration effects.23–26 The widely used glass substrates generally possess low thermal conductivity which is not good for heat dissipation. In contrast, the high thermally conductive substrates such as silicon wafers have been proved to be ideal substrates for the preparation of PeLEDs with improved robustness under large current injection conditions.23 At the same time, silicon is the dominant platform for the fabrication of electronic components for driving silicon-based micro-LED display devices, which are small in size but possess very high screen resolution, and hence exhibits broad prospects in virtual/augmented/mixed reality applications.27–30 Therefore, the integration of PeLEDs with the mature silicon platform will open up new routes towards the preparation of high performance yet low cost Si-based micro-LED displays.31 Besides, the Si-based micro-displays possess self-luminous characteristics through the preparation of red, green and blue emitting pixels, which can be readily realized using the VVD method via shadow masks.32–34 As a result, it is highly desirable to explore the fabrication of all-vacuum deposited Si-based PeLED devices, which, however, has not been demonstrated yet.
Herein, we adopt CsBr, PbBr2 and NaBr as the evaporation sources to synthesize NaBr doped cesium-lead-bromide perovskite films via the VVD method. In contrast to the devices without NaBr, the EQE of the devices with the optimal composition (CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr molar ratio = 8:4:1) increases from 0.92% to nearly 2% while the maximum brightness reaches close to 40000 cd m−2 with significantly improved device operational stability compared to the undoped counterparts. Subsequently, we combined the optimized NaBr-doped perovskite film with silicon substrates to fabricate the all-vacuum deposited Si-based PeLED for the first time and achieve an EQE of 0.33%, which would shed light on the rational design of silicon-based display devices in the future.
Results and discussion
The cesium-lead-bromide perovskite emission layer was prepared on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) coated ITO/glass substrates through a multi-source thermal evaporation system as schematically shown in Fig. 1a, with CsBr and PbBr2 as the precursor materials. The substrates were rotated during the deposition process to improve the uniformity of the films. After that, 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi), LiF, and Al were sequentially deposited on top of the perovskite films to fabricate the PeLED devices based on the device structure schematically shown in Fig. 1b, and the corresponding energy level diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 1c. We first optimized the composition of the cesium-lead-bromide perovskite film by adjusting the molar ratio of CsBr and PbBr2 from 8:4 to 9.5:4, and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices as a function of bias are shown in the ESI† Fig. S1. Fig. 1d shows the variation of the peak EQE value with the change of the CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratios, which shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increment of the CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratios. This is consistent with the previous report that the precursor molar ratio of CsBr to PbBr2 needs to be larger than the stoichiometry of CsPbBr3 to form the Cs4PbBr6/CsPbBr3 composite film, in order to passivate the trap states in CsPbBr3; however, the excess of Cs4PbBr6 in the composite film will hamper the charge injection from the electrodes due to its wide band gap nature, and hence result in the EQE reduction of the devices.35–37 The perovskite film with the CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratio of 9:4 presents the best optoelectronic performance, exhibiting a peak EQE value of 0.92% that is comparable with those values reported in the literature prepared using the VVD method adopting a similar device structure.10,38,39

One interesting phenomenon in the VVD grown cesium-lead-bromide perovskites is that the optimal CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratio is larger than that used in the solution-processed ones,10,39–41 suggesting the higher trap density in the VVD grown CsPbBr3 that needs to be passivated by excess CsBr. Considering the major difference of vapor deposition from solution processing is that the precursors undergo a high temperature thermal evaporation process, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization on the individual CsBr and PbBr2 films prepared using the VVD method to study the stoichiometry change of the precursors during the thermal evaporation process (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). The calculated bromine contents in the VVD prepared CsBr film and PbBr2 film are both lower than the theoretical value, with the Br/Cs ratio of 0.81 in the CsBr film and the Br/Pb ratio of 1.66 in the PbBr2 film (Table 1). We speculate that this might be caused by the partial decomposition of CsBr and PbBr2 during the high temperature evaporation process, thus leading to the Br deficiency or Br vacancies in the VVD grown cesium-lead-bromide films. Therefore, more CsBr is demanded in the CsPbBr3 film to make up for the bromine loss, which, however, impairs the charge injection and transport properties of the active layer owing to the formation of excessive Cs4PbBr6 phase.

In view of the fact that CsBr is not ideal in passivating Br vacancy defects in VVD grown CsPbBr3 films, we introduced NaBr as the passivator in the active layer. On the basis of the optimal CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratio of 9:4, we replaced an equal amount of CsBr with NaBr to reduce the content of cesium while maintaining the Br content. We introduced the variable x (which is calculated based on the XPS element characterization) to represent the amount of doped NaBr, namely, the amount of reduced CsBr. Based on this, the precursor ratio of the films can be expressed as CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr = 9−x:4:x. We first obtained the surface morphology changes of the perovskite film with the NaBr doping ratio of x = 0, 0.75, 1 and 1.25 by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 2a, with the increase of NaBr contents, the grain size increases gradually. Only from the morphological point of view, this change weakens the spatial overlap of wavefunctions of electrons and holes within the grains which is not ideal for the radiative recombination. Nevertheless, the reduction of Cs content would result in a more balanced stoichiometry of CsPbBr3 which is good for charge injection. Then, we conducted XRD analysis on the perovskite films with different NaBr contents to find out their crystal structure and phase composition variation. As shown in Fig. 2b, when the molar ratio of CsBr/PbBr2 is 9:4, there are distinct diffraction peaks corresponding to the Cs4PbBr6 phase. As the content of NaBr gradually increases to replace some CsBr, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of the Cs4PbBr6 phase decreases significantly. When x = 1.25, there is basically no diffraction peak of the Cs4PbBr6 phase. It can be seen from the XRD spectra that the peak positions are basically unshifted with the incorporation of NaBr. This indicates that the Na+ does not take the position of Cs+ in the lattice to form the perovskite phase, which would otherwise cause significant lattice distance change due to the large ion radius difference between Na+ and Cs+.42,43 In fact, it has been reported that most potassium ions present on the surface of CsPbBr3/CsPbBr3−xIx nanocrystals bind with bromide ions when introducing KBr into the precursor solutions.44 Therefore, we speculate that Na+ may behave similarly to present on the surface and in the grain boundaries of the perovskite films. The absorbance spectra of NaBr doped CsPbBr3 films with the different doping ratios are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The absorption edge of the films with x = 1 and 0.75 are approximately the same as those of the films without NaBr (512 nm). However, the absorption peak of the film with x = 1.25 is red-shifted to 516 nm, which might be caused by the increase of the grain size that increases the influence of light scattering. Fig. 2c is the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the film with the CsBr, PbBr2 and NaBr molar ratio 8:4:1 and that without NaBr. The normalized spectral curves basically coincide with each other and the peak position is centered at 517 nm, which also proves that there is no shift in the peak position caused by the substitution of A-position ions.45 The inset is a photo of the luminescence of the two films under a 365 nm UV-lamp. It can be seen that the film with a molar ratio of 8:4:1 emits brighter light, which demonstrates the better trap passivation effect of NaBr compared to that of CsBr. The corresponding PL quantum yield (PLQY) measurement results also confirm that the doping of NaBr with x = 1 in perovskite film resulted in the increase of PLQY from 10.8% to 16.5%. This is generally consistent with the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra shown in Fig. 2d which displays that the film with a CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr molar ratio of 8:4:1 exhibits a longer PL lifetime compared to the film without NaBr doping. However, when x = 1.25, the PL lifetime of the film drops significantly. This result shows that when the molar ratio of CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr is 8:4:1, the defect density of the perovskite film reaches a minimum.46

(e) Current density–voltage curves of single-carrier devices with and without NaBr doping in the active layer. 
In order to further prove that the introduction of NaBr can effectively reduce the defect density of the perovskite films, we fabricated the electron-only device with the structure of ITO/LiF/TPBi/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al, and performed the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) test. As shown in Fig. 2e, for the devices with the CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr molar ratio of 8:4:1, the trap-filling limited voltage VTFL = 0.26 V and for the devices with the CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratio equal to 9:4, VTFL = 0.38 V. Since the defect-state density can be calculated using the formula , where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative permittivity, e is the elementary charge, and L is the film thickness, Ntraps of perovskite films with the CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr molar ratios of 8:4:1 and 9:4:0 are calculated to be 2.1 × 1017 cm−3 and 3.0 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. This result further proves that replacing some CsBr with NaBr can effectively reduce the trap density, which is consistent with the TRPL measurement results.
To further understand the effect of passivation caused by the addition of NaBr, we characterized the electronic structure of perovskite films with and without NaBr using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high-resolution spectra of the elements Na, Br, Pb and Cs are shown in Fig. 3. We measured the electronic states of all the elements in NaBr, and cesium-lead-bromide perovskite with and without NaBr doping, respectively. In the NaBr-doped perovskite film, the peak of Na 1s was detected, which means that the NaBr dopant was introduced successfully in the perovskite films (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the peak of Na 1s was shifted from 1071.9 eV to 1071.7 eV compared to the NaBr film. This shows that after NaBr doping, the bonding energy of Na–Br was weakened. At the same time, compared with the un-doped film, the peaks of Br 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 are shifted from 69.0 eV and 68.0 eV to 69.1 eV and 68.1 eV, respectively, and the peaks of Pb 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 are shifted from 143.0 and 138.1 eV to 143.1 eV and 138.2 eV, respectively. This result demonstrates that the bonding energy of Pb–Br was strengthened after NaBr doping with a reduced bond length.47 Since the peaks of Cs 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 have no obvious positional change (Fig. 3d), it indicates that the chemical environment of cesium has not changed after NaBr doping. Through the above analysis, we speculate that the introduction of sodium bromide effectively passivated the bromine vacancies, but did not change the chemical state of cesium, which is also consistent with the previous XRD results.48

In view of the trap passivation effect together with the reduction of insulating Cs4PbBr6 phase content as a result of the NaBr doping in the VVD grown cesium-lead-bromide film, we investigated the electroluminescence properties of the devices with various NaBr doping ratios. From the current–voltage curves shown in Fig. 4a, the current density of the devices increases with the increase of NaBr content, which can be ascribed to the gradual reduction of Cs4PbBr6 phases. Meanwhile, the luminance of the devices increases first and then decreases with the increase of NaBr content, which is consistent with the TRPL results of the films. When the molar ratio of CsBr/PbBr2/NaBr is 8:4:1, the luminance of the device reaches the maximum value close to 40000 cd m−2, and the corresponding EQEmax is approximately 2% with the accompanying luminance of 14000 cd m−2 (Fig. 4c). It is worth noting that both the maximum luminance and luminance at the EQEmax are more than 4 times and 2 times higher than those of the best inorganic PeLEDs prepared using the VVD method, respectively.17 The electroluminescence spectra of the devices without NaBr doping and with the doping ratio of 8:4:1 show that the EL peaks are centered at around 519 nm with the FWHM of 19 nm, and there is no peak shift with the increase of the applied bias for both types of device (Fig. 4d and e). We further studied the effect of NaBr doping on the operational stability of the device. A continuous and stable voltage (which makes the initial luminance around 100 cd m−2) was applied to the devices without and with the NaBr doping, and the change of the luminance with time was recorded. From Fig. 4f, it can be seen that the t50 (which defines the time interval in which the device's luminance drops to 50% of its maximum) of the optimal device is 199 s, which is 2 times higher than that of the reference device (t50 = 94 s). The obviously improved stability of the devices demonstrates the suppressed ion-migration upon the addition of NaBr due to its trap passivation effect, which also provides a new avenue to improve the bias-stability of the VVD grown perovskite films.

Based on the optimized perovskite film composition, for the first time we prepared the top-emissive PeLED devices on silicon substrates via an all-vacuum deposition process, with the device structure schematically shown in Fig. 5a. Cr and Au were sequentially evaporated on silicon substrates as the anode, with the thickness of 30 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The reason we choose Au as the anode instead of ITO is because it possesses a higher work function that can reduce the charge injection barrier, while its high reflectance will avoid the self-absorption induced emission loss of the Si substrates. Then, the NiOx hole transport layer with a thickness of 45 nm was deposited on top of the anode through magnetron sputtering to replace the solution processed PEDOT:PSS. After that, perovskite layers, TPBi and LiF were sequentially deposited on the substrates with the processing procedures being the same as those on the glass substrates. Finally, an ultrathin metal cathode composed of 2 nm Al and 12 nm Ag and the TPBI antireflection layer were thermally evaporated on the substrates to form the transparent electrode. Fig. 5b and c show the current density, luminance, EQE, and current efficiency of the devices with the optimal NaBr doping ratio as a function of voltage. The maximum luminance of the devices is 2282 cd m−2 at 7 V, and the EQE of the devices reaches the maximum value of 0.33% at 4.6 V with the maximum light output power density arriving at 0.42 mW cm−2. It is noted that the device efficiency of the Si-based PeLED is much lower than that of the glass-based counterparts. To identify the origin of the low EQE, we have measured the sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the NiOx film, which are 6.7 × 107 Ω □−1 and 9.5 × 104 Ω □−1, respectively. Therefore, the conductivity of the NiOx layer should not be the limiting factor for the low efficiency. However, the significantly decreased current density of the Si-based devices as compared to that of the glass-based counterparts suggests that the poor hole injection efficiency of the magnetron sputtered NiOx may be the main cause for the low EQE, which could be further improved by modulating the energy level alignment of NiOx with perovskite through the doping of magnesium in NiOx, the sputtering power optimization, or the surface modification of NiOx.49–51 Besides, the sheet resistance of the top transparent electrode is measured to be about 30 Ω □−1 according to the 4-probe resistance measurements, and its transmittance at 519 nm is about 83.9% based on the UV-vis transmittance measurements, both of which are inferior to those of the ITO/glass substrates (sheet resistance: 15 Ω □−1, transmittance at 519 nm: 88.3%) and hence can result in the EQE loss for the Si-based devices. Nevertheless, the results presented here open up an alternative way to realize Si-based PeLEDs that is worth being explored in the future.

(c) EQE and current efficiency curves as a function of bias. The inset presents an emission photo of the Si-based PeLED. 
We also tested the operational stability of the silicon-based PeLEDs under constant bias with the initial luminance of around 100 cd m−2 (Fig. S5, ESI†), which exhibited a t50 of 72 s that is shorter than that of the glass-based counterparts (t50 = 199 s). The inferior stability of the Si-based device is probably caused by its low EQE value, since a much higher current density is required for Si-based PeLEDs to realize the identical initial luminance that will produce more Joule heat and hence promote the ion migration effect. With the further improvement of the device efficiency in the future, it is anticipated that the Si-based PeLEDs could exhibit better operational stability.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated an effective strategy to achieve a balanced stoichiometry in VVD grown CsPbBr3 films by replacing some CsBr with NaBr, which not only reduced the insulating Cs4PbBr6 phase in the active layer to improve its charge transport properties, but also passivated the trap states effectively. As a result, the EQEmax of the devices with the optimized NaBr doping ratio was increased by more than 2-fold to 2%, with the maximum luminance reaching close to 40000 cd m−2. The operational stability of devices has also been greatly improved by more than 2 times upon the addition of NaBr due to the suppressed ion-migration effect. In particular, for the first time, we fabricated silicon-based PeLED devices using the all-vapor deposition method, and the EQEmax of the optimal device reached 0.33% with the light output power density of 0.42 mW cm−2. Our work provides a new route to the realization of monolithic hetero-structured PeLEDs, which will facilitate the integration of PeLEDs with Si-based complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) driving circuits for micro-LED display applications in the future.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
ITO/glass substrates were sequentially cleaned via ultrasonication in isopropyl alcohol for 15 min, acetone for 15 min, acetone for 10 min and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, and dried in the oven. After being treated with UV-ozone for 20 min, the PEDOT: PSS solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 500 rpm for 5 s and 4000 rpm for 35 s, and then annealed at 130 °C for 15 minutes on a hot plate in air. The substrates were then transferred to the thermal evaporation chamber (Technol ZHDS 400) to prepare the perovskite films. The evaporation rates of CsBr (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp), PbBr2 (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp) and NaBr (Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Corp) were monitored using quartz crystals. Referring to the sequence of PbBr2–NaBr–CsBr–NaBr with the total thickness of 14 nm as one cycle, three cycles of precursors were successively deposited on the substrates. Finally, a 2.5 nm PbBr2 layer was deposited on the top to complete the perovskite film preparation. Then, they were transferred to the N2-filled glove box and annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. After that, TPBi (Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp), LiF, and an aluminum electrode were deposited on the perovskite film under the vacuum pressure of <2 × 10−4 Pa with the thickness of 22 nm, 1 nm, and 50 nm, respectively. For silicon-based PeLED devices, Cr–Au with the thickness of 80 nm was deposited on silicon substrates as the anode. The NiOx films were prepared via magnetron sputtering using a pure NiOx target. The chamber was evacuated until the pressure inside was less than 5 × 10−3 Pa. Then, oxygen and argon gas were introduced at the rate of 20 sccm. The sputtering was carried out with the target power of 100 W and the pressure of 1 Pa. Finally, to prepare the transparent electrode, the Al cathode was replaced with a vapor-deposited ultrathin metal layer of 2 nm Al and 12 nm Ag, and an anti-reflection layer composed of 22 nm TPBi was thermally evaporated on top of the devices.
Film and device characterization
The morphology of the perovskite film was observed using a HITACHI-SU8010 scanning electron microscope. The XRD measurements were performed on a Japan Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a HITACHI U-4100 spectrophotometer. The PL spectra and time-resolved PL of the films were characterized using a Edinburgh FLS920P spectrometer. The PLQY was measured using the Ocean Optics USB4000-VIS-NIR-ES spectrometer and an integration sphere using a 405 nm cw laser as the excitation source. J–V curves of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter, and the luminance of the device was recorded using silicon photodiodes. The EL spectra of the devices were collected using an Ocean optics fiber spectrometer (USB-4000+). The EQE can be calculated on the basis of the measured current, luminance and EL spectra, assuming a Lambertian emission distribution. The XPS measurements are carried out on an AXIS SUPRA X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The sheet resistance was measured using a FOUR PROBES TECH RTS-8 4-probe resistivity measurement system.
