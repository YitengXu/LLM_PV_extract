    , Accepted 18th August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractSolution-processed perovskite films inevitably have a number of ionic defects, regarded as non-radiative recombination centers, which limit the overall efficiency and the stability of perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs). Passivation of these defects has been proven to be an efficient strategy to suppress the charge recombination and thus improve the performance of Pero-SCs. Herein, for the first time, a π-conjugated and alcohol-soluble small molecule with bilateral carboxyl and thiophene groups, namely 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)terephthalic acid (DTA), was introduced into the MAPbI3−xClx (MA = CH3NH3) film to passivate the defects and enhance the performance of the corresponding planar p–i–n Pero-SCs. With high electron density, the symmetric carboxyl groups on both sides of DTA can effectively coordinate with unsaturated Pb2+ cations to passivate the defects in the perovskite. This efficient defect passivation can reduce the charge trap density and increase the carrier lifetime, which leads to a significant enhancement of the open-circuit voltage from 1.07 V for the control Pero-SC to 1.17 V for the passivated one, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.45%. The highest achieved Voc reaches 1.19 V, with a PCE of 21.40%, and the corresponding loss of Voc is only 0.38 V. In addition, the DTA passivated devices exhibit a photovoltaic performance with high reproducibility, as well as a significant improvement in environmental stability and thermal stability. This work demonstrates the great potential of DTA as an effective and promising additive to passivate the perovskite defects for the high performance of Pero-SCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent properties of a high absorption coefficient,1 wide absorption ranges,2 a tunable direct band-gap,3 and a long charge carrier diffusion length.4 In particular, perovskite materials have been applied to photovoltaic devices with promising results and have undergone rapid development.5 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) have been significantly enhanced from the initial 3.8% to the certified 24.2%.6,7 Although the highest efficiency obtained for Pero-SCs is already higher than that for the commercial CIGS and CdTe thin film solar cells, the questionable long-term stability of perovskite materials has slowed down their commercial application.8–10 Recent research studies have suggested that the degradation of Pero-SCs is mainly caused by humidity, oxygen, UV illumination, heat and electric fields.11,12 Much effort has been made to address this problem. For example, interface engineering,13–15 encapsulation or passivation,16 and controlling the film quality17 have been proposed to further improve the efficiency and stability of Pero-SCs. Nevertheless, to obtain Pero-SCs with competitive performance and accelerate their commercial application processes, an efficient method to address key issues concerning their performance and durability is still in urgent need.
Solution processing and thermal evaporation can be utilized for the deposition of perovskite thin films.18 Since the solution process is convenient and can be used for large-scale preparation, it currently is the most common method used to fabricate Pero-SCs. However, solution-processed perovskite films usually have a large number of ionic defects at the surface and grain boundaries (GBs), which could not only induce charge carrier recombination, but also serve as a path for water to permeate. In addition, charge carrier recombination via these defect states induces nonradiative recombination. This recombination often generates a path for energy loss, which would undermine the fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (Voc). Thus, to achieve better photovoltaic performance of Pero-SCs, many studies focusing on perovskite passivation have been performed recently.16,19–21
Under-coordinated Pb ions are considered to be the main sources of electronic trap states.22–24 These under-coordinated Pb ions have a net positive charge (Pb2+), which facilitates the formation of bonds with electron-rich molecules. Passivation with electron-rich molecules is considered an effective strategy to reduce the defects at the crystal surface and GBs caused by Pb2+ cations, which can significantly suppress the charge recombination and increase the carrier lifetime in the perovskite films. Thus, many small molecules such as guanidinium,25 phenethylammonium iodide,26 trioctylphosphine oxide,27 alkylamine28 and carboxyl derivatives18,29,30 have been employed during the preparation of Pero-SCs to passivate the defect traps and decrease the non-radiative recombination in the perovskite active layers. The Snaith group demonstrated that the Lewis base thiophene could bind the under-coordinated Pb2+ cations in MAPbI3−xClx and effectively passivate the defect sites in the perovskite films.31 Organic π-conjugated small molecules (such as IDIC32 and ITIC33) with carboxyl groups were also introduced into Pero-SCs as an interlayer to heal the trap defects. More recently, Yang et al. introduced caffeine with carbonyl groups to slow down perovskite crystal growth via interacting strongly with Pb2+ cations, resulting in a high device PCE of 20.25%.34 In particular, the Han group demonstrated that the passivation effect intensified with the increase of electron density on the carboxylate group, resulting in a significant PCE enhancement from 18.52% to 20.43%.35 It can be seen from the previous studies that carbonyl or carboxyl with rich electrons can efficiently passivate the trap defects at the crystal surface and GBs in perovskite films through a Lewis acid–base reaction with under-coordinated Pb2+ cations. However, the synthesis routes of most organic molecules are relatively complex. Moreover, when these organic molecules are introduced into the perovskite, in most cases, the use of benzene solvents such as toluene or chlorobenzene, which are harmful to the environment, cannot be avoided. Therefore, it is highly urgent to explore simple and eco-friendly molecules introduced into perovskite to passivate the defects for improving the performance of the corresponding Pero-SCs.
In this work, we adopted a π-conjugated and alcohol-soluble small molecule with bilateral carboxyl and thiophene groups, namely 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)terephthalic acid (DTA) (Fig. 1a), for passivating defects in an MAPbI3−xClx device for the first time. DTA mixed with the organic salts MAI and MACl in isopropanol (IPA) is diffused into PbI2via a two-step method, in which benzene solvents such as toluene or chlorobenzene were avoided, to allow DTA to incorporate into the inside of perovskite to fabricate the passivated MAPbI3−xClx film. Our results showed that the symmetric carboxyl groups of DTA have high electron density and play a key role in passivating defects by forming Pb–O coordination. Consequently, the introduction of DTA resulted in decreased defect density, reduced charge carrier recombination, and enhanced performance of Pero-SCs. Pero-SCs with an inverted planar structure passivated with DTA exhibit significantly enhanced PCEs from 19.10% to 21.45%. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest efficiencies for inverted planar Pero-SCs. Moreover, this DTA passivation strategy not only reduces the Voc loss (0.38 V) but also improves the reproducibility of the photovoltaic performance for the passivated device. In addition, the DTA passivated devices also exhibit a significant improvement in environmental stability and thermal stability. The high-performing devices can maintain over 85% of the initial PCE after 40 days aging in an ambient environment without any encapsulation and 500 h of thermal aging at 65 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere.

2. Results and discussion
The DTA molecule was synthesized according to a previous report.36 DTA exhibits 5% weight loss at a decomposition temperature (Td) of 300 °C as shown in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot in Fig. S1,† indicating its good thermal stability and its ability to withstand the annealing temperature for the perovskite films.
To analyze its electronic structure, we performed electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis based on the B3LYP/6-31G** level. As shown in Fig. 1b, while the CO and C–S units of DTA have a negative charge, the electron-withdrawing end group of carboxyl (OC–O) demonstrates the highest electron density in the molecule, providing possible favorable conditions for coordination with the under-coordinated Pb2+ cations. The overall molecule is distorted (Fig. S2†) and its dipole is very large, which would also likely facilitate the interaction between DTA and the under-coordinated Pb2+ cations in perovskite crystals.35
To investigate the possible interaction between DTA and Pb2+ cations, first Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of neat DTA and the DTA–PbI2 complex was performed and the results were compared. The results show that while the C–S vibration band shifted from 709 cm−1 for neat DTA to 704 cm−1 for the DTA–PbI2 complex, (Fig. S3b, ESI†), the CO vibration shifted from 1691 cm−1 to 1630 cm−1 (Fig. S3c†). These shifts demonstrate that both S and O atoms have bonding interactions with Pb2+. In particular, the larger shift for CO indicates that the bonding between bilateral carboxyl groups and Pb2+ is even stronger due to their highest electron density within the DTA molecule. Subsequently, the FTIR spectra of the reference MAPbI3−xClx film and passivated MAPbI3−xClx film were obtained to further confirm the interaction between DTA and perovskite in the corresponding devices. The passivated MAPbI3−xClx film was fabricated by the traditional two-step method, the DTA molecule was dissolved in the solution of IPA and cast on the PbI2 film in the spin coating process, as shown in the schematic of Fig. 1c. The results show that, after the introduction of DTA into the MAPbI3−xClx film, the CO vibration band shifted from 1691 cm−1 to 1688 cm−1 (Fig. 1e), which is an indication that similar coordination effects between the O atom of the carboxyl group and Pb2+ cations of perovskite occurred in the corresponding device (Fig. 1d).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted to investigate the surface chemistry of MAPbI3−xClx films without and with DTA passivation. Both samples show I 3d with two peaks located at 629.7 (3d5/2) and 618.2 eV (3d3/2), respectively (Fig. S4b†). In the passivated film, the existence of S is evidenced from the signals of S 2p at 163.7 and 164.9 eV (Fig. S4c†), which confirmed the existence of DTA. Fig. 1f shows the high-resolution spectra of Pb 4f. For the reference MAPbI3−xClx film, in addition to two main Pb 4f7/2 (137.5 eV) and Pb 4f5/2 (142.4 eV) peaks, two small shoulders on the lower binding energy side of the main peak, marked with arrows, were observed and were attributed to the defect of under-coordinated Pb2+ cations, previously assigned to the metallic Pb cluster (Pb0).37,38 After the introduction of DTA, these peak assigned to unsaturated Pb2+ cations disappeared. This result again confirms the coordination between DTA and the unsaturated Pb2+ in the MAPbI3−xClx film.
The UV-vis absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite without and with DTA passivation are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The identical UV-vis spectra of the two perovskite films suggest that the presence of DTA does not have notable effects on their UV-vis absorption and their film thickness. In contrast, the steady-state PL spectra of the two perovskite films are significantly different. The steady-state PL intensity of the DTA passivated films is about 7 times larger compared to that of the reference one, indicating the effective passivation between DTA and trap defects. Previous studies have suggested that the presence of trap defects can lead to a bandgap lower than that of the bulk with a red-shifted PL peak.24 Here, the steady-state PL peak was blue-shifted from 760 nm to 755 nm after introduction of DTA (Fig. S5†), which further suggests that the DTA molecules can passivate the defects at the perovskite surface.39,40 PL lifetimes are commonly used to illustrate the charge recombination dynamics of perovskite films.41 The time-resolved PL decays of the perovskite films in Fig. 2c are fitted with the biexponential function: Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), where the short lifetime τ1 represents the non-radiative recombination induced by charge-trapping defect states and the long lifetime is related to the bimolecular recombination in the bulk film.42 The fitted parameters are summarized in Table S1.† With the introduction of DTA, the portion for the short lifetime decreased from 30.6% to 24.2%, and the lifetime increased from 2.2 ns to 29.9 ns. The long lifetime is 194.3 ns, which is 10 times longer than that of the reference film (19.4 ns). Above all, both steady-state PL and PL lifetime analyses demonstrate that there is less non-radiative recombination and a lower defect density for passivated perovskite, which is beneficial for the corresponding photovoltaic performance, especially for obtaining a higher Voc.43,44 In addition, time-resolved PL decays of the PCBM-coated MAPbI3−xClx films without and with DTA passivation were tested, as is shown in Fig. S6.† The shorter lifetime for the passivated MAPbI3−xClx film indicates efficient charge carrier extraction at the interface and would likely lead to an enhanced photovoltaic performance.45

The crystallinity of MAPbI3−xClx films deposited on the glass substrate was further explored by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the results are shown in Fig. 2d. The clear diffraction peaks at 13.6, 27.3 and 30.5° for both perovskite films can be indexed to the (110), (220), and (310) reflections of the perovskite crystal structure, respectively. There is no additional diffraction peak in the XRD spectrum of the passivated film in comparison with that of the reference one, implying that DTA is not embedded in the perovskite crystal lattice and could likely exist at GBs or the surface of perovskite.46 In addition, the PbI2 diffraction peak at 12.3° was not detected for the passivated film, an indication of effective passivation. The absolute intensity of the (110) peak of the MAPbI3−xClx film increased after DTA treatment, suggesting that DTA doping is beneficial for the improvement of the crystallinity of perovskite.47,48
To further investigate the morphologies and elemental distribution of the prepared perovskite films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping were carried out. We characterized the top-view SEM images of the MAPbI3−xClx film without and with DTA deposition on the PTAA-coated ITO, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Compared to the reference perovskite film, the GBs became blurred and pinholes disappeared from the surface of the passivated perovskite film. The cross-sectional SEM image of the passivated perovskite film shown in Fig. 3c demonstrates that the passivated perovskite film has a uniform and dense surface without any pinholes. This phenomenon was also observed in the morphologies of perovskite films deposited on bare glass, as shown in Fig. S7.† These results suggest that DTA has a strong capability to passivate the perovskite GBs. A slight reduction in grain size of the passivated perovskite with DTA was observed. This result may be likely due to fact that when the DTA additive strongly binds to the perovskite crystals during perovskite crystallization, it somewhat hinders grain growth and thus shrinks the perovskite grain size to some extent.49,50 To determine the location of DTA in the MAPbI3−xClx film, the EDX maps and spectra for the cross-sectional SEM image of the perovskite films with and without DTA were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3d and S8.† The homogeneous distribution of the Pb element in the MAPbI3−xClx film demonstrates the high quality of the resulting perovskite films. More importantly, the element of S throughout the entire passivated perovskite film can be clearly observed from the EDX map of the passivated film, suggesting a uniform distribution of DTA. From the XRD pattern, we know that the DTA is not embedded in the perovskite lattice. Overall, these results indicate that DTA could likely incorporate into the GBs of the MAPbI3−xClx film.

To further study the passivation effect on the device photovoltaic performance, we designed and fabricated planar p–i–n Pero-SCs with the structure of ITO/PTAA/Perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag as shown in Fig. 4a. The mass fraction of DTA in organic salt precursor solutions varied from 0.5–6.0 wt%. The J–V curves and detailed parameters of devices with different mass ratios of DTA are shown in Fig. S9 and Table S2.† The J–V curves and corresponding parameters of the champion devices without and with doped DTA for passivation are shown in Fig. 4b and Table 1. Among them, the best PCE of the control device is 19.10%, with a Voc of 1.07 V, Jsc of 22.59 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.19%. By contrast, 2 wt% DTA passivated perovskite devices showed a higher Voc of 1.17 V, Jsc of 22.50 mA cm−2, and FF of 81.42%, resulting in a champion PCE of 21.45%, one of the highest efficiencies for p–i–n planar perovskite solar cells reported so far (Table S3†). The overall device performance results suggest that this significant increase of PCE is mainly attributed to the improvement of Voc, the average values of which are 1.05, 1.10, 1.13, 1.17, 1.15, and 1.07 V for DTA concentrations of 0–6 wt%, respectively (Fig. 4c). In addition, the near identical reverse scan and forward scan of J–V curves (Fig. S10†) suggest that there is no obvious hysteresis observed in these devices.

The integrated photocurrents Jsc obtained from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the control and the DTA passivated devices (Fig. 4d) are calculated to be 21.48 mA cm−2 and 21.64 mA cm−2, consistent with J–V results. The highest Voc in the DTA-passivated devices is 1.19 V, boosted by 120 mV compared with the control device, with a corresponding PCE of 21.40% (Fig. S11†). The band gap of the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite was calculated to be 1.57 eV according the EQE spectra (Fig. S12†). Thus, the resulting Voc loss is only 0.38 V, implying the excellent defect passivation effect of DTA for perovskite.
Furthermore, the statistic efficiency distributions of the control and 2 wt% DTA passivated Pero-SCs based on 30 devices in a batch are plotted in Fig. 4e and the corresponding statistic of Voc, Jsc, and FF distributions in a box chart are plotted in Fig. S13,† which demonstrated the excellent reproducibility and reliability of the device performance of the DTA passivated Pero-SCs. To further confirm the reliability of the device performance, the steady-state photocurrent and efficiency under maximum power point (Vmax = 0.9 V for the control device and Vmax = 1.00 V for the 2 wt% DTA passivated device) of champion devices are tracked for ca. 180 s, and are presented in Fig. 4f and S14.† Stability efficiencies of 19.03% and 21.3% can be achieved for the control and the passivated devices with photocurrents of 21.15 and 21.3 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the PCEs extracted from J–V curves.
To evaluate the trap density of perovskite for control and passivated devices, electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/TiO2/Perovskite/PC61BM/Al were fabricated to obtain dark current–voltage curves (Fig. 5a). At a low bias voltage, which is defined as the Ohmic regime, the current linearly increases with voltage. When the current nonlinearly increases with voltage, the kink point of the voltage is the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which can be used to calculate the trap density according to eqn (1). (1)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε (=35) is the relative dielectric constant, e is the electron charge and d (=280 nm) is the thickness of the perovskite film. The VTFL values of the control perovskite film and DTA-passivated perovskite film are 1.25 V and 0.93 V. After passivation with DTA, the trap density is reduced to 4.61 × 1016 cm−3 compared with the 6.18 × 1016 cm−3 of the control device, indicating that ion-induced trap-states and charge recombination can be efficiently suppressed by the DTA doping. Fig. S15† shows a linear correlation of Jsc and light intensity with slopes close to 1 for the control and passivated devices, suggesting that the bimolecular recombination in these devices can be negligible.51 Furthermore, the Vocversus light intensity of the device is presented in Fig. 5b. Previous studies have suggested that the deviation between the slope and kT/q is related to the trap-assisted recombination. Here, the plot based on the DTA passivated device exhibited a slope of 1.34 kT/q, smaller than the 1.49 kT/q for the control device. These results suggest that the trap-states were passivated and the trap-assisted recombination was reduced for passivated devices, in good agreement with the abovementioned results of trap density measurement.

To further investigate the improvement of Voc, the J–V curves were measured in the dark and are shown in Fig. 5c. The ideality factor (n) and saturation current (J0) were obtained by fitting the linear parts (green line and blue line) with the following equation.52 (2)where JD is the dark current density, Vb is the applied bias, q is the elemental charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The device with DTA passivation shows a relatively lower n and J0 (n = 1.77 and J0 = 1.91 × 10−10 mA cm−2) compared with the control one (n = 2.37 and J0 = 9.15 × 10−9 mA cm−2). The lower n and J0 are an indication of less charge recombination, which likely accounts partially for the higher Voc.52,53
To investigate the sensitivity of the passivated perovskite films to humidity, the unsealed perovskite films without and with passivation were placed in an ambient atmosphere with 50–60% relative humidity for 40 days. After aging, no apparent color change was observed for either the passivated or the reference film (Fig. S16†). The UV-vis absorption intensity and the XRD patterns of the perovskite film without and with passivation were analyzed to further confirm the film stability.54 Compared to the rapidly decreasing absorption in the visible range for the reference film, the absorption of the passivated perovskite film largely remains the same during the exposure time (Fig. S17†). This difference suggests that while the reference film experienced rapid degradation during the exposure time, the presence of DTA helped maintain the stability of the perovskite films against humidity. As shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. S18†), the PbI2 peak located at 12.3°, representing the decomposition of the perovskite film,55 is much lower for the passivated one than for the reference film, again indicating a higher resistance of the passivated film towards moisture.

Fig. 6a presents the contact angle of water on top of the control and passivated perovskite films with approximate values of 36° and 48°, respectively. The increase of the water contact angle after introduction of DTA is likely due to the incorporation of the hydrophobic DTA and the strong coordination between Pb2+ cations and DTA. As a result, the metallic Pb clusters on the surface of the perovskite crystals were reduced and some defects were passivated, and then some of the diffusion channels of moisture were blocked.24,35

(b) The PCE decays of control and DTA-passivated devices without encapsulation exposed to an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 15–20% in the dark at 20–25 °C. (c) The PCE decays of control and DTA-passivated devices without encapsulation under heating stress (65 °C) in the nitrogen glovebox. 
The environmental stability of corresponding Pero-SCs without encapsulation is evaluated in an ambient environment with a relative humidity of 15–20% in the dark at 20–25 °C, and the results are shown in Fig. 6b and S19a.†Fig. 6b shows the tendency of PCE decays over time. While the PCE of the control device decreased to 76% of its initial value after 40 days, the device passivated with DTA maintained 87% of its initial PCE after the same period of time, confirming its better stability. This improvement of the environmental stability of Pero-SCs is in good agreement with the humidity stability results of perovskite films. The variation of photovoltaic parameters versus storage time is summarized in Fig. S19a.†
Besides the environmental stability, we also measured the thermal stability of the perovskite films and the Pero-SCs. XRD patterns of these perovskite films under heat stress (65 °C) placed in a N2 glovebox for 10 days were measured. As shown in Fig. S20,† the XRD pattern of the reference perovskite film exhibits more distinct diffraction peaks of PbI2 compared with the passivated one. The thermal stability of Pero-SCs also displays a dramatic improvement after DTA passivation (Fig. 6b). The device with passivation maintains 85% of its initial PCE values when held at 65 °C for 500 h in a N2 glovebox. By contrast, the PCE of the control device only maintained 43% of its initial value under the same conditions. The changes of corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. S19b.†
3. Conclusions
In summary, a simple and alcohol-soluble molecule (DTA) with bilateral carboxyl and thiophene groups was introduced into the perovskite layer to passivate the trap defects for the first time. Theoretical calculation and experimental studies demonstrated that the carboxyl groups in the DTA molecule have the highest electron cloud distribution and can sufficiently form coordination with the under-coordinated Pb2+ cations, leading to reduced trap defects and suppressed non-radiative recombination in the perovskite active layer. The perovskite films passivated with DTA show a higher steady-state PL intensity, longer decay lifetime, more compact morphology without pin-holes on the surface and fewer trap densities. When fabricating the Pero-SCs by doping DTA into the organic salt (MAI and MACl) precursor solutions, a champion PCE of 21.45% with a Voc of 1.17 V was achieved, which is one of the highest efficiencies for planar p–i–n Pero-SCs reported so far. In particular, a significant boost of 120 mV for Voc and a notably small Voc loss of 0.38 V were also obtained from the passivated devices. The environmental stability and the thermal stability of Pero-SCs were also notably improved after being passivated with DTA. This study demonstrated the great potential of the DTA molecule as an additive to improve the photovoltaic performance of Pero-SCs, which could be extended to DTA derivatives as well as applications in Pero-SCs with different active layers and structures.
