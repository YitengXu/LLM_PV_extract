    , Accepted 27th May 2021First published on 9th June 2021AbstractA series of transition-metal-doped Fe1−xMxCo(PO4)4(010) and Fe3Co1−xMx(PO4)4(010) electro-catalyst surfaces (with M = Mn, Os, Ru, Rh and Ir) have been modelled via density-functional theory (DFT) to gauge their mechanistic and thermodynamic prospects for oxygen-evolution reactions (OER), as part of the overall electrochemical water-splitting process. These doped surfaces have been analysed systematically by DFT calculations, scrutinising their underlying electronic- and nuclear-structure characteristics and thermodynamic-energetics profiles, to assess their OER viability, including consideration and comparison of charge-density effects for the transition-metal dopants. In particular, all of the reaction steps for the overall OER reaction schemes have been explored on all possible surface reaction sites, and the energy profile and associated free-energy-change effects have been computed and discussed. Iron replaced by osmium shows a most promising catalysing effect for all reactions at Co surface sites.
Introduction
In recent decades, particularly with the growing awareness of the need to address supply–demand matching for inherently intermittent renewable-energy sources (e.g., wind, solar), the role of alternative, efficient, and environmentally-friendly energy storage and production systems, such as metal–air batteries, has been highlighted.1,2 Indeed, managing growing worldwide energy demand, coupled with limited availability of natural hydrocarbon energy resources, is becoming an ongoing and increasingly more daunting scientific challenge facing the world now and, in the decades, ahead. Against the backdrop of this “Grand Challenge”, exploring clean and sustainable energy-conversion approaches to replace rapidly dwindling fossil-fuel sources and hydrocarbon reserves, and developing highly efficient energy- conversion and -storage systems, are extremely necessary. Considering both current and future such demand for new renewable-energy sources, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has shown great potential in solar-to-hydrogen production. Indeed, as a pivotal, ‘bottleneck’ semi-reaction in PEC water splitting, the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) has been studied for decades, in efforts to render it more efficient.3–5 Compared with the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER), the OER is a slow kinetic process involving the transfer of four electrons and the formation of oxygen–oxygen bonds.3 The mechanism is very complex, with a higher over-potential than HER,6–10 so realising sustainable improvements therein lies at the very heart of key steps taken towards progressing efficient PEC water splitting.11–14 Indeed, reflecting further, the great, specific challenge to realise tangible OER progress centres on searching for – and finding – alternative OER electro-catalysts based on noble/non-noble materials, or, perhaps more pragmatically, on a judicious, economic, and operationally/environmentally sustainable mix of thereof, to act as substrates - boasting high-activity, low-cost, and long-term durability for practical solar-cell applications.
Bearing this powerful background motivation in mind, in recent decades, noble-metal electro-catalysts, such as IrO2 and RuO2, have become the most used catalysts for OER processes, due to their exhibiting good catalytic activity and high durability, in both alkaline and acidic media, although they suffer from low abundance and high cost.15,16 Generally, the introduction of an electro-catalyst helps to lowers the OER over-potential and to accelerate the associated kinetics – improving, as a result, both the energy-conversion efficiency and turnover performance.17,18 Essentially, the ideal OER catalyst should feature a low over-potential, high durability, low cost, high abundance, low environmental impact, and, of course, good scalability for large-scale engineering deployment in solar-cell, and other, devices.19 In this vein, and in view of the previously-mentioned high cost and low abundance of IrO2 and RuO2, researchers have developed many transition-metal-based catalysts to improve the OER process over the past decade or so, and proposed the following catalysts with reasonably promising OER usage: transition metal-based oxy-hydroxides, oxide, perovskites, cobalt–phosphate composites, and Co3O4 cobalt phosphate, surface-oxidised steels, and, indeed, NiFe-layered double hydroxide/nickel foams.2,20–25 However, unfortunately, these materials share a common drawback of suffering from a large over-potential (η) difference for the OER process. Hence, improving OER prospects hinges on lowering the over-potential difference; in this goal, elucidating the underlying OER mechanism remains a formidable challenge for both experiment and theory.
However, excitingly, very recent studies have proved that heteroatom doping is an extremely effective strategy to enhance further the OER performance of Fe3Co(PO4)4 in combination with reduced graphene-oxide substrates;26 a remarkable OER-performance boost was identified as being attributable to the –PO4 groups, which reduce the free-energy barrier for OER at Fe and Co sites.26 In this vein, we are motivated especially by the seminal and important computational-design advances of ref. 26; in the present work, we pursue further design paradigms of such novel OER catalysts by transition-metal-doping FeCo(PO4)4 iron phosphate, as Fe1−xMxCo(PO4)4(010) and Fe3Co1−xMx(PO4)4(010) (where ‘M’ denotes Mn, Os, Ru, Rh and Ir). We evaluate their OER performance systematically via density-functional theory (DFT) calculation. In particular, we seek to identify genuinely promising catalytically active sites, predict DFT over-potentials, determine the rate-limiting OER steps, establish trends in catalytic activity, and propose further optimisation strategies.
Computational methodology
The oxygen-evolution reaction is typically subject to larger over-potential differences, which, in practical applications, restrict the OER efficiency of many metal oxides. Therefore, obtaining thorough information on the sources of this over-potential, and ways of reducing it to a minimum, is an essential task. Although these problems are tough to solve experimentally (e.g., because of limited lifetimes of intermediate reactions), theoretical methods can sometimes be rather more promising in their ability to provide mechanistic insights to OER intermediate steps and sources of over-potential. Indeed, first-principles studies constitute a powerful tool because they enable one to access individual reaction steps, together with the intermediate aspects, of the overall OER scheme. We investigated the OER reaction of substitutionally-doped Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) surfaces by means of DFT + U calculations, as the (010) surface has been shown to be the most favourable plane for Fe3Co(PO4)4 from ref. 26. We use the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formula in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange–correlation energy functional.
DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).27,28 Projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials were employed for the ion-electron terms, with valence configurations of Fe(3d74s1), Co(d8s1) P(s2p3) and O(2s2p4), using the implementation of Kresse and Joubert.29 Hubbard Ueff corrections were modelled by considering the on-site Coulomb corrections of Fe 3d orbitals using the spin-polarised GGA + U method introduced by Dudarev et al.;30,31Ueff was set to 4.3 (ref. 32) and 3.0 (ref. 33) eV for Fe and Co atoms, respectively. The number of VASP plane-waves was controlled by the cut-off energy, which we set to 550 eV, having tested for cut-off convergence. Brillouin-zone integrations were performed during geometry relaxation using k-point grids with a 4 × 4 × 3 for bulk Fe3Co(PO4)4 and the doped structures Fe1−xMxCo(PO4)4(010) and Fe3Co1−xMx(PO4)4(010). In constructing (010) surfaces, the system was placed in a 2 × 2 × 3 supercell (cf. Fig. S3, ESI†), i.e., featuring 96 atoms, with the direction of heterogeneity being along the crystallographic c-axis, with vacuum spacing between periodic images being slightly larger than the c-axis crystal ‘height’ (cf. Fig. S3 ESI†) the same k-points mesh was used for DOS calculations. For geometry optimisation of bulk structures and (010) surfaces, conjugate-gradient energy minimisation was employed. The cut-off energy was taken as 550 eV, and structural optimisation was performed until convergence criteria of energy and force reached 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. The effects of van der Waals corrections were modelled using Grimme's method, with Becke–Jonson damping.34
Results and discussion
Initially, we will discuss the Fe3(PO4)4 bulk and the corresponding slab. As described above, we made the bulk structure Fe3Co(PO4)4 from the corresponding parent structure, and we studied the properties and possibility of formation of the corresponding surface slabs. The adopted final simulation protocol to take into account rigorously the structural and magnetic properties of bulk Fe3(PO4)4 developed during DFT + U investigations with consideration of spin polarization, as mentioned above. The monoclinic primitive cell with the Pm-space group was adopted. Of the magnetic orderings (AFM and FM), we considered the ferromagnetic (FM) case: it was verified with agreement of earlier reported experiment and computational studies.26 The magnetic moment of each Fe atom was ∼4.04 μB; in the case of the Fe magnetic moment, a slightly lower value was identified due to the fluctuation of the magnetic–exchange interactions in bulk Fe3(PO4)4’s FM configuration. The relaxed bulk structure and corresponding (010)- plane surface slabs are shown in Fig. 1. We have computed the surface energy of this Fe3(PO4)4–surface formation from the corresponding bulk structure: this was 0.067 eV, indicates that the formation of this Fe3(PO4)4(010) surface is quite a favourable process.

Further, we have also carried out cell-volume (V, Å3) calculations to ascertain the c/a ratios for bulk α-Fe3(PO4)4, which was found to deviate by less than 0.001 Å3 (1.0%) from the experimental values for V (11.86 Å3). The spin-magnetic moment of Fe atoms in bulk-Fe3(PO4)4 does not diverge, i.e., 4.04 μB was retained during cell-volume calculations.
The incorporation of cobalt-doping to the bulk Fe3(PO4)4 yields a resultant structure of bulk-Fe3Co(PO4)4 lattice featuring slight structural distortions in the c/a ratio and a slight volume enhancement of 0.022 Å3 (2.2%) was observed (shown in Fig. 1(c)). Further, we have computed the surface energy of the Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) surface's formation from the corresponding bulk structure, and the computed surface energy was 0.021 eV – indicating that the formation of Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) is a relatively favourable process. Further, we have proceeded in replacing the Co atoms by other dopant elements (Mn, Rh, Ir, Os and Ru) and rendered these different, co-doped surface systems to check and compare their OER efficacy vis-à-vis these ‘cobalt-monologed’ (010) surfaces. All of the corresponding (co-)doped slabs are shown in Supporting Information. (Fig. S7†).
We have doped substitutionally several foreign elements to the Fe1−xCoMx(PO4)4(010) surface by replacing the Co and Fe atom by Mn, Rh, Ir, Os and Ru. This changes the electronic properties of all these surfaces: from the Density of States, we clearly observe the slight shifting of the valence and conduction bands' edges, and the introduction of new impurity bands were observed in the band-gap area. We depict the total Density of States for each doped system in Fig. 2. In our case, each doping element has a subtle influence on the electronic structures by introducing and modulating different types and positions of impurity states. These impurity bands facilitate changes in electronic properties and photocatalytic performances of the doped Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) surfaces.

For the Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) surface, and other co-doped cases, the charge-density effect of the substitutional transition-metal co-dopants (M = Mn, Os, Ru, Rh and Ir) are shown in Fig. 3. At these surfaces, the cobalt and iron sites were taken the two different sites where the dopants were replaced, to accomplish substitutional doping (cf.Fig. 3). After geometry optimisation, there was minimal structural strain imparted by the substitutional transition-metal dopants at these cobalt and iron sites.

Electron depletion is shown in cyan, whilst electron accumulation is shown in yellow regions. 
However, there is clear-cut evidence of electron accumulation and depletion in Fig. 3, depending on the type of dopant (highlighted by blue circles in Fig. 3), and the dopant site. Most dramatically, manganese replacement of cobalt leads to substantial electron depletion, whilst all other materials shown electron accumulation. This evidence of dopant-induced charge transfer by electron accumulation and depletion indicates that there is potentially ripe scope for OER; however, this, in and of itself, does not necessarily guarantee or bring about fully this hoped-for OER improvement – being a necessary but insufficient condition for OER. As we shall see in due course, subtle intricacies in free-energy profiles of individual sub-step reactions, influenced heavily by the underlying surface-adsorption location, are very important.
Reaction steps
To study the overall OER scheme in more detail, we must focus on individual sub-steps. The OER performance of pure and doped systems can be predicted using the Gibbs free-energy (ΔG) profiles for the following sequence of elementary OER sub-steps:StepI: H2O + * → *OH + H+ + e−StepII: *OH → *O + H+ + e−StepIII: H2O + *O → *OOH + H+ + e−StepIV: *OOH → * + *O2 + H+ + e−StepV: *O2 → * + O2where ‘*’ denotes the bare surface and *OH, *O, *OO and *OOH denote the surface featuring different chemisorbed species. The theoretical potential of oxygen evolution is 1.23 V at standard conditions, with the free energy (ΔG) of the overall reaction calculated to be 4.92 eV under equilibrium conditions. Accordingly, the ΔG of every single proton−/electron-transfer step can be written as a function of the chemisorption free energy of two adsorbed oxygen intermediates. This sequence of steps is depicted in Fig. S2† for the presently-doped (010) surfaces. By carrying out DFT and geometry optimisation, we computed these free-energy terms (cf. ESI†).
Initially, in step I, *OH is formed, with a by-product of H+ and an electron by H2O dissociation adsorbing at the surface of the catalyst when combining with a hole (h+), which, in step II, can further lose H+ to form the chemisorbed *O species, aided by a second h+. In step III, an incoming water molecule (H2O) initiates nucleophilic attack with the chemisorbed *O surface complex and forms another chemisorbed species featuring on O–O bond, i.e., *OOH; in this way, a H+ and electron is formed as by-product. In the next step (IV), the *OOH reacts with the underlying surface itself, yielding the ‘exposed’ *O2per se, and, finally, this reacts with the bare surface and provides the ‘evolved’ oxygen molecule into the aqueous solution. The effect on the energy profile of the OER reaction is calculated and discussed in the following sections.
Cobalt replaced by manganese
The OER elementary steps were calculated using the above-mentioned method and three potential surface-reaction sites were selected for the same. On the pure Fe3(PO4)4 surface, iron was chosen as the reaction site, and the reaction energies are shown by the black line (cf.Fig. 4); in contrast, an ‘ideal’ profile is shown in Fig. S1 (cf. ESI†). Cobalt was doped at the Fe3(PO4)4 surface by substitution at the Fe sites with ∼4.16 mol% cobalt doping in the system (cf. Fig. S4, ESI†). These were both chosen as reaction sites, and the effect of the dopants are reported in Fig. 4 in red (Fe site) and orange (Co site). The cobalt doping clearly produced evidence of enhancing the OER reaction process. Finally, to initiate studies of codoping (with 3.125 mol% cobalt and ∼1.04 mol% transition-metal dopant), we replaced one cobalt atom by manganese (cf. Fig. S5, ESI†), and repeated the OER-sequence calculations atop three surface sites – namely Mn, Fe and Co. The energies are relatively very low compared to the pure and Co-monodoped cases (cf.Fig. 4), and, energetically, these were found to be more stable – and, hence, less favourable towards the OER reaction; all of the energies are compared and shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Free energy vs. reaction coordinate, i.e., energy profile of cobalt replaced by manganese, for cobalt/Mn codoping (3.13 & 1.04%, respectively) with the OER taking place at various surface sites (Co, Fe, Mn) – cf. Fig. S5.† Also shown are results for cobalt monodoping (4.16%) – cf. Fig. S4† – with OER at iron and cobalt sites. 
Cobalt replaced by osmium
In an effort to better the energy profile for cobalt monodoping, given that addition of manganese did not achieve this, we then placed an osmium atom in lieu of a cobalt atom in Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) – cf. Fig. S5† – and the construction of the energy profile was done for the reaction atop three different atomic surface sites – Fe, Co and Os (cf.Fig. 5). OER taking place at the Co and Fe surface sites increased the reaction sub-step energies, whereas for OER atop the Os site, they decreased the sub-reaction energies into the negative. So, in the latter case for the OER atop the osmium surface site, this is not thermodynamically favourable, as the dark-green plot in Fig. 5 shows vividly.
 Fig. 5  Free energy vs. reaction coordinate: energy profile of cobalt replaced by osmium, with cobalt/Os codoping at 3.13 & 1.04%, respectively, with the OER taking place at various surface sites (Co, Fe, Os) – cf. Fig. S5.† For reference, OER at iron and cobalt surface sites is also shown for cobalt monodoping (∼4.16%) in red and orange. 
Cobalt replaced by ruthenium
With neither Mn- nor Os-codoping conferring OER improvement vis-à-vis Co-monodoping (at least on a cobalt-replacement basis), we next turned our codoping attention towards ruthenium in lieu of cobalt for the Fe3Co(PO4)4(010) surfaces. Here, we carried out energy profile-searching at three different surface sites (Fe, Co, Ru) and compared it with both the pure and Co-monodoped system. Compared to the pure case, the Fe site was found to catalyse step II by 0.17 eV (see Table S1†), the step-III reaction by 0.09 eV, and step IV by 0.32 eV (cf.Fig. 6); for step I, the energy was higher by 0.05 eV. For OER at the cobalt site, step I is essentially the same as at Fe site; for step II, the energy is 0.06 eV less than the Co-monodoped Fe3PO4(010) surfaces. As compared to the Co-doped system, in step III, the value is 0.20 eV less, whilst for step IV, it is 0.59 eV less (cf.Fig. 6). OER atop the ruthenium per se results in substantially lower energy values, and thus this is not energetically favorable on Ru surface site for OER reactions. As the reaction occurs on Co and Fe sites, the system doped with ruthenium is energetically favorable.

Fig. S5.† For reference, OER at iron and cobalt surface sites is also shown for cobalt monodoping (∼4.16%) in red and orange. 
Iron replaced by osmium
Given the promising OER ‘success’ (at least from DFT) of cobalt-monodoping, but the relative lack of success in terms of codoping by replacing cobalt atoms with transition-metal dopants, we return to their codoping with cobalt, but in replacing an iron atom instead, so as to have 4.16 and 1.06 mol% dopant concentrations for cobalt and the transition metal, respectively (cf. Fig. S6, ESI†). As before, three surface sites (Fe, Co and Os) were used as an underlying ‘scaffold’ for the OER steps and following all of the DFT geometry-optimisation steps for each configuration, the energy profile (based on reaction free energies) for the sequence of sub-steps was computed. In Fig. 7, for iron being replaced by osmium, we see that OER atop the Co surface sites served to decrease the over-potential to 0.36 eV (see Table S2†) so it is favorable for OER reaction, whilst, in contrast, at the Os and Fe sites, the overpotential was 2.92 eV and 2.45 eV respectively, so this Os and Fe sites are not energetically beneficial for OER reaction.
 Fig. 7  Free energy vs. reaction coordinate: energy profile of iron replaced by osmium, with cobalt/Os codoping at 4.16 & 1.04%, respectively, with the OER taking place at various surface sites (Co, Fe, Os) – cf. Fig. S6.† For reference, OER at iron and cobalt surface sites is also shown for cobalt monodoping (∼4.16%) in red and orange. 
Iron replaced by iridium
Turning to iridium as the next such candidate in our “iron-replacement, codoping” strategy (again, cf. Fig. S6†), we studied OER's energy–profile atop the three surface sites (Fe, Co and Ir) – cf.Fig. 8. At the Co and Fe sites, the ΔG was increased, and at the Ir site, it was decreased by 3.14 eV in the first step of the reaction – so, once again, the OER reaction is not energetically advantageous.
 Fig. 8  Free energy vs. reaction coordinate: energy profile of iron replaced by iridium, with cobalt/Ir codoping at 4.16 & 1.04%, respectively, with the OER taking place at various surface sites (Co, Fe, Ir) – cf. Fig. S6.† For reference, OER at iron and cobalt surface sites is also shown for cobalt monodoping (∼4.16%) in red and orange. 
Iron replaced by rhodium
To measure the energy profile for the iron replaced-by-rhodium codoped system (as above for iron replaced by both osmium and iridium), three surface sites were again used (Fe, Co, Rh). As Fig. 9. shows, OER atop the Fe site served to increase the over-potential, whilst that at the Co and Rh sites decreased it negatively in the first step of the reaction – rendering the OER reaction thermodynamically unviable in those cases.

Conclusions
A series of (010) surfaces of Fe1−xMxCo(PO4)4(010) and Fe3Co1−xMx(PO4)4(010) (M = Mn, Os, Ru, Rh and Ir)-doped electro-catalysts have been modelled; in all codoped slabs, the introduction of new impurity bands were observed straddling the band-gap area. These impurity bands help in changing and modulating the electronic properties and photocatalytic performances of Fe3M(PO4)4(010) surfaces. Further prospects for OER were analysed systematically via DFT calculations. The charge-density effect of the dopants was compared, indicating that OER might, in some cases, be viable, as ref. 26 found. However, subtle intricacies in free-energy profiles of individual sub-step reactions were found to be influenced heavily by the underlying surface-adsorption location, beyond cobalt mono-doping (or, indeed, co-doping with transition metals). Overall trends at the dopant site, Fe-site, and Co-site are shown in Fig. S8.† Considering the energy profiles, iron replaced by osmium shows an unambiguous and striking catalysing effect for all of the OER sub-steps reaction – at Co surface sites. Following that the cobalt replaced with ruthenium shows good catalysing effect on both Co and Fe sites, the overpotentials for all the reactive steps are shown in ESI† Table S2.
Of course, experimental studies are needed to confirm these computationally predicted (co-) doped systems for OER, although this study has showcased the power of state-of-the-art DFT as a predictive computational materials-design tool. In future, the electrochemical stability of the material is critical factor determining a material's performance and lifetime in aqueous environments. Electrochemical phase diagrams (Pourbaix diagram)35–37 with respect to many ubiquitous environmental parameters (e.g., solution pH, electrode potential, aqueous ion concentration and dissolved gases) can be used to effectively understand and predict many stability trends of materials under complex and variable corrosion environments, including reduction, oxidation, and dissolution trends.38 Using such computational approaches as advocated by Singh et al. will manage the computational demands for such in silico Pourbaix predictions.39 Also, it will be interesting to study AIMD at the cobalt-swapped-for-ruthenium surfaces to understand OER dynamics more clearly.
