, Accepted 17th June 2023First published on 21st June 2023AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials with intrinsic electric fields (EF) are considered promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting, but are still restricted by the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Here, we designed and investigated the derived 2D MNX3 and MNXY2 (M, N = In/Ga/Al; X, Y = S/Se/Te) monolayers as potential photocatalysts for water splitting applications. The light absorption of most MNX3/MNXY2 derivatives is significantly enhanced compared with their parent M2X3 monolayers. The introduction of Te with more diffuse valence orbitals than S/Se can effectively reduce the band gap of the MNX3/MNXY2 derivatives, enhancing their light absorption abilities. Some 2D MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers with STH efficiencies ≥20% are further screened. Interestingly, driven by vacancy defects, the GaAlSSe2-β monolayer can achieve the overall water-splitting process purely by the photoexcited carriers without the need for cocatalysts. Our work provides a prospective strategy for designing new highly efficient photocatalysts for water splitting applications based on the available parent materials by modulating the synergistic relation of bandgap, intrinsic EF, and overpotential.
1. Introduction
The development of clean and sustainable hydrogen energy sources is crucial to alleviate the current energy and environmental crises. Hydrogen production by photocatalytic water splitting, as a green energy carrier, provides a leading method to store inexhaustible solar energy.1–3 The low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency is the most important factor restricting the development of water-splitting photocatalysts,4 which is determined by three aspects: (i) light harvesting: the band gap of photocatalysts normally should be >1.23 eV (<1000 nm), resulting in a direct loss in the infrared light utilization;5 (ii) photogenerated carrier separation and migration: to restrain the recombination of electron–hole pairs, photoinduced charges in photocatalysts must be effectively separated, and must move toward the photocatalyst surfaces to allow for the evolution of hydrogen and/or oxygen at the corresponding photocatalytic active sites;6 (iii) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER): both the reduction and oxidation potentials of water should be inside the photocatalyst's band gap. And, a certain overpotential is required to drive the catalytic reaction.7 Hence, improving the energy conversion efficiency requires simultaneous improvements in all these three aspects of photocatalytic water splitting.
To overcome the restrictions mentioned above, a novel and advanced mechanism for water splitting has been proposed for two-dimensional (2D) materials with a vertical intrinsic electric field (EF).8 Due to the existence of vacuum energy level difference, the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 on the two surfaces are shifted. This can remove the constraint of a band gap larger than 1.23 eV, making the utilization of infrared light possible. Moreover, the intrinsic EF in the 2D materials significantly accelerates the separation and migration of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In this respect, some 2D materials with a broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry have been intensively investigated, including Janus transition metal dichalcogenides,9,10 group-III di-/tri-chalcogenides,11,12 and germanium monochalcogenide,13 etc. A recent report verified M2X3 (M = In/Ga/Al, X = S/Se/Te) monolayers to be available water-splitting photocatalysts,14 and some of them have been recently fabricated using various experimental techniques.15–17 It is widely known that the MoSSe monolayer, as a derivative of MoS2, raised remarkable attention because of its unique structure and superior physicochemical properties, making it a stronger potential for many applications.9,18 On the one hand, motivated by the pioneering progress of MoSSe, the design and investigation of 2D M2X3 derivatives for water splitting applications are intriguing and worth exploring, which has significant implications for creating new materials based on available parent materials. On the other hand, we notice that M2Te3 (In2X3) possesses smaller band gaps compared with M2S3/M2Se3 (Ga2X3/Al2X3), and their conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are mainly distributed in the top two layers and the bottom three layers, respectively (see Fig. 1);14 this makes it possible to regulate the band gap and thus the STH efficiency via changing chemically similar elements in atomic layer(s). However, the synergistic effects of bandgap, intrinsic EF, and overpotential on the photocatalytic water splitting reaction of parent 2D M2X3 and their derivatives have not been sufficiently investigated and elucidated.

Here, the α and β phases of the MNXY2 monolayers are further divided in three types (I–III), respectively. The atomic radius of the M element is always larger than that of the N element. The dashed rhombuses represent the unit cell of monolayers. h and l represent the total height of the monolayer system and interlayer distance between two Group-III metal layers, respectively. 
In this work, we systematically explored a series of 2D M2X3-derived MNX3 and MNXY2 (M, N = In/Ga/Al; X, Y = S/Se/Te) monolayers as potential water-splitting photocatalysts. Compared with the parent M2X3 monolayer, the light absorption of most MNX3 and MNXY2 derivatives is significantly enhanced, showing stronger competitiveness as promising water splitting photocatalysts. Excitingly, the InGaTe3-α and InAlSeTe2-β monolayers can achieve high STH efficiencies of 33.7% and 36.6% driven by infrared light, respectively. Interestingly, assisted by vacancy defects, the InGaTe3-α and GaAlSSe2-β monolayers with the STH efficiencies >23% can solely achieve the HER process by the photoexcited electrons, and the GaAlSSe2-β (23.4%) can achieve the overall water splitting without the need for cocatalysts. The synergistic effects of bandgap, intrinsic EF, and overpotential on the photocatalytic water splitting reaction of parent 2D M2X3 and their derivatives are elaborated. Our work offers a potential method for developing brand-new, highly effective photocatalysts for water splitting based on available parent materials.
2. Theoretical calculation methods
All theoretical calculations are performed based on density functional theory (DFT) with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method19 using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).20–22 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used to evaluate exchange-correlation energy.23 The energy cutoff is set to 450 eV for the plane-wave expansion of electron wave functions. The convergence tolerance of the total energy of systems and the Hellman–Feynman forces acting on each ion are less than 10−6 eV and −0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. To accurately evaluate the bandgaps, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is employed to calculate the electronic structures of all structures.24 An 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-points grid is used to sample the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. A vacuum space greater than 15 Å is applied to eliminate the interactions between neighboring images. Dipole correction is considered because of the asymmetric structures. Previous work has demonstrated that the effect of spin-orbital coupling (SOC) on the band structure of the In2Te3 monolayer is negligible, even though both In and Te are heavy atoms.14 Hence, we do not include the SOC correction in the HSE06 electronic structure calculations.
The formation energy (Eform) of monolayers is calculated by 
(1)where, Etotal is the total energy of the monolayer in the unit cell, ni is the number of atoms i in the monolayer, and μi is the chemical potential of atom i in its bulk materials.
The STH efficiency (ηSTH) is evaluated by the efficiency of light absorption (ηabs) and the efficiency of carrier utilization (ηcu), i.e., ηSTH = ηabs × ηcu.14
ηabs is defined as:25 
(2)Here, hν is the photon energy, P is the AM1.5G solar energy flux, and Eg is the band gap of materials. The denominator and numerator represent the total and absorbed power densities of sunlight, respectively.
ηcu is defined as 
(3)Here, ΔG is the free energy difference for water splitting reaction. Eg is the band gap of materials by HSE06 hybrid functional and E represents the energy of photons that can actually be employed to water splitting. The numerator represents the effective photocurrent density. Assuming the required overpotentials are 0.2 and 0.6 eV for HER and OER, respectively,14,26 E is determined by 
(4)Here, χ(H2) and χ(O2) are the overpotentials for the HER and OER (see Fig. 2) and represent the redox abilities of photogenerated carriers, which are defined as the potential difference between the CBM and redox potential of H+/H2 and the potential difference between the VBM and redox potential of H2O/O2, respectively. Since intrinsic EF does positive work for electron–hole separation during the photocatalytic water splitting process, the corrected STH efficiency  of the 2D materials with intrinsic EF is calculated by 
(5)where, ΔΦ is the electrostatic potential difference between the two surfaces.

The green dashed lines represent the redox potentials of the hydrogen evolution reaction HER(H+/H2) and oxygen evolution reaction OER(O2/H2O). The χ(H2) and χ(O2) represent the overpotentials for the HER and OER of these monolayers, respectively. 
The hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) in the hydrogen reduction reaction is evaluated by27,28 
ΔGH* = ΔEH* + ΔEZPE − TΔS
(6)Here, ΔEH* is the hydrogen chemisorption energy, ΔEZPE and ΔS are the differences of zero-point energies and entropies between the adsorbed and free hydrogens, respectively. T is the absolute temperature of the reaction system (T = 298.15 K).
The enthalpy of solvation (ΔHsol) can be used to evaluate the stability of system in water. Once compound AxByCz(s) dissolves in water, the following solvation reaction will be involved: 
AxByCz(s) ⇌ xA+(aq) + yB+(aq) + zC−(aq)
(7)
The solvation reaction consists of two steps: 
AxByCz(s) ⇌ xA(g) + yB(g) + zC(g)
(8) 
xA(g) +yB(g) + zC(g) → xA+(aq) + yB+(aq) + zC−(aq)
(9)Here, A+(aq), B+(aq) and C−(aq) are A, B and C ions in the aqueous solution, A(g), B(g) and C(g) are isolated A, B and C atoms in gas phase, respectively. Then, ΔHsol is evaluated by the sum of the cohesive energy (ΔEcoh) of the AxByCz(s) compound and the energy change from gas atoms xA(g),yB(g) and zC(g) to hydrated ions (ΔHhyd); a higher ΔHsol indicates a better stability of the relevant system in water. ΔEcoh is calculated by using the PBE functional based on eqn (8), which is implemented in the VASP code.20–22 While, based on eqn (9), ΔHhyd is determined by Gaussian16 software together with the Def2QZVP basis set and the M062X functional,29 and the SMD solvation model is used to describe the solute–solvent interaction.30
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometrical and electronic structures of the derived MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers
3.1.1 The MNX3 monolayers. As shown in Fig. 1, the Group-III trichalcogenide M2X3 monolayer (M = In/Ga/Al, X = S/Se/Te) has a hexagonal symmetry made up of five atomic layers stacked in the order of X–M–X–M–X, in which the metal atoms in the two M atomic layers are octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated, respectively. The top/bottom layers represent two inequivalent surfaces of materials. Stemmed from the parent M2X3 monolayer, we designed the two derived MNX3 and MNXY2 (N = In/Ga/Al, having a smaller atomic radius than M; Y = S/Se/Te ≠ X) monolayers, including the α and β phases in which N substitutes the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated M, respectively (see Fig. 1). Their schematic diagram of energy levels and photocatalytic water splitting mechanism are illustrated in Fig. 2. Due to the existence of the vacuum level difference between the two surfaces, the CBM and VBM alignments with respect to the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2 are shifted. Then, the force of the intrinsic EF improves the migration of photoexcited electrons (holes) to the top (bottom) layer under solar light irradiation, participating in the HER (OER) reaction.To systematically investigate the Group-III trichalcogenide family, the geometrical and electronic structures of the derived MNX3 monolayers are firstly optimized and calculated (see Fig. 3, S1, S2 and Table S1†). As given in Table S1,† we can see that the lattice constants of MNX3 monolayers, varying from 3.61 to 4.28 Å, are increased when X changes from S to Te and are largest in InGaX3 among the three possible MN choices. Furthermore, the lattice constant in the α phase is always larger than that in the β phase, showing the influence of the position of M-atomic layer substitution. The formation energy (Eform) of the MNX3 monolayers ranges between −0.41 and −0.99 eV per atom. Interestingly, from the perspective of Eform (see Table S1†), we see that the α phase is more favorable than the β phase for InGaX3 and InAlX3, whereas GaAlX3 gives the opposite situation. One may well ask why the Eform of MNX3 shows the above phase-dependence. Notably, for MNX3, the smaller the M-N interlayer distance (l), the lower the Eform of the α and β phases (see Table S1†). Taking InGaS3-α/β and GaAlTe3-α/β as examples, we further analyzed the interatomic covalent interactions (the middle X atom with M and N, i.e., X–M and X–N bonds) within the scope of l based on the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) framework31 (see Fig. S3†). As mentioned by Dronskowski et al.,32 the covalent interactions are stabilized mainly from the tetrahedrally coordinated atoms (no significant antibonding contributions below the Fermi level) compared with those in the octahedral coordination; the contribution by the octahedrally coordinated atoms cannot be ignored, even though some unfavorable antibonding contributions are involved. Indeed, the integral –COHP values (–ICOHP) show that the stability of structures is codetermined by the tetrahedral and octahedral coordination bonds within the scope of l.

(b) The plane-averaged electrostatic differences of the MNX3 monolayers. (c) The band alignments of the MNX3 monolayers. The green and blue solid lines represent the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2, respectively. The overpotentials for the OER (χ(O2)) and HER (χ(H2)) are labeled by values (in eV). And the lower oxidation potential of OER is set to zero. 
The electronic band structures of the MNX3 monolayers under the HSE06 hybrid functional are further calculated (see Fig. S1 and Table S1†). The band gap values of the MNX3 monolayers range from 0.68 to 2.80 eV, showing an indirect band gap character in most cases except InAlS3-α and InAlSe3-α. It should be mentioned that a large band gap (>1.8 eV) of materials, e.g., InAlS3-β and GaAlS3-β, should be unfavorable for sunlight absorption. Fig. 3a shows the dependence of band gaps with chalcogen element X in various MNX3 monolayers. Similar to the situation of the M2X3 monolayers,14 the band gap in MNX3 decreases largely when X changes from S to Te, no matter whether in the α or β phase. Actually, from S to Te, the more and more diffuse valence orbital is expected to covalently interact more and more weakly with M/N (see Fig. S4†), which decreases the energy difference between bonding and antibonding orbitals and explains the variation of the band gaps. For a specific MNX3 monolayer, the β phase always predicts a larger band gap than the α phase. Compared with the MNSe3 and MNTe3 groups, the MNS3 group, whether α or β phase, exhibits a larger band gap, which is unfavorable for improving its sunlight absorption range and efficiency. Meanwhile, the MNS3 group shows the largest difference of electrostatic potential among the three ones, which will also slightly weaken their STH efficiency. Thus, although having a suitable edge position, the MNS3 system has few advantages among the MNX3 group in the STH efficiency.
Similar to the situation of MX3, the MNX3 monolayers also hold an asymmetric structure, and the intensity of EF along the Z direction can be evaluated by the resulting plane-averaged electrostatic potential differences (ΔΦ) (see Fig. S2 and Table S1†). The EF in all MNX3 monolayers is directed from the top layer to the bottom layer (see Fig. 2), and the intensity varies from 0.82 to 2.07 eV. This is consistent with the previous Mulliken charge calculation results that more electrons tend to accumulate in the bottom layer (i.e., near the octahedrally coordinated Group-III metal atoms).32 From Fig. 3b, like the trend of the band gap, the ΔΦ of the MNX3 monolayers decreases from S to Te. For InGaX3, the ΔΦ of the α phase is larger than that of the β phase, whereas GaAlX3 predicts a reverse order; no identical trend is observed for the two phases of InAlX3 (the β phase is slightly larger for X = Se and Te; whereas for S, the α phase is larger). In fact, the ΔΦ of a material is linked to its composition and surface charge redistribution.33,34 As mentioned above, the electrons tend to accumulate near the region of the octahedrally coordinated Group-III metal atoms, determined by the electronegativity in the accumulation region (Al1.61 < In1.78 < Ga1.81, Te2.12 < Se2.55 < S2.58).35 In InGaX3, the octahedral coordination center involves In with smaller electronegativity in the α phase and the larger-electronegativity Ga in the β phase; whereas in GaAlX3-α involved are the larger-electronegativity Ga atoms.
As depicted in Fig. 2, the overpotentials of HER χ(H2) and OER χ(O2) on the different surfaces are important criteria to evaluate the redox abilities of photogenerated electrons/holes during the water splitting process. Thus, the χ(H2) and χ(O2) of the MNX3 monolayers are further obtained (see Fig. 3c and Table S1†). We can see that the CBMs and VBMs of all MNX3 monolayers except GaAlTe3-α straddle the water redox potentials, feasible for the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. It is worth noting that although some systems, such as InGaS3-β, InAlS3-β and GaAlS3-β, exhibit large overpotentials, the large band gap could affect the STH efficiency to a large extent. Importantly, the InGaTe3-α monolayer shows great potential as photocatalyst for water splitting applications, because it not only possesses a narrow band gap of 0.68 eV, but also exhibits a suitable band edge alignment.

3.1.2 The MNXY2 monolayers. Given the successful fabrication of MoSSe with promising performance beyond MoS2/MoSe2 by replacing the bottom-layer S (Se) atoms with Se (S) atoms, the MNXY2 (X, Y = S/Se/Te) monolayers are further constructed based on MNX3, which can be classified into three types: InGaXY2, InAlXY2 and GaAlXY2. Notably, as shown in Fig. 1, the α and β phases of each MNXY2 monolayer can be further divided in three possible types (I–III), respectively (all 108 types), we firstly screen the most-stable 36 types under a same chemical composition by formation energy calculations, which are regarded as the most concerning research object of consideration (see Tables S2–S4†). Then, we go on to evaluate the geometrical and electronic structures of all the most stable MNXY2 monolayers.For the InGaXY2 monolayers (see Fig. S5, S6 and Table S2†), we find the optimized lattice constants of the α phase are slightly larger than those of the β phase, with the largest and smallest lattice constants in InGaSeTe2-α and InGaSeS2-β, respectively. The Eform of these monolayers ranges from −0.44 and −0.74 eV per atom. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4a, under the HSE06 hybrid functional, all monolayers exhibit semiconducting properties with the band gap in 0.38–2.52 eV. Particularly, the InGaSSe2-α, InGaSTe2-α/β, InGaTeSe2-β and InGaSeTe2-α monolayers are direct band gap materials (see Fig. S5 and Table S2†). The ΔΦs of the InGaXY2 monolayers are also calculated (see Fig. S6 and Table S2†). From Fig. 4a, we notice that InGaXY2 (RX > RY) a has larger band gap and ΔΦ than InGaXY2 (RX < RY) (RX and RY represent the atomic radius of chalcogen elements), e.g., InGaSeS2 vs. InGaSSe2 and InGaTeS2 vs. InGaSTe2. InGaTeS2-β and InGaSeTe2-β exhibit a negative overpotential for OER (χ(O2)) or HER (χ(H2)) due to the excessively narrow band gaps, demonstrating the unsuitability for water splitting (see Fig. 4b). By contrast, InGaSSe2-α and InGaTeSe2-β show visible overpotential under acceptable band gaps, which on this point is favorable for water splitting (see Fig. 4b).
 Fig. 4  The band gaps, plane-averaged electrostatic differences, and band alignments for the MNXY2 (M, N = In/Ga/Al; X, Y = S/Se/Te) monolayers (α and β phases), including (a and b) InGaXY2, (c and d) InAlXY2 and (e and f) GaAlXY2. Here, the green and blue solid lines represent the redox potentials of H+/H2 and H2O/O2, respectively. The overpotentials for the OER (χ(O2)) and HER (χ(H2)) are labeled by values (in eV). And the lower oxidation potential of OER is set to zero. 
For InAlXY2 (see Figs. S7, S8 and Table S3†), the lattice constants vary from 3.73 to 4.14 Å. Except for InAlTeS2-α/β (metallic), all InAlXY2 monolayers present semiconducting properties under the HSE06 hybrid functional, and the band gap spans a wide range from 0.30 to 2.66 eV (see Fig. 4c and S7†). From Fig. 4c, we can see that the InAlXY2 (Rx > RY) monolayer, like the situation of InGaXY2, also has a larger ΔΦ than InAlXY2 (Rx < RY). For InAlXY2 (Rx > RY) or InAlXY2 (Rx < RY), their band gaps and ΔΦs do not show a regular variation trend, which are diametrically different from the situation of InGaXY2 systems. Note that, the overlarge band gap leads InAlSeS2-β to lose its advantage in photocatalytic efficiency. The overpotentials of HER χ(H2) and OER χ(O2) are further evaluated (see Fig. 4d). Significantly, the InAlSeS2-α monolayer not only shows a narrow band gap but also possesses large χ(H2) and χ(O2), which is conducive to absorb infrared light and achieves the solar-driven water splitting.
For GaAlXY2 (see Figs. S9, S10 and Table S4†), the optimized lattice constants of the α phase are also slightly larger than those of the β phase. In addition to the metallic GaAlTeS2-α monolayer, the others are all indirect band-gap semiconductors with a band gap in the range of 0.74–3.01 eV (see Fig. 4e and S9†). Overall, the GaAlXY2 (Rx > RY) monolayers also have larger band gaps and ΔΦs than GaAlXY2 (Rx < RY) (see Fig. 4e). The largest ΔΦ (2.44 eV) exists in GaAlTeS2-β. In addition, compared with the value of the α phase, the band gap of the β phase of GaAlXY2 (Rx > RY) is larger (see Fig. 4e). Notably, the GaAlSeTe2-β monolayer possesses suitable band gap and large overpotentials χ(H2) over 1.0 eV and χ(O2) about 0.5 eV (see Fig. 4e and f), ensuring enough driving force to trigger the HER/OER process.
We also evaluate the stability of the 2D derivatives. Taking GaAlS3-α/β and the GaAlSSe2-α/β as typical examples of these 2D MNX3 and MNXY2, AIMD simulations at 300 K and phonon spectra calculations are performed on these systems (see Fig. S11†). During the AIMD simulations, both the total energy and temperature only oscillate within small ranges, and all atoms are vibrating around their equilibrium positions. Meanwhile, the phonon dispersions show that there are negligible imaginary frequencies in the Brillouin zone. The above results well demonstrate the thermodynamic and dynamical stabilities of these derivatives.

3.2. STH efficiencies of the derived MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers
To comprehensively evaluate the photocatalytic performance in energy conversion of group-III trichalcogenide derivatives, the ηabs, ηcu, ηSTH and  of all MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers are calculated by eqn (2)–(5), as listed in Tables S5–S8.† For the MNX3 monolayers (see Table S5†), we can see that the  of InGaS3-α/β, InGaSe3-α/β, InAlTe3-α/β, InAlSe3-α and GaAlTe3-β are larger than 20%, which benefit from both the high ηabs and ηcu, and surpass the conventional theoretical limit of about 18%. It must be mentioned that the  proposed by Yang et al.14 represents the theoretical upper limit of energy conversion efficiency under ideal conditions. Although it cannot be directly compared to the experimental data, it is significant to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency.14,36 For a serious of MNXY2 monolayers (see Tables S6–S8†), the  of the InGaXY2 (InGaSSe2-α/β, InGaSTe2-α, InGaSeTe2-α and InGaTeSe2-β), InAlXY2 (InAlSeS2-α, InAlSeTe2-β and InAlTeSe2-β) and GaAlXY2 (GaAlSTe2-α/β and GaAlSeTe2-α/β) monolayers can reach 20%. Especially, the  of InGaTe3-α, InGaSSe2-α and InAlSeTe2-β can achieve 33.7%, 32.0% and 36.6%, respectively, larger than the theoretical values of the parent M2X3 monolayers (see Table S9†). The higher theoretical limit of  of the MNXY2 materials is attributed to the excellent light absorption efficiency caused by quite a small band gap, which is directly revealed in the light absorption coefficient calculations below. Here, the band structures and ΔΦs of intrinsic M2X3 are also displayed in Figs. S12, S13 and Table S10†, which agree well with previous reports,11,14 suggest the credibility of the present computations.
Furthermore, we obtain the  maps as a function of band gap and ΔΦ and as a function of χ(O2) and χ(H2) for all the MNX3 (see Fig. 5a and b) and MNXY2 monolayers (see Fig. 5c–h). As one can see, whether MNX3 or MNXY2, once the band gap is larger than 1.8 eV, it would be very difficult to achieve a high-efficiency value of  (see Fig. 5a, c, 5e and 5g). Compared with the band gap, ΔΦ has a less effect on , but a larger ΔΦ still leads to a slightly lowered  under a similar band gap, such as InGaSeS2-α (14.3%) vs. InGaTeSe2-α (14.8%), GaAlSTe2-α (24.2%) vs. GaAlSTe2-β (23.3%) (see Fig. 5c, g, Tables S6 and S8†). We also notice that there is no obvious linear relationship between  and overpotentials χ(O2) and χ(H2) (see Fig. 5b, d, 5f and 5h). Although larger χ(H2) and χ(O2) represent stronger redox abilities of photoinduced carriers, the overlarge value of χ(H2) (>1.0 eV) and χ(O2) (>1.5 eV) is counterproductive to the increase of , with roots going back to their overlarge band gaps. From Fig. 5, we can see that the  of InGaXY2 and InAlXY2 are higher than that of GaAlXY2. From the viewpoint of , MNX3 (except for MNS3) is more competitive for water splitting than MNXY2, which provides significant insights into experimental materials synthesis.

M, N = In/Ga/Al; X, Y = S/Se/Te. 
3.3. Charge separation and light absorption
Besides the suitable band gap and band edge positions, charge separation also is critical to affecting the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts. The spatial distributions of charge densities in the CBM and VBM of the MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers with  ≥ 20% are further examined. Among the 21 candidates, two (GaAlSTe2-α and GaAlSeTe2-α) are not consistent with the desired distribution of photoexcited carriers, i.e., the CBM and VBM are contributed by the bottom and top layers, respectively (Fig. S14†). Such a spatial distribution of CBM and VBM doesn't effectively promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and thereby result in the low  of the photocatalysts. Fortunately, for other monolayers, the CBM and VBM originate from the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. Here, the orbital-projected band structures and partial charge densities of CBM and VBM for the four typical MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers (i.e., InGaTe3-α, InGaSSe2-β, InAlSeTe2-β and GaAlSSe2-β) are shown in Fig. 6a. Combining the direct-viewing schematic diagrams of the atomic layer structures for the MNX3-α monolayers (see Fig. 6b), we can find that the CBM is contributed by the top layer of GaTe (X1N), while the VBM originates from the bottom layer of InTe2 (X2MX2), which means that the photogenerated electrons and holes are spatially separated. Meanwhile, the top-to-bottom directed EF further facilitates the spatial separation and transfer of the photogenerated carriers to the top/bottom surfaces taking part in the HER/OER on InGaTe3-α. A similar situation also occurs in the InGaSSe2-β, InAlSeTe2-β and GaAlSSe2-β monolayers (see Fig. 6). The MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers with excellent photocatalytic performance are listed in Table 1.

By the complex dielectric function at the DFT-HSE06 level, we evaluated the light absorption coefficients of MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers with the maximum  as shown in Fig. 7. The absorption coefficients of the parent MX3 monolayers are also provided in the figure for comparison. We can notice that the Ga2Te3 monolayer shows a higher light absorption coefficient in the visible light region than both InGaTe3-α and In2Te3, but the unsuitable band edge position (negative χ(O2)) limits it as a water splitting photocatalyst (see Table S10†). Despite the slight decrease in the light absorption coefficient in the derived InGaTe3-α monolayer (see Fig. 7a), the band edge straddling the water redox potentials (see Fig. 3c) shows its potential as a promising photocatalyst. For InGaSSe2-β, InAlSeTe2-β and GaAlSSe2-β (see Fig. 7b–d), the light absorption coefficient in the visible light region is enhanced, as compared to the respective parent MX3 monolayers. Also, their absorption edge is extended to the infrared light region, dominated in the solar spectrum, which is closely associated with their band gap <1.62 eV. We also notice that these different monolayers show a large difference in the light absorption coefficients (e.g., InGaTe3-α vs. GaAlSSe2-β), which is closely related to their parent materials (see Fig. 7a–d). Due to the large band gap of Ga2S3 (2.59 eV), Al2S3 (2.90 eV) and Al2Se3 (2.38 eV), these monolayers are hard to exhibit large light absorption, which also directly causes a limited light absorption of the derived GaAlSSe2-β. Whereas, the M2Te3 (M = In, Ga, Al) have better optical absorption than M2S3 and M2Se3 as a result of the smaller band gaps, which makes the derived InGaTe3-α much more favorable in light absorption. The light absorption ability of the constructed MNX3 and MNXY2 derived materials is indeed superior to that of the parent M2X3 monolayers, which would have a significant impact on the solar energy utilization and photocatalytic efficiency for water splitting. In addition, to further assess the stabilities of these monolayers (STH efficiency ≥20%) in water, we further calculate their enthalpies of solvation ΔHsol. Fig. S15† shows the calculated enthalpies of solvation ΔHsol of the 19 MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers, the solvation enthalpies are all larger than 300 kJ mol−1, and most of them are over 400 kJ mol−1, higher than some known poorly soluble compounds,37 implying their good stabilities in water.

3.4. Gibbs free energy ΔGH* in HER
Although the suitable band edges are essential for photocatalysts, it is not enough to guarantee the occurrence of a water splitting reaction. The photoexcited electron/hole should provide a sufficient driving force to trigger the HER/OER process, otherwise, extra processing, such as introducing cocatalysts, should be applied to overcome the activation energy and ensure the redox reaction proceeds.38 The Gibbs free energy ΔGH* is an effective descriptor to evaluate the HER catalytic activity, and can be used to evaluate whether the water splitting process can proceed under the impetus of photoexcited carriers.27,28 Thus, to better verify the hydrogen production abilities of the photocatalysts, taking the above four typical monolayers (InGaTe3α, InGaSSe2-β, InAlSeTe2-β and GaAlSSe2-β) as examples, we first evaluated the HER for the perfect structures of these monolayers (see Fig. S16†). As mentioned above, the HER needs to occur in the top layer of these materials due to the transfer of photoexcited electrons (see Fig. 1). From Fig. S16,† we can see that the H atom prefers the top site of a chalcogen atom (S/Se/Te) of the monolayers except for GaAlSSe2-β (the top site of metal atom Ga), unfortunately, the HER on these four perfect structures need at least 1.63 V of |ΔGH*| (even up to 2.47 V on InGaSSe2-β), much larger than the highest potential of the photoexcited electrons (Ue = 0.64 V) of these four monolayers (see Table 1). Here, Ue is the potential of photoexcited electrons for HER (i.e., χ(H2)).39,40 Such high |ΔGH*| suggest that the basal planes of the MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers are inert for HER (similar to MoS2),41 and also demonstrate that the HER is hard to be individually driven by the photoexcited electrons in the perfect MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers without extra treatments.
As is known to all, defect engineering has been proven to be an efficient way of activating the basal plane and increasing the HER catalytic activity.12,18,42,43 To improve the reactivity of the surfaces, we introduced the conventional vacancy defect into the four typical monolayers, including the chalcogen and metal atom vacancies. The maximum and minimum formation energies of 3.85 eV and 2.03 eV for a single vacancy in four systems (Fig. S17a†), significantly lower than the formation energy of 5.85 eV (7.6–7.9 eV) of a single sulfur (carbon) vacancy in MoS2 (graphene),44,45 indicate that it is energetically feasible to introduce these vacancies. In addition, the obvious charge redistributions around the vacancy can efficiently provide better catalytic active site for water splitting reaction (see Fig. S17b†).
From the Fig. 8a and b, when the vacancy defects are introduced in the surface of these materials, the calculated |ΔGH*|s drop significantly compared with those for the perfect structures. Notably, the |ΔGH*| of the InGaTe3-α monolayer with the VGa (VTe) vacancy defect is reduced to only 0.10 V (0.11 V), implying that the HER can be solely driven under the Ue of 0.28 V provided by the photoexcited electrons (see Fig. 3c, 8a, b and Table 1). Especially, for the GaAlSSe2-β monolayer, the photoexcited electrons can provide an Ue of 0.64 V, and the work potential can be successfully reduced to 0.62 V by VGa and even to 0.07 V by VS, and the HER process under light irradiation is possible (see Fig. 8a, b and Table 1). Meanwhile, for the water oxidation reaction, as shown in Fig. 8c, we can see that the limiting potential (i.e., the lowest working potential) is 1.75 V on GaAlSSe2-β with the vacancy defect of Al, and under the potential provided by the photogenerated holes Uh = 2.59 V (see Table 1), the free energy diagram shows a dropping trend for the water oxidation reaction (see Fig. 8c and d), implying GaAlSSe2-β driven by the vacancy defect can achieve the overall water splitting without using any cocatalysts. In addition, we notice that the |ΔGH*| of the InGaSSe2-β and InAlSeTe2-β monolayers are decreased by introducing vacancy defects, but not enough to trigger the HER by photoexcited electrons, which may need to be driven by some sacrificial reagents (see Fig. 8a, b and Table 1). It's undeniable that vacancy defects can effectively lower the overpotential of HER/OER to the levels that can be given by the photoexcited carriers, driving the overall water-splitting process without the need for cocatalysts.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, stemming from the parent M2X3 materials, the derived MNX3 and MNXY2 materials are designed and further explored the possibilities as water-splitting photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Most derived MNX3/MNXY2 monolayers show enhanced light absorption compared with the M2X3 monolayers. Notably, the introduction of Te with more diffuse valence orbitals than S/Se can effectively reduce the band gaps of the MNX3 derivatives and thereby enhance their light absorption abilities. The band gaps of the MNX3/MNXY2 monolayers have a more obvious effect on the STH efficiencies than the intrinsic EF. Once the band gaps of the MNX3 and MNXY2 monolayers are greater than 1.8 eV, the high STH efficiencies will be hardly achieved. Meanwhile, the EF is found to have limited influence on improving the STH efficiency of photocatalysts, but it absolutely cannot be ignored in terms of altering the band alignment and accelerating charge separation. Some MNX3/MNXY2 monolayers with STH efficiencies of ≥20% are predicted. Interestingly, the vacancy point defect in the MNX3/MNXY2 monolayers can effectively lower the overpotential of the HER to the level that can be given by the photoexcited electrons, boosting the HER process without the need for cocatalysts. For example, the GaAlSSe2-β with the STH efficiency of 23.4% driven by vacancy defects can achieve overall water splitting without using any cocatalysts. This work provides a practice strategy to design new high-efficient photocatalysts for water splitting into hydrogen applications based on parent materials through regulating the synergistic relation of bandgap, EF and overpotential.
