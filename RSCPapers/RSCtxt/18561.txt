    , Accepted 22nd February 2021First published on 1st March 2021AbstractIn this work, we attempt to figure out alkoxy-substitution effects on two kinds of well-known non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), IDT-series and Y-series acceptors, by placing alkoxy side chains on the β-positions of the outer thiophene units. The resulting molecules, named IDTN-O and Y6-O, exhibit different properties compared to the original acceptors named IDTN and Y6. The HOMO and LUMO levels of IDTN-O are slightly upshifted at the same time, which causes a slightly higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) without sacrificing the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the devices. J71:IDTN-O blend films can also achieve a better blend morphology due to the conformational locking effect and higher dipole moment induced by the alkoxy groups, which helps achieve a higher fill factor (FF). In addition, Y6-O exhibits significantly upshifted LUMO levels compared to Y6, leading to a high Voc of 0.95 V. PM6:Y6-O blend films can also maintain an optimal blend morphology through side-chain engineering, which leads to an excellent FF of 78.0%. As a result of alkoxy substitution, both IDTN-O and Y6-O-based devices can achieve better performances of 12.1% and 16.6% than IDTN and Y6-based devices (10.9% and 15.7%), which indicates that this is an effective method to optimize these two types of NFAs.
In the past few years, great successes have been achieved in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) due to the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which contributes to achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 16%.1–8 Among numerous NFAs, indacenodithiophene (IDT)-series acceptors and Y-series acceptors have shown great potential for smart-city and indoor photovoltaic applications due to their tunable energy levels, simple synthetic processes and broad absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions.9–17 Fully understanding the structure–property relationship of these two types of NFAs is essential for further optimizing their molecular properties and boosting the device performances.
Typically, IDT-series acceptors have an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular architecture, where “A” represents electron-withdrawing end groups and “D” is a ladder-type donor core such as IDT and indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT).18–21 The optoelectronic properties of A–D–A acceptors are significantly affected by the electronic interaction between the ladder-type core and end groups. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to change the “D” part to various fused-ring electron-rich units22–25 or to functionalize the end groups to match different polymer donors.26–29 However, few reports have focused on the functionalization on the β-position of the outer thiophene unit in the IDT or IDTT cores, which can also have a great influence on the properties of the resulting molecules.30,31
Compared to IDT-series acceptors, the emerging Y-series acceptors show a different configuration of A–DA′D–A, which is incorporated with an electron-deficient unit in the central core.13,32,33 The alteration of donor and acceptor units can enhance intramolecular charge transfer to construct low-bandgap acceptors. In addition, nitrogen atoms are introduced as a bridge linking the D and A′ units together to form the conjugated backbone, whose lone electron pairs can delocalize along the backbone to further reduce the bandgap. The alkyl chain attached to the nitrogen bridge can provide appropriate steric hindrance to tune aggregation while maintaining charge mobility. Therefore, much effort has been made to modify the central electron-deficient units,34–39 inner side chains40–42 or end groups43–45 to obtain different kinds of Y-series acceptors. Another difference between IDT-series and Y-series acceptors is that alkyl substitution is always carried out at the β-position of the outer thiophene unit in the central core in Y-series acceptors, which can enhance the solubility of molecules and provide a so-called intramolecular conformational locking effect.46–49 However, little attention has been paid to tune the optoelectronic properties of Y-series acceptors via modifications at the β-position of the outer thiophene.50
In this work, an IDT-series acceptor named IDTN-O and a Y-series acceptor named Y6-O were designed and synthesized by adopting alkoxy substitution at the β-position of the outer thiophene unit in reported molecules named IDTN and Y6.51,52 We compared the properties of these two sets of acceptors to study the effect of alkoxy substitution, which yields completely different results. For IDT-series acceptors, it is found that alkoxy substitution slightly upshifts the LUMO and the HOMO levels simultaneously, which is beneficial for a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) without sacrificing short-circuit current density (Jsc). Besides, the alkoxy side chains have intramolecular conformational locking effects, which helps the J71:IDTN-O blends achieve a better morphology for higher mobility and fill factor (FF). Due to the substitution of methoxy side chains, OSCs based on J71:IDTN-O can achieve higher PCEs of 12.1% compared to J71:IDTN-based devices. However, for Y-series acceptors, alkoxy substitution can significantly upshift the LUMO level while maintaining the HOMO level, which enhances Voc but decreases the Jsc of the corresponding devices. In addition, the alkoxy groups have stronger intramolecular conformational locking effects compared with alkyl groups as well as increase the dipole moment of the resulting molecule, leading to excessive aggregation properties so that longer side chains are needed to obtain decent solubility for a good morphology and FF. As a result of alkoxy substitution, we achieve a highly efficient binary OSC based on Y6-O with a PCE of 16.6%. Our work demonstrates the structure–property relationship by alkoxy substitution at the β-position of the outer thiophene unit in both IDT-series and Y-series acceptors, which provides another effective method to modify the molecular structure of these two acceptors towards high-performance OSCs.
As shown in Fig. 1a, compared to the reported small molecule IDTN, the new IDTN-O has two methoxy groups at the β positions of outer thiophene units. For the modification of Y6, in our first attempt, we only replaced the undecyl side chain with the dodecanoxy side chain without changing the 2-ethylhexyl (2-EH) branched alkyl chains sitting on the pyrrole units of the molecule. However, the final molecule is entirely insoluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, indicating that the replacement of the undecyl side chain with the dodecanoxy side chain dramatically reduces the solubility of the molecule. In order to increase its solubility, longer branched alkyl chains, 2-butyloctyl (2-BO), are used to replace the 2-EH alkyl chains. The structure of the resulting molecule is displayed in Fig. 1a and the new molecule (with R1 being the dodecanoxy group and R2 being the 2-BO alkyl chain) is named Y6-O. The synthesis routes of IDTN-O and Y6-O shown in Schemes S1 and S2† are similar to those of IDTN and Y6.51–53 The corresponding NMR spectra and mass spectra of the intermediate compounds, IDTN-O and Y6-O are displayed in the ESI.† Both IDTN-O and Y6-O can be well dissolved in dichloromethane, chlorobenzene and chloroform.

As displayed in Fig. S1a,† in chloroform solution, IDTN-O and IDTN have almost the same absorption curves from 500 nm to 730 nm. However, Y6-O exhibits intensive absorption from 600 nm to 770 nm, which is ∼50 nm blue-shifted compared to that of Y6 (Table 1). The maximum molar extinction coefficients of IDTN-O and Y6-O are similar (∼2.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at 686 and 702 nm, which are higher than those of IDTN and Y6 (∼1.7 × 105 M−1 cm−1) at 688 and 733 nm, respectively. The thin films of IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6 exhibit an absorption edge at 779, 789, 817 and 902 nm (Fig. 1b), which red-shift by 57, 66, 78 and 119 nm relative to those in chloroform solution, respectively, implying their strong intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state. The optical bandgaps of IDTN-O and IDTN calculated from the absorption edges of films are similar (1.59 eV and 1.57 eV) while the bandgap of Y6-O is 1.52 eV, which is much larger than that of Y6 (1.37 eV). According to the absorption spectra, the alkoxy substitution on IDTN leads to little change in the optical bandgap while that on Y6 enlarges the bandgap and causes the blue-shifted absorption onset.

To further investigate the effect of alkoxy substitution on energy levels, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6 were estimated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods where Fc/Fc+ (−4.80 eV) was taken as an external standard. According to the CV plots in Fig. S2 and S3,† the HOMO/LUMO levels of IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6 are calculated to be −5.77/−3.89 eV, −5.81/−3.97 eV, −5.75/−3.71 eV, and −5.71/−3.89 eV (Table 1 and Fig. 1c), respectively. According to UV-vis spectra and CV results, the methoxy groups in IDTN-O can increase LUMO and HOMO levels simultaneously and thus mostly maintain the absorption onset and optical bandgap while the alkoxy substitution on Y6 can significantly upshift the LUMO level compared to the change of the HOMO level. In comparison with IDTN, the slightly higher LUMO level of IDTN-O is expected to slightly increase Voc in the resulting devices while the similar absorption range can generate similar Jsc. But for Y-series acceptors, alkoxy substitution can result in corresponding OSCs with a much higher Voc but a lower Jsc due to the blue-shifted absorption onset.
To figure out the geometry and energy level changes from IDTN to IDTN-O and from Y6 to Y6-O caused by alkoxy groups, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were used with methyl groups replacing the extended side chains. As the side view shown in Table S1,† compared to the flat backbone of IDTN, the substitution of methoxy groups makes the backbone of IDTN-O slightly curved. As shown in Table S2,† the top view and side view of Y6-O and Y6 are almost the same, implying few changes of the molecular geometry caused by the alkoxy substitution. According to the calculation results in Table S1,† the HOMO/LUMO levels of IDTN-O are −5.55/−3.35 eV, slightly higher than those of IDTN (−5.58/−3.41 eV). As summarized in Table S2,† the LUMO level of Y6-O is 0.14 eV higher than that of Y6 (−3.61 vs. −3.75 eV) while their HOMO level is almost the same (−5.89 vs. −5.90 eV). These two sets of calculation results of energy levels are consistent with the aforementioned CV measurements and UV-vis spectra. Besides, the dipole moments and the electronic potential diagram of these four molecules in their optimized geometry are also calculated and listed in Tables S1 and S2.† After alkoxy substitution, the dipole moment of IDTN-O (0.90 D) is higher than that of IDTN (0.04 D), which can lead to enhanced aggregation properties. Compared to the dipole moment change from IDTN to IDTN-O, that from Y6 (1.04 D) to Y6-O (3.66 D) is more significant, resulting in a much stronger intermolecular interaction, over-aggregation and decreased solubility.54,55 Therefore, longer alkyl chains are needed for Y6-O to maintain relatively good solubility. As seen in the corresponding electronic potential diagram in Tables S1 and S2,† alkoxy substitution pushes the electronic density from the core to the end groups both in IDTN-O and Y6-O, which accounts for the change of dipole moment. In conclusion, in addition to the different effects on the energy levels between IDT-series acceptors and Y-series acceptors, alkoxy substitution also plays different roles in molecular packing and aggregation properties due to the different orientation of these two kinds of molecules.
Molecular conformations especially the end-group conformations are related to intermolecular packing and thus the film morphology and carrier mobility.56–60 First, we calculated the interatomic distance between vinyl-proton and oxygen atoms in the alkoxy groups of IDTN-O and Y6-O, which is 2.31 Å and 2.22 Å, respectively. Considering that the van der Waals radii of hydrogen and oxygen are 1.1 Å and 1.52 Å,61 it is believed that there exists a noncovalent interaction between vinyl-proton and oxygen atoms, which may lock molecular conformation. To further investigate the intramolecular conformational locking effects of alkoxy groups, relaxed potential energy scan (PES) was carried out.30,62 To simplify the calculations, for IDTN-O and IDTN, we chose two simplified units named T-O-NC and T-NC shown in Fig. 2a, where possible intramolecular conformational locking may exist. We set the optimized structures of T-O-NC and T-NC as the starting points and calculated the energy curves versus the torsion angle, in which the torsion axis is the single bond between the thiophene unit and the double bond (Fig. 2a). According to the PES results shown in Fig. 2b, T-NC shows two optimized conformations with a very small energy difference of 7.4 kJ mol−1 between 0° and 180°, thus tending to have two conformations together. In comparison, T-O-NC shows three optimized conformations with a more considerable energy difference of ∼29.4 kJ mol−1 between 0° and 150°/210°, which implies that T-O-NC prefers the 0° conformation with the lowest energy. Similarly, for Y6-O and Y6, we conducted the PES calculations of two simplified units named T-O-IC and T-C-IC in Fig. 2c. As shown in Fig. 2d, since the torsion barrier is enhanced from T-C-IC to T-O-IC, the 0° conformation is more preferred in T-O-IC than in T-C-IC. Overall, in IDTN-O, methoxy groups can introduce intramolecular conformational locking effects to enhance the intermolecular stacking of the resulting molecules, which can increase the crystallinity of the molecule and thus change other related properties, as will be discussed below. Although the alkyl chains of Y6 can also provide intramolecular conformational locking effects, the alkoxy chains of Y6-O have a stronger one, which should increase the stacking of the molecule.

Two different kinds of medium-bandgap polymers named J71 and PM6 (chemical structure shown in Fig. S4†) were selected as the donors because of their suitable absorption ranges (Fig. 1b) and matched energy levels with IDTN-O/IDTN and Y6-O/Y6, respectively. To test the photovoltaic performances of these combinations, OSC devices were made with the conventional configuration shown in Fig. 3a. For IDTN-O and IDTN, the device structure is ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate))/J71:acceptor/ZrAcAc (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al while for Y6-O and Y6 the device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:NFA/PDINO/Al according to the literature.52,63 Detailed device processing methods are summarized in the ESI† and the optimized device results are summarized in Table 2 with the corresponding J–V curves in Fig. 3b. Compared to the IDTN-based devices, the IDTN-O-based ones can achieve a 0.03 V higher Voc, which agrees well with the change in the energy levels from IDTN to IDTN-O. Besides, OSCs based on J71:IDTN-O can achieve a higher Jsc of 17.2 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.0%. Therefore, better PCEs of 12.1% are achieved by the J71:IDTN-O-based devices compared to the J71:IDTN-based ones (10.9%). Differently, compared to the photovoltaic parameters of the Y6-based devices, the Y6-O-based ones can achieve a significant enhancement in Voc of 0.95 V and also a high FF of 78.0% despite a lower Jsc of 22.4 mA cm−2. As a result, a higher PCE of 16.6% can be achieved by the Y6-O-based devices. To test the reproducibility of these OSCs, 20 devices of each blend were made to calculate the mean values and standard deviations of the photovoltaic parameters. The results summarized in Table S3† prove great reproducibility of these four acceptors. According to these device results, the alkoxy substitution at the β-position of the outer thiophene unit in IDT-series acceptors can not only help improve Voc by slightly upshifting the LUMO level but can also slightly increase Jsc and FF to achieve better performances. Although the alkoxy substitution at the same position in Y-series acceptors reduces Jsc mainly due to the larger optical bandgap of the corresponding acceptor, it can help improve Voc significantly because of the upshifted LUMO level while achieving a high FF.

External Quantum Efficiencies (EQE) were measured to figure out the reason for the different Jsc values of OSCs based on these two different series of acceptors. The integrated Jsc values of the OSCs based on IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6, calculated from the corresponding EQE spectra (Fig. 3c), are in good agreement with the measured Jsc (Table 2). Despite the EQE spectra showing similar ranges, the J71:IDTN-O-based devices have slightly higher EQE from 600 nm to 800 nm than the J71:IDTN-based ones, which explains the slightly improved Jsc. For PM6:Y6-O-based devices, the EQE with over 70% ranges from 480 to 790 nm, while from 490 to 850 nm for PM6:Y6 ones, which are consistent with their blend film absorption (Fig. S1b†). The EQE results reveal that the decrease of Jsc from Y6 to Y6-O is not caused by the lower EQE but by the blue-shifted absorption onset. In contrast, Y6-O-based devices can even achieve higher EQE values from 700 to 800 nm.

The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6-based films was measured to understand the differences in their EQE spectra. Because of the different absorption ranges for these two kinds of acceptors, the corresponding PL spectra of the IDTN-O and IDTN-based films excited at 600 nm are shown in Fig. 3d while those of the Y6-O and Y6-based films excited at 785 nm are shown in Fig. 3e. The IDTN-O and Y6-O-based blends have higher PL quenching efficiency (74.5% and 97.5%) than the IDTN and Y6-based blends (67.1% and 95.2%), which indicates that more efficient hole transfer occurs in the IDTN-O and Y6-O-based devices and thus explains the EQE differences of the corresponding devices.64
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was utilized to probe the surface morphology of films based on IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6. Fig. S5 and S6† provide the corresponding AFM height sensor images and phase images. All the J71:IDTN-O, J71:IDTN, PM6:Y6-O and PM6:Y6-based films show small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (2.79, 2.72, 2.10 and 2.22 nm, respectively), indicating their uniform and smooth surfaces. Therefore, the effect of alkoxy side chains on the morphology cannot be fully elucidated solely by AFM. Furthermore, 2D-grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns are captured to better understand the effects of alkoxy substitution on the blend film morphology.65,66 The 2D-GIWAXS patterns and cut–line profiles of four blend films are shown in Fig. 4 with the corresponding key parameters summarized in Table 3. Compared to the 2D-GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding parameters of pure J71 (Fig. S7a and Table S4†), J71:IDTN-O and J71:IDTN blend films show (010) diffraction peaks both in the plane and out of plane coming from IDTN-O and IDTN respectively. Moreover, the IDTN-O-based blend film has a larger coherent length of 27.6 Å of the (010) peak in the out of plane direction while the IDTN-based blend film shows a smaller coherent length of 26.6 Å. As for Y-series acceptors; the 2D-GIWAXS patterns of both the blends show a predominant (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction coming from Y6-O and Y6 compared to the patterns of pure PM6 (Fig. S7b†), which indicates that both the blend films form face-on orientation and thus is beneficial for charge transport.67 Besides, the coherence length of the (010) peak of the PM6:Y6-O blend (21.8 Å) is similar to that of the PM6:Y6 one (22.1 Å) despite the longer alkyl chains of Y6-O. The PM6:Y6-O blend film shows a smaller d-spacing (3.54 Å) in comparison with PM6:Y6 (3.57 Å), which is caused by the stronger π–π intermolecular interactions, leading to efficient electron transport and thus an impressive FF of 78.0%.

By the space-charge-limited current (SCLC, Fig. S8†) method, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6 blend films were measured to study the effect of the alkoxy substitution on charge mobility. As listed in Table 2, after blending with J71, the IDTN-O-based films show a μh of 7.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 5.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the IDTN-based films show a μh of 6.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 4.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The substitution of methoxy groups can bring intramolecular conformational locking effects to enhance the stacking of IDTN-O, which helps slightly increase the hole and electron mobility of the corresponding devices. As a result, the slightly higher charge mobility of the IDTN-O-based blends contributes to a slightly better FF of the corresponding devices. Despite the similar μh of ∼7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, the blend films of PM6:Y6-O show a higher μe of 8.24 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than PM6:Y6 (5.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the closer π–π stacking distance. Besides, the μh/μe ratios of the PM6:Y6-O and PM6:Y6 blend films are calculated to be 0.96 and 1.35, respectively. The higher electron mobility and more balanced charge transport contribute to the higher FF of PM6:Y6-O-based OSCs.68,69
To study the alkoxy substitution effect on charge generation and collection efficiency, the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was measured, in which Jph = JL − JD and Veff = V0 − Vbias. Here, JL and JD are photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively while V0 and Vbias are the voltage when Jph is zero and the external voltage bias.70 The charge generation and collection process can be affected by the value of Veff. According to Fig. 5a, despite the positive correlation between Jph and Veff in a low Veff range, as Veff increases, Jph becomes saturated since all excitons are dissociated to free charges that are collected by corresponding electrodes. Here we chose the Jph value when Veff = 3.0 V as the saturated current density (Jsat), which stands for the maximum of free charges that can be collected. Therefore, the exciton dissociation degrees (ηdis) and charge collection degrees (ηcol) of the devices can be characterized by the ratio of Jph and Jsat under maximum power output and short-circuit conditions, respectively.71 The values of ηdis and ηcol for the IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6-based devices were obtained and calculated as listed in Table S5.† It is very clear that both the IDTN-O and Y6-O-based devices have higher ηdis and ηcol values (93.9% and 85.2%, 94.9% and 86.4%) than the IDTN and Y6-based devices (91.7% and 81.8%, 93.0% and 83.8%), which indicates that more free charges can be generated and collected in the former devices. Alkoxy substitution can help increase the charge generation and collection efficiency for high Jsc and FFs.

We further investigated the degree of charge recombination of OSCs based on IDTN-O, IDTN, Y6-O and Y6 by figuring out the dependence of Voc and Jsc on different light intensities (Plight). In principle, under short-circuit conditions, Jsc should be proportional to PlightS, where S stands for the degrees of bimolecular recombination.72 The ideal S value should be 1 while the experimental S value is always below 1 due to some extent of bimolecular recombination.73 According to Fig. 5b, the S values of the IDTN-O and Y6-OY6-O-based devices are 0.972 and 0.985, higher than those of the IDTN and Y6-based devices (0.953 and 0.971), indicating the existence of less bimolecular recombination in the IDTN-O and Y6-O-based devices. In addition, under open-circuit conditions, Voc and Plight should follow Voc ∝ (nKT/q)ln(P), where n, q, T, and K are the ideality factor, the elementary charge, temperature (K) and Boltzmann constant, respectively.74 Here n stands for the degrees of trap-assisted recombination and its value should be between 1 and 2. The higher n indicates more severe trap-assisted recombination.75 As shown in Fig. 5c, the n values of the IDTN and Y6-based devices (1.29 and 1.19) are slightly higher than those of the IDTN-O and Y6-O-based devices (1.26 and 1.16), implying the slightly higher degrees of trap-assisted recombination of the IDTN and Y6-based devices. Based on these two measurements, it can be concluded that the alkoxy substitution in IDT-series acceptors and Y-series acceptors can help decrease the charge recombination degrees of the corresponding devices for excellent performance.
Conclusions
In summary, two new NFAs named IDTN-O and Y6-O were synthesized by adopting alkoxy substitution at the β-position of the outer thiophene unit in the reported IDT-series and Y-series NFAs named IDTN and Y6. In the case of IDT-series acceptors, the substitution of methoxy groups can slightly upshift the HOMO and LUMO levels, which helps OSCs based on J71:IDTN-O obtain a slightly higher Voc of 0.91 V. Meanwhile, because of the intramolecular conformational locking effects and higher dipole moment caused by methoxy groups, higher mobility and suppressed charge recombination can be achieved in IDTN-O to achieve an enhancement of Jsc and the FF. All these enhancements caused by the substitution of methoxy groups lead to a better PCEs of 12.1% in OSCs based on J71:IDTN-O. But for Y-series acceptors, it is found that alkoxy substitution significantly upshifts the LUMO level which leads to a higher Voc of 0.95 V in OSCs based on PM6:Y6-O but keeps the HOMO level similar which decreases the Jsc of the corresponding devices. Also alkoxy substitution has a stronger intramolecular conformational locking effect than alkyl substitution and enhances the dipole moment of the molecules for much stronger intermolecular interactions so that longer alkyl chains are needed to obtain good solubility and an optimized morphology, which leads to relatively high and balanced charge mobilities in the Y6-O-based devices and a higher FF of 78.0%. Therefore, OSCs based on PM6:Y6-O can achieve a higher PCE of 16.6% than OSCs based on PM6:Y6 (15.7%). According to our research results, we believe that it is important and promising to modify the β-position of the outer thiophene unit both in IDT-series and Y-series acceptors based on their different chemical properties for highly efficient organic solar cells.
