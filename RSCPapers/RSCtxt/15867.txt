1. Introduction
The past six years have witnessed the rapid development of all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) including three-dimensional (3-D) CsPbX3,1–15 two-dimensional (2-D) CsPb2X5,16,17 and zero-dimensional (0-D) Cs4PbX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) polymorphs.18–20 Their exceptional properties, namely tunable emissions over the entire visible spectral region, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) close to unity and narrow emission line widths down to 10–20 nm, have led to a broad range of applications spanning from solar cells, lasing, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to scintillators.21–34 Despite these considerable advances made in cesium lead halide PeNCs especially for the category of 3-D CsPbX3, their practical applications and commercial translations are still restricted by their labile perovskite lattices and downgraded excitonic luminescence under harsh conditions such as high temperature and humidity. As a typical example, cesium lead iodide perovskite (CsPbI3) has an ideal bandgap energy of 1.72 eV for use in perovskite-based solar cells,21,35 however, it shows a rapid phase transition from highly luminescent cubic (α-) phase to non-photoactive orthorhombic (δ-) phase even under ambient air conditions, making their real-world applications and then commercial translations nearly impossible.21 These practical challenges facing cesium lead halide PeNCs are primarily associated with their soft ionic crystal lattices induced by their low charges of the constituent ions (half of those in traditional meta-chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS, ZnSe).14,15 As such, the crystal lattice energies for these cesium lead halide perovskites are determined to be much lower than those of perovskite oxides (e.g., CaTiO3) or conventional QDs with rigid and highly covalent crystal lattices. Although this feature makes the controlled synthesis of cesium lead halide PeNCs much easier than the conventional meta-chalcogenide QDs typically prepared at elevated temperatures of 100–350 °C, it indeed leads to the notorious instability of cesium lead halide PeNCs when exposed to heat, air, moisture as well as light irradiation. Attempts to overcome these problems include full encapsulation of individual PeNCs in an inert shell (for instance, within silica),33,36 alloying with Br− and Cl−,37 use of heterojunction structures38–40 and low flux X-ray irradiation.41 However, these surface-modified approaches did not address the intrinsic limitations of soft ionic crystal lattices of cesium lead halide PeNCs.
Beyond these surface-modified approaches, cation doping approach holds great promise in getting to the root of the disadvantages of cesium lead halide PeNCs. As well-established in traditional QDs,14,15 cation doping is a means of controlled incorporation of some desired impurity cations into the lattice of cesium lead halide PeNCs so as to modulate their physicochemical properties. For instance, theoretically, 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs with an insulating bandgap of ∼3.96 eV (∼313 nm) were non-luminescent in the visible spectra region but, after replacing a small quantity of Pb2+ with Sn cation, they became blue-emissive with an ultranarrow blue emission output centered at ∼437 nm (full width at half maximum, ∼12 nm).42 Inspired by those remarkable examples previously reported,42–47 diverse cations like alkali metal,43–47 alkaline-earth metal,48–51 transition metal52–110 and lanthanide ions111–123 have been introduced into the lattices of cesium lead halide PeNCs by using different synthetic methods, in order to achieve the successful A-site (Cs+) or B-site (Pb2+) doping and then slightly change the local coordination environment of [PbX6]4− clusters responsible for their physicochemical performances.
Conventional wisdom, impurity doping would inevitably result in the formation of numerous crystalline defects in the host matrix under study, which are highly detrimental as electronic traps even in low concentration in traditional semiconductors such as Si, CdTe and GaAs.14,15 Fortunately, cesium lead halide PeNCs are quite different, and they have proven to be highly tolerant to a large variety of conceivable point defects such as A-site, B-site and X-site vacancies, grain boundaries of various crystallographic orientation and surface quenching sites induced by impurity doping.14,15 Benefiting from this fortunate coincidence, bright blue-emissive cesium lead halide PeNCs with an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) close to unity, that has proven to be the most challenging to obtain in pure cesium lead halide PeNCs, were easily obtained without additional surface passivation, simply through a cation doping strategy.99 Particularly, within the past several years, many other significant advances have been accomplished in cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs, in terms of the much improved excitonic luminescence efficiency, greatly stabilized crystal phase of perovskites and emerged optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, as have been well summarized in some recent critical and tutorial reviews regarding the effects of impurity doping on photoelectric properties of perovskites.124–126 However, we note that a comprehensive review focusing on the controlled synthesis for cation-doping as well as the novel physicochemical properties from cation-doped all-inorganic caesium lead halide PeNCs is still lacking so far. Rather than being exhaustive, in this review article, we aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the latest advances towards the development of cation-doped all-inorganic cesium lead halide PeNCs for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, which covers areas from their fundamental considerations of cation doping, controlled synthesis methodology and novel physicochemical properties induced by cation doping to the optoelectronic applications. We start with a brief overview on the fundamental aspects of all-inorganic cesium lead halide PeNCs for cation doping in the introduction section, followed by a focus on the most representative synthetic approaches to achieve the successful cation doping in perovskite lattices of cesium lead halide PeNCs. Next, we highlight the novel physicochemical properties of diverse cesium lead halide PeNCs induced by cation doping. In section 4, we give a brief description of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices based on cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs. And finally, some future prospects and challenges in this rapidly growing field are also proposed.
2. Cation-doping strategies
The development of facile synthesis strategies for doping various cations into the lattices of different cesium lead halide PeNCs with desirable crystalline phases, shapes and sizes is crucial to tuning their physicochemical properties and exploring their potential optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Up to now, a large variety of chemical synthetic approaches have been proposed to achieve the successful cation A-site (Cs+) or B-site (Pb2+) doping in cesium lead halide PeNCs with different compositions and dimensionalities by using some other cations, which include the one-pot hot-injection procedure, post-synthetic cation exchange,105 supersaturated solution recrystallization process,43 one-step dual ion exchange reaction,72 one-pot ultrasonication116 as well as highly Pb2+-poor and halide-rich reaction environment synthesis we developed.42 As summarized in Table 1, the one-pot hot-injection procedure and post-synthetic cation exchange synthesis are nowadays the two most commonly used routes to the synthesis of high-quality cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs amongst those methods previously reported.

2.1. Hot injection strategy
In fact, the hot injection method was first adopted by Kovalenko et al. in 2015 to prepare pure CsPbX3-type (X = Cl, Br and I) PeNCs with bright emissions spanning the entire visible spectral region,8 where the PbX2 and Cs–oleate compounds were used as precursors and decomposed at an elevated temperature (120–200 °C) in a high boiling point organic solvent such as oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OAm) and 1-octadecene (ODE) to yield the monodispersed colloidal CsPbX3 PeNCs (Fig. 1a). Particularly, as compared to the other synthesis methods, the hot injection strategy can deliver a high-temperature and inert reaction environment that is favourable to achieving the successful lattice doping. Subsequently, this method was refined and extended as the most commonly used route for the preparation of diverse cation-doped CsPbX3 PeNCs, through additionally supplying the precursor of halide or acetate of a given cation in the synthesis procedure. In this way, a great number of cations such as alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal, transition metal and lanthanide ions were introduced into the host lattices of CsPbX3 after partially substituting A-site Cs+ or B-site Pb2+ ions, as exemplified by divalent manganese (Mn2+),52,53,55 nickel (Ni2+),99 and trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+)112 ions. For instance, Son and co-workers reported the synthesis of monodisperse Mn-doped 3-D CsPbCl3 and CsPb(Cl/Br)3 PeNCs by using this one-pot hot injection method (Fig. 1b),52 where their lattice structures as well as crystallinity was found nearly identical to their pure counterparts without Mn2+-doping. This result was further confirmed by our experimental observations showing that the crystallinity for the resulting Mn-doped CsPbX3 PeNCs was comparable to their pure counterparts, regardless of the distinct lattice contractions induced by the fractional substitution of Pb2+ with smaller Mn2+ in perovskite host lattices.

Apart from those isovalent cations, the one-pot hot injection method was also applicable to the doping of monovalent110 and trivalent111–115,117,121,127 cations in different PeNCs. Taking trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+) ions for example, Song and colleagues112 have recently reported the successful doping of various Ln3+ ions (e.g., Ce3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Er3+ and Yb3+) into the lattices of CsPbCl3 PeNCs by using the modified hot-injection procedure (Fig. 1c and d). To determine the actual doping location of Ln3+ in CsPbCl3 PeNCs, they have also performed the first-principle defect calculations by using the plane-wave pseudopotential methods within density functional theory (DFT), where they addressed that all the Ln3+ ions were prone to occupy a substituted B-site of Pb2+, namely, substitutional LnPb. However, because of the large mismatch in ionic radius and charge between Ln3+ and Pb2+ ions, it is still debatable whether Ln3+ ions in these PeNCs are mainly located at the nanocrystal surfaces or incorporated homogeneously in the host lattice, which absolutely deserves an in-depth study by utilizing some other convincing techniques such as extended X-ray-absorption fine structure (EXAFS).
2.2. Post-synthetic cation exchange method
Post-synthetic cation exchange is another well-developed synthesis strategy to achieve the successful cation A-site or B-site doping in the lattices of cesium lead halide PeNCs with preserved shape and crystal structure as that of the initial NCs. In a typical synthetic procedure, pure cesium lead halide PeNCs without cation doping was first fabricated and then used as seeds for the succeeded cation exchange with different compounds capable of delivering the designated cations (Fig. 2a), thereby enabling the preparation of a variety of cation-doped PeNCs with unique optical properties that are not attainable in their pure counterparts. In principle, both the A-site and B-site cations in cesium lead halide PeNCs can be partially or totally replaced via such a cation exchange method. However, it should be noted that such a post-synthetic cation exchange reaction is more time-consuming relative to the other one-step synthesis methods being completed within several seconds (<10 s).
 Fig. 2  (a) Schematic illustration of partial cation exchange of host Pb2+ with M2+ ions (M = Sn, Zn and Cd) in the pure CsPbBr3 PeNCs. Quantitative high-angle annular dark-field STEM measurements reveal a lattice contraction of (b) parent CsPbBr3 NCs (|a| = 5.849 ± 0.003 Å) upon reaction with (c) 0.5 mM SnBr2 (|a| = 5.839 ± 0.005 Å), (d) 0.5 mM CdBr2 (|a| = 5.819 ± 0.008 Å), and (e) 1.0 mM ZnBr2 (|a| = 5.808 ± 0.014 Å) (reaction time: 16 h). Reproduced with permission.105 Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. 
As one of the most representative examples of cation exchange method, in 2017, Donega and colleagues105 reported that the host Pb2+ located at the [PbBr6]4− octahedra coordination environment of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs could be partially replaced with several isovalent M2+ (M = Sn2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+) cations, resulting in a series of monodisperse CsPb1−xMxBr3 PeNCs (0 < x ≤ 0.1), with preservation of the original nanocrystal shape and size, as clearly indicated by their corresponding TEM images before and after cation exchange (Fig. 2b–e). In spite of this, apparent lattice contraction induced by the substitution of Pb2+ with smaller Sn2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions were detected in these TEM images of CsPb1−xMxBr3 PeNCs (Fig. 2b–e), which thereby provided solid evidence of the successful doping of M2+ ions in the lattices of CsPbX3 PeNCs via this cation exchange strategy. Besides, such cation exchange can also occur even at room-temperature under ambient air conditions, as well established by the recent reports showing that the room-temperature post-synthetic treatment of pure CsPbX3 (X = Cl and Br) PeNCs with MgX2 led to the incorporation of a significant quantity of Mg2+ into the NCs with highly improved luminescence efficiency relative to the initial ones.48
2.3. Other cation-doping approaches
While the one-pot hot-injection and post-synthetic cation exchange methodologies have been well established for the fabrication of metal cation-doped PeNCs as discussed aforementioned, quite a few groups have also attempted to develop other synthetic methods like supersaturated solution recrystallization process,43 one-step dual ion exchange reaction,72 one-pot ultrasonication116 and Pb2+-poor and halide-rich reaction environment synthesis42 to yield cation A-site or B-site doped PeNCs with different compositions, dimensionalities, shapes and sizes. For instance, we have recently developed a highly Pb2+-poor and Br−-rich reaction environment to prepare blue emitting Sn-doped 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs, which was achieved by replacing the vast majority of the PbBr2 precursor with SnBr2 (SnBr2/(SnBr2 + PbBr2) = 80 mol%) in a modified hot-injection approach that was previously reported for the synthesis of green-emitting cubic CsPbBr3 PeNCs (Fig. 3).42 Taking advantage of the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) as well as two-dimensional EDS elemental mapping, the successful doping of Sn2+ into the 0-D Cs4PbBr6:Sn perovskite NCs was validated, where Sn2+ ions were found to occupy a substituted site of SnPb in the lattice of 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs.

Note that the unique Pb2+-poor and Br−-rich reaction environment for the synthesis of the blue-emitting 0-D Cs4PbBr6:Sn PeNCs was achieved by replacing the vast majority of the PbBr2 precursor with SnBr2 (SnBr2/(SnBr2 + PbBr2) = 80 mol%) in a conventional hot-injection reaction medium used to synthesize green-emitting 3-D CsPbBr3 PeNCs, and the Pb2+-poor reaction medium for the synthesis of pure 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs was achieved by partially adding the PbBr2 precursor (20% of that for the green-emitting CsPbBr3 PeNCs) into the reaction environment.

3. Novel physicochemical properties from cation-doping
3.1. Stabilized perovskite crystal phase
All inorganic cesium lead halide PeNCs particularly for 3-D CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) are considered to be the most promising candidates for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties such as component-dependent PL emission outputs over the entire visible spectra region and high PLQYs near 100%. However, the practical applications of these PeNCs are still limited by their intrinsic chemical and thermal instabilities, which, in part, are associated with their low formation energies of perovskite lattices. To resolve these concerns, considerable efforts have been done to stabilize the crystal lattices of CsPbX3 PeNCs that suffer from poor thermal and chemical stability under ambient air conditions through cation-doping strategy.
One of the earliest examples of stabilizing the crystal phase of PeNCs through impurity doping was demonstrated by Fafarman and co-workers,37 where the rapid phase transition from the cubic phase to the yellow phase when exposed to a humid atmosphere were greatly inhibited after highly doping chloride anion into the perovskite lattice of CsPbI3 NCs, that is, via an anion X-site doping strategy. Subsequently, this anion doping approach was expanded extensively to cation A-site or B-site doping by partially replacing the host Pb2+ or Cs+ with some other cations of identical or different valence states such as monovalent Ag+, divalent Mn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Sr2+, Sn2+ (ref. 128–130) and trivalent Ce3+,113 Sb3+,131,132 and Bi3+.133–135 For example, Yao and co-workers have recently reported a divalent strontium (Sr2+)-substitution along with iodide passivation strategy to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3 (Fig. 4a and b).50 Similar to other cation B-site doping scenarios, the introduction of strontium ion into the host lattice would significantly increase the formation energies of α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs and somewhat reduce the structural distortions, thereby forming highly stable CsPbI3 PeNCs with tunable sizes from 4.7 to 14 nm. As a result, the red-brightness for these Sr2+-doped α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs upon 365 nm UV excitation exhibited indiscernible decrease even after two-month storage, much better than their pure counterparts showing complete degradation under otherwise identical ambient conditions (Fig. 4c). This complete degradation of red brightness for pure α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs without Sr2+-doping was originated from the transformation from cubic α-phase to orthorhombic δ-phase at room temperature, as evidenced by their corresponding evolution of XRD patterns over time (Fig. 4d).

The versatility of the simultaneous Sr2+ doping and halogen surface passivation strategy for stabilizing the perovskite lattices of CsPbX3 PeNCs was later validated by Zhang and co-workers,51 who also found that the simultaneous Sr2+ lattice doping and halogen (Cl−) surface passivation could not only enhance the luminescence efficiency of α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs, but also improve their phase stability. As such, the pure CsPbI3 PeNCs experienced a rapid phase transition from cubic α-phase to yellow δ-phase within 3 d, while the CsPbI3 with Sr2+ doping and Cl− passivation experienced nearly no degradation for more than 2 months under ambient air conditions.51 More recently, they have also changed the divalent dopant from Sr2+ to Zn2+ in order to make the red-emitting α-CsPbI3 PeNCs stable at room temperature. Likewise, the resulting Zn-doped CsPbI3 PeNCs were found to maintain their cubic α-phase for 70 days under ambient air conditions, concomitant with a high PLQY approaching unity (∼98.5%) due to the increased radiative decay rate underlying the partial substitution of Pb2+ with Zn2+.106
In addition to the well-established isovalent B-site doping, hetero-valence cations were also employed as effective dopants to stabilize the host lattices of CsPbX3 PeNCs. For instance, Pradhan et al.132 have recently introduced Sb3+ ion into the host lattice of α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs by using a modified hot injection method for pure CsPbX3 synthesis. Although only a limited amount of Sb3+ could replace Pb2+ ion in the host lattice due to the charge difference, those Sb3+-doped CsPbI3 PeNCs indeed kept almost unchanged for more than 30 days in air at room temperature. By contrast, the pure α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs were found to become non-luminescent δ-phase only within 1 day under otherwise identical conditions. Likewise, such a hetero-valence Sb3+-doping method was also adopted by Zhang and co-workers to improve the crystal stability of CsPbBr3 PeNCs.131 Notably, this hetero-valence Sb3+-doping method allowed for the preparation of the first family of blue-emitting CsPbBr3 PeNCs with ultrasmall nanocrystal size less than 3 nm, which is considered to be the most challenging to obtain among the vast majority of luminescent nanophosphors.
3.2. Enhanced thermal and air stabilities
In addition to the phase stability, cation A-site or B-site doping can also enhance the thermal and air stability of resulting PeNCs with different compositions. For example, we have recently proposed a simple but valid Mn2+-substitution strategy to fundamentally stabilize the perovskite lattices of CsPbX3 NCs that suffer from poor thermal under ambient air conditions (Fig. 5a).55 Divalent Mn2+ (∼0.97 Å) ion with an ionic radius smaller than that of Pb2+ (∼1.19 Å) was chosen as the cation dopant because both of them have identical octahedral coordination environment in their respective CsPbX3 and CsMnX3 crystals, which makes the B-site substitution of host Pb2+ with Mn2+ easier than other cations without ABX3-type crystal lattice. Benefitting from this Mn2+-substitution strategy, both the thermal stability and optical performance including excitonic luminescence for these CsPbX3:Mn2+ PeNCs were found to be greatly improved with respect to their pure counterparts (Fig. 5b). In particular, the room temperature integrated PL intensity for excitonic luminescence of CsPbCl3:Mn PeNCs was markedly enhanced by a factor of ∼3.4 relative to their initial PL intensity after being heated up to 200 °C and then cooled down to room temperature, which was totally different from the case of pure CsPbCl3 PeNCs whose PL emission was barely detectable after undergoing the same heating and cooling cycles (Fig. 5c), thereby demonstrating the critical role of Mn2+ doping in improving the thermal stability of CsPbX3 family.

(b) Temperature-dependent PL intensities for excitonic luminescence of CsPbCl3:Mn (5.8 mol%) and pure CsPbCl3 PeNCs via three heating/cooling cycles at 100, 150, and 200 °C, respectively, and (c) the room-temperature integrated PL intensities of CsPbCl3:Mn and pure CsPbCl3 PeNCs after the above three heating/cooling cycles.

Similarly, the air stability for these Mn2+-doped CsPbX3 PeNCs was also greatly improved when compared to their pure counterparts. Under ambient air conditions, the green PL brightness for pure CsPbBr3 PeNCs without Mn-doping underwent a striking degradation to be nonluminous within 30 days (Fig. 5d). By contrast, much slower degradation rate was observed for all the CsPbBr3:Mn PeNCs, which could maintain their original PL brightness of ∼60% within 120 days and then kept essentially unchanged with further increase in the exposure time. Specifically, the green PL brightness for CsPbBr3:Mn2+ PeNCs with Mn2+ doping concentration higher than 5.6 mol% was instead observed to gradually increase with the longer exposure time. Even for the most unstable CsPbI3 PeNCs in air, their red PL brightness was detectable within 4–5 days, standing in stark contrast to the complete degradation of pure CsPbI3 PeNCs within 2 days. These results thereby provided unequivocal evidence to prove that such a Mn2+ B-site doping played a key role in enhancing the air stability of CsPbX3 PeNCs. In combination experimental methods with the first-principle calculations, we confirmed that the significantly improved thermal and air stabilities of CsPbX3:Mn2+ PeNCs was primarily associated with their enhanced formation energies after partial Mn2+-substitution with a theoretically optimal doping content about 2.08 mol%. Noted that similar observations were also observed by other groups in CsPbX3:Mn2+ PeNCs,61,62 we believe that the improved physicochemical stability of CsPbX3 was of great significance for fabricating diverse optoelectronic devices with excellent long-term operational stability in air. Besides, we would like to empathize that such a Mn2+ B-site doping strategy was used to stabilize the CsPbX3 PeNCs themselves instead of the devices.
Another interesting example regarding the enhanced stability of PeNCs was reported by Shen and co-workers,129 who found the alloyed Sn/Pb PeNCs, namely, CsSn1−xPbxI3, were not only phase stable for months in purified colloidal solution but also remained intact even directly exposed to ambient air, far superior to both of their pure CsSnI3 and CsPbI3 counterparts. As clearly demonstrated by the photographs of solutions of pure CsSnI3 and alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 (x = 0.4) PeNCs taken at different periods of time in Fig. 6a and b, the pure CsSnI3 nanocrystal solution was observed to rapidly change from black to yellow in terms of colour, whether exposed to ambient air or stored under nitrogen atmosphere. This observation stood in stark contrast to the alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 PeNCs who did not show any apparent change in color over a period of time of 5 months, suggesting the much superior air stability to that of their pure CsSnI3 counterparts. Besides, the alloyed CsSn1−xPbxI3 PeNCs also outperformed their pure counterparts in terms of thermal stability, as well confirmed by their corresponding temperature-dependent thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and XRD patterns showing that the alloyed PeNCs were thermally stable up to 320 °C, far higher than that of 213 °C for pure CsPbI3 PeNCs.

Apart from Mn2+ and Sn2+ cations, another kind of divalent cation capable of simultaneously improving the thermal and air stabilities of CsPbX3 PeNCs was copper (Cu2+) ion. After doping divalent Cu2+ ion into the perovskite lattice, enhanced thermal and air stability of PeNCs coupled with strong blue emission (PLQY, ∼80%) were achieved a in CsPb1−xCux(Br/Cl)3 PeNCs in an ambient atmosphere.103 By utilizing the EXAFS measurements, Rogach and co-workers revealed that the doping of Cu2+ ion into the lattices of CsPb1−xCux(Br/Cl)3 PeNCs would induce a lattice contraction and the eliminated halide vacancies (Fig. 7a and b), as observed in Mn2+-doped CsPbX3 PeNCs we reported.55 Such a lattice contraction led to an increased lattice formation energy and improved short-range order of the doped PeNCs, thereby resulting in the improvement of the thermal stability, air stability and optical performance. As such, the blue-emitting CsPb1−xCux(Br/Cl)3 films were found to maintain stable luminescence performance when annealed at temperatures over 250 °C, totally different from their pure counterparts holding much lower degradation temperature of ∼150 °C. Alternatively, the CsPbX3 PeNCs doped with trivalent lanthanide ions were also found to outperform their pure counterparts in terms of thermal stability. Utilizing an in situ doping strategy, trivalent ytterbium (Yb3+, 0.88 Å) ion with different valence state and ionic radius as that of Pb2+ (1.19 Å) was introduced into the lattice of α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs by Ma and colleagues.122 Compared to the pure samples, the tolerance factor for Yb-doped α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs was calculated to be increased after Yb-doping, thereby significantly retarding the downtrend of excitonic luminescence with the increased experimental temperature from 20 to 100 °C. This enhancement in the thermal stability of Yb-doped α-phase CsPbI3 relative to the pure ones was attributed to the reduced number of vacancy defects and thus strengthened lattice stability against temperature.

3.3. Enhanced luminescence efficiency
Development of highly luminescent caesium lead halide PeNCs with desired crystal phase, shapes and sizes is considered to be a significant prerequisite for fabricating high-performance optoelectronic or photovoltaic devices. Although high PLQYs up to ∼90% could be achieved in those pure caesium lead halide PeNCs previously reported, as exemplified by the red-emitting α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs,14,15 the synthetic approaches usually required stringent control over a set of experimental variables, such as the category of solvent, reaction temperature and time, concentration of halide and metal precursors, and carefully treated purification procedure. Alternatively, cation A-site or B-site doping strategy provided another convenient solution to prepare high-quality perovskite NCs with extremely high luminescence efficiency approaching unity regardless of the categories of PeNCs. The versatility of such a cation doping strategy for enhanced excitonic luminescence of PeNCs has recently been well-validated by a number of research groups in a series of cation-doped caesium lead halide PeNCs, as summarized in Table 2.

One of the most representative examples was reported by Yu and co-workers in 2018,113 they adopted a modified hot-injection method to introduce the hetero-valent Ce3+ ion into the host lattice of green-emitting α-phase CsPbBr3 PeNCs, with an attempt to greatly enhance their photo/electroluminescence efficiency through cation B-site doping (Fig. 8a and b). Trivalent Ce3+ cation possessing a slightly smaller ion radius (1.03 Å) than that of Pb2+ (1.19 Å) was chosen as the dopant, because it did not induce additional luminescence trap states in the conduction band of pure CsPbBr3 PeNCs after doping while maintaining their integrity of perovskite structure, as well elucidated by means of ultrafast transient absorption (TA) and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. Benefiting from this successful Ce3+ B-site doping, the PLQY for Ce-doped CsPbBr3 PeNCs with an optimal doping content of 2.88 mol% was determined to be 89%, enhanced by a factor of ∼2.2 in comparison with the pure ones (∼41%) synthesized at otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 8c). Similarly, such a hetero-valence B-site doping was also employed by Liu et al.128 to improve the excitonic luminescence of green-emitting CsPbBr3 PeNCs after partially replacing the host B-cation of Pb2+ with tetravalent Sn4+ ion, where the absolute PLQY of green excitonic luminescence was observed to remarkably increase from 45% to 83% upon doping of CsPbBr3 with 33% Sn4+. This enhancement was attributed to the increased radiative recombination of single excitons in the crystal lattice of Sn4+-doped CsPbBr3 PeNCs, as validated by their comprehensive spectroscopy studies by means of femtosecond transient absorption (TA), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), and single-dot PL spectroscopy. For better understanding of the mechanism underlying the enhanced excitonic luminescence, a major issue that needs to be addressed is the statistical distribution of dopant ion within an individual nanocrystal, in view of their different valence state for Ce3+, Sn4+ and Pb2+ ions that makes the hetero-valence cation doping unfavourable.

Another interesting demonstration was reported by Rogach and colleagues,51 who have recently adopted a simultaneous strontium doping and chlorine surface passivation method to improve the photo/electroluminescence efficiency of red-emitting CsPbI3 PeNCs. In their study, Sr2+ cation was incorporated into the perovskite lattice to partially replace Pb2+ cation, resulting in a slight lattice contraction and enhanced formation energy of PeNCs. Meanwhile, Cl− anion from the same precursor of Sr2+ cation (SrCl2) was used to effectively passivate the surface defects of the as-synthesized PeNCs, leading to an enhanced PLQY of red excitonic luminescence from 65% for pure CsPbI3 to 84% for Sr2+-doped CsPbI3 PeNCs.
In comparison with red and green emissions, the blue emission from diverse PeNCs that simultaneously exhibits high luminescence efficiency and narrow emission linewidth has proven to be the most challenging until now. For example, the PLQYs for pure 3-D CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 PeNCs can easily reach over 90% in the green and red spectral ranges,14,15,99 while the PLQYs for pure PeNCs based on CsPbCl3 category are usually limited to be less than 65%.99 To break through this dilemma, many metal cations such as Rb+,46 Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+,136 Ni2+,99 Zn2+, Cu+ (ref. 102) have been introduced into the lattices of diverse PeNCs to greatly improve the luminescence efficiency of blue. For instance, Sun and colleagues,99 have recently prepared a series of violet-emitting PeNCs (i.e., CsPbCl3:Ni2+) with near-unity PLQY through engineering local order of the lattice by nickel ion doping. The Ni2+ B-site doping into CsPbCl3 PeNCs gave rise to a strong single-color violet emission with a maximum PLQY of 96.5%, much higher than that of pure CsPbCl3 PeNCs (2.4%) (Fig. 9a). By utilizing a wide range of experimental characterizations including EXAFS spectra coupled with first principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), they addressed that the significantly improved luminescence efficiency of CsPbCl3:Ni2+ PeNCs relative to their pure counterparts was primarily associated with the substantially eliminated structural defects and improved short-range order of the perovskite lattice after Ni2+ B-site doping. In spite of this, it should be noted that such a doping-enhanced short-range order of perovskite lattice for improved excitonic luminescence was not achieved in other CsPbX3-type PeNCs such as CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3.

Likewise, after introducing the alkaline-earth (AE) cations of Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ into CsPbCl3 PeNCs, highly efficient violent-emission with a highest PLQY up to 77.1% was also achieved in their laboratory, which was determined to be about 96 times higher than that of synthesized without doping any foreign cation (0.8%) (Fig. 9b).136 Very recently, cation A-site doping strategy was also turned out by Sargent and colleagues to be a feasible way to produce highly efficient blue emission from 3-D CsPbBr3 PeNCs (Fig. 9c).46 After partially incorporating Rb+ ion in the lattice of A-site, blue-emitting 3-D CsPbBr3 PeNCs with tunable emission from 460 to 500 nm, narrow emission linewidths (<25 nm) and PLQYs greater than 60% were reported, thereby allowing for the fabrication of the first blue-emitting Rb-doped PeLEDs to span the wavelength range from deep-blue (464 nm) to sky-blue (490 nm). In particular, Shen and colleagues have also found that the ultra-low sodium cation (Na+) doping was very effective in improving the near-infrared luminescence of Sn–Pb alloyed PeNCs (that is, CsSn0.6Pb0.4I3) without alerting their favourable electronic bandgap structure.137 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies suggested the formation of a stronger chemical interaction between I− and Sn2+ ions upon Na+ A-site doping can potentially stabilize Sn2+ and suppress the formation of I vacancy defects. As a result, the optimized PLQY for Na+-doped CsSn0.6Pb0.4I3 PeNCs reached up to around 28%, almost two orders of magnitude enhancement when compared with their pristine counterparts without A-site Na+-doping.137
3.4. Electronic bandgap structure tuning
Based on the first-principle DFT calculations previously reported, the valence band maximum (VBM) for caesium lead halide PeNCs is contributed mainly by halide, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is contributed dominantly by Pb.138 As such, the electronic bandgap structures for various caesium lead halide PeNCs are closely related to their respective local coordination environment of [PbX6]4− octahedra in crystal lattices. In view of this, it is anticipated that the electronic bandgap tuning in caesium lead halide PeNCs can be fulfilled through intentionally changing the local coordination environment of individual [PbX6]4− octahedra, by means of partially replacing the host Pb2+ cation or X− anion in the centre or corner of [PbX6]4− octahedron with some other cations or anions. For example, the bandgap energy (Eg) for CsPbX3-type PeNCs can be readily tuned over the entire visible spectral region by only changing the X− anion in the order of Cl−, Br−, I−,8,10 where the larger halide anion (namely, the larger [PbX6]4− octahedron) results in the smaller bandgap Eg of CsPbX3-type PeNCs.
Similar to the case of the well-developed X-site substitution, the modulation of local coordination environment of [PbX6]4− octahedra in caesium lead halide PeNCs can also be implemented through cation A-site or B-site doping, thereby resulting in the altered Eg and then thus different excitonic luminescence. One of the pioneering examples of tuning the Eg of PeNCs through cation doping strategy was reported by de Mello Donega and co-workers,105 who developed a post-synthetic cation exchange method to partially exchange the host Pb2+ ion with several other M2+ divalent cations (M2+ = Sn2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+) in 3-D CsPbBr3 PeNCs, in order to yield the doped CsPb1−xMxBr3 (0 < x ≤ 0.1) NCs with preserved nanocrystal shape and size as their original ones (Fig. 2a). After the partial B-site replacement of Pb2+ with M2+, clear contractions of cubic unit cell of CsPbBr3 PeNCs, namely, [PbBr6]4− octahedra, was detected, which thereby led to a distinct blue-shift of the band edge absorption as well as PL emission from the original green spectral region to the later blue emission (Fig. 10a and b). These results strongly supported that the electronic bandgap structures of caesium lead halide PeNCs can be tuned through such a cation B-site doping strategy. In another parallel work, Meng and co-workers also reported that the replacement of B-site Pb2+ with trivalent Al3+ ion allowed for the preparation of blue-emitting 3-D CsPbBr3 PeNCs with deep-blue emission at 456 nm and narrow full width at the half-maximum of 16 nm (Fig. 10c), which was totally different from the original green-emitting CsPbBr3 PeNCs without Al3+-doping.127 Based on the calculated electronic structure and density of states of Al-doped CsPbBr3 PeNCs, such a unique blue emission centered at 456 nm after Al3+-doping was originated from the extended electronic bandgap structure, which was contributed by the hybridization of the Al s-orbitals, the Br p-orbitals, and the Pb p-orbitals (Fig. 10d).

Although the electronic bandgap structures of caesium lead halide PeNCs were weakly dependent on A-cations as they did not contribute significantly to the density of states near the Fermi level,138 however, the cation A-site doping was also found to have significant impact on the bandgap of caesium lead halide PeNCs. For example, Etgar and colleagues have recently synthesized a series of Rb+-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs with different compositions of RbxCs1−xPbX3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.8; X = Cl, Br) by using the hot injection strategy.45 The band edge absorptions for these resulting PeNCs were tunable in the near ultra-violet and visible regions between ∼395–525 nm, due to the slight lattice distortions caused by Rb+ A-site substitution.
In addition to the 3-D PeNCs abovementioned, electronic bandgap tuning was also observed in 0-D rhombohedral phase Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs through cation doping. Owing to the large insulator band gap of insulating nature (∼3.96 eV), theoretically, 0-D rhombohedral phase Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs should be non-luminescent in the visible spectral region. Particularly, unlike the well-developed 3-D CsPbX3 perovskites, the bandgap tuning in 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs, which have a size-independent band gap of an insulating nature, remains an arduous task, owing to the completely isolated [PbBr6]4− octahedra being inert to changes in the local crystal field surroundings. Very recently, we have proposed a simple but valid Sn-doping strategy to tailor the insulator bandgap (∼3.96 eV) of Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs to the blue spectral region by changing the local coordination environment of the isolated [PbBr6]4− octahedra in Cs4PbBr6 crystal.42 In our experiment, Sn cations including Sn2+ and Sn4+ from the same precursor of SnBr2 were introduced into the lattice of 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs (termed as Cs4PbBr6:Sn) in a highly Pb2+-poor and Br−-rich reaction environment we developed, forming coexisting point defects comprising substitutional SnPb and interstitial Bri and thereby endowing these theoretically non-luminescent Cs4PbBr6 NCs with an ultranarrow blue emission at ∼437 nm (FWHM, ∼12 nm, Fig. 11a). Our mechanistic investigation based on the steady-state PL and transient fs-TA spectroscopy coupled with first-principles calculations confirmed that the ultranarrow blue emission in these 0-D Cs4PbBr6:Sn PeNCs arose primarily from the unique electronic dual bandgap structure, which was composed of a newly emerged semiconducting bandgap of ∼2.87 eV and the original insulator band gap of ∼3.96 eV (Fig. 11b). Such a unique electronic dual bandgap structure was induced by the slightly changed coordination environment of the individual [PbBr6]4− octahedra due to the coexistence of SnPb and Bri point defects after Sn cation doping in the lattice of the 0-D Cs4PbBr6:Sn PeNCs.

3.5. Multiband emissions
Although multicolour emissions can be easily generated in different lead-based PeNCs like CsPbX3 by merely changing their halide compositions and nanocrystal sizes, almost all currently available pure PeNCs are characterized by single emission band over the entire visible spectral region. To date, the preparation of pure PeNCs with multiple emission bands remains a formidable challenge, because of their structural lability induced by the rapid halide anion exchange in single perovskite nanocrystal. Instead, one can gain access to multi-band-emissive lead-based PeNCs by means of cation B-site doping. As a typical example, Victor I. Klimov et al. have first developed an effective method for incorporating Mn2+ ion into the host lattice to prepare dual-band emissive Mn2+-doped CsPbX3 (termed as CsPbX3:Mn2+) PeNCs with finely tunable anion contents (Fig. 12a and b),53 which included the direct synthesis of CsPbX3:Mn PeNCs and followed by anion exchange to create the doped PeNCs of CsPbBr3:Mn and Mn:CsPbI3:Mn. By this way, the energy gaps of CsPbX3 PeNCs could be continuously and reversibly tuned over the range from 1.8 to 3.1 eV, which covered the energies both below and above the Mn2+ d–d transition (EMn = 2.15 eV) while preserving the nanocrystal size and shape. Benefitting from this result, the PL emission spectra of the resulting CsPbCl3:Mn and CsPb(Cl + Br)3:Mn PeNCs were found to feature a dominant broad emission band peaking at ∼600 nm along with the secondary excitonic luminescence of the perovskite host, thereby giving rise to overall color outputs from blue to orange-red that were visible to the naked eye (Fig. 12a and b). Noted that the broad emission band at ∼600 nm associated with the inherent 4T1–6A1 transition of Mn2+ was not detected in the CsPbBr3:Mn and CsPbI3:Mn PeNCs, which was primarily associated with their much lower energies of conduction band edge than that of the 4T1 state of Mn2+ that was unfavorable for the energy transfer from perovskite host to Mn2+ ion.

Although the newly emerged broad emission band of Mn2+ was not detected in the CsPbBr3:Mn and CsPbI3:Mn PeNCs, Mn2+-doping was also found to have a significant impact on their PL behaviors. As subsequently reported by Son52 and our groups,55 both the integrated PL intensity and PLQYs for the excitonic luminescence of CsPbBr3:Mn and CsPbI3:Mn PeNCs were detected to increase first and then decrease when doped with increased Mn2+ concentrations, in line with the most widely studied CsPbCl3:Mn PeNCs.53,64,79 Taking the PLQY for an example, the PLQYs for both the CsPbBr3:Mn and CsPbI3:Mn PeNCs were observed to increase first and then decrease with increasing the nominal Mn2+ doping concentration from 0 to 60 mol%, yielding the highest PLQYs of 57.1% and 89.6% for CsPbBr3:Mn and CsPbI3:Mn NCs at a nominal Mn2+ doping concentration of 20 mol%, respectively, which were about 1.1 and 1.4 times higher than their pure CsPbBr3 (53.3%) and CsPbI3 (65.1%) counterparts synthesized under otherwise identical experimental conditions (Fig. 12c). Such initial enhancement in the PL efficiency of CsPbX3:Mn PeNCs was conceivable due to the gradual removal of some pre-existing structural defects responsible for the low PLQY in the pure PeNCs before the optimal Mn2+ doping level, whereas the subsequent decrease in the excitonic luminescence intensity was due to the reproduced structural defects from excess Mn2+-doping.55
Subsequently, this Mn2+ B-site doping approach was refined and extended to some other cation dopants by numerous research groups to prepare diverse perovskite NCs with dual-band emissions. To date, a series of multiband (or dual-band) emissive perovskite NCs doped with Fe3+, Cd2+, Sn2+, Bi3+, Yb3+ and Bi3+/Mn2+ were prepared, which include CsPbCl3:Fe3+,97 CsPbCl3:Yb3+,114 CsPbCl3:Tb3+,112 CsPbCl3:Eu3+,112 CsPbCl3:Sm3+,112 CsPbCl3:Ce3+,112 CsPbCl3:Dy3+,112 CsPbCl3:Er3+,112 CsPb(Cl/Br)3:Yb3+,111 CsPbI3:Bi3+,135 CsPbI3:Bi3+/Mn2+,133 CsPbBr3:Tb3+/Eu2+,139 CsPbCl3:Cd2+,108 and Cs4PbBr6:Sn2+ PeNCs,42 and so on. Taking the Ln3+-doped CsPbCl3 for a typical example, owing to the rich ladder-like energy levels of Ln3+ ions spanning from the UV to visible and to NIR spectral regions, multiple sharp emission peaks from the 4f–4f transitions of different Ln3+ ions doped into the lattices of CsPbCl3 PeNCs were successfully detected, alongside of the intrinsic excitonic luminescence of CsPbCl3 PeNCs at ∼410 nm under the excitation of 365 nm light (Fig. 13). These sharp emissions of Ln3+ ions were primarily originated from the efficient energy transfer from the conduction band of CsPbCl3 host to the luminescent energy levels of Ln3+ ions. Particularly, it should be noted that the NIR emissions could be also achieved in these in these cation B-site doped PeNCs, as exemplified by the CsPbCl3:Yb3+ and CsPbI3:Bi3+ abovementioned, which is particularly significant for light-emitting and other photoelectric devices based on NIR luminescence.

3.6. Quantum cutting
Quantum cutting refers to a unique optical process capable of converting a high-energy pump photon to two or more low-energy output photons, which thereby makes the luminescent materials with a PLQY higher than unity possible. After being systematically studied in LiGdF4:Eu3+ crystal by Andries Meijerink and co-workers in 1999,140 quantum cutting has attracted significant research interest particularly in Ln3+-doped luminescent nanocrystals, because of its potential applications in energy-efficient lighting, plasma display panels and downconverters in solar-energy-conversion.
Very recently, such an exceptional optical phenomenon of quantum cutting was also realized in ytterbium (Yb3+)-doped CsPbX3 perovskite NCs.114,115,118 One of the pioneering work of quantum cutting in PeNCs was reported by Gamelin and colleagues,114 who described a hot-injection synthesis of CsPbCl3:Yb3+ NCs to reproducibly yield highly sensitized NIR luminescence at ∼990 nm originating from the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+, with an absolute PLQY s up to ∼170% upon 375 nm laser excitation (Fig. 14a). In combination with the variable-temperature stead-state PL, transient-absorption and time-resolved PL spectroscopies, the authors addressed that the formation of shallow Yb3+-induced defects played a critical role in facilitating a picosecond nonradiative energy-transfer process that de-excited the photoexcited perovskite nanocrystal and simultaneously excites two Yb3+ dopant ions, thereby resulting in the unique quantum cutting phenomenon in CsPbCl3:Yb3+ PeNCs (Fig. 14b and c). After that, by utilizing a well-developed anion exchange method, they also prepared a series of Yb3+-doped CsPb(Cl1−xBrx)3 PeNCs with tunable bandgaps (Eg) from ∼3.06 eV (∼405 nm, CsPbCl3) to ∼2.53 eV (∼490 nm, CsPb(Cl0.25Br0.75)3), in order to determine quantum cutting energy threshold in these CsPbX3:Yb3+ PeNCs (Fig. 14d). It was found that the reduced Eg would induce the rapid drop in PLQY, interpreted as the energy threshold for quantum cutting at approximately twice the energy gap between the Yb3+ 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 states, while retaining a constant PLQY above 100%. These reported results unambiguously demonstrated that the very high quantum cutting energy efficiencies could be achieved in Yb3+-doped CsPbX3 PeNCs, offering the possibility to circumvent thermalization losses in conventional solar cell technologies.

4. Optoelectronic applications
Over the past several years, pure cesium lead halide PeNCs have received considerable research interest in optoelectronics and photovoltaics because of their potential for improved stabilities and optoelectronic performances when compared to their organic–inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, all currently available optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices based on pure cesium lead halide PeNCs thus far still suffer from lower power conversion efficiency and long-term operational instability due to the unfavorable bandgap energy and intrinsic structural lability of cesium lead halide PeNCs. As discussed abovementioned, cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs usually exhibit superior physicochemical properties including improved excitonic luminescence efficiency, tunable bandgap, stabilized crystal phase as well as greatly enhanced thermal-stability and air stability relative to their pure counterparts. As a consequence of all these beneficial improvements, the optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices based on these cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs are expected to outperform their pure counterparts in terms of device power conversion efficiency and long-term operational stability.
4.1. Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs)
As a new generation of solid-state lighting (SSL) devices, PeLEDs usually consist of an intrinsic active layer in a double heterojunction structure with an n-type electron-transport layer and a p-type hole-transporting layer,141 where the cesium lead halide PeNCs serve as exciton recombination centers and also act as light emitters during device operation.142–144 Because of the higher luminescence efficiency with respect to blue-emissive CsPbCl3 PeNCs, green-emitting and red-emitting PeLEDs based on cation-doped CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 are the most studied to date (Table 3). Owing to the improved optoelectronic properties through cation doping, in most cases, the PeLEDs fabricated by using cation-doped CsPbX3 PeNCs as light emitters usually have much better device performance than their pure counterparts. As a typical example, we have recently demonstrated that the Mn2+-doped CsPbBr3 PeNCs functioned very well as efficient green light emitters to fabricate high-performance PLEDs with higher maximum luminance and external quantum efficiency (EQE) when compared to the PLEDs based on pure CsPbBr3 NCs, irrespective of their identical multilayer-structured architecture comprising indium tin oxide (ITO), poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), poly-TPD, CsPbBr3:Mn or pure CsPbBr3 NCs, TPBi, LiF, and Al layers (Fig. 15a–c).55 By adopting the similar device architecture, Liu and co-workers128 also fabricated the green-emitting PLEDs by using pure and Sn-doped CsPbBr3 PeNCs as emitters. Benefiting from the significantly improved PLQY of excitonic luminescence of CsPbBr3 from 45% to 83% after Sn-doping, the device performance for CsPb0.67Sn0.33Br3-based green-emitting PLEDs was found to be much better than that based on pure CsPbBr3 PeNCs especially at high driving voltages. As a result, the maximum luminance and EQE for the best device, based on CsPb0.67Sn0.33Br3 QDs, were determined to be 12500 cd m−2 and 4.13%, respectively, about 2.6 and 4.7 times higher than the devices by using pure CsPbBr3 PeNCs as green emitters (Fig. 15d).

Subsequently, various cations doped PeNCs were employed as light emitters to develop more efficient red-emitting, green-emitting or blue-emitting PLEDs, as exemplified by CsPbI3:Sr2+,50,51 CsPbI3:Zn2+,106,145 CsPbBrI2:Cu2+,104 CsPbBr3:Ce3+,113 CsPbCl1.7Br1.3:Ni2+,101 CsPbBr3:Rb+,46 CsPbI3:Ag+,109 CsPbCl3:Mn2+,57,58,80 and so forth. Among these previously reported PeLEDs, the red-emitting PeLEDs based on Zn2+-doped CsPbI3 NCs were reported to have the highest peak EQE value up to 15.1%, significantly larger than those of PeLEDs based on the pure CsPbI3 PeNCs (∼6.5%) and other PeLEDs, as compared in Table 3. This significant enhancement in EQE of red-emitting PeLEDs was primarily attributed to the elimination of the hole injection barrier in PeLEDs after Zn-doping in CsPbI3 PeNCs. Despite these attractions, it should be noted that high-performance PeLEDs based on cation-doped PeNCs were generally restricted to the red-emitting or green-emitting PeLED devices, and the fabrication of efficient blue PeLEDs has been met with limited success even using Ni2+-doped CsPbCl3 or CsPb(Cl/Br)3 PeNCs with an absolute PLQY of blue emission over 80%.101 To date, the highest EQEs achieved in blue-emitting PeLEDs based on Ni2+-doped146 and Mn2+-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)374 PeNCs were only determined to be 2.4% and 2.12%, respectively, with their corresponding maximum luminance to be ∼612 cd m−2 at 470 nm and 245 cd m−2 at 466 nm, lagging far behind the green-emitting and red-emitting cousins (Table 3). To this regard, great efforts are absolutely needed to develop appropriate blue-emitting PeNCs for fabricating high-performance blue PeLEDs with comparable EQE as those of the red and green ones.30
In addition to the energy conversion efficiency, another major issue needed to be addressed for cesium lead halide-based PeLEDs is the limited device operational stability. Although the operational stability of cesium lead halide-based PeLEDs has been significantly improved since 2015, but it is still much inferior to the stability of OLEDs and QD-LEDs in the range of 10000 to 100000 h.141 In principle, low device stability for PeLEDs is mainly ascribed to intrinsic instability of cesium lead halide PeNCs themselves and the instability of constituent layers and interfaces in devices. To overcome this dilemma, many researchers have devoted efforts to improve the long-term operational instability of PeLED devices. Among which, utilizing the cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs with much better stability relative to their pure counterparts as light emitters is considered to be the most straightforward method. For instance, Yao and co-workers50 have recently fabricated a series of red-emitting PeLEDs by using Sr2+-doped α-phase CsPbI3 (α-CsPbI3:Sr2+) PeNCs as light emitters. The operational lifetime for the α-phase CsPbI3:Sr2+-based PeLEDs was significantly improved to 120 min and the device could be operated continuously for even 15 h, whereas the luminance of the control device using undoped α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs dropped to half of the initial value after only 10 min under a driving voltage of 6.0 V (Fig. 15e). Although the device results reported wherein were preliminary, the cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs showed promise as light emitters for fabricating long-term stable PeLEDs.

Another promising application for cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs is white-PeLEDs. The perfect combination of high PLQY and narrow emission linewidths with wide color selectivity endows them with promising potentials in white-PeLEDs. In general, white PeLEDs are composed of UV- or blue-emitting chips with a coating of either a single-color phosphor or dual-color phosphor or a combination of blue-, red-, and green-emitting perovskite NCs. Among which, GaN or InGaN or other semiconducting chips that emit near-UV or blue light are usually adopted as a primary radiation source, and the role of perovskite NCs is to absorb a certain fraction of the near-UV or blue radiation light and then re-emit desirable green or red light to deliver an overall white light output with desired hue.141 One of the pioneering works in white PeLEDs was reported by Meng et al.,127 who first synthesized highly efficient blue-emitting CsPbBr3 PeNCs through B-site Al3+-doping and then combined them with green-emitting CsPbBr3 and red-emitting CdSe@ZnS NCs to fabricate UV-pumped white PeLEDs (Fig. 16a and b). The fabricated white PeLEDs exhibited a pure white light with a color coordinate at (0.32, 0.34) in CIE 1931 and a luminous efficiency of 21.6 lm W−1. Due to the narrow emission wavelength of the green CsPbBr3 and blue Al3+-doped CsPbBr3 PeNCs, the color gamut overlap of the NTSC space was 116% from the fabricated white PeLEDs, which was higher than a previously designed regular phosphor LED (NTSC 86%) and Cd-QD LED (NTSC 104%). Particularly, Congreve and colleagues have recently fabricated the first all-perovskite white PeLED by combing the blue-emitting Mn2+-doped CsPb(Cl/Br)3 with green CsPbBr3 and red CsPbI3 PeNCs (Fig. 16c and d).74 Wherein, a blue PeLEDs that emit a blue emission centered at 468 nm meeting the NTSC requirement was first fabricated, and then used as a blue-emitting chip to simultaneously excite the red and green downconverters made from PeNCs and provided blue emission component in all-perovskite white PeLEDs. The prepared all-perovskite white PeLED exhibited a peak luminance of 102 cd m−2 and an efficiency of 0.25%, indicating the possibility of access to the all-perovskite white PeLEDs. Although a step forward, much work remains to be done before these all-perovskite white PeLEDs are stable enough for practical applications.

4.3. Perovskite solar cells and other devices
Organic inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are a promising photovoltaic technology that has made unprecedented progress in the past decade.147 To date, the highest certified power conversation efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 23%, which is even on par with that of state-of-the-art crystalline silicon solar cells.148 However, the volatility of the organic components in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites has become a serious handicap to the long-term stability of PSCs and optoelectronic devices. All-inorganic PeNCs particularly for α-phase CsPbI3 perovskite is ideal for photovoltaic applications to overcome the organic cation-related long-term stability issue. Although α-phase CsPbI3 has excellent optoelectronic properties including a desired bandgap of about 1.72 eV and a strong absorption in the whole visible light region, it can rapidly degrade to the undesired non-perovskite δ-phase under ambient air conditions, making them unsuitable for long-term stable photovoltaic applications.141,149 Motivated by the recent advance in the stabilized α-phase CsPbI3 PeNCs through cation doping,149 we expect further progress in the direction of building long-term stable and efficient PSCs by utilizing cation-doped α-phase CsPbI3 as photovoltaic absorbers, as exemplified by the CsPbI3:Sn2+,129 CsPbI3:Ni2+,100 CsPbI3:Sb3+,132 CsPbI3:Yb3+ (ref. 122) PeNCs discussed in section 4.1. Recently, Pradhan and co-workers have fabricated a solar cell by adopting optimally Sb3+-doped CsPbI3 NCs, which significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbI3 from 8.2% to 9.4% with superior device stability.132 The optimized Sb3+-doped CsPbI3 devices retained 97% of their initial PCE after aging under ambient conditions (temperature 24 ± 3 °C and relative humidity 44 ± 6%) for 480 hours, whereas the PCE for the device based on the pure CsPbI3 was observed to decrease by 34% under otherwise identical operational conditions. Similarly, Ma et al. constructed a solar cell based on Yb3+-doped CsPbI3 PeNCs with the best PCE up to 13.12%, concomitant with a significant improved stability under ambient air conditions compared to its pure counterpart.122
In addition to the devices of PeLED, white PeLED and PSC abovementioned, some other work related to device applications is also worth noting. Song et al. reported that Yb3+ and Ce3+ co-doped PeNCs could be successful self-assembled on the surface of commercial silicon solar cells (SSCs) by a simple liquid-phase depositing method to enhance device performance, resulting in extraordinary PCE enhancement from 18.1% to 21.5%.111 Additionally, the as-prepared Mn2+-doped CsPbCl3 PeNCs were employed on the perovskite solar cells as the energy-downshift (EDS) layer by converting UV light to visible light was achieved by Wang et al.62 Due to the elimination of UV rays by the EDS layer, after 100 hours of exposure to UV region (5 mW cm−2), the stability of solar cells increased from 85% to 97% of their initial efficiency. In recent years, the luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) is the most compelling class of photonic devices that rely on the so-called Stokes shift engineering transmitter, which have recently been proposed as an effective complement to traditional photovoltaic modules for building-integrated photovoltaic devices. Meinardi et al. exhibited the suitability of Mn2+-doped CsPbCl3 PeNCs as nearly zero reabsorption emitters for LSC. The LSC behaved closely to an ideal device, in which all portions of the device surface contribute nearly equally to its total power output.59 Later, Wu et al. demonstrated an optimized quantum cutting LSCs (QC-LSC) fabricated from Yb3+-doped CsPbCl3 PeNCs displayed an internal optical efficiency (ηint) of 118.1 ± 6.7% that was 2-fold higher than previous records using Mn2+-doped PeNCs.115 Additionally, the optoelectronic applications of some representative cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs are summarized. The results suggest the great potential of cation-doped perovskite NCs not only in PeLEDs and PSCs, but also in photodetectors,150 temperature sensors,68 O2 sensors81 and field effect transistors (FETs).110
5. Conclusions and perspectives
Cation-doped all-inorganic cesium lead halide PeNCs especially for the category of CsPbX3 have been well developed in the past few years as a new class of superstar semiconductors with excellent physicochemical properties and great potentials for a broad range of applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaics. While still being in its infancy, significant advances have been made from controllable synthesis, stability issues to novel optoelectronic properties and to related PeLED and PSC applications. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed in the future before their real-world applications and commercialization.
One foremost work is to further improve their long-term stability of cation-doped all-inorganic cesium lead halide PeNCs themselves under harsh conditions (for example, high temperature and humidity), especially for solid-state lighting applications. We believe such a goal may be achieved by means of epitaxial growth of an inert inorganic shell such as inorganic fluorides around the optically active PeNCs, forming core–shell structured nanocomposites in which the inner optically active PeNCs are entirely prevented from external oxygen and moisture over extended periods of time. Besides, by taking advantage of the extremely high electronegativity of fluoride, the partial F substitution on the X-site of cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs may pave another new way to simultaneously stabilize the perovskite crystal phase and passivate the luminescence quenching defects associated with anion and cation vacancies through a unique strengthening of the chemical bonds with the surrounding lead and cesium cations, thereby allowing for the development of highly luminescent and long-term stable PeNCs under ambient air conditions. Another weak link is the lack of a generalized protocol for the controlled synthesis of cation-doped cesium lead halide PeNCs with desired doping content and crystallographic site, substantial efforts are absolutely needed to achieve this goal. Last but not the least, it should be noted that most studies on the cation doped caesium lead halide PeNCs have focused on monovalent cations on the A-site, divalent metals on the B-site, and a halide ion on the X-site in 3-D ABX3-type PeNCs, the doping events in lower dimensional perovskite structures such as 0-D Cs4PbX6 and 2-D CsPb2X5 remain nearly unexplored to date. Although rare, a few of reports as exemplified by Sn-doped Cs4PbX6 have demonstrated the unique optical performances that cannot be realized in the 3-D ABX3-type perovskite lattice.42

Note that the unique Pb2+-poor and Br−-rich reaction environment for the synthesis of the blue-emitting 0-D Cs4PbBr6:Sn PeNCs was achieved by replacing the vast majority of the PbBr2 precursor with SnBr2 (SnBr2/(SnBr2 + PbBr2) = 80 mol%) in a conventional hot-injection reaction medium used to synthesize green-emitting 3-D CsPbBr3 PeNCs, and the Pb2+-poor reaction medium for the synthesis of pure 0-D Cs4PbBr6 PeNCs was achieved by partially adding the PbBr2 precursor (20% of that for the green-emitting CsPbBr3 PeNCs) into the reaction environment.
