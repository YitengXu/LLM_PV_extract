    , Accepted 27th March 2020First published on 1st April 2020AbstractThe progress of two-dimensional (2D) MXene-derived QDs (MQDs) is in the early stages, but the materials have aroused great interest due to their high electrical conductivity, abundant active catalytic sites, easily tunable structure, satisfactory dispersibility, remarkable optical properties, good biocompatibility, manifold functionalizations, and so on. However, up to now, there is still no review paper on MQDs. Herein, the research advances of MQDs, including their synthetic routes (top-down and bottom-up methods), properties (structural, electronic, optical and magnetic properties), functionalizations (surface modifications, heteroatom doping and the construction of composites) and applications (sensing, biomedical, catalysis, energy storage and optoelectronic devices etc.), are critically highlighted, and the future prospects and challenges of MQDs are discussed. This review will serve as a one-stop point for comprehending the most advanced developments of MQDs, and will hopefully enlighten researchers to employ MQDs for satisfying the growing requirements of the diverse applications.
1. Introduction
So far, the resounding success of graphene materials has activated infinite passion to seek newly-fashioned 2D layered inorganic materials, such as silicene, black phosphorus (BP), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and MXenes etc., to meet new application requirements.1–8 In the bulk structure, these materials possess features of robust intralayer covalent bonds and weak interlayer interactions of van der Waals (vdWs). Meanwhile, their steady 2D forms (single or few-layer) could be developed and exhibit distinguishing properties to their bulk forms.9–11 Considering their similar 2D structure, these materials have diverse physico-chemical and optical–electrical properties, rendering them to applications in many fields.1,2,12–14 Compared to their 2D forms, when they are transformed to quantum dot (QD) forms (namely with a lateral size of usually <10 nm), the higher surface area and forceful quantum confinement effect etc. would bring more meritorious properties, and the inherent merit of the 2D counterpart will be inherited simultaneously.1,15,16 The emerging groups of 2D material derived QDs are provided with improved properties in comparison to their 2D counterparts, such as better dispersibility, easier functionalization, more novel luminescence, and so on. The extraordinary and diverse properties of 2D material derived QDs enable them to be widely used in sensing, biomedical, optoelectronic device, catalysis, and energy storage applications etc. (Fig. 1A).1–3,12,17,18

(B) Number of journal publications on MXenes (Source: Web of Science, Keyword: MXenes). (C) MXenes reported so far. MXenes can have at least three different formulas: M2X, M3X2 and M4X3. They can be made in three different forms: mono-M elements (e.g. Ti2C); a solid solution of at least two different M elements (e.g. (Ti, V)3C2); ordered double-M elements, in which one transition metal occupies the perimeter layers and another fills the central M layers (e.g. Mo2TiC2, in which the outer M layers are Mo and the central M layers are Ti). Solid solutions on the X site produce carbonitrides.19 Copyright 2017 Nature Reviews Materials. 
Among these 2D materials, MXenes, a new group of 2D inorganic materials, are often obtained by etching out the A layers from the MAX phase (“M” represents transition metals, “A” represents group IIIA/IVA elements and X represents C and/or N elements). MXenes possess a general formula: Mn+1XnTx (n = 1–3, Tx represents the surface termination groups such as –O, –F and –OH).20–22 Since the first report of an MXene (Ti3C2) in 2011,23 dozens of MXenes, including Ti2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, Nb2CTx, V2CTx, (Ti0.5, Nb0.5)2C, (V0.5, Cr0.5)3C2, Ti3CNTx and Ta4C3Txetc., have been reported (Fig. 1B and C).19,24–26 They exhibit great application potential in batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, electromagnetic interference shielding, sensors, biomedical, optoelectronic devices and catalysis fields etc., due to their excellent electrically conductive, flexibility, sensitive surface termination and environmentally friendly characteristics.27–36 Recently, the first example of the QDs form (Ti3C2) was reported, whose size could be tuned from 2.9 nm to 6.2 nm by changing the synthesis temperature.37 The emergence of nanosized MQDs has aroused great interest and opens the door for further versatile theoretical and experimental studies of MQDs in the near future. Like other QDs, the MQDs exhibit multifarious fascinating properties, including natural hydrophilicity, satisfactory biocompatibility, ready functionalization, and excellent photoluminescence (PL) properties, because of their size and quantum confinement effects, and the unrivalled properties immediately expand their applications to optoelectronic, biological, catalysis, and energy areas etc.1,3,38–41
To date there have only been a small number of research articles and high-quality review papers regarding 2D MXenes,13,42–45 and the research on MQDs is increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to write a review paper of MQDs, which could provide a crucial role in guiding the future research of MQDs. Herein, we aim to summarize the updated research advances and provide critical insights into the booming topic of “MQDs”. In this review, the synthetic techniques, unique properties, and extensive applications of MQDs are summarized, and the challenges and future prospects in this field are briefly discussed (Fig. 2). This review will contribute to the unfolding and will guide new research directions of MQDs to satisfy the high requirements in diverse applications.

2. Synthesis of MQDs
Synthesis methods for QDs have been extensively developed over the past decade. Generally, the strategies include two groups: top-down and bottom-up methods. By varying the synthetic method, we can adjust their size, control their morphology and structure, as well as functionalize them, rendering satisfactory structures and properties of the prepared QDs.1,2 MQDs are an important part of QDs, and the above synthesis strategies can also be suitable for MQDs; the reported syntheses of MQDs are summarized as follows (Table 1).

2.1. Top-down methods
In the top-down methods, QDs (e.g. graphene, g-C3N4, BP, MoS2etc.) are usually synthesized via the cleavage of relatively large bulk precursors by chemical, electrochemical (EC), or physical methods.74–77 For most top-down methods, oxygen-containing functional groups were first established on 2D nanosheets, upon which defects could be created. The defects could then serve as chemically reactive sites, allowing a layered structure to be cut into smaller structures, and finally into QDs.1,78 The top-down methods have the superiorities of simple operation, the use of abundant raw materials, and large-scale production. However, they are also limited in some shortcomings, such as a low production yield and the requirement for special treatments.1,2,12
Up to now, the top-down methods have been widely used to obtain MQDs (most of them are Ti3C2 QDs). According to the different synthesis conditions, the “top-down methods” mainly include hydrothermal/solvothermal, ultrasonic, ball-milling, intercalation and combined methods.37,38,41,46–48,63 Among these methods, the hydrothermal method is the most common method, using the 2D MXenes as precursors.3,20,37,39,40,49,51,56–58,65 Generally, the hydrothermal reaction temperature (HRT) is greatest at 100–150 °C, and the reactants are in neutral or slightly alkaline or slightly acidic environments (pH = 6–9). The reaction time depends on the HRT and the pH, and usually the higher HRT and pH leads to a shorter reaction time. Furthermore, the size, morphology and properties of MQDs can also be adjusted by changing these reaction conditions. For instance, Xue et al.37 first reported that the Ti3C2 QDs could be prepared by a hydrothermal method (Fig. 3A). The colloidal Ti3C2 QDs with different sizes could be obtained through adjusting the hydrothermal temperature, where the average lateral sizes (ALS) of the Ti3C2 QDs were 2.9, 3.7, and 6.2 nm, and the average thicknesses (AT) were 0.99, 0.91, and 0.89 nm, at 100 °C, 120 °C, and 150 °C, respectively. These results revealed that the majority of Ti3C2 QDs were monolayers. Meanwhile, at a relatively low reaction temperature (100 °C), the Ti3C2 QDs showed the original structure of MXene, and this could be confirmed according to the lattice spacing of 0.266 nm assigned to the (0110) plane of Ti3C2 MXene. However, when the reaction temperature was 150 °C, a number of the Ti atoms were drawn out and an amorphous structure appeared (Fig. 3B–G). Since then, more Ti3C2 QDs have been prepared under different hydrothermal conditions.39,40,49,51,58,65 Furthermore, the heteroatom-doped Ti3C2 QDs, including N-Ti3C2 QDs, P-Ti3C2 QDs, S-Ti3C2 QDs, P, N-Ti3C2 QDs and S, N-Ti3C2 QDs,3,56,57 have also been synthesized via a hydrothermal method by adding the corresponding precursor of the elements in the reaction system. All these heteroatom-doped Ti3C2 QDs displayed an ultra-small size, and exhibited better performance in various applications. Except for Ti3C2 QDs, Cao et al.20 also reported that the V2C QDs could be prepared via the hydrothermal method (pH = 9, 160 °C for 10 h) using the V2C nanosheets as a precursor. The V2C QDs exhibited ALS and AT values of 16 and 0.8 nm, respectively, indicating that a majority of the V2C QDs were monolayers.

Similar to the hydrothermal method, the solvothermal method has also been used to synthesize MQDs. Instead of using water as the reaction medium, as in the hydrothermal method, organic solvents such as ethanol, dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were used as the reaction medium in the solvothermal method. Compared to the hydrothermal method, the solvothermal method could better control the size, dispersion and morphology of MQDs.41,79,80 Xu et al.41 utilized Ti3C2 MXene as the precursor to prepare three Ti3C2 QDs by the solvothermal method, namely e-Ti3C2 QDs, f-Ti3C2 QDs and s-Ti3C2 QDs, using ethanol, DMF and DMSO as the solvent, respectively (Fig. 3H). The results showed that all supernatants exhibited good dispersion, stability and different colors (Fig. 3I), and all of them were derived from the Ti3C2 MXene according to their matched lattice parameters. Meanwhile, the sizes of the MQDs were significantly dependent on the solvents, their ALS values were 1.8 ± 0.1, 2.5 ± 0.2, and 3.3 ± 0.2 nm for s-Ti3C2 QDs, e-Ti3C2 QDs, and f-Ti3C2 QDs, respectively, and their AT values were in the range of 1.0–2.5 nm, indicating that these Ti3C2 QDs were few-layered. Their different sizes could be as a result of the co-action of the polarity, boiling point, and oxidation degree of the solvents.81,82
Compared to the simple hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, combining ultrasound and hydrothermal/solvothermal methods could be the most effective strategies,38,47,62,72 since ultrasonication can cause acoustic cavitation and shockwaves in a ‘‘good solvent’’. Meanwhile, it is beneficial for degassing to suppress the oxidation of MXenes, resulting in delaminating and accelerating the fragmentation of 2D MXenes to QDs.83,84 In general, two ultrasonic means are frequently employed, namely probe ultrasonic and bath ultrasonic methods. The probe ultrasonic method exhibits the larger crushing strength, where the obtained materials are more dispersed and finer in comparison to the bath ultrasonic method. However, the operation of an ultrasonic probe requires more cautious attention.85 Zeng et al.38 employed the ultrasound-hydrothermal method to prepare Ti3C2 QDs. In detail, the dispersion of the Ti3C2 sheet precursor was first performed by two stages of ultrasound, including a tip sonication (120 W) for 6 h in an Ar atmosphere and subsequent bath sonication (300 W) for 10 h. Afterwards, the dispersion was hydrothermally treated at 120 °C overnight. Zhou et al.47 developed Ti3C2-derived graphene QDs (GQDs) by the ultrasound-solvothermal method. The results showed that the product yield of GQDs reached as high as 32.6%. Furthermore, the V2C QDs have also been well prepared via the ultrasound-hydrothermal method.72
In addition to the above synthesis strategies, some other top-down approaches could be introduced to prepare MQDs, such as direct ultrasound, ball-milling, intercalation etc.46,48,54,63,66,67,69 For example, ultra-small Ti3C2 QDs (ALS: 4.9 nm, AT: 1.2 nm) have been synthesized via a two-step ultrasound strategy (probe sonication at 480 W for 6 h) to break the bulk into smaller sizes in order to expose the fresh edges and surfaces. Subsequent bath sonication (300 W, 10 h) was used to split the Ti3C2 nanosheets in 28.6% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) aqueous solution using the bulk Ti3AlC2 as a precursor (Fig. 4A).46 Similarly, the Ti3C2 QDs and Ti2C QDs have also been prepared by the intercalation-ultrasound method, namely that the MXene nanosheet precursors were first reacted in 25% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) aqueous solution for 24 h. Subsequently, the intercalated-MXenes were treated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 h to obtain Ti3C2 or Ti2C QDs (Fig. 4B).66,67 In addition, the Mo2C QDs have also been prepared through a simpler one-step bath ultrasonic treatment (400 W, 2 h, room temperature) using Mo2C powder as a precursor.69 Furthermore, it has also been reported that the Ti3C2 QDs can be obtained by reflux method, namely the prepared TMAOH intercalated multilayered Ti3C2 was thermally refluxed in 2.5% TMOAH for 24 h at 110 °C.54 The obtained Ti3C2 QDs with high yields (∼60%) have good dispersibility (3–4.8 nm). In addition, the Ti3C2 QDs can also be constructed by the ball-milling method. Zhang et al.48 found that Ti3C2 QDs with different sizes were formed when ball-milling Ti3C2 MXene with different solid-state elements (carbon, sulfur, red phosphorus or silicon) under an Ar shield (Fig. 4C). However, it is difficult to remove solid-state elements from the final products due to the formation of Ti–O–P (or C, or S, or Si) bonds, and hence this method is more suitable for synthesizing composite materials (Fig. 4D). Although the operation of the above method is relatively simple, the satisfactory MQDs can also be obtained, as long as the preparation conditions are well controlled, therefore research on simpler synthesis methods should be encouraged.

Although the above top-down methods are effective for obtaining MQDs, they still have some disadvantages, such as time consumption, low production yield, and low repeatability. Thus more effort should be paid into investigating more superior synthesis methods, such as electrochemical methods, alkali metal (e.g. Li or K) intercalation, microwave irradiation, and so on, and these methods have been widely studied in the synthesis of other QD materials, possessing the advantages of simple operation, eco-friendliness, low cost, good reproducibility, and easy large-scale preparation etc.1,12,86,87
2.2. Bottom-up methods
Compared to the top-down methods using the bulk materials as precursors, the bottom-up methods employ the molecular materials as precursors.1,88 The MQDs could also be synthesized from small organic and inorganic molecular precursors via bottom-up methods. Bottom-up methods possess some virtues, such as sufficient atomic utilization, better structure and morphology control, and easier functionalization etc., endowing the QDs with better configurations and properties.2,70,71
Recently, Cheng et al.70 obtained a Mo2C QDs/carbon nanosheet (Mo2C/C) composite via a molten salt synthesis strategy (Fig. 5A). In summary, the molybdenum acetylacetonate precursor, sucrose and NaCl were mixed evenly. Afterwards, the mixture was calcinated at 800 °C for 2 h under Ar protection. TEM and HRTEM images showed that the size of the Mo2C QDs was about 2–3 nm, the interplanar spacing was about 2.37 Å, which corresponded with the (002) plane of Mo2C. Wang et al.71 employed a pyrolysis method to synthesize a Mo2C QDs/carbon polyhedron composite (Fig. 5B). In detail, Mo/ZIF-8 was prepared first using molybdic acid, zinc acetate and 2-methylimidazole as precursors, then Mo/ZIF-8 was pyrolyzed at 700 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere. Finally, the zinc species was removed by acidic etching. The formed Mo2C QDs showed an ALS of 4.5 nm, and their lattice spacing (0.24 nm) matched well with the (111) plane of cubic-Mo2C.

The above studies provide a good basis for the preparation of MQDs by bottom-up methods, but simple, efficient and low-toxicity precursors, mild reaction conditions, good crystallinity and monodispersity, as well as high yields for large-scale production still need to be considered. Meanwhile, due to the relatively simple operation in comparison to top-down methods, the one-pot bottom-up methods are supposed to prepare MQDs in order to meet requirements of incremental applications in the future. Therefore, although there is limited research on bottom-up methods for the synthesis of MQDs, the research is promising and more attention should be paid on these strategies.
3. Properties of MQDs
The 2D MXenes possess many excellent properties. Therefore, MQDs will not only inherit the excellent properties of 2D MXenes, but they will also exhibit unique properties due to quantum size effects.1,2 In this review, the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties, as well as the functionalization, of MQDs have been summarized and discussed.
3.1. Structural properties
The research on the structure of MQDs is of great significance for comprehending their properties. Typically, the MXenes were prepared by etching out the “A” element of the MAX phases, and this could be confirmed by the XRD pattern (Fig. 6A). The difference between 2D MXenes and MQDs lies in the different sizes, where the MQDs exhibit single or fewer layers in thickness and the diameter is usually less than 10 nm.37,41 Meanwhile, since the MAX phases have hexagonal symmetry, the derived MQD systems form hexagonal lattices with the same symmetry, as shown in Fig. 6B.69 Moreover, the Mn+1Xn MXenes consist of 2n+1 layers, where the ‘‘X’’ layer is clamped by two ‘‘M’’ layers, and the topological height of a single MXene stack is generally <1 nm.25 Furthermore, the coordination amount of a transition metal ion is usual six, so it is natural to assume that the transition metals in MXenes make six chemical bonds with the neighboring X atoms.43,89

(I) The side and top views of the O-terminated Ti3C2 QDs model.38 Copyright 2019 Advanced Functional Materials. 
Additionally, in all practical cases, MQDs are terminated with surface groups (e.g. –F, –OH and –O) resulting from the etching of the MAX phase. For instance, Qin et al.54 fabricated Ti3C2 QDs by the top-down method, and their XPS and FTIR spectra both indicated the existence of –F, –OH, and –O groups (Fig. 6C and D). Furthermore, O– and OH-terminated MXenes were considered to be more stable, due to the fact that –F termination is easily superseded by –OH when washed and/or stored in water.90,91 Meanwhile, previous studies also showed that the –OH group could be transformed into –O termination at high temperatures and/or in the metal adsorption process.92 As shown in Fig. 6E and F, the OH group decreases and the O element increases with the increase of synthesis temperature.37 O-terminated MXenes can further convert to bare MXenes after contact with Mg, Ca, and Al metals etc.92 Previous forecasts suggested that the terminated groups stand a good chance of being located above the hollow positions between three adjacent C atoms. Nevertheless, recent research has indicated that the positions of the terminated groups are more complex than predicted. Three feasible positions for these surface groups have been put forward: (a) located on the roof of “M” atoms, (b) at hollow position I between three adjacent “X” atoms below the “M” atoms, and (c) at hollow position II on roof of the “X” atoms. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation found that the terminated groups situated at position I on the two sides of the MXenes should be the most stable form for most MXenes, because of less steric hindrance. However, position II would be better for MXenes, when the “M” atoms cannot offer enough electrons (e−) for both “X” atoms and surface groups. In particular, O-termination requires two e− to consolidate its adsorption site, and this differs from OH– and F-terminations, which just need one e− from the “M” atoms. As a result, O-termination on MXenes with low valence “M” atoms are inclined to be located at position II or in a mixture of position I and II (Fig. 6G and H).89,93,94 The accurate position of the terminated groups depends on both their type and the composition of the MXenes, and this requires further investigation.
Notably, MXenes are frequently modeled with consistent terminated types, which is unrealistic. In order to more precisely present the complex structure of the MXenes system, further modeling is needed to adapt to the coexistence and random adsorption of multifarious terminated groups in MXenes. Meanwhile, interlayer interactions, such as vdW's forces, hydrogen bonding etc., should also be considered, due to the frequent occurrence of stacking.42,92,94–98 Compared to the 2D MXenes, the model of MQDs could be constructed in a more precise way due to the finite thickness of MQDs, thus their properties can be predicted more accurately using DFT calculations. For example, Zeng et al.38 built the Ti3C2 QDs model of a hexagonal cluster with a diameter of 24.3 Å for a DFT calculation (Fig. 6K), where the size of the model was close to that of the experiment, and so the results of DFT calculations will be more reliable.
3.2. Electronic properties
The electronic properties of MXenes are of great importance. As for the MQDs, their electronic properties should be more attractive due to their small-size effect. In principle, the MQDs have metallic conductivity with high electron density close to the Fermi level (EF), because of d–e− from the “M” atoms.89 Experiments have shown that the electric conductivities of MXene sheets are analogous to multilayered graphene (resistance in the range of 22–339 Ω) and are higher than those of carbon nanotubes and reduced graphene oxide materials.36,98 However, the electronic conductivity is adjustable according to the composition and terminated groups of MQDs, and it has been discovered that the resistance is enhanced by the number of layers and the existence of surface groups, thus the nanosized MQDs will be better for electron transfer in comparison to their stacked counterparts.98,99 Meanwhile, in a well-organized double-“M” form, it must be emphasized that the outer “M” layers have more effect on the electronic properties than the inner “M” layer.100 For instance, Zhang et al.39,48 applied Ti3C2 QDs to elevate the performance of a lithium–sulfur battery. Zeng et al.38,58,70 also verified that the activity of photo/electrocatalysts can be improved by MQDs (Ti3C2 QDs and Mo2C QDs). The improved performance could be due to the excellent electrical conductivity of MQDs, which dramatically facilitates the charge transfer and provides more active sites (Fig. 7A–C). Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the MXene nitrides and carbonitrides possess higher density of states (DOS) overall than MXene carbides, and this could be due to the more robust “M”–N bond (in comparison to “M”–C bond) and the additional nitrogen electron, thus resulting in superior electrical conductivity.98

(E and F) The calculated Fermi level and DOS of O-terminated Ti3C2 QDs.38 Copyright 2019 Advanced Functional Materials. 
The energy band structure (EBS) and DOS of MXenes have been widely investigated through DFT calculations. The EBS was drawn along the high symmetry points of the hexagonal BZ, and the DOS was projected on the “M”-d and “X”-p states.99 It should be highlighted that the terminated groups could significantly alter the electronic properties, and this could result from the formation of new bands below EF, and so EF would decrease, thus dramatically reducing the DOS, raising the d band up above EF and generating an energy gap (Eg),93,98 especially for O-terminated MXenes such as Ti2CO2, Zr2CO2, Hf2CO2, Sc2CF2, Sc2C(OH)2, and Sc2CO2 with Eg values of 0.24, 0.88, 1.0, 1.03, 0.45, and 1.8 eV, respectively. Among these MXenes, apart from Sc2C(OH)2 that is calculated as a direct band-gap semiconductor, all others are recognized as indirect band-gap semiconductors.101 This occurs because of the hybridization between the p-orbital of surface terminations and the d-orbital of “M” atoms. Additionally, the work function (WF) of MXenes was also predicted by DFT. Generally, the rank of WF follows: O– > F– ≥ bare > OH-terminated MXenes, owing to the surface terminations that cause the EF to shift lower, thus enhancing the WF of O– and F-terminated MXenes.93,102 Xu et al.56 employed DFT calculations to investigate the DOS of both pristine Ti3C2O2 QDs and N-Ti3C2O2 QDs. For pristine Ti3C2O2 QDs, both Eg and a sub-gap (Sg) exist, however, for N-Ti3C2O2 QDs, the Eg broadens and incorporates the gap states in the Sg, as shown in Fig. 7D. Zeng et al.38 also calculated the DOS and Fermi levels of O-terminated Ti3C2 QDs. The results indicated that O-terminated Ti3C2 QDs exhibit plentiful electronic states across the EF, revealing the distinguished conductivity of O-terminated Ti3C2 QDs (Fig. 7E and F).
Furthermore, a few MXenes are identified as 2D topological insulators (TIs).103,104 In such materials, the opposite spin e− will travel in the opposite direction at the edge states, leading to low electron transmission loss.105 For such 2D materials containing heavy elements, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) markedly impacts the electronic properties, for instance MXenes with 4d and 5d “M” (Mo, W, Zr, and Hf) will form 2D Tis, and these have broad application prospects in low-power spintronic devices and quantum computing etc.103 DFT calculations have made great progress in comprehending the electronic properties of MXenes, although the difference between calculated and laboratorial properties always exists. Overall, the magic electronic properties of MXenes change from conductor to semiconductor and insulator, and this could give MQDs the potential to be used in many fields.
3.3. Optical properties
The optical properties of MQDs, including light absorption, photoluminescence (PL), electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and so on, are very useful for their applications in biomedical, optoelectronic catalysis, and optoelectronic device fields etc.1,106 Meanwhile, these properties depend on the synergetic effects of the sizes (i.e. quantum confinement), surface chemistry and edge defects, resulting from the different reaction conditions, such as the solvents, filling factors, synthesis temperature, duration time and functional modifiers, as well as ambient pH changes.1,20,38,56
Generally, the MQDs have remarkable light absorptivity, ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) light, due to their adjustable energy band structure by changing their composition and terminated functional groups.20,38,107,108 They can convert the absorbed light energy into other energy forms, such as chemical energy, thermal energy, etc., for diversified applications. For example, the Ti3C2 QDs could enhance both the efficiency and range of light visible adsorption, thus increasing the photocatalysis activity of the Ti3C2 QDs/Cu2O nanowire composite (Fig. 8A).38 Moreover, diverse MQDs (Ti3C2 QDs, Mo2C QDs, and V2C QDs20,46,66,69) exhibit strong absorption in the NIR region and can convert the light energy into heat for photothermal therapy or photothermal assays (Fig. 8B and C).

Compared with the low PL of 2D MXenes, the MQDs achieve strong PL emission. Although the PL mechanism is still controversial, there are two main opinions that are universally accepted, namely size effects and surface defects.37,106,109,110 Three main parameters, including PL colour, PL quantum yields (PLQYs) and PL lifetimes (PLLTs), are often investigated for reflecting the PL behaviors of MQDs.1 Currently, some studies have reported the PL spectra of MQDs under different excitation wavelengths, showing the excitation-dependent fluorescence emission features in most cases.1,41,72 Generally, MQD suspensions are colourless or light yellow or brown, or even black, under daylight due to different reaction synthesis and composition etc. (Fig. 3I).41 However, they emit bright blue or green or red or white or even multicolours under different excitation wavelengths from 355–505 nm, and 365 nm is the most frequently used wavelength (Fig. 8D).72 Furthermore, the PL behaviors of MQDs could be tuned by various factors, including synthesis conditions (temperature, solvents or pH etc.), MQD size, doping elements and so on.37,41,49,51,56,57 For example, Xu et al.41 obtained Ti3C2 QDs using different solvents, including DMSO (s-MQDs), ethanol (e-MQDs), and DMF (f-MQDs). Under the 365 nm UV illumination, the obtained QDs system exhibited different PL colors, and these were white (DMSO) and blue (DMF and ethanol), respectively (Fig. 8E). Meanwhile, the PLQYs were measured to be 4.1%, 10.7%, and 6.9%, and the average PLLTs were 4.7 ns, 2.5 ns, and 2.1 ns, for s-MQDs, f-MQDs and e-MQDs, respectively. Xue et al.37 reported the PLQYs of the Ti3C2 QDs to be 9.9, 8.7, and 7.9% under the synthesis temperature of 100 °C, 120 °C, and 150 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, the blue PL became heavier with the increase of synthesis temperature under 365 nm light irradiation. Chen et al.49 found that the PL intensity and lifetime of Ti3C2 QDs decreased by increasing the pH value (5–9), which was due to the deprotonation of the surface imperfections in MQDs, and that some luminescent surface imperfections are transformed into non-luminescent surface imperfection locations, thus acting as non-radiative passages for capturing carriers, resulting in the reduction of the emission intensity of MQDs (Fig. 9A and B). Furthermore, heteroatom doping also significantly changed the PL behavior.3,57 For example, the doped Ti3C2 QDs showed different fluorescence under 365 nm UV irradiation by doping different elements, and they corresponded to blue, yellow and orange fluorescence for S-MQDs (7.74 ns, 28.12%), N-MQDs (5.81 ns, 8.33%) and SN-MQDs (4.67 ns, 7.78%) (Fig. 9C–E), respectively.3 The change in their PL behaviors can be attributed to the fact that the different synthesis conditions will produce MQDs with different sizes, morphologies, defect degrees, and surface/edge states.37,109,110

In addition to PL properties, ECL is also considered to be an important optical property that can be used to evaluate the capabilities of MQDs and expand their applications. ECL is a method of converting electrical energy into an easily detectable fluorescence signal. By combining the advantages of electrochemistry and chemiluminescence, ECL can be considered as a more effective analytical tool by significantly eliminating background interference. The merits of ECL, such as high sensitivity, a broad detection range and easy extension endow it with promising applications in biosensing, cell-imaging, etc.54,111 However, the ECL of the MQDs has had limited studying until now. Qin et al.54 first reported the ECL properties of MQDs (Ti3C2 QDs) in detail via an annihilation operation and a co-reactant enhancement process. The results showed that the MQDs could entice a strong ECL signal on the time scale from 0 to 1050 s (Fig. 9F and G). The probable ECL generation pathway could be as follows: first, both negatively charged MQDs (MQDs˙−) and positively charged MQDs (MQDs˙+) are formed by reducing or oxidizing MQDs (eqn (1) and (2)). Then, the excited state of MQDs (MQDs*) was produced after the diffusing and colliding of MQDs˙− and MQDs˙+ (eqn (3)). Finally, unstable MQDs* were readily converted into the ground state of MQDs by emitting photons, thus generating an ECL signal (Fig. 9H) (eqn (4)). MQDs + e− → MQDs˙−(1) MQDs → MQDs˙+ + e−(2) MQDs˙− + MQDs˙+ → MQDs* + MQDs(3) MQDs* → MQDs + hv(4)
In addition, the co-reactant enhancement processes of Ti3C2 QDs were studied by employing some kind of common cathode or anode co-reactants: TPrA, Na2C2O4, H2O2, and K2S2O8, and the results indicated that TPrA exhibited a better promoting effect (∼29-fold) in the anode ECL process (Fig. 9I). Furthermore, the stability experiments have shown that MQDs are a robust ECL luminophore, and this verified that the MQDs have potential in ECL sensing. Afterwards, Xu et al.41 also reported the ECL performance of Ti3C2Tx QDs in the existence of a co-reactant (K2S2O8, L- cysteine, citric acid, H2O2, or glutathione), and the results indicated that the ECL activity clearly improved by employing K2S2O8 as a co-reactant.
Apart from the commonly studied PL and electrochemiluminescence properties of MQDs, their up-conversion PL optical properties and transparent optical properties should also be given more attention.1,112 Up-conversion PL is a phenomenon whereby the PL emission wavelength is shorter than the used excitation wavelength, in other words the photon energy of emission is higher than that of excitation. Therefore, when using MQDs in photoelectric materials, they will show increased efficiency in the use of light energy.113,114 The transparent optical properties of the materials, combined with their electrical conductivity have attracted considerable attention for their potential application in transparent conducting films, which could be applied in various futuristic photoelectric devices, including touch panels, photovoltaics, smart windows, liquid crystal displays, transparent sensors, transparent heaters, supercapacitors, and so on. To date, 2D MXene materials have been widely studied in transparent conducting films,112,115–118 however there have been no related studies of MQDs. The excellent optical properties of MQDs enable them to have broad application prospects in many fields. Nevertheless, up to now, most research has only concentrated on the PL properties, and more attention and effort should be paid to other optical properties, as this is of great significance to their development and application.
3.4. Magnetic properties
Magnetic properties are important physical properties that can be used in a variety of biomedical fields. The MAX phases, in which the “M” is Cr and/or Mn, almost all performed magnetism, e.g. Cr2AlC, Cr2GeC, Cr2GaC, Cr2AlN, C2GaN, MN2AlC, MN2GaC, Cr2TiAlC2, and (Cr2/3Sc1/3)2AlC.42 However, so far, the magnetic properties of MXenes have rarely been demonstrated by experimental research, only the DFT calculations have forecast that several bare and terminated MXenes exhibit magnetism. According to the theoretical studies, the non-spin polarized DOS at the EF performed high value should signify magnetic instability, and the M2X and M3X2 families are deemed magnetic. In view of the magnetism of “M” atoms, they could be divided into ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM, A-type, C-type and G-type) according to the TM spin in single unit structures of MXenes, as shown in Fig. 10A.99 Compared to un-terminated MXenes, the magnetic performance of MXenes relies on the composition of M and X, and on the terminations. In a recent study, five different nitride MXenes (Mn2NF2, Mn2NO2, Mn2N(OH)2, Ti2NO2, and Cr2NO2), as well as Mn2C and F/OH-terminated Mn2C, have been predicted to exhibit a FM ground-state, however O-terminated Mn2C and most of the surface-terminated MXenes showed an AFM ground-state. The different magnetic ground states for carbide and nitride MXenes results from the additional electron supplement by nitrogen. Furthermore, their crystal tension has also marked influence on the magnetic properties, and element-doping and vacancy-introducing are two frequently used methods for regulating their magnetic properties.43 Recently, Cao et al.20 revealed the good magnetic resonance capability of the V2C QDs-based nanomaterial and this could be applied for multi-model imaging in clinical applications. Although there is little research on magnetic properties of MQDs, these theoretical studies will provide guidance for investigating the MQDs.

3.5. Functionalizations
Due to some inevitable disadvantages of MQDs, such as aggregation, oxidation, functionalization is often performed in order to improve their practical applications, and the common functionalization methods include surface modification, heteroatom doping and constructing composites.27,38,56,58 It is clear from the above discussion that the outer surfaces of MQDs are currently passivated with –O, –F or –OH functional groups caused in the synthesis process, and this is the most direct surface modification method and thus significantly impacts the properties and stability of MQDs.119 Apart from these functional groups, other special functional groups, like the –NH group, were also frequently introduced to modify the surface of MQDs by adding ammonia in the synthesis process.37,51,72 Furthermore, modifying the surface of MQDs by an organic compound can be another effective method. For instance, Zeng et al.38,49 reported Ti3C2 QDs grafted with positively charged polyethylenimine (Fig. 10B). Cao et al.20 synthesized TAT peptide and poly(ethylene glycol) modified V2C QDs. The surface modification will significantly augment the performance of MQDs, such as the dispersibility, biocompatibility, targeting capacity, stability, and so on.27,120–122 In addition to surface modification, heteroatom doping can be another effective method to tune the properties of MQDs. It is well known that heteroatom doping is an efficient and simple method to endow or improve the electromagnetic, physicochemical, optical, and structural properties of materials.123,124 To date, there have been several studies on the use of non-metallic element (N, P, and S) doped/co-doped Ti3C2 QDs. The results indicated that heteroatom doping will distinctly optimize the properties of MQDs (Ti3C2 QDs) and, compared to single element doping, co-doping might enable better results. For example, Xu et al.56 reported N-Ti3C2 QDs, and the results indicated that the N element doping clearly increased the light absorption. Moreover, the element doping will significantly improve the electronic properties of Ti3C2 QDs, resulting in the Eg widening (Fig. 7D). Based on the mechanism of the carrier life (Fig. 10C), it can be seen that N-Ti3C2 QDs are beneficial to reducing the charge and energy loss, thus accelerating electron transfer, increasing the lifetime of the carrier and improving PLQYs (18.7%). Furthermore, the N-MQDs possess lower WF, suggesting that the electron transfer is easier (Fig. 10D). Guan et al.57 reported N-doped, P-doped and N, P-co-doped Ti3C2 QDs. The DFT calculations indicated that the heteroatom doping could cause charge transfer, thus improving the optical properties of Ti3C2 QDs (Fig. 10F). The improved optical and electronic properties of MQDs will enable them to be applied effectively in biomedical and optoelectronic fields. In addition, combining MQDs with other materials to form a composite is also a common method for improving their performance and expanding their application. Up to now, there have been multitudinous kinds of materials, such as carbons, semiconductors, biomaterials, and inorganic nonmetallic materials that have been successfully hybridized with MQDs to design hybrid nanocomposites via hydrothermal, ball-milling and other methods, such as Ti3C2 QDs/TiO2, Ti3C2 QDs/Cu2O nanowires, Ti3C2 QDs/liposomes, Ti3C2 QDs/Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, Mo2C QDs/carbon, Ti3C2 QDs/P (or C, or S, or Si) etc.20,38,39,48,65,66,70,71 The incorporation of MQDs into other materials can not only improve their dispersion, stability and recycling etc., but it can also optimize the performance of the combined material, and these composites exhibit great promise in sensing, biomedical, catalysis and energy storage fields etc. (more detailed discussion can be found in Section 4). Although there is still limited research on MQDs, the functionalization of MQDs is key to implementing their practical application, and so more effective functionalization methods also need to be further studied.
4. Applications of MQDs
4.1. Sensing

4.1.1. Metal ion detection. 
Over the past few decades, a large number of metal ions, such as Fe3+, Cr2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, etc., have been released into water with the development of industries, and this will destroy the water ecosystem and threaten the safety of humans.73,125–130 Thus, the development of an effective metal ion detecting technique is the prerequisite for the prevention and control of heavy metal pollution.131–135 Recently, the fluorescence-based QD biological sensing for metal ion detection has aroused great interest due to its high sensitivity, low detection limit, good selectivity, wide detection range, fast response, good anti-jamming ability and ease of operation, etc.136–140 To date, there have also been some studies on metal ion (especially for Fe3+) detection using MQDs, based on the PL quenching mechanism.41,55–57,63,68,73 For instance, Xu et al.56 reported that the N-doped Ti3C2Tx QDs performed with fine sensitivity and selectivity for Fe3+ detection, and the results showed that the detectable concentration was in the range of 2–5000 μM, the limit of detection (LOD) was 2.0 μM, and the detection time was only 0.5 min. Meanwhile, the good selectivity of N-MQDs was studied in the presence of other different metal ions (Na+, Mg2+, Cu2+, K+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Al3+, Ce3+, Cu+ and Ni2+) (Fig. 11A and B). Except for Fe3+, the Ti3C2 QDs also showed the efficient detection of Zn2+,37 Cu2+,57 Ag+ and Mn2+.63 The most acceptable PL quenching mechanism was the mechanism involving the oxygenous groups, e.g. hydroxyl, carboxyl and carbonyl, on the surface and edge of the MQDs, where the metal ion acts as a coordinating center to bridge well-dispersed MQD individuals together via high-affinity interactions between the metal ion and the oxygenous functional groups. Subsequently, this affinity interaction results in aggregation-induced PL quenching of the MQDs.141,142

4.1.2. Protein detection. 
Compared to metal ion detection, the direct detection of biological substances, such as an enzyme, an antigen etc., by an MQDs probe should be more efficient for biological sensing applications.52,53,143–145 To date, there are several studies on Ti3C2 QDs for detecting biological substances. For instance, Guo et al.51 used Ti3C2 QDs for an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay according to the inner filter effect (IFE). The results indicated that the fluorescence intensity of Ti3C2 QDs decreased by a few degrees with an increase in ALP concentration from 0 to 50 U L−1, and a good linearity between the quenching efficiency and ALP concentration, ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 U L−1, was obtained, and the LOD was 0.02 U L−1. The detection mechanism is due to the significant overlap between the absorption spectrum of p-nitrophenol and the excitation and emission spectra of Ti3C2 QDs (p-nitrophenol is produced from the ALP-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the substrate), thus effectively quenching the fluorescence of Ti3C2 QDs by IFE (Fig. 11C–E). Chen et al.65 also reported the Ti3C2 QD-based heterojunction (Ti3C2 QDs/TiO2) electrode for superior photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing of glutathione. The electrode showed high stability, sensitivity, and selectivity for the detection of glutathione in both buffered solution (0.1–1000 μM, LOD was 0.9 nM) and cell extracts (1–200 μM, LOD was 0.55 μM) (Fig. 11F). Furthermore, Cai et al.66 designed an NIR photothermal immunoassay for high sensitivity and selectivity of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detection using Ti3C2 QD-encapsulated liposomes. The results showed that the Ti3C2 QDs converted the light energy into heat under NIR-laser irradiation, and a shift in temperature, corresponding with the analyte concentration, was acquired on a handheld thermometer. Under optimal conditions, the Ti3C2 QD-based photothermal immunoassay exhibited a dynamic linear range from 1.0–50 ng mL−1 for PSA detection, and the LOD reached 0.4 ng mL−1 (Fig. 11G–I). The above studies indicated that the prepared MQDs could be perfect bioprobes for the efficient detection of cell biological characteristics, and can be used for cell health monitoring and biosensors.


4.1.3. Detection of other molecules. 
In addition, the MQDs have been studied for the detection of other substances. For instance, Xu et al.56 has prepared nitrogen-doped Ti3C2 QDs (N-MQDs), and the possibility of detecting H2O2 with the aid of Fe2+ was investigated. The results indicated that no observable fluorescence intensity change was noted in the presence of 50 mM H2O2 solution, suggesting that the PL of N-MQDs could not be quenched by H2O2 alone. However, when H2O2 and Fe2+ simultaneously exist, the PL intensity of N-MQDs is reduced significantly (reaching 69.78%), indicating that the N-MQDs could be used as a probe for H2O2 detection. Chen et al.49 developed an intracellular pH sensor based on polyethylenimine functionalized Ti3C2 QDs. The synthetic Ti3C2 QDs exhibited favorable pH dependent luminescence behavior, thus integrating the highly pH sensitive Ti3C2 QDs with the pH insensitive [Ru(dpp)3]Cl2, resulting in a pH sensor to quantitatively detect the intracellular pH values being developed. Liu et al.59 has reported glutathione functionalized Ti3C2 QDs (GSH-Ti3C2) for the detection of uric acid, based on the oxidation of uric acid by uricase to allantoin and hydrogen peroxide, and then o-phenylenediamine (OPD) was oxidized to the yellow-colored 2,3-diaminophenazine (oxOPD) in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 11J). The results indicated that the fluorescence emission of GSH-Ti3C2 QDs centered at 430 nm overlaps with the UV absorption of oxOPD at 425 nm to a large extent, and this facilitates fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between GSH-Ti3C2 QDs and oxOPD. With the increase in uric acid concentration, the emission at 430 nm of the GSH-Ti3C2 QDs is progressively quenched and the emission at 568 nm of oxOPD gradually increased.

4.2. Biomedical

4.2.1. Bioimaging. 
Bioimaging is an effective study technique in the field of modern biology and medicine that can provide clear and intuitive biological information for researchers by a quick and easy method.136,146,147 To date, many semiconductor QDs have been studied in this field, however they usually contain toxic heavy metals that limit their practical application.148 Compared to semiconductor QDs, the non-toxic or low-toxic nature of MQDs generally result in better biocompatibility in bioimaging, and it is therefore expected to be a remarkable bioimaging material.149 To date, several studies have demonstrated the excellent bioimaging capability of MQDs based on their PL properties.37,46,47,49,57,69,73
For instance, Xue et al.37 first reported the PL Ti3C2 MXene QDs for multicolor cellular imaging. The as-prepared Ti3C2 QDs exhibited excitation-dependent PL spectra with PLQYs of about 10%, due to effective quantum confinement. The cytotoxicity experiments showed that the Ti3C2 QDs possess low cytotoxicity for RAW264.7 cells, and they were readily ingested via endocytosis. The confocal images showed bright blue, green, and red colors at the excitation of 405, 488 and 543 nm, respectively. Furthermore, according to the confocal luminescence images, it can be observed that the QDs primarily exist in the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, and very weak luminescence points were shown in the nucleus region (Fig. 12A), suggesting that the QDs can readily diffuse into the cell without entering the nucleus and resulting in genetic damage. Cao et al.20 employed a V2C QD-based nanocomposite to acquire bioimaging of MCF-7 and NHDF cells. The results showed that the nanocomposite enabled entering into both MCF-7 and NHDF cells by the endocytic uptake pathway (Fig. 12B and C). These studies showed that MQDs exhibit great application prospects in biological and medical fields in a safe and efficient way.

4.2.2. Photothermal therapy. 
In recent years, the photothermal therapy (PTT) employing NIR illumination for tumor hyperthermia ablation has been widely studied and has received great enthusiasm. As the local heat can be well controlled in temporal and spatial lobes, PTT exhibits fewer side effects than traditional tumor therapeutic methods.20 Recently, diverse 2D materials, including MXenes, have been frequently explored as photothermal agents (PTAs) for in vitro and in vivo PTT applications. However, the low photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) and the large size in dimension of 2D materials still limit their practical use in PTT.150–152 Hence, there is a huge demand for developing ultra-small PTAs with high PTCE and without toxicity concerns, in order to acquire a high-efficiency photothermal tumor treatment.46 Attractively, the emerging MQDs could be satisfactory PTAs, due to their excellent NIR adsorption and biocompatibility properties.20,46,69 For example, Cao et al.20 developed V2C QD-based (V2C QDs-TAT peptides/exosomes) PTAs for eliminating tumors by PTT. The ultra-small V2C QDs exhibited a strong photothermal effect in the NIR-II region, and the PTCE was up to 45.05%. The V2C QD-based PTAs had favorable biocompatibility and circulation ability, and they could easily target the cancer cells and penetrate into the nucleus. Under the illumination of the NIR-II region, the PTA-mediated nucleus temperature increased, causing genetic material to be destroyed and protein denaturation, thus resulting in the death of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 12D and E). Furthermore, the Ti3C2 QDs46 and Mo2C QDs69 also exhibited the high-efficiency PTT effect on tumors both in vitro and in vivo under NIR illumination. These studies suggest that the MQDs will initiate a new era in the PTT of tumors.


4.2.3. Immunomodulation. 
Combining the fields of biomaterials, regenerative medicine and immunology will help to develop new therapies for treating inflammatory and degenerative diseases. The next-generation of intelligent biomaterials are playing an increasingly important part in advancing treatment options for different diseases.40,145,147,153 Recently, the development of MQDs with distinguished structural and biomedical properties endows them with great application potential in this field due to their excellent structural and biomedical properties. Rafieerad et al.40 first reported that the Ti3C2 QDs could be used for immunomodulation with improving material-based tissue repair after injury. In particular, the Ti3C2 QDs have intrinsic immunomodulation characteristics and can selectively decrease the activation of human CD4+IFN-γ+ T-lymphocytes (control: 87.1 ± 2.0%, Ti3C2 QDs: 68.3 ± 5.4%), while facilitating the expansion of immunosuppressive CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (control: 5.5 ± 0.7%, Ti3C2 QDs: 8.5 ± 0.8%) in a stimulated lymphocyte population (Fig. 12F and G). Meanwhile, Ti3C2 QDs are biocompatible with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived fibroblasts (Fig. 12H). Furthermore, Ti3C2 QDs were integrated into a chitosan-based hydrogel to construct a 3D platform with improved physico-chemical properties for stem cell delivery and tissue repair. This composite hydrogel demonstrated increased conductivity whilst maintaining injectability and thermosensitivity. Although the related studies are still limited, these exciting results should promote further research on the use of MQDs in clinically translatable applications.

4.3. Catalysis
Recently, great advances have been made in the development of QD materials, including graphene QDs, carbon QDs, g-C3N4 QDs, BP QDs and TMDs QDs etc., as high-efficiency catalysts/co-catalysts in catalysis systems.154–156 Due to the emergence of MQDs, they are considered to be promising catalysts/co-catalysts, and the main reasons may be that: (a) they possess the native properties of their 2D MXene counterparts, including the functionalization by surface groups (–OH, –O and –F), the wonderful electroconductibility, the adjustable band structure, and so on; (b) they possess low toxicity, unique photochemical robustness, tunable optical properties and excellent catalytic abilities.14,38,58,70

4.3.1. Electrocatalysis. 
Electrocatalysis is an efficient advanced oxidation process (AOP), which was unremittingly studied in energy and environmental applications, e.g. in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), in nitrogen fixation, and so on.58,70,157,158 Recent progresses in DFT calculations have verified that the MXene materials have a large DOS around EF, and this endows them with promising electrocatalytic activity. Although many studies have been concentrated on the application of 2D MXenes in electrocatalysis up to now, recently research on MQDs in electrocatalysis has just begun to emerge.
The electrocatalytic ORR and MOR are essential to renewable-energy technology,157 so the excellent properties of MQDs would enable them to play an important role in the electrocatalytic system. Yang et al.58 reported a unique composite of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) embellished by MoS2 QDs and Ti3C2Tx QDs (MoS2 QDs@Ti3C2Tx QDs@MWCNTs), and employed them for ORR and MOR in alkaline solution by electrocatalysis. The results showed that the excellent electrochemical performance and size dependent quantum confinement of the Ti3C2Tx QDs could effectively accelerate electron transfer and provide more active sites, thus endowing the MoS2 QDs@Ti3C2Tx QDs@MWCNTs composite with outstanding electrocatalytic performance and stability for ORR and MOR. Furthermore, nitrogen fixation by electrocatalysis is also deemed as a promising method to acquire high NH3 production, which plays an important role in human development and industrial progress. However, due to the chemical inertness of nitrogen, it is necessary to explore high-efficiency catalysts for promoting the reduction of nitrogen.70,159,160 Cheng et al.70 found that Mo2C QDs anchored on ultrathin carbon nanosheets (Mo2C/C) could act as an efficient electrocatalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The prepared Mo2C/C composite exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity for NRR with the NH3 yield rate up to 11.3 μg h−1 mg−1, and the faradaic efficiency was 7.8% under ambient conditions (Fig. 13A and B). According to the experiments and DFT calculations, the remarkable NRR electrocatalytic performance of the Mo2C/C composite should primarily be due to the abundant nitrogen adsorption sites of Mo2C QDs and their particular electronic structure, which contributes to the cleavage and hydrogenation of NN bond (Fig. 7C, 13C and D). These studies indicate that MQDs have good prospects in the field of electrocatalysis, but more efforts are still needed for further research.

4.3.2. Photocatalysis. 
Photocatalysis, another efficient AOP, has been widely researched and has promising potential in handling the global energy and environmental issues.5,161–166 MQDs could be excited via a broad spectrum ranging from the visible to the NIR, and exhibit attractive surface and electronic properties. Accordingly, MQDs are regarded as promising visible-light catalysts/co-catalysts in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, H2 generation, pollutant degradation, and so on. For example, Zeng et al.38 developed a hierarchical heterostructure of Ti3C2 QD-decorated Cu2O nanowires (NWs) on a Cu mesh by facile electrostatic self-assembly, for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into methanol. The results showed that the Ti3C2 QDs were uniformly anchored on the surface of Cu2O NWs with intimate contact (Fig. 13E). The methanol production experiment results indicated that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 by the Ti3C2 QDs/Cu2O NWs/Cu heterostructure was 8.25 or 2.15 times higher than that of Cu2O NWs/Cu or Ti3C2 sheets/Cu2O NWs/Cu, respectively (Fig. 13F). The significantly improved photocatalytic performance is due to the introduction of Ti3C2 QDs, which can enhance charge transfer, carrier density, light adsorption, and the stability of Cu2O NWs by reducing band bending and photo induced electron–hole pair recombination, and this can be proved by experimental and DFT calculations (Fig. 7B). Li et al.50 reported that the Ti3C2 QDs were successfully combined with g-C3N4 nanosheets as efficient co-catalysts for photocatalytic H2 generation. The optimized g-C3N4@Ti3C2 QDs composite (5.5 wt%) could markedly enhance the photocatalytic H2 production rate (5111.8 μmol g−1 h−1), approximately 26, 3, and 10 times higher than the pure g-C3N4 nanosheets (196.8 μmol g−1 h−1), Pt/g-C3N4 (1896.4 μmol g−1 h−1), and Ti3C2 nanosheets/g-C3N4 (524.3 μmol g−1 h−1), respectively (Fig. 13G). The highly efficient photocatalytic performance of the g-C3N4@Ti3C2 QDs composite can mainly be attributed to the tiny particle size of the Ti3C2 QDs co-catalysts, which can increase the specific surface area and provide more active sites. In addition, an intimate contact between metallic Ti3C2 QDs and g-C3N4 nanosheets was conducive to transferring photogenerated electrons from g-C3N4 to the conductive Ti3C2 QDs. Therefore, the electrons could rapidly participate in the photocatalytic H2 evolution process (Fig. 13H). These works provide a promising era for the potential application of MQDs in photocatalysis.


4.3.3. Photoelectrocatalysis. 
Photoelectrocatalysis is a powerful method derived from the combination of heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrochemical techniques. Up to now, there have been some studies regarding the application of 2D MXenes in photoelectrocatalysis for water splitting.60,167,168 Therefore, considering the specific character of MQDs, they should also have great application potential in photoelectrocatalysis. In 2020, Tang et al.60 first reported the study of Ti3C2 QDs in photoelectrocatalysis for water oxidation. In this study, a brand-new Janus-structured cobalt-nanoparticle-coupled Ti3C2 QD (Co-MQDs) Schottky catalyst was synthesized through a facile thermal-anchoring-hydrothermal method. Coupled with Co terminals, pristine Ti3C2 QDs display significantly enhanced water oxidation performance. Remarkably, by virtue of carefully tailoring the heterostructures and Co loading content, the modest Janus-structured Co-MQDs-48 exhibits both superior water oxidation performance (2.99 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and charge migration efficiency (87.56%). After cycling for 10 h, a photocurrent density of 2.79 mA cm−2 could be obtained, confirming the good photostability of Co-MQDs. This outstanding water oxidation performance achieved by Janus-structured Co-MQDs can be attributed to three simultaneous enhancement effects. Firstly, the light harvesting efficiency of pristine Ti3C2 QDs can be efficiently improved by Co loading, due to the concomitant surface plasmon effect. Secondly, the carrier separation efficiency of Co-MQDs can be fundamentally enhanced by the Janus-structure introduced Schottky-junction. Thirdly, due to the introduction of the Co terminal, the surface water oxidation performance of pristine Ti3C2 QDs was greatly improved (Fig. 13I). This research provides a new dimension for the application of MQDs in catalysis.

4.4. Energy storage

4.4.1. Batteries. 
With the progress of science and technology, tremendous attention has been paid to research for developing new-generation electrochemical energy storage technology (such as batteries, supercapacitors and solar cells) and for satisfying the growing requirements of both electronic products and power transmission systems, and the MXene materials have been widely studied in these fields.33–35,169,170
Batteries represent the most extensively studied electrochemical energy storage equipment owing to their environmental friendliness and high energy density.14,170,171 In recent years, MXene materials, with superior theoretical Li storage capacity (e.g. 447.8 mA h g−1 for Ti3C2 and 879 mA h g−1 for Mn2C), favorable electronic conductivity, low operating voltage range, low diffusion barriers for Li mobility (e.g. 0.018 eV for Sc2C), and exceptional mechanical properties, have shown great promise for battery application.12,45,96,170 So far, a great deal of research on MXene-based batteries has been reported, in which most of these are 2D MXenes and a few are MQDs. For instance, Xiao et al.39 prepared the Ti3C2Tx QDs-decorated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets/S (TCD-TCS/S) nanoarchitecture as an electrode for Li–S batteries. The experiment results showed that the TCD-TCS/S electrode exhibited a high discharge capacity (1609 mA h g−1) at a medium sulfur loading of 1.8 mg cm−2. Meanwhile, ultrahigh volumetric capacity (1957 mA h cm−3) and high areal capacity (13.7 mA h cm−2) were synchronously achieved at a high sulfur loading of 13.8 mg cm−2. The electrochemical performance was greatly superior to that of traditional carbon-based cathode materials. The mechanistic study of sulfur evolution during the discharge process highlighted the importance of the integration of Ti3C2Tx QDs in the Li–S batteries. The uniform interspersion of a high density of ultrafine Ti3C2Tx QDs on the surface of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets greatly decreased their interfacial resistance and promoted the redox kinetics of sulfur species, enabling high sulfur utilization even at high current densities and high sulfur loading, thus improving the performance of the batteries significantly (Fig. 14A–C). Zhang et al.48 employed a simple ball-milling method to prepare a Ti3C2Tx QDs/red P composite, and developed it as the anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The results indicated that the composite performed at a high sodiation specific capacity of about 600 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and that it had good cycle stability for 150 cycles. The good performance of this P-based anode can be attributed to the P surface decorated with small Ti3C2Tx QDs bound by a strong Ti–O–P interaction, which could improve the robustness of the storage host and its electrical connectivity within the electrode during charge and discharge processes (Fig. 4C, 14D and E). Although there is limited research on MQDs in batteries, these studies indicate that the MQDs could be used as promising electrode material in batteries.

4.4.2. Supercapacitors. 
As well as batteries, a supercapacitor is another vital energy storage device, and is promising to apply in portable electronics and electric vehicles due to the advantages of high power density, rapid charging-discharging ability, and long cycle life.172,173 In 2013, Yuri Gogotsi et al.174 first demonstrated that 2D Ti3C2Tx could act as flexible and high-performance electrodes in pseudocapacitance. Up to now, 2D MXenes have been widely used in the research of supercapacitors due to their layered 2D structure, good electrical conductivity, hydrophilic surface, flexibility, and highly defined morphology, and this promises to provide rapid electron transfer channels and a large electrochemically active surface for a fast and reversible faradaic reaction, thus giving them ultra-high volumetric capacitance.45,169,173,175,176 Although there are limited studies of MQDs in supercapacitors, their great application potential in supercapacitors has also been noticed.64 Recently, Zhou et al.64 reported that Ti3C2Tx QDs could be used as interlayer spacers in the positive electrode (Ti3C2Tx nanosheets/Ti3C2Tx QDs/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) fiber (M6M3RG1)) of a Ti3C2Tx MXene-based all-solid-state asymmetric fiber supercapacitor. In comparison with other interlayer spacers, Ti3C2Tx QDs may be selected as good interlayer spacers for the preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene-based fibers, because they not only have a well-defined structure, a conspicuous quantum confinement effect, plentiful edge sites, and abundant functional groups, but they also have the same intrinsic property as Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. Therefore, the interactions between the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and Ti3C2Tx quantum dots will be kept to a minimum. The experimental results indicated that the network-structured M6M3RG1 fiber electrode possessed an ideal capacitance behavior and a fast charge–discharge performance due to the interlayer spacer function of the Ti3C2Tx QDs, and the maximum volumetric capacitance and capacity retention were 542 F cm−3 and 56%, respectively. Meanwhile, the capacitance and flexibility are clearly affected by the amount of Ti3C2Tx QDs (Fig. 14F–H). This study showed that MQDs could be promising candidates for preparing high-performance supercapacitor materials.

4.5. Optoelectronic devices
Optoelectronics are the key and core components of optoelectronic technology, and with the development of the technology, multifarious optoelectronics are created, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and optical switches etc.177–179 Recent studies have shown that many 2D material derived QDs, such as GQDs, MoS2 QDs, SiC QDs and MQDs, are outstanding electron acceptors and donors in their photoexcited states, and this makes them promising materials for application in optoelectronics.12,61,180 So far, several studies have proved that MQDs could be the ideal materials for white LEDs, white lasers and for nonvolatile memory devices.3,47,61,62,72 For example, Xu et al.3 developed novel full-color Ti3C2 QDs. The prepared Ti3C2 QDs showed multi-colors of blue, yellow and orange fluorescence at an excitation of 360 nm. Meanwhile, the acquired Ti3C2 QDs have similar PL emission in the solid state, but the emission experiences red-shifting and PL improvement in aqueous solution, which could be due to the formation of robust bridge-like hydrogen-bonded networks between the Ti3C2 QDs and water. The decrease in the band gap due to the π-electron delocalization is responsible for the red-shift of the emissive spectra. Furthermore, the Ti3C2 QDs are mixed homogeneously with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain a white LED, and the LED showed a uniform and stable white light, where the CIE coordinates of (0.31, 0.35) are located near the center of the picture (Fig. 15A and B). Therefore, the full-color Ti3C2 QDs are ideal for white LEDs. Huang et al.72 designed a white laser using V2C MXene QDs. By passivation, the PL of the V2C QDs was significantly improved, covering the whole visible region. Under the optimized excitation, the blue, green, yellow, and red lights are amplified and simultaneously lased. Mao et al.61 synthesized an indium tin oxide/Ti3C2Tx QDs-PVP/Au (ITO/MQDs-PVP/Au) sandwich structure composite. The results indicated that the electrical conductance of ITO/MQDs-PVP/Au can be tuned precisely from insulator behavior to irreversible resistive switching, reversible resistive switching, and conductor behavior with the increase of Ti3C2Tx QDs content. The irreversible and reversible resistive switching behaviors are capable of exhibiting nonvolatile write-once-read-many times and flash memory effects, respectively. Both of the memory devices operate stably under a long retention test (1.2 × 104 s), with a high on/off current ratio of up to 100.

4.6. Other applications
In addition to the above applications, MQDs also exhibited promising application prospects in other fields due to their excellent properties. Zhou et al.47 reported that Ti3C2Tx MXene-derived graphene QDs can be utilized as a fluorescent ink due to their good dispersibility and available PL in various solvents. The experiments indicated that the QDs can be mixed with glycol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and the mixture was colorless under daylight but presented a bright blue color under 365 nm UV illumination, thus it could be immediately applied as fluorescent ink. Meanwhile, the mixture was added into a commercial inkjet printer, and a bright fluorescent “Monkey” picture could be readily printed (Fig. 15C). Xu et al.41 reported that the Ti3C2Tx QDs could be used for fluorescent staining of silk fibers. It could be observed that the bright red and green fluorescence could be emitted under different wavelengths after the silk fiber was soaked with Ti3C2Tx QDs solution (Fig. 15D). Wang et al.71 found that the Mo2C QDs could markedly improve the microwave absorption (MA) performance of the Mo2C/C composite. The improved MA performance can be attributed to the possibility that Mo2C QDs have an apparent influence on the dielectric loss of the composite, in which conductivity loss and dipole orientation polarization are reasonably decreased, and interfacial polarization is dramatically created, thus improving the impedance matching of the Mo2C/C composite. The optimal composite had excellent MA performance ranging from 2.0 to 18.0 GHz, including forceful reflection loss (−60.4 dB) and wide qualified bandwidth (14.5 GHz) (Fig. 15E). Although the study on MQDs has been very limited so far, we can predict that they will create enormous attention and be widely studied due to their distinguished optical-electrical and physico-chemical properties.
5. Conclusions and prospects
As an advanced branch of QD materials, MQDs are attracting increasing attention because of their outstanding physico-chemical and optical–electrical properties. The booming progress in exfoliation techniques has promoted the preparation of MQDs with a variety of unique properties, such as excellent PL properties, low toxicity, good biocompatibility and high selectivity to target analytes, and this has created the foundations for the more widespread applications of the MQDs in sensing, bioimaging, cancer therapy, optoelectronics, catalysis and batteries, etc. Despite these great achievements, there are still many fundamental and technical gaps and challenges for this attractive but nascent area.
5.1. Improving synthesis strategies of MQDs
Many studies have shown that there are many ways to synthesize QDs. In the synthesis of MQDs, the top-down method is the most common one, generally, and the 2D MXene precursors were mostly developed by etching the MAX phases in a high concentration acidic solution (such as HF or LiF + HCl), which is extremely hazardous and detrimental to human health, therefore, it is urgent to explore fluoride-free and environmentally friendly etchants as a sought-after alternative for conventional HF to synthesize the MQDs. Meanwhile, there is little research of bottom-up methods for MQD synthesis. However, some of their advantages, such as higher atomic utilization, better structural control, the feasibility to adjust the dimension and morphology, suggest that this is a promising approach, and should be paid more attention. Furthermore, the stability and monodispersity are particularly important for enhancing the physico-chemical properties and practical applications of MQDs, thus, better methods are needed to be explored. Referring to the synthesis of other QDs, an effective strategy is combining two or more different methods to synthesize more stable and monodisperse MQDs under appropriate conditions. In addition, it is difficult to precisely control the surface chemistry of MQDs, including the preparation of pristine MQDs. The synthesis process is the most direct and convenient process to tune the properties of MQDs for specific applications, thus it is worthwhile to devote more efforts to the synthesis of MQDs.
5.2. Further investigation of the properties of MQDs
MQDs have a variety of important properties because of their unique nanostructures and diverse compositions. Scientists have investigated the physicochemical properties of MQDs mainly by DFT calculations, especially for their electronic and magnetic properties. In experiments, many studies have demonstrated that MQDs possess excellent fluorescence behavior, photothermal conversion, photonic and photoelectronic properties. Although these properties of MQDs have been mentioned, some challenges remain. Efforts are required in the near future to focus on the elucidation of the electron structure-related mechanisms of MQDs to improve their present properties and extend these properties towards new research fields. The combination of theoretical models and practical experiments is an effective approach to explore new MQD nanostructures with new and superior properties. Many properties based on the DFT calculations need to be verified by experiments. Meanwhile, some probable significant properties of MQDs have not been explored, such as up-conversion PL, chemiluminescence and transparent optical properties etc. The forthcoming research on MQDs will be rationally driven by the development of other 2D material-derived QDs. The more thoroughly we understand the properties of the MQDs, the easier it is for us to optimize the properties of MQDs. Furthermore, more suitable functionalization measures will be selected to improve the performance of the MQDs, and this is useful for the improvement of the practical applications of MQDs.
5.3. Functionalized modification of MQDs
The excellent properties of MQDs enable them to have a variety of potential applications, including in biomedical, catalysis, electronic and photoelectronic fields. However, generally, it is difficult to put pristine MQDs into practice due to some inevitable defects. Therefore, prior to these potential applications, MQDs are usually functionalized with other substances or combined with functional materials, and this creates a flexible strategy to overcome these shortcomings and give the MQDs some advantages at the same time, thus increasing the possibility that they can be used in practice. Although some functionalization methods (surface modification, heteroatom doping and constructing composites) have been studied, the research is limited, and more effort is needed to study them further. Noticeably, in different fields, corresponding functionalization strategies should be adopted for the MQDs. For instance, in biological and medical fields, it is better to choose biocompatible materials to act as stabilizing or coating reagents to modify MQDs, such as proteins, peptides and sugars. In the field of catalysis, the MQDs should be immobilized on ideal carriers, thus improving their stability and recyclability. In the optoelectronic and electrochemical devices, the stability, service life, energy conversion efficiency of functionalized MQDs should be especially concerned. When using the modified MQDs for substance detection, it is important to note that the introduced materials during the modification process cannot affect the detection of substances. Therefore, these details should be taken into account in the functionalization processes of MQDs. Furthermore, research on the functionalization of MQDs is still limited, and is mainly focused on surface modification, heteroatom doping and constructing composites. Thus, more effective functionalization methods need to be further studied, such as the core–shell structure MQDs, the immobilized MQDs, etc. Synergistic superiority from the MQDs and introduced functional materials will dramatically improve the performance of MQDs, and they will be further developed as good candidates for functionalized nanomaterials in diverse applications by designing versatile and efficient MQD-based intelligent systems.
5.4. Cytotoxicity of MQDs in practical applications
Before practical application, the cytotoxicity of MQDs should be studied, however there are limited studies that have been done up to now. Therefore, to accurately assess the prospective hazards linked to their use and environmental exposure, it is necessary to expand the research of the cytotoxicity of MQDs in practical applications. Like many other QD materials (such as carbon QDs and semiconductor QDs), MQDs are likely to affect living organisms, including animals, plants and microbes, even at low levels, when they are released into the environment. The ultra-small MQDs will cause in vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity when in contact with living organisms. For in vivo cytotoxicity, the MQDs might induce acute toxicity or neurotoxicity at a certain concentration after the internalization of MQDs into living organisms. For in vitro cytotoxicity, the MQDs might cause the canceration or apoptosis of normal cells due to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the surface chemistry of MQDs is an important factor that can affect the potential cytotoxicity, depending on the type of “M” element, the etching and delamination methods, as well as post-functionalization treatment and storage strategies. Therefore, the complicated cytotoxicity of MQDs should be systematically studied, including in vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, the low-cytotoxicity and high-biocompatibility MQDs should be further explored, such as improving their synthesis methods, adjusting their functionalization strategies, and selecting the low-cytotoxicity “M” elements. Only when there is clear understanding of the cytotoxicity of MQDs, can they be applied in practical applications more safely.
5.5. Expanding exploration of diversiform MQDs
Based on classification, MXenes can have at least three different formulas: M2X, M3X2 and M4X3. At the same time, they can be made in three different forms: (i) mono-M elements (e.g. Ti3C2); (ii) a solid solution of at least two different M elements (e.g. (Ti, V)3C2); (iii) ordered double-M elements, in which one transition metal occupies the perimeter layers and another fills the central M layers (e.g. Mo2TiC2, in which the outer M layers are Mo and the central M layers are Ti). Furthermore, solid solutions on the X site produce carbonitride MXenes (e.g. Ti3CN) (Fig. 1C). Among these, over 20 different components of MXenes have been acquired in the experiments, and more than 70 different components of MXenes have been theoretically forecast. The abundant members provide more opportunities to develop diverse MQDs, and the different components of MQDs will endow them with different proprietary properties, allowing them to show extraordinary potential in different areas. However, most research is on Ti3C2 QDs so far, and more effort should be paid to other MQDs.
5.6. Enriching the application of MQDs
Although limited research has been done on MQDs until now, their versatile nature has made it possible to apply them in many fields, including in sensing, biomedical applications, catalysis, energy storage, optoelectronic devices etc. However, the excellent properties of MQDs signify that their application potential is far from this, and they also show great application potential in some other key technical fields. For example, in solar cell technology, which is a key technology to solving the global energy crisis. So far, a variety of materials have been used in the study of solar cells, but some shortcomings, including the high cost, the low energy efficiency, the short service life, have greatly limited the practical application of solar cells. Meanwhile, many previous studies indicated that the suitable energy band diagram and excellent electronic properties of MXenes have made them become attractive candidates for solar cell applications. Thus, it is well worth spending more efforts to explore the application of MQDs in solar cells. In addition, with the development of intelligent technology, various electronics have become an indispensable part of modern life. Meanwhile, a future trend in consumer electronics will be the shift towards optically transparent devices. To achieve this, potential primary power sources and related components need to be transparent and resilient. Thus, transparent conducting films will be the key technology to solving this problem, and could be used in the study of batteries, supercapacitors and some other devices to construct optically transparent electronics. Furthermore, with the pollution and exhaustion of fresh water resources, efficient water desalination is becoming an increasingly important means to address the scarcity of fresh water resources in the world, and the nanostructured materials can play an important role in the development of next-generation desalination systems with increased efficiency and capacity. Up to now, there have been many studies on the application of QDs and 2D MXene materials in these fields. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the application of MQDs in these fields, and more attention should be paid to study the application of MQDs in these hot research fields. Meanwhile, one thing to note is that although we have only stated the study of the applications of MQDs in these three hot research fields, some other unexplored fields are also worth studying.
Attention must be paid to the above-mentioned issues, as it is of great significance to the development of MQDs. Meanwhile, it is hoped that this review can provide a broad understanding of the range of synthesis, properties and applications of MQDs, and will prompt further developments in these emerging and exciting fields.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) Number of journal publications on typical 2D material derived QDs (“Single element QDs” represent graphene, phosphorene, silicene, germanene and carbon QDs; “TMOs QDs” represent ZnO, WO3 and MoO3 QDs; “Carb/Nitride QDs” represent SiC, g-C3N4 and h-BN QDs; “TMDCs QDs” represent MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2 QDs) (Source: Web of Science, 2015s to 2020s). (B) Number of journal publications on MXenes (Source: Web of Science, Keyword: MXenes). (C) MXenes reported so far. MXenes can have at least three different formulas: M2X, M3X2 and M4X3. They can be made in three different forms: mono-M elements (e.g. Ti2C); a solid solution of at least two different M elements (e.g. (Ti, V)3C2); ordered double-M elements, in which one transition metal occupies the perimeter layers and another fills the central M layers (e.g. Mo2TiC2, in which the outer M layers are Mo and the central M layers are Ti). Solid solutions on the X site produce carbonitrides.19 Copyright 2017 Nature Reviews Materials.
