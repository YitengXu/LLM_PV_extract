    , Accepted 10th August 2018First published on 17th August 2018AbstractTitanium oxo clusters (TOCs) anchored with photoactive triphenylamine (TPA) dyes are reported for the first time. The TiO2 electrodes modified with the TPA dye pre-anchored TOCs showed excellent photocurrent response properties.
Titanium oxo clusters (TOCs) or polyoxotitanates (POT) coordinated by organic ligands have been used as molecular TiO materials in the studies of photoelectron transfer and photocatalysis.1 They can be used as models of dye sensitized TiO2 for the theoretical study of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their accurate structural information.2 The organic dye anchored titanium alkoxyl clusters can also be considered as a new type of dye (denoted as TiO-dyes) for photosensitive electrodes. By de-alkoxylation and condensation of the alkoxyl moieties, the dye pre-anchored TiO clusters can be effectively bonded on the surface of the TiO2 electrode substrate.3 The photocurrent density of the TiO-dye sensitized solar cell can be greatly improved in comparison with that of the original organic dye due to the effective anchoring property of the TiO core. However, the ligands used in modifying the TOCs are generally simple carboxylates, organic phosphates and catechols. Real dye modified TOCs have rarely been reported before. Negre et al. reported the first TOC using a real organic dye C343 (a coumarin dye) but the TOC was only studied as a theoretical model of photoelectrochemical hole injection.2c
Although the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of DSSCs are now lower than those of the recently discovered perovskite solar cells,4 DSSCs are still one of the promising solar cells and have probable applications in window and indoor light harvesting technologies. More importantly, DSSCs have received growing attention with respect to device integration with other solar cell technologies on account of increasing performance.5 Therefore, the organic dye pre-anchored TiO clusters as a new type of dye will attract great interest. Nevertheless, there is a big step needed to step up. Until now, the organic dyes used in anchoring to TOCs, such as alizalin,3a have low photosensitivity and do not belong to the real dyes applied in DSSC studies. To approach the studies of TiO-dyes to DSSC systems, TOCs anchored with more effective organic photosensitive dyes are expected. However, the synthesis of such TOCs is still a challenge.
Triphenylamine (TPA) based dyes have been extensively applied in DSSCs and showed high PEC efficiencies.6 They also showed very good hole-transport properties and have been used in organic and perovskite solar cells.7 Therefore, in this work TPA derivatives were selected to construct TiO-dyes. Using formyl-TPA (4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde) or formyl-DEPA (4-(diethylamino)benzaldehyde) to react with malonic acid (MAL) and Ti(OiPr)4, we successfully isolated crystals of two Ti6 oxo clusters modified with TPA or DEPA derivatives by in situ solvothermal synthesis (see the Experimental section in the ESI†), [Ti6O3(L1)2(OiPr)14]·HOiPr (1) and [Ti6O3(L2)2(OiPr)14] (2) (Fig. 1). Another Ti6 oxo cluster modified with TPA derivative and BDC (o-benzene dicarboxylate) was also isolated for contrast, [Ti6O4(L1′)2(BDC)2(OiPr)10] (3). They are the first reported TOCs with bonded TPA dyes. Charge-transfer properties of the clusters and photoelectrochemical properties of the cluster sensitized TiO2 electrode are evaluated.
 Fig. 1  Synthetic reactions for compounds 1 and 2. 
The structures of L1 and L2 are shown in Fig. 1 and L1′ is denoted as the one carboxyl group esterified L1 ligand. The ligand condensation and cluster formation reactions are orientated and yellow crystals are isolated at 60 °C after about 6 days with moderate yields. The reaction of formyl-TPA with MAL doesn't take place below this temperature, but a colorless malonic Ti6 cluster Ti6O3(MAL)2(OiPr)14 (Ti6-MAL) was crystallized which was reported previously.8 Generally a formyl-TPA precursor reacts with active methylene compounds such as nitromethane, nitrile acetic acid and malonic acid via the Knoevenagel Condensation reaction under weak alkali conditions in the presence of pyridine or diethyl amine. In the reaction with malonic acid, only mono carboxyl compound can be obtained due to decarboxylation.9 We tried to synthesize the dicarboxyl derivative of TPA (H2L1) to be taken as a contrast of free ligands but failed. Only the monocarboxyl acid was obtained using general organic synthetic methods. Therefore, besides as the starting material of the TOCs, the role of Ti(OiPr)4 is important in the synthesis of dicarboxyl ligands for 1–3. As mentioned above, malonic acid reacts easily with Ti(OiPr)4 to form the Ti6 cluster Ti6-MAL, and then the cluster is condensed with formyl-TPA. Because the two carboxyl groups have been pre-bonded on the TOC core, no decarboxylation occurred. A relevant diethylamine derived compound 2 was synthesized in a similar way except that DMF solvent was used instead of isopropanol for 1. The XRD patterns of freshly isolated multicrystalline 1–3 match well with those of the corresponding ones simulated from their single-crystal X-ray data, suggesting the phase purity of these compounds (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The crystal structures of 1 and 2 are similar to each other except for the dye ligands, therefore only that of 1 is discussed in detail. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the compound is assembled by a Ti6 cluster anchored with two dye ligands L1. The Ti6 cluster is constructed by two trinuclear oxo-Ti3 subunits linked by a μ2-O bridge in a C2 symmetry (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2a, ESI†). In the Ti3 subunits a μ3-O atom bridges the three Ti atoms, two Ti atoms of which take the octahedral and the other one takes bipyramidal coordination geometries. The two carboxylate groups of L1 are in the same bridge mode as that previously described in the structure of Ti6-MAL.8 The ethylene groups in 1 are conjugated to the directly connected phenyl group of TPA with torsion angles of 2.54 and 17.20 degrees (the angle of the phenyl and ethylene planes). There are two molecules in an asymmetric unit for 2 with the torsion angles of 1.00, 1.00, 1.16 and 4.12 degree, respectively, showing a better conjugation property than 1. The conjugated structures allow the charge transfer from the TPA or DEPA to the cluster. The antenna-like dyes orientate to one side (Fig. 2a and b), which leaves space for the TOC core to fuse with the TiO2 surface (discussed later).
 Fig. 2  Compounds 1 (a), 2 (b) and 3 (c) in ball-stick plots. The dye molecules are presented as sticks (H atoms and methyl groups of the isopropanols are omitted for clarity). 
Compound 3 is also a Ti6 cluster like 1 and 2, but all the Ti atoms take the octahedral coordination geometries. The two trinuclear Ti3 subunits are double bridged by two μ3–O bridges in a Ci symmetry (Fig. 2c) and the cluster mode in 3 is different to that in 1 and 2 (Fig. S3, ESI†). The o-BDC in bridging mode coordinates to two different Ti3 subunits by carboxyl groups. One of the two carboxyl groups of L1 is esterified by isopropanal leading to monocarboxyl coordination of the L1′ to TiO cluster.

Fig. 3a shows the solid-state UV-vis-NIR spectra of 1 and 2 along with that of the Ti6-MAL (a mother cluster). The insets include photos of golden color crystals of 1 and 2. In comparison with the colorless crystal of Ti6-MAL, the main absorptions of the dye anchored clusters 1 and 2 are around at 440 nm and the band tails extend to 580 nm. The estimated band gap energy is 2.3 eV (540 nm). Based on theoretical calculations the low energy absorption band is assigned to the dye ligand to Ti(IV) metal charge transfer (LMCT) band. Most coefficients of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, HOMO−1) of 1 are all located on the TPA moiety (donor), and those of the lowest unoccupied frontier molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1) are mainly located on the TiO cluster (acceptor) (Fig. 3b). Recently, Fujisawa demonstrated theoretically that efficient interfacial charge-transfer between TiO2 and dyes is one of the crucial factors in photoelectric conversion efficiency.10 Compounds 1 and 2 showed quasi-reversible redox peaks in the cyclic voltammogram with oxidation potentials at 1.08 and 1.14 V (100 mV s−1vs. SCE), respectively (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4, ESI†) for their electron conjugated systems. Reversible redox properties is a required characteristic for photoactive dyes.

It has been reported that effective surface anchoring can minimize the reversed charge combination and consequently improve the PCE.11 The method of dye-semiconductor anchoring is a crucial factor for charge-separation and exciton transfer. We use compounds 1 and 2 as new TiO-dyes to fabricate dye modified TiO2 electrodes for photocurrent response measurements (see the ESI†). The electrodes were prepared by soaking the TiO2/ITO electrode in the solution of the compounds. NMR spectra revealed clearly the presence of the clusters in solution (Fig. S5, ESI†). The compound treated TiO2 electrodes were characterized by Raman, XPS spectra and SEM measurements (Fig. S6–S8, ESI†). The Raman and XPS results indicated that the clusters were maintained and only the isopropyl groups were lost when the clusters were condensed on the TiO2 surface (see a discussion in ESI† materials). The images of SEM show that a layer of about 15 μm thick TiO2 film with a nano grain surface was obtained and changes are not observed on the surface morphology of the cluster treated TiO2 film in comparison with that of the TiO2/ITO substrate.

Fig. 4a displays the photocurrent density at 0 V bias along with that of the Ti6-MAL treated electrode, using a two electrode cell in an I2/I3− solution (0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.1 mol L−1 LiI, and 0.6 mol L−1 TBAI in acetonitrile). The photocurrents are repeatable and stable without an obvious decrease, which demonstrates the physicochemical stability of the electrodes. The response of the electrode to the illumination is as quick as the turning moment (a square wave), which shows the good exciton mobility. The current densities of electrodes of 1 and 2 are around 0.4 mA cm−2 which is dramatically higher than that of the Ti6-MAL electrode. This result clearly shows that the enhanced photocurrents are dominantly contributed by the anchored dyes, because the data of the Ti6-MAL (the same Ti6 core as that in 1 and 2) electrode are comparable to the blank TiO2 electrodes. Repeated experiments showed that the photosensitivity of the diethylphenylamine derivative 2 is comparable to or slightly better than that of the triphenylamine derivative 1, which is unexpected from the point of view of their electron donating ability. Based on CV results, 2 should be worse than 1 in electron transfer, because the redox potential of 2 is higher than that of 1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). The flexible diethyl group in 2 may be responsible for the improvement of the photocurrent property due to the better spatial compatibility of the DEPA moiety. The structural analysis discussed above has shown that L2 has a better conjugated structure than that of L1 in the solid state.

(d) Photocurrent densities of the electrodes treated with different concentrations of 1 (two-electrode cell, 0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.1 mol L−1 LiI, and 0.6 mol L−1 TBAI in acetonitrile). 
A reported TPA dye, 4-(diphenylamino)-phenylcyanoacrylic acid (L0) (Fig. S9, ESI†) was used as a contrast to evaluate the photocurrent activity of compounds 1 and 2. L0 is a basic TPA dye used widely in DSSC studies due to the electron donor–acceptor separation structure.6,12 Under the same experimental conditions, the photocurrent densities of compound 1 and the contrast are described in Fig. 4b. The photocurrent density of 1 is better than that of L0, though the electron withdrawing coefficient (σI) of the carboxyl group, 0.34, is smaller than that of the cyanide group, 0.51.13 The excellent behavior of 1 in photoconversion can be explained by the pre-dye anchored cluster structure, where the anchoring moiety is the TiO cluster. Although the data cannot be used in the direct judgment with the reported data, the related intensities of different dye systems measured under the same conditions are reliable. The J–V curves of the 1 treated electrode in light on and off are displayed in Fig. 4c. Fig. 4d gives the photocurrent density of electrodes treated with different concentrations of 1, in which 0.5 mmol L−1 is selected for general electrode modification.

Fig. 5a displays the photocurrent density of 1 (Ti6-L1) and 3 (Ti6-L1′) treated electrodes measured under the same experimental conditions. Obviously, the J value of 3 is much lower than that of 1 though 3 is also a Ti6 oxo cluster with two TPA ligands. There are some reasons to explain the results. The stability of the TiO cluster is an important factor for the surface property of the dye cluster modified electrode. We have discussed that the TiO clusters undergo dealkoxylation and condensation on the TiO2 surface, which makes the dye molecules anchor firmly on semiconductors.3 The combination of dye molecules with the TiO2 surface will be weakened if the cluster is too stable to be condensed. The stabilities of 1–3 were checked via XRD. After 3 days under ambient conditions most XRD peaks of crystals 1 and 2 disappeared but those of 3 kept unchanged (Fig. 5b and c,) which is because in 3 two additional o-BDC ligands replace four isopropanol groups to coordinate on the cluster and therefore the cluster is stabilized. Fig. 5d displays the Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the electrodes modified by 1 and 3. As seen from the figure, 1 exhibits a small arc compared with 3 in the high-frequency region. This indicates a lower value of interfacial charge transfer resistance at the surface boundary. The result further confirms the effective anchoring property of the 1 electrode. In the low-frequency region, both the electrodes show lines with similar slopes that indicate the similar diffusive resistance of the cells. On the other hand, the number of bonding groups is also responsible for the efficiency of the photoelectron transfer between the dye molecule and the TiO material.14 The charge-transfer band of 1 (two carboxyl groups anchored) shifts obviously to the red side in comparison with that of 3 (mono carboxyl group anchored), which is more clear in the solution spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†).

In summary, triphenylamine based dyes are classical ones applied in DSSCs. Three Ti6 TOCs modified with such photoactive triphenylamine derivatives as single crystals were successfully isolated by in situ solvothermal synthesis. They are unusual examples in that real photosensitive dyes are modified on TOCs. An efficient charge transfer from the TPA or DEPA electron donor to the TiO cluster core was evaluated by electronic spectra and theoretical calculations. The photocurrent densities of 1 and 2 are better than that of the classical cyanoacrylic TPA photosensitizer L0, because the TOC core can act as an efficient anchoring moiety. The photocurrent densities are also better than that of 3, because 3 itself is too stable to effectively bond on the TiO2 surface. Using the TPA dye pre-anchoring TOCs as an organic–inorganic hybrid dye has advantages for DSSC applications. This work deepens the understanding of the dye-TiO pre-anchored organic–inorganic hybrid TOCs.
