    , Accepted 9th September 2017First published on 9th September 2017AbstractAs an emerging material for optoelectronic applications, cesium lead halide (CsPbX3) nanocrystals (NCs) have drawn considerable attention because of their excellent photophysical properties. For the first time, we report a fast and efficient microwave-assisted strategy for the synthesis of high-quality CsPbX3 NCs with controllable morphologies (nanocube, nanoplate and nanorod). The prepared CsPbX3 nanocubes show high PLQY, approximately 75%, and narrow full width at half maximum emission line (from 9 to 34 nm) covering the entire spectrum of the visible range. Plate-like and rod-like CsPbBr3 NCs can also be obtained by attenuating the reaction parameters. A feasible kinetics-controlled growth mechanism of such NCs has been proposed and verified. The as-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs show excellent optical performance as a green light source in a white light emitting diode prototype device. This work not only provides a new synthetic path for the preparation of high-quality CsPbX3 NCs, but also sheds some light on the fundamental study and practical applications of such NCs.
Introduction
Since the rise of nanotechnology in the 1990s, it has been well established that the chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials are highly dependent on their shape and size. Hence, much effort is focused on the development of new technologies that can prepare nanomaterials with controlled shapes and desired physiochemical properties. Amongst the various synthetic approaches, the microwave-assisted method, utilizing microwave as an internal heating source, has attracted considerable attention.1,2 Compared to conventional heating ovens, microwave ovens have several advantages, including higher chemical yield, lower energy consumption, shorter reaction time, and selective heating.3,4 As a result, microwave-assisted methods have been widely used to prepare both organic and inorganic materials. With the development of microwave-assisted synthesis, these techniques have been successfully used in some industrial applications, such as in pharmaceuticals, food industries, and chemical industry.5–8
As an emerging material, lead halide (ABX3, where A = CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+, C6H5CH2CH2NH3+, or Cs+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−, or their mixture) perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have recently attracted increasing attention due to their excellent photophysical properties and potential applications.9–16 Compared to traditional semiconductor NCs, such as group II–VI (CdS, CdSe, CdTe) and III–V (InP, InAs) NCs, the new family of ABX3 perovskite NCs have several advantages.17,18 For example, the emission of traditional semiconductor NCs is highly sensitive to their shape and size. A small change in size or shape of such NCs can lead to a large variation in their emission peak position, which makes it very difficult to manufacture identical products with the exact same quality from batch to batch. A complex reaction setup, such as inert atmosphere and high reaction temperature, and tedious preparation processes are required for the synthesis of high quality traditional semiconductor NCs, leading to high cost and difficulty in industrial applications. Low volume production and low yield of traditional semiconductor NCs also impede their wide applications. As a comparison, the optical properties of ABX3 perovskite NCs are mainly determined by their composition rather than size and shape. If the size is larger than the Bohr radius, it suggests better reproducibility. ABX3 perovskite NCs have not been studies well so far, but they are emerging as better candidates for diverse applications. For instance, the organic–inorganic hybrid ABX3 perovskite NCs have shown great performance in solar cells and light emitting diodes (LEDs).19–25 Recently, all-inorganic ABX3 perovskite NCs, particularly CsPbX3 NCs, have begun to attract more and more attention because of their outstanding photophysical properties, including high PL quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow emission widths.26 More importantly, they have shown superior stability against moisture and oxygen compared to organic–inorganic hybrid ABX3 perovskite NCs, suggesting promising potential for practical applications.27,28
In 2015, Kovalenko group reported the first successful preparation of an all-inorganic CsPbX3 NC through a hot-injection method, in which cesium oleate (CsOL) was rapidly injected into a mixture containing lead halide, capping ligands (oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm)), and 1-octadecene (ODE) at high temperatures (140–200 °C).29 Since then, much effort has been devoted to the preparation of high-quality CsPbX3 NCs and various synthetic methods, including anion-exchange,30–32 room-temperature precipitation,33,34 ultrasonication,35 solvothermal,36 post-synthetic conversion from Cs4PbX6,37,38 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD),39–41 have been developed. For example, a method at room temperature has been demonstrated by Zeng group, in which a poor solvent, such as toluene, is rapidly injected into the well-dissolved precursor solution (cesium halide and lead halide in dimethyl formamide or dimethyl sulfoxide) to initiate the re-precipitation process.34 With the assistance of OA and OAm, monodisperse CsPbX3 NCs have been prepared. Our group recently developed a solvothermal method to prepare high-quality CsPbX3 NCs.36 The precursors are simply mixed in an autoclave, which is then heated to and kept at a desired temperature of 160 °C for a fixed amount of time. Uniform CsPbX3 nanocubes and ultrathin nanowires have been successfully prepared. Manna and co-workers recently demonstrated an interesting transformation process, in which nearly monodisperse but non-fluorescent Cs4PbX6 NCs are synthesized first, followed by their treatment with excessive lead halide, producing uniform and highly fluorescent CsPbX3 NCs.37 We recently found that highly fluorescent CsPbX3 NCs can also be obtained by treating Cs4PbX6 NCs with water through a CsX-stripping mechanism.42 Although great progress has been made in the synthesis of CsPbX3 NCs, new synthetic tools are still needed to boost the study and application of such NCs. For instance, despite the great achievement in the control of morphologies of CsPbX3 NCs, the growth mechanism is not clear. As a result, not many dedicated structures have been prepared. More research efforts should be focussed towards this direction, which may lead to the large scale synthesis of high-quality CsPbX3 NCs with more complicated structures and desired properties.
In this study, for the first time, we report that high-quality CsPbX3 NCs with controllable morphology can be prepared through an efficient and fast microwave-assisted synthesis approach. By utilizing the advantages of microwave heating, such as high heating rate and low energy consumption, uniform CsPbX3 NCs with superior photophysical properties have been prepared. By altering the anion composition, the PL emission peak can be readily attenuated from 410 nm to 694 nm. The PL full width at half maximum (FWHMs) are very narrow (from 9 nm to 34 nm). The morphologies of CsPbX3 NCs can be well controlled. Uniform CsPbX3 nanocubes, nanoplates and nanorods have been successfully prepared by controlling the reaction parameters, such as reaction temperature, heating rate, and pre-dissolution precursors. The potential applications of such NCs as an emitting layer have also been demonstrated by fabricating a white LED prototype.
Results and discussion
In a typical experiment, cesium acetate (CsOAc), lead halide (PbX2, X = Cl, Br, I, or their mixture), certain amounts of trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OAm), and 1-octadecene (ODE) were mixed in a microwave quartz tube, which was then put into a microwave reactor (the microwave reactor can be found in Fig. S1 in ESI†). Compared with the hot-injection method, in which Cs-oleate should be prepared separately and the reaction should be conducted in an inert atmosphere,29,43–45 this microwave-assisted method is much simpler, where all precursors were simply mixed in the microwave tube in air. No other pre-treatment is needed. The reaction system was then heated to 160 °C at a heating rate of 28 °C min−1 and kept at that temperature for 5 min. After cooling to room temperature, the crude solution was cleaned with hexane twice (more details can be found in the experimental section). Herein, we use CsPbBr3 NCs as the example. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was conducted. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, monodisperse cube-like CsPbBr3 NCs were obtained through this microwave-assisted approach. The average edge length of CsPbBr3 nanocubes is ∼10.8 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) measurement shows a clear lattice spacing of 0.58 nm, which is in good agreement with the (100) plane of cubic CsPbBr3. The crystal structure of prepared product has been further confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction measurement. As shown in Fig. 1d, the product can be indexed as cubic phase CsPbBr3 (JCPDS card # 54-752). Other high-quality CsPbX3 (X = Cl, I, Cl/Br and Br/I) NCs can also be obtained through this microwave-assisted synthesis method. Fig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of all CsPbX3 NCs, from which one can clearly tell that cubic-phase perovskite CsPbX3 NCs have been successfully prepared. A clear shift of characteristic peaks from higher 2θ range to lower 2θ range can be observed when the halide composition is changed from chloride to iodide. This shift can be interpreted by the increased radii from chloride to iodide.46,47

(f) UV-vis absorption (solid line) and PL emission spectra (dash line) of colloidal CsPbX3 NCs. The PL spectra were collected under an excitation of 400 nm for all but 350 nm for CsPbCl3 samples. 
The corresponding TEM images of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, I, Cl/Br and Br/I) NCs are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the size distribution histograms of CsPbBr3, CsPb(Cl/Br)3 and CsPb(Br/I)3 are presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Cube-like structures can be obtained when mixed halides are used. However, only large particles of CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 could be prepared, which might be attributed to the low solubility of PbCl2 and PbI2.29,36 Bright PL emission can be observed in all samples upon irradiation with UV light, as shown in the photograph (Fig. 1e). A great feature of CsPbX3 NCs is their composition-dependent PL properties. By adjusting the halide composition, the emission spectra of CsPbX3 NCs can cover the entire visible range. For example, CsPbBr3 NCs emit bright green light. The absorption and emission peaks are 507 nm and 516 nm, respectively (Fig. 1f). The PLQY of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 NCs was calculated to be about 75%. Because of the uniform size distribution, the emission peak is very sharp with a narrow FWHM of 17 nm. The emission spectra can be readily tuned in the range of 410 nm and 694 nm by varying the halide composition (Fig. 1f). The corresponding FWHMs are 9 nm, 14 nm, 30 nm, and 34 nm for CsPbCl3, CsP(Cl/Br)3, CsPb(Br/I)3, and CsPbI3 NCs, respectively.
The shape and size of colloidal NCs are important for their physical and chemical properties. In previous reports, CsPbBr3 with various shapes, such as nanocubes,29,30,34,48 nanoplates,49–52 and nanowires,53–56 have been prepared. It has been demonstrated that the reaction temperature, duration time, and capping ligands are important in determining the final morphology. We demonstrate here that plate-like and rod-like CsPbBr3 NCs can also be prepared by controlling the reaction parameters. For example, when the reaction temperature was set as 80 °C and the other reaction parameters were kept constant, plate-like CsPbBr3 NCs were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2a, some plates stand vertically, while some lie flat on the TEM grids. The edge length of product is ∼23.4 nm, and the thickness is ∼3.3 nm. Since this thickness is smaller than the Bohr radius of bulk CsPbBr3 (∼3.5 nm), a quantum confinement effect can be observed.50,52 As shown in the inset in Fig. 2b, the as-prepared CsPbBr3 nanoplates emit bright greenish-blue color, which is different from the green emission of bulk CsPbBr3. The quantum confinement effect has been further verified by the UV-vis absorption and PL emission measurements. As plotted in Fig. 2b, the absorption peak and emission peaks are located at 482 nm and 495 nm, respectively. As a comparison, the absorption peak and emission peaks of bulk CsPbBr3 are located at 516 nm.57,58 CsPb(Cl/Br)3 and CsPb(Br/I)3 nanoplates can also be obtained at the same temperature. The TEM images and corresponding absorption/PL emission spectra are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The thickness of CsPb(Cl/Br)3 and CsPb(Br/I)3 is 3.6 nm and 3.2 nm, respectively.

Our group recently reported that pre-dissolution of precursors in the solvothermal synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs is important in determining the morphology of the product.36 Ultrathin nanowires have been obtained when the precursors are pre-dissolved prior to the solvothermal treatment. In the microwave-assisted approach, rod-like CsPbBr3 NCs with high morphological yield (>90%) can be obtained when the precursors are pre-dissolved and the other reaction parameters are kept the same as those of CsPbBr3 nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 2c, rod-like or short wire-like CsPbBr3 NCs have been successfully prepared. The diameter of such NCs is ∼2.7 nm, which is also smaller than the Bohr radius of bulk CsPbBr3. A bright blue emission can be seen when the sample is irradiated with UV light (inset in Fig. 2d). However, the diameter of such nanorods is not as uniform as the ultrathin nanowires obtained in the solvothermal method. An emission peak at 456 nm can be detected. Moreover, a small shoulder in the longer wavelength range can also be found (Fig. 2d), which can be attributed to the nanorods with larger diameters. CsPb(Cl/Br)3 and CsPb(Br/I)3 can also be obtained under the same condition. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the diameters of CsPb(Cl/Br)3 and CsPb(Br/I)3 nanorods are 4.1 and 3.5 nm, respectively. The capping ligands, TOPO in particular, play an important role in this process. In the absence of TOPO, while the other parameters are kept the same, only large agglomeration was observed at both 80 °C and 160 °C (data not shown here). From the experimental observation, it is observed that TOPO favors the dissolution of precursors and thus helps to get high-quality products.
Much effort has been devoted to the mechanistic study of CsPbX3 NCs.36,44,59,60 It has been demonstrated that several parameters are important for the final morphology of NCs. For example, Yang and co-workers pointed out that reaction duration time is important. Prolonging the reaction time from several seconds to 60 min can lead to the transformation from nanocubes to nanowires.44 Deng group reported that CsPbX3 NCs with varying shapes can be prepared using different combinations of organic acids and amines.59 In this work, based on the above-mentioned results, we can conclude that the reaction temperature and concentration of precursors are two important factors, as depicted in Scheme 1. At a lower reaction temperature (i.e., 80 °C), the dissolution of precursors was relatively slow, resulting in lower reaction kinetics that may favour the formation of plate-like structures. When the reaction temperature is raised to higher temperature (i.e., 160 °C), the reaction kinetics is faster because of the faster dissolution of precursors. Furthermore, altering the reaction kinetics by the pre-dissolution of precursors will lead to the formation of rod-like structures. As a result, the morphology change can be interpreted by a kinetics controlled growth process.
 Scheme 1  Proposed growth process of CsPbBr3 NCs through the microwave-assisted synthesis approach. Without pre-dissolution of precursors, CsPbBr3 nanoplates are obtained at low temperature (i.e., 80 °C), and monodisperse nanocubes can be prepared at elevated temperature (i.e., 160 °C). When the precursors are pre-dissolved, CsPbBr3 nanorods are obtained. 
To prove the proposed growth mechanism, we carefully studied the effect of reaction temperature. As stated in Fig. 1a and 2a, nanocubes and nanoplates can be obtained when the reaction temperature is set at 160 °C and 80 °C, respectively. When the reaction temperature is raised from 80 °C to 120 °C, a clear morphological change from nanoplate to nanocube is observed. As shown in Fig. 3a, a mixture of nanocubes and nanoplates is obtained, confirming the proposed growth mechanism. Due to a non-uniform morphology, only a small shoulder at 510 nm can be identified in the absorption spectrum (red line in Fig. 3d). Moreover, the emission spectrum is quite broad with an FWHM of 25 nm. Raising the temperature to 140 °C led to the formation of uniform nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 4b, the average edge length of the sample is about 10.2 nm. The size distribution histogram is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Compared to the product obtained at 120 °C, the size uniformity of nanoparticles was improved significantly, as evidenced from the much narrower PL emission spectrum with an FWHM of 20 nm (Fig. 3d). When the reaction temperature is further raised to 180 °C, although cubic phase CsPbBr3 NCs can still be prepared (see XRD pattern in Fig. 3e), only irregular shaped nanoparticles and large agglomeration can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 3c. The large agglomeration and non-uniform NCs can be attributed to the relatively poor chelating effect of OA/OAm at a high temperature. As stated in several previous reports, the interaction between OA/OAm and CsPbBr3 NCs is quite weak. In addition, amine groups in solvent may lead to the desorption of ligands from CsPbBr3 NCs surface due to the proton transfer between OA and OAm.61,62 As a result, elevated temperature is not suitable for the preparation of CsPbBr3 NCs when OA/OAm is used as the capping ligand.

Microwave-assisted synthesis methods have been characterized by high heating rate and uniform size distribution of product. In this work, the influence of heating rate on the morphology and quality of product has been investigated carefully by using the preparation of CsPbBr3 NCs as the example. As mentioned previously, monodisperse cube-like CsPbBr3 NCs with edge length of about 10.8 nm can be obtained when the heating rate is 28 °C min−1 (Fig. 1a). When the heating rate was set as 18 °C min−1 and the other reaction parameters were kept the same, uniform CsPbBr3 nanocubes could still be obtained. The average edge length was ∼11.2 nm (Fig. 4a). On further decreasing the heating rate to 12 °C min−1, although most of products were still nanocubes (about 15.1 nm in size), some large particles could be observed (Fig. 4b). Correspondingly, the PL emission spectra became broader and asymmetric (green line in Fig. 4d). A small shoulder at about 500 nm could be detected, suggesting non-uniform size distribution. When the heating rate was 8 °C min−1, only large and irregular particles could be obtained. As shown in Fig. 4c, the size of some big particles was over 150 nm, while some smaller particles could also be observed. As a result, the shoulder at about 500 nm became more pronounced (blue line in Fig. 4d), confirming the broad size distribution. It is well known that the reaction kinetics is critical for the formation of colloidal NCs. When the heating rate is too low, the dissolution of precursors and the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs are slow, resulting in the formation of large and irregular shaped nanoparticles. On the other hand, this result further confirms the unique feature of microwave-assisted methods.
Therefore, the heating rates in the following parts were fixed at 28 °C min−1.
It has been well known that the quality of CsPbX3 NCs is determined by several factors, including reaction temperature, capping ligands, and precursors.58 Cs2CO3 has been widely used as a precursor for the preparation of CsPbX3 NCs, particularly in the hot-injection method. Recently, cesium acetate (CsOAc) has been regarded as a better cesium source because it has higher solubility in non-polar solvent than Cs2CO3. Herein, we find that this microwave-assisted synthesis method is a general and efficient method, through which monodisperse CsPbX3 NCs can also be obtained when Cs2CO3 is used as the cesium precursor. As shown in Fig. 5, CsPbX3 NCs (X = Br, Cl/Br, and Br/I) with narrow size distribution were obtained when the reaction temperature was set at 160 °C using Cs2CO3 as the cesium precursor. The average edge lengths are 10.7 ± 1.3 nm, 9.9 ± 1.2 nm, and 11.5 ± 1.7 nm for CsPbBr3 (Fig. 5a), CsPb(Cl/Br)3 (Fig. 5b), and CsPb(Br/I)3 (Fig. 5c), respectively. The size distribution histograms are depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Accordingly, the products show bright emission under UV light irradiation, as demonstrated by the inset photographs. The PL emission peak positions of the products are 515 nm, 486 nm, and 585 nm, as plotted in Fig. 5d. Because of the narrow size distribution, the emission spectra are also very sharp. The FWHMs are 17 nm, 14 nm and 30 nm for CsPbBr3, CsPb(Cl/Br)3, and CsPb(Br/I)3, respectively.

(d) The corresponding absorption and PL spectra of CsPbBr3 (blue line), CsPb(Cl/Br)3 (green line) and CsPb(Br/I)3 (orange line), respectively. The PL spectra were collected under excitation of 400 nm. 
Because of their outstanding photophysical properties, such as high PLQY, narrow FWHM of the PL emission, and composition-dependent attenuating emission wavelength, CsPbX3 NCs have emerged as a promising candidate for both lighting and display.11 Since CsPbX3 NCs obtained through this microwave-assisted method have also shown excellent optical properties, a down-converted LED has been fabricated to demonstrate the potential use of such NCs as liquid crystal display backlights. Fig. 6a illustrates white LEDs (WLEDs) device structure, in which the CsPbBr3–polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) composite film was used as the green light source, CdSe/ZnS–PMMA composite film was used as the red light source, and GaN chips were used as the blue light source. The PL spectra of the prototype device is depicted in Fig. 6b, from which one can clearly see the sharp emission peaks located in the blue, green and red range. Saturated white emission can be clearly observed when the device is operated, as demonstrated by the photograph shown in Fig. 6c. With an applied current of 20 mA, this device yields a power efficiency of 65 lm W−1. The CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) coordinate of this fabricated white emission is (0.31, 0.32), as shown in Fig. 6d, which is very close to the standard white emission (0.33, 0.33). It is worth noting that the color gamut of CsPbBr3 based down-converted device is much larger than that of National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard (about 125% of NTSC 1931).63 This result clearly demonstrates that the as-prepared CsPbX3 NCs are promising materials for the future applications in wide-color gamut display devices.

Conclusions
In summary, a fast and efficient microwave-assisted synthesis method has been developed to synthesize high-quality all-inorganic perovskite material CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, Cl/Br and Br/I) with a controlled morphology and highly luminescent properties. Through a systematic study, CsPbX3 NCs with varying shapes, including cube-, plate-, and rod-like, and high yield have been successfully prepared. A plausible kinetics-controlled growth mechanism has been proposed, in which the reaction temperature, capping ligands, and concentration of ions are responsible for the shape control process. The emission of CsPbX3 NCs can be readily attenuated in the entire visible light range (410–694 nm) by varying the anion composition. Because of its excellent photophysical properties, CsPbBr3 NCs have been used as a green light source to fabricate a white LED device with great performance. This work is important because it not only provides a new synthetic path for the preparation of high-quality CsPbX3 NCs, but also sheds some light on the fundamental study and practical applications of such NCs.

The other chemicals were used as received without purification.
Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I, Cl/Br and Br/I) NCs
In a typical experiment, a microwave reaction tube with a volume of about 55 mL was used as the reactor. Cesium acetate (0.092 mmol), PbX2 (X = Cl, Br, I, Cl/Br and Br/I, 0.376 mmol), ODE (15 mL), OA (1 mL), OAm (1 mL), and TOPO (0.5 g) were loaded into the microwave tube, which was then placed in the microwave reactor. The solvent parameters were set as nonpolar. The heating time was set as 5 min, and the temperature was 160 °C. The reaction duration time was set as 5 min. For the synthesis of CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 NCs, 2 mL of TOP was used as the co-solvent to improve the solubility of PbCl2 and PbI2. When the reaction was completed, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. Furthermore, 10 mL of hexane was then added into the crude solution, and the products were collected by centrifugation at a speed of 7000–10000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitates were redispersed in 10 mL hexane and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The products were stored and were ready for characterization.
Preparation of CsPbX3 nanoplates
The reaction parameters for synthesizing nanoplates were the same as those of nanocubes except that the reaction temperature was 80 °C. When the reaction was completed, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. Furthermore, 10 mL of hexane was then added into the crude solution, and the products were collected by centrifugation at speed of 11000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitates were redispersed in 10 mL hexane and then centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min. The products were stored and ready for characterization.
Synthesis of CsPbX3 nanorods
In a typical experiment, CsOAc, PbX2, OA (1 mL), OAm (1 mL) and TOPO (0.5 g) were loaded into a flask and stirred at 60 °C until the precursors were dissolved. The crude solution was then loaded into the microwave tube and heated to desired temperature. When the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, 10 mL of hexane was added to the solution, and the products were collected by centrifugation at a speed of 7000 rpm for 5 min. The precipitates were redispersed in 10 mL hexane and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min.
Fabrication of WLED devices
The green and red emissive layers of CsPbBr3–PMMA and CdSe/ZnS–PMMA were prepared by mixing the NCs into PMMA solution. Then, the CsPbBr3–PMMA and CdSe/ZnS–PMMA layers were casted onto the blue GaN chips in sequence.
Characterization
The microwave reactor (Preekem) used was from Qi Yao of Shang Hai Co. TEM and HRTEM data were acquired at 200 kV using a TECNAI G2 F20 (FEI, USA). Powder XRD patterns were measured on a desktop diffractometer (D2 PHASER, Bruker, Germany) with a Cu Kα source. The PL and PLQY measurements were conducted using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FLUOROMAX-4). A UV spectrometer (SPECORD S 600) was used to record the UV-vis spectra in the range of 300–800 nm. A Leica DM4000M microscope was used to record the fluorescence images of NCs solution excited under 365 nm light. The PLQY values were measured using a 400 nm light as the excitation light and a calibrated integrating sphere.
