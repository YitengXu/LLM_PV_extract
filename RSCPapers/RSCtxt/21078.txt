    , Accepted 18th August 2021First published on 18th August 2021AbstractPreparation of phase-pure and stable formamidinium-based lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is essential for fabricating high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report using very little CsPbBr3 perovskite (2%, molar ratio to FAPbI3) to stabilize the black-phase α-FAPbI3. Specifically, the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 powder is added to the PbI2 precursor. It is found that the interlayer spacing of layered PbI2 can be stretched due to the formation of the PbI2–DMSO–CsPbBr3 intermediate phase, which can promote the penetration of FAI and the transformation to black phase α-FAPbI3. The incorporation of CsPbBr3 not only stabilizes the FAPbI3 phase but also results in a high-quality film with increased grain size and suppressed bulk defects. Therefore, the resultant PSCs exhibit enhanced built-in potential, improved carrier extraction, and suppressed non-radiative recombination. As a result, the corresponding PSCs deliver a champion efficiency of 23.34%. Moreover, the PSCs stabilized with CsPbBr3 show much improved operational stability, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after 1153 hours following the maximum power point (MPP) tracking under one sun illumination; while the efficiencies of control devices w/o CsPbBr3 drop to 80% of their initial efficiencies after 75 hours.
Introduction
The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been dramatically improved from 3.8% to 25.5% in about one decade. The incredible growth of PCE is mostly due to their superior optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficient, tunable bandgaps, long carrier diffusion length, and high defect tolerance.1–11 The chemical formula of perovskite materials can be expressed as ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), or cesium (Cs+), B is lead or tin, and X is a halogen. Among the perovskite family, FAPbI3-based perovskites demonstrate close-to-ideal bandgaps, improved thermal stability, and reduced defect density.5,12–14 As far as we know, record-efficiency PSCs are exclusively fabricated using FAPbI3-based perovskites as light absorbers.7–10,12,15
Since the pure α-FAPbI3 possesses the lowest bandgap (1.47 eV) among the FAPbI3-based perovskites, PSCs based on pure α-FAPbI3 enable the broadest spectral absorption range and the highest theoretical PCE.13,16 However, it is widely reported that the pure α-FAPbI3 phase spontaneously undergoes the α-to-δ phase transition at room temperature. Therefore, stabilizing α-FAPbI3 while minimizing the spectral loss is essential to fabricate high-performance PSCs. A variety of additives, such as MAI,17 MACl,7,18,19 CsI,6,20–24 and MABr/PbBr2,25 have been employed as stabilizers to improve the phase stability of α-FAPbI3. The incorporation of small-size A-site cations and X-site halides induces entropy gains and lattice contraction, which strengthens the Pb–I bonds and mitigates the formation of defects.26,27 These precursor-type stabilizers can be categorized into two types according to their effect on the resultant stabilized perovskite's bandgap. The first type of stabilizer, Br-free ones (MAI, MACl, and CsI), only slightly enlarges the final perovskite bandgap since A-site doping contributes little to the band structure, and the residual content of chloride is negligible.18,26 In contrast, the other type, i.e., bromide-based species (PbBr2 and/or MABr), substantially enlarges the bandgap and results in a severe spectral absorption loss.26,27 Therefore, to stabilize α-FAPbI3 with Br-containing stabilizers for high-performance PSCs, one must optimize the composition of the stabilizer and ensure that the doping content is low. In this way, the stabilized quasi-pure FAPbI3, with a small amount of A- and X-site doping, could deliver significantly improved optoelectric properties but only slightly compromise the light absorption.
In addition to the compositional adjusting and α-phase stabilization effect, the designed stabilizers can also tune the intermediate phase and modulate the crystallization kinetics in perovskite formation. It is reported that there exist three phase-formation stages during the crystallization of perovskites: (I) precursor state; (II) hexagonal phase; and (III) complex phases that include hexagonal polytypes, intermediate phases, and α-phase perovskite.28 Hexagonal polytypes should be avoided before annealing to obtain high-quality perovskite films.28 Because the face-sharing hexagonal polytypes require twice bond breaking to form the corner-sharing α-FAPbI3, and this process is energetically unfavorable. The introduction of perovskite stabilizers may modulate any of these phase-formation stages. For this purpose, a perovskite seeding growth of FA-based perovskite has been reported. By introducing triple-cation perovskite precursors as colloidal seeds into the PbI2 layer, the perovskite growth can be promoted, and the efficiency and stability of PSCs can be improved.29–31 Recently, it is reported that the hexagonal phase non-perovskite (δ-CsPbI3 or δ-RbPbI3) can help bypass the formation of the hexagonal phase during the conversion of PbI2 into perovskite, as there are already hexagonal lattices in the intermediate phase.32,33 Most recently, Yoo et al. reported that a trace amount of MAPbBr3 perovskite could help stabilize the quasi-pure FAPbI3, showing improved optoelectronic properties and device performance.15 These reports imply that rational design of the chemical composition and crystalline state of stabilizers plays a vital role in fabricating high-performance PSCs.
Here, we show that we can stabilize the α-FAPbI3 perovskite using a perovskite-type stabilizer, i.e., pre-synthesized CsPbBr3, in a very low amount to obtain stable quasi-pure FAPbI3. The pre-synthesized cubic-phase CsPbBr3 perovskite powder is added into the PbI2 precursor, and the CsPbBr3 will not fully dissociate into the precursor state (PbBr2 and CsBr) but remain as CsPbBr3 lattices. We find that CsPbBr3 lattices can interact with PbI2 lattices to form the PbI2–DMSO–CsPbBr3 intermediate phase, which increases the interlayer spacing of layered PbI2 and improves the penetration of FAI to PbI2 lattices. The resultant PSCs stabilized with CsPbBr3 exhibit enhanced built-in potential, improved carrier extraction, and suppressed non-radiative recombination. As a result, the corresponding PSCs deliver a champion efficiency of 23.34%. More importantly, the PSCs stabilized with CsPbBr3 show much improved operational stability, retaining 80% of their initial efficiency after 1153 hours of MPP tracking under one sun illumination.
Experimental
Materials
Materials employed in experiments include tin(IV) oxide (SnO2, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.99%, TCI), formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.99%, GreatcellSolar), methylammonium iodide (MAI, 98.0%, TCI), methylammonium chloride (MACl, 98.0%, TCI), 1-naphthylmethylammonium iodide (NMAI, 95%, Aladdin), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, Feiming Technology Corporation), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), isopropanol (IPA, 99.8%, Acros), chlorobenzene (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP, 96%, Sigma-Aldrich). All materials were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of CsPbBr3
CsPbBr3 perovskite powder was synthesized using the methods previously reported.34 In brief, 7.35 g of PbBr2 was first dissolved in 16 mL of hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in water). Then CsBr solution (426 mg mL−1, dissolved in deionized water) was added drop by drop to produce an orange precipitate. Finally, the precipitate was filtered, washed twice using ethanol, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.
Solution preparation
The SnO2 nanocrystal solution was obtained by diluting the SnO2 colloid solution with deionized water (1:2, v/v). The SnO2 doped with NH4Cl solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of NH4Cl in 1 mL of the diluted SnO2 nanocrystal solution. The PbI2 precursor solution was prepared by mixing PbI2 (1.5 mM) and different amounts of CsPbBr3 powder (1%, 2%, 3% and 5%, molar ratio relative to PbI2) in 1 mL of mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (v/v = 9:1) and stirred at 50 °C overnight (∼12 h). For control samples, 1.5 mM of PbI2 was dissolved in the same mixed solvent. The organic salt solution was prepared by dissolving 0.345 mM of FAI, 0.035 mM of MACl, and 0.06 mM of MAI in 1 mL of IPA. The surface passivation solution was prepared by dissolving 8 mg of NMAI in 1 mL of IPA. The HTM solution was obtained by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of chlorobenzene with the addition of 28.8 μL of 4-TBP and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile).
Device fabrication
ITO substrates were cleaned with abstergent and then sequentially ultrasonicated in distilled water, acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol for 20 min respectively. After that, 30 min of UV-ozone treatment was performed before use. Double-layered SnO2 was adopted as the electron transport layer.35 The diluted SnO2 nanocrystal solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing on a hotplate at 150 °C for 15 min in air to form the first SnO2 layer. After cooling down to room temperature, SnO2 doped with NH4Cl was deposited on top of the first SnO2 layer using the same method. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min again and then immediately transferred to a nitrogen glovebox for further deposition. A two-step sequential deposition process was utilized for the fabrication of perovskite films. In the first step, the PbI2 precursor solution was spin-coated on SnO2 substrates at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by an annealing process at 70 °C for 1 min in a N2 atmosphere. In the second step, the PbI2-covered substrates were deposited with the organic salt solution via spin-coating at 1700 rpm for 30 s in a N2 atmosphere. After spinning, the samples were taken out from the glove box and annealed in air (the relative humidity is ∼30%) at 150 °C for 15 min. For the surface passivation of perovskite films, NMAI solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min.36 The hole-transport layer was deposited on the perovskite film by spin-coating the HTM solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 70 nm Au electrode was thermally evaporated on the top of the hole-transport layer.
Characterization
A UV-vis spectrophotometer (Techcomp, UV2600) was used to study the solution chemistry of the PbI2 precursor. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were conducted on a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation) using a Cu Kα radiation source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7610F). UV-vis absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films were acquired on an instrument supplied by Xipu electronics equipped with an integration sphere in a glovebox. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was measured using an FLS920 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd) with pulsed excitation at 375 nm. Dark J–V curves and space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) data were collected using the CHI660E electrochemical workstation in the dark. A laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8) with pulsed excitation at 405 nm was used to obtain the PL mapping image. Current density–voltage characterization was performed using a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5G conditions (EnliTech, AAA solar simulator). The scan rate was 200 mV s−1 (voltage step of 10 mV and delay time of 40 ms). The light intensity was calibrated using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with an infrared cutoff filter (KG-5). The active area of PSCs was 0.2 cm2. A black shadow mask with an effective area of 0.12 cm2 was used to reduce the light scattering. External quantum efficiencies were measured on an EQE system (EnliTech, QER666) without any bias light. The operational stability was monitored by a solar cell stability test system, which consisted of a white LED lamp with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 as the light source. The Mott–Schottky analysis and transient photovoltage measurements were carried out on a Zahner electrochemical workstation equipped with a transient electrochemical measurement unit (Fast CIMPS). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a CHI 660E potentiostat system. Unless otherwise stated, perovskite films and PSCs used in characterization were fabricated without NMAI passivation.
Results and discussion
In this work, the perovskite active layer is prepared with the sequential deposition method,37–39i.e., preparing the PbI2 film firstly and then converting it to the perovskite phase (see details in the Experimental section). We propose to use the pre-synthesized CsPbBr3 perovskite additive to stabilize and improve the film quality of the FAPbI3 active layer. The cubic-phase CsPbBr3 powder is synthesized according to our previous work34 and added into the PbI2 precursor. As the ionic interaction between Cs+ and PbBr64− is rather strong, the small cubic lattices of CsPbBr3 can be preserved in the solvent.40 So the CsPbBr3 lattices can most likely be preserved in the as-prepared PbI2 film. The conversion processes from the PbI2 film w/o and with the CsPbBr3 stabilizer to the perovskite film are illustrated in Fig. 1. The controlled conversion process results in a non-stable perovskite without Cs+ and Br− (Fig. 1a). The existence of a small amount of CsPbBr3 in the spin-coated PbI2 film may result in advantageous effects like altering the interaction between PbI2 and DMSO, thus tuning the properties such as layer-to-layer spacing and grain morphology of PbI2 films (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the penetration of FAI into the PbI2 film and the conversion process of PbI2 to perovskite can be promoted. However, when the incorporated content of CsPbBr3 is higher, extra CsPbBr3 lattices may compete with PbI2 to take DMSO molecules away due to the strong interaction between CsPbBr3 and DMSO,40 leading to a complex intermediate containing additional by-products such as PbBr2 and δ-CsPbI3 through halogen exchange (Fig. 1c). In other words, adding a suitable amount of CsPbBr3 stabilizer to the PbI2 precursor solution may not only realize the doping of Cs+ and Br− into the perovskite with good precision but also modulate the corresponding perovskite crystallization by tuning the intermediate phase.

(a) The molar ratio of CsPbBr3 incorporated in PbI2 is zero, forming the PbI2–DMSO complex. (b) The molar ratio of CsPbBr3 incorporated in PbI2 is low (1–3%), forming the PbI2–DMSO–CsPbBr3 intermediate phase. (c) The molar ratio of CsPbBr3 incorporated in PbI2 is higher (≥5%), resulting in halogen exchange and the formation of by-products. 
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was employed to investigate the influence of CsPbBr3 on the chemical composition of the PbI2 precursor. In this work, PbI2 was dissolved in the mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (see details in the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption peaks located at around 285 and 320 nm are ascribed to the characteristic absorption peaks of PbI2 and PbI3− iodate species, respectively.21 The increased relative intensity of PbI3− in the PbI2–2% CsPbBr3 precursor suggests that more PbI2 was dissolved in the ionic form after adding CsPbBr3. However, we detected a decreased PbI3− intensity for the PbI2–5% CsPbBr3 one, which is probably due to the fact that extra CsPbBr3 can react with PbI3− through halogen exchange. This will be discussed in the later sections.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were employed to investigate the chemical interactions within the PbI2 films. As reported earlier, the SO stretching vibration peak of free DMSO is located at 1045 cm−1.41 In the as-deposited PbI2 film, the stretching vibration of SO shifts from 1045 to 1021 cm−1 due to van der interactions between SO and Pb2+.23 As shown in Fig. 2b, FTIR spectra of all samples contain the 1021 cm−1 peak, indicating the interaction between PbI2 and DMSO. Besides, there is a new peak observed at 1107 cm−1 for PbI2–5% CsPbBr3. This is attributed to the coordination of DMSO to CsPbBr3via the S end. Zhou et al. reported that CsI can bond with the SO group via the sulfur end to form a PbI2–DMSO–CsI intermediate phase, which shifted the SO stretching vibration to a higher wavenumber at 1108 cm−1.23 In our case, we argue that CsPbBr3 could bond with the SO group via interaction between Cs and S, leading to the formation of the PbI2–DMSO–CsPbBr3 complex. As depicted in Fig. 2b and S1 (ESI†), the peak at 1107 cm−1 can be detected in the case of the PbI2 film as the CsPbBr3 doping ratio reaches 2% (weak but resolvable) and goes higher. The vibration peaks at 978 cm−1 and 933 cm−1 in Fig. 2b are assigned to CH3 rocking modes upon formation of the single-end coordinated adduct, that is, PbI2–DMSO or CsPbBr3–DMSO.42,43 Since CsPbBr3 could bond with the SO group via the interaction between Cs and S, more DMSO molecules are locked in the PbI2 film as the incorporated molar ratio of CsPbBr3 increases. Therefore, we observed a stronger peak at 933 cm−1 for PbI2–5% CsPbBr3 compared to the other samples in Fig. 2b.
The crystalline properties of the PbI2 films were further investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2c, a characteristic diffraction peak of the PbI2 phase at 12.7° is observed in all samples. We also observe enhanced peak intensity for the PbI2–DMSO–CsPbBr3 complex for PbI2–2% CsPbBr3, indicating that more DMSO molecules are locked in the PbI2 film. Moreover, the PbI2 peak gradually shifts to low diffraction angles as the molar ratio of CsPbBr3 increases from 1%, 2% to 3% (Fig. 2d), meaning an increased interlayer spacing. The formation of the PbI2–DMSO–CsPbBr3 intermediate phase is probably responsible for this result. As the molar ratio of CsPbBr3 further increases to 5%, the diffraction angle shifts back to a higher value, which is likely due to the fact that extra CsPbBr3 competes with PbI2 to take away the DMSO molecules. Thus, fewer DMSO molecules sitting in the gap will reduce the interlayer spacing. We believe that the CsPbBr3 lattices should be located at the edge of PbI2 grains (Fig. 1b) because only a slightly increased interlayer spacing is observed. Instead, if the CsPbBr3 lattices are inserted between the PbI2 layers, the shift of diffraction should be much more significant. These results support that incorporation of a small amount of CsPbBr3 into the PbI2 film can modify the chemical composition and crystallization state of the intermediate phase.
The surface morphology of PbI2 films w/o and with different molar ratios of CsPbBr3 was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the PbI2 films exhibit compact surface morphologies with gradually increased grain size as the molar ratio of CsPbBr3 increases from 1% to 3%. It is well recognized that the larger PbI2 grains will reduce perovskite nucleation sites and promote the growth of larger perovskite grains. Therefore, the photoelectric properties of perovskite will be improved due to the reduced grain boundaries and defect density. Besides, compared to the pristine PbI2 film with a random grain size distribution, we can observe a more uniform grain distribution for the sample with 2% CsPbBr3. However, many pinholes and nanorods are observed on the surface of the PbI2 film with 5% CsPbBr3. Previously, Wang et al.32 found a similar PbI2 film morphology with many pinholes and nanorods by adding CsPbI3 to the PbI2 precursor, and these nanorods were ascribed to the hexagonal δ-CsPbI3. In our case, the observed nanorods suggest that CsPbBr3 can react with PbI2 to form CsPbI3 and PbBr2 when the molar ratio of CsPbBr3 increases to 5%. These results, together with the UV-vis absorption, FTIR, and XRD results, further confirm that when the incorporation ratio of CsPbBr3 is low, it exists as CsPbBr3 lattices. However, when the incorporation ratio reaches 5%, rod-like δ-CsPbI3 will form through halogen exchange.
The effect of CsPbBr3 incorporation on the properties of perovskite films was investigated by XRD. As can be seen in Fig. 3a and S3a (ESI†), two peaks located at around 12.7° and 14.0° appear in all samples w/o and with CsPbBr3, corresponding to the residual PbI2 and α-FAPbI3 perovskite phase, respectively.27,37 A gradually increased diffraction intensity of the 14.0° peak is observed as the molar ratio of CsPbBr3 increases (Fig. S3b, ESI†), indicating improved perovskite crystallinity after CsPbBr3 incorporation. We also find that the CsPbBr3 incorporation can reduce the peak intensity of PbI2, indicating that there is lower PbI2 residue in the as-formed perovskite films. Previous reports have confirmed that a moderated PbI2 content remaining on the surface of the perovskite can deliver a high PCE for PSCs.44 These results indicate that the amount of PbI2 can be tuned by adjusting the ratio of CsPbBr3. After an initial device performance evaluation, we found that the PSCs based on the perovskite with 2% CsPbBr3 demonstrate the best performance. In this way, we will mainly discuss the properties of two perovskite compositions w/o and with 2% CsPbBr3 in the following section.
 Fig. 3  CsPbBr3 stabilizer improves the film quality of perovskite films. (a) XRD patterns (peaks marked with * and those marked with ∇ are assigned to PbI2 and ITO, respectively), (b) Tauc plot, (c) normalized PL, and (d) TRPL decay curves of perovskite films w/o and with CsPbBr3. PL mapping of the perovskite film (e) w/o and (f) with CsPbBr3. The excitation wavelength is 405 nm, and the collected emission wavelength is 750–850 nm. The scale bar indicates 50 μm. 
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurement was conducted to study the influence of CsPbBr3 incorporation on the optical properties of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), a blue shift of the absorption edge can be observed as the molar ratio of CsPbBr3 increases, indicating the gradually enlarged optical bandgap (Eg). Therefore, we conclude that CsPbBr3 has been incorporated into the final perovskite film because the incorporation of Cs+ and Br− with a smaller ionic radius can give rise to a lattice shrinkage. This lattice contraction, together with the entropy gains due to cation and halide doping, contributes to the stabilization of α-FAPbI3.26,27 The Eg values were derived to be 1.54 and 1.55 eV for the perovskite w/o and with 2% CsPbBr3 from the Tauc plot in Fig. 3b. The Eg values for perovskites with other ratios of CsPbBr3 are shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†). Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) results for perovskites w/o and with CsPbBr3, and the emission peak displays a gradual blue shift with the increase of the CsPbBr3 molar ratio. This is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra. As the absorption spectra display sharp onsets and the PL spectra exhibit singlet Gaussian peaks, the stabilizers are most probably uniformly distributed in the final perovskite films. Fig. 3c shows the normalized PL of perovskite w/o and with 2% CsPbBr3. Besides the blue shift, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL peak for the perovskite with 2% CsPbBr3 is narrower, and the peak is more symmetrical than that of the perovskite w/o CsPbBr3, indicating that the energy dispersion of the perovskite with 2% CsPbBr3 is reduced, and the film quality is improved.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was conducted to explore the photo-generated carrier lifetimes of all samples. The decay curves of perovskite samples w/o and with CsPbBr3 are shown in Fig. 3d and S6 (ESI†), and the fitting parameters are provided in Table S1 (ESI†). The decay curves were fitted with a bi-exponential function. The fast decay process (τ1) is related to the non-radiative recombination on the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite, and the slow decay process (τ2) is related to the non-radiative recombination of photo-generated free carriers in the bulk of the perovskite. The prolonged τ1 (61.3 ns) and τ2 (371.7 ns) of the perovskite film stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 compared with τ1 (17.8 ns) and τ2 (326.6 ns) of perovskite w/o CsPbBr3 should be attributed to the suppressed non-radiative recombination at the surface and in the bulk. We also mapped the PL intensity of perovskite films w/o and with CsPbBr3 in the range of 300 × 300 μm2 (Fig. 3e and f). The PL intensity of the perovskite film stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 is stronger than that w/o CsPbBr3 in the whole mapping range, indicating improved film quality. To quantitatively estimate the trap density in the perovskite films, we performed space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements on the electron-only device with the structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/(6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag. The dark I–V curves are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The trap density ntrap was calculated to be 8.79 × 1015 and 6.28 ×1015 cm−3 for the perovskite w/o and 2% CsPbBr3.
To examine the effect of CsPbBr3 incorporation on perovskite film morphology, SEM was conducted for perovskites w/o and with the CsPbBr3 stabilizer (Fig. 4a, b and S8, ESI†). White grains are assigned to residual PbI2 on the surface of the perovskite film. It can be observed that the amount of residual PbI2 decreases with the increment of CsPbBr3 content (from 0% to 3%). This is ascribed to the promoted FAI penetration due to the enlarged interlayer spacing of PbI2. The grain size of perovskite crystals increases gradually with the increment of the molar radio of CsPbBr3. The statistical distribution of grain size for perovskite w/o and with 2% CsPbBr3 is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). It can be seen that the average grain size of the perovskite with 2% CsPbBr3 (860 nm) is much larger than that of the perovskite w/o CsPbBr3 (520 nm). The increased grain size of perovskite crystals is likely related to the formation of the PbI2–CsPbBr3–DMSO intermediate phase, which reduces the nucleation sites of the perovskite and promotes the growth of larger perovskite grains. The perovskite-grain arrangement was further investigated by cross-sectional SEM. The device structure of PSCs is ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, compared to the randomly arranged perovskite grain of the device w/o CsPbBr3, the PSC with 2% CsPbBr3 exhibits vertically columnar grain alignment. This may contribute to improved charge transfer in the vertical direction. Cross-sectional SEM images of devices with other CsPbBr3 ratios, 1%, 3%, and 5%, are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The results show that a high incorporation ratio of CsPbBr3 results in an inferior perovskite-grain arrangement.

To investigate the effect of CsPbBr3 stabilizer on the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI3-based PSCs, current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured to determine the photovoltaic metrics. The representative J–V curves are presented in Fig. 4e and S11 (ESI†), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table S2 (ESI†) and the inset of Fig. 4e. It is seen that the open-circuit voltage (VOC) increases from 1.012 to 1.042, 1.075, 1.095, and 1.116 V for PSCs based on perovskites w/o and with 1%, 2%, 3%, and 5% CsPbBr3, respectively. This may arise from both the effect of suppressed non-radiative recombination and increased Eg after CsPbBr3 incorporation. On the contrary, the short-circuit current density (JSC) shows an opposite trend, which is mainly due to the decreased light-harvesting range as the Eg increases. Interestingly, the FF of PSCs with CsPbBr3 is much higher than that of w/o CsPbBr3, most likely due to the suppressed shunt recombination after stabilization with CsPbBr3. In particular, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4e, the device with 2% CsPbBr3 delivers the highest PCE of 21.39% while the device w/o CsPbBr3 gives an inferior PCE of 18.6%. As presented in Fig. 4f, the average PCE is enhanced from 18.95% for the device w/o CsPbBr3 to 21.13% for that with 2% CsPbBr3. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. S12, ESI†) were performed to determine the accuracy of the J–V test. As summarized in Table S3 (ESI†), the calculated JSC mismatch between J–V and IPCE for PSCs based on perovskites with different ratios of CsPbBr3 is within 2%. The statistics of solar cell metrics as a function of the relative amount of CsPbBr3 stabilizer is depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†), which confirms the reliability of the positive effect of CsPbBr3 stabilizer on the device performance.
To further improve the photovoltaic performance of the CsPbBr3-stabilized PSCs, we next optimized the stabilized devices with surface passivation and anti-reflective coating. The passivating molecule adopted here is naphthalene methylamine iodide (NMAI), which would contribute to VOC-loss reduction for PSCs. Improved PCEs were achieved for both devices w/o and with 2% CsPbBr3, and they deliver the highest PCE of 20.64% (with a VOC of 1.101 V, JSC of 24.93 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.20%) and 22.69% (with a VOC of 1.157 V, JSC of 24.79 mA cm−2, and FF of 79.11%), respectively (Fig. S14a, ESI†). The statistics of PCE, VOC, JSC and FF were compared in Fig. S14b–e (ESI†), which further confirms the reliability of the positive effect of the CsPbBr3 stabilizer on the device performance. As shown in Fig. 5a, we obtained a PCEreverse of 23.34% (with a VOC of 1.157 V, JSC of 25.66 mA cm−2, and FF of 78.62%) and a PCEforward of 22.60% (with a VOC of 1.148 V, JSC of 25.65 mA cm−2, and FF of 76.77%). The IPCE of the optimized device is shown in Fig. 5b, which gives a comparable integrated JSC (25.42 mA cm−2) with that extracted from the J–V curves (25.66 mA cm−2). The PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF statistic distribution of 23 devices are presented in Fig. 5c–f to demonstrate the repeatability of high-performance devices.

To better understand the mechanism why the CsPbBr3 stabilizer enhances the device performance, we performed characterization at the device level. From the Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. 6a), the built-in potential (Vbi) of the device w/o and with the 2% CsPbBr3 stabilizer was determined to be 0.77 and 0.89 V, respectively. It is recognized that higher Vbi facilitates the separation of carriers and mitigates the accumulation of charges. To further investigate the charge separation and recombination within the devices, we measured the dependence of JSC and VOC on the incident light intensity. A linear relation of JSC in the log scale versus light intensity in the log scale is observed and the slope of both curves was determined to be 0.99 (Fig. S15, ESI†), implying negligible bimolecular recombination in both devices at the short circuit. From the relation of VOCversus light intensity in the log scale (Fig. 6b), the slopes were calculated to be 1.98 kBT/q and 1.48 kBT/q for the device w/o and with the 2% CsPbBr3 stabilizer, respectively. It is known that the deviation of the slope from kBT/q is related to trap-assisted recombination, and the reduced slope deviation of the device stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 reflects suppressed trap-assisted recombination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Fig. S16, ESI†) also shows that the device stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 displays a larger recombination resistance, indicating reduced trap-mediated recombination. Transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) decay measurements were further employed to confirm the improved carrier transport. As shown in Fig. 6c, the charge transfer time (τt) is decreased from 5.12 μs for the device w/o CsPbBr3 to 4.27 μs for that stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3, implying improved carrier extraction in the stabilized device. Meanwhile, the recombination time (τr) increases substantially from 0.445 to 0.686 ms (Fig. 6d), which suggests a much-reduced recombination rate. We also compared the photovoltaic performance of PSCs stabilized with the perovskite-type stabilizer (CsPbBr3), one precursor-type stabilizers (CsI, PbBr2, or CsBr), and double precursor-type stabilizers (PbBr2 + CsBr). As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI†), the PSCs stabilized with CsPbBr3 deliver the best performance, indicating that the perovskite-type stabilizers perform better than the precursor-type stabilizers.

(c) Normalized transient photocurrent and (d) normalized transient photovoltage decay curves. The charge transport (τt) and recombination time (τr) are defined as the time interval during which the photocurrent or photovoltage decays to 1/e of its initial value immediately after excitation. 
Stability is another critical factor for high-performance PSCs. Thermal stability of the perovskite film and long-term operational stability of the device w/o CsPbBr3 and stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 were studied. To avoid the influence of NMAI passivation on stability, both perovskite films and device samples were prepared without NMAI passivation. The thermal stress test was performed by heating the perovskites w/o and with 2% CsPbBr3 at 150 °C for 30 min in a N2-filled glove box. From the XRD patterns (Fig. 7a and b), we observe that the peak intensity of PbI2 is stronger than the (001) plane of the perovskite for the sample w/o CsPbBr3 after heating, whereas the peak intensity of PbI2 is still weaker than the (001) plane of the perovskite for the sample with 2% CsPbBr3 under the same heating conditions, suggesting improved thermal stability for the CsPbBr3-stabilized perovskite film. This is most likely because perovskite lattice contraction after CsPbBr3 stabilization mitigates the loss of the organic cation and the byproduct-free intermediate enables more stable target perovskite films. The short-term operational stability of PSCs is evaluated by monitoring the power output under MPP conditions under an AM 1.5G solar simulator. As shown in Fig. 7c, the devices stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 exhibit better light stability under a constant voltage test under one sun illumination. Long-term operational stability of PSCs w/o CsPbBr3 and stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 was monitored under MPP conditions under a white LED with an illumination power of 100 mW cm−2 in a N2-filled glove box. J–V curves were measured every one hour to determine the photovoltaic metrics of PSCs. Between two scans, the devices were controlled under MPP conditions for operation. The long-term operational stability results are shown in Fig. 7d. The PCE of devices w/o CsPbBr3 dropped rapidly, reaching 80% of its initial PCE after 75 h of operation. However, the devices stabilized with 2% CsPbBr3 display a robust PCE, retaining over 80% of the initial PCE after 1153 h. These results indicate that the operational stability of the PSCs has been significantly enhanced after the incorporation of the CsPbBr3 stabilizer. Table S4 (ESI†) compares the efficiency and stability of PSCs reported in this work with the representative FAPbI3-based PSCs stabilized with other types of additives. We can see that the Cs-containing perovskite-type stabilizer reported in this work enables PSCs that simultaneously possess high-efficiency and robust operational stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a novel approach by using a perovskite-type stabilizer (CsPbBr3) to fabricate low Cs/Br-containing quasi-pure FAPbI3-based PSCs. It is found that the PbI2-DMSO–CsPbBr3 intermediate phase was formed in the PbI2 film to promote the growth of the perovskite crystal with an enlarged grain size. The incorporation of Cs+ and Br− into the perovskite lattice improved the stability of the perovskite film by retarding the loss of the organic cation to form PbI2. After optimization, we obtained a PCE as high as 23.34%. The long-term operational stability can be remarkably improved by the CsPbBr3 stabilizer. This work provides an effective method to fabricate stabilized quasi-pure α-FAPbI3 with high optoelectric quality and demonstrates that the combination of high-bulk-quality perovskite and surface passivation is an effective strategy to enhance the PCE and stability of PSCs.
