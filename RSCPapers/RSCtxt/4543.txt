    , Accepted 30th November 2017First published on 30th November 2017AbstractThis paper describes the implementation of robust and modular sensitizers containing aromatic–amphiphilic ligands to provide new insights into the relationship between the molecular structure and electron injection process governing the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The significance of this work lies in the combination of favorable experimental and theoretical results in a new class of Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes with the molecular formula of [Ru(E101)(Dicnq)x(Y)] which is named M101–M104 when X = 1 and Y = bpy, X = 1 and Y = phen, X = 2, and X = 1 and Y = 2 NCS, respectively. E101 and Dicnq ligands are 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6 heptan ammin and 6,7-dicyanodipyrido[2,2-d:2′,3′-f]quinoxaline, respectively. The good agreement between the experimental and the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)-calculated absorption spectra of the M101–104 sensitizers allowed us to provide a detailed assignment of the main spectral features of the investigated dyes. M102 which contained phen as an ancillary ligand had the best photovoltaic performance which can be attributed to the higher light harvesting of M102 in the visible light region. A DSSC based on complex M102 without the E101 ligand did not show any observable power conversion efficiency (PCE), indicating the importance of the amphiphilic ligand, E101. Transient absorption studies indicated that the ratio of kreg/krec (krec = the rate constant of the recombination of the dye and kreg = the rate constant of regeneration in the presence of the electrolyte) for M101–104 is 1.1, 2.9, 1.3, and 1.2, clearly confirming a weak competition between dye regeneration and recombination. Therefore, because this ratio for M101, 103, and 104 is small, kreg ≈ krec, the operation of the device has been limited by back electron transports, subsequently enhancing the recombination process. However, the rate of recombination is relatively normal for an efficient DSSC, while the rate of regeneration is very low. Subsequently, the PCE will be poor, confirming the role of aliphatic chains in reducing the recombination process. To obtain a deeper insight into the charge transfer process in the investigated devices, ab initio DFT molecular dynamics simulations and quantum dynamics of electronic relaxation were carried out, clearly showing that the interfacial electron transfer (IET) time scale particularly depends on the type of ancillary ligand. The IET results substantially proved that M102 has the fast lifetime of 2.3 ps and 90 fs for the LUMO and LUMO+1, respectively, indicating the experimentally higher PCE of M102 compared to the other three investigated sensitizers.
1. Introduction
Among the components of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), the ancillary ligand represents outstanding multifunctional photophysical and photochemical abilities and is therefore crucial in determining the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE).1 The use of ancillary ligands having amphiphilic chains and/or a π-extended aromatic unit permits the inhibition of the charge recombination process and collection of a large fraction of sunlight.
The most common modification in the design of a sensitizer for DSSCs involves the appropriate choice of an ancillary ligand through the tuning of the ground and excited-state properties for achieving better light harvesting. In this regard, several approaches have been successfully reported for enhancing the light harvesting abilities of ancillary ligands2 such as the incorporation of the C^N ancillary ligand to construct a ruthenium cyclometalated sensitizer.3–6 Some other approaches include: the extension of π-conjugation through the incorporation of aromatic rings into different positions of ancillary ligands for improving the molar extinction coefficient (ε) along with the red shift of the absorption spectrum; introducing electron donating/accepting groups in the ancillary ligand for effectively matching the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dye with the redox potential of 3I−/I3− and the lower limit of the conduction band in TiO2;7 using amphiphilic long chains which lead to a slow recombination process by preventing the water-induced desorption of the dye from the TiO2 surface;8 and suppressing molecular aggregation on the surface.9–16 All these factors are presumed to improve the overall performance of DSSCs through ancillary ligand substitutions.
As a remarkable report on the role of amphiphilic ancillary ligands in DSSCs, an interesting amphiphilic polypyridyl ruthenium dye, Z907, in combination with a photochemically stable fluorine polymer and poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) to solidify a 3-methoxypropionitrile-based liquid electrolyte was synthesized and investigated in order to obtain a quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte.17 The DSSC based on this conjugated system in full sunlight (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) showed a conversion efficiency of over 6% and resulted in extraordinarily stable cell performance under both thermal stress at 80 °C and soaking with light. In addition, after 1000 h of light-soaking at 55 °C, the cells covered with an ultraviolet-absorbing polymer film retained 94% of their initial performance. After this exciting report, an exponential growth was observed in studies and publications dealing with the modification of ancillary ligands based on amphiphilic and aromatic moieties in DSSCs.18,19
We presented a new design concept for ruthenium sensitizers and reported a detailed study of DSSCs based on amphiphilic-substituted phenanthroline ligands for the first time. The careful selection of both aliphatic and aromatic moieties on ancillary ligands eventually led to the improvement of photovoltaic performances. The selection of a suitable anchoring group is the second approach for improving the efficiency of DSSCs.
Among the different mechanisms of assembling the dye onto a metal oxide substrate surface including covalent attachment, electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, van der Waals forces, or physical entrapment, DSSCs almost exclusively employ covalent bonding between the dyes and the TiO2 surface atoms in order to ensure strong coupling, a homogeneous dye distribution, and device stability. In contrast, other interactions usually involve weaker bonds and accordingly render adsorption quasi-reversible and unstable.1,20
Historically, the most frequently used anchors in DSSCs are carboxylic acid and cyanoacrylic acid groups.21–27 However, dyes with COOH as the anchor unit will dissociate on the TiO2 surface at long irradiation times.27 Thus, it is pivotal to increase the binding strength of the anchor unit. It is known that the metal center forms strong chelating bonds with the heterocyclic ligand.
Because of the recent exponential growth of DSSC research, many new anchors have also emerged and been tested. This trend has significantly increased the choice of available materials and facilitated the understanding of DSSCs.
Recently, pyridine,28 phosphinic acid,29 and 8-hydroxylquinoline27 have been investigated as anchoring groups. Nevertheless, the efficiencies of DSSCs based on these acceptors still lag behind those of cyanoacrylic acid counterparts. The bottleneck of this effort lies in either the low electron-injection efficiency or the limited broadening of absorption spectra.
In this study, we employed the cyanide group as the anchoring group as it had received considerable attention in recent studies.
Tetracyanate anchors have been included in several organic dyes and have demonstrated their capacity to sensitize TiO2 surfaces.30 However, the PCE of the devices is usually low (<0.25%). Apart from its coordination capacity, the tetracyanate group is a strong electron acceptor and has shown good performance in the presence of additional anchors such as rhodanines and carboxylic acids.31
The important features of these chromophores include intramolecular charge-transfer interactions, potent redox activities, and nonplanar molecular arrangements. The last feature is expected to contribute to the suppression of dye aggregation in DSSCs. In addition, the chromophores do not possess any carboxylic acid groups.30
This result suggests the possibility that cyanated derivatives can efficiently adsorb onto TiO2. It is interesting to examine if this is also true for the geminal dicyanated compounds in the present research.
These classes of Ru polypyridyl complexes have gained interest due to their more favorable light harvesting abilities and long-term thermal and chemical stability compared to other conventional sensitizers for the feasible large-scale commercialization of DSSCs. Therefore, the main idea is to inspire readers to explore new avenues in the design of new sensitizers for DSSCs based on different ancillary and anchoring ligand substitutions.
2. The experiment
2.1 Materials and instrument
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from Merck and Aldrich and used without further purification. IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer 597 spectrometer. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 250 MHz spectrometer. Molecular and electronic structure calculations were performed based on density functional theory (DFT) using the Gaussian 03 (G03) program package. The B3LYP functional was carried out with the LANL2DZ basis set. All geometry optimizations were performed in either C1 or C2 symmetry with subsequent frequency analysis to show that the structures are at the local minima on the potential energy surface. In addition, our calculations were performed in the DMF solvent. The electronic orbitals were visualized using Gauss View 3.0 software. The PLQY (PL quantum yields) were calculated by comparison with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in degassed CH3CN solution at room temperature as a standard (Φstd = 0.0952) using the following well-known equation:  where Φunk is the PL quantum yield of ruthenium complexes; Iunk and Istd are the integrated areas of the corrected PL spectra of the ruthenium complexes and standard, respectively; Aunk and Astd are the absorbance of the ruthenium complexes and standard at the excitation wavelength (λexc = 405 nm). respectively; and ηunk and ηstd are the indices of refraction of the respective solvents (taken to be equal to those of the neat solvents in both cases).
2.2 Computational studies
The choice of the basis set is a crucial step for DFT and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. DFT/B3LYP method was extremely used for theoretical studies of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes. DFT calculations with the B3LYP functional and LanL2DZ basis set are able to predict the structures of these complexes quite reasonably.32 All calculations were done with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for the lighter elements (Cl, O, N, C and H). For the transition metal (ruthenium), the effective core potential basis set LANL2DZ (Los Alamos ECP plus double-zeta) was used for the valence electrons and the core electrons were treated with the LANL2DZ effective core potential. After geometry optimization, a TDDFT calculation was performed to assign the transient absorption spectra of M101–M104 with the B3-LYP/6-31G(d,p) + LANL2DZ level using an explicit polarizable continuum model (PCM) for solvent. The model system was initially defined according to the unrelaxed anatase nanostructure. The semiconductor nanostructure was composed of 64 TiO2 units, with angles and bond lengths defined according to available references.33 The geometry of the nanostructure was optimized with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP/VAMP), implementing DFT to treat the Hartree and exchange–correlation electronic interactions. The Perdew–Wang34 generalized gradient approximation was implemented for the exchange–correlation functional in conjunction with ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudo-potentials35 to describe the ionic interactions. The Kohn–Sham (KS) Hamiltonian was projected onto a plane-wave basis set and high-efficiency iterative methods were implemented to obtain the KS eigenstates and eigenvalues. Self-consistency was accelerated by means of efficient charge density mixing schemes.
IET software was obtained from Batista Group and run considering the conditions reported in the literature.36 Computing the time-dependent wave function |Ψ(t)〉 = ∑iBi(t)|χi〉, expanded in the basis set of AOs |χi〉, required the propagation of expansion coefficients Bi(t)∑qQiqCqexp[−(i/ħ)Eqt], where Cq is the expansion coefficient of the initial state |Ψ(0)〉 = ∑qCq|q〉.
2.3 Synthesis of ligands and complexes

2.3.1. E101 and Dicnq ligands. 
Two ligands of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6 heptan ammin (E101) and 6,7-dicyanodipyrido[2,2-d:2′,3′-f] quinoxaline (Dicnq) were synthesized according to Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  The chemical process of the synthesis of E01 and Dicnq ligands. 
The phendione ligand was synthesised according to the literature with a high-yield product (85%).37 For the synthesis of E101, 0.15 mL (2 mmol) 1-heptan amine was added to 0.21 g (1 mmol) phendione in 50 mL absolute ethanol, and stirred under reflux conditions and a N2 atmosphere for 1 h. The colour of the solution turned from yellow to violet, while the yellow precipitate appeared. After the reaction was complete, the mixture was centrifuged and the yellow sediments were separated. The solid products were washed with ethanol and water three times to remove un-reacted free ligands. For the synthesis of Dicnq, the mixture of 0.210 g (1 mmol) phendione and 0.162 g (1.5 mmol) Dicnq was dissolved in 50 mL absolute ethanol and subsequently refluxed under stirring and a N2 atmosphere for 1 h. After that, the volume of the solution was reduced to about 5 mL by vacuum evaporation. Immediately, the concentrated solution was placed in a refrigerator until dark-yellow crystals were formed. After the separation of solids by filter paper, washing with ethanol and water was done three times. The purity of two products was determined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) which clearly showed only one trace of a product with a high yield.

After this, the precipitated solid was collected and washed with ethanol and considered as a precursor for the next substitution. To synthesize [Ru(bpy)(E101)Cl2], 0.1 g (1 mmol) of the solids collected in the previous step was dissolved in 15 mL warm 2-propanol and added to 0.11 g (1.1 mmol) E101 in 15 mL warm 2-propanol, refluxing under a N2 atmosphere for 3 h. Afterwards, 0.084 g (1.1 mmol) Dicnq in 5 mL 2-propane was added to the solution and subsequently the same condition was continued for another 3 h. Finally, an aqueous saturated solution of NaBF4 (5 mmol) was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for 1 h.

2.5. Fabrication of DSSCs

2.5.1 Fabrication of porous-TiO2 electrodes. 
To prepare the DSSC working electrodes, the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass plate used as the current collector was first cleaned with a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min and was then rinsed with water and ethanol. Afterwards, the TCO glass plates were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A layer of TiCl4 was coated on the TCO glass plates by screen-printing and kept in a clean box for 3 min so that the layer could relax in order to reduce surface irregularities. The plates were then dried for 6 min at 125 °C. After drying the films at 125 °C, the mesoscopic TiO2 films used as photoanodes consisted of layers of TiO2 (a 13 μm thick transparent layer (6 + 4 + 3 μm in thickness) of 25 nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles and a 10 μm thick scattering layer of 400 nm anatase TiO2 particles). The multi-layer films were heated to 520 °C and sintered for 30 min, then cooled to ∼80 °C and immersed in the dye solution at room temperature for 16 h.


2.5.2 Preparation of counter Pt-electrodes. 
To prepare the counter electrode, the TCO sheet was washed with H2O and 0.1 M HCl solution in ethanol and cleaned by ultrasound in an acetone bath for 10 min. After removing the residual organic contaminants by heating in air for 15 min at 400 °C, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the TCO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg of Pt in 1 mL of ethanol) while repeating the heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min.


2.5.3 DSSC assemblage. 
The dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich-type cell. Two clips were used to hold the two electrodes together at the corner of the plates. The electrolyte was injected into the space between the two electrodes.

3. Results and discussion
This section is organized as follows: first, in sections 3.1 and 3.2, we outline the fundamental properties of the molecular structure and photophysical properties of compounds, promising an efficient sensitizer for use in DSSCs. In section 3.3, we present the results followed by comparative experimental studies of DFT and TD DFT to investigate the electronic structure of the excited states of sensitizers. Results and discussions of the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on all four examined complexes are presented in section 3.4. The charge career dynamic studies including transient absorption microscopy and time resolved photoluminescence decay are explained in section 3.5. Finally, the details of the interfacial electron transfer simulation (IETs) are discussed in section 3.6.
3.1 An introduction to the reasonable aspects of the design of complexes
The logic of designing the molecular structure of complexes is rationally based on three functions: (i) the incorporation of ligand E101 which contains an aliphatic carbon chain and reduces the aggregation phenomena; (ii) the presence of an ancillary ligand including bpy, phen, and NSC in order to enhance light harvesting abilities; and (iii) the introduction of Dicnq as an anchoring ligand with the CN group which coordinately links onto the semiconductor surface. All three parts cooperatively contribute to enhance electron regeneration and reduce charge recombination. Two remarkable novelties in the design of molecules can be observed: (i) the attachment of aliphatic carbon chains through the nitrogen atom to the phen moiety, and (ii) the attachment of the CN group to the phen quinoxaline moiety. In a certain sense, both anchoring and ancillary ligands meticulously designed based on phen indicate the versatile substitution of the phen ligand. The above explanations are represented in Fig. 2 as well as the optimization of the molecule.
 Fig. 2  (a) The molecular structures of the investigated complexes named M101–104. The three parts of complexes including ancillary, anchoring, and amphiphilic ligands as well as the type of ancillary ligand are highlighted. (b) The optimized structure of the sensitizer produced from the DFT calculation. 
Moreover, the microanalysis including elemental analysis (CHN) and ESI-Mass was carried out to determine the structure of complexes.

1HNMR and FT-IR are very useful tools to characterize the structure of complexes containing functional groups which show unique spectroscopic evidence. The coordination of E101 and dicnq to ruthenium in M101–M104 was clearly affirmed by 1H NMR spectra via the assignment of their peaks to aliphatic (0.9–2.0 ppm) and aromatic (7.5–10 ppm) regions, respectively.38 Regarding the heptan amine ligand as an important part of E101, five methylene groups of 2-CH2 to 6-CH2 and the terminal methyl group appeared as distinct resonances at 1.42, 1.53, 1.58, 168, and 0.92 ppm, respectively. In the FT-IR study, the obvious sharp signal in the wavenumber of approximately 2200 cm−1 can be attributed to the CN group of the quinoxaline moiety, indicating the presence of Dicnq in the structure of complexes.39 FT-IR spectra along with the assignment of finger-print regions are illustrated in ESI Fig. S1.†
3.2 UV-Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy
The UV-vis of complexes was experimentally investigated in the dimethylformamide (DMF) solution (Fig. 3) and subsequently the nature of every excitation was confirmed by TD DFT studies. In the UV-Vis spectra of complexes, two regions appeared: (i) the sharp band in the region of the wavelength of 300–350 nm which can be attributed to the intra-ligand charge transfer, ILCT (π → π*) of aromatic moieties, and (ii) the broad band in the region of 450–600 nm which differs by the substitution of an ancillary ligand. The origin of the higher wavelength transition can be attributed to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) from the filled t2g of Ru2+ to the empty orbitals of ligand's π*.40 The zoomed region was introduced from visible to near-infra-red regions where the lightest harvesting would occur. The molar extinction coefficients (ε) at the maximum wavelength of MLCT were estimated to be about 12150, 14375, 8720, and 11900 cm−1 M−1 for M101–104, respectively, indicating that M102 showed a higher ε than the benchmark emitters such as N3 with the ε of ≈13550 cm−1 M−1 under the same condition. However, it should be kept in mind that the maximum wavelength of MLCT of N3 occurs at approximately 540 nm which is significantly red shifted about 80 nm compared to M102, resulting in the more efficient N3 compared to M102 and others. According to this ordering, when a bidentate ancillary ligand in M101–M103 was replaced by two NCS ligands, the lower symmetry of the complex compromised the degeneracy of MLCT transitions, leading to a broader absorption band.41 This remarkable change originated from the fact that the electron density of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is mainly located on the NCS group, resulting in the instability of the HOMO and, subsequently, a bathochromic shift in the MLC band.42

Right: PL spectra of M101–104 in acetonitrile at room temperature (10−5 M). The highlight of experimental UV-Vis spectra shows the active area of light harvesting in DSSCs. 
The photoluminescence (PL) experiment was carried out in the acetonitrile solution with the excitation of 405 nm (Fig. 3). All four complexes demonstrated a broad band centred at 612, 632, 601, and 616 nm for M101–104, respectively, indicating MLCT which was extensively reported in homologue ruthenium polypyridyl complexes.43 The tuning of the PL wavelength of complexes also indicated the influence of ancillary ligand substitution (ESI Fig. S2†). PL quantum yields (PLQY) were calculated by comparison with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in degassed CH3CN solution at room temperature as a standard (Φstd = 0.095), resulting in the PLQY of 0.048, 0.051, 0.054, and 0.031 for M101–104, respectively.44
3.3 DFT and TD-DFT studies
To achieve a deeper insight into the band absorption assignment, we carried out conventional TD-DFT calculations (singlet–singlet states only contributing to absorption) on the examined complexes. The results confirmed the general assignment of low-energy features to MLCT and higher energy ones to ILCT excitation (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The full data set of the optimized molecular structure is given in ESI S3.† As shown in TD DFT results, the most contribution of the transition of the lowest energy of the MLCT absorption band took place from the HOMO to the LUMO, nearly 70%. Interestingly, higher energy bands of all the studied complexes mainly originated from the HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 to the LUMO+1 and +2. The data are summarized in Table 1. The origin of ILCT bands was largely based on lower HOMO (HOMO−1 and −2) to higher LUMO (LUMO+3). The DFT calculation clearly showed that the density of electron in the HOMO mainly located on the ancillary ligand and metal center. Nevertheless, the density of electron in the LUMO was delocalized on the Dicnq moiety. The DFT calculation clearly pointed out that the isosurface of HOMOs and LUMOs of all complexes showed that there is no density of electron on the aliphatic chain ligand, E101. Considering these two results, we concluded the major influence of the aromatic ancillary ligand on electron density distribution on molecules that contained both aromatic and aliphatic ligands.

It is necessary to note that, for an ideal electron transfer in a DSSC, the electron density of electron in the HOMO must be delocalized in the metal and ancillary ligand (donor moiety), while the electron density of electron in the LUMO must be delocalized in the anchoring group (acceptor moiety), confirming the best condition for electron transfer from the LUMO of a sensitizer to the conduction band of a semicounductor.45 As clearly seen in Fig. 5, the above-mentioned condition for an ideal electron transfer prevails for all four investigated complexes, M101–104.

3.4 Photovoltaic characterization
To determine the role of the ancillary ligand in its photovoltaic performance, the DSSCs based on the examined complexes were fabricated as explained in section 2.5. It is very important to note that our purpose was not to find a champion sensitizer to record a high power conversion efficiency (PCE), although the establishment of the employed strategies mentioned here certainly promises the design of sensitizers which can show a high PCE.
As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, the I–V results indicated that M102 which contains phen as the ancillary ligand has the best performance among all four complexes, followed by M103 which has two Dicnqs and M104 and M101 showing the lowest PCE. As one E101 and one Dicnq in all four complexes were unchanged and only the ancillary ligand was altered, we are able to correlate the nature of the ancillary ligand with its photovoltaic performance. It is noteworthy that, in a separate test, M102 without the presence of E101 in its structure had a very weak performance, indicating the importance of the presence of the aliphatic chain ligand, E101. These results can be interpreted as follows: (1) in comparing with the two ancillary ligands, the phen showed more efficiency than bpy; (2) NCS groups would be effective only when at least one aromatic ancillary ligand is also located in the molecular structure; (3) Dicnq can act as a both ancillary and anchoring ligand. However, because of the presence of CN as the electron withdrawing group, the influence of its ancillary role is weak.

To find the origin of and the reason for the noted proposals, we first focused on UV-Vis spectra, resulting in the light harvesting properties of complexes. According to Fig. 2, the highest absorption intensity (molar extinction coefficient) belonged to M102 which was also shown by the broadening of the absorption band in the MLCT region. In order to confirm the light harvesting properties of complexes and its correlation with the type of ancillary ligand, incident photon to current conversion (IPCE) was carried out (Fig. 7). IPCE results also confirmed the I–V results, i.e. M102 had the highest IPCE value of about 29%, indicating the highest light harvesting abilities (Table 2).
 Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of DSSCs based on M101–104. 
The FT-IR empirical method involving the identification of vibrational frequencies surrounding the anchoring groups is widely accepted in the scientific literature.46 The FT-IR spectra of dyes (M101–104) adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticles indicated the formation of coordinate bonds between the CN group of Dicnq and the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface. To confirm this inference, the FT-IR spectra of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2-coated glass slides were recorded. Fig. 8 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of the individual dyes (M101–M104) adsorbed on TiO2 films. When a dye-based CN anchoring group, M101–104, was coordinated to the TiO2 surface, two distinguished characteristic bands in the FT-IR spectra can be recognized: one, a broad band in the region of 400–600 cm−1 which can be attributed to the vibration mode of the Ti–O bond and, later, the disappearance of the vibration of the CN bond at the wavenumber of 2200 cm−1, confirming the attachment of the cyanide group to the surface.47 However, it was reported that the cyano-based compound containing organic dyes demonstrated the capacity to sensitize TiO2 surfaces48–50via the formation of a surface complex through the nucleophilic reaction of the cyano group with superficial hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface. Thus, the interfacial charge transfer transition was enhanced by the generation of a negatively charged CN adsorbate.51

3.5 Charge career dynamic studies

3.5.1. Transient absorption microscopy. 
Transient absorption microscopy was employed to investigate the kinetics of dye regeneration (kreg) by the electrolyte and the kinetics of the recombination (krec) of photoinjected electrons in the semiconductor with the oxidized dye in the absence of the electrolyte.52 The device operation of a DSSC directly depends on the competition between kreg and krec. In the normal condition, the kinetics of recombination is much slower than that of regeneration, kreg ≫ krec, resulting in the charge recombination between oxidized dyes, and the charge-injected electrons are not an important loss for limiting device efficiency.53 The decay upon the induced light absorption was monitored by laser excitation of dye M101–M104-sensitized TiO2, in the presence and absence of the electrolyte (Fig. 9), with the lifetime and constant rate summarized in Table 3. For all four samples, there is a weak competition between kreg and krec. However, the decay data clearly showed that the regeneration of dye M10 by reduction by the electrolyte (k = 0.233 ms) is almost threefold (2.9) faster than by recombination with TiO2 photoinjected electrons (k = 0.0.080). This competition between kreg and krec (kreg/krec) for M101, M103, and M104 is about 1.1, 1.3, and 1.2, respectively. These results indicate that M101, M103, and M104 show kreg ≈ krec, confirming that the back electron transfer reaction and recombination process limit the PCE of devices. However, in an useful comparison, the half time of regeneration and recombination of the champion sensitizer named N719, cis-bis(thisionato)bis(2,2-bipyridine-4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) (di-tert-butylammonium salt), is about 1 μs and 1 ms, respectively, confirming the fact that the order of the τreg of the investigated dyes is in the range of N719, while τreg is much slower than that of N719.54 This relatively faster recombination can be attributed to aliphatic chains in the ancillary ligand (E101) which are absent in N719.

3.5.2. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay. 
To probe the effect of the ancillary ligand on the charge carrier dynamics, the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique was employed. Fig. 10 presents the photoluminescence decay kinetics (PLDK) measured at λmax upon excitation at 408 nm. Solid lines are the fits obtained after using the bi-exponential decay model with details given in the inset. Note that the extension of the lifetime of the sensitizer significantly influenced the lowering of the recombination process, subsequently enhancing the power conversion efficiency. Using the bi-exponential decay model, the PL decay results indicated that M102 showed a longer lifetime (τ2 = 411.44 ± 31.37 ns) than the other three complexes. This extremely long lifetime is among the best values for ruthenium polypyridyl complexes which routinely show lifetimes in the range of 1–100 ns.55 As given in the inset of Fig. 10, the value of the lifetime (τ2) of dyes was estimated to be in the range of 350–450 nm with the order of M102 (411.44 ± 31.37 ns) > M103 (399.172 ± 19.73 ns) > M104 (386.47 ± 16.17 ns) > M101 (350.41 ± 9.83 ns). Also, these results corroborate the photovoltaic performance and transient absorption microscopy result discussed previously.

3.6 Interfacial electron transfer simulation (IETs)
In addition to the experimental tools for determining the different attachment modes of an anchoring group of a dye to a semiconductor, theoretical efforts such as DFT calculations have extensively been employed to study the interface phenomena in DSSCs. Among the powerful simulation software programs for estimating interfacial electron transfer in the dye/TiO2-anatase surface, ab initio DFT molecular dynamics simulations and quantum dynamics of electronic relaxation have widely been used.56 In summary, the process of sensitization in DSSCs starts via light absorbance by the dye attached onto the TiO2 surface, allowing to excite the electron from the steady state of the dye to its excited state. After that, the generated charge goes to the conduction band of TiO2 and, therefore, currents in the external circuit.57 The zoomed region of IET studies conceptualized the rate of electron transfer from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor, identified as the formation of a complex of an excited dye with a small size of the TiO2 cluster (TiO2)n (n is generally <80). This small cluster size is sufficient for optoelectronic property calculations on TiO2 and dye/TiO2 nanocomposites for DSSC applications.58 The IET simulations were performed using the supercell M101–104-TiO2 with lattice vectors which are given in Fig. 11. The efficient electron transfer in the dye/TiO2 surface strongly depends on the matching between the energy level of the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2 which is precisely pointed out by the density of states (DOS).57 The electronic coupling strength indicates that the photoinduced charge transfer has effectively occurred. DOS figures clearly depict the quantity of overlapping of the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2. As shown in Fig. 12, all four dyes consist of a number of LUMOs which have shown a good overlap degree with the conduction band of TiO2. Therefore, we concluded that the attachment of the CN anchor group onto the TiO2 surface is possible and electron transfer happens subsequently. In what follows, we address the quantities of the rate of interfacial electron transfer and the population of LUMOs along with time.

Fig. 13 depicts the snapshots of the first 1 fs of the time-evolved electron density after instantaneous photoexcitation of the functionalized nanocrystal to M102 LUMO+1 (see ESI Fig. S4–S6† for M101, M103 and M104). Similar to the LUMO+1 dynamics, the electron injected from the LUMO state is distributed to all Ti ions in the cluster in the ps time scale.
 Fig. 13  Snapshots of the electronic charge distribution at 1 fs after initiating the IET from M102 attached to a pristine (101) surface. Only the local TiO2 structure, next to the photoexcited adsorbate, is illustrated for the detailed view of the time-dependent charge distribution. 
The evolution of time-dependent charge distribution during early-time relaxation dynamics after instantaneously populating all four dyes was also studied. After fitting the survival probability over time with the bi-exponential decay, we calculated the lifetime of charge carriers from the sensitizer to the semiconductor. This exponential fitting describes the probability that the photo-excited electron remains in the adsorbate molecule at time τ after the photo-excitation of the system. The shorter the lifetime of an electron injection in the dye–TiO2 surface, the faster the electron injection rate, resulting in a higher PCE. The values of the lifetimes of electron injection from the LUMO and LUMO+1 of M101–104 to the conduction band of TiO2 are summarized in Table 4. As stated in TD DFT explanation, the MLCT of M101–104 mainly originated from the LUMO and LUMO+1, demonstrating the fact that the fastest IET rate ∼2 ps is observed for the LUMO orbital of M102. The fastest IET rate of the LUMO+1 orbitals is investigated for M104 with the τ of 70 fs. Nevertheless, the average value of the lifetimes of the LUMO (τ1 = 2.0 ps) and the LUMO+1 (τ1 = 1.0 fs and τ2 = 90.0 fs) of M102 is the shortest among those of all four sensitizers (Fig. 14 and ESI Fig. S7–S9†). This evidence confirms the higher PCE of M102 than the other three sensitizers, indicating a higher regeneration process and a lower recombination process.

Each curve represents the probability of the electron to remain in the respective photoexcited surface complex. The estimated lifetime of the LUMO–LUMO+3 of M102 is obtained from the fitting of the survival probability with the bi-exponential decay model.

Finally, it is important to compare the results reported in this paper with the results of another sensitizer, i.e. TiO2. In a pioneer study, Batista indicated that the rate of IET transfer from the LUMO orbital of catechol to TiO2 at room temperature is ∼τ = 6 fs.59 However, IETs on the catechol anchoring group which substituted terpy ([MnII(H2O)3(catecholterpy)]2+/TiO2(terpy)2,2′:6,2′′-terpyridine) indicated a typical electron injection rate in the range of 50–100 fs.60 In an interesting report, Hirendra Nath Ghosh et al. have synthesized Ru(II)- and Os(II)-polypyridyl with pendent acetylacetone (acac) functionality, in which time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopic studies in the femtosecond time domain have been carried out. The electron injection process can be found to be fitted with two time constants: a pulse width limited <120 fs component and a slower 1.2–1.4 ps component. Results of such studies reveal that the electron injection rates from the metal complex based LUMO to the conduction band of TiO2 are faster than one would expect for the analogous complex in which the chromophoric core and the anchoring moiety are separated with multiple saturated C–C linkages.61
In light of IETs investigations into the acetyl acetonate anchoring group, the charge injection rate from the LUMO of 4-acac-coumarin molecule to the TiO2 surface was estimated to be about 15 fs.62 In what follows, the simulation of IET, using the 3-(4-nitrophenyl)pentane-2,4-dione (NPA-H) LUMO+2 as the initial state, shows ultrafast IET with an injection time scale of approximately 12 fs.63 Considering the above results, our IET characterization studies clearly indicate that the IET from the LUMO is in the range of ps, while the lifetime of the LUMO+1 happens in the fs range. Given the fast injection and the low energy of the transition relative to the LUMO state, injection from the M101–104 LUMO + 1 appears to be ideal.
Now, if we go back to I–V results, it appears that M104 had the most open voltage circuit among all other sensitizers as well as an ultra-fast injection electron, especially from the LUMO+1, demonstrating M104 as a promising modified structure. Therefore, we propose that the fast IET contributes to lowering charge recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 to the I3/3I− electrolyte energy level which determines the value of Voc.
It is worth pointing out that the main contribution of the LUMO+1 in all four dyes is exclusive to the absorption band in the range of 470–490 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum (the molar extinction coefficient of UV-Vis and the IPCE value of M102 are significantly higher than those of others).
Further studies on efficient sensitizers are in progress, and we believe that improvements can be achieved by a thorough optimization of aliphatic–aromatic composite structures with respect to, for example, carboxylic anchoring groups, π-extended aromatic ancillary ligands of M102, and functionalized M102.
4. Conclusion
Although a variety of sensitizers have been reported in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as the most promising components to achieve high PCE, the preparation of a new sensitizer is still required. In particular, the new generation of the architecture of a sensitizer is based on multifunctional ancillary ligands which guaranty a number of photophysical and photochemical properties.
As a part of our project entitled “The influence of ancillary ligands on DSSCs”,64 four new ruthenium polypyridyl sensitizers based on dicyano quinoxaline as the anchoring ligand and E101 containing amphiphilic-phenanthroline as well as a polypyridyl ancillary ligand have been experimentally designed and thoroughly characterized for use in DSSCs, revealing the importance of all three parts of the sensitizer to achieve high efficiency.
To investigate the dye regeneration and recombination process and excited-state lifetime, the charge carrier dynamic study including transient absorption microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence decay was carried out. Transient absorption studies clearly indicated a weak competition between kreg and krec, confirming that the back electron transport limits the operation of the device. Surprisingly, the lifetime obtained from the time-resolved photoluminescence decay was in the range of 350–450 ns which belongs to long excited-state lifetimes in ruthenium polypyridyl sensitizers.
The computational section of this paper addressed the influence of the molecular structure of the sensitizer on the electron regeneration rate in the LUMOs of sensitizers to the TiO2 semiconductor. In contrast to previous reports in which the LUMO orbital showed a lifetime in the range of fs, the time scale of the lifetime of the LUMO+1 was in the range of below 100 fs which is ideal for an efficient interfacial electron transfer from the sensitizer to the semiconductor.
We considered, in particular, the correlation between the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on the investigated complexes and their interfacial electron transfer simulation. Our main findings are:
(1) The time scale of the lifetimes of electron regeneration from the LUMO to the TiO2 surface is in the region of ps which is a long time for electron regeneration for DSSCs.
(2) The lifetime of the LUMO+1 is below 100 fs which is ideal for an efficient electron transfer to the TiO2 surface.
(3) To design an efficient sensitizer, a number of structure requirements are suggested: (i) the presence of an ancillary polypyridyl ligand; (ii) phen is a promising ancillary polypyridyl ligand; (iii) the examined complexes without an amphiphilic ligand show very weak PCE; and (iv) the Dicnq ligand which contains phen, the quinoxaline moiety, and two adjacent CN groups can be a promising anchoring ligand for future studies.
(4) The combination of two different factors, including the higher molar absorption coefficient and the faster interfacial electron transfer rate from the LUMO and LUMO+1 of M102 compared to other complexes, leads to the higher photovoltaic performance of M102.
We believe that our study rationalizes a number of experimental observables, casting a direct connection between the molecular structure of the sensitizer and its interfacial electron transfer lifetime from possible LUMOs. In terms of connection to solar cell operation, our findings contribute to the recognition of the main excited states which effectively make the injection of electron from LUMOs to the conduction band of TiO2.
