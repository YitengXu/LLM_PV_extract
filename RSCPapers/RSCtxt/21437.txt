    , Accepted 25th August 2017First published on 25th August 2017AbstractMonodisperse β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ (NYF) hexagonal microplates with efficient near-infrared (NIR)-to-NIR up-conversion (UC) developed via a new ion-exchange modified hydrothermal method are reported. Ion exchange modification (IEM) not only significantly increases the UC intensity by up to 1000 times and prolongs the emission lifetimes of Tm3+ and Yb3+, but also enables the monodisperse morphology and size of hexagonal microplates to be maintained. A high UC quantum efficiency (QE) of 3.1% is obtained for IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,1%Tm3+ when excited with 980 nm light at a power density of 10 W cm−2. The UC emission properties can be finely tailored by changing the NaF/NYF molar ratio (NYF represents lanthanide doped β-NaYF4) and the doping concentration of Tm3+. The two photon NIR UC emission centered at ∼803 nm (arising from Tm3+: 3H4 → 3H6) dominates the UC emission spectrum and high concentrations of Tm3+ favor NIR UC further. A proof-of-concept optical image of printed patterns is demonstrated to verify their applications in security. These results suggest the promising applications of the newly developed monodisperse β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ hexagonal microplates in security, luminescent labels, solid-state lasers, amplifiers, and biomedicine.
Introduction
Up-conversion (UC) refers to the phenomenon of converting low photon energy excitation, typically near-infrared (NIR) light, into high photon energy emission ranging from NIR to visible or even to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths.1–3 Among them, NIR-to-NIR UC materials have wide applications in different fields of science and technology including security labels,4 biomedicine,5 solid-state lasers,6 solar cells,7 as well as emerging markets such as luminescent labels for plastic recycling.8 Upon excitation at 980 nm, Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped UC materials show efficient NIR-to-NIR UC emission at ∼800 nm (within the first biological window, NIR I), arising from the transition of Tm3+: 3H4 → 3H6.9–15 For example, Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 microcrystals have been proposed as one of the most efficient NIR-to-NIR UC emitters.8,16,17 In addition, Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped UC materials also exhibit the most efficient NIR-to-blue UC emission, which further extends their applications in full color displays.4 Furthermore, they also demonstrate relatively weak NIR-to-UV UC emission allowing potential applications in UV lasers.14 For these different UC emission bands, their emission intensities greatly depend on the excitation power density – the higher the excitation power density, the stronger the shorter wavelength UC emission. Indeed, the adjustment of the excitation power density provides a unique route to manipulate the UC emission properties of UC phosphors. In particular, efficient UC emission at low excitation power density (<1 W cm−2) is the one of the most important requirements for practical applications. In this case, more efficient NIR-to-NIR UC emission in Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped microcrystals, such as β-NaYF4, and the exploration of their practical applications are in urgent need.
In the last decade, many strategies have been reported to enhance the UC emission efficiency of lanthanide doped nanoparticles such using a noble metal nanocrystal plasma,18 the photonic crystal effect,19 surface coating via a core–shell structure,20etc. However, these methods may only work for nanoparticles.21 The exploration of novel methods to enhance the UC emission efficiency of Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 microcrystals is urgently required. For the synthesis of β-NaYF4 microcrystals, one drawback of the traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction is that the morphology and size of these microcrystals cannot be controlled, which greatly limits their applications, such as in micro-optoelectronic devices.23–25 The morphology and size of β-NaYF4 microcrystals can be controlled via the traditional hydrothermal method, however the emission efficiency of lanthanides can decrease significantly due to the formation of lanthanide clusters and the high OH− concentration.23,26 Recently, we developed a Na+ ion-exchange modified hydrothermal method for β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ to achieve efficient UC emission of Er3+. In contrast to the traditional post-high-temperature annealing method,22 the ion exchange method demonstrates unique advantages of not only greatly enhancing the UC emission efficiency but also maintaining the good microcrystal morphology.23,26,27 In this work, we report on efficient NIR-to-NIR UC emission at low excitation power density in microparticles with well controlled morphology and size. Different NaF/NYF molar ratios (NYF represents lanthanide doped β-NaYF4) and doping concentrations of Tm3+ provide effective routes to manipulate the UC emission properties of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ microcrystals while maintaining the crystal structures and morphology. Using these NIR UC emission microcrystals, a proof-of-concept optical imaging experiment is carried out at a low excitation power density of 0.9 W cm−2 to prove a possibility of their usage in security applications, where both the excitation light and the emitted light are invisible to the human eye.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
The general synthetic routes are illustrated in Scheme 1. Y(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%), Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99%), Tm(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), NaF (99.99%), Na3C6H5O7·2H2O (CIT, ≥99.0%) and NH4HF2 (99.99%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. All chemicals were used without further purification. β-NaYF4 microplates with designed Yb3+ and Tm3+ doping concentrations were firstly synthesized via the hydrothermal method as shown in Scheme 1.23,26,27 Different concentrations of Tm3+, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0%, were co-doped with 20% Yb3+ to investigate the effect of Tm3+ concentration on the emission.

Ion-exchange modification (IEM)
Pre-synthesized lanthanide doped β-NaYF4 (0.1200 g), NaF (0.1680 g) and NH4HF2 (0.3643 g) were mixed with deionized water (1.2 ml) and stirred for 10 minutes to conduct the Na+ ion-exchange reaction (Scheme 1). The NaF/NYF molar ratio (NYF indicates lanthanide doped β-NaYF4) was adjusted to 0.2, 1, 3, and 5 while maintaining the NaF/NH4HF2 molar ratio and H2O content. The mixed solution was transferred into a 25 ml Teflon bottle held in a stainless steel autoclave, sealed and maintained at 220 °C for 36 h. When the autoclave was cooled to 25 °C, the precipitates were separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and dried at 70 °C for 12 h.
NIR–NIR UC emission imaging
The β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ microcrystals after IEM with a NaF/NYF ratio = 5 were used to investigate the potential applications of NIR UC emission in security as sketched in Scheme 1. First, the β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ microcrystals (20 mg) were dispersed into H2O (1 ml) by ultrasonication to obtain luminescent inks. Then, as-prepared luminescent inks were printed on common white paper using hollow-out copper stencils to obtain different patterns as large as 5.7 × 8.0 mm. The images of these printed patterns upon 980 nm laser irradiation (0.9 W cm−2) were taken with a help of an infrared viewer (FJW Optical Systems, Inc., USA) with a spectral sensitivity of 350–1550 nm. An 800 nm band-pass (FWHM = 40 nm, FBH800-40, Thorlabs) filter was placed in front of the camera to block 980 nm excitation light. The diameter of the excitation spot was 15 mm, larger than the size of the printed patterns.
Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation. A Hitachi SU8010 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to measure the morphology of the samples. The UC emission spectra and decay kinetics were measured using a spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLSP 920, UK) equipped with a 976 nm laser diode (LD, 3 W cm−2) as the excitation source and a visible photomultiplier (PMT, R928P) as the detector. The Yb3+ NIR photo-luminescence (PL) emission spectra and decay kinetics were measured on the same spectrometer in conjunction with a liquid nitrogen cooled PMT detector (R5509) and a power-controllable 808 nm LD. The internal (with respect to the absorbed photons) and external (with respect to the incident photons) UC quantum efficiencies (QEs) were measured using a custom-built optical system at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) according to the 2M and 3M procedures.28–31 A 10 W cm−2 980 nm LD was used as the excitation source for both UCQYs. For power dependent measurements, the power density of the laser beam (0.001–8 W cm−2) was adjusted by the use of the controlled rotatable neutral density filter (Thorlabs). All characterization techniques were carried out at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and morphology

Fig. 1a shows the representative powder XRD diffraction patterns of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ before (as-prepared, AP) and after ion-exchange modification (IEM) with varying NaF/NYF molar ratios (1, 3 and 5). The reference diffraction pattern of hexagonal β-NaYF4 is also shown at the bottom of Fig. 1a. All diffraction patterns follow the standard hexagonal β-NaYF4 (P63/m, space group No. 176, PDF No. 16-0344) structure without any impurity phases, indicating the successful synthesis of targeted β-NaYF4 before and after IEM. The high phase purity of β-NaYF4 evidences the successful incorporation of Yb3+/Tm3+ (ionic radius: 86.8/88 pm in six-fold coordination) into Y3+ (ionic radius: 90 pm in six-fold coordination) 2c sites. This is an expected result due to their similar ionic radii and the same charge number.32 After IEM, the crystal structure of β-NaYF4 is clearly maintained and no visible peak shifts or change in the intensity ratios can be observed with increasing the NaF/NYF molar ratio from 1 to 5.

The standard diffraction pattern of β-NaYF4 is shown at the bottom. SEM images of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ (b) before and (c) after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5. 

Fig. 1b and c show the SEM images of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ AP and after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5. The β-NaYF4 microcrystals AP and after IEM are highly uniform and composed of monodisperse hexagonal thin plates with a thickness of 0.7 μm and diameter of 3.3 μm due to their hexagonal growing nature.23 The IEM preserves the monodisperse morphology and size of hexagonal thin plates, as shown in Fig. 1c. In addition, the surface of β-NaYF4 microplates is mildly etched during the IEM process.
Up-conversion (UC) emission of Tm3+
IEM significantly improves the UC performance of hydrothermally synthesized β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+. Fig. 2a and d present the corresponding representative UC emission spectra of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ and β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ dependent on the NaF/NYF molar ratio (0.2, 1, 3 and 5), respectively. Upon excitation with a 976 nm LD (power density of 3 W cm−2), β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ exhibits typical narrow line-type UC emissions of Tm3+, which are composed of seven individual bands varying from 330 to 850 nm. The NIR UC emission at ∼803 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 18 nm (280 cm−1) is by far the most intense UC emission peak observed within all samples. It is typical for a two photon UC process of Tm3+ and the peak is attributed to the 4f12 → 4f12 transition of Tm3+: 3H4 → 3H6. The UC emission in the blue region centered at ∼474 nm attributed to Tm3+: 1G4 → 3H6 shows the second strongest UC intensity. This peak is typical for a three-photon UC emission process involving Tm3+. Its intensity is >20 times weaker than that of the NIR band at 803 nm. Despite its weak intensity, the bright blue UC color can be observed by the naked eye under excitation with a 3 W cm−2 980 nm LD after IEM, as exemplarily shown in the inset of Fig. 2a and d. The corresponding CIE-1931 chromaticity color coordinates are determined to be (0.17, 0.13) for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ and (0.19, 0.14) for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ after ion-exchange with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5. They are located in the blue region in the CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram. In addition, five weak UC emission peaks at ∼344, 360, 450, 645 and 695 nm can also be observed, which are attributed to the transitions of Tm3+: 1I6 → 3F4, 1D2 → 3H6, 1D2 → 3F4, 1G4 → 3F4 and 3F2,3 → 3H6, respectively.33

The black solid lines and the spectra regions with grey background in both (a and d) are enlarged by a factor of ×100 and ×20, respectively. The inset photographs in (a) and (d) show the emission colors under laser irradiation after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5. The lines in (c and f) are provided to guide the eye. Excitation source: 976 nm LD with a power density of 3 W cm−2. 
For the AP sample, only very faint UC in the NIR region peaking at ∼803 nm can be observed as illustrated in Fig. 2a and d. Impressively, IEM enhances the UC emission intensity by up to ∼3 orders of magnitude for all bands. For example, the UC emission intensity in the NIR region (at 803 nm) for samples after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5 is enhanced by more than 1000-fold compared with the AP counterpart, as shown in Fig. 2a and d. The UC emission properties of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ are also sensitive to the variation of the NaF/NYF molar ratio. For instance, the UC emission intensity of all bands strongly increases by ∼2.5-fold with increasing NaF/NYF molar ratio from 1 to 3 for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+, as plotted in Fig. 2a. The optimum NaF/NYF ratio for the strongest UC intensity is found to be 3–5. The shape and intensity ratio of different UC bands are very stable with varying NaF/NYF molar ratios from 1 to 5. Similar phenomena can also be observed for other samples doped with higher Tm3+ concentrations with varying NaF/NYF molar ratios, such as β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+, as depicted in Fig. 2d.
Higher Tm3+ doping concentrations (>0.1 mol%) result in stronger emission intensity for the UC bands at 803 and 695 nm but weaker intensity for other bands with the same NaF/NYF molar ratio (Fig. 2a and d). The dependence of the UC emission properties of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ after IEM with a fixed NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5 on Tm3+ concentration (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mol%) will be discussed in detail later (Fig. 3).

(f) Decay curves for NIR (λem = 803 nm) UC emission of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,x%Tm3+ (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0) as a function of the doping concentration of Tm3+. 
According to our previous work, the faint UC emission in the AP sample is attributed to the formation of locally clustered lanthanide ions and the existence of a relatively high concentration of OH− groups induced in the hydrothermal synthesis process.23,26 After IEM, the well maintained crystal phase, morphology and size of β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ microplates, almost unchanged chemical composition and significantly enhanced UC emission efficiency support that the majority of Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions are maintained in microplates rather than being dispersed in solution.23,26 The IEM process strongly disperses the locally clustered lanthanide ions. For the OH− groups, Dyck et al. directly proved that the residual water does exist and strongly quenches the UC emission in the hydrothermally synthesized microcrystals.22 During the IEM process, a great amount of NaF and NH4HF2 are used, and these fluorides can easily reduce the OH− groups via the fluoridation process.34
Thus, Fig. 2b and e illustrate the rise and decay behavior of the Tm3+ NIR UC emission at 803 nm for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ and β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+, respectively, AP and after IEM with varying NaF/NYF molar ratios (0.2, 1, 3 and 5). The AP sample exhibits an extremely short rise lifetime of ∼0.07 ms and decay lifetime of ∼0.16 ms for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+. A higher Tm3+ concentration (0.5 mol%) results in an even shorter rise lifetime of ∼0.03 ms and decay lifetime of ∼0.12 ms for AP β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ (see Fig. 2e and f). After IEM, both the rise and decay lifetimes of Tm3+ are strongly prolonged. This is fully consistent with the enormously enhanced UC emission intensity after IEM. For example, the rise and decay lifetimes of Tm3+ in β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 1 are strongly prolonged from ∼0.06 to 1.2 ms and from 0.16 to 1.75 ms, respectively (Fig. 2c). The rise lifetime remains almost constant (∼1.2 ms) with increasing NaF/NYF molar ratio (Fig. 2c). The lifetime of Tm3+ slightly increased from 1.75 to 1.94 ms with increasing NaF/NYF molar ratio from 1 to 5 for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+. The long rise lifetime evidences the energy transfer UC mechanism of the Yb3+/Tm3+ pair in β-NaYF4.
A similar trend can be observed for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+. The rise and decay lifetimes of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ are slightly shorter than those of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ with the same NaF/NYF molar ratio due to the pronounced back energy transfer (BET) from Tm3+ to Yb3+ at high Tm3+ concentration via the transition Tm3+: 3H4 + Yb3+: 2F7/2 → Tm3+: 3H6 + Yb3+: 2F5/2, which strongly depopulates the UC emitting level of Tm3+: 3H4 for NIR UC (Fig. 2e and f).
The decay lifetime reflects the competitive radiative and non-radiative processes of lanthanides (Yb3+ and Tm3+).35 In the present case, for the AP sample, the non-radiative process dominates the decay process due to the existence of a high concentration of quenching centers such as lanthanide clusters and OH− groups.23,26 The high concentration of quenching centers leads to a fast non-radiative rate and fast energy transfer rate to these quenching centers resulting in a short abnormal lifetime in the AP sample. The rise time indicates the energy transfer rate from Yb3+ to Tm3+. The short rise time of the AP sample indicates the low energy transfer rate from Yb3+ to Tm3+, resulting in very faint UC emission. The existence of the quenching centers of Yb3+ and Tm3+ clusters and OH− groups leads to a low energy transfer rate from Yb3+ to Tm3+ and thus a short rise time. IEM strongly reduces these quenching centers leading to a strongly prolonged lifetime and rise time, and significantly enhanced UC emission efficiency.

Fig. 3a shows the UC emission spectra of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,x%Tm3+ (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0) after IEM with a fixed NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5 as a function of Tm3+ doping concentration. The UC emission intensity in the NIR region at 803 nm increases by ∼2.5-fold with increasing Tm3+ doping concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 mol%. In contrast, the UC emission intensity in blue and other visible bands strongly decreases. For example, a 6-fold decrease of UC emission intensity in the blue band (474 nm) can be observed. As a result, the intensity ratio of the two strongest emission bands, I803/I474, significantly increases from ∼24 to 380, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. With the Tm3+ doping concentration increasing even higher, up to 2.0 mol%, the visible UC emission is too weak to be detected and only faint NIR emission can be detected. It can be explained as the statistical ionic distance between Yb3+ and Tm3+ becomes shorter with increasing Tm3+ concentration. This strongly promotes cross-relaxation among Tm3+via the transition 1G4 + 3F4 → 3H4 + 3F3 and BET from Tm3+ to Yb3+via the transition Tm3+: 3H4 + Yb3+: 2F7/2 → Tm3+: 3H6 + Yb3+: 2F5/2. It strongly depopulates the blue emission level and facilitates the NIR UC emission level.
As is well known, UC emission is a non-linear process and the UC intensity nonlinearly increases with excitation power density, as described by the following eqn (1) in the low excitation power density regime36,37 IUC ∝ Pn,(1)where, IUC is the UC emission intensity and n is the number of excitation NIR photons per given UC emission photon of Tm3+. The value of n can be determined via linear fitting of the double logarithmic relationship of the UC emission intensity of a given band versus the excitation power density in the low excitation power density regime. The n value is important to understand the involved UC emission mechanisms for the given bands, with n often being lower than the real number.8Fig. 3e shows the double logarithmic plot of UC emission intensity of NIR UC as a function of pump power density (0.001–8 W cm−2) for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,1%Tm3+ after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5. In the low excitation power density regime (0.001–0.36 W cm−2), the NIR UC emission at ∼803 nm yields a slope n of n = 1.85 ± 0.01, thus confirming the two photon UC nature of this process. In the high power density regime (0.36–8 W cm−2), the slop of n decreases from 1.85 ± 0.01 to 1.32 ± 0.01. No strong saturation effect can be observed at the applied excitation power density up to 8 W cm−2.
We measured the UC quantum efficiency (QE) of β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,x%Tm3+ (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0) after IEM with a fixed NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5 as a function of Tm3+ doping concentration with a 10 W cm−2 980 nm LD, as shown in Fig. 3d. The internal QE (with respect to absorbed photons) of β-NaYF4:20Yb3+,xTm3+ increases from 1.2 to 3.1% with increasing doping concentration of Tm3+ from 0.1 to 1.0 mol%. The highest Tm3+ doping concentration (2.0% mol%) leads to a sharp drop of internal QE from 3.1% to 0.4% and almost totally quenched visible UC emission. The QE value of 3.1% (10 W cm−2) is among the highest reported values in the literature.38 The identical nominal doping concentration of Yb3+ (20 mol%) results in an almost equivalent absorbance of ∼20% (determined by the integrating sphere) for β-NaYF4:20Yb3+,xTm3+. Thus, the external QE (with respect to incident photons) exhibits the exactly same trend with increasing doping concentration of Tm3+. Here, the external QE increases from 0.2% to 0.6% with increasing doping concentration Tm3+ from 0.1 to 1.0 mol%. The external QE value is much lower than the internal QE due to the low absorbance ∼20%. Then, it strongly decreases from 0.6% to 0.09% with further increasing doping concentration of Tm3+ from 1.0 mol% to 2.0 mol%. Due to the non-linear process of UC emission, a higher QE value may be expected by applying an even higher excitation power density.16

Fig. 3f presents the decay curves of the NIR UC emission (803 nm) for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,x%Tm3+ (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0) after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5 as a function of the Tm3+ doping concentration. The rise lifetime of NIR UC emission decreases from 1.1 to 0.7 ms with increasing Tm3+ concentration due to the shortened distance between Yb3+ and Tm3+ and the subsequently increased energy transfer efficiency from Yb3+ to Tm3+. The lifetime of Tm3+ NIR UC emission decreases from 2.1 to 1.3 ms with increasing Tm3+ doping concentration from 0.1 to 2.0 mol% due to the reinforced aforementioned cross-relaxation among Tm3+ and BET from Tm3+ to Yb3+.
Photoluminescence of Yb3+

Fig. 4a presents the PL spectra of Yb3+ for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+ before and after IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5. Upon excitation at 808 nm, the typical NIR emission of Yb3+ from 950 to 1100 nm with a peak at 1010 nm, attributed to the transition Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 can be observed.39–41 It is a broad emission peak with a FWHM of 57 nm (566 cm−1). Using a Lorentz function, the broad spectrum can be fitted with four Stark peaks located at 977 nm, 994 nm, 1014 nm and 1034 nm, as shown by the four blue dashed lines in Fig. 4a. The IEM strongly enhances the NIR UC emission intensity of Yb3+ by a factor of ∼40-fold for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding decay curves of Yb3+ emission for β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.1%Tm3+. The AP sample shows short rise and decay lifetimes of 0.03 ms and 0.16 ms, respectively. In accordance with the greatly enhanced PL intensity of Yb3+, after IEM, the rise and decay lifetimes are strongly prolonged up to 0.17 ms and 1.8 ms, respectively.

UC emission mechanisms
Based on these results, the involved UC and PL mechanisms are proposed, as shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. In brief, Yb3+, the sensitizer, absorbs the 980 nm excitation and transfers the energy to Tm3+, the activator, which gives rise to the UC emission.12,42 Upon excitation at 980 nm, Yb3+ is pumped to 2F5/2. The successive transfer energy of two absorbed photons from Yb3+ to Tm3+ populates Tm3+: 3H5 and Tm3+: 3H4 which gives rise to the dominant NIR UC emission at ∼803 nm. The transfer of energy of the third photon from Yb3+ to Tm3+ can populate the Tm3+: 1G4 level leading to blue UC emission at ∼474 nm, and red UC emissions at 645 nm and 695 nm. The transfer of energy of the fourth photon will populate the Tm3+: 1D2 level leading to blue UC emission at ∼450 nm and UV UC at ∼360 nm. With the increase of Tm3+ concentration, the BET from Tm3+ to Yb3+ causes a decrease of the rise and decay lifetimes of Tm3+ at 803 nm. Moreover, the enhanced cross-relaxation among Tm3+via1G4 + 3F4 → 3H4 + 3F3 also leads to a decrease of UC emission from high-photon processes (≥3) such as blue UC emission. Upon excitation at 808 nm in Fig. 5b, Tm3+ ions are pumped to the excited state Tm3+: 3H4 from the ground state Tm3+: 3H6. For Yb3+ PL upon excitation at 808 nm, it is realized via energy transfer from Tm3+: 3H4 to Yb3+: 2F5/2. After IEM, the promoted energy transfer between Tm3+ and Yb3+ results in much stronger Yb3+ PL emission at ∼1000 nm. The IEM disperses the Yb3+ and Tm3+ clusters and decreases the concentration of detrimental OH− groups leading to strongly improved UC and PL emission from Tm3+ and Yb3+, respectively.

NIR UC emission imaging
The efficient NIR-to-NIR UC emission of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ mono-dispersed microplates with controlled morphology makes them promising candidates in areas such as security. Fig. 6 demonstrates the NIR emission images for the printed “SIOM” micropatterns using fluorescent inks, which were prepared by dispersing of 2 wt% β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ microcrystals in water. To print the patterns, the hollow-out copper stencils, four different English letters “S”, “I”, “O”, and “M” with a size of 5.7 × 8.0 mm were used, as illustrated in Fig. 6a–d. Fig. 6e–h demonstrate the NIR UC emission images upon 976 nm laser irradiation with a power density of 0.9 W cm−2 and a big excitation spot with a diameter of 15 mm. Such a low power density is easy to realize in practical applications and is also unfavorable for the three- or four-step UC processes of visible UC emission, which are about two orders of magnitude weaker than those of the NIR UC emission. When using an 800 nm band-pass filter to only collect the NIR UC emission, clearly, four fluorescent letters “S”, “I”, “O”, and “M” can be observed in accordance with the stencil pattern. Unique advantages for much safer security encoding are realized in this route. First, both NIR light source and NIR UC emissions are invisible to the human eye, and hence difficult to decrypt. Second, such a low power density is easy to realize. Third, the ∼800 nm emission is within the highly sensitive region of widely used commercial detectors, such as silicon-based charge-coupled-devices (CCDs).

Conclusions
In summary, we report efficient NIR-to-NIR UC emission in β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ with well controlled morphology and size of hexagonal microplates obtained via a new IEM hydrothermal method. IEM enormously improves the UC emission properties of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+, while maintaining the monodisperse morphology and size of hexagonal thin plates. β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ shows dominant UC emission in the NIR region at ∼803 nm, arising from the transition of Tm3+: 3H4 → 3H6. IEM with varying NaF/NYF ratios leads to enormously enhanced UC emission intensity by up to three orders of magnitude and significantly prolonged lifetimes of energy levels. The UC emission properties of Tm3+ can be finely tuned by changing the NaF/NYF molar ratio and the doping concentration of Tm3+. The optimum NaF/NYF molar ratio and doping concentration of Tm3+ are determined to be 5 and 1 mol%, respectively. The maximum internal QE is measured to be 3.1% for IEM β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,1%Tm3+. Similarity, IEM with a NaF/NYF molar ratio = 5 leads to significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity of Yb3+ by ∼40-fold and a significantly prolonged lifetime. A proof-of-concept optical image of printed patterns is demonstrated to verify their possible applications in security. These results hint the potential applications of newly developed monodisperse β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ hexagonal microplates in security, luminescent labels, solid-state lasers, amplifiers, and biomedicine.
