    , Accepted 22nd January 2013First published on 1st March 2013AbstractThis work focuses on the design of composite photoanodes with dual-mode luminescent function as well as the effects of luminescent phosphors on the photoelectric properties of dye-sensitized solar cells. Specifically, hexagonal phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals were prepared by a hydrothermal method and added to the TiO2 photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells. The results indicated that the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes can emit visible light under 495 or 980 nm excitation, and then the visible light can be absorbed by dye N719 to improve light harvesting and thereby the efficiency of the solar cell. Under simulated solar radiation in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was increased by 10% compared to pure TiO2 cell. For the electrodes with the same thickness, the amount of dye adsorption of the photoanodes decreased a little after adding NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, which was attributed to the decrease of TiO2 in the photoanodes. The electron transport and interfacial recombination kinetics were investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy. The TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell has longer electron recombination time as well as electron transport time than pure TiO2 cell. The charge collection efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was little lower than that of pure TiO2 cell. In addition, the interfacial resistance of the TiO2-dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was much bigger than that of pure TiO2 cell. All these results indicated that the charge transport cannot be improved by adding NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. And thus, the enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiencies of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells were closely related to the dual-mode luminescent function of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+.
1. Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has become one of the most promising solar cells in the renewable energy research and development field for its potentially low fabrication cost and relatively good efficiency.1 Generally, DSSCs are comprised of a nanocrystalline semi-conductor oxide photoelectrode, a dye sensitiser, a redox shuttle and a counter electrode. An electric current can be generated when a photon absorbed by a dye molecule gives rise to electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor.2 To complete the circuit, the dye must be regenerated by electron transfer from a redox species in solution, which is then reduced at the counter electrode.3 The amount of dye adsorption, light harvesting efficiency, and the ability of charge separation and transport are three important factors to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Among nanocrystalline semiconductor oxide electrodes, the anatase phase TiO2 with a band gap of 3.2 eV has been one of the best choices for DSSCs due to its high dye adsorption and fast electron transport.4 So far, numerous methods have been adopted to modify TiO2 and improve photoelectric conversion performance of DSSCs, such as doping of metal or nonmetal elements, surface modifications, and combination with narrow band gap semiconductors.5 Ru(II) complexes, such as N3 and N719, are known as the best sensitizers in DSSCs. However, the main absorption wavelength ranges for dyes N3 and N719 are 290–700 nm, which is very low compared to the near-infrared (NIR) light.6 About 43% of the radiant energy from the sun in the infrared region is not absorbed, which limits the sun energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Therefore, it is significant for transferring infrared light to visible light which can be absorbed by dyes to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
Rare earth (RE) ions doped luminescent materials usually show unique down-conversion (DC) and up-conversion (UC) properties, which offer the opportunity to improve light harvesting and thereby the efficiency of the solar cells. Especially, the UC of RE ions brought a new opportunity for the utilization of long-wavelength sunlight.7–9 However, the effects of DC luminescence of Er3+ ions on the photoelectric properties of DSSCs have never been reported.
The purpose of this work was to design composite DSSCs with dual-mode luminescent function as well as deeply investigate the effects of luminescent phosphors on the photoelectric properties. It is well known that the luminescence of RE ions mainly originates from the electron transitions within the 4f shell. Many transitions are initiated from an excited level with a small energy gap to the next-lower level, and therefore, materials with lower phonon energy are required as the luminescent host to minimize nonradiative loss.10 Among various materials, fluoride nanocrystals, such as NaYF4, LaF3, YF3, and CaF2 have aroused great interest due to their low phonon energies and optical transparency over a wide wavelength range.11 In particular, NaYF4 is acknowledged as the most efficient DC and UC host material at present.12
Here, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals with DC as well as UC function were chosen as upconverting phosphors to design TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes. Under simulated solar radiation in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was increased by 10% compared to pure TiO2 cell. We carried out a large number of experiments and proved that the utilization of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ phosphors is an effective way to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of samples
All of the chemicals used in this paper were analytical-grade and used without further purification. For the synthesis of NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+: In a typical synthesis, 2 mL of 0.5 M Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Y, Yb, and Er) aqueous solution and 1 mmol of EDTA were dispensed into 10 mL of distilled water and magnetically stirred for 30 min, forming a chelated Ln–EDTA complex. After that, an aqueous solution of NaF was added into the complex and vigorously stirred for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred into a 50 mL autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the final products were collected by means of centrifugation, washed with distilled water, and finally dried in vacuum at 80 °C.
Fabrication of photoelectrode and the assembly of DSSCs: several pastes, from homogeneously mixing NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ and TiO2 (Degussa P25) into 3 mL of TiO2 colloid, were prepared with different mass concentrations of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. The TiO2 colloid was prepared following the previously published synthesis procedure.13 A screen-printed double layer of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ was used as the photoanode. A layer of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ was prepared by a doctor-blade method on the FTO substrate and then sintered at 450 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the second layer of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ was covered on the first TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ film and then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min again. The thicknesses of all electrodes were determined to be around 10 μm. The sensitization of the photoelectrodes was achieved by immersing them into 0.5 mM ((C4H9)4N)2[Ru(4-carboxy-4′-carboxylate-2,2′ bipyridine)2(NCS)2] dye (N719, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio, 1:1) for 48 h at room temperature. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared following the previous literature.14 The dye-sensitized photoelectrode and Pt counter electrode were adhered together with epoxy resin. The space between the electrodes was filled with the electrolyte, which comprised 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (3-MPN), by capillary action.
2.2 Characterization
The compositions of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoelectrodes were analyzed by a Bruker D8 diffractionmeter equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (γ = 1.5406 Å). The size and morphology of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2010 with operating voltage of 200 KV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 with operating voltage of 15 kV). The DC luminescence spectra were recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. The UC luminescence spectra were recorded using the spectrophotometer with an adjustable laser (980 nm, Beijing Hi-Tech Optoelectronic Co., China) as the excitation source with a fiber-optic accessory. Photocurrent–photovoltage curves were recorded by a BAS100B Electrochemical Analyzer. A Xe lamp with an AM1.5 radiation filter was used as the light source. A mask with an aperture was placed on the cell, giving an effective irradiation area of the working electrode of about 0.12 cm2. The EIS was performed with a computer-controlled IM6 impedance measurement unit (Zahner IM6&Zennium, Germany). EIS were obtained by applying sinusoidal perturbations of −0.8 mV over the Voc at the frequency range from 0.05 to 100 kHz. The obtained spectra were fitted with ZsimpWin software in terms of appropriate equivalent circuits. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) under short-circuit conditions and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) under open-circuit conditions were carried out using the same electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6&Zennium, Germany) with a frequency response analyzer under an intensity modulated (30–150 W m−2) white light emitting diode driven by a Zahner (XPot) source supply. Illumination was always incident on the working electrode side of the solar cells. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1000 Hz to 0.1 Hz for IMPS and IMVS.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structures and morphologies of samples

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD pattern of the luminescent NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals. All the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the pure hexagonal NaYF4 (JCPDS 16-0334). No other impurity peaks were detected. The corresponding SEM image of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals is shown in Fig. 2(a). Plenty of almost uniform and regular hexagonal pillars with an average length of about 10 μm can be seen in Fig. 2(a). The XRD patterns of pure TiO2 photoanode and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode are shown in Fig. 1(b,c). Here, the mass concentration of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ is 3% in the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode. For the pure TiO2 photoanode, nearly all of the peaks correspond to the anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272). The peaks marked by R110, R101, and R111 arise from rutile phase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1276). For the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode, the peaks marked by an asterisk (*) arise from cubic NaYF4 (JCPDS 06-0342). It is noted that the sintering process was necessary during preparation of the photoelectrode, which has been described in the Experimental section. After sintering at 450 °C for 30 min, the hexagonal-to-cubic phase transition of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ occurred in TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes. Fig. 2(b) is the typical SEM image of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode. The TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode consists of many particles. Further detailed component analysis on the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode was carried out by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2(c–f). Typical high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode show two interplanar spacings of 0.31 and 0.36 nm, corresponding to the 〈111〉 plane of cubic phase NaYF4 and 〈101〉 plane of anatase phase TiO2, respectively. The results indicated that TiO2 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ coexist in the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode. The illustration of the possible formation mechanism of dye N719 sensitized TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes is shown in Scheme 1.

To further investigate the phase transition of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ in TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes, pure NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals were sintered at different conditions, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† It was found that the proportion of cubic NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ increased with increasing sintering temperature and time. However, although the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ was sintered at 600 °C for 2 h, pure cubic NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ still cannot be obtained. Obviously, the hexagonal-to-cubic phase transition of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ occurs more easily in the present of TiO2. In addition, when the sintering temperature was 450 °C, the patterns of hexagonal phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ become broader with sintering time, which can be attributed to the decrease of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ resulting from the hexagonal-to-cubic phase transition of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. The corresponding SEM images of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ after sintering are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.†
3.2 Dual-mode luminescence of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes

Fig. 3 shows the UC luminescence spectrum of the as-prepared NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals under 980 nm excitation. The spectral peaks correspond to the following transitions: 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 (∼410 nm), 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (∼524 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (∼541 nm), and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (∼654 nm). It is obvious that the dominant emission is located in the green luminescence range.
 Fig. 3  Upconversion emission spectrum of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ microcrystals under 980 nm excitation. 
The UC luminescence mechanism and population processes in Yb3+/Er3+-codoped systems are presented in Scheme 2. The Er3+ ion is excited from the ground state 4I15/2 to the excited state 4I11/2via energy transfer of neighboring Yb3+ and Er3+. Subsequent nonradiative relaxation of 4I11/2 → 4I13/2 also populates the 4I13/2 level. Then, the same laser pumps the excited-state atoms from the 4I11/2 to the 4F7/2 levels via energy transfer and excited-state absorption, or from the 4I13/2 to 4F9/2 states via phonon-assisted energy transfer. The populated 4F7/2 may mostly nonradiatively relax to two lower levels: 2H11/2 and 4S3/2. In addition, the electron in 4F9/2 level may be excited to the 2H9/2 level via phonon-assisted energy transfer by the third photon.
 Scheme 2  Mechanism of NIR sunlight harvesting in TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells (ET: energy transfer). 
Under the excitation of a 980 nm laser, the UC luminescence spectra of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanodes before and after sensitization with N719 dye were recorded to evaluate the influence of N719 dye on the light emissions from the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, as shown in Fig. 4. For naked TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode, violet (2H9/2 → 4I15/2), green (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2), and red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) UC emissions were observed. However, for N719-sensitized TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode, the violet/green emissions almost vanished, meaning that dye N719 has absorbed the violet/green emissions from NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. Then the violet/green light excites dye N719 molecules to generate electron–hole pairs. Thus, the near infrared (∼980 nm) can be utilized via the UC function of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode. The mechanism of NIR sunlight harvesting in TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells is shown in Scheme 2. For comparison, the absorption spectrum of the dye N719 is shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 4  UC luminescence spectra of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode (a) before and (b) after dye sensitization under 980 nm excitation. 
In addition to the aforementioned UC luminescence properties, the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanode can emit DC luminescence under 495 nm excitation. Fig. 5(a) shows the emission spectra of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode before and after dye sensitization excited at 495 nm. For naked TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode, the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission was observed. However, for N719-sensitized TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode, the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 emission almost vanished, meaning that the DC emission of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ is also beneficial for enhancing photoelectric properties. Fig. 5(b) shows the excitation spectra of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanode before dye sensitization monitored at 522 and 550 nm.

3.3 Photoelectrochemical characterization of composite DSSCs
In order to investigate the effects of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ on the photoelectric properties of DSSCs, the DSSC prototype devices were fabricated by using N719-sensitised TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ electrodes. Regarding the fabrication of the cells in a convenient and reproducible way, each value for cell performance was determined as an average of the results from at least 10 samples. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of pure TiO2 cell under simulated solar radiation in different wavelength ranges. During the measurement, although the ranges of radiation wavelengths are different, the illumination is fixed at 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding values of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and overall conversion efficiency (η), obtained from the curves of solar cells, are shown in Table 1. It was found that the short-circuit current as well as photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSCs under simulated solar radiation in the wavelength range of 400 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm is much higher than that in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm. This is a normal phenomenon because the visible light intensity in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm is much lower than that in the wavelength range of 800 ≥ λ ≥ 400 nm and the mainly absorption wavelength range for dye N719 is 290–700 nm.

Fig. 7(a) shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell under simulated solar radiation in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm. The mass concentrations of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ in the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell are 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. For comparison, the photovoltaic characterization of the pure TiO2 cell is also shown in Fig. 7(a). The corresponding values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and η, obtained from the curves of solar cells, are shown in Table 2. It was found that the photoelectric conversion efficiencies of the DSSCs were enhanced greatly by the incorporation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. The best photoelectric conversion performance was observed when the mass concentration of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ was 3 wt%. Fig. 7(b) shows the incident photon to current (IPCE) spectra of pure TiO2 and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells. The results indicated that the photon-to-current conversion efficiency obviously increases in the visible and near-IR regions. It is noted that the 4I9/2 → 4I15/2 emission of Er3+ is centered at 780 nm, and thus, the enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiencies of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells were related to the dual-mode luminescent function of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+.

With the increase of the proportion of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ in TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell, Jsc increases and then decreases. At low concentrations of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, the increase of Jsc with the proportion of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ mainly comes from the UC luminescence of Er3+, which can be absorbed by dye N719 and result in enhanced light harvesting. However, the incorporation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ can influence the electrical conductivity of TiO2 and lead to a decrease in photocurrent. And thus Jsc increases and then decreases with the increasing proportion of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ in the DSSCs.
To further investigate the effect of infrared irradiation on the DSSCs, we used an infrared-pass filter to remove the light with wavelength less than 720 nm. Fig. 8 shows the pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell under infrared irradiation with a power density of 68 mW cm−2. The corresponding values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and η, obtained from the curves of solar cells, are shown in Table 3. As we hoped, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was higher than that of pure TiO2 cell.

In addition, the effects of pure NaYF4 on the photoelectric properties of DSSC were also investigated. The values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and η for TiO2–NaYF4 cell are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The results indicated that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4 cell cannot be greatly improved by adding pure NaYF4.
3.4 Measurements of interfacial charge transfer for TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite DSSCs
As mentioned above, the photoelectric conversion efficiencies of DSSCs are related to the amount of dye adsorption, light harvesting efficiency, and charge transport. To further prove the measurements of enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiencies of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells, the influence of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ on photoelectric conversion performance of DSSCs was investigated from two aspects: dye adsorption and charge transport.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of desorption dye from N719-sensitized photoanodes are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† According to the Beer–Lambert law,15 the molar concentration of dye N719 loading from pure TiO2 and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ photoanodes was 1.09 × 10−5 and 0.97 × 10−5 mol L−1, respectively. Obviously, the amount of dye adsorption of photoanodes decreased a little after adding NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, which was attributed to the decrease of TiO2 in the photoanodes. Usually, a higher amount of dye adsorption is expected to enhance the performance of DSSCs. Consequently, we can conclude that the enhancement of photoelectric properties is unrelated to the amount of dye adsorption.
EIS is a powerful method to investigate internal resistance that is attributed to the charge-transfer properties of DSSCs. Usually, the impedance at low frequency (0.05–1 Hz) corresponded to the Nernst diffusion of I3−/I− within the electrolyte. The impedance at high frequency (1k–100k Hz) in the impedance spectra corresponded to the capacitance and charge-transfer resistance at the Pt|I3−/I− electrolyte interface. The medium-frequency response at 1–100 Hz was associated with the TiO2-dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface, where an accumulation of photoelectrons and redox shuttles are expected. For liquid electrolyte, the fast diffusion of electrolyte can result in low resistance, and thus, the semicircle at high frequency often overlaps with that at middle frequency. Fig. 9 shows the EIS of pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell by applying sinusoidal perturbations of −0.8 mV. It can be clearly seen that the interfacial resistance of the TiO2-dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell is much bigger than that of pure TiO2 cell.

The inset in Fig. 9 shows the equivalent circuit fitting of the impedance spectra, Rs[C1(R1O1)](R2CPE), which was used for all the composite DSSCs. The symbols of R, C, O, and CPE represented the resistance, capacitance, finite-length Warburg diffusion (ZDif), and constant phase element, respectively. The impedance of the finite-length Warburg diffusion can be written as (1)where RDif = B/YO1, τ = B2, B is a parameter. The CPE is a nonideal frequency dependent capacitance, a characteristic that can be associated with a distribution of relaxation times or with a nonuniform distribution of current due to material heterogeneity.
The EIS data obtained by fitting the impedance spectra of composite DSSCs are shown in Table 4. It can be clearly seen that R2, which represents interfacial resistance of the TiO2-dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface, was 15.87 Ω for pure TiO2 cell and 23.12 Ω for TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell. It is noted that the higher interfacial resistance can result in lower interfacial electron transfer, which is not a beneficial factor for enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency. In addition, the series resistance (RS) for pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell are separately 29.89 Ω and 31.6 Ω, indicating that the incorporation of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ is not beneficial for the interfacial electron transfer of FTO|TiO2.

IMPS and IMVS are conventional methods to investigate the electron transfer and recombination process. The IMPS response plot and IMVS response plot of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell and pure TiO2 cell are shown in Fig. 10. The electron transport time (τd) and the electron recombination time (τn) can be estimated from the IMPS and IMVS plot. In comparison with pure TiO2 cell, the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell has longer electron recombination time and longer electron transport time. It noted that longer transport time can result in poorer photoelectric properties, while longer recombination time is beneficial for enhancing photoelectric properties. Thus, the photoelectric properties are closely related to the result of competition between charge transport and charge recombination in DSSCs. The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) of DSSC is determined by the relation: ηcc = 1 − τd/τn.16 Where, τd is a charge transport time and τn is a charge recombination lifetime. Fig. 11 shows the charge collection efficiencies of pure TiO2 cell and TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell. It was found that the charge collection efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell is little lower than that of pure TiO2 cell. The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) and diffusion length (Ln) can be determined on the basis of film thickness (x) and τd, as shown in Fig. S5 and S6 in the ESI.† All these results indicated that the charge transport and interfacial recombination cannot be improved by adding NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. Thus, the enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell must be closely related to the UC function of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+.

4. Conclusions
NaYF4:Yb3+(20%)/Er3+(2%) microcrystals were prepared by a hydrothermal method and subsequently mixed with TiO2 powder. The TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ mixture was further used as a photoanode material to fabricate DSSCs. The photoelectrical properties have been systematically studied. The results indicated that the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ composite photoanodes had the ability to improve light harvesting and thereby the efficiency of the solar cells. Under simulated solar radiation in the wavelength range of λ ≥ 400 nm, the photoelectric conversion efficiencies of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells were higher than that of pure TiO2 cell. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was obviously increased compared to pure TiO2 cell.
To further prove the measurements of enhanced photoelectric conversion efficiencies of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells, the influence of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ on photoelectric conversion performance of DSSCs was investigated from two aspects: dye adsorption and charge transport. The results indicated that the amount of dye adsorption of photoanodes decreased a little after adding NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, which was attributed to the decrease of TiO2 in the photoanodes. And thus, the enhancement of photoelectric properties is unrelated to the amount of dye adsorption. The electron transport and interfacial recombination kinetics were investigated by EIS, IMPS, and IMVS. EIS analysis revealed that the interfacial resistance of the TiO2-dye|I3−/I− electrolyte interface of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell is much bigger than that of pure TiO2 cell. In addition, the TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell exhibited longer electron recombination time and longer electron transport time than pure TiO2 cell. The charge collection efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cell was a little lower than that of pure TiO2 cell. All these results indicated that the charge transport cannot be improved by doping NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. And thus, we concluded that the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ with dual-mode luminescent function that can enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of TiO2–NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ cells. In addition, the enhancement of photoelectric properties is also related to the scattering effect.
