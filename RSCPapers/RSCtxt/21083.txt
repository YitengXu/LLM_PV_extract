    , Accepted 10th September 2015First published on 15th September 2015AbstractIn the present work, the earth-abundant NiS co-catalyst modified mesoporous graphite-like C3N4 (mpg-C3N4)/CNT nanocomposites were prepared via a two-step strategy: the sol–gel method and the direct precipitation process. The mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) experiments. The photocatalytic H2-production activity over the composite catalysts was also evaluated by using an aqueous solution containing triethanolamine under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm). The results showed that the loading of earth-abundant NiS co-catalysts onto metal-free mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites can remarkably enhance their photocatalytic H2-production activity. The optimal loading amount of NiS on metal-free mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites was about 1 wt%. The as-obtained mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS ternary composite photocatalyst exhibits the best H2-evolution activity with the highest rate of about 521 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm), which is almost 148 times that of a pure mpg-C3N4/CNT sample. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of effectively promoted separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and enhanced H2-evolution kinetics. The co-loading of nanocarbon materials and earth-abundant co-catalysts onto metal-free mpg-C3N4 photocatalysts offers great potential for practical applications in photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light illumination.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, to effectively meet increasing global energy demands and alleviate the energy crisis, there is an urgent need for large-scale development of advanced sustainable and renewable energies such as solar and wind power, which can serve as cost-effective and environmentally potential alternatives to conventional fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it is well known that hydrogen has long been considered one of the most attractive and most promising clean energy carriers due to its high enthalpy value and benign combustion product (water).1 Among various facile technologies for hydrogen production, solar water splitting over suspended photocatalysts represents an ideal process for generating clean hydrogen (H2) fuel from renewable resources because it provides one of the best solutions to solve both energy and environmental issues.2–4 In particular, since Fujishima and Honda first revealed the photoelectrochemical water splitting over a TiO2 electrode in 1972,5 photocatalytic hydrogen production using solar energy has been attracting more and more attention as a very important area of research.6,7 To date, many kinds of powdered photocatalysts and heterogeneous photocatalytic systems for efficient solar hydrogen production have been exploited, but none of them could satisfy all the requirements for practical solar hydrogen generation, such as low cost, nontoxicity, high visible-light activity and good durability.7 In order to address these issues and achieve the practical photocatalytic hydrogen production, it is necessary to precisely control the composition and structure of these existing semiconductor materials through various engineering strategies, besides the development of novel visible-light-driven photocatalysts with high quantum efficiency and good photostability.7
In 2009, a cheap and nontoxic metal-free polymeric-like carbon nitride with a graphitic structure (g-C3N4) was first found to be active in photocatalytic water splitting under visible light illumination by Wang's group.8 Since then, g-C3N4 has been extensively applied in the various photocatalytic and photovoltaic fields during the past several years, such as photocatalytic degradation,9,10 photocatalytic H2 production,11–14 photocatalytic CO2 reduction,7,15–20 photocatalytic organic synthesis21,22 and solar cells.23,24 In general, the g-C3N4 with a narrow indirect band gap of about 2.7 eV possesses suitable conduction band (CB, at −1.3 V at pH 7) and valence band (VB, at 1.4 V at pH 7) positions for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen production, respectively.11–13,25 However, the pure C3N4 usually exhibits insufficient absorbance for visible light, poor electrical conductivity, low specific surface area and fast recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, significantly limiting its practical application.26,27 To efficiently overcome these limitations, it is crucial to further boost the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 through suitable engineering strategies, such as fabricating different nanostructures,28–31 doping with metal or non-metal elements,16,22,32–34 loading co-catalysts,18,35,36 increasing the specific surface area (or introducing mesoporosity),37,38 sensitizing by organic dyes,39–42 creating heterojunctions43–45 and their combinations.46
To make the g-C3N4 more active for heterogeneous photocatalytic H2 evolution, the enhancements in its surface active sites and the lifetime of photo-generated electrons are of great significance for improving the surface H2-evolution kinetics during the photocatalytic processes. On the one hand, the surface active sites of g-C3N4 could be greatly enhanced through loading co-catalysts or constructing mesoporous structures, thus leading to improved H2-evolution activity. For example, it was demonstrated that introducing mesoporosity into g-C3N4 through the silica-templated self-polymerization route could enhance its hydrogen production rate by a factor of 10 in the presence of Pt co-catalysts, due to the formation of a mesoporous and crystallized g-C3N4 framework with high surface area.38 Furthermore, other Pt-free co-catalysts such as Ag2S,47 MoS2,48,49 WS2,50 Au,51 NiSx,52–55 CoS,56 Cu(OH)236 and Ni(OH)235 have also been demonstrated to be capable of remarkably enhancing the photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of g-C3N4. Especially, Ni-based materials as H2-evolution co-catalysts have received much attention because of their low cost, earth-abundant elements and excellent photocatalytic activity.7,57,58 Recently, Xu and co-workers reported that the photocatalytic H2-evolution activity over the optimal NiS (1.1 wt%)/g-C3N4 photocatalyst was 253 times that of the pristine g-C3N4.53 In addition, the hybridization of nanocarbon materials (such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene) and g-C3N4 also provides an efficient strategy to boost the photocatalytic H2-evolution rate of g-C3N4 due to the improved electrical conductivity, promoted charge separation, enhanced light-harvesting capacity and increased reactive sites.14,59–61 Generally, loading of CNTs or graphene could help achieve a significant activity enhancement (enhanced about 2–4 times) in the presence or absence of Pt co-catalysts.14,62–64 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on photocatalytic H2-production over hybrid mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites modified by noble-metal free NiS co-catalysts.
Here, for the first time, hybrid mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile template method, and were then loaded with NiS co-catalysts through a simple direct precipitation process. Compared to the hybrid mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites, significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic H2-production activity could be achieved through the loading of NiS co-catalysts. The effect of the loading content of NiS on the photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution activity was investigated and discussed in detail. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was also proposed.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Syntheses of the mpg-C3N4/CNTs
All chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further purification. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs; purity, >95%; diameter, 40–60 nm; length, 5–15 μm; specific surface area, 40–300 m2 g−1) prepared by catalytic decomposition of CH4 using La2NiO4 as a catalyst precursor were provided by Shenzhen Nanoport Co., Ltd (NPT). Cyanamide was obtained from Aldrich.
The metal-free mpg-C3N4/CNT hybrid powders were synthesized via a sol–gel method. In a typical synthesis, 0.1 g of CNT powder (with an optimum content of 6.8 wt% in the mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites; the detailed data are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1–S5†) was dispersed in 5 ml of cyanamide aqueous solution (50%) by sonication for 20 min and then slowly adding 5 ml of silica sol (12 nm) to the same beaker under stirring. After stirring for 5 h at room temperature, the mixture was transferred to a 20 ml porcelain crucible and dried for 1 h at 60 °C to obtain a jelly-like gel. Then, the samples were calcined at 550 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 4 h, with a heating rate of 2.3 °C min−1. After washing the calcined yellow sample with 100 mL NH4HF2 solution for 24 h, the SiO2 nanoparticles were removed. Finally, the product was harvested by centrifugation and washed with water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried for 12 h at 60 °C in a vacuum oven.
2.2 Syntheses of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS
The mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS samples were prepared through a simple direct precipitation process. The detailed synthesis parameters are shown in Table 1. Typically, 0.3 g mpg-C3N4/CNT was dispersed in 60 ml of water by sonication for 30 min, and 0.660 mL of 0.05 M nickel acetate solution was added subsequently. After stirring for 1 h, the NiS was formed by the addition of 3.305 mL of 0.05 M Na2S solution dropwise, and the theoretical quality ratio of NiS was 1%.

2.3. Material characterization
The structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, D/max 2500v/pc) and transmission electron microscopy (JEOL-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV). A Shimadzu spectrophotometer (model 2501 PC) equipped with an integrating sphere was used to record the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a VG ESCALAB250 surface analysis system using a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (300 W, 5 mA, and 15 kV). The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The shift of the binding energy owing to relative surface charging was corrected using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on a Gemini-2360 analyzer (Micromeritics Co., USA) at 77 K. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to determine the specific surface area. The pore-size distributions were derived from the desorption branches of the isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded on an F20 S-TWIN electron microscope (Tecnai G2, FEI Co.), at 200 kV accelerating voltage. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using an LS 50B (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA) with an excitation wavelength of 363 nm at room temperature.
2.4. Photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments
Photocatalytic water splitting was carried out in a LabSolar H2 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system (Perfectlight, Beijing) including a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech). In a typical reaction, 50 mg of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite was dispersed in a Pyrex glass reactor containing the solution mixed with 90 mL water and 10 mL triethanolamine (TEOA). Then, the system was sealed and vacuumized to keep the pressure at −0.1 MPa. Afterwards, a circular cooling water system was turned on and the reactor was irradiated with a Xe lamp (300 W) under magnetic stirring. The gases evolved were analyzed online with a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, TCD, with N2 as a carrier gas) after 0.5 h of illumination. The reaction was continued for 3 h. A cyclic experiment was carried out to investigate the photocatalytic stability of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite. After 3 h of reaction, H2 produced was evacuated and then run for another 3 h.
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
A working electrode was prepared as follows: 0.05 g of the sample was ground with 2 mL absolute ethanol and 20 μL of 0.25% Nafion solution. 500 μL of the mixture was coated onto a 2 × 6 cm2 fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) glass by a drop casting method, and then dried in an oven and calcined at 150 °C for 1 h in a N2 gas flow to obtain working electrodes. Photocurrents were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (BAS100 Instruments) in a standard three-electrode system by using the prepared film as the working electrode, a Pt flake as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode. A 300 W Xe-lamp served as a light source, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the above-mentioned working electrodes in the three-electrode system were also recorded via a computer controlled IM6e impedance measurement unit (Zahner Elektrik, Germany) over a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 5 mV under visible light illumination. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions were used as the electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD characterization
The structure and composition of all mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS samples were initially investigated by XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the mpg-C3N4/CNT samples with different NiS contents. As observed from the XRD patterns in Fig. 1, all the samples exhibit a similar rectangular shape with one typical (002) interlayer-stacking diffraction peak at 27.5°. Clearly, this high-intensity diffraction peak identified in all patterns represents the graphite-like stacking of the conjugated aromatic units in C3N4 layers, corresponding well to the interlayer d-spacing (0.336 nm) of g-C3N4.8 It is also noted that the weakest diffraction peak at 13.04° was also observed, corresponding to the (100) peak that arises from the in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units (with an interplanar separation of 0.672 nm).39,44 In addition, no other noticeable diffraction peaks corresponding to CNTs (an apparent XRD peak at 26.2°)65 or NiS were detected from the XRD pattern of all mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite samples in Fig. 1, which may presumably be attributed to the low contents and highly selective dispersion of the loaded CNTs and/or NiS nanoparticles in the composite samples.59 It can also be observed from the XRD results that the loading of CNTs and NiS nanoparticles has no significant influence on the structure of mpg-C3N4, and no additional diffraction peak can be detected.

3.2 TEM characterization
The morphology and microstructure of mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS samples were further observed by TEM. TEM images of mpg-C3N4/CNT and mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS are displayed in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, mpg-C3N4 exhibits a typical layered platelet-like and porous morphology after the removal of SiO2 templates. Furthermore, the high dispersion of CNTs in the mpg-C3N4 was achieved, which could lead to the formation of intimate interactions between CNTs and mpg-C3N4, thus facilitating effective charge separation and photocatalytic activity enhancements. In addition, it is observed from Fig. 2B that many dark NiS nanoparticles with a diameter of 5–20 nm were highly deposited on the surface of the flake mpg-C3N4. The results are in good agreement with the reported ones for the g-C3N4/NiS hybrid photocatalysts prepared via an in situ template-free ion-exchange process.52 Clearly, these NiS nanoparticles were directly grown in the voids of mpg-C3N4 or on the surface of CNTs. The intimate interface contacts between NiS and mpg-C3N4 (or CNTs) are crucial for efficient charge transfer. As potential active sites, these NiS nanoparticles can take advantage of the photo-generated electrons on the surface of mpg-C3N4 or CNTs, thus fundamentally promoting the H2-evolution kinetics.

To further confirm the formation of the intimate interface contacts in the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS ternary hybrid sample, the measured TEM and HRTEM images of the as-prepared mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS are shown in Fig. 3. Obviously, as shown in Fig. 3B, the clear lattice fringes of NiS nanoparticles, CNTs and 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets could be readily identified. It is observed from Fig. 3B that the obtained g-C3N4 crystallites exhibited a lattice spacing of about 0.336 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of hexagonal g-C3N4 (JCPDS 87-1526).44 Furthermore, the HRTEM images (Fig. 3B and C) of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS nanocomposite also showed lattice fringe spacings of 0.33 nm and 0.223 nm, which can be assigned to the (002) plane of CNTs and the (211) plane of millerite NiS (JCPDS #02-0693), respectively.4 The HRTEM results clearly demonstrated the formation of intimate heterostructures in the ternary nanocomposites instead of a simple physical mixture of three components. Thus, the intimate interface contacts of NiS, CNTs and mpg-C3N4 could be verified, which facilitate the vectorial transfer of charge carriers among three components, therefore greatly enhancing the charge separation and the photocatalytic efficiency.

3.3 XPS analysis
In order to further study the chemical composition and oxidation state of NiS, CNTs and mpg-C3N4 in the ternary composites, XPS measurements were also carried out, as depicted in Fig. 4A–E. The XPS survey spectrum of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS sample is shown in Fig. 4A, obviously indicating the co-existence of the elements C, N, Ni, and S and a small amount of O. The corresponding high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, S 2p and Ni 2p of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS sample are shown in Fig. 4B–E, respectively. Clearly, the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectra in Fig. 4B have two distinct peaks with a binding energy of 284.9 and 288.5 eV. The satellite peak at 284.9 eV is ascribed to the sp2 C–C bonds from graphitic carbon adsorbed on the surface and the C–C bond from CNTs, indicating the formation of interactions between CNTs and mpg-C3N4.59 On the contrary, the main peak located at 288.5 eV could be attributed to the sp2-bonded carbon in the triazine rings (N–CN), suggesting the major carbon environment in the mpg-C3N4.66 As observed in Fig. 4C, the main peak of the N 1s spectra at 398.9 eV obviously shows an asymmetrical feature, further confirming the presence of sp2-bonded N in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN) in the mpg-C3N4. In addition, the obtained S 2p and Ni 2p XPS results (Fig. 4D and E) can confirm the formation of surface NiS. The binding energies of the weak peak of Ni 2p3/2 are found at 857.9 eV, which should be attributed to those of Ni 2p3/2 in NiS.66 The minor peak of S 2p at 161.1 eV and the major peak at 164.2 eV are close to those of NiS.52,66 All the above results further confirmed the formation of a ternary hybrid composite composed of mpg-C3N4, CNTs and NiS.

3.4 Textural properties
The surface areas and porous structures of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite were also measured by using nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. Fig. 5 shows all the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K and the corresponding pore size distribution curves. The pore size distribution was obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherms by the BJH method. As can be seen clearly in Fig. 5, three studied samples exhibit a typical type-IV adsorption–desorption isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, suggesting the presence of mesoporous structures.67 It is generally believed that the Type H3 hysteresis loop is associated with capillary condensation taking place in slit-shaped mesopores, which may originate from the aggregates of plate-like mpg-C3N4 sheets. The corresponding pore size distribution curves further confirm that the all three samples are mesoporous materials with a mean pore diameter in the range of 10–20 nm (inset in Fig. 5). The textural parameters of three photocatalysts are summarized in Table 2. As seen from Table 2, all samples exhibit a mean pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm, indicating their mesoporous structures. Furthermore, the loading of NiS onto the mpg-C3N4/CNT photocatalyst could lead to a significant decrease in the BET specific surface, mean pore diameter and pore volume, which may be due to the formation of NiS nanoparticles in the mesopores of mpg-C3N4.68 In addition, it should be noted that the surface area and pore volume of the mpg-C3N4/CNT composite are obviously much smaller than those of pure mpg-C3N4, which may be due to the fact that the addition of CNTs has a negative influence on the homogeneous copolymerization of cyanamide molecules and the formation of mesopores. These data suggest that the enhancements in the surface areas and pore volume are not the key factors for boosting the photocatalytic activity of mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS.69

3.5 UV-vis absorption spectra
The optical properties of the as-obtained mpg-C3N4/CNT and mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite samples were determined by using UV-vis absorption spectra. The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra of the mpg-C3N4/CNT samples with different NiS contents are shown in Fig. 6. As observed from Fig. 6, it is clear that the spectra of mpg-C3N4/CNT display an absorption edge at about 455 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.72 eV. It is also noted that the introduction of NiS co-catalysts could not lead to a significant shift of the absorption edge, implying that the NiS co-catalysts were only loaded on the surface of mpg-C3N4/CNT. Furthermore, the absorption intensity in the visible region (over 460 nm) in the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite samples is gradually enhanced with increasing the loading content of NiS. Therefore, it is obvious that the introduction of NiS co-catalysts play an additional role in increasing the visible-light absorption of composites, which may also be beneficial for the enhancement of visible-light photocatalytic H2-evolution activities.

3.6 Photocatalytic activities and stability
The photocatalytic H2-evolution activity of all the samples was evaluated under the visible light conditions (λ ≥ 420 nm) and using 10% triethanolamine aqueous solution as a hole sacrificial reagent. No H2 production was detected without photocatalysts or light irradiation, indicating that H2 was generated by the photocatalytic reactions. It was also demonstrated that pure mpg-C3N4 is inactive for photocatalytic H2 production under visible light irradiation under current conditions. Fig. 7 shows the time profiles and the average rate for the photocatalytic H2 evolution over mpg-C3N4/CNT with different co-catalysts under visible-light irradiation with simulated solar light. It can be noted that the rates of photocatalytic H2 evolution increased with the irradiation time for all samples. As shown in Fig. 7B, the average hydrogen evolution rate of mpg-C3N4/CNT/3% NiS reaches 378 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 1.37 and 12.2 times those of mpg-C3N4/CNT/3% CoS and mpg-C3N4/CNT/3% CuS, respectively. Clearly, compared to CoS and CuS, NiS is the best H2-evolution co-catalyst for the mpg-C3N4/CNT.

Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.05 g; 10 mL triethanolamine; 90 mL distilled water; light source, a xenon lamp (300 W) with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). 
To further optimize the H2-evolution rate over the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composites, ternary mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS hybrids with different loading contents of NiS were also fabricated and evaluated. As shown in Fig. 8A, all mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composites exhibit better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance than the pure mpg-C3N4/CNT sample. The average hydrogen evolution rates of all mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composites are shown in Fig. 8B. Clearly, the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS composite exhibits the highest H2-evolution rate of 521 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 148 times as high as that of mpg-C3N4/CNT. Clearly, the photocatalytic activity increases with increasing NiS loading when it is smaller than 1 wt%. However, when the loading content of NiS is more than 1 wt%, a further increase in the NiS content will lead to a significant reduction of the photocatalytic H2-evolution rate. This decrease can be ascribed to the light scattering and mask effects, which will reduce the light utilization efficiency. In addition, excess NiS nanoparticles can also act as recombination centers of photo-generated electrons and holes, thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity.

Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.05 g; 10 mL triethanolamine; 90 mL distilled water; light source, a xenon lamp (300 W) with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). 
The stability and reusability of mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS for photocatalytic H2 production were evaluated by repeating the photocatalytic experiments under the same conditions for five cycles. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 9. It is found that obvious deactivation in the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity is detected for the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS composite after continuous visible-light irradiation. After three cycles, the amount of generated hydrogen became stable and was around 65% after the first cycle. The decreased activity might be due to the slow breakdown of the NiS nanoparticles from mpg-C3N4 or CNTs surfaces. Similar phenomena can be found in the other g-C3N4-based photocatalysts loaded with different co-catalysts such as NiS254 and Ag2S.47 Nevertheless, the rate in the fifth cycle is still higher than that of 3 wt% Pt loaded mpg-C3N4 in the first cycle (as shown in Fig. 8). Obviously, the photocatalytic H2-evolution activity over 3 wt% Pt loaded mpg-C3N4 (275 μmol g−1 h−1) in this study is much smaller than the reported value in the literature (1490 μmol g−1 h−1),38 which may be due to the fact that the different preparation processes for mpg-C3N4 in our group led to its smaller surface areas and pore volume, as compared to those reported. However, under similar conditions, the comparisons in our group can clearly reveal that the noble-metal free NiS represents a promising kind of co-catalyst for promoting H2 production under visible light irradiation.

3.7 Possible mechanism of photocatalytic H2 evolution
In order to further understand the role of NiS in charge carrier separation, the photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra of all samples were also investigated. In general, it is accepted that the PL spectra can be used to evaluate the charge migration, transfer and recombination processes in photo-excited semiconductors.3,42,70 As shown in Fig. 10, the PL emission intensity of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS composite is the lowest of all, indicating the fastest separation efficiency of charge carriers. This is because a suitable loading content of NiS co-catalysts, as both active sites and electron transfer channels, can effectively suppress the recombination of the photo-generated electrons and holes, thereby lowering the fluorescence intensity. However, when the loading content of NiS is too high, the excess NiS co-catalysts can act as recombination centers of photo-generated electrons and holes, thus accelerating their recombination instead of separation. These results show that the synergistic effect between mpg-C3N4, CNTs and NiS could promote more efficient separation of photo-generated charge carriers, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the photocatalytic H2-evolution activity.

To further verify the improved charge separation, photocurrent responses were also recorded. It is known that the transient photocurrent responses of a given photocatalyst may strongly depend on the charge collection and separation efficiency of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs.16,42 The transient photocurrent responses of mpg-C3N4/CNT and mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS samples were measured in the light on–off process. Fig. 11 shows the PEC I-t curves of mpg-C3N4/CNT and mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS electrodes under intermittent visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) at a bias potential of 0.6 V. All of the samples exhibited prompt and reproducible photocurrent responses on each illumination, while the photocurrent value will quickly decrease to zero once the light turns off, revealing that the photocurrent was reproducible. Clearly, the photocurrent of mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS sample is much higher than that of the mpg-C3N4/CNT sample, further confirming the more efficient interfacial mobility and separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs for the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS composite sample.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, presented as Nyquist plots) has also been investigated to provide sufficient evidence for the interfacial charge transfer resistance and separation efficiency. Generally, it is believed that the smaller arc radius on the EIS Nyquist plot represents a more effective separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and a higher efficiency of charge immigration across the electrode/electrolyte interface.42Fig. 12 shows the EIS Nyquist plots of mpg-C3N4/CNT and mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS composites. As shown in Fig. 12, it is observed that the semicircle's diameter in the Nyquist plots of mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS is much smaller than that of mpg-C3N4/CNT, indicating the lower resistance and the faster interfacial charge transfer. The results are in good accordance with the photocatalytic-activity measurements, PL and transient photocurrent results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the faster interfacial transfer and separation of photo-generated charges are important reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic H2-evolution activities of the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS composite.

On the basis of all the above results, a possible mechanism of photocatalytic H2 evolution and charge transfer over the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS nanocomposites under visible-light irradiation can be proposed. As shown in Scheme 1, the mpg-C3N4 could be excited using visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) and produce the photo-generated electron–hole pairs due to its narrower band gap. It is known that the conduction band (CB) position of mpg-C3N4 is much more negative than the work function (4.3 eV) for CNTs.4 Consequently, once the Schottky-type junction between mpg-C3N4 and conductive CNTs is constructed, effective charge separation for photo-excited electrons from mpg-C3N4 to the conducting network of CNTs could be achieved. Therefore, the photo-induced electrons in the CB of mpg-C3N4 and on the surface of CNTs could effectively drive the photocatalytic H2-evolution on the NiS co-catalysts as active sites, respectively. Meanwhile, the holes on the valence band of mpg-C3N4 can be directly consumed by the surface reaction of sacrificial reagent oxidation (TEOA) under visible light irradiation. As a result, effectively promoted separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs and enhanced H2-evolution kinetics could be achieved, thus leading to significant enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolution activity over the NiS co-catalyst modified metal-free mpg-C3N4/CNT nanocomposites.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the mpg-C3N4/CNT/NiS composite was synthesized by a two-step strategy of the sol–gel method (for the loading of CNTs) and the precipitation process (for the loading of NiS), respectively. The results showed that the mpg-C3N4/CNT/1% NiS nanocomposite exhibits the best photocatalytic activity with a H2-evolution of about 521 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm), which is almost 148 times that of the pure mpg-C3N4/CNT sample. It is believed that the NiS co-catalysts can effectively suppress the recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes and accelerate the photocatalytic H2-evolution kinetics. In this work, the improved photocatalytic H2-evolution activity of C3N4-based materials could be achieved via the co-loading of noble-metal free NiS and carbonaceous nanomaterials, which may provide a promising class of photocatalyst candidates for photocatalytic H2-production and solar energy conversion.
