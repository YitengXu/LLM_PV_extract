Analyst, 1979, 104, 232-240Determination of selenium in soil digests by non-dispersive atomic-fluorescence spectrometry using an argon-hydrogen flame and the hydride generation technique(Note: The full text of this document is currently only available in the PDF Version )J. Azad, G. F. Kirkbright and R. D. SnookAbstractThe determination of selenium at submicrogram levels by atomic-fluorescence spectrometry, based on the evolution of hydrogen selenide into an argon-hydrogen air-entrained flame, is described. Using a simple purpose-built non-dispersive atomic-fluorescence spectrometer a detection limit of 10 ng cm–3 of selenium is obtained. The technique has been applied to the determination of selenium in soil digests and experiments have been carried out in order to study the interference of other elements on the determination. Procedures for the elimination of interferences from copper are recommended.
