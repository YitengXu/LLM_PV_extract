    AbstractTransition metal silicides represent an extremely broad set of refractory materials that are currently employed for many applications including CMOS devices, thin film coatings, bulk structural components, electrical heating elements, photovoltaics, and thermoelectrics. Many of these applications may be improved by making 1-dimensional nanomaterials. Chemical synthesis of silicide nanowires is more complicated compared to other classes of nanomaterials due to the complex phase behaviour between metals and silicon and the complex stoichiometries and structures of their resulting compounds. Recently, several synthetic strategies have been developed to overcome this challenge resulting in increasing reports of silicide nanowires in the literature. These strategies are highlighted in this feature article, along with future synthetic challenges and a review of the applications emerging from current silicide nanowires.Andrew SchmittAndrew Schmitt received his BA from DePauw University in 2004 and his PhD in 2009 working in the Song Jin research group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Introduction
Metal silicides, the family of refractory, intermetallic compounds between metals and silicon, have diverse physical properties that are both very useful and fundamentally significant. The metallic silicides1,2 such as NiSi, CoSi2, and TiSi2 provide ohmic contact,3 interconnect, and gate materials4 to CMOS microelectronic transistors. Semiconducting silicides5 have been extensively investigated for silicon-based optoelectronics6 such as LEDs7 and IR detectors.8 The narrow bandgap semiconducting silicides, in particular CrSi2, β-FeSi2, MnSi1.8, and ReSi1.75, have been targeted and used (β-FeSi2) for robust, stable, and inexpensive thermoelectric materials,5,9 and have shown promise for photovoltaic10,11 applications.
In addition to finding numerous technological applications, metal silicides have fascinated physicists for over 70 years and continue turning up surprises at the frontiers of theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics. The so-called B20 metal monosilicides (MSi, M = iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn)) are a group of highly correlated electron materials.12,13 For example, FeSi is the only known transition metal Kondo insulator,12 a class of heavy-electron compounds exhibiting Kondo lattice behavior at room temperature but having an insulating ground state with a small energy gap. MnSi, long thought of as a classical itinerant ferromagnet and the poster child of metal physics, has recently been discovered to have a quantum critical phase transition16 and has been observed to exhibit non-Fermi liquid behavior.17 These monosilicides and their alloys, Fe1−x−yCoxMnySi (0 < x, y <1) also display a myriad of magnetic behaviours, including unusual helical magnetic ordering,18–20 and even more exotic Skyrmion magnetic phases.21,22 Furthermore, FexCo1−xSi alloys were recently discovered to be magnetic semiconductors,23,24 bringing exciting prospects of CMOS compatible silicon-based25 spintronics, a growing field that seeks to exploit the spin properties instead of or in addition to the charge degree of freedom in electronic and photonic devices.26
Transition metal silicides fall into a general class of solid state compounds referred to as intermetallics. Intermetallic compounds, composed of at least two metallic elements and optional non-metal components, often have complicated crystal structures. Because of this they are increasingly finding potential applications in a variety of fields, for example, the use of Heussler alloys in spintronics, Nowotny chimney ladder phases in thermoelectrics, and superalloys in structural materials. Structure-property relationships in such compounds are often quite interesting and extremely doping dependent.
New physical phenomena and interesting applications often arise from the reduction of material dimensions to nanoscale.27,28 During the nanotechnology revolution of the past decade, 1-dimensional (1-D) nanowire (NW) materials28–33 have enjoyed prominent attention and success. Single-crystalline NWs can be chemically synthesized from the bottom-up with precisely controlled structures, diameters, lengths, chemical compositions and doping/electronic properties using a variety of methods including the nanocluster catalyzed vapour-liquid-solid (VLS)34 growth process, the most common method for 1-D nanostructure synthesis. These 1-D nanomaterials exhibit diverse device behaviour enabling the successful demonstration of many electronic, photonic, and other functional devices35 following the bottom-up paradigm of nanotechnology.36
Efforts thus far have concentrated on semiconductor channel materials, but metallic contact and gate materials are equally important for continued scaling of CMOS devices.37 NWs of CMOS compatible metallic silicides having low resistivity and suitable work functions, such as nickel silicides,4,38 would serve as superior interconnect and gate contacts for nanoelectronic architectures. High quality single crystal semiconducting NWs, such as the half-metallic Fe1−xCoxSi alloys, will lay the nanomaterials foundation for the exploration of many technologically relevant fields including silicon-based spintronic nanodevices. Since correlations are intimately influenced by length scales and symmetry12,13 reducing size and dimensionality in the monosilicides and their alloys could lead to interesting new physical phenomena that theoretical physicists have not yet considered. Semiconducting silicides are also known for being robust and inexpensive thermoelectric materials. The most notable are MnSi1.839,40 and ReSi1.7541,42 with reported figure of merit (ZT) values up to 0.7 and 0.8 in the bulk, respectively. These silicides, along with others such as Ru2Si3 and their alloys,43 belong to defect structure types which can have quite large unit cells; one example, the “Nowotny chimney ladder” phases, have tetragonal structures which can have one lattice constant as large as tens of nanometers.44–46 It has been predicted47 and experimentally confirmed48–51 that dimensional reduction of semiconductors enhances ZT relative to the bulk values due to surface phonon scattering and/or quantum confinement.
Due to their interesting properties and potential applications, we initiated a research program in 2005 to develop free-standing silicide NWs, that to date include FeSi,52 CoSi,53 Fe1−xCoxSi,54 MnSi1.8,55 CrSi2,56 Ni2Si,57 and Ni3Si.58 The rational synthesis of NWs from the vapour phase has two fundamental challenges:28,30,59 1) delivery of source materials and 2) anisotropic crystal growth to form 1-D nanostructures. Free-standing transition metal silicide nanowire synthesis has been primarily limited by the lack of a general growth scheme such as in VLS grown semiconducting NWs (group IV elements and normal valence compounds such as the II–VI and III–V compounds) that exhibit simple phase behaviour with low melting eutectics (Fig. 1a) that serve as a VLS catalytic system. General and rational chemical synthesis of silicide nanomaterials is challenging, due in part to the multiple stoichiometries and complex phase behaviour exhibited by many silicide compounds.60 For instance, there are six known iron silicide intermetallic compounds (Fe3Si, Fe2Si, Fe5Si3, FeSi, α-FeSi2, β-FeSi2) only three of which are stable at room temperature (Fig. 1b).60 In such complicated materials systems careful control over synthesized phases can be quite difficult. In the last five years, several techniques have been developed for the synthesis of free-standing silicide NWs by ourselves and many other researchers, which can be conveniently categorized into four groups: silicidation of silicon (Si) NWs, decomposition of silicon on metal thin films, reaction of metals with silicon substrates, and deposition of both metal and silicon via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or chemical vapour transport (CVT).

Today of the eight transition metals that been reported to form silicide NWs, four have more than one reported NW phase (Table 1) in the NW literature. Other examples of solvothermal nanorods61 and self-assembled epitaxial silicide NWs,63,64,65 mostly of rare earth silicides on vicinal silicon surfaces, do exist; but, these silicide nanomaterials are distinctively different from the free-standing silicide NWs and not the subject of this feature article. Herein we review the general approaches to the rational chemical synthesis, in a comprehensive manner, of metal silicide nanowires and discuss their current and potential future applications.

Growth techniques
Silicidation of silicon nanowires
Lieber and co-workers reported what was perhaps the first report of transition metal silicide NWs (Fig. 2a).62 A Si NW backbone, formed using a standard Au nanoparticle mediated VLS process, was covered with a thermally evaporated Ni thin film. Subsequent annealing in forming gas produced single-crystalline NiSi NWs via solid state reaction. Furthermore, epitaxial heterojunctions of NiSi and Si were demonstrated allowing the integration of high performance nanowire transistors beyond the lithographic limit. The main challenges in silicide NW formation, material delivery and 1-D anisotropic growth, were overcome independently using this methodology. This work was easily extended to other metals such as Fe to form FeSi, α-FeSi2, and β-FeSi2 NWs66 and platinum (Pt) resulting in PtSi NWs.67 However, the nanowires produced in these latter cases were not single crystals.
 Fig. 2  Preparation of NiSi NWs by silicidation. a1) Si NWs (blue) are synthesized via VLS and a2) coated with Ni metal (green), a3) reacted at 550 °C to form NiSi nanowires (orange). a4) Extra Ni metal is etched away leaving single crystalline NiSi NWs.62 b) Preparation of NiSi NWs by point contact silicidation to form NiSi–Si NW heterostructures. 
Other researchers have focused on the in situ observation of the silicidation process using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).68,69 In these experiments VLS grown Si NWs are drop-cast with transition metal nanowires, nickel68 or cobalt,69 onto TEM grids in high enough concentration to guarantee direct contact between two different nanostructures (Fig. 2b). For the case of nickel (Ni), which is an extremely fast diffusing species in silicon (0.6 µm/s at 400 °C),70 Ni atoms “dissolve” into the Si NW at the rapid rate of 1 µm/min. This results in a saturated Ni–Si solid solution until NiSi crystals nucleate at the NW ends. The Si NW is then converted to NiSi one atomic plane at a time until the entire wire becomes fully silicided. Furthermore, highly strained (12%) single-crystalline Si segments can be formed between growing NiSi crystals. In the case of in situ silicidation of Si NWs by Co, the phase first nucleated was highly temperature dependent. At low temperature (700 °C) CoSi nucleated while higher temperature (800 °C) led to CoSi2 nucleation. These phases each showed different MSi/Si interfacial behaviour and radically different axial growth rates. Though likely low throughput as a synthetic method, silicidation of Si NWs is an excellent way to directly observe the silicide nucleation process and may be important in understanding the growth mechanisms employed in other MSi NW synthesis schemes. It is also an excellent method to produce MSi/Si heterostructures.
The stoichiometry of silicided NWs could likely be controlled by carefully managing the quantity of evaporated metal; however, certain phases will probably be unobtainable through this technique due to the kinetics of the diffusion process, as is true in thin film and bulk diffusion couples. Such diffusion couples between metals and silicon have been widely studied1,2,71 and the phases formed can often be predicted by empirical rules such as the so-called “first phase rule”.72 The rule, based on a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, states that the transition metal silicide formed in a binary diffusion couple is the highest melting temperature congruently melting phase nearest the lowest melting temperature eutectic point in the binary phase diagram.72 However, it does not appear this rule holds well in the case of diffusion based silicide NW formation as Ni2Si and Co2Si are the predicted first phases in the careful in situ studies, but NiSi and CoSi seem to be the first phases formed. In the case of evaporated metal diffusing into Si NWs FeSi is the predicted first phase which is observed, but Pt2Si is the predicted phase while PtSi is actually observed. Predicted phases based on this rule for silicide NW formation are italicized in Table 1, along with phases observed thus far in the nanowire literature (bold) for comparison.
Delivery of silicon to metal films
In lieu of using a Si NW backbone, the first challenge of silicide NW growth (source material delivery) must be addressed. One way to accomplish this for binary systems is to deliver either the Si or the metal and use the other as a substrate. This approach can be advantageous as fewer gas phase species simplifies the experiments. A scheme for the delivery of Si using silane precursors was easily adopted from the wealth of reports detailing CVD synthesis of silicon NWs.73,74 Synthetic strategies emerged for the decomposition of SiH4 on metal thin films or through using vapour phase elemental silicon through evaporation or sputtering resulting in free-standing silicide NWs.70,75–80 Interestingly, to date this strategy has only been reported for NWs of nickel silicides: NiSi2,79 NiSi,76,77,80 Ni2Si,70,79,80 Ni3Si2,78 Ni31Si12,81 and Ni3Si75 (all of the room temperature stable nickel silicide phases). Even with reports dating back to 2004,79 little significant work has been done in this time to uncover the mechanism behind this particular growth method. A possible reason that this strategy has been reported only for nickel silicides is the extremely fast diffusivity of Ni in Si.70 Many transition metals can be used to catalyze Si NW growth via either the VLS mechanism60 or the vapour-solid-solid (VSS) mechanism.74 Ni itself is actually one of the earliest reported VLS catalysts for Si NW growth.82 Either nanocrystals of NiSi2 phase (through which Si is the dominant diffuser) or low temperatures must be employed to prevent the dissolution of Ni catalyst into the silicon material before wire formation occurs. If higher temperatures and a practically limitless metal source (metal substrate or thick film) are used, nickel silicide NWs are observed.
The growth of Ni2Si NWs on a Ni thin film (Fig. 3) is one of the more complete analyses of this silicide NW synthesis method.70 Generally, silane decomposes onto the Ni surface leading to the growth and elongation of Ni2Si nanocrystals. These nanocrystals continue to elongate decreasing the available area for Ni diffusion along the surface. Eventually the Ni incorporation rate through diffusion equals the rate of silane decomposition (or Si addition), resulting in the formation and propagation of thin, untapered Ni2Si NWs. Kang and co-workers have also showed that NixO layers can be used to help control the initial stages of 1-D growth by serving as a diffusion barrier for Ni.80
 Fig. 3  Preparation of Ni2Si NWs using silane gas precursor and Ni foil. (a) Ni diffusion is faster than silane decomposition, creating nanoparticles on the surface of the metal film. (b) As more Si decomposes, Ni metal from the substrate has to diffuse further into the crystalline material, creating an elongated structure. (c) The rates of metal diffusion and silane decomposition are comparable and single crystalline NWs form. (d) NWs with constant diameter are propagated during growth.70 
In spite of its simplicity, only nickel silicides have been produced using this technique, serving as a strong indicator of the role of diffusion in this process. Other silicides might be formed using this method if higher temperatures are used to activate diffusion, but alternative silicon precursors with elevated decomposition temperatures would be required.
Reactions of transition metal sources with silicon substrates
One could react transition metal species directly with silicon substrates to make silicide NWs. While a variety of simple organometallic complexes are known to decompose to deliver metal,83 to date only pure metal vapours and anhydrous metal halides have been used to yield free-standing metal silicide NWs.
Metal vapour
Chueh and co-workers initially reported the synthesis of short (0.2–2 µm) TaSi2 NWs via annealing silicon substrates with FeSi2 thin films or FeSi2 nanodots on their surface in a tantalum (Ta) atmosphere.84 It was believed that Si atoms segregate from either the FeSi2 thin film or nanodots to form a nanoparticulate Si base. Ta atoms adsorb onto the surface of either the FeSi2 thin films or nanodots and react with Si diffusing through the substrate to form TaSi2 nanocrystals. Because of the high temperatures and low pressures used, certain facets are favoured and one-dimensional growth is observed. The use of a different silicide film can increase the aspect ratio of generated NWs;85 however, in all cases the metal impurity from the starting silicide thin film (or nanodots) is found in the final product, accounting for as much as 10% of the total elemental content. Other work reported by the same group provides insight; annealing similar FeSi2 substrates in the absence of Ta vapour but under higher temperature conditions produces silicon NWs.86 This result is not surprising considering the well known use of Fe and its metal silicides as VLS or VSS catalysts for the growth of Si NWs; Fe was one of the first VLS catalysts reported.73,82 These metal silicide particles likely served as both the 1-D catalyst and path for incorporation of Si from the substrate. Considering the work done on silicidation of Si nanowires, it is probable that the TaSi2 NWs were formed by the silicidation of silicon nanowires either as they are formed or shortly thereafter. This method of silicide NW growth requires high temperatures (950 °C), long reaction times (16 h), and yields impure products, but it is the only method reported to date of TaSi2 NW production.
Metal halides
The application of anhydrous metal halides as the transition metal source for reaction with Si substrates has proven to be a general and popular method to grow silicide NWs. Ouyang and co-workers reported this technique as a facile way to produce FeSi nanowires using FeCl3.87 Varadwaj et al. further used a two-zone furnace to give better control of the metal halide vapour pressure.88 Typically, a halide precursor is vaporized in the upstream zone of a furnace, kept around 500 °C, and the substrate is held at 900 °C during the course of the reaction. Interestingly, by using substrates other than Si, metal rich phases can be favoured (Si powder or a Si substrate is still required for NW growth).88 Using this approach, NWs of FeSi,87 TiSi2,89 Ti5Si3,90 Fe5Si3,88 CoSi,91 Co2Si,91 CrSi2,92 and Fe11−xCoxSi93 have been reported. Although no convincing mechanism has been reported, vapour-solid (VS) mechanisms are usually proposed based largely on the delicate dependence of halide supersaturation on the resultant silicide morphology and phase. At lower pressures, the halides become more volatile and metal rich phases are preferred. Metal chlorides are well known to react with Si to produce SiCl4, MSix, and/or Cl2. SiCl4 is likely providing vapour-phase Si that could decompose to form elemental silicon or silicide, releasing more Cl2 into the vapour phase. SiCl4 is widely used to grow silicon NWs at such high temperatures.
One possible mechanistic explanation, usually discounted by researchers, is the growth of Si NWs catalyzed by in situ grown metal silicide nanoparticles followed by eventual silicidation of these NWs that could be carried out by reaction with metal deposited on their surfaces or diffusing from the substrate. The lack of a catalyst particle tip does not rule out particle catalysts as being responsible for 1-D growth as it possible to have a surface bound catalyst particle or a particle that is eventually incorporated into the wire itself, as is seen, for example, in the case of lead (Pb) catalyzed lead chalcogenide NWs.94 Thus far the delivery of transition metals to a silicon surface via a metal halide has proven to be a very versatile and general method to produce TMSi NWs of both slow and intermediate diffusing TM species.
Simultaneous metal and silicon delivery
Simultaneous delivery of silicon and transition metal source material to a substrate to grow metal silicide NWs has been achieved using two different techniques: chemical vapour transport (CVT) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD).
Chemical vapour transport (CVT)
CVT, a classical crystal growth method, takes advantage of the reversible thermodynamic reaction between two chemical species, a source material and a transport agent, to produce gas-phase precursors in situ. The intermediates provide the elements needed to synthesize the desired phase, as shown in Fig. 4. This technique has been widely used to synthesize single crystals of many of the transition metal silicides.95 However, one-dimensional NW growth may be obtained by altering the process for kinetically-favoured growth of 1-D morphologies.
 Fig. 4  Synthesis of metal silicide NWs using chemical vapour transport (CVT). Silicides undergo reversible reaction with I2 at T1 to form in situ gas phase products. At T2 gas phase components undergo the reverse reaction to form silicide NWs. 
We have demonstrated the synthesis of three distinct single-crystalline silicide NW phases via continuous-flow CVT using iodine (I2) as the transport agent.56–58 In each case, growth occurred on Si/SiO2 substrates, sometimes requiring a dilute metal salt solution of Ni(NO3)2 on the surface. Hexagonally-faceted CrSi2 NWs with lengths up to a few hundred microns were synthesized using powdered CrSi2 as the source material.56 NWs of the δ-Ni2Si57 and β-Ni3Si58 phases were also synthesized using Ni2Si and TiSi2 as source materials respectively. For both CrSi2 and δ-Ni2Si, the product stoichiometry was identical to the stoichiometry present in the source material. Interestingly, the β-Ni3Si phase was obtained when TiSi2 was used as a source material; it appears that the Ni in this case was supplied from the Ni(NO3)2 solution, with the Si emanating from the generated SiI4. Elemental analysis of the β-Ni3Si NWs revealed that no titanium (Ti) was incorporated into the NWs. Further impurity doping by I2 was not detected by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for any of the above phases.
Although the exact growth mechanism has not been determined for CVT grown silicide NWs, the lack of a visible catalyst tip combined with the necessity of the metal salt solution has been used to rule out VLS-type growth and typically vapour-solid or metal-assisted NW growth is cited. While among the synthetic free-standing nanowire literature there have been no confirmed reports of VLS catalyzed transition metal silicide nanowires the potential for in situ silicidation of silicon NWs remains.
Chemical vapour deposition (CVD)

CVD using single source precursors. 
The use of single source precursors (SSP), inorganic complexes containing the transition metal and silicon atoms necessary for silicide formation, as the vapour phase source material has been shown to be one of the most successful and versatile transition metal silicide NW synthesis techniques to date. SSPs have been used in MOCVD to obtain transition metal silicide thin films.83 Compared with conventional multisource metal organic CVD, the SSP approach allows simpler and safer experimental setups due to the elimination of highly hazardous liquid precursors (Fe(CO)5 typically for Fe and SiCl4 for Si), easier and precise control over stoichiometry, and higher quality material growth,83,96i.e. FeSi and CoSi thin films have been deposited by the pyrolysis of cis-Fe(CO)4(SiCl3)297 and Co(CO)4SiCl3.98 By selecting simple inorganic molecules containing metal and silicon that vaporize and decompose through well known pathways, precise control of the product stoichiometry and reproducible growth of NWs is possible (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Synthesis of metal silicide NWs using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of single source precursors (SSP). Each SSP pyrolyzes to deliver metal silicide material to the growth substrate. 
We first demonstrated this approach by using trans-Fe(CO)4(SiCl3)2 (the cis isomer is converted to trans at higher temperatures) to synthesize FeSi NWs.52 This compound can be readily synthesized by reacting Fe3(CO)12 with excess SiHCl3 in an inert atmosphere at 120 °C for 2 days and readily decomposes into FeSi in the gas phase at elevated temperatures (Fig. 5). High quality FeSi NWs can be synthesized using the CVD deposition of this precursor at 200 Torr and 750 °C when Si substrates are prepared with a thin (1–2 nm) silicon oxide layer.53 The dependence of this oxide layer was shown through patterning experiments,108 which also serves as a simple method to define the locations of silicide NW growth without the use of catalysts. To date, this general approach (Fig. 5) has been extended to CoSi NWs53 using Co(CO)4SiCl3 and MnSi2−x (MnSi1.8) NWs55 using Mn(CO)5SiCl3. trans-Fe(CO)4(SiCl3)2 and Co(CO)4SiCl3 SSP mixtures can themselves form a liquid two-component single source precursor via melting point depression. This solution can be conveniently evaporated for vapour phase delivery resulting in the synthesis of Fe1−xCoxSi alloy NWs.54 Such NWs are particularly interesting for spintronic applications as discussed below. Interestingly, the iron silicide and manganese silicide phases formed do not share their stoichiometry with that of the starting precursor. In the case of FeSi NW formation the precursor is known to undergo a reductive elimination to FeSiCl2 upon pyrolysis which may give rise to the resultant NW stoichiometry,97 but the stoichiometry of the MnSi2−x NWs produced from Mn(CO)5SiCl3 cannot be similarly rationalized as the pyrolysis behaviour of the precursor is ill characterized. The higher manganese silicides produced using this precursor are an incredibly complex set of incommensurate structures based on elemental sublattices of Mn atoms which form chimneys within which spiralling sublattices of Si atoms lie.109 These so-called Nowotny chimney ladder phases can have unit cells (under commensurate approximations) of up to 10s of nm.110 The NWs were determined to be Mn19Si33 by elaborate electron diffraction experiments. Such structures, having both complex crystal structures and enhanced nanomorphology, are efficient phonon scatters which improves upon their thermoelectric performance.111
Preliminary experiments into the mechanism for this process show that both silicon and metal atom diffusion from the substrate is occurring and may be used to make solid solutions for spintronics, i.e. Fe1−xCoxSi, or for doping thermoelectric phases, i.e. MnSi2−x. Importantly, because the decomposition pathway may produce gas phase silicon, either through direct decomposition or Cl2 substrate etching, silicidation of VLS grown silicon nanowires should not be ruled out. Although there are many more transition metals (examples include Ru, Re, and Rh) capable of making analogous molecules which are both volatile and contain metal-silicon bonds, many of the early transition metals do not. Such transition metal silicide NW phases of interest are likely accessible only through alternative source material delivery techniques. As new developments occur in metal-silyl complexation chemistry, new SSPs will be developed that allow other stoichiometries and new combinations of transition metals and silicon to be delivered via gas phase pyrolysis for NW growth.


Two source CVD. 
CVD of silicon and metal gas phase sources is the classical way in which to prepare silicide thin films for electronic applications. Typically, silane and metal carbonyls are used at low temperatures (250–450 °C) to produce thin films with controlled stoichiometries. Zhou et al. were able to adapt a similar approach to form TiSi2 nanostructures.106 In these experiments TiCl4 and SiH4 were co-flowed with H2 gas to a Si substrate at 675 °C to form orthorhombic TiSi2 nanowires (C54) and 2-D nanonets (C49). The nanonets are composed of hyperbranched TiSi2 nanowires restricted along the [100] and [001] growth directions of the C49 orthorhombic structure. The same authors also showed that by varying the Si:Ti ratio (intermediate between the optimized C54 and C49 structures), nanonets can intersect at 120° angles to form 3-D nanonets.107 This likely occurs through a hexagonal C40 TiSi2 coating along the axis of intersection. So far, the two source CVD approach has only been successfully applied to the synthesis of titanium silicide NWs. The inherent strength of the dual source approach is the independent control over Si and TM vapour pressures, but this technique has not yet been shown to be general for other metal silicides.

Technique comparison
Many observations and conclusions can be drawn when summarizing across the various growth techniques used to produce the entire array of silicide NWs reported to date (Fig. 6). Diffusion seems to be an important parameter for silicide NW growth, considering that there have been more reports of silicide NW growth from the Ni-Si binary phase diagram than any other. This is likely due to the exceptionally fast diffusion behaviour of nickel in silicon. By simply decomposing silane on Ni metal films using a wide variety of conditions (10–160 Torr, 400–650 °C, 10–60 min growth times, and surface oxidation behaviour (see Table 2)), different parts of the phase diagram can be accessed resulting in NWs of many nickel silicide phases. Ni silicides can also be grown using CVT to give ultra-long wires (up to 3 mm), but require longer reaction times (2 h) and higher temperatures (1000 °C).57

 Fig. 6  Morphologies of transition metal silicide nanowires. Images of transition metal nanowires synthesized for four different paradigms. Silicon nanowire silicidation: Si NW silicidation yields NiSi,68 PtSi,67 and FeSi266 NWs, 1st column TEMs (scale bars 5, 20, and 100 nm, respectively). Silane reactions with metal: delivery of only Si to metal substrates results in NiSi,77 Ni2Si,70 Ni3Si2,78 NiSi2,100 and Ni31Si1281 NWs, 2nd column SEMs (scale bars are all 5 µm). Metal delivery to silicon: delivery of transition metals using silicon substrates yields FeSi,87 CoSi,91 Fe1−xCoxSi,93 Mn4Si7,104 CrSi2,92 TaSi2,85 Ti5Si3,90 and Fe5Si388 NWs, 3rd column SEMs (FeSi and Mn4Si7 scale bar is 1 µm, the rest are 5 µm). Delivery of both metal and silicon: using either CVT or CVD to deliver metal and silicon results in FeSi,52 CoSi,53 Fe1−xCoxSi,54 Mn19Si33,55 CrSi2,56 TiSi2,106 Ni2Si,57 and Ni3Si58 NWs, 4th column SEMs (all scale bars are 5 µm except Ni2Si which is 200 µm). 
Early transition metal silicide nanowires, sometimes called refractory metal silicides, are probably the most difficult to make from the perspective of metal diffusion. Metals such as Ti, vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), Ta, etc. are slow diffusing species and form silicides with extremely high melting points. At the time of submission, only TiSi,105 Ti5Si3,90 TiSi2,89,106 and TaSi284 have been reported. TaSi2 and TiSi2 were synthesized using the reactions of metal vapour with silicide thin films or bare Si substrates, respectively. Ti5Si3 NWs were synthesized using the direct reaction of TiCl4 with a silicon substrate. These synthetic procedures require high temperatures, and in the case of TaSi2 extremely long reaction times of up to 16 h yielding only short (1–2 µm) NWs. There are no reported alternatives yet to produce these materials; however, TiSi and TiSi2 nanowires were recently synthesized using a dual source CVD approach.106 The lack of single source precursors and slow diffusion behaviour of the early transition metal species implies that successful synthesis of silicide NWs of early transition metals will require vapour phase transition metal and silicon delivery using either CVD or CVT.
Silicides of the group VIB metals, chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W), which are also considered refractory, are an interesting intermediate case. So far the only silicide phase synthesized among this group has been CrSi2; NWs of this phase have been produced independently by both CVT and metal halide transport.56,92,103 The mechanism for growth in these two processes is likely very similar. Metal halide transport evaporates CrCl2 and produces SiCl4, from reaction with the silicon substrate. By delivering CrSi2via I2 transport agent, CVT produces CrI2 and SiI4. These are borne out in the nearly identical morphologies observed in the two cases (Fig. 6). It has yet to be seen whether either of these techniques, or others, can be used to make tungsten or molybdenum silicides, but because of the generally slow diffusion behaviour of these metals, synthesizing such NWs will be difficult using either delivery of a silicon source to a metal substrate or vice versa. For these metals there are no M(CO)x(SiCl3)y analogs because the M–Si bond in such structures is quite weak, but precursors stabilized by cyclopentadienyl or π-arene ligands are known and delivery of such SSPs or independent Si and TM sources via CVD may lead to successful NW synthesis.
The late transition metal (except groups IB, IIB) silicides have been explored using both metal halide transport and CVD of single source precursors.52–55,87,88,91,93,108 In the case of single source precursors, the metal to silicon ratio delivered to the substrate can be built into the molecular structure as a means of gaining more control over the reaction. In metal halide transport similar results can be obtained albeit at much higher temperatures (900–1100 °C, Table 2). Varadwaj et al. were able to show that by eliminating substrate diffusion as a silicon source and instead relying on gaseous SiCl4 products, metal rich phases can be favoured.88 This makes it possible to choose between two phases by changing the substrates. In order to do this using the SSP approach, metal-silicon bonds in the molecules would have to be tuned for bond strength using crystal field theory and molecular design criteria to alter the decomposition products. Fundamental research in this area could yield many more SSP targets for the controllable synthesis of silicide NWs.
Across the board, the mechanism for the anisotropic 1-D growth of silicide NWs is not very clear. Nearly all reports believe silicide NWs were not directly formed via a VLS or metal-catalyst driven process regardless of the precursor delivery methods. The strong correlation with metal diffusion behaviours in silicon, the dependence on various oxide of silicide diffusion barriers, and other observations seem to imply that diffusion and reaction is an important consideration. Thus far there have been no confirmed reports of VLS catalyzed transition metal silicide nanowires, but based on the reaction parameters discussed for each process, it seems plausible that silicon NWs are being formed prior to silicidation via metal incorporation from diffusion or directly from the gas phase. Further investigation is still needed to elucidate such mechanisms. It should also be noted that for many cases little attention has been paid to the interface between the NW and the growth substrate leaving the possibility of nanoparticle mediated 1-D nucleation from the base an open possibility. We are currently investigating this using TEM of microcleaved samples.
Applications of silicide nanowires
Transition metal silicides, with their diverse physical properties, have been used in a large number of applications. High melting points, excellent chemical stability, and compatibility with silicon processing technology have made them good candidate materials for use in electronics, thermoelectrics, and photovoltaics.2,5,116,117 Metal silicide nanowires share these positive characteristics and their size may allow them to be useful in potentially improved nanoscale versions of these devices as well as in new roles, such as field emission sources and spintronics. In the following section we briefly review the applications and current device concepts utilizing silicide NWs.
Nanoelectronics
Because of the ubiquity of metal silicides as interconnects and contact electrodes in modern microelectronics,118 silicide NWs are expected to serve a similar role in nanoelectronic devices. Their low resistivities and compatibility with silicon make them excellent candidates to continue in this role. Notably, ultralong Ni2Si NWs were made having an extremely low resistivity of 21 µΩcm and were capable of supporting remarkably high failure current densities >108 A/cm2 (Fig. 7a).57 The difficulty of selective nanostructure placement for devices serves as a strong barrier against the use of randomly oriented free standing NWs. A number of groups have found a solution through the direct silicidation of silicon nanowires creating so-called intruded silicon contacts.62,99,112 In this process metal contacts lithographically applied to silicon NWs are used as the metal source to controllably create MSi/Si/MSi heterostructures (Fig. 7b). Careful control of this phenomenon has been applied in the successful fabrication of NiSi NW contacted Si FETs with arbitrary channel length.99 Indeed such a strategy may be used as an exploration of new types of devices as quantum confined112 and highly strained68 silicon segments have also been demonstrated.

Nanoscale field emitters
Another commonly discussed application for metal silicide NWs is their use as nanoscale field emitters (Fig. 7c). Field emission occurs when an electric field between a metallic surface and a ground electrode allows electrons to overcome the work function potential that binds them on the surface of the emitter. The field emission current follows the Fowler-Nordheim relation: J = (Aß2E2/Φ)exp(−BΦ3/2/ßE) where J is the current density, E is the applied electrical field, Φ is the work function, ß is the field enhancement factor, and A and B are constants: 1.56 × 10−10 (AV−2eV) and 6.83 × 103 (eV−3/2µm−1) respectively.119 Field emission devices are useful in wide ranging applications such as flat panel displays, microwave generation devices, and high-powered vacuum microelectronic devices. Since the late 1990s there has been much interest in developing 1-D nanomaterials for field emission due to the enhancement of electric field at the high curvature tips. Thus as the geometric enhancement factor ß increases, the voltage required for emission decreases. Because transition metal silicide NWs have low resistivities and work functions, high melting points, high aspect ratios, and well known compatibility with silicon-based microelectronics they have been considered good candidates for future field emission devices. The field emissions of as-grown, free-standing transition metal silicide NWs of a variety of phases have been reported including Ni2Si,70 NiSi,75 TaSi2,84,85 TiSi2,89 Ti5Si3.90 Authors regularly report turn-on fields (for current density of 10 µA/cm2) in the range of 3–4 V/µm and field enhancement factors as high as 4280.70 Studies on single NW field emitters have also begun in the hopes of pushing current theoretical understanding of the field emission in these nanoscale structures.113
Spintronics
As the size of transistors approaches the quantum regime many researchers have begun to consider alternative computing paradigms. Spintronics is an approach which seeks to use the electron's spin degree of freedom in lieu of or in addition to the electron's charge for computation.26 The long spin relaxation times and well developed process technology of silicon make it an ideal candidate material for devices such as a spin-FET.120 Such technologies are still in their infancy as the difficulties associated with spin-polarized and pure spin current injection and detection are still being solved. The conductance mismatch problem121 prohibits the use of conventional ferromagnetic metals as the contacts in a spin-FET due to greatly enhanced interfacial spin scattering, but novel contact materials, such as half-metals and ferromagnetic semiconductors, would overcome this barrier.26 NWs of the Fe1−xCoxSi alloys, which contains both half-metallic and ferromagnetic semiconducting members in the bulk phase,23,122 have been synthesized independently by two different groups, one using single source precursors with 0 < x < 0.4454 and one using metal halides with 0 < x < 0.1.93 In both preparations, the NWs have been shown to retain bulk-like magnetic and electrical characteristics (Fig. 7f). Although large magneto-resistances have been reported (∼10%), there have not been measurements of the spin polarization (Ps) in this material. We are currently working on using point contact Andreev reflection to precisely determine the value of Ps in this interesting system.
Thermoelectrics
The aim of thermoelectricity is the efficient interconversion of thermal and electrical energy using solid state devices. Metal silicides have long been considered a promising group of materials for thermoelectric applications, especially power generation at elevated temperature. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is judged by the unitless parameter ZT = S2σT/(κL + κe), with S the Seebeck coefficient, σ the electrical conductivity, κL the thermal conductivity due to the lattice, κe the thermal conductivity due to electrons, and T the average measurement temperature. Recent research in materials development for such applications follows the “electron crystal phonon glass” paradigm,111 producing materials which strongly scatter phonons but allow efficient electrical transport. The two major strategies for accomplishing this involve using materials with complex crystal structures or nanoscale morphology, both of which lead to relatively small lattice thermal conductivity. Nanowires of CrSi256,92 and the Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) MnSi2−x,55 which are excellent bulk thermoelectric materials, have been successfully synthesized. Further, specific thermoelectric properties of CrSi2 nanowires have been investigated using a specialized technique allowing the measurement of all thermoelectric properties on a single wire in addition to structural characterization via TEM which revealed increased phonon-surface scattering with decreasing NW diameter at low temperatures (Fig. 7d,e).114 Additionally, phonon confinement will occur more readily in nanostructured materials which with enhanced phonon-surface scattering and complex crystal structures will result in dramatic reduction of thermal conductivity. If other properties (i.e.σ and S) are maintained for single crystal NCL NWs, their ZT may be enhanced beyond the already high bulk values of 0.7–0.8.5,9,40–42 Future work in this area will likely focus on synthesizing new thermoelectric nanowires such as Re4Si7, β-FeSi2, and Ru2Si3, incorporating dopants into transition metal silicide nanowires in order to optimize their thermoelectric properties, and also exploration of the predicted effects of quantum confinement on the thermoelectric efficiency.47,123
Solar energy conversion
In addition to thermoelectrics, silicide nanowires are finding applications in renewable energy technologies. Specifically, devices capable of converting solar energy into electricity or chemical fuels, which are known as photovoltaic (PV) and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) devices, respectively, will likely play a huge role in the future. Transition metal silicides, made of inexpensive and abundant elements like β-FeSi2 (Si and Fe are the 2nd and 4th most abundant elements in the earth's crust, respectively) have appropriate bandgaps (0.8 eV for β-FeSi2) and high light absorption coefficients,10 and may find use in photovoltaic devices. To date there have been no reports of TMSi-based NW PV devices. This is an interesting area for future exploration. Lin and co-workers have made use of TiSi2 nanonets coated with a TiO2 layer in a PEC application.115 In this device, TiSi2 nanonets, a planar construct of orthogonal nanowire branches, act as a highly conductive scaffold and charge collection structure while a semiconducting TiO2 layer acts as the active photoabsorption layer for water splitting (Fig. 7g). Such device configuration takes advantage of the high surface area of nanostructures to produce devices with much enhanced photocurrent compared to planar device geometry. The authors observed a peak incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 16.7% using monochromatic 330 nm light. We have also synthesized highly branched and hierarchical nanostructures of other silicides such as FeSi and MnSix. These complex nanostructures could provide advantages to solar energy harvesting and conversion due to enhanced absorption and small electron-hole diffusion paths.94
Conclusions
In this feature article we have reviewed the current strategies for synthesizing free-standing transition metal silicide nanowires. Thus far 18 silicide NW phases across nine binary phase diagrams have been made. Even with the increasing interest in silicide NW applications, many synthetic challenges remain. For all cases besides the silicidation of silicon NWs, the mechanism for NW formation is not completely understood. Based on the reaction parameters discussed for each process, it seems plausible that silicon NWs are being formed prior to silicidation via metal incorporation from diffusion or directly from the gas phase. This hypothesis, if proven true, should aid in designing experiments for determining the exact mechanism for previously reported syntheses and should lead to new efforts in the synthesis of phases. Nanowires of many more interesting silicides with applications in nanoelectronics, field emission, spintronics, thermoelectrics, and solar energy conversion remain to be synthesized and exploited.

 	Fig. 3  Preparation of Ni2Si NWs using silane gas precursor and Ni foil. (a) Ni diffusion is faster than silane decomposition, creating nanoparticles on the surface of the metal film. (b) As more Si decomposes, Ni metal from the substrate has to diffuse further into the crystalline material, creating an elongated structure. (c) The rates of metal diffusion and silane decomposition are comparable and single crystalline NWs form. (d) NWs with constant diameter are propagated during growth.70
