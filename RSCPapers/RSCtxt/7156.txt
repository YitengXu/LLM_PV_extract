    , Accepted 7th September 2018First published on 18th September 2018AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D)  perovskites with n = 4 have attracted much attention recently and the low-n (e.g. n = 1) phases in these 2D perovskites have been found to act as carrier traps, leading to decreased performance. In this work, we demonstrate a simple method to suppress the formation of low-n phases by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent. The present 2D perovskites with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) exhibit enhanced carrier lifetime and charge transport by suppressing low-n phases. The optimized 2D ACI-based perovskite solar cell shows a PCE of 12.8%, which is also the highest efficiency for ACI-based perovskite solar cells, and is almost 3 times higher than that of the non-DMSO treated devices.
Introduction
2D perovskites with the chemical formula of  where A′ is a large organic cation and MA is methylammonium, are evolving into an important class of photovoltaic materials.1–8 Typical 2D perovskite films actually comprise multiple perovskite phases (i.e. n = 1, 2, 3, 4 to near ∞).9–13 The low-n phases (e.g. n = 1, 2, and 3) can act as hole traps in the perovskite leading to carrier recombination and decreased photovoltaic performances.14–18 Thus, it is highly desirable to develop approaches for suppressing the formation of low-n phases in 2D perovskite.
Here, we report a simple approach to suppress the formation of low-n phases by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent. DMSO has widely been used in the processing of perovskite for its morphology and orientation controls.19–21 Here, DMSO is first utilized in phase control (control of “n”) in 2D perovskites (GAMA4Pb4I13, GA is guanidinium) with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI). ACI-based 2D perovskite was first reported by Kanatzidis et al.22 Compared to the commonly used Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites, the ACI perovskites have high crystal symmetry and a narrow bandgap. The XRD and optical absorption results suggest that the formation of low-n phases is significantly suppressed by adding DMSO in the perovskite precursor solution. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), hole-trap density calculation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results show that the ACI perovskites with suppressed low-n phases exhibit long carrier lifetime, reduced hole-trap density and enhanced charge transport. Our champion device shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.8%, which is also the highest efficiency reported for the ACI-based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs).
Experimental section
Fabrication of the devices
0.25 mmol GAI (Greatsolarcell), 1 mmol MAI (Greatsolarcell) and 1 mmol lead iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 1 mL of anhydrous DMF (Sigma-Aldrich) with different concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich). The solutions were stirred at room temperature for more than 2 h. The solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/C60 (20 nm)/BCP (8 nm)/Ag (70 nm). The PEDOT:PSS films were fabricated by the spin coating method at a speed of 3000 rpm followed by heating at 140 °C for 10 min. Then the samples were transferred into a N2-filled glovebox. The perovskite precursor solutions were spin coated at 4000 rpm and an antisolvent (i.e. toluene) was added dropwise during the spinning. Then the film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, the devices were finished by thermal deposition of C60, 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP, Lumtec) and Ag electrode. Hole-only devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Au (80 nm).
Characterization
The XRD results were measured with a Philips X′ Pert diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer model Lambda 2S UV-vis spectrometer. The TRPL were obtained with a FLS 980 spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) and the excitation source is a 485 nm laser and the laser was irradiated on the perovskite side. The J–V curves of the PSCs were measured with a Keithley source measurement unit under 100 mW cm−2 with an Oriel 150 W solar simulator and the active area of the devices is 0.1 cm2. The scan rate is 50 mV s−1. The EIS results were measured with a ZAHNER IM6 workstation with a frequency range from 1 Hz to 106 Hz under open circuit conditions.
Results and discussion
The GAMA4Pb4I13 perovskite thin films were prepared by a one-step spin coating method using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with 0–4 M DMSO co-solvent at room temperature (referred to as 0 M, 1 M, 2 M, 3 M, and 4 M DMSO samples). The XRD patterns of these samples are measured immediately after spin coating (i.e. before annealing) to study the effect of the DMSO solvent on the crystallization processes. Fig. 1a shows that the 0 M DMSO sample (i.e. with DMF only) exhibits strong peaks at 2θ = 6.8° and 9.8° (), which is attributed to the n = 1 and 2 phases. This result agrees with the previous report that low-n phases are more favourable due to their lower nucleation barrier.23,24 The small 3D peaks at 14.4° and 28.8° () can also be observed.

(b) Normalized XRD peak intensity of 3D (peak at 14.4°), low-n phase (peak at 9.8°) and intermediate (peak at 7.5°) derived from the 0–4 M DMSO samples. (c) Absorption spectra of the 0–4 M DMSO samples. 
In Fig. 1a, the 1–4 M DMSO samples show strong peaks at 2θ = 6.9°, 7.5° and 9.5°, which correspond to (002), (021), and (022) planes of the MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO intermediate.25 It is important to note that the formation of the intermediate phase can slow down the intercalation of organic cations (i.e. GA) and significantly influence the crystallization of the perovskite phase.25 The peak intensities at 14.4° (i.e. 3D: ), 9.8° (i.e. low-n phase: ) and 7.5° (i.e. intermediate: ) of each sample in Fig. 1a are normalized with the maximum intensity (Fig. 1b).
When DMSO concentration is increased from 0 M to 3 M, the peak intensity of both intermediate () and 3D perovskite () are enhanced; whereas the peak intensity of the low-n phase () is decreased. These results confirm that the intermediate phases can suppress the formation of low-n phases (i.e. n = 1), and favour the formation of the 3D phase of the perovskite.25 When the DMSO concentration further increases to 4 M, a reduced 3D peak intensity is observed. With more DMSO (i.e. 4 M), more MA and Pb ions are consumed to form MA2Pb3I8·2DMSO. Thus, the remaining precursors could hardly assemble into the 3D perovskite, leading to the reduced 3D perovskite peak intensity. DMSO with a high polarity of 7.2 can form strong Lewis-base adducts with lead halide26 and strong hydrogen bonds with methylammonium salts.20,25 Thus, GA cations can no longer form low-n phases with MAI and PbI2.
The absorption spectra of the 0–4 M DMSO samples are shown in Fig. 1c. Reference lines at 535, 585, 625, and 775 nm corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3 and 3D respectively are included. The absorption spectrum of the 0 M DMSO sample shows obvious peaks at 535 and 585 nm, indicating strong low-n phases with n = 1 and 2. When DMSO is used as a co-solvent with DMF, the absorption peaks at 535 and 585 nm (i.e. n = 1, 2 features) can no longer be observed clearly, and a clear absorption cutoff at 755 nm emerges (i.e. 3D feature). When the DMSO concentration increases to 3 M, the absorption spectrum shows a plateau region with no observable peaks from 400 to 650 nm, indicating no 2D absorption feature. Furthermore, a clear absorption cutoff at 755 nm is observed (please referred to Fig. S1† for specific magnified spectra). These results further confirm that DMSO can suppress the formation of low-n phase (n < 4).
The absorption and XRD measurements were performed after sample annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes for complete solvent evaporation (Fig. S2 and S3†). Similar absorption features are observed for the annealed samples. However, the peaks of the low-n phases are undetectable in the XRD patterns, which may be due to their vertical orientation.27 Although the effects of DMSO have been widely studied on the morphology and orientation during film formation,19,20,28 for the first time the phase control effect of DMSO is reported in 2D perovskites. Besides, the addition of DMSO can also enhance the coverage of the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. S4.†
The photoelectric properties of the 0–4 M DMSO samples were studied with TRPL, as shown in Fig. 2a. Fitting equation and parameters of results are shown in Table S1.† The ACI perovskites with suppressed low-n phases show long carrier lifetimes, indicating that the transport properties of the ACI perovskite are beneficial. Fig. 2b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/0–4 M DMSO perovskite/Au) based on the 0–4 M DMSO samples.29,30 The hole-trap density is commonly determined by the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) using the equation:31  where, e is the elementary charge of the electron, L is the perovskite film thickness (Fig. S5†), ε is the relative dielectric constant of the 2D perovskite,32ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and nt is the trap state density. Based on VTFL in Fig. 2b, the hole-trap densities are estimated to be 6.6, 5.3, 3.2, 2.5, and 4.4 × 1016 cm−3 for the 0–4 M samples respectively. When DMSO is used as a co-solvent, the hole-trap density of the 1–4 M DMSO samples is much reduced compared to the 0 M DMSO sample. The reduced hole-trap density is highly related to the suppression of the low-n phases. It was reported that the low-n phases can act as shallow traps for holes in the 2D perovskite, due to their relatively high valence band edge (Fig. 2c).18,33,34 Thus, suppression of the low-n phase can reduce the density of shallow traps in the ACI perovskite film and increase the carrier lifetime.35 These results confirm that DMSO can increase the carrier lifetime and reduce the hole-trap density by suppressing the low-n phase in the ACI perovskite.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the 0–4 M DMSO samples, the solar cells were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskites/C60/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Ag and measured under standard AM1.5G illumination. The J–V curves with different scan directions and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the PSCs with the 0–4 M DMSO samples are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1 and comparisons of efficiency of the 2D PSCs are also shown in Table S2.† The ACI perovskites based on the 3 M DMSO sample achieve the highest PCE of 12.8%. This champion device shows a relatively less J–V hysteresis (Fig. 3a) and better stability compared to its 3D counterpart (Fig. S6†). The statistics of PCE distribution are shown in Fig. S7.† The low efficiency in PSCs with the 0 M DMSO sample is attributed to the short carrier lifetime and high hole-trap density.

To further clarify the significant changes caused by the suppression of the low-n phases, EIS was carried out on these ACI-based PSCs (Fig. 3c). Only one semicircle is resolved in EIS spectra, which describes the charge transport resistance (Rct).36 Note the only difference between these PSCs is the perovskite materials, thus it is rational to attribute these changes in the EIS to the different properties of the perovskite materials. Rct of the ACI-based PSCs show values of 61, 25, 20, 17, and 22 ohm cm2 for the 0–4 M DMSO samples, respectively. Obviously, the ACI perovskites with the addition of DMSO show a much lower Rct than that without DMSO. The much improved conductivity in the ACI perovskites with addition of DMSO is attributed to the suppression of the low-n phases.
Conclusion
This work illustrates that DMSO can be used to control the formation of low-n phases in ACI perovskites. These low-n phases (e.g. n = 1 phase) can act as hole traps in the perovskite films, leading to reduced photovoltaic performances. Using DMSO as a co-solvent, the formation of the low-n phases in the ACI perovskites is suppressed, and thus reduces hole-trap density and increases the carrier lifetime. The PSCs based on these optimized ACI perovskites exhibit a high efficiency of up to 12.8%, indicating that controlling the low-n phases is crucial to enhance the performance in the 2D perovskite devices.
