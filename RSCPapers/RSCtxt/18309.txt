Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide perovskites, such as MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3, X = Cl, Br, I), have attracted wide attention due to their potential in photovoltaic applications. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CH3NH3PbI3 has shown a swift surge in the past four years, reaching 20.1%.1–8 The reason for this rapid increase in the PCE of these devices is that the perovskite material has an appropriate direct band gap, strong absorption in the whole visible range and high carrier mobilities.6–8 A variety of film deposition technologies based on solution chemical methods,9,10 hybrid methods,11–16 and vacuum evaporated methods17–19 are employed to prepare high quality perovskite thin films. Compared to the solution process, the advantages of vacuum-based methods include high purity, compatibility with large areas, easy control of film thickness, and smooth surface.20 For the vacuum-based methods, most work has focused on dual source vacuum evaporation, although this method has disadvantages, such as difficult control of the evaporation rates of the PbI2 (PbCl2) and MAI sources due to the significantly different vapors, high consumption of the MAI source, and potential erosion of the vacuum components.
Another vacuum-based evaporation method, flash evaporation, has seldom been used in perovskite films. For this method, only one thermal source with a metal foil heater is used to evaporate MAPbI3, and the deposition procedure lasts less than 5 s with a large current passing instantly through the heater. The advantages of this process, compared to dual-source evaporation, are easy control of the single source, small consumption of MAI material (and thus little damage to vacuum components), simple instrument structure, small energy consumption and non-dependent film growth on the substrates. Due to these advantages, flash evaporation of perovskite films is a method that could potentially be widely applied for large scale fabrication. In fact, in 1999, Mitzi et al.21–23 first utilized this method in the preparation of 2D perovskite materials ((AEQT)·PbCl4) and demonstrated organic light emitting devices with room-temperature electroluminescence. In 2005, Licci et al.24,25 also used this method to prepare CH3NH3SnX3 field effect transistors. Very recently, MAPbI3 solar cells prepared by the flash evaporation method were first reported by Longo et al.26
However, these evaporated films are strongly dependent on the growth conditions, such as growth pressure, precursor source, post-annealing and the distance between the substrate and the source. Discussions on the dependence of the film quality on the growth conditions and, moreover, the growth mechanism of perovskite films prepared by flash evaporation are still lacking. In particular, the reported grain size of perovskite films obtained by low pressure vacuum deposition, such as dual-source evaporation and flash evaporation, is always below 500 nm, even after post annealing; the grain size is mostly around 200 to 300 nm, considerably smaller than those obtained by solution-based and hybrid methods. The dependence of grain size on the evaporation process remains to be determined; larger grains should be achieved to improve solar cell performance.
In this work, we found that the vapor pressure adopted in flash evaporation determines the film morphology and device performance. Two typical pressures were adopted to demonstrate the transport-determined growth models. Dense MAPbI3 films can be only achieved under a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a rough surface covered by step-like grains and voids for MAPbI3 films under a high growth Ar pressure of 10 Pa. In addition, evaporated MAPbI3 films with large grain sizes of around 500 to 1000 nm are observed, and the grain size of the MAPbI3 films decreases with increasing PbI2 phase due to an increase in the activation energy for grain boundary motion. The average PCE of the perovskite solar cells is improved from 1.82% to 10.01% with increasing grain size.
Experimental section
Perovskite film evaporation
40 wt% perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (Sigma Aldrich) and MAI in a series of GBL (γ-butyrolactone) solutions with different molar ratios. Molybdenum foil with a size of 40 × 100 × 0.1 mm was first cleaned by O3 generated by an ultraviolet lamp for about 5 minutes; it was then transferred into the evaporation chamber and clamped between two electrodes connected to a high current source. 80 μl of precursor solution was then spread onto the metal by pipette. Then, this solution layer was leveled off with blade coating, leading to a uniform distribution of precursor on the foil. The solvent evaporated and the perovskite precursor formed (i.e. the layer changed from a yellow solution to a dark brown solid film, as shown in Fig. S1a†) immediately after the growth chamber was pumped down. When the specified vacuum of approximately 5 × 10−3 Pa was reached, a large current (approximately 180 A for about 5 s) was instantly passed through the molybdenum foil, leading to instantaneous evaporation of the perovskite precursor (Fig. S1b†).
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The devices were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses which were patterned by etching the surface with Zn powder and 2 M HCl diluted in water. These glasses were then sequentially cleaned with Triton X-100, deionized water, acetone and ethanol. The FTO substrates were also treated with UV-ozone. The PCBM layers were deposited by spin-coating in a N2-filled glove box. The devices were then transferred to the evaporation chamber, and the perovskite films were formed. After the deposition of perovskite materials, a hole transport material (HTM) solution was coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s. The composition of HTM was 0.170 M 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Merck), 0.064 M bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 99.95%, Aldrich) and 0.198 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%, Aldrich) in a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene (99.8%, Aldrich) and acetonitrile (99.8%, Aldrich) (chlorobenzene:acetonitrile = 1:0.1 v/v). Finally, 100 nm gold electrodes were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of ≈10−3 Pa.
Characterization
The crystalline structure of the films was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D MAX-3C, Cu-Kα, λ = 1.54050 Å). The UV-Vis transmittance spectra were measured with a HITACHI U-2910 spectrophotometer with a scan speed of 300 nm min−1 and a quantitative slit width of 4 nm in the wavelength range of 200 to 900 nm at room temperature. The morphology of the perovskite films was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-520, Hitachi, Japan). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with an ORIEL IQE-200 instrument.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured (2400 Series Source Meter, Keithley Instruments Inc.) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm−2 irradiance generated by a High Power Shutter Assembly for SS-1 kW Solar Simulators (Sciencetech); the intensity was calibrated with an calibrated KG5 filtered Si reference cell. The J–V curves were obtained in the air through reverse scan (1.1 V → −0.2 V) with steps of 50 mV at a dwell time of 150 ms. For the measurement of the hysteresis, the J–V curves were obtained in the air through reverse scan (1.1 V → −0.2 V) or forward scan (−0.2 V → 1.1 V) with the same step size.
Results and discussion
Generally, growth pressure is a key parameter during evaporation processes because it determines the transport of materials from the source to the substrate due to collision. However, previous reports contain no detailed discussion on the effects of this important parameter.21–26 Here, we will demonstrate the critical effect of growth pressure on the film growth and, therefore, on the device performance.
Two growth pressures of 10 Pa and 5 × 10−3 Pa were adopted to demonstrate the two typical growth models, which are discussed later. Fig. 1a and b show the XRD spectra of MAPbI3 films under the abovementioned growth pressures. The peaks of 14.1°, 28.4° and 31.8° correspond to the (110), (220) and (311) orientations of MAPbI3 tetragonal phase, respectively. Additional diffraction peaks corresponding to the FTO substrate are also detected. All the films show a random orientation without a (011) preferred orientation, which is similar to sequential deposition but completely different from the one step spin-coating process.3,27

All the perovskite films are deposited on FTO substrates. 
At a high pressure of 10 Pa, as-deposited films with pure perovskite phase can be easily achieved using a precursor with an ideal MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 1.0, as shown in Fig. 1a. With increasing ratio of MAI in the precursor, the as-deposited film becomes unstable upon exposure to an air environment, immediately changing from dark brown to white. In contrast, at a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa and with the same MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 1.0, the PbI2 phase is present in the perovskite films, as evidenced by the appearance of the peak at 12.6° in Fig. 1b, which can be assigned to the (001) plane of hexagonal 2H polytype PbI2. Moreover, this PbI2 (001) peak is much stronger than the MAPbI3 (110) peak, indicating that the major phase is PbI2 in the as-deposited films. The formation of PbI2 phase in the films most likely results from the different transportation features of MAI and PbI2 without collision under a relatively low growth pressure, which will be discussed in detail later. Therefore, to achieve pure MAPbI3 films without PbI2 phase, the MAI concentration in the precursor must be increased to compensate for the loss of MAI in the transportation of material from the source to the substrate. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 1b that the PbI2 phase in the films decreases with increasing MAI concentration, and MAPbI3 films without PbI2 phase can be achieved by using a precursor with an MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 2.0. When the MAI concentration is further increased, however, a small peak appears at 11.4°, which may originate from MAxPbI3 (x > 1)19 and indicates the presence of excess MAI in the MAPbI3 film. Additionally, for all the above films with thicknesses of 250 ± 10 nm, the increase of the (110) peak intensity with the MAI concentration implies improvement in the crystalline quality.
The composition of the final film was obtained by EDX measurement, as shown in Table 1. The results show that the atomic ratio of I/Pb increases systematically with increasing MAI concentration. For the precursor with an MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 2.0, the composition of the as-deposited MAPbI3 films is about 2.96, close to the accurate stoichiometric ratio. All the EDX results agree well with the XRD results.

All the films show a characteristic onset of 780 nm in the corresponding transmittance spectra (Fig. 1c), evidencing a 1.61 eV band gap of the perovskite films. The single path transmittance without integrated sphere in the range of 400 to 900 nm for the films grown under a high pressure of 10 Pa is apparently lower than that for the low pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa. This mainly originates from the much rougher surface of the films prepared under high growth pressure, which was confirmed by the SEM results. The increasing PbI2 phase in the films also leads to an increase of transmittance in the range of 500 to 700 nm due to a high band gap of 2.41 eV for the PbI2 phase, which is in good accord with the above XRD results.
The corresponding surface SEM images for the abovementioned films are shown in Fig. 2. For the films grown under a high pressure of 10 Pa, the surface SEM image in Fig. 2a shows a rough surface covered by rod-like grains with sizes of around 85 nm in length. Voids in the films can also be clearly observed in Fig. 2a, indicating an insufficient lateral diffusion during film growth. Fig. 2b–f show the surface SEM images of the evaporated films deposited with different MAI to PbI2 ratios under a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa. Surfaces covered with dense grains and without any voids or pinholes can be observed in all the as-deposited films, showing 100% coverage, which is rarely observed in the solution processed films.3,7 The size of the perovskite grains in the films increases linearly from 0.2 μm to around 1 μm with increasing MAI concentration (Fig. 2g and S2†). However, when the ratio of MAI was finally increased to 2.1, the surface of the film appears hazy to the naked eye, which originates from the crack regions, as seen in Fig. 2f. This hazy nature is also reported by other researchers in dual-source evaporation when MAI is in excess.19 Nevertheless, the grain size still increased even with excess MAI. The grains with size of one micrometer were first observed in the high vacuum-based process and are strongly correlated with MAI concentration. This relationship of grain size with MAI concentration is reminiscent of the grain growth of CuInGaSe films, i.e., the increase of the grain size with increasing Cu content. For example, the grain size of these films can be increased from 100 nm to 180 nm by increasing the Cu concentration from 17.9% to 25.7%.28 Here, the MAI-rich grains in perovskite films likely lead to the facile coalescence of grains due to the low activation energy for grain boundary motion, as in the case of the Cu-rich CuInGaSe films, while the presence of PbI2 phase in the films can suppress the grain boundary motion and thus the formation of large grains. Actually, we also found the same relationship of grain size with PbI2 concentration in films prepared using dual-source vacuum evaporation. However, for dual-source evaporation, the films with large grains cracked much more easily upon air exposure; therefore, perovskite films only with grains below 500 nm were observed.18,29 As yet, we do not know the reason that these dual-source evaporated perovskite films crack so readily; however, it most likely originates from the vertically inhomogeneous composition distribution of the perovskite films. In fact, this relationship of grain size with MAI concentration may not only be applied for the vacuum process, but is also a general rule for the growth of perovskite films.

(b)–(f) Surface SEM images of the evaporated films at a low pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa with different molar ratios between MAI and PbI2. The ratios are 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 2.0, and 2.1. (g) Plot of average MAPbI3 grain size and unconverted PbI2 concentration with different molar ratios. 
Based on the above results, we can see that the growth pressure is a critical parameter on the growth of perovskite film prepared by flash evaporation. A transport-determined growth model can be proposed to explain the growth mechanism, as shown in Fig. 3. The whole process of the film growth prepared by this flash evaporation method includes the following four processes. The first process and the second process are the decomposition of the perovskite precursor and the evaporation of the material, respectively. The first process leads to decomposition of the precursor into MAI and PbI2 particles. The evaporation process then follows. If a slow increase of the source temperature by increasing the current slowly is adopted during evaporation, the MAI rather than PbI2 is evaporated first due to its high vapor pressure at the same temperature. Moreover, the MAI molecules alone without PbI2 phase have difficulty absorbing on the substrate.13 Therefore, the inevitable result of a PbI2-rich film, even using a MAI to PbI2 ratio of 3.0, appeared in the XRD spectra (Fig. S3†). Therefore, it is important to ensure these two materials evaporate simultaneously. The key point of flash evaporation is to increase the source temperature in a very short time, leading to the simultaneous evaporation of MAI and PbI2. When the current passes through the molybdenum foil, the foil is heated immediately to above 1000 °C in less than 3 s (this temperature can be roughly estimated by the shining white color of the foil when heating). This high temperature leads to instantaneous evaporation of both PbI2 and MAI and consequently results in perovskite films with vertical homogenous compositions.

The most important process is the third process, in which the different growth pressure strongly affects the transport behavior of PbI2 and MAI from the source to the substrate and thus determines the film composition and morphology. Under a high growth pressure of 10 Pa, which is the same pressure as that adopted by Bolink et al.,26 the mean free path of the particles is about 0.06 cm according to the formula λmfp = 5 × 10−3/P, where λmfp is the mean free path (centimeters) and P is the pressure (Torr); therefore, the particles evaporated from the source collide with Ar atoms hundreds of times before reaching the substrate. This collision-determined transport process could be similar for both MAI and PbI2 evaporated particles, resulting in the homogenous distribution of MAI and PbI2 in the spaces of the nearby source, as shown in Fig. 3a. Therefore, pure MAPbI3 phase without excess PbI2 and MAI in the films can be achieved with the same molar concentration (a MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 1.0 in the precursor), as confirmed by the XRD results shown in Fig. 1a. Several control samples located at different places can be used to identify the distribution of MAI and PbI2 vapor in the chamber. The presence of pure MAPbI3 phase on sample 1, as evidenced by the XRD result in Fig. S4,† can further confirm the speculation of homogenous distribution of MAI and PbI2 in the nearby space. The clean surfaces of control samples 2 to 4, which are placed far away from the source, prove that the distributions of MAI and PbI2 particles are in limited spaces due to loss of kinetic energy during collision.
In contrast, for a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa, the mean free path is about 1.33 m, indicating the occurrence of almost negligible collision during transport of the evaporated particles from the source to the substrate. The angle distributions of evaporated PbI2 and MAI particles are therefore responsible for the final film composition. As shown in Fig. 3b, all control samples (1 to 4) show a shallow, white and hazy surface with the presence of MAI phase only, no matter what molar ratio of MAI to PbI2 is adopted, as evidenced by the typical XRD result shown in Fig. S5.† In particular, samples 1 and 2, both of which are supposed to be clean on the surface if an angle distribution of evaporated MAI particles exists because they are placed below the source and face up from the substrate, are covered with MAI films. Therefore, in contrast to the distribution of PbI2 particles with an angle of about 50°, as denoted schematically in Fig. 3b, the evaporated MAI particles are most likely a source of gas which can be distributed anywhere in the growth chamber. The limited-space distribution of PbI2 and the full-space distribution nature of MAI can result in the absence of MAI in the as-deposited film with a MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 1.0 in the precursor, as evidenced by the XRD results in Fig. 1b. Actually, an appropriate supplemental amount of MAI, as in our case with the MAI to PbI2 molar ratio of 2.0 in the precursor, should be added to achieve pure MAPbI3 films without excess PbI2 (Fig. 1b).
The diffusion and nucleation of particles on the substrate surface is involved in the fourth process, which is determined by the kinetic energy of the evaporated particles. This can be evidenced by the above film surface morphology, which is influenced mainly by the diffusion and the nucleation of the particles. For the films prepared under a high growth pressure of 10 Pa, the rod-like grains with pinholes and voids at the surface, as shown in Fig. 2a, may result from the lower kinetic energy and insufficient diffusion of the arriving particles. In contrast, dense films without voids or pinholes can be achieved by a sufficient lateral diffusion of evaporated particles for films prepared with a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa; this is because there are fewer collisions and hence less energy loss of the evaporated particles.
We then prepared solar cells with FTO/PCBM/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au using our perovskite films. The corresponding schematic structure and the cross-section SEM image are shown in Fig. S6.† The PCBM layer is obviously beneficial to the performance of the perovskite solar cell (especially for FF and JSC), as shown in Fig. S7;† this has been discussed by several groups and was adopted in all our cells.30 As shown in Table 1, for most of the devices, a high VOC of about 0.99 V can be obtained, which is often observed in perovskite solar cells prepared by evaporation methods. For both perovskite films with pure MAPbI3 phase, a higher JSC of 15.81 mA cm−2 can be achieved from the 260 nm-thick devices prepared under a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa, as compared to 9.19 mA cm−2 from the devices prepared under a high growth pressure of 10 Pa. This higher JSC can be confirmed by the corresponding IPCE spectra, shown in Fig. S8.† The higher JSC can be ascribed to the larger grain size and better crystallinity of the films prepared under a low growth pressure, which reduces the grain boundaries and defects and thus decreases the probability of carrier recombination.
Notably, JSC and FF increase obviously with increasing grain size until the films are cracked due to the presence of excess MAI, as shown in Fig. 4. The improvement of JSC with increasing grain size has also been verified for solution-based perovskite solar cells.31–36 The larger diffusion length and the higher carrier mobility of the perovskite films are suggested to be responsible for this improvement. Herein, we observed similar device performance improvement with increasing grain size for the evaporated perovskite films, confirming that control of the perovskite grain size is important for improvement of the performance of solar cells based on these films.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the transport-determined growth model of flash evaporation; low growth pressure proved to be critical to the film morphology and, therefore, to the device performance. The dense perovskite film can only be achieved under a low growth pressure of 5 × 10−3 Pa, while the films prepared under a high pressure of 10 Pa present a surface morphology of step-like grains with voids. More importantly, the grain size of the perovskite films can be controlled by the MAI/PbI2 ratio in the precursor, and the presence of PbI2 phase in the films can suppress the grain growth. Additionally, JSC and FF of the flash-evaporated perovskite solar cells increase with increasing grain size of the perovskite films. This work provides the insight that the importance of controlling the perovskite grain size is universal for the performance improvement of solar cells based on both solution and evaporated perovskite films.
