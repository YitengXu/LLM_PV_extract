    AbstractThe ionic defects at hetero-junction interfaces are known to attract and trap carriers through surface electrostatic forces, which play a crucial role in the efficiency and intrinsic stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This study utilized functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to chemically link the SnO2/perovskite interface, affecting both the trap states and energy levels. Theory and experiments suggest that the CNTs act as electron donors to SnO2 and the Pb-cluster-based perovskite, resulting in n-type doping of SnO2 and shifting the 6p-orbitals of the Pb-cluster to the conduction band (CB) edge, converting deep trap states to shallower ones. Using the interface linker, PSC devices' power conversion efficiency (PCE) was increased to 24.04%, with a high fill factor of 83%. Additionally, the PSCs showed improved operational and thermal stability, retaining 88.15% of the initial efficiency after 1000 hours under one sun illumination at 65°C heating.
