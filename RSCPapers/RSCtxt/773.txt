    , Accepted 23rd October 2021First published on 29th October 2021AbstractIt is crucial to develop high-efficiency simple-structure small molecular acceptors (SMAs) having a shortened synthetic route and lower cost. Herein, two simple SMAs, BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F, with the A–D–A′–D–A architecture were primarily synthesized via a simple three-step route in high yields, based on the central acceptor (A′) unit of benzodithiophenedione (BDD), the spacing donor (D) unit of thienothiophene (TT) and the terminal acceptor (A) unit of dicyanomethylene indanone (IC) or its fluorinated analog (IC-4F). The influence of the molecular structure on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties was primarily studied. The results show that the fluorine-free BDDTTIC exhibits better solubility and higher LUMO energy levels (−3.81 eV) than the fluorinated BDDTTIC-4F. Moreover, the PM6:BDDTTIC based OSCs show better photovoltaic properties than the PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs by optimizing the polymer donor material, donor/acceptor ratio and 1-chloronaphthalene additive ratio. An increasing power conversion efficiency of 5.62% with a high open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V was obtained in the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC-based device, which is almost two times higher than that of the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC-4F-based device. This work provides a potential direction to further construct high-efficiency BDD-based SMAs.
1. Introduction
Since Zhan and co-workers reported the milestone work on a multiple fused-ring non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (SMA) of 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-di cyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC) in 2015,1 the multiple fused-ring SMAs have inspired considerable studies due to their excellent characteristics such as strong light-harvesting capability, easy crystallization and tunable energy level.2,3 Subsequently, in 2019, Zou et al. developed a high-efficiency SMA, (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (Y6) with an eight-fused-ring core.4 A core with a rigid donor–acceptor–donor (DA′D) architecture allows for an increase in absorption intensity and extending the spectral absorption range (∼931 nm).5,6 Thus, great progress has been made and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the Y6-based binary devices has exceeded 18%.7 However, these multiple fused-ring SMAs usually involve multi-step synthesis and complex purification,8 which are unfavorable for structure optimization.
At the same time, simple-structure small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with a few fused-ring structure and the acceptor–donor–core–donor–acceptor (A–D–C–D–A) backbone have been developed rapidly, which are easy to obtain via a shortened synthetic route in recent years. Their molecular design strategies mainly include: (1) tailoring the multiple fused-ring cores into three-fused-ring or simpler aromatic units linking through chemical bonds; (2) introducing S⋯O, F⋯H, and F⋯S and other non-covalent intramolecular interactions to manage molecular planarity.9–11 Using these strategies, some simple-structured SMAs were reported, which have a notable A–D–D′–D–A or A–D–A′–D–A architecture according to the electronic properties of the central core unit. Their photovoltaic properties were gradually renovated. Among the A–D–D′–D–A-type SMAs, the ones with the D′ unit of para-difluorobenzene or para-dialkoxy-benzene exhibited better photovoltaic properties.12–16 For instance, in 2018, Chen et al. reported a SMA, HC-PCIC, bearing a difluorophenylene core and cyclo-pentadithiophene (CPDT) arms. The devices based on the poly-[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)]) (PBDB-TF):HC-PCIC blend showed a PCE of 11.49%.14 In 2019, Bo et al. reported a similar SMA, DOC2C6-2F, with a 2,5-bis(alkyloxy)phenylene core. The optimized device exhibited an outstanding PCE of 13.24% with a much high short-circuit current (Jsc) of 21.35 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 73.15%.17 In 2020, Chen synthesized a simpler SMA, PTB4Cl, with a thiophene-phenyl backbone, two-dimensional phenyl chain and halogenated terminal. The devices based on the PBDB-TF:PTB4Cl blend also exhibited a fine PCE of 12.76%.18 However, the electron-donating ability of the donor–donor–donor (D–D′–D) blocks is too strong, leading to an energetically unfavorable hole transfer from SMA to donor.12 Hence, it is important to use an electron-accepting A′ unit instead of an electron-donating D′ unit as the central unit to lower the HOMO energy level. Recently, our group developed a class of simple-structure SMAs using the simple and weak electron-deficient thiazolo–thiazole (TTz) as the central A′ unit, which displayed an improved PCE of 8.77% with a Voc of 0.90 V by optimizing the molecular structure and device technology.19,20 Other simple fused ring A′ units, such as benzothiadiazole (BT),21,22 benzotriazole (BTz),23,24 benzodithiophenedione (BDD)25 and their derivatives, were further employed as central building blocks to construct A–D–A′–D–A type SMAs. In 2021, Huang et al. synthesized a SMA, NoCA-5, bearing an alkoxyl substituted BTz core and n-octane-substituted CPDT terminal side chains. The NoCA-5-based device based on the J52:NoCA-5 blend exhibited a PCE of 14.5%, which was one of the record values for the simple-structure SMA-based devices.26
However, most of the high-efficiency A–D–A′–D–A type SMAs contained CPDT spacers, where the sp3-hybridized carbon-bonded side chains could affect the close π–π stacking and in turn limit the carrier transport for these acceptor materials.27 Furthermore, the alkyl CPDT spacer was synthesized via a 5-step reaction starting from 3-bromothiophene,28 which should increase the preparation cost of the SMAs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop A–D–A′–D–A type SMAs via simple synthetic route.
1,3-Bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) is a well-known electron-deficient moiety and has been used to build famous BDD-based polymer donors,29–34 such as PBDB-T, PM6 and PM7. The BDD unit has several advantages for the construction of photovoltaic materials. (1) Its thiophene ring suspending on the conjugated main chain has smaller dihedral angles with adjacent units to ensure molecular planarity. (2) Two strong electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in the thiophene unit can further reduce the molecular HOMO energy level. (3) Two carbonyl groups can easily form an intramolecular non-covalent bond with the adjacent S atom on thiophene, which can enhance the absorption and reduce the perturbation energy of the molecule. (4) The 5, 7-position in the BDD unit can be easily functionalized with an alkyl chain to improve the solubility and fine-tune the morphology. Hence, rapid progress has been achieved in the BDD-based polymer donors and their OSCs pairing with non-fullerene acceptors.5–7,35 However, there are few reports on the BDD-based acceptors until very recently. In 2020, Geng et al. synthesized a SMA, BCPDT-2, with BDD and CPDT units. Devices based on the PBDB-T:BCPDT-2 blend exhibited a PCE of 10.65%.36 In 2021, Chen et al. synthesized a SMA, BDDEH-4F.25 Devices based on PM6:BDDEH-4F showed an increased PCE of 12.59% with a Jsc of 22.57 mA cm−2. However, the same CPDT spacer is used in BCPDT-2 and BDDEH-4F. Thienothiophene (TT) is a common electron-donating unit with a simple structure and modifiable sites. It can be synthesized using a simpler 2-step reaction in comparison with the CPDT unit.37 it is often used to construct fused-ring SMAs, but seldom in simple-structured SMAs.
Given the potential of the BDD unit, it is crucial to explore simpler A–D–A′–D–A type SMAs based on the BDD unit and study the structure–property relationship. Herein, we designed and synthesized two simple SMAs: BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F (Fig. 1) with a BDD core and two thienothiophene (TT) spacers, as well as two terminals of dicyanomethylene indanone or a fluorinated analog. The optoelectronic properties, carrier mobilities, morphologies and photovoltaic performances of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F were systematically investigated. The structure–property relationship was further discussed.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F are depicted in Fig. 1 and the details on synthesis are provided in the ESI.† Firstly, a two-fold Stille cross-coupling was carried out between compounds 1 and 2 to obtain compound 3 in 85.8% yield. Then, Vilsmeier–Haack reaction was performed to obtain a dialdehyde compound 4 in 86.7% yield. Finally, BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F were obtained through Knoevenagel condensation between compound 4 and 3-dicycanovinylindan-1-one or 5,6-difluorinated analog in 86.8% and 84.5% yields, respectively. Both SMAs were obtained using three reactions in high yields. The structures were characterized by NMR and TOF-MS (Fig. S1–S7, ESI†). However, due to the strong polar effect of the fluorine atoms, BDDTTIC-4F exhibits reduced solubility (10 mg·mL−1) than BDDTTIC (13 mg mL−1) in chloroform.
Fig. S13(a) (ESI†) shows the thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F. Both SMAs exhibit high thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of 319.3 °C and 310.9 °C at 5% weight loss, respectively. Fig. S8(b) (ESI†) shows the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curves of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F. There is an obvious melting peak for both SMAs in the first heating process, wherein BDDTTIC-4F shows a higher melting peak at 289 °C than BDDTTIC (261 °C). This reveals that both SMAs have a similar crystallite structure behavior and BDDTTIC-4F has a stronger intermolecular interaction than BDDTTIC. However, there are no obvious exothermic and endothermic peaks during the cooling or the second heating process. This indicates that crystallization can easily occur in the presence of a solvent but highly suppressed when cooled from the melt.38
2.2 Absorption and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F in chloroform solution (approximately 10−5 mol L−1) and neat films are illustrated in Fig. 2. The corresponding absorption data are outlined in Table 1. The results show that, in a diluted chloroform solution, BDDTTIC-4F gives a maximum extinction coefficient of 1.81 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 604 nm, which is slightly higher than that of BDDTTIC (1.55 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 594 nm). This indicates that the incorporation of fluorine atoms has enhanced the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. On the other hand, in their thin films, the absorption onset is almost identical, but the maximum absorption peaks are quite different. The stronger shoulder observed in the BDDTTIC absorption profile rather than in BDDTTIC-4F would result from the difference in the packing structure. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F films are calculated to be 1.62 and 1.61 eV. It should be pointed out that the absorption range for both SMAs here is complementary to the common polymer donors, such as J7139 and PTB7-Th,40 but more overlapped with PBDB-T41 and PM6.42

Fig. 3a shows the oxidation and reduction behaviors of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. Their electrochemical data are presented in Table 1. The onsets of the reduction potential (Ered) and the oxidation potential (Eox) are −0.54/1.46 V for BDDTTIC and −0.39/1.56 V for BDDTTIC-4F versus the Ag/AgCl electrode. Therefore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) are −5.81/−3.81 eV for BDDTTIC and −5.90/−3.95 eV for BDDTTIC-4F. It is obvious that the non-fluorinated BDDTTIC shows a concurrent increase in EHOMO and ELUMO than the fluorinated BDDTTIC-4F, which is beneficial for BDDTTIC to obtain a high Voc in OSCs.

2.3 Theoretical calculations
The most optimized molecular geometries and frontier orbitals of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F were simulated using density functional theory (DFT) with a B3LYP/6-31G* program (Fig. 4). To simplify the calculation, long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. There is a good planarity observed from the side view of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F, which favors π–π stacking. It is observed that the dipole moment of BDDTTIC is 2.46 D, which is significantly smaller than that (5.09 D) of BDDTTIC-4F. This implies that BDDTTIC-4F has a stronger ICT effect than BDDTTIC,43 which is consistent with their UV-vis absorption profiles. The calculated LUMO and HOMO energy levels of BDDTTIC-4F are 0.15 eV and 0.13 eV lower than those of BDDTTIC, which agrees well with the results obtained from the CV data.

2.4 Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs were studied using the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al. In order to select an appropriate polymer donor, we, respectively, used PTB7-Th, J71, PBDB-T and PM6 to mix with BDDTTIC and make OSCs since these polymers as donors have a matched energy level with BDDTTIC. The detailed photovoltaic data of these polymer donors: BDDTTIC based OSCs are outlined in Table S1 (ESI†). It is observed that the device based on the PM6:BDDTTIC blend exhibits best photovoltaic properties than the other BDDTTIC based devices using PTB7-Th, J71 and PBDB-T as donors. Thus, the optimized polymer donor is PM6 although its absorption profile has more overlap with that of BDDTTIC or BDDTTIC-4F. The devices based on the PM6:BDDTTIC blend and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F blend were further optimized at different donor/acceptor (D/A) ratios and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive ratios. The recorded current density–voltage (J–V) curves at different D/A and additives ratios are shown in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI†). Their photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†), respectively. Fig. 5 shows the J–V curves of the optimized PM6:BDDTTIC and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs under illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic data of these OSCs at optimized D/A and CN ratios are listed in Table 2.

It is observed that the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC based OSCs were obtained at a D/A ratio of 1:2 and a CN ratio of 0.75% in weight, which exhibited the best device performance with a maximum PCE of 5.62% and a high Voc of 0.95 V. The optimal PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs were obtained only at a D/A ratio of 1:2 in weight, which showed an inferior PCE of 2.92% and a Voc of 0.78 V. More surprisingly, the introduction of a CN additive is harmful for PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs, as the PCE value gradually decreases with increasing CN ratios. Here, the calculated energy loss (Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc) further supports the reason why the PM6:BDDTTIC based OSCs exhibit a higher PCE value than PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs, in which Eloss values of 0.67 eV for the former and 0.83 eV for the later OSCs are observed.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal blend films are depicted in Fig. 5(b). Maximum EQE values of 47.8% and 36.1% are observed for the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F blend films, respectively. The calculated JSC values obtained from the EQE curves are 9.21 and 7.02 mA cm−2 for the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurements. The higher EQE for the PM6:BDDTTIC blend film demonstrates that its OSCs exhibit more efficient charge generation and separation than PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs.
The charge generation and separation process has been deeply studied for the PM6:BDDTTIC and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs using the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) and charge separation probabilities P(E, T) (Fig. 5c). The Jsat and exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) were calculated to be 10.65 mA cm−2 and 88.73% for the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC based OSCs, respectively. This Pdiss value is higher than that of the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs (81.48%). This indicates that the exciton dissociation and charge collection processes are more efficient in PM6:BDDTTIC based OSCs than in PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs.8,43 The dark J–V characteristics of these devices were also studied. As shown in Fig. 5d, the BDDTTIC based device shows reduced leakage (shunt) currents in the region 0–0.6 V, indicating that its shunt resistance (Rsh) is higher than that of the BDDTTIC-4F based device,44 which means there is an increased amount of electron transfer from the active layer to the electrode interface. The lowest dark saturation current densities (J0) of about 3.38 × 10−6 and 1.61 × 10−4 mA cm−2 were obtained, respectively, for the optimal PM6:BDDTTIC and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F based OSCs. It is suggested that the PM6:BDDTTIC based device has the lowest leakage current, which is considered as the undesirable current injected from the electrodes prior to the turn on voltage. Therefore, PM6:BDDTTIC based devices have lower recombination of free carriers and better efficiency of carrier extraction, corroborating with enhanced FF and overall PCE.39,45
2.5 Charge transport and morphology
Charge transport properties were investigated in the hole-only and electron-only devices using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 6). Under the optimal conditions, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the PM6:BDDTTIC blend films were measured to be 3.34 × 10−4 and 2.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, in the hole-only and electron-only devices, which are higher than the corresponding values (2.94 × 10−5 and 1.52 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the PM6:BDDTTIC-4F blend films. This implies that the PM6:BDDTTIC-based devices show higher and more balanced charge mobilities (μh/μe = 1.22) than the PM6:BDDTTIC-4F-based devices (μh/μe = 19.34). This favors higher FF and PCE in the PM6:BDDTTIC-based devices.8

The contact angles of deionized water (polar liquid) and diiodomethane (nonpolar liquid) on the surface of the SMA-based thin films were measured to estimate their surface energies (see Fig. S16 and Table S4, ESI†). The calculated surface energy of BDDTTIC (36.0 mN m−1) is more close to that of PM6 (37.0 mN m−1) compared to that of BDDTTIC-4F (43.4 mN m−1), indicating that the PM6:BDDTTIC blend films have better miscibility than the PM6:BDDTTIC-4F blend films. Fig. 7 shows the morphologies of the PM6:BDDTTIC and PM6:BDDTTIC-4F blend films at an optimal D/A ratio of 1:2 and a CN ratio of 0.75%. As shown in Fig. 7a and c, the PM6: BDDTTIC blend film shows a smooth surface with a root mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.29 nm, smaller than that of the PM6:BDDTTIC-4F blend film (3.23 nm) only at an optimal D/A ratio of 1:2. As shown in Fig. 7b and d, the PM6:BDDTTIC blend film exhibits more pronounced phase separation and better interpenetrating networks after the addition of another additive CN at a ratio of 0.75%, which could improve charge mobilities in the active layer. Therefore, due to this morphology, the PM6:BDDTTIC-based devices exhibit higher Jsc and FF values at an optimal D/A ratio of 1:2 and a CN ratio of 0.75%.

3. Conclusion
In summary, two simple A–D–A′–D–A type SMAs, BDDTTIC and BDDTTIC-4F, were primarily obtained based on the BDD core, two TT spacers, and terminal IC or its fluorinated analog; they can be easily prepared using three simple reactions. The structure–property relationship was revealed for the BDD-based SMAs. The influence of the polymer donors, donor/acceptor ratio and additive CN ratio on the photoelectronic and photovoltaic properties was discussed. An adequate PCE of 5.62% with a high Voc of 0.95 V was obtained in PM6:BDDTTIC-based OSCs although BDDTTIC has a more absorption spectral overlap with the selected polymer PM6. This work presents that BDD is a promising electron-withdrawing building block to construct simple A–D–A′–D–A type SMAs. It will be interesting and worthy to optimize device performance of the BDD-based SMAs through selecting suitable donors and process technology in the future studies.
