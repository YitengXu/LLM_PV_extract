It is also more effective than Pt–WO3 in catalyzing reaction of methanol with air. Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 could find wide application as a mild oxidizing catalyst.
There is a significant interest in photosensitised reactions on semiconductor particles for solar energy conversion1 and the removal of dyes and organic pollutants from wastewater.2Methyl orange is a simple azo dye that has been used as a model system to probe the chemistry that takes place on semiconductor particles.3 It is generally considered to be very stable to light and difficult to oxidize. It was suggested as a probe system in 1984 and since 1991 there have been more than 1000 papers using this dye to test photocatalysts.4
Noble metals deposited on semiconductor particles can act as co-catalysts for reactions such as the reduction and oxidation of water.1 While studying tungstates and niobates photosensitisers we discovered that platinised semiconductor particles (Pt–WO3 and Pt–HCa2Nb3O10) can activate oxygen to oxidize methyl orange in water, in the dark, at room temperature. These materials also oxidize alcohols with air in water, which suggests that they may be suitable for the chemical treatment of wastewater or as catalysts in fuel cells. Previous research has shown that Pt–WO3 can be used as a catalyst for methanol fuel cells, where the WO3 works synergistically by helping the removal of carbon monoxide from platinum.5 Our work shows that Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 particles, which have been used for the photooxidation and photoreduction of water,6 are more effective than Pt–WO3 for the reaction of methanol with air in water.
When Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 is added to an aqueous solution of methyl orange there is an initial small loss of the dye due to primarily adsorption onto the low surface area (7.5 m2 g−1) material. In the absence of platinum or when oxygen is removed from the solution, by bubbling with nitrogen, there is no further change in the spectrum. When platinum was deposited onto the particles, by the photoreduction of Pt4+ ions, and a mixture of the resulting material and methyl orange solution is subsequently illuminated with ultraviolet (λ > 300 nm) light, the dye was destroyed over a period of minutes through a process that is typical of most semiconductor photooxidation catalysts. There is no clear isosbestic point (Fig. 1a), since the reaction proceeds through a number of steps including demethylation, hydroxyl attack on the phenyl ring and eventually cleavage of the azo bond to give a colorless solution.3
 Fig. 1  (a) Methyl orange oxidation in water photosensitised by Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 with light irradiation (λ > 300 nm); (b) methyl orange oxidation in water, in the dark, catalyzed by Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 (20 mg of 1% Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 in 30 ml water, 25 °C). 
Surprisingly, we find that, when a dispersion of Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 is not illuminated, the dye is oxidized by air in the dark. During the first phase of this process, the reaction proceeds smoothly with an isosbestic point at 398 nm. LC/MS shows that the products formed in this phase are due to complete demethylation of methyl orange (ESI†). The reaction continues over a period of hours resulting in further oxidation and loss of colour and proceeds via an intermediate species with an absorption maximum at 374 nm. These spectral changes are shown in Fig. 1b. This reaction appears milder and more selective than the photosensitised oxidation of methyl orange with TiO2 where LC/MS shows a range of products resulting from hydroxyl attack on the aromatic rings.7
A similar though slower process is seen with Pt–WO3 and again there is no reaction in the absence of platinum or when air is removed from the dispersion. The main reaction intermediates for the oxidation of methyl orange are shown in Scheme 1.

To further understand the mechanism of these reactions we have studied the effect of the catalysts on the reaction between air and methanol. When Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 is added to methanol in water there is a rapid reaction which reduces the oxygen in a matter of minutes. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the results obtained with an oxygen electrode for Pt–HCa2Nb3O10, and Pt–WO3. The reaction continues at a similar rate when the dispersion is purged with air and the experiment repeated. After 5 repeats this corresponded to turnover numbers of 12 for Pt and 1.5 for Pt–HCa2Nb3O10. No reaction was seen with platinised titanium dioxide (Degussa P25) in the dark.

The rates for reduction of oxygen are shown in Table 1. Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 is substantially more effective. The high catalytic activity demonstrates the ability of these materials to activate molecular oxygen under ambient conditions.

Fig. 3 shows the different structures of WO3 and HCa2Nb3O10. Under the conditions of these experiments HCa2Nb3O10 is largely not delaminated and retains its layered structure as shown in Fig. 4a. The HRTEM image of Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 (Fig. 4b) demonstrates the fine dispersion of crystallized Pt nanoparticles on the surface of the semiconductor (Pt mean size 3.5 nm on mean size 1.4 μm HCa2Nb3O10 sheets—data in ESI†).

See ESI† for TEM images in different magnifications. 
Several factors may be important in the high catalytic activity of Pt–HCa2Nb3O10. The material has a higher surface area than Pt–WO3 and TEM images show that Pt is well dispersed on this catalyst. The Pt is present as nanoclusters which may be responsible for the high catalytic efficiency. HCa2Nb3O10 is similar to niobic acid (H8Nb6O10·xH2O) possessing strong acidity due to its labile protons8 which makes it a suitable catalyst for partial and total oxidative reactions. This Brønsted acidity is combined with the presence of Ca2+ in addition to the d0 centre, which will enhance the donor power of the lattice oxide compared to niobic acid and WO3.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that platinum loaded semiconductor particles have been shown to catalyze the reaction of air with methyl orange. The work also shows that Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 is substantially more effective than Pt–WO3 in catalyzing the oxidation of methanol by air at room temperature. This suggests that these materials could find wide application as mild oxidizing catalysts with air, and Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 may be superior to Pt–WO3 as a catalyst for methanol fuel cells.

        Catalytic wet air oxidation is seen as an important route to meet environmental challenges.9 High temperatures and pressures are often required. The findings in this paper suggest that Pt–HCa2Nb3O10 may help in identifying candidates for such processes under ambient conditions.
