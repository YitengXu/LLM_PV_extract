, Accepted 27th October 2015First published on 27th October 2015AbstractWe report experimental studies of “push–pull” organic dyes with three to six thiophene units as π-spacers, and their application as p-type sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Different from the widely explored model of increasing spacer length between donor and acceptor, in this paper, the distance between the donor and the semiconductor surface is elongated by inserting thiophene units. The effect of the increased π-spacer is systematically discussed. It turned out that four thiophene units could offer T4 with the highest performance. Further increased length instead, results in decreased Jsc values and finally decreased efficiencies. We estimate that the longer spacer could effectively prevent charge recombination on the NiO-dye surface, however, the increased thiophene units also decrease the conductance of the oligothiophene spacer, which is unfavorable for hole injection from dye molecule to the valence band of NiO. The results demonstrate that the distance between donor and the semiconductor should be optimized. The appropriate length is required to balance charge recombination and charge transporting efficiency.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been one of the most efficient photovoltaic devices since their inception by Grätzel M., O'Regan B. and et al. in the 1990s.1 Up until now, DSSCs using sensitized n-type semiconductors such as TiO2 as the photoelectrode (n-DSSCs) are mostly studied and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 13% has been achieved.2–4 However, as their inverse model, p-type DSSCs that inject holes into the valence band of a p-type semiconductor such as NiO from the excited state of a sensitizer have rarely been studied, and their overall efficiencies still lag behind their counterparts.5–7 For example, the highest performance of p-DSSCs achieved to date is still less than 3%.8 As a result, the deficient p-DSSCs have greatly impeded the development of tandem solar cells, which is able to surpass the so called Shockley–Queisser limit.9,10 On the other hand, it has also been reported that the p-type cathodes are promising in development of the photo-electrocatalytic devices for fuel production.5,11,12 Therefore, it is very necessary to investigate p-DSSCs and to improve its performance.
The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current (Jsc) are key factors that determine the overall efficiency of a device. For certain conducting oxide and specified electrolyte, the Voc is almost fixed, since the Voc depicts the difference between the Fermi-level of the semiconductor and the redox potential of the electrolyte.13 By changing the electrolyte, the solar cell efficiency could be significantly enhanced. For example, the “star molecule” PMI–6T–TPA shows an efficiency of 0.43% using the I−/I3− electrolyte, and its performance increased to 1.3% when tris(1,2-diaminoethane)cobalt(II)/(III) based electrolytes were used.14,15 And quite recently, devices based on dye PMI–6T–TPA incorporating [Fe(acac)3]0/1− as the electrolyte have achieved the highest reported short-circuit current (Jsc = 7.65 mA cm−2), and energy conversion efficiency of 2.51%, making the investigation of p-DSSCs more promising.8 However, the Co(II)/(III) and [Fe(acac)3]0/1− based electrolytes are confronted with the defect of air-sensitivity and need strict assembly conditions, thus greatly restricting their practical use. On the other hand, the photo-current is limited mainly by the transport resistance (charge collection efficiency) and various recombination pathways that are closely related to the dye molecules and the semiconductor used.16–18 As a result, intelligent dye design and/or development of higher carrier mobility semiconductors are in urgent need. Particularly, exploiting efficient sensitizers has attracted wide interest in recent years and promising results have been obtained. Since Lindquist and co-workers' first demonstration for generation of cathodic photocurrent with an erythrosine-sensitized NiO cathode, numerous organic sensitizers such as coumarin, perylene monoimide (PMI) and porphyrin derivatives have been explored.19–22 “Push–pull” dyes with an anchoring group on the triphenylamine (TPA) donor were first developed by Sun et al., and an energy conversion efficiency of 0.15% was reported.23–25 Arylamine-based dyes with two anchoring groups were developed by Lin and co-workers, to facilitate hole injection, and power conversion efficiency between 0.06 and 0.11% were obtained.26,27 By increasing the length of the oligothiophene bridge ligands between TPA donor and the PMI acceptor, long-lived charge separated excited states were achieved, resulting in a high efficiency of 0.43%.14 Therefore, it is very important to explore new dye molecules to achieve higher efficiencies.
Generally for p-type dye molecules, the anchoring group is located on the donor moiety to facilitate for hole injection. Besides, the acceptor moiety should locate far away from the semiconductor surface (the anchoring group of the sensitizer), in order to prevent charge recombination between the injected holes in NiO and the electrons in the LUMO orbital of the dye molecule.28 In this regard, the design motif of increasing the distance between the donor and the acceptor unit has been widely adopted. For example, Wu and coworkers demonstrate that adopting a double acceptor/single anchor in a TPA-PMI based dye molecule, the increased π-bridge could yield high photocurrent of 7.4 mA cm−2.29 He et al. indicate that by increasing fluorene units between triphenylamine donor and PMI acceptor, zzx-op1-2 dye with two fluorene spacer units exhibits an unprecedented photocurrent density of 7.57 mA cm−2 and high PCE of 0.357%.30
Different from the commonly adopted method, recently we found in a series of triphenylamine-dicyanovinyl based dye molecules, the increased π-bridge length (oligothiophene) between donor and semiconductor is more efficient than that between donor and acceptor. Compared to the pioneering molecule P1, solar cells fabricated from dye T1 containing one thiophene spacer at the carboxyl side exhibited efficiency of 0.11% using the I−/I3− electrolyte, corresponding to about 50% increase of P1.31 For comparison, bithiophene is also introduced as spacer between donor and acceptor to get T2, which only shows poorer η of 0.07%.31 Obviously, the thiophene inserted between donor and carboxyl led to higher efficiency. Consequently, three thiophene units are inserted to get dye T3, and it showed increased efficiency of 0.19%, indicating that the increased spacer length between the donor and the anchor could effectively increase the solar cell performances.32 Later, four thiophene rings are incorporated, and higher efficiency of 0.208% is acquired.33 Obviously, the power conversion efficiency gradually increased when the oligothiophene length increased from one to four, demonstrating that our design strategy is rational, which could effectively prevent the hole in NiO valence band from recombination with the electrons in the LUMO orbitals of the excited dye. Therefore, we are wondering how will the solar cell performance be affected, if longer oligothiophene bridge is used between the donor and the NiO surface (i.e. more thiophene rings are introduced). In this regard, dyes containing five and six thiophene rings as spacer are synthesized in this work, and the effect of the spacer length is systematically investigated with respect to the solar cell efficiency (Scheme 1).

Experimental section
Synthesis of compound T5
To a solution of compound 7 (185 mg, 0.15 mmol) in degassed toluene (50 mL) were added malononitrile (29.7 mg, 0.45 mmol) and 0.2 mL Et3N. The mixture was stirred at 90 °C overnight under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, water (100 mL) was added, and the solution was extracted with CHCl3 before dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.

Fabrication and characterization of p-DSSCs
The preparation of NiO nanoparticle film was according to the literature reported methods.37 NiO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving anhydrous NiCl2 (1 g) and F108 (1 g) into a mixture of Mill-Q water (3 mL) and ethanol (6 mL). The film was prepared by two cycle “doctor-blading” the precursor solution onto the substrate, and after each “doctor-blading” process the film was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The NiO electrode with a 0.1 cm2 geometric area was immersed in a 0.3 mM dye solution (THF:EtOH/V:V 1:1) at room temperature for 16 h, followed by rinsing with THF–EtOH mixture and drying in air.
The solar cells were assembled with a platinized FTO counter electrode. The redox electrolyte (containing 1.0 M LiI and 0.1 M I2 in acetonitrile) was introduced through a pre-drilled hole at the counter electrode, which was sealed afterwards. The current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2420 m in dark and under illumination of a sun 2000 solar simulator (Abet) with 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G spectrum. The intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated by standard Si photovoltaic cell. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed without bias illumination with respect to a calibrated silicon diode. The monochromic light was supplied by xenon light illuminating through a Cornerstone monochromator. A chopper was placed after the monochromator and the signal was collected by Merlin lock-in radiometry after amplification by the current preamplifier. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out with CHI under illumination at open-circuit potential and in the dark with AC amplitude of 10 mV over a range from 10000 to 0.1 Hz.
Results and discussion
The general synthetic routes for these dyes are depicted in Scheme S1.† The synthesis of T1–T4 have been reported in our previous work.31–33 Dyes T5 and T6 were synthesized in a similar manner to T3. Compound 1 (5′′-bromo-3′,3′′-dihexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5-carbaldehyde) was synthesized according to the methods reported in literature.34 The oligothiophene linkages were synthesized through Stille-coupling reaction in high yield.35 Then they were brominated and followed by Suzuki-coupling reaction with (4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)boronic acid.36 Further condensation of aromatic aldehyde with malononitrile yielded the final products. All of the intermediates as well as the final compounds have been fully characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF spectrometry, and elemental analysis as well. Syntheses of the final compounds T5 and T6 are shown below, and the detailed synthetic procedures are shown in the ESI.†
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the triphenylamine-dicyanovinyl based dyes (T3–T6) in chloroform (CHCl3) are presented in Fig. 1. Two absorption bands could be observed, with the one at around 400 nm corresponding to the π–π* transition of the whole conjugation system, and the one located at longer wavelengths (about 500 nm) ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer band (ICT) from the triphenylamine donor to the dicyanovinyl acceptor. Compared to dye T3, the absorption spectra (especially at the range from 400–500 nm) of the other dyes get significantly broadened and stronger, due to the increased alkylated thiophene units that extend the whole molecular conjugation. Apparently, the π–π* transition of these dyes gradually increases with the increased oligothiophene length, and this leads to higher absorption intensity at 390 nm for T5 and T6 than their ICT bands at around 500 nm. It has been reported that when the oligothiophene length increases, there are large number of conformations sampled in a fully elongated junction that will decrease the overall conjugation length in these oligothiophenes.38 Consequently, the absorption spectra hardly increases when the thiophene spacer increases from T5 to T6. Detailed photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. When these dyes are adsorbed onto the NiO film, all of the dyes show broad absorption ranging from 350–600 nm. From Fig. 1b, the absorption intensity of T4–T6 on NiO is much higher than that of T3, especially the absorption at about 450 nm. And we also note that there is little change between the absorbance of T4, T5 and T6. The trend is similar to that measured in solution.

Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were performed in CH2Cl2 solution, using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. The optical bandgaps of these dyes were determined from the onset of the absorption spectra in solution (Eoptg = 1240/λ). The HOMO levels are calculated from the first oxidation potential, while the LUMO levels are obtained from the values of EHOMO and Eoptg. From the results listed in Table 1, the HOMO orbitals of the dyes studied are all below the top of NiO valence band (−5.04 eV), while the LUMO orbitals are all above that of the redox mediator (−4.15 eV), suggesting sufficient driving force for hole injection and dye regeneration of these dyes. The results indicate that the orbital levels of these dyes could be influenced by the increased thiophene units between the donor and the anchoring group. The increased thiophene units (from 3 to 5) elevate the HOMO level, while for the pentamer and the hexamer, their orbital levels are similar. The result is in agreement with their absorption spectra tendency.
Electron density distribution of the frontier orbitals of these dyes were studied using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)* level.39 The molecular-orbital energy diagrams were shown in Fig. 2. The four dyes have very similar LUMO distribution, and the LUMO orbitals are localized on the acceptor moieties and the adjacent spacers. The HOMO orbitals are quite similar, where the electron density is delocalized mainly on the triphenylamine and the adjacent thiophene groups, as well as the anchoring carboxyl groups. Apparently, as the oligothiophene chain increases, the HOMO orbitals locate far away from the acceptor moiety and spread across the oligothiophene chain, hence increasing conjugation length and meanwhile the distance between the acceptor moiety and the semiconductor surface. The orbital overlap between the donor and the acceptor is able to afford fast charge transition. When these dyes are adsorbed onto the NiO surface, the photoinduced holes can be effectively injected into the valence band of the semiconductor from the HOMO orbitals via the terminal anchoring group.

Typical current–voltage characteristics of p-DSSCs sensitized with the four dyes on double-layered NiO film using I−/I3− electrolyte were measured under standard AM 1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2). Usually, ethanol and acetonitrile are applied as solvents for preparation of dye solution, but our dyes show quite poor solubility in the two solvents. To overcome this problem, THF–EtOH mixed solution (V:V/1:1) was used to dissolve these dye molecules. The current–voltage curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 3 and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. As has been reported in our other work, when the regioregularly alkylated oligothiophene units was systematically varied from one to four, the corresponding solar cell efficiencies almost doubled (from 0.11% in T1 to 0.21% in T4). But further increased oligothiophene length will not improve of the performances concurrently. For T5 and T6, relatively lower efficiency of 0.186% and 0.178% were obtained, with lower Jsc of 4.51 and 4.02 mA cm−2, respectively. Obviously, the photocurrent gradually increased from T1 to T4, but then slightly decreased in T5 and T6, which is consistent with their photovoltaic performances.

The IPCE (incident to photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) spectra, as shown in Fig. 4, are consistent with their Jsc values. All of the dyes show very similar spectra from 350–650 nm with maximal values ranging from 22% to 32%. T4 shows the highest IPCE while T6 shows the lowest value. It is noteworthy that the IPCE spectra are not consistent with the trend of their absorption spectra. T5 and T6 with stronger absorption on NiO films do not result in high photovoltaic performances, instead, they show lower performances compared to T3 and T4. We also test the dye loading amounts of the four dyes on NiO films, to verify if this discrepancy came from the different dye density on the semiconductor surfaces. The results shown in Table 2 suggest that the four dyes have very similar dye loading amount. Therefore, different Jsc vales of the four dyes with different oligothiophene length should not be stemmed from their different adsorption capacities.
 Fig. 4  IPCE spectra of the T3–T6 sensitized solar cells. 
As shown in the J–V curves and IPCE spectra, by inserting four thiophene units between triphenylamine and carboxyl, both Jsc and Voc of the photoelectrode are significantly enhanced, while further increase of the thiophene units lead to decreased Jsc in T5 and T6. The effect of light harvesting abilities could be excluded, as has been discussed above. When the π-spacer between the donor and the carboxyl group increases to five and six thiophene units, the increased distance is advantageous for blocking charge recombination between the holes in NiO valence band and the electrons in the LUMO level of the dye molecules. However, according to the investigation of length-dependent conductance of oligothiophenes by Campos et al., compared to T4, when the thiophene units increase to pentamer and hexamer, the extra thiophene units will yield multiple rotational degrees of freedom, and will decrease the overall conductance of the oligothiophenes. Therefore, the charge transporting ability in T5 and T6 are inefficient.38 The speculation is in consistent with their Jsc values as well as the IPCE results, and could be further supported by the EIS measurements.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the charge recombination and charge transporting process in the devices. Impedance spectra (IS) of devices sensitized by T3–T6 at −0.09 V in the dark and at open-circuit voltage bias under illumination were performed. In dark with external bias, holes are injected from the external, followed by recombination at the metal oxide/electrolyte interface via oxidation of I− in the electrolyte. Thus recombination resistance (Rrec) at the metal oxide/electrolyte interface and the free charge lifetime could be obtained by analyzing the IS with equivalent circuit.40,41 Nyquist plots of NiO electrodes sensitized with the four dyes under −0.09 V bias are shown in Fig. 5, in which the semicircle diameter for the measured devices is T6 (481.1Ω) > T5 (374.5 Ω) > T4 (290.1 Ω) > T3 (283.7 Ω) in the dark condition, implying increased resistances as the oligothiophene length increases. Obviously, resistances of T5 and T6 against interfacial hole transfer from the NiO valence band to I− are higher than the T3 and T4 based device. This result supports the idea that the increased bridge length between the donor part and the NiO surface could help to retard the undesirable charge recombination.
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical impedance spectra on NiO electrodes sensitized with the dyes T3–T6 in the dark condition at −0.09 V, inset shows the EIS measured under 1 sun at open-circuit voltage. 
Under illumination at open-circuit voltage bias, there is no net current flow through the cell. All the injected holes from the excited dyes are recaptured by I− before being extracted to the external circuit. Meanwhile, the reduced dye is regenerated by I3−. Thus, the semicircle of the IS in the intermediate frequency range (inset of Fig. 5) represents the charge transfer resistance at the NiO/dye/electrolyte interface, which is the apparent combination effect of hole injection, charge recombination and the reduced dye regeneration processes.42 The semicircle diameter for the T4 based device is the smallest under illumination, indicating the fastest hole transporting ability in T4 (41.76 Ω) < T3 (45.13 Ω) ≈ T5 (45.46 Ω) < T6 (48.74 Ω). Consequently, although T5 and T6 have slower charge recombination at the metal oxide/electrolyte interface, their charge transporting abilities are weaker than T4, which, as we have mentioned above, should be related to the longer spacer between the donor and the anchoring point. The elongated distance also reduces the conductance of the oligothiophene spacer, which is unfavorable for charge transporting in T5 and T6. The more planar conformation in T4 results in broader absorption, and better charge transporting ability, thus provides dye T4 with the best performance among these dyes studied.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of dye molecules with different π-spacer length were investigated. The distance between the triphenylamine donor and the semiconductor surface is elongated by incorporating alkylated thiophene units. Their photophysical and photovoltaic performances are studied, and the effect of the increased thiophene units is systematically investigated. It turned out that the increased oligothiophene length does not necessarily lead to increased photocurrent. Dye T4 with four thiophene units as π-spacer shows the highest performance of 0.208%, with Jsc of 5.31 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.119 V. But further increased oligothiophene length will result in decreased Jsc, and thus decreased efficiency. The results indicate that in these dye molecules, appropriate π-spacer length is required to effectively prevent the unfavourable charge recombination between the holes in NiO VB band and the electrons in the LUMO of the excited state dye molecule, and therefore could increase the photocurrent. But too long distance (in T5 and T6) may also lead to lower conductance of the oligothiophene spacer and would be disadvantageous for charge transporting.
