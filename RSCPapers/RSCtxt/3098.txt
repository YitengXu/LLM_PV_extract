    , Accepted 4th August 2021First published on 5th August 2021AbstractIn recent years, the semiconductor bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) has attracted increasing attention as a potential visible-light-driven photocatalyst due to its simple composition, relatively narrow bandgap (2.2–2.8 eV), and high oxidation ability with deep valence band levels. Owing to the symmetry of its unit cell, Bi2O3 exists in more than one crystal form and exhibits phase-dependent photocatalytic properties. However, the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3 is a complex process, and its phase transformation usually occurs in a wide temperature range. Therefore, the development of Bi2O3 phases with a controllable microstructure and good photocatalytic properties is a great challenge. Hundreds of articles have been reported on the phase-selective synthesis and photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3. However, an interacting and critical review has rarely been reported, and thus it is essential to fill the gap in the literature. In this review, the phase-dependent photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3 is presented in detail. The phase-selective synthesis and temperature-dependent phase stability of highly active Bi2O3 are explored. The phase junction in Bi2O3 is reviewed, and the future perspective with an outlook on contemporary challenges is provided finally.Abdul Hannan ZahidAbdul Hannan Zahid received his B.Sc. and M.Sc.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades, sustainable strategies to alleviate the energy shortage and environmental pollution have been extensively investigated worldwide.1–3 Among the various approaches, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been found to be an attractive solution to the main global problems.4 Photocatalysis as an AOP is an eco-friendly process that has a great potential to deal with environmental and energy issues. The application of photocatalysis is not limited to the degradation of organic pollutants, including dyes and volatile organic compounds (VOCs),5–9 it also shows great promise as a bacteria disinfectant10 and for the removal of antibiotics from water.11 It has great potential to split water for hydrogen (H2) evolution as green energy fuel,12–16 reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce hydrocarbon fuels17–20 and convert toxic NOx (NO and NO2) into nitrates to stimulate plant growth.21,22 Also, it can be used for the selective synthesis of organic compounds10,23,24 and artificial ammonia.25 Photocatalysis is a simple technique, which requires a suitable semiconductor material, i.e., photocatalyst, and solar light as the energy source. When a photocatalyst in the photocatalytic environment is exposed to sunlight with energy equal to or greater than its bandgap energy (Eg), the electrons in its valence band (VB) are stimulated to the higher level conduction band (CB), while leaving holes in the VB. Generally, five complementary steps are involved in photocatalysis, including (i) light-harvesting, (ii) generation of electron–hole pairs under solar irradiation, (iii) separation of charge carriers and their migration to the catalyst surface, (iv) oxidation and reduction of holes and electrons with reactants, and (v) charge carrier recombination on the catalyst surface or in the bulk.2 The overall performance of a photocatalytic system is dependent on the efficiency of each step, while the kinetics and thermodynamics of these processes determine its overall efficiency.26 The most important property of a photocatalyst is a suitable electronic band structure with narrow bandgap energy to achieve a good visible-light response. Since Fujishima and Honda reported the photo-electrochemical generation of H2 using TiO2 (Eg, 3.0–3.2 eV),27 many photocatalysts have been reported, i.e., WO3, ZnO, Ag3PO4, Fe2O3, BiVO4, Bi2WO6, Cu2O, g-C3N4, TaON and CdS with a distinct bandgap energy of 2.6 eV, 3.2 eV, 2.4 eV, 2.3 eV, 2.5 eV, 2.6 eV, 2.0 eV, 2.73 eV, 2.5 eV and 2.4 eV (V vs. NHE), respectively.2,28–33 They all exhibited good solar light-harvesting properties but have various limitations of ultraviolet (UV) light activity, high charge carrier recombination rate, and difficult synthesis under mild conditions. Considering that 45% of the solar spectrum lies in the visible-light region34 and ≤ 5% solar light is composed of UV-light,35,36 researchers have been focused on finding suitable and cheap photocatalysts possessing a good visible-light response, controlled morphology with suitable electronic band structure and high catalytic properties.37,38 Unlike most other semiconductor materials, the visible-light active Bi2O3 is nontoxic in nature and exhibits promising photoactivity for wastewater treatment, water splitting, nitrogen (N2) fixation, and CO2 reduction reaction.39–42 Due to the optical, dielectric, third-order optical non-linear, and ion conductive properties of Bi2O3, it is widely used in optoelectronics devices, gas sensors, lithium-ion batteries (as an anode material), Schottky barrier solar cells (as solid electrolyte material), metal insulator (as a dielectric material), optical coatings, microwave dielectric resonators, semiconductor capacitors, and chemical plants (as a catalyst).28,43–50 Due to the symmetry of its unit cell, Bi2O3 exists in more than one crystal form, i.e., monoclinic (α), tetragonal (β), body-centered cubic (γ), face-centered cubic (δ), orthorhombic (ε), triclinic (ω), and hexagonal assembly.43,51–53 Among them, only α and γ phases are semiconductors, while the β and δ forms are oxide ionic conductor states and reported to be promising photoactive materials.54,55 Furthermore, the α and δ phases are thermodynamically stable,56 while β, γ, and ω-Bi2O3 are metastable phases.57,58 Each Bi2O3 polymorph possesses a distinct electronic band configuration and a wide bandgap energy range (Eg, 2.1–3.66 eV).59 It is important to note that the molecular packing of a material defines its functional properties, and therefore, the polymorphism in Bi2O3 is often considered a drawback. For instance: (i) the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3 is difficult to achieve at room temperature and sophisticated equipment is generally required, (ii) the phase transformation in Bi2O3 is difficult to control and limits its practical applications,60 (iii) the metastable Bi2O3 phase can transform into α-Bi2O3 and bismuth subcarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) in CO2-containing solution, and (iv) the low-temperature synthesis of Bi2O3 results in a poor crystalline phase. However, its crystallinity can be improved by post-annealing at a higher temperature, which leads to a phase transformation in Bi2O3. Conversely, Bi2O3 possesses several advantages in photocatalytic reactions. For instance, it is cheap, abundantly available in earth crust and inert towards neutral water. Besides, its deep valence band, good oxygen-ion conductivity, chemical and biological inertness, stability to light corrosion, and good solar-light absorption make Bi2O3 a promising photocatalyst for environmental and energy applications.61
The photocatalytic efficiency of the Bi2O3 phase does not depend on a single parameter, and thus many strategies can be employed to boost its overall efficiency, such as composition, shape, surface structure, morphology, microstructure, and interface-engineering (Fig. 1). Since the polymorphism in Bi2O3 is highly dependent on its synthesis temperature, where phase transformation with a significant change in morphology occurs over a wide temperature range. Therefore, the response of these strategies in improving photocatalytic activity is not the same for all its phases. The improvement in all parameters is not possible all the time, and most of the studies focused on specific strategies to enhance the photoactivity of selective Bi2O3 phase. In addition, there is a significant inconsistency in the existing literature. For instance, the metastable β-Bi2O3 phase is generally considered to be obtained at a high temperature of about 270 °C. However, the existence of the metastable β-Bi2O3 phase at 40 °C,62 500 °C,63 and 1000 °C64 has also been reported. Also, the phase transformation of β-Bi2O3 to α-Bi2O3 was reported at 450 °C65 and 600 °C.66 Therefore, a deep and critical evaluation of the Bi2O3 phase synthesis and the consequent change in its structure, morphology, and photocatalytic properties are highly required.
 Fig. 1  Various strategies used to boost the photocatalytic efficiency of the Bi2O3 phase. 
It is important to note that the photocatalytic performance of similar Bi2O3 phases cannot be compared directly due to the differences in the reported experimental conditions, e.g., irradiation intensity, irradiation wavelength, choice of light source (UV, visible, simulated and direct sunlight), the concentration of pollutants, amount of photocatalyst used and pH of the photocatalytic system. Previously, some reviews on Bi-based photocatalysts covering diverse topics, including hierarchical microstructures, Bi-rich strategies, doping modifications, and facet engineering were published for environmental and energy applications.38,59,67–70 Unfortunately, the synthetic techniques, morphological enhancement, and photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3 polymorphs were not summarized, even though they are of great interest. As the photocatalytic performance and physicochemical properties of the Bi2O3 phase are greatly dependent on its morphology and synthesis techniques. Therefore, an extensive review is urgent with emphasis on performance enhancement strategies. Herein, we initially discuss the effect of the synthetic method on the crystal phases of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Bi2O3. Then, the morphology modification and structure–activity relationship of various Bi2O3 polymorphs are presented. Subsequently, the development of a phase junction and the interface effect on the photocatalytic performance of a Bi2O3 phase mixture are provided. The stability of the Bi2O3 phases and their temperature-dependent phase transformation are also discussed.
2. Polymorphism in Bi2O3 photocatalysts
The chemical and physical properties of Bi2O3 are highly dependent on its phase structures. Therefore, crystal phase engineering can be employed to tune the photocatalytic activity of bare Bi2O3 by altering the steering charge separation and transfer, light absorption range, and maneuvering its surface reactions.71,72 Therefore, the impact of polymorphism on the kinetic and thermodynamic factors, electronic configuration, and crystal structure of Bi2O3 are discussed in this section.
2.1 Phase development in Bi2O3
Bi2O3 exhibits high photocatalytic activity due to its unique polyhedron or Bi–O layered crystal structure, which induces more active points and presents a higher surface area for photocatalytic activity.73 It is well known that polymorphism can be exploited to tune the photocatalytic performance of photoactive materials.60 Therefore, the crystallization stages for the synthesis of the Bi2O3 phase need to be addressed first to understand its phase-dependent photoactivity. It is important to note that the kinetics of a polymorphic system favors the formation of a metastable phase, while thermodynamics controls the development of a stable phase. The interaction between thermodynamics and kinetics is summarized by Ostwald's Rule of Stages, which states that the complex crystallization process starts with the formation of the least stable form and ends with the most stable phase. Therefore, the growth and nucleation of the metastable phase (β and γ-Bi2O3, in this case) stand out in the initial stage of the chemical reaction. The primary nucleation dispersed with polymorphic transformation often involves dissolution and growth processes from a metastable form to a more stable phase. This results in the nucleation of the stable form, and the dissolution of the metastable form eventually gives rise to the subsequent growth of the stable form, and this effect continues until the stable form is soluble. However, if the stabilizing time of the metastable state in the solution is sufficiently high, one can obtain the metastable phase in the powder form and keep it stable under ambient conditions.62 Conversely, if the stabilizing time of the metastable phase is insufficient, it will give rise to the formation of a stable phase. Therefore, the selective formation of Bi2O3 phases can be achieved by controlling the kinetics and thermodynamics of the system. In addition, the photoactivity of the Bi2O3 phase can be improved by improving the kinetic and thermodynamic factors. The kinetic factors include an improvement in the surface reaction kinetics, charge carrier kinetics, and diffusion kinetics. Simultaneously, the surface reaction kinetics and charge carrier separation dynamics are the most vital kinetic factors, often leading to a low quantum efficiency of heterogeneous photocatalysis.74 However, the kinetic factors are considered more challenging and critical than thermodynamics factors in determining the efficiency of a photocatalyst.
2.2 Electronic configuration of Bi2O3
It has been observed that same polymorph often behaves differently under UV- or visible-light irradiation owing to the difference in band structure. The standard solar light spectrum is composed of infrared-, visible- and UV-light.35 The energy of photons comprising light (infrared-, visible- and UV-light) depends on the frequency of light, i.e., the higher the frequency of light, the greater the energy of photons. Therefore, photon energy in the solar spectrum follows the order of UV-light > vis-light > infrared light. As discussed above, visible-light and UV-light account for 45% and ≤ 5% of the solar spectrum. However, the UV-light-active Bi2O3 polymorph cannot utilize the maximum part of sunlight, and thus has limited photocatalytic applications. On the contrary, by expanding the Bi2O3 response range to a longer wavelength (visible-light), its photocatalytic performance can be improved.75 In addition, a semiconductor is composed of a VB and CB, and the difference between them is called the bandgap energy. In the case of a smaller bandgap energy, the charged species can be transported between these bands by the supply of external energy. Specifically, if external energy (energy of photons in this case) is provided to the electrons (e−) at the VB, they jump to the CB and leave holes (h+) at the VB. However, if the photon or provided energy is not enough, these electrons rapidly fall to the VB and combine with the holes, resulting in the formation of electron–hole pairs. This recombination of electron–hole pairs suppresses the charge transfer between the two bands and eventually results in poor photoactivity. Nevertheless, a larger bandgap energy can prohibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs and impede the electronic conductance, resulting in an increase in ionic conductivity.79 In contrast, a narrower bandgap facilitates the generation of more carriers and helps more visible-light active species to transport between the conduction and valence band. According to the literature, the bandgap energy of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Bi2O3 is reported to be ∼2.8 eV,61 ∼2.5 eV,76 ∼2.8 eV,77 and ∼2.7 eV,78 respectively. Among them, the lowest bandgap energy of β-Bi2O3 results in enhanced photocatalytic activity due to the greater charge carrier generation. Fig. 2 shows the energy level diagram of various Bi2O3 polymorphs obtained through different synthetic techniques. The presented smaller (1.81 eV) bandgap energy of γ-Bi2O3 was obtained from theoretical calculations, namely first principles calculations or density functional theory (DFT) method. This can be explained by the underestimation or limitation due to self-interaction error and discontinuity in the exchange–correlation potential.80

As stated above, the difference in the bandgap energies among the various Bi2O3 polymorphs plays a substantial role in the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3. Thus, the question arises, how can polymorphs of the same compound possess different bandgap energies? The change in bandgap energy during phase transformation can be understood by the phenomena of nucleation and crystal growth. As nucleation and growth of crystals proceed in a particular geometry, they induce a change in the electronic structure of Bi2O3, eventually resulting in distinct bandgap energies. Nevertheless, the specific growth of crystals depends on the synthetic procedure and some other external factors, such as synthesis temperature, use of surfactants, pH of the solution, and incorporation of cations in the Bi2O3 lattice.78 Therefore, an appropriate synthetic approach is highly important for developing highly photoactive Bi2O3 phases.
The effect of the bandgap energy on the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 can be explained by its orbital energy levels. In all the Bi2O3 phases, the CB is comprised of Bi 6p levels, while the VB is comprised of Bi 6s and O 2p hybrid orbitals. The distortion of the lone pair Bi 6s orbital causes the obvious overlap of Bi 6s on the O 2p orbital, which induces an increase in charge mobility and decrease in the bandgap energy.38,81 The lone pair of 6s2 electrons in Bi2O3 exerts strong repulsion to other bonds. The O 2p hybridizations and Bi 6s electronic orbitals are located at a lower energy position in the VB of Bi-semiconductor. This effect induces excessive distortion and polar electric field in the lattices, resulting in enhanced charge separation. Compared with other polymorphs, the narrow bandgap value of β-Bi2O3 is due to the VB shift to higher energy levels. The c-axis-oriented tetragonal structure of β-Bi2O3 exhibits enhanced electron transport, while the Bi 6s lone pair electrons present in the VB help improve the electron mobility under irradiation. Besides, the lone pair provides a channel for photoexcited transportation of electrons and restricts the recombination of electron–hole pairs.82
Traditionally, Bi2O3 is a p-type semiconductor photocatalyst under ambient conditions, and thereby, possesses excellent ability to conduct electrons during photocatalysis.35 Due to its low CB potential of +0.32 V vs. NHE,83,84 pristine Bi2O3 is considered to have poor photoactivity and found to be not useful as expected. Its low CB cannot result in a one-electron transfer reaction by reducing (oxygen) O2 to ˙O2− owing to the lower redox potentials of O2/˙O2− (E°(O2/˙O2−) = −0.33 V vs. NHE), and thus exhibits a high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Conversely, Bi2O3 is considered more attractive due to its deep or low VB potential of +3.1 V vs. NHE,84,85 which is highly favorable in photocatalytic reactions to generate holes (h+) with strong oxidation power. Holes having strong oxidation power are not only beneficial for the degradation of surface-adsorbed organic pollutants, but also help to oxidize water and/or surface hydroxyl groups (–OH) into hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). Therefore, the CB and VB edge position plays a decisive role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3.
2.3 Crystal structure
Each Bi2O3 phase possesses a distinct crystal structure, which depends entirely on the shape and type of atoms and molecules that make up the Bi2O3 crystals. Fig. 3 presents the unit cell structure of the α-, β-, γ- and δ-Bi2O3 phases. As shown in Fig. 3a, the crystal structure of monoclinic the α-Bi2O3 unit cell consists of bismuth ion layers parallel to the {100} plane of the unit cell and separated by oxygen ion layers.90,91 This assembly gives rise to ordered defects and fluorite-like crystal structure having one-quarter of vacant oxygen sites in α-Bi2O3.55 Moreover, it possesses a trigonal bipyramidal distorted structure, where the axial positions are occupied by two larger Bi–O bonds and two shorter Bi–O bonds and share equatorial positions with lone pairs of electrons. Fig. 3b presents the tetragonal unit cell structure of β-Bi2O3 and demonstrates its pseudo trigonal bipyramidal coordination.92,93 Similar to α-Bi2O3, the axial position is occupied by two longer Bi–O bonds and the electron lone pairs are located in the equatorial position by two shorter Bi–O bonds. Azhar et al. reported a first principles approach using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) to calculate the structural and electronic properties of photoactive α- and β-Bi2O3. They found that the unit cell of both phases is composed of eight bismuth (Bi) atoms and twelve oxygen (O) atoms.92 The atomic configuration in the VB consists of 5d10 6s2 and 6p3 orbitals for Bi and 2s2 2p4 orbitals for O atoms. Furthermore, the α phase was suggested to possess a larger cell volume than that of β-Bi2O3. Fig. 3c reveals the body-centered cubic or γ-phase of Bi2O3. The unit cell was found to be relatively larger, and the presence of BiO3 groups induced the cubic symmetry in the crystal.55,94 δ-Bi2O3 possessed a face-centered cubic anion deficient fluorite-like structure and exhibited 75% oxide ion sites occupied in a statistical manner (Fig. 3d).55,95,96 The random distribution of vacancies and oxygen ion conduction results in high conductivity, which is a significant factor in the photoactivity of δ-Bi2O3. Nevertheless, the high conductivity induces effective migration and mobility of photogenerated charges to the surface of the semiconductor material. This is highly favorable in advance oxidation processes. However, the higher electron–hole pair recombination rate and unstable character of δ-Bi2O3 restrict its use as a promising photocatalyst more than expected. Thus, the significant difference in the unit cell structure of various polymorphs defines the photocatalytic performance of each Bi2O3 phase.

3. Techniques in controlled synthesis of Bi2O3 polymorphs for photocatalytic applications
Recent studies showed that researchers have paid much attention to the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3 polymorphs. Numerous techniques have been reported to control the kinetics and thermodynamics of the system to obtain highly active Bi2O3 polymorphs. Unlike the stable α-Bi2O3 phase, the metastable or thermodynamically unstable β- and γ-Bi2O3 attracted much more attention due to their promising photocatalytic performance. It is generally believed that the polymorphism in Bi2O3 is highly dependent on the synthesis temperature. Table 1 presents a summary of the temperature-dependent synthesis of various Bi2O3 polymorphs for photocatalytic applications. The thermal treatment over a wide temperature range suggests that phase-selective synthesis can be achieved over a wide temperature range.

The mutual transformation temperature among the various Bi2O3 polymorphs presented in Fig. 4 reveals that the phase-selective transformation in Bi2O3 can be achieved in the temperature range of 368 °C to 730 °C. However, a temperature above 730 °C gives rise to the formation of the δ phase, and stable δ-Bi2O3 can exist between 730 °C to 823 °C.55,68,92 Although the temperature control in Bi2O3 polymorphism is a critical and complicated process, there are other parameters that affect the stability of the Bi2O3 phase and define the selective phase transformation in Bi2O3, such as heating and cooling conditions, reaction time, use of surfactants or additives, solution pH, and synthetic method. Among them, the heating of the precursors and the cooling of the products are the critical steps that vigorously promote the selective phase transformation in Bi2O3. There are several reports on the heat-induced synthesis of Bi2O3 phases. However, the phase transformation during cooling of the products has rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, in this section, the sophisticated and extensive scope of heating- and cooling-induced phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3 is reviewed. Furthermore, the effect of various synthetic techniques on the crystallinity, morphology, and photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3 is discussed in detail. In support of the points raised above and the traditional approaches considered in the stability or selective phase transformation of Bi2O3, one can conclude that: (i) the α-Bi2O3 is stable at low or room temperature, (ii) β-Bi2O3 is thermodynamically stable at 450–667 °C,97 (iii) β- and γ-Bi2O3 are high-temperature metastable in nature and transformed to monoclinic α phase when the temperature is reduced;98 however, an increase in temperature gives rise to the formation of δ-Bi2O3, (iv) δ-Bi2O3 is stable at high temperature in the range of 730–823 °C68,78,92 or can be stabilized at room temperature conditions by substituting suitable cations in the Bi2O3 lattice, i.e., co-doping of Te4+ and V5+,99 and (v) cooling of the high-temperature δ-Bi2O3 phase results in a transformation to the β phase at 350 °C (650 °C in some reports) and γ phase at 639 °C or ω-Bi2O3.52,92 All these suggest that controlled synthesis conditions and precise equipment are required for the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3. In this section, we discuss the recent techniques and approaches for the synthesis of various Bi2O3 polymorphs for photocatalytic applications.

3.1 Low-temperature chemical precipitation route
The low-temperature synthesis of promising Bi2O3 polymorphs for photocatalytic applications has been a hot topic among researchers for a long time and is highly explored due to the independence of expensive equipment for industrial-scale Bi2O3 preparation. The literature revealed many reports on the direct synthesis of highly photoactive α- and δ-Bi2O3 using simple chemical precipitation, solid-state grinding, sol–gel, and titration method under low or mild temperature conditions. On the contrary, only a few studies have been reported on the phase pure synthesis of β and γ-Bi2O3 under low-temperature conditions, given that metastable phases are difficult to obtain and often require further annealing in a special apparatus.144 In addition, the low-temperature synthesis often has some drawbacks. For instance, the solid-state chemical reaction for the preparation of Bi2O3 by grinding precursors is not environmentally friendly due to the risk of the release of nanoparticles in the environment.145 Moreover, the particle size distribution in the solid-state grinding method is not as small compared to that from the wet processes.38 Conversely, the high-temperature calcination of the Bi2O3 phase results in an increase in particle size. The crystallite size of a photocatalyst plays a crucial role in its photocatalytic performance. For instance, S. Iyyapushpam et al. prepared α-Bi2O3 from bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) precursor via the precipitation method in weak nitric acid (HNO3) solution, which exhibited 76% MO degradation efficiency in 2 h.131 However, annealing at 200 °C and 600 °C resulted in an increase in crystallite size with a decrease in photoactivity to 52% and 24%, respectively.
It is generally observed that the pure α-Bi2O3 nanocrystalline phase was favorably obtained at the solution pH of 8–13. The pH of the solution not only facilitates preferential crystal growth, but also improves the morphological structure of Bi2O3. Wu et al. prepared thermodynamically controlled polyhedral- and plate-like α-Bi2O3 crystals for the degradation of MB by titrating Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution against NaOH.146 The result revealed that the NO3− groups induced crystal growth in the {001} direction, and an increase in NaOH concentration tended to suppress the crystal growth along the {001} direction due to the shielding effect, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, a high [NaOH]/[Bi] ratio over a critical pH range induced the formation of Bi(OH)3 as a second phase impurity. Later, Yang et al. reported the preparation of α-Bi2O3 nanocrystals for the degradation of RhB dye under visible-light irradiation.147 They used dimethylformamide (DMF) and water as the solvent to dissolve the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor and KOH solution served as a base in the precipitation method. Unlike Wu et al.,146 they revealed that a significantly high [KOH]/[Bi] ratio is required to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3. They further suggested that the addition rate of KOH and the DMF/H2O ratio help to tune the hierarchical architecture of α-Bi2O3. Sharma et al. reported the preparation of α-Bi2O3via the chemical precipitation route for the production of H2 and degradation of MB. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in aqueous HNO3 solution, and NaOH was used to maintain the solution pH at 13 followed by heating at 80 °C.134 The obtained α-Bi2O3 exhibited poor photoactivity for water splitting and MB dye degradation due to its increased bandgap energy (2.86 eV). Luévano-Hipólito reported a room temperature precipitation method to prepare α-Bi2O3 by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in HNO3 solution without using additives or surfactants. The reaction pH was maintained at neutral by adding NaOH, and the photocatalytic performance was explored for the degradation of MB.148 In addition to NaOH and KOH, the use of ethylenediamine as a strong base was also explored. Ethylenediamine not only provides a morphological template but helps in the nucleation process and facilitates one-directional preferential crystal growth in α-Bi2O3. Furthermore, it helps stabilize the α-Bi2O3 particles due to its low dielectric constant and quick reaction rate. For example, Hernández-Gordillo et al. prepared α-Bi2O3 microrods for the degradation of IC via the chemical precipitation method.61 Ethylenediamine was used as the precipitating agent instead of NaOH and the effect of various ethylenediamine concentrations on the photoactivity of Bi2O3 was explored. Compared to NaOH, a smaller crystallite size was observed and the crystallite size kept on decreasing with a further increase in ethylenediamine concentration, which enhanced the photoactivity in α-Bi2O3. Later, they reported the use of an ethylenediamine/NaOH solvent mixture in the preparation of α-Bi2O3 microrods for the degradation of IC under UV-light irradiation using the precipitation method.135 They used Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor under an ethylenediamine reflux environment at 50 °C to synthesize α-Bi2O3 with and without using HNO3. The result suggested that in the case of ethylenediamine, a high HNO3 concentration suppressed the crystallization to a low crystalline structure, and eventually resulted in an XRD-amorphous compound. However, a smaller crystal size was obtained using NaOH solution, suggesting that a high concentration OH− ions was required for complete crystallization of the phase-pure α-Bi2O3. Nevertheless, the annealing of amorphous solids to 600 °C resulted in highly crystalline α-Bi2O3.
To regulate the single-crystal growth, the use of a surfactant, i.e., polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), PEG 400, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in various Bi2O3 synthetic processes has received much attention.61,149 The surfactant endows the photocatalyst with the characteristics of an ordered structure with a highly active exposed lattice surface due to the decrease in surface tension between two phases of matter,150 which is important in the synthesis of photocatalyst materials. For instance, X. Guo et al. prepared α-Bi2O3 nanorods via a liquid-phase chemical reaction in the presence of surfactant using bismuth chloride precursor in aqueous-alcoholic solution and PEG 8000 surfactant at 80 °C.140 The as-obtained α-Bi2O3 suggests highly crystalline structure with moderate photoactivity RhB degradation. However, the use of surfactant is energy consuming and environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, instead of surfactant, our research group reported the preparation of α-Bi2O3via a template-free aqueous room temperature method.151 Halogen ions (i.e., Cl− and Br−) from inorganic salts (i.e., NaCl, NaBr, KCl, KBr, NH4Br, and NH4Cl) were added to an aqueous bismuth citrate/KOH solution and α-Bi2O3 was obtained after 24 h of mixing. The as-prepared α-Bi2O3 exhibited enhanced photoactivity for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation due to its highly crystalline structure and columnar morphology. Similarly, the surfactant-induced fabrication of β-Bi2O3 crystals via an aqueous crystallization technique at 40 °C was reported.62 Y. Lu et al. prepared β-Bi2O3 microcrystals by dissolving the Bi(NO3)3 precursor in aqueous HNO3 solution and CTAB surfactant. NaOH was added to the solution mixture, which assisted in tuning the β-Bi2O3 crystal size without further annealing. The obtained β-Bi2O3 exhibited promising photoactivity for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation. In addition, the condition of an interface between the liquid medium and crystal core determines the phase transformation and crystal growth of the Bi2O3 polymorph due to its influence on the free energy of its crystal face. Various experimental conditions can affect the phase transformation in Bi2O3, such as the use of different surfactants, addition rate of surfactant and reactant, and feeding order of reactants. For instance, J. Zhang studied the role of different surfactants in the preparation of Bi2O3 polymorphs.152 Various surfactants were added to the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and NaOH precursor solution under similar and mild conditions to obtain α- and γ-Bi2O3, while the effect of surfactant addition rate was investigated. T. Hashimoto et al. revealed that the presence of a suitable additive, i.e., urea could help the selective phase transformation of α-Bi2O3 to a mixture of β- and γ-Bi2O3.75 They used the sol–gel method and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor for the preparation of α-Bi2O3 in the absence of urea. In contrast, after adding urea, a greater shift towards the β phase was observed and a mixture of β- and γ-Bi2O3 was obtained after calcining at 400 °C. The as-obtained mixture exhibited higher photoactivity for water splitting under visible-light irradiation. Conversely, the addition of surfactant often results in residual substances on the crystal surface, which hinder the charge transfer and affect the photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3.150 Nevertheless, the surfactant-induced low-temperature synthesis requires a post-treatment process and calcination at a higher temperature to get rid of these impurities, but more detailed studies are necessary on this.
The synthesis temperature plays the most crucial role in the transformation and synthesis of phase-pure Bi2O3. Due to the phase transformation in Bi2O3 at a broad temperature range, researchers have paid much attention to its low-temperature synthesis. For example, G. Liu et al. studied the phase transformation of α-Bi2O3 to γ-Bi2O3via a solution crystallization method at a mild temperature of 75 °C and observed that an appropriate reaction time is of high importance in selective phase synthesis process.100 Under low-temperature Bi2O3 synthesis, by increasing the reaction time to 4 h, the monoclinic α-Bi2O3 starts transforming to γ-Bi2O3 (Fig. 5a and b). Phase-pure γ-Bi2O3 was obtained between 5–8 h, whereas, with a further increase in the reaction time to 24 h, the γ phase transformed back into α-Bi2O3 at similar temperature. They proposed that the phase transformation between the γ to α phase is due to the absence of a stabilizing agent. Moreover, annealing of γ-Bi2O3 powders obtained at 75 °C to 300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C for 1 h did not induce phase transformation and structural change in γ-Bi2O3. In contrast, the metastable γ-Bi2O3 phase transformation to the α phase upon cooling was suggested in the temperature range of 368–639 °C,68 revealing that more studies are required to explore the phase transformation of metastable γ-Bi2O3 upon cooling of the products. Similarly, δ-Bi2O3 is a high-temperature stable phase in nature, and usually, its phase transformation occurs when synthesized under low-temperature conditions. However, the addition of a suitable stabilizing agent helps the formation of stabilized δ-Bi2O3 under mild conditions. For instance, H. Cheng et al. reported the low-temperature stabilization of δ-Bi2O3 by adding V5+ ions to the Bi2O3 lattice.95 NaOH was added to the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and HNO3 mixture precursor under mild conditions of 60 °C and mixed for 6 h via solution-based synthesis to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3. However, by introducing an equal stoichiometric amount of NH4VO3, stable δ-Bi2O3 was formed.

The obtained δ-Bi2O3 exhibited broader XRD peaks owing to its poor crystalline structure. The broad bandgap energy of δ-Bi2O3 (3.01 eV) compared to that of α-Bi2O3 (2.8 eV) resulted in poor photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO and 4-CP under visible-light irradiation. Besides, L. Zhou et al. used VO3− in a template-free solution-based chemical reaction method to stabilize δ-Bi2O3 at 60–80 °C for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation.101 A detailed description of this process and microstructure is presented in the following section (section 4.2). The as-obtained photocatalyst exhibited 6–10 times enhanced photocatalytic performance than that of its counterpart due to the increase in surface area from 33.06 m2 g−1 to 72.87 m2 g−1.
In addition, various stabilizing strategies, i.e., stabilizer to Bi ratio, and use of stabilizer in the absence of surfactant or in the presence doping agent, have been found to be promising approaches for the low-temperature synthesis of the Bi2O3 phase. For example, Y.C. Wu et al. obtained well-crystallized δ-Bi2O3via a room-temperature precipitation route and revealed that a 0.2 and 0.1 molar ratio of V/Bi is necessary to obtain stabilized and well crystalline δ- and γ-Bi2O3, respectively.153 However, a molar ratio of less than 0.1 led to the formation of α-Bi2O3. They further demonstrated that a suitable V/Bi ratio facilitates the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3 and helps to increase the crystallinity of the Bi2O3 phase. The as-obtained δ-Bi2O3 exhibited higher photoactivity for the degradation of RhB under white-light irradiation. H. Sudrajat et al. prepared δ-Bi2O3via a low-temperature sol–gel method for the degradation and mineralization of atrazine under UV-visible-light irradiation (Fig. 5c).78 The results revealed that the addition of metavanadate oxyanion (VO3−) from the NH4VO3 source could help stabilize the δ phase without the addition of a surfactant, emulsion or template. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in NH4VO3 in the presence of HNO3, and NaOH was used to maintain the solution pH at 12. δ-Bi2O3 was obtained by heating the precursor solution to 70 °C for 30 h. Nevertheless, an amorphous product and BiVO4 were obtained in the absence of VO3− ions and slightly basic (pH = 8) conditions, respectively. The obtained Bi2O3 powder exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity owing to its enhanced surface properties. The follow-up study (Fig. 5d and e) revealed that increasing the synthesis temperature to 80 °C helps improve the crystallinity of δ-Bi2O3 and no phase transformation occurs between 50–80 °C.85 Furthermore, the enhanced photoactivity and mineralization efficiency was attributed to the optimum particle size of the product (20.1 nm). In another study, they loaded Cu on Bi2O3 through the impregnation method and revealed that a low concentration of Cu loading did not affect the crystal structure of δ-Bi2O383 (Fig. 5f). δ-Bi2O3 was produced using the above-mentioned procedure at 70 °C, and CuCl2 was used as the Cu source. The Cu-containing δ-Bi2O3 precursor was heated to 90 °C to obtain Cu-doped δ-Bi2O3, which exhibited enhanced mineralization and degradation efficiency against atrazine under visible-light irradiation.
Due to highly stable surface and enhanced surface area, the low-temperature sol–gel process shows potential in the synthesis of highly active Bi2O3 phases, which involves several synthetic steps, i.e., hydrolysis and polycondensation, gelation, aging, drying, densification, and crystallization.154,155 Waseem Raza et al. reported the preparation of α-Bi2O3 through the sol–gel method by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor and Triton-X surfactant in nitric acid solution.142 The obtained solution was added dropwise to an NaOH solution and heated to 90 °C for 3 h to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3. Moreover, the visible-light response of α-Bi2O3 was further improved by adding it to various concentrations of ammonium ceric nitrate or neodymium nitrate in NaOH solution. The 2.0% Ce or 1.5% Nd-doped α-Bi2O3 exhibited a strong photocatalytic response for the degradation of AG-25, AY-29 and CBB G-250 pollutants, and no change in their phase structure was observed.
3.2 Hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis route
Hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis is a powerful tool used to produce various functional materials via heterogeneous reactions in solution under high temperature and pressure conditions. The synergy of high temperature and pressure provides a one-step process for preparing highly crystalline materials without the need for annealing.156 However, the low production rate, prolonged reaction time, batch character of hydrothermal synthesis, and the risk of leakage of hazardous solvents from the autoclave limit its practical use for large-scale industrial applications. There are several reports on the production of Bi2O3via the hydrothermal/solvothermal technique. Usually, during the hydrothermal synthetic process, the Bi-based precursor (e.g., Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) is diluted in aqueous acidic solution (i.e., HNO3), followed by the addition of additives (e.g., NH4HCO3, L-lysine-oxalic, Na2CO3 and citric acid) or surfactant (e.g., PEG). The pH of the solution is maintained by a strong base (e.g., NaOH), resulting in the formation of Bi(OH)3 or Bi2O2CO3 intermediates. The obtained intermediate solution is then hydrothermally treated at 100 °C – 200 °C for a suitable time to obtain the phase-pure Bi2O3 polymorph. It is important to note that the addition of a high concentration of NO3− ions during the hydrothermal treatment results in the one-dimensional crystal growth of Bi2O3.61 In contrast, the presence of a high concentration of OH− ions controls preferential crystal growth given that they are linked on the polar faces and act as a capping agent.61 In the case of solvothermal synthesis, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O is diluted in an organic solvent or mixture (i.e., DMF, ethylene glycol or methoxy ethanol, oleic acid, rambutan extract, glycerin, HMA, ethylenediamine acetic acid–ethanol–DMF, glycerol–ethanol, and acetic acid ethanol mixture) in the absence of HNO3 or NaOH to obtain an intermediate such as (BiO)4(OH)2CO3.65,157 The organic solvent acts as a morphological template and the intermediate is then dehydrated to get Bi2O2CO3 followed by calcination to obtain phase-pure Bi2O3.
Compared to the sol–gel or ultrasonic-assisted precipitation method, Bi2O3 prepared in the presence of additive or surfactant via hydrothermal treatment exhibits a high photocatalytic performance. For example, M. Jalalah et al. reported the synthesis of α-Bi2O3via a sol–gel and hydrothermal treatment method. The product obtained via the sol–gel treatment of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor at 80 °C using PEG as a surfactant was initially calcined for 2 h at 250 °C, and finally for 1 h at 600 °C. However, in the hydrothermal treatment method, the solution of Bi(NO3)3 precursor and HNO3 at 10 pH was treated for 24 h at 180 °C.64 Urea was used as an additive in the hydrothermal process. The α-Bi2O3 obtained through the hydrothermal process exhibited higher visible-light photoactivity for the degradation of MB than α-Bi2O3 obtained through the sol–gel process. Similarly, X. Guo et al. prepared microlisianthus-like δ-Bi2O3via the hydrothermal treatment of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in the presence of PEG 2000 surfactant at 150 °C for 24 h.140 The XRD pattern shown in Fig. 6A revealed broad diffraction peaks suggests its moderate crystallinity. Nevertheless, the obtained δ-Bi2O3 showed a better UV-Vis light response for the degradation of RhB compared to the highly crystalline α-Bi2O3 obtained through an ultrasonic-assisted precipitation method in the presence of PEG 8000 surfactant at 80 °C.

The modification of the surface, morphology, and energy band levels of Bi2O3 shows potential to enhance its photocatalytic activity. Surface modification involves improving surface properties such as charge or polarity, which can be achieved by adding ions, metals, polymers, and other semiconductor materials.67 The addition of conductive materials acts as electron acceptors, which promotes the photo-generated migration of electrons and facilitates greater charge carrier separation. Hu et al. prepared highly crystalline rod-like α-Bi2O3 using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and NaOH via hydrothermal treatment at 120 °C for 6 h (Fig. 6B).132 The as-obtained α-Bi2O3 exhibited poor visible-light activity for the decomposition of IPA. However, modification of the α-Bi2O3 surface via the impregnation of Cu(II) clusters resulted in improved photocatalytic properties in α-Bi2O3. No change in crystal structure was observed, and the enhanced properties were attributed to its high charge separation efficiency. Similarly, Sudrajat et al. prepared stable δ-Bi2O3 through the hydrothermal treatment of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in the presence of aqueous glycine solution at 200 °C (Fig. 6C).141 The δ-Bi2O3 obtained after 24 h possessed a highly crystalline structure but poor mineralization activity against atrazine, p-nitrophenol, paracetamol and ibuprofen under UV-light irradiation. The doping of Fe3+ by adding Fe(NO3)3 at a molar ratio of Fe to Bi of 0.05 under similar conditions followed by calcining in air at 500 °C resulted in enhanced photoactivity in δ-Bi2O3 without any phase transformation. Similarly, D. He et al. prepared highly crystalline α-Bi2O3 by mixing an aqueous Bi(NO3)3 solution with NH3·H2O and NaOH solution and hydrothermally treating the mixture at 120 °C for 10 h. Despite having a highly crystalline structure, the obtained α-Bi2O3 exhibited a poor photo-response under visible-light irradiation.103 The photoactivity was further improved by loading 20% FeOOH over Bi2O3 at 65 °C through the liquid-phase chemical reaction method. The obtained FeOOH-loaded Bi2O3 exhibited strong photodegradation capability for the degradation of MO and phenol under visible-light irradiation. In addition, M. Faisal et al. prepared pure α-Bi2O3via the hydrothermal treatment of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and NH4OH solution at pH 8–10.102 The reaction was carried out for 6 h at 130 °C to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3. The crystallinity of the obtained Bi2O3 was improved by adding SrCl3·6H2O and the product with a 7.5% doping percentage exhibit remarkable photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB under visible-light irradiation. The higher photoactivity of Sr-doped α-Bi2O3 was attributed to its highly crystalline structure and good charge carrier transport properties.
The hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment for the synthesis of Bi2O3 sometimes results in moderate or poorly crystalline intermediate products and requires further annealing at high temperature (270–730 °C) to obtain phase-pure Bi2O3.65 Moreover, high temperature calcination favors the phase transformation in Bi2O3. Therefore, careful selection of the synthesis conditions is required to obtain a particular Bi2O3 phase. For instance, X. Xiao et al. reported the preparation of β-Bi2O3 by firstly preparing rhombohedral monodisperse Bi nanospheres (JCPDS # 85-1329) via the solvothermal reaction of D-fructose and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in the presence of EG at 160 °C for 15 h (Fig. 6D).104 The phase-pure β-Bi2O3 was then obtained by calcining the obtained products in an air atmosphere at 300 °C, which exhibited strong photoabsorption under UV- and visible-light irradiation for the degradation of acetaminophen pollutant. J. Wang et al. reported the preparation of α- and β-Bi2O3 by firstly preparing a poorly crystalline precursor through the hydrothermal treatment process.158 They mixed Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in acetic acid solution followed by the addition of ethanol and DMF. The obtained solution was hydrothermally heated to 100 °C for 40 min to obtain the precursor. The as-obtained precursor powder was further calcined at 350 °C and 420 °C to obtain highly crystalline β- and α-Bi2O3 phases, respectively. β-Bi2O3 exhibited strong degradation efficiency against RhB dye under visible-light irradiation. Y. Yan et al. reported the fabrication of the α and β phases of Bi2O3 by mixing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O with glycerol and ethanol followed by hydrothermal treatment at 160 °C for 3 h.105 The obtained intermediate product was characterized as amorphous. The calcination of the intermediate at 270 °C and 350 °C for 2 h resulted in highly crystalline phase-pure β and α-Bi2O3, respectively. The obtained β-Bi2O3 (Eg = 2.36 eV) exhibited better photoactivity than α-Bi2O3 (Eg = 2.83 eV) for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation owing to its low band energy. In contrast, the synthesis of highly crystalline α-Bi2O3 was also reported via low-temperature hydrothermal treatment without further calcination. For example, Wu et al. prepared monoclinic phase-pure α-Bi2O3 nanowires via hydrothermal treatment.136 NaOH solution was added dropwise to a solution of Bi2O(OH)SO4, which was obtained by mixing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Na2SO4. The mixed solution was hydrothermally heated at 120 °C for 12 h to get highly crystalline phase-pure α-Bi2O3 with 60% RhB degradation efficiency.
3.3 Sonochemical route
The sonochemical synthesis of functional materials is a green and environmentally friendly technique that helps change the rotation and vibration of molecular states through the acoustic cavitation phenomenon.159 The continuous collapse and formation of microbubbles result in the development of extreme pressure (>10000 atm), temperature (5000 K–8000 K), and rapid cooling (109 K s−1) on the nanosecond scale. More importantly, it is generally considered that the sonochemical reactions are independent of acid, base, and dipole moment.159 There are few reported works on the preparation of phase-pure α-Bi2O3 using the sonochemical technique. Zhang et al. reported the surfactant-induced synthesis of visible-light-active grain-like α-Bi2O3 for the degradation of MO through the sonochemical route.160 They mixed Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and PVP surfactant in the presence of HNO3 and added NaOH dropwise until pH = 11. The resulting solution was then irradiated with 60 W/20 kHz high-intensity ultrasound waves for 75 min, which resulted in an increase in temperature to 60 °C and the formation of highly crystalline α-Bi2O3. It was observed that the formation of Bi2O3 using the sonochemical technique is dependent on the added surfactant and pH of the solution. The as-obtained α-Bi2O3 exhibited enhanced photoactivity under visible-light irradiation. Later, Sood et al. reported the room temperature sonochemical synthesis of highly visible-light-active α-Bi2O3 nanorods.161 NaOH was added to an aqueous solution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O till the pH reached 8, and it was ultrasonically treated for 1 h. The resulting solution was then mixed overnight, followed by calcining at 400 °C for 2 h to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3. The as-obtained α-Bi2O3 exhibited strong photoactivity for the degradation of RhB and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TPA) under simulated light irradiation. However, the effect of sonication on the properties of α-Bi2O3 was not discussed. In addition, the ultrasound-assisted preparation of β-Bi2O3 was also reported for the degradation of RhB dye under UV-light irradiation.122 Kalandaragh et al. prepared a Bi(OH)3 solution by mixing Bi(NO3)3 in water and ultrasonically irradiating for 1 h. The long-time sonication resulted in an increase in temperature to 80 °C. The obtained product was calcined at 300 °C for 1 h and exhibited remarkable photodegradation efficiency for the degradation of RhB. It is important to note that the effect of the sonication time on the structure, morphology and photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 was not discussed in any of the reports in the literature. Moreover, the sonication process gives rise to a substantial increase in the temperature of the precursor solution up to 80 °C. Nevertheless, as discussed in section 3.1, this temperature range can induce the in situ formation of α-Bi2O3 during the sonication process. Therefore, more research is required for the phase-pure synthesis of Bi2O3 for photocatalytic applications.
To have a greater understanding of the low-temperature synthesis of Bi2O3, a comparison between sonochemical synthesis and low-temperature chemical precipitation synthesis is necessary. The low-temperature chemical precipitation method results in a variable particle size and morphology in nanocrystalline materials. In contrast, the ultrasound-assisted precipitation method results in a more controlled morphology than the precipitation method. For example, D. Sánchez-Martínez et al. prepared α-Bi2O3 by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in HNO3 solution.130 The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11, and the effect of the ultrasonic irradiation time on the morphology of α-Bi2O3 was investigated. The as-obtained precipitates were dried and annealed at 500 °C for 4 h to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3. No change in the nanoplate-like morphology except for a change from irregular shape to ovoid shape and finally to a rectangular shape was observed for 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h irradiation time, respectively. Moreover, 2 h longer ultrasonic irradiation time resulted in the partial transformation of Bi2O3 back into bismuth nitrate, eventually resulting in poor photoactivity. M. Bagheri et al. observed the effect of NaOH in the preparation of phase-pure α-Bi2O3 in the presence of an ionic liquid under ultrasonic irradiation. They revealed that a high NaOH concentration helps to obtain a highly crystalline α-Bi2O3 phase, which exhibited remarkable photoactivity for the degradation of MG.162
3.4 Calcining or sintering route
Controlling the formation of a specific Bi2O3 polymorph by retaining the original dimensions of the target material on the nanoscale is a challenging process. This problem arises due to the requirement of long-term processing and high-temperature conditions, which induce structural collapse or agglomeration through an unintentional phase transition. Therefore, to obtain a highly photoactive Bi2O3 polymorph, a method for the stable phase transformation of a bismuth-based precursor that does not induce remarkable collapse in its microstructure is necessary.123 Moreover, the removal of organics from bottom-up materials to produce highly pure and crystalline Bi2O3 polymorphs is a crucial step. Generally, calcining is used to obtain highly crystalline phase-pure Bi2O3via the following approaches (Fig. 7):
• Preparation of bismuth-based precursor, i.e., (BiO)2CO3 by hydrothermal/solvothermal or low-temperature precipitation method and subsequent calcination to obtain a phase-pure Bi2O3 polymorph.
• Synthesis of poorly crystalline or amorphous Bi2O3 using hydrothermal/solvothermal or low temperature method, and then calcination to a certain temperature to obtain a highly crystalline Bi2O3 polymorph.
• Direct calcination of Bi-based precursor to obtain highly crystalline Bi2O3 polymorphs.
• Phase transformation of metastable β- and γ-Bi2O3 to obtain stable Bi2O3 polymorphs.
• To remove organics/impurities from photocatalysts.
 Fig. 7  Various approaches used to obtain highly crystalline phase-pure Bi2O3 through the calcination route. 
It is generally considered that higher crystalline nanomaterials result in better migration of photogenerated charge carriers from the bulk to the surface owing to their fewer lattice defects. The presence of these defects leads to a high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and a decrease in photocatalytic activity.129 Therefore post-calcination treatment is often required to improve the crystallinity of Bi2O3. Moreover, due to the temperature-dependent properties of Bi2O3, most researchers used calcination as a final step for the synthesis of a pure Bi2O3 polymorph. In this section, we discuss the effect of calcination on the photocatalytic properties of various Bi2O3 polymorphs.
Preparing Bi2O3 under low-temperature conditions, i.e., liquid-phase chemical reaction, hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis, often results in amorphous products. The calcination of these products under suitable conditions results in the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3. For instance, Z. Ai et al. reported the synthesis of α-Bi2O3 for the degradation of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) under visible-light irradiation.163 The hydrothermal treatment of the precursor at 160 °C for 12 h results in the formation of (BiO)2CO3. The subsequent calcination of the intermediate product under an air atmosphere at 500 °C for 4 h resulted in the production of highly crystalline α-Bi2O3. Similarly, Huang et al. reported the preparation of UV-light active α-Bi2O3 by firstly preparing the polymer Bi2(Hpdc)2(pdc)2·2H2O (H2pdc = pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) through the hydrothermal treatment method.106 The subsequent calcination of the Bi(III) coordination polymer at 500 °C for 1 h resulted in the formation of phase-pure α-Bi2O3. In addition, the calcination of the intermediate at a relatively low temperature resulted in the formation of a metastable phase. For example, A. Charanpahari et al. reported the preparation of β-Bi2O3 for the degradation of IC and Acid Violet 7 (AV) under UV-visible light irradiation.118 Firstly, they prepared Bi2O2CO3 precipitates by mixing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in HNO3 followed by the addition of Na2CO3 solution to it through a liquid-phase chemical reaction at 70 °C. The obtained Bi2O2CO3 intermediate was then calcined at 380 °C for 15 min, resulting in visible-light active β-Bi2O3 nanoflakes. Similarly, H. Cheng et al. prepared phase-pure β-Bi2O3 from Bi2O2CO3 by annealing at 380 °C for 10 min, where Bi2O2CO3 was firstly obtained by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in HNO3 solution, and an excess quantity of Na2CO3 was added dropwise.95 The photocatalytic activity of the obtained β-Bi2O3 was compared with that of α-Bi2O3 and γ-Bi2O3 prepared through low-temperature (60 °C) liquid-phase chemical reaction. The enhanced photocatalytic of the β phase for the degradation of MO and 4-CP was attributed to its lower bandgap energy. Moreover, S. lyyapushpam et al. reported the preparation of Bi2O2CO3 at room temperature by mixing of Bi(NO3)3 and HNO3 solution with K2CO3 solution instead of Na2CO3. Calcination of the obtained Bi2O2CO3 at 400 °C resulted in the formation of highly visible-light-active β-Bi2O3.120 They further suggested that the conversion of Bi2O2CO3 to β-Bi2O3 increases the crystallite size and eventually reduces the bandgap energy. Similarly, large crystallite size β-Bi2O3 was prepared using Bi2O2CO3 at 400 °C for the mineralization of phenol and 4-chlorophenol under visible-light irradiation.164 The recycling experiments resulted in photocorrosion of β-Bi2O3 into α-Bi2O3, Bi2O2CO3, and (BiO)4CO3(OH)2 during the phenol mineralization process. A similar mineralization efficiency was obtained after three cycles with a rapid decrease in photoactivity after the fourth cycle, and no activity was obtained in the seventh run. This could be explained by the transformation of β-Bi2O3 into bismuth oxycarbonate in CO2-containing solution.165 In another study, they prepared α-Bi2O3 from Bi(OH)3 precipitates obtained at 8 pH, and then calcined it at 500 °C to test its photostability in the sequential mineralization of phenol.166 A poor photomineralization efficiency was recorded in the cycling experiments due to the structural change and formation of bismuth carbonates. Calcination of the obtained deactivated powder at 500 °C did not improve the mineralization efficiency, revealing that the precipitation pH and calcination are both determining factors for the generation of an active particle surface. Later, the effect of annealing time on the crystallite size and surface area of β-Bi2O3 was studied at 370 °C.167 The stability of obtained Bi2O3 was tested via cycling experiments against RhB dye, which exhibited constant photoactivity in first two cycles. However, only 33% photoactivity was obtained after ten cycles. The PXRD results showed the formation of Bi2O3CO3 after five cycles with a significant loss in photoactivity. It was suggested that the recycled powder was composed of 55% β-Bi2O3 and 45% Bi2O3CO3 and the in situ formation of Bi2O3CO3 was due to the release of CO2 during the RhB degradation process.
The dispersant or surfactant plays an essential role in the photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3. The dispersant facilitates the separation of particles in the suspension and acts as a morphology modifier. Cheng et al. reported the preparation of visible-light-active α-Bi2O3via a chemical precipitation method.107 PEG 1000, 4000, and 6000 were used as a dispersant, and the obtained powders were calcined to 400 °C for 2 h. The effect of the dispersant dosage, calcination time, and calcination temperature was explored. Besides, N-doped β-Bi2O3 was selectively prepared by using 2 g PEG 1000 dispersant and calcining at 350 °C for 4 h, which exhibited strong photoabsorption for MG dye. Similarly, B. Lei et al. prepared the α and β phase of Bi2O3 by firstly mixing CTAB surfactant with Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and HNO3 solution.112 NaOH and oxalic acid were added separately in the above-mentioned solution and calcined at 350 °C and 270 °C to obtain phase-pure α and β-Bi2O3, respectively. The obtained β-Bi2O3 exhibited enhanced photoactivity for the removal of NO. On the contrary, the synthesis of visible-light active β-Bi2O3 was reported by M. Jalalah et al. at 1000 °C, which was higher than its melting point (824 °C).63,64 They prepared β-Bi2O3 by firstly preparing a mixture of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and surfactant PEG and adjusting the pH to 9–10 using NH4OH. The obtained solution was hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 24 h and then calcined to 1000 °C for 2 h to get highly crystalline β-Bi2O3. It is important to note that no information about the product after hydrothermal treatment was reported. Theoretically, the metastable β-Bi2O3 phase can be selectively transformed to the α and δ phase at a higher temperature. However, the synthesis of β-Bi2O3 at elevated temperature with no phase transformation suggests that α-Bi2O3 and δ-Bi2O3 can be obtained at a much higher temperature than 1000 °C, which is not consistent with most reports in the literature.
As discussed above, the annealing of Bi-based precursors at higher temperatures initially results in the formation of a metastable phase, and finally a stable phase is obtained. However, the phase transformation does not completely depend on the annealing temperature, and various other factors such as pH and choice of surfactant are also crucial. For example, Divya et al. reported the preparation of α-Bi2O3 needles for the degradation of RhB under UV-Vis light irradiation by a low-temperature co-precipitation method.110 α-Bi2O3 was obtained by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in HNO3 solution, and NaOH was used to maintain the pH of the solution at 12. The obtained solution was heated to 75 °C for 90 min to obtain α-Bi2O3 (Fig. 8a). Further annealing of the as-obtained α-Bi2O3 powder in the range of 200–700 °C gave rise to an increase in particle size (Fig. 8(b–d)), and no phase transformation was observed. However, annealing above 300 °C negatively affected the photoactivity of α-Bi2O3 (Fig. 8e) due to the lack of oxygen vacancies and reduction in exposed surface area. Similarly, H. Oudghiri-Hassani et al. observed that the synthesis temperature does not induce a transformation in α-Bi2O3 at a variety of temperature ranges.109

A bismuth oxalate precursor (Bi(C2O4)OH and Bi2(C2O4)3·xH2O) was obtained by solid-state grinding a 1:3 molar ratio of bismuth nitrate to oxalic acid and heated to 160 °C on a hot plate until a brown-red color was observed. The obtained precursor was calcined in a tubular furnace in the temperature range of 280 °C–500 °C. No change in phase was observed, and the obtained α-Bi2O3 at 500 °C exhibited a poor UV-light response for the degradation of RhB.
It is generally considered that calcination as a purification technique can remove all the hydrocarbon impurities from nanostructured materials by oxidizing them at high temperature. This assumption has led to its application in several research articles in the field of functional materials. Our group reported the synthesis of Bi2O3 polymorphs via the direct calcination of bismuth citrate precursor without initial treatment by hydrothermal or low-temperature liquid-phase chemical reaction. Besides, the calcination environment (air or N2) plays an important role in obtaining phase-pure Bi2O3 polymorphs. For example, phase-pure α-Bi2O3 was obtained by directly calcining bismuth citrate under an air atmosphere at 450 °C.86 However, the calcination in an N2 environment in the range 300–500 °C led to the formation of C/Bi/α-Bi2O3. Pyrophoric phenomena occur while cooling the obtained product when exposed to air, and it was suggested that β-Bi2O3 was transformed to α-Bi2O3 due to its metastable nature. Later, our research group reported the synthesis of β-Bi2O3 by directly calcining bismuth citrate at 350 °C in an air environment. However, the addition of bismuth subacetate and bismuth oxide formate to bismuth citrate via the solid-state chemical grinding method improved the crystallinity and photoactivity of β-Bi2O3.76,89 Nevertheless, unburned carbon was obtained in all the samples, which led to the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi-metal in the case of the addition of bismuth subacetate, revealing that calcining could not remove all the organics during the synthesis of Bi2O3. Conversely, the preparation of δ-Bi2O3 was reported by firstly preparing bismuth acetate using Bi2O3 and acetic acid precursor, and subsequent calcining at 250 °C for 4 h.127 The as-obtained δ-Bi2O3 exhibited remarkable photoactivity under simulated light irradiation for the degradation of RhB. However, the XPS result suggested that calcining induced the formation of amorphous carbon and did not reduce Bi2O3 into Bi metal, which revealed that low-temperature calcination is beneficial for increasing the yield of Bi2O3. In addition, the enhanced photoactivity of β-Bi2O3 in all reports was attributed to the efficient charge separation induced by the presence of unburned carbon. Moreover, the presence of unburned surface carbon helps to stabilize the metastable Bi2O3 phase. For instance, F. Wang et al. prepared highly photoactive and thermodynamically stable β-Bi2O3 nanosheets for NO oxidation reaction125 by calcining thermodynamically stable Bi2O2CO3 at 420 °C. The XPS analysis revealed the presence of unburned carbon, suggesting that the unconverted carbon on the surface of β-Bi2O3 helps to stabilize the metastable β-Bi2O3 phase. Similarly, X. Fang et al. reported the preparation of pure β-Bi2O3 by calcining pure bismuth oxalate precursor at a higher temperature of 600 °C.111 The stability of the as-synthesized β-Bi2O3 was improved via the decomposition of bismuth oxalate on the surface of CeO2 at a similar temperature (600 °C). The presence of carbon on β-Bi2O3/CeO2 revealed that calcining at a temperature up to 600 °C could not decompose all the C on the surface of β-Bi2O3. Mohapatra et al. also reported similar findings in the case of colloidal nanocrystal assemblies.168 Besides, the amount of carbon removed by calcining varies from material to material. The presence of unburned carbon is beneficial for enhanced visible-light absorption by producing hot charge carriers and increasing the electron migration efficiency, thereby resulting in an increase in the photoactivity of Bi2O3.
In addition to high-temperature calcination of the Bi2O3 phase, the use of various metal oxides, surfactants, post-transition ions, templates, and substrate also plays a substantial role in the synthesis and stabilization of phase-selective Bi2O3. For instance, G. Zhou et al. stabilized cubic δ-Bi2O3 by co-doping V5+ and Te4+ in the Bi2O3 lattice followed by annealing the precursor films at 760 °C.99 They revealed that co-doping enhanced the crystallinity of δ-Bi2O3 and improved its photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation. Similarly, G. Ren et al. prepared Bi2O3 polymorphs over a pretreated porous diatomite carrier by hydrothermal treatment followed by calcining at various temperatures of 350 °C, 470 °C, and 520 °C.124 They reported that the diatomite carrier helps to stabilize the β-Bi2O3 phase at a higher temperature of 470 °C. However, the as-prepared β-Bi2O3 phase was transformed into the α phase at a higher annealing temperature of 520 °C. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that β-Bi2O3 cannot be obtained by calcining the amorphous precursor above 420 °C. G. K. Valencia et al. reported the synthesis and transformation of the Bi2O3 polymorph by calcining an amorphous precursor.65 Various molar ratios of HNO3/Bi3+ were employed using the room temperature chemical precipitation method in the presence of ethylenediamine solvent, resulting in the formation of an amorphous product. The obtained product was calcined in an air atmosphere to obtain α-Bi2O3, β-Bi2O3, α/β-Bi2O3, and β/α-Bi2O3 in the temperature range of 350–450 °C. They observed the preparation of stabilized β-Bi2O3 at a higher temperature of 450 °C and suggested that in addition to a high calcination temperature, the synthesis of a pure Bi2O3 phase depends on the concentration of CO32−, NO3− and amine ENH22+ ions. Conversely, the synthesis of β-Bi2O3 at a low calcining temperature of 300 °C by using surfactant was also reported. W. Raza et al. prepared pure α-Bi2O3 by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in an aqueous HNO3 solution followed by the addition of the surfactant Triton X under reflux and room temperature conditions. The as-prepared precursor was then calcined at 300 °C to obtain phase-pure highly crystalline α-Bi2O3. However, the addition of dopants, i.e., Nb and Mn, at 300 °C induced higher photoactivity in α-Bi2O3, and no effect on its crystal structure was observed.57
The polymer-induced fabrication of the Bi2O3 phase at a low (120 °C) or high (680 °C) calcining temperature was also reported. For example, C. Wang et al. reported the preparation of UV-light-active stabilized β-Bi2O3 at a high calcining temperature for the degradation of RhB. Polyacrylonitrile and Bi(NO3)3 precursors were used to obtain the Bi-based precursor through the electrospinning method followed by calcining at 500 °C for 10 h.66 Later, they studied the effect of annealing temperature on the preparation of phase-pure β-Bi2O3. The annealing of the same precursor at a higher temperature of 550 °C and 600 °C revealed the coexistence β- and α-Bi2O3. The analysis revealed the dominant β-Bi2O3 phase with a trace amount of α-Bi2O3 phase, which eventually resulted in poor activity due to the presence of multiple phases.72 Besides, some researchers reported the preparation of Bi2O3 polymorphs by calcining bismuth-based polymers. For instance, X. Chen et al. reported the heat-induced preparation of a polyacrylamide gel precursor followed by calcination at 120 °C to obtain phase-pure β-Bi2O3 polymorph.113 The as-prepared β-Bi2O3 exhibited poor photoactivity for the degradation of MB under visible-light irradiation.
3.5 Other synthetic routes
The microwave-assisted hydrothermal or calcining method for the synthesis of functional nanomaterials is a promising and green technique to obtain semiconductor metal oxides.169,170 It is a rapid volumetric heating process that can attain uniform heating in a short period with high product purity and product yield.170,171 A few reports are available on the production of Bi2O3 polymorphs using microwave-assisted methods. It was reported that a microwave-assisted Bi2O3 polymorph exhibited poor crystallinity and was further annealed to obtain a highly crystalline microstructure. For example, Q. Huang et al. reported the microwave-assisted synthesis of β-Bi2O3.128 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and urea were dissolved in ethylene glycol (EG) and water, respectively, and subsequently mixed with PEG-400 surfactant. The obtained mixture was treated with microwave irradiation at 500 W for 90 min to obtain poorly crystalline β-Bi2O3. The obtained powder was then calcined between 300 °C – 350 °C and an increase in temperature resulted in the phase transformation of β-Bi2O3 into α-Bi2O3. Nevertheless, the β-Bi2O3 obtained through calcining was highly crystalline in nature compared to β-Bi2O3 obtained through the microwave heating method and exhibited strong absorption for RhB pollutant under solar irradiation. Conversely, well crystalline α- and γ-Bi2O3 were obtained via the microwave irradiation of a Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and PVP mixture in EG solution.172 In addition, prolonged heating and competition between nucleation and crystal growth facilitated the phase transformation between α-Bi2O3 and γ-Bi2O3. The crystallite size increased from 10–20 nm for α-Bi2O3 to 30 nm for γ-Bi2O3. The α-Bi2O3 obtained after 10 min of microwave irradiation was transformed into γ-Bi2O3 after 15 min. Nevertheless, beside poor stability, α-Bi2O3 exhibited stronger photoabsorption for various pollutants under UV-light irradiation than that of γ-Bi2O3.
Recently, I. Fujita et al. reported that the high-pressure torsion (HPT) of pure α-Bi2O3 resulted in the formation of oxygen vacancies and a generation of a high photocurrent and enhanced light absorption.173 Besides, the yellow color of α-Bi2O3 changed to black probably due to crystal defects, and a significant improvement in the photoactivity of black Bi2O3 was observed. G. Lin et al. reported the laser-induced synthesis of α-Bi2O3 nanoparticles using femtosecond laser ablation.174 The as-synthesized α-Bi2O3 exhibited a degradation efficiency of about 51% for IC dye in 90 min under UV-light irradiation. P. Hajra et al. reported the preparation of n-type Bi2O3 nanoparticles via the chemical bath reaction method.54 They heated bismuth nitrate precursor in ethylene glycol (EG) and benzyl alcohol (BA) solvent at 180 °C for 2–3 h to obtain Bi2O3 particles. The as-obtained Bi2O3 was further treated using the drop-cast method and annealed for 10 h to get particulate thin films of α- and ω-Bi2O3 at 600 °C. The as-prepared Bi2O3 exhibited good photoactivity against RhB dye under visible-light irradiation. In addition, the biological-assisted synthesis of α-Bi2O3 nanoflakes was reported by Karnan et al., which were used for the degradation of MO.108 An extract of Nephelium lappaceum L. (rambutan fruit) was mixed in an aqueous solution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O at 80 °C for 2 h. The obtained product was dried and calcined at 450 °C under an air atmosphere to get highly crystalline pure α-Bi2O3, which exhibited 94.66% photoactivity during 10 h under natural sunlight. Furthermore, the removal of isoniazid antibiotic by β-Bi2O3 under UV-vis and visible-light irradiation was reported by R. R. S. Coronado-Castañeda et al.117 They used Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor and tartaric acid (chelating agent) to obtain the Bi-based precursor through the Pechini method. The calcination of the obtained precursor at 390 °C for 3 h resulted in the highly crystalline β-Bi2O3, which exhibited strong photoabsorption for isoniazid under UV-Vis irradiation.
4. Morphology and surface activity of Bi2O3 polymorphs
The choice of the synthetic route with controlled reaction conditions can substantially affect the size, morphology, and surface area of a photocatalyst. Bi2O3 can be easily obtained as micro-sized particles. However, studies revealed that substantially enhanced photoactivity of Bi2O3 is obtained at the nanoscale and improved morphology in Bi2O3 provides more contagious channels for charge transfer over the photocatalyst surface.52 In the last decade, most of the efforts were dedicated to the phase-selective synthesis of Bi2O3-based films. However, in recent years much attention has been devoted to the synthesis and studies of Bi2O3 nanowires, nanosheets, nanotubes, and nanoparticles. Many techniques have been reported for morphology engineering of the photoactive Bi2O3 phase for environmental and energy applications. However, a detailed and correlated analysis of the morphology of Bi2O3 is required to provide an understanding and generalized conclusion through practical prospects. Morphology tuning not only induces a higher specific surface area in nanomaterials but also helps to increase the optical properties and decrease the bandgap energy of Bi2O3 polymorphs. Besides, it offers more active sites, improves the charge separation efficiency, and shortens the path for charge transportation, resulting in enhanced photoactivity. Moreover, before analyzing the effect of various structural designs on the photocatalytic performance of Bi2O3, the steps involved in the photocatalytic reaction need to be understood. Usually, for microstructures, four steps are involved in the photocatalytic process as follows: (i) pollutants are transported inside the pores or active site of the photocatalyst through molecular diffusion. (ii) Adsorption of pollutant molecules on the active sites, where the reaction occurs. (iii) Desorption of the products from the photocatalyst surface. (iv) Diffusion of the product back to the bulk. It is important to note that if the adsorption rate of dye molecules present in the fluid phase is slower than the rate of the chemical reaction between the charge carriers (electron–hole) and dye molecules, the diffusion rate of these species controls the overall performance of the photocatalytic system.175 Therefore, assembling a microstructure that induces the greater transportation of reactants and products to a photocatalyst is highly need in the photocatalytic system. Next, we will discuss various approaches for morphology engineering in Bi2O3 polymorphs, i.e., preparing ultrathin film-based microstructures, hollow or porous microstructures, hierarchical microstructures, and crystal facet engineering. Moreover, we will analyze the morphology and surface activity relationship of various photoactive Bi2O3 polymorphs.
4.1 Bi2O3 thin films/ultrathin microstructures
Due to the physicochemical property and unique structure, ultrathin nanostructures are considered superior architectures compared to their bare counterparts for solar light utilization. It is important to note that most of the photolysis reaction occurs on the surface of the photocatalyst. Therefore, ultrathin microstructures show promise in photocatalytic reactions for environmental applications. Furthermore, ultrathin nanostructures exhibit a higher specific surface area than that of their pristine counterparts.176,177 The application of thin layered Bi2O3 films was studied over a long period, which have an advantage over nanoparticles in that they can be easily recycled.178 The synthesis of Bi2O3 thin film involves the preparation of a Bi precursor suspension followed by coating of the suspension on a substrate, i.e., ITO glass, Corning glass, sintered floating glass, SnO2 glass, silica discs, and (100)-oriented silicon wafer. Various methods have been used for the coating of Bi2O3 thin films on substrates, i.e., spray pyrolysis, magnetron sputtering, RF sputtering or vacuum evaporation method, dip solution, pulsed laser deposition, and chemical vapor deposition under ambient pressure condition. The obtained films are then annealed to obtain phase-pure Bi2O3.
The photoactive area of the thin-film-based photocatalyst is the area exposed to the pollutants plus the area of the outer surface of a thin film. Therefore, increasing the surface coverage of nanoparticles with thin films negatively affects the adsorption rate. This implies that even for porous or rough film surfaces, the photons cannot reach the hidden and deeper active sites of the photocatalyst. Therefore, the degradation percentage in thin-film photocatalysts is not directly proportional to their surface area because their internal structure remains in the dark, which eventually affects their overall efficiency. In addition, the low surface roughness of thin films does not have a good effect on photocatalysis and a higher surface roughness is required for the optimal photoactivity. However, given that light scattering is negatively proportional to the fourth power of wavelength, larger rough surfaces induce enhanced light scattering phenomena, which hamper the generation of charge carriers.179 Also, for a higher roughness, the mass transfer of species from the surface of thin-film catalysts to the pollutant solution may be limited due to the pollutant molecule adsorption–desorption rate on the photocatalyst surface, and thus constant agitation or turbulence is required.52 Nevertheless, inducing turbulence in thin film-based systems results in an additional cost to the photocatalytic system, and thus limits its large-scale scope.
The undesirable aggregation of nanoparticles in Bi2O3 films seriously affects their photocatalytic performance. Therefore, the effective separation of nanoparticles to avoid aggregation is important. Immobilization is considered to be an effective approach to avoid the aggregation of nanoparticles.67 The use of a substrate as a fixed or immobilized photocatalyst support for Bi2O3 thin films can avoid the recovery, filtration, and reusability costs in photocatalysis. Besides, the use of a substrate can help to stabilize the metastable β- and δ-Bi2O3. However, choosing a substrate with a suitable roughness can improve the morphology of Bi2O3 nanofilms, and hence the photoactivity of Bi2O3 polymorphs can be increased. For instance, Fig. 9 shows FESEM and optical images of the bare (Fig. 9a and d) and coated substrates. Thin β-Bi2O3 nanofilms were grown over a Corning glass substrate (Fig. 9b and c) and sintered silica (Fig. 9e and f) discs at 450 °C. The obtained films possessed different morphologies due to the difference in adhesion behavior induced by the higher porosity, roughness, and hydrophilicity of the silica discs.180 Moreover, the non-compact and random distribution of sub-microscale particles on the glass substrate resulted in poorer photocatalytic activity compared to the overlapping thin sheets coated one after one on a silica disc. Similarly, polycrystalline granular δ-Bi2O3 thin films were deposited on a glass substrate with different roughness via magnetron sputtering at 150 °C.52 The mechanically induced roughness on the glass substrate led to the production of more active sites per gram of thin film over the rough surface than that of flat films, eventually resulting in an increase in surface area. In addition, the grain size and roughness of thin films are dependent on the substrate roughness. For example, T. A. Gadhi et al. used the pneumatic spray pyrolysis method to produce β-Bi2O3 coatings on sintered silica discs and Corning glass at 450 °C. They evaluated the effect of a fixed support photocatalyst as an alternative to the conventional slurry-based photocatalytic system.180 Bismuth acetate precursor was used to obtain the β-Bi2O3 coatings. The immobilized β-Bi2O3 coating on the silica support exhibited remarkable activity against IC dye under visible-light irradiation.

The thickness of thin films plays a crucial role in the photoactivity of semiconductor materials and the photocurrent density changes with the thickness of Bi2O3 films. Therefore, a suitable Bi2O3 concentration is required to obtain the optimum thickness of thin films. Nevertheless, a lower amount of Bi2O3 in the suspension results in thinner Bi2O3 films and a more exposed substrate. Conversely, a higher concentration leads to the agglomeration of Bi2O3 on the substrate. Also, the roughness of thin films increases with the thickness of the films.52 This directly affects the bonding between the substrate and Bi2O3 material, which eventually retards the charge carrier mobility, thereby resulting in a photocurrent output. For instance, the drop-casting of Bi2O3 on an ITO glass substrate using various amounts of suspended particulates and different thicknesses was reported. N-type Bi2O3 nanoparticles were prepared via the chemical bath reaction method. Bismuth nitrate precursor was heated in ethylene glycol (EG) and benzyl alcohol (BA) solvent at 180 °C for 2–3 h to obtain Bi2O3 particles. The as-obtained Bi2O3 was further treated through the drop-cast method and annealed at 600 °C for 10 h to get particulate thin films of α- and ω-Bi2O3. The photocatalytic activity for various thicknesses of Bi2O3 thin films prepared by different Bi2O3 particulate solutions, i.e., 300, 400, and 500 μL, was evaluated. The thin films prepared with 400 μL suspension exhibited enhanced photoactivity against RhB dye under UV- and visible-light irradiation owing to the optimum photocurrent density.54
The selection of a suitable annealing temperature for the synthesis of Bi2O3 films is promising towards pollutant degradation and water splitting photocatalytic reactions.178,181 The annealing temperature not only helps the phase transformation in Bi2O3 but also helps to tailor the surface roughness, tuning the morphology and crystal growth of Bi2O3. For instance, Fig. 10 presents the SEM images of the Bi2O3 films obtained at different annealing temperatures. Firstly, a Bi-based gel was prepared via the sol–gel method using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor and coated over a floating glass by dipping it into a Bi suspension for 3 min, and it was dried and heated at 390 °C.181 The subsequent annealing of the obtained films at 450 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C resulted in an average particle size of 109 nm, 122 nm, and 111 nm, respectively. The XRD spectra revealed the presence of both α- and β-Bi2O3 phases in all the samples. Nevertheless, non-uniform-sized particles were obtained at 450 °C (Fig. 10a) and 600 °C (Fig. 10c) with an irregular hole distribution throughout the surface. Conversely, more uniform particles with less irregular pores and improved crystalline structure appeared by annealing at 550 °C (Fig. 10b). In another study, they revealed that different temperatures resulted in a change in the proportion of α and β phase and suggested that a higher proportion of tetragonal phase with enhanced electronic band properties was obtained at 550 °C, which exhibited improved photoactivity for the degradation of RhB.178 Similarly, the effect of substrate temperature on the photocatalytic performance was studied for water splitting experiments under near UV-light irradiation.182 The β and γ phases of Bi2O3 thin films were prepared from bismuth(III) tert-butoxide precursor and deposited over a glass substrate via low-pressure vapor deposition at 425 °C and 500 °C, respectively. The results revealed non-uniform film growth at the lower temperature. However, a uniform film with enhanced thickness was obtained at the higher temperature, revealing that the substrate temperature directly influences the morphology of Bi2O3 thin films.

In addition to the annealing temperature, a suitable annealing time of thin films helps to improve the surface of Bi2O3 polymorphs. Studies revealed that a short annealing time of a Bi2O3 thin-film resulted in the formation of dense film. Conversely, annealing for a long time resulted in a porous surface due to the release of gases from the unburned organics, which cannot be completely burned within a short annealing period. The other possible reason may be that the grains do not grow into larger crystals due to the inadequate or short annealing time. Also, by increasing the thin-film thickness, the small particles aggregate, resulting in the formation of larger particles. This eventually induces more empty spaces among the particles on a thin film and helps to improve the crystallinity of Bi2O3. Furthermore, the porous surface facilitates the transport of more pollutants molecules to the active sites of the photocatalyst. All these factors result in enhanced photoactivity in thin-film-based photocatalysts. For example, β-Bi2O3 nanofilms were obtained by initially depositing different thicknesses of pure Bi films over FTO conductive glass via magnetron sputtering. For comparison, the films obtained at 5 min, 40 min, and 90 min deposition time were then calcined at 250 °C for different times.183 The thin film obtained after 5 min and 40 min deposition times and annealed for 1 h possessed a dense surface. Conversely, the thin films obtained after 40 min and 90 min deposition times were annealed for 3 h, resulting in a porous surface. The XRD diffraction patterns revealed the formation of β-Bi2O3 in the samples obtained after 40 min and 90 min of deposition time. However, the longer annealing time resulted in better crystallinity and a porous structure with more light-harvesting properties.
The photocatalytic activity of template-based β-Bi2O3 thin films is enhanced for the degradation RhB compared to that of non-templated thin films. For instance, mesoporous films of β-Bi2O3 were prepared via the co-assembly of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O with the polymer template of poly(ethylene co-butylene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer.184 The thin films were dip-coated on fluorine-doped SnO2 glass and a (100)-oriented silicon wafer substrate followed by annealing at 400 °C. The as-obtained template-based thin films exhibited enhanced photoactivity compared to that of the non-template-based Bi2O3 films produced via the electrospinning method.
It is evident from the literature that the different morphologies of a semiconductor photocatalyst result in different photocatalytic behaviors owing to the enhanced surface area and improved photoelectrochemical properties. Bi2O3 thin films with a nanoplate-like structure were prepared using bismuth(III) acetate powders dissolved in 25% acetic acid solution and coated on a Corning glass and c-Si substrate via spray pyrolysis at 350–450 °C.175 The round bordered nanoplate-based β-Bi2O3 thin films obtained at 450 °C exhibited remarkable photoactivity against MO and Acid Blue 113 (AB) dye in acidic solution and natural pH (pH = 8), respectively. Nevertheless, the round bordered plates in compact form induced roughness in the thin films, resulting in a higher surface area compared to that of the smooth surface.
4.2 Hierarchical microstructures
Among the various structures obtained by morphology tuning used to enhance the overall efficiency of photocatalysts, hierarchical architectures show more promise than pristine photocatalysts. The self-assembly fabrication of hierarchical architectures through nanometer-scaled building blocks not only helps to enhance the light-harvesting and reactant adsorption on the photocatalyst surface but prevents the aggregation of nano-blocks and improves the transportation of guest species to the framework binding sites, resulting in an enhanced quantum efficiency in photocatalysts. In addition, the hierarchical architecture provides more reaction active sites with enhanced surface area and minimizes the mass transfer barriers. Moreover, a slow electron transfer and fast charge recombination rate reduce the efficiency of a photocatalytic system. Therefore, a suitable microstructure is required to promote effective charge separation and transfer in semiconductor crystals. The nanosized effect of building blocks facilitates the efficient transfer and migration of species to the surface of Bi2O3. This results in a reduced recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers and enhanced photoactivity in hierarchical architectures based Bi2O3. Moreover, the unique structural feature and morphology of hierarchical architectures provide shortened bulk diffusion lengths for charge carriers and lower charge transfer resistance, which prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers and restrict the recombination of electron–hole pairs. In this section, we discuss the surface modification of Bi2O3 hierarchitectures and their effect on the photoactivity of various Bi2O3 polymorphs.
Nanoparticle-based morphological structures often suffer from aggregation due to their higher surface energy, which reduces the exposed active sites in photocatalysts. In comparison with nanoparticles, hierarchical architectures restrain the aggregation of nanosized building blocks due to their unique structural features, resulting in highly active sites on the crystal plane. As shown in Fig. 11, there are four major routes for the synthesis of Bi2O3 hierarchical architectures as follows: (i) use of a template, i.e., in situ template sacrificial dissolution and self-templating process; (ii) template-free route, i.e., chemically induced self-transformation, in situ template-free assembling process, and self-templating process; (iii) calcination, i.e., air calcination of pure Bi2O3 or Bi-based precursor; and (iv) post-synthetic treatment, i.e., etching. Among them, the template-free synthetic route for the preparation of Bi2O3 polymorphs has been highly explored due to its high yield and reproducibility. However, despite the good solar light harvesting, high diffusion rate, and photocatalytic reaction kinetics of the hierarchical architecture of Bi2O3, it exhibits the drawback of high charge carrier recombination rate, which directly influences its photoactivity. Furthermore, in the case of sluggish surface reaction, the photo-corrosion process is accelerated due to the accumulation of photogenerated electron and holes on the hierarchical architecture. Nevertheless, surface modification can be reduced by introducing heteroatoms or defects and loading a suitable cocatalyst185 to accelerate the surface reaction kinetics.
 Fig. 11  Various approaches used in the synthesis of Bi2O3 hierarchical architectures. 
The morphology of hierarchal architectures induces a significant effect on the surface area, light-harvesting, and quantum efficiency of Bi2O3 polymorphs and imparts a positive effect on their photoactivity. For example, the morphology β-Bi2O3 was improved by adding bismuth subacetate or bismuth oxide formate to bismuth citrate followed by calcination under similar conditions. Fig. 12 shows the SEM and TEM images of β-Bi2O3 obtained at a calcination temperature of 350 °C for 4 h. The calcination of pure bismuth citrate resulted in the formation of nanosheet-based quasi-spherical hierarchitecture (Fig. 12a). The TEM (Fig. 12c) studies revealed that these nanosheets are formed via the aggregation of the nanoparticles in the 2D direction and dozens of nanosheets assembled in a quasi-spherical manner through self-assembly. However, by calcining bismuth citrate with bismuth subacetate (Fig. 12b and d) or bismuth oxide formate (Fig. 12e and f), a significant change in morphology and a nanoparticle-based hollow spherical and nanoparticle-based multilayered sheet-like 3D hierarchal architecture was obtained, respectively. The as-obtained multilayered sheet-like 3D architecture exhibited an enhanced photodegradation efficiency among the architectures due to its improved visible-light absorption and higher BET surface area. In the case of the addition of bismuth subacetate, the recycling experiments revealed a decrease in photoactivity and the degradation of β-Bi2O3 to β-Bi2O3 and Bi2O2CO3 after three runs. However, the addition of bismuth oxide formate resulted in highly stable β-Bi2O3 after four cycles. The structural decomposition of Bi2O3 in CO32−-containing solution is evident from the literature.186 It seems that the photogenerated holes preferentially oxidize these ions and destabilize the Bi2O3 crystal structure to form the more stable Bi2O2CO3. However, these degradation processes are not catalytic but Bi2O3-assisted photo-oxidation processes. Moreover, the decrease in photoactivity was due to the formation of the UV-light-active Bi2O2CO3.

The assembly-controlled synthesis and morphology of Bi2O3 nanostructures can be achieved by using hard or soft templates. However, the use of template or surfactants is energy wasteful and induces the formation of heterogeneous impurities on the catalyst surface. Therefore, many attempts have been made to find a template-free method for the self-assembly synthesis of hierarchical architectures of Bi2O3. Besides, the development of self-assembly in Bi2O3 nanostructures with a controlled morphology is still a challenge. In general, the self-assembly process can be divided into four steps as follows: (i) generation of tiny crystalline nuclei, also known as the nucleation process; (ii) growth of crystalline nuclei into nanoparticles; (iii) aggregation of nanoparticles to a large sphere; and (iv) nanocrystal growth on the surface of the microsphere in a particular direction due to the presence of small protuberances, which provides high energy sites for the growth of nanocrystals, which is also known as the crystallization process. Nevertheless, the presence of a template or surfactant restricts the aggregation of nanoparticles, as described in step (iii), and results in an enhanced surface area.
In addition, a decrease in the surface energy of specific crystal planes results in preferential growth and alters the crystal orientation. Therefore, the addition of foreign molecules dramatically influences the crystal nucleation and growth by attaching onto specific crystal planes, resulting in a decrease in the surface energy. For instance, W. Wang et al. reported the synthesis of self-assembled hierarchical δ-Bi2O3 nanostructures with a flower-like morphology.101 The template-free method at 60–80 °C in the presence of VO3− ions was employed, and the pH of the solution was maintained at 12. The two-stage growth process followed the Ostwald ripening and self-assembly process. The aggregation of nanoparticles reduces their exposed surface area, which is also known as Ostwald ripening. However, in this case, the microspheres produced by the Ostwald ripening technique started dissolving at 80 °C and nucleated on the protuberances, followed by anisotropic growth of the crystallized particles into nanosheets. The growth of nanosheets into a flowery self-organized structure continued until all the nanoparticles were consumed, which exhibited enhanced photoactivity for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation due to its enhanced surface area. Later, a room-temperature-stable 3D δ-Bi2O3 hierarchical architecture was prepared via the sol–gel method at a lower temperature of 70 °C via a similar method by W. Wang et al.101 The effect on the structural properties of Bi2O3 with and without Cu loading was investigated.78,83 Similar to the report of W. Wang et al., the δ-Bi2O3 hierarchitecture was composed of thin sheets. The TEM results revealed that these thin sheets were made up of nanoparticles. This suggests that the slightly higher temperature and basic environment helped to dissolve the nanoparticles and resulted in the formation of dense nanosheets with an increased thickness from 5 nm to 40 nm. The enhanced photoactivity of δ-Bi2O3 against atrazine was attributed to its hierarchal architecture, which facilitated multiple light reflection and scattering and high surface area.
The operating temperature significantly affects the morphology of the Bi2O3 hierarchitecture owing to the slow self-assembly of nuclei at a lower temperature. This implies that a higher temperature facilitates the self-assembly of nuclei, resulting in a change in morphology, which affects the photoresponse of a photocatalyst. For instance, Fig. 13 shows the FESEM images of self-assembled honeycomb brush- and worm-like α-Bi2O3 hierarchitectures prepared by calcining microrod-like bismuth oxalate precursor at 300 °C (Fig. 13a) and 400 °C (Fig. 13b), respectively.187 The increase in temperature resulted in the fusion of the particles, while an aggregated plate-like morphology appeared with a further increase in temperature to 500 °C. The self-assembled α-Bi2O3 prepared at 300 °C possessed a higher surface area and pore volume, resulting in enhanced photoactivity for the degradation of Acid Orange-7 (AO) dye under simulated light irradiation. These findings suggest that numerous factors, i.e., preparation technique and operating temperature, can induce structural changes in Bi2O3 polymorphs. Furthermore, the self-assembly of Bi2O3 nanoparticles can be tailored into sheet-like or plate-like hierarchical architectures via the dissolution or diffusion of nanoparticles in a wide temperature range, significantly enhancing the photoactivity of Bi2O3 polymorphs.

In the case of organometallic precursors, i.e., polymer compounds and Bi-based precursors, the nanocrystal morphology and control overgrowth need to be considered. The use of capping agents not only restricts the uncontrolled crystal growth but also prevents the agglomeration of nanoparticles by adsorbing on the surface of the nanocrystals. Besides, they provide colloidal stability and act as a stabilizing agent.188 Moreover, the use of a suitable capping agent helps in the formation of hierarchical architectures of Bi2O3. For example, a 3D flower-like hierarchical architecture was produced by using HAC or HNO3 as a capping agent, which exhibited an enhanced photodegradation efficiency against sulfamethoxazole (SM) under simulated light irradiation.189 The hierarchical architecture of α- and β-Bi2O3 involves the aggregation of nanoparticles and the self-assembly of microspheres into a hierarchical flowery structure by the Ostwald ripening process. The enhanced photoactivity was attributed to the higher surface area, narrow bandgap energy, and existence of the β phase. Conversely, a template-free hierarchical assembly of α-Bi2O3 nanorod-based columns was synthesized in the presence of halogen ions.151 Inorganic salts, i.e., NaCl, NH4Br, and NH4Cl, and surfactants, i.e., CTAB and CTAC, were used as the halogen ion source. They revealed that the positive ions of the surfactants did not affect the morphology and size of the nanocrystals. However, the negative ions present in inorganic salts significantly affected the morphology of α-Bi2O3 and promoted the hierarchical assembly of nanorods. The as-obtained nanorod-based hierarchical architecture exhibited better photoactivity than that of scattered nanorods owing to the multiple light reflections within the interior structure of the columnar Bi2O3, which resulted in the generation of more holes and electrons.
Based on the explanations demonstrated above, it can be concluded that (i) the hierarchical architecture facilitates high diffusion kinetics and provides more efficient channels for the reactant molecules to reach the active sites of the photocatalyst owing to the interconnected pore network; (ii) the hierarchical architecture offers a high surface to volume ratio and results in the equal distribution of active sites over the whole catalyst; and (iii) the porous and hollow hierarchical architecture promotes multiple light scattering among primary particles such as nanosheets and high solar light utilization.
4.3 Hollow/porous microstructures
The construction of a hollow and porous morphology of Bi2O3 polymorphs shows promise for the degradation of pollutants due to its enhanced solar light absorption, low density, large cavity volume, enhanced surface area, and wide application in pollutant degradation and water splitting. The hollow and porous Bi2O3 results in increased charge carrier transportation by increasing the optical path length of incident light due to the multiple light reflection and scattering inside the microstructure.190,191 Additionally, the porous structure substantially increases the degradation rate of pollutants due to the encapsulation of the target pollutant on the internal surface of the pores. This is highly favorable in the photocatalytic process. Fig. 14 represents various approaches used to synthesize hollow/porous Bi2O3 microstructures and the effect of these microstructures on the properties of Bi2O3. Generally, a hollow and porous microstructure improves the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 in four ways as follows: (i) inducing more light absorption due to the repeated refraction of incident light. (ii) Reducing the internal resistance and tightening the outer parts of the structure due to strong interface contact, which gives rise to effective charge separation. (iii) Enhancing the active surface area, which helps adsorb more reactant molecules and active species on the catalyst surface. (iv) Reducing the transport distance of electrons and holes and benefitting the diffusion of species between the bulk and the catalyst. Nevertheless, the tailoring of a unique morphology in Bi2O3 often requires complex methods and use of non-sustainable or toxic materials. However, the use of these materials often affects the photocatalytic properties and bandgap of Bi2O3 polymorphs.
 Fig. 14  Various approaches used in the synthesis of hollow/porous Bi2O3 microstructures and the effect of hollow/porous microstructures on the properties of Bi2O3. 
As shown in Fig. 13, the hollow and porous Bi2O3 microstructures can be prepared via four ways as follows: (i) modification of Bi2O3 photocatalyst obtained from conventional low temperature, hydrothermal or sonochemical synthetic route, where the release of gases upon calcination results in the formation of a hollow and porous microstructure; (ii) calcination of Bi-based precursors, where high-temperature calcination helps remove organics and facilitates the formation of a hollow and porous structure with enlarged particle size; (iii) choosing an appropriate solvent, where the solvent may act as a soft template for the self-assembly of nanoparticles to hollow or porous microstructures and (iv) use of surfactant and dispersant, inducing the high dispersion of nanoparticles, which then assembled into a hollow structure. Several hollow and porous Bi2O3 microstructures have been reported in the literature, i.e., rod-, sphere- and sheet-like morphologies. Noteworthy, different hollow and porous morphologies exhibit distinct photocatalytic properties owing to the change in light pathways, interfacial charge transfer, pore size, surface area and mass transportation between the catalyst surface and the pollutant bulk.
Owing to their template-free features, self-templated methods such as the Kirkendall effect, Ostwald ripening and galvanic replacement methods are the common strategies for producing controllable porous microstructures.192–195 However, similar to the hierarchical architecture, the development of hollow and porous microstructures in Bi2O3 has been reported following the Ostwald ripening and self-assembly process.43,196,197 Therefore, hierarchical architectures with a porous morphology can add more advantages to the photoactivity of Bi2O3 and substantially boost the mass transfer effect during photocatalysis. For instance, honeycomb-like α-Bi2O3 obtained at 300 °C with a porous self-assembled hierarchical architecture exhibited enhanced photoactivity. A increase in the annealing temperature resulted in poor photoactivity against AO dye due to particle fusion and the formation of a worm-like morphology.187
A uniform hollow spherical morphology provides less resistance for charge carrier transportation than that of a non-uniform morphology and reduces the charge recombination rate, which helps increase the photoactivity of Bi2O3.17 However, a nonuniform microstructure provides a relatively higher active surface area. Therefore, other properties should be considered when dealing with these microstructures. Furthermore, it is observed that the solvent used as a complexing agent sometimes behaves and works equivalently as a soft template by self-assembling the particles. For instance, α- and β-Bi2O3 were produced via a template-free method from Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in the presence of glycerol and ethanol solvents followed by calcination at 270 °C and 350 °C, respectively.105Fig. 15a and b show that both the α- and β-Bi2O3 possessed a sphere-like hollow morphology owing to the self-assembly process followed by Ostwald ripening (Fig. 15c). The high calcination temperature resulted in a non-uniform morphology in α-Bi2O3 with a high surface area due to the aggregation of particles on the photocatalyst surface, and more broken spheres appeared in Fig. 15b. However, β-Bi2O3 obtained at lower temperature exhibited enhanced photoactivity for water splitting due to its uniform structure and reduced bandgap energy of 2.36 eV compared to that of 2.82 eV of α-Bi2O3.

A porous microstructure facilitates the interaction of the reactive species not only at the surface but throughout the bulk of the material. It is equally assumed that a porous microstructure possesses a higher surface area and more active species, and thus pollutants can interact more with the active sites present in the inside and outside of the surface of a porous catalyst. In addition, highly porous microstructures with large internal pores can capture more incident light.2 However, large-sized pores can negatively affect the photoactivity of semiconductor materials because a larger pore volume reduces the reflection and scattering of photons on the surface of the photocatalyst. This generates more photogenerated electron–hole pairs and eventually results in poor photoactivity.2 Conversely, a porous microstructure provides more passageways for the reactant and products to reach the catalyst surface and bulk of the pollutant, thereby resulting in high adsorption and diffusion rates. This is beneficial for increased mass transfer and results in enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, a higher active surface area with a suitable porous structure is equally vital in the photocatalysis process. Interestingly, the doping or interacting Bi2O3 with suitable compounds can help optimize its pore volume and increase its surface area. For instance, β-Bi2O3 was prepared via the calcination of pure bismuth oxalate precursor at 300 °C with a lamellar-like morphology.111 The increase in temperature resulted in the re-arrangement of the atoms with the agglomeration of nanoparticles, and coral-like α-Bi2O3 was produced at 600 °C. α-Bi2O3 and β-Bi2O3 possessed a surface area of 0.65 m2 g−1 and 2.68 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.0029 cm3 g−1 and 0.02053 cm3 g−1, respectively. The addition of CeO2 improved the photocatalytic performance of β-Bi2O3. This substantially increased the surface area and pore volume of β-Bi2O3 to 11.64 m2 g−1 and 0.06195 cm3 g−1, resulting in an increase in the photoactivity of β-Bi2O3. Similarly, porous β-Bi2O3 was produced via a sol–gel method by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor in 2-methoxy ethanol solvent in the presence of additive urea followed by calcination at 400 °C.75 The addition of a 0.5 to 1 molar ratio of urea to Bi(NO3)3·5H2O resulted in the semi-transformation of the β phase into γ-Bi2O3, and a mixture of β- and γ-Bi2O3 was obtained. A remarkable increase in surface area from 0.68 m2 g−1 to 9.68 m2 g−1 and pore volume from 0.010 cm3 g−1 to 0.1 cm3 g−1, respectively, was observed. The enhanced photoactivity of the β/γ-Bi2O3 mixture for the H2 evolution reaction was attributed to its high surface area and high pore volume. Similarly, highly porous rod-like metastable β-Bi2O3 was produced by calcining an imperforated Bi-based precursor at 300 °C in an air environment.121 The as-obtained β-Bi2O3 exhibited poor photoactivity owing to its low surface area of 0.68 m2 g−1. However, the addition of fluorine increased the surface area of Bi2O3 up to 6.77 m2 g−1 by reducing the size of rods and the stacking of the nanosheets and nanoparticles.
In addition to the calcination temperature, the calcination time also induces characteristics change in the crystal structure of Bi2O3 polymorphs. Specifically, a short annealing time can only remove the precursor, solvent, and surfactants, resulting in the presence of impurities on the surface of the photocatalyst. Furthermore, the impurities present in the inner bulk of Bi2O3 require more time to decompose into gaseous products. Therefore, a long annealing time facilitates the decomposition of more impurities. Moreover, the release of gaseous products promotes the formation of more passageways for the release of gases and results in a highly porous structure with an enhanced surface area. For instance, H. J. Jung et al. revealed that a longer annealing time could improve the crystallinity, porosity, and surface area of the β-Bi2O3 polymorph.123 They calcined a bismuth-ethanediolate complex at a low temperature of 250 °C to obtain phase-pure β-Bi2O3. The BET surface area for an annealing time of 3 h, 5 h, and 7 h increased to 8 m2 g−1, 9 m2 g−1, and 17 m2 g−1, respectively. Moreover, the β-Bi2O3 obtained after 7 h of annealing resulted in a highly crystalline and porous nanostructure with the best photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB.
4.4 Crystal facet engineering
Crystal facet engineering in Bi2O3 polymorphs is a promising technique to enhance their photocatalytic performance. However, controlling a surface facet has been a challenge for researchers for a long time.125 Before elaborating facet engineering in Bi2O3 for photocatalytic applications, the understanding about the facets of semiconductor materials and their growth characteristics is important. In general, the surface of a semiconductor material is composed of several facets, and each facet possess surface energy with different electronic band structures and arrangements of atoms and exhibits intrinsic surface physiochemical properties. These facets collectively make the surface of a photocatalyst and occupy different volumes on the crystal surface. Due to the difference in surface energies, these facets can be categorized into highly exposed or less exposed facets. As the semiconductor crystal grows, these facets rapidly diminish or are exposed owing to the minimization of and excess surface energy, respectively. Nevertheless, selective facet growth with distinct electronic properties plays a critical role in a photocatalytic system. Therefore, the understanding the relationship between facets and photoactivity is very important.
As shown in Fig. 16, the facets exposed over a photocatalyst surface can affect the performance of the photocatalytic system through many ways, as follows: (i) The atomic arrangement on the surface, which determines the activation and adsorption of the reactant molecules (Fig. 16a). (ii) Surface electronic band structures, which provide tunable redox ability in photocatalytic reactions (Fig. 16b). (iii) Efficiency of separation and transfer of charges inside a semiconductor, which results in diverse charge densities for surface reactions (Fig. 16c).198 Therefore, to control the surface photocatalytic reaction, the exposed facets should be reasonably selected. Notably, various Bi2O3 polymorphs behave differently during a photocatalytic reaction. This is because the synthetic approach substantially affects the surface structure and photocatalytic performance of a photocatalyst and is closely related to its crystal facets. Moreover, the tuning and growth of selectively exposed facets with large surface coverage can enhance the photocatalytic performance against a particular pollutant. The facet engineering in photoactive Bi2O3 polymorphs involves both kinetic and thermodynamic control and represents the bottom-up methodology to manipulate the atom's assembly in a crystal with a relative growth rate to get a more stable facet.

Reproduced from S. Bai et al.198 
The presence of O2 vacancies can engineer the band structure and facilitates the transportation of charge carriers. Moreover, as discussed above, different surface facets possess different electronic band structures due to the different configurations and arrangements of atoms. Therefore, the combined effect of both can result in a shift in the VB and CB to optimum levels, thus altering the oxidation and reduction potentials of photogenerated charge carriers, respectively. For instance, porous β-Bi2O3 with highly exposed {220} facets together with multiple oxygen vacancies was prepared.119 The hydrothermal treatment of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in the presence of dilute acetic solution at 130 °C followed by calcination at 300 °C resulted in the formation of phase-pure β-Bi2O3. The high exposure of {220} facets in β-Bi2O3 facilitates the generation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface and results in a porous microstructure. The as-obtained Bi2O3 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of 2-CP pollutant under visible-light irradiation. The enhanced photoactivity was attributed to the strong surface polarizing effect on the related orbitals and atoms. This reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers due to the presence of multiple oxygen vacancies.
Various methodologies to engineer the crystal facets of Bi2O3 have been studied over a long period. However, a main approach to determine the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 by exposing its active surface remains to be explored. Generally, facet engineering in semiconductor materials induces high surface energies. According to the Wulff theory of crystal growth, the surface energy of a material can be compared under equilibrium growth conditions.39 This means that a low crystal face has more tendencies to change into an exposed facet. Conversely, high-energy crystal faces have a high probability to disappear during the crystal growth process. As already discussed, the addition of a surfactant can alter the surface energies and help the growth of selective facets in Bi2O3. Therefore, the use of a suitable surfactant is critical and facilitates crystal growth in Bi2O3. For instance, the synergistic effect of the crystal structure and introduction of surfactant-induced oxygen vacancies were recognized.199 α- and β-Bi2O3 were produced via the sol–gel method at room temperature, and their photocatalytic effect on the removal of NO was investigated. NaOH and oxalic acid were separately mixed in Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution in the presence of CTAB surfactant. The obtained dry powders were calcined at 350 °C and 270 °C to obtain phase-pure α-Bi2O3 with {200} facets and β-Bi2O3 with {220} facets, respectively. The enhanced photoactivity in β-Bi2O3 was attributed to its enhanced light absorption range and high separation efficiency of charge carriers. Also, the oxygen defects helped to accelerate the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and activation of the reactants.
Besides kinetic control, the maneuvering of facets in the thermodynamic regime must be discussed. It is important to note that the use of facet-selective additives falls in the category of thermodynamic control.198 Moreover, the additives can be selectively absorbed on specific facets and facilitate crystal growth along their axis. For instance, α-Bi2O3 and β-Bi2O3 were selectively prepared through the hydrothermal treatment of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in the presence of additive lysine under different pH conditions at 160 °C for 24 h.133 The calcination of the obtained bismuth oxalate precursor powders separately at 270 °C and 350 °C resulted in the formation of β- and α-Bi2O3, respectively. It was recognized that lysine was specifically absorbed on the selective facet and inhibited surface growth.
Besides experimental work, theoretical approaches and computational methods, i.e., DFT, have been used to calculate the surface energies of facets. The topochemical transformation of facets was discovered, and the low energy {001} facet of Bi2O2CO3 was transformed into high energy {001} facet of β-Bi2O3.125 The synthetic method is already described in section 3.4, in which Bi2O2CO3 was calcined at 420 °C to obtain metastable β-Bi2O3. The exposed {001} and {110} facets of β-Bi2O3 exhibited a higher surface energy of 1.96 J m−2 and 1.43 J m−2 compared to that of 1.23 J m−2 for the {001} facet and 1.37 J m−2 for the {110} facet of Bi2O2CO3, respectively. It was suggested that the presence of CO32− on the surface of β-Bi2O3 altered the surface energy of Bi2O3 and the lattice match between the {220} facet of β-Bi2O3 and the {110} facet of Bi2O2CO3 was the main reason for the formation of β-Bi2O3 with exposed and highly active {001} facets. The enhanced UV-visible and visible-light photoactivity in β-Bi2O3 towards NO oxidation was due to its exposed {001} facets. Similarly, H. Liu et al. prepared single-crystalline nanosheets of porous β-Bi2O3 through a template-free method for the degradation of RhB under simulated sunlight irradiation.200 A mixture of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and acetic acid was added in ethanol solvent and hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 20 h to obtain Bi2O2CO3. The obtained product was calcined at 300 or 400 °C to obtain pure β-Bi2O3 with {001} exposed facets and was compared with Er3+-doped β-Bi2O3 obtained via the addition of Er(NO3)3·6H2O before hydrothermal synthesis. The DFT surface energy calculations revealed the higher surface energy of the {001} facets in β-Bi2O3, and the enhanced photoactivity was attributed to the exposed facet and the dopant Er3+.
In some studies, DFT calculations were conducted to determine the effect of oxygen vacancies on the photocatalytic activity of α- and β-Bi2O3.199 Lei et al. used VASP5.4 (Vienna ab initio simulation package) to conduct DFT calculations, which suggested that oxygen defects facilitate the activation of the reactants and accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen defects in δ-Bi2O3 was studied using DFT and EPR calculations for photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic applications.201 The calculated bandgap energy of 1.00 eV for δ-Bi2O3 was smaller than that from the experimental results, which was suggested to be due to the underestimation of DFT. The 4.95- and 9.86-times higher photoelectrocatalytic activity than the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activity was suggested to be due to oxygen defects, proper bias voltage, and honeycomb-like structure.
Conversely, DFT calculations were employed to calculate the energy band structure of Bi2O3. Zhang et al. reported experimental and first-principle investigations of indium-doped β-Bi2O3 for photocatalytic water splitting applications.80 The results revealed an upward shift in conduction band due to Bi, O, and In orbital hybridization without substantial widening of the bandgap energy. Similarly, the crystal structure of photoactive α- and β-Bi2O3 was calculated for water splitting applications.92 The bandgap energy from first principles calculations revealed an indirect band transition of 2.20 eV for the α phase and 0.97 eV for β-Bi2O3. The small bandgap energy of both phases by theoretical calculations was suggested to be due to underestimation and DFT limitations, as discussed in section 2.1.
Based on structure-dependent photoactivity in the Bi2O3 phases, the summary of the relationship and structure-photoactivity mechanism revealed that the crystal structure of the Bi2O3 phase has a great influence on its photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic reaction occurs on the active sites of the Bi2O3 surface. Therefore, its photocatalytic efficiency can be increased by morphology tuning and nanostructure size optimization. Moreover, an increase in the surface area of Bi2O3 gives rise to an increase in the number of active sites. Thereby, the proportion of crystal facets with higher photocatalytic activity also increases. Nevertheless, the morphological effect in the same Bi2O3 phase with different nanostructures (i.e., nanospheres, nanowires, and nanosheets) can be interpreted as structural sensitivity or crystal facet-dependent reactivity. In addition, it is generally assumed that achieving higher surface energy facets is thermodynamically unfavorable.202 However, in the high-temperature phase synthesis of Bi2O3, this can be achieved by controlling and optimizing the synthesis conditions.
5. Phase junction in Bi2O3 for photocatalytic application
Generally, the phase junction in semiconductor photocatalysts is divided into two categories, i.e., heterojunction- and homojunction-based photocatalysts. During the photocatalytic process, the high electron–hole recombination rate is one of the utmost problems and hot topics among researchers. A photocatalyst with a high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers cannot utilize enough solar light for energy and environmental applications.203 A possible solution may be developing a properly engineered junction in which two photocatalysts possessing a staggered band structure configuration are assembled. As shown in Fig. 17a, the electrons present in the VB when interacting with photons jump to the CB, leaving holes behind. However, they rapidly fall back to the VB and combine with the holes due to the coulombic force present between them to form electron–hole pairs. This recombination of electrons and holes reduces the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst.204 However, this problem can be addressed by introducing a lower energy CB or an unequal band structure interface (Fig. 17b). Accordingly, the electrons falling back will land on the CB of another interacting photocatalyst, thus restricting the recombination of electron–hole pairs and resulting in higher photocatalytic activity of semiconductor photocatalysts. It is important to note that, due to the high Coulomb constant of 8.99 × 109 N m2 kg−2, these electron falls to the CB rapidly, and thus the separation of electron–hole pairs is difficult to achieve. Therefore, to restrict the combination of electron–hole pairs, proper engineering of the photocatalyst structure is of very important. Several articles reported the application of developing a phase junction in Bi2O3 for photocatalytic applications, as shown in Table 2. However, the fabrication of efficient junctions is a great challenge and much research is still needed to develop a state-of-the-art strategy to synthesize phase junction-based photocatalysts. In this section, we analyze the synthetic approaches, intrinsic electron mobility, structural design and photocatalytic properties of various Bi2O3 phase junction photocatalysts.

Due to the stable and metastable characteristics of the Bi2O3 phase, various strategies (Fig. 18) have been employed to prepare Bi2O3 phase junction photocatalysts, as follows: (i) partial phase transformation of metastable phase into stable phase at a higher temperature; (ii) stabilizing a metastable phase by interacting with a stable phase and (iii) controlling the Bi2O3 phase ratio in a phase mixture to obtain a highly photoactive phase junction. In addition, various approaches have been considered to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 phase junction photocatalysts, as follows: (i) morphology tuning and increasing the surface area; (ii) band structure alignment for transportation of charge carriers and (iii) improving the light absorption properties. Thereby, the improvement in one or more properties gives rise to the formation of highly active phase junction photocatalysts.
 Fig. 18  Various strategies used for the preparation of Bi2O3 phase junction photocatalysts. 
The synthesis temperature plays a vital role in the selective phase transformation of Bi2O3 and controls the phase ratio in heterojunction photocatalysts. For instance, the high-temperature phase transformation of β-Bi2O3 into the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction through hydrothermal treatment was reported at various temperatures in the range of 90–240 °C.205 The results revealed that by increasing the temperature above 150 °C, sheet-like β-Bi2O3 starts transforming into nanowire-like α-Bi2O3, and an increase in the ratio of α-Bi2O3 was noticed in a mixture of α and β-Bi2O3. The more negative CB edge potential of α-Bi2O3 than that of β-Bi2O3 revealed the formation of a type-II heterojunction. The as-obtained heterojunction exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB and MO under visible-light irradiation.
Moreover, the photoluminescence spectra revealed a slow electron–hole recombination rate and the enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the high charge separation and transfer across the α-/β-phase junction. Later, the adsorption capabilities and the photocatalytic performance of α-/β-Bi2O3 for a mixture of two dyes (IC and RhB) under UV- and visible-light irradiation was discussed.137 The α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction and α-Bi2O3 photocatalyst were prepared by firstly annealing Bi(NO3)3 at 250 °C for 2 h. The as-obtained powder was then annealed at 550 °C and 650 °C for 2 h to obtain an α-/β-Bi2O3 mixture and pure α-Bi2O3, respectively. It was reported that the heterojunction photocatalyst was composed of 20% β-Bi2O3 phase, and with an increase in temperature, no change in particle size was observed except a phase transformation. The discussion on the mechanism of the degradation of the two dyes using the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst revealed the selective degradation of the anionic IC dye first and RhB started to degrade after the complete degradation of the IC dye. The α-Bi2O3 obtained at 650 °C exhibited a higher UV-light but poor visible-light response owing to its large bandgap of 2.9 eV. In contrast, β-Bi2O3 exhibited a much smaller (2.3 eV) bandgap energy and the high visible-light absorption in the heterojunction was suggested to be due to the presence of the β phase and lower (2.7 eV) bandgap energy than that of pure α-Bi2O3. Furthermore, the enhanced photoactivity of the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction compared to that of α- and β-Bi2O3 was attributed to the higher electron–hole separation rate. Besides the effect of the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction on the photoactivity, the probable change in morphology and information on the exposed facets obtained at elevated temperature were not discussed.
A heterojunction between two similar phases of Bi2O3 can result in enhanced photoactivity compared to individual phase. Thus far, most of the research on bismuth oxide has focused on the stoichiometric Bi2O3 phase, and very few reports are available on non-stoichiometric Bi2O2.33 and Bi2O2.75 phases.206–208 It was reported that constructing a heterojunction between a tetragonal stoichiometric phase (β-Bi2O3) and non-stoichiometric phase (Bi2O2.33) shows promise in the degradation of phenol and MO dye under visible/solar-light irradiation.206 A one-dimensional Bi2O3-Bi2O2.33 heterojunction was prepared by calcining a mixture of Bi2O2CO3–Bi(OHC2O4)·2H2O and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor at 350 °C for 3 h in air with various molar ratios (20:1, 20:2, 20:3 and 20:4) of Bi(OHC2O4)·2H2O to Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, respectively. The SEM results showed that the heterojunction photocatalyst obtained at 20:2 was composed of ultrathin Bi2O2.33 nanosheets radially attached over β-Bi2O3 nanorods. The VB and CB positions revealed the formation of a type-II heterojunction, which provides a direct pathway for the transportation of charge carriers. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the Bi2O3–Bi2O2.33 heterojunction compared to bare β-Bi2O3 was due to its enhanced surface area and the efficient and directional separation and transportation of holes and electrons resulting from its morphology. The XPS spectra of Bi2O2.33 revealed the presence of two additional small peaks at 156.69 eV and 161.97 eV, which are ascribed to the presence of Bi-metal. We think that the appearance of metal Bi is due to the interaction of the unburned carbon with Bi2O3. However, besides good justification of heterojunction formation, no discussion on the surface and unburned carbon obtained by the calcining precursor was presented in the article. As discussed above, the calcination of the hydrocarbon-based Bi precursor does not remove all the carbon from nanostructured materials. Therefore, the β-Bi2O3 obtained by calcining Bi(OHC2O4)·2H2O exhibited a dark colour owing to the presence of unburned carbon. However, the addition of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O resulted in a light colour of Bi2O2.33 due to the interaction of C to form a mixture of Bi3+ and Bi2+, i.e. Bi2O2.33. In addition, the presence of carbon in a photocatalyst material promotes the transportation of charge carriers, and a more detailed investigation about the interaction of carbon with the phase junction is required when preparing heterojunctions via the calcination route.
Generally, Bi2O3 possesses a small surface area of less than 5 m2 g−1. It is well-known that an improved surface area can impart a substantial and positive impact on the photoactivity of Bi2O3 photocatalysts. Besides, regardless of the low bandgap energy and high visible-light response of β-Bi2O3, β-Bi2O3 exhibits poor photoactivity for the degradation of pollutants owing to the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, it is observed that the restriction of charge carrier recombination sometimes has a greater impact on the photocatalytic performances than that of high surface area in Bi2O3-based photocatalysts. The development of a heterojunction in β-Bi2O3 with other suitable polymorphs can restrict the rapid electron–hole recombination rate, resulting in an increase in photocatalytic performance. For example, an α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst was produced via a solvothermal-calcination method for the degradation of the endocrine-disrupting compound EE2 under visible-light irradiation.138 The Bi(NO3)3·5H2O precursor was treated at 180 °C in the presence of ethylene glycol and aniline. The obtained product after drying was calcined at 300 °C to give the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst. In contrast, phase-pure β-Bi2O3 and α-Bi2O3 were produced by calcining the same hydrothermal product at 250 °C and 400 °C for 1.5 h and 1 h, respectively. The phase transformation analysis revealed that only the relatively low amount of 17.4% α-Bi2O3 was obtained in the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst. The BET studies showed an almost double active surface area for β-Bi2O3 (8.64 m2 g−1) than that of the α-/β-Bi2O3 (4.45 m2 g−1) heterojunction photocatalyst. In addition, a lower bandgap energy of 2.31 eV was observed in β-Bi2O3 compared to 2.57 eV for the α-/β-Bi2O3 mixture. However, despite its higher surface area and lower bandgap energy, β-Bi2O3 showed poorer photocatalytic activity for the degradation of EE2 than that of the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst. The small amount (17.4%) of α-Bi2O3 in the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction significantly inhibited the charge carrier recombination rate and resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, as discussed above, β-Bi2O3 could easily form Bi2O2CO3 under a CO2-rich environment. Conversely, the cycling experiments showed the high stability of the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction. We believe that the presence of the α-Bi2O3 phase induced high stability in β-Bi2O3 in this heterojunction.
The recycling stability and photoactivity of Bi2O3 phase heterojunction photocatalysts sometimes depend on the photocatalysis environment and in situ surface modification. The appearance of a new material after the transformation of Bi2O3 strongly influences the photocatalytic mechanism of heterojunction photocatalysts. For example, the degradation of RhB dye was examined using the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction in the presence of HCl at a solution pH of 3.139 The addition of Cl− ions causes modification of the surface of Bi2O3 induced by the formation of BiOCl due to the transformation of α-Bi2O3 into β-Bi2O3, Bi2O2CO3, and BiOCl during the photocatalysis process. The α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst was produced via a one-pot hydrothermal treatment method at 100 °C to 220 °C. The increase in temperature accelerated the number of nanoparticle collisions and eventually resulted in agglomeration of the particles with a large crystallite size. The obtained product at 190 °C possessed a type-I heterojunction with enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB (Fig. 19a). The β and α phases of Bi2O3 were produced by further annealing the obtained heterojunction photocatalyst powder at 300 °C and 400 °C, respectively. The recycling experiment showed the stable photocatalytic activity of the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst even after five runs (Fig. 19b). The XRD pattern of the recycled heterojunction photocatalyst revealed the presence of α-Bi2O3, β-Bi2O3, Bi2O2CO3, and BiOCl (Fig. 19d). However, after five runs, the stable photocatalytic activity was suggested to be due to the in situ transformation of α-Bi2O3 into β-Bi2O3 through the BiOCl intermediate (Fig. 19c). Besides, the type-I semiconductor heterojunction of α-/β-Bi2O3 was changed into type-II β-Bi2O3/BiOCl heterojunction owing to the in situ generation of BiOCl. In the latter study, the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst was synthesized using the same procedure but with varying molar concentrations of precursor, and a highly solar light-active α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst was obtained at 180 °C.209 The degradation of RhB dye was employed to examine the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction photocatalyst in the presence of various salts, i.e., NO3−, CH3COO−, SO4− and Cl−. The as-obtained degradation intermediate of RhB by the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst was identified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HR-MS). The highly active α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst exhibited superior photoactivity at pH 4 than its counterparts. Nevertheless, the addition of Cl− or NO3− increased the photodegradation rate by 9.0% and 12.1%, respectively, owing to their strong adsorption on the surface of α-/β-Bi2O3. In contrast, the addition of CH3COO− or SO4− suppressed the photoactivity in comparison to without the addition of inorganic salts. The HR-MS and HPLC characterization results displayed the presence of N-deethylated products owing to photosensitization phenomena during the degradation of RhB. These non-toxic products, i.e., phthalic acid, adipic acid, 2,5-dihydroxyl benzoic acid, and 2-hydroxyl penta-di-ioic acid were further mineralized into H2O and CO2 under solar light irradiation. As discussed above, the separation efficiency of charge carriers and the morphology matrix play a vital role in improving the photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3 phase junction photocatalysts. For example, the in situ phase transformation technique produced an α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst.210 The controlled transformation of the β phase into α-Bi2O3 under mild operating conditions revealed the generation of α-Bi2O3 nanoparticles over β-Bi2O3 nanosheets. The obtained heterojunction photocatalyst demonstrated a high photodegrading rate of RhB dye under visible-light irradiation. The smaller particle size of α-Bi2O3 in the heterojunction helped increase the lifetime of charge carriers compared to that in the pristine α-Bi2O3. The DRS spectra revealed the high visible-light absorption and enhanced photocatalytic performance of the heterojunction than a physical mixture of individual components. In addition, the suitable alignment of the band position acts as a driving force for the enhanced photoactivity of the α-/β-Bi2O3 heterojunction.

In addition to heterojunctions, some studies revealed the enhanced photoactivity in Bi2O3 phase homojunctions. It is important to note that homojunction photocatalysts are formed when semiconductor interfaces incorporate with comparable chemical compositions and bandgap energies, which may be distinct in the phase or dimension of the crystal. To explain to readers a clear concept of the differences between a heterojunction and homojunction in Bi2O3, a concise comparison is essential to discuss. Generally, it is believed that homojunction photocatalysts are derived from a single precursor that gives rise to two phases or components with different properties but better interfacial contact. Conversely, heterojunction-based photocatalysts are prepared using a co-mixture of dissimilar precursors through an exogeneous procedure.211 However, some reports on the synthesis of Bi2O3 phase heterojunctions reported the use of a single precursor,138,205,206 which negates the myth of homojunction synthesis through a single precursor. Therefore it can be concluded that the homojunction is usually formed between two materials having smooth and well-aligned continuity in band bonding with no distortion or mismatches in the lattice. However, if a large difference in the Fermi level, atomic thermal expansivity, and lattice structure constant exist between materials, it will give rise to a heterojunction photocatalyst. Nevertheless, due to the design, structure and intrinsic properties of homojunction photocatalysts, they exhibit effective charge transfer with hindered charge carriers recombination.212 On the contrary, due to their distorted lattice structure, phase separation usually occurs in heterojunction photocatalysts. Despite the large bandgap energy of UV-light-active α and γ-Bi2O3, the homojunction in α-/γ-Bi2O3 not only induces more visible-light absorption but also enhances the carrier separation and transportation, which are highly desirable in the photocatalytic process. For example, a homojunction-based α-/γ-Bi2O3 photocatalyst was prepared through hydrothermal treatment for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation.77 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in Na2SO4 solution and NaOH was used to adjust the solution pH to 4, 8, 10 and 11. The obtained mixtures were hydrothermally heated in the temperature range of 100 °C to 160 °C. α-Bi2O3 was favourably obtained after 9 h with a solution pH of 11 at 100 °C. By increasing the temperature to 160 °C at the same pH, the α-/γ-Bi2O3 composite was obtained after 9 h. The complete phase transformation after 22 h resulted in the formation of pure γ-Bi2O3. The effect of various parameters, i.e., the molar ratio of Bi(NO3)3 to Na2SO4, pH value, hydrothermal treatment temperature and time on the photocatalytic activity of the α-/γ-Bi2O3 homojunction was investigated. Compared with bare α-Bi2O3 and γ-Bi2O3, the α-/γ-Bi2O3 exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity owing to its narrower bandgap energy of 2.5 eV compared to 2.8 eV for α- and γ-Bi2O3. The SEM image revealed that the α-/γ-Bi2O3 homojunction is composed of nanoplate-like α-Bi2O3 and aggregated particle-like γ-Bi2O3. The apparent lower VB and CB potential of γ-Bi2O3 than that of α-Bi2O3 results in the formation of a homojunction between them. The recycling experiments illustrated the stable photoactivity of the homojunction even though partial transformation of the α phase to the γ phase was observed. Nevertheless, no information about the phase ratio in the homojunction photocatalyst was provided. However, we think that the partial transformation of α-Bi2O3 into γ-Bi2O3 may be due to the long-time interaction of α-Bi2O3 with the cationic RhB dye. Furthermore, we think that although α-Bi2O3 is reported to be a stable phase, the complete and slow transformation of α-Bi2O3 into γ-Bi2O3 in a basic environment shows that more research is required on the time-dependent transformation of α-Bi2O3 to γ-Bi2O3 at a lower temperature. Similarly, the improved light response of α-Bi2O3 was explored by developing an α-/β-Bi2O3 homojunction to investigate the interfacial properties by density functional theory calculations.88 Due to the unstable interface obtained by lattice mismatch in the Bi2O3 heterojunction, the dissimilar alignments of the α- and β-Bi2O3 surfaces were used to obtain a stable interface, i.e. selection of a suitable combination of α- and β-Bi2O3 crystal planes, matching of anions and cations and reducing the interfacial stress by maintaining the orientation of the bonds. The results revealed that the homojunction interface consisted of the {101} plane of α-Bi2O3 and {001} plane of β-Bi2O3 with a slight lattice mismatch of less than 5%, which could create a stable interface. Compared to α-Bi2O3, the energy band of β-Bi2O3 was downshifted, resulting in a type-II staggered gap homojunction. Furthermore, the construction of a homojunction revealed an increase in visible-light absorption of α-Bi2O3 and β-Bi2O3. In heterojunction photocatalysts, the electron flows from a high region Fermi energy level to a low energy level, and an equal potential is achieved at the junction. A space charge layer is formed, which is attributed to the migration of photoinduced charge carriers, and effective segregation and transportation of charge carriers are achieved due to the intense internal electric field ascribed to the large Fermi level difference between the two materials. However, many extra considerations are needed given the setbacks in heterojunctions, such as difference in lattice structure constant and atomic thermal expansivity. Nevertheless, these drawbacks may induce interfacial distortion in the lattice, which may cause phase separation during the recycling of Bi2O3 photocatalysts and promote rejoining of electron–hole pairs.211 Conversely, these drawbacks can be avoided in homojunctions due to the absence of lattice mismatch between both materials, resulting in high charge transfer and low electron–hole recombination rate.
Besides a phase junction between various Bi2O3 polymorphs, the construction of type-II, Z-scheme, and S-scheme hybrids between Bi2O3 and Bi-based compounds having matching energy band positions is recognized as a promising technique. Bi2O2CO3 belongs to the Aurivillius family and consists of alternating CO32− and orthogonal (Bi2O2)2+ layers, which are highly beneficial for charge separation during the photocatalytic process. The calcination of Bi2O2CO3 can result in the generation of Bi2O3; therefore, close contact is evident in the obtained Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterojunction photocatalyst. Nevertheless, Bi2O2CO3 is a UV-light-active photocatalyst, while Bi2O3 exhibits visible-light absorption abilities. Therefore, a heterojunction between them is of great interest in investigating the photocatalytic mechanism under UV- and visible-light irradiation and making full use of the solar spectrum. For example, the construction of β-Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3 was reported by Lu et al.213 Firstly, they prepared Bi2O2CO3 through the hydrothermal treatment of bismuth citrate (BiC6H5O7) at 180 °C followed by calcination at 350 °C for 2 h under an N2 atmosphere and proposed the role of surface oxygen vacancies on the photocatalytic removal of NO through a synergistic effect. It is important to note that most of the reports on the synthesis of Bi2O2CO3 required an additional precursor, which could provide CO32− in the system. This often requires more synthesis steps and is complex to achieve. For instance, Xu et al. constructed a Bi2O2CO3/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst through the hydrothermal treatment method via anion exchange by using graphitic carbon nitride as the CO32− precursor.214 Moreover, the use of an ionic liquid as the carbon element source for the preparation of Bi2O2CO3 was also reported.215 The obtained product was calcined at 300 °C, 320 °C, and 330 °C to obtain a Bi2O2CO3/β-Bi2O3 mixture. However, further calcining to 350 °C resulted in the formation of pure β-Bi2O3 at 350 °C.
The formation of an internal electric field and promoting the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be beneficial for the synthesis of active heterojunction photocatalysts. Therefore, the construction of an n–p heterojunction between n-type Bi2O3 and p-type Bi2S3 proved to be a helpful strategy. Bi2S3 belongs to the V–VI metal sulfide family and possesses a well-matched band potential with Bi2O3. There are many reports on the synthesis of Bi2O3/Bi2S3 heterojunction photocatalysts. For instance, Yan et al. reported the synthesis of a core–shell β-Bi2O3/Bi2S3 photocatalyst via an anion exchange strategy.216 They used thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) as a sulfur source, and the obtained heterojunction with 10 mol% of Bi2S3 in the β-Bi2O3/Bi2S3 mixture exhibited efficient photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB dye under visible light irradiation. Similarly, Sang et al. developed a nanoflower-like cubic-Bi2O3/Bi2S3 heterojunction photocatalyst for the degradation of RhB and reduction of Cr(VI) under visible-light irradiation.217 Recently, Chang et al. reported the room-temperature synthesis of a Bi2S3–Bi2O3 composite using vulcanization reaction or in situ sulfurization process.218 They dispersed commercial α-Bi2O3 in carbon disulfide (CS2) solution under continuous stirring for some time, and Bi2S3–Bi2O3 powder was collected after natural evaporation. The low or room temperature synthesis of the Bi2S3–Bi2O3 composite makes it a competitive material for environmental remediation. However, most of the reports used commercial Bi2O3 for the synthesis of Bi2S3–Bi2O3 given that Bi2O3 is hard to obtain under low-temperature conditions. Therefore, the development of a low/room temperature method for the synthesis of Bi2S3–Bi2O3 composites using cheap Bi-based precursors can be a future prospect.
In addition, the development of an interface between Bi2O3 and other Bi-based materials using Z-scheme Bi2O3/Bi2MoO6,219 BiOCl/Bi2O3,220 Bi@β-Bi2O3/g-C3N4,221 and p–n-type Bi2O3/BiFeO3222 heterojunctions was also reported. The obtained interfaces provided high utilization efficiency with greater charge carrier separation and light-harvesting capabilities, making them an active photocatalyst for full spectrum solar-light irradiation.
6. Summary and outlook
Herein, we reviewed the primitive and advanced approaches in Bi2O3 polymorphism for photocatalytic applications with special focus on the crystal structure, synthetic techniques, phase transformation, morphology, surface activity relationship, and phase junction in various Bi2O3 polymorphs. All the data was critically analyzed, and unaddressed issues were discussed in detail. Moreover, the gap in the existing literature was highlighted, and a possible solution was proposed. Thus, here, the conclusions and prospects of this review are presented.
• Among the Bi2O3 phases, the synthesis and photocatalytic properties of the α and β phase were reported most and the metastable β and γ phase exhibit enhanced photoactivity than that of their counterparts.
• It is generally assumed that the phase transformation in Bi2O3 is purely temperature dependent. However, it was noticed that other factors, i.e., synthesis time, type of additive or surfactant used, and synthetic method, also induce a phase transformation in Bi2O3. For example, the synthesis of metastable β-Bi2O3 was reported at 40 °C62 and 1000 °C,64 while the phase transformation into α-Bi2O3 and γ-Bi2O3 was reported in the wide temperature range of 120 °C to 697 °C. Therefore, more studies are still needed to understand the complex phase transformation phenomena.
• Most of the Bi2O3 synthesis processes followed low temperature or hydrothermal synthesis routes to obtain phase-pure Bi2O3 polymorphs. However, these processes were not proven successful all the time in obtaining a highly crystalline Bi2O3 phase. Therefore, other synthetic methods, i.e., microwave-assisted method, solid-state grinding method, and sonochemical precipitation method, also need to be explored.
• Bi2O3 is considered to be unstable in CO2-containing solution and is usually converted to Bi2O2CO3 and (BiO)4(OH)2CO3 in the photocatalytic environment. Therefore, more attention to the synthesis of stable Bi2O3 is required.
• Few reports are available on the low-temperature synthesis of Bi2O3 phases, suggesting that there is still room to synthesize Bi2O3 phases at low temperature through liquid-phase precipitation or solid grinding methods.
• Calcination is a common purification technique and is used as the final step in the synthesis of Bi2O3. However, calcination induces organic impurities such as carbon in the synthetic process. Nevertheless, the presence of carbon may not only reduce the Bi2O3 phase into metallic Bi with the SPR effect but also increase the charge transfer rate. Unfortunately, most researchers considerably neglected the carbon generated during the synthetic process. Thus, the effect of calcining impurities needs to explore more and can be a future direction.
•Some reports reported the photoactivity of Bi2O3 on a fixed immobilized photocatalyst support, which exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performances than that of conventional powder-based systems. The performance of the photocatalytic system can be enhanced by coupling with other technical systems, i.e., sono-photocatalytic, photoelectron-catalytic, persulfate, and photothermal-catalytic systems.
• In most studies, the performance of Bi2O3 was evaluated against artificial wastewater and degradation under lamp-based UV- or visible-light irradiation. However, the scope of the photocatalytic system needs to be explored for real situations. Also, no study on a pilot-scale or large-scale photocatalytic system was reported to the best of our knowledge. The efficacy of the system needs to be realized using a scaled-up photoreactor.
• In some cases, the photocatalyst powder agglomerated or stuck to the walls of the quartz reactor during the photocatalytic process. Thereby, the real performance of the photocatalytic system could not be evaluated. Thus, the evaluation of photocatalysts on an improved mixing system needs to be explored to fix this problem.
• In the conventional photocatalytic system, most of the research was performed using a lab-scale quartz tube or beaker-based photoreactor system in which a light source is placed next to the contaminated water while water is used to cool the system. Thus, the effect of reactor design on photocatalytic performance can be a future direction.
• There is considerable room to improve the performance of γ- and δ-Bi2O3. Most of the research was focused on the synthesis and structural modification of α- and β-Bi2O3. Thus, further study on γ- and δ-Bi2O3 can provide a more futuristic approach through practical prospects.
• The use of surfactants or additives shows promise in developing highly active Bi2O3 photocatalysts. Besides, the use of organic solvents often provides a template for the Bi2O3 structure. However, the use of these chemicals adds additional cost to the system and is energy wasteful. Therefore, the development of a highly active photocatalyst without using a surface-directing agent or expensive solvents is required.
• In addition to stoichiometric Bi2O3, non-stoichiometric Bi2O2.33, Bi2O4, and Bi2O2.75 phases exhibit good photocatalytic properties. Thus, more attention to the synthesis of non-stoichiometric Bi2O3 can provide more opportunities in novel photocatalyst design.
• The development of homojunctions between Bi2O3 phases revealed good scope for the degradation of pollutants by phase junctions. However, more research is still needed to understand the phenomena of phase junctions in the various Bi2O3 polymorphs.
• During photocatalytic operation, the generation of electrons and holes leads to the photocatalyst being in the excited state. However, due to the energy barrier reduction, the nature of the excited state under light irradiation remains baffling. Therefore, the understanding of the dynamics of excited electrons is necessary to comprehend the photocatalytic process.
Overall, the polymorphism in Bi2O3 for photocatalytic applications is still in its infancy. We strongly believe that considerable experimental and theoretical efforts are required to find stable, highly photoactive, and commercial photocatalysts. Also, the phases of Bi2O3 are undeniably emerging as environmental purification materials. We honestly hope that this review article provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the fundamental and advanced research on Bi2O3 for practical applications.
