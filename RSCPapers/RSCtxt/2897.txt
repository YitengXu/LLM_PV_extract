    , Accepted 9th September 2022First published on 11th September 2022AbstractZinc ion thermoelectrochemical cells (ZTECs) have emerged as one of the attractive candidates for low-grade heat harvesting and energy storage but are greatly limited by the lack of promising cathode materials with superior rate capability and good durability. Here, we propose a facile strategy for the microstructural engineering of hydrate vanadium oxide by a surfactant to overcome such barriers. Impressively, a large Seebeck coefficient of 6.4 mV K−1, remarkable thermal-induced power density of 1.8 W m−2, and high durability were achieved by optimizing the cathode together with superior energy storage behaviors. Besides, one solid-state ZTEC could achieve a high output voltage of ∼0.83 V and power density of 0.2 W m−2 with an ultralow temperature difference of 5 K. All the findings demonstrate the promising potential of microstructural engineering for electrode materials in the construction of high-performance thermoelectrochemical devices.
Introduction
Low-grade heat (<100 °C) as one of the high entropy energies is distributed ubiquitously in the environment and daily life in the form of solar heat, geothermal energy, industrial waste heat, heat dissipated by electronics, and body heat.1–6 However, the high value-added utilization of such low-grade heat is still plagued because of the lack of promising energy conversion and storage devices under a small temperature gradient between the hot and cold sides.2,7 Different from the low Seebeck coefficient of traditional electronic thermoelectric devices (e-TEs) and relatively complex integration of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), liquid thermocells (LTCs) hold great promise for low-grade heat conversion due to their unique merits such as cost-effectiveness, good flexibility, high Seebeck coefficients, and power density.8,9 Inspired by heat-to-current mechanisms, two kinds of LTCs based on the electric double layer capacitive processes and pseudocapacitive reactions have attracted much attention in realizing the high value-added conversion of low-grade heat.10–18 Notably, the output voltage and the conversion efficiency of the reported LTCs are still low, which could mainly be determined by their near-surface energy conversion procedures. Thus, it is required to develop and construct a new-type ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) device with fast heat/electricity response to keep pace with the demand of Internet of Things.19,20
Alternatively, hybrid ion systems are expected to achieve both high energy density and power density due to the reasonable integration of batteries and capacitors. In particular, nowadays, zinc-based devices have been regarded as one of the potential candidates for scalable energy storage, which can be attributed to the low redox potential (−0.76 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g−1/5855 mA h cm−3), and satisfying water media compatibility of the Zn metal.21–24 When combining the concept of Zn-related devices and heat-to-current conversion, a new-type i-TE proposed by our research group, namely, zinc ion thermal charging cell or thermoelectrochemical cell (ZTEC), can convert low-grade heat into electricity through the synchronous thermodiffusion and thermo-extraction/insertion of electrolyte ions in the battery-type cathode and stripping/plating behavior of the Zn anode.25 Recently, vanadium oxides have been considered promising candidates for Zn2+ storage due to their open framework or layered crystal structure and multiple oxidation states.26–28 Similar to many other electrode materials for energy storage, vanadium oxides with dense structures always suffer from poor ion diffusibility and sluggish kinetics, leading to strain-induced microstructure failure and unsatisfying durability during repeated Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in crystal lattices (as illustrated in Fig. 1a). In previous studies, great efforts have been devoted to solving this problem, including the microstructural engineering of the cathode material and introduction of intercalated guests into the interlayers.29,30 For instance, Wang et al. have designed a hierarchically porous zinc vanadium oxide nanoflower as a cathode for a Zn ion battery. Both high specific capacity and excellent cyclic stability could be delivered.29 As shown in Fig. 1b, the hierarchical porous structure constructed by nanosheets not only provides a large electrochemically active surface for ion storage but also forms abundant cross-layer channels to relieve the as-generated strain. Based on such structural merits, vanadium oxides can achieve superfast Zn2+ diffusion or satisfying kinetics as well as long-term durability.29 According to the relationship between Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ), and thermal conductivity (κ) for thermoelectric materials (ZT = S2σT/κ), the thermoelectrochemical performances were highly determined by the S value for a specific candidate.5,6,9 Therefore, the development of cathode materials with a hierarchically porous microstructure beyond electrolyte optimization, as one of the efficient strategies to improve their bulk kinetics, can reasonably result in an enhanced S value as well as boosted thermoelectrochemical performances.

Herein, we developed and prepared hydrate vanadium pentoxide with hierarchical microflower structure (VOMF) engineered using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) to improve the intercalation/deintercalation kinetics of ions for high-performance ZTECs. As expected, the large active area and the hierarchical microstructure enhance the interface contact of electrode/electrolyte and shorten the diffusion pathway of electrolyte ions, leading to high power density. The cross-layer channels formed by nanosheets could alleviate strains during the intercalation/deintercalation of charge carriers, resulting in long-term durability. Consequently, the VOMF cathode exhibits a remarkable Seebeck coefficient of 6.4 mV K−1, good power density, and durability under a temperature difference of 40 K. Moreover, the proposed solid-state ZTEC with VOMF cathode, Zn anode, and gel electrolyte demonstrated ultrafast response between low-grate heat and electricity, suggesting the promising potential of electrode materials with structural engineering in energy-related applications.
Results and discussion
Microstructural engineering for vanadium pentoxide
The VOMF can be prepared by a facile solvothermal method using ammonium metavanadate, oxalic acid dihydrate, and CTAB as the vanadium source, complexing agent, and surfactant, respectively. As observed by field-emission scanning microscopy (SEM), the VOMF presented a uniform spherical microstructure (Fig. 2a) self-assembled by vanadium pentoxide nanosheets. The thickness of this nanosheet is about 20 nm (Fig. 2b). As a sharp contrast, the vanadium pentoxide with microsphere structure (VOMS) sample without adding CTAB showed a relatively dense surface (Fig. S1†). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms shown in Fig. S2† further indicate the higher specific surface area of VOMF (∼23 m2 g−1) than that of VOMS (∼8 m2 g−1), confirming the effect of the surfactant on structural engineering. From the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image shown in Fig. 2c, the interplanar spacing of ∼0.86 nm could be indexed to the (001) plane of the V2O5·0.5H2O (PDF#40-1297). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping images indicate that oxygen and vanadium elements are distributed evenly in the as-formed VOMF (Fig. 2d). We recorded X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns to confirm the detailed structure of samples. The VOMF presented several visible diffraction peaks (Fig. 2e), which could be well indexed with the V2O5·0.5H2O (PDF#40-1297), V2O5·1.6H2O (PDF#40-1296), and V2O5 (PDF#89-0612).31 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) further showed that the VOMF contains 0.46 crystal H2O molecules per V2O5 unit (Fig. 2f). According to these results, the crystal structure of bi-layered V2O5·nH2O can be optimized with a large interlayer spacing of ∼8.75 Å (inset in Fig. 2f), in which the lattice water layer evidently exists between the layers of V2O5. In the Raman spectrum (Fig. 2g), the as-detected bands at 143, 198, 286, 406, 526, 698, 880, and 996 cm−1 correspond to the characteristic modes of V2O5.32 Typically, the peak at 143 cm−1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the V–O lattice. The peaks at 198, 286, and 406 cm−1 are assigned to the bending vibration of VO bonds. The peak located at 526 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching mode of V3–O (triply coordinated O). The peak at 698 cm−1 represents the stretching vibration of V2–O (corner-sharing VO5 polyhedra bridged O). The peak at 880 cm−1 is due to the stretching vibration of V–OH2. Besides, the stretching of V2–O (doubly coordinated O) also appears at 996 cm−1. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of V 2p is shown in Fig. 2g. Notably, vanadium in the VOMF is in the oxidation state of V5+.33 Considering the structural information mentioned above, the VOMF is expected to be one of the promising candidates for energy conversion and storage due to its hierarchical microstructure, large-layer spacing, and high electrochemically active area.

Thermoelectrochemical performances of ZTECs
To evaluate the heat-to-current performances of VOMF and VOMS in low-grade heat harvesting, aqueous ZTECs are typically tried using non-isothermal H-type cells. Before the experimental tests, both VOMF and VOMS cathodes were pre-intercalated by ions using the galvanostatic discharge method with a current density of 0.1 A g−1 until the voltage of the cell was 0.2 V. Then, the cathode part was heated to set temperatures while the Zn anode part was maintained at room temperature to generate various stable temperature differences (ΔT) from 5 to 40 K. Because of the different textural properties of VOMF and VOMS, significant differences exhibit in the thermal-electrical response during measurements. Fig. 3a profiles the evolving relationship between the output voltage and temperature difference of the VOMF and VOMS based ZTECs. With the increase in ΔT, the corresponding output voltages of both ZTECs gradually improved along with thermal charging for 40 min. Notably, the VOMF shows a more vertically increasing slope for voltage than that of the VOMS during each ΔT state, which indicates the attractive response capability to charge carrier ions of the VOMF. Owing to the electrochemically self-charging behavior of Zn-based devices, almost 0.3 V could be obtained by as-proposed ZTECs during this process (Fig. S3†), which enables such high output voltages. After excluding the self-charging contribution, relatively high thermal-induced voltages of 0.58 V and 0.44 V could be obtained by VOMF and VOMS-based ZTECs, respectively. Similar to typical thermoelectrics, the thermopower or Seebeck coefficient (S) of ions can be defined by the following equation:8 (1)

(c) Current densities and power densities under various output voltages. (d) Comparison of key parameters with other reported thermoelectrical systems. (e) The charge behaviors on loading a resistance of 20 kΩ. 
As summarized in Fig. 3b, the VOMF-based ZTEC shows a slightly large Seebeck coefficient of 6.4 mV K−1 together with a high output voltage at each temperature difference. These significant differences between the S values for both ZTECs are mainly attributed to the differences in the electrode structures, electrochemically active surfaces, and kinetics behaviors. In order to study the thermoelectric performance during heat-to-current conversion, we discussed the discharge performances of the as-constructed ZTECs upon loading various resistances under a ΔT of 40 K. As shown in Fig. 3c, a high output voltage (0.65 V) and current density (2.2 A m−2) can be reached by the VOMF-based ZTEC, which is higher than that of VOMS-based ZTEC (0.55 V and 2.0 A m−2). Moreover, the thermally induced power density (P) under different load resistances is calculated and recorded, as shown in Fig. 3c. According to the equation P = V2/R, the power density obtained by the VOMF-based ZTEC is 1.8 W m−2, suggesting a high Pmax/(A × ΔT2) value of 1.13 mW m−2 K−2. Simultaneously, this value is much better than that of 1.2 W m−2 (0.75 mW m−2 K−2) achieved from the VOMS-based ZTEC. Remarkably, the output voltage, S value, and the normalized power density based on the thermoelectrochemical process of the VOMF-based ZTEC demonstrate high competitively among the previously reported devices for the conversion of low-grade heat (Fig. 3d).7,8,17,34–37 As displayed in Fig. 3e, the total output voltage of the VOMF-based ZTEC can reach ∼1.0 V during the thermal charging-process at 40 K. When discharging with a resistance load (20 kΩ) and thermal charging over 20000 s (100 cycles), a high voltage of 0.89 V (89% of initial voltage) can still be maintained, indicating good thermal charging stability of the VOMF-based ZTEC. In contrast, the VOMS-based ZTEC is tested under the same conditions with the VOMF, and its stability is relatively poor. In detail, the output voltage is ∼0.79 V after thermal charging. Unfortunately, a dramatic decrease in the voltage over 13 cycles led to a unsatisfying thermoelectrical behavior, which was mainly caused by the energy/kinetics mismatch during thermal charging and load-discharging processes of the VOMS-based ZTEC. These obvious differences in the electrochemical performances of both vanadium oxide are highly dominated by the accessible electrolyte/electrode interface and hierarchical microstructure of structural engineering electrodes. In addition, the binder-free electrode was rationally employed to study the influence between structural engineering and performance. Thus, a self-standing carbon cloth (CC) was used as a functional substrate to prepare the VOMF@CC electrode. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the VOMF is uniformly distributed on the CC surface with cross-linked nanosheets. The XRD pattern further proves the successful preparation of the VOMF@CC (Fig. S4b†). After thermoelectrochemical tests, a high output voltage of 0.87 V (thermal-induced voltage of 0.52 V) and comparable Seebeck coefficient of 7.1 mV K−1 were achieved for the VOMF@CC-based ZTEC at a relatively low-temperature difference of 30 K (Fig. S4c and d).† These results directly indicate that structural engineering can greatly enhance the kinetics of electrodes and reduce the response time from heat to electricity.
Mechanism analyses of as-proposed ZTECs

Ex situ XRD tests were performed to investigate the structural evolution of the VOMF electrodes during the thermoelectrochemical processes. Fig. 4a shows the recorded XRD patterns of selected VOMF electrodes from 5 K to 40 K. Comparing with the initial state, new peaks located at 17°, 18.8°, 19.5°, and 29.7° emerged after Zn2+ intercalation at 0.2 V and gradually reduced during the thermoextraction procedures from 5 K to 40 K, corresponding well to the characteristics of Zn4(OTf)4(OH)4·3H2O.29,38–40 Notably, peaks matching the Zn4(OTf)4(OH)4·3H2O clusters disappear with the increase in the temperature difference to 40 K. Moreover, the (001) plane of V2O5·0.5H2O and (011) plane of V2O5 shift to a low angle region with the insertion of charge carriers, which is mainly caused by the co-intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ in the V2O5·nH2O lattices. Such planes gradually shift to relatively high-angle regions with the deintercalation of ions from 5 K to 40 K, indicating that the microstructure of VOMF is highly stable for the intercalation/deintercalation of ions. Therefore, the possible mechanism of the VOMF-based ZTEC can be summarized as below:29,40 Cathode: V2O5·0.5H2O + xZn2+ + 4H+ + yH2O + (4 + 2x)e− ↔ H4ZnxV2O5·(0.5 + y)H2O(2) 4H2O ↔ 4H+ + 4OH−(3) 2Zn2+ + 2Zn(OTf)2 + 4OH− + 3H2O ↔ Zn4(OTf)4(OH)4·3H2O(4) Anode: (2 + x)Zn ↔ (2 + x)Zn2+ + (4 + 2x)e−(5) Overall: V2O5·0.5H2O + 2Zn(OTf)2 + (3 + y)H2O + (2 + x)Zn ↔ H4ZnxV2O5·(0.5 + y)H2O + Zn4(OTf)4(OH)4·3H2O(6)

To well understand the contribution of redox reactions and ion diffusion during the heat-to-current process, we carried out a series of Seebeck coefficient measurements according to S = Std(electrolyte) + Std(electrode) + αZn/Zn2+ + αHZnVO/VO using the three-electrode configuration developed in previous reports.7,17 As found in Fig. S5,† the thermodiffusion of the bulk electrolyte can deliver a temperature coefficient of 0.66 mV K−1. It is worth mentioning that the temperature coefficient for Zn/Zn2+ is 0.91 mV K−1. Moreover, the reversible reaction between H4ZnxV2O5·(0.5 + y)H2O and V2O5·0.5H2O holds a relatively high value of 5.43 mV K−1. Under this case, the relative contribution to the whole Seebeck coefficient can be divided as follows: 12.8% and 76.5% of electronic Seebeck coefficient for Zn/Zn2+ and HZnVO/VO, 9.3% and 1.4% of thermodiffusion contribution for bulk electrolyte and ions in the VOMF electrode, respectively (Fig. 4b).
The kinetics of the VOMF cathode was investigated by electrochemical measurements including the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). To avoid the impact of Zn4(OTf)4(OH)4·3H2O cluster on the intercalation and deintercalation of Zn2+ in V2O5·0.5H2O, we set a stable operating voltage window from 0.4 V to 1.6 V. As shown in Fig. 4c, two observed redox peaks at ∼1.2 V and ∼0.8 V in all the CV curves from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1 correspond to multiple steps of V2O5 during reduction (Zn2+ ion insertion) and oxidation (Zn2+ ion extraction).41 Generally, the surface-induced process and diffusion-controlled contribution can be confirmed according to the relationship between peak current (i, mA) and scan rate (v, mV s−1), which can be described as below:42 i = avb(7)where a and b are adjustable parameters. Briefly, for the reaction totally controlled by diffusion, b = 0.5, while for the capacitance-governed procedure, b = 1.0. For the VOMF electrode, the as-calculated b value for peaks 1 and 2 are 0.84 and 0.88, respectively (Fig. 4d). Therefore, the electrochemical behavior of the VOMF is dominated by the surface-induced capacitive process together with partial diffusion contribution. Moreover, the capacity detailly distinguishes capacitance (k1v) and ion intercalation contribution (k2v1/2) from the equation, i = icap + idiff = k1v + k2v1/2.40 The contribution ratio of the capacitance gradually increased with the rise of the scan rate from 0.1 mV s−1 to 1.0 mV s−1. A relatively high capacitance ratio of 92% could be achieved at a high rate of 1.0 mV s−1 due to the fast charge transfer kinetics (Fig. 4e). Zn2+ diffusion coefficient determined by GITT was used to further demonstrate the structural advantages of the VOMF in zinc-related devices. The GITT curves at charge and discharge are profiled in Fig. 4f. Accordingly, the Zn2+ diffusion coefficient (DZn2+) is calculated using the following equation:43 (8)where τ, nm, Vm, and S are the relaxation time, the molar amount of active substrate, the molar volume of the active materials, and the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte. ΔEs and ΔEτ represent the steady-state voltage change and overall voltage change after the application of a current pulse during the one-step GITT test, respectively. Notably, the DZn2+ is in a range of 10−10 to 10−11 cm2 s−1 (Fig. 4g), suggesting a high (de)intercalation of Zn2+ in the VOMF cathode. When comparing with the DZn2+ value from the discharge part, the slightly lower value during the charging process reveals its slower extraction kinetics than the corresponding intercalation during the whole electrochemical procedure. Under this case, relatively high energy input is required to realize the extraction of zinc ions from the VOMF, which implies its high-energy conversion efficiency during low-grade heat harvesting. Moreover, the stable DZn2+ value under various charging/discharging states further indicates the superior structure stability of the as-obtained VOMF cathode. To understand the significant role of crystal water in the enhancement of kinetics, we annealed the as-obtained VOMF at 400 °C in air to prepare the VOMF-400 without crystal water. As identified from XRD patterns, shown in Fig. S6a,† the V2O5·0.5H2O crystals in VOMF are thoroughly converted into pure V2O5 (PDF#89-0612), suggesting the efficient removal of the crystal water. Moreover, the DZn2+ of VOMF-400 is in a relatively low level from 10−11 to 10−16, which is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the VOMF (Fig. S6b and c†), demonstrating the significant role of crystal water in the enhancement of kinetics. All the above-mentioned results indicate that the structural engineering of hydrated vanadium oxide can reasonably enhance the kinetics behavior as well as thermoelectrochemical properties.
The energy storage performances of the cathode were further evaluated using zinc ion batteries using VOMF as the electrode. As recorded in the GCD curves from 0.1 A g−1 to 20 A g−1, the VOMF-based zinc ion battery displayed high reversibility and rate capability (Fig. S7a†). The corresponding discharge capacities are 493.9, 443, 371.6, 312.7, 274.8, 220, 173.4, 128.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, a high discharge capacity of 452.9 mA h g−1 can be retained when the current density recovered back to 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S7b†), suggesting good reversibility and durability for repeated intercalation and deintercalation of ions. Besides, the long-term cyclic stability of the VOMF cathode was tested with a current density of 10 A g−1 over 10000 cycles. As plotted in Fig. S7c,† a high-capacity retention of 81.5% together with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼100% was obtained, indicating the satisfying durability of the VOMF electrode. It is worth mentioning that the initial increase in the specific capacity till about 1000 cycles is likely caused by the activation of the cathode.
The reaction mechanism between electrolyte ions and VOMF electrodes during power charge/discharge was further studied by experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. Fig. 5a shows the GCD curves under a current density of 0.2 A g−1, in which various charging/discharging states are selected for further characterizations. As profiled in Fig. 5b, the ex situ XRD patterns directly confirm the highly reversible intercalation of zinc ions in V2O5 layers. In detail, the characteristic peaks at ∼43.7° and ∼50.8° appearing in each pattern can be well indexed to the stainless steel (SS) substrate. The peaks centered at ∼11.4°, 23.9°, 29.1°, 34.5°, and 47.7° can be assigned to the (001), (003), (004), (011), and (600) planes, respectively, of V2O5·nH2O. Notably, the (001) plane gradually shifts to a high-angle region due to the reduction of the interlayer spacing during the charging procedure from the state I to state III. Whereas the enlarged interlayer spacing indicates the reversible intercalation of ions into V2O5 lattice during the discharging process from state III to state V. Besides, the graphite-modified Zn anode (Zn-G) prepared using the previously reported method showed the byproduct-free feature during charge/discharge as confirmed from the corresponding XRD patterns (Fig. 5c).33 It needs to be pointed out that the visible peak at ∼26.3° belongs to the (002) plane of graphite, demonstrating the successful coating of graphite on the Zn surface. The ex situ XPS analyses of VOMF cathodes at the fully charged (state III) and discharged (state V) states were carried out to verify the mechanism. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the V 2p can be deconvoluted into V4+ (2p3/2: 516.9 eV) and V5+ (2p3/2: 518.0 eV) (Fig. 5d).44 It is worth mentioning that the V4+ component is dominant during the fully discharged state, suggesting the intercalation of Zn2+ in the interlayers of V2O5. Moreover, the V 2p spectrum recovers to a V5+-dominated state together with a weak V4+ signal at a fully charged state. The existence of V4+ in the V2O5 framework is caused by the partial reduction between the residual Zn2+ and V2O5 interlayers. From the spectra of O 1s (Fig. 5e), two fitted peaks correspond to H2O (532.5 eV) and VOx (530.5 eV).45 Clearly, the content of H2O is dramatically increased from state III to state V, which is mainly due to the solvation effect along with Zn2+ intercalation.43 Besides, the significant difference in the Zn 2p between state III and state V well confirms the ion intercalation process during charging and discharging (Fig. 5f). The appearance of weak Zn signals during a fully charging state can be attributed to the residual zinc species, which is in line with the analysis of the V 2p spectrum.

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to study the migration barriers and adsorption energies of zinc ions in the V2O5 and V2O5·0.5H2O structures. After optimizing the structure of V2O5 and V2O5·0.5H2O with the intercalation of a single Zn atom, it was found that the adsorption energy of V2O5·0.5H2O (−1.4 eV) is much lower than that of V2O5 (−0.6 eV), implying that the structure of V2O5·nH2O is more liable to adsorb Zn2+. From the distribution of the electron density differences (Fig. S8a† and 5g), the V2O5·0.5H2O structure is more localized than the V2O5 to adsorb Zn. Visually, the surrounding charge depletion around the Zn atom and the excessive charge accumulation of nearby V and O atoms reflect that the electronegativity of V2O5·0.5H2O or the adsorption ability to Zn2+ has been enhanced. Further, the performances of V2O5·0.5H2O can be efficiently improved due to the existence of crystal H2O in lattices. Moreover, the diffusion pathway and energy landscape of Zn2+ on the surface of samples are depicted in Fig. S8b† and 5h. It should be noted that the energy barrier for V2O5·0.5H2O at the lowest site is 0.21 eV, which is lower than that for V2O5 (0.31 eV) (Fig. 5i). It is well known that the ion diffusion constant can be estimated by the formula: D ∼ exp(−Ea/kBT), where T is the temperature, KB is the Boltzmann constant, and Ea is the diffusion barrier.46,47 Accordingly, a fast Zn2+ diffusion can be achieved for V2O5·nH2O, thanks to its relatively low energy barrier, which is also consistent with the above-discussed GITT results.
Construction of solid-state ZTECs
To keep pace with the requirements of modern electronics, a functional gel electrolyte was employed to decrease the volume/weight of ZTECs and improve their safety and flexibility. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the VOMF-based solid-state ZTEC was constructed using a Zn-G anode, VOMF cathode, and PAM-PAA/Zn(OTf)2 organohydrogel electrolyte. Notably, a resistive heater (12 V, 7 W) attached to the cathode part was employed as a heat source to generate the temperature gradient. The thermally charging behavior of the VOMF-based solid-state ZTEC at various temperature differences from 0.5 K to 5.0 K is shown in Fig. 6b. A high output voltage of ∼0.83 V could be achieved at a temperature difference of 5.0 K, suggesting the ultrafast thermal-electrical response of the VOMF-based solid-state ZTEC. Moreover, the thermal-induced voltage values can be normalized as 152, 191, 226, 249, 265, 278, 288, and 295 mV at the temperature differences of 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3.2, 3.9, and 5.0 K, respectively. Consequently, a series of superior Seebeck coefficients ranging from 104.7 mV K−1 to 28.7 mV K−1 can be obtained from the electrochemical desorption process to the following redox reactions (Fig. 6c). When comparing the heat-to-current performance of typical aqueous ZTECs, the solid-state ZTECs require smaller heat input to achieve the approximative output voltage. This interesting phenomenon could have been mainly induced by the distance between the anode and cathode. In the VOMF-based solid-state ZTEC, the prepared gel separator is only ∼1 mm in thickness, which is much lower than that of an H-type cell (100 mm). Most importantly, a thermal-induced power density of 0.2 W m−2 can be fitted by a VOMF-based device with various load resistors from 1 kΩ to 80 kΩ (Fig. 6d). Besides, Fig. 6e records the repeated cycling tests of the VOMF-based ZTEC under thermal charging (5.0 K) and load discharging (20 kΩ). It is worth mentioning that the output voltage shows a stable trend even after 60 hybrid charging–discharging cycles, indicating the satisfying thermal stability of the solid-state ZTEC. Most importantly, such ZTEC could be further charged to 1.6 V by extra power input with a current of 0.2 mA (inset in Fig. 6e). Inspired by the above findings, only a single VOMF-based ZTEC after a hybrid charging process can power a smart timer (Fig. 6f), demonstrating the advantages of the as-constructed solid-state ZTECs in device integration among other thermoelectrical devices such as TEs and some LTCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the significant effect of structural engineering for cathode materials in harvesting low-grade heat. Briefly, the microstructure of hydrate vanadium pentoxide can be facilely adjusted by the introduction of the surfactant. Benefitting from the structural advantages of the as-prepared VOMF, including the hierarchical structure, large active area, and cross-layer channel, the kinetics and thermoelectrochemical performances of the VOMF-based ZTEC are greatly boosted. As a result, a high thermal-induced output voltage of ∼0.6 V, large Seebeck coefficient of 6.4 mV K−1, and impressive power density of 1.8 W m−2 could be achieved with a temperature difference of 40 K. Moreover, the structural evolution of vanadium oxides during the thermoelectrochemical processes was confirmed through ex situ experimental measurements, and DFT calculations further elucidated the possible energy conversion mechanisms. This study indicates that microstructural engineering is a convenient strategy beyond electrolyte optimization for the construction of high-performance thermoelectrochemical devices.
Experimental section
Preparation of hydrated vanadium pentoxides
The VOMF was synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Typically, 0.702 g of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3), 1.89 g of oxalic acid dihydrate (C2H2O4·2H2O), and 0.25 g of CTAB were dissolved into a mixed solvent of ethylene glycol (45 mL) and deionized water (15 mL). After stirring for about 30 min, the mixture was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. Then, the VOMF was obtained by washing with ethanol and deionized water and drying at 80 °C for 12 h. In addition, the VOMS was synthesized by the same procedure as-described above for comparison only without the addition of CTAB.
Material characterizations
The microstructure and morphology of the as-obtained materials were studied by FESEM (Hitachi S-4800) and HRTEM (JEOL JEM-2100). The XRD measurements were performed on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectroscopy of the sample was performed on a Horiba Scientific LabRAM HR system. The XPS was performed on a KRATOS AXIS SUPRA instrument. TGA studies were performed on a Mettler-Toledo STARe SW 15.00 analyzer. The specific surface area of the samples was determined using the ASAP 2460 analyzer (Micromeritics).
Electrochemical measurements
All the thermoelectrochemical performances were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760e, Biologic VMP-300) and Land Battery Test System (CT3001A) using VOMF or VOMS as the cathode, Zn-G as the anode, and Zn(OTf)2 aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The Zn-G anode was modified using the pencil drawing method.33 The cathode was prepared by coating a slurry containing VOMF or VOMS powder, acetylene black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7:2:1 on graphite paper. Notably, the mass loading of active materials in the as-formed cathode was about 1.5 mg cm−2. For ZTEC measurements, a non-isothermal H-type cell was constructed using the cathode and anode as the hot side and cold side, respectively. In addition, the temperature difference between both the chambers was adjusted using a constant temperature water bath. On the other hand, CR2016 coin-type cells were assembled to evaluate the energy storage performances of zinc ion batteries.
Construction of solid-state ZTECs
The solid-state ZTEC was constructed using VOMF, Zn-G foil, and PAM-PAA/Zn(OTf)2 as the cathode, anode, and gel electrolyte, respectively. To keep pace with long-term testing, the device was further wrapped in an aluminum plastic film with a visible size of 5 cm × 3 cm. Moreover, the PAM-PAA/Zn(OTf)2 gel was synthesized by a UV-assisted polymerization process. Briefly, 1.82 g of Zn(OTf)2 was dissolved into a 10 mL mixed solvent consisting of distilled water and glycerol in a ratio of 1:2 (v/v). Next, 0.4 g of acrylic acid, 2 g of acrylamide, 1.5 mg of N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, 10 μL of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, and 0.25 g of potassium persulfate were dispersed into the above solution in portions under continuous stirring for 4 h at ∼0 °C. After injecting such an even solution into a homemade mold and polymerizing with a UV lamp (365 nm, 60 W) for 20 min, the transparent gel electrolyte was formed.
