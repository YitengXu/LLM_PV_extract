    , Accepted 15th May 2019First published on 16th May 2019AbstractThe latent heat storage of PCMs has gained increasing attention in the solar energy application field due to their high thermal energy storage density. However, the lack of energy conversion ability of the organic PCMs results in the low utilization efficiency of solar energy. Herein, we report a novel PEG/Ti3C2Tx layered composite PCM with superior photothermal storage capability, which consists of stacked Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and PEG filled within the spaces between the flakes. The resulting composites exhibited a strong absorption capacity for electromagnetic waves at the UV-Vis-NIR region. Notably, there are two enhanced absorption bands at the visible and near-infrared regions due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, which endows the composite PCM with excellent photo-to-thermal storage efficiencies (up to 94.5%) under actual solar light irradiation. In addition, the composite PCM also possesses a high energy storage density and form-stable property before and after the phase transition. These results indicate that the synthesized composite presents superior comprehensive properties suitable for solar energy storage applications.
Introduction
The growing energy demand has forced people to seek renewable energy. Solar energy is one of the most promising sources of renewable energy. However, the premise of its large-scale application is to develop appropriate storage technologies. Among them, the application of phase change materials for solar thermal energy storage is one of the potential technologies.1,2 Phase change materials (PCMs), as latent heat storage materials, can store a considerable amount of heat with very little temperature drift.3–6 In particular, organic solid–liquid phase change materials, one of the types of PCMs, have received more attention because of their suitable phase transition temperature and high thermal energy storage density. However, there are still a number of challenges for the practical applications of organic solid–liquid PCMs, including low thermal conductivity, leakage behavior in the operating process, and lack of energy conversion ability.7–9 An efficient solar thermal conversion ability, enhanced thermal conductivity and appropriate encapsulation structures without compromising latent heat, are the most important factors for improving the performance of the PCMs in the solar energy utilization field.10 In this respect, many researchers have investigated the form-stable PCMs with photothermal conversion and thermal energy storage ability by using graphite foam,11 carbon nanotube sponge,12 graphene aerogel,13–15 reduced graphene oxide,16 porous carbon,17 polydopamine@BN,18 or their hybrids19,20 as supporting and photothermal conversion materials. These form-stable materials exhibited outstanding photothermal conversion performance and latent heat storage ability, which promotes their thermal application in the solar energy utilization field.
Compared with the above carbon materials, MXenes are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides with the general formula of Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal, X represents carbon and/or nitrogen, Tx is the surface functional group (e.g., OH, O, and/or F groups), and n = 1, 2, or 3. Since MXenes were discovered in 2011, researchers have reported the potential use of MXenes for electrode materials of supercapacitors and fuel cells as well as catalysis and energy storage applications.21–24 The 2D material MXene has many merits, such as an easy preparation process,22 strong loading capacity,21 high thermal conductivity,25 and high electrical conductivity.26 Ti3C2Tx, a material from the MXene family, exhibited a record-breaking electromagnetic interference shielding effect in addition to the above-mentioned merits, which is due to the strong electromagnetic wave absorption capacity of the Ti3C2Tx film.27 Furthermore, it has been recently reported that the pristine Ti3C2Tx has a perfect energy conversion ability (internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of up to 100%).28 Typically, traditional 2D materials, such as GO, rGO, GNs, and BN, exhibit only a broad absorption band ranging from the UV to NIR regions.18,29,30 In contrast, the MXenes exhibit two enhanced absorption peaks in the visible and near-infrared regions. This interesting phenomenon in the MXenes is due to the LSPR effect, similar to metal nanoparticles, which results in a light absorption enhancement.31,32 Therefore, employing Ti3C2Tx in the PCMs-based energy storage systems will be very valuable for improving the solar energy utilization.
In this work, we report a novel PEG/Ti3C2Tx-layered composite PCM with superior photothermal storage capability, which was based on the incorporation of PEG into the lamellar spacing of the ultrathin Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. In addition to the high heat storage density and enhanced thermal conductivity, the composite has two enhanced absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared regions due to the LSPR effect of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. Hence, it can perform a rapid sunlight-harvesting and photothermal conversion in the UV-Vis-NIR regions (Fig. 1). Their photothermal storage efficiencies are up to 94.5% under the actual sunlight irradiation, which are higher than that (54–91.9%) of other light-driven form-stable PCMs. Therefore, this novel photothermal storage composite PCM will be a promising candidate for improving the practical solar energy utilization.

Experimental
Materials
Ti3AlC2 was supplied by the Kaixi Ceramic Material Company in the Shandong Province. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was bought from the Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory in Tianjin. A 40 wt% HF aqueous solution was provided by the Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin. Polyethylene glycol 6000 was supplied by Aladdin. Graphene (aqueous dispersion) was provided by the New Materials and Industrial Technology Research Institute in Beijing.
Preparation of the few-layered Ti3C2Tx
The few-layered Ti3C2Tx was produced by the selective etching of the Al element layers and delamination. In a typical preparation process, 3 g of Ti3AlC2 was immersed in 24 mL of hydrofluoric acid solution (40 wt%) for 3 d at room temperature. Subsequently, the resulting multi-layered Ti3C2Tx powder was centrifuged and washed with water until the pH of the supernatant was above 7. The powder was then dried at 50 °C for 24 h. After that, the powder was mixed with 40 mL of DMSO. After the mixture was stirred for 18 h, the powder intercalated by DMSO was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was then dispersed into water with the weight ratio of 1:200 and sonicated with a sonic probe for 5 h (Ultrasonic frequency: 20 kHz, Power: 600 W). The obtained few-layered Ti3C2Tx was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol several times. Lastly, the few-layered Ti3C2Tx was redispersed uniformly in water.
Preparation of PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites
The PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite PCMs were prepared by mixing Ti3C2Tx solution with PEG6000. Typically, a certain amount of PEG was added into the Ti3C2Tx aqueous solution, followed by ultrasonic processing for 1 h. The dispersion was then dried under vacuum (0.05 Mpa) to obtain the composites with different PEG content.
Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and elemental analysis results were obtained by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, SU 8220) with an EDX system. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was acquired on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 microscope at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were performed on a Japan Rigaku SmartLab 9KW X-ray powder diffractometer. Raman spectra were obtained with a DXR Microscope from 3500–100 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a TA Instruments TGA Q500 V20.13 Build 39 with a heating range from room temperature to 700 °C and a N2 flow rate of 50 mL min−1. The thermal properties of the PCM were characterized using a TA Instruments DSC Q20 V24.11 Build 124 and all DSC measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 5 °C to 80 °C at the heating/cooling rate of 5 °C min−1 and the N2 flow rate of 50 mL min−1. Digital photos were taken with a Nikon digital camera. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the composites were measured using a Hitachi U-4100 Spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded by an ESCALAB250 multifunction surface analysis system using Al Kα radiation. The thermal conductivities of the composites were measured using a DRL-III tester (Xiangyi Instrument, China). The test was conducted via the transient plane source (TPS) method and the composites were pressed into pieces (thickness: 0.5 cm, diameter: 2.5 cm) in the test process.
The solar-to-thermal conversion and energy storage test of the composite PCMs was performed by a light-thermal conversion system, which included the light source [simulated light source (CHF-XM-500 W, Beijing Chang Tuo Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China)], a light-thermal conversion device consisting of a foam insulation system and the composite (ground into small particles) in a sample bottle (diameter, 2.5 cm), and a temperature recorder (RS-232-RS-485, Instrument Co., Ltd., Jiangsu Suke, China).
Results and discussion
Characterization of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets
The Ti3C2Tx nanosheets were synthesized via selective etching and a delamination process. The Al layers were etched by 40% HF and removed from the MAX phase Ti3AlC2 (Fig. 2a and b). The HF-etched Ti3C2Tx showed an accordion-like and multi-layer morphology as seen from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 3a and S1a†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3b–d) and SEM (Fig. S1b†) analyses showed that the morphology of the exfoliated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets was a typical single-layer or few-layers with dimensions of 0.5–2.2 μm. Furthermore, the single layers at about 7–8 Å thick were also imaged using TEM, indicating that the as-synthesized Ti3C2Tx was indeed two-dimensional. The (008) lattice fringes image of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets was also observed in Fig. 3f, and the spacing between the two adjacent planes in the same direction was 0.24 nm.

The XRD patterns of the materials after treatment by HF showed that most of the non-basal plane peaks of Ti3AlC2, including the most intense peak (2θ ≈ 39°), disappeared. This indicated the formation of the accordion-like MXene Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 3g). However, the (00l) peaks, such as the (002), (004), and (008), still existed, illustrating that the HF-etched Ti3C2Tx and exfoliated Ti3C2Tx sheets remained highly ordered in the c direction. In addition, the (00l) peaks of the HF-etched Ti3C2Tx broadened, lost intensity, and shifted to lower angles in comparison with the MAX phase Ti3AlC2. After delamination, the peak (002) of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets further shifted to a much lower angle than that of the HF-etched Ti3C2Tx in the XRD pattern.21 Also, the notable (110) peak of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets is no longer observed, reconfirming the order in non-basal directions being greatly reduced after delamination.25 The full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of peak (008) from the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets at 2θ ≈ 37.2° is 1.332°, which suggested that the d-spacing is 0.24 nm, which was confirmed by the HRTEM analysis result. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the chemical compositions of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2Tx. The inset in Fig. S2a† presents the absence of the Al 2p peak in the XPS spectrum of Ti3C2Tx, indicating that the Al layers completely disappeared after reacting with HF. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ti3C2Tx in the Ti 2p region showed that two characteristic peaks appeared at 455.0 eV and 461.0 eV, which are ascribed to Ti–C (2p3) and Ti–O (2p3), respectively (Fig. S2b†).
Characterization of the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite PCMs
The composite fabrication process simply involved ultrasonic-assisted mixing and a rough vacuum drying, as shown in Fig. 2c and e, and the self-supporting, disc-shaped samples were finally obtained (Fig. S3†). The resulting composite consists of stacked Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and PEG filled within the spaces between the flakes during drying. A cross-sectional SEM image of the rough vacuum-dried Ti3C2Tx sample indicated that the MXene Ti3C2Tx restacked upon each other and assembled into a MXene film with a layered structure (Fig. 4a). When PEG was introduced into the system, the layered structure was still intact and the interlayer space was filled by PEG as well. Fig. 4b and c show that the composite had a clearly layered structure, and the inset in Fig. 4b showed the uniform distribution of the Ti element in the composite. In addition, the cross-sectional TEM image in the normal direction of Fig. 4c showed a uniform thin film, which also indicated the layered structure of the composite (Fig. S4†). The yellow arrows in Fig. 4d point out the PEG layers of variable thickness and the uniform Ti3C2Tx layers with a thickness of 7–8 Å. Fig. 4e shows the XRD patterns of the PEG, Ti3C2Tx and PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite. Notable and intense peaks in the XRD curve of the composite appeared at 19.23° and 23.42°, which are assigned to the crystalline state of PEG. This result confirms that the PEG between the supporting material is present in the crystalline state. The height of the characteristic peaks of the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite is a little lower than that of pure PEG, which probably resulted from the confinement effect of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets on the PEG crystallization. In addition, the (002) peak shifted to lower angles from 9.2° to 7.1° as the PEG content increased from 30 wt% to 90 wt% and the d-spacing increased from 9.6 to 12.5 Å, indicating that the distance between the Ti3C2Tx increased (Fig. S5†). The peaks in the c direction and the (110) peak at 2θ ≈ 61° were also observed in the XRD pattern of the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite, which is probably because the order of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets in the non-basal directions reappeared.

(c), (d) TEM longitudinal section images of the PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx composite (ultrathin section). (e), (f) XRD patterns and Raman spectra of PEG6000, Ti3C2Tx flakes, and the PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx composite, respectively. 
The structures of the materials were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4f. In the Raman spectrum of Ti3C2Tx, the peaks observed at 211 cm−1 and 728 cm−1 are assigned to the A1g modes of Ti3C2O2. Additionally, other peaks observed in the Raman spectra are assigned to the following vibrational modes: (i) Eg of Ti3C2F2 at 127 cm−1, (ii) Eg of Ti3C2(OH)2 at 278 cm−1, (iii) Eg of Ti3C2F2 at 618 cm−1. The analysis results indicated the presence of –OH, –O, and –F functional groups on the surfaces of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets.33 Moreover, the peak at 211 cm−1 ascribed to the A1g mode of Ti3C2O2 and the peak at 2890 cm−1 attributed to the CH2 group of PEG both appeared in the Raman spectrum of the composite, which confirmed that the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and PEG were completely compounded.
The form-stable property is a very essential aspect for the application of a phase change material. For comparison, the control group sample was prepared by the milling-mixing method. The pure PEG, control group and the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites with different Ti3C2Tx contents were placed briefly in an oven of constant temperature (35 °C, 65 °C, and 95 °C), and then remained for 20 minutes as the changes in the samples were observed via tracking photography using a digital camera. As shown in Fig. 5, all samples retained their original shape at 35 °C. When the temperature of the oven was increased to 65 °C, partial melting occurred for the pure PEG and the control group. In comparison, the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites remained form-stable from a macroscopic perspective. As the temperature reached 95 °C, the pure PEG and the control group melted completely, whereas the PEG(90%)/Ti3C2Tx started to undergo a slight leakage. However, the PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx and PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx composites maintained their original shapes without any leakage. The good form-stable property of the composites is attributed to the existence of the supporting material Ti3C2Tx layers. The capillary action of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets and the surface tension forces existing in the composites restricted the flow of the interlayer melted PEG. Futhermore, considering the surface functional groups (–OH, –O, and –F) of Ti3C2Tx, there may be strong intermolecular forces between the two. As shown in Fig. S6,† the O–H peak at 3436 cm−1 of PEG from the composite shifted toward lower wavenumbers in comparison with the 3461 cm−1 of pure PEG due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between PEG and MXene. Therefore, the composites exhibited good form-stable properties, thereby extending their application in the solar energy utilization fields.

The phase change behavior of the composite was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fig. 6a showed the DSC curves of the pure PEG and the composite PCMs with PEG loading at 80% and 85%. The phase change enthalpies and temperatures were summarized based on the DSC curves of three tests (Fig. S7†) for each sample (Table 1). In comparison, the composites have a melting temperature in the range of 61.3 to 62.1 °C, which is closely consistent with that of the pure PEG used here. The result reflected that the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets had no effect on the phase change temperature of PEG. Without the presence of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, the melting enthalpy and freezing enthalpy (ΔHm and ΔHf) of the pure PEG were 217.4 J g−1 and 208.7 J g−1, respectively. As the Ti3C2Tx nanosheet content increased, the phase change enthalpies of the composites became lower. This is partially attributed to a certain weight fraction of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets contained in the composites. As shown in Fig. 6b, the actual melting and freezing enthalpies of the composites are slightly lower than the theoretical melting and freezing enthalpies. The crystallinity was calculated using the equation:34  where  is the theoretical ΔHm. The crystallinity of the pure PEG is 100%, and the crystallinities of PEG in the PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx and PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx composites are 90.8% and 92.8%, respectively. It is expected that the crystallinity decreases as the content of Ti3C2Tx increases. Considering the supporting role of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, they could possibly interfere with and restrict the crystallization and thermodynamic behavior of the surrounding PEG so that the crystallinity decreases and the actual phase change enthalpies reduces.35 Nevertheless, the melting enthalpy and freezing enthalpy are still high (more than 153 J g−1), which ensures a good performance of the synthesized composites in a practical application.

Photo-to-thermal conversion and thermal energy storage tests of the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite PCMs

Fig. 7a shows the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorbance spectra of the pure PEG, PEG(80%)/GNs and PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx composite. In contrast to the pure PEG, the PEG(80%)/GNs and PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx exhibited almost complete absorbance throughout the UV-Vis-NIR range. However, there is only a broad and slightly lower absorption band in the absorbance spectrum of the PEG(80%)/GNs (sample with same diameter and thickness). In contrast, there is an interesting observation in the UV-Vis-NIR spectrum of the composite. Two enhanced absorption peaks are observed at 610 nm and 1148 nm, which is a result of the LSPR effect strongly enhancing the light–matter interaction.36,37 Moreover, the distinct absorption characteristic of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets as the supporting material (Fig. S8†) can enable the composite to harvest the maximum light energy of the sun. This is due to the fact that the presence of the two strong absorption peaks of the composite are in the visible and near-infrared regions where most of the sunlight energy is distributed (consists of ∼5% UV, ∼43% visible, and ∼52% infrared).38 Thus, the prepared PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite showed excellent sunlight absorption capacity. Accordingly, the presence of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets can effectively absorb light, and in turn, heat the PEG in the composites.
 Fig. 7  (a) Absorbance spectra of PEG6000 (diameter: 2.5 cm thickness: 1.75 mm), PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx composite (diameter: 2.5 cm thickness: 1.25 mm) and PEG(80%)/GNs composite (diameter: 2.5 cm thickness: 1.25 mm). Temperature evolution curves of the samples under the (b) simulated and (c) actual sunlight irradiation (T = 32 °C, 13:15–14:11, July 30, 2018, Dalian, China) (m = 1.2 g). (d) The photothermal storage efficiencies of the composites under the simulated and actual sunlight irradiation. 

Fig. 7b presents the photo-to-thermal energy conversion and thermal energy storage curves of the composites under simulated light. Under the simulated sunlight irradiation with a power density of 128.6 mW cm−2, the temperature increased abruptly from 19 °C to more than 55 °C. As the radiation time increased, the inflection points in the temperature evolution curves of the composites occurred at a temperature range of 59 °C to 63 °C, which is consistent with the phase change temperature of the composites. This phenomenon indicated that the melting of the PEG occurred when the absorbed energy was converted into thermal energy and stored in the composites. When the simulated light was turned off, the temperatures of the composites dropped quickly to the freezing point (about 48 °C). These freezing platforms suggested that thermal energy was released during the cooling process. In contrast, no melting and freezing platforms were observed in the temperature evolution curve of the pure PEG because the highest temperature under light irradiation did not reach the phase change temperature. In the temperature evolution curve of the PEG(80%)/GNs composite, the rate of the temperature rise is obviously lower than that of the PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx composite at the same time period. These results confirm that the photothermal storage is enabled by an efficient heat transfer from the conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to the surrounding PEG throughout the composite, and the stored thermal energy can be released during the cooling process.
The photothermal storage efficiency (η) was calculated by the ratio of heat stored in the PEG and the applied light energy during the phase change process, according to the equation described by  where m and ΔH are respectively the weight and fusion enthalpy of the composite, and P is the power of the simulated solar irradiation. The starting and terminating points (tt and tf) of the phase change are obtained by the tangential method (inset of Fig. 7b). Thus, the photothermal storage efficiencies of PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx and PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx are 85.1% and 94.2%, respectively, which is higher than that of the PEG(80%)/GNs composite (70.3%) due to the enhanced absorption in the visible and infrared regions. Clearly, the photothermal storage efficiency increases as the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets content increases. This is probably because the increased content of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets elevated the heating rate, resulting in the shortening of the phase change period. Consequently, a reduction in the convection heat loss from the heated composite to the surrounding environment enhanced the photothermal storage efficiency.
Such excellent performance of the photothermal storage is also observed under solar light irradiation. Fig. 7c shows the photothermal storage curves of the composite PCMs with PEG loading at 80% and 85%. Interestingly, under the natural light irradiation, the composites exhibited a similar trend of rapid temperature rise with an increase in the exposure time, as seen in the case of the simulated solar irradiation. Moreover, the melting platform and freezing platform are also observed at 50.1–60 °C and 45–48 °C, respectively. Under sunlight irradiation with a power density of 66.5–71.3 mW cm−2, the photothermal storage efficiencies of PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx and PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx are 91.3% and 94.5%, respectively. Clearly, the photothermal storage efficiency under the actual sunlight irradiation is higher than that of the simulated sunlight irradiation, although the intensity of the light source decreased. This is probably because the spectral energy distribution of the actual sunlight matches more perfectly with the absorption spectrum of the composites in comparison with that of the simulated sunlight.39
The energy conversion materials as supporting material are shown in Table S1.† The comprehensive literature review of the previously studied light-driven form-stable PCMs showed that the photothermal conversion efficiencies of these form-stable PCMs are 54–79.9% when only one photothermal conversion material was used as the supporting material, such as graphite foam,10 carbon nanotube sponge,11 graphene aerogel,12,13 graphene foam,14 reduced graphene oxide,15 or polydopamine@BN.17 When using a mixture of the two, such as the mixture of BN and GNs18 or the hybrid aerogels of GO and GNs19 as supporting materials, the photothermal conversion efficiencies increase to 72.7–91.9%. In contrast, the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites in this work exhibited excellent photothermal efficiency (∼94.5%) when only using Ti3C2Tx as the supporting material. The excellent photothermal conversion efficiency is the result of the strong electromagnetic wave absorption ability of Ti3C2Tx. The PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites also have an additional advantage, i.e., easy processing. Therefore, these results indicate that the prepared composites are an outstanding photothermal conversion and storage material for the solar energy utilization field.
The thermal stability of the composites has been characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA tests programmed to 700 °C in an N2 atmosphere). All samples underwent a step degradation process ascribed for the degradation of the pure PEG chain (Fig. 8a and b). The degradation occurred in the temperature range of 324 °C to 439 °C, and the temperatures at which the PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx and PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx composites reached a 5 wt% mass loss are 361 °C and 359 °C, respectively. The finding indicates that Ti3C2Tx is an appropriate supporting material and the composites possess high thermal stabilities at the phase change temperature (62 °C). In addition, the presence of the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets enhanced the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs. As shown from the temperature–time curves of the PEG and PEG/Ti3C2Tx in Fig. S9,† the heating times of the samples from 18 °C to 70 °C were 342 s, 265 s and 145 s. The heating time decreased by 58% for PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx in comparison to the pure PEG. Similarly, the freezing time of the sample from 75 °C to 30 °C also decreased when the Ti3C2Tx nanosheet content was increased. The test result revealed that the pristine PEG had a lower thermal conductivity of 0.211 W m−1 K−1, whereas the thermal conductivities were 0.293 and 0.321 W m−1 K−1 for the PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx and PEG(80%)/Ti3C2Tx, respectively (Table S2†). Compared with PEG, the thermal conductivities of PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites were enhanced by 39% and 52%.

Additionally, the composites can be repeated for many cycles without degradation during the energy storage and releasing processes. As shown in Fig. S10a,† the curves of the first and 100th cycles nearly coincide in the photothermal storage cycling test under the same conditions. Such high reusability was also observed for the composites from the DSC curves under the same condition. Fig. S10b† shows the DSC curves of the PEG(85%)/Ti3C2Tx composite before and after the cycling test, in which the peaks corresponding to the PEG melting and freezing had a small shift after the cycling. Furthermore, when compared with the 173.7 J g−1 and 167.9 J g−1 values before the cycles, the melting and freezing enthalpies were 173.9 J g−1 and 167.7 J g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively. The unchanged heat storage capacity is important for the recycled use of the phase change materials. These results confirm that the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composites exhibit excellent reusability, which fulfils the performance requirement of the PCM composites for practical solar energy storage applications.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite PCM with photothermal conversion and storage ability has been constructed by ultrathin Ti3C2Tx nanosheets as the supporting material to encapsulate PEG. The resulting composite presents a strong UV-Vis-NIR absorbance characteristic, and an especially enhanced absorption in the visible and near infrared regions. Consequently, the composite has an outstanding photothermal storage efficiency of 94.5%. This result is meaningful for improving the energy utilization in the solar energy storage fields. In addition, the composite exhibited a high energy storage density and form-stable property. Our results thus demonstrated the great potential of the PEG/Ti3C2Tx composite PCMs as a novel photothermal storage material that can be used in the thermal application of solar energy.
