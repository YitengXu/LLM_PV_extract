    , Accepted 31st December 2019First published on 2nd January 2020AbstractFormate is a kind of carbon-neutral fuel that can be synthesized by electrochemical conversion of CO2, however, the generated aqueous formate electrolyte is still short of potential application. Here, formate solution is proposed to be utilized as anode fuels of direct formate fuel cells through the formate oxidation reaction (FOR), and graphene supported AgPd nanoalloys (AgPd/rGO) are prepared to catalyze the FOR. Specifically, the mass activity of the as-prepared Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is 4.21 A mg−1Pd and the retention activity of Ag49Pd51/rGO is 49.1% of initial activity after successive 500 cycles, which is 2.48 and 3.03 times higher than that of unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloys. When increasing the positive scan limit from 0.0 to 0.8 V, the mass activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 to 6.03 A mg−1Pd and Pd surface coverage increases from 51.87% to 62.42%, indicating the occurrence of surface reconstruction where Pd atoms migrate to the surface of AgPd nanoalloys, and less intensive reconstruction is observed in unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloys, whose mass activity increases from 1.35 to 2.49 A mg−1Pd. The driving force and kinetic path are calculated for the surface reconstruction induced by the adsorption of H, O and C atoms, in the case of C atoms on graphene, the segregation energy of surface Pd atoms in the AgPd nanoalloy is −1.16 eV, and the activation energy for the migration of subsurface Pd atoms to the surface is 0.54 eV, which are lower than the segregation (0.03 eV) and activation (2.06 eV) energy on a clean alloy surface.
Introduction
Converting CO2 into chemicals to store solar and wind energy is a promising strategy to mitigate global warming,1–3 and the conversion reaction through controlling conditions and catalysts can produce a wide variety of fuels,4–6 in which CO, formic acid and formate have been shown to yield sufficient Faraday efficiency.7,8 CO can be used as a raw material for syngas,9,10 and formic acid is economically viable to be produced due to its relatively high market price.11 In contrast, formate does not have sufficient and effective applications although many efforts have been made for its production.8,12 At present, formate is mainly applied as a deicing agent and its market potential is small.13 Separating solid formate from the generated aqueous electrolyte is not economically feasible since the process requires enormous energy, and the generated aqueous formate electrolyte lacks potential application.10 Fortunately, the emergence of direct formate fuel cells is expected to solve this problem, which can directly convert the chemical energy of formate into electrical energy in aqueous solution,14,15 with advantages of safety, easy operation, high power density and low cost.16,17
The utilization of aqueous formate solution is primarily carried out through the formate oxidation reaction (FOR) at the anode of direct formate fuel cells.18 Because of the intrinsically sluggish kinetics of the FOR,19–21 it requires the application of catalysts with high performance and low cost to facilitate the reaction, which attracted intensive efforts. For example, Wang et al.22 prepared Pd/C to catalyze the formate oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 577.78 mA mg−1Pd. Noborikawa et al.23 reported that PdCu/C can reach a peak current density of 3.461 mA cm−2, which is 1.8 times that of commercial Pd/C. Chowdhury et al.24 indicated that Pd4Ag/C can catalyze the oxidation of formate as an intermediate during the methanol oxidation reaction with a mass activity of 38.4 mA mg−1Pd. Han et al.25 reported that the PtAg nanoalloy shows a mass activity of 830 mA mg−1Pt in comparison with that of Pd black (606 mA mg−1Pd). Sankar et al.26 demonstrated that PdCo/C can generate a FOR activity of 2.7 A mg−1 in comparison with 1.5 A mg−1 for commercial Pd/C. However, previous experimental results have shown that the surface of nanoalloy catalysts would undergo significant modifications in its composition and chemical state in response to the reaction conditions,27,28 that is, surface reconstruction where the as-prepared catalyst surface can lose its pre-designed structure during reaction, thus making the catalyst design meaningless. How to understand and predict surface reconstruction of bimetallic catalysts during the reaction has become a fundamental problem.29
The surface reconstruction taking place during the reaction is usually driven by the interactions with the surrounding reactants/products under working conditions or by exposure to the external stimuli such as electric potential.30–32 For example, Tao et al.33 reported that the surface of the RhPd nanoalloy is rich in Rh under oxidation conditions while Pd segregates to the surface under reduction conditions due to the lower surface energy. McCrum et al.34 demonstrated that Pt nanoparticles are enclosed mainly by the (111) plane under vacuum, while the (100) and (110) planes grow when subjected to a potential in the electrolyte. Moreover, Kitchin et al.35 illustrated that, in the Ag3Pd nanoalloy, Ag segregates to the surface under vacuum, and Pd segregation becomes preferred with increasing the oxygen content. The surface reconstruction has previously been reported in FOR catalysts. Mao et al.36 demonstrated that the activity of the AuPdCu nanoalloy can be 3.29 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C after removing surface Cu and increasing surface oxides of Pd and Au. Wang et al.21 reported that electrochemical de-alloying can remove the surface Cu and increase Pd active sites on the surface of the AgPdCu aerogel, leading to a mass activity 3.9 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C. Wang et al.37 illustrated that the catalytic performance of AgPdPt aerogels increases with increasing the upper limit potential in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) test, and a peak mass current density of 2.94 A mg−1Pd+Pt is obtained at an upper limit potential of 1.3 V. Despite these higher FOR activities of the reconstructed surface, the understanding of how these surface nanostructures evolve during the catalytic process is still unclear, which hinders the rational design and utilization of FOR catalysts.
In this work, graphene supported AgPd nanoalloys (AgPd/rGO) are prepared by a one-pot microwave assisted synthesis method. Specifically, the mass activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is 6.38 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst, and Ag49Pd51/rGO shows a promising durability after successive 500 cycles, whose retention activity is 13.98 times higher than that of the Pd/C catalyst. Moreover, when increasing the positive scan limit during the FOR test, the mass activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 to 6.03 A mg−1Pd and Pd surface coverage increases from 51.87% to 62.42%, indicating a surface reconstruction, and less intensive reconstruction is observed in unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloys, whose mass activity increases from 1.35 to 2.49 A mg−1Pd. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that upon adsorption of H, O, and C atoms on the surface of AgPd nanoalloys, the segregation energy of one subsurface Pd atom to the surface is −0.26, −0.36 and −1.16 eV, and the activation energy for the migration of Pd atoms to the surface is 1.62, 1.39 and 0.54 eV, respectively, which are lower than the segregation (0.03 eV) and activation (2.06 eV) energy on a clean alloy surface and thus provide a driving force and a kinetics path for the observed surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the more obvious surface reconstruction of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst than the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy can be attributed to the stronger inducing effect of C than H and O atoms.
Experimental
Materials
Palladium(II) nitrate (Pd(NO3)2·2H2O, Shanghai Hushi Chemical Factory), silver nitrate (AgNO3, Shanghai Hushi Chemical Factory), an aqueous colloidal suspension of graphene Oxide (GO, Suzhou Tanfeng Graphene Tech. Inc.), trisodium citrate dehydrate (C6H5Na3O7·2H2O, Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd), potassium hydroxide (KOH, Guangdong Guanghua Sci-Tech Co., Ltd), potassium formate (HCOOK, Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute), Pd/C (10%, Aladdin), Nafion solution (5%, Dupont@), and ethanol (CH3CH2OH, Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd) were used.
Fabrication of AgPd nanoalloys
AgPd nanoalloys were synthesized by the microwave-assisted synthesis method. In a typical synthesis of Ag50Pd50, 5 mL of trisodium citrate (0.48 M), 21 mL precursor solution of silver nitrate (0.02 M) and palladium nitrate (0.02 M) were dropped into the mixed solution of 8.2 mL deionized water and 30 mL ethylene glycol under stirring. After sonication for 10 minutes, it was microwave heated at 800 W (heated for 30 s, then stirred for 5 s, and repeated 3 times). The Ag50Pd50 catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with deionized water, and freeze dried for 12 h. For comparison, Pd was prepared by the same method except that no silver nitrate was added into the metal precursor solution.
Fabrication of AgPd/rGO catalysts
AgPd/rGO catalysts were synthesized by a microwave-assisted synthesis method, which was optimized via adjusting the parameters (Fig. S1, S2 and S3, ESI†). In a typical synthesis of the Ag50Pd50/rGO catalyst, 21 mg GO was dispersed in a mixed solution of 20 mL deionized water and 30 mL ethylene glycol. After sonication for 30 minutes, the mixed solution was successively dropped with 5 mL of 0.48 M trisodium citrate, 4.2 mL precursor solution of silver nitrate (0.02 M) and palladium nitrate (0.02 M) under stirring. After stirring for 30 minutes, it was microwave heated at 800 W (heated for 30 s, then stirred for 5 s, and repeated 3 times). The Ag50Pd50/rGO catalyst was collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with deionized water, and freeze dried for 12 h. Ag/rGO, Pd/rGO and AgPd/rGO with other ratios were prepared by changing the molar fraction of silver nitrate and palladium nitrate in the precursor solution. For comparison, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared by the same method except that no metal precursor solution was added.
Physical characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα1 as the radiation source (λ = 0.15406 nm). The micromorphology and structure of the catalysts were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova 450 field-emission scanning electron microscope) equipped with X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Themis Z with two aberration correctors and FEI Talos FRG 200F) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HADDF STEM). The surface composition and electronic structures of the catalysts were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250) using a monochromatic Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultrahigh vacuum (10−9 Torr). The relative content of elements on the surface was calculated by integrating their corresponding peak in XPS spectra, and the position of d-band centers (εd) was calculated according to the following formula with the range from 0 to 9 eV: (1)where N(ε) is the density of states (DOS) in XPS valence band spectra, which are corrected with the Shirley background. The mass fraction of Ag and Pd in the prepared catalysts was measured using SEM-EDS and an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) as displayed in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†). The prepared AgPd/rGO catalysts with different Ag/Pd ratios and Ag50Pd50 nanoalloys were corrected as Ag77Pd23/rGO, Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag27Pd73/rGO and Ag51Pd49, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were conducted at room temperature using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660C, Shanghai Chenhua Apparatus, China) and a three electrode electrochemical cell. A glassy carbon electrode (5 mm in diameter) coated with catalysts was used as the working electrode, while a Pt wire electrode and an Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) electrode were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. In this work, unless indicated, all potentials were versus the Hg/HgO electrode.
To prepare the catalyst ink, 2 mg catalysts were dispersed in a mixture of 990 μL of ethanol and 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%) under ultrasonication for 30 min. And the glassy carbon electrode was dropped with 10 μL of prepared catalyst ink and dried under ambient conditions to obtain the working electrode after successively polishing with 1.0, 0.3 and 0.05 μm of alumina powder, cleaned with deionized water, and dried with N2. The electrolyte consisted of 1.0 M KOH or 1.0 M KOH + 1.0 M HCOOK solution was deaerated by purging with high purity N2 for 30 min before measurements, and this atmosphere was maintained by a flow of N2 over it during the entire measurement. For all the CV tests, the scan rate was set to 50 mV s−1 and the lower limit potential was set to −1.0 V, and for CA tests, the initial potential was set to −0.2 V.
ECSAs of the as-prepared catalysts were calculated by quantification of the electric charges associated with the reduction of PdO as shown in the following equation:38 (2)where Q is the charge for the reduction of PdO on the surface, which can be obtained by integrating the area of PdO reduction. m is the mass of Pd, and C is the charge required to reduce the monolayer of PdO (405 μC cm−2). ν is the scan rate (50 mV s−1 in this work).
DFT methods
According to the XRD patterns in Fig. 1, the (111) surface of the AgPd nanoparticles is chosen in our model and constructed by cutting the fcc structure of Pd along the [111] direction. The (111) surface of AgPd nanoparticles was modeled using a (2 × 2) supercell with a four-layer slab containing 4 atoms per layer and a 15 Å vacuum zone in the z direction. Ag and Pd atoms in the top two layers and the entire adsorbates were fully relaxed, while the bottom two layers were fixed at the bulk positions.

The vertical black and pink lines correspond to the standard diffraction patterns of face-centered cubic (fcc) Ag (#04-0783) and Pd (#46-1043), respectively, and indexes of peaks are indicated above the peaks. 
DFT calculations were carried out with the DMol3 package of Materials Studio. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function was used to study all of the properties at the DFT level. The orbital cutoff range was set to 5.0 Å, and the Fermi smearing was 0.005 Ha. Moreover, the DFT Semi-core Pseudo-potential core treatment and the double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set were chosen in this work. To obtain well-converged geometric structures, the value of Self-Consistent-Field (SCF) convergence was set within 10−6. Moreover, the values of energy, maximum force and the maximum displacement were set to 10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha Å−1 and 0.005 Å, respectively. A 5 × 5 × 1 grid was set to be accurate as well as computationally efficient to optimize the geometry of the model. The minimum energy pathways of HCOO− oxidation and surface reconstruction were determined by the complete LST/QST method with a RMS convergence of 0.002 Ha Å−1, which have been confirmed as a precise and quick tool to search for the transition state (TS).39 The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated with the following equation:40 Eads = Eadsorbate+surface − Eadsorbate − Esurface(3)where Eadsorbate+surface is the total energy of the adsorbates interacting with the AgPd slab, Eadsorbate is the energy of the adsorbates in the gas phase, and Esurface is the energy of the clean AgPd slab surface. The segregation energy of Pd atoms to the surface (EsegPd) was calculated by the following formula: EsegPd = EPd on surface − EPd in bulk(4)where EPd on surface and EPd in bulk are the total energy of the slab models with Pd on the surface and in the bulk, respectively.
Results and discussion
Microstructure of the as-prepared catalysts

Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared Ag/rGO, Ag77Pd23/rGO, Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag27Pd73/rGO, Pd/rGO and rGO catalysts. The four peaks indexed to (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes feature the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline structure of AgPd nanoparticles, and the peaks at approximately 24° to 26° are indexed to (002) planes of rGO. The (111) peaks of Ag77Pd23/rGO, Ag49Pd51/rGO and Ag27Pd73/rGO catalysts are located between the (111) peak of Ag/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts, and shift to a higher 2θ value with the increase of Pd content, demonstrating the formation of the AgPd alloy. Estimated with Scherrer's formula,41 the crystallite sizes of Ag/rGO, Ag77Pd23/rGO, Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag27Pd73/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts are 9.6, 3.2, 3.2, 3.5 and 3.4 nm, respectively. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of Ag49Pd51/rGO, bimetallic Ag51Pd49 and monometallic Pd catalysts. Ag49Pd51/rGO and Ag51Pd49 catalysts have four similar peaks indexed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes, which have a low angular shift in comparison with Pd, demonstrating the alloying of Ag with Pd in Ag51Pd49. Moreover, the crystallite sizes of Ag51Pd49 and Pd are estimated as 3.6 and 6.2 nm, respectively, which are larger than that of Ag49Pd51/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts, proving the effect of graphene as the support to make the AgPd nanoparticles finer.
The morphology of the as-prepared catalysts is tested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a, S5 and S6a (ESI†) show the SEM images of AgPd/rGO catalysts, which exhibit a typical 3D graphene framework morphology,42 where the active species can be provided with greater accessibility to the catalyst, facilitating efficient mass transfer of the reactants and products.43Fig. 2b shows the TEM image and particle size distribution of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst, it reveals that the AgPd nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on graphene with an average size of approximately 2.8 nm. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2c indicates that the d-spacing of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst corresponding to the (111) planes is 0.2336 nm, which is between the value of Ag (0.2359 nm) and Pd (0.2246 nm),44,45 indicating the Ag/Pd alloying, which is further confirmed by the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings and line scanning profile in Fig. 2d, since the distribution of Ag and Pd is very similar. According to Fig. S6c and S6d (ESI†), the morphology of the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy is porous, which has a relatively large specific surface area. Compared with rGO in Fig. S6e and S6f (ESI†), the morphology of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst in Fig. S6a, S6b and S7 (ESI†) appears to be rougher, demonstrating the effective loading of AgPd nanoparticles.

Effect of potential on electrocatalytic performance during formate oxidation

Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag51Pd49 and commercial Pd/C catalysts in N2-saturated 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte. The peak mass current density of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is 4.21 A mg−1Pd in the forward scan and 5.17 A mg−1Pd in the backward scan. Rather than poisoning of catalysts, the higher peak in the backward scan is believed to be due to the reduction of Pd oxide which produces a large amount of fresh Pd to catalyze the oxidation of formate.21 In the forward scan, the peak mass activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is 2.48 and 6.38 times higher than that of the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy (1.70 A mg−1Pd) and commercial Pd/C catalyst (0.66 A mg−1Pd), indicating that the introduction of graphene can improve the catalytic activity of the AgPd nanoalloy. Fig. 3b shows the peak mass activity of Pd/rGO and AgPd/rGO catalysts with different Ag/Pd ratios, the peak mass current density decreases in the sequence: Ag49Pd51/rGO (4.21 A mg−1Pd) > Ag27Pd73/rGO (3.14 A mg−1Pd) > Ag77Pd23/rGO (2.72 A mg−1Pd) > Pd/rGO (2.04 A mg−1Pd), which exhibits the same trend as the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy and Pd (Fig. S8, ESI†) and proves the Ag/Pd alloying effect on improving the FOR catalytic activity of the Pd/rGO catalyst. The alloying effect is further confirmed by the potential energy profiles in Fig. S9 (ESI†) where the Ag50Pd50 slab shows the lowest activation energy of 0.62 eV and the highest energy release of 0.43 eV for the formate oxidation reaction. Fig. S10 (ESI†) provides the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag51Pd49 and commercial Pd/C catalysts. The ECSA of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is as high as 103.27 m2 g−1Pd, which is 3.36 and 4.64 times higher than that of the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy and Pd/C catalyst, respectively, suggesting that the introduction of graphene can greatly increase the number of catalytically active sites on the AgPd nanoalloy. Moreover, Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows that the ECSAs of Ag77Pd23/rGO, Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag27Pd73/rGO and Pd/rGO catalysts are 103.22, 103.27, 80.73 and 59.15 m2 g−1Pd, which exhibits the same trend of peak mass activity as shown in Fig. 3b. For comparison, the CV curves of Ag/rGO and rGO in the electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK are shown in Fig. S12.† The FOR catalytic activity of Ag/rGO or rGO is very low, it is obvious that Ag and graphene improve the catalytic activity of Ag49Pd51/rGO through the alloying effect and supporting effect, rather than coming from the catalytic activity of Ag and graphene themselves.

(c) CA curves of Ag49Pd51/rGO, unsupported Ag51Pd49 and commercial Pd/C catalysts recorded at −0.2 V, and the inset in (c) shows the enlarged detail from 3500 to 3600 s. (d) Cycling stability curves of Ag49Pd51/rGO, unsupported Ag51Pd49 and commercial Pd/C catalysts with peak mass activity as a function of cycling number. Unless indicated, all of the electrocatalytic tests were performed in N2-saturated 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
Chronoamperometric (CA) tests were performed to evaluate the durability of Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag51Pd49 and commercial Pd/C catalysts as shown in Fig. 3c. The retention activity of Ag49Pd51/rGO and Ag51Pd49 catalysts is 0.118 and 0.012 A mg−1Pd after 3600 s, respectively, whereas commercial Pd/C loses the activity at approximately 2400 s. To have a clearer comparison, the cycling stability curves of Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag51Pd49 and Pd/C catalysts are shown in Fig. 3d and S13 (ESI†). During the cycling stability test, the catalytic activity and ECSA of the catalysts decline during the process of long-term operation, which can be explained as follows. Firstly, the intermediates such as H and CO32− might be adsorbed on the surface of catalysts and occupy the active sites, thereby inhibiting the continuation of the FOR. Secondly, some harmful impurities in the electrolyte such as SO42− and Cl− could interact with nanoparticles and make the surface active sites to decrease. Moreover, the concentration of formate near the working electrode will decrease with the catalytic reaction going on, especially when the current is high. In addition, the long-term potential cycling will lead to partial oxidation of the catalyst, reconstruction of the crystal surface, corrosion of the graphene support and agglomeration of nanoparticles, thus affecting catalytic activity. Despite that, after 500 CV cycles, the mass activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst remains at 49.1%, while the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy and commercial Pd/C catalyst retain 37.5% and 18.9%, respectively. The superior activity and stability of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst can be attributed to the effect of alloying Ag with Pd and the extremely large surface area of graphene as the support, making Ag49Pd51/rGO a powerful candidate to realize the effective utilization of formate.
Many experimental findings have demonstrated that the surface of the as-prepared catalysts is metastable under working conditions, thereby significantly influencing the catalytic performance.30,46,47 Therefore, the as-prepared catalysts were conditioned by potential cycling to investigate the possible surface reconstruction. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst recorded at different upper limit potentials of 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 V. The current density first increases when increasing the upper limit potential from 0.0 to 0.8 V and then decreases at 1.2 V, indicating that the surface of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst has been rearranged. A similar phenomenon for the AgPd nanoalloy is observed as shown in Fig. 4b, as a contrast, the catalytic activity of monometallic Pd is not increased on increasing the positive scan limit from 0.0 V to 0.8 V (Fig. S14, ESI†). To further study the effect of the scanning potential range on FOR catalytic performance, the FOR peak mass activity of Ag49Pd51/rGO, Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy and monometallic Pd catalysts obtained at different upper limit potentials is compared as shown in Fig. 4c and d. On increasing the positive scan limit, the current density of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 (2.13) A mg−1Pd at 0.0 V to 6.03 (4.98) A mg−1Pd at 0.8 (0.4) V and then decreases to 1.71 (0.42) A mg−1Pd at 1.2 V in the forward (backward) scan. Meanwhile, the current density of the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy increases from 1.35 (1.19) A mg−1Pd at 0.0 V to 2.49 (2.51) A mg−1Pd at 1.0 (0.8) V and decreases to 2.28 (1.45) A mg−1Pd at 1.2 V in the forward (backward) scan. For the monometallic Pd catalyst, the current density is almost constant in the forward scan and decreases in the backward scan when increasing the upper scan limit from 0.0 V to 1.2 V. Clearly, the upper limit potential in the CV scan has an obvious impact on the surface structure of Ag49Pd51/rGO and Ag51Pd49 catalysts; their activity enhancement is more obvious than that of the monometallic Pd catalyst, indicating that the alloying of Ag with Pd can make the catalyst more sensitive to the scanning potential range. Moreover, the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst has more intensive enhancement in catalytic activity in comparison with the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy, which proves that the introduction of graphene can amplify the influence of upper limit potential on catalytic activity. By adjusting the upper limit potential, a considerable mass activity of 6.03 A mg−1Pd can be obtained in the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst, which is 9.18 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst. It is worth noting that the activity decline of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is more intensive than the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy and monometallic Pd after 0.8 V, which might be because the excessive high potential could accelerate the corrosion of the graphene support.48

(c and d) Peak current density of Ag49Pd51/rGO, unsupported Ag51Pd49 and monometallic Pd catalysts in the forward scan and backward scan as a function of upper limit potential. Unless indicated, all of the CV tests were performed in N2-saturated 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
Wang et al. reported a similar phenomenon for the AgPdPt aerogel, and the FOR activity increases on increasing the positive scan limit from 1.1 to 1.3 V, which is attributed to the surface reconstruction by the outward diffusion of Ag.37 However, the effect of the support on the FOR has not been investigated, whereas the more obvious activity enhancement is observed for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst than the unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy in this study. The support of catalysts is demonstrated to have a critical effect on the surface reconstruction during reaction.47,49 For example, Divins et al. reported that the ceria support prevents the Rh atoms on RhPd nanoparticles from undergoing surface reconstruction, which has a strong influence on the ethanol steam reforming activity.47 In contrast, Pd surface segregation is reported over the Rh0.5Pd0.5/CeO2-nanorods rather than Rh0.5Pd0.5/CeO2-nanocubes.49
Surface composition and structure evolution during the formate oxidation reaction
To further investigate the reason why the FOR activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst changes significantly with the increase of upper limit potential, the surface of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst after the FOR test in 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte was measured by XPS as shown in Fig. 5 and S15 (ESI†). Fig. 5a and b depict the Pd 3d and Ag 3d spectra of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst after the FOR test at different upper limit potentials of 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 V. The Pd 3d spectra including 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks can be deconvoluted into the metallic state of Pd(0) and bivalent states of Pd(II), respectively.50,51 On increasing the upper limit potential, the fraction of Pd(II) increases from 39.86% at 0.0 V to 41.06% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 40.36% at 1.2 V (Table S2, ESI†). The Pd(II) component is considered to originate from the interaction of Pd–O and Pd–C, when the upper limit potential increases from 0.0 to 0.8 V, the oxidation of Pd increases, resulting in the increased fraction of Pd(II); however, when the upper limit potential is too high, the graphene support is corroded rapidly, with the weakened interaction of Pd–C, leading to the decreased fraction of Pd(II) at 1.2 V. Meanwhile, the fraction of the Ag(I) component increases from 26.96% at 0.0 V to 31.92% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 7.31% at 1.2 V.52,53 Moreover, the percentage increase of Ag(I) is more obvious than Pd(II) on increasing the positive scan limit. Fig. 5c shows the contents of surface Pd and Ag with different valence for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst at various upper limit potentials. After the FOR test, the surface Pd content is improved in comparison with the bulk content. On increasing the upper limit potential, the surface atomic fraction of Pd increases from 51.87% at 0.0 V to 62.42% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 58.34% at 1.2 V, indicating that Pd surface segregation occurs when increasing the upper limit potential. Meanwhile, the fraction of metallic Pd (0) increases from 31.20% at 0.0 V to 36.79% at 0.8 V, and then decreases to 34.79% at 1.2 V, which is in accordance with the evolution of FOR catalytic activity as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the fraction of Ag(I) does not decrease obviously despite the decrease of the Ag fraction when increasing the upper limit potential from 0.0 to 0.8 V. Fig. 5d displays the valence band spectrum of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst after the FOR test at different upper limit potentials for 10 cycles. The d-band centers of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst are located at 4.37, 4.52, 4.56 and 4.38 eV at different positive scan limits of 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 V, respectively. The farthest d-band centers of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst at 4.56 eV from the Fermi level are achieved through controlling the upper limit potential at 0.8 V, which can effectively reduce the adsorption of intermediates, thereby improving the catalytic performance.37

Fig. 6a and c and Fig. S16 (ESI†) show the CV curves of Ag49Pd51/rGO and unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy catalysts in 1 M KOH electrolyte after the FOR test in different potential ranges, which can in situ reveal the evolution on the surface of AgPd nanoparticles.54 With the increase of upper limit potential, the area ratio of Pd oxide and Ag oxide peaks varies. Fig. 6b shows the area ratios of PdO and Ag2O reduction peaks in the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst. Although there are large differences in the magnitude of these two peaks due to the difference in the reduction charge of PdO and Ag2O, the change of Ag/Pd area ratios could reflect the evolution of surface composition. As can be seen, the area percentage of PdO reduction for the fresh Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is 86.27%; after FOR tests, the area percentage of PdO reduction increases rapidly, indicating that the FOR process can make the internal Pd atoms migrate to the surface. Moreover, with the increase of the upper limit potential from 0.0 V to 0.6 V, the area percentage of PdO increases from 98.16 to 99.45%, suggesting that the surface coverage of Pd is further increased. Furthermore, on increasing the upper limit potential from 0.6 V to 1.2 V, the area percentage of PdO decreases from 99.45 to 97.51%, that is considered to be due to the oxidation of Ag, which is reported beneficial to the catalytic FOR.37 The Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy exhibits a similar phenomenon after the FOR test at different positive scan limits as shown in Fig. 6d, whose area percentage of PdO first increases from 84.67% at 0.0 V to 92.21% at 0.6 V, and then decreases at 0.8 V. However, the area of Ag2O in the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy is much higher than that of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst after FOR tests (Fig. 6b), which indicates that there is more Ag on the surface of the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy to be oxidized and reduced than the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst, further proving the effect of the graphene support on promoting the surface segregation of Pd atoms.

(d) Area ratios of PdO (red region) and Ag2O (black region) reduction peaks from the CV curves of the unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy in (c). Unless indicated, all of the CV tests were performed in N2-saturated 1 M KOH + 1 M HCOOK electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the above XPS, HRTEM and CV data, it can be concluded that during the process of the FOR test, the internal Pd atoms segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles. When the upper limit potential of CV treatment increases, the surface Pd fraction of Ag49Pd51/rGO increases more significantly, resulting in an enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity. However, when the upper limit potential is too high, the corrosion of the graphene support is accelerated and the generated high-valent Pd oxide is more difficult to be reduced (Fig. S17, ESI†), resulting in a decrease in surface active sites, thereby causing a decrease in electrocatalytic performance.
Why do the internal Pd atoms segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles? It has been reported that the oxidation of formate produces a large amount of H intermediate adsorbed on the surface of catalysts.52,55 As the upper limit potential in CV treatment increases, the surface oxidation of catalysts becomes more severe, accompanied by the decomposition of formate intensified, resulting in more H and O intermediates adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.56,57 In addition, some previous theoretical work predicted that the adsorption of H and O should induce internal Pd to segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles.35,58 Therefore, it can be deduced that the H and O adsorbates produced during CV treatment induce internal Pd atoms to segregate to the surface. With the increase of upper limit potential, the adsorption of H and O is intensified, resulting in more severe segregation, leading to the enhancement in catalytic performance. Furthermore, the enhancement in catalytic activity and the Pd surface segregation of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst are more obvious than unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloys with the increase of upper limit potential (Fig. 4 and 6), and the hydrogen desorption peak for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst raises when subjected to CV treatment in the electrolyte of 1 M KOH (Fig. S18, ESI†), while the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy shows an opposite trend. Given that Ag itself has no activity in hydrogen oxidation,59 the magnitude of the hydrogen desorption peak can directly reflect the number of Pd active sites on the surface. Therefore, the graphene support of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst exhibits a positive effect on increasing the number of Pd active sites for the supported AgPd nanoparticles during potential cycling. As a result, we hypothesize that it is due to the effect of C on graphene, which was accompanied by H and O to induce the surface segregation of internal Pd.
In this study, Pd surface segregation is observed when increasing the upper limit potential from 0.0 to 0.8 V, it is noteworthy that the direction of surface segregation for nanoalloy catalysts is different under various conditions. Taking AuPd nanoparticles as an example, some experimental results showed that Au surface segregation occurs under working conditions,60,61 whereas Enache et al.62 demonstrated that Pd surface segregation takes place during calcination, even some researchers reported that the surface segregation does not occur for AuPd nanoparticles.63
Theoretical discussion
The surface energy of Ag (1.25 J m−2) is lower than that of Pd (2.05 J m−2), Ag atoms tend to occupy the surface under vacuum.64 Pd atoms have higher affinity to oxygen than Ag atoms and are able to segregate to the surface under oxidative conditions.65 DFT calculations were performed to investigate the origin of surface reconstruction and the effect of the graphene support. 4 layers of a slab model system with a (2 × 2) supercell and (111) crystallographic surface orientation were created, with the bottom 2 layers of Pd atoms fixed as the bulk, and the top 2 layers with totally 4 Ag and 4 Pd atoms are relaxed to move freely. Fig. 7a shows the segregation energy for the AgPd slab under the coverage of 1/4 ML of H, O and C. The segregation energy of one Pd subsurface atom to the surface is 0.03 eV on a clean surface, which suggests the surface segregation of Ag. Once the surface is covered with 1/4 ML of H, O and C, the segregation energy of Pd changes sign from positive (0.03 eV) to negative (−0.26 eV for H, −0.36 eV for O and −1.16 eV for C), indicating the surface segregation of Pd. The effect of the graphene support on surface segregation of the AgPd nanoalloy is investigated by adsorbing 1/4 ML coverage of C atoms on the surface of the AgPd slab because the strong interaction between AgPd nanocluster and graphene makes the AgPd nanocluster severely deformed during the process of geometry optimization (Fig. S19, ESI†). In more detail, the segregation energy of Pd atoms from Pd surface coverage of 0 to 100% is shown in Fig. 7b. As the surface coverage of Pd increases, the segregation energy increases under a clean surface, indicating that the surface segregation is an uphill process, while the segregation energy decreases when the surface is covered with 1/4 ML of H, O and C, which proves that the adsorption of H, O and C atoms can make the surface segregation of Pd atoms more favorable in terms of thermodynamics. Moreover, the adsorption of C has the most remarkable effect in comparison with H and O to induce the surface segregation of Pd atoms due to the maximum segregation energy, resulting in more significant surface reconstruction for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst than the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy.

(b) Segregation energy as a function of Pd surface coverage under the coverage of 1/4 ML of H, O and C. (c) Adsorption energy of H, O and C atoms on the Ag (111) and Pd (111) surface. 
The adsorption energy of H, O and C adsorbed onto Ag (111) and Pd (111) surfaces is calculated in Fig. 7c to further study the reason why surface segregation is more favorable on Pd than the Ag surface. The adsorption energies of H, O and C adsorbed onto the Pd (Ag) surface are −2.74 (−2.1), −4.21 (−3.73) and −6.14 (−3.36) eV, respectively. Obviously, Pd atoms have higher binding strength with H, O and C atoms than Ag atoms, the stronger metal–adsorbate interaction provides a driving force for the surface segregation of Pd. It is noteworthy that the adsorption energy difference between Pd and Ag surfaces is −0.64, −0.48 and −2.78 eV for H, O and C atoms, the higher adsorption energy difference of C suggests that C is more attractive to Pd, leading to the more remarkable surface reconstruction for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst in comparison with the unsupported Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy.

Fig. 8 shows the potential energy profiles of one Pd subsurface atom migration to the AgPd (111) surface under different surface conditions. The activation energy of segregating a subsurface Pd atom to the surface under the condition of the clean surface and 1/4 ML coverage of H, O and C is 2.06, 1.62, 1.39 and 0.54 eV, respectively. It is obvious that the occurrence of Pd surface segregation is kinetically difficult under vacuum due to the activation barrier of up to 2.06 eV, which is in accordance with the positive segregation energy result in Fig. 7. When the surface is covered with 1/4 ML of H, O and C, the activation barrier decreases remarkably, demonstrating that the adsorption of H, O and C can make the surface segregation of Pd atoms become possible in terms of kinetics. Furthermore, the activation barrier of Pd surface segregation under the coverage of 1/4 ML of C is significantly lower than that under the coverage of 1/4 ML of H and O, which indicates that the effect of C for the surface segregation of Pd is greater than H and O. Combining with the thermodynamic results in Fig. 7, these kinetics results account for the surface reconstruction of AgPd nanoparticles and the facilitating effect of the graphene support.

The possibility of Pd surface segregation in AgPd nanoparticles during the CV process is further confirmed by the XPS and TEM results in Fig. S20, S21 and Table S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S20 (ESI†), the surface Pd coverage increases significantly from 48.34% to 68.15% after 10 cycles of CV treatment in 1 M KOH electrolyte, resulting in the increase in the hydrogen desorption peak (Fig. S18, ESI†). Fig. S21 (ESI†) shows the HRTEM images of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst before and after 10 cycles of CV in N2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte, which can also confirm the change on the surface of AgPd nanoparticles during the CV process. Obviously, the d-spacing of the (111) plane for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst decreases from 0.2334 to 0.2278 nm during the CV process. The d-spacing of Ag (111) and Pd (111) planes is 0.2359 and 0.2246 nm, it is inferred that the CV treatment makes internal Pd atoms segregate to the surface of AgPd nanoparticles, leading to an increase in the surface Pd content, thereby shifting the d-spacing value close to the Pd (111) plane and thus confirming the possibility of Pd surface segregation in potential cycling.
Conclusions
In summary, the AgPd/rGO catalysts were successfully prepared by a one-pot microwave assisted synthesis method to catalyze the FOR. The mass activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst is 6.38 times higher than that of the Pd/C catalyst, and the Ag49Pd51/rGO shows a considerable durability after successive 500 cycles, whose residual mass activity is 13.98 times higher than that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst. The enhanced FOR performance of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst benefits from the alloying effect of Ag with Pd and the large active surface area of graphene. In addition, the catalytic activity of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst increases from 2.32 to 6.03 A mg−1Pd with increasing the upper limit potential in CV, and the less obvious activity enhancement is observed for the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy. At the same time, the surface Pd content increases from 51.87% to 62.42% for the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst, proving the occurrence of surface reconstruction. DFT calculations further indicate that upon adsorption of H, O, and C atoms on the surface of AgPd nanoalloys, the segregation energy of one subsurface Pd atom to the surface is −0.26, −0.36 and −1.16 eV, and the activation energy for the migration of Pd atoms to the surface is 1.62, 1.39 and 0.54 eV, respectively, which are lower than the segregation (0.03 eV) and activation (2.06 eV) energy on the clean alloy surface and thus provide a thermodynamic driving force and a kinetics path for the observed surface reconstruction. Furthermore, the more obvious surface reconstruction of the Ag49Pd51/rGO catalyst than the Ag51Pd49 nanoalloy can be attributed to the stronger inducing effect of C than H and O atoms. It is believed that this work should provide an efficient application of formate as a product of CO2 electrochemical reduction and a strategy to understand surface reconstruction to maximize catalytic performance.
