    , Accepted 4th October 2018First published on 4th October 2018AbstractSodium (Na)-ion capacitors are emerging as one of the most promising hybrid devices for next generation electrochemical energy storage systems because of their abundant resources, and environmentally friendly nature as well as the potential integration of Na-ion batteries with high energy density and electrochemical capacitors with high power density. However, the practical application of Na-ion capacitors is severely hampered by the sluggish redox kinetics in anodes. To overcome this obstacle, the most effective approach is to develop a pseudocapacitive anode material for Na ion storage. Here, we demonstrate a predominant pseudocapacitive contribution for Na ion storage in tungsten disulphide (WS2) nanosheets within the potential window of 1–3 V vs. Na/Na+. Particularly, the root cause of pseudocapacitive Na ion storage in WS2 nanosheets was systematically investigated by operando X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ synchronous radiation tests and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This work may provide a fundamental insight into the development of pseudocapacitive materials for electrochemical energy storage systems.
Introduction
Due to the continuously aggravating energy and environmental crisis, industrial and research communities around the world have made increasing efforts towards the development of renewable energies such as solar energy and wind energy.1–4 Among various efficient energy storage devices for renewable energies, Na-ion capacitors with environmentally-friendly and cost-effective features are one of the most promising candidates for high-energy/power systems.5–7 Typically, Na-ion capacitors are coupled with faradaic materials as anodes and carbonaceous materials as cathodes in non-aqueous electrolytes. It is generally recognized that Na-ion capacitors can integrate the merits of the wide operating voltage range, redox-based energy storage in anodes, and fast ion adsorption/desorption kinetics in cathodes.8–20 However, further development of Na-ion capacitors is impeded by the anode materials owing to the relatively sluggish kinetics and large volume change during the charging/discharging process. Actually, the kinetics of the diffusion-limited redox reactions in anodes is much slower than those of surface-controlled capacitive cathodes. Intriguingly, because of reversibly surface-controlled redox reactions, intercalation pseudocapacitive anode materials may match with high-rate carbonaceous cathodes.21–23 Although considerable effort has been devoted to tailoring the capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) contribution in intercalation compound related anodes (such as MXenes,24,25 Na2Ti3O7,26 TiO2,27 TiO2/C,28 nanotube-like hard carbon,29 graphene,30 Nb2O5@carbon,31–34 SnO2@carbon,35 and mesoporous MoS2 (ref. 36)) for high-rate Na-ion capacitors, it is still an enormous challenge to explore new pseudocapacitive anodes for Na ion storage.
As a promising anode material for metal ion storage, WS2 is of particular interest due to its large interlayer spacing, high tap density (7.6 g cm−3) and environmentally friendly nature.37,38 On the one hand, WS2 exhibits better ion transportation than metal oxides and higher conductivity than MoS2. On the other hand, the large interlayer spacing of 0.62 nm with the weak van der Waals interaction allows the intercalation/deintercalation of Na ions without a serious volume change.39 Nevertheless, the full sodiation of WS2 involves not only the intercalation of Na ions into the layers (NaxWS2) and but also the subsequent conversion reaction of NaxWS2 to W and Na2S.40,41 In spite of the high-specific capacity, the four-electron conversion reaction with a large volume change would induce poor cycle stability and unsatisfactory rate capability,42,43 which cannot fulfill the requirement of electrochemical capacitors. Theoretically, only if the WS2 electrode exhibits a high capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) contribution with fast kinetics and small volume change, they can be coupled with a porous carbon cathode for fabricating Na-ion capacitors. However, there has been no related report to the best of our knowledge.
In this work, we demonstrate that WS2 nanosheets exhibit a high pseudocapacitive contribution for Na ion storage within the potential range of 1–3 V vs. Na/Na+. Such an intriguing phenomenon is induced by the combination of the solid-solution type intercalation reaction and surface-controlled pseudocapacitive reaction, which has been demonstrated by operando XRD, ex situ synchronous radiation tests and DFT simulations. Taking advantage of the fast kinetics of pseudocapacitances, the obtained WS2 nanosheets can be used as a high-rate anode for Na-ion capacitors matching well with electric-double-layer-capacitor (EDLC)-type carbonaceous cathodes. Specifically, the fabricated Na-ion capacitors delivered a maximum energy density of 63 W h kg−1 and maximum power density (7840 W kg−1) accompanied by a long lifespan (6000 cycles).
Experimental section
Synthesis of WS2 nanosheets
The bulk WS2 was exfoliated using a direct sonication method in an efficient solvent.44–46 Specifically, bulk WS2 powders (1 g) were added into a flask with 50 mL of DMF as the solvent. Followed by deoxygenation with Ar (99.99%) for 20 min under vigorous stirring, the mixture was batch sonicated for 8 hours under ice-cooling. After that, the resulting dispersions were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to sediment the unexfoliated bulk WS2. Then the supernatants were collected using a pipette followed by another centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min to sediment the thick WS2 flakes. The final exfoliated WS2 nanosheet powders were obtained by vacuum-assisted filtration after further washing with ethanol and deionized water.
Material characterization
The morphology of the obtained materials was first evaluated using Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM-4800-1) coupled with X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared sample were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX-IIA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) studies were conducted using a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) operated at 200 kV. The XPS measurements were performed using an AXIS ULTRA DLD X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system with a mono Al source for the valence analysis. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded using a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 analyzer at 77 K. The operando XRD investigation was performed using an X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE, Bruker AXS GmbH Co., Ltd). A home-made pouch cell was assembled with a window for X-ray penetration.47–49 The experimental setup contained a pouch cell holder connected to an electrochemical workstation (CHI440B, Shanghai Chenhua instrument Co., Ltd). The pouch cell was successively charged and discharged in the galvanostatic mode at a constant current density of 100 mA g−1.
Electrochemical measurements
The working electrodes were prepared by mixing the WS2 samples, acetylene black and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 on aluminium foil using a doctor-blade technique with the help of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The electrochemical properties of the WS2 nanosheets were tested using a 2032-type coin cell with sodium metal as the anode in 1 M NaClO4 in an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte (EC/DMC, 1:2 w/w). Cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were collected using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, CH Instruments, Inc., USA). Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were performed in the potential range of 1 to 3 V vs. Na/Na+ using a multi-channel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A). The anode material used was mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (m-HC) prepared by our previously reported method.50 The m-HC anode was prepared in the same way as the WS2 electrodes but with a higher thickness. The Na-ion capacitors were assembled with the WS2 electrode as the cathode and the m-HC electrode as the anode with the same electrolyte used in the above half-cell tests. The CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge plots were obtained using the same electrochemical workstation and multi-channel battery testing system.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
The first-principles calculations based on density functional theory were carried out to study the interactions between Na and the WS2 layer with the CASTEP package of Materials Studio 6.0 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional.51,52 The cutoff energy for the final set of energies was predefined as 660 eV. A (2 × 2) supercell of the WS2 layer associated with 5 × 5 × 2 k-point meshes was used to study the Na atom adsorption. All atoms were fully relaxed until the convergence criteria for energy were set to be 10−5 eV, and the residual forces on each atom became smaller than 0.01 meV Å−1. To obtain the migration energy barriers, the related linear synchronous transit/quadratic synchronous transit (LST/QST) method was carried out within a large 3 × 3 × 1 double layer supercell with 3 × 3 × 3 k-point meshes.53
Results and discussion
The prepared WS2 sample exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) lateral structure with sizes ranging from 100 nm to 200 nm (Fig. S1a†). Elemental mapping indicates that W and S atoms are uniformly distributed on the whole flake without O atoms (Fig. S1b†). The thickness of the as-prepared sample is in the range of 15 to 25 nm as seen in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S2†). In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sample (Fig. S3†), all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the hexagonal WS2 (2H-WS2) (JCPDS 08-1398).54 Based on the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. S4†), the measured lattice distance of 0.27 nm corresponds to the interlayer of the (100) planes of the WS2 crystal. In the high-resolution W 4f spectrum from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S5a†), three typical peaks at 32.8, 35.1 and 38.5 eV are assigned to W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2 and W 4f3/2, respectively, indicating the dominance of W(IV) in the prepared sample. In the S 2p spectrum (Fig. S5b†), doublet peaks with binding energies of 162.3 eV and 163.5 eV are characteristic of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of divalent sulphide ions in WS2.55
The electrochemical behaviours of WS2 nanosheets were examined using cyclic voltammograms (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests with a half-cell configuration. Fig. S6† displays the CV profiles of the WS2 nanosheets in the potential range of 1 to 3 V vs. Na/Na+ at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. In the initial CV curves, a strong cathodic peak is located at around 1.25 V which is ascribed to the reduction of WS2 to NaxWS2. The anodic peaks at 1.75 and 2 V correspond to the oxidation of NaxWS2 to WS2.41 A significant shift of the broad cathodic peak from 1.4 V to 1.8 V is noticed from the 2nd cycle onwards, which is probably attributed to the change of the chemical environment after the initial cycle. All the redox peaks of the following cycles overlap with those of the second cycle, suggesting a good reversible reaction and structural stability after the first cycle. From the GCD tests at 0.1 A g−1, the initial discharge and charge specific capacities of the WS2 nanosheets are 134 mA h g−1 and 122 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. S7†) with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 91%. The sloping voltage profiles without clear reaction plateaus are observed in the GCD curves after the initial cycles (Fig. 1a and S8†). Interestingly, electrochemical kinetics analysis (Fig. S9†) shows that the contribution ratios of the capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) storage and diffusion-controlled storage are 58% and 42%, respectively, at 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 1b). At a high sweep rate of 8 mV s−1, the capacitive contribution increases to over 85% of the total charge (Fig. S10†). Generally, there are two types of capacitive charge storage (the EDLC and pseudocapacitive one). For the EDLC-type electrode, a high specific surface area (like activated carbon (AC), over 2000 m2 g−1) is required, since its specific capacitance, to a certain extent, is proportional to its specific surface area.56 It should be noted that the prepared WS2 nanosheets have a rather low specific surface area (less than 30 m2 g−1) (Fig. S11†) and the EDLC-type capacitive contribution is basically negligible (less than 2 F g−1) (Fig. S12†). Therefore, the identified capacitive contribution in the prepared WS2 electrode is mostly from the pseudocapacitive reaction. In addition, the calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of [Na-solvents]+ is higher than the one-electron energy level diagram of the WS2 anode (Fig. 1c), indicating no decomposition of the electrolyte and avoiding the formation of the solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer on the WS2 surface for the one-electron conversion reaction.57

To gain an in-depth insight into the pseudocapacitive reaction of the as-prepared WS2 electrode for Na ion storage, we implemented the electrochemical impedance, operando XRD, and synchronous radiation tests to characterize the related electrode at different charge/discharge states. All Nyquist plots of the electrode based on WS2 nanosheets consist of a semicircle and a skew line (Fig. 2a and S13†); and the semicircle is associated with the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The Rct gradually decreases after the initial sodiation process, which should originate from the increase of the electrical conductivity of the sodiated WS2. Interestingly, the Rct begins to stabilize during the subsequent charge process. But when the potential decreased to below 1 V vs. Na/Na+, there is a very clear increase of Rct (Fig. S14†), corresponding to the formation of the SEI on the surface of the WS2 electrode. Real-time monitoring of the structural changes by XRD was conducted on the WS2 electrode in a customized pouch cell within the potential range of 1–3 V vs. Na/Na+. During the initial discharge process, the (002) peak at 14.4° progressively splits into two peaks towards a lower and higher degree (Fig. 2b). The continuous decrease in intensity of the (002) interlayer reflects the progressive weakening of the van der Waals interaction, which is probably related to the gradual disorder of the interlayer spacing after Na ion intercalation.36 Two new peak features are detected at 14.2° and 14.8°, which are directly related to the existence of the metallic phase.58 The non-recovery of the (002) peak during the Na ion deintercalation process evidences the initial irreversible structural transformation. More interestingly, a continuous sodiation/desodiation led to a loss of intensity of the new peak at 14.2° but without peak position displacement. Another new peak at 14.8° continuously shifts to higher angles during the sodiation process and then reversibly shifts to lower angles during the desodiation process, without existence of any additional diffraction patterns. All these results suggest a solid-solution reaction mechanism without clear phase transitions after the initial irreversible reaction.59,60 The electrochemically driven irreversible phase transition was further confirmed by the synchronous radiation test. Before the phase transformation occurs, the diffraction data are fit for the 2H-WS2 phase. After the initial discharge process, the appearance of several new reflection rings between the (002) and (008) rings may correspond to the metallic phase (Fig. 2c). After integrating the 2D diffraction patterns, the obtained 1D pattern after discharging shifts to low Q values undisputedly demonstrating that the initial sodiated process converts the WS2 nanosheets into a distinctly different crystalline phase. After the initial phase transition, the local bonding structure of sodiated WS2 is stabilized after charging (Fig. 2d), which confirms the solid solution reaction mechanism for Na ion storage after the initial irreversible reaction.

Encouragingly, DFT calculations were then performed to investigate the binding and diffusion behaviour of Na ions on the metallic WS2 surface and interlayers. The binding behaviour of Na on the WS2 surface was examined by arranging one Na atom at three different sites (TW, TS, and TH) (Fig. S15a†) on the WS2 surface and then relaxing the structure.61 After structural optimization, the most stable binding site has been determined to be the TW site with an adsorption energy of −1.48 eV (Fig. 3a). The binding energy (Eb) is evaluated according to the following equation: Eb = EComplex − EWS2 − ENa, in which EComplex, EWS2, and ENa are the total energies of the [Na–WS2] complex, WS2, and Na atom, respectively.61,62 The more negative value of Eb means a more energetically favourable adsorption. From the spatial distribution of the charge difference, the large charge deficiency at the Na atoms and charge excess at the nearby S atoms suggest strong electron transfer from Na atoms to WS2. Based on the Hirshfeld charge analysis,63 it was demonstrated that there is a charge transfer 0.24 electrons from each Na ion to the TW site of the WS2 (Fig. S15b and c†). A more detailed charge distribution before and after Na adsorption is presented in Table S1.† The electron localization function (ELF) contour plot is illustrated in Fig. 3b, in which the value of 1 corresponds to perfect localization and the value of 1/2 means a uniform electron gas. At TW and TH sites, the values of ELF at the Na and S sites are relatively large, suggesting a strong local characteristic and that the adsorption of Na on the WS2 surface is mainly dominated by chemically ionic components.

As is well-known, the rate capability of electrode materials is determined by the electrical conductivity and ion diffusivity. The electronic band structures of WS2 with Na intercalation are then examined. As shown in Fig. 4a, the pristine 2H WS2 is a semiconductor with a direct energy band gap of 1.1 eV, agreeing well with previous results.64 With the intercalation of Na ions, the sodiated WS2 gradually produces relatively small band gaps, finally changing from the semiconducting phase to the metallic phase with considerable electronic states at the Fermi energy level (Fig. 4a). The semiconducting to metallic transition leads to an enhanced electrical conductivity of the anode based on WS2 nanosheets, which is consistent with the experimental EIS test. In addition, the orbital overlap between S and W near the Fermi level (Fig. 4a) indicates the hybridization interactions of embedded Na with WS2. In addition, the possible diffusion paths and the Na ion mobility are considered in our calculation. Based on the simulation results, the optimized diffusion path of Na ions in metallic WS2 is from one TW site to another adjacent TW site (barrier: 0.17 eV); while the optimized diffusion path of Na ions in 2H-WS2 is from one TH site to another adjacent TH site (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the energy barrier of Na ion mobility on metallic WS2 (0.17 eV) is much lower than that of pristine 2H-WS2 (0.5 eV) (Fig. 4c). According to the Arrhenius equation (D = Aexp(−Ea/kBT), in which Ea, kB and T are the energy barrier, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively),61,65 the extremely low energy barrier may guarantee rapid Na ion diffusion. Specifically, the Na ion diffusion rate in metallic WS2 is estimated to be 106 times faster than that in 2H-WS2. The extraordinarily quasi-1D Na ion diffusion in metallic WS2 is greatly enhanced in comparison with its 2H counterpart owing to the extremely low energy barrier. Based on the above various ex/in situ experimental analyses and theoretical simulations, it can be concluded that, after the initial irreversible electrochemically-driven structural transformation in the electrode based on the WS2 nanosheets, the surface pseudocapacitive reaction and reversible solid solution reaction with fast Na ion mobility dominate the subsequent electrochemical activity. Namely, with the enhanced metallic conductivity and fast Na ion mobility after the initial irreversible reaction, the surface pseudocapacitive reaction and solid-solution intercalation reaction induce enhanced pseudocapacitive Na ion storage in the WS2 nanosheets.

Considering the outstanding pseudocapacitive contribution for Na ion storage, the prepared WS2 nanosheets were coupled with mesoporous hollow carbon (m-HC) cathodes for fabricating Na-ion hybrid capacitors (Fig. S16†). Before the full-cell fabrication, the electrochemical performances of m-HC cathodes were checked in a half-cell to optimize the related electrode mass loading for the Na-ion capacitors. As illustrated in Fig. S17a,† the m-HC cathode shows a nearly rectangular shape in the CV curves in the potential range of 3–4.5 V vs. Na+/Na. Moreover, it displays individual specific capacitances of 122, 113, 98 and 80 F g−1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively (Fig. S17b and c†). All its GCD profiles were basically linear slopes of the ideal EDLC. According to the rate capability of the half-cell tests, the optimized mass ratios of the anode and cathode were set in the range of 1:2.5 to 1:3 at various current densities. For the fabricated Na-ion capacitor, the CV curves exhibited wide and inconspicuous peaks at various sweep rates (Fig. S18†), resulting from the combination of EDLC-type and pseudocapacitive-type charge storage features. Similarly, a slight deviation from the normative linear shape in the GCD curves is associated with the coupling effect of the two electrodes with different charge storage mechanisms (Fig. 5a). The fabricated Na-ion capacitor can finish one charge/discharge cycle in an extremely short time (<40 s). At a current density of 0.5 A g−1, it delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 37 F g−1 (35.5 mA h g−1) based on the total mass of the active anode and cathode materials (Fig. 5b). When the current density increases to 3 A g−1, its specific capacity decreases to 24 F g−1 (23.5 mA h g−1). In addition, a remarkable cycling stability is manifested with a capacitance retention of 85% after 6000 cycles (Fig. 5c). The 2D structure of the WS2 electrode can be well maintained after such long time cycles (Fig. S19†). In addition, its Coulombic efficiency is maintained around 100% during the initial several cycles (Fig. S20†). Based on the Ragone plots (Fig. 5d) derived from the GCD curves at various current densities, the fabricated Na-ion capacitor presented an energy density of 63 W h kg−1 at a power density of 350 W kg−1 based on the total mass of the active cathode and anode materials. The energy density decreased to 17 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 7840 W kg−1. Although its energy density is lower than those of many Li-ion capacitors and some Na-ion capacitors based on alloy and conversion anodes,4,7,66,67 it is highly competitive with the state-of-art Na-ion capacitors based on intercalation-type anodes, such as the V2O5@CNT//AC (38 W h kg−1),5 Na0.66Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2//AC,15 TiO2//AC (64 W h kg−1),27 and Nb2O5@graphene//AC (56 W h kg−1).32 Clearly, the fabricated Na-ion capacitor overlaps with the lower power densities of electric double layer capacitors and the lower energy densities of Na-ion batteries, bridging the performance gap between Na-ion batteries and electric-double-layer capacitors.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that WS2 nanosheets exhibited a high pseudocapacitive contribution for Na ion storage within the potential range of 1–3 V vs. Na/Na+. The Na-ion capacitor constructed with the WS2 nanosheets as the anode delivered a high power density accompanied by a long lifespan benefiting from the fast kinetics of Na ion storage in the WS2 nanosheets. Various ex/in situ experimental analyses and theoretical calculations revealed that the WS2 nanosheets exhibited both the surface pseudocapacitive reaction and solid-solution intercalation reaction after the initially irreversible electrochemically-driven structural transformation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of WS2 nanosheets as the anode for cost-effective Na-ion capacitors with enhanced kinetics. In addition, the presented results may provide guidelines to develop pseudocapacitive materials for high-rate electrochemical energy storage devices.
