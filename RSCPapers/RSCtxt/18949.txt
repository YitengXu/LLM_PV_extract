, Accepted 24th August 2015First published on 24th August 2015AbstractWe report herein that the use of a diketopyrrolopyrrole instead of a 4,8-dithienyl benzodithiophene π-bridge makes a BODIPY dimer become capable of capturing and exploiting visible solar photons via intramolecular energy transfer, and affording a crystalline blend film with PC71BM, and consequently, a 7.3% absorption enhancement leads to a 70% increase in the photocurrent and efficiency.
Since the first report by Treibs and Kreuzer,1 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) dyes have been extensively investigated for decades, for example, in the fields of chemical sensors and cell imaging and labelling, due to the intense absorption and emission profiles together with small Stoke’s shifts.2 Recent efforts on the molecular design have led to an important approach to red-shift the low-energy absorption band to capture near infrared solar photons by extending the π-system with electron-donating groups at their α- and/or β-positions.3 For instance, the α-positions of thienyl-functionalised BODIPY dyes show two absorption bands, one is in the near-infrared region, typically around 700 nm, the other usually appears in the near-ultraviolet region, around 400 nm.4 Both absorption bands have a maximum absorption coefficient in the magnitude of 105 M−1 cm−1, but unfortunately, they leave an absorption “gap” (480–650 nm) in the visible region. The onset of the film absorption extends even beyond 900 nm with a narrow bandgap of <1.4 eV. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels are around −3.7 and −5.0 eV, respectively. All of these excellent optoelectronic properties strongly demonstrate that the BODIPY core is a good chromophoric candidate for designing narrow bandgap donor materials with excellent solar photon capturing capabilities.
Although the α- and β-positions of the π-extending BODIPY-based donors have excellent light-harvesting ability, the reported molecules often give inferior cell performance when blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61 (or C71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM), normally exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching or exceeding 2%.5 So far, there are only two efficient derivatives reported. One showed a PCE of 3.2%6 and the other gave a PCE of 4.7%, which is the highest value reported for the BODIPY-based donor materials. The low PCE is associated with its low carrier mobility and therefore, the improvement of the molecular ordering is a strategy to enhance the short-circuit current (Jsc). For example, the intermolecular I⋯F interactions and the π–π stacking between the planar dyes favor the short-distance organization of the molecules of the α-positions of dithienyl-functionalised BODIPY, which enhances the hole mobility, and the Jsc up to about 14 mA cm−2.4 In contrast to this highest Jsc value reported to date, values from other reported BODIPY dyes were normally ≤7 mA cm−2. We have recently presented a twisted BODIPY dimer approach to enhance the Jsc, in which two α-positions of the π-extending BODIPY moieties are covalently linked via their meso positions by a central planar trithiophene π-bridge. The resulting dimer molecule possesses enhanced π–π stacking, compared to the monomeric BODIPY dye, and the twisted dimeric conformation can lead to the so-called steric pairing effects,7 both of which improve molecular ordering in pristine and blend films and therefore yield a Jsc of 11.28 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 3.1%.8 However, the trithiophene-mediated dimer unfortunately leaves an absorption gap between 480–650 nm, as the mother BODIPY monomer does.
In this contribution, we present that the absorption gap of a BODIPY dimer can be filled and its crystallinity can be efficiently controlled, both of which are achievable by simply using a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), instead of a 4,8-dithienyl-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) π-bridge (Fig. 1). As a result, a 1.07-time enhancement of the absorption can lead to a 1.7-fold increase of the Jsc from 7.8 to 13.4 mA cm−2 and hence, the PCE from 2.1% to 3.6%.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the two dimers. 
The two dimers were synthesized successfully via Pd-catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura coupling and Stille coupling reactions, respectively. The final structures and purities of the products were confirmed using NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS and elemental analysis (ESI†). Both dimers show highly twisted conformations with the dihedral angles between the π-bridge and the BODIPY planes all being nearly 90°, indicating poor electronic communication between them as simulated by Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G level (Fig. S1, ESI†).
The absorption spectra both in the dilute chloroform solution and in the pristine film (Fig. 2A) clearly confirm that the central DPP segment just complements the absorption “gap” between the two absorption bands of the BODIPY moieties, i.e. one from 350–500 nm and the other from 650–800 nm, because of the reduced π-electron conjugation between the two segments. To find out how the dimer can possibly utilize the solar photons absorbed by the central DPP segment, we measured fluorescence spectra (Fig. 2B, S3 and S4†) and the absolute fluorescence quantum yields (ΦFL) (Fig. 2C) of the BODIPY, DPP and BDT segments, the 1:2 DPP-to-BODIPY or BDT-to-BODIPY mixture (both in molar), and the two dimers in solution. Experimental details are given in the ESI.† Overlap between the fluorescence of the DPP/BDT segment and the absorption of the BODIPY implies possible intramolecular energy transfer, going from the DPP/BDT π-bridge to the terminal BODIPY. Under excitation at 580 nm where the BODIPY segment has a much weaker absorption (12 × 103 M−1 cm−1) than the DPP (45 × 103 M−1 cm−1), the ΦFL of the DPP segment, as detected in between the wavelengths of 600–850 nm, dramatically decreases from 43.6% to 12.6%. Simultaneously, the ΦFL of the BODIPY segment increases from 0% to 7.7%, as detected in between the wavelengths of 750–850 nm. This clearly reveals that the fluorescence emission from DPP can be absorbed by the BODIPY segment as they are both physically mixed in the dilute solution. As the two segments are covalently linked to form the DPP-mediated dimer, the fluorescence from the DPP π-bridge is fully quenched, indicating that efficient Förster resonance energy transfer takes place between the DPP π-bridge and the BODIPY terminals. The slight decrease of the ΦFL detected from the BODIPY part, from 7.7% to 6.2%, can be attributed to the existence of other deactivated processes within the dimer. Similar energy transfer processes can also be observed in the case of the BDT-based system. All these data strongly support that the photons absorbed by the DPP/BDT π-bridge can be efficiently exploited through the cascade energy transfer from the DPP/BDT π-bridge to the BODIPY terminal.

(B) The absorption spectrum of the BODIPY segment (left, solid) and the fluorescence spectra of the DPP (blue), BDT (pink) and BODIPY (olive) segments (right, dash). The molecular structures of the three segments are given in Fig. S2 (ESI†). (C) The absolute quantum yield (ΦFL) of the three segments. The upper one shows the ΦFL of the DPP (A–C) and the BODIPY (D–F) part, measured from the pure DPP or BODIPY segment solution, 1:2 mixed DPP-to-BODIPY segment solution (in molar) and the DPP-mediated dimer solution, respectively. All solution samples were excited using 580 nm light. The lower one gives the ΦFL of the BDT (A–C) and the BODIPY (D–F) part, measured from the pure BDT or BODIPY segment solution, 1:2 mixed BDT-to-BODIPY segment solution (in molar) and the BDT-mediated dimer solution, respectively. All solution samples were excited using 330 nm light. 
The HOMO/LUMO of the dimers were determined to be −5.01/−3.73 and −5.02/−3.73 eV for the DPP- and BDT-mediated dimer, respectively, using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The photovoltaic properties of the dimers were studied with the normal cell structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al with PC71BM as the acceptor. Detailed information of the optimizations of the solar cells is available in the ESI and in Table S3 (ESI†). Fig. 3A and B display the current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal cells. The cells based on DPP(BODIPY)2 exhibit the best PCE of 3.62% (average 3.40%) with a Jsc of 13.39 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V and a fill-factor (FF) of 0.373, while the best cell based on BDT(BODIPY)2 only gives a moderate PCE of 2.10% (average 1.98%) with an inferior Jsc of 7.76 mA cm−2, a similar Voc of 0.76 V and a slightly lower FF of 0.356. The integrated current densities (JEQE) from the EQE curves are 13.13 and 7.32 mA cm−2, respectively, each of which is in good accordance with the corresponding Jsc value from the J–V curve.
 Fig. 3  (A) The J–V and (B) the EQE curves (left, solid lines) of the best cells based on DPP(BODIPY)2 or BDT(BODIPY)2:PC71BM blends, respectively. In (B) the absorption spectra of the blend films are shown for comparisons (right, dashed lines). 
The contribution of the DPP π-bridge to the photocurrent is strongly evidenced by the comparisons of the EQE spectra of the best cells and the absorption spectra of the solar cell blend films (Fig. 3B). The blend films of the two dimers show nearly identical absorption in the wavelength range of the BODIPY segments, while the DPP-mediated one possesses stronger absorbance between 520 and 760 nm, the absorption wavelength range of the DPP segment. The total absorption, as described by the integrated area, is enhanced by 7.3%. The EQE curve from the DPP(BODIPY)2-based cell is higher over the spectral wavelength range than that from the BDT(BODIPY)2-based cell. As Fig. S6 (ESI†) displays, the EQE of the BDT(BODIPY)2-based cell multiplied by 1.26 is very close to that of the DPP(BODIPY)2-based cell in the absorption wavelength range of the BODIPY segments. This allows us to estimate the contribution of the central DPP π-bridge to the photocurrent, which is about 3.9 mA cm−2, as calculated according to the equation JEQEDPP(BODIPY)2 − (1.26 × JEQEBDT(BODIPY)2). This value suggests that the 7.3% enhancement of the absorption from the DPP π-bridge can contribute to the 42.3% increase in the photocurrent, as calculated using 3.9/(1.26 × 7.32), strongly suggesting that the DPP π-bridge contributes to the Jsc enhancement not only via the absorption improvement, but also greatly via other morphological factors. This is further supported by the 1.26-fold higher EQE in the absorption wavelength range of the BODIPY segments.
Both the hole and electron (μh and μe) mobilities of the solar cell blends were estimated with a space-charge-limited current method. The values of μh/μe are 2.10/3.48 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.58/7.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DPP(BODIPY)2:PC71BM and BDT(BODIPY)2:PC71BM blended films, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). With respect to the BDT(BODIPY)2-based blend, the DPP(BODIPY)2-based blend shows an approximately 10-fold increase in both the μh and μe values, which is consistent with the larger Jsc value (13.39 vs. 7.76 mA cm−2) from the DPP-mediated molecule. The X-Ray diffraction (XRD) data of the solar cell blend films (Fig. 4A and B) indicate that the DPP-mediated dimer is highly crystalline, as judged from the intense and sharp (100) and (200) diffractions, while the BDT-mediated one is amorphous, in both the pristine and the blend films. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 4C and D) demonstrate that the phase size of the DPP(BODIPY)2-based blend (30–40 nm) is slightly larger than that of the BDT(BODIPY)2-based one (15–25 nm), both of which are in the scope of the exciton diffusion length. Moreover, atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S8, ESI†) was used to investigate the surface morphologies of the blends. A bicontinuous interpenetrating network with phase sizes of 20–40 and 10–25 nm can be seen from the AFM phase images of the DPP(BODIPY)2- and BDT(BODIPY)2-based blends (Fig. S8A and C, ESI†), and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness deduced from the height images (Fig. S8B and D, ESI†) is 0.323 nm for the DPP(BODIPY)2-based blend, slightly larger than that of the BDT(BODIPY)2-based blend (0.261 nm).

In summary, we have clearly shown that the utilization of the DPP π-bridge instead of the 4,8-dithienyl BDT one, can not only afford enhanced absorption for capturing more visible solar photons but can also greatly improve the crystallinity of the BODIPY dimer in both the neat and blend films, leading to a significant increase in the photocurrent by 1.7 times and hence in the PCE value from 2.1% to 3.6%, which is the second best PCE achievable from BODIPY-based organic solar cells so far. However, the low FF of DPP(BODIPY)2 is still far from satisfactory. In fact, the low FF can always be seen in BODIPY-based cells, largely due to the small parallel resistance (Rshunt) and the large series resistance (Rs). To further improve the FF and the PCE of BODIPY-based solar cells, continuous efforts should be made to rationally tailor the molecular structure and optimize the processing procedures and the structure of the devices.
