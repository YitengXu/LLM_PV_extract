    , Accepted 29th May 2019First published on 29th May 2019AbstractMetal germanate nanospheres including Ca2Ge7O16, Zn2GeO4 and SrGe4O9 were successfully synthesized by a direct and large-scale electrospraying method. As anodes for lithium ion batteries, the prepared metal germanate nanospheres showed high electrochemical lithium storage performance including excellent cycling stability and high rate capacity. Especially, the Ca2Ge7O16 nanosphere anode delivered a high specific capacity of ∼ 670 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. The capacity retention was maintained around 71% even after 500 cycles. Moreover, when applied as room-temperature ammonia gas sensors, all three prepared germinate nanospheres showed significant sensing response values (6.04 for SrGe4O9, 2.73 for Zn2GeO4 and 1.70 for Ca2Ge7O16), fast response–recovery time, excellent stability and outstanding selectivity.
Introduction
Germanate-based ternary oxides, including Ca2Ge7O16, Zn2GeO4, SrGe4O9, BaGe4O9, etc., are typical wide-bandgap semiconductors and they have been widely investigated due to their unique merits of environmental benignity, cost effectiveness and widespread availability.1–4 In the past several years, germanates with various microstructures such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires and microspheres have been prepared by either traditional solid-state reaction or chemical solution methods and have found potential applications in LIBs, catalysis, white light-emitting diodes and gas sensors.5,6 For example, Guo et al. reported a series of germanate (Ca2Ge7O16, BaGe4O9 and SrGe4O9) nanowires synthesized by the hydrothermal process, which displayed outstanding electrochemical lithium storage performances when used as anodes for LIBs.7 From a template-engaged in situ synthesis process, Zn2GeO4 hollow microspheres consisting of nanoparticles have been prepared and they exhibited high photocatalytic activity and excellent stability for the degradation of the antibiotic metronidazole.8 By encapsulating Ca2Ge7O16 nanowires within graphene sheets, we demonstrated their applications in LIBs with improved electrochemical performance when compared with pure nanowire structures.9 Tubelike SrGe4O9 structures were also synthesized by an electrospinning process, which can detect ammonia at room temperature with a maximum sensing response of 2.49 for 100 ppm NH3.10 All the above-mentioned results suggest that developing effective methods for the controllable preparation of metal germanates with special nanostructures is an efficient way to realize the potential applications of these materials.
Electrospraying as an easy and low cost synthesis technique has been widely used to fabricate thin films or nano/micro-particles with particular microstructures, which can be applied in dye-sensitized solar cells, biomedical treatments, drug delivery, catalysis, sensors and energy storage devices.11–15 By adjusting some experimental parameters such as static voltage, jet distance, and concentration of the precursors,16–19 the size and microstructures of the electrospray synthesized materials can be easily tuned. As a result, in recent years, the electrospraying technique has been widely applied to synthesize TiO2 mesporous spheres,20 Fe3O4/C microspheres,21 porous graphene,22 Si/C porous microspheres,23 CdSe/ZnS quantum dot thin films,24 nanometer-scale silver crystallites,25etc.
In this work, using the simple electrospraying technique, we reported the synthesis of various germanate nanospheres, including Ca2Ge7O16, Zn2GeO4 and SrGe4O9 nanospheres. As anode materials, all the three prepared germanates exhibited high lithium storage performance including remarkable cycling stabilities and high rate capacity. Besides, we also fabricated gas sensors with the synthesized germanate nanospheres as the sensing materials, and they showed significant sensing response values (6.04 for SrGe4O9, 2.73 for Zn2GeO4 and 1.70 for Ca2Ge7O16), fast response–recovery time, excellent stability and outstanding selectivity.
Experimental
Materials
Calcium chloride (CaCl2), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), strontium chloride (SrCl2), ethoxyl germanium (Ge(OEt)4) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents Co., Shanghai, China. 1,2,4,5-Benzenetetracarboxylic anhydride (PDMA) and bis(4-aminophenyl) ether (ODA) were supplied by Qi Fuqin Materials Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China. All the chemicals were used without further purification.
Synthesis of metal germanate nanospheres
Using Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres as an example, we described the synthesis process by the electrospraying method. In a typical procedure, 0.05 g CaCl2 and 0.44 g Ge(OEt)4 were dissolved in 25 g DMF solution under ultrasonic agitation for 0.5 h to yield a transparent solution. Then 1.0 g of PDMA and 1.1 g ODA were added to the above solution and kept stirring for 0.5 h. The resultant solution was loaded into a plastic syringe connected to a high voltage power supply for electrostatic spraying (Scheme 1). Using a medical propulsion pump, a constant flow rate of 0.1 mL h−1 was maintained, the distance between the spraying jet and the collector was 15 cm. With a high voltage of 24 kV, the electrostatically sprayed spheres could be collected on the surface of the collector. The obtained products were calcined at 600 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The synthesis processes for the other two germanate (Zn2GeO4 and SrGe4O9) nanospheres were similar except that 0.27 g of ZnCl2 and 0.25 g of Ge(OEt)4 for Zn2GeO4 spheres and 0.08 g SrCl2 and 0.5 g Ge(OEt)4 for SrGe4O9 samples were used, respectively.

Materials characterization studies
The crystal structures of the as-synthesized products were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD, DMAX-RB) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS, SUPRA 55). The size and morphology of the samples were characterized via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 55) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2200FS). The chemical composition of the products was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS Thermo escalab 250XI).
Li-ion battery assembly and characterization
The CR2032-type coin cells were assembled to evaluate the lithium storage properties of the synthesized metal germanate nanospheres. Firstly, the working electrodes were fabricated by pasting a mixture of the nanospheres, carbon black and PVDF (80:10:10 by weight) onto a copper foil, which was dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. Then the half-cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox by using the as-prepared working electrodes as the anode, Celgard 2325 as the separator, lithium-foil as the counter electrode and 1 M LiPF6 in EC-DMC (1:1 by volume) as the electrolyte. Finally, the half-cells were aged for 24 h for further investigation. The galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were carried out by using the Land Battery measurement system (Wuhan, China) with a cutoff potential of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D, Shanghai). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the electrochemical workstation at a frequency range of 100 mHz–100 kHz.
Gas sensor fabrication and measurement
To fabricate the gas sensors, an appropriate amount of the products was mildly ground in an agate mortar with several drops of deionized water to form a homogeneous paste. Then, the obtained paste was uniformly coated on a ceramic substrate with the Ag electrode. The gas-sensing properties of the sensors were measured by using a CGS-1 TP intelligent gas sensitivity analysis system. The gas-sensing sensitivity was assessed through the response value of the electric resistance, which was defined as S = Ig/Ia, where Ig and Ia are the sensor currents in target gas and in dry air, respectively.
Results and discussion
The obtained Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres were first characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1a. Clearly, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to Ca2Ge7O16 with the orthorhombic phase (JCPDS card No. 34-0286), confirming the formation of pure samples. The low-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1b shows that spherical Ca2Ge7O16 samples were prepared on a large scale via the present electrospraying process. A high-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1c reveals that the obtained Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres had a smooth surface with the diameters ranging from 100–130 nm. Fig. 1d displays the EDS elemental mapping analysis of a single Ca2Ge7O16 nanosphere. Obviously, only three elements of Ca, Ge and O were detected, confirming the uniform distribution of the three elements in the nanosphere. The corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1e shows a clear lattice spacing of 0.36 nm, matching well with the (021) crystalline plane of the orthorhombic Ca2Ge7O16 phase. Fig. 1f–h show further information about the composition and chemical valence of the species of the Ca2Ge7O16 products. Fig. 1f shows the full-range spectrum of the Ca2Ge7O16 sample, where only signals from Ca, Ge, O and C were observed. Fig. 1g shows the deconvoluted spectrum of Ca in the Ca2Ge7O16 products, where the peak at around 348 eV was assigned to the Ca 2p orbital. The peak in Fig. 1h centered around 33 eV can be attributed to the Ge 3d. All of these results agreed well with the literature and further confirmed the formation of uniform Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres.26

The synthesized Zn2GeO4 and SrGe4O9 samples were also characterized and the corresponding results are depicted in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of the synthesized Zn2GeO4 samples is shown in Fig. 2a and all the peaks matched well with the rhombohedral Zn2GeO4 phase (JCPDS No.11-0687). Fig. 2b is the SEM image, revealing the formation of Zn2GeO4 nanospheres with the diameters of 120–140 nm. The corresponding HRTEM image in Fig. 2c illustrates that the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres were of high crystallinity. The clearly resolved lattice fringe was found to be 0.27 nm, corresponding to the (410) spacing of the rhombohedral Zn2GeO4 phase. Similar to the synthesized Ca2Ge7O16 and Zn2GeO4 nanospheres, the XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS results in Fig. 2d–f and h revealed the formation of SrGe4O9 nanospheres as well from the current electrospraying process.

The electrochemical performance of the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres as the anode in a coin-type configuration was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements in the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the first five CV curves of the Ca2Ge7O16 electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. In the first cathodic sweep, the irreversible reduction peaks between 0.2 and 1.0 V may be attributed to the conversion of Ca2Ge7O16 into Ca, Ge, Li2O and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) related to the decomposition of the electrolyte. The other reduction peak at around 0.2 V indicated the Li–Ge alloying reaction. In the anodic-scan process, a broad peak centered at about 0.4 V can be assigned to the delithiation of the Li–Ge alloy. In the subsequent cycles, the main cathodic peak remained at 0.2 V, corresponding to the lithiation process of Ge. During the anodic potential sweeps, the broad oxidation peak at around 0.4 V related to the delithiation was almost unchanged.27,28 No obvious variations over these CV curves were observed from the second cycle onward, suggesting the good reversibility of the Ca2Ge7O16 nanosphere based anodes. Fig. 3b further shows the 1st, 10th, 30th, 50th and 100th discharge/charge curves of the Ca2Ge7O16 anode at the current density of 0.2 A g−1 within a potential window of 0.01–3.0 V, respectively. The anode delivered an initial discharge/charge specific capacity of 1040/754 mA h g−1, with a coulombic efficiency of 72.5%. In the discharge profiles, the slope between 0.3 and 0.05 V was associated with the lithiation of Ge, corresponding to the sharp reduction peak at 0.2 V in the CV curve.29 In subsequent cycles, the charge/discharge curves were basically overlapped and remained steady, revealing the excellent stability of the Ca2Ge7O16 anode. Fig. 3c demonstrates the charge/discharge curves of the electrodes at different current densities. With the increase of the current density from 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 to 1 A g−1, the discharge capacities were 856, 657, 429, and 236 mA h g−1, respectively.

(b) 1st, 10th, 30th, 50th and 100th lithium-insertion/extraction curves at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. (c) Charge/discharge curves at current densities between 0.1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. (d) Rate performance at various current densities. (e) Coulombic efficiency curves at different current densities. (f) Electrochemical impedance spectra of the spherical electrode after 10 cycles, 100 cycles and 300 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, respectively. 
The corresponding rate performance of the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres is shown in Fig. 3d, revealing the very stable reversible capacities of the nanospheres during cycling at each current density. When the current density was back to the initial value of 0.1 mA g−1, the specific capacity also recovered. Fig. 3e shows the corresponding coulombic efficiency calculated from Fig. 3d at various current densities, which almost remained as high as 100% at various current densities over 60 cycles except for the first cycle. The high coulombic efficiency demonstrated that the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres with good rate capacity could be a promising anode candidate for lithium-ion batteries. To better understand the lithium storage mechanism of the Ca2Ge7O16 anode, EIS measurement was further carried out after 10, 100 and 300 cycles, Fig. 3f. The Nyquist plot of the Ca2Ge7O16 anode is composed of a depressed semicircle in the high-frequency zone and a sloping line in the low-frequency zone. The semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) on the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the sloping line is called the Warburg resistance, representing Li+ diffusion kinetics in the electrode. Besides, the Ca2Ge7O16 anode showed the charge transfer resistances of about 124 and 126 Ω after 10 and 100 cycles, respectively. When the anode was charged and discharged for 300 cycles, the charge transfer resistance increased to 275 Ω.
In order to investigate the possible mechanism of the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres, the cycling stability was evaluated at the current density of 0.2 Ag−1 and the nanospheres were further characterized by SEM when cycled for various cycles. Fig. 4a shows the charge/discharge cycling performance of the Ca2Ge7O16 anode under the current density of 0.2 A g−1. The specific capacity obviously decreased during the first ten cycles, owing to the irreversible decomposition reaction of Ca2Ge7O16 and the formation of the SEI film. After that, the anode showed stable cycling performance with a high specific capacity of about 660 mA h g−1 even after 300 cycles. After 500 cycles, the specific capacity still maintained at about 475 mA h g−1, revealing the very good cycling stability of the Ca2Ge7O16 nanosphere anode. The SEM image in Fig. 4b is the Ca2Ge7O16 anode before cycling. After 100 cycles, no obvious structural damage happened, as shown in Fig. 4c. After 300 cycles, the SEM image (Fig. 4d) shows that many nanospheres tend to aggregate together, resulting in the decrease of the specific capacity of the anode due to the increase of charge transfer resistance as revealed in Fig. 3f. After 500 cycles, the corresponding SEM image in Fig. 4e shows little change in morphology compared with the one after 300 cycles, confirming its superior cycling performance for lithium storage devices.

The lithium storage properties of the obtained Zn2GeO4 nanospheres were also evaluated at room temperature. The CV curves of the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres with a voltage range from 0.01 to 3 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. 5a. In the first discharge curve, a broad cathodic peak located at 0.7 V which disappeared in the subsequent sweeps, corresponded to the irreversible reaction of Zn2GeO4 into Zn, Ge, Li2O and the formation of the SEI layer, similar to the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres. After the first sweep, the pair of reversible redox peaks at 0.02 V and 0.3 V can be assigned to the signature of the reversible Li-alloying reactions of Ge and Zn, respectively. The other peak located at about 2.7 V presented the reoxidation of Zn and Ge. Fig. 5b shows the voltage-specific capacity profiles of the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres for the 1st, 10th, 30th, 50th and 100th charge–discharge cycles between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 respectively. The first discharge and charge capacities were 1520 and 696 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 45.8%. The discharge capacities for the 10th, 30th, 50th and 100th cycles were calculated to be around 545, 547, 489 and 488 mA h g−1, respectively.

(b) 1st, 10th, 30th, 50th and 100th lithium-insertion/extraction curves between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. (c) Cycling performance at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. (d) Rate performance at different current densities (0.1–1 A g−1). 

Fig. 5c shows the discharge–charge capacities of the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres as a function of the cycle number up to 200 cycles. It clearly revealed that, except for the irreversible capacity for the first four discharges, the following charge–discharge capacities in the regime of measurement appeared to be stable with the specific capacity of about 480 mA h g−1, indicating a high capacity and charge–discharge reversibility of the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres. The rate capability was also evaluated at different current densities, and for each current density, 10 cycles were performed. As shown in Fig. 5d, the charge/discharge rates were modified to increase from 0.1 A g−1, stepwise to 0.2, 0.5, 1 A g−1, and then back to 0.2 A g−1 and 0.1 A g−1, respectively. The corresponding discharge capacities changed from 652, 505, 387 and 207 mA h g−1, and finally reversed back to 500 and 645 mA h g−1, indicating the excellent rate performance of the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres.
Similar to the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres and the Zn2GeO4 nanospheres, the electrochemical performance of the synthesized SrGe4O9 nanospheres as an anode for lithium-ion batteries was also characterized. Fig. 6a shows the CV curves with the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Similarly, the cathodic peaks between 0.25 and 1.2 V in the first discharge curve can be attributed to the decomposition of SrGe4O9 accompanied by the formation of the SEI layer. In the subsequent curves, a pair of redox peaks at potentials around 0.02 V and 0.3 V can be ascribed to the reversible alloying reaction of Ge. The other oxide peak at about 2.7 V corresponded to the formation of SrO and GeO2.30,31 The voltage profiles of the anode at different cycles are shown in Fig. 6b. The initial discharge and charge capacities were about 435 and 396 mA h g−1, respectively, resulting in a high first coulombic efficiency of 89.6%. The discharge capacities for the 10th, 30th, 50th and 100th cycles were calculated to be around 401, 371, 369 and 367 mA h g−1, respectively. Fig. 6c depicts the discharge–charge capacities vs. cycle number at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, in which the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres delivered a stable specific capacity of 375 mA h g−1 even after 200 cycles exhibiting good cycling performance. The rate performance of the anode was further studied by cycling at different current densities varying from 0.1 to 1 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 6d, a good capacity retention was obtained at each current density. Cycling at a high current density of 1 A g−1, a high specific capacity of 200 mA h g−1 can still be obtained, exhibiting the outstanding rate performance of the SrGe4O9 nanospheres.

Room temperature gas sensors based on metal oxide nanostructures usually exhibited high sensitivity, excellent stability and workability under ambient conditions and have received great interest for use in environmental monitoring and other fields.32,33 Here, the gas-sensing properties of the as-synthesized metal germanate nanospheres were also investigated at room temperature by exposing the corresponding sensors to different volatile organic gases with the concentration of 500 ppm, including acetone, toluene, ethanol, chloroform, formaldehyde and ammonia gases, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the gas sensing performance of the three nanospheres to different gases. All the three nanospheres exhibited the highest response to ammonia compared with other gases with the same concentrations, indicating that they can be chosen as the sensing materials for ammonia sensors at room temperature.

In order to further evaluate the performance of the germanate nanospheres as room-temperature ammonia gas sensors, a series of related tests were performed, as depicted in Fig. 8. Fig. 8a demonstrates the real-time dynamic response curves of the sensors based on SrGe4O9, Zn2GeO4 and Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres upon exposure to 100 ppm NH3, respectively. The results revealed that among the three germanate nanospheses, the SrGe4O9 nanosphere based sensor showed the highest response to NH3 gas with a sensitivity of about 6.0, which is also much higher than that of other reported metal–oxide nanomaterial sensors.34–36 The response and recovery times of the SrGe4O9 based sensor were calculated to be 10 and 5 s, while the values for Zn2GeO4 and Ca2Ge7O16 based sensors were 18 and 2 s, 18 and 1.5 s, respectively. Fig. 8b–d depict the continuous real-time response and recovery curves of the three sensors upon exposure to NH3 with increased concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 ppm at room temperature. All the profiles clearly confirmed the excellent response to ammonia gas at room temperature. With increased NH3 concentration, the sensitivities of all the three sensors also gradually increased. Even at a very low NH3 gas concentration (10 ppm), the three sensors still achieved strong and stable signals, confirming their promising applications for highly sensitive ammonia detection. Since the stability of gas sensors is the key factor for their practical applications, we also studied the three sensors exposed to 100 ppm NH3 gas by continuously checking five exposure/recovery cycles at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 8e–g, no obvious changes happened on the response amplitudes or on the response and recovery times of all the three sensors, revealing their outstanding stability.

Conclusions
In summary, by a simple electrospraying process, a series of ternary germanate nanospheres (Ca2Ge7O16, Zn2GeO4, SrGe4O9) were successfully synthesized. The as-prepared germanate nanospheres are of high purity with a smooth surface. When applied as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, all the three samples exhibited excellent electrochemical lithium storage performances including high capacitance, outstanding cycling stability and good rate capacity. Among them, the Ca2Ge7O16 nanospheres showed the best cycling stability since the specific capacity was maintained at about 475 mA h g−1 with the charge–discharge current density of 0.2 A g−1 even after 500 cycles. Gas sensing performances of the synthesized germanate nanospheres were also investigated. Studies have revealed that the three germanate nanospheres exhibited excellent response to NH3 gas at room temperature with the features of excellent sensitivity and stability. The results in this work showed the great potential of the germanate nanospheres as anode electrodes for high performance lithium-ion batteries and room-temperature ammonia gas sensors.
