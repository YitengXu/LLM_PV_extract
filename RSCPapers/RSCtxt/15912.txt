    , Accepted 21st April 2013First published on 23rd April 2013AbstractA series of narrow band gap donor–acceptor type conjugated copolymers based on 2,6-linked anthracene derivatives are synthesized via Suzuki copolymerization. The resulting copolymers typically exhibit dual absorption characteristics in both solution and as thin films with optical band gaps in the range of 1.85–2.13 eV. By varying the substitutions from alkyloxy to aromatic thienyl and phenyl groups in the 9,10-positions of the anthracene unit, the constructed two-dimensional 2,6-linked anthracene structures lead to broader absorption, lower-lying highest occupied molecular orbitals, as well as improved charge carrier mobilities of the resulting copolymers relative to the alkyloxy side chain substituted counterparts. Additionally, it was found that the sizes of the substitutions in the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole acceptor also play an important role in the optoelectronic properties of these anthracene based conjugated copolymers. The best polymer solar cell device with a power conversion efficiency of 4.34% and a high open circuit voltage of 0.98 V was realized based on the resulting materials. Our results indicate that substantial optimization in the sizes and patterns of substitutions of both the 2,6-linked anthracene donor and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole acceptor may potentially lead to high performance narrow band gap copolymers for solar cell applications.
Introduction
Recently, considerable attention has been devoted to polymer solar cells (PSCs) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structures due to their unique advantages of low cost, flexibility, tunable electronic properties and being solution processable for large-area devices.1–9 Although significant progress, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9%, has been achieved, several issues still remain unsolved for the further improvement of device performance.10,11 One of the most challenging aspects is to develop electron-donating conjugated copolymers, which are supposed to exhibit ideal energy levels, a coplanar molecular structure, as well as good solution processability. Conjugated polymers with a donor–acceptor (D–A) type of architecture, which typically have electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) units alternating along the polymer main chain, have therefore emerged since the molecular frontier orbitals can be readily tuned by rational choice of the electron-donor and acceptor units.12,13 Specifically, it has been recognized that the electron-donating ability of the donor units should be relatively weak to ensure a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the resulting conjugated polymers, which is critical for the high open circuit voltages (Vocs) of the corresponding PSCs.14,15 Consequently, a variety of D–A type narrow band gap conjugated copolymers based on weak electron donors, such as fluorene,16,17 carbazole,18–20 silafluorene21 or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene22,23 have been recently designed and PSCs with excellent performances have been realized based on these materials.
To acquire good charge transport characteristics of conjugated copolymers, it is necessary to enhance the close packing of the polymer backbone by increasing the molecular coplanarity and rigidity. Anthracene derivatives are relatively weak donor units with enlarged planarity that can lead to the enhanced structural ordering of the resulting copolymers. Moreover, the incorporation of anthracene derivatives into the polymer main chain through its 9,10-positions24–27 or 2,6-positions,28,29 offers a flexible way to fine tune the optoelectronic properties of the corresponding copolymers. Hence, anthracene derivatives have been widely used as building blocks for conjugated copolymers that can be applied in high performance organic thin-film field effect transistors and polymer light-emitting diodes,30–35 while the application of anthracene derivatives in PSC materials has been rarely reported. Sonar et al. reported the D–A type of copolymer based on 2,6-linked anthracene as the donor unit and difuranyl diketopyrrolopyrrole as the acceptor exhibited a PCE up to 2.5% of PSCs.29 During the course of this work, Lidzey and co-workers reported an additional case of semiconducting copolymers with alternating 2,6-linked anthracene units flanked by either thienyl or dithienyl groups as donor units, and the resulting PSCs exhibited an impressive PCE up to 4.17%.36
In comparison to the analogous molecular framework of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, which is one of the state of the art building blocks for high performance PSC materials,37–41 anthracene is essentially a weaker electron donor that would potentially lead to a higher Voc of the resulting polymers,14,15 and the 9,10-positions of the central phenyl ring can allow for molecular design by introducing a variety of substitutions including aromatic substitutions to construct two-dimensional conjugated structures. Even though the specific impact of substituted groups on the photophysical, electrochemical properties and film morphology is very difficult to predict, it is still worth trying several types of substituents to get access to optimal polymer structures that can lead to improved device performances. Addressing this point, we developed a series of D–A type narrow band gap conjugated copolymers based on 2,6-linked anthracene derivatives with various substitutions of dodecyloxyl (12OA), 2-dodecylthiophene (12TA) and 4-dodecylphenyl (12BA) appended through 9,10-positions of the central phenyl ring as donor units, and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) flanked with thienyl groups with dodecyloxy- or octyloxy-substitutions as the acceptor unit. It was found that the solubility, absorption, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, charge carrier mobility, as well as the miscibility with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) of the resulting copolymers can be significantly influenced by the substitutions. The resulting PSCs exhibited a maximum PCE of 4.34% with a Voc of 0.98 V based on copolymer PBA8OTBT with a 12BA side group in the anthracene donor unit and an octyloxy side group in the BT acceptor unit.

Mass spectra were carried out on a ACQ-TQD#QBB1460 instrument. Melting points were measured on WRR (Shanghai Precision & Scientific Instrument Co.). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Netzsch DSC 204 under nitrogen flow at heating and cooling rates of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a Netzsch TG 209 under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation with a platinum working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 against an Ag/AgNO3 (3 M of KCl in acetonitrile) reference electrode with a nitrogen saturated anhydrous solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile (0.1 mol L−1). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out using a Digital Instrumental DI Multimode Nanoscope III in a taping mode.
Device fabrication and characterization
Before fabrication of the device, the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol and then dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. Polymer solar cells with inverted structures were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PFN-OX/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al under conditions as follows: a 5 nm thick layer of PFN-OX48,49 (poly[9,9-bis(6′-(N,N-diethylamino)hexyl)-fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)-hexyl)-fluorene]) was spin-coated on the ITO substrates and then the cross-linking process was done by heating the half-dried films under 150 °C for 20 minutes and fluorescence lamp illumination for 20 min. The copolymers and PC71BM were co-dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) in the weight ratios of 1:4 and the typical concentration of the copolymers/PC71BM blending solution used in this study was 7 mg mL−1. All the active layers were then spin-coated from the prepared blending solutions with a thickness of 90 nm. To complete the device fabrication, 10 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Al were subsequently thermally evaporated onto the active layer to form the top electrode of the device. Finally, post-annealing was carried out at 100 °C for 15 minutes. The effective device area was measured to be 0.16 cm2.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were investigated with a Keithley 236 source meter. The spectral responses were measured with a commercial photomodulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel). The EQEs (external quantum efficiencies) of the devices were recorded on a Hypermonolight System (CROWNTECH-1000).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of all the monomers and polymers are illustrated in Scheme 1. 2,6-Dibromo-9,10-anthraquinone (2) was obtained by the Sandmeyer reaction with 2,6-diamino-9,10-anthraquinone (1) as the starting material.42 2,6-Dibromo-9,10-bis(dodecyloxy)anthracene (3) was synthesized by the reaction of 2,6-dibromoanthraquinone (2) in one reductive alkylation with dodecyloxybromine employing Na2S2O4 in the phase-transfer catalysis. To synthesize 5,5′-(2,6-dibromoanthracene-9,10-diyl)bis(2-dodecylthiophene) (4) and 2,6-dibromo-9,10-bis(4-dodecylphenyl)anthracene (5), 2-docecylthiophene43 and 4-bromododecylbenzene44 were firstly treated with n-BuLi, then 2,6-dibromoanthraquinone (2) was reacted with resulting 2-dodecylthienyllithium or 4-dodecylphenyllithium followed by reduction with SnCl2·H2O in 20% HCl, respectively. Initial attempts to generate diboronic ester monomers 2,2′-(9,10-bis(dodecyloxy)anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (6), 2,2′-(9,10-bis(5-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (7) and 2,2′-(9,10-bis(4-dodecylphenyl)anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (8) by treatment of 3, 4 and 5 with n-butylithium in THF at −78 °C failed to give the target monomers due to the solubility issue. Monomers 6, 7 and 8 were alternatively prepared by a [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(dppf)2Cl2) catalyzed Miyaura reaction of 3, 4 and 5 with an excessive amount of 4,4,4′,4′,5,5,5′,5′-octamethyl-2,2′-bi(1,3,2-dioxaborolane), respectively with yields around 70%.

The D–A type of conjugated copolymers was acquired by Suzuki copolymerization of 6, 7 and 8 with 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(dodecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (9)45 and 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5,6-bis(octyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (10),46 respectively, and the corresponding copolymers are denoted as POA12OTBT, PTA12OTBT, PBA12OTBA, POA8OTBT, PTA8OTBT and PBA8OTBT, respectively. All copolymers were end-capped by adding bromobenzene and phenylboronic acid into the reaction before workup. After precipitation in methanol, solids were collected by filtration followed by purification with Soxhlet extraction with acetone and hexane subsequently to remove impurities and low molecular weight fractions, and were finally collected by using chloroform. The molecular structures of all intermediates, monomers and copolymers were verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectra. All copolymers exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene due to the solubilizing side groups in both anthracene and BT units. Uniform thin films can be readily formed from the corresponding solutions for all copolymers, indicating their great potential for applications in PSCs. The Mn of all copolymers are in the range of 14.8–28.6 kg mol−1, with corresponding polydispersity indexes (PDI) in the range of 1.65–3.32. The related data is summarized in Table 1.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the copolymers were evaluated by DSC and TGA. All copolymers exhibited good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) in the range of 287–349 °C (Table 1). However, no distinct glass transition temperature was observed from 30 to 250 °C in their DSC curves of the second heating and cooling runs (10 °C min−1) (see ESI†). The good thermal stability of the copolymers would retard the deformation of film morphology and the degradation of the active layer at elevated temperatures, which are desirable for PSC applications.50
Photophysical properties

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption profiles of all the copolymers in both chloroform solutions (ca. 2 mg mL−1) and as thin films. All copolymers showed standard dual absorption profiles of the D–A type of copolymers in both solution and as thin films, where the short wavelength peaks located at ca. 360 nm can be ascribed to the π–π* transition, and the long wavelength peaks located at ca. 490–560 nm that altered with different side groups can be attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between anthracene donors and BT acceptors.19
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of copolymers (a) in chloroform solution and (b) as thin films. 
From Fig. 1a, it can be found that copolymers POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT, which have alkoxy side chains in the anthracene donor unit, exhibit a ca. 35 nm hypochromatic shift of the long absorption band with respect to the other four copolymers (PTA12OTBT, PBA12OTBT, PTA8OTBT and PBA8OTBT) that have aromatic side groups. In addition, no distinct shoulders can be found for copolymers that have aromatic side groups, indicating the absence of intermolecular aggregations in such solutions. However, for the absorption profiles as thin films (Fig. 1b), copolymers bearing aromatic side groups in the anthracene unit displayed a more pronounced bathochromic shift and much broader profiles of the long absorption band than that of copolymers POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT bearing alkoxy side chains, which can be ascribed to the stronger intermolecular π–π stacking in thin films.37 The results indicated that the extension of anthracene derivatives to two-dimensional π-conjugated structures is an effective strategy to improve absorption of the resulting materials. It is noted that the absorption profiles of copolymers based on thienyl side groups exhibit a much stronger shoulder peak located at ca. 600 nm than the phenyl side groups version, indicating the superiority of the thienyl side groups. It is worth pointing out that the substitutions in the BT acceptor unit can also influence the absorption characteristics, as the copolymers PTA8OTBT and PBA8OTBT (octyloxy side chain) displayed stronger shoulder peaks than that of PTA12OTBT and PBA12OTBT (dodecyloxy side chain).
The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of the copolymers calculated from the onset absorption of the thin films are in the range of 1.85–2.13 eV. Copolymers POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT, which have alkoxy side chains in the anthracene donor unit, exhibited a comparable Eoptg of ca. 2.13 eV, which was much larger than that of ca. 1.85 eV of copolymers based on aromatic side groups. The detailed photophysical properties of copolymers are summarized in Table 2.

Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out under an inert atmosphere by using tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile) as the supporting electrolyte with a platinum button working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a Ag/Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) reference electrode. The potential of the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was measured as the standard. It is assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV to vacuum.51 Under the same experimental conditions, the half-wave potential of the Fc/Fc+ was measured to be 0.29 V related to the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Therefore, the HOMO energy levels of the copolymers were calculated according to the following equation,HOMO = −e(EOX + 4.51) (eV)where the EOX is the onset of the oxidation potential vs. Ag/Ag+. HOMO energy levels of copolymers were calculated to be in the range of −5.48 to −5.70 eV. The detailed electrochemical data is summarized in Table 2 and Fig. S3 in the ESI.†
It was observed that the HOMO energy levels of ca. –5.52 to −5.70 eV for copolymers bearing aromatic side groups are essentially lower than that of the ca. –5.48 eV for copolymers POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT that have alkoxy side groups as the anthracene side chain. When considering that the Voc of PSCs correlated with the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor materials and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the fullerene acceptors,52 a higher Voc can thus be anticipated for copolymers bearing aromatic side groups, that is, the anthracene moieties with two-dimensional structures. It should also be noted that the LUMO levels of all the polymers are more than 0.3 eV higher than that of the fullerene derivative of the PCBM acceptor, which can overcome the intrachain exciton binding energy and ensure the formation of a downhill driving force for the energetically favorable electron transfer.53,54
Hole mobility
In order to investigate the impact of various side groups on the charge carrier transport properties, the mobilities of copolymers were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.55,56 The measurements were from a hole only device with a configuration of Al/MoO3/copolymer:PC71BM (90 nm)/PEDOT:PSS/ITO following the similar procedures described above for photovoltaic devices. From the plots of J1/2vs. V (Fig. 2), hole mobilities of copolymers could be deduced from the following equation,  where J is the current, μ is the hole mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the polymer assumed to be 3 in every simulation, L is the thickness of the blend film equal to 90 nm, and V is the voltage drop across the device. V = Vappl − Vrs − Vbi, where V is the effective voltage, Vappl is the applied voltage, Vrs is the voltage drop, and Vbi is the built-in voltage.

The calculated hole mobilities are summarized in Table 2. It was found that the calculated hole mobilities for copolymers POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT that have an alkyloxy side chain in the anthracene unit are one order of magnitude lower than that obtained by the aromatic side group analogues, illustrating that anthracene donor units with two-dimensional structures can be more favourable for charge carrier transportation. Additionally, it was also found that copolymers PTA8OTBT and PBA8OTBT that have octyloxy side chains in the BT acceptor unit exhibited much higher hole mobilities than copolymers PTA12OTBT and PBA12OTBT that have dodecyloxy side chains in the BT unit, indicating the shorter side chain in the acceptor BT unit can also encourage charge carrier transportation, which was at least effective for the two-dimensional anthracene system. Nevertheless, the mobility data based on the SCLC method demonstrated that varying the size and pattern of side groups in both the anthracene donor and BT acceptor units will affect charge carrier transport properties.
Photovoltaic properties
Photovoltaic performances of the copolymers were measured under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 on the basis of BHJ solar cells with an inverted architecture of ITO/PFN-OX/copolymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Al, which has been proven to exhibit good air-stability and relatively high performance as well.57 The devices were fabricated by spin-coating the blends from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solutions with an optimized ratio of copolymer:PC71BM (1:4, wt:wt). Here a thin layer of PFN-OX (ca. 5 nm) was spin-coated on the top of ITO as the interlayer since it can effectively reduce the work function of ITO, which can consequently act as a cathode for the device with inverted architecture.48,49,58 The measured photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3 and the J–V characteristics of all PSC devices are shown in Fig. 3.

As shown in Table 3, PSC devices based on copolymers POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT which have an alkyloxy side chain in the anthracene donor units exhibited relatively low PCEs of 2.26% and 1.82%, respectively with Vocs of 0.78–0.84 V and Jscs of 5.69–6.59 mA cm−2. The replacement of the alkyloxy side chains with aromatic thienyl or phenyl side groups lead to dramatically improved performances with PCEs higher than 3%, which originated from the distinctly improved Voc to 0.90–0.98 V due to lower-lying HOMO energy levels, in conjunction with the obviously increased Jsc of 8.58–9.57 mA cm−2, indicating the superiority of the extended two-dimensional structures of anthracene donor units. The best PSC device performance was achieved based on copolymer PBA8OTBT, which exhibited a PCE of 4.34% with a Voc of 0.98 V, Jsc of 9.57 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.48. It was noted that copolymers PTA8OTBT and PBA8OTBT which have shorter octyloxy side chains in the BT acceptors, resulted in a slightly elevated Jsc with respect to that of the longer dodecyloxy side chain counterparts, which was consistent with the higher hole mobility of the former.
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to examine the influence of surface topographic features of BHJ films of polymer:PC71BM by varying side groups in both the anthracene donor and BT acceptor units of copolymers. The BHJ films were prepared in the same conditions as those for photovoltaic properties measurements and the surface topographic images are shown in Fig. 4.59,60 One can clearly observe that the BHJ films based on POA12OTBT and POA8OTBT, which have alkyloxy side chains in the anthracene unit, are relatively rough, with the room-mean-square roughness (RMS) values of ca. 3.0 and 3.8 nm, respectively. The obvious circular aggregations with sizes of ca. 250 nm and 140 nm across the film, which may originate from the limited miscibility of copolymers with PC71BM or poor adhesion with the PFN-OX substrates, can eventually lead to inferior device performances. In contrast, relatively smooth films with an rms value in the range of ca. 0.4–1.8 nm are realized for copolymers bearing aromatic side groups in the anthracene unit, while the aforementioned aggregation features can only be recognized in PTA12OTBT with a dilute distribution but slightly larger size of ca. 400 nm.
 Fig. 4  Surface topographic AFM images (5 μm × 5 μm) of POA12OTBT (a), PTA12OTBT (b), PBA12OTBT (c), POA8OTBT (d), PTA8OTBT (e) and PBA8OTBT (f). 
However, it is worth noting that copolymer PTA8OTBT bearing the thienyl side group (12TA) in the anthracene unit, which has a much broader absorption, higher hole mobility, comparable molecular weight and HOMO energy level, unexpectedly exhibits a lower PCE of 3.33% than that of the analogous PBA8OTBT which has a phenyl side group (12BA) in the anthracene unit. We initially hypothesized that a possible reason for the low PCE in terms of a smaller Jsc which may account for severe phase separation of PTA8OTBT with PC71BM, however, this can be ruled out as no distinct differences between the two surface topographic images (Fig. 4e and f) and both films exhibited a small domain size of ∼20 nm that is beneficial for exciton separation.61 Thereby, the low PCE of PTA8OTBT may attribute to the unfavourable phase separation that cannot result in a bicontinuous interpenetrating network for effective charge carrier transportation.62,63 Further X-ray analysis may provide insight into the impact of side groups on the nanostructures of BHJ films. Nevertheless, these observations apparently suggested the dramatic influence of varying sizes and patterns of substitutions in both the anthracene donor and BT acceptor units on device performances and film morphology of PSCs.
To confirm the PCEs, the EQEs of all devices based on copolymers:PC71BM illuminated with monochromatic light were investigated and the characteristics are shown in Fig. 5. The devices based on PBA8OTBT showed a very efficient photoresponse in the broad range from 300 to 700 nm and the EQE over 50% was observed in a broad range from 380 to 580 nm. The integrals of the EQEs were in accordance with the Jsc measured from the PSC devices.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a series of donor–acceptor type of narrow band gap conjugated copolymers based on 2,6-linked anthracene derivatives as donor units and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) derivatives as acceptor units were synthesized. It was recognized that the side groups in both the anthracene donor and BT acceptor units can significantly impact the photophysical, electrochemical, charge carrier transport, as well as the bulk-heterojunction film morphology, and eventually resulted in different solar cell efficiencies. The aromatic thienyl and phenyl substitutions appended on the 9,10-positions of anthracene unit lead to two-dimensional structures that can provide lower-lying HOMO energy levels, improved hole mobility, along with superior blend film morphology with respect to the alkyloxy substitutions counterparts. In combination with PC71BM, polymer solar cells based on copolymers bearing phenyl side groups in the anthracene unit attained the best performances, and which exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 4.34% with a high open circuit voltage of 0.98 V. Our observations suggested that substantial optimization in the sizes and patterns of substitutions of 2,6-linked anthracene based narrow band gap copolymer would provide superb candidates for high performance polymer solar cells.
