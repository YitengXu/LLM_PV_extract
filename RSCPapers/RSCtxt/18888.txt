    , Accepted 21st March 2018First published on 22nd March 2018AbstractDeveloping facile strategies that enable high-performance perovskite solar cell (PSC) fabrication in ambient air is appealing yet challenging for low-cost and large-scale industrial deployment. However, attempts in this regard are still limited to methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3), which lags significantly behind the rapid development of the state-of-the-art formamidinium (FA) based mixed perovskites. Here, a PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complex is proposed to unlock the processing limitation and efficiently facilitate the growth of high-quality mixed-cation Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite films in ambient air with relative humidity (RH) as high as 70 ± 10%. It is found that the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x (x = 0.2 to 0.4) intermediate complex consisting of a mixture of composites is favorable for the conversion of PbI2 to high-quality Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite. Eventually, it reduces the required FAI concentration deposited on the intermediate for the conversion of PbI2 to perovskite, which allows the strong hygroscopic FAI to be processed in ambient air. With the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.3 intermediate complex, a low-temperature air-processed planar Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 PSC achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.56% with superior thermal-stability and photo-durability, demonstrating its great potential for the large scale development of PSCs.
Introduction
Since the pioneering work reported in 2009, organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the fastest-growing photovoltaic technology to date, whose power conversion efficiency (PCE) has skyrocketed from 3.8% to 22.1% in less than nine years.1–3 Generally, organometal halide perovskites adopt a chemical formula of ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation (e.g., CH3NH3+, CH2(NH2)2+, and Cs+), and B stands for Pb2+ or Sn2+, while X is a halide anion (e.g., Cl−, Br−, and I−). During the early development, PSCs were mainly based on methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3). However, due to the volatile nature of MA, MAPbI3 cannot withstand temperatures even as low as 85 °C. In addition, the acidic nature of MA makes it vulnerable when exposed to an ambient atmosphere.4 These undesirable intrinsic attributes of MAPbI3 largely impede the wide application of PSCs.5 Alternatively, it becomes evident that formamidinium lead triiodide (HC(NH2)2PbI3, FAPbI3) appears to be a better choice by virtue of its narrow band gap (∼1.47 eV) and relatively superior atmospheric stability. Eventually, the mixed perovskites based on FA have already become a major research avenue in the community.6,7
The main drawback of FAPbI3 is that its perovskite-phase (α-phase) can only be stabilized with temperatures above 150 °C, and α-phase FAPbI3 tends to revert to a non-perovskite (δ) phase at its working temperatures, which drastically compromises its photovoltaic performance. To this end, multi-cation engineering, particularly with MA or cesium (Cs) incorporation, has been proposed and successfully demonstrated as an efficient approach to suppress the δ-phase in FAPbI3. To date, an overwhelming majority of the PSCs producing PCEs more than 20% are based on either MA–FA or Cs–MA–FA mixed perovskites. In spite of such high efficiency, the stability of MA contained perovskites is still under hot debate.4 As highlighted by Gratzel et al. and McGehee et al., solely incorporating MA cannot solve the thermal- and photo-instability stemmed from the acidic and volatile nature of MA.4,8,9 On the other hand, Cs incorporated MA-free CsxFA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.1–0.2) perovskites, with PCEs ranging from 15.69% to 19.57%, have recently been demonstrated as a promising alternative with superior thermal stability and photo-durability.8–16 With these advantages, it is clear that compared to MA based perovskites, their FA counterparts have better prospects for commercialization. Nevertheless, due to the strong hygroscopic nature of FAI, all reported high-efficiency FA based perovskites are fabricated under harsh conditions (e.g., glovebox), where the moisture and oxygen contents are controlled at the ppm level. Eventually, the industrial development of PSCs in such an environment leads to an extremely high-cost, losing its competitiveness to the existing well-established silicon based technology.2 Therefore, it is of great significance to explore facile yet efficient strategies that enable the fabrication of FA mixed perovskite based PSCs in ambient air; however, research in this regard remains in its infancy.
As summarized in Fig. S1 and Table S1,† the development of air-processed PSCs is almost limited to MAPbI3. In addition to the search for intrinsically more stable perovskites (e.g., MAPbIx(SCN)1−x, CsPbBr3 and CsPb0.9Sn0.1IBr2),17–19 the research on high-performance air-processed PSCs mainly relies on the rational design of fabrication processes, such as additive engineering,2,20,21 flowing air assisted methods22,23 and preheating assisted methods.24,25 Among them, the preheating strategy appears to be a simple, controllable and efficient method for the fabrication of high-performance PSCs in humid air. Recently, through a preheating-assisted two-step spin coating method, our group has achieved a high PCE of over 18% for low-temperature processed planar MAPbI3 PSCs in ambient air (RH: 70 ± 10%).25 It is worth mentioning that the combination of ambient air processing and low temperature is beneficial for the future low-cost industrial production of PSCs.26 However, FA with two ammonium groups is known to be more sensitive to moisture than MA,27,28 and it is questionable if high-quality FA based perovskites can be obtained by simply applying the above methods. Therefore, investigation on the air-processability and the corresponding crystal growth mechanism of these state-of-the-art FA based mixed perovskites is of utmost importance for their future large-scale development.
Here, we present a PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complex, coupled with a preheating approach, to prepare high-quality Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 films in ambient air (RH: 70 ± 10%). It is found that the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complex formed in the first step can efficiently facilitate the conversion of PbI2 to Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 with a low concentration of FAI in the second step. Benefiting from the low-concentration FAI and preheating-induced rapid solvent evaporation, the impact of moisture ingress during the spin coating process is effectively suppressed, thus ensuring the formation of a high-quality perovskite film without any pinholes. With the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.3 intermediate complex, the low temperature planar PSCs with Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite yield an average and champion PCE of 14.21 ± 0.75% and 15.56%, respectively, and show superior thermal stability and photo-durability. Our work demonstrates high-performance air-processed PSCs with a FA–Cs mixed perovskite for the first time and provides valuable insights into the understanding of FA based perovskite film formation in humid air.
Experimental
Materials
Formamidinium iodide (FAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) were purchased from Dyesol and Acros, respectively. Cesium iodide (CsI), anhydrous N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chlorobenzene (CB), toluene and isopropanol (IPA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Poly-(4-butylphenyl diphenylamine) (poly-TPD) was bought from Xi'an Polymer Light Technol. Corp. All chemicals were directly used as received.
Perovskite preparation
In our proposed method (denoted as the coupled method), the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI) intermediate complex films were first deposited on preheated poly-TPD/ITO substrates (80 °C) by spin-coating a hot precursor solution (80 °C) at 3000 rpm for 40 s, during which 200 μl toluene was poured onto the substrate. The precursor solution consists of 461 mg PbI2, 39 mg CsI, 79 μl DMSO, 1 ml DMF and different amounts of FAI. The amount of CsI is set constant, corresponding to an atomic ratio of 15%, whereas the atomic ratio of FAI ranges from 0 to 85% (corresponding to PbI2). The intermediate complex films, except for the case of PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.85, were then annealed at 80 °C for 5 min, followed by the spin-coating of FAI (30 mg ml−1 in IPA) at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The resulting perovskite precursor films were finally annealed at 140 °C for 1 h and washed by spin-coating with 100 μl IPA. All the above processes were carried out in ambient air with a RH of 70 ± 10%.
For comparison, devices were also fabricated by premixing-only, preheating-only and non-intermediate methods. In the case of the premixing-only method, the amount of FAI premixed into the precursor solution in the first step corresponded to an atomic ratio of 30% (relative to PbI2), and all the precursor solutions and substrates were at room temperature without any preheating. All other procedures were the same as the coupled method. In the cases of the latter two, as compared to the coupled method, the only difference lied in the precursor solutions. Specifically, for the non-intermediate method, the precursor in the first step was changed to a hot PbI2 solution (461 mg PbI2 in 1 ml DMF and 79 μl DMSO, 80 °C), and the precursor solution in the second step was changed to a hot CsI/FAI IPA solution (12 mg CsI and 45 mg FAI in 1 ml IPA, 80 °C). As for the preheating-only method, the precursor solution in the first step consisted of 461 mg PbI2, 39 mg CsI, 79 μl DMSO and 1 ml DMF, while the precursor solution in the second step was a hot FAI solution (45 mg ml−1 in IPA).
Device fabrication
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were successively washed with decon 90, deionized water and isopropanol and dried in an oven. Prior to device fabrication, the ITO glass substrates were subjected to an ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment for 20 min. After that, a poly-TPD in CB solution, with a concentration of 4 mg ml−1, was spin-coated on the ITO at 6000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. To tune its surface hydrophilicity, the poly-TPD layer was subjected to a UVO exposure for 20 s.29 Afterwards, the perovskite layer was deposited onto the modified poly-TPD according to the methods described above. Subsequently, a 20 nm-thick fullerene layer (C60), 8 nm-thick 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline layer (BCP) and Ag electrode (70 nm) were successively deposited atop by thermal evaporation. The active area of the device was 0.1 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was monitored by scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30 FEG). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer model Lambda 2S). As the substrate has a huge impact on the quality of the perovskite film atop, the samples used for UV-vis measurement have the configuration of perovskite/poly-TPD/ITO. Prior to the measurement, two identical poly-TPD/ITO substrates were used for calibration, one of which was then replaced by the samples, and the other was used as the reference. The detector automatically recorded the intensity of the incident light passing through the sample and reference, which were termed as I and Io, respectively, thus acquiring the absorption spectra. The thickness of the perovskite films was determined by using a surface profilometer (Veeco Dektak 150). X-ray diffraction characterization was carried out on a D2 Phaser instrument with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were acquired on a time correlated single photon counting spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments (LifeSpec II), and the samples were excited with a 485 nm laser. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were obtained on a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), and the scan rate was 10 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency and device reflectance measurements were conducted on a home-built set-up.30,31 The photo-durability was tested by tracking the current density of a continuously working device (unencapsulated) exposed to one sun illumination in ambient air (RH: 70 ± 10%), and the device was subjected to a voltage bias of 0.76 V, corresponding to its maximum power point. The thermal stability was evaluated by measuring the J–V characteristics of the devices (85 °C, unencapsulated) every few hours in ambient air (RH: 70 ± 10%).
Results and discussion
The device fabrication procedures using the coupled method are illustrated in Fig. 1. The preheating approach as we previously demonstrated is employed to induce rapid solvent evaporation to oppose moisture ingress during the spin-coating process.25 It is worth noting that the successful conversion of PbI2 to perovskite in the two-step method relies on the intercalation efficiency of FAI or MAI into PbI2 crystals. However, during the conversion process, there is a significant crystal volume expansion on the surface,32 which hinders the further intercalation of MAI or FAI into the underneath PbI2, resulting in substantial PbI2 residue and incomplete conversion.32–34 Recently, T. Zhang et al. demonstrated that using a PbI2–(MAI)x intermediate can induce pre-expansion of PbI2 and thus facilitate the rapid conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3.33 However, as FA+ cations (2.79 Å) are larger than MA+ cations (2.70 Å)35 and PbI2 on the planar substrate has a large grain size,36 it is unclear if such PbI2–(FAI)x intermediates can facilitate the growth of Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 in a planar PSC in air. Therefore, we deliberately prepared PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complexes with various FAI contents in the first step to investigate such a pre-expansion effect on the perovskite crystal growth. Meanwhile, the additional CsI in the intermediate is aimed to obtain a stoichiometric ratio of Cs incorporation in the final perovskite films.

The morphologies of the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate films are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2. It is evident that the morphologies of these intermediate films are strongly dependent on the amount of FAI in the precursor solution. Specifically, with the absence of FAI (x = 0), the intermediate of PbI2–(CsI)0.15 shows a distinctive porous structure consisting of a network of needle-like nanorods (Fig. 2a). The nanorod structure suggests an anisotropic growth of PbI2–(CsI)0.15 in preferred orientation. With the molar ratio of FAI increases to 10% (x = 0.1) corresponding to the PbI2 content, the nanorods start to merge together with smaller-sized pores in the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.1 film (Fig. 2b). With further increasing the FAI amount (x = 0.2 to 0.6), the porous structure disappears, and the intermediate films become more homogeneous. This suggests the successful incorporation of FAI in the intermediate films, and the growth of PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x is isotropic (Fig. 2c–f).33,37

In order to get insights into the crystal structure of the intermediate films with different FAI contents, the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are acquired, as displayed in Fig. 3. It is shown that in addition to the diffraction peaks originated from the ITO substrate, the PbI2–(CsI)0.15 intermediate (x = 0) merely exhibits a weak and board diffraction peak located at 13.2° corresponding to the δ-phase of CsPbI3.38 This suggests that the premixed CsI has been at least partially coordinated with PbI2 to form CsPbI3, while the absence of peaks at 12.7° indicates that the remnant PbI2 is amorphous. When x is increased to 0.1 and 0.2, the weak peak at 13.2° gradually shifts to 12.7°, corresponding to the (001) facet of PbI2. This indicates that with the presence of FAI, the PbI2 has low crystallinity; a similar phenomenon has been reported in a PbI2–(MAI)x intermediate,33 and the formation of δ-phase CsPbI3 has been suppressed. Interestingly, with further increasing x to 0.3 and 0.4, besides a slight shift of the strong diffraction peak at 12.8°, a new set of peaks at 22.6°, 38.7°, 46.0° and 52.4° have been observed. This agrees well with the previously obtained XRD pattern of the (FAI)0.4–PbI2 intermediate, where the strong peaks at 12.8° and 22.6° correspond to the (001) and (100) facets of crystalline PbI2–FAI, respectively.37 With further increasing the FAI content to 0.6, the (100) peak of PbI2–FAI at 22.6° becomes the most predominant peak, implying that the preferred crystal orientation of the intermediate films has been transformed from the (001) to the (100) facet (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of FAI (marked by wine triangles) are also observed, which suggests that the excess FAI is separated from the PbI2–FAI intermediate.

Although the formation of FAI–PbI2 intermediates is confirmed by the XRD results, it is only limited to those crystalline phases. We sought to have a more comprehensive analysis of any unidentified amorphous phases using invasive PL measurements. As shown in Fig. 3c, in the case of x = 0, there is merely a PL peak located at around 545 nm, attributed to either PbI2 or δ-CsPbI3 or the combination of both.39,40 Interestingly, in the cases of x = 0.3 and 0.6, besides the PL peak indexed to PbI2, we observe an additional broad and asymmetric peak in the range of 600–800 nm. The presence of the PL peak at around 550 nm in all cases suggests the existence of crystalline or amorphous PbI2. In the cases of x = 0.3 and 0.6, it is highly possible that the minor XRD peak of crystalline PbI2 at 12.7° observed for x = 0.2 is overlapped by the strong peak of the PbI2–FAI intermediate at 12.8°. Undoubtedly, the appearance of the broad and asymmetric PL peak at 600–800 nm is not simply due to a single crystalline intermediate, but a composite of PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x in both crystalline and amorphous phases.41,42 Besides, the lattice structural changes of PbI2 induced by FAI intercalation may also play a role in it. It is demonstrated that foreign molecule intercalation into the PbI2 lattice can cause distortions in its lamellar structure, which affect its electronic energy structure, thus leading to additional PL peaks or peak shift in the absorption spectrum.43,44 As demonstrated by Wu et al., amorphous PbI2 is favourable for the efficient growth of perovskite,44 and the presence of the amorphous phases in the intermediate might also be more beneficial for the perovskite conversion compared to pure crystalline PbI2.
Based on the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complex, Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite films are prepared by spin-coating a hot FAI solution (80 °C) in ambient air, followed by thermal annealing at 140 °C for an hour. For comparison, a Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 film is also prepared by a preheating-assisted one-step spin coating method, which can be regarded as the perovskite derived from the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.85 intermediate (x = 0.85). The SEM images of the resulting perovskite films are shown in Fig. 4 and S2.† It is noted that the perovskite films derived from PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x (x = 0–0.4) all show densely packed structures without any pinholes, although in the case of x = 0, obvious unreacted PbI2 can be observed on the surface (Fig. 4a). Moreover, in the cases of x = 0.1 and 0.2, the perovskite films show a relatively small grain size, which is probably attributed to the FAI depletion terminating the perovskite growth. In comparison, when x = 0.3, the perovskite exhibits the best morphology in terms of grain size and film uniformity (Fig. 4d), while with further increasing x to 0.4, the perovskite crystals tend to have a high aspect ratio (Fig. 4e). These high-aspect-ratio perovskite crystals become more noticeable when x = 0.6, simultaneously with the presence of abundant pinholes as well as a rough surface (Fig. 4f). With further increasing x to 0.85, the perovskite exhibits a porous film with abundant pinholes (Fig. S2†). Considering that the only difference among the formation processes of the perovskites is the different FAI content in the intermediate films, we reason that the presence of the pinholes should be attributed to the effect of moisture, as the FA component is known to be very hydroscopic.45

Besides the film morphology, the crystal composition (e.g., crystal phase and PbI2 residue) and structure (e.g., crystallinity and crystal orientation) are critical to the photovoltaic properties of perovskites. It is found that the FAI content in the intermediate not only determines the amount of residual PbI2, but also affects the crystallinity and preferred crystal orientation of the final perovskite films. Fig. 5a shows the XRD patterns of the perovskites derived from the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate films (x = 0–0.85). It is found that noticeable diffraction peaks at 12.7° corresponding to substantial PbI2 residue are observed in the cases of x = 0, 0.1, and 0.85. The PbI2 residue in the cases of x = 0 and 0.1 is probably due to FAI depletion and the suppressed FAI intercalation into the underneath PbI2. In the case of 0.85, besides PbI2 residue, the presence of δ-FAPbI3 is also verified by the diffraction peak at 11.9°, which is caused by the moisture-induced uncontrollable and randomly oriented perovskite crystallization.25,46 In contrast, when x = 0.2 to 0.6, the perovskites are of high purity, and the major diffraction peaks at 14.1°, 24.4° and 28.3° are indexed to the (110), (202) and (220) facets, respectively. Particularly, in the cases of x = 0.2 to 0.4, the intensity of (110) and (220) peaks is very strong, along with a preferred crystal orientation of the (110) facet (Fig. 5b). It is known that high crystallinity and the preferred crystal orientation of the (110) facet are desirable for the photovoltaic performance.44,47 Interestingly, when x is increased from 0.3 to 0.4, there is an obvious increase in the relative intensity of the (202)/(110) peak. With further increasing x to 0.6, the (202) peak becomes the most dominant peak, indicating that the preferred perovskite crystal orientation is changed from the (110) to the (202) facet. Such a crystal orientation change might be responsible for the high-aspect-ratio crystals observed in the SEM images (Fig. 4e and f); a similar correlation between the morphology variation and MAPbI3 perovskite orientation has recently been reported.48,49 Moreover, we found that there is a subtle correlation between the crystal orientation of the intermediate complex and the final perovskite film. Specifically, the relative intensity of (001)/(100) peaks of PbI2–FAI in the intermediate films determines that of (110)/(202) peaks in the final perovskite films (Fig. S3†); detailed discussion can be found in the ESI.† In addition, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectra of the perovskite films indicate that except for x = 0.85, all perovskite films feature a sharp absorbance edge and strong absorbance (Fig. 5c), which is due to the high intrinsic absorption coefficient of perovskite which ensures efficient incident light absorption at a thickness of around 500 nm.50,51 Among them, the perovskite film derived from PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.3 exhibits the strongest absorbance. With these results, we speculate that the air-processed perovskite films derived from PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x (x = 0.1 to 0.4) hold great potential in achieving high-performance PSCs.

Planar PSCs with the structure of ITO/poly-TPD/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/C60/BCP/Ag are fabricated, and their photovoltaic performances are compared, as illustrated in Fig. 6 and Table 1. It is found that in the case of x = 0, the device delivers a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.78 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V and a fill factor (FF) of 51.91%, yielding a PCE of only 7.70%. The poor PCE is mainly ascribed to the substantial PbI2 residue acting as a recombination center and the low crystallinity of the perovskite (Fig. 5a).52 When x is increased to 0.1 and 0.2, the PSCs achieve remarkably enhanced PCEs of 12.47% and 14.54%, respectively, which arise from the significant increase of Jsc, Voc and FF. Such an obvious performance enhancement can be explained by considerably decreased PbI2 residue and increased perovskite crystallinity reducing the energy disorder (Fig. 5b).53 Benefiting from the improved film morphology, strong absorbance and high crystallinity, the PSC derived from PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)0.3 exhibits the highest PCE of 15.56%, with a Jsc of 23.36 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.00 V and a FF of 66.60%. However, when x is increased to 0.4, a slightly compromised PCE of 14.86% is recorded, probably due to the decreased crystallinity and less preferred (110) crystal orientation (Fig. 5b).46 As expected, when x = 0.6 and x = 0.85, the PCE drastically drops to 4.75 and 3.98%, respectively, which is mainly due to the abundant pinholes, undesired crystallinity, and so forth.

For further demonstration, external quantum efficiency (EQE) and device reflectance measurements are performed, and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is approximately calculated according to the equation IQE = EQE/(1 − device reflection).25,54–56 As shown in Fig. S4† and 6c and d, in all cases, the shapes of IQE profiles are quite similar to the corresponding EQE, and the devices derived from the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate films (x = 0.2–0.4) show relatively flat curves, with more than 80% EQE and 90% IQE over the wavelength range from 370 to 750 nm. The integrated Jsc deduced from EQE is 22.36, 23.08 and 22.71 mA cm−2 for x = 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4, respectively (Fig. 6e), which agree well with those obtained from J–V curves. Interestingly, when x < 0.2, the QE in the short wavelength region is obviously smaller than that in the long wavelength region; however, when x > 0.4, the QE shows an opposite trend. We assume that the vertical inhomogeneity of the perovskite layer and the interaction of perovskite/charge transport layer interfaces could be responsible for this phenomenon, but it still requires more dedicated investigations.
To validate the superiority of the coupled method, the photovoltaic performances of the devices based on perovskite films prepared by premixing-only, preheating-only and non-intermediate methods are compared. Given that in the preheating-only method, the PbI2 residue might be caused by insufficient FAI supply (30 mg ml−1) during the second step, an optimised concentration of FAI (45 mg ml−1) is taken for comparison (Fig. S5†). Meanwhile, the perovskite films and their corresponding devices prepared by a non-intermediate method are also evaluated (Fig. S7†). Detailed discussion can be found in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 7a and S7e and f,† the PSC based on the perovskite prepared by the coupled method shows the highest PCE of 15.56%, which outperforms that of the preheating-only (12.16%) and non-intermediate (12.23%) methods, and is far higher than that of the premixing-only method (5.88%). The low PCEs of the perovskite films prepared by preheating-only and premixing-only methods can both be mainly explained by the presence of pinholes (Fig. S5a and S6b†), whereas that for the non-intermediate method is probably a result of the undesirable purity, pinholes and surface roughness of the perovskite films (Fig. S7b–d†). The statistics of the PCEs of the devices in each case further confirm the superiority of the coupled method (Fig. 7b and S7f†).

For further demonstration, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskites prepared by premixing-only, preheating-only and coupled methods are recorded, as shown in Fig. 7c and d. It is found that all the perovskite films exhibit a distinctive PL peak at around 795 nm, and the highest peak intensity observed for the perovskite prepared by the coupled method indicates a suppressed non-radiative recombination induced by reduced traps and defects within the perovskite. Moreover, the PL lifetime calculated by fitting their time-resolved PL spectra with a single-exponential model57 is determined to be 52.5, 81.2 and 104.8 ns for perovskites prepared by the premixing-only, preheating-only and coupled methods, respectively. The variation in the PL lifetime is consistent with that observed from the steady-state PL spectra, suggesting that the perovskite prepared by the coupled method has the best film quality.
According to the above results, both preheating and FAI premixing are pivotal and simultaneous required for the formation of high-quality perovskite films without any pinholes in ambient air. In the case of the preheating-only method, as there is no FAI premixed, a high concentration of FAI in the second step is required to ensure the sufficient conversion of PbI2. Unfortunately, FA is very hygroscopic, and a high concentration of FAI, to some extent, cancels the positive effect of preheating on opposing moisture ingress. As previously validated, moisture in air induces fast and uncontrollable nucleation and crystallization of PbI2 and perovskites, which leads to some pinholes in the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. S5a.† Similarly, in the case of the premixing-only method, as FAI has been premixed to form the intermediate, a low concentration of FAI is sufficient for a desired PbI2 conversion. However, without preheating, FAI can readily absorb moisture in air, thus resulting in obvious pinholes in the perovskite film (Fig. S6b†). One the other hand, using the coupled method, the intermediate film with FAI pre-intercalated into the PbI2 layer facilitates the PbI2 conversion and allows a low concentration of FAI in the second step. Meanwhile, the preheating induces rapid solvent evaporation, which effectively eliminates the detrimental effect of moisture, thus guaranteeing the formation of high-quality perovskite films without any pinholes in humid air.
Devices stability is a crucial parameter for the commercialization of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 8a, the planar PSC shows a negligible J–V hysteresis, which is favourable for long-term device stability. Fig. 8b shows the temporal evolution of the PCEs of an unencapsulated device heated at 85 °C under ambient air (RH: 70 ± 10%). It is observed that after 24 hours, there is no obvious performance decay, suggesting its good thermal stability. In parallel, when exposed to one sun irradiation, the unencapsulated device shows a stabilized Jsc of 20.19 mA cm−2 at its maximum power point (Voc = 0.76 V) under continuous device operation for 10000 s, delivering a stabilized PCE of 15.34% (98.6% of the initial value), which demonstrates its outstanding photo-durability (Fig. 8c).

Conclusions
In summary, we develop a feasible synthetic protocol, whereby a PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complex is coupled with a preheating strategy, to fabricate high-quality FA-based perovskite films in ambient air, and demonstrate efficient air-processed PSCs with an FA based perovskite for the first time. It is found that the PbI2–(CsI)0.15–(FAI)x intermediate complex ensures complete PbI2 conversion with a low concentration of FAI in the second step, which unlocks the processing limitation in humid air. Benefiting from the low-concentration FAI and preheating-induced rapid solvent evaporation, the detrimental effect of moisture is effectively eliminated, thus guaranteeing the formation of high-quality perovskite films in ambient air. Importantly, the PSC based on the air-processed Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 perovskite achieves a champion PCE of 15.56%, along with superior thermal-stability and photo-durability. Our work not only paves a practical way for the fabrication of high-performance Cs–FA mixed perovskite based PSCs in ambient air, but also provides valuable insights into the understanding of FA based perovskite film formation in humid air.
