    , Accepted 14th September 2019First published on 4th October 2019AbstractNear-infrared (NIR) light has been widely applied in the field of photothermal therapy (PTT). Recent advances in the light wavelength for efficient cancer PTT have gradually shifted from the first NIR (NIR-I) biowindow (700–1000 nm) to the second NIR (NIR-II) biowindow (1000–1350 nm) owing to its intrinsic deeper tissue penetration ability and a higher maximum permissible exposure (MPE) value. Herein, we have prepared nickel sulphide (Ni9S8) nanoparticles (NPs) with a full-spectrum-absorption (400 nm–1100 nm) in the NIR region. By a fair comparison, it is found that the PTT using the NPs upon irradiation from an NIR-II (i.e., 1064 nm) laser is more efficient than that from an NIR-I (i.e., 808, 915, and 976 nm) laser. The large mass extinction coefficient value (22.18 L g−1 cm−1) and high photothermal conversion efficiency (46%) at 1064 nm make these NPs promising candidates for NIR-II photo-thermal therapy. This study will benefit future exploration and optimization of nickel-based photoabsorbers utilizing NIR-II light for photothermal applications.
1. Introduction
Photothermal therapy (PTT) using NIR laser radiation for tumor ablation has drawn extensive attention.1 The employment of an NIR laser as an external and remote stimulus brings high temporal and spatial control of local heating with minimized adverse side effects.2 To achieve effective tumor-tissue ablation, two essential criteria of NIR irradiation should be met, i.e., minimized tissue scattering and absorption to allow efficient tissue penetration while maintaining minimal tissue self-heating, and high photo-thermal conversion performance of the employed light-absorbing agents.1–6 It has been demonstrated that light in the second NIR (NIR-II) biowindow (1000–1350 nm) is more suitable for biological applications than that in the first NIR (NIR-I) biowindow (700–1000 nm).7 On the one hand, compared to the NIR-I window, working in the NIR-II window has two superior aspects, including a larger penetration depth and a higher maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to the laser.3 The expected maximal penetration depth is located at wavelengths of 1000–1100 nm, and the corresponding MPE for skin exposure is ∼1 W cm−2, compared to ∼0.72 W cm−2 for a 976 nm laser, ∼0.54 W cm−2 for a 915 nm laser and ∼0.33 W cm−2 for a 808 nm laser (from the American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers, ANSI Z136.1-2007).5,8 On the other hand, the fact that both blood and soft tissue are highly penetrable requires a deeper penetration depth of NIR light.9 Therefore, it is highly desirable to realize efficient PTT in the NIR-II biowindow, especially for eliminating deep-tissue-seated tumors. So far, nanomaterials that are known to be active in the NIR-II window for the PTT are restricted to copper sulphide-based nanoparticles (NPs)10 and two-dimensional nanosheets,2,6,10 gold nanostructures,4,9,11–13 Mxenes14 and large conjugated polymer particles.15–18 To the best of our knowledge, nickel sulphides in the NIR-II window for PTT have not been reported so far.
As Earth abundant, environmentally friendly and rich valence materials, the nickel chalcogenides have been extensively used in many fields from high-energy batteries to solar-energy devices.19–21 Recently, Zha and co-workers synthesized poly(acrylic acid)-functionalized Ni0.85Se NPs through a facile ambient aqueous precipitation method for the PTT of cancer, which have a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) of 54.06% at 808 nm.22 However, to date, no studies have been carried out to explore the nickel chalcogenides with strong absorption and high PTCE for cancer therapy in the highly tissue-penetrable NIR-II biowindow. What's more, the advantage of the NIR-II biowindow relative to the NIR-I biowindow remains experimentally unclear owing to the lack of adequate nanoplatforms for a fair comparison. Therefore, it is highly desirable to conduct such a comparative study on photothermal agents (PTAs) with well-defined size and absorption in both NIR-I and NIR-II regions, which requires precise control and tunability of the NIR absorption wavelength which is difficult for inorganic semiconductors.16,23–26
In this study, we prepared nickel sulphide (Ni9S8) NPs with a broadband absorption covering the entire UV-Vis-NIR range of 400–1100 nm through a modified two-phase approach reported before,27 and then coated these NPs with an amphiphilic polymer and bovine serum albumin (BSA-V) to be rendered hydrophilic and less bio-toxic for biomedical purposes.28–34 Compared to other NIR-II photothermal agents, our Ni9S8 NPs could be used as a photothermal agent with the full-spectrum (400 nm–1100 nm) range. As far as we know, this is the first time that the Ni9S8 NPs with a full-spectrum-absorption is reported here. The as-prepared Ni9S8 NPs possess a large extinction coefficient (22.18 L g−1 cm−1) and high PTCE (46%) at 1064 nm, which are sufficiently high for the photo-ablation of tumors. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments verified that they have satisfactory PTT efficacy. Most importantly, these NPs were used as a nanoplatform for a comparison of NIR-I (i.e., 808, 915, and 976 nm) and NIR-II (i.e., 1064 nm) lasers. It also demonstrated the superiority of the 1064 nm laser to the 808, 915, and 976 nm lasers for the PTT application. As a result, these Ni9S8 NPs possess great potential to be used as an effective NIR-II-window-responsive PTA in biological applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni (NO3)2·6H2O, ≥98.5%), sodium carbonate anhydrous (NaCO3, ≥99.8%), cyclohexane (C6H12, ≥99.7%), and chloroform (CHCl3, ≥99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). 1-Dodecanethiol (DDT, 98%) and oleylamine (C18: 80–90%) were purchased from Aladdin. Poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (Mw ∼ 6000 Da, 12–200 mesh (85%)) was purchased from Aldrich, and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF, ≥99.9%) was purchased from Labor (Shanghai, China). Bovine serum albumin (BSA-V) was purchased from Macklin. All the chemicals were used as-purchased without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of hydrophobic Ni9S8 NPs
Ni9S8 NPs were prepared via a modified two-phase method reported before.27 In a typical procedure, 0.5 mL of DDT was added to 20 mL of deionised water containing 0.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O under vigorous magnetic stirring for 30 min. The above mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and then sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 17 h. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature. The precipitates were washed with ethanol three times, and re-dispersed in ethanol for further characterization.
2.3. Synthesis of the amphiphilic polymer
The amphiphilic polymer synthesis was adapted from a published protocol.29 In a capped single neck round bottom flask, 100 mL of THF, 15 mmol (3.45 mL) of oleylamine, and 3.084 g of poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) were added sequentially to form a white turbid solution. The flask was sonicated for 1 min to suspend the insoluble polymer, and was heated at 60 °C for 3 h under vigorous stirring. The suspension became clear after 15 minutes of stirring. After 3 hours, the solution was cooled to room temperature and reduced in volume to 20 mL with a rotary evaporator. The clear solution was stirred vigorously again at 60 °C for 12 hours to ensure complete coupling between the polymer and oleylamine. The solution was cooled to room temperature and the remaining solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator, yielding the pale yellow, solid amphiphilic polymer. The solid polymer was transferred to a refrigerator (4 °C) and dissolved in 25 mL of anhydrous CHCl3 to give a monomer unit concentration of 0.8 M. The amphiphilic polymer solution was stored in a glass vial until use.
2.4. Synthesis of the Ni9S8-polymer
The Ni9S8 nanocrystals were first coated with the amphiphilic polymer following a literature method.29 The whole reaction process took place at room temperature. 10 mg of 1-dodecanethiol passivated Ni9S8 NPs (dried under vacuum at −50 °C) were dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous CHCl3 in a 50 mL round bottom flask and stirred for 2 h. Then 150 μL of amphiphilic polymer stock solution (0.8 M monomer units in CHCl3) was added under magnetic stirring for 3 h, and then sonicated for 1 h and stirred again for 30 min. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to yield a black Ni9S8-polymer film on the inner wall of the flask. 25 mL of aqueous sodium carbonate (1.25 g NaCO3) was added to the flask and sonicated for 1 min, and then stirred for 10 minutes to disperse the Ni9S8-polymer. Once suspended, the solution was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, the nanocrystals were dispersed in 10 mL of deionized water (1 mg mL−1) and stored in a glass vial under ambient conditions until use.
2.5. Synthesis of Ni9S8-polymer@BSA
The obtained polymer-modified NPs were soluble in water. To conjugate BSA to polymer coated NPs, BSA was added into the Ni9S8-polymer solution and kept in an ice-water bath with sonication for 1 h.28 The mass ratio of BSA to the Ni9S8-polymer is 20:1. The Ni9S8-polymer@BSA was centrifuged and washed three times with distilled water. The obtained NPs@ BSA were re-dispersed in distilled water for future use and stored at 4 °C.
2.6. Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a transmission electron microscope (TEM-2010F). UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra were obtained at room temperature using a UV-Visible-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-1902PC, Phenix). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed with a D/max-2550 PC X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku). X-ray photoelectron spectral (XPS) analyses were conducted using an ESCA-Lab 250Xi (Thermo Scientific) spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was carried out using an IR spectrophotometer (NICOLETNEXUS670). The concentration of nickel ions was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; Leeman Laboratories Prodigy).
2.7. Measurement of the photothermal effect
To evaluate the photothermal transduction of Ni9S8 NPs, 100 μL of Ni9S8 NP aqueous dispersions with different concentrations of nickel ions was irradiated with the 808 nm, 915 nm, 976 nm and 1064 nm lasers (Shanghai Xilong Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd, China), respectively. Temperature was monitored and imaged simultaneously using a thermal imaging camera (FLIR A300, USA). Following Roper's report3 and our previous reports,35,36 the photothermal conversion efficiency η was calculated using the following eqn (1): (1)where h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area of the container, Tmax is the maximum temperature of the sample, Tamb is the surrounding temperature, Q0 is the heat input due to the absorption of water, I is the laser power, and Aλ is the absorbance of the dispersion at the excitation laser wavelength. The value hA can be calculated using eqn (2): (2)where mD and cD are the mass (0.1 g) and the heat capacity (4.2 J (g °C)−1) of deionised water used as a solvent, respectively, and τs is the system time constant calculated from the pattern of the cooling curve, which could be derived from eqn (3): (3)
According to eqn (1)–(3), the η value of the Ni9S8 NPs can be calculated.
2.8. Calculation of the extinction coefficient
We measured the absorbance of the Ni9S8 NPs with different concentrations (i.e., 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 ppm) at 808, 915, 976, and 1064 nm, respectively. The extinction coefficient ε(λ) of the NPs is calculated using eqn (4) (Lambert–Beer law): A(λ) = εLC(4)where A is the absorbance at a wavelength of λ, L is the path length (1 cm), and C is the concentration of the NPs. The extinction coefficient ε is calculated by plotting the slope (in L g−1 cm−1) of each linear fit against wavelength.
2.9. 
          In vitro cellular experiment
HeLa cells were selected as an example of cancer cells to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the Ni9S8 NPs. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and incubated in the presence of 5% CO2 at 37 °C before use. For an in vitro cytotoxicity test, HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well. After 24 h, the top layer of the medium was removed and washed several times with PBS. Then the Ni9S8 NPs dispersed in DMEM with different concentrations (i.e., 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 ppm) were added to the wells. After 24 h, the culture media were changed back to fresh culture media, and 10% CCK8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) solution was added to each well to investigate the cell viability. For in vitro photothermal ablation of cancer cells, HeLa cell suspensions were dispensed in 200 μL centrifuge tubes (1 × 105 cells per tube) and incubated with Ni9S8 NPs (50 ppm). Then these cells were irradiated under the 1064 nm laser (0.7 W cm−2) for 10 min. In addition, these cells were also irradiated with 808 nm, 915 nm, 976 nm and 1064 nm lasers (under the MPE of 808, 915, 976 and 1064 nm lasers) for 10 min for a comparison. Subsequently, the cells were stained with both calcein AM and PI and then imaged using a Leica DMi8 fluorescence microscope. All of the tests were independently performed four times.
2.10. 
          In vivo photothermal therapy
The mice were injected subcutaneously with HeLa cells (5 × 106 per mouse) into the right thigh to develop the tumour model. When the tumour volumes reached ∼100 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into four groups (five mice each): (a) PBS injection only, (b) PBS injection with NIR laser irradiation, (c) Ni9S8 NP injection only and (d) Ni9S8 NP injection with NIR laser irradiation. At 30 min post-injection, the 1064 nm laser with a power density of 1 W cm−2 was used to irradiate tumours for 10 min. The tumour surface temperature was recorded using an IR thermal camera. After treatment, the body weight and tumour size were measured every two days. The relative tumour volume was calculated as V/V0 (V0: the tumour volume when the treatment was initiated). This study was performed in strict accordance with the Institutional Animal Care guidelines of Shanghai First People's Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University. All animal procedures were approved by institutional animal use and care committee and carried out ethically and humanely.
2.11. 
          In vivo toxicity and biodistribution
Healthy BALB/c mice were i.v. injected with the Ni9S8 NP aqueous dispersions (1000 ppm, 100 mL) and euthanized at the 4th, 9th and 30th days (five mice per time point) post-injection. Another five healthy BALB/c mice were used as the control. Before the mice were euthanized, blood samples (∼1 mL) were collected for blood biochemistry assay. Major organs of these mice were dissected and divided into two halves for histological examination and biodistribution measurement, respectively. For histological examination, the major organs including the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were dissected from each mouse, to make paraffin sections for further H&E staining, and then examined using the Leica DMi8 fluorescence microscope. For biodistribution measurement, major organs including the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were solubilized using aqua regia for ICP-AES measurement to determine the Ni content in different organs.
3. Results and discussion

Scheme 1a illustrates the synthetic approach of the polymer-coated nickel sulphide (Ni9S8) NPs. Hydrophobic Ni9S8 nanocrystals (NCs) were obtained between the organic phase (DDT) and aqueous phase (nickel salt solution) via a modified two-phase solvothermal method, and then coated with the amphiphilic polymer and BSA successively to be rendered hydrophilic and less biotoxic in biologically relevant media. A low-magnification TEM image in Fig. 1a depicts an overall view of the Ni9S8 NPs with good dispersibility. Star-like nanocrystals ranging from 50 to 90 nm can be seen in Fig. 1b. In the corresponding high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1b, inset) of a single NC, the marked lattice spacing of ∼0.18 nm corresponds well to the (153) planes of an orthorhombic Ni9S8 crystal. The DLS pattern of the Ni9S8 NPs was recorded, as shown in Fig. S1,† and the average size was estimated to be ∼150 nm due to the assembling NPs, as shown in Fig. 1a. As exhibited in Fig. 1c, the main planes in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the product match well with orthorhombic Ni9S8 crystals. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also conducted to investigate the surface chemical composition of the Ni9S8 NPs. There are two strong peaks at around 870.4 eV and 853.2 eV, which can be attributed to Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. S2a†). The binding energies of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 are approximately equal to the standard value for nickel doublet peaks (17.2 eV). The doublet peaks at 161.7 and 162.7 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 binding energies (Fig. S2b†). These values are similar to those for the 3D flower-like Ni7S6.19

For more feasible biocompatibility, the as-prepared Ni9S8 NPs were modified with the amphiphilic polymer and BSA. The amphiphilic polymer was composed of a hydrophilic poly(maleic anhydride) backbone with carboxyl groups and hydrophobic oleylamine sidechains.29 The NPs encapsulated by the polymer could form micelles in aqueous media such as water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) solutions. Moreover, the exposed carboxyl groups on the polymer backbones can be further functionalized with cell-targeting biomolecules such as proteins and antibodies.33 Based on that, the BSA protein was covalently conjugated to polymer-coated NPs via the formation of amide bonds between carboxylic groups in the polymer and amino groups of BSA to further enhance the bio-safety of NPs.32 As shown in Fig. 1d and Fig. S3,† photographs of the modified Ni9S8 NPs dispersed in water, PBS and DMEM solutions exhibit good dispersibility and stability, while the NPs without coating settled down in 24 h. The capping ligands on the surface of the Ni9S8 NPs before and after modification are identified from the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S4†). The transmission band at about 1750 cm−1 was assigned to the anhydride carbonyl group in the polymer, and the band at around 1545 cm−1 was assigned to the amide II band in BSA.31 The results proved that the polymer and BSA were successfully coated on the surface of NPs.
A broad absorption covering the entire UV-Vis-NIR region ranging from 400 to 1100 nm was the most striking feature of hydrophilic Ni9S8 NPs. Fig. 1e shows UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the Ni9S8 NPs dispersed in water with different concentrations at room temperature. The parallel and strong absorption could be attributed to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of free holes in Ni9S8 NCs. Moreover, the absorbance at 1064 nm (as well as 808 nm, 915 nm, and 976 nm) increased linearly as the concentration of the Ni9S8 NP dispersion increased, indicating no post-formed precipitates and excellent dispersibility (Fig. 1f and S5†). According to Lambert–Beer law3 (A/L = εC, where ε is the extinction coefficient), the mass extinction coefficient value of the Ni9S8 NPs was calculated to be 22.18 L g−1 cm−1 at 1064 nm (Fig. 1f), which was obviously higher than those reported for CuS (16.6 L g−1 cm−1),37 FeS (15.5 L g−1 cm−1),38 and Au nanorods (13.9 L g−1 cm−1)39 at 808 nm, and surpassing those of 2D Nb2C Mxenes (9.71 L g−1 cm−1) and Fe3O4@PPy@GOD NCs (2.61 L g−1 cm−1) at 1064 nm. Interestingly, the mass extinction coefficient value at 1064 nm was nearly identical to those at 808 nm (22.70 L g−1 cm−1), 915 nm (22.58 L g−1 cm−1) and 976 nm (22.43 L g−1 cm−1), which implied that the Ni9S8 NPs could be used as an effective and potential nano-platform for a fair comparison of lasers in the NIR-I and NIR-II windows.
The broad absorption range and large extinction coefficient guarantee their excellent photothermal conversion performance within both the NIR-I and NIR-II regions. Therefore, the photothermal properties of the Ni9S8 NPs were subsequently investigated and compared using the lasers from both the NIR-I and NIR-II windows. Under continuous laser irradiation at 808, 915, 976 and 1064 nm at a power density of 0.7 W cm−2, the temperature of the Ni9S8 NP dispersions at elevated concentrations increased and reached a plateau at t = 360 s (Fig. 2a–d). The temperatures of the solutions (100 ppm) irradiated with 808 nm, 915 nm, 976 nm and 1064 nm lasers increased by 35.5 °C, 34.6 °C, 31.5 °C and 23.0 °C, respectively, which corresponds to the absorption extinction coefficient of the NPs. Meanwhile, both the heating rate and the ending temperature increased with the concentrations of the nickel ions, demonstrating that the temperature could be precisely controlled by adjusting the nickel ion content. Notably, the temperature of pure water irradiated with the 976 nm laser increased by 11.7 °C, while the temperature of pure water irradiated with 808 nm, 915 nm and 1064 nm lasers increased by only 1.6 °C, 4.7 °C and 4.3 °C, respectively, which demonstrated the lower bio-safety of the 976 nm laser.8
 Fig. 2  Temperature changes of Ni9S8 NP aqueous dispersions with nickel ion concentrations of 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 ppm under irradiation of lasers at (a) 808, (b) 915, (c) 976, and (d) 1064 nm at a power density of 0.7 W cm−2 for 5 min, respectively. 
When comparing at their respective MPE limit for the practical purpose, the temperature change of the Ni9S8 solution irradiated with the 1064 nm laser (30.9 °C) was ∼1.4-fold that when irradiated with the 808 nm laser (22.1 °C) (Fig. 3a), and similar to that when irradiated with the 915 nm (30.4 °C) and 976 nm lasers (31.6 °C). While it should be noted that when comparing at the same power density (0.7 W cm−2) as evidenced in Fig. 2a–d, the temperature change of the Ni9S8 solution irradiated with the 1064 nm laser was ∼0.65-fold that when irradiated with the 808 nm laser, ∼0.66-fold that when irradiated with the 915 nm laser and ∼0.73-fold that when irradiated with the 976 nm laser. These data indicate the distinct limitation of the NIR-I lasers in bio-application and great potential for the 1064 nm laser in the PTT owing to its intrinsic higher MPE value than the NIR-I lasers. An evident temperature increase of the Ni9S8 NPs under 1064 nm laser radiation was further revealed by infrared photothermal images shown in Fig. S6.† The photothermal stability of the Ni9S8 NPs was demonstrated by five successive cycles of laser on/off procedures, showing that they are very stable during irradiation (Fig. 3b). For the study of the photothermal performance of the Ni9S8 NPs, their photothermal conversion efficiency was measured by Roper's method (see Materials and methods). According to the obtained data, we calculated the photothermal conversion efficiency at 808, 915, 976 and 1064 nm, and the value was 70.9%, 69.0%, 40.3% and 46.0%, respectively (Fig. S7†). It is worth noting that the photothermal-conversion efficiency at 1064 nm was higher (Fig. 3c and d) than those of many PTAs active in the NIR-II window.2,7,40,41 Therefore, the outstanding photothermal performance and high photostability verified the Ni9S8 NPs to have great potential in 1064 nm laser activated NIR-II PTT treatment.

(c) Photothermal effect of the Ni9S8 NP dispersion upon being irradiated for one procedure. (d) By applying the linear time data from the cooling period versus negative natural logarithm of driving force temperature, the time constant (τs) for heat transfer from the system is determined to be 63.7 s. 
As a proof-of-concept experiment to validate the tissue penetration performance at the NIR-I and NIR-II windows, we used chicken breast tissues with different thicknesses (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mm) as a model biological tissue to investigate the power density and temperature attenuation after the tissue penetration (Fig. 4a, b and S8†). As shown in Fig. 4c, through the same tissue thickness, it is significantly easier for the 1064 nm laser to penetrate the tissue compared to that by the 808, 915 and 976 nm lasers. For example, through 2 mm thick tissue, about 50% of 1064 laser energy successfully remained, while only about 22% of 808 nm, 28% of 915 nm and 33% of 976 nm laser energies were left. Moreover, the power density attenuation trend for the NIR-II laser (1064 nm) is evidently slower than that of the NIR-I laser (808, 915, and 976 nm), and this is mainly because living tissue absorption at the NIR-II window is far less than that at the NIR-I window. To emulate the clinical scenario, the temperature attenuation trend of the lasers was subsequently monitored using the Ni9S8 NP dispersions covered with chicken breast tissues with elevated thicknesses (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mm) (Fig. S8†). A higher power density (1 W cm−2) was applied in this procedure due to our significant consideration of superior anticancer efficiency from sufficient temperature elevation (>30 °C) by the 1064 nm laser irradiation.17 Temperature changes of the tissues above the Ni9S8 NP solutions under NIR-I and NIR-II laser irradiation were measured and are shown in Fig. 5a–d. Based on these data, the maximum temperature changes of the tissues under these different conditions were summarized and plotted as a function of tissue depth and fitted with exponential decay curves (y = y0 + A × exp (R0 × x)) (Fig. S9†), and here the A value of the lasers could serve as a criterion for assessing their attenuation trend. When comparing at the same power density, the attenuation trend of the 1064 nm laser (A = 27.95) was much slower than that of the 915 nm (A = 32.80) and 808 nm (A = 37.04) lasers, ignoring the “tissue-self-heating” 976 nm (A = 25.10) laser. Therefore, the 1064 nm NIR-II laser with a slower power density and temperature attenuation trend and higher bio-safety could serve as a prominent laser source. Such a consequence should be ascribed to the intrinsically deeper tissue penetration in conjunction with the higher MPE limit of the laser at the NIR-II window relative to that at the NIR-I window. It should be noted that a temperature increase of 15.2 °C was achieved with a tissue depth of 1 mm under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Considering the threshold temperature for the PTT (43 °C) and the average body temperature of living mice (∼30 °C during anesthesia), such a temperature increment was well above the required temperature rise (13 °C) and should be sufficient to induce apoptosis of the cancer cells in living mice.16

In vitro cell experiments were carried out with CCK8 cell viability assay to explore the cytotoxicity and in vitro PTT performance of the Ni9S8 NPs. The fluorescence images of HeLa cells were used to confirm effectively photothermal HeLa cell death in the presence of the Ni9S8 NPs. The live and dead cells were distinguished using calcein-AM and PI co-staining, respectively. After 808 nm, 915 nm, 976 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation (under the MPE of 808, 915, 976 and 1064 nm lasers), it was clearly observed that a large amount of cells, after incubation with the Ni9S8 NPs, were killed under 808 nm, 915 nm, 976 nm and 1064 nm laser irradiation (Fig. S10†). In contrast, the viability of the cells from the other groups displayed no obvious changes. As shown in Fig. 6a, HeLa cells incubated with different concentrations of the Ni9S8 NPs (0–150 ppm) for 24 h showed no significant cytotoxicity, which indicates that the NPs are biocompatible. Additionally, PBS and PBS irradiated with the 1064 nm laser also exert negligible influence on cell viability, whereas cells treated with the Ni9S8 NPs upon 1064 nm irradiation display evident cell death (Fig. 6b). As shown in Fig. 6c, such fluorescence images are well consistent with CCK8 assay results. These results in total imply that the Ni9S8 NPs are a potentially efficient photothermal agent in promoting cancer cell ablation.

(b) Cell viability of HeLa cells of PBS, PBS + NIR, Ni9S8 and Ni9S8 + NIR groups driven by the NIR laser (1064 nm, 0.7 W cm−2) for 10 min. (c) Fluorescence images of HeLa cells after various treatments, as labelled. The cells were co-stained with calcein AM (green, living cells) and propidium iodide (red, dead cells). The scale bar is 100 μm. 
As HeLa cells in the presence of the Ni9S8 NPs could be efficiently killed under 1064 nm laser irradiation in vitro, subsequently, the PTT efficacy in vivo was evaluated through intratumoral injection of Ni9S8 NP dispersions. When the tumor volumes reached ∼100 mm3, tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into four groups (five mice each): (a) PBS injection only (100 μL), (b) PBS injection and 1064 nm laser irradiation (1 W cm−2, 10 min), (c) Ni9S8 NP injection only (100 μL, 200 ppm) and (d) Ni9S8 NP injection and 1064 nm laser irradiation. During laser irradiation, IR thermal imaging was continuously acquired with the thermal camera to monitor temperature changes at the tumor site (Fig. 7a), which demonstrates that these NPs could be used as a good infrared photothermal imaging contrast agent to achieve real-time monitoring of thermodynamic changes in the PTT process. As indicated in Fig. 7b, tumors in mice treated with PBS and 1064 nm laser irradiation display a slight temperature increase of ∼4 °C, while in the Ni9S8 + NIR group, the temperature rapidly increases to 58–59 °C upon identical irradiation. The tumor volumes and body weights of each group were measured for 20 days. Apparently, the tumors treated with the Ni9S8 NPs and 1064 nm laser irradiation were greatly repressed, leaving a scar at the initial tumor sites; the tumors in the other three control groups of the mice grew quickly (Fig. 8a and c). Note that the body weights of the mice for all four groups did not have notable changes or differences during the therapy course (Fig. 8b). The histological assessment evidenced that there was no damage or inflammatory lesion in the major organs (including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) from the HeLa tumor-bearing mice 20 days after the PTT with the Ni9S8 NPs (Fig. S11†). The seemingly abnormal H&E staining images of these major organs from Ni9S8 + NIR treatment groups is most likely to be attributed to the uneven staining. To investigate the biodistribution of the Ni9S8 NPs, the mice after intravenous (i.v.) injection of samples were euthanized at 4, 9, and 30 days. Their main organs including the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were analyzed for Ni distribution using ICP-AES. The results, shown in Fig. S12,† indicate that the Ni9S8 NPs were largely retained in the liver and spleen basically because of the reticuloendothelial system absorption. The Ni concentrations progressively decreased with time, thus relieving their potential long-time toxicity. From the histological examination, no obvious lesions were observed for the hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys of mice at different time points (Fig. 9b). The parameters related to the blood panel test (Fig. 9a1–a3) had no meaningful changes. These preliminary results evidenced that the Ni9S8 NPs were not noticeably toxic in vivo at our tested dose. Considering all the above, it may be reasonable to predict that the Ni9S8 NPs would not display long-term toxicity and be a safe agent to mice at this dose. As evidenced by the desirable in vivo bio-safety results, these Ni9S8 NPs could be used as an effective and safe photothermal agent in the NIR-II bio-window.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the hydrophilic Ni9S8 NPs smaller than 100 nm with a full-spectrum absorption ranging from 400 to 1100 nm have been successively synthesized, for the first time, as an efficient 1064 nm (NIR-II) laser excited photothermal agent. The photothermal conversion efficiency of the Ni9S8 NPs at 1064 nm can be as high as 46.0%, which is sufficiently high for the destruction of cancer cells and ablation of solid tumors. Based on the full-spectrum absorption of the NPs, the importance of shifting the laser light from the NIR-I to NIR-II window for highly efficient and deep-tissue PTT was revealed by well-designed comparison experiments. Therefore, our study not only promises the great potential of the Ni9S8 NPs as a novel PTA for cancer therapy but also leads to exploration of more NIR-II window light activated photothermal agents for biomedical applications.
