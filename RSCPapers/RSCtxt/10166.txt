    , Accepted 8th June 2022First published on 22nd June 2022AbstractIn this study, we proposed Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites as novel inorganic additives in locust bean gum (LBG) gel electrolytes for application in an aqueous dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The morphology of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites was characterized by XRD; UV-vis, FTIR, EDX, and XPS spectroscopies; SEM; and TEM. The as-synthesized metal oxide nanocomposites additives are incorporated with iodine/triiodide and an LBG biopolymer gel matrix to construct new aqueous gel electrolyte materials LGE2 (Mn3O4), LGE3 (Mn3O4·CuS) and LGE1 (without additive). Interestingly, an enhanced photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.47% under a 100 mW cm−2 light condition was observed for LGE3 compared to electrolytes (LGE1 and LGE2) due to an effective role of the Mn3O4·CuS additive with TiO2 and the I3− ion of the electrolyte which reduces the recombination reaction. This PCE result was sustained with some criteria of high conductivity, lower charge transfer resistance, high chemical capacitance, and longer electron lifetime. This novel electrolyte material consists of an inorganic additive (Mn3O4·CuS) and aqueous bio gel polymer (LBG) and opens a way for the replacement of costly additive and organic solvents in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
At present, based on energy claims and subsequent environmental concerns worldwide, renewable energies are considered as clean energy sources. Solar energy in particular is one of the most important renewable energies to address many environmental safeties challenging issues. In 1991, O’ Regan and Grätzel introduced a third generation photovoltaic device called a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) to convert solar energy to electricity. The ease of fabrication, light weight, transparency, low production cost, flexibility, colour tunability, and high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) under different light conditions have led to the continuous interest in DSSCs.1–4 The photovoltaic (PV) efficiency of DSSC has so far been obtained with ruthenium complexes, porphyrin and organic dyes with a high PCE of 12.4–14.7% respectively.5–7 The PCE of DSSCs mainly depend on each of its components, such as the photoanode, counter electrode and electrolyte.8,9 The electrolyte acts as the most important component for the regeneration of dye molecules and electron transfer between two electrodes during DSSC performance.10 Traditionally, a liquid electrolyte is used for DSSCs which results in the best PCE even though it has some limitations like leakage and evaporation of organic solvents, and ineffective sealing reduces long-term stability and large-scale production. To solve these problems, various electrolytes were introduced, such as ionic liquid, solid-state, polymer gel electrolytes, organic and inorganic hole conductors.11–13 Polymer gel electrolytes are considered to be the most prospective alternative for liquid electrolytes. Moreover, polymer gel electrolytes have some superior properties, including thermal stability, ease of fabrication, better ionic conductivity, long term stability, good interfacial filling properties, and they reduce leakage complications.14–17 Various kinds of synthetic polymers, such as PMMA, PEO, PAN, PVdF-HEP, PVA and PVP, have been used as a gel electrolyte medium for DSSC.18–23 Furthermore, these synthetic polymer electrolytes show satisfactory performances, and some concerns are high cost and non-biodegradability, so that forces researchers to draw their attention to biodegradable polymers. Up to the present, several types of biopolymers, such as cellulose, starch, agarose, carrageenan, gelatin, Xanthan gum, guar-gum, etc., have been reported in DSSC. These have advantages such as a low cost, eco-friendliness, good mechanical and physical properties, non-toxicity and abundant availability in nature.24–33 Recently, aqueous-based electrolytes have drawn attention due to their environmental safety, low cost and eco-friendliness, which replaces the toxic and explosive types of organic solvents in DSSCs. Until now, DSSC based on aqueous-based electrolytes achieve a PCE of 5.97% to 7%.34–38 The addition of water to an organic electrolyte causes the conduction band of TiO2 to shift to a higher energy level, thereby increasing the energy band gap. Additionally, the strong adsorption of water molecules on the TiO2 surface prevents the electron recombination in the conduction band of TiO2 with I3−, thereby increasing the open-circuit voltage.37 Only few reports have offered an investigation of aqueous-based electrolytes for DSSC applications. In addition, the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles as additives can convert the liquid electrolyte to a quasi-solid-state electrolyte and thus boost the long-term stability, improve ionic conductivity and reduce the charge recombination process at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. So far, inorganic nanoparticles, such as TiO2, ZnO, SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, NiO, Co3O4, metal–organic materials and carbon etc., have been successfully employed in an electrolyte to enhance the PCE of DSSC.39–44
In this paper, we have added Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in the aqueous gel electrolyte for DSSCs. Mn3O4 (Hausmannite) is one of the most significant transition metal oxides because of its unique structure and physicochemical properties and this was highly used for energy conversion, catalysis and magnetic applications, etc. Herein, the water molecules are easily adsorbed at the surface of 001 (Mn3O4), and were attached to Mn3+ and Mn2+ and have the most stable structure during water adsorption on the Mn3O4 surface.45–47 However, aggregation of Mn3O4 nanoparticles has led to low chemical and thermal stabilities and a reduction of catalytic efficiency.45 To tackle with these issues, the addition of CuS readily improves the conductivity and stability of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles. This water adsorption properties of the Mn3O4 nanoparticles help to prevent dye degradation in aqueous-DSSCs.
In this work, a first time investigation of a novel locust bean gum (LBG) biopolymer combined with Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS additives to prepare aqueous-based gel electrolytes is conduced. LBG is a popular natural polymer, which is derived from the seeds of leguminous plant C. siliqua Linn. These are widely used in the food industry, pharmaceutical industry and it has thickening and gelling properties.48 The addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites affects the water molecules in the gel electrolyte response, leads to a good electron transport, reduces charge recombination, improves ionic conductivity and shifts the conduction band in TiO2 surface of DSSC. Notably, the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites as a new inorganic additive to the LBG aqueous gel electrolyte was found to increase the PCE of DSSCs. This was sustained by the prevention the dye desorption, a reduction in charge recombination, a longer electron lifetime, and a high chemical capacitance and conductivity.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Mn3O4
In a typical experiment, 0.5 g of MnSO4·H2O was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 8–9 by the addition of aq. ammonia solution. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was transferred to an autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 12 h. Finally, after cooling down to room temperature, the colloidal mixture was centrifuged and washed by deionized water and ethanol several times and dried in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h.
2.2 Preparation of Mn3O4·CuS
The Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites were prepared by a hydrothermal method. Typically, 0.5 g MnSO4·H2O, CuSO4 (0.2 g) and 0.06 g ethyl cellulose was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water, which was then magnetically stirred for 3 h. The stirred mixture solution was transferred into an autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. After the reaction was allowed to cooling down to room temperature, the black colour precipitate was filtered by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. Finally, the product was completely dried in an oven at 120 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Preparation of LBG gel electrolytes with additives
The aqueous based LBG gel electrolyte was prepared through gelatinizing LBG with a Mn3O4 nanocomposite gel electrolyte. First, the liquid electrolyte containing LiI (0.70 g) and iodine (0.1 g) was dissolved in EC:PC (3:3 ml) solvent under constant stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. Then, 0.075 g of LBG was dissolved in 2.5 ml of deionized water and added to the liquid electrolyte (2.5 ml). Additionally, 0.1 g of either Mn3O4 or Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites was added to the above mixture and stirred at room temperature for 4 h, until a homogenous gel was obtained. The prepared gel electrolytes were denoted as Mn3O4 nanoparticles LGE2 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites LGE3. For comparison, a sample without additives also was prepared, denoted as LGE1.
2.4 DSSC fabrication
The FTO conductive glass was cleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. A TiO2 paste was coated on FTO glass using the doctor blade technique and dried at 120 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the TiO2 coated glass was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and then the TiO2 electrode was immersed into 0.5 mM N719 dye in ethanol for 24 h under dark conditions, and rinsed with ethanol and water to remove the unabsorbed dye. The active area of the photoelectrode was fixed to 0.25 cm2. Finally, the prepared LBG gel electrolyte was casted on the photoanode and then a platinum electrode was gently pressed on top of the photoanode. Lastly, the final two electrodes were clipped together and a sandwich cell was pressed with two binder clips.
2.5 Characterization
The phase and crystalline structures were investigated by XRD (X-ray diffraction) using BRUKER USA D8 advance. The surface morphology and element composition were analysed using FESEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy) with Thermoscientific Apero S and TEM (transmission electron microscopy) using JEOL Japan, JEM-2100 plus. The electronic structure of all nanoparticles was determined by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis using physical electronics. The absorption band was carried by UV-visible spectroscopy (SHIMADZU, UV 3600 PLUS). Analysis of functional groups was obtained by FTIR spectroscopy using SHIMADZU, IRTRACER 100. DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) studies were recorded by NETZSCH DSC 204 F1 Phoenix. Cyclic voltammetry was measured by BIOLOGIC-SP300. Electrochemistry studies and I–V curves were measured under standard light intensity AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) using an AUTOLAB12/FRA2 electrochemical analyzer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure analysis of metal oxide nanocomposites
XRD patterns is a useful tool to determine the phase and crystalline nature of any inorganic material. Fig. 1(a) shows a comparison of the XRD analysis of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS. From Fig. 1(a), pure Mn3O4 exhibits obvious diffraction peaks located at 18.02°, 28.90°, 32.33°, 36.07°, 44.43°, 50.76°, 58.51°, 59.88°, 64.61°, 67.85°, which correspond to the (101), (112), (103), (211), (220), (105), (321), (224), (400) and (411) planes, respectively. Mn3O4 can be assigned to the Tetragonal Hausmannite crystal structure, which matches well with the JCPDS card no. 24-0734.49 For Mn3O4·CuS, the addition of CuS peaks observed at 27.96°, 29.59°, 33.42°, 38.88°, 48.50°, 43.51°, 44.85°, 52.07°, 58.97° correspond to the (101), (102), (006), (105), (110), (106), (008), (108), (203) planes, respectively. These peaks are in good agreement with the JCPDS card no. 06-0464 and confirm the covellite hexagonal structure.50 These XRD results clearly revealed that CuS strongly coordinates with Mn3O4 nanocomposites. Fig. 1(b) displays the UV-visible spectra of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. The Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites show a broad absorption band around 334–421nm and 348–510 nm. The increasing behaviour of the absorption band of Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites confirms the formation of nanocomposites.

The thermal stability of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites was studied by TGA and DSC, as shown Fig. 1(c) and (d). An initial weight loss slope observed at 120 °C could be attributed to the removal of the water molecules in Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. In the temperature range of 120–278 °C, the weight loss slowly decreases for Mn3O4 nanocomposites. At the same time, a weight loss observed at temperature range of 120–296 °C is seen in the Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. However, for Mn3O4·CuS, the weight loss changes to a higher value (296 °C), due to the addition of CuS to improve the thermal stability of Mn3O4. From the DSC measurements shown in Fig. 1(d), an endothermic peak was observed at 513 °C and 527 °C, due to the melting point of Mn3O4 and Mn2O3 in the materials. These thermal studies suggest that the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites improves the gel electrolyte stability for outdoor DSSC applications. In the FTIR spectrum, a strong stretching vibration mode of Mn–O49,51 is assigned at 608 and 483 cm−1, which is associated with the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Furthermore, the absorption band at 630 cm−1 belongs to the stretching vibration of Cu–S,52 indicating the CuS octahedral formation on the Mn3O4 surface in the Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites.
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy is a useful study for surface analysing the chemical state and binding energy of the elements present in Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. The survey spectra of the Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS samples are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). In the survey region 1000–0 eV, the presence of manganese, oxygen, copper and sulphur elements is confirmed in the composite. From the XPS spectrum of Mn 2p (Fig. 2(c)), binding energy peaks located at 642.08 and 653.76 eV belong to the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 in the Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. In the Mn 2p region, the energy splitting of 11.68 eV between the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 indicate the presence of Mn3O4.53,54 The O 1s orbital peak exhibited at 530.15 and 531.64 eV corresponds to the Mn–O–Mn bond interaction, shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†).45 The Cu 2p spectrum of Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites (Fig. 2(d)) displays two sharp peaks at 933.2 and 953.5 eV, which can be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively, and the binding energy of 20.3 eV to Cu 2p in accord with Cu2+. The S 2p peaks detected at 168.7 eV and 169.1 eV are attributed to the polysulfide formation in Cu and Fig. S2(b) is given in the ESI†. It confirmed that CuS strongly coordinates with the surface on the Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites.55,56

The morphology and size of the as prepared Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites were estimated by SEM and TEM analysis. Fig. 3(a) and (b) is the low magnification of SEM and Fig. 4(a) and (b) is the high magnification of TEM images of Mn3O4, which shows that Mn3O4 has an uneven spherical shape and a particle size of 10–15 nm. Fig. 3(c) and (d) (SEM) and Fig. 4(c) and (d) (TEM) show the nanocube structure of Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. The average size of the nanocubes is about 550–700 nm. The lattice fringes and SAED pattern of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites are displayed in Fig. 3(c) and (f), which correspond to the plane value that match with the XRD results. These results indicate that CuS was uniformly coordinated with the Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. EDS investigates the elemental composition in the Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites. As seen in Fig. 3(e) and (f), no other peaks were detected in the EDX spectrum, hence, the sample is successfully prepared in high purity nanocomposites.

3.2 Characterization of the LBG gel electrolytes
XRD analysis (Fig. 5(a)) of the gel electrolyte more clearly reveals the impact of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites on the polymer chain interaction in the gel electrolyte. The broad peak appeared at a 2θ of 24.9°, 25.5° and 26.7° for LGE1, LGE2 and LGE3, respectively. The shifting intensity may be due to the incorporation of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites on the polymer matrix in LGE2 and LGE3. The highly amorphous nature of the gel electrolytes was clearly confirmed from the XRD results. This amorphous nature improves the ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes.
 Fig. 5  Characteristics of gel electrolytes: (a) XRD patterns, (b) UV-visible spectra, (c) TGA curves and (d) DSC curves. 
FTIR was examined to detect vibrational variation before and after adding additives to the LBG gel electrolyte, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 5(b). According to the reported literature, the LBG polymer shows strong broad absorptions at 3400–3200 cm−1 owing to the O–H stretching vibration. The band at 1397 cm−1 corresponds to the bending vibration of C–H, 1188 cm−1 to the stretch of C–O–C and 1082 cm−1 is assigned to the C–O–H stretching/bending, respectively.57,58 These results indicate that Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites do not affect the LBG polymer chain and they help in the I3− mobility in DSSC performance.
Thermogravimetric analysis of all the gel electrolytes (Fig. 5(c)) first showed a weight loss in the range below 100 °C due to the removal of absorbed water. The thermal profile of LGE1, LGE2 and LGE3 showed weight loss in the range 110–160 °C, 125–180 °C and 130–185 °C, owing to the complete removal of the organic molecule surface on the gel electrolyte. DSC results for the all the gel electrolyte samples are given in Fig. 5(d). The decomposition temperature of the LGE peak is observed at 120 °C, which increased to 132 °C when LGE2 and LGE3 were introduced into the gel electrolytes. Additionally, the peaks at 175 °C and 182 °C in LGE2 and LGE3 clearly indicate the interaction of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites with the LBG polymer. Therefore, the decomposition temperature of LGE is lower than that of LGE2 and LGE3. This high decomposition action makes it clear that the gel electrolyte does not degrade in external DSSC applications. Fig. 6 shows the UV-visible spectra of LBG gel electrolytes. All gel electrolyte absorption bands appeared at 225 nm, indicating I3− ion interaction with the LBG polymer chain. Moreover, the broad absorption band at 300–350 nm in LGE2 and LGE3 is attributed to the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites highly incorporated on the LBG polymer chain. This interaction is helpful for the improvement of I3− ion mobility and fast charge separation in the electrolyte/TiO2 interfaces, and thus reduces the charge recombination process during DSSC operation.
 Fig. 6  UV-visible spectra of gel electrolytes. 
The surface morphology of the prepared LBG gel electrolytes was observed by FESEM, as given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) shows the highly porous nature and smooth surface of LGE1. Fig. S3(b) and (c) (ESI†) show the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in LGE2 and LGE3, which clearly reveal that nanoparticles are deposited on the LBG gel electrolyte. The interaction between the Mn3O4 or Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites and the LBG polymer matrix is believed to encourage the ion complexation in the polymer to achieve highly efficient charge transport in the gel electrolyte. To investigate the presence of elements of the nanocomposites in the gel electrolytes, EDX analysis was performed and the data are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in LGE2 and LGE3 was confirmed by the presence of respective elements in the gel polymer matrix. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out to evaluate the effect of the addition of nanocomposite additives in LGE2, LGE3 and LGE1 (without the addition of an additive). As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), it can be clearly seen that after the addition of the additive in LGE2 and LGE3, the redox properties improved. Comparing three LBG gel electrolytes, the redox properties highly increased after the addition of the nanocomposite additives. So, these improved redox properties prove that Mn2+ and Mn3+ metal ions of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites interact very well in the LBG polymer matrix and improve the conductivity of the gel electrolyte.
3.3 Electrochemical studies
Electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements were performed to determine the charge transport between the electrode/electrolyte interfaces of the DSSC device. EIS was measured in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz under dark conditions. The Nyquist plots of DSSC fabricated with LGE1, LGE2 and LGE3 are shown in Fig. 7(a). At the first semicircle in the EIS (Fig. 7a) is the obtained charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the Pt electrode/gel electrolyte interface. Generally, the high Rct hampers the charge transfer from the counter electrode to the electrolyte, subsequently reducing the FF of DSSC. EIS analysis related values can be also found in Table 1. Table 1 indicates the increase of Rct with the addition of Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in LGE3, which is attributed to the increase in ion concentration at surface of the Pt electrode and the faster ion transport in the gel electrolyte. The observation of chemical capacitance (Cμ) for LGE1, LGE2 and LGE3 showed values of 1.07 × 10−6 F 1.45 × 10−6 F and 2.85 × 10−6 F, respectively. As seen in the comparison chart of chemical capacitance (Fig. 7(b)), the capacitance highly increased after the addition of Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in LGE 3. Therefore, from the impedance analysis, we believed that the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites into LGE2 and LGE3 highly improved the ion charge transfer between the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. This good charge transfer process of LGE2 and LGE3 electrolytes increases the short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit (Voc) and improves the PCE.

The diffusion coefficient (D) was examined by CV studies with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The diffusion coefficient for LGE1, LGE2 and LGE3 was determined to be 1.68 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, 2.44 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 and 4.24 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, respectively. The higher diffusion value of LGE3 is owing to the higher quantity of free ions traveling in the direction of the electric field. This reveals that the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in LGE2 and LGE3 improves the ease of movement of free ions in the polymer matrix.
The electron lifetime (τn) was derived from the bode phase plot (Fig. 7(c)) for all gel electrolytes and is shown in Fig. 7(d). The electron lifetime findings were used to easily understand the charge recombination and electron transport dynamics of the DSSC device. The electron lifetime values are given in Table 1 and are calculated by the following equation,  where fmax is the maximum frequency range.59–61 LGE1 and LGE2 showed a shorter electron lifetime. After the addition of nanocomposites into LGE3, it showed a longer electron lifetime (101.10 ms). The longer electron lifetime of LGE3 reduces the electron recombination at the TiO2 and gel electrolyte interfaces and results in a higher PCE. From these results, a higher capacitance and electron lifetime can be clearly attributed to the capability of Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites to significantly intermediate the charge transfer kinetics of redox couples in the LBG gel electrolyte. Therefore, Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposite-based gel electrolytes could be a better choice to provide highly efficient electrolytes for DSSC compared to the bare LGE1. The electrochemistry results indicate that the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites into gel electrolytes obviously improves the recombination reactions. Mechanistically, Mn2+ and Mn3+ of composites were more effective and showed a cationic effect towards the TiO2 surface, and thus improved the I3− ion mobility in the gel electrolytes compared to the bare gel electrolyte. It is assumed that Mn2+ and Mn3+ metal on the LBG gel electrolytes also contributed to activating the LBG ion conductivity.
3.4 Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic response of the DSSC device based on LGE1, LGE2 and LGE3 gel electrolytes is shown in Fig. 8(a). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The DSSC device with LGE3 attained a superior PCE of 3.47% when compared to devices with LGE1 and LGE2 electrolytes which showed PCEs of 1.32% and 2.14% respectively. Generally, an increment of Voc can be possible by two different mechanisms: (i) regression of recombination, and (ii) the Fermi level increase of the TiO2 semiconductor, or a combination of both.62 LGE2 and LGE3 showed a higher Voc which was attributed to a shift on the TiO2 conduction band edges, and reduced the recombination between the electrode/gel electrolyte interfaces. Further, the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites into LGE2 and LGE3 can promote the I3− ion concentration in the polymer matrix and increase the charge transfer in the TiO2 conduction band. Mainly, the Mn2+ and Mn3+ metal ions in the nanocomposite additives played a major role in LBG gel electrolytes for a Fermi-level shift of TiO2via a cationic effect, which readily improves the I3− ion transport, more efficiently regenerates the dye molecules and reduces the recombination losses. The comparative performance of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposite additive-based gel electrolytes showed that the Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposite-based LGE3 was much higher than that of the Mn3O4 based LGE2. Therefore, from the I–V results, the addition of the Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposite additive in the gel electrolyte as a charge carrier between the electrode and electrolyte interfaces exhibit an improvement of DSSC performances. Various metal oxides with bio polymer-based gel electrolytes and DSSC performances are given in Table 3. The stability graph of the gel electrolytes with Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites are displayed in Fig. 8(b). The stability graph showed that Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites have a better stability which stands for 5 days under light conditions.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a novel addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites in LBG gel electrolytes was proposed for the new development of aqueous-biopolymer based DSSC. The addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposites strongly absorbed on the surface of TiO2, which prevents the direct interaction between the I3− ion and TiO2 (photoanode) and reduces the recombination reaction. The improved performance resulting from the addition of nanocomposite additives in LGE2 and LGE3 increases the Voc and thus upshifts the Fermi level in the TiO2 conduction band. The higher electron diffusion coefficient increases in the LGE3 gel electrolyte resulting in an enhanced charge transfer compared to that of the LGE1 and LGE2 gel electrolytes. When, compared to the LBG gel electrolyte, the LGE2 and LGE3 gel electrolytes exhibited a higher Voc and Jsc, and reached a higher PCE due to the role of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS additives towards TiO2 to reduce recombination. The LGE1 without additive based DSSC showed 1.32% efficiency, and, at the same time, LGE2 and LGE3 exhibited 2.14% and 3.47% efficiency under 1 sun condition, mainly because of the cationic effect of the metal nanocomposite additive on the photo-anode. From this work, the aqueous soluble biopolymer with the addition of Mn3O4 and Mn3O4·CuS nanocomposite based gel electrolytes in DSSC was found to have a substantial effect on electron transport, reduce charge recombination, and have a low-cost, easily fabricated and eco-friendly production.
