    , Accepted 31st October 2017First published on 1st November 2017AbstractLanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have shown potential applications in diverse fields. However, their upconversion luminescence (UCL) intensity and excitation wavelength range are limited by the weak and narrowband absorption of lanthanide ions. Herein, we introduce and validate a strategy to largely increase the absorptivity and upconversion luminescence intensity under 808 nm excitation by broadband dye-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich structured upconversion nanocrystals NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb. The dye molecules anchored on the surface of the UCNPs serve as an antenna which can broadly and strongly harvest NIR light. The Nd3+ facilitates the energy transfer and photon upconversion of the lanthanide activator at a biocompatible excitation wavelength (around 800 nm) with a significant increase in penetration ability and minimizes the overheating problem associated with conventional 980 nm excitation. The quenching-shield sandwich structure can greatly eliminate the deleterious cross-relaxation pathway between the activator and sensitizer. This approach combines the merits of the use of Nd3+ as a sensitizer, a quenching-shield sandwich structure and the “antenna” effect, leading to a tremendous enhancement of UCL under excitation at 808 nm. These well-designed UCNPs excited at 808 nm with improved optical performances will outperform conventional UCNPs excited at 980 nm and play an important role in the development of luminescent probes for future biological and medical applications.
1. Introduction
Recently, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have attracted much attention. These UCNPs have shown potential applications in various fields,1–3 such as solar cells,4–6 cellular labeling,7 biological imaging,8–10 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors,11–13 and photodynamic therapy.14–16 All these applications benefit from the distinguished merits of UCNPs, including large anti-Stokes shifts, long lifetimes, narrow emission bandwidths, high photostability, and low toxicity.17–22 Despite these advantages, there exist a number of daunting challenges that may restrain the wide applications of the conventional UCNPs. One major limitation is their low conversion efficiency due to the extremely weak absorption and very narrow absorption spectral window of the sensitizer Yb3+ in the NIR region.23–26 Moreover, a 980 nm laser is the most commonly used NIR excitation source to generate UC emission, and water molecules that are dominant in biological samples have a high photon absorbance around 980 nm, which would lead to a limited penetration ability of the excitation laser for deep-tissue imaging. Furthermore, exposure of biological species under 980 nm continuous irradiation would cause overheating issues, resulting in cell and tissue damage.27 Therefore, to overcome these problems and make UCNPs more suitable for biological applications, it is necessary to enhance their absorption of NIR light and optimize the excitation light wavelength in an appropriate range by combining UCNPs with another component.
Compared with excitation at 980 nm, the excitation at about 800 nm leads all the biomolecules having a minimum absorbance.27–30 Thus the use of an about 800 nm NIR laser may both overcome the limited penetration ability and overheating issues. Recent studies revealed that photon upconversion under about 800 nm excitation could be achieved through the use of Nd3+ as a sensitizer, due to the intense absorption cross-section of Nd3+ (1.2 × 10−19 cm2 at 808 nm) compared to that of Yb3+ (1.2 × 10−20 cm2 at 980 nm)31 and the efficient Nd3+ → Yb3+ nonradiative resonant energy transfer.32,33 Nevertheless, the biggest challenge in utilizing Nd3+ as a sensitizer is the harsh quenching effect caused by efficient energy back-transfer from a typical lanthanide activator to Nd3+.34 Thus, the doping concentration of Nd3+ in UCNPs must be constrained to a very low level (less than 1%) to minimize quenching interactions, leading to a weak absorption in the NIR region and thus a weak upconversion emission.35 To address this concern, great progress has been achieved by a core–shell strategy involving the doping of Nd3+ at high concentration in the shell layer and the activator in the core.36–38 This strategy separates the activator and sensitizer, thus the energy back-transfer from the typical lanthanide activator to Nd3+ can be efficiently prevented and intense UCL can be obtained.
Alternatively, besides the use of Nd3+ as a sensitizer, the use of broadband organic dye-sensitized UCNPs is another promising way to enhance UCL under around 800 nm excitation.39–41 The broadband organic dye anchored on the surface of UCNPs functions as an antenna, which can broadly and strongly harvest NIR light, and subsequently initialize multistep directional nonradiative energy transfer to excite lanthanide ions positioned within the inorganic core to entail an upconversion process. Hummelen's group39 reported that an obvious enhancement of UCL was obtained when they used IR-806 dye to sensitize the UCL of NaYF4:Yb,Er. However, because the emission spectrum of IR-806 didn't overlap well with the absorption spectrum of NaYF4:Yb,Er, a large energy mismatch between the donating energy level of the dye and the accepting energy level of Yb3+ resulted in inefficient energy transfer between them.
Herein, we report a hybrid inorganic–organic system consisting of Nd3+-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs and NIR dye anchored on the UCNP surface (Fig. 1). We first designed a type of quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNP of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb. In this sandwich structure, Nd3+ was incorporated into the outermost shell and the activator Tm3+ was doped in the inner core. There exists an intermediate layer (NaLuF4:Gd,Yb) between the core and the outermost shell serving as a shield that spatially isolated the Nd3+ from the activator in the core, and consequently prevented the cross-relaxation-induced UC quenching effects between Nd3+ and Tm3+, while the efficient excitation energy transfer from Nd3+ to the activator could still be achieved through the Yb-mediated core–shell–shell interface. Thus, the unwanted quenching effects arising from Nd3+ could be avoided even with a pure NaNdF4 coating as the outermost layer, and the increased sensitizer (Nd3+) concentration could enlarge the absorption cross-section and consequently enhance the UCL. The high content of Nd3+ in the quenching-shield sandwich structured nanocrystals guaranteed a high extinction coefficient at around 800 nm that provided sufficient excitation energy to generate a high UCL. Based on the quenching-shield sandwich nanostructure, the enhanced performance of UCNPs under around 800 nm excitation could be realized. In this system, an NIR dye acted as an antenna which broadly and strongly harvested NIR light and then transferred its excitation energy to the Nd3+ ions which were incorporated into the outermost shell of the UCNPs, and subsequently initialized a multistep cascade energy transfer process to entail an intense upconversion emission. This multistep cascade energy transfer strategy, in which each step involved a small energy gap and provided a maximum overlap between the emission of an energy donor and the absorption of an energy acceptor, led to high efficiency for the transfer of harvested light energy all the way down to the upconverting lanthanide ions in the core. The dye-sensitized core–shell–shell UCNPs synergistically combined the merits of the use of Nd3+ as a sensitizer, a quenching-shield sandwich structure and the “antenna” effect from the dye that could produce ultrabright UCL under excitation at around 800 nm.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Characterization of the prepared UCNPs
To realize high efficiency multistep cascade energy transfer and high UCL in a dye-sensitized core–shell structure, we first designed quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb and optimized nonradiative energy transfer from Nd3+ in the shell to Tm3+ in the core. The UCNPs were synthesized using a thermal decomposition method.42 As Gd3+ could facilitate the formation of a hexagonal phase NaLuF4, Gd3+ was introduced into the UCNPs as the doping ion to increase the UCL.43–45 The TEM images of the prepared core, core–shell, core–shell–shell UCNPs are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. As shown in Fig. 2, both the core (NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm) and core–shell (NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb) UCNPs were all hexagonal phase crystals, with uniform morphologies and sizes. The average diameter of core nanocrystals was 20 nm, and the average diameters of core–shell nanocrystals were enlarged from 26 to 35 nm with an increase in shell thickness from 3 nm to 7.5 nm, respectively. After coating an outermost shell layer (NaNdF4:Yb), the sizes of the nanocrystals were further enlarged. The measured diameters of the core–shell–shell nanocrystals were 35, 40, 46, 50 and 54 nm, respectively. Fig. 3 shows that core–shell–shell nanocrystals NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb looked like an anisotropic structure. As the ionic radius of Nd3+ (1.249 Å) was much larger than Lu3+ (1.117 Å), the lattice of the outer shell was compressed during the core–shell epitaxial growth process, resulting in an anisotropic structure.46–48 The HRTEM images of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb (Fig. 3f) revealed the highly crystalline nature of the as-prepared nanocrystals. The determined values of interplanar distances between adjacent lattice fringes corresponded to the crystal planes of the nanocrystals.48,49 EDX spectroscopy was applied to confirm the chemical composition of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 4a, all of the elements including Na, Lu, F, Gd, Yb, Nd and Tm were detected in NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb, indicating that the exact ingredients were effectively built into the nanocrystals. The EDX line analysis (Fig. 4b) revealed the distribution of Nd3+ in the quenching-shield sandwich-structured nanoparticle, from which a Nd3+ shell could be distinguished, which further confirmed the Nd3+-coating quenching-shield sandwich nanostructure. The elemental analysis of EDX mapping was further employed to identify the internal structure of the nanocrystal NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb. It can be seen from Fig. 4c–i that elements Na, F, and Yb are distributed homogeneously in the sphere. The elements Lu and Gd are mainly distributed in the core/shell, Nd is mainly distributed in the outermost shell and Tm is mainly distributed in the core [d(Nd) > d(Lu, Gd) > d(Tm)]. These results confirm that a core/shell/shell sandwich structure is formed.

2.2. Upconversion luminescence performances of the prepared UCNPs
The upconversion luminescence spectra of the prepared nanocrystals are shown in Fig. 6 and 7. It could be seen that the core, core–shell and core–shell–shell nanocrystals had similar UCL spectra under irradiation at 980 or 808 nm. As the UCL spectra excited at 808 nm were similar to those excited at 980 nm, this demonstrated an efficient excitation energy transfer from Nd3+ to the activator through the Yb-mediated core–shell–shell interface. All of the nanocrystals showed the characteristic UCL spectra of Tm3+, which was attributed to the transitions of 1D2 → 3F4 (centered at 450 nm), 1G4 → 3H4 (centered at 476 nm) and 1G4 → 3F4 (centered at 645 nm), respectively.38,50

For the quenching-shield sandwich structured NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb, the thickness of the transition layer was a key factor in the efficacy of its shielding. By precisely modulating the thickness of the interlayer (d = 0, 3, 5, 6 and 7.5 nm), the UC emission of the UCNPs excited at 808 nm increased as the spacing between the sensitizer Nd3+ layer and activator layer expanded, which reached a maximum when the interlayer thickness reached at about 5 nm (Fig. 6). A further increase in the interlayer thickness caused a slight decrease of emission intensity since the broadening of the transition layer not only eliminated unwanted cross-relaxation pathways, but also affected the process of energy migration via Yb3+. The former could increase the UCL while the latter could decrease it.24
As shown in Fig. 7, when excited at 980 nm, the emission intensity of the Yb3+-sensitized core–shell UCNPs was found to be about 3 times higher than that of core UCNPs, and the core–shell–shell UCNPs were 2 times higher than that of the core–shell UCNPs, indicating successful suppression of surface-related quenching mechanisms and the importance of the active shell in achieving intense UCL. To test the photoluminescence performance of the 808 nm-excited Nd3+-sensitized UCNPs, we compared the Nd3+-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs with the conventional 980 nm-excited Yb3+-sensitized core–shell–shell UCNPs (NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb) (Fig. S1†). It was found that the emission intensity of the quenching-shield sandwich structured NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb with the optimized interlayer thickness upon 808 nm excitation was about 2 and 12 times higher than that of the conventional 980 nm-excited Yb3+-sensitized NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb and NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm using the same laser power, respectively (Fig. 7). But no detectable UCL was observed for the Yb3+-sensitized NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb excited at 808 nm using the same laser power. These 808 nm-excited quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs with improved optical performance will outperform conventional 980 nm-excited Yb3+-sensitized UCNPs as a result of the higher absorption cross-section of the sensitizer Nd3+ in NIR.
2.3. Preparation of broadband IR-820 dye and dye-sensitized UCNPs
Usually, NIR organic dyes have a wide absorption spectral window and a large NIR absorption cross-section.38 They could be utilized to harvest NIR in most degree to sensitize UCL of the UCNPs. In order to further enhance UCL of the fabricated NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb, we used a broadband NIR dye IR-820.
A commercial cyanine dye IR-806 was used as the starting material to synthesize a carboxylic acid-functionalized derivative, named IR-820 dye, through a nucleophilic substitution reaction (Scheme 1). The obtained IR-820 was verified by 1H NMR and MS. The results shown in Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI† confirmed that the desired product was successfully synthesized.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of IR-820 dye. 
The IR-820 dye exhibited a broad and strong absorption in NIR, and the main absorption band was between 670 and 870 nm, with a maximum at 820 nm in CHCl3 (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8, both IR-806 and IR-820 had broad and strong absorption in NIR, but at different maximum absorption wavelengths of 806 and 820 nm, respectively. The negligible absorption of IR-820 below 600 nm is essential for the experiment, as the antenna dye should be transparent to the upconverted photons emitted by the nanoparticles. The measured extinction coefficient of IR-820 at 820 nm was 1.56 × 104 times higher than that of UCNPs at 980 nm.
 Fig. 8  Absorption spectra of IR-820 (0.0025 mg mL−1), IR-820/UCNPs (0.0025/0.125 mg mL−1), IR-806 (0.0025 mg mL−1), and IR-806/UCNPs (0.0025/0.125 mg mL−1) in CHCl3. 
The attachment of IR-820 dye to the surface of the nanoparticles is a complex process, involving three possible mechanisms: chemical coordination interaction, physical adsorption, and electrostatic interaction. For the chemical coordination mechanism, both the carboxylic acid and the sulfate groups of IR-820 dye can contribute to its anchoring to the nanoparticle surface. The carboxylic acid-functionalized derivative IR-820 dye enables a close contact through chemical coordination between the dye and nanoparticles. The orientation of the dye molecules on the surface is difficult to ascertain but is supposed to be approximately parallel to the nanoparticle surface when chemical coordination plays the dominant role.38 The exchange reaction with oleic acid (OA) ligands and binding of IR-820 to the surface of the nanoparticles were confirmed by the measured absorption spectra of IR-820/UCNPs (Fig. 8) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. 9). As shown in Fig. 8, compared with IR-820, the absorption of IR-820/UCNPs at 820 nm decreased and the absorption maximum wavelength gradually blue shifted from 820 nm to 815 nm. In a blank experiment in which IR-820 was replaced by IR-806, it had no carboxyl to anchor onto the UCNPs, and no blue-shift was observed. As shown in Fig. 9, the FTIR spectrum of the IR-820 dye-coated UCNPs resembled a superposition of the two spectra of the IR-820 dye and the OA-coated UCNPs. The peaks at 2926 and 2852 cm−1 of the UCNPs were attributed to the resonance of the unsaturated OA ligand, while 1710 cm−1 was attributed to the resonance of the carboxyl groups. After a partial exchange with IR-820 dye, the unsaturated OA ligand peaks at 2926 and 2852 cm−1 remained but became weaker, and the peaks in the carbonyl region (1650–1750 cm−1) were changed, which could be taken as an indication of the bond formation between the IR-820 carboxylic acid group and the inorganic UCNPs.51 Photographic images of IR-820 dye, OA-coated nanoparticles and IR-820 functionalized nanoparticles are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The color change of the samples from colorless (middle image, nanoparticles only) to a deep color after coating of the nanoparticles with IR-820 (right image) further confirmed the binding of IR-820 dye and the nanoparticles.

2.4. UV-Vis-NIR spectral properties of the dye-sensitized UCNPs
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the synthesized UCNPs are shown in Fig. 10. The NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm and NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb UCNPs exhibited a characteristic absorption peak of Yb3+ at 980 nm corresponding to the 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transition of Yb3+. NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb UCNPs exhibited both characteristic absorption peaks of Yb3+ and Nd3+. The observed five peaks consistent with the electronic transitions of Nd3+, which were centered around 860, 800, 740, 580, and 520 nm, correspond to the transitions of 4I9/2 → 4F3/2, 4I9/2 → 2H9/2 + 4F5/2, 4I9/2 → 4S3/2 + 4F7/2, 4I9/2 → 2G5/2 + 2G7/2 and 4I9/2 → 4G7/2 + 2G9/2 of Nd3+, respectively.5 On comparing the absorption spectra of IR-820 (2.5 μg mL−1) with NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb (5 mg mL−1), it was obvious that IR-820 dye showed much higher absorption than that of the UCNPs at around 808 nm.38
 Fig. 10  Absorption spectra of IR-820 dye (2.5 μg mL−1), the upconversion nanoparticles (5 mg mL−1), and the emission spectrum of IR-820 dye (excitation at 750 nm, 2.5 μg mL−1). 
As shown in Fig. 10, the emission spectrum of IR-820 overlapped well with the absorption spectrum of the NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb at 800–1000 nm. This overlap allowed for efficient Förster-type energy transfer from excited IR-820 to the Nd3+ in the UCNPs.
2.5. UCL properties of the dye-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs
The proposed UC and energy-transfer mechanisms in the dye-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs upon 808 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 11. The broadband NIR dye anchored on the surface of the UCNPs broadly harvests NIR light, and then the Nd3+ confined in the outermost layer absorbs the excitation energy from the dyes through a Förster-type energy transfer process. This results in the population of the 4F5/2 state of Nd3+, followed by nonradiative relaxation to the 4F3/2 state, which then drops back to its ground state 4I9/2, along with transfer of its energy to a nearby Yb3+ to populate its 2F5/2 state. Then the absorbed energy by the Yb3+ in the outer layer is transferred to the adjacent Yb3+ in the intermediate layer and further transferred to the Yb3+ in the core crossing the intermediate layer to excite the Tm3+ in the core. The energy transfer pathways are depicted in Fig. 11, that is dye → Nd3+ (in the shell) → Yb3+ (in the shell) → Yb3+ (in the core) → Tm3+ (in the core). This multistep cascade energy transfer strategy, in which each step provides a good overlap between the emission of an energy donor and the absorption of an energy acceptor, leads to a high efficiency for the transfer of the harvested light energy. This designed system combining the merits of the use of Nd3+ as a sensitizer, quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs and the “antenna” effect from the dye can produce a tremendous enhancement of UCL under excitation in a broad NIR spectral range.
 Fig. 11  Schematic illustration of the proposed energy-transfer mechanism in the dye-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich-structured UCNPs. 
To confirm whether the energy transfer efficiency from the dye to Nd3+ is higher than to Yb3+, fluorescence decay dynamics were measured. As shown in Fig. S5,† the fluorescence lifetime of IR-820 dye shortened from 1.22 ns (pure IR-820 dye) to 0.93 ns for the IR-820 dye-sensitized NaYbF4 nanoparticles and to 0.75 ns for the IR-820 dye-sensitized NaNdF4 nanoparticles. This shortening of the fluorescence lifetime confirms a nonradiative type of energy transfer from IR-820 dye to Nd3+ or Yb3+. The fluorescence lifetime of IR-820 dye bound to the NaNdF4 nanoparticles was shorter than that bound to NaYbF4 nanoparticles, indicating more efficient energy transfer from IR-820 dye to Nd3+ than to Yb3+.
The emission spectrum of Nd3+ and the absorption spectrum of Yb3+ have limited spectral overlap due to the nature of non-resonant energy transfer, making the spectral overlap integral J rather small.52,53 However, an efficient energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+ usually occurs because of the significant involvement of multiple phonons from the host lattice to efficiently bridge the energy difference associated with the energy transfer.54 To confirm the energy transfer from Nd3+ to Yb3+, a comparison of downconversion luminescence (DCL) from NaNdF4, NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb and NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb nanoparticles (hexane dispersion, excited at 808 nm) was performed. As shown in Fig. S6,† luminescence peaks at 1056 and 1340 nm correspond to the transitions from the 4F3/2 state to the 4IJ (J = 11/2 and 13/2) state of Nd3+, respectively, while the luminescence peak at 980 nm corresponds to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+. In comparison with that of the NaNdF4 nanoparticles, a simultaneous decrease of luminescence (at 1056 and 1340 nm) from Nd3+ and the appearance of luminescence from Yb3+ (at 980 nm) were observed for the NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb nanoparticles. This simultaneous change verifies a direct energy transfer from the Nd3+ to the Yb3+ in the NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb nanostructure.
As shown in Fig. 12, it was found that the intensity of UCL from the IR-820 dye-sensitized NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb under excitation at 808 nm was much higher than those of other IR-820 dye-sensitized UCNPs (controls) such as NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm, NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb and NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb. These results demonstrated the efficient energy transfer between the dye and the Nd3+, and a good energy match between the donating energy level of the dye and the accepting energy level of Nd3+ in comparison with Yb3+. In the case of a mixture of non-functionalized IR-806 and NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb, the measured UCL was very low, indicating no energy transfer between the non-functionalized IR-806 dye and the Nd3+.

The UCL intensity of IR-820 dye-sensitized NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb UCNPs was shown to be about 6 times higher than that of the UCNPs without the dye when excited at 808 nm (Fig. 13). Moreover, the intensity of UCL from the IR-820 dye-sensitized UCNPs excited at 808 nm is about 10 times higher than that from the NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb excited at 980 nm using the same laser power. These enhancements verify the antenna effect provided by the IR-820 dye attached on the surface of the UCNPs.

All the above samples were dispersed in CHCl3 at the same concentration (2 mg mL−1). The power density of both lasers is 2 W cm−2. 
3. Conclusion
In summary, highly efficient UCL arising from excitation at 808 nm was achieved in the dye-sensitized quenching-shield sandwich structured UCNPs. The well-defined UCNPs are essential to eliminate the deleterious cross-relaxation pathway between the activator and sensitizer, while Nd3+ incorporated into the outermost shell of the UCNPs can efficiently sensitize the UCL of the UCNPs under around 800 nm excitation. The dye molecules anchored on the surface of the UCNPs serve as an antenna which can broadly and strongly harvest the NIR light and subsequently efficiently transfer excitation energy to the Nd3+. The results show that the UCL from our designed UCNPs excited at 808 nm is more intense than that from the conventional UCNPs excited at 980 nm at the same excitation power density. Furthermore, the use of an 808 nm laser source instead of a 980 nm laser can greatly increase the penetration depth into biological tissue and suppress unwanted overheating. At a broader level, the tunable absorption spectrum of the various NIR dyes coupled with versatile structural UCNPs can greatly expand the horizons of existing upconversion nanomaterials and facilitate their applications.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials
Rare-earth oxides Lu2O3 (99.999%), Gd2O3 (99.999%), Yb2O3 (99.999%), Nd2O3 (99.999%) and Tm2O3 (99.999%) were purchased from Shanghai Yuelong New Materials Co. Ltd. IR-806 (dye content 90%), oleic acid (OA; >90%) and 1-octadecene (ODE; >90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Trifluoroacetic acid (99.0%), ethanol, diethyl ether, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (90%), sodium carbonate, N,N-dimethylformamide, chloroform and cyclohexane were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai). Ln(CF3COO)3 (Ln: Lu, Gd, Yb, Nd and Tm) precursors were prepared by dissolving the corresponding metal oxides in trifluoroacetic acid at elevated temperature. Milli-Q water was used in the experiments. All other chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.
4.2. Synthesis of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm core nanocrystals
The NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm nanoparticles were prepared using a method similar to our previous report with slight modifications.55 Typically, 2 mmol CF3COONa, 0.555 mmol Lu(CF3COO)3, 0.24 mmol Gd(CF3COO)3, 0.2 mmol Yb(CF3COO)3 and 0.005 mmol Tm(CF3COO)3 were added to a mixture of OA (6 mL) and ODE (6 mL) in a three-necked flask at room temperature. The solution was pre-degassed for 30 min with vigorous magnetic stirring and then heated to 110 °C under vacuum for 30 min to remove water and oxygen. The resulting solution was heated to 325 °C at a rate of ∼15 °C min−1 and maintained for 1 h under argon protection. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, an excess amount of ethanol was added into the solution. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min, and washed with ethanol–cyclohexane (4:1, v/v) three times. The collected precipitate was dispersed in 5 mL cyclohexane.
4.3. Synthesis of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb (core–shell) nanocrystals with different shell thicknesses
For synthesizing core–shell structured NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb nanocrystals, definite amounts of CF3COONa, Ln(CF3COO)3 and the prepared NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm nanocrystals (0.5 mmol) were added to a mixture of OA (6 mL) and ODE (6 mL) in a three-necked flask. For synthesizing the nanocrystals with different shell thicknesses, the added amounts of CF3COONa were 0.2, 0.6, 1, and 2 mmol, respectively, and the added amounts of Ln(CF3COO)3 (Ln: 66% Lu, 24% Gd, 10% Yb) were 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 mmol, respectively. Then the solution was pre-degassed for 30 min with vigorous magnetic stirring and then heated to 110 °C under vacuum for 30 min to remove water and oxygen. The resulting solution was heated to 325 °C at a rate of ∼15 °C min−1 and maintained for 1 h under argon protection. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, an excess amount of ethanol was poured into the solution. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min, and washed with ethanol–cyclohexane (4:1, v/v) three times. The collected precipitate was dispersed in 5 mL cyclohexane.
4.4. Synthesis of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb (quenching-shield sandwich structure) nanocrystals and control of NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb
1 mmol CF3COONa, 0.45 mmol Nd(CF3COO)3, 0.05 mmol Yb(CF3COO)3 and the prepared NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb nanocrystals were added to a mixture of OA (6 mL) and ODE (6 mL) in a three-necked flask. The solution was pre-degassed for 30 min with vigorous magnetic stirring and then heated to 110 °C under vacuum for 30 min to remove water and oxygen. The resulting solution was heated to 325 °C at a rate of ∼15 °C min−1 and maintained for 1 h under argon protection. After naturally cooling down to room temperature, an excess amount of ethanol was poured into the solution. The resultant mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min, and washed with ethanol–cyclohexane (4:1, v/v) three times. The collected precipitate was dispersed in 5 mL cyclohexane.
The synthetic procedure of the NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaLuF4:Yb nanocrystals was similar to that used to synthesize NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb, except for using 0.45 mmol Lu(CF3COO)3 to replace 0.45 mmol Nd(CF3COO)3 to form the outermost shell of NaLuF4:Yb in place of NaNdF4:Yb.
4.5. Synthesis of IR-820 dye
The functionalization reaction was performed via a standard Schlenk-line technique in dry glassware and under a dry N2 atmosphere using an adapted procedure from a literature.41 A mixture of IR-806 (49 mg, 0.06 mmol) and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (20 mg, 0.12 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. Then, diethyl ether (50 mL) was added slowly to precipitate the product. After the solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum to afford IR-820. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, d6-DMSO): δ = 7.90 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 7.86 (d, J = 14.0 Hz, 2H), 7.52 (dd, J = 11.9, 7.9 Hz, 4H), 7.44 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 7.39 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), 7.22 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H), 6.23 (d, J = 14.0 Hz, 2H), 4.16 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 4H), 3.06 (s, 4H), 2.56–2.53 (m, 2H), 1.90–1.64 (m, 10H), 1.39 (s, 12H). MS: calculated for C44H49N2O8S3: 829.26; found: 829.31.
4.6. Synthesis of IR-820 dye-sensitized UCNPs (NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm@NaLuF4:Gd,Yb@NaNdF4:Yb/IR-820)
A mixture of oleic acid-coated upconversion nanoparticles (50 mg) and IR-820 (1 mg) in CHCl3 (1 mL) was stirred for 2 h at room temperature under N2, and then ethanol (20 mL) was added. The IR-820-functionalized upconversion nanoparticles were isolated by centrifugation. The as-precipitated nanoparticles were washed 3 times with ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C overnight.
4.7. Characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance (500 MHz) using d6-DMSO as a solvent at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2010F transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Rigaku D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The 2θ angle of the XRD spectra was recorded at a scanning rate of 6 deg min−1 and then was converted to Cu-Kα radiation values by Bragg's law. The upconversion photoluminescence emission spectrum was recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The samples were excited by either a 980 or 808 nm continuous wave laser under the power density of 2 W cm−2. UV-Vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Hitachi 3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).
