Through depth-dependent grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies, it is found that our best performing materials possess an active-layer morphology comprised of a vertically graded structure with different crystallite orientations. We further establish a correlation between a high solubility in the spin-coating deposition solution and the occurrence of this vertical distribution, whereas materials with lower solubility are found to possess a predominantly edge-on molecular orientation. These results further the understanding of this high-performing class of materials and suggest the importance of solubility considerations to OSC morphology.
Introduction
Small-molecular organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) are a photovoltaic technology that show great promise for renewable energy applications, and in the last half-decade have affirmed this promise by achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >10% for single junction devices and >13% for ternary blends approaching those required for mass-production and commercialization.1–4 SM-OSCs represent an alternative to polymer-based OSCs, and though they tend to lag behind in terms of their PCEs, they are more favored for industrial processing due to their advantages in synthetic and device reproducibility, high degree of structural elucidation and their ability to form films with the degree of crystallinity and order needed for efficient charge transport.5–8
The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) design dominates the OSC field and consists of an energy-harvesting active-layer comprised of an interpenetrating network of p-type and n-type semiconductors. An ideal BHJ morphology contains pure interpenetrating donor and acceptor domains, which are of sizes consistent with the exciton diffusion length. This morphology facilitates high rates of exciton splitting and minimizes recombination, while maintaining high charge mobility.9,10 As such, some of the most critical factors affecting OSC performance are the crystallinity, size and orientation of domains within the BHJ active layer.11–13
One of the foremost factors dictating the morphology of the active layer is the molecular structure of the active-layer materials.14,15 A vast number of organic semiconductors for OSC active-layer applications currently utilize donor–acceptor (D–A) architectures, which consist of covalently-bound electron-rich and electron-poor moieties.16–19 While altering the nature of these moieties can allow the facile tuning of molecular energy levels for optimized solar spectrum harvesting, it is equally important for efficient OSC performance to consider the impacts of these modifications on bulk properties – that is, active-layer nanostructure and film morphology.20,21 Optimal nanoscale-sized domains, generally predicted to be of 10–20 nm in size, are critically important for efficient OSC charge generation and transport. These p- and n-type domains are required to be small enough to allow charge separation within an excitonic lifetime, but large enough to minimize recombination between the separated charges.22,23 Another consideration involves the device architecture of OSCs – this is typically a layered structure, with a light-harvesting layer sandwiched by charge-collecting electrodes.24 As such, molecular orientation of the p-type semiconductor with respect to the device substrate can strongly influence photovoltaic performance. Although the optimal ratio of orientations is of some contention in the literature, it is generally accepted that a face-on orientation (Fig. 1), where the π-face of the molecular conjugated backbone is parallel to the plane of the substrate, is preferable to an edge-on orientation, where the π-face is perpendicular to the substrate. This is due to intermolecular charge delocalization occurring primarily through π–π interactions, and thus a face-on, vertically π-stacked active layer facilitates charge transport to the electrodes more so than an edge-on orientation.25–27 As such, factors affecting bulk morphology and molecular orientation must be understood and considered to maximize OSC performance.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of BTR analogues and schematic illustrations showing common thin-film molecular orientations (‘edge-on’ and ‘face-on’) relative to a substrate, as well as Miller indices corresponding to alkyl lamellar spacing (100), π-stacking (020) and backbone spacing (001) for these orientations. 
Here we examine a series of p-type organic semiconductors based on the electron-rich benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene (BDT) core unit flanked by alkyl-substituted terthiophene π-bridges and end-capped with an electron-poor rhodanine unit, shortened henceforth to ‘BTR’. First utilized in 2008 for OSC active layers, the BDT core unit has since become a structural motif in many high-performing p-type materials due to its nature as a highly planar, electron-dense conjugated unit, capable of relatively high hole transport, and synthetic versatility. Unsurprisingly, five of the six SM-OSCs currently reported with PCEs above 10% contain a benzodithiophene unit.28–31 We have recently published several reports on multiple molecular p-type materials utilizing the BTR architecture, some of which have produced outstanding PCEs close to 10% with increased thermal stability.32,33 We partly attribute these high PCEs to optimal morphologies attained by side-chain engineering which allows fast charge transport and a high fill factor (FF). Considering both the demonstrated photovoltaic performance of materials containing the BDT core and the potential for even higher power conversion efficiencies, it is vital to gain a thorough understanding of the structure–property relationship. Our previous studies have focused on altering sidechain length and orientation, as well as conjugation length along the thiophene backbone. We now turn our attention to a study on the impact of BDT core substituents with differing sidechains on active layer morphology, with a specific focus on intermolecular π–π stacking orientation.
To carry out this study we introduced several two-dimensional extensions – referred to from this point onwards as ‘headgroups’ – of the BDT core perpendicular to the conjugated backbone in order to investigate the impact of differing steric bulk and solubility properties. We carefully selected four headgroup moieties for their intrinsic structural properties, widespread use in the literature and synthetic versatility. We then appended them to the BTR molecular architecture (Fig. 2), resulting in four novel p-type molecular semiconductors termed BTR-TIPS (triisopropylsilylethynyl), BTR-TE (2-ethylhexylthio), BTR-H (2-hexylthienyl) and BTR-EH (2-(2-ethylhexyl)thienyl).7,29,34–37 We have also included a high-performing (>9% PCE) material, BTR from our previous research, in this study as an additional point of data.
 Fig. 2  Structures of the previously studied BTR and our four novel BTR-analogue p-type molecular semiconductors. 
To be able to elucidate the impact of these different headgroup substitutions on crystalline structure and orientation of BTR-analogue thin films, two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was utilized to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze these structures on a nanometer-sized scale. Semiconductor thin-films tend towards paracrystallinity rather than possessing good long-range order and as such GIWAXS measurements typically produce scattering reflections corresponding to d-spacings for specific molecular or intermolecular distances of the reflecting planes, as well as the orientations of these planes with respect to the film substrate.38 These d-spacings are usually given in terms of specific Miller indices (see Fig. 1) corresponding to different types of molecular packing, i.e. distances between alkyl lamella (100 spacings) or between molecules along the long axis of the conjugated backbone (001 spacings). This information can reveal the π–π stacking orientations vital to OSC performance. Furthermore, depth profiling may be performed simply by altering the angle of incidence of the incoming beam – at shallower incident angles, the depth of penetration of the beam is reduced and scattering is typically limited to the first 5 nm of the film surface.39–41 We utilize this capability to probe both the film surface as well as its internal structures to obtain a greater understanding of our molecules' orientations as a function of depth.
In this work, we synthesize four novel p-type semiconducting materials based on the high-performing BTR architecture. The solubilities of our materials in chloroform were measured and found to vary significantly as a function of their headgroups. By pairing them with the n-type semiconductor material PC71BM in OSC devices, we show that the BTR-TE compound displays outstanding performance as a p-type semiconductor material for OSC applications with a PCE of >9% after solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The morphology and crystallinity of the blends were studied through grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies, from which we observe several distinct pi-stacking orientations across our BTR analogues that we are able to correlate with their OPV performances. Using GIWAXS-enabled depth-profiling we also examine crystallite orientations throughout the vertical distribution of these thin films. When this is considered alongside the solubility of our materials, we hypothesize that the development of crystallite orientation in the films during the spin-coating deposition process could potentially be a result of the intrinsic solubilizing properties of the different headgroup substituents, which can then be further correlated to OSC performance. This then suggests that material solubility is a crucial element for the rational design of enhanced photovoltaic materials.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of our analogues follow a similar procedure to that established in our earlier works (Scheme 1, for full synthetic detail refer to the ESI†).33 We first assemble the benzodithiophene cores with our headgroup moieties, the syntheses of which have been reported in the literature. The BDT core was borylated utilizing our previously published direct iridium-catalyzed C–H activation, followed by a Suzuki coupling to add the alkylated terthiophene aldehyde. The final step is a Knoevenagel condensation between the aldehyde-functionalized BDT molecule and n-hexyl rhodanine to yield our target molecules. The synthesis of the terthiophene and rhodanine intermediates are covered in our previous work.33 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to establish the thermal stability of these compounds, all of which display excellent thermal stability with 5% weight loss observed at temperature ranges of 366–400 °C (Fig. S5.1†). Following this, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was utilized to probe major phase changes of the materials (Fig. S6.1†).
 Scheme 1  Generalized reaction pathway to the five BTR-analogues studied in this paper. This pathway begins from headgroup-functionalized BDT cores which are already reported in the literature, and shows the convergent points between the growing BDT core and other key reagents/intermediates utilized. 

BTR-H possesses the highest melting point (Tm) of 255 °C and followed by BTR-TIPS at 251 °C. As melting points are affected by the force of attraction between molecules, the low Tm of the 2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl) functionalized BTR-EH of 227 °C relative to the 2-hexylthienyl functionalized counterpart BTR-H is indicative of the strong disruptive influence of the branched alkyl chain. In this same vein it is clear that the thioester functionality also serves to significantly disrupt intermolecular packing contributing to the relatively low Tm of BTR-TE recorded at 216 °C. The melting point of BTR at 186 °C is consistent with that reported in our previous results. With the exception of BTR-TIPS, the solubility of our materials in chloroform – a solvent commonly used in solution-processing for OSC device- follow an inverse trend to that displayed by their melting points, with solubility increasing in the order of BTR-H (24 mg mL−1) < BTR-EH (33 mg mL−1) < BTR-TIPS (41 mg mL−1) < BTR-TE (56 mg mL−1) < BTR (211 mg mL−1). These solubilities are derived from concentration and absorption data (Fig. S7.1a–d†) with the exception of BTR, which is taken from the literature.32
UV-vis studies and electronic energy levels
UV-vis absorption spectra of our p-type materials were measured in dilute chloroform solution and as thin films cast from chloroform (Fig. 3) with the complete data presented in Table 1. No significant differences were observed between the absorption structure of the five compounds in solution, with a uniform broad absorption between 400–600 nm and peak maxima of 510–520 nm. The impact of the structural differences on absorbance between the molecules, however, were readily apparent upon calculation of their molecular absorption coefficients, ε. While the three analogues possessing a thienyl headgroup (BTR, BTR-H and BTR-EH) all possessed similar absorption coefficients of 8 to 9 × 104 M−1 cm−1, there is an approximately twofold decrease for BTR-TE, with an εmax of 4.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The higher absorption coefficient observed for the thienyl-containing analogues we attribute to the presence of extended 2-D conjugation of the structures. Reported single-crystal structures have revealed a ∼50° dihedral angle between the planes of the conjugated BDT backbone and the thienyl headgroup, the higher absorption coefficients clearly indicate there is still sufficient interaction to afford electron delocalization.35BTR-TIPS possesses a high εmax of 1.9 × 105 M−1 cm−1 that we attribute to the rigid nature and enhanced π-orbital overlap of its triisopropylsilyl headgroups. There is a noticeable change in absorbance upon shifting from solution to as-cast films, with all molecules manifesting redshifts of ∼70 nm along with distinct vibronic shoulders between 630–640 nm. We attribute this new absorption band to an enhanced electronic transition stemming from the increased π–π stacking in the thin-film. Not all our analogues experience these increased interactions to the same degree; BTR-TE in particular possesses a relatively diminished shoulder absorption peak, perhaps either due to the relative lack of two-dimensional conjugation, or that π–π stacking is no longer completely constrained to be along the molecular axis. A lower absorption onset of BTR-TIPS (670 nm against ∼700–710 nm) relative to the other analogues can be observed. We attribute this to the increased torsional angle between the BDT core and the oligothiophene π-bridges of BTR-TIPS of around 20° – as determined by its single-crystal structure (see below) – presumably from the greater steric bulk of the triisopropylsilyl headgroup, resulting in the disruption of conjugation along the backbone.

Steady-state photoluminescence spectra of both neat and SVA-treated blend films (with annealing conditions identical to those for our best-performing devices, see below) were obtained to observe the efficiency of fluorescence quenching with the introduction of the PC71BM n-type semiconductor (Fig. S8.1†). Relatively similar fluorescence quenching efficiencies are observed from films of all analogues of 83–90%, with these values consistent with the results from Schwarz et al. of a previous study on BTR.42 As concluded in that work, this suggests efficient exciton quenching at the interface between all our analogues and PC71BM, and may further indicate that a large portion of the domains in the thin-films possess diameters within the exciton diffusion lengths of the BTR analogues.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies (Fig. S7.1†) were also conducted to further establish the electronic properties of our BTR analogues. This data is summarized in Table 1. From the oxidation/reduction onset potentials (Eonsox and Eonsred) we can estimate highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) respectively. Here we reference the oxidation potentials of our compounds against ferrocene, which we determined to be 0.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl. These electrochemical studies show that our BTR-analogues all possess equivalent, deep HOMO levels of around −5.3 to −5.4 eV, which are beneficial for the high open-circuit voltages (VOC) needed for OSC devices. From this and the CV-derived LUMO levels we can calculate the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg) of our materials. These follow the same trends as established by the calculated optical energy gap from our UV-vis absorption studies. BTR-TIPS exhibits a large Eg of 2.29 eV, which is detrimental to efficient harvesting of the solar spectrum and is potentially one of the causes of its low photovoltaic efficiency (discussed further below). All other analogues possess an energy gap of around 2 eV.
Photovoltaic properties and performance
OSC devices utilizing our BTR-analogues were fabricated using a conventional device architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BTR-X:PC71BM-(1:1)/Ca/Al) to investigate their photovoltaic properties and efficiencies (Fig. 4). The average performances of 10 devices is summarized in Table 2. The high work function PEDOT:PSS interlayer and the low work function Ca interlayer are present as hole- and electron-transport layers, respectively. Devices were spin-coated from chloroform and analyzed both as-cast and after solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The device performance attained using optimized SVA conditions for our materials are given in Table 2. J–V curves under AM 1.5 irradiation are reported in Fig. 4. The active layers of all devices were produced without the use of any additives, and as such this presents a potential route to further improvement. As-cast devices exhibited uniformly poor PCEs of <5%, save for BTR-TE which exhibited a surprisingly high PCE of 5.5%. Upon solvent-vapor annealing, improvements were seen in the short-circuit currents (JSC) and FFs for all analogues, and of the four novel materials BTR-TE is seen to possess the best performance, with an excellent PCE of 9.0% due to a high JSC of 14.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70%. THF was found to be the optimal solvent during the vapor annealing process for all materials save for BTR-TIPS, which instead yielded non-significant changes to the SVA-treated device performance as compared to the as-cast films. We hypothesized this to be due to limited solubilization and reorganization of the blend by THF, whereas the more solubilizing CHCl3 – investigated in our previous work – was found to significantly improve performances.43

The high JSC observed from the thioester-functionalized material is particularly surprising given its lower absorption in the red portion of the solar spectrum, which we attribute to reduced 2D conjugation. The lower performance of BTR-TIPS devices is a result of the extremely low JSC of 8.4 mA cm−2 which can partially be attributed to both the large HOMO–LUMO energy gap, resulting in reduced solar spectrum harvesting and photocurrent loss, and the low hole mobilities.44 The two alkylthienyl-functionalized materials (BTR-H and BTR-EH) both possess sub-optimal JSC and FFs which, upon GIWAXS analysis of our materials, we hypothesize to be due to poor thin-film morphologies hindering charge transport and collection. This will be discussed in more depth below.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. S10.1†) were performed on the optimized devices. Out of all four new materials, BTR-TE exhibits the highest EQE at over 70% in the visible region from 350 to 700 nm, and BTR-TIPS the lowest at around ∼50%. The JSCs calculated by integrating the product of photon flux and EQE at each wavelength for all four materials were in good agreement with the measured JSCs (Table S1†). The earlier discrepancy between the low absorption coefficient of BTR-TE and its high OPV performance is partially resolved via space charge limited current (SCLC) hole mobility measurements (Fig. S11.1†), where BTR-TE was found to display high hole mobilities of 9.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 m−1. This suggests that the high EQE recorded is due to its excellent charge transport properties, which surpasses that of BTR-TIPS (2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 m−1), BTR-H (3.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 m−1) and BTR-EH (7.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 m−1), albeit below that of BTR (1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 m−1 from our previous work).
To investigate the causes of this difference in performance, an in-depth morphological analysis was undertaken.
Surface topography
We first examine the surface morphology of the films of our analogues through atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. S12.1†). The as-cast film of BTR-TIPS shows large aggregates generally over 200 nm in diameter, which visibly crystallize upon SVA but still retain their relatively large widths. BTR-TE, BTR-H and BTR-EH all exhibit much smaller domains with diameters on the order of tens of nanometers, and with a much higher degree of interpenetration.
Molecular nanoscale structure and bulk morphology
2D-GIWAXS studies were performed to better understand OSC performances of our analogues as a function of their molecular structure. We prepared spin-coated thin films of each analogue under three sets of processing conditions (i) neat, (ii) in a 1:1 blend with PC71BM, (iii) in a 1:1 blend of PC71BM with SVA, using identical conditions to those that gave us the best PCE. A thermally-annealed BTR film is also analyzed, as from our previous studies we have shown that BTR:PC71BM blends are not stable under thermal annealing conditions, with a significant PCE loss observed. GIWAXS scattering patterns of BTR (Fig. 5), BTR-TIPS (Fig. 6), BTR-TE (Fig. 7), BTR-H (Fig. 8) and BTR-EH (Fig. 9) can be seen along with line cuts of peak intensity along the horizontal (qxy) and vertical (qz) axes. Scattering peaks along the horizontal and vertical axes are indicative of reflections parallel (in-plane) and perpendicular (out-of-plane) to the film substrate, respectively.

Approximate sizes of the crystallites that give rise to coherent scattering are calculated from the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the scattering peaks corresponding to the out-of-plane (100) lamellar reflections using the Scherrer equation (eqn (1)) which relates peak width, a shape factor K (for which we have used a value of 1) and the crystallite coherence length (CCL):45 (1)
The orientation distribution of the reflecting planes in the thin-film can be quantified utilizing the Hermans' orientation parameter S.46 Here we determine S, from either the (100) or (020) reflections, by considering the intensity of the peak as a function of the polar angle χ.38 Using this analysis, for the (100) reflection a value of 1, 0 or −0.5 indicates the reflecting plane is completely parallel, randomly-oriented or completely perpendicular to the substrate, respectively,47 while for the (020) reflection values of 1, 0 or −0.5 indicate a perpendicular, random or parallel orientation. A full summary of our GIWAXS data for films measured at the critical angle containing the calculated Hermans' orientation parameter, CCL and d-spacings for the (100) alkyl lamellar, and (020) π–π stacking distances is given in Table 3.

In our previous work we had reported GIWAXS scattering patterns for as-cast neat BTR thin-films.32 Here we expand this to include scattering patterns for films that are more representative of those used in OSC devices (Fig. 5b–d). The neat film exhibits a scattering pattern with good long-range order as indicated by the peaks we have assigned to the first, second and third (h00) lamellar reflections at q = 0.33 Å−1, 0.66 Å−1 and 1.00 Å−1 respectively. A peak assigned to the (020) pi-stacking reflection can be seen at q = 1.65 Å−1 in the vertical axis. For molecular architectures that host alkyl sidechains oriented away from the conjugated backbone, it is expected that the direction of lamellar stacking be normal to that of pi-stacking. As such the presence of a vertically-aligned (020) peak alongside the stronger (h00) lamellar reflections in the same axis suggests a ‘rolling log’ molecular orientation, where the BTR molecules resemble a 2D ‘powder’ locked in-plane along the long axis of the conjugated backbone. This shifts the apparent orientations of the lamellar and π-stacking scattering so that they appear to be primarily out-of-plane, whereas these ‘rolling log’ orientations typically adopt a statistically-random isotropic distribution.48,49 For a further analysis of these orientations in neat BTR films, refer to our earlier work.32 Upon addition of the fullerene acceptor, a broad, isotropic reflection at q = 1.31 Å−1 is observed corresponding to amorphous PC71BM.35,50 The degree of long-range order and crystallinity in the thin-film is reduced, with a broadening of the FWHM for the lamellar reflections and increasing isotropy of the pi-stacking reflection (Fig. 5b and e) indicative of the increasing disorder of the film. CCLs calculated for the as-cast blend films of 18.7 nm are significantly reduced compared to that of the as-cast neat films (29.5 nm). Upon SVA treatment, some of this crystallinity and order is restored, with the appearance of multiple scattering reflections in both axes around q = 0.6–0.8 Å−1 and a decreased FWHM of the (020) peak in the vertical axis. Peak narrowing observed for the (100) peak (Fig. 5g) results in increased CCLs of 22.9 nm. This increased crystallinity is not unexpected – the SVA-enabled migration of active-layer components into more-ordered domains is well-documented for BTR.43 SVA-treated films appear to retain the broader (020) reflection induced by the addition of the fullerene, with a higher degree of molecular isotropy relative to the as-cast neat film. The crystallinity of the blend film is increased again after it is subject to thermal annealing, with multiple off-axis scattering peaks around q = 0.7–1.2 Å−1 observed that are not present in the SVA-treated films (Fig. 5h). FWHMs for both the (100) and the (020) reflection intensity peaks are reduced, and a relatively large CCL of 29.7 nm is calculated, surpassing those of the neat BTR films. d-Spacings for lamellar reflections are calculated to be 1.88 nm for the neat film, which is reduced to 1.84–1.85 nm for all films after the fullerene acceptor is added with this small change potentially due to a minor aggregation effect within the BTR domains induced by phase separation. The π-stacking distances of 0.38 nm are constant between all films and are typical of that for organic semiconductor materials. Hermans' orientation parameters of ∼−0.10–0.02 are calculated for all BTR films and agree with the previous assessment of an isotropically-oriented film. We also see over-crystallised films after thermal annealing that have been shown to lead to poor OSC performance.43
As-cast neat films of BTR-TIPS exhibit a molecular orientation that is weakly face-on (Fig. 6a and d) with a calculated S of −0.19. Second and third order lamellar reflections can be distinguished, with calculated (100) d-spacings of 1.69 nm. A CCL of 22.7 nm is obtained. In the as-cast blend film, much like BTR, these CCLs are significantly reduced to 12.6 nm. The slight face-on preference of the neat film appears to have been lost as per the stronger (100) peak intensity along the vertical axis, while the (020) peak intensities along the two axes indicates a large population of isotropically oriented crystallites. After SVA treatment a significant change in film morphology can be observed in the scattering pattern with the development of multiple off-axis reflections (Fig. 6c and e) and analysis of the (020) reflection again suggests that the SVA-treated film, like BTR, also exhibits a ‘rolling log’ orientation. Most notably however is the apparent shifting of the out-of-plane lamellar packing from q = 0.36 Å−1 (in the as-cast blend) to at q = 0.48 Å−1, with a corresponding decrease of the d-spacing from 1.72 nm to 1.31 nm. The in-plane lamellar peak however remains at a similar position to that in the as-cast blend at q = 0.37 Å−1, with this suggesting the formation of two lamellar polymorphs, each with relatively anisotropic (100) reflections. Here we denote the major polymorph (characterized by a higher population, as determined by peak intensity) and an out-of-plane packing with a d-spacing of 1.31 nm as polymorph 1, and the minor polymorph with in-plane packing and a d-spacing of 1.68 nm as polymorph 2. Polymorph 1 is calculated to have a relatively large CCL of 23.9 nm, suggesting that SVA treatment has resulted in the partial reorganization of the film into larger crystallites that show tight packing between lamellar planes. The theoretical (100) reflection (calculated from the simulated powder diffraction pattern from the unit cell of the single-crystal structure, Fig. 6g and S14.1†) corresponds well to the experimental (100) reflection obtained from polymorph 2 in the SVA annealed film. This suggests that the packing structure adopted by polymorph 1, induced by the annealing process, deviates from the packing structure of the single-crystal. Additionally, as seen from the single-crystal structure unlike BTR – as shown from our previous publication – the BDT cores of BTR-TIPS are highly offset in the π-stacking axis, with each core sandwiched between terminal thiophenes of the oligothiophene bridge, and do not stack into the centrosymmetric π-dimers that BTR exhibits.32 This could theoretically contribute to the lower JSC observed, and is in accordance with the low hole mobility determined from SCLC measurements.

BTR-TE behaves morphologically in a similar manner to BTR, with the neat as-cast film exhibiting narrowly-distributed lamellar reflections in the vertical axis and a broad, halo-like distribution of the (020) pi-stacking reflection. The as-cast blend film possesses decreased long-range order, molecular orientation and overall crystallinity. PC71BM addition to the donor material again serves to reduce crystallite size, with a decrease from 27.3 nm to 12.2 nm. d-Spacing also remains largely unaffected, with a lamellar spacing of ∼1.70 nm calculated for all BTR-TE films regardless of processing conditions. SVA treatment increases the overall crystallinity of the donor material, with an increased CCL of 19.3 nm, although it also confers a higher degree of isotropy to the (020) pi-stacking reflection that the as-cast film lacks.
Unlike the other BTR-analogues, BTR-H and BTR-EH share an unambiguous edge-on molecular orientation, which is clearly visible in the neat films (Fig. 8a and 9a) and persists throughout the addition of PC71BM and SVA. Scattering patterns for both analogues exhibit long-range lamellar reflections in the vertical axes that appear to be typical for our BTR-type molecules, from which we can calculate d-spacings that decrease in length to ∼1.85 nm in SVA-treated films from the neat, as-cast films. Curiously enough, unlike our other analogues crystalline order is maintained in our blend, as-cast films, as evidenced by the clearly-visible, narrowly-distributed (200) and (300) reflections in Fig. 8b and 9b (020) reflections are almost exclusively observed in the horizontal qxy axis at q = 1.68 Å−1 for all films. Relatively high Hermans' orientation parameters of ∼0.2–0.25 as calculated from the (100) reflections support this edge-on conjecture. CCLs calculated for both analogues follow the familiar trend of decreasing upon the addition of PC71BM, and increasing upon SVA treatment to 20.5 and 22.1 nm for BTR-H and BTR-EH, respectively.
To summarize our findings, at the critical incident angle BTR, BTR-TIPS and BTR-TE all feature isotropic, ‘rolling log’ molecular orientations to some degree, whereas BTR-H and BTR-EH exhibit predominantly edge-on orientations with (100) and (020) reflections located primarily on the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively. Uniquely, upon SVA the BTR-TIPS analogue exhibits multiple off-axis reflections and polymorphism along with a large CCL of 23.9 nm, which we attribute to a relatively higher degree of crystalline structure. For all other analogues, as expected, solvent-vapor annealing results in increased crystallite correlation lengths and decreased lamellar d-spacing to varying degrees, due to the reorganization of kinetically-trapped structures from the spin-coating process into larger and more well-ordered domains.51
Using this data we are able to observe a correlation between device morphology and performance. We find that our two high-performing materials with PCEs > 9% (BTR and BTR-TE) both display isotropic, ‘rolling log’ orientations of their conjugated backbones with respect to the substrate, while our two materials displaying edge-on orientations possess relatively worse performances. This also correlates well with the measured hole mobilities for these materials, suggesting a relationship between orientation, charge mobility and performance. Several high-performance semiconductor materials also report similar ‘rolling log’ orientational distributions in thin films, and there is evidence to suggest that such orientations allow an extended three-dimensional network for enhanced charge transport.52–54 While BTR-TIPS is also seen to possess an isotropic orientation it also possesses highly offset π-stacked BDT cores, representing an interplay of factors that may have resulted in the low charge mobilities observed. It is generally accepted that face-on orientation is beneficial for charge conduction in a vertically-stacked OSC device and so the fact that edge-on orientations are generally detrimental to OSC performance is not a novel one. However, we seek to shed some light on the source of the orientations of BTR and BTR-TE, as opposed to their edge-on counterparts BTR-H and BTR-EH and relate this to the molecular structure. For this, we turn to depth-profiling of the GIWAXS films.
Depth profiling
As previously mentioned, in GIWAXS measurements the choice of incident angle θ determines the region of the film that is analyzed. When the incident angle is smaller than the critical angle θc for total external reflection of the thin-film, the incident X-rays only penetrates into the sample as evanescent waves. These evanescent waves are surface-localized and penetrate up to ∼5 nm (representing less than 2.5% of the 200 nm vertical thickness of our active-layer thin-films), and so are ideal for probing surface-layer structures.55,56 At the critical angle, the penetration depths of the X-rays increase dramatically with a standing wave achieved, thus achieving the maximum scattering intensity. Angles above the critical angle similarly probe the bulk of the film, with variations in scattering intensity due to wave-guiding effects.56,57 Angle-dependent depth studies to differentiate between surface and bulk features have a strong precedence in the literature.39,56,58,59 Our previously analyzed films (Fig. 5–9) were recorded at θc, and so we look to incident angles above and below this to perform a qualitative analysis of the surface-to-bulk transition. We measured scattering patterns of our SVA-treated films for all analogues at incident angles from −0.02° to +0.01° around the critical angle (taken at 0.01° intervals). Both out-of-plane (qz) and in-plane (qxy) line profiles as a function of these incident angles are shown in Fig. 10. Here we show the line profile of BTR; the line profiles for the other analogues can be found in the ESI (Fig. S13.1a–h†). We can see that for scattering patterns of BTR taken at angles below the critical angle there is a roughly twofold greater peak intensity corresponding to the (020) π-stacking reflection pattern in the in-plane qxy axis (Fig. 10b) relative to the qz axis (Fig. 10a), whereas at and above the critical angle, the relative intensities for this peak are greater in the out-of-plane than the in-plane axis. The opposite phenomenon is observed for the first-order lamellar (100) reflection peak, i.e. that at <θc peak intensities from the in-plane axis are weaker than those in the out-of-plane axis.
 Fig. 10  GIWAXS one-dimensional line profiles at incident angles relative to the critical angle (denoted as 0.0°) are shown in the out-of-plane (a) and in-plane directions (b) for BTR. Vertical lines are drawn to direct the eye to reflection peaks of interest, which are labelled with their unit cell indices. 
We interpret these results to indicate that at a ∼5 nm thick layer at the surface of the film (i.e. the air/BHJ blend interface) a greater portion of BTR crystallites are edge-on, while at depths probed at and beyond the critical angle of incidence, they are increasingly isotropic. A similar phenomenon can also be observed for the BTR-TE analogue at θx = −0.01 to −0.03°. The BTR-TIPS, BTR-H and BTR-EH analogues do not display this behavior, where relative intensities for both the (100) and (020) reflections remain constant across the vertical and horizontal axes for incident angles below and above the critical angle, indicating that they maintain a constant orientation throughout the vertical depth of the thin film.
To further investigate these depth-dependent findings we first plot peak intensity as a function of the polar angle χ for both the (100) and the (020) reflections for incident angles around the critical angle to determine their respective Hermans' orientation parameters (Fig. S13.2†), with this data found in Table 4. The potential discrepancies introduced by the ‘rolling log’ orientation are partially accounted for via the sinusoidal correction factor for peak intensity in the calculation of S.39 We see that this highlights several of our key findings regarding our analogues' depth-dependence. The S (020) values measured from (θx < 0) scattering patterns, representing surface-sensitive measurements, are all close to −0.5 indicating a more edge-on orientation for all our analogues, save for BTR-TIPS. At and above the critical angle (at θx ≥ 0) BTR and BTR-TE all exhibit much higher S (020) values of −0.12 to −0.15, indicating more isotropically orientations, while for BTR-H and BTR-EHS (020) values remain constant to those calculated below the critical angle, indicating a similar level of edge-on dominant orientations. These changes in orientation are qualitatively apparent from scattering patterns of BTR and BTR-TE taken at θx = −0.01, 0 and 0.01° (Fig. S13.4 and 13.5†) where a clear edge-on orientation can be observed from the sub-critical angle scattering patterns. Curiously the orientation parameters calculated from the (100) reflections of BTR and BTR-TE at incident angles < θc return values close to 0 indicating isotropic orientations, which disagree with the highly edge-on crystallites suggested by the S (020) values.

While we are uncertain as to the cause of this, it is possible that these crystallites exhibit a lower degree of lamellar anisotropy at the film surface relative to π-stacking orientation and due to this uncertainty we utilize this reflection for our orientational analysis. This behavior is also apparent upon plotting the integrated intensity of the (100) and (020) reflections of our analogues along the qxy and qz axes against the incident angle (Fig. S13.5†) – while the relative intensities of the 100 reflections are constant across both axes, for BTR and BTR-TE there is an obvious increase in the qz:qxy intensity ratio for the (020) reflection at the critical angle indicative of a transition from edge – to face-on. Ultimately, these findings are perhaps best illustrated by plotting the Hermans' orientation parameter of the (020) reflection against the incident angle (Fig. 11), where the edge-on to face-on transition at the critical angle for BTR and BTR-TE is clear. From the available data we therefore propose that while most of our analogues are primarily edge-on oriented at the air/BHJ surface interface, BTR, BTR-TE and BTR-TIPS then transition towards orientations with an increased degree of isotropic, ‘rolling log’ arrangements in the bulk of the active-layer thin-film, while BTR-H and BTR-EH remain edge-on dominant throughout.
 Fig. 11  Measure of BTR analogue π-stacking orientation as a function of depth. Dashed lines between points are added to aid visualization. 
This edge-on dominance at the air interface is predicted in the literature, where it has been shown that for most spin-cast films of OSC semiconductors with BTR-type molecular architectures, crystallite nucleation tends to initiate from the air/BHJ interface as a primary site for solvent evaporation. Surface-energy effects at the air/BHJ interfaces dictate that edge-on crystallites are preferentially formed, due to the lower free energy of the alkyl sidechains relative to the conjugated backbone π-faces.59,60 The question then remaining to us is that of why there is a transition in the bulk away from edge-on crystallite orientations for some materials. While a definitive resolution to this is outside the scope of this work we propose a hypothesis by first considering the relative solubilities of our analogues in chloroform – the solvent from which they were deposited (BTR-H < BTR-EH < BTR-TIPS < BTR-TE < BTR, in order of increasing solubility) and the effect that this has on the kinetics of films formation. BTR and BTR-TE possess higher solubilities than their counterpart analogues, and therefore would tend to form nucleates at later stages of the spin coating process. This delayed nucleation and reduced solution volume could then potentially allow crystallite formation to initiate not just at the air/film interface, but also in the film bulk, and therefore be exposed to orientational influences from other interfacial regions. This could then explain the spectrum of crystallite orientations seen for our more soluble and high-performing materials, due to co-existing top-down and bottom-up crystallization processes (Fig. 12). The crystallite orientation for our less soluble and therefore faster-crystallizing analogues on the other hand would be predominantly influenced by the air/blend interface.
 Fig. 12  Formation of crystallite orientation during the spin-coating process as a function of solubility. Higher-solubility materials will nucleate at decreased solvent volumes than lower-solubility materials, and therefore crystallite orientations will be exposed to influences from both the air/blend and blend/substrate interfacial regions, resulting in a top-down transition from edge-on to isotropic crystallites. 
Conclusions
We investigated the effect of 2D core structure on molecular solubility, thin-film morphology and performance. To do so we synthesized four novel BDT-based p-type OSC semiconductors, with the thioester-functionalized analogue BTR-TE possessing excellent PCEs of ∼9%. Upon GIWAXS analysis of the thin-films we find a correlation between our highest-performing BDT-based materials with those that feature an isotropic distribution of crystallites with respect to the substrate which have been shown to facilitate enhanced charge conduction through an extended π-network. Hole mobilities from SCLC measurements are in good agreement with OPV performances of our materials, suggesting a relationship between this isotropic molecular orientation, high charge mobilities and high OPV performances.
GIWAXS depth-profiling revealed that these high-performing materials contained primarily edge-on oriented crystallites at the air/BHJ interface, which transitions towards an increasing isotropic orientation deeper into the film bulk. We hypothesize that this morphology could be due to the slower crystallization kinetics during the spin-coating process derived from the greater solubilizing properties of the dialkylthienyl and thioester core substituents of BTR and BTR-TE. While further work needs to be carried out to verify this, nonetheless we believe these results to be a valuable structure–property analysis contributing to the understanding of sidechain engineering and its potential impact on bulk morphology and OSC performances.

 	Fig. 11  Measure of BTR analogue π-stacking orientation as a function of depth. Dashed lines between points are added to aid visualization.	 

 	Fig. 12  Formation of crystallite orientation during the spin-coating process as a function of solubility. Higher-solubility materials will nucleate at decreased solvent volumes than lower-solubility materials, and therefore crystallite orientations will be exposed to influences from both the air/blend and blend/substrate interfacial regions, resulting in a top-down transition from edge-on to isotropic crystallites.
