    , Accepted 18th September 2015First published on 18th September 2015AbstractThe storage of renewable energy through the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2RR) is an attractive strategy to transform the current linear utilisation of carbon fuels (extraction–combustion–CO2 release) into an increasingly cyclic one. An electrochemical alternative for energy storage is the production of H2 from water splitting, studied for decades and commercially available up to the megawatt range. By comparing the technological similarities between these two processes, it is possible to extract both a global perspective and research directions for the eCO2RR. Herein, the main limiting phenomena affecting CO2 electrolysers and their causes are outlined first. This is followed by the derivation, for several eCO2RR products, of targets in terms of durability, current efficiency, energy efficiency, faradaic efficiency, and overvoltage, which must be achieved for the eCO2RR to reach a similar energy storage capability as the electrochemical production of H2. By comparing these figures of merit with the eCO2RR literature, we conclude that the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and formic acid lead the race towards practical use, although both still exhibit major performance gaps. The present energy efficiencies are low, mainly due to high overvoltages, and durability is not yet a developed research area. Besides the development of more efficient electrocatalysts, research advances on the fronts of electrode and electrolyser design, coupled with the optimisation of methods for the preparation of electrodes, are expected to push forward the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on its way to viability.
Introduction
The utilisation of CO2 can be divided into two large categories: technological utilisation and enhanced biological utilisation.1 Technological utilisation requiring the transformation of CO2 can be in turn divided into two groups:2 those in which carbon keeps its +4 oxidation state and those in which it is reduced to +2 or lower (Fig. 1). The first group, aimed at the production of urea, polymeric materials, and inorganic carbonates, for example, includes reactions with low energy exchanges usually provided by reagents such as OH−, amines, olefins, alkynes, and dienes. A catalyst is not always necessary, as in the cases of production of urea or salicylic acid. Typical products in the second group are HCOOH, CO, H2CO, CH3OH, or hydrocarbons. These reactions require higher energy exchanges provided by strong reducing reagents (H2, metals) and/or electricity, heat, or radiation. Within this group, the presence of a catalyst is mandatory in the vast majority of cases. As a first approach, we may consider the products from the first group as chemicals and the products from the second group as fuels.2 However, this is not a sharp division, since some reduced compounds such as CO, HCOOH, and H2CO find use either as chemicals or as reactants for fuel production. The production of fuels from CO2 is particularly attractive from economic and environmental standpoints, since the global market for fuels is 12–14 times larger than the market for chemicals.1 On the other hand, the economic appeal of chemicals is based on smaller production volumes with high added value.
 Fig. 1  The technological utilisation of CO2 can be divided into those processes requiring low-energy exchanges, where carbon keeps its +4 oxidation state and whose products are chemicals (non-reductive), and those processes with high-energy exchanges, where carbon is reduced (electrons are represented as minus signs in white circles) and whose products are fuels (reductive). Some compounds from the second group, such as CO, H2CO, or HCOOH, are widely used as chemicals but can be converted to fuels. 
Efforts on the efficient reduction of CO2 can be traced back to the 19th century for formic acid production,3 but only a reduced number of thermally-driven processes have become industrially viable, namely, the synthesis of methanol and the Sabatier reaction.1 This raises the question as to whether efficient reduction routes at low temperature, powered by radiant or electrical energies, can be designed. Nature contains some positive examples: even though most plants transform only 1–2% of the received solar radiation into chemical energy,4 the theoretical maximum efficiency of photosynthesis is around 70%. Although the evolutionary reasons for this are a matter of intense study, it is known that RuBisCO, the enzyme responsible in most plants for the carbon fixation step, is an inefficient catalyst.5 Nevertheless, the impact of a more active enzyme may be mitigated by the limited availability of CO2: assuming that [CO2] = 400 ppm in the air and dark conditions for t ≤ 0 s, the total depletion of CO2 ([CO2] = 0 ppm) on a sunny day (solar irradiation of 1 kW m−2) with no wind (0.16 cm2 s−1 as the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in air6) would happen at the surface of a leaf at t ≅ 2 s, considering a steady global energy efficiency of 2% for the photosynthetic reaction4nCO2 + nH2O → (CH2O)n + nO2. Another example of a CO2-reducing system can be found in bacteria living in volcanic environments, which possess enzymes with very high activity for the CO2/CO redox pair.7–9 Practical catalytic processes for low-temperature CO2 reduction are therefore a feasible objective.
Research on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity is justified by robust economic and environmental reasons. From a purely economic perspective, it shows potential for implementation on a large scale,10–12 with the predicted feasibility of the products decreasing according to the series CO ≈ HCOOH > CH3OH ≫ C2H4 > CH4.10 Agarwal et al.11 conclude that, at the present stage of development, the operation of an electrochemical plant producing HCOOH at a cost of around $500 t−1 would require at least 25 years to reach profitability. It is interesting to note that, in this case, auxiliary processes such as CO2 capture or distillation may be equally or more limiting than the energy consumption by electrolysers currently available.11–15 From the environment point of view, using emission-free energy sources is the only sensible approach to CO2 recycling, apart from direct artificial photosynthesis, which is at an even earlier stage of development.16
Hydrogen production from water electrolysis and the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) share several conceptual and technological features. The conceptual similarity comes from considering H2 as a fuel in the context of the emerging Hydrogen Economy,17 a term coined in 1970.18 They can therefore be seen as alternative technologies for storing electrical energy. Likewise, technological resemblances exist: both processes are cathodic in nature and the eCO2RR is usually complemented by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the anode. This leads to comparable designs for CO2 and water electrolysers (or fuel cells), as reflected by the use of similar membranes, electrode types, bipolar plates, etc., as detailed later. From a more fundamental point of view, the similar standard reduction potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the eCO2RR (Table 1), coupled to its much more simple and facile kinetics on a number of materials, make H2 the most common undesirable product in CO2-reducing experiments.19 We can put forward the prediction that the knowledge attained on the electrokinetics of the HER may facilitate the development of efficient catalysts for the eCO2RR capable of promoting the required intermediate hydrogenation steps while hindering H2 formation.

Currently, the stage of development of water splitting is more advanced,20,21 as easily deduced by comparing the dozens of active projects up to the megawatt-scale based on the electrolysis of H2O22–26 with the few projects in the kilowatt-scale based on the reduction of CO2.10,15,27 Besides the inherent complexity of the eCO2RR, a major reason for this is that the production of H2 from renewable energies in alkaline or polymeric electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers is a key component of a sustainable H2-based framework. Its study has been boosted for decades by its incorporation into well-structured, multi-annual research programs in the U.S.,28 Europe,29 and Japan,30 among other countries. Such programmes analyse electrolysers, fuel cells, H2 storage and transport technologies, and the infrastructure required to assess their short- and long-term commercial feasibility. Among their outputs, a set of publicly available targets covering all key technological and economic parameters is of great importance as benchmarks for researchers and engineers. Two examples of such parameters are the cost of H2, which targets $2 kg−1 in 2020 from its current price of $3.1 kg−1,31 and the energy efficiency of electrolysers, to reach 78% in 2020 from 76% in 2015.28 In the case of CO2 conversion, no parallel framework based on a CO2Economy is in place, though the seminal and concrete idea of a Methanol Economy proposed by Olah exploits the same concepts.32 Moreover, there is no clear set of target parameters in the literature for the eCO2RR, which should be specific for each potential product due to their different nature and end uses.
In this work, we analyse the eCO2RR from the perspective of a potential competing technology to water electrolysis based on their similarities. The identification and description of limiting phenomena for low-temperature CO2 electrolysers is outlined first. This is followed by a set of proposed figures of merit for relevant products and how they compare with the current state-of-the-art. Finally, some research directions for this process are proposed.
Limiting factors for the efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2
The performance of an electrolyser is limited by factors of different nature.33 Electrolyser design or thermodynamics impose inherent constraints, whereas other factors such as kinetics, power dissipation from the Joule effect, and mass transport limitations depend on the operating conditions and tend to increase the required cell voltage. The degradation of electrodes has a similar effect. The following paragraphs are devoted to the analysis of these factors and their related components for the case of the eCO2RR.
Factors independent of the operating conditions

Thermodynamics. 
The Nernst cell voltage of a CO-producing electrolyser with OER as the anodic reaction (E0(H2O/O2) = 1.23 V vs. SHE) under standard conditions would be (−0.11) − 1.23 = −1.34 V (Table 1), corresponding to ΔG = 257 kJ mol−1 according to eqn (1),34 (1)where n is the number of electrons exchanged to form 1 mole of product, and F is Faraday's constant. This value, however, is not necessarily the minimum theoretical cell voltage, because the enthalpy change between reactants and products is provided by both electricity and heat (ΔH = ΔG + TΔS). For endothermic reactions in electrolysers with no external heating system, the only available source of heat is the Joule effect. Thus, accounting for the entropic term requires the application of an additional overvoltage. Otherwise, the reaction would extract heat from the surroundings until the reaction stopped.
The thermoneutral voltage35En for endothermic systems is defined as the minimum voltage necessary to provide the required enthalpy change only through electrical energy, as shown in eqn (2). (2)
The calculation of overvoltages for CO2 electrolysers must therefore be referred to the thermoneutral voltage when applicable. Any overvoltage over the thermodynamic minimum implies an excess power which is eventually dissipated as heat. Following the CO example, the global enthalpy change of the reaction CO2 → CO + 0.5O2 is 283 kJ mol−1, consequently requiring an endothermic heat exchange of 26 kJ mol−1. Hence, the thermoneutral voltage is 1.47 V, which entails an overvoltage of 130 mV over the Nernst value regardless of kinetic considerations. Table 2 reproduces these calculations for relevant CO2 products, including the special case of syngas production (CO/H2 = 1/1). Water splitting is also included for comparison. All global reactions in Table 2 are endothermic, except for the case of formic acid, close to thermal neutrality. This is a special case, since its heat of dissociation should also be considered depending on the pH of the electrolyte. It must be noted that water splitting needs a considerably higher cell voltage than CO2 reduction except for CO. From this, it follows that (i) at cell voltages En(eCO2RR) < E < En(HER), the HER rate would be severely limited and (ii) the production of syngas in an eCO2RR reactor is as efficient as separate productions of H2 and CO from the thermodynamic point of view. From the kinetic point of view, however, producing hydrogen at the overpotentials typically needed for CO evolution would be energetically wasteful, since state-of-the-art catalysts are able to produce hydrogen at much lower overvoltages than CO. An interesting anodic reaction for fundamental studies on CO2 electroreduction in electrolyzers may be the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), due to its more facile kinetics than the OER. It allows us to ascribe the observed overpotentials almost entirely to the cathodic contribution, as it happens in polymeric electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In that case, all reactions would be exothermic (global reactions are CO2 hydrogenations), so the concept of thermoneutral voltage does not apply. Standard Nernst voltages would be those in Table 1.

Electrolyser design. 
Even though relatively unimportant for laboratory-scale studies, the design of the electrolyser is crucial to the performance of any electrochemical process on a large scale. There is no standard, well-established configuration for CO2 electrolysers. Several reactor concepts can be found in the literature, with most of them resembling the design of PEMFCs, in which the key element is a conducting membrane separating the cathodic from the anodic chambers.36–39Fig. 2, taken from Delacourt et al.,39 contains the most frequently reported configurations. Other designs are less common, such as the microfluidic reactor used by the group of Kenis.40,41 Designs including the transport of a species involved in the eCO2RR are, in principle, the most efficient ones. The simplest alternative entails using a solid electrolyte for either H+ or OH− conduction (Fig. 2a). In this case, the sum of the anode and cathode reactions accounts for the global process. However, designs that include only solid electrolytes seem to present low current efficiency for CO2 reduction products.39,42 This has been addressed by the addition of a liquid buffer layer, Fig. 2b, which is equivalent in function to the solid electrolyte but unavoidably adds some ohmic resistance. On the other hand, designs including the transport of a species not directly involved in the eCO2RR bring additional overvoltages regardless of the presence of a liquid buffer layer (Fig. 2c and d). Fig. 2c shows how the transport of HCO3− through the membrane may be equivalent to a reduced solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte, since only 1 out of 3 CO2 molecules reaching the electrode react to form CO. The other two are transported to the anodic chamber to maintain electroneutrality. This effect may explain apparent mass transport limitations observed by some authors.38,43 If a cation-exchange membrane is used, Fig. 2d, the pH of the anodic chamber tends to decrease as the cathodic reaction progresses, steadily increasing both the pH difference between chambers and the required cell voltage when the cathodic and anodic electrolytes are not continuously replenished.44

Factors depending on the operating conditions
The anodic and cathodic contributions can be modelled as overvoltages to be added to the theoretical minimum cell voltage (either the thermoneutral or the Nernst one). This is shown in eqn (3), E = En + ηact + ηohm + ηmt(3)where E stands for the cell voltage, ηact is the overvoltage due to anodic and cathodic kinetic activations, ηmt is the overvoltage due to limited mass transport in the anode and the cathode, and ηohm represents the overvoltage due to the presence of ohmic resistances. Different authors have modelled each term using diverse approaches.19,45–47 Their relative influences vary under different operating conditions, as can be seen in a general current–voltage curve (Fig. 3). The performance is kinetically limited at low current densities and is usually well described by the Butler–Volmer or Tafel equations.48 An almost linear response at higher currents is characteristic of predominant ohmic losses originating from the Joule effect, whereas mass transport limitation may arise at high current densities and is generally modelled by either Fick's law or the Poiseuille equation for multiphase flow in a specific pore network, when a more detailed description is needed.49

As the current density increases the importance of the different limiting phenomena varies. For every point the total voltage is the sum of the thermoneutral voltage and the overvoltages. The orange dot-dashed and blue dotted lines correspond to the kinetic and the ohmic contributions, respectively. The current becomes constant for pure mass transport limitations. 

Kinetics. 
The main kinetic obstacles of the eCO2RR are the large overpotentials and poor selectivity at industrially relevant current densities.21 Since kinetics are largely determined by the electrocatalyst and the electrolyte, these two aspects will be discussed next.

Electrocatalyst: in spite of remarkable progress over the last few decades towards practical systems, further research efforts are required. The incipient level of engineering is, at least in part, likely due to the current lack of industrially suitable catalysts. Cathodic overpotentials are predominant in the eCO2RR with the OER as the anodic reaction. For instance, the OER on iridium oxide catalysts can drive the cell voltage of PEM water electrolysers to 1.6 V at 1000 mA cm−2,50 which is only 120 mV above the thermoneutral voltage of 1.48 V (Table 2). With regard to the eCO2RR, transition and post-transition metals have been historically the most studied group of active materials.51–53 However, they all show onset overvoltages on bulk surfaces larger than 300 mV. Some of them exhibit high selectivities for CO (Ag, Au) or HCOOH (Sn, Pb, In, Hg), whereas Cu has attracted the most interest due to its relatively high selectivity for hydrocarbons. Selectivities above 80% in electrolyser tests have been obtained for CO and HCOOH using Ag and Sn catalysts, respectively, with H2 as the main undesired product.51 The poor understanding of the nature of active sites and the insufficient knowledge on the reduction mechanism are major drawbacks for the design of new active and selective materials. CO2 reduction comprises C–C and C–O bond breaking and formation steps,54,55 mediated by multi-electron and proton transfers. In electrochemical environments, DFT studies on transition metals suggest the transfer of a (H+ + e−) pair at each elementary step.9,54,56 Reaction pathways calculated in this way match experimental data and predict the limiting steps to become exergonic under lower overpotentials than under monoelectronic transfers (for the monoelectronic transfer, E0(CO2/CO2−) = −1.96 V vs. SHE,57 whereas the concerted proton–electron transfer CO2/COOH(ads) becomes exergonic at −0.41 V on copper54). Nonetheless, other materials such as oxides are known to be active through different mechanisms, such as the formation of CO2− (ref. 58) or a carbonate species,59,60 for example. Open research lines such as the use of oxide-derived materials,58,61–63 the role of metal–oxide interfaces,64,65 the influence of ionic liquids and organic molecules as potential mediators and co-catalysts,52,66–69 and the enhancement of the catalytic activity found in nanoparticulated materials due to size and composition effects70–73 are being developed in parallel with theoretical insights into the reaction mechanisms9,54,55,74 (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Main research directions on new electroactive materials for the eCO2RR. Most of them are based on the discovery of catalytic activity on bulk d- and p-metals in the 1980s. Nanoparticles and alloys can show very different catalytic properties compared to bulk metals (size/composition effects). The figure reproduces how selectivity to CO changes with the size of Pd nanoparticles. Some oxides as precursor materials result in highly active and selective catalysts (oxide derived catalysts). The figure reproduces the activity and faradaic efficiencies for oxide-derived gold compared with bulk. Some oxides and oxide/metal are highly selective catalysts (oxides and metal/oxide). The figure shows improved selectivity to CO2 reduction of Sn/SnO2vs. Sn. These figures are reprinted with permission from ref. 58, 64 and 69. Copyright 2015, 2012, and 2012, respectively.

The figure shows the effect of EMIM-BF4on the kinetic barrier of CO2− (from ref. 66 reprinted with permission from AAAS). DFT studies work in parallel with experimental findings to elucidate some reaction mechanisms and activity descriptors (Theory). The figure shows the proposed pathway for HCOOH formation on Cu, taken from ref. 54. 

Electrolyte: to date, practical CO2 electrolysis requires the use of a liquid electrolyte in the cathodic chamber, which, compared to PEM water electrolysers, implies an added complexity.39,75 Mildly acidic or alkaline CO2-saturated aqueous electrolytes containing inorganic salts with HCO3− or Cl− as anions and alkali elements as cations (e.g. Na+ or K+) cover the vast majority of reported experiments. Nevertheless, the electrolyte is known to play a key role in the kinetics by altering the activity and selectivity: for instance, the choice of the cationic species alters the electric field in the double layer, altering the relative concentration of charged species close to the electrode.76,77 Previous studies by Hori et al.76 have already shown how the cation choice between Li+, Na+, K+, and Cs+ profoundly impacts the selectivity on Cu electrodes, similarly to the case of Ag, where larger cations favour CO over H2 production.77 The choice of the anionic species, due to different buffer properties, influences the pH close to the electrode and therefore alters intermediate protonation reactions.78 In this regard, a parallel study by Hori79 with different anions (HCO3−, SO42−, and Cl−) also revealed different product distributions on Cu electrodes, confirmed by Wu et al.80 for Sn.


Mass transport. 
This is a common limitation in electrochemical reactors operating at high current densities. CO2 can reach the surface of the electrocatalyst either flowing through a porous medium or as a dissolved gas in a liquid electrolyte. A crucial limitation of the latter approach in aqueous solutions is that the content of free CO2 is low, reaching about 30 mM in equilibrium with pure CO2 at 1 bar and 25 °C. With such a low concentration, the limiting current density attainable is ca. iL = 60 mA cm−2 under vigorous stirring, according to the simple semi-infinite diffusion model81 shown in eqn (4). (4)
In this calculation, we considered a typical value for the diffusion coefficient81 of D = 1 × 10−5 m2 s−1, a diffusion length of δ = 1 μm, and a bulk concentration of  in the case of CO production (n = 2). 60 mA cm−2 is one order of magnitude below typical values found in industrial electrochemical reactors.33,82 Taking this into account, it is clear that a simple design involving an aqueous electrolyte under ambient conditions would hardly result in a commercially viable reactor. Consequently, high pressures, stirring, and/or the use of different electrolytes, such as methanol, must be added to the picture in order to reduce mass transport overpotentials. Studies on the reduction of CO2 at high pressures were mainly conducted in the 1990s by Sakata et al.,83–85 and the use of non-aqueous media has been an active research topic for three decades.86–89 The solubility of CO2 in media such as methanol or ionic liquids is several orders of magnitude higher than that in water, e.g. the equilibrium concentration of CO2 in a methanol–CO2 mixture at 40 bar is around 8 M at 25 °C,90 equivalent to a limiting current density of 16000 mA cm−2 (eqn (4)). Interestingly, current densities up to 500 mA cm−2 with moderate faradaic efficiencies (46%) have been reported under these conditions.91 However, the use of non-aqueous solvents carries its own set of cost and sustainability issues.92
The alternative, that is, the direct flow of gaseous CO2 to the catalytic surface, is achieved by the use of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) similar to those found in low-temperature fuel cells and water electrolysers. A GDE consists of stacked porous layers, namely, a commercial gas diffusion layer (a 100–400 μm thick carbonaceous paper or cloth with 65–80% porosity), a microporous layer (10–40 μm, 30–50% porosity), and a catalytic layer (>10 μm). CO2 is fed from the back of the electrode and reacts at sites where CO2, electrons, and protons (or water) meet, which are known as the triple phase boundary93,94 (Fig. 5). Therefore, GDEs must show high electronic conductivity, allow high accessibility for reacting species, and favour the efficient removal of the formed products. In light of these considerations, the proper design of a GDE entails a complex optimisation problem with multiphase physics that has received constant attention over decades.19,95,96 Currently, this approach renders negligible ηmt (Fig. 3) in H2 devices at practical current densities. In particular, the design of an optimized GDE for the eCO2RR should also include the gaseous or liquid nature of the target product and whether it is to be removed by backflow towards the back of the electrode or by “dumping” directly into the electrolyte. Electrolysers for eCO2RR using GDEs have reached remarkable current densities of around 200 mA cm−2 even at room temperature and ambient pressure.36,39,97

Active particles (red) are only those at triple-phase boundaries, where protons, electrons, and CO2 meet. The relatively low protonic conductivities of the membrane (σH+,M) and the catalytic layer (σH+,CL) typically account for the vast majority of the total ohmic resistance of the cell (σH+,M > σH+,CL). When the proton-conducting medium is a liquid electrolyte, the access to protons is easier, and σH+,CL should be close to that of the bulk solution. Electrons (white circles) flow through the support and CO2 diffuses through the pores. 


Dissipation of heat from the Joule effect. 
Ohmic resistances from non-perfect electro- and ion-conductors cause the dissipation of electrical power in the form of heat due to the Joule effect. Current and overvoltage are linked by Ohm's law, described in one dimension by eqn (5). (5)

σ
t is the electronic or ionic conductivity and x the spatial coordinate. For a given conductivity, it predicts a linear variation of the overpotential at a constant current. This regime describes with enough accuracy the membrane, the electrolyte, and the gas diffusion and microporous layers, as well as the electron-conducting components. The total ohmic resistance of a cell is highly dependent on a number of factors, such as the assembling procedure, the humidification degree of the membrane, or the operation temperature, but it is independent of the chemical reactions. It is routinely measured on-line as the value of the impedance with zero imaginary component at frequencies above 1 kHz, obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Out of the ionic and electronic contributions, the ionic resistance is the largest one. As an example, a Nafion® 112 membrane shows an optimum protonic conductivity98 of 10 S m−1 (comparable to that of a 10% w/w KHCO3 solution,99 7 S m−1), whereas the electronic conductivity of stainless steel reaches 1.4 × 106 S m−1. In PEMFCs and PEM electrolysers, most of the power dissipation occurs in the membrane: at 1000 mA cm−2, Nafion® 112 (thickness of 5 × 10−3 cm−2) dissipates 51 mW cm−2, which is equivalent to ηohm = 51 mV. In a CO2 electrolyser, the presence of a liquid electrolyte chamber is expected to provoke larger overvoltages. For instance, Kopljar et al.100 operated their cell at 100 mA cm−2 with ηohm ≈ 950 mV.

Eqn (5) predicts a more complex picture in a porous catalytic layer (Fig. 5). Both the electronic current density and the conductivity vary locally. As a practical result, the ionic resistance of the catalyst layer becomes an important contribution to the total one.19 This resistance is estimated from EIS by fitting experimental data to refined finite transmission line models (TLM).101,102 In the case of PEMFCs and PEM electrolysers, the addition of 20–25% of ionomer to the catalytic ink seems to reach an optimum compromise between the conduction of protons, the flow of other reactants, and the hydrophilic character of the resulting layer. Regarding the preparation method, deposition of catalyst inks on membranes, called the decal method, has proved to be valid for minimizing this resistance.103,104 Typical ionic conductivities of catalyst layers are around 2 S m−1 in Pt/C cathodes for PEMFCs.102 In CO2 electrolysers with an electrolyte chamber, higher conductivities are expected. However, to our knowledge, there are no reported values in the literature.


Degradation. 
Research on fuel cells and water electrolysers led to the identification of several degradation mechanisms, most of them directly applicable to CO2 electrolysers.105–107 The degradation of the membrane is one of the main reasons for shortened lifetimes. There are three identified degradation mechanisms for commonly used perfluorosulfonated acid membranes (PFSA): mechanical, thermal, and (electro)chemical degradation.106 The first one is due to cracks, tears, or pinholes as a consequence of hydration cycles, during which in-plane shrinkage (low humidification) and expansion (high humidification) occur. This results in the crossover of reactants between the anodic and the cathodic chambers, which is especially harmful if the oxidizing and the reducing agents can exothermically react as in PEMFCs. The thermal mechanism is associated with critical breakdown due to the glass transition of fully hydrated membranes at temperatures above 80 °C.108 Its origin is normally a locally high current density, which creates a hot spot due to the Joule effect. Edge effects at corners or borders or using a non-optimized catalytic deposition method are common causes.106,109 The (electro)chemical degradation arises either from the presence of radicals (mainly HO˙ and HOO˙), created by certain compounds such as hydrogen peroxide,105–107 or by the attack of foreign cations M+, which cause M+/H+ exchange in the terminal group R-SO3−H+ to yield R-SO3−M+, with the consequence of a dramatic reduction in conductivity.110 Among cations with affinity for sulfonic groups, Fex+, Nix+, and Crx+ are present in stainless steel used for reactors and piping. In a CO2 electrolyser, the membrane would be usually in contact with water, assuring a proper humidification; however, certain impurities arising mainly from “dirty” CO2 sources (Table 3) are likely to be present, as described below.

The slow degradation of the gas diffusion and microporous layers of a GDE due to the decomposition of PTFE, at high temperatures and high oxygen concentrations, is manifested as an increase of the hydrophilicity, although this effect is not considered to be critical.106,111,112 In contrast, the catalytic layer is much more sensitive to degradation. Supported nanoparticulated active materials suffer from particle coarsening, corrosion of the support, and poisoning: nanoparticles may dissolve in the ionomer phase and redeposit on the surface of large particles (Ostwald ripening), or agglomerate due to their high surface energy. In PEMFCs, coarsening of particles takes place during the first hundreds of hours of operation, causing a decrease of the electrochemically active area up to 50% and the loss of most undercoordinated sites typically encountered in nanoparticles.112–114 Another common phenomenon is the corrosion of the support,105,106,115 favoured by high temperatures, high water content, low pH, high oxygen concentrations, and high voltages.105,106 Out of these factors, only a high water content would be present in the cathodic environment of a CO2 electrolyser, but the anodic OER takes place under very aggressive conditions due to the combination of oxygen, water, and high voltages. According to Roen et al.,116 the oxidation rate of carbon supports according to the reaction C + 2H2O → CO2 + 4H+ + 4e− (E0 = 0.207 V vs. RHE) is negligible below 1.1 V due to slow kinetics. However, the presence of a catalyst such as Pt reduced the threshold to 0.55 V. When the support is corroded, not only its chemical properties and hydrophilicity change,117 but a loss of electrocatalytic material occurs due to its detachment and dissolution into the electrolyte.106 The third factor, poisoning, can be relevant even at trace levels of certain impurities, as low as 10 ppb of H2S for Pt in the case of the HER, for example.118 The presence of poisoning agents stems from the corrosion of the metallic body of the reactor or piping, undesired (electro)chemical reactions, or the use of impure reactants. Most metallic cations present in the cathodic electrolyte under eCO2RR will undergo reduction on the surface of the catalyst and, since almost all reduced metals show activity towards CO2 or H2O reduction, such deposits will lead to activity and/or selectivity changes. A concentration as low as 50 nM (Fe2+) has been claimed to be the reason for Cu deactivation after just 1 hour.119 Besides, reaction products can remain strongly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and block active sites, as is the case of CO on Pt,120 the proposed presence of CH2O on Ag,121 or graphite on Cu.122 Interestingly, in the latter report, authors claim that the presence of Cu2O on the surface of Cu avoided the formation of graphite and allowed for continuous electrolysis. However, a clear source of impurities for the eCO2RR is the origin of the CO2. Some processes provide extremely pure CO2 such as fermentation, but those appropriate for large-scale CO2 reduction, such as the flue gases from cement production or natural gas power plants, produce impurities above trace levels which are not trapped in carbon dioxide capture units (Table 3).123 Except for CO, all of them are potentially detrimental for the eCO2RR: nitrogen oxides may undergo preferential reduction to ammonia under typical cathodic voltages,124 which is a well-known CO2 capture agent. Special attention must be paid to the presence of sulphur due to its strong adsorption on numerous metals. So far, very limited reports on the influence of these contaminants on the eCO2RR are available. For instance, exposure to Na2S led to a decreased selectivity to CO on Ag125 or to CH4 on Cu126 (from 36% to 2%), though CO selectivity increased on a Zn electrode (from 15% to 44%).126 Consequently, understanding the impact of impurities and the quantification of allowed maximum levels in CO2 streams remain pending tasks.

Figures of merit
Qualitatively, an efficient eCO2RR requires highly active, stable, and selective catalysts operating in electrolysers with both low ohmic resistance and high mass transport properties. The quantification of these features is much more difficult. Although there are several parameters to characterize the performance of an electrochemical system, its practical viability depends on a few key concepts, namely, the current density, the durability, and the energy efficiency.

Current density. 
It is defined as the current flow divided by the geometrical area of the electrode. It is dependent, for a fixed potential, on the intrinsic activity, load, and utilisation of the catalyst, the transport rate of reactants, and the removal rate of products. Current densities for electrosynthesis reactors are usually above 1000 mA cm−2 for selectivities close to 50%,33 and from 500 to 600 mA cm−2 for highly selective electrolyses, such as the chlor-alkali process.82 Electrochemical water splitting in PEM electrolysers is an outstanding case which typically shows both high selectivity and high current density: 1400 mA cm−2 is achieved at moderate overvoltages with >90% selectivity.19
When H2127 and products from the eCO2RR are considered as fuels—either directly or as reactants for subsequent synthesis processes like Fischer–Tropsch—the rate of energy storage becomes an important criterion for comparison. Considering a current density j for H2 production, the equivalent current density for the eCO2RR can be derived as follows: each produced mole of H2 requires the transfer of 2 mol of electrons, and its lower heating value (LHV) is 286 kJ mol−1. Therefore, each coulomb stores EC,H2 = 143 kJ of electrical energy as chemical energy. Similarly, for each produced mole of CH4, 8 C are required and its LHV is 890 kJ mol−1, giving a value of EC,CH4 = 111 kJ C−1. As a result, an electrode producing CH4 should provide EC,H2/EC,CH4 = 1.28 times higher current density or be ca. 30% larger than the one producing H2 in order to have the same rate of electrical energy storage. From this perspective, j mA cm−2 devoted to H2 production are equivalent to 1.28 j mA cm−2 for CH4. Table 4 contains EC,i for other relevant products and shows that all of them require higher current densities than H2. EC,H2/EC,i seems to increase with the number of electrons transferred (see Table 1), which suggests that first electronic transfers in the reduction process are more efficient in terms of energy storage. Considering 1000 mA cm−2 as a representative value for PEM electrolysers, a similar eCO2RR electrode would need to provide CDH2 mA cm−2 (= 1000 EC,H2/EC,i) (Table 4). The alternative of a larger electrode operated at a lower current density is not optimal from the point of view of the capital cost. Hence, we consider CDH2 values as figures of merit for current density. Please note that these are not total but partial reduction current densities.

Durability. 
This is probably the least studied aspect in the eCO2RR literature. The gradual degradation of the electrode is accompanied by increasing overvoltages and eventual downtime once a replacement becomes necessary. Despite the importance of this factor for the large-scale viability of the eCO2RR, there are neither publications dealing with long-term stability tests (hundreds of hours) nor standardised stability test protocols. This fact points towards the existence of an almost unexplored field. It must be noted, however, that some efforts have been made to understand the mechanism behind the loss of activity of copper-based electrocatalysts during short tests.119,128,129 Some studies highlight the importance of the operation mode, as revealed by the enhanced stability of the catalytic performance when a potential programme including periodic anodic pulses in potentiostatic electrolyses was applied.129,130
Durability for electrosynthesis reactors is usually measured in years,131 with examples such as the chlor-alkali process, where electrodes typically operate for 3 to 4 years before replacement.82,107 Stability targets for electrodes with a steady decline of their performance are defined as the maximum rate at which the cell voltage is allowed to increase over time, as is the case for PEM electrolysers, whose typical degradation rates are below 15 mV every 1000 h.132 The nature of the working load strongly influences durability: stationary fuel cells have proven lifetimes as high as 40000 h, whereas an ambitious target for automotive fuel cells, whose load fluctuates to a large degree, is 5000 h.28 Regarding water splitting electrolysers, advanced alkaline and PEM types show outstanding operation times beyond 20000 h under mild reaction conditions,19,133,134 though they are reported to be very sensitive to factors such as the anodic catalyst load.135 Following the parallelism with H2 technologies, these figures suggest that CO2 electrolysers will probably need to reach lifetimes in the range of thousands of hours under typical cycling loads from renewable energy sources. We consider 5000 h as a first cornerstone for this figure of merit.


Energy efficiency. 
It is defined as the ratio between the energy stored in the desired products and the applied electrical energy. The definition of energy efficiency includes the concepts of overvoltage and faradaic efficiency. The overvoltage is the potential difference between the thermodynamically determined cell voltage and that observed experimentally, whereas the faradaic efficiency/current efficiency/selectivity for a given product i accounts for the fraction of the total charge used for its production, defined in eqn (6), (6)where ni is the number of electrons transferred per molecule of product i, mi is the amount of mole formed, and Q is the total charge passed in C. The energy efficiency is thus calculated with eqn (7), (7)where Eni is the thermoneutral or Nernst cell voltage for the product i. It should be noted that Eni + ηi equals the total cell voltage. Consequently, the reasons for low energy efficiencies are high overvoltages (energy wasted as dissipated heat) and/or low selectivity (energy wasted as undesired products). The energy efficiency of electrochemical water splitting technologies can routinely reach values over 70%.28,131,133 The global energy efficiency of methanol synthesis by catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 with electrochemically produced H2 (i.e. another green CO2 conversion process) is around 50%.2 Its high catalytic efficiency suggests this value as a reliable reference for other CO2 hydrogenations based on electrochemical hydrogen. Hence, a viable eCO2RR must show an efficiency higher than 50% to compete favourably. However, imposing a target of 70%, similar to H2 production, is demanding in terms of overpotentials for a process where very high selectivity is rarely obtained: for CH4, eqn (6) predicts a cell overvoltage of 164 mV at 80% selectivity. A more realistic value of 400 mV would result in 59% energy efficiency. We thereby consider 60% for CO2 reduction products as a figure of merit with more attainable overvoltage and selectivity requirements. We must note that this figure might be finely tuned for each product according to its typical faradaic efficiency, but here it is considered as the common reference for the sake of simplicity. Fig. 6a shows the maximum cell overvoltages allowed to reach 60% energy efficiency under standard conditions for relevant eCO2RR products. As an example, the maximum allowed cell overvoltage for CH3OH at 90% selectivity would be around 600 mV. High faradaic efficiencies tolerate relatively high overvoltages (i.e. over 600 mV), whereas a lower (though still high) value of 70% already imposes very restrictive conditions (ca. 200 mV). Fig. 6b separates the influences of the overvoltage and faradaic efficiency for the CO2 reduction to CO. The energy efficiency for compounds with lower thermoneutral potentials, like CH4, is more sensitive to variations in the cell overvoltage, as can be seen by comparing the dashed line (CH4) with the solid one (CO) at the same selectivity of 80%. From the point of view of the process, the faradaic efficiency not only influences the energy efficiency, but is also a critical parameter in determining the capital and operating costs. High values are desirable to reduce both the need of subsequent separation units and the energy requirements, but largely reduce the number of valid catalytic systems for this process. We propose 80% as a figure of merit requiring reasonable overvoltages of around 400 mV, according to Fig. 6a.
 Fig. 6  (a) Maximum allowed cell overvoltages vs. standard thermoneutral potentials for different values of faradaic efficiencies at 60% energy efficiency. (b) For the case of CO production, energy efficiency vs. cell overvoltage for different faradaic efficiencies. For comparison, the dashed line shows the case for 80% faradaic efficiency for CH4. 
The sum of cathodic and anodic half-cell overpotentials equals the cell overvoltage, but usually only cathodic half-cell overpotentials for eCO2RR are available in the literature. Nevertheless, at low and moderate current densities they can be considered as cell overvoltages with acceptable accuracy, since the OER displays a low half-cell overpotential under these conditions. For example, cell voltages for electrochemical water splitting in the literature average 1.52 V19,50,136 at 200 mA cm−2, which is only 40 mV over the thermoneutral potential (Table 2). Therefore, 40 mV is the maximum half-cell overpotential that can be assigned to the OER at 200 mA cm−2 (equivalent to assigning perfect kinetics to the cathodic HER). Since the vast majority of reports on eCO2RR show lower current densities, the corresponding OER half-cell overpotential would only account for a few millivolts.
As a summary, Table 5 contains the set of values considered in this work as figures of merit for relevant CO2 reduction products: current density (CDH2), durability, energy efficiency, faradaic efficiencies, and maximum cell overvoltage (η80%). The state-of-the-art parameters for H2 production are added for comparison. We must highlight that this analysis is focused on the production stage. For the subsequent transport and storage phases, production of carbon compounds is more advantageous due to their higher volumetric densities (e.g. CH4 9 GJ m−3, C2H5OH 17 GJ m−3) than hydrogen (0.1 GJ m−3). A global analysis might therefore provide less demanding requirements for CO2 reduction. Once limiting factors are described and target parameters proposed, the next section compares the state of the art of the eCO2RR with figures in Table 5 and proposes research directions to shorten the learning towards feasible systems.
Table 5 Considered minimum figures of merit for the eCO2RR with OER as the anodic process to be competitive with water electrolysis. Energy efficiency (E.E.), current efficiency (C.E.), and cell overvoltage (η80%) are not independent, see the text. η100% represents the maximum cell overvoltage allowed at 100% faradaic efficiency to comply with 60% energy efficiency. Cell overvoltages are calculated with the standard thermoneutral potential. State of the art for H2 electrochemical production from water splitting is added for comparison

Current status and potential improvements

Current status. 

Fig. 7 aims to convey how targets in Table 5 compare with the current status of the eCO2RR. For each product, a representative report of the state-of-the-art is plotted, with preference for those carried out in electrolysers at high current density and with good selectivity. Each axis of the pentagonal radar graphs ends at the corresponding value of Table 5. When a reported value from the literature exceeds the upper limit of its axis, it is represented as equal to this limit, as an indication of a reached target (e.g. selectivities higher than 80% are plotted as 80%). For the originally reported values see Table 6. An electrolyser reaching or surpassing all figures of merit would thus cover the entire pentagonal area.
 Fig. 7  Representative reports of the state of the art for relevant products from the eCO2RR with respect to figures of merit in Table 5. Overvoltage values are given under standard conditions. The overvoltage axis starts at the maximum overvoltage at 100% selectivity (η100%), see Table 5. Among similar reports, those with higher current densities and faradaic efficiencies were selected. When only half-cell overpotentials are available, they have been taken as cell overvoltages (see the text).

Carbon monoxide. 
Kenis et al.40 showed how joining benchmark catalysts for both the OER and the eCO2RR in a microfluidic reactor, after carefully selecting the electrolyte and minimizing ohmic resistances, leads to an improved system for the electrochemical production of CO with high energy efficiencies and current densities over 100 mA cm−2. This system, whose performance is shown in Fig. 7, shows very high selectivity (>90%) but large overvoltages. They also reported a remarkably low onset overvoltage of 20 mV for CO (operation point not plotted). Additionally, an example of a pressurised system reported by Sakata and coworkers137 with high selectivity and energy efficiency is plotted (brown patterned filling), in which the energy efficiency is increased due to a lower overvoltage. Other experiments at high pressure which are not plotted, such as the one reported by Dufek et al.,97 reached higher current densities (225 mA cm−2 at 80% current efficiency) at 20 bar and 90 °C, but with a lower energy efficiency of 50%, similarly to Saeki et al.,91 who used CH3OH as a solvent. We must highlight the outstanding CO partial current density of 3000 mA cm−2 at 70% current efficiency reported by Hara and coworkers138 at 30 bar in aqueous solution. Unfortunately, the energy efficiency cannot be estimated as the cell voltage was not reported.


Formic acid. 
So far, Sn catalysts have shown the best performance in electrolysers. Results from Oloman et al.13 are plotted. A remarkable net current density of 225 mA cm−2 was reported, but the energy efficiency was low due to high overvoltages. Recently, a report from Kopljar et al.100 included very similar values in spite of high ohmic losses. Regarding pressurised systems, Todoroki and coworkers84 successfully reached a notably high partial current density of 560 mA cm−2 at 60 bar in aqueous solution with 90% selectivity. Again, the lack of cell voltages in the report prevents any further analyses.


Hydrocarbons and alcohols. 
To the best of our knowledge, the production of methane, ethylene, methanol, and ethanol beyond the laboratory scale has not been widely studied. Typically, current densities are low. For methane, a high current efficiency close to 80% with an energy efficiency of around 40% was recently reported by Manthiram et al.139 A close case is ethylene, which has shown a high current efficiency (79%) but low energy efficiency (29%) and current density (36 mA cm−2).140 In another report, Cook et al.141 applied very high overvoltages (ca. 3000 mV) to achieve high partial current densities (280 mA cm−2). As for liquid alcohols, excellent energy efficiency (87%) and selectivity (98%) for methanol were achieved by Arai et al.142 at the expense of extremely low current densities, whereas only poor current and energy efficiencies have been reached for ethanol production.143
The analysis of Fig. 7 clearly reveals that only the electrochemical reductions of CO2 to CO and HCOOH currently exhibit current densities higher than 100 mA cm−2, which is a promising value but is still far away from maturity. The beneficial effect of using pressurised systems is also noticeable. In general, operation times only account for a few hours, and energy efficiencies over 50% and current densities higher than 100 mA cm−2 are not simultaneously reached. Nevertheless, we must recall that the optimisation of these systems is a multiparametric problem in a field which is still relatively young. Current catalysts operating under optimized conditions (in terms of pressure, temperature, electrolyte, etc.) in engineered electrolysers with low ohmic resistance and high mass transport properties would likely be much more efficient.


Potential improvements. 
We identify three main research areas in which remarkable developments in eCO2RR electrolysers may be achieved. The analysis of auxiliary operation units and equipment needed to complete a full process for electrochemical CO2 reduction is outside the scope of this contribution and is highly dependent on the product considered and the design of the electrolyser.


Catalysts. 
Maximum acceptable cell overvoltages at ca. 1000 mA cm−2 for the eCO2RR are around 400 mV (Table 5). To date, this has been a very demanding condition even if no overvoltage for the OER counterpart is assumed. Half-cell overvoltages below 300 mV induce no measurable activity on most known catalysts,51 and measured current densities are far too low even in catalytic systems reported to be highly active at low overpotentials.40,58,63,66 Taking this into account, it is clear that activity is a key pending challenge. Apart from Cu-based materials, selective catalysts for hydrocarbons and alcohols are rare,143–146 except for the case of CH3OH, which is the main product on a few semiconductors147,148 and oxides.149 Durability tests longer than 10 hours are seldom found in the literature,11,150 as most known catalysts tend to quickly deactivate. Hence, we put forward the prediction that durability tests will gain notoriety as catalysts achieve better activities and selectivities. All in all, challenges in activity, selectivity, and durability are still present, as these parameters reflect plenty of room for improvement.


Electrodes. 
Evidence that this technology is in the early stage of development lies in the fact that research efforts put on improving the performance of ‘real-life’ electrodes are still way behind those put on new active materials. This is in contrast to PEM fuel cells and electrolysers, in which a deeper understanding of the structure–performance relationships from the micro to the nanoscale has attracted increasing research efforts over the last decade.151–154 At the microscale, the modelling of catalyst layers155–158 predicts operation regimes which are far from being straightforward, as they depend not only on the composition and structure of the said layer but also markedly on operation conditions.155,156 At low currents, the reaction rate and the overvoltage are approximately constant across the catalyst layer (typically lcl = 10–100 μm) and the polarization curve shows the expected Tafel slope. In contrast, at high currents and with ηmt as predominant, the regime changes: (i) the electrochemical conversion domain shrinks to a fraction of the catalyst layer, located close to the interface with the GDL, which is inversely proportional to the current density (l* ∝ 1/i, l* < lcl), and (ii) the polarization curve shows a double Tafel slope, therefore doubling the electrical power necessary to increase the current density by one order of magnitude. An analogous situation arises when ηohm is limiting but l* is near the interface with the membrane, as depicted in Fig. 8. Besides, in the latter case, the overpotential is no longer constant within lcl, a particularly important effect in the eCO2RR in which selectivity and overvoltage are commonly strongly related. Typical l* at relevant current densities are 10–15 μm for fuel cells. For PEMFCs, l* ≤ lcl, but for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), l* ≪ lcl.155 At smaller scales, models on the influence of micro- and mesoporous structures on mass transport limitations revealed contributions from different transport phenomena, e.g. a significant contribution of around 40% coming from Knudsen diffusion into catalytic aggregates larger than 100 nm,157,158 which are typically found in Pt/C/ionomer layers. Down to the active site scale, experiments159 and theory160 describing the triple-phase boundary assign a surprising Pt effectiveness factor in PEMFCs below 5%. In spite of the similarities, to the best of our knowledge there has been no attempt to apply these approaches to gain insight into electrodes for the eCO2RR.
 Fig. 8  Models for generic catalyst layers predict a non-homogeneous distribution of the reaction rate over the catalyst layer (lcl) under certain conditions. If either the mass or ionic transport is poor, only a fraction of the catalyst layer (l*) close to the microporous layer or membrane, respectively, is predicted to be active. Production of CH4 is depicted as an example. 
Even more abundant are the experimental studies on the optimisation of catalytic layers for fuel cells based on variables such as the catalyst loading,161 the cationic resistance,162,163 and the optimum concentration of ionomers,164 among others. In contrast, only a very limited number of similar studies for the eCO2RR are available.36,165–167 An extensive set of reports is also available for the microporous layer in PEM electrolysers and fuel cells, aimed at the optimisation of key properties such as the pore size distribution and the composition, for example.168,169 In this context, there is a great opportunity to further refine the structural understanding of practical electrodes at the meso- and macroscales by applying advanced visualisation techniques originally developed for technical heterogeneous catalysts.36,170


Preparation methods. 
The importance of the preparation method of membrane-electrode assemblies (MEA) in fuel cells and water electrolysers has been known for decades,151,158,171 as the accessibility of reactants and stability of the catalyst markedly depend on it.94 Several methods, such as brushing, electrospraying, catalyst-coated membranes (decal), electro-deposition, and electron-beam reduction, among others, are all well studied. Catalysts for the eCO2RR are usually deposited on the surface of microporous layers, with little control over the final catalytic structure, either by impregnation of metallic salts followed by reduction or by deposition of unsupported nanoparticles.36,66 Deposition of supported catalysts suspended in catalytic inks, as is the standard procedure for H2 devices, is a limited practice.172 Only very recently, papers systematically exploring the influence of deposition methods for the eCO2RR have started to appear.36,100 For instance, Jhong et al.36 found a dramatic enhancement of the current density for CO production when an automatised catalyst deposition method replaced the previous manual procedure, and claimed a higher performance sensitivity than for similar electrodes for fuel cells. All in all, systematic studies of this kind in the context of the eCO2RR are still lacking.

Conclusions and outlook
This work proposes a first set of figures of merit for different products from the electrochemical reduction of CO2, aiming at competitiveness with the electrolysis of water. Our analysis is based on their joint character as technologies capable of storing renewable energy and on the numerous technical similarities shared by both processes. The set of proposed parameters includes current density (around 1000–1300 mA cm−2), energy efficiency (60%), current efficiency (80%), overvoltage (400–500 mV), and durability (5000 h). By comparing these figures with representative reports in the literature we concluded that the production of CO and HCOOH is currently the only eCO2RR process with current densities close to industrial application, even though it is still far from required values. C2H4 and CH4 show a similar degree of development, which is a step ahead of the production of CH3OH or C2H5OH. In general, good current efficiencies have been reported, but energy efficiencies are still low due to high overvoltages. On the other hand, durability is not yet a developed research area. Besides the development of more efficient electrocatalysts, research advances on the fronts of electrode and electrolyser design and the optimisation of methods for the preparation of electrodes are expected to bring the electrochemical reduction of CO2 a step forward on the path towards practical feasibility.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The technological utilisation of CO2 can be divided into those processes requiring low-energy exchanges, where carbon keeps its +4 oxidation state and whose products are chemicals (non-reductive), and those processes with high-energy exchanges, where carbon is reduced (electrons are represented as minus signs in white circles) and whose products are fuels (reductive). Some compounds from the second group, such as CO, H2CO, or HCOOH, are widely used as chemicals but can be converted to fuels.

 	Fig. 3  An imaginary current–voltage curve for an electrolyser with CO production (cathode) and O2 evolution (anode). As the current density increases the importance of the different limiting phenomena varies. For every point the total voltage is the sum of the thermoneutral voltage and the overvoltages. The orange dot-dashed and blue dotted lines correspond to the kinetic and the ohmic contributions, respectively. The current becomes constant for pure mass transport limitations.	 

 	Fig. 4  Main research directions on new electroactive materials for the eCO2RR. Most of them are based on the discovery of catalytic activity on bulk d- and p-metals in the 1980s. Nanoparticles and alloys can show very different catalytic properties compared to bulk metals (size/composition effects). The figure reproduces how selectivity to CO changes with the size of Pd nanoparticles. Some oxides as precursor materials result in highly active and selective catalysts (oxide derived catalysts). The figure reproduces the activity and faradaic efficiencies for oxide-derived gold compared with bulk. Some oxides and oxide/metal are highly selective catalysts (oxides and metal/oxide). The figure shows improved selectivity to CO2 reduction of Sn/SnO2vs. Sn. These figures are reprinted with permission from ref. 58, 64 and 69. Copyright 2015, 2012, and 2012, respectively. American Chemical Society. Some metal complexes and ionic liquids play the role of potential mediators or co-catalysts, reducing CO2 at low overpotentials (homogeneous co-catalysts). The figure shows the effect of EMIM-BF4on the kinetic barrier of CO2− (from ref. 66 reprinted with permission from AAAS). DFT studies work in parallel with experimental findings to elucidate some reaction mechanisms and activity descriptors (Theory). The figure shows the proposed pathway for HCOOH formation on Cu, taken from ref. 54.

 	Fig. 5  Scheme based on a TEM image of a cathodic catalyst layer in a GDE for CO2 reduction, formed by a supported nanoparticulated material with Nafion as the ion-conducting phase. Active particles (red) are only those at triple-phase boundaries, where protons, electrons, and CO2 meet. The relatively low protonic conductivities of the membrane (σH+,M) and the catalytic layer (σH+,CL) typically account for the vast majority of the total ohmic resistance of the cell (σH+,M > σH+,CL). When the proton-conducting medium is a liquid electrolyte, the access to protons is easier, and σH+,CL should be close to that of the bulk solution. Electrons (white circles) flow through the support and CO2 diffuses through the pores.

 	Fig. 7  Representative reports of the state of the art for relevant products from the eCO2RR with respect to figures of merit in Table 5. Overvoltage values are given under standard conditions. The overvoltage axis starts at the maximum overvoltage at 100% selectivity (η100%), see Table 5. Among similar reports, those with higher current densities and faradaic efficiencies were selected. When only half-cell overpotentials are available, they have been taken as cell overvoltages (see the text).

 	Fig. 8  Models for generic catalyst layers predict a non-homogeneous distribution of the reaction rate over the catalyst layer (lcl) under certain conditions. If either the mass or ionic transport is poor, only a fraction of the catalyst layer (l*) close to the microporous layer or membrane, respectively, is predicted to be active. Production of CH4 is depicted as an example.
