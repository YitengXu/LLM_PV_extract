Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered as a feasible alternative to silicon-based photovoltaic devices because of their ease of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency.1 The best and still most widely used electrolytes in DSSCs are based on the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox mediator (redox couple), which plays an important role of shuttling electrons from the cathode to the photoanode.2 To date, an overall power conversion efficiency of more than 11% has been achieved for liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs using the I−/I3− redox couple.3 However, I−/I3− redox couple is not the most desirable mediator due to the following drawbacks:4–7 (1) the corrosion of metal-based current collectors (such as Ag and Cu); (2) the high concentration of I3− (formed by the reaction of I2 with I−) absorbs a considerable part of visible light and thus reduces the efficiency of DSSCs; (3) the low redox potential of I−/I3− (about 0.35 V vs. NHE) needs a large driving force and energy for dye regeneration.
To overcome the disadvantages of the I−/I3− redox couple, elemental iodine-free redox couples have been investigated. For instance, Br−/Br3−,8 SeCN−/(SeCN)3−,9 SCN−/(SCN)3−,10 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO),11 ferrocene/ferrocenium,12 [TMFDS]2+/TMTU,4,13 binary redox couples based on the sulfide/polysulfide (S2−/Sx2−) redox couple and I−, hydroquinone (HQ)/benzoquinone (BQ) and I−,14,15 and the CoII/III redox couple and their derivatives have been synthesized and applied as redox mediators for DSSCs.16–18 Among the alternatives examined so far, the CoII/III complex redox couples have attracted a lot of attention because of their low visible light absorption, non-corrosive behaviour towards most current collectors, and the easy tuning of their redox potentials. Several impressive results have been recently achieved by using organic sensitizers in conjunction with CoII/III complexes in organic solvent electrolytes.19–23 For example, Grätzel and co-workers recently reported a record efficiency of 12.3% by the use of the CoII/III polypyridyl redox couples.19 However, the evaporation and leakage problems arising through the use of volatile organic solvents still restrict the long-term stability of the DSSCs.
Ionic liquids are organic salts with melting points at or near room temperature. They have been extensively studied as alternative electrolytes for I−/I3− redox couple-based DSSCs because of their low volatility, high conductivity, high thermal stability and wide electrochemical activity.24–28 Recently, elemental iodine-free redox couples, such as SeCN−/(SeCN)3− and thiolate/disulfide have been employed in ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs, which exhibited better stability than the corresponding organic liquid solvent DSSCs.9,29 However, to the best of our knowledge, the most promising CoII/III complex redox mediator-based ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs have not been studied so far, probably due to the very low solubility of the reported CoII/III complex redox couples in ionic liquid electrolytes.
With the aim of fabrication and characterization of CoII/III complex redox shuttle-based organic solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs, we report here an imidazolium functionalized cobalt tris(bipyridyl) complex, [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ (((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3 = 3,3′-(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-diylbis(methylene))bis(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium)hexafluorohosphate), which was synthesized via the covalent linking of imidazolium groups to the bipyridine ligand (Fig. 1). The synthesized [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ complex exhibits high solubility in ionic liquid electrolyte. This is the first time that the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ complex has been applied as a Co-containing redox shuttle for ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs. Using the dye N719 as the photosensitizer, overall power conversion efficiencies of 7.37% and 8.29% were achieved in a binary ionic liquid-based electrolyte (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodine (PMII):1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMINCS) = 13:7 (v/v)) under 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively. Both values are considerably higher than the efficiencies of I−/I3− redox couple-based binary ionic liquid electrolyte under the same irradiation conditions. One major point of interest of this work is to develop a redox couple based on complexes with high solubility in ionic liquids, and to develop DSSCs with even higher efficiencies in ionic liquid-based electrolytes.

Experimental section
Device fabrication
The fabrication of DSSCs was carried out as follows.30 The cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film. Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto cleaned FTO glass and used as photoelectrodes. A 3 μm-thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 5 μm-thick layer of 200 nm light scattering anatase particles was coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 0.3 mM solution of N719 in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (v/v = 1:1) at room temperature for 24 h. Afterwards, the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min. DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the ionic liquid electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a Pt counter electrode, which were separated by a 25 μm thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, Dupont) and sealed by heating. The cell internal space was filled with electrolyte via vacuum backfilling. The electrolyte injection hole on the platinized FTO counter electrode was finally sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass by heating.
Characterization and photoelectrochemical measurements
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were measured on a TU-1800 SPC spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation with a conventional three-electrode system. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl, the counter electrode was a Pt wire and the working electrode was a 1.6 mm diameter Pt electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN and the scan rate was 50 mV s−1. The Tafel polarization curves were measured with a CHI660c electrochemical workstation system in a symmetrical dummy cell with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminium foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.1 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 50 and 100 mW cm−2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a xenon lamp with a monochromater (Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were measured on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation using the AC impedance method at a forward bias voltage for the impedance measurement of −0.75 V and a frequency ranging from 0.01–105 Hz, under dark conditions and with an amplitude of 5 mV. The Mott–Schottky plots were tested with a CHI660c electrochemical workstation. The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as the fill factor (FF) and the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (PCE), were calculated according to previous reports.31
Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ and [Co(dmp)3]2+/3+ (dmp = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridyl) studied in this work. The details of the synthesis and the 1H NMR spectrum of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ are shown in the ESI (Scheme S1, Fig. S1–S3†). In addition, it should be noted that the synthesized [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ showed a higher solubility (>400 mg mL−1 at 25 °C) in EMINCS than [Co(dmp)3]2+ (∼0.03 mg mL−1 at 25 °C). The high solubility of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ enables the successful fabrication of ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs.
It has already been demonstrated that the redox potential plays a very important role in determining the photovoltaic performance of redox couples in DSSCs.18 Here, the redox potentials of the cobalt tris(bipyridyl) complexes were determined by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). The resultant CVs were calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), and the redox potentials were converted into those versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) reference scale by adding a constant of 0.63 V, as shown in Fig. 2a.16 From the CV curve of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ in acetonitrile solution, the reducing (0.462 V vs. NHE) and oxidizing (0.581 V vs. NHE) potentials were obtained, with a corresponding standard potential (E0) of 0.52 V vs. NHE. It should be noted that the redox potential of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ is about 90 mV higher than that of the [Co(dmp)3]2+/3+ complex (i.e., ∼0.43 V vs. NHE),32 and 170 mV higher than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (i.e., ∼0.35 V vs. NHE). The higher redox potential of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ is probably due to the substitution of imidazolium cations (a strong electron-withdrawing group), which stabilize the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the complex more effectively than the bipyridine ligand.16,17,33 Fig. 2b shows the energy diagram of the DSSCs sensitized with the dye N719. Since the redox potential of the dye N719 is 1.08 V versus NHE,34 the higher redox potential of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple will reduce the excessive driving force for the dye regeneration reaction, and therefore it is beneficial for improving the open-circuit voltage of the devices as compared with the [Co(dmp)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3− redox couples.34,35

Photovoltaic experiments of the pure EMINCS-based ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs were first conducted using the synthesized [Co(dmp)3]2+ (electrolyte A) and [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ (electrolyte B) complexes as the redox mediators. Here, EMINCS was chosen as the solvent electrolyte because of its relatively low cost and viscosity.14,26 To generate a redox couple, an oxidant nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4) was added to oxidize 10 mol% of [Co(dmp)3]2+ to [Co(dmp)3]3+, and [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ to [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]3+, respectively (Table 1). In addition, I−/I3−-based electrolyte C was prepared for comparison.

Fig. S4 (see ESI†) shows the J–V curves of the fabricated DSSCs devices containing [Co(dmp)3]2+/3+ (electrolyte A), [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ (electrolyte B) and I−/I3− (electrolyte C) redox shuttles under simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 in combination with dye N719. The detailed photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE), of the DSSCs are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the Jsc and Voc of electrolyte A are 0.78 mA cm−2 and 0.312 V, respectively, which gave a PCE of 0.08% under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2. This low PCE of the electrolyte A might due to the very low solubility (∼0.03 mg mL−1 at 25 °C) of [Co(dmp)3]2+ in EMINCS. However, all the photovoltaic parameters of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple (electrolyte B) were greatly improved under the same experimental conditions, and showed Jsc of 6.95 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.568 V, and PCE of 1.70%. Compared with the I−/I3− redox system, the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple-based ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs still showed inferior photovoltaic performance.
The Voc of a DSSC is mainly determined by the quasi-Fermi (EF,n) level of the electrons in the TiO2 film under illumination, and the redox potential (Eredox) of the redox couple.36,37 Therefore, a higher Voc of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple-based DSSCs was expected based on the redox potential values. However, lower Voc values of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple-based DSSCs were observed compared with the I−/I3− redox couple-based DSSCs. Similar results were observed for other CoII/III complex redox couples17,38 and one-electron redox couple-based DSSCs in which ruthenium dyes (such as dye N719) were used.12,39,40 The lower Voc of electrolyte B could be attributed to the high viscosity of the cobalt complex solution and the larger size of the cobalt complex, which limit the recombination of photoinjected electrons at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and thus significantly limiting the photovoltaic performance.32,41–43 Fig. S5† shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the fabricated DSSCs based on electrolytes B and C. Electrolyte B gives a much lower maximum IPCE value in comparison to electrolyte C, which is consistent with its lower Jsc value. The lower Jsc value of electrolyte B might be due to the slow regeneration of the ruthenium dye, or the fast recombination of electrons in the TiO2 to the CoIII complex.32,41
Compared with I−/I3− redox shuttle-based cells, [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple-based cells showed a lower FF value, which might be due to the low catalytic activity of the Pt catalysts on the Co-containing redox electrolytes.44–47 Fig. 3 shows the Tafel polarization curves of electrolyte B and C-based symmetrical cells. The exchange current density (jo), which reflects the activity of catalysts, was obtained from the intercept of the extrapolated linear region of the curve when the overpotential is zero.48–50 A lower jo on the Pt electrode surface was found in the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple-based electrolyte compared to that of the I−/I3− redox shuttle. These results indicate that the catalytic activity of Pt on the CoII/III complex redox couple is poorer than on the I3−/I− redox couple, thus resulting in lower FF values. In addition, the slow mass transport resistance of the Co-containing redox couple in the electrolyte is also a likely cause of the low FF, as reported by Klahr et al.41

The [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple was further studied in binary ionic liquid electrolyte (PMII:EMINCS = 13:7 (v/v)), which has been demonstrated to be an efficient and stable electrolyte for DSSCs by Wang et al.26 In order to optimize the concentration of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+, an optimized amount of the other electrolyte components (0.02 M NaOBF4, 0.14 M GuNCS, 0.5 M TBP in PMII:EMINCS = 13:7 (v/v)) was used. It is noteworthy that NOBF4 was added and consumed via the reaction with [Co((Melm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ before the addition of PMII, and thus could avoid the oxidation of I− to I3−. Some electrolyte components are referenced to the work published by Liu et al. using hybrid electrolytes containing the S2−/Sx2− redox couple and I−.14 Four binary ionic liquid electrolytes with different concentrations of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ were investigated (see ESI, Table S1†), and the best PCE value was achieved when using 0.05 M [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+. In addition, electrolyte E (I−/I3−) and electrolyte F (I−) were also prepared for comparison.
Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of the fabricated DSSCs containing electrolytes D, E, and F. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Compared with electrolyte E, electrolyte D based on the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple showed improved photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc and PCE values. Overall power conversion efficiencies of 7.37% and 8.29% were achieved under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively. Both values are higher than those of the I−/I3− redox couple-based electrolyte E. The higher PCE of the DSSCs containing the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple may be related to the I− provided by PMII. A similar improvement was also observed for the hybrid electrolytes containing the S2−/Sx2− redox couple and I−,14,51 as well as the hydroquinone (HQ)/benzoquinone (BQ) redox couple and I−.15 A control experiment was conducted using electrolyte F in the absence of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple. However, no power conversion efficiency of electrolyte F was obtained, which confirms that [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ used as a redox couple takes the main function of the components of the hybrid electrolyte system.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of electrolytes D, A1 and B1 were tested in order to gain insight into the redox process (electrolyte A1 contains the pure [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ couple and has the same composition as electrolyte D without PMII; electrolyte B1 corresponds to electrolyte A1 with an excess of I2). Two peaks are observed in blue curve (Fig. 5), in which the right peak (at about 0.465 V vs. NHE) corresponds to the I−/I3− oxidation.51,52 In the CV curve for the hybrid electrolyte D (black curve), the peak of I−/I3− disappeared, leaving a peak very close to the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/[Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]3+ oxidation (at about 0.581 V vs. NHE, red curve). This result is in accordance with that observed for the S2−/Sx2− and I− hybrid electrolyte reported by Cong et al.51
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of electrolytes D, A1 (electrolyte D without PMII) and B1 (electrolyte A1 + 0.6 M I2) in acetonitrile solution. The measurements were performed using 0.1 M LiClO4 as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
Until now, none of the published work employing dual redox systems14,51 has clearly explained the electrochemical process. From the redox potential in Fig. 2, it can be seen that I3− should be present as an intermediate in electrolyte D, which may play a role in mediating dye regeneration. Therefore, the redox mechanism of electrolyte D could be supposed as follows: under light illumination, the photoexcitation of the sensitizer (S) (eqn (1)) injects electrons into the conduction band of the nanocrystalline semiconductor (eqn (2)). Then the oxidized molecular dye is restored to its ground state by electron donation from an electrolyte-containing redox system, reduced mainly by [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ forming ([Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]3+ (eqn (3)). Since the redox potential of the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple is more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple, I− is then reduced by [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+ to I3− (eqn (4)). The electron injected into the conduction band flows through the conduction band of the semiconductor to arrive at the back contact of the anode, and then through the external load to the cathode, which is coated with a thin layer of Pt catalyst. The I3− receives an electron at the counter electrode, and in turn regenerates into the reduced form (eqn (5)).

Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis spectra of electrolytes D and E. It can be seen that the color of electrolyte D with a very low concentration of I3− is lighter than that of I−/I3− redox couple-based electrolyte E, which shows a strong visible light absorption up to more than 450 nm. The negligible absorption of electrolyte D indicates that the competition with the light absorption of the molecular dye sensitizer in the visible region could be avoided, which will be helpful to improve the photocurrent of DSSCs.

Fig. 7 shows the IPCE spectra of both DSSCs based on electrolytes D and E, which show high values of 78–82% in the 500–540 nm wavelength range. Compared with the iodine-based electrolyte, the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ system exhibited an enhanced photocurrent response in the spectral range from 370 to 480 nm, which is ascribed to negligible absorption of electrolyte D. Therefore, a higher Jsc value of electrolyte D was anticipated.

Furthermore, the DSSCs based on electrolyte D showed a higher Voc than that of electrolyte E. As mentioned above, the Voc of devices is determined by the difference between EF,n and Eredox. The shift of the conduction band of TiO2 with [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ and I−/I3−-based binary ionic liquid electrolytes was further measured by the Mott–Schottky method, as shown in Fig. 8. Compared with that of Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+, the conduction band of TiO2 with the I−/I3− redox couple is negatively shifted by 30 mV, while the redox potential of [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ is about 170 mV more positive than that of pure I−/I3−. Therefore, the value of Voc for the Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+-based binary ionic liquid electrolyte is higher than that of I−/I3− redox couple-based binary ionic liquid electrolyte.

It has already been demonstrated by Boschloo et al. that bulky substituents of the cobalt complex redox couple could slow the detrimental charge recombination reactions at the interfacial layer, and lead to a high value of Voc.53 Therefore, another possible reason for the higher Voc of electrolyte D is that the attached bulky imidazole groups may increase the steric bulk of the cobalt complex and prevent the electron recombination loss reactions at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, and thus result in a higher Voc.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then applied to investigate the interfacial charge transfer processes of the devices, especially for understanding the recombination dynamics at the dye coated TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte. Fig. 9a shows the Nyquist plot of electrolytes D and E measured at the bias voltage consistent with Voc, scanning from 10−2 to 106 Hz at room temperature in a dark environment, and the values of resistance are listed in Table 3. From high to low frequency, the three characteristic arcs of R1, R2, and R3 represent the resistances of the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface, the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively.54–57 The charge transfer process at the interface of the electrolyte/TiO2 electrode and electron transport in the TiO2 film was analyzed in the medium-frequency range (R2). The bigger the semicircle in the intermediate-frequency region, the smaller the charge recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces.58–61 It can be clearly seen that the R2 values of electrolytes D and E are 76.8 and 40.9 Ω, respectively, indicating that the recombination process between the conduction band electrons in the TiO2 film and electrolyte D is more inhibited.

Fig. 9b shows the Bode phase plots of EIS spectra displaying the characteristic frequency peaks of the charge transfer processes for the cells. The effective lifetime of electrons (τe) before recombination in the TiO2 photoelectrode is related to the inverse of the characteristic frequency and is estimated by the following equation:  where fmax is the mid-frequency peak of the Bode phase plots.62 The fmax and lifetime of the electrons are also summarized in Table 3. The electron lifetime for recombination (τe) of electrolytes D and E have the values 12.8 and 9.81 ms, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that electrolyte D yields a longer electron recombination lifetime, which favors electron transport over a longer distance with less diffusive hindrance, and finally leads to enhanced photoconversion efficiency.62 This result is consistent with that of the dark current characterization. Fig. S6† shows that the dark current of the device with electrolyte D is much smaller than that of electrolyte E, which suppresses the dark current at the TiO2/electrolyte interfaces, and increases the electron lifetime.
CoII/III polypyridyl redox couple-based liquid electrolyte DSSCs have been intensively investigated. However, data concerning the stability of the Co2+/3+ redox couple are very limited. Fig. 10 presents the time dependence of the photovoltaic data of the binary ionic liquid electrolyte DSSCs containing the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple. The cell was covered with a UV cut-off filter, and irradiated at open circuit at ambient temperature (25–30 °C). It can be seen that the devices containing electrolyte D retained around 76% of their initial conversion efficiency after 800 h of testing. The decreased conversion efficiency of the DSSC device is mainly due to the decrease of Voc and FF values (Fig. 10). The reasons for the device degradation are still not clear. However, compared with thiolate/disulfide redox couple-based ionic liquid electrolyte, the [Co((MeIm-Bpy)PF6)3]2+/3+ redox couple in the binary ionic liquid system shows better long-term stability.29

Conclusions
In summary, an imidazolium functionalized cobalt tris(bipyridyl) complex with high redox potential and good solubility in ionic liquid electrolyte has been synthesized and employed for use in DSSCs. The effect of the redox mediator on the photovoltaic performance was investigated in pure ionic liquid (EMINCS) as well as in binary ionic liquid (PMII:EMINCS = 13:7 (v/v)). Efficiencies of 7.37% and 8.29% were achieved in binary ionic liquid electrolyte under 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively, which are higher than those of pure I−/I3− redox mediator. It is hoped that this work will pave the way for the design of other imidazolium functionalized redox couples and develop DSSCs with even higher efficiencies in ionic liquid-based electrolytes. Further investigations will be focused on the optimization of the photosensitizing dyes, as well as the long-term stability of the devices.
