    , Accepted 18th May 2017First published on 20th May 2017AbstractThe study presents the synthesis of vanadium oxide/carbon onion hybrid materials. Flower-like vanadium oxide nanostructures nucleate on carbon onion nanoparticles under hydrothermal conditions, forming a highly intertwined network. By varying the amount of added carbon onions during the synthesis, the number of possible nucleation sites can be adjusted, resulting in the preferential growth of vanadium dioxide in either P21/c or C2/m space group. When employed as a lithium intercalation electrode, P21/c VO2 exhibits capacitor-like (pseudocapacitive) lithium intercalation, whereas C2/m VO2 shows battery-like intercalation peaks with a maximum capacity of 127 mA h g−1. By selecting an optimum ratio and thereby combining both intercalation mechanisms, enhanced kinetics with discharge capacities of 45 mA h g−1 and 29 mA h g−1 at high rates of 50 A g−1 and 100 A g−1 (equal to 394C and 788C) are obtained. This behavior can be translated to a device level by using the material as anodes in asymmetric supercapacitors with activated carbon cathodes, yielding a maximum specific energy of 45 W h kg−1 and a high power of 58 kW kg−1, while longevity over 5000 charge/discharge cycles is demonstrated.
1. Introduction
Fast and reversible energy storage devices are in high demand, with applications ranging from electric vehicles to temporary storage of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power.1 Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) have emerged as a promising technology for high power electrochemical energy storage.2,3 This kind of supercapacitor stores energy via the formation of an electrical double-layer at the fluid/solid interface, that is, electrosorption of electrolyte ions at the charged electrode of opposite polarity.4 Their purely physical charge storage mechanism enables high charge and discharge rates, yet the specific energy is much smaller compared to state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries.5 Typical EDLC electrodes consist of high specific surface area (SSA) carbons that can be distinguished into two groups:6,7 carbons with a high inner porosity, such as activated carbon8 or carbide-derived carbon (CDC),9,10 and carbons that exhibit exclusively external surfaces, such as carbon onions11,12 or carbon nanotubes (CNTs).13 The double-layer capacitance of EDLCs is limited to about 0.1 F m−2, related to a minimum in accessible pore size that is in the range of the ion size.14,15
One promising strategy for increasing the energy storage capacity is the implementation of redox-active materials, such as metal oxides,16–18 surface functional groups,19,20 or redox-active electrolytes,21–23 to extend the purely capacitive carbon system by faradaic charge storage (redox reactions). Depending on the electrochemical response of the material, redox-active systems are either described as pseudocapacitive (linear charge–voltage profile, such as MnO2 (ref. 24 and 25) or MXene26,27), or as battery-like (well-defined plateaus in the charge–voltage profile, such as VO2,28 V2O5,29 or VxTi1−xO2,30 among others).31,32 The synthesis of hybrid electrodes often employs wet-chemical approaches,33–35 atomic layer deposition,36,37 electrochemical deposition,38 or drop-casting.39,40 Apart from tuning the intrinsic properties of the electrodes, optimization of the cell setup by using different electrodes as anodes and cathodes is fundamental for further improvements. For that purpose, hybrid or asymmetric supercapacitors typically employ a metal oxide anode that utilizes a battery-like energy storage mechanism, versus an EDLC cathode.41–43 In order to achieve an optimized potential profile at the anode and cathode, the different specific capacities of the two materials have to be taken into account and be charge balanced by adjusting the electrode masses, since they determine the distribution of the applied cell voltage.44
The main obstacle of an asymmetric supercapacitor setup is to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the metal oxide anode,18 creating a demand for novel hybrid materials that enable significantly faster rates.31 Therefore, recent studies have focused on (i) the use of tailored mesoporous carbons that allow for the efficient incorporation of Li4Ti5O12 (e.g., ref. 45, up to 105 mA h g−1 at 350C) or (ii) the synthesis of core–shell particles consisting of crystalline/amorphous LiFePO4 mixtures encapsulated by carbon (e.g., ref. 46, up to 36 mA h g−1 at 300C). The most commonly employed strategy is admixing conductive additives with the metal oxide, such as carbon black or carbon onions.47,48 Particularly, the latter exhibit superior properties when used as conductive additives in supercapacitor electrodes.49 Carbon onions are spherical carbon nanoparticles consisting of several concentric sp2-hybridized carbon shells in the size range between 5 and 10 nm, depending on the synthesis method.11 By annealing of detonation nanodiamonds in an inert gas atmosphere,50 such as argon,51 a gradual transformation of diamond-like carbon to graphitic carbon is observed between 700 and 1700 °C. Complete sp3-to-sp2 conversion at around 1700 °C yields a high electrical conductivity of ca. 4 S cm−1.52 Besides the use as conductive additives, carbon onions have also served as substrates in hybrid electrodes.24,30,53 Particular attractions of carbon onions as substrates are the high interparticle pore volume and specific surface area of up to 1.2 cm3 g−1 and 600 m2 g−1, respectively, providing a large space for the deposition of redox-active materials within the conductive network.30,36
Vanadium oxides have been widely researched as redox-active materials for lithium and sodium battery cathodes.54,55 They typically exhibit two-dimensional sheet structures formed by corner/edge/face-sharing octahedra56 that accommodate ion intercalation reactions. Phases of V2O5 and VO2 are typically studied as a negative electrode in a half-cell setup against lithium foil, exhibiting several steps of lithiation, depending on the applied potential vs. Li/Li+ and on the crystal structure.28,56–58 Yet, only a few studies exist on vanadium oxide hybrid electrodes at a device level,33,59 that is, in a full-cell setup.
In a recent study, we investigated the properties of carbon onions coated with partially amorphous vanadium pentoxide via atomic layer deposition.36 When measured in an asymmetric supercapacitor setup against an activated carbon cathode, we observed a maximum specific energy and power of 38 W h kg−1 and 2 kW kg−1, respectively. Core–shell particles consisting of carbide-derived carbon shells and vanadium pentoxide cores showed even higher values of up to 84 W h kg−1 and 6 kW kg−1 with CDC as the cathode.60 The high performance of the core–shell particles was a consequence of the continuous carbon network that successfully enhanced the sluggish kinetics of vanadium pentoxide, demonstrating the high impact of the carbon substrate on the electrochemical performance of anodes in a full-cell. Consequently, when designing advanced anodes for asymmetric supercapacitors, it is crucial to carefully tune their structural properties to achieve a synergistic interaction between the metal oxide (for lithium intercalation) and carbon (providing electrical conductivity).5
In this study, we investigate the unique ability to influence the crystal structure of vanadium dioxide by using carbon onions as the substrate or as the admixed conductive additive for hydrothermally synthesized vanadia nanostructures, to obtain vanadia/carbon hybrids or composites. Carbon onions added directly to the solution during hydrothermal growth serve as nucleation sites for vanadium dioxide and are closely built into the nanohybrid, providing improved performance stability and rate behavior. Controlling the number of possible nucleation sites allowed us to adjust the crystal structure of vanadium dioxide. Our results reveal an optimum ratio of C2/m and P21/c for an enhanced capacity at ultrahigh discharge rates, owing to a combination of battery-like and capacitor-like (pseudocapacitive) Li+ intercalation, both in half-cell experiments and as asymmetric supercapacitor anodes versus an activated carbon cathode.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Vanadia nanoflowers were obtained by a hydrothermal synthesis route, as established in ref. 61 and 62. First, 1 g of vanadium pentoxide powder (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in a mixture of 20 mL of deionized water (Milli-Q, Merck) and 10 mL of diethanolamine (Sigma Aldrich) on a magnetic stirrer for 4 h. The pH of the solution was determined to be 9.8, using a SevenGo pH meter (Mettler Toledo). The solution was then put into a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined (PTFE) steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 48 h, before it was naturally cooled down. The product was then washed and centrifuged in a mixture of pure ethanol (Sigma Aldrich) and deionized water three times for three minutes at 1000 rpm. The resulting grey-black slurry was dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight. To obtain a high degree of crystallinity, the vanadium oxide nanoflowers were thermally annealed in a quartz tube furnace in argon (flow rate 100 sccm) at 500 °C for 60 min at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 and 40 °C min−1, respectively.
Carbon onions (OLCs) were synthesized from detonation nanodiamond precursor (diameter 4–6 nm, NaBond Technologies) via thermal annealing in a water-cooled high temperature furnace (Thermal Technology Inc.) in argon atmosphere at 1700 °C for 1 h, with a heating/cooling rate of 20 °C min−1.51 Different amounts of OLCs were employed as a conductive additive for vanadium oxide nanoflowers by simple mixing with a pestle and mortar (mass ratios of vanadium oxide to OLC were 7:2, 6:3, and 5:4) to obtain VO2–OLC–composite samples. For the hydrothermal synthesis of vanadia nanoflowers and OLCs (VO2–OLC–hybrid samples), different amounts of OLC powder were dispersed with vanadium oxide powder on a magnetic stirrer for 4 h (the same mass ratios as above; 7:2, 6:3, and 5:4), and the pH value was measured to be 9.8 (the same as without OLCs). The same hydrothermal synthesis process with subsequent thermal annealing as described above was carried out.
For electrode preparation, the powder materials were admixed with ethanol and PTFE (aqueous solution, 60%, Sigma Aldrich) in a mortar resulting in mass ratios of 7:2:1, 6:3:1, and 5:4:1 for vanadia nanoflowers to OLCs to PTFE. The obtained slurry was then rolled in a hot-rolling machine to about 100 μm thick electrodes and dried in a vacuum oven at 20 mbar and 120 °C overnight.
2.2 Materials characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with a JEOL 2100F system operating at 200 kV. Samples were prepared by dispersing and sonicating the powder samples in isopropanol and deposition on a copper grid with a lacey carbon film (Gatan Inc.). Elemental mappings were recorded using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) with a Thermo Fisher Scientific EDX detector (UltraDry).
The electrode conductivity σ was analyzed by 4-point probe measurements (custom built, tip diameter: 1.5 mm, tip distance: 1.75 mm). Areal resistance measurements were conducted 6 times per electrode and the conductivity was normalized to the electrode thickness and calculated viaeqn (1): (1)where I is the current, U the voltage, and d the electrode thickness (100 μm).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the electrode samples using a TG 209 F1 Libra system (Netzsch). The samples were heated in alumina crucibles from room temperature to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a synthetic air atmosphere (80% N2 and 20% O2). Higher temperatures are to be avoided to stay below the melting point of vanadium pentoxide. The burn-off mass was used to calculate the metal oxide and carbon content of the sample.
Nitrogen gas sorption measurements were carried out with an Autosorb iQ system (Quantachrome) at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) after degassing at 102 Pa and 150 °C for 10 h. For the measurements, the relative pressure (p/p0) was varied from 5 × 10−7 to 1.0 in 58 steps. The specific surface area (SSA) was calculated with the ASiQwin-software using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation in the linear relative pressure range of 0.1–0.25. Values for the total pore volume correspond to p/p0 = 0.95.
Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope that is equipped with an Nd:YAG laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and a power of about 0.05 mW (measured on the sample). Using a low laser power prohibited an oxidation of VO2 to V2O5 during measurements. A 50× objective and a grating with 2400 lines per mm were used to reach a spectral resolution of about 1.2 cm−1. Each spectrum was acquired with a measurement time of 30 s and 10 accumulations. Peak deconvolution of D- and G-bands was conducted using a baseline correction and assuming four Voigt profiles.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted employing a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS) with a copper X-ray source (CuKα, 40 kV, 40 mA), a Göbel mirror, a 0.5 mm point focus, and a two-dimensional VANTEC500 detector that covers about 25° 2θ. All samples were placed on a sapphire single crystal and measured in 3 steps at 20°, 40°, and 60° 2θ with a step duration of 33 min. Rietveld refinement was carried out using TOPAS Version 5 software (Bruker AXS).
2.3 Electrochemical characterization
The synthesized materials were characterized as working electrodes in a half-cell setup.63 Typical working electrodes exhibited a thickness of about 100 μm and a mass of 1.5–2.0 mg. A five-times oversized, PTFE-bound activated carbon (type YP-80F, Kuraray) was used as counter electrode, and activated carbon (type YP-50F, Kuraray) served as quasi-reference electrode.64 As current collectors, 12 mm diameter carbon-coated aluminum foils (Zflo 2653, Exopack Technologies) were employed and glass fiber mats (GF/A, Whatman) were used as separators. After assembly, the cells were first dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C and 20 mbar overnight, before being transferred to an argon filled glovebox (MBraun Labmaster 130, O2 and H2O < 1 ppm), where they were vacuum-backfilled with 1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile (ACN) electrolyte (battery grade, BASF). Then, full-cells were assembled with the synthesized materials as anodes, and 5 mass% PTFE-bound activated carbon (type YP-80F, Kuraray, electrode thickness ca. 100 μm) served as cathodes. Charge-balancing was achieved by adjusting the anode–cathode mass ratio to 1:2.
Electrochemical characterization was carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (VSP300, Bio-Logic). In a half-cell setup, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a potential window from +1.0 V to −1.0 V vs. carbon at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Galvanostatic charge/discharge with potential limitation (GCPL) was carried out by cycling between +1.0 V and −1.0 V vs. carbon with specific currents ranging from 0.05–100 A g−1 (equivalent to C-rates of 0.4–787C; 1C = 0.127 A g−1), normalized to the total electrode mass, excluding the mass of the PTFE-binder. The specific capacity Csp was calculated by integration of the reduction current I over the reduction time t accounting for the lithiation step from +1.0 V to −1.0 V vs. carbon, and normalizing to the total mass, m, of the working electrode, excluding the PTFE binder (eqn (2)): (2)
For investigation of full-cells, CVs were recorded up to a cell voltage of 2.3 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. GCPL measurements were carried out with specific currents ranging from 0.05 A g−1 to 50 A g−1 in a potential range between 0 V and 2.3 V cell voltage, with the specific currents being normalized to the mass of both electrodes, excluding the mass of the PTFE binder. The potential evolution at both the anode and cathode was measured by applying a spectator electrode, consisting of PTFE-bound activated carbon (type YP-50F, Kuraray). The specific energy Esp was calculated by integration of the voltage profile (eqn (3)): (3)where I is the applied current, U(t) the time-dependent cell voltage and m the total mass of anode and cathode without binder. The specific power Psp was calculated by dividing Esp by the charge/discharge time. The energy efficiency was derived from the ratio of specific discharge and charge energy. The stability of full-cells was tested via GCPL between 0 V and 2.3 V cell voltage at a specific current of 1 A g−1.

In situ dilatometry was carried out with an ECD-2-nano dilatometer (EL-CELL).65 The measurements were performed in a climate chamber (25.0 ± 0.5 °C) in a two-electrode setup with the VO2–OLC30–hybrid/VO2–OLC30–composite as the working electrode and an oversized PTFE-bound activated carbon as the counter and quasi-reference electrode (type YP-80F, Kuraray); the separator and electrolyte were equivalent to the procedure in half- and full-cells. Prior to the experiments, the cell was dried for 24 h at 120 °C under vacuum (20 mbar). The working electrode was compressed between a movable titanium plunger with a constant load of 1 N. The strain was tracked with a DP1S displacement transducer (Solartron Metrology, accuracy ± 15 nm). Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at 1 mV s−1 after a resting period of 48 h after electrolyte filling until equilibrium conditions were reached.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
The structure and morphology of the synthesized electrode materials were characterized by electron microscopy. As seen from SEM images in Fig. 1, hydrothermally synthesized vanadium oxide forms in different structures depending on the synthesis route. When carbon onions (OLC = onion-like carbon) are present in the autoclave during synthesis, a hybrid material is formed consisting of vanadia and carbon, with nanoscopic flower-like vanadia structures growing deeply interconnected within the OLC agglomerates that serve as nucleation sites (Fig. 1A–C). These samples are further labelled VO2–OLC–hybrid. The term hybrid is chosen to emphasize the chemical connection of the two components, vanadia and carbon, on a nanoscopic scale. The vanadia-to-carbon ratio in the hybrid electrode is controlled by stoichiometric addition of carbon onions to the synthesis container; for example, the VO2–OLC30–hybrid was produced by a precursor mass ratio of 6:3 vanadia to carbon onions. The remaining 10% of the final sample consists of PTFE-binder used during electrode production. In contrast, the hydrothermal process without OLCs yields arrays of nanoscopic, flower-like vanadia structures. They consist of several quasi-spherical nanoflowers that form connected structures of several micrometers in size (Fig. 1D). When admixing OLCs after the hydrothermal process to form a composite, vanadia and OLC agglomerates are spatially separated, with carbon being present around the vanadia structures, rather than interpenetrating them like seen for the hybrid material. These samples will further be described as VO2–OLC–composites, emphasizing the post synthesis addition of OLCs, with the number indicating the stoichiometric amount of added OLCs to the composite material; for example, in the VO2–OLC30–composite, vanadia nanoflowers were mixed with OLCs in a mass ratio of 6:3. In such composites, carbon onions are merely the mechanically admixed conductive additive, whereas the hybrid material shows highly intergrown carbon onion/vanadia domains with a nanotextured oxide/carbon interface formed by chemical bonds.66
 Fig. 1  Scanning electron micrographs of (A–C) VO2–OLC–hybrid samples, and (D) the VO2–OLC30–composite sample. 
Both VO2–OLC–hybrid and VO2–OLC–composite samples were further analyzed by TEM (Fig. S1†) and chemically mapped via EDX (Fig. 2). A clear visualization with a smooth interface between OLCs and VO2 is visible for the hybrid sample (Fig. S1A†), whereas VO2 particles in the composite sample are separated from the OLCs, preventing a clear depiction of the interface of the two components. While the distribution of vanadium and carbon was found to be homogenous throughout the whole particle in the hybrid sample by EDX mapping (Fig. 2A), highly concentrated regions of vanadium were found in a rather homogenous matrix of carbon in the composite sample (Fig. 2B), being representative of the vanadia nanoflower clusters, separated by OLCs in the composite material. This further underlines the drastically changed morphological character of the samples resulting from the introduction of carbon at different stages of the synthesis. The influence of carbon–vanadia distribution on the macroscopic electrical conductivity of the electrodes was analyzed by 4-point probe measurements (Table S1†). By comparing VO2–OLC30–hybrid and VO2–OLC30–composite samples, it is obvious that the homogenous distribution of elements from the hybridization leads to higher conductivity in the resulting electrode material because of more continuous electron pathways.
 Fig. 2  Transmission electron micrographs of VO2–OLC30–hybrid (A) and VO2–OLC30–composite (D) samples, including EDX elemental mappings of vanadium (B and E) and carbon (C and F). The more homogenous distribution of vanadium resulting from the hydrothermal synthesis route is demonstrated. 
The elemental composition of the electrode materials was quantified by TGA and validated by semi-quantitative EDX (Table 1 and ESI, Fig. S2†). The sample inhomogeneity of the VO2–OLC–composite yielded a high standard deviation of the EDX results. When deriving the vanadia content from TGA, it must be considered that during thermogravimetric measurements in synthetic air, VO2 is oxidized to V2O5, causing an increase in mass per vanadium atom from 83 g mol−1 to 91 g mol−1. Moreover, the initial mass loss to 94% of the VO2–OLC30–hybrid sample is caused by evaporation of adsorbed surface water.67 While the general trend of an increasing carbon content for samples with larger amounts of added OLCs is confirmed, the vanadia/carbon ratio as chosen by precursor masses is not reached. Instead, the VO2 contents of VO2–OLC20–hybrid, VO2–OLC30–hybrid, and VO2–OLC40–hybrid samples were determined as 57 mass%, 47 mass%, and 32 mass%, respectively, while VO2–OLC–composite samples contained 60 mass%, 48 mass%, and 45 mass% vanadia. The reasons for this behavior are (i) the partial dissolution of vanadia from the samples during wet electrode preparation in ethanol, as witnessed by yellow coloring of the solvent, and (ii) an incomplete reaction yield of vanadia during the synthesis of the hybrid materials. The TGA signal of pristine VO2 nanoflowers shows a mass loss of about 3.5% which can be associated with adsorbed water on the surfaces.67 The subsequent mass gain between 350 and 400 °C is a result of oxidation to V2O5 in the oxidizing air atmosphere.

The surface area and pore structure of the hybrid electrodes were assessed by nitrogen gas sorption analysis (GSA). The values of the specific surface area (BET-SSA) and pore volume are listed in ESI Table S2,† and nitrogen sorption isotherms are given in Fig. S3.† The type III isotherms describe the meso-/macro-porous interparticle/intercluster voids, whereas the H3 hysteresis describes the amount of incompletely filled macropores.68 The SSA of the hybrid samples varies between about 80 m2 g−1 and 160 m2 g−1, which increases with increasing amount of added carbon onions, while the as-synthesized vanadium oxide nanoflower structures exhibit around 38 m2 g−1 in the absence of carbon onions. The increased SSA for higher amounts of OLC is related to the low density of carbon in comparison to vanadia and the mesoporous interparticle voids between the spherical carbon onions (352 m2 g−1 for pristine OLCs).
Raman spectroscopy was carried out to characterize the crystalline structure of vanadia and carbon in the hybrid electrode materials (Fig. 3A and B). The signals below 1000 cm−1 are associated with vanadia, while the signals at 1345 cm−1 and 1595 cm−1 correspond to the D- and G-modes of carbon.69,70 The Raman peaks at 191, 221, 594, and 612 cm−1 seen for VO2–OLC–hybrid samples evidence the presence of the VO2 phase.30,71 The intensity of these peaks decreases with an increased amount of OLCs in the hybrid materials relative to the carbon signal. The same behavior is observed for the VO2–OLC–composite (Fig. 3B); yet, the relative intensity of the VO2 signals is much lower compared to the VO2–OLC–hybrid samples, and barely visible for the VO2–OLC40–composite. This can be explained by the randomly distributed vanadia clusters in these electrodes, which are surrounded by carbon onion agglomerates. Because of the relatively small probed volume and the surface sensitivity of the Raman measurements,72 the detected signals originate predominantly from the carbon species in the composite electrode materials. The Raman signal of pristine nanoflowers clearly aligns with VO2.30

An analysis of the D- and G-peaks of VO2–OLC30–hybrid (Fig. 3C) and VO2–OLC30–composite samples (Fig. 3D) allows for a detailed examination of the carbon structure. Even though the same carbon onion materials were used for hybrid and composite electrodes, quantitative peak deconvolution reveals a difference in the carbon structure for the hydrothermally synthesized hybrid sample (ESI, Table S3†). While the areal intensity ratio of the D- and G-mode of carbon (ID/IG) is 2.3 for the VO2–OLC30–composite, this value increases to 2.7 for the VO2–OLC30–hybrid sample. An increasing ID/IG ratio relates to increasing disorder of the graphitic structure, caused by the introduction of defects.70,73,74 This aligns with an increase of the FWHM of D- and G-peaks for the VO2–OLC30–hybrid (ESI, Table S3†).51 These observations can be explained by a change in the carbon structure during hydrothermal synthesis and confirm the strong interconnections of carbon and vanadia on the nanoscale. When vanadia flowers nucleate from the solution on the outer shells of the carbon onion nanoparticles, an ordering reduction of the graphitic sp2-hybridized rings is expected due to surface stresses induced by non-epitaxially bound vanadia. This observation is in line with findings for the growth of vanadia layers deposited by atomic layer deposition on carbon onions.36
The crystalline structure of vanadia in the hybrid electrodes was further analyzed by XRD (Fig. 4). For VO2–OLC–hybrid samples, vanadia was found in the monoclinic VO2 structure, with both C2/m and P21/c space groups verified per JCPDS 65-7960 and JCPDS 65-2358, respectively (Fig. 4A). In general, both structures are characterized by corner-sharing octahedra (ESI, Fig. S3†), with the distance between the shared oxygen atoms at the corners of the octahedra showing a fixed distance of 3.3 Å in the C2/m structure (ESI Fig. S4A†) and varying distances between 2.9 Å and 6.4 Å in the P21/c structure (ESI, Fig. S4B†). The peak at ca. 18° 2θ is attributed to the polymer binder in the electrode (PTFE; JCPDS 54-1595). The diffractograms of VO2–OLC–composite samples, as well as of pristine VO2 nanoflowers, exhibit the signals of the VO2P21/c space group, PTFE at 18° 2θ, and a broad shoulder around 26° 2θ that is indicative of nanocrystalline carbon. The absence of the C2/m space group signal for VO2–OLC–composite samples indicates a preferential growth of P21/c vanadia during hydrothermal synthesis, when no OLCs are present in the solution. Since OLCs caused no change in the pH value of the solution, the change in crystallization behavior can be explained by an increasing amount of available nucleation sites with the addition of OLCs during the synthesis. By adding carbon particles to the solution, the rate of heterogenous nucleation, that is, energetically favored nucleation on an existing surface, is increased. The significantly reduced nucleation energy of vanadia on OLC surfaces leads to a homogenous morphology of the VO2–OLC–hybrid samples. The intensity of the C2/m space group in VO2–OLC–hybrid samples grows relative to the P21/c intensity for an increasing amount of OLCs in the hybrid material, as further quantified by Rietveld refinement. The amount of C2/m VO2 space group is calculated to be 3% (VO2–OLC20–hybrid), 35% (VO2–OLC30–hybrid), and 77% (VO2–OLC40–hybrid; difference to 100% = P21/c VO2). The larger number of nucleation sites provided by carbon onions seemingly leads to favored growth kinetics for C2/m VO2 over P21/c VO2.

3.2 Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical performances of the hybrid and composite electrodes were characterized in half-cells using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 5A and B). The CVs of VO2–OLC–hybrid samples (Fig. 5A) exhibited two features that can be attributed to (1) the double-layer capacitance originating from the carbon onions in the hybrid material52,75 and (2) the faradaic charge storage mechanism of vanadium dioxide. Electrical double-layer capacitance is characterized by a rectangular CV pattern, as observed between ca. 0 V and +1.0 V vs. carbon.19 However, considering the specific surface area of VO2–OLC–hybrid samples between 81 m2 g−1 and 160 m2 g−1, the contribution of the double-layer capacitance of OLCs to the overall charge storage is very small, as compared to the faradaic charge storage contribution of VO2. The prominent redox peak pair observed at ca. −0.55 V vs. carbon in the cathodic scan and at −0.4 V vs. carbon in the anodic scan is caused by battery-like lithiation and delithiation of the VO2 structure, respectively.58 Differences in the size of the redox peaks can be noticed, especially for the VO2–OLC40–hybrid, and less pronounced for the VO2–OLC30–hybrid, when compared to the VO2–OLC20–hybrid sample that contains most vanadia and would be expected to exhibit the largest peak. The reason is that battery-like Li+ intercalation at this voltage is only expected for C2/m VO2.30,58 The reaction mechanism of lithium intercalation in the VO2 structure is described by:56 VO2 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixVO2(4)where x describes the molar fraction of intercalated lithium ions.

Specific capacities of (C) VO2–OLC–hybrid and (D) VO2–OLC–composite samples derived from the galvanostatic reduction step at varying rates between 0.05 A g−1 and 100 A g−1 (corresponding to C-rates of 0.4–787C), normalized to the combined mass of carbon and vanadia. Insets in (C) and (D) show the coulombic efficiency (ratio reduction/oxidation capacity) at varying rates. 
In contrast, VO2–OLC–hybrid samples containing more P21/c VO2 exhibit a rather pseudocapacitive feature up to around −1.0 V vs. carbon. That is, an increased specific current without showing distinctive lithiation and delithiation peaks.31 This Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance has been described in literature for nanostructured T-Nb2O5 and nanocrystalline V2O5 electrode materials,16,76,77 but presents, to the best of our knowledge, a new feature for P21/c VO2. It is defined as lithium intercalation causing faradaic charge transfer without causing crystallographic phase changes to the host material.78
The CVs of VO2–OLC–composite samples most noticeably do not exhibit redox peaks (Fig. 5B). Instead, in the potential region, where lithiation peaks emerged for VO2–OLC–hybrid samples, pseudocapacitive behavior is observed with a steadily rising specific current from around −0.15 V up to −1.0 V vs. carbon in the cathodic scan. Considering that VO2–OLC–composite samples only contain P21/c VO2, this behavior is in line with the observations made for VO2–OLC–hybrid samples, where redox peaks were associated with C2/m VO2.
We carried out a kinetic analysis to separate battery-like from pseudocapacitive (capacitor-like) contribution to the overall charge transfer.79,80 Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at varying scanning rates ν between 10 and 1000 mV s−1 (ESI, Fig. S5A–C†) and the reduction peak current i at a potential of −0.7 V vs. carbon is tracked.19 Logarithmic plotting of i as a function of ν in accordance with eqn (5):81 i = aνb(5)where a and b are variables, yields directly a slope of b (ESI, Fig. S5D†). Battery-like charge transfer, being diffusion limited, exhibits a current i proportional to  (i.e., b = 0.5), whereas ideal pseudocapacitive charge transfer is not limited by solid-state diffusion and behaves capacitor-like, that is, proportional to ν (i.e., b = 1).81,82 For VO2–OLC40–hybrid and VO2–OLC30–hybrid samples, b-values of 0.54 and 0.68 were calculated, confirming a mainly battery-like and a combined pseudocapacitive and battery-like charge transfer, respectively.19 The VO2–OLC30–composite sample, for comparison, exhibits a b-value of 0.77, confirming a predominantly pseudocapacitive charge transfer behavior for P21/c VO2.
A quantitative investigation of the performance metrics of the hybrid electrodes regarding specific capacity and rate handling was carried out by galvanostatic charge/discharge with potential limitation (GCPL) at different rates between 0.05 A g−1 and 100 A g−1 (Fig. 5C and D). All values were normalized to the mass of the electrode, including carbon and vanadia (but without the mass of the polymer binder). The specific capacity of VO2–OLC–hybrid samples at low rates was above 105 mA h g−1, with the highest capacity exhibited by the VO2–OLC30–hybrid with 127 mA h g−1 (270 mA h per g per mass of VO2). This sample also showed the highest capacity retention with 45 mA h g−1 (96 mA h per g per VO2) and 29 mA h g−1 (62 mA h per g per VO2) at ultrahigh rates of 50 A g−1 and 100 A g−1 (i.e., C-rates of 394C and 788C), respectively. This behavior can be explained as follows: it is indicated that (1) the composition of the VO2–OLC30–hybrid sample yields the most favorable balance between carbon and vanadia as the conductive matrix and high energy density material, respectively. Furthermore, (2) the amount of carbon onions in the VO2–OLC30–hybrid sample gave rise to an optimum vanadia composition regarding the ratio of P21/c and C2/m configurations that is a result of the number of available nucleation sites. We propose that this combination of battery-like and pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation synergistically benefits high capacity retention at ultrahigh rates.
The specific capacity of VO2–OLC–composite samples varies between 71 mA h g−1 and 92 mA h g−1 at low rates and steadily decreases for increased cycling rates. The highest initial capacity is observed for VO2–OLC20–composite, whereas VO2–OLC40–composite exhibits the highest retention at an ultrahigh rate of 100 A g−1, owing to the larger amount of carbon onions as the conductive additive.
The performance of the hybrid electrode was further investigated as a full-cell by employing this material as the anode in an asymmetric supercapacitor setup against an activated carbon cathode. By selecting the mass ratio of anode to cathode as 1:2, charge balancing was achieved to ensure a symmetric potential development between the two electrodes. CVs were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 up to a cell voltage of 2.3 V (Fig. 6A and B). For the cells containing VO2–OLC–hybrid anodes, a broad lithium intercalation peak is observed between about 0.7 V and 1.7 V cell voltage (Fig. 6A). As already seen for the half-cell measurements, this peak is larger for samples containing higher amounts of carbon onions, that is, a higher amount of C2/m VO2. The cell employing VO2–OLC30–hybrid as the anode exhibits the highest capacity, showing a large intercalation peak in combination with a constant, high specific current above 1.5 V cell voltage, being characteristic of pseudocapacitive charge storage. On the other hand, the cells containing VO2–OLC–composite anodes only show pseudocapacitive charge storage, and no intercalation peaks emerge during cycling (Fig. 6B), in agreement with the half-cell data.

Ragone-plots of samples employing anodes of (C) VO2–OLC–hybrid and (D) VO2–OLC–composite samples, derived from galvanostatic cycling at different rates, with the straight lines corresponding to the charging cycle and the dashed lines to the discharging cycle. (E) Voltage-profile of a galvanostatic cycle of full-cells employing VO2–OLC30–hybrid (top) and VO2–OLC30–composite (bottom) anodes, including the potential development at the cathode and anode, monitored against a carbon reference electrode. (F) Electrochemical cycling stability over 5000 cycles, measured at a specific current of 1 A g−1 for full-cells employing VO2–OLC30–hybrid and VO2–OLC30–composite anodes. 
The specific energy and power of the cells were derived from GCPL at different rates, and plotted in a Ragone chart (Fig. 6C and D); a typical galvanostatic cycle of cells containing VO2–OLC30–hybrid and VO2–OLC30–composite anodes at a rate of 0.05 A g−1 is given in Fig. 6E. At a low rate, VO2–OLC–hybrid cells exhibit specific energies between 39 W h kg−1 and 45 W h kg−1 during charging, with the highest energy observed for the VO2–OLC30–hybrid (Fig. 6C). When increasing the rate, the cell containing the VO2–OLC20–hybrid anode quickly drops in energy, retaining 6 W h kg−1 at a high power of 51 kW kg−1. In contrast, asymmetric cells containing VO2–OLC30–hybrid anodes are distinguished by an outstanding rate performance, with an increased energy retention of 11.3 W h kg−1 at a high power of 58 kW kg−1. This behavior demonstrates that the beneficial combination of battery-like and pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation mechanisms observed in half-cells can be translated to a device level application, yielding asymmetric supercapacitor cells with enhanced specific energy and ultrafast cycling ability. A comparison of these values with the current literature on asymmetric supercapacitors employing vanadia/carbon hybrid anodes is given in Table 2. While the maximum specific energy of the VO2–OLC30–hybrid cells is in alignment with most other reports, the maximum specific power of 58 kW kg−1 is unprecedentedly high for hybrid supercapacitors.

Cells with VO2–OLC–composite anodes exhibit specific energies between 28 W h kg−1 and 35 W h kg−1 in the charging step, with the VO2–OLC20–composite showing the highest energy at low rates, while the VO2–OLC40–composite showed the highest energy retention with 5.4 W h kg−1 at a high rate, yielding a maximum specific power of 55.5 kW kg−1 (Fig. 6D). The cell potential in the galvanostatic cycle, including the separate potential evolution at the anode and cathode, monitored against a carbon reference electrode, is illustrated in Fig. 6E. The formation of a plateau-like region during charging of the VO2–OLC30–hybrid anode is observed at around −0.6 V vs. carbon, corresponding to the intercalation peak in the half-cell. At more negative potentials, an almost linear potential increase evidences pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation. In contrast, the VO2–OLC30–composite anode only exhibits a pseudocapacitive region with linearly increasing potential above −0.5 V vs. carbon, resulting in a decreased specific energy.
The electrochemical cycling stability of the hybrid electrode materials was assessed by galvanostatic cycling of asymmetric supercapacitor full-cells at a rate of 1 A g−1. After 200 cycles, both VO2–OLC30–hybrid and VO2–OLC30–composite cells faded in capacity to about 90%. Further cycling revealed a highly stable capacity development of both cells over more than 5000 charge/discharge cycles, with retentions of 85% and 80% compared to the starting value for VO2–OLC30–hybrid and VO2–OLC30–composite, respectively. Capacity fading is a result of vanadia degradation that is caused by repetitive volumetric changes during long-term electrochemical cycling.36,83
The electrode strain of both hybrid and composite materials during cycling was further quantified by electrochemical in situ dilatometry (Fig. 7).84 It is revealed that VO2–OLC30–hybrid electrodes undergo a strain of about 1.5% when fully lithiated at −1.0 V vs. carbon (Fig. 7A), whereas VO2–OLC30–composite electrodes exhibit no significant strain build-up during cycling (Fig. 7B). Consequently, the battery-like lithium intercalation evidenced by a pair of redox peaks in the CV of VO2–OLC30–hybrid yields significant macroscopic volume changes of the electrode during negative polarization. However, the longevity of the electrode was not affected by strain formation, which can be explained by the nanoscopic size of vanadia particles in the hybrid material that significantly lowers intraparticle stresses, as compared to micrometer-sized particles. Additionally, in the highly intertwined network with carbon onions, the surrounding carbon particles prevent vanadia from disintegrating, as it was described in the literature, for example, in silicon/graphene anode materials.85 In contrast, pseudocapacitive lithium intercalation in VO2–OLC30–composite electrodes occurs almost without causing a strain to the electrode material, leading to highly stable cycling behavior.
 Fig. 7  Half-cell cyclic voltammograms recorded at 1 mV s−1 with potential window opening (black curves) and combined in situ electrical dilatometry (red curves) to track the electrode strain during intercalation reactions in (A) VO2–OLC30–hybrid and (B) VO2–OLC30–composite electrodes. 
4. Conclusions
Flower-like vanadium dioxide nanostructures were prepared by a facile and scalable hydrothermal synthesis. Employing a hydrothermal synthesis route and adding a defined amount of carbon onions during synthesis yield a highly interconnected hybrid material with a tunable ratio of the VO2 crystal structure. A larger amount of added carbon onions provides a higher number of available nucleation sites for vanadium oxide, inducing a kinetically favored VO2 growth as C2/m over P21/c. When employed as electrodes for lithium intercalation, the former configuration shows a battery-like mechanism with intercalation peaks, while the latter exhibits pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation with a linear charge–voltage profile. By tuning the ratio of both crystal structures, an optimum composition is found, where a combination of both intercalation mechanisms synergistically benefits the performance, showing high capacity retentions of 45 mA h g−1 (96 mA h per g per VO2) and 29 mA h g−1 (62 mA h per g per VO2) at ultrahigh rates of 50 A g−1 and 100 A g−1 (i.e., 394C and 788C), respectively. This behavior is transferred to a device level by using the hybrid material as the anode in an asymmetric supercapacitor setup. While exhibiting a maximum specific energy of 45 W h kg−1, an outstanding energy retention of 11.3 W h kg−1 at an ultrahigh power of 58 kW kg−1 was achieved and longevity over 5000 charge/discharge cycles was demonstrated. This novel approach of combining intercalation mechanisms is easily scalable and might be transferred to other electrode materials or ion systems beyond lithium, providing new opportunities in the design of asymmetric supercapacitor systems.
