    , Accepted 12th July 2015First published on 15th July 2015AbstractA novel and facile two-step strategy is successfully developed for the large-scale fabrication of hierarchical mesoporous CoFe2O4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) on flexible carbon fabric as integrated anodes for highly efficient and reversible lithium storage. The synthesis involves the co-deposition of uniform bimetallic (Co, Fe) carbonate hydroxide hydrate precursor NWAs on carbon fabric and subsequent thermal transformation to spinel CoFe2O4 without damaging the morphology. The as-prepared CoFe2O4 nanowires have unique mesoporous structures, which are constructed by many interconnected nanocrystals with sizes of about 15–20 nm. The typical size of the nanowires is in the range of 70–100 nm in width and up to several micrometers in length. Such a hybrid nanostructure electrode presented here not only simplifies electrode processing, but also promises fast electron transport/collection and ion diffusion, and withstands volume variation upon prolonged charge/discharge cycling. As a result, the binder-free CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1185.75 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, and a superior rate capability. More importantly, a reversible capacity as high as ∼950 mA h g−1 can be retained and there is no obvious decay after 150 cycles.
Introduction
The increasing power and energy demands of next-generation flexible, portable, light-weight and stretchable electronic devices have stimulated extensive efforts to develop comparable performance flexible energy storage and conversion systems as power sources, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors (SCs), solar cells, etc.1–3 Among the various energy storage devices, LIBs have been widely used as an attractive power source for popular mobile devices owing to their high energy density, long cycle life and environmental benignity.4,5 In order to further facilitate their portability, flexible LIBs have become state-of-the-art power sources in the field of flexible, light-weight, bendable and safely operating energy storage devices.6
Compared with conventional devices, flexible energy storage and conversion devices are not limited by bulky design and configuration limitations.7 Recently, a number of studies, initiatives and products have been reported and proposed to realize mechanical flexibility of batteries by making each component more flexible in order to make them more suitable for practical applications.6 Flexible electrode materials are core components for constructing flexible LIBs. To fabricate flexible electrodes, the new substrates must meet such requirements as good mechanical properties, flexibility, and environmental friendliness. To date, the conductive films and textiles formed from CNTs, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and conducting polymers have been widely fabricated and used as conducting substrates to load electroactive materials.8,9 However, the fabrication of films of CNTs and rGO with large areas is difficult and costly. Therefore, textile-based energy storage designs are mostly adopted by researchers, as they have advantages over polymer films and paper, since they are flexible, bendable, do not kink, and recover their shape.10–12 In particular, carbon fabric (CF) has been studied as an ideal conductive substrate for directly growing active material due to its unique properties including high electrical conductivity, low weight, superior mechanical flexibility and low cost, which can be used to fabricate different types of flexible SCs or LIBs.13–15
To further improve the energy density of LIBs, binary transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have been extensively investigated as promising cost-effective and scalable alternative anode materials for LIBs since they offer several advantages, including high specific/volumetric capacity, high stability and low cost.16–18 Among these candidates, spinel ferrite, in particular CoFe2O4, has drawn particular attention because of its much higher theoretical capacity (916 mA h g−1) than that of commercially used graphite (372 mA h g−1), as well as its non-toxicity and natural abundance.19–21 Nevertheless, CoFe2O4-based anodes also suffer from rapid decay of capacity due to the intrinsically drastic volume changes during the charge/discharge process, which is commonly observed in TMO-based electrodes.22–24 Strategies have been proposed to improve the lithium storage capability of TMO-based electrodes, one effective strategy relies on the establishment of arrayed and integrated 1D architectures with a robust adhesion onto conductive substrates for LIB anodes, which are all expected to promote electrochemical processes and maintain good structural integration.25,26 Compared to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) thin-film electrode, one dimensional (1D) nanostructure arrays on conductive substrates exhibit great advantages for use as electrodes for LIBs: (1) the establishment of arrayed and integrated 1D architectures with a robust adhesion to the substrate provides a much larger surface-to-volume ratio and a shortened Li-ion diffusion length of the 1D nanostructure arrays with respect to the bulk counterparts. (2) The interval space formed between neighboring nanostructures can enable easy diffusion of liquid electrolyte to the nanostructured surface, ultimately improving the cycling stability of the electrodes. (3) The additive and binder-free electrode can effectively improve the overall energy storage capacity through the individual nanostructure participating in electrochemical reactions.27–31 Therefore, it is envisioned that advances in LIB technology can be achieved by combining both integrated flexible electrode design and porous structure with low-dimensional building blocks in a complete electrode configuration.
Here, we present the rational design and fabrication of a novel and efficient nanoarchitecture, mesoporous CoFe2O4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) directly integrated onto the surface of flexible carbon fabric, which can be directly applied as a self-supported 3D anode for LIBs. The as-synthesized mesoporous CoFe2O4 nanowires consist of numerous highly crystalline nanoparticles, leaving a large number of mesopores to increase the electrode–electrolyte interfacial area and alleviate the volume change during the charge/discharge process. When evaluated as a binder-free anode material for LIBs, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite exhibits high reversible capacity, and a superior rate capability and cycling performance.
Experimental
Growth of CoFe2O4 NWAs on carbon fabric
All chemicals (supplied by Beijing Chemical Co., Ltd) used were analytical grade and used without further purification. CoFe2O4 NWAs/carbon fabric electrodes were synthesized by using a simple hydrothermal method followed by a thermal treatment. Prior to deposition, a piece of carbon fabric (CF; ca. 5 cm × 3.5 cm) was pretreated by rinsing with acetone, deionized water, and absolute ethanol for 15 min each. After drying at 60 °C for 5 h, the weight of each treated CF piece was recorded. In a typical process, 6 mmol of Fe(NO3)3, 3 mmol of Co(NO3)2, 16 mmol of NH4F, and 30 mmol of urea were dissolved in 90 mL deionized water to form a transparent pink solution by constant stirring, and then transferred into a 100 mL polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Two pieces of treated CF were immersed in the reaction solution and kept at 120 °C for 6 h to allow the hydrothermal growth of the CoFe-precursor NWAs. After that, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature naturally, and the CF covered with CoFe-precursor NWAs was removed from the growth solution, and rinsed several times with deionized water and absolute ethanol, followed by drying at 60 °C for 8 h. The precipitate in the solution was also collected and washed via centrifugation several times using deionized water and absolute ethanol before drying at 60 °C for 8 h. Finally, the samples were put in a quartz tube and calcined under the protection of ambient argon gas at 350 °C for 3 h at a rate of 2 °C min−1 to obtain well defined crystallized CoFe2O4 NWAs, and were then cooled down to room temperature gradually.
Characterization
The crystallographic structures of the materials were determined using a powder X-ray diffraction system (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2200PC) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The morphologies, chemical compositions, and the microstructures of the products were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7500F) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS UTLTRADLD equipped with a dual Mg Kα–Al Kα anode for photoexcitation). The N2 adsorption–desorption was determined via BET measurements using an ASAP-2010 surface area analyzer.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared products were measured using CR2025-type coin cells assembled in an argon-filled glove box. For the coin-cell assembly, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composites were punched into the form of 11 mm diameter disks, and then used directly as the working electrode without any conductive additive or polymer binder. The loading density of the active material on the electrodes was about 1–1.1 mg cm−2. A metallic lithium foil served as both the counter electrode and the reference electrode, a polypropylene (PP) microporous film (Celgard 2400) was used as the separator, and a solution of 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC = 1:1 v/v) was used as the electrolyte.
For the comparative study of the electrochemical performance, the CoFe2O4 powder was also formed into working electrodes. The pasted electrode was fabricated through coating an N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) slurry composed of 80 wt% active material (CoFe2O4 powder), 10 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and 10 wt% acetylene black on copper foil current collectors, followed by drying at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h.
The galvanostatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CT2001A LAND cell test system and a multichannel Arbin Instruments BT 2000 (USA) unit in the voltage range of 0.005–3.0 V at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz on a PARSTRAT 2273 electrochemical workstation under AC stimulus with a potential amplitude of 5 mV. Areal capacity values were calculated based on the area of the working electrode.
Results and discussion
The fabrication processes and the resulting novel electrode architectures developed in this work are schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. The fabrication included two key steps. In the first step, well defined CoFe-precursor NWAs can be easily grown on the highly flexible carbon fabric under hydrothermal conditions, in which the whole nucleation-growth process of the CoFe-precursor NWAs proceeds in the reaction solution. In the second step, the CoFe2O4 NWAs/carbon fabric composites can be obtained with well-retained morphology through thermal decomposition of the as-prepared CoFe-precursor NWAs/carbon fabric composites under the protection of ambient argon gas at 350 °C for 3 h.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of the CoFe2O4 NWAs/carbon fabric composites. 
The crystallographic structure of the as-prepared CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite was determined from the XRD pattern in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the carbon fabric, annealed products and the standard XRD pattern of cubic CFO. The XRD pattern of the carbon fabric displays an obvious graphite(002) reflection at 26.21°.32 With the exception of the reflections owing to the carbon fabric, all of the peaks in the XRD pattern of the CoFe2O4 NWAs/carbon fabric composite can be indexed to face-centered cubic spinel CoFe2O4 (space group: Fd3m, JCPDS card no. 22-1086).33,34 No other additional diffraction peaks from possible impurities are observed, indicating that the CoFe-precursors were converted to crystalline CoFe2O4 completely. In order to eliminate the influence of the carbon fabric, the collected powder from the same reaction system was also checked using XRD and the corresponding XRD pattern is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), where all of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to pure spinel CoFe2O4, further confirming the formation of the pure product. Also, the EDS spectrum (Fig. 1b) demonstrates the presence of the elements Fe, Co, C, and O in the as-prepared CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composites, consistent with the XRD results. The elemental composition and oxidation states of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite were further characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†) indicates the presence of the elements Co, Fe, O, and C, and the absence of other impurities. The Co 2p and Fe 2p XPS spectra were fitted by using a Gaussian fitting method (Fig. 1c and d). From the Co 2p core level spectra in Fig. 1c, it was found that four obvious peaks appeared. The first two characteristic peaks with binding energies of around 783.3 and 787.7 eV can be ascribed to Co 2p3/2 and its shake-up satellites, respectively. Meanwhile the other two peaks with higher binding energies of around 799.7 and 805.5 eV are attributed to Co 2p1/2 and its shake-up satellite, respectively. The presence of the satellite peaks at the higher binding energy of the major signals confirms the chemical state as Co2+.35–37 In addition, the XPS peaks of Fe 2p located at 711.4 and 724.7 eV should be assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 1d). The strong spin–orbit separation of ca. 13.3 eV between the two major signals is characteristic of Fe3+.21,38,39 The XPS results confirm that the valences of the elements Co and Fe are +2 and +3, respectively.

Fig. 2a shows digital photographs of the primitive carbon fabric, before and after the annealing treatment and coating with the active material. The obvious color change and the final uniform color of the carbon fabric indicate the uniform coating of the CoFe2O4 NWA samples. The as-fabricated device was lightweight and so highly flexible that it can even be twisted and folded without any detriment to the structural integrity (Fig. S3, ESI†). The morphology of the different products was examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The individual carbon fibers of the as-received carbon fabric have a smooth surface and a diameter of about 7 μm (Fig. S4, ESI†). Fig. 2b and c show the SEM images at different magnifications of the products after the hydrothermal reaction, where uniform hierarchical nanowire arrays of the CoFe-precursors were successfully grown on the entire carbon fabric. Fig. 2d and e show the SEM images of the products after calcination of the hydrothermally grown product under the protection of ambient argon gas at 350 °C for 3 h. An enlarged view (Fig. 2e) provides the evidence that the nanowire morphology and the array feature of the nanowires are perfectly retained after the annealing conversion. The diameter of the nanowires was reduced a little because of the calcination effects at high temperature. Typical nanowires are several micrometers in length and 70–100 nm in diameter. The presence of CoFe2O4 is further confirmed through elemental mapping of the composites, as shown in Fig. 3b–e. It can be seen that the elements cobalt, iron, oxygen, and carbon were distributed uniformly in the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composites. The porous nature of the as-prepared CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite was further characterized through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. From the nitrogen isothermal adsorption–desorption isotherm, a unimodal peak at around 4 nm can be seen in Fig. 3f for the pore size distribution, which further confirms the mesoporous structure of the CoFe2O4 nanowires. The formation of these mesopores could be related to the gas release during the decomposition of the Co–Fe precursor.

To better illustrate their unique architecture and porous nature, representative TEM images of the nanowires are given in Fig. 4. As shown in the low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 4a) of several CoFe2O4 nanowires, the needle-like CoFe2O4 nanowires with diameters of 70–100 nm and lengths of up to several micrometers can be clearly seen, which is in good agreement with the SEM observations. The higher-magnification TEM image depicted in Fig. 4b further reveals that a typical CoFe2O4 nanowire is actually a porous nanowire composed of many small nanoparticles of 15–20 nm in diameter instead of the conventional single-crystal nanowire. The mesoporous structure enables facile penetration of the electrolyte to the surfaces of the CoFe2O4, resulting in rapid charge transfer reactions due to the shortened ion diffusion paths. Fig. 4c shows the HRTEM image of a single porous CoFe2O4 nanowire. The clearly resolved lattice fringes show interplanar spacings of 0.25 nm, 0.29 nm and 0.48 nm, corresponding to the (311) (200) and (111) planes of spinel CoFe2O4, respectively.40 The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the CoFe2O4 nanowires (Fig. 4d) shows well-defined concentric diffraction rings from the centre which can be assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes of cubic spinel CoFe2O4, which is consistent with the XRD results.41–43

By virtue of the robust mechanical adhesion and good electrical contact enabled by the direct growth of metal oxide nanostructures on the current collector, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite was further tested as a LIB anode. The electrochemical experiments were conducted in a two-electrode configuration with the as-prepared CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite used directly as the working electrode without any insulating binder or conducting additive, and the results were compared with a CoFe2O4 electrode made using the traditional slurry-coating technique. Fig. 5a displays the initial five consecutive cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage window of 0.005–3.0 V. The first CV curve is obviously different from the subsequent cycles and the subsequent CV curves are almost overlapped from the second to the fifth cycle, presenting excellent reversible performances except for the irreversible reactivity in the first cycle. In the first cycle, there is an obvious irreversible reduction peak at around 0.5 V, which can be assigned to Li intercalation into the lattice followed by CoFe2O4 crystal structure destruction and formation of the respective nanosized metal particles (reduction of CoFe2O4 to metallic Fe and Co), as well as the decomposition of the organic electrolyte to form a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer at the electrode/electrolyte interphase.44 In the anodic process, the broad peaks between 1.6 and 2.0 V can be ascribed to the multistep oxidation of metallic Fe and Co to their oxide states, which showed no obvious shift in the subsequent cycles.18,45–47 Meanwhile, the peak at around 0.4 V is ascribed to the co-efficiency between the carbon fabric and the electrode material.48 Besides, similar CV curves are obtained from the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode (Fig. S5, see the ESI†), indicating that there is little influence of the substrates on the electrochemical characteristics. Thus, on the basis of the above CV analysis and the displacive redox mechanism of CoFe2O4 previously reported, the electrochemical reactions in the as prepared CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite can be expressed as follows:49,50 CoFe2O4 + 8Li+ + 8e− → Co + 2Fe + 4Li2O(1) Co + Li2O → CoO + 2Li+ + 2e−(2) 2Fe + 3Li2O → Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e−(3) Co + 2Fe + 4Li2O ↔ CoO + Fe2O3 + 8Li+ + 8e−(4)

During the subsequent cycles, the reduction peak moved to around 0.75 V and the oxidation peaks were almost unaltered. The slight shift of the reduction peak to a higher potential in the subsequent cycles might be related to some activation process caused by the Li+ insertion in the first cycle, indicating the slightly easier reduction in the subsequent cycles.51,52
The typical discharge–charge voltage profiles of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode for the first five cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 in the range of 0.005 to 3.0 V are shown in Fig. 5b. Notably, these typical voltage plateaus match well with the peaks observed in the CV curves. Significantly, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode delivers high first-cycle discharge and charge capacities of 1398.74 and 1116.83 mA h g−1 respectively, corresponding to a moderate irreversible loss of about 20.15%. In addition to the large specific mass capacity, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode also has a large corresponding areal discharge capacity of ∼1.78 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 0.25 mA cm−2. Such irreversible capacity loss during the first cycle can be commonly attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase film,53 which is a common drawback for nanostructured anodes and requires further efforts to be resolved. Besides, the carbon textiles exhibit quite a low capacity (Fig. S6, ESI†), indicating that the carbon fabric makes little contribution to the total specific capacity of the composite electrode.
As expected, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode manifests good cycling stability. The cycling performances of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode and the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode are illustrated in Fig. 5c and Fig. S7 (ESI†), respectively. From the second cycle onwards, the discharge capacity of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode shows very slow fading. The reversible lithium storage capacity gradually stabilises at ∼950 mA h g−1 (corresponding to an areal capacity of ∼1.21 mA h cm−2) after about 50 cycles. There is no obvious capacity decay after experiencing 150 cycles. Interestingly, a reversible discharge capacity as high as 954.3 mA h g−1 (areal capacity of ∼1.21 mA h cm−2) is retained after 150 cycles, corresponding to 87.1% of the second-cycle discharge capacity, which is still much higher than the theoretical capacity value based on the conversion reaction (4). Similar phenomena can be commonly observed in a variety of metal oxide-based anodes due to the reversible growth of the electro-chemically active polymeric gel-like film through the kinetically activated electrolyte degradation.54–57 For the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode, the excess capacity is associated with the reversible formation/dissolution of the polymeric surface layer, which in general contributes to the additional capacity.58–61 The polymeric surface layer, which is coated outside the inorganic SEI layer, is reported to show pseudocapacitive character and account for the origin of the low-voltage capacity.61 Besides, the Coulombic efficiency rapidly increases to and stabilizes at around 98% after a few cycles, again confirming the excellent electrochemical reversibility of the electrode. Under identical test conditions, the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode exhibits a much faster capacity fading, and a capacity of only around 540 mA h g−1 is left after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†).
The rate performances of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric integrated electrode and the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode were compared at various current densities ranging from 200 to 3200 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 5d. The CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity, followed however by a sharp capacity decay with the increase in current density. However, the discharge capacity of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode steadily decreases as the current density is gradual increased, with average values of 1269.9, 1108.4, 954.2, 800.7, 663.6 595.3 and 985.9 mA h g−1 obtained at current densities of 200, 400, 600, 800, 1600, 3200, and 200 mA g−1, respectively. The corresponding areal discharge capacities are 1.61, 1.41, 1.21, 1.02, 0.84, 0.76 and 1.25 mA h cm−2, respectively. This clearly reveals that when the applied current density increases, the discharge capacity of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode shows a gradual decrease, which is attributed to the increasing polarization of the electrodes at high current densities.62,63 Apparently, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric integrated electrode exhibits a much higher lithium-ion storage capacity and much better rate capability than the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode. For instance, even at a very high current density of 3200 mA g−1, the capacity of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode was higher than that of the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode. Importantly, a high capacity of 1018.94 mA h g−1 can be recovered when the current density is reduced back to 200 mA g−1, indicating the excellent stability of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode. The second charge–discharge voltage profiles of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode tested at different current densities are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). It can also be noticed that the electrode polarization increases and the reversible capacity decreases as the current density is increased. We also compared the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode presented in this work with other CoFe2O4-based electrodes reported in recent literature, and the results are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The lithium storage capacity and rate performance of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode are superior to most CoFe2O4 pasted electrodes. The significantly different electrochemical properties of the two types of electrodes are attributed to their different electrode architectures.
To the best of our knowledge, the mass and areal capacities displayed here are much higher than in many previous reports, such as a TiO2@Fe2O3 nanowire array (first discharge capacity is ∼800 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1),64 TiO2 nanotubes (first discharge capacity is 0.678 mA h cm−2 which decreases to 0.2 mA h cm−2 after 45 cycles at a current density of 0.025 mA cm−2),65 a TiO2@ZnO nanotube array (first discharge capacity is 0.427 mA h cm−2 which decreases to 0.17 mA h cm−2 after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2),66 and crystalline SnO2 nanowire/TiO2 nanotubes (0.14 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2).67 Typically, the current densities in our experiments are much higher, while the mass and areal capacities and cyclability of our CoFe2O4 nanowire arrays are much better.
The morphology of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode was analyzed after 100 cycles using SEM as shown in Fig. 6a. The self-supported nanowire morphology was well retained after the cycling test, which is due to the good structural stability of the mesoporous CoFe2O4 nanowires. This result indicates that the CoFe2O4 nanowires arrays have good adhesion to the carbon fabric substrate and such a 3D architecture is stable during the cycling test. Moreover, the nanowire became much thicker as shown in the inset of Fig. 6a.

(b) Nyquist plots of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric and CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrodes measured with an amplitude of 5 mV over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. 
The directly grown CoFe2O4/carbon fabric and CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrodes were also characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to evaluate their susceptibility to structural degradation. The results, presented as Nyquist plots (as shown in Fig. 6b), show the usual feature of a depressed semicircle in the high-medium frequency region and a sloping line in the low frequency region. It is obvious that the size of the semicircle for the CoFe2O4 powder pasted electrode is much bigger than that of the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric electrode, indicating that the conventional binder-enriched electrode has an increased additional undesirable interparticle resistance, which failed to provide efficient electron transport between the electroactive material and current collector substrate (Fig. 7). The enhanced electrochemical properties of the CoFe2O4 NWAs/carbon fabric integrated electrode could be attributed to the rationally designed nanostructure and the integrated smart architecture. Specifically, the abundant mesoporous structure in the nanowires and the large open spaces between neighboring nanowires provide a high electrode/electrolyte contact area and more “V-type” channels for high Li+ ion diffusion, and sufficient free mesopores to accommodate the strain induced by the volume change during continuous charge–discharge cycling, thus dramatically boosting the cyclability of LIBs. More importantly, the CoFe2O4 NWAs with direct adhesion to high electrical conductivity carbon fabric can facilitate electron transport between the charge collecting substrates of the carbon fabric and every CoFe2O4 nanowire, ultimately reducing internal resistance and enhancing the rate performance of LIBs. Together with the robust integrated architecture, high specific capacity, and remarkable cycling stability and rate capability, the CoFe2O4 NWAs/carbon fabric is able to manifest excellent reversible lithium storage properties.

Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous CoFe2O4 NWAs were successfully grown on carbon textile substrates with robust adhesion via a simple hydrothermal method process followed by a post-annealing treatment. Compared to the traditional nanostructure powder pasted electrodes, directly grown nanostructure array electrodes not only simplify the conventional tedious process of electrode preparation, but also offer remarkable advantages such as fast electron transport/collection and ion diffusion, sufficient electrochemical reaction of the individual nanostructures, enhanced material-electrolyte contact area and facile accommodation of the strains caused by lithium intercalation and de-intercalation. When evaluated as a binder-free anode material for LIBs, the CoFe2O4/carbon fabric composite demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1185.75 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1, retaining 954.3 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, and a high rate capability. More importantly, the electrode design concept proposed in the present work will provide new insights into the design and synthesis of other mesoporous transition metal oxide NWAs on flexible conductive substrates for the fabrication of high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
