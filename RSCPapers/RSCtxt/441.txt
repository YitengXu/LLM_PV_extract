    , Accepted 4th September 2019First published on 5th September 2019AbstractThin film tin oxide (SnO2) is a good electron transport layer (ETL) for perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with its excellent optical and electrical properties as well as facile accessibility. However, for high-performance PVSCs, the electron mobility of SnO2 should be further improved by optimizing its film quality. Herein, we report a poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)-doped SnO2 (P-SnO2) as an ETL for PVSCs with increased efficiencies and improved stability. The P-SnO2 film exhibits improved electron transport over the control SnO2. At the same time, the perovskite grown on P-SnO2 shows more uniform crystalline grains, higher electron mobility and lower defect density than the control sample grown on the pure SnO2. Moreover, P-SnO2 can efficiently extract electrons from the perovskite layer with its optimal conduction band. Therefore, the optimized device based on P-SnO2 shows an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% compared with the control PVSC based on SnO2, which exhibits a PCE of 18.05%. Furthermore, the P-SnO2-based devices show reduced hysteresis and better stability without any encapsulation. Our results provide a facile strategy to fabricate PVSCs with improved performance by incorporating a small amount of PVP into the SnO2 ETL.
1. Introduction
With their unique properties of intense and adjustable optical absorption, bipolar carrier transportation, excellent carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime, perovskite materials have been used in diversiform applications such as light-emitting devices, photodetectors, photovoltaic devices, optically pumped lasers, etc.1–6 Among these applications, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), in particular, have received increasing attention as evidenced by the fact that the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVSCs has exceeded 23% within 10 years.7–10 Besides the top and bottom electrodes, PVSCs are made from three functional layers, i.e. electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite layer, and hole transport layer (HTL).11,12 Among the three functional layers, the perovskite layer plays a key role in determining the performance of PVSCs. Thus, various modifications of perovskite layers have been carried out to improve the performance of PVSCs.4,13,14 For example, Saliba et al. reported stable PVSCs with a best PCE of 21.1% by using cesium-containing triple cation perovskite.4 In addition to the perovskite layer, the ETL of the conventional planar-type PVSCs is also of vital importance for high-performance devices.15 Originating from the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2) coated on compact TiO2 was first used as the electron transport material for PVSCs.5 However, the electron-mobility of TiO2 is an order of magnitude less than those of the most commonly used hole transport materials, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene.16 At the same time, TiO2 usually needs a high-temperature annealing at 500 °C, which is a disadvantage for future mass production of PVSCs.17–19 Therefore, low-temperature-processed electron transport materials such as tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and magnesium oxide (MgO), are gradually explored for PVSCs considering their high electron mobilities and low-temperature processability.20–22
Among the many ETLs for PVSCs, SnO2 stands out as an excellent electron transport material with the following salient advantages: (i) wide bandgap, deep conduction band and high transparency, (ii) high electron mobility and few pinholes, and (iii) simple solution processability.22–26 So far, compact and pinhole-free SnO2 films have been successfully prepared by diverse methods, which include spin-coating, atomic layer deposition, slot-die printing, and so on.22,23,27,28 To avoid charge accumulation at the ETL/perovskite interface, researchers have developed several strategies to further increase the electron mobility of SnO2. For example, with its strong chelation function, ethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was successfully incorporated into SnO2 to tune the energy level and improve charge transport ability of SnO2 thereby leading to PVSCs with improved efficiency and negligible hysteresis.11 In addition, a water-soluble polymer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) has also been used to reduce the pinhole and agglomeration issues of the SnO2 film, leading to devices with improved performance.29
As a common water-soluble polymer, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) can adhere to a metal surface via bonding between lone pair electrons of nitrogen (or oxygen) in PVP and metal ions. At the same time, the long vinyl polymeric chain of the PVP backbone would cause a steric hinderance to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles. Thus, PVP was incorporated into ZnO ETLs for organic photovoltaics previously.30 However, the modification of SnO2 with PVP has never been reported for PVSCs, to the best of our knowledge. Here, we report on the use of PVP-doped SnO2 (P-SnO2) as an ETL for PVSCs with increased efficiency, reduced hysteresis and improved stability. The electron mobility of the SnO2 film increases with the incorporation of PVP. Furthermore, the mobility of the perovskite layer based on P-SnO2 is about two times larger than that based on pure SnO2 due to the distinctly decreased defect density of the former. It is also demonstrated that P-SnO2 can extract electrons more effectively with the increased conduction band difference between the perovskite and P-SnO2. Therefore, the best-performance device using P-SnO2 as ETL achieved a PCE of 19.42%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.06 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.81. In contrast, the optimal control device based on the pure SnO2 only showed a PCE of 18.05% with a Jsc of 20.89 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.10 V, and FF of 0.79. Furthermore, the P-SnO2-based device showed improved stability and reduced hysteresis in comparison with the control device based on SnO2.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Characterization of SnO2 films with PVP and without PVP
The optical and electrical properties of SnO2 films with and without PVP were investigated to understand the effects of the PVP incorporation. Fig. 1a shows the optical transmission spectra of the bare indium tin oxide (ITO), ITO covered with SnO2, and ITO covered with P-SnO2 (5 wt% PVP in SnO2). The thicknesses of both SnO2 films are about 30 nm. It is found that the transmittance values of ITO/SnO2 and ITO/P-SnO2 films in the wavelength range from 300 to 400 nm are higher than those of the bare ITO film. The electron mobilities of SnO2 and P-SnO2 (5 wt% PVP in SnO2) films were investigated by fabricating devices with a configuration of glass/Al/ETL/Al, and using the space-charge-limited current method. As shown in Fig. 1b, the mobilities of SnO2 and P-SnO2 are calculated to be 1.03 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.68 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Polymeric PVP can help to disperse the nanoparticles, resulting in large SnO2 nanoclusters with less domain boundaries and trap sites.31–33 Therefore, an increased electron mobility was observed for P-SnO2 in comparison with that of SnO2. This indicates that PVP incorporation into SnO2 is advantageous for improved electron transportation.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode was used to study the surface morphology of SnO2 and P-SnO2 (5 wt% PVP in SnO2) deposited on ITO glass (Fig. 1c and d). It was found that the root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of SnO2 and P-SnO2 are 1.23 and 2.36 nm, respectively. The increased roughness of P-SnO2 in comparison with SnO2 could be related to the exposure of SnO2 nanoclusters at the surface induced by the removal of PVP with the UV-ozone treatment.30 Although the incorporation of PVP leads to an increased RMS roughness in the thin film, the surface of both SnO2 films with and without PVP is smooth enough to form dense films similar to the SnO2 films reported by others.22,24 In the meantime, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of SnO2 and P-SnO2 deposited on ITO glass were recorded and the results are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), there is no distinct morphology difference between the two SnO2 films with and without PVP.
In order to confirm the presence of PVP, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the SnO2 and P-SnO2 films on ITO substrates was performed, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2a. The binding energy data of XPS were calibrated with the carbon 1s line (284.8 eV). As shown in Fig. 2a, both films show distinct peaks of Sn and O, which can be attributed to the presence of SnO2. However, the P-SnO2 film shows a new peak located at 399.6 eV, which is attributed to the presence of N 1s, indicating the successful incorporation of PVP into SnO2. Notably, the Sn 3d3/2 peak (494.83 eV) and the Sn 3d5/2 peak (486.43 eV) of the P-SnO2 film down-shift by 0.33 eV relatively to those of the pristine SnO2 film, suggesting a possible interaction between SnO2 and PVP (Fig. 2b). The N 1s peak of P-SnO2 slightly shifts compared with the pure PVP (399.9 eV),34 indicating the possible bonding between the lone pair electrons of nitrogen and the Sn metal in the P-SnO2 film.

To understand the change in the energy level of SnO2 with PVP incorporation, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 2c. The valence band maximum (VBM) can be calculated by the formula of VBM = 21.22 − (Ecutoff − Eonset) eV. The whole UPS curve is shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). The VBMs of SnO2 and P-SnO2 were calculated to be −7.51 and −7.61 eV, respectively. To obtain the bandgaps of the films based on SnO2 and P-SnO2, we recorded the UV-vis spectra of the SnO2 and P-SnO2 films deposited on glass substrates. As shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), SnO2 and P-SnO2 films exhibited almost identical absorption with the same long-wavelength absorption edge at ∼344 nm, implying the same optical bandgap (Eopt) of 3.60 eV. The conduction band of P-SnO2 was calculated to be −4.01 eV based on the VBM and Eopt, and it is deeper than that for SnO2 (−3.91 eV). The detailed energy level diagram is provided in Fig. 2d. P-SnO2 possesses a deeper conduction band compared with the perovskite, which is favorable for an improved electron extraction from the perovskite to the ITO electrode.
Top-view SEM images of the perovskite (Cs0.05MA0.11FA0.84Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3) deposited on SnO2 and P-SnO2 are shown in Fig. 3a and b. It can be found that the crystal grains of the perovskite on P-SnO2 are more uniform with less white PbI2 phase in comparison with those of the perovskite on SnO2. The result indicates that P-SnO2 can facilitate a uniform distribution of nucleation sites. We also conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and the XRD patterns of the perovskite films coated on the ITO/SnO2 and ITO/P-SnO2 substrates are shown in Fig. 3c. As shown in the figure, typical perovskite peaks at 14.2° were found for both films. However, a visible peak at 12.7° was observed for the perovskite deposited on the ITO/SnO2 film. The peak at 12.7° corresponds to cubic PbI2, and it has a negative impact on the performance of PVSCs. However, the peak at 12.7° is negligible for the perovskite on the ITO/P-SnO2 substrate, which is in agreement with the SEM results.

(f) Time-resolved PL spectra for the perovskite films deposited on SnO2 and P-SnO2 substrates. 
To specifically learn the trap density and the electron mobility of the devices using SnO2 and P-SnO2 as electron transport layers, we fabricated electron-only devices using the device configuration of ITO/ETLs/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. The trap densities and electron mobilities were estimated by a typical space charge-limited current (SCLC) model. Fig. 3d shows the dark current–voltage curves of the electron-only devices. In the curves, there are three distinct areas, namely the ohmic conduction region, trap-filling region and pure space-charge limited conduction region. The kink points between the ohmic conduction region and the trap-filling region are defined as the trap-filling limit voltages (VTFLs), which are 0.08 and 0.06 V for SnO2 and P-SnO2, respectively. It is found that the trap density for the P-SnO2-based perovskite is calculated to be 8.5 × 1014 cm−3, which is 25% less than that for the SnO2-based perovskite (1.13 × 1015 cm−3). The significantly decreased trap density implies that the incorporation of PVP into SnO2 is beneficial for an improved charge transportation. Electron mobilities of the electron-only devices based on SnO2 and P-SnO2 are calculated to be 7.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.93 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Specific procedures for the mobility calculation are given in the ESI.† The results demonstrate that the P-SnO2-based devices would exhibit better photovoltaic performance due to the improved charge transportation.
2.2 Photoluminescence of perovskites on various substrates
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskites on glass, SnO2 and P-SnO2 films were measured to evaluate the charge transfer ability between the perovskites and ETLs. As shown in Fig. 3e, it is found that the PL peak at 770 nm of the glass/perovskite film was effectively quenched with the incorporation of the SnO2 or P-SnO2 film. Compared to the control perovskite on SnO2, the perovskite on P-SnO2 exhibits a more quenched PL that is related to the more efficient electron transfer from perovskite to ETL induced by increased mobility and improved band-edge alignment of P-SnO2.35 All the PL lifetimes can be fitted using double exponential models, as shown in Fig. 3f. The detailed parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). It is known that the long-lived lifetime (τ1) can be corelated with the radiative recombination of carrier, and the short-lived lifetime (τ2) can be corelated with the quenching of carrier at the interface.36 The glass/perovskite sample shows the longest average lifetime of 346 ns. Correspondingly, the average lifetimes of glass/SnO2/perovskite and glass/P-SnO2/perovskite films are effectively reduced to 195 and 106 ns, respectively. Specifically, for the glass/P-SnO2/perovskite sample, both τ1 and τ2 values are more reduced in comparison with the glass/SnO2/perovskite sample, indicating decreased traps and more efficient charge transfer for the former.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
Traditional PVSCs with the device structure of ITO/ETLs/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated. The perovskite layer was based on a mix-cation Cs0.05MA0.11FA0.84Pb(I0.87Br0.13)3 precursor and prepared by using a one-step method.4 The thickness of the optimized perovskite film was ∼500 nm. We optimized the performance of P-SnO2-based devices by varying the weight ratio of PVP doped in SnO2. The best-performance device was achieved for the ETL with 5 wt% PVP incorporated in SnO2. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the P-SnO2-based devices with different PVP contents are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†). To confirm the positive effect of PVP doping on the photovoltaic performance of PVSCs, we compared the performance of the devices based on SnO2 and P-SnO2 (5 wt% PVP) with the same device structure. Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the best-performance PVSCs based on SnO2 and P-SnO2. The device parameters are summarized in Table 1. Under the reverse scan, the best-performance device based on P-SnO2 showed a PCE of 19.42% with a Voc of 1.13 V, a Jsc of 21.06 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.81, in comparison with a PCE of 18.05% with a Jsc of 20.89 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.10 V, and a FF of 0.79 for the best-performance PVSC with SnO2. Both the reverse and forward scans of the PVSCs are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The results indicate that the hysteresis phenomenon for the device based on P-SnO2 was reduced in comparison with that of the device based on pure SnO2, which may be related to the fewer traps at the interface between the perovskite and the PVP-doped SnO2.

For the devices based on P-SnO2, the significant improvements in the Voc and FF are associated with the enhanced conductivity of P-SnO2, improved electron-mobility of the perovskite, and the reduced charge recombination at the P-SnO2/perovskite interface with a faster electron transfer. Fig. 4b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the corresponding integrated Jsc curves for the best-performance PVSCs based on SnO2 and PVP-doped SnO2. The integrated Jsc values for the devices based on SnO2 and P-SnO2 are 20.80 and 22.04 mA cm−2, respectively, which match with the measured values within 5% error. Fig. 4c shows the PCE distributions of 50 devices based on SnO2 and P-SnO2 ETLs. The P-SnO2-based devices exhibit a narrow PCE distribution with a standard deviation of 0.39 indicating a good reproducibility. However, the PCEs of SnO2-based devices show inferior reproducibility with a larger standard deviation of 0.62 and a broader PCE variation between 15% and 19%. Therefore, P-SnO2 is a better ETL candidate in comparison with SnO2 from the viewpoint of mass production. The long-term stability of the unencapsulated PVSCs based on SnO2 and P-SnO2 was investigated under ambient conditions (30–80% RH). The average PCEs (10 devices) of PVSCs based on SnO2 and P-SnO2 as a function of storage time are shown in Fig. 4d. For the unsealed P-SnO2-based devices, 88% of its initial PCE can be retained after 50 days storage. In contrast, the PCE of the unsealed SnO2-based device dropped to 80% of its initial PCE after the same period of storage. It is clear that the device with PVP-doped SnO2 is more stable compared with the SnO2-based counterpart, which can be ascribed to the improved contact between the perovskite and the P-SnO2 ETL.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, PVP was incorporated into SnO2 to form an excellent ETL for perovskite solar cells with improved performance. The interaction between PVP and Sn ions would lead to a dense ETL with an increased electron mobility. Furthermore, the PVP incorporation leads to a perovskite layer with a more uniform domain size, increased electron transportation and reduced defects. Thus, the best-performance PVSC based on P-SnO2 exhibited an improved PCE of 19.42% in comparison with the control PVSC based on SnO2 that showed a lower PCE of 18.05%. Without any encapsulation, the P-SnO2-based devices exhibited reduced hysteresis and better shelf-stability compared to the SnO2-based counterpart. In combination with the improved reproducibility of P-SnO2-based devices, PVP-doped SnO2 is a promising electron transport material for high-performance and stable PVSCs.
