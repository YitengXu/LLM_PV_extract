    , Accepted 29th March 2019First published on 1st April 2019AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have a major drawback of instability for long-term operation. Recently, all-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites have emerged as thermally stable and efficient photovoltaic light absorbers. However, research on the fundamental crystallization behavior of these materials is still far from adequate. In this work, the surface morphology, crystal structure, chemical states and defect/trap conditions of CsPbI2Br film with increasing annealing time have been systematically studied. We highlight a previously unnoted feature that adverse oxidation by traces of water (H2O)/oxygen (O2) in the normally considered nitrogen (N2) atmosphere takes place during the crystal formation process of CsPbI2Br perovskite. The oxidation leads to an evident increase in the defect density in the CsPbI2Br film and remarkably deteriorated the performance of the corresponding PSC. We believe that this work provides good inspiration for the preparation of high-quality perovskite films and the fabrication of highly efficient inorganic PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been spotlighted as promising candidates for efficient photovoltaic materials.1–5 Their solar-to-electric power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been certified as over 23%.6 Currently, a weak long-term operational stability is the major obstacle restricting further development and practical industrialization of organic–inorganic halide PSCs,7 especially the compositional stability under long-term thermal stress, in view of the intrinsic volatility of the contained organic components like methylammonium (MA).8 Incorporating inorganic cations like caesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb) was reported to be effective in improving the thermal stability.9,10 Thus, it is expected that all-inorganic perovskite may be an alternative to hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite absorbers to achieve high thermal compositional stability.11
Recently, a series of well-functioning caesium lead halide PSCs were reported.12–21 Among them, the CsPbI2Br-based PSCs achieved satisfactory efficiency and excellent stability, which can be attributed to CsPbI2Br balancing the trade-off between the band gap (∼1.92 eV) and phase stabilization.17–25 Currently, CsPbI2Br-based PSCs have achieved PCEs up to 16%.26 Thus, it can be forecasted that all-inorganic perovskites are likely to grow to a level comparable to that of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites.
The crystal formation of perovskite is the most crucial factor in the fabrication of high-performance PSCs. Completely understanding the whole crystallization process and the influence of related factors, such as precursor formulation, and annealing conditions including atmosphere, temperature and time, is significant to achieve high-quality all-inorganic perovskite films and PSCs based on them. Park's group highlighted the importance of annealing temperature for the formation of the black polymorph of CsPbI2Br perovskite.27 In our previous work, solvent engineering was implemented to optimize the precursor to obtain CsPbI2Br films with sufficient light absorption.24 At the same time, it was found that flash annealing, where the as-spin coated films were annealed for just a few seconds (15 s in the previous work), was beneficial to get CsPbI2Br films with high quality.28 The flash annealing was also implemented to produce highly crystallized CsPbI2Br films with high density and morphological uniformity as noted by Gao et al.29 Despite being effective, why flash annealing works and the basic understanding of the material CsPbI2Br with different annealing times have been ignored, leaving much confusion in the crystal evolution. This is unfavourable for the further development of CsPbI2Br perovskite.
Therefore, in this work, a systematic study of the correlation between crystallization and annealing time has been conducted for solution-processed CsPbI2Br films. This study was aimed at addressing the crystallization behaviour of CsPbI2Br perovskites by investigating the surface morphology, crystal structure, chemical states and defect/trap condition of the CsPbI2Br films, as well as the photovoltaic parameters of the ultimately fabricated PSCs. This work highlights the adverse oxidation by traces of H2O/O2 in the normally considered N2 atmosphere during the crystal formation of CsPbI2Br perovskite as the annealing time increases; this greatly enhances the defects in the perovskite films and reduces the solar cell performance. We believe that this work provides crucial information for the preparation of highly efficient inorganic PSCs.
Results and discussion
Based on our previous work, CsPbI2Br perovskite films were prepared by one-step spin-coating deposition using the precursor solution with a mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO,28 which was stirred at 70 °C to get better solubility.24 An anti-solvent-extraction method has been used, as shown in Fig. 1(a). After quick drop-casting of diethyl ether, the perovskite film was annealed at 260 °C on a hot plate for different time periods, ranging from 15 s to 10 min. A series of characterizations were carried out on the as-prepared perovskite films. In Fig. 1(b), the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images are displayed in the order of increasing annealing time. As seen, a uniform, dense and pinhole-free surface has been achieved with a very short annealing time of 15 s. As the annealing time increases to 3 min, the surface morphology changes insignificantly; but when the annealing time increased to 10 min, evident agglomeration and uneven surface were observed. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the CsPbI2Br films annealed for different times have been shown (Fig. S1, ESI†). As seen, all samples present the wanted black-perovskite phase, since the diffraction peaks at about 14.6° and 29.5° are well consistent with the (100), and (200) planes of the reported α-CsPbI2Br crystal.30,31 Through the enlarged detail in Fig. 1(c), it can be found that both (100) and (200) peaks shift toward the small angles as the annealing time increases. This observation can be understood in terms of the changes in the content of Br and I. Furthermore, obvious peak-widening can be observed for the 10 min-annealed film, which may be related to the lattice strain caused by the formation of interstitial defects at the surface. We paid special attention to the potential phase transition during the thermal annealing. On zooming into the XRD of the 10 min annealed sample (Fig. S2, ESI†), the characteristic peaks of the yellow δ-phase were not observed. Thus, it seems that increasing the annealing time to 10 min would mainly induce more defects.

To examine the possible defects and elucidate the influence of annealing time on the chemical states of CsPbI2Br, we implemented X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. As seen in Fig. 2(a), the oxygen content is significantly increased as the annealing time increases from 15 s to 10 min. From the Pb 4f spectra in Fig. 2(b), there is a significant increase in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) as the annealing time increases, particularly for the sample annealed for 10 min. We separated two peaks from the Pb 4f spectra for the samples annealed for different times. Referring to the literature, these peaks positioned at ∼137.3 eV and ∼142.1 eV were assigned to the Pb–O band.32 As shown (Table S1, ESI†), the area percentage of the peak at ∼137.3 eV had an obvious increase from 1 min to 10 min, indicating increased content of the Pb–O bands. Besides, the peaks of I 3d and Br 3d shifted to lower binding energy (Fig. 2(c) and (d)), which may be caused by the lattice expansion.33 Coupled with the XRD results (Fig. 1(b)), it can be speculated that some oxygen atoms in the environment get chemically absorbed at the surface (annealing less than 3 min) and further lead to the formation of interstitial oxygen defects (annealing for 10 min).32 The oxygen atoms in the N2 glove box may come from the “anhydrous” solvents, the oxygen-contained-DMSO vapours, or the contained trace of H2O/O2. Thus, it should be noted that the atmosphere in the N2 glove that is normally considered inert may not be so safe as the residual oxygen atoms bring about the trace oxidation reaction of the perovskite, especially when the perovskites are fabricated at a high temperature.

We can get useful information about the samples’ crystallization status from the steepness of the absorption edge. Thus, UV-vis spectra of the CsPbI2Br perovskites annealed for different times have been measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, the steepness of the absorption edge reduced as the annealing time increased, indicating that more trap-induced band tails may be formed during the annealing process. The Urbach energy was calculated to be 28.0 meV, 28.9 meV, 32.5 meV and 39.8 meV for CsPbI2Br annealed for 15 s, 1 min, 3 min, and 10 min, respectively. This demonstrates that, due to the prolonged annealing, more tails of localized states exist in the band gap, which may be originated from the oxygen-induced defects, as evidenced by the XPS study.

In order to quantitatively analyse the influence of the annealing time and the oxidation on the trap density of the CsPbI2Br film, the CsPbI2Br films annealed for different times were sandwiched between FTO and PCBM/Ag to fabricate devices for the evolution of the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) at different biases. From the current–voltage (I–V) curves in Fig. 3(b), two regions were evident in the experimental data: the ohmic region, i.e., the I–V curves were linear, and the trap-filled limit (TFL) region, where all the available trap states were filled by the injected carriers, showing a sharp rise in the I–V curve.34 The onset voltage is defined as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which is linearly proportional to the density of the trap states and can be calculated according to the following equation:35  where ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and the dielectric constant of the CsPbI2Br film, respectively, d is the thickness of the prepared CsPbI2Br film, and e is the elementary charge. The calculated trap densities Ntrap are 0.47 × 1016 cm−3, 1.17 × 1016 cm−3, 2.18 × 1016 cm−3 and 4.98 × 1016 cm−3 for the CsPbI2Br films annealed for 15 s, 1 min, 3 min and 10 min, respectively. The defect density is substantially increased with increasing annealing time, which can be attributed to the oxidation reaction during the annealing at an elevated temperature as high as 260 °C.
To further investigate the influence of annealing time on photogenerated charge carriers in the CsPbI2Br films, steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) studies have been conducted. The PL spectra (Fig. 3(c)) show apparent quenching in the red-luminescence intensity as the annealing time is being increased from 15 s to 10 min due to the higher rate of non-radiative recombination. Along with that, the gradual shift in the PL peak position (i.e., red-shift) with respect to annealing time indicates the increasing trap density of the film near the band-edge.36 The FWHMs of the PL peaks have been listed (Table S2, ESI†). As seen, the FWHM is first decreased and then increased as the annealing time increases. The first decrease from 15 s to 3 min indicates the growth of the perovskite crystals on annealing, in agreement with the results of SEM and UV-vis (the slight increase in the crystal size and light absorbance as the annealing time increases). For the 10 min-annealed film, the enlarged defect concentration has a more obvious influence than the crystal growth, leading to the finally increased FWHM of PL.
The PL decay-lifetimes are determined by time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements (Fig. 3(d)). All of the decay curves can be well fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. The estimated average lifetime was found to decrease from 15.7 ns for 15 s, 10.7 ns for 1 min, and 8.1 ns for 3 min to 3.5 ns for 10 min. Our results again gave an experimental indication of the progressive increment in the non-radiative recombination among the defect centres in the CsPbI2Br film. The CsPbI2Br films annealed for 15 s exhibited the longest lifetime, which is well compatible with the reported high-quality CsPbI2Br films.37 The decreased PL decay time is the result of defects in the CsPbI2Br film formed during the prolonged annealing time, which become the nonradiative recombination channels in the perovskite film.38 In summary, increasing the annealing time results in lower PL intensity and shorter PL lifetimes, indicating the recession of the perovskite quality and increased defect density, which is consistent with the quantitative analyses by SCLC measurement.
Taking all of the experimental evidence into account, a long annealing time increases the possibility of defect formation due to the trace of H2O/O2 in the N2 glove-box. The induced defect states are expected to decrease the device performance. As displayed in Fig. 4(a), PSCs with an inverted architecture (FTO/Li+-doped NixMg1−xO (NiMgLiO)/CsPbI2Br/PCBM/BCP/Ag) were prepared to check the efficiency with respect to annealing time. Fig. 4(b) portrays the SEM cross-sectional image of devices with CsPbI2Br film annealed for 15 s; as seen, a high-quality perovskite film has been fabricated, with a single CsPbI2Br crystal grain standing along the vertical direction without grain boundary interference.

Fig. 4(c) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with CsPbI2Br absorbers annealed for different times. As expected, the PSC with the annealing time of 15 s has achieved the highest PCE. The champion cell achieved a PCE of 11.05% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.94 mA cm−2. As the annealing time increases, the performance of the PSCs became worse. The incident light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra have been present in Fig. 4(d), and the integrated JSC values calculated from the IPCE curves are well consistent with the J–V curves. Here, the IPCE near 300 nm was caused by errors in the test. It is very difficult to exclude the external light completely during the IPCE test; and at the same time, the number of photons in the ultraviolet region is small, thus weak current error from the external light is revealed. However, this extremely weak external light does not affect the entire integrated current, just seeing the zero integrated current at about 300 nm.
The performance statistics of PSCs (JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE) with different annealing times are displayed in Fig. 4(e). As seen, all photovoltaic parameters attenuate, especially for VOC, which should contribute to the formation of defects during the annealing process mentioned above. The formation of defects leads to more recombination loss and reduced charge extraction efficiency, resulting in smaller values of VOC, FF and JSC.20 In this work, the VOC value is 1.08 V, still with a large difference of 0.84 V from the bandgap (1.92 V), indicating that there are still limits for the photoactive layer and the interface layers in the devices. Hence, further reductions in the defect density and development of band-matching interfacial charge transport materials should be the important research directions of all-inorganic PSCs.
Experimental
Film preparation and device fabrication
FTO-coated glass (TEC-15, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) was sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, alcohol, and acetone in an ultrasonication bath. After that, it was dried in flowing N2. A p-type NiMgLiO compact layer (∼20 nm thick) was deposited on the FTO glass by spray pyrolysis according to our previous work.5 After cooling, the glass was immediately placed in an N2-filled glovebox. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), PbI2 (99%, TCI), and PbBr2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) stoichiometrically in a mixed solvent of DMF (Sigma-Aldrich) and DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) with a volume ratio of 3:2. The precursor solution was stirred overnight at 70 °C. The perovskite films were deposited by an anti-solvent-extraction method: typically, 70 μL of the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated at a rotation speed of 4000 rpm for 45 s; after the first 3–5 s, a quick drop-casting of diethyl ether (100 μL) was done, and the perovskite film was then annealed at 260 °C on a hot plate for different times. Next, 70 μL of chlorobenzyl solution of PCBM was spin-coated at a rotation speed of 1500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 5 nm bathocuproine (BCP) and 90 nm Ag electrode were thermally evaporated under high vacuum (<5 × 10−4 Pa) to complete the device fabrication.
Characterization
The SEM images were obtained using a Nova Nano 450 scanning electron microscope (FEI Co., Netherlands). The XRD characterization was performed on an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical B.V. Co., The Netherlands). The UV-vis spectra were carried out using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Co., USA). The PL spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Co., UK). The time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were conducted at 650 nm on a Delta Flex Fluorescence Lifetime System (Horiba Scientific Co., Japan) with Delta Diodes as the excitation source, which generated short optical pulses with the width of 80 ps with a repetition rate of 100 MHz at the wavelength of 485 nm. The average power of the laser employed was about 3 mW. The XPS measurements were performed on an AXIS-ULTRA DLD-600W Ultra spectrometer (Kratos Co. Japan). IPCE was measured on a Newport IPCE system (Newport, USA). A solar simulator (Oriel, model 9119) with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was precisely calibrated with a standard Si photodiode detector before testing the devices. The active area of the solar cell was determined to be 0.09 cm2 by a black metal mask.
Conclusions
In this work, the influence of annealing time on the crystallization behaviour of the CsPbI2Br perovskites has been studied systematically using well-spectroscopic techniques. A series of characterizations such as SEM, XRD, XPS, UV-vis, and PL have been implemented. From SEM, the surface morphology of the CsPbI2Br film became uneven after annealing longer than 10 min; the results from XPS study demonstrated that Pb–O bonds are formed during the thermal annealing process. Thus, it should be emphasized that there exists adverse oxidation in the normally considered inert N2 atmosphere during the crystal formation of the CsPbI2Br perovskite implemented at high temperature. The oxidation leads to the formation of trap-induced band tails and an obvious increase in the defect density. The calculated trap density from the SCLC measurement increased from 0.47 × 1016 cm−3 to 4.98 × 1016 cm−3 as the annealing time increased from 15 s to 10 min. PL and TRPL demonstrate the increased nonradiative recombination and shortened carrier lifetime induced by the defect formation. As a result, the ultimately fabricated PSCs with perovskite annealed for just 15 s achieved the best photovoltaic performance. The present work envisages the importance of crystallization environment on the crystal quality of perovskite, and thus we believe that our results drive crucial information on how to prepare and realize highly efficient inorganic PSCs.
