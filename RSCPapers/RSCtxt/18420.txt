    , Accepted 18th December 2020First published on 26th December 2020AbstractHigh-quality large-area perovskite films are realized by an anti-solvent-free adduct approach using 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU) as a Lewis base additive. Perovskite crystallization kinetics was found to depend on the latent heat of vaporization, associated with vapor pressure, and donor number of the Lewis base under force convection in air-knife-assisted D-bar coating. The conventionally used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) Lewis base is inappropriate for high-quality perovskite films because of rapid co-evaporation with solvents by argon gas blowing generated under 1.5 MPa, while the DMPU-containing precursor solution induces the formation of a stable adduct intermediate in the as-deposited film due to the low vapor pressure and high donor number of DMPU. Upon addition of DMPU into the precursor solution, the concentration of DMPU is found to affect the morphology and photo-excited carrier lifetime of the resulting perovskite film. A piece of the (FAPbI3)0.95(CsPbBr3)0.05 perovskite film coated on a 4.8 × 9.6 cm2-substrate was used for testing the photovoltaic performance, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) significantly improved from 3.21% to 20.08% (best PCE is 20.56%) when 0.5 M DMPU (with respect to 1 M of perovskite) was added into the precursor solution. A monolithic perovskite solar module with an active area of 19.69 cm2, employing the perovskite film formed from the 0.5 M DMPU-containing solution, demonstrates a PCE of 17.94%.
1. Introduction
Since the reports on solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in 2012,1,2 perovskite photovoltaics have been recognized as a new research area because of the swift surge in research activities, as proved by enormous publications. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼10% demonstrated first in 2012 has been significantly improved to 25.5% in 2020,3 which indicates a rapid increase in PCE at an average annual growth rate (AAGR) as high as over 10%, much faster than the AAGR of 3.5% for the conventional Si and thin-film (CIGS, CdTe and GaAs) solar cells.4 Since a small-area PSC achieved a very high PCE over 25%, shifting from small-area devices to large-area modules seems to be well-timed for the industrialization of PSCs. Thus, the highest PCE of 17.9% was demonstrated from a perovskite solar module with 804 cm2.3
Spreading or spraying the perovskite precursor solution is a common way for large-area coating.5,6 To realize the large-area perovskite film, various coating methods were proposed, including blade or bar coating,7–10 slot-die coating,11–13 vapor deposition,14 spray coating,15–17 soft-cover deposition,18 screen printing,19 vacuum flash-assisted solution processes,20 and reactive polyiodide melt-assisted growth through in situ conversion.21 Unlike the spin-coating process, where the solvent is escaped via centrifugal force, the solvent can be evaporated by a sort of forced convection via air blowing using an air knife. Since the removal of the solvent from the wet film is kinetically slower at the forced convection than at the centrifugal force, the selection of the solvent for the precursor solution is of importance in obtaining a uniform large-area perovskite film. In addition, an anti-solvent like diethyl ether or toluene, used for the spin-coating process to form an intermediate adduct phase in order to control the kinetic growth of perovskite crystals,22–24 is difficult to be applied to large-area processes. Without undergoing an intermediate adduct phase formed by anti-solvent treatment, fast crystallization is inevitable in the large-area coating process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective methodology to control the growth of perovskite crystals without anti-solvent treatment in large-area perovskite coating.
In our previous reports, we have demonstrated a methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) film on a large-area substrate using a perovskite cluster-containing acetonitrile solution9 or a 2-methoxy ethanol-based solution25via air-knife-assisted D-bar coating. Although a uniform film was obtained, a low PCE of about 14% observed from perovskite solar modules25 was related to relatively low crystallinity due to fast crystallization in the absence of adduct intermediate formation. This indicates that an intermediate phase is still needed to prevent fast crystallization even under anti-solvent-free conditions. Then, it is questioned how to induce an intermediate phase without anti-solvent treatment. Since the intermediate phase is composed of a Lewis acid–base adduct, the kinetic control of crystal growth has been considered to be possible if a stable adduct is formed while the solvent is evaporated by air blowing. It is expected that a conventional Lewis base like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) tends to be co-evaporated together with the solvent during air blowing. The unstable adduct can thus lead to a non-uniform film with uncontrolled perovskite grains. We have reported previously that the replacement of DMSO with hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) resulted in a higher PCE due to a stronger adduct formed by HMPA,26 in which the PCE of about 17% was obtained from a 5 × 5 cm2 mini-module. However, the module efficiency seems to be lower than that of the small-area device. Since adduct stability depends on Lewis basicity (or Gutmann donor number),27 finding the optimal Lewis base is still challenging in the research field of large-area perovskite coating.
Herein, we report a perovskite solar mini-module with an efficiency of ∼18% and an area of 19.69 cm2 based on an FA-based perovskite film formed by D-bar coating of a perovskite precursor solution containing 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (DMPU) as the Lewis base. Polar aprotic Lewis bases such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) with similar molecular structures but different Gutmann donor numbers were compared with DMPU in terms of surface morphology, absorbance, X-ray diffraction and photovoltaic performance of the resulting perovskite films. The effect of the concentration of DMPU was also investigated to find the optimal quantity in the precursor solution. Among the Lewis bases studied in this work, a higher PCE along with reproducibility was consistently obtained from the DMPU-containing precursor solution.
2. Results and discussion
Air-knife-assisted D-bar coating was performed at a coating speed of 5 mm s−1 with argon blowing supported under 1.5 MPa at room temperature in an ambient atmosphere with a relative humidity of ∼30%, where the perovskite precursor solution was directly loaded on the D-bar. Fig. 1(a and b) compares schematically the as-deposited films formed from a DMPU-containing solution with the commonly used DMSO. We have found that the intermediate phase is quickly converted into a perovskite phase for the DMSO case, while a stable intermediate phase is observed for the DMPU case. DMF, NMP and DMI were also used in this work, which however leads to less stable intermediate phase than DMPU. The perovskite films after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min were found to be strongly affected by the type of Lewis base, where a relatively smooth and pinhole-free film was achieved from DMPU; however, non-uniform films were obtained from DMSO, NMP and DMI (Fig. 1(c–f)). The main difference in the resulting film quality is probably related to the stability of the intermediate phase.

DMSO or DMPU played a role of Lewis base and DMF was used as the solvent. DMSO was evaporated by Ar blowing, but DMPU stayed in the film due to stronger adduct formation. Arrows presented under the substrate indicate the sliding direction of the substrate.

Coating area of perovskite films was 4.8 × 9.6 cm2. White dots in SEM images represent the uncovered SnO2/FTO substrate. 
To verify the interaction between the perovskite precursor and the Lewis base, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra are measured for the adduct between PbI2 and the Lewis base (Fig. 2). Molecular structures are also presented along with the FTIR spectra. The wavenumber of the CO stretching and SO stretching vibrations shifts from 1663 cm−1 (DMF), 1675 cm−1 (NMP), 1689 cm−1 (DMI), 1630 cm−1 (DMPU) and 1042 cm−1 (DMSO) to 1620 cm−1, 1619 cm−1, 1618 cm−1, 1618 cm−1 and 1019 cm−1, respectively, after forming an adduct with PbI2. The lowered wavenumber indicates that the bond strength of CO or SO becomes weakened due to the interaction of oxygen in the Lewis bases with Pb2+.22,23,27,28 The FTIR study confirms the formation of adducts of Lewis acidic PbI2 with Lewis bases. A similar shift of the CO band to a lower wavenumber from 1630 cm−1 to 1609 cm−1 was observed from the powder of the DMPU–perovskite precursor (Fig. S1†), which is indicative of a strong interaction between DMPU and the perovskite precursor owing to the underlying adduct formation. However, the degree of interaction in adducts is hard to be distinguished only from the FTIR data. To further verify the adduct formation in the as-deposited films before annealing, X-ray diffraction (XRD) study was performed.

Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns of the as-deposited films formed from the precursor solution with different Lewis base additives. The XRD data measured in the entire 2θ region are shown in Fig. S2.† The peak at ∼14° is indexed to the (100) plane for cubic α-phase FAPbI3,29 whereas the multiple peaks at 2θ lower than 10° are related to the adduct intermediate phase. When considering that the peak corresponding to PbI2 appears at 2θ ∼ 12.6°, the peaks below 10° can be related to the expansion of the interlayer of PbI2 as the result of insertion of large organic cations and Lewis bases into the layered PbI2.30–32 A strong peak at 2θ = 6.3° for DMF without any Lewis base additive corresponds to a d-spacing of 14.03 Å, which indicates that the interlayer of PbI2 with 7.02 Å is expanded by 7.01 Å. The extent of lattice expansion is well consistent with ca. 7.3 Å expanded by the intercalation of DMF into MXenes.33 Addition of DMSO or NMP to DMF hardly changes the XRD pattern of the DMF-only case, which underlines that DMSO or NMP may not be involved in the intercalation reaction or no new peaks might appear due to the evaporation of DMSO or NMP during D-bar coating under Ar blowing. However, DMI and DMPU exhibit new peaks at 2θ = 6.62° and 6.54°, respectively, with strong intensity, which is a distinct evidence of insertion by DMI and DMPU. The extent of lattice expansion is 6.33 Å for DMI and 6.50 Å for DMPU. A slightly larger lattice expansion for DMPU than for DMI is due to the difference in the six-membered and five-membered ring structures. To further understand the relation between the lattice expansion and the solvent molecular size, the molecular size was calculated based on the assumption of spherical shape using ρ = m/(V × A), where ρ, m, V and A are the density, molar weight, sphere volume and Avogadro's number, respectively.34,35 The spherical dimension of DMF, DMSO, NMP, DMI and DMPU were estimated to be 6.26 Å, 6.08 Å, 6.74 Å, 7.0 Å and 7.27 Å, respectively, which is well consistent with the previous reports.36,37 A larger lattice expansion for DMPU (6.50 Å) than for DMI (6.33 Å) can explain the correlation between the molecular size and the lattice expansion. However, for the DMF, DMSO and NMP cases, lattice expansions are larger than DMPU despite smaller size, which might be due to a difference in the molecular orientation and/or non-intercalated phase because of the presence of relatively strong host PbI2 peaks.
 Fig. 3  (a) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-deposited (without annealing) films formed from the perovskite precursor solution containing different Lewis bases of DMSO, NMP, DMI and DMPU. The concentration of Lewis base was 1.0 M. The XRD pattern of the film formed from the precursor solution without Lewis base was also measured as a reference. (b) Plot of the XRD peak intensities for PbI2 at 12.60° and perovskite at 14.04° of the as-deposited films depending on different Lewis bases. (c) Vapor pressure and Gutmann donor number as a function of polar aprotic solvents used as Lewis bases. The data were based on the literature.38,39 
Those peaks at different angles from the peak observed for DMF are indicative of the existence of DMI and DMPU on the as-deposited film. It is noted from the XRD pattern for DMPU that the PbI2 peak at 12.60° is not detected and the intensity of the perovskite peak at 14.04° is much lower than those of other Lewis bases (Fig. 3(b)). This suggests that DMPU is likely to be involved in the formation of adduct intermediates. The existence of the adduct intermediate even after Ar blowing is due to the physical property of DMPU with a lower vapor pressure and a higher Gutmann donor number,38,39 a quantitative measure of Lewis basicity, than those of the counterparts (Fig. 3(c)). In the forced convention under Ar blowing, high latent heat of vaporization is considered to be beneficial for the formation of a stable adduct intermediate. According to the Clapeyron equation, the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) is proportional to the temperature and the vapor pressure derivative with respect to the temperature.34 For instance, the vapor pressure of DMPU is 25.75 mbar (2775 Pa) at 401.58 K (128.43 °C), which is lower than that of NMP (103.29 mbar at 400.74 K). Based on the raw vapor pressure data, ΔHvap was estimated to be 57.98 kJ mol−1 at 400 K for DMPU, which is higher than ΔHvap = 49.40 kJ mol−1 at the same temperature for NMP.40 Thus, at a given room temperature during the D-bar coating, a higher ΔHvap value together with a higher donor number for DMPU can facilitate the formation of a stable adduct after Ar blowing.
The effect of the concentration ([DMPU]) on the morphology of the annealed film was investigated. It is noted that [DMPU] is defined with respect to 1 M of perovskite (see details in the Experimental section). As can be seen in the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images in Fig. 4(a–h), film coverage and uniformity are significantly enhanced as the DMPU concentration increases from 0 M to 0.6 M. The rough surface of the control perovskite film without DMPU (0 M) can be fatter even after the addition of a relatively small amount of DMPU (0.3 M). At [DMPU] = 0.5 and 0.6 M, the surface and cross-sectional SEM images show the most desirable perovskite film quality. Film coverage and surface roughness tend to be worse when increasing further the DMPU concentration above 0.6 M. Since the perovskite film morphology is significantly affected by the DMPU concentration, photovoltaic performance is expected to depend strongly on the DMPU concentration. For the photovoltaic study, small-area PSCs were fabricated based on the perovskite film coated on the large area of a 4.8 × 9.6 cm2 (46.08 cm2)-sized substrate that was divided into 8 pieces with 2.4 × 2.4 cm2. As anticipated, photovoltaic parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) were altered by the DMPU concentration (Fig. 4(i–l)). In Table 1, average photovoltaic parameters are summarized. Jsc increased from 16.73 to 23.86 mA cm−2 with the increase in the DMPU concentration from 0 M to 0.6 M. Voc enhanced by more than 2 times from 0.489 V (0 M) to 1.089 V (0.5 M), and FF also significantly increased from 0.376 (0 M) to 0.774 (0.5 M). As a result, PCE increased by about 6.3 times from 3.21% (0 M) to 20.08% (0.5 M). Such a large enhancement in photovoltaic parameters correlates with the change in morphology with the DMPU concentration. Jsc, Voc and FF are declined upon further increase in the DMPU concentration from 0.7 M to 1.0 M, which results in a decrease in PCE to 17.53% (0.7 M), 12.22 (0.8 M) and 2.24% (1.0 M). For a large decrease in Jsc for [DMPU] = 1.0 M, which is even lower than that of the control sample (0 M), a significant reduction in absorbance is responsible for low Jsc (Fig. S3†). The incomplete coverage of FTO with perovskite in Fig. 4(h) also shows a negative effect on charge collection. The photovoltaic performance of 0.5 M DMPU was compared with those of DMSO, NMP and DMI of the same concentration. Photovoltaic performances of all other Lewis bases are not as good as that for DMPU at a given concentration of 0.5 M (Fig. S4†). Moreover, the reproducibility of device performance is very poor because of a large standard deviation, which is not beneficial for industrial upscaling.

Since we observed that photovoltaic performance was significantly influenced by the DMPU concentration and the best performance was obtained from 0.5 M, a further study on structural dependence on the DMPU concentration was performed before and after annealing the D-bar-coated films. Fig. 5(a) shows the XRD patterns depending on the DMPU concentration from 0 M to 1.0 M. Since there is difference in peak intensity between the intermediate phase at lower angles and the perovskite phase at 14.04° in the as-deposited films, it is interesting to compare quantitatively the ratio of the intermediate to the perovskite as a function of the DMPU concentration. The fraction of intermediate phase was estimated from eqn (1):41–43 (1)where Ax is the XRD peak area at diffraction angle x. XRD peaks at 6.54° and 7.08° are representative of the intermediate phase because the peak at 6.54° is strongly affected by the amount of DMPU and the peak at 7.08° first appears at low concentrations of DMPU (0.3 M). The peak at 14.04° corresponds to the perovskite phase, as mentioned previously. The inset in Fig. 5(a) shows that the fractions of intermediate phase calculated from eqn (1) are 4.5, 17.4, 43.1, 51.8, 67.8, 71.8, 93.1 and 96.3% for 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 1.0 M DMPU, respectively. The fraction of intermediate phase is increased with the DMPU concentration. In the inset of Fig. 5(a), the plot of the fraction of the intermediate phase versus the concentration of DMPU shows a nearly linear behavior. For instance, the fraction of 0.5 M DMPU-containing intermediate phase is ∼50% and that of 1.0 M DMPU-containing one is ∼100%, which indicates that equimolar DMPU is coordinated with the perovskite precursor in the intermediate phase. Too low fraction (4.5% for 0 M) or too high fraction (>93% for 0.8 and 1.0 M) is not appropriate to form high-quality perovskite films because low photovoltaic performances are observed at those concentrations. When considering that the relatively high photovoltaic performance is achieved from the DMPU concentration in the range of 0.5–0.6 M, the optimal fraction of the intermediate phase lies between 50% and 70%. This underlines that the coexistence of the intermediate phase and the perovskite phase with 50%:50% seems to be suitable for the production of high-quality perovskite films by the air-knife-assisted D-bar coating process at room temperature. The as-deposited film was converted into α-phase cubic perovskite after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, where the DMPU concentration of 0.5 M leads to the best crystallinity among the studied concentration (Fig. 5(b)). This confirms that the optimal proportion of the intermediate phase to the perovskite phase is 50%:50% in the as-deposited film.

The insets in (a) and (b) are the fractions of the intermediate phase and the (100) peak intensity of α-phase (FAPbI3)0.95(CsPbBr3)0.05, respectively. (c) Steady-state and (d) time-resolved photoluminescence of the annealed perovskite films on a bare glass substrate, depending on the DMPU concentration. (e) Light-intensity-dependent Voc for PSCs employing the annealed perovskite films formed from different DMPU concentrations. 
Since Voc and FF are significantly enhanced after the addition of DMPU, recombination of electrons and holes is expected to be altered. To understand the charge carrier recombination of the annealed perovskite layers before and after the addition of DMPU, steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured (Fig. 5(c and d)). As compared to the control film (without DMPU), the PL intensity slightly increased for 0.3 M DMPU, but 35 times enhanced after the addition of 0.5 M DMPU (Fig. 5(c)). For a higher concentration of 0.8 M, its PL intensity is not higher than the 0.5 M case but slightly higher than the 0.3 M condition. The PL intensity for the 1.0 M DMPU is even lower than that for the control film. The PL intensity is in the order of 0.5 M > 0.8 M > 0.3 M > 0 M > 1.0 M, which is well consistent with the tendency of Voc in the order of 1.089 V (0.5 M) > 0.947 V (0.8 M) > 0.935 V (0.3 M) > 0.489 V (0 M) > 0.404 V (1.0 M). The enhancement in the PL intensity is indicative of a suppression of non-radiative recombination, with the result that trap density is likely to be reduced. Thus, the addition of 0.5 M DMPU in the precursor solution can obviously reduce the trap density of the resulting perovskite film, leading to higher Voc. FF is similarly altered by the DMPU concentration, which is also consistent with the change in SSPL.
The carrier lifetime was determined by fitting the time-dependent PL decay curves (Fig. 5(d)) with the bi-exponential relation. The fit results are listed in Table S1†. From the amplitudes of A1 and A2 and time constants τ1 and τ2, where the subscript 1 and 2 denote fast and slow decay components, respectively, the average lifetime (τave) was estimated.44–46 The addition of 0.5 M DMPU increases τave by about 4 times from 0.99 μs to 3.92 μs, while a larger amount of 1.0 M DMPU rather decreases τave to 0.43 μs. The longer carrier lifetime results from less recombination, which can explain the improved Voc at 0.5 M and the dependence of Voc on the DMPU concentration. The change in SSPL and TRPL by the DMPU concentration is likely to be attributed to the morphological change (Fig. 4).
Finally, light-intensity-dependent Voc was investigated to understand the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination because the slope in Voc as a function of the logarithm scale light intensity is expected to be proportional to the SRH recombination.47,48Fig. 5(e) shows that the slope was estimated to be 1.62kBT/q for the 0.5 M DMPU that is much lower than 6.21kBT/q without DMPU (kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and q the electric charge). This indicates that the addition of 0.5 M DMPU significantly improves the perovskite film quality along with junction and interfaces,49 which is responsible for the high Voc and FF. The slope is reduced to 2.67kBT/q and 2.42kBT/q for 0.3 M and 0.8 M, respectively, which is also indicative of a better film quality and the improved Voc as compared to the precursor solution without DMPU. The light-intensity-dependent Voc was hard to measure for the 1.0 M DMPU because the device was unable to work at low light intensity.
The solar cell structure used in this work is a normal planar configuration as shown in Fig. 6(a). A conventional small-area device is composed of a piece of the D-bar-coated large-area perovskite film. The best PCE of 20.56% (active area is 0.125 cm2) was achieved based on the 0.5 M DMPU-containing solution (Jsc = 23.86 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.102 V and FF = 0.78), as shown in Fig. 6(b). The integrated Jsc value was calculated to be 22.99 mA cm−2 from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum, which is almost consistent with the measured Jsc value. The 0.5 M DMPU-based perovskite film shows less dependence of the J–V characteristic on the scan rate (Fig. S5 and Table S2†), which is due to the improved interface formed by high-quality perovskite films.50,51 The steady-state current density at a maximum power voltage (Jmax) and PCE were measured over 300 s (Fig. 6(c)). A steady-state PCE of 20.16% along with Jmax = 22.15 mA cm−2 was observed. For prolonged time scale over 4000 s, the PCE was slightly declined to 18.98% (Fig. S6†).

A perovskite solar module with an area of 5 × 5 cm2 (including the area of the etched lines) was fabricated based on the D-bar-coated perovskite film using the 0.5 M DMPU–containing solution. The monolithic structure is completed by laser etching. Fig. 6(d) shows the optical microscopic image of the etched P1, P2 and P3, where the etching process is undergone for the series interconnection between cells (Fig. S7†). A perovskite solar module comprising 10 sub-cells (see the real device image in the inset of Fig. 6(e)) exhibits a PCE of 17.94% (Jsc = 2.15 mA cm−2, Voc = 10.816 V and FF = 0.772) at reverse scan and 16.98% (Jsc = 2.15 mA cm−2, Voc = 10.686 V and FF = 0.740) at forward scan (Fig. 6(e)), resulting in an average PCE of 17.46%, obtained from the active area of 19.69 cm2.
3. Conclusion
We have found a precursor solution suitable for air-knife-assisted D-bar coating of large-area perovskite films. The formation a stable adduct intermediate under air-blowing-induced forced convention is important to control the crystal growth kinetics and, thus, make a uniform perovskite film with less trap states. To form the adduct intermediate, a Lewis base additive is required in the precursor solution, where the Lewis base with low vapor pressure and high donor number was found to be suitable for the formation of a stable adduct intermediate by the air-knife-assisted D-bar coating process. Among the studied Lewis bases of DMSO, NMP, DMI and DMPU, a desired film quality could be obtained using DMPU because of its lowest vapor pressure and highest donor number. A stable adduct, formed by using DMPU without anti-solvent treatment in the large-area bar coating method, resulted in a defect-less uniform FA-based perovskite film. A PCE of ∼18% was achieved from the perovskite solar mini module based on the 0.5 M DMPU-containing precursor solution. This work can provide important insights into the selection of Lewis bases and the design of precursor solutions for coating a large-area perovskite film.
4. Materials and methods
Synthesis of HC(NH2)2I
Formamidinium iodide FAI (FA = HC(NH2)2) was synthesized by dissolving 1.5 g formamidine acetate (99%, Alfa-Aesar) in 3.0 ml hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in H2O, Aldrich) for 3 h at the ice-bath temperature. A dark brown precipitate was obtained after evaporating the solvent using a rotary evaporator at 60 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was purified by washing it several times with diethyl ether. The obtained white powder was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Synthesis of the FAPbI3 yellow powder
A δ-phase FAPbI3 yellow powder was synthesized according to the method reported elsewhere.49 The synthesized FAI was dissolved in acetonitrile, which was followed by the slow addition of PbI2 and stirring for 48 h. The molar ratio of FAI:PbI2 was 1.3:1. The yellow participate was washed several times with acetonitrile and diethyl ether and then dried in a vacuum oven for 48 h.
Device fabrication
A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (Asahi, 7 Ω sq−1) was cleaned by sonication in acetone and ethanol for 20 min and then UV/ozone (UVO) treatment. A SnO2 layer was spin-coated on the cleaned FTO glass (coating area = 4.8 × 9.6 cm2) using a diluted (4 wt%) SnO2 colloidal solution (15% in H2O, Alfa-Aesar) at 4000 rpm for 20 s, which was annealed at 150 °C for 1 min and 185 °C for 30 min. Then, 1.43 M perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 859 mg of FAPbI3 powder, 15.2 mg of CsBr (99.9%, Aldrich), 26.2 mg of PbBr2 (99.999%, Aldrich) and 28.6 mg of MACl (MA = methylammonium, Aldrich) in DMF (99.8%, Aldrich). A polar aprotic solvent (DMSO, NMP, DMI or DMPU) was added as the Lewis base, where DMSO (>99.9%, anhydrous, Aldrich), NMP (>99.5%, anhydrous, Aldrich), DMI (>99.0%, Aldrich) and DMPU (98%, Aldrich) were used. The molar ratio of Lewis base to (FAPbI3)0.95(CsPbBr3)0.05 perovskites was varied, where 0.5 M DMPU means [DMPU]:[perovskite] = 0.5:1 (since the perovskite concentration was 1.43 M, DMPU was 0.715 M). The perovskite precursor solutions were filtered with a 0.2 μm pore size of the PTFE-H filter prior to use. The precursor solution was coated by air-knife-assisted D-bar coating (48 μl perovskite precursor solution was loaded onto the D-bar to cover the 4.8 × 9.6 cm2 sized substrate). The gap between the substrate and the D-bar was controlled to 70 μm using the polyimide tape, and the coating speed was 5 mm s−1. Ar blowing was supplied to the wet film using an air knife at a pressure of 1.5 MPa. The as-deposited film was heated at 150 °C for 10 min. A spiro-MeOTAD layer was spin-coated on the annealed perovskite film at 2500 rpm for 20 s using 150 μl of spiro-MeOTAD solution, where the spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 86.8 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 34 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 20 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (the Li-TFSI stock solution was prepared by dissolving 540 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) in 1 ml chlorobenzene. The Au electrode was thermally deposited onto the spiro-MeOTAD layer at an evaporation rate of 0.3 Å s−1. A monolithic perovskite solar module was fabricated by interconnecting 10 sub-cells in series, where P1, P2 and P3 etching lines were prepared using a laser etching system with a 1080 nm laser (μ-Lab, Germany). P1 etching was applied to FTO. P2 etching was applied to the SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD layer. Finally, P3 etching was applied after the deposition of Au.
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using Smartlab SE (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4° min−1. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were obtained using JSM-7600F (JEOL). J–V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a xenon lamp (Newport 6280NS, 450 W) under AM 1.5G 1 Sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). Light intensity was calibrated using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. Except for the large-area module, all devices were measured at 0.26 V s−1 scan rate with the size of 0.125 cm2 metal mask. The external quantum efficiency was measured using a specially designed EQE system (PV measurement Inc.) equipped with a 75 W xenon source lamp (USHIO, Japan). The absorbance was obtained using a UV-vis spectrometer (Lambda35, Perkinelmer) equipped with an integrating sphere. Steady-state (SS) and time-resolved (TR) photoluminescence (PL) were measured using Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12 (Hamamatsu). The perovskite films for the SSPL measurements were excited using a 464 nm laser source, and then the emitted PL from the samples was collected at 790 nm with 50 kHz repetition rate. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were recorded using a FluoTim 200 instrument (PicoQuant) with a 670 nm laser source. The emitted PL was detected using a photon multiplier tube (PMT) detector (PMA 182, PicoQuant-GmbH). The optical microscopic images were obtained using a Gl-99bi lab microscope for electronics (NB NanBei).

 	Fig. 5  DMPU concentration-dependent XRD patterns of the (a) non-annealed as-deposited films and (b) 150 °C-annealed films. The insets in (a) and (b) are the fractions of the intermediate phase and the (100) peak intensity of α-phase (FAPbI3)0.95(CsPbBr3)0.05, respectively. (c) Steady-state and (d) time-resolved photoluminescence of the annealed perovskite films on a bare glass substrate, depending on the DMPU concentration. (e) Light-intensity-dependent Voc for PSCs employing the annealed perovskite films formed from different DMPU concentrations.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Schematic of the device structure with a normal planar configuration, where a piece of the D-bar-coated large-area perovskite film (bottom panel) was used. (b) J–V curves and (c) steady-state PCE and current density at maximum power voltage for PSC (active area = 0.125 cm2) employing the (FAPbI3)0.95(CsPbBr3)0.05 film formed from the 0.5 M DMPU-containing solution. The scan rate was 0.26 V s−1. The inset in (b) is the EQE spectrum along with the calculated Jsc value. (d) Optical microscopic image of the P1, P2 and P3 etched lines for module fabrication. (e) J–V curve of the best performing perovskite solar module with the series connection of 10 sub-cells. The active area was 19.69 cm2. The perovskite solar module was measured under 1 Sun illumination without the aperture mask.
