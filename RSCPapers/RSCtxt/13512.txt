    , Accepted 28th April 2008First published on 6th June 2008AbstractSelf-trapping and singlet–singlet annihilation of the free excitons in a monomeric (β) perylene crystal were studied by using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy. The free exciton generated by the photo-excitation of the β-perylene crystal relaxed to the self-trapped exciton with a rate constant of 7 × 1010 s−1. The singlet–singlet annihilation of the free exciton observed under the high excitation density conditions was competed with the self-trapping of the free exciton; we estimated the annihilation rate constant for the free exciton to be 1 × 10−8 cm3 s−1 from the excitation density dependence of the free exciton decay. After self-trapping of the free exciton, no annihilation was observed in the 100 ps time range, suggesting that the diffusion coefficient was reduced drastically by self-trapping. The results show that the major factor limiting the exciton diffusion in the β-perylene crystal is a relaxation of the free exciton to the self-trapped exciton, and not the lifetime of the exciton. Though the singlet–singlet annihilation rate constants and fluorescence lifetime of the β-perylene crystal are similar to those of the anthracene crystal, the estimated exciton diffusion length (2 nm) in the β-perylene crystal is much smaller than that (100 nm) in the anthracene crystal as a result of the exciton self-trapping.
1. Introduction
Exciton diffusion is one of the key steps that control the efficiency of energy conversion in various organic photo-functional devices.1 In organic solar cells, for example, the diffusing exciton carries the absorbed photon energy to an electron donor–acceptor interface where the charge separation proceeds.2,3 In organic electroluminescence devices, exciton diffusion causes the annihilation and reduces luminous efficiency.4–6 The exciton diffusion length (L) is the distance covered by the diffusing exciton and is one of the most important parameters for developing organic photo-functional devices. The L value is generally characterized by the diffusion coefficient (D) and the lifetime of the exciton (τ): (1)The lifetime of the exciton is limited by several relaxation pathways. Information on the D value as well as on the relaxation pathways is therefore required to evaluate L in organic materials.
By using time-resolved optical detection methods such as transient absorption and fluorescence measurements, the exciton diffusion has been studied both in crystals doped with the guest molecules and in pure crystals.7 In the systems doped with guest molecules, the exciton generated in the host materials diffuses and is trapped by the guest molecules. Luminescence from the guest molecules is then observed following the photo-excitation of the host materials. From the time evolution of the luminescence from the guest molecules, the D and L values of the exciton in the host materials can be derived. In this method, a careful analysis that includes the host–guest interactions is essential.8
In pure crystals, exciton diffusions have been studied by observing exciton annihilation under the high excitation density conditions.9,10 The highly intense and stable light sources provided by recent laser technology have made it possible to perform optical measurements with high accuracy under high excitation density conditions. Observation of the annihilation process has become a common technique used to study exciton diffusion in organic crystals. To date, annihilations in organic crystals have been mainly studied by using nanosecond fluorescence measurements.7 In nanosecond fluorescence measurements, the singlet–singlet annihilation is completed within the excitation pulse duration and the diffusion dynamics for the singlet exciton averaged over the pulse duration are obtained. When fast relaxations in the picosecond or femtosecond time regions are involved, such nanosecond time-resolved measurements are insufficient to evaluate the exciton diffusion processes. There are, however, only a few reports on the annihilation and relaxation processes of the exciton studied with picosecond or femtosecond time resolution in organic crystals11–13 and exciton diffusion processes in organic crystals are not fully understood.

Perylene has a high absorption coefficient, fluorescence quantum yield and photostability, and has been regarded as model compound for photo-functional organic devices.14–16 Crystals of perylene have been known to show two phases under ambient conditions: a stable dimeric structure (α-phase) and a quasi-stable monomeric structure (β-phase),17 providing opportunities for researchers to examine the phase dependence of the organic crystal properties.
The phase dependences of the exciton properties in the perylene crystal have been investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, which have revealed that the energy level of the exciton is sensitive to the crystal structure: an orange fluorescence is emitted by the α-perylene crystals and a green fluorescence by the β-perylene crystal.17–21 To interpret such a phase dependence of the exciton properties, Matsui et al. have introduced the concept of the self-trapped exciton with a finding of two types of exciton in both perylene crystal phases by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy.19–21 According to their mechanism, a free (F) exciton is created first by the photo-excitation of the crystal. The F exciton is then stabilized by the self-induced crystal lattice distortion through the phonon–exciton coupling. The stabilized exciton is referred to as a self-trapped (ST) exciton and its optical properties depend on the crystal structure through the phonon–exciton coupling. In the α-perylene crystal, the self-trap depth for the ST excitons is deeper than that for the β-perylene crystal because of the stronger phonon–exciton coupling in the dimeric structure. The model successfully explains the crystal phase dependences of the color and lifetime of the fluorescence observed in the perylene crystals.
The annihilation constant (γSS) value for the perylene crystal has been also known to show phase dependence. The rate constants of γSS = 2.4 × 10−10 cm3 s−118 and γSS = 8 × 10−14 cm3 s−110 have been reported for the α-perylene crystal while the value of γSS = 1.2 × 10−8 cm3 s−118 was reported for the β-perylene crystal by using the nanosecond fluorescence spectroscopy. The reported γSS values for the perylene crystals were, however, obtained with the analysis where the self-trapping processes were not taken into account. Because of the variation of the phonon–exciton coupling, the D values for the ST excitons are expected to be different from those for the F excitons. To discuss the exciton diffusion processes in the perylene crystals, therefore, direct observations of the self-trapping dynamics are highly desirable.
In order to observe the self-trapping dynamics directly, we have previously performed a femtosecond transient absorption measurement focusing on the α-perylene crystal.13 By probing the charge-transfer band due to excimers (1500 nm), which correspond to the ST exciton states in the α-perylene crystal, a rise of ST excitons was easily observed. The rise profile was described by two components: an instantaneous rise component (<∼100 fs) and an exponential rise component with a time constant of 2 ps. From the observed fast formation of the ST exciton, it can be concluded that the annihilation constant reported for the α-perylene is associated with the annihilation process of the ST exciton.
On the other hand, the self-trapping dynamics for the β-phase have not been reported. This is because the growth of a large β-phase perylene crystal is not easy. The β-phase crystal has been recognized as an unstable phase under ambient condition and occasionally found as a minor product of the α-phase crystal formation. Although several attempts have been made to grow the β-phase crystal, difficulties in the preparation of the β-phase crystal remain.17–22 Recently we have reported a simple crystallization procedure to grow the β-phase perylene crystal.23 The β-phase crystals were recrystallized with a high selectivity by a rapid cooling of a saturated toluene solution. The lengths of the perylene single crystals were, however, within 100 μm, which is insufficient for the convenience of transient absorption measurements.
Our laboratory and other research groups have used transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with microscopy to observe the ultrafast dynamics of reaction intermediates in micrometer-scale specimens.24–32 In preliminary work, Masuhara and coworkers have reported ultrafast transient absorption and fluorescence microscopy, providing the spectrum and ultrafast dynamics of the exciton from a single microcrystal of perylene.26–29 Fujino et al. have performed femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion microscopy and reported on the position-dependent fluorescence dynamics in α-perylene microcrystals.31,32 Our laboratory developed femtosecond-laser scanning microscopes.24,25 Our system has a high sensitivity of up to 10−3, a high time resolution of hundreds of femtoseconds, a wide wavelength range (550–1500 nm) for detection, and micrometer spatial resolution.24,25
In this paper, we studied the self-trapping dynamics and singlet–singlet annihilation of the F exciton in a β-perylene crystal by using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy. The self-trapping of the F exciton that we observed competed with the diffusion of the F exciton and influenced the singlet–singlet annihilation. From the excitation density dependence of the F exciton decay, we determined the self-trapping rate constant (kST) to be 7 × 1010 s−1 and the γSS value for the F exciton to be 1 × 10−8 cm3 s−1. After the generation of the ST exciton, on the other hand, we did not observe annihilation in the picosecond time range. Those results indicate that exciton diffusion in the β-perylene crystal is strongly limited by the self-trapping dynamics of the F exciton. Such information cannot be obtained by optical measurements with nanosecond time resolution; we emphasize the importance of direct observation of the annihilation and relaxation processes with high time resolution in order to obtain detailed information on the exciton dynamics in organic materials.
2. Experimental
Details of the preparation of the β-perylene crystal have been previously reported.23 Briefly, a drop of a perylene-saturated toluene solution (350 K, 45 mM) was pipetted onto a room-temperature glass plate. The β-crystals were formed by rapid crystallization with a selectivity of about 70%. The crystal phases were identified by their fluorescent colors and shapes: α-perylene crystals are rectangular and β-perylenes are rhomboidal.17,22 The lengths of the crystals were typically on the order of 100 μm.
The optical setup used in the present study was based on laser-scanning transient absorption microscopy involving multi-photon excitation.24 The system was modified to observe the transient absorption with a one-photon excitation. The light source for the femtosecond pump–probe transient absorption measurements was a regenerative amplifier system consisting of a Ti:sapphire laser (800 nm center wavelength, 160 fs full width at half maximum (FWHM), ∼1 mJ per pulse intensity, and 1 kHz repetition; Hurricane, Spectra Physics).
Half of the fundamental output from the amplifier system was frequency doubled (400 nm) with a BBO (beta barium borate) crystal and used as an excitation light source. The remaining fundamental beam was carefully removed by a notch filter (NF01-808-U-25) and a cold filter (CLDF-50S, Sigma-Koki). The excitation energy was controlled by a variable reflective neutral density filer and was measured with a power meter (PM120, Thorlabs). The pump beam was modulated at 500 Hz by a mechanical chopper (3501, New Focus) to allow calculation of transient absorption from the intensities of the probe beams both in the absence of and in the presence of the pump beam.
The residual of the fundamental output was focused into a sapphire crystal to generate a white-light continuum for a probe pulse. The intensity of the probe beam was monitored to compensate for pulse fluctuation. The pump and probe beams with a 4 mm waist were introduced coaxially into the microscope and were focused by the first objective lens (reflective type, 20× magnification, 0.35 numerical aperture (NA)) placed under the sample (Fig. 1). The diameter of the pump pulse spot on the sample was estimated to be 10 μm by the knife-edge experiment. The probe beam transmitted through the sample was collected by a second objective lens placed above the sample. The resultant probe beam was detected by a silicon or InGaAs PIN photodiode after passage through a monochromator (SpectraPro-150, Acton Research). The pump beam was blocked by a color filter before the entry to the monochromator. A CCD camera was used to monitor the position of the crystals and the beams focused on the crystal. All measurements were performed at 295 K.

The transient absorption microscope mentioned earlier was equipped with a multi-channel spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB2000) to obtain the steady-state fluorescence and UV-Vis absorption spectra of the crystal. In the present study, the fluorescence and the UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured to characterize a perylene crystal (Fig. 1a, b, and c show schematic diagrams for the microscope setups in transient absorption mode, in UV-Vis absorption mode, and in fluorescence mode respectively). A Xe lamp was used as the light source for the UV-Vis absorption measurements. For the UV-Vis absorption measurements, a reference spectrum was taken without a crystal before measuring light intensity through a β-perylene crystal. Our system was designed to detect the fluorescence spectrum, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum and the transient absorption at the exactly the same sample position.
Fluorescence lifetime was measured by a time-correlated single-photon counting system (Fluorescence Lifetime System, IBH) equipped with a 408 nm pulse excitation laser (200 ps duration).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of a β-perylene crystal

Fig. 2 shows fluorescence and UV-Vis absorption spectra of a β-perylene crystal used for the transient absorption measurements (the large crystal surface is the ab plane and the incident light was perpendicular to that surface). The observed UV-Vis absorption was in quantitative agreement with the reported spectra for the β-perylene crystal at room temperature.17

The peak positions in the observed fluorescence spectrum were also in good agreement with the reported spectral peaks for the β-perylene crystal at room temperature.20 The small deviations of the peak positions can be explained by the effect of the fluorescence re-absorption by the crystal. On the other hand, the shape of the observed fluorescence spectrum was different from that reported by Matsui and Nishimura.20 Von Freydorf et al. reported the fluorescence spectra of β-perylene crystals grown from the zone-refined materials and from the non-zone-refined materials.18 Their results indicated that the impurities cause broadening of the fluorescence spectrum in the β-perylene crystals. The broader fluorescence spectrum observed in the present study implied that the crystal contains the impurities.
We have also measured the fluorescence lifetimes of the β-perylene crystals by time-correlated single-photon counting. The fluorescence lifetime was estimated to be 1.3 ns for the β-perylene crystals prepared by the recrystallization procedure. The estimated fluorescence lifetime was much shorter than that reported for the β-perylene crystal (13 ns).21 The fluorescence spectrum and the lifetime indicated that the β-perylene crystal used in the present study contained the impurities and the exciton produced in the crystal was quenched by impurities with a rate constant of ∼109 s−1. This rate constant was almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the exciton annihilation and the self-trapping dynamics observed. In the analysis, therefore, we assumed that the impurities did not affect the annihilation and self-trapping dynamics.
Using an atomic force microscope, we estimated the thickness of this crystal to be 3 μm. From the laser spot size and the thickness of the crystal, we estimated the sample volume excited by the laser pulse to be 2.4 × 10−10 cm3. The excitation of the crystal with a laser power of 1 nJ per pulse gave an initial excitation density of 5.7 × 1018 cm−3.
3.2 Reaction scheme
The generation and decay processes of the singlet exciton treated in the present study are described in the following scheme,  In this scheme, S0 denotes a molecule in the ground state. Upon photoexcitation, the lowest excited singlet states are primarily populated forming the F exciton (SF1). The ST exciton (SST1) is produced by self-trapping of the F exciton with a rate constant kST. In the β-perylene crystal, Matsui et al. reported the two types of the ST excitons; 1-center type (monomeric structure) and 2-center type (dimeric structure).21 The relative yield for each ST exciton depends on the temperature and the 1-center type exciton was predominately produced at room temperature.21 In the present study, all measurements were performed at room temperature. We therefore assumed that the nature of the ST exciton in the present study is the 1-center type ST exciton where the excited state is localized on a perylene molecule and surrounding molecules are reoriented to stabilize the excited state. The relaxation processes of the ST exciton are radiative and non-radiative decay to the S0 state, and the intersystem crossing (∼107 s−1)18 to the lowest triplet state (T1). Also, the ST exciton is quenched by the impurities (∼109 s−1) in the crystal. These processes are much slower than the self-trapping dynamics and assumed to be proceeded only from the ST exciton. In the analysis, these processes were treated collectively, with a relaxation constant of kSTr.
Under a high excitation density condition, the singlet–singlet annihilation of the F exciton occurs with a rate constant of γss and, subsequently, the S0 and highly excited singlet states (Sn) are generated. The Sn state relaxes to the SF1 state immediately through the internal conversion. The annihilation process is second order and reduces the number of the excitons by one half.
3.3 Self-trapping process
We observed the self-trapping process in the absence of the annihilation by measuring transient absorption using a low excitation density condition after the photoexcitation of a β-perylene crystal with an initial excitation density of 5.7 × 1018 cm−3 (Fig. 3a). The spectra at 5 ps and 50 ps are different, showing a spectral broadening with time and the 50 ps spectrum seems identical to the previously reported nanosecond absorption spectrum (Fig. 3b), which was assigned to the ST exciton.13 The time dependence of the transient absorption spectrum was also confirmed by the time profiles of the transient absorption signals (Fig. 4). At each wavelength, an increase of transient absorption resulting from the formation of the exciton was observed within the time resolution of our system. The decay component observed at 680 nm had nearly disappeared at 600 nm and at 750 nm.

We interpreted the change of the transient absorption spectrum that depends on the delay time in terms of exciton self-trapping. By photo-excitation of the β-perylene crystal, the F exciton, which has a transient absorption peak at 680 nm, is produced. The F exciton relaxes to the ST exciton, which has a broader transient absorption band. The broadening of the transient absorption band may be caused by the stabilization of the excitonic state by the self-trapping.
From the difference of the fluorescence spectrum between the F and ST exciton, one might expect a large change of the transient absorption spectrum by self-trapping. Previously we have investigated the effect of the aggregation on the excited-state electronic structure by using the perylene molecule.13 The self-trapping is caused by the molecular interactions in the excited state and affects the energy levels of the excited states while the energy level of the ground state is independent of the self-trapping. Therefore the fluorescence, which is an electronic transition between the ground and excited states, shows a large change due to the self-trapping. On the other hand, the transient absorption, which is an electronic transition between the excited states, does not necessarily show the large change because the energy levels of the initial and the final states for the transient absorption could be similarly affected by the self-trapping in the β-perylene crystal.
To obtain the kST value, we analyzed the time dependence of the transient absorption (A(t)680) at 680 nm wavelength as follows, A(t)680 = (ε680F[SF1] + ε680ST[SST1])d(2)where ε680F and ε680ST are the absorption coefficients of the F and ST excitons respectively and d is the sample thickness. From the observed transient absorbance at time zero, the excitation laser power, the sample volume for the excitation, and the ground state absorbance at 400 nm wavelength, the ε680F value was estimated to be 2 × 103 M−1 cm−1, which is one order smaller than the absorption coefficient of the perylene molecule reported in dilute solution.33 In the solid state, the absorption coefficients for aromatic molecules show anisotropy whereas the anisotropy is averaged in solution. The intermolecular interactions in the crystal also affect the electronic structures and transitions in the molecule. Such effects might cause the small absorption coefficient observed in the present study. By fitting the experimental data with a mono-exponential function, we determined the kST value to be 7 × 1010 s−1 and estimated the ε680ST value to be 60% of ε680F. The other relaxations were slow in comparison with the self-trapping dynamics,17,21 thus we neglect them in this section. We obtained a similar result with a lower initial exciton density of 2.8 × 1018 cm−3, ensuring the absence of the annihilation at these excitation densities.
3.4 Annihilation process
We examined the time profiles of the transient absorption signal at 680 nm wavelength at excitation densities higher than 5.7 × 1018 cm−3 (Fig. 5a, b and c). As the excitation density increased, the decay of the transient absorption signal accelerated, indicating that singlet–singlet annihilations were occurring. The liner relationship of the excitation density with absorbance, analyzed in accordance with the reaction scheme in section 3.1, shows that the generation of the exciton was a one-photon process (Fig. 5d). After the generation of the F exciton by the photo-excitation, the time evolution of the concentration of the F and of the ST excitons are represented by the following equations: (3) (4)In eqn (3), the first and second terms on the right-hand side represent the self-trapping and annihilation processes of the F exciton respectively. In eqn (4), the first term of the right-hand side is the generation term for the ST exciton by the self- trapping, and the second term represents the relaxation with a rate constant kSTr. We solved these differential equations numerically using the Runge–Kutta method, and calculated the time profiles of the transient absorption signals by eqn (2)–(4). The fitting parameters in this analysis were the annihilation rate constant of γSS and the relaxation rate constant of kSTr. For the kST values, we used the value determined in the previous section. The time dependences of the transient absorption signals were well reproduced by the simulations. From the simulations, we determined the values of kSTr and γSS to be 2 × 109 s−1 and 1 × 10−8 cm3 s−1 respectively. For the β-perylene, Von Freydorf et al. reported the γSS value to be 1.2 × 10−8 cm3 s−1 by nanosecond fluorescence measurements,18 which is in good agreement with the γSS obtained in the present study. Although self-trapping dynamics were not considered in their analysis, the first-order decay of the exciton was taken into account; that might compensate for the effect of self-trapping on the exciton dynamics in the β-perylene crystal. Nevertheless, our results revealed that the reported γSS value is associated with the F exciton. The lifetime of the ST exciton estimated from the kSTr value was in agreement with the fluorescence lifetime measured in the present study. The decay of the ST exciton is therefore attributable to quenching by impurity, and annihilation of the ST exciton was not recognized in the picosecond time region because of the small D value of the ST exciton. We have repeated the same experiments using the several β-perylene crystals and all the β-perylene crystals showed the similar exciton dynamics.

Solid lines show the fitting with a numerical analysis based on eqn (2)–(4). (d) Excitation density dependence of the transient absorption intensity at time zero. The solid line shows fitting with a linear function. 
3.5 Estimation of exciton diffusion length
The annihilation process of the exciton involves the exciton diffusion and the γSS value is correlated with the D values. In the simplest form, the annihilation rate constant (γ) is represented with the D as follows: γ = 8πDRa(5)where Ra is the annihilation radius. The use of eqn (5) needs the knowledge of the Ra value and the assumption that the annihilation process is diffusion-controlled. It is generally difficult to evaluate the precise Ra value and to confirm whether the annihilation process is diffusion-controlled or not. With eqn (5), however, one can describe a rough picture for the exciton diffusion from the annihilation rate constant. To understand the effect of the self-trapping on the exciton diffusion and to compare the present results with other organic crystals, we have roughly estimated the D and L values by using eqn (1) and (5). The lifetime of the F exciton in the β-perylene crystal was estimated to be 14 ps from the kST value determined in the present study. For other polyacene crystals, the reported γSS and τ values were used to estimate the D and L values with eqn (1) and (5). We used a value of Ra = 1 nm for all crystals in the calculation.
The exciton dynamics parameters obtained for the β-perylene crystal and for other polyacene crystals are summarized in Table 1. The γSS value obtained for the F exciton in the β-perylene crystal seems to be reasonable in comparison with the γSS values reported for the other polyacene crystals. However the F exciton in the β-perylene crystal can only diffuse about 2 nm because of the short lifetime limited by the self-trapping. That contrasts with the exciton diffusion reported in the anthracene crystal where self-trapping of the exciton is not present. The L value in the anthracene crystal can be estimated to be about 100 nm. Although the γSS values in the β-perylene and anthracene crystals are quite similar, exciton diffusion in β-perylene is strongly limited by the self-trapping process.

We have also estimated the upper limits of the γSS and D values for the ST exciton in the β-perylene crystal from the fact that the ST exciton annihilation did not proceed within 100 ps. The upper limits of the γSS, D and L values for the ST exciton are shown in Table 1. The upper limit of the L value for the ST exciton in the β-perylene crystal is smaller than the L value estimated in the α-perylene crystal. Such information cannot be obtained by optical measurements with a nanosecond time resolution. The present results indicate that the direct observations of the exciton relaxation and the annihilation are highly desirable to clarify the exciton diffusion process in the organic materials.
4. Conclusions
We studied the self-trapping and annihilation of the singlet F exciton in the β-perylene crystal by femtosecond transient absorption microscopy. The high sensitivity of our system permitted transient absorption measurements under a range of excitation density conditions. Under low density excitation, self-trapping of the F exciton was directly observed; under high excitation density, the singlet–singlet annihilation processes of the F exciton were observed. We found that exciton diffusion in β-perylene is strongly limited by self-trapping of the F exciton. We have shown that the present method of using femtosecond transient absorption microscope is well suited to reveal basic kinetic information on exciton in organic crystals. This information is currently interested for the development of new photo-functional devices.
