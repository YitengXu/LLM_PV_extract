    , Accepted 20th June 2017First published on 20th June 2017AbstractHigh mobility, stable and thick hole-transporting layer (HTL) materials are highly desirable for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two pH neutral conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs), namely PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T, based on 3,4-dithia-7H-cyclopenta[a]pentalene and thienyl units with a self-doping effect were designed and synthesized. Between the two CPEs, the PCPDT-T exhibits higher, more homogeneous mobility and appropriate work function, which makes it an ideal HTL material for OSCs. The single-junction OSCs modified with the PCPDT-T HTL showed an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 9.3%, which is much higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS-modified devices (8.0%). Notably, the PCPDT-T HTL exhibits excellent thickness insensitivity in fabricating OSC devices, i.e. OSC devices with very thick PCPDT-T interlayers over 50 nm still demonstrated high power conversion efficiencies over 7.1%, which is very compatible to meet the requirement for future roll-to-roll printing.
Introduction
Over the past decades, interfacial layer materials have played a critical role in promoting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). In OSCs, interfacial layers help to form an ohmic contact between the electrodes and the active layers, which is of great importance for charge transport and charge collection. With the rapid progress in interfacial materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has exceeded the landmark value of ∼13%.1–3 At present, developing new interfacial materials has become an effective way to improve the PCE of OSCs.4
There are mainly two kinds of interfacial materials which are commonly used in OSCs: electron-transporting layer (ETL) materials for electron extraction and hole-transporting layer (HTL) materials for hole extraction. Compared with the ETL materials, the development of HTL materials is lagging behind. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios VP. Al 4083) is the commonly used HTL material for hole extraction. This is because the solution processing of PEDOT:PSS has high optical transparency in the visible-NIR regime, suitable energy level, and sufficient conductivity. However, the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS tends to induce chemical instability between the active layer and the electrodes. In addition, the insulating PSS and the strong anisotropy in the electrical conduction in spin-coated PEDOT:PSS layers, often limit the charge transportation and collection in organic solar cells.5 Therefore, exploring new solution processing HTL materials with superior properties is of great importance in the field of OSCs.
In 2013, Heeger first put forth the idea that conjugated polymers (CPEs) could be employed as the HTL.6,7 CPEs are composed of conjugated backbones and side-chains bearing ionic functional groups.8 Compared with the conventional PEDOT:PSS, CPEs have several unique advantages. For instance, the CPEs can make remarkable connections between the hydrophilic electrode and the hydrophobic active layer. The chemical structures of CPEs can be easily modified through synthetic chemistry, offering great opportunities for tuning the chemical, optical and electrical properties of the materials. Furthermore, their good solubility in water and alcohol, allowed the easy deposition of the materials on the electrode by low-temperature solution processes.
The first reported CPE as a HTL is the polymer CPE-K, a pH neutral material, which did not corrode the ITO electrode. The homogeneous conductivity of the CPE-K led to a small series resistance, consequently improving the device's fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc). Thus, the device performance of CPE-K incorporated solar cells showed a slight enhancement compared to the control device with the PEDOT:PSS HTL. However, the mobility of CPE-K is still lower than that of PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, CPE-K used as a HTL must be very thin (the best thickness is 8 nm), which caused great difficulty for device processing.9,10 Lee and co-workers also synthesized the pH neutral conjugated polymers p-PFP-HD and p-PFP-O by external oxidation.11 Both p-PFP-HD and p-PFP-O as HTLs afforded power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in the range of 9.0–9.4% in the 2 nm thickness. However, the p-PFP-HD and p-PFP-HD materials prepared by external oxidation is not stable.12 Recently, Hou and coworkers synthesized the conjugated polymer PCP-Na as the HTL, and the best PCE of 9.89% was also obtained with the 6 nm thickness of PCP-Na. Due to the low mobility of PCP-Na, the PCE of the device is very sensitive to the thickness of PCP-Na, and it decreases rapidly with the increase of the thickness of PCP-Na.13 Hou et al. also developed the p-type self-doped conjugated polymer PFS as the HTL material, and achieved a PCE of 9.76% in the 7 nm thickness of PFS with PBDT-TS1:PC71BM as the active layer.14 Therefore, further development of efficient HTL materials based on the CPE with high and homogeneous mobility and thickness insensitivity remains a great challenge.
In this work, two novel pH neutral CPEs, namely PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T (see Scheme 1), based on 3,4-dithia-7H-cyclopenta[a]pentalene and thienyl units were designed and synthesized and their applications as HTLs were fully investigated. In these two CPEs, the thiophene unit with a strong electron-donating ability was introduced into the CPE backbone to improve the self-doping intensity and to ensure a higher mobility. As expected, both of the CPEs show a higher and homogeneous mobility than the PEDOT:PSS. Single-junction OSC devices were fabricated based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer using PCPDT-T as the HTL and a decent PCE of 9.3% was achieved, which is much higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS-modified device (8.0%). Notably, the PCPDT-T HTL exhibited excellent thickness insensitivity in fabricating OSC devices, i.e. the OSC devices with very thick PCPDT-T interlayers over 50 nm still demonstrated high PCE over 7.1%.

Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T are shown in Scheme 1, and their purifications were performed according to the procedure described by Heeger et al. in the previous report.9 The detailed synthetic methods and characterization of the compounds are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1–S5†). In the two CPEs, the alkyl sulfonic acid potassium salt groups not only endow the CPEs with good water/alcohol solubility but also ensure that the pH values of their aqueous solutions are near to neutrality (see Table 1), which enhances the stability of the devices during operation. Notably, the two polymers cannot be dissolved in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc., that are widely used for making the active layers in OSCs to avoid intermixing with the active layer during solution processing.

Self-doping behavior
The self-doping behaviors of PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As we all know, the PSS not only acts as a dispersant for PEDOT, but also dopes with the backbone of PEDOT via the SO3− group. The weak p-type doping can be detected by the obvious band from 600 to 900 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a. Similarly, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T also show a broad and strong peak from 580 to 900 nm, which could be ascribed to the self-doping effect of the polaronic states in the polymer films.

Then, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed to probe the polaronic states in the polymer films. As shown in Fig. 1b, a sharp and strong signal appeared in the ESR spectrum of the PCPDT-T film with a peak-to-peak width ΔHpp = 1.01 mT, confirming the existence of polaronic states. The g factor of PCPDT-T was calculated to be 1.9986, which was close to the free electron g factor (2.0023), indicating that the electron can be delocalized across the conjugated π-system. In particular, the polaronic states in the polymer films can be further stabilized by the anionic pendant, leading to a stable p-type self-doping effect in PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T. Correspondingly, a gentle and weak signal in the ESR spectrum of the PCPDT-2T film with a peak-to-peak width ΔHpp = 2.63 mT, confirms the existence of the polaronic states. The g factor of PCPDT-2T was calculated to be 2.0011. The weak ESR signal implied a relatively weaker p-type self-doping in the PCPDT-2T film than in the PCPDT-T film. In contrast, the PEDOT:PSS film shows the weakest signal in the ESR measurements, implying that PEDOT:PSS has a weak self-doping effect, which is consistent with the UV-vis observation.
Mobility behavior
It has been reported that self-doping on the backbone of conductive polymers can effectively improve the mobility.15–17 Therefore, we tested the mobility of PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method to simulate the charge transport in the OSCs, where the transport direction is vertical to the substrate. The detailed measurement methods are provided in the ESI† (measuring methods – mobility measurements). As shown in Fig. 1c, the mobilities of PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T were estimated to be 2.6 × 10−6, 9.1 × 10−6 and 6.2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (see Table 1). The mobility results are in agreement with the ESR results, and thus the improved mobility of the PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T originates from the strong p-type self-doping. The thickness of the CPEs as the HTLs is also expected to be greatly improved.
Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) was performed to study the local charge transport in the vertical direction in PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T HTLs. The current images of PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T thin films measured at +50 mV are comparatively shown in Fig. 2. The magnitude of the current in c-AFM indicates the local hole conductivity of the HTL. From Fig. 2, we find that the brighter, more conductive regions in the PEDOT:PSS HTL are surrounded by darker, lower current regions, indicative of the individual conductive PEDOT and insulating PSS domains, respectively. Instead, in PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T, a much more homogeneous current map is observed, especially for PCPDT-T, demonstrating an isotropic electrical conduction. The higher and more uniform and denser conduction network in PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T could help to improve the hole extraction and the transportation in the OSCs. In addition, the small root mean square (rms) roughness of the CPEs can enable a more uniform interfacial contact between the HTL and the active layers, which benefits the increase of the hole collection efficiency.

The root mean square roughness is abbreviated as rms. 
Hole extraction ability
To explore the difference in the hole extraction ability of HTLs, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement was carried out to investigate the work function (WF) of ITO electrodes (Fig. 3a). The bare ITO shows a WF of −4.75 eV.18 After modification by PCPDT-T, the WF of the ITO substrate can be improved to −4.87 eV, which is slightly lower than that of PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO (−4.96 eV) (see Fig. 3b). When the PCPDT-T was replaced by PCPDT-2T, the WF was tuned to −4.78 eV. The WF of the PCPDT-2T-modified ITO does not match well with the HOMO level of the commonly used active layer, resulting in the inefficient hole extraction.

Then, we tested the interface compatibility of the different hole transport layer modified ITO electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4, the surface energy of the ITO electrode modified by PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T was 61.4, 30.7 and 23.2 mN m−1, respectively. Compared with the PEDOT:PSS-modified ITO electrode, PCPDT-T reduced the surface energy, implying that the ITO electrode can be more compatible with the active layer (13.4 mN m−1).

We also carried out photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay measurements on the multilayer films with a configuration of the ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer. As shown in Fig. 5a, the PCPDT-T led to an active layer with more efficient PL quenching than PEDOT:PSS, indicating more efficient hole transfer from the active layer to the HTL. Fig. 5b presents the time-resolved PL decay transients on different HTLs. From the calculation of decay values, an average fluorescence lifetime (τaver) of 154.0 ± 0.02 ns for the bare ITO/active layer, 0.97 ± 0.02 ns for the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer, 0.95 ± 0.02 ns for the ITO/PCPDT-T/active layer, and 1.58 ± 0.02 ns for the ITO/PCPDT-2T/active layer was obtained. Compared with the active layer on PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T reduced the τaver, implying that holes separated from photogenerated excitons within the active layer are efficiently extracted from the active layer to the ITO electrode. As expected, the PCPDT-2T did not deliver better holes separation than PEDOT:PSS, and this may be because PCPDT-T has a low work function.

In addition, we provided the curves of the maximum power point voltage (Vmpp) versus the thickness of the HTL (see Fig. 6). It shows that when the thickness of PCPDT-T was increased from 2 to 65 nm, the Vmpp of the devices was kept at approximately 0.62 V, indicating that the hole extraction ability of the PCPDT-T layers is excellent. Fig. 6 also indicates that the Vmpp values of the PCPDT-T-based devices are slightly higher than those of the PEDOT:PSS-based devices, implying that PCPDT-T has better hole extraction properties than PEDOT:PSS.

Fig. S6† provides the transmittance spectra of PCPDT-T, PCPDT-2T and PEDOT:PSS films spin-coated on ITO. Compared with PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T showed slight enhancement transmittance in the range of 330–370 and 460–900 nm, respectively. The high transmissivity can make more sunlight to pass through the HTL, and is absorbed by active sleeves. All of them could totally cover the surface of ITO, suggesting their good film properties (Fig. S7†). In addition, a smooth surface morphology and microphase separation nanostructure of the active layer evaluated by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (Fig. S8–S10†) demonstrated that PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T would be promising HTL materials for OSCs.
OSC characterization
To verify the interfacial modification of PCPDT-T in devices, the devices with an architecture of ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al (Fig. 7a) were fabricated. Fig. 7b presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves using PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T as the HTLs. A device with PEDOT:PSS exhibited a PCE of 8.0% with a Jsc of 17.03 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.770 V and a FF of 0.608 (see Table 2). Replacing PEDOT:PSS with PCPDT-T led to a significant enhancement in device efficiency. The devices with PCPDT-T yielded a PCE of 9.3% with a Jsc of 18.92 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.771 V and a FF of 0.635. The Jscs of the devices with PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T as the HTL are consistent with the Jscs calculated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (PEDOT:PSS is 16.15 ± 0.20, PCPDT-T is 17.91 ± 0.21 and PCPDT-2T is 15.97 ± 0.24 mA cm−2; Fig. 7c). The margin of error between the Jsc from J–V and EQE measurements was ±10%. Fig. 7d shows the dark J–V characteristic test. The PCPDT-T had less leakage current.

PCPDT-T has a high and homogeneous mobility and suitable WF, which significantly improves the Jsc and FF of the devices. As shown in Fig. 8a, the hole mobility of the devices with PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T HTLs was estimated to be 1.64 × 10−3, 5.49 × 10−3 and 2.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobilities of PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T are higher than that of PEDOT:PSS, leading to the increased Jsc and FF in the devices. Fig. 8b shows the Nyquist plots of the measured impedance for devices with PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T HTLs, respectively. Note that the PCPDT-T containing device has a significantly reduced bulk resistance as indicated by the decreased radius in the Nyquist plot. With PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T instead of PEDOT:PSS, the series resistance (Rs) value will be reduced from 3.2 Ω cm2 to 2.7 Ω cm2 and 2.9 Ω cm2. The improved hole mobility and series resistance in the devices further confirmed the improved and more homogeneous mobility of CPEs.

(c) Dependence of the device performance on the thickness of the HTL. (d) Dependence of the FF on the thickness of the HTL. 
Although the PCPDT-2T has a mismatched WF with the PTB7-Th3, but it still obtained a PCE of 7.6%, due to its improved mobility. The hole extraction ability of PCPDT-T was stronger than that of PEDOT:PSS, which can reduce leakage current.19 According to the Shockley equation, when the leakage current decreases, the Voc will slightly increase. In addition, the mobility of PCPDT-T was higher and more uniform, and the impedance of OSCs was smaller (Fig. 8b), which can further reduce the loss of Voc. Therefore, when PEDOT:PSS and PCPDT-T were used as the HTLs, the Voc of OSCs was almost the same.
Due to the high mobility, it is delightful to find that PCPDT-T can work well in a much thick film. As shown in Fig. 8c and Table S1,† the PCE values initially raised up when the film thickness was increased from 2 to 11 nm, providing an optimal thickness of 11 nm for the PCPDT-T HTL. After that, the device efficiencies gradually declined as the PCPDT-T thickness was continuously increased. Notably, the OSC devices still preserve a PCE of 7.1% even when the PCPDT-T thickness was increased to 50 nm. Correlation of the FF and thickness of PCPDT-T can give a deep insight into its thickness insensitivity to the device performance. As shown in Fig. 8d, the FF values remained constant when the PCPDT-T thickness was increased from 2 to 50 nm. The FF values can be used to evaluate the charge recombination and charge collection efficiency in OSCs. Therefore, the FF independent of the PCPDT-T thickness indicated that the high and homogeneous mobility of the PCPDT-T HTL could minimize the charge recombination as well as ensure the efficient charge transport and collection even when the thick film was used. Such thickness insensitive PCPDT-T is expected to be quite suitable for the future roll-to-roll processing.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully employed pH neutral and solution-processable PCPDT-T and PCPDT-2T as the HTLs in OSCs. The high and homogeneous mobility, low Rs, high optical transparency, smooth surface morphology, and short fluorescence lifetime of the PCPDT-T film lead to superior hole selectivity for facilitating hole transport from the active layer to the ITO anode. As a result, the device with the PCPDT-T HTL exhibits higher PCE than that of the device fabricated with the widely used PEDOT:PSS. Notably, PCPDT-T exhibited excellent thickness insensitivity because of the high and homogeneous mobility. As an alternative to PEDOT:PSS, PCPDT-T is a promising hole transport material for efficient OSCs that can be used on flexible substrates via roll-to-roll processing.
