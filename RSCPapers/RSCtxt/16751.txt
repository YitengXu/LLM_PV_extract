    , Accepted 3rd May 2022First published on 4th May 2022AbstractThe interface between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite film plays a vital role in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, (2-hydroxyethyl)amine hydroiodide (EOAI) is employed to regulate the interface properties at the SnO2/perovskite. The –NH3+ positive and I− negative ion groups in EOAI, which are anchored on the surface of SnO2 through –OH groups, can passivate the interface defects of perovskite films. Besides, the modified ETL has a smaller work function (WF) and EVB than pristine ones, which contributes to efficient charge transport and collection. Furthermore, the introduction of EOAI can also improve the crystallinity of the perovskite layer. As a result, PSCs with EOAI-modified SnO2 produce a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.61%, and an improved environmental stability. At the same time, the 1.68 eV wide-band gap perovskite solar cell achieved a PCE close to 20% and the semitransparent device also achieved an efficiency of over 17%.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells have attracted wide attention in recent years with the power conversion efficiency soaring to over 25%.1–3 In a typical perovskite structure, SnO2 is widely used as an electron transport layer. Compared with TiO2, SnO2 does not require a high-temperature sintering process and has higher UV stability and lower hysteresis for the final photovoltaic devices.4–6 However, there is still tremendous room for SnO2-based PSCs to promote their efficiency towards the theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit.7 The non-radiative recombination of carriers at the SnO2/perovskite is one of the important reasons for the performance loss of PSCs. The non-radiative recombination centers at the interface include halide vacancies, cation vacancies of the perovskite, oxygen vacancies and traps induced by hydroxyl groups (–OH) of SnO2, etc.8–11
In order to solve the above problems, some techniques have been applied. As an effective interface engineering technology, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been widely used in organic solar cells (OSCs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and become the core technology in the field of PSCs in recent years.8,12–14 Yang et al. obtained high performance SnO2-based PSCs through fine control of the interface interaction between the SAM and perovskite, with an efficiency of 18.8%.10 Huang and coworkers adopted a dopamine (DA) SAM as an interlayer at the ETL/perovskite interface.15 Hydroxyl groups help DA SAM anchor onto the surface of SnO2, while amino groups can provide nucleation sites for the perovskite layer and also passivate the trap states of the perovskite. The DA SAM improved the perovskite film quality and the interfacial charge transfer. The PSCs with DA-modified SnO2 showed high performance with a PCE of 16.87%. Fang and coworkers introduced 3-aminopropyltri-ethoxysilane (APTES) SAMs onto a SnO2 ETL. It is reported that APTES SAMs can increase the surface energy of SnO2 and prevent carrier recombination loss in PSCs by passivating the interface trap states between SnO2 and the perovskite. PSCs modified by APTES SAMs finally gave a PCE of 18.32%.11
Herein, (2-hydroxyethyl)amine hydroiodide (EOAI) was employed to regulate the ETL/perovskite interface, which is a simple and effective strategy for modifying the ETL/perovskite interface. The anchoring of EOAI onto the SnO2 surface is through a condensation reaction between –OH in EOAI and –OH on the SnO2 surface. At the same time, –NH3+ and I− groups in EOAI are expected to passivate the defects at the ETL/perovskite interface. The modified SnO2 has a smaller work function (WF) and EVB of 4.18 eV and 4.14 eV (4.32 eV and 4.27 eV for pristine SnO2), which contributes to efficient interface carrier extraction. In addition, EOAI is also beneficial to the crystallinity of the perovskite films on top. Eventually, SnO2–EOAI-based PSCs yielded a significant increase in PCE from 20.25% to 22.61%. At the same time, the 1.68 eV wide-band gap perovskite solar cell achieved a PCE close to 20%, and the semitransparent device also achieved an efficiency of over 17%.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 The preparation of a SnO2 film with/without EOAI

Fig. 1a shows the structure of standard PSCs in this work, which is constituted by ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. At the perovskite/SnO2 interface, the hydroxyl group –OH on the SnO2 surface can affect the device performance by reacting with the perovskite layer. In addition, the positive and negative ion defects such as the MA+ cation vacancy and halide anion (I−) vacancy defects on the surface of the perovskite layer also affect charge transport and device performance. In response to the above problems, EOAI was selected as an effective interface molecule because of its structure as shown in Fig. 1b. The molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1c. We used the density functional theory (DFT) method to simulate the electrostatic potential (ESP) and analyze the electron density distribution in EOAI (as shown in Fig. 1d). In the EOAI molecular structure, –OH in EOAI can react with –OH on the SnO2 surface to inhibit the reaction with the perovskite layer,8 and the ammonium cation (–NH3+) (electron deficient region (positive region)) and iodide anion (I−) (high electron density region (negative region)) of EOAI can effectively passivate the positive and negative ion defects on the perovskite surface, respectively. As one of the simplest units with groups such as –OH, –NH3+ and I−, EOAI can provide guidance for the selection of additives. Fig. 2 shows the preparation process of SnO2 film with or without EOAI treatment. SnO2 film is obtained by spin-coating the SnO2 colloid precursor with annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. Then EOAI isopropanol solution is spin-coated on the top of the SnO2 films, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. Finally, isopropanol solvent washing was used to remove the excess EOAI and obtain the EOAI–SnO2 hybrid film.

Fig. 3 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of SnO2 and SnO2–EOAI films. In Fig. 3a, XPS peaks of I 3d and N 1s are observed at 630.6/618.8 eV and 400.5 eV, respectively, for SnO2–EOAI films, while these peaks are not observed in control SnO2 films. This observation indicates the existence of EOAI on the surface of the SnO2 films. The FTIR spectra of the SnO2 films without and with EOAI further prove the existence of EOAI as shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The characteristic peaks of SnO2 shift from 646 cm−1 to 659 cm−1 indicating that the EOAI is indeed bonded with SnO2. At the same time, the XPS peak of Sn 3d for the SnO2–EOAI film is shifted by 0.3 eV (Fig. 3b) towards larger binding energy compared to that of control SnO2 films. To evaluate the interaction between EOAI and perovskite, Fig. 3c shows the XPS spectra of Pb 4f for the perovskite films without and with EOAI. The shift of the Pb 4f peak indicates the bonding between the perovskite and EOAI. In order to verify the affect of the depth of EOAI on the perovskite film, a perovskite–EOAI sample was etched and the relevant XPS test results are shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). The results show that the EOAI molecules affect only the surface of the perovskite film. These facts indicate that EOAI can both react with SnO2 and the perovskite. In order to further verify the reaction between EOAI and SnO2, the XPS results of O 1s of the SnO2 film with and without EOAI treatment are shown in Fig. 3d–f. The O 1s peak is decomposed into two peaks. The XPS peak at ∼530.5 eV corresponds to the Sn–O bond in SnO2, and the XPS peak at ∼531.8 eV corresponds to the O–H group present on the surface of the SnO2 film.16,17 The intensity ratio of the O–H bond to Sn–O for EOAI–SnO2 is significantly lower than that of SnO2, indicating that the EOAI treatment reduces the number of O–H groups present on the surface of the SnO2 film. The decreased number of O–H groups on the surface of EOAI–SnO2 is due to the dehydration reaction of –OH groups in EOAI and –OH groups on SnO2, which can be represented by formula (1):17 Sn–OH + HO–CH2CH2NH3I → Sn–O–CH2CH2NH3I + H2O(1)

(d–f) XPS spectra of O 1s and (g–I) C 1s core levels of SnO2, SnO2–EOAI and SnO2–EOAI-washing films. 
Meanwhile, the possible reaction between EOAI and the perovskite can be represented by formula (2): 2xHOCH2CH2NH3+·I− + (MAFA)1−xPb(IBr)3 + (MAFA)Pb(IBr)3−x → (HOCH2CH2NH3+)x·(MAFA)1−xPb(IBr)3 + (MAFA)Pb(IBr)3−x·Ix−(2)
In addition, in order to verify the influence of isopropanol solvent washing on the SnO2–EOAI film, the XPS results of C 1s are shown in Fig. 3g–i. In the C 1s XPS spectrum of the control SnO2 film, only CO (288.5 eV) and C–C (284.8 eV) peaks are observed (Fig. 3g).18 In the C 1s XPS spectrum of the SnO2–EOAI film, new XPS peaks at 286.5 and 285.5 eV are derived which are, respectively, assigned to C–N and C–O in the EOAI molecules (Fig. 3h). As we remove the excess EOAI molecules on the surface of the SnO2–EOAI film by isopropanol washing, the integrated intensity ratio of O–H to O–Sn in the O 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 3f) and the XPS peaks belonging to C–N and C–O in the C 1s are obviously reduced (Fig. 3i).
In order to evaluate the distribution and coverage of EOAI on the surface of the SnO2 film, the energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping of the SnO2–EOAI-washing film is performed. Fig. S1e–f (ESI†) show that N and I elements that come from EOAI are uniformly distributed on the surface of the SnO2 film. In addition, the water (perovskite precursor) contact angle of the SnO2 film modified by EOAI is reduced from 51.1° (60.3) to 11.3° (22.1) due to the hydrophilicity of the polar group –NH3+ of EOAI (Fig. S2, ESI†). The transmittance of SnO2 films modified by EOAI is slightly higher than that of the control SnO2 film (Fig. S3a, ESI†). However, as shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†), the conductivity of the SnO2 film modified by EOAI is unchanged compared with that of the control SnO2 film. At the same time, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) spectrum shows that the surface roughness of the SnO2 films is similar, and the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of SnO2 and SnO2–EOAI are 3.86 nm and 3.83 nm, respectively (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†).
2.2 The properties of perovskite film-based EOAI–SnO2

Fig. 4a and b show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films on SnO2 and SnO2–EOAI substrates, respectively. Compared with that of SnO2–perovskite films, the grain size of SnO2–EOAI–perovskite films is more uniform, which may be due to the smaller water contact angle leading to the decrease of the Gibbs free energy of heterogeneous nucleation.19–21Fig. 4c and d show the SEM images of the perovskite films. It can be seen that PbI2 aggregation on the surface of the perovskite films (bright dots) is significantly reduced due to the EOAI treatment. Meanwhile, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. 5a) show that the intensity of the PbI2 peak of the perovskite/EOAI film is reduced compared with that of the perovskite film, which indicates that EOAI passivates the PbI2 defects by interaction with the under-coordinated PbI2 centers.22 Meanwhile, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the perovskite film based on the SnO2–EOAI substrate is reduced from 29.5 nm to 22.0 nm, which is favorable to the physical contact between the perovskite film and HTL (Fig. S4c and d, ESI†).

(b), (c) PL and TRPL spectra of perovskite films based on SnO2 and SnO2–EOAI substrates, respectively. (d) Dark I–V curves of the electron-only devices with the VTFL kink points. 
The time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were used to study the carrier dynamic process of perovskite films under different conditions (Fig. 5b), and the relevant fitting parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The fast decay component τ1 and slow decay component τ2 are related to the quenching of charge carriers at the interface and the radiative recombination of free charge carriers in the bulk of perovskite films, respectively.23 Compared with τ1 of SnO2–perovskite, τ1 of SnO2–EOAI–perovskite is decreased from 22.3 ns to 9.4 ns with the proportion increasing from 70.7% to 80.4%, which is due to the reduction of interface defects leading to the improvement of interface charge transfer. Meanwhile, the faster τ2 of SnO2–EOAI–perovskite is due to the carrier recombination induced by charge transport. Fig. 5c shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of SnO2–EOAI–perovskite and SnO2–perovskite films. Compared with SnO2–perovskite films, SnO2–EOAI–perovskite exhibits stronger PL quenching, which indicates that SnO2–EOAI has higher electron extraction capability and thereby less charge recombination. In order to verify the trap density of perovskite films based on different ETL substrates, we measured the electron trap density by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis with the structure of electron-only devices (ITO/ETL/perovskite/PCBM/Ag) (Fig. 5d). The current-density versus voltage (J–V) curves of electron-only devices were taken in the dark. The curves can be divided into three parts based on the value (n) of the current relative to the voltage: n =1 is the ohmic region, n = 2 is the SCLC region, and in between is the trap-filled limited (TFL) region. The voltage at the turning point of the ohmic region and TFL region is called the trap-filling limit voltage (VTFL). The trap density (ntrap) is obtained by formula (3):24,25 ntrap = 2ε0εVTFL/eL2(3)
The lower trap densities of SnO2–EOAI-based PSCs indicate that EOAI can effectively passivate perovskite interface defects and reduce the carrier recombination.19 It is consistent with the results of TRPL and PL. Fig. 6a, b and c, d are the PL mapping and corresponding PL lifetime distribution of the perovskite films. Compared with the SnO2–perovskite film, the PL intensity and lifetime of the SnO2–EOAI–perovskite film are significantly reduced. In addition, the lifetime distribution is relatively uniform with little difference (Fig. S5, ESI†). The above results show that EOAI can effectively improve the carrier transport at the interface of ETL/perovskite and reduce the density of trap states, which is beneficial for the improvement of the performance of the perovskite device.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to study the effect of EOAI on the surface energy levels as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The Fermi level (EF), the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) are determined by EF = 21.22 − Ecut-off, EVB = EF − EF,edge, and ECB = EVB + Eg, respectively. Accordingly, the EF of perovskite, SnO2, and SnO2–EOAI are determined to be 4.31, 4.32, and 4.18 eV, respectively. The band gaps (Eg) are determined by using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S6, ESI†). Finally, the ECB of perovskite, SnO2 and SnO2–EOAI are calculated to be −5.68, −8.05, and −7.92 eV, respectively. The EVB of perovskite, SnO2 and SnO2–EOAI are determined to be −4.11, −4.27, and −4.14 eV, respectively. All the parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Fig. 7 shows the schematic energy-level alignment. After EOAI modification, the EF of SnO2 decreases from 4.32 eV to 4.18 eV, which is due to the strong negative interface dipole generated by the large electronegativity difference between O and N in the EOAI molecule.17 The decrease of EF value leads to the increase of the built-in potential (Vbi), which not only inhibits the reverse transport of electrons from the SnO2 ETL to the perovskite layer, but also contributes to the charge separation, transport and collection of photogenerated carriers. At the same time, the difference between the EVB of perovskite and SnO2–EOAI is smaller than that of perovskite and SnO2. Therefore, EOAI modification of SnO2 improves the open-circuit voltage of solar cells.11,17

2.3 The device performance

Fig. 8a and Table 1 show the J–V curves of forward and reverse scanning (FS and RS) of perovskite devices and the relevant parameters, respectively. The SnO2-based champion perovskite device has an FS PCE of 20.25% (JSC is 23.23 mA cm−2, VOC is 1.141 V, and FF is 76.3), while for the RS PCE it is 20.49% (JSC is 23.32 mA cm−2, VOC is 1.147 V, and FF is 76.5). The best FS PCE of the SnO2–EOAI-based perovskite device is 22.61% (JSC is 24.16 mA cm−2, VOC is 1.168 V, and FF is 80.1%), while for the RS PCE it is 22.84% (JSC is 24.42 mA cm−2, VOC is 1.168 V, and FF is 80.0%). The hysteresis index (HI) of the SnO2–EOAI-based perovskite device (0.010) is lower than that of the SnO2-based perovskite device (0.012), which is calculated using the formula of HI = (PCERS − PCEFS)/PCERS. In addition, as shown in Fig. 8b, the JSC values calculated by integrating the EQE data (22.69 mA cm−2 for SnO2 device, 23.51 mA cm−2 for SnO2–EOAI device) have a good match with the JSC values of the J–V curves in Fig. 8a. Fig. 8c shows that the PCE output of the SnO2–EOAI-based PSC is stabilized at 22.17%, which is higher than that of the SnO2-based PSC (20.7%). The dark J–V curves of the PSCs were also tested to obtain J0 and n, as shown in Fig. 8d. The decrease in J0 and n indicates that there is a smaller carrier recombination loss in the perovskite film.26 Furthermore, the SnO2–EOAI-based devices shown in Fig. 8e and f have better reproducibility and stability. The enhanced device stability is mainly attributed to the improved perovskite/SnO2 interface contact and the quality of the perovskite layer. The above results indicate that SnO2–EOAI is an ideal ETL for high-performance PSCs. In addition, the device performance of the 1.68 eV wide-band gap PSC based on SnO2–EOAI achieved a PCE close to 20%, and the semitransparent device also achieved an efficiency of over 17% (Fig. S7 and Table S3, ESI†).

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we used EOAI to bridge SnO2 and perovskite films. EOAI is anchored on the surface of SnO2 through –OH groups. At the same time, –NH3+ positive and I− negative ion groups are used to passivate perovskite interface defects to reduce carrier recombination. The modified SnO2 has excellent properties such as effective charge extraction. In particular, the introduction of EOAI on SnO2 reduces the WF and EVB of SnO2, which leads to a higher VOC. Therefore, compared with SnO2-based PSCs, the PCE value of the optimized device increased from 20.25% to 22.61%. At the same time, the 1.68 eV wide-band gap perovskite solar cell achieved a PCE close to 20%, and the semitransparent device also achieved an efficiency of over 17%. In addition, the SnO2–EOAI-based PSCs showed good stability under the conditions of 10% relative humidity in the atmospheric environment. This research provides an effective strategy for the realization of high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.
