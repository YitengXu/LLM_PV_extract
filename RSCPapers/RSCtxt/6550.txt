    , Accepted 15th January 2020First published on 16th January 2020AbstractThree metal-free organic dyes, coded FS10, FS11, and FS12, were designed and synthesized by employing indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (IQ) as the main building block and three different edged donors, viz., triphenylamine, carbazole, and phenothiazine, respectively. In order to comprehend the feasibility of the novel dyes as probable sensitizers/co-sensitizers, they were well-characterized and their photochemical, electrochemical, and theoretical studies were processed. The photovoltaic properties were evaluated under 1.5 AM standard illumination conditions. FS10 acquired the best DSSC performance (η = 5.27%) with supreme VOC (0.676 V) and FF (70.1%). The contribution from the incorporated IQ was examined theoretically by using DFT and time-dependent DFT, and the results indicated that all the novel dyes displayed clear charge separation at the frontier occupied molecular orbitals. The investigation of the co-sensitization effect was carried out by employing the HD-2 ruthenium sensitizer. The corresponding photovoltaic performance revealed that FS10 gave the most positive co-sensitization effect by improving the efficiency to 8.32% (JSC = 18.68 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.672 V, FF = 66.2%), while HD-2 alone exhibited the efficiency of 7.47% (JSC = 19.00 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.650 V, FF = 60.5%). The increased VOC and FF resulted from the optimized anchoring mode on the TiO2 surface with the combination of FS10 and HD-2 and more uniform coverage, leading to the hindrance of dye aggregation and charge recombination. Additionally, despite the reduced JSC with co-sensitizers, the corresponding IPCE curves displayed more complex increasing as well as decreasing behavior as a function of wavelengths, thus reflecting that sensitizers and co-sensitizers not only compete but also compensate the light harvesting abilities.
1. Introduction
As one promising thin-film-based technology, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been getting intensive attention as the potential replacements of traditional silicon-based solar cells and their crucial findings have been summarized by many reviews.1–4 The prosperity of DSSCs can be dated back to 1991 when O’Regan and Grätzel reported high-efficiency DSSCs with dye anchoring on colloidal TiO2 films.5 Unlike other photovoltaic cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have unique fabrication and they normally consist of five basic components: transparent conducting oxide substrate, semiconductor, sensitizer, electrolyte or hole conductor, and counter electrode.1 Among them, sensitizers play a pivotal role in improving the overall DSSC performance mainly because of their function of harvesting the solar photons and sequentially converting them into electrons.6 Metal-based sensitizers, especially ruthenium complexes, have been discovered as promising photosensitizers in the assembly of DSSCs due to intense absorption extending to the near-infrared region, favorable electrochemical properties, and benign chemical stability.7 DSSCs employing Ru(II) complexes such as N3, N719, and Z907 have shown optimum performance with solar-to-power conversion efficiencies (η) over 10%.8–10 In our research group, numerous heteroleptic bipyridyl Ru(II) sensitizers have been developed with the investigation of structure–property relationships.11–17 However, metal-based sensitizers have certain drawbacks including the availability of noble metals, low molar extinction coefficients, and challenging purification procedures.18 As replacements, metal-free organic dyes have become very prominent owing to their easy availability, fine-tuning structural possibility, superior light harvesting capability, and cost effectiveness in their synthesis.19–22 The highest reported efficiency is 13.0% by using a dithienopicenocarbazole-derived metal-free organic sensitizer.23 In this context, the co-sensitization methodology, which is effective in facilitating the photon-harvesting capabilities of sensitizers with photoexcitation over broad UV-visible and near IR regions, was applied to further improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs by incorporating the merits of both Ru(II) complex and metal-free organic dyes into the same fabricated device.24–29
In the literature, a wide range of design approaches have been published for the advancement of effective organic sensitizers as well as co-sensitizers. One feasible strategy is to employ efficient auxiliary acceptors, which possess both electron-transporting and electron-accepting characteristics, into the skeleton of dyes with the goal of tailoring molecular structures, extending the π-conjugating system, refining energy level, and enhancing the photostability.21,30 The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic quinoxaline has been broadly employed in the construction of organic sensitizers because of its strong electron withdrawing effect.31–34 Two symmetric unsaturated nitrogen atoms in quinoxaline provide high electron affinity.35 The first breakthrough of quinoxaline-based sensitizers can be traced back to 2012 when four novel sensitizers were synthesized with bathochromically shifted maximum absorption bands and increased light harvesting efficiencies in DSSC studies.36 In 2018, solid-state DSSCs were assembled with quinoxaline-based sensitizers and used as a special solidification method, which yielded the efficiency of 11.7%, which is the highest up-to-date efficiency acquired for solid-state DSSCs.37 In order to mediate π-electronic conjugation and to potentially maximize the electron withdrawing effect of quinoxaline chromophore, the π-spacer and terminal anchoring groups are substituted at the 6-position of quinoxaline to manipulate the charge transfer direction throughout quinoxaline. To further improve the DSSC performance, the incorporation of stiff and coplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) core into the skeleton of dyes can also be considered since PAH provides high levels of π-conjugation and delocalization.38,39 Hence, quinoxaline is converted into indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (IQ) by fusing an electron-rich indole part inside.40–42
With the aforesaid information in mind, a series of novel IQ-based sensitizers FS10, FS11, and FS12 were tailored and synthesized. Three additional donors, viz., triphenylamine, carbazole, and phenothiazine, were bound to the indole side, respectively. Thiophene and cyanoacetic acid were employed as π-linker and anchoring group correspondingly. To realize a facile structural modification for attaining high self-anti-aggregation, an ethyl chain was incorporated into IQ segments for all the three dyes and a hexyl group was attached to the edged donors for FS11 and FS12. The effect of tuning the ICT direction on the photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties was launched and a comparison of structure–property relationship with different additional donors was carried out. To further study the photovoltaic properties, the co-sensitization method was employed by combining FS10, FS11, and FS12 with a highly efficient bipyridyl Ru(II) sensitizer HD-2 (Fig. 1)43 with maximized light harvesting ability with complementary absorption spectra.28 The co-sensitization effect on all the J–V parameters including photocurrent, photovoltage, and fill factors is systematically taken into consideration. The molecular structures of FS10, FS11, and FS12 are drawn in Fig. 1.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Molecular design and synthesis
Instead of using commonly 5,8-disubstituted quinoxaline as an auxiliary acceptor to synthesize organic sensitizers, herein, a 6-substituted quinoxaline core was employed with the purpose of controlling the charge transfer throughout quinoxaline in a different direction. An indole segment was further merged with quinoxaline as indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (IQ) to endow efficient photoinduced electron transfer and charge separation. To increase the electron donating effect, an additional donor selected from triphenylamine, N-hexyl carbazole, and N-hexyl phenothiazine is attached to the indole part of IQ building block to design and produce FS10, FS11, and FS12, respectively. Moreover, to evade unfavorable π–π stacking and intermolecular aggregation, an ethyl group is substituted at the indole position of IQ, and FS11 and FS12 branch out the long hexyl chain on the additional donor.
The major synthetic pathway of these sensitizers is outlined in Scheme 1. The starting materials of N,N-diphenyl-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)aniline (4a), 9-hexyl-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (4b), and 10-hexyl-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-10H-phenothiazine (4c) were synthesized based on the published procedures.44–47 Monoaldehyde-substituted compound 2 was attained from the Suzuki coupling reaction between 2-bromo-6-ethyl-6H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (1) and 5-formyl-2-thienylboronic acid. In the next step, bromination reaction was carried out for 2 with N-bromosuccinimide to get 3, which was continuously involved in another Suzuki coupling to get 5a, 5b, and 5c. The last step was the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of the above three aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate to accomplish the target products (FS10, FS11, and FS12). All the intermediates and target dyes were confirmed by 1H NMR and high-resolution accurate MS, and are presented in the ESI.† The detailed procedures of the important intermediates are also depicted in the ESI.†

2.2. Photophysical behavior
The photophysical properties of these novel dyes were investigated by evaluating their UV-vis absorption and PL emission spectra in DMF with the concentration of 2 × 10−5 M. The evaluation of the UV-vis absorption spectra of FS10, FS11, and FS12 was outlined in Fig. 2. For FS11 and FS12, the high-energy absorption bands with λmax of 322 and 306 nm, respectively, can be attributed to π → π* transition localized within carbazole/phenothiazine, IQ, and thiophene segments. The intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) throughout the whole molecule via conjugated IQ moieties was determined by the low-energy absorption maxima in the region of 411–416 nm. However, for FS10, three absorption bands were displayed in the spectra, where the high-energy band of 309 nm was attributed to the π → π* transition spectra and the other two can be assigned to the ICT spectra together. The lowest-energy absorption spectra of FS10 exhibited the λmax of 413 nm with the molar extinction coefficient of 4.41 × 104 mol−1 cm−1. Compared to FS10 and FS11, FS12 presented the highest extinction coefficient (4.65 × 104 mol−1 cm−1) for the ICT-based absorption peak. Since good photon-harvesting capabilities usually benefit from high molar extinction coefficient,14 it is indicated that FS12 has advantages on photoexcitation and charge injection. Furthermore, the “vertical” electron flowing mode throughout quinoxaline facilitates the charge transfer and sequential charge injection. Table 1 summarizes the spectral data of these three dyes.

In addition, Fig. 3 depicts the PL emission spectra of FS10, FS11, and FS12, and their corresponding data is also summarized in Table 1. The spectra of FS10 and FS12 showed a broad single emission band with the λem of 502 and 507 nm, respectively, while FS11 presented the emission spectra with a gentle shoulder peak. The relative intensity of the luminescence maxima is arranged in the descending order as FS10 > FS12 > FS11.
 Fig. 3  Emission spectra of FS10, FS11, and FS12 recorded at their excitation wavelengths. 
The absorption spectra when FS10, FS11, and FS12 bind onto the TiO2 surface are displayed in Fig. 4. Unlike the sharp UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye solutions, the broadened absorption behavior of the solid film can be treated as evidence that most of the dye molecules anchored onto the semiconductor surface. In contrast to the normally detected blue-shifted absorption spectra for most of the dyes anchored onto TiO2, the solid film absorption peaks exhibited a red shift in comparison to that for the dye solution, which is probably due to the J-aggregation of the sensitizer molecules.48 The generation of J-aggregated molecules can be assigned to the interaction the carboxylate group of the sensitizer and Ti4+ ions of the semiconductor. Consequently, the π* energy level of the dye molecule is reduced, which is desirable for the improvement of the photocurrent. The dye loading on the TiO2 surface follows the following order: FS10 > FS12 > FS11.

2.3. Electrochemical behavior
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were performed in DMF solution to estimate the thermodynamic probability of electron injection and dye regeneration. Ferrocene (0.4 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) served as an external reference to regulate the redox potential. The CV graphs of dyes FS10, FS11, and FS12 were outlined and the oxidation onset of each CV curve is equal to the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP). Moreover, the onset of the UV-vis absorption spectra was employed to calculate E0–0. The excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) was obtained from the values of E0–0 and GSOP. The values in volts (V) against NHE were converted to electron volt (eV) depending on eqn (1).49 ESOP = [(GSOP (V) + 4.7) − E0-0] eV(1)The experimental ground and excited state oxidation potentials of all the organic dyes FS10, FS11, and FS12 were exceedingly similar, as tabulated in Table 1. According to the previous publication, it has been pointed out that the position of GSOP and ESOP energy levels of a sensitizer in relation to the Nernst potential of CB (conduction band) of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte, respectively, particularly determines the process of effective charge injection and dye regeneration.50 Also summarized in Table 1, the calculated GSOP level of dyes FS10 (−5.54 eV), FS11 (−5.54 eV), and FS12 (−5.53 eV) were all below the redox potential of the iodolyte system (−5.2 eV), establishing that there is enough thermodynamic driving force to regenerate the dye by replenishing the hole via electron donation from the I3−/I− redox couple. Additionally, the ESOP values of FS10 (−3.12 eV), FS11 (−3.13 eV), and FS12 (−3.11 eV) are all found to be higher than the conduction band (CB) edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV), demonstrating that electron injection from the excited state of the dyes into the CB of TiO2 is thermodynamically spontaneous. The band gaps for FS10 (2.42 eV), FS11 (2.41 eV), and FS12 (2.42 eV) are almost identical, which is chiefly attributed to the intrinsic peculiarity of the IQ building block. Furthermore, the similar electrochemical properties of the three novel dyes are also related to the same “vertical” charge transfer through quinoxaline and the same structural design. As a result, all the dyes fulfilled the basic requirements for effective electron injection and dye regeneration process in the fabricated devices. The results obtained from photophysical and CV studies are drawn in the form of an energy level diagram in Fig. 5.

2.4. Theoretical calculations
The quantum calculations including density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) are recognized as dependable computational methodologies in the area of organic photovoltaics, especially sensitizers of DSSCs. The equilibrium molecular geometries and electron distribution for the frontier molecular orbitals of FS10, FS11, and FS12 were calculated using DFT with the Guassian09 package.51 The ground-state geometries were optimized using the CAM-B3LYP energy functional and 6-31G(d) basis set. Solvation effects (DMF) were taken into consideration in the geometry optimization with the non-equilibrium version of the CPCM model52 implemented in Gaussian09. The optimized geometries were sequentially employed for the TD-DFT energy calculation with the same functional and basis set. The calculated electrochemical parameters, GSOP, ESOP, and E0–0 are summarized in Table 2 together with the experimental ones, and they displayed good agreement. According to the calculation, FS10 exhibited the smallest bandgap and the highest ESOP value, providing the best light-harvesting capability and the largest electron injection free energy, both of which are beneficial for its photovoltaic performance in the fabricated solar devices.

Fig. 6 exhibits the optimized molecular geometries of FS10, FS11, and FS12 with the dihedral angles between their major moieties. The dihedral angles between the edged donors and the IQ segments vary from 36.51° to 38.27°, probing showing that the hindrance between IQ moieties and the additional donors is not affected by the switch of the donors. However, the dihedral angles between the IQ parts and thiophene are 24.38°, 24.41°, and 24.49° for FS10, FS11, and FS12, respectively, meaning that the insertion of thiophene is beneficial for the coplanarity of the conjugation system and subsequent charge transfer.

Moreover, the corresponding electron cloud delocalization between their frontier energy levels are depicted in Fig. 7. The isodensity of the molecular orbitals exhibits distinguished intramolecular charge delocalization, i.e., effective charge separation in the HOMO and LUMO. The calculation shows that HOMOs of all the dyes exhibit a significant population on a combination of donors, particularly the contribution from the indole part of the IQ segment. In contrast, in the LUMO energy levels, a distinct shift of the electron density towards the quinoxaline part of the IQ segment, thiophene, and the anchoring group can be observed for all the dyes. The significant delocalization of LUMO electron density over cyanoacetic acid facilitates electronic coupling between the electron density at its LUMO level and the d orbitals of TiO2. Therefore, the “vertical” charge transfer through quinoxaline also guarantees the sufficiently light-initiated electron transfer from the dye to the TiO2 semiconductor, leading to efficient charge separation and hindering the charge-hole recombination.

To analyze the electronic excitations under the influence of time-dependent perturbations, TD-DFT studies were conducted. Fig. 8 outlines the simulated absorption spectrum of FS10, FS11, and FS12. Although it is well noted that the calculations with TD-DFT lack precise prediction of long-range charge transfer states related energies due to the self-interaction error, the aforesaid variance is not perceived in the present modeling as the molecules under study are not large enough to present a long-range intramolecular charge transfer.53 As observed in Fig. 8, all the dyes exhibit low-energy absorption responses that are assigned to ICT transitions, which correlated well with the experimental absorption data (Fig. 2). The theoretical ICT-based absorption peaks were exhibited at 423, 421, and 414 nm for FS10, FS11, and FS12, respectively. Besides, the calculated absorptions also displayed a high-energy band in the range of 300–330 nm owing to the π → π* transition.

To further investigate the behaviors of the novel dyes on semiconductor surfaces inside the fabricated solar cells, the geometries of dye sensitizers anchored by their carboxylic acid groups onto the Ti24O48 surface slab were optimized, and the corresponding highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals are given in Fig. 9. The highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals for all the three novel dyes on anatase surface are very similar. All the highest occupied orbitals (HOMO, HOMO−1, HOMO−2) are mostly distributed on the electron donor series. As reported in the literature,54 all the lowest unoccupied orbitals are delocalized on the TiO2 anatase surface, which are anticipated to be responsible for good performances of the dye sensitizers, especially all the isodensities at the LUMO on the TiO2 slab, on which the dyes are anchored. The electron clouds shifting between HOMO and LUMO increase the probability of electron transfer and injection from all the three dyes to TiO2 upon photoexcitation.

2.5. Photovoltaic characterization
The DSSC performance was studied by fabricating the novel dyes into the solar cells. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) served as a co-adsorbent in the dye solution.55 The photovoltaic measurements of FS10, FS11, and FS12 on the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode were processed under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with an electrolyte, iodolyte HI-30, from Solarnoix. Fig. 10 plots the J–V characteristic curves of the solar devices based on FS10, FS11, and FS12. Their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 3. The overall energy conversion efficiency, η, is calculated from the photocurrent density measured at short-circuit (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), the fill factor of the cell (FF), and the intensity of incident light (Pin), according to eqn (3). (2)Compared to FS11 and FS12, FS10 exhibited the best DSSC performance with the maximum η of 5.27% (JSC = 11.10 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.676 V, and FF = 70.1%), and also the highest JSC and FF values. The highest VOC value of FS10 can be ascribed to its maximum dye loading amount on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 4). Since FS10 has the smallest molecular size among the three dyes, the void left on the TiO2 surface is also the smallest, which translates into the effective impedance of undesirable dark current. The largest dye loading also leads to the highest FF value of FS10. The highest JSC value of FS12 can be ascribed to its highest ICT-based molar extinction coefficient (Fig. 2), turning into the maximum photon harvesting ability. Combined with Fig. 4, DSSC employing FS10 obtained the best efficiency and the maximum dye loading, demonstrating that FS10 has an excellent binding force with the Ti4+ ions of the semiconductor and guarantees swift charge injection from the dye to the CB of TiO2.

The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements for the fabricated devices FS10, FS11, and FS12 were continuously carried out. Fig. 11 displays the photocurrent action spectra for solar devices fabricated with novel sensitizers, where IPCE values from 300 to 800 nm are plotted as a function of wavelength. Their quantum efficiency obeys the descending order as FS12 > FS11 > FS10, which matches well with the order of JSC in the photovoltaic performance. Due to the strong photon harvesting capability of phenothiazine and the highest molar extinction coefficient of the low-energy absorption band of FS12, up to 70% of quantum efficiency was achieved from 400 to 440 nm. Furthermore, all the measured ICPE values did not show any sudden drop in the plateau region. Their IPCE results illustrate that the structural optimization with the “vertical” charge transfer also ensures that superior light-harvesting abilities of the dyes are converted into outstanding IPCE performance.

2.6. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a prevailing technique for evaluating the interfacial charge recombination dynamics occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte interface and supplies reasonable perceptions into the charge dynamics of a performing solar cell.56–58 Impedance analyzes the dielectric properties of a material and interface as the function of frequency. Fig. 12 compares EIS Nyquist and Bode plots for DSSC employing FS10, FS11, and FS12. Besides, the reaction resistance of the DSSCs was derived from the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 12c and its corresponding parameters are tabulated in Table 4.

As evidenced by the Nyquist plots, all the solar devices displayed two separate semicircles, which result from the combined achievement of charge transfer resistance and chemical capacitance. The semicircle in the middle frequency range is related to charge transfer resistance at the interface of dye/TiO2 combined with the chemical capacitance of electrons in TiO2 (eTiO2).16 The larger the middle-frequency semicircle, the slower the charge recombination of electrons in TiO2 (eTiO2) and electron acceptors in the electrolyte, and the higher the VOC attained in the DSSC performance. The radius of the bigger semicircle demonstrates that the electron recombination resistance falls into the order FS10 > FS11 > FS12, which coincides with their VOC values (FS10 > FS11 > FS12).
Additionally, in the Bode plots, frequency response in the range of 1–100 Hz is an indicator of the electron recombination between the electrolyte and TiO2, and is related to the electron lifetime in the CB of TiO2. It is derived from the peak value of the curve on the frequency axis. The more the peak is shifted to the lower frequency, the longer is the recombination lifetime. In comparison with FS11 and FS12, the Bode plot of FS10 displayed more shifting towards the low-frequency region, endowing longer electron lifetime and stronger dark current resistance. Therefore, FS10 achieved the highest VOC values in the photovoltaic performance. Conclusively, the EIS results provide evidence that due to the smallest molecular size, the anchoring approach of FS10 leaves the least unfolded area on the TiO2 surface with the largest dye absorbing amount, which is capable of overwhelming the unwanted charge recombination. These characteristics of FS10 also fulfill the prerequisites of a superior co-sensitizer.
2.7. Co-sensitization studies
To further explore the potentials of FS10, FS11, and FS12 in the DSSC fabrication and performance, these novel compounds were also served as co-sensitizers with the intention of expediting the performance of HD-2, one of the most excellent bipyridyl Ru(II) sensitizers.28,43 The UV-vis absorption spectra of HD-2 is drawn in the ESI.† To be an outstanding co-sensitizer, especially with HD-2, it should possess a high molar extinction coefficient in the region of 300–600 nm, where HD-2 has adverse light-harvesting abilities. As a consequence, it is proposed that the new co-sensitizers could benefit the photon harvesting and eventually improve the overall efficiency with enhanced J–V parameters.
The J–V characteristic plots of DSSCs sensitized with HD-2 alone and co-sensitized with FS10, FS11, and FS12 are shown in Fig. 13. Their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are organized in Table 5. In short, DSSCs co-sensitized with FS10 and FS11 revealed higher η than the device employing HD-2 alone. The overall efficiencies of HD-2 co-sensitized with FS10, FS11, and FS12 are 8.32%, 7.91%, and 6.59%, respectively, compared to 7.47% of the HD-2 alone sensitized device. When comparing the distinct J–V parameter, the VOC values of FS10 and FS11 co-sensitized DSSCs were superior in comparison with that of the HD-2 sensitized device alone (0.650 V), and the values are 0.672 and 0.664 V, respectively. The increased VOC can be ascribed to the fact that the comparatively small organic dyes can cover the unfilled voids left by the bulky HD-2 when immobilized on the TiO2 surface together. Thus, the surface area coverage is enhanced, continuously obstructing the dye aggregation and the charge recombination between I−/I3− in the electrolyte, and the electrons in the CB of TiO2. Accordingly, the co-sensitization effect leads to increased VOC values. In addition, all the fill factors were increased with the co-sensitization method compared to HD-2 sensitized device alone, which also gives credit to the more evenly covered TiO2 surface. In contrast to the increased VOC, all the JSC values with the co-sensitization methodologies were reduced, which is mainly due to the competition for light absorbing and harvesting. Among them, the co-sensitizer FS12 gave the most decrease in the photocurrent because of its highest molar extinction coefficient in the overlapped regime for light excitation with HD-2. Therefore, the JSC was damagingly influenced. Above all, co-sensitization with FS10 gave supreme improvement in the efficiency with the highest VOC and FF values. Even though FS10 displayed the largest dye loading amount (Fig. 4), it provided the least adverse influence on the JSC. Therefore, FS10 showed the best co-sensitization effect.

The IPCE curves of solar cells using co-sensitizers FS10, FS11 and FS12, and HD-2 alone are depicted in Fig. 14. Compared to the J–V characteristics, which simply reveal the increased or decreased outcomes, the IPCE curves are more sophisticated since they are associated with wavelengths. For instance, although the best co-sensitizer FS10 decreased the JSC, its IPCE plot outperformed the DSSC employing HD-2 alone from 370 to 500 nm with the quantum efficiency reaching 67% in the plateau region. It is mainly attributed to satisfactory light harvesting in the same range, which is also displayed in its own IPCE (Fig. 11). However, from 500 to 750 nm, the IPCE of DSSC co-sensitized with FS10 was less impressive. Therefore, the IPCE with the co-sensitization method can be treated as the complexation of two IPCEs employing Ru(II) sensitizer and metal-free sensitizer separately. Essentially, the IPCE performance is the combined accomplishment of the competition as well as the compensation of light harvesting. For FS11 and FS12, the co-sensitized IPCEs also outperformed HD-2 only based DSSC in the certain region.
 Fig. 14  Photocurrent action spectra (IPCE) of DSSCs sensitized with HD-2 alone and co-sensitized with FS10, FS11, and FS12. 
To further assess the co-sensitization effect of FS10, FS11, and FS12, their co-sensitized absorption spectra when both sensitizers anchored onto the TiO2 were also tested and are outlined in Fig. 15. It is remarkably found that the co-sensitized IPCE curves displayed analogous behaviors as the co-sensitized photophysical properties. For the FS10 co-sensitizer, its absorption spectra also exceeded that of HD-2 from 350 to 505 nm, while for the more red-shifted wavelengths, it showed diminished light harvesting. Therefore, Fig. 15 confirms that photon harvesting using co-sensitization strategy is always accompanied by competition and compensation.

The Nyquist and Bode plots of devices fabricated with FS10, FS11, and FS12 as co-sensitizers as well as HD-2 alone are displayed in Fig. 16. The correspondingly fitted parameters are summarized in Table 6via the equivalent circuit described before in Section 3.6. In the Nyquist plots, all the DSSCs exhibited two distinct semicircles, where the bigger one corresponds to the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radius of the bigger semicircle demonstrates that the electron recombination resistance reduced in the order of HD-2 + FS10 > HD-2 + FS11 > HD-2 + FS12 > HD-2, which decreases in accordance with their VOC values, as shown in Table 5. The charge recombination resistance from TiO2 to the redox couple in the electrolyte fell into the same order, in accordance with the Nernst impedance.59 As a consequence, the gap-filled co-sensitizer endows strong anti-aggregation, thus diminishing harmful charge recombination in the DSSC circuits.

3. Conclusions
Three newly designed dyes, FS10, FS11, and FS12, have been synthesized by incorporating indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (IQ) as the main chromophore into the backbone with the purpose of switching the direction of charge transfer throughout quinoxaline. Molecular modeling confirms that all the new sensitizers possessed clear charge separation at the HOMO/LUMO energy levels. For their photovoltaic properties, the DSSC based on FS10 obtained the best efficiency of 5.27% with the highest VOC (0.676 V) and fill factor (70.1%) because of its largest dye loading amount and the outstanding suppression of dark current. Moreover, FS12 gave the highest JSC (11.84 mA cm−2) and the greatest IPCE response (70%) due to its highest molar extinction coefficient of the ICT-related absorption band. For the investigation of the co-sensitization effect, the abovementioned best sensitizer FS10 also attained the most positive co-sensitization effect by improving the efficiency to 8.32% whereas DSSC using HD-2 alone displayed 7.47%. The outperformed efficiency is mainly ascribed to the raised VOC (0.672 V) and fill factor (66.2%) of the FS10 co-sensitized DSSC since the more compact TiO2 surface coverage obstructed the unwanted dye aggregation and charge recombination, which is also confirmed by their EIS results. Furthermore, although all the JSC values were adversely affected by the co-sensitization methods, the co-sensitized IPCEs outperformed the HD-2-based DSSC in the region where the co-sensitizers possess satisfactory light harvesting, indicating that both the competition and compensation on the photon harvesting exists between the sensitizer and the co-sensitizer during the DSSC performance. Above all, it is evident that the profound effect of operating the charge transfer direction is noteworthy when considering the structural modification of the sensitizers/co-sensitizers.
