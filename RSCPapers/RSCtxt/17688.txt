    , Accepted 5th July 2016First published on 5th July 2016AbstractColloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) exhibit excitonic and surface states, both of which may participate in charge-transfer processes relevant to solar energy conversion. To explore this inherent complexity of the charge-transfer mechanisms of QDs, we used steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements to characterize excited-state electron transfer (ET) from core-only CdSe QDs and core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs to TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Core-only QDs transferred electrons from both excitonic and surface states to TiO2 with rate constants of ET (ket) of approximately (1–3) × 108 s−1 and (4–7) × 107 s−1, respectively. Efficiencies of ET (ηet) from excitonic and surface states were approximately 71–82% and 64–76%, respectively. Thus, trapping of electrons lowered their potential energy but did not greatly affect the efficiency of their transfer to TiO2. Photogenerated holes were transferred from core-only CdSe QDs to adsorbed 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), which linked the QDs to TiO2. We characterized core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs as alternatives to core-only QDs. The ZnS shell eliminated the undesirable trapping of electrons and transfer of photogenerated holes to MPA. We measured ket of approximately (1–3) × 108 s−1 and ηet of approximately 66–85% for ET from excitonic states of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs to TiO2 NPs. The insensitivity of ket to the presence of the ZnS shell may have arisen from increased cross-linking of core/shell QDs to TiO2. Our results highlight the involvement of surface states in excited-state ET processes of core-only QDs and, for the heterostructures reported here, the improved performance of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs relative to core-only CdSe QDs.
Introduction
The unusual electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) renders them intriguing as absorbers of light and donors of excited charge carriers for solar energy conversion.1–4 QDs have size-dependent band gaps and band-edge potentials and high molar absorption coefficients.5–8 They can undergo slow charge-carrier cooling or multiexciton generation, potentially enabling the extraction of hot or multiple charge carriers.9–17 Additionally, the electronic structure of QDs is influenced by adsorbed capping ligands, which can passivate surfaces and determine energies of surface-localized electronic states.18–20 Relaxation of electrons and holes into surface states irreversibly dissipates potential energy and decreases the driving force of interfacial charge transfer. Therefore, to extract charge carriers from QDs before they relax into surface states is important from the standpoint of maximizing rates of charge transfer and efficiencies of solar cells and photocatalysts.
We and others have reported spectroscopic studies of excited-state electron transfer (ET) from cadmium chalcogenide QDs to molecularly-tethered metal oxide semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) and thin films.21–32 Such ET processes are central to the operational mechanism of QD-sensitized solar cells, the reported power-conversion efficiencies of which have increased dramatically.33,34 Rate constants of ET (ket) on the orders of 107 to 1012 s−1 have been measured, and ket has been shown to depend on driving force, the properties of molecular linkers, the size and crystallinity of QDs, the composition and electronic structure of the metal oxide substrate, and the mechanism by which QDs are deposited onto the substrate.25–32
Despite the significant effort to characterize ET from QDs to metal oxides, the mechanism of ET, and specifically the question of whether electrons are extracted from excitonic or surface states of QDs remains largely unexplored. This question is timely given the renewed interest in the nature of surface states. The broad and highly Stokes-shifted emission often exhibited by QDs has been taken as evidence for distributions of surface-localized states within the band gap, into which electrons and holes might relax before recombining at energies much less than the bandgap. Such states might be associated with unpassivated or ligand-bound atoms at surfaces of QDs.18,35 Kambhampati and coworkers recently proposed an alternative interpretation.20,36–39 They argued that the so-called trap-state emission from QDs, hereafter referred to as surface emission, can be accounted for by a single surface electronic state rather than a distribution of mid-gap states.36–38 Notably, a semiclassical treatment of ET from excitonic states to a surface state accounts for the temperature-dependent intensities of band-edge and surface emission.18,36–38 This new insight into the electronic structure of QDs has significant implications regarding mechanisms by which photogenerated electrons are transferred from QDs to acceptors.
Our research group reported that electrons could be extracted from both excitonic and surface states of QDs.24 In this article, we report the results of an in-depth spectroscopic characterization of the dynamics and mechanism of ET from core-only CdSe QDs and core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs to molecularly-tethered TiO2 NPs. Our results reveal (1) that both excitonic and surface states of core-only QDs were active in ET and (2) that the ZnS shell prevented the trapping of electrons in surface states and the transfer of holes to adsorbed ligands but did not decrease the rate constant or efficiency of ET to TiO2. Thus, the core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs were superior to core-only CdSe QDs in two significant respects. Our results highlight the mechanistic complexity of excited-state ET at QD-containing interfaces, the role of surface states in such processes, and the attractiveness of core/shell QDs as sensitizers of TiO2.
Experimental
Materials
Cadmium oxide (CdO), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) (90%), tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) (98%), and 1-tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) (98%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide and silica LUDOX dispersion (30% by weight in water) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Zirconium(IV) n-propoxide was obtained from TCI. Selenium powder was obtained from Puratronic. Ethanol (EtOH) (200 proof) was obtained from Decon Labs. Toluene and methanol (MeOH) were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Toluene dispersions of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs (QD540-OS Pure Core) were purchased from NOMCorp. All reagents were used as received.
Syntheses of metal oxide NPs
Titania (TiO2) colloids were prepared following the method of Robel et al.40 Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (0.20 mL, 0.66 mmol) was added dropwise to 10 mL of EtOH with vigorous stirring under Ar atmosphere. ZrO2 colloids were prepared by using an analogous method.21 Zirconium(IV) n-propoxide (0.21 mL, 0.66 mol) was added dropwise to 10 mL of EtOH with vigorous stirring under Ar atmosphere. Dispersions of metal oxide NPs were diluted by adding 10 mL of toluene. The as-synthesized TiO2 and ZrO2 dispersions were stable for several hours. A fresh batch of metal oxide dispersions was prepared before each spectroscopic measurement.
Synthesis of CdSe QDs
Toluene dispersions of CdSe QDs were prepared using the method reported by Peng and Peng.41 Selenium powder (0.206 g, 2.60 mmol) and TOP (10 mL) were combined in an Ar atmosphere in a glovebox, and the solution was sealed with a rubber septum and then transferred to a fume hood. The solution was stirred at room temperature until it turned colorless. CdO (0.206 g, 1.60 mmol) was added to TOPO (15.1 g, 39.1 mmol) and TDPA (0.892 g, 3.20 mmol) in a separate three-neck flask. The flask was heated to 300 °C under constant stirring until the cadmium-containing mixture became colorless. The solution was allowed to cool to 270 °C, at which point the selenium-containing solution was swiftly injected into the cadmium-containing mixture. Growth of CdSe QDs was evidenced by a change of the color of the mixture from pale yellow to orange to red. When the desired particle size was reached, the mixture was removed from heat and the reaction was quenched. To separate CdSe QDs from excess organic ligands (TOPO, TOP, and TDPA), nonsolvent/solvent washing was used. QDs were first flocculated by addition of MeOH, and the precipitate was isolated by centrifugation. The QDs were then resuspended in toluene. This washing procedure was repeated at least three times.
Spectroscopy
Mixed dispersions containing QDs and MPA and/or TiO2 or ZrO2 NPs were prepared as described in Appendix S1 in the ESI.† Briefly, the concentration of QDs was identical for all dispersions. The concentration of MPA was 0.1 mM for dispersions of core-only CdSe QDs containing MPA and was 1.5 mM for dispersions of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs containing MPA. The higher concentration of MPA in the dispersions containing CdSe/ZnS QDs corresponded to the threshold concentration above which adsorption-induced changes in the intensity of emission from QDs saturated, as described below. The concentration of TiO2 or ZrO2, in formula units, was 6.6 mM for all dispersions containing metal oxide NPs.
UV/vis absorption spectra were obtained with an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Steady-state emission spectra were acquired with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter with excitation at 440 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay traces were obtained with a Becker and Hickl Tau-130 time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) setup. The setup consisted of a pulsed diode laser (BDL 445 SMC) emitting monochromatic pulses at 445 nm with pulse-width of 40–90 ps (full width at half maximum (FWHM)) at 1 mW power and 50 MHz repetition rate. The laser could be operated at 3 different repetition rates (1 MHz, 20 MHz, and 50 MHz). All time-resolved measurements were made at 1 MHz repetition rate to avoid re-excitation of samples before decaying completely to the baseline. A delay cable equivalent to 50 ns was employed in the sync channel, and the time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) was fixed to 50 ns to acquire decay traces corresponding to the first 50 ns of decay to achieve higher time resolution. QD-containing dispersions were housed in a four-sided quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Emission was collected at 90° to the excitation beam and focused into a polychromator coupled to a 16-channel photomultiplier tube (PML 16-C). Each channel corresponded to a 12.5 nm window in the wavelength regime. All time-resolved measurements were obtained at magic angle conditions42 by placing a polarizer in the emission channel at 54.7° to the polarization of the excitation beam. A 460 nm long-pass filter was placed in the emission channel before the polychromator to minimize scattering of the excitation light from samples. A neutral density filter was used to adjust the intensity of the excitation beam such that the probability of detection of a photon per excitation pulse was less than 0.01. TRPL decay traces were obtained over 1024 time bins with time resolution of 48.8 ps. Decay traces were collected over 500 s for band-edge emission and 2000 s for surface emission. The instrument response function (IRF) was acquired by using a light-scattering suspension of silica LUDOX and measuring a decay trace at the excitation wavelength. At a laser gain of 20% and a detector gain of 90%, FWHM for the IRF was approximately 240 ps. TRPL decay traces were fitted using Fluofit software by Picoquant.
Results and discussion
Our strategy to quantify ET with emission spectroscopy
Excited-state ET from QDs to TiO2 NPs competes with trapping and electron–hole recombination and results in dynamic quenching of emission from the QDs.21,24,40,43 Thus, steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements are a useful but indirect method for quantifying the ET processes of interest. TCSPC with multichannel detection was particularly apt for this study because it enabled independent and simultaneous characterization of ET from excitonic and surface states.
We prepared mixed dispersions of QDs (core-only CdSe or core/shell CdSe/ZnS), MPA, and/or TiO2 or ZrO2 NPs using conditions established previously by our group and others.21,24,40 It is well-established that MPA can tether core-only CdSe QDs and core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs to TiO2 or ZrO2via coordination of its terminal thiol group to the QD and its terminal carboxyl group to the metal oxide.40,44,45 Thus, we anticipated the formation of QD–MPA–TiO2 or QD–MPA–ZrO2 assemblies within the mixed dispersions. The conduction band edge potential of ZrO2 is nearly 1 V more negative than that of bulk CdSe.46–49 Therefore, ET from photoexcited CdSe QDs to ZrO2 NPs was thermodynamically unfavorable, and ZrO2 NPs served as inert substrates for control experiments. MPA alone can quench the emission from QDs by accepting photogenerated holes.21,24,50–52 Additionally, TiO2 and ZrO2 NPs can quench emission from QDs via ET (for TiO2 only) and/or via changes in the local concentration or interfacial charge distribution in the vicinity of QDs upon immobilization on the NPs.24 To account for these possible quenching mechanisms, we measured steady-state and time-resolved emission from QDs alone, from dispersions of QDs with MPA (hereafter referred to as QD/MPA dispersions), from mixed dispersions of QDs and metal-oxide NPs (QD/TiO2 and QD/ZrO2 dispersions), and from mixed dispersions containing QDs, MPA, and metal-oxide NPs (QD–MPA–TiO2 and QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions). The concentration of QDs was equal in all dispersions. This approach enabled us to determine whether ET within QD–MPA–TiO2 assemblies caused additional quenching beyond the contributions from MPA or TiO2 alone and beyond the extent of quenching within QD–MPA–ZrO2 assemblies.
Electron transfer from core-only CdSe QDs

Electronic spectra. 
Core-only CdSe QDs exhibited a first excitonic absorption band with wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) of 500 nm (Fig. 1). The average diameter of the QDs was estimated to be 2.35 nm using the empirical equation reported by Yu et al.6 The optical band gap of the core-only CdSe QDs was estimated to be 2.39 eV from the x-intercept of a linear fit to the low-energy tail of a plot of the square of absorbance vs. wavenumber (Fig. S1 in ESI†). The core-only CdSe QDs exhibited a band-edge emission band centered at 520 nm, with FWHM of ∼29 nm (1100 cm−1), and a broad surface emission band centered at 750 nm (Fig. 1).

Steady-state emission quenching. 
Steady-state emission spectra were obtained for mixed dispersions containing core-only CdSe QDs, MPA, and/or metal oxide NPs, as a function of time after mixing. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each type of dispersion. Amounts of quenching were quantified as emission-quenching percentages (%Q), which equal [(I0 − I)/I0] × 100, where I0 is the intensity of emission at a given wavelength from dispersions of QDs alone and I is the intensity of emission from a quencher-containing dispersion. Normalized emission intensities at the band-edge and surface emission maxima from a representative experiment are plotted as a function of time in Fig. S2 in ESI.† At a given equilibration time, the addition of TiO2 or ZrO2 NPs to CdSe QDs quenched the emission of CdSe QDs to a similar extent (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Values of %Q for band-edge and surface emission were ∼30% and ∼10%, respectively. The emission spectral profile did not change upon addition of metal oxide NPs. Addition of MPA to CdSe QDs resulted in ∼80% quenching of band-edge emission, whereas surface emission was quenched by ∼40% (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Preferential quenching of band-edge emission by MPA is consistent with a hole-transfer mechanism, as the driving force for the transfer of holes from the valence band edge of CdSe QDs to the thiolate of adsorbed MPA is greater than that for the transfer of holes from surface-localized states at higher energies. QD–MPA–TiO2 and QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions were characterized to evaluate additional quenching of emission resulting from the formation of tethered assemblies and ET. Notably, emission from QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions was quenched to a much greater extent than emission from QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). Band-edge emission was quenched by ∼95% for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions and ∼88% for QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions relative to dispersions of free CdSe QDs. Surface emission was quenched by ∼89% for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions and ∼38% for QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions. We attribute the additional quenching of emission in the case of QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions to ET from QDs to TiO2, as explained above and consistent with prior reports.21,22,24 Finally, the spectral profile of the surface emission band was nearly invariant for the different dispersions containing core-only CdSe QDs (inset to Fig. 2). The lack of shifting or narrowing of this band is consistent with the possibility of a single surface electronic state, or a very narrow distribution, rather than a broad distribution of electron-trap states that might promote ET with varying rate constants and efficiencies and would therefore be quenched to varying degrees.

Time-resolved emission measurements. 
To investigate the dynamics and efficiency of excited-state ET, TRPL measurements were carried out on mixed dispersions using TCSPC. Decay traces were fitted to the following equation using a multi-exponential reconvolution method: (1)where t is time, I(t) is intensity, Ai is amplitude of the ith component, τi is lifetime of the ith component and IRF(t′) is the instrument response function. The goodness of fit was evaluated by the distribution of residuals (differences between data and fit) around zero and by chi-square values. Chi-square values of 0.95–1.40 were considered acceptable. An additional exponential component was added if it resulted in significant improvement in chi-square values and the plots of residual as a function of time. Although a long-pass filter was placed in the emission channel to minimize light scattering, some scattering was still measured in all decay traces. The effect of scattered light was taken into account while fitting decay traces. Single, double and triple-exponential reconvolution fits, along with corresponding residuals and chi-square values, for band-edge and surface emission from all samples are in Fig. S3 of ESI.† For all samples containing CdSe core-only QDs, triexponential reconvolution yielded the highest-quality fits for both band-edge and surface emission. Triexponential decay kinetics formally implies the existence of three populations of fluorophores, each with single-exponential decay kinetics. Multiexponential decay kinetics are common for dispersions of cadmium chalcogenide QDs, with inherent heterogeneities in size and surface chemistry, and have been attributed to decay through multiple states.24,29,53–55 Our values of Ai and τi from fits to representative emission decay traces within the band-edge and surface emission bands are compiled in Table S3 in ESI† for dispersions containing core-only CdSe QDs. Intensity-weighted average lifetimes (〈τ〉) were calculated as follows:24,43,56–58 (2)
Decay traces were obtained at different wavelengths throughout the band-edge and surface emission bands. Representative decay traces and fits are shown in Fig. 3 for band-edge emission (513 nm) and surface emission (622 nm) from core-only CdSe QDs alone and from each of the mixed dispersions containing core-only CdSe QDs. Values of 〈τ〉 from decay traces at the band-edge emission maximum and at 622 nm, within the surface emission band, are in Table 1. Values of 〈τ〉 for wavelengths throughout the band-edge and surface emission bands are compiled in Tables S4 and S5 in ESI.† Values of 〈τ〉 at 513 nm (at the band-edge emission maximum) and at 722 nm (at slightly higher energy than the surface emission maximum) for free core-only CdSe QDs were (26.5 ± 0.4) ns and (50 ± 3) ns, respectively (Tables S4 and S5, ESI†). Values of 〈τ〉 varied by less than 12% across the band-edge emission band, whereas 〈τ〉 within the surface emission band ranged from approximately 43 ns to approximately 61 ns and varied non-monotonically with wavelength. For QD/MPA dispersions, the value of 〈τ〉 at the band-edge emission maximum of 513 nm was (26.8 ± 0.8) ns (Table S4, ESI†). Thus, quenching of band-edge emission upon addition of MPA to core-only CdSe QDs was either static or non-time resolvable (within the laser pulse). The value of 〈τ〉 at 513 nm for QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions was (22.2 ± 0.9) ns (Table S4, ESI†). The decrease of 〈τ〉, which arose from an increase of A2 and decreases of τ2 and τ3 (Table S3, ESI†), indicates a slight acceleration of excited-state decay upon incorporation of the core-only CdSe QDs into assemblies in the absence of ET.24 The value of 〈τ〉 at 513 nm for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions was (4.7 ± 0.4) ns. The approximately five-fold decrease of 〈τ〉 was caused primarily by (1) an increase of A1, the preexponential factor corresponding to the fastest component of decay, by approximately 30%, (2) decreases of A2 and A3, indicating decreased contributions of the slower components of decay, and (3) an approximately three-fold decrease of τ3, the slowest lifetime (Table S3, ESI†). The decrease of 〈τ〉 confirms the presence of an additional excited-state deactivation pathway for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions, which we attribute to ET from excitonic states of photoexcited CdSe QDs to TiO2 NPs. This ET-induced dynamic quenching is consistent with the enhanced quenching of steady-state band-edge emission (Fig. 2).

Similar results were obtained for surface emission from core-only CdSe QDs (Fig. 3b). Values of 〈τ〉 at 622 nm (within the surface emission band) for dispersed QDs alone, QD/MPA dispersions, QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions, and QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions were (48 ± 2) ns, (45 ± 3) ns, (34 ± 2) ns, and (10 ± 2) ns, respectively (Table S5, ESI†). The significantly decreased value of 〈τ〉 for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions relative to QD–MPA–ZrO2, which arose primarily from an increase of A1 and 0.5-to-2.5-fold decreases of the three lifetimes (Table S3, ESI†), is indicative of ET from surface states of CdSe QDs to TiO2 NPs, consistent with the enhanced quenching of steady-state surface emission (Fig. 2).


Mechanism, dynamics, and efficiency of ET. 
The measured additional component of dynamic quenching of both band-edge and surface emission from CdSe–MPA–TiO2 dispersions relative to CdSe–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions provides compelling evidence that electrons were transferred from both excitonic and surface states of the QDs to TiO2. Thus, the data provide new insight into the mechanisms of excited-state interfacial ET within QD-containing heterostructures. Dynamics of ET were extracted from time-resolved emission data. Rate constants of ET from excitonic or surface states of QDs to TiO2 NPs were estimated as follows, assuming that ET is the only additional deactivation pathway in QD–MPA–TiO2 assemblies as compared to QD–MPA–ZrO2 assemblies and that the rate constants for all other competing excited-state deactivation processes are identical in QD–MPA–TiO2 and QD–MPA–ZrO2 assemblies:21,22,29,43 (3)Eqn (3) is derived in Appendix S2 in ESI.† Any differences in the rate constants of competing deactivation processes, upon substitution of TiO2 for ZrO2, would introduce error into our estimation of ket. Importantly, the intensity of surface emission in TRPL decay traces reached the maximum within the instrument response (Fig. 3b), indicating that photogenerated electrons had already equilibrated into a distribution of excitonic and surface states. Therefore, ET from excitonic states did not affect measured dynamics of surface emission decay, enabling the use of eqn (3) to estimate rate constants of ET from surface states. Values of ket extracted from measured TRPL decay traces for dispersions containing core-only CdSe QDs are summarized in Table 1, Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†).
Dynamics of ET from excitonic states of core-only CdSe QDs to TiO2 NPs varied with emission wavelength. Values of ket decreased by approximately two-fold from (2.5 ± 0.8) × 108 s−1 at 487 nm, near the high-energy threshold of band-edge emission, to (1.1 ± 0.3) × 108 s−1 at 538 nm, near the low-energy tail of band-edge emission (Table S4, ESI†). This effect may have arisen from differences in the driving force for ET, assuming that variation of the size of QDs and the energies of their excitonic states contributed in part to the breadth of the band-edge emission band, and/or from differences in the electronic coupling between various states at or near the conduction band edge of the QDs and acceptor states of TiO2. In contrast, values of ket for ET from surface states varied to a lesser extent and non-monotonically with emission wavelength (Table S5, ESI†).
ET from excitonic states of core-only CdSe QDs to TiO2 was 2-to-3-fold faster than ET from surface states. This difference in ket may have arisen from differences in the driving force of ET. Because excitonic states are at more negative potentials (higher energies) than surface states, the driving force is greater for ET from excitonic states than from surface states of QDs. Another possibility is that weaker electronic coupling between surface states of QDs and acceptor states of TiO2 may have resulted in slower ET. Regardless of the mechanism, the irreversible dissipation of potential energy upon relaxation of electrons into surface states of QDs is generally undesirable, as it may influence both ET dynamics and the reducing potential of charge carriers for a range of light-initiated redox processes. Thus, a challenge is to extract electrons from QDs before they are trapped in surface states.
Efficiencies of ET (ηet) are ultimately more important than rate constants and can dictate the performance of QD-based photovoltaic devices and photocatalysts. To be efficient, ET must occur faster than competing electron–hole recombination processes. For photoinduced ET from QDs to TiO2 NPs, ηet can be extracted from measured TRPL decay traces and corresponding fits for QD–MPA–TiO2 and QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions:59 (4)Eqn (4) is derived in Appendix S2 in ESI.†
We calculated ηet as a function of emission wavelength throughout the band-edge and surface emission bands. Results are summarized in Table 1, Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†). Values of ηet calculated from TRPL decay traces within the band-edge emission band ranged from approximately 82% to 71% and decreased with increasing emission wavelength. The decrease of ηet was associated with the two-fold decrease of ket with increasing wavelength of band-edge emission; however, the decrease of ηet was mitigated by the increase of excited-state lifetime with wavelength of band-edge emission, as evidenced by the measured increase of 〈τ〉 with wavelength for QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions (Table S4, ESI†). Values of ηet calculated from TRPL decay traces within the surface emission band ranged from approximately 64% to 76% and did not vary systematically with emission wavelength (Table S5, ESI†).
In summary, our results and analysis reveal that electrons were transferred to TiO2 from both excitonic and surface states of core-only CdSe QDs. The involvement of surface states in ET is of fundamental interest and has potential implications for a range of QD-based photocatalyst and solar-cell architectures. Our measurements reveal that ET to TiO2 was most efficient from the highest-energy band-edge or excitonic states of the QDs and of similar efficiency from lower-energy excitonic states and throughout the distribution of surface states. The slight increase of ηet from the highest-energy excitonic states (at emission wavelengths less than 500 nm) is consistent with the higher driving force for ET and the measured values of ket, which were greatest at these short wavelengths. Increases of excited-state lifetime at longer wavelengths within the band-edge emission band and into the surface emission band largely compensated for the decrease of ket, such that ηet varied only minimally. Relaxation of electrons into surface states prior to their extraction from QDs is generally undesirable, as it results in irreversible dissipation of potential energy of charge carriers and corresponding decreases of the driving force of ET, ket, and ηet. However, trapping of electrons in surface states impacted the efficiency of ET to TiO2 only minimally due to the aforementioned interplay between ket and excited-state lifetime in determining ηet.

Electron transfer from core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs

Electronic properties of the core/shell QDs. 
Trapping of charge carriers can be avoided by using type-I core/shell QDs.60,61 To assess dynamics and efficiencies of ET from core/shell QDs to TiO2, in the absence of trapping, we used commercially-available core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs in similar spectroscopic studies as for core-only CdSe QDs. The oleylamine-capped core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs exhibited a broad first excitonic absorption band centered at ∼520 nm (Fig. 4). The breadth of the absorption band indicated some leakage of exciton wave function into the ZnS shell.61 The optical band gap of the CdSe core in core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs was estimated to be 2.26 eV (Fig. S1, ESI†). Thus, the band gap of the CdSe core of the core/shell QDs was approximately 0.13 eV less than that of the core-only CdSe QDs, indicating that the driving force for ET to TiO2 was lower (by ≤0.13 eV) for the core/shell QDs. The core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs were reported by the vendor to consist of CdSe cores with diameter of 2.5 nm coated with 3 monolayers (MLs) of ZnS shell. Assuming the thickness of 1 mL of ZnS to be 0.31 nm,61 on the basis of the wurtzite structure of ZnS, the diameter of the core/shell QDs was estimated to be 4.4 nm. Emission spectra of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs consisted predominantly of band-edge emission centered at ∼540 nm with FWHM of ∼43 nm (1400 cm−1) (Fig. 4). The broader band-edge emission of the core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs, relative to the core-only CdSe QDs, is indicative of a larger distribution of particle sizes. The presence of a ZnS shell may also have broadened the band-edge emission.61 The absence of significant surface emission indicates that surface states were passivated by the ZnS shell.61

Steady-state emission quenching. 
All samples containing core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs, MPA, and/or metal oxide NPs were equilibrated for 2.5 h before spectroscopic measurements. The quantum yield of emission from dispersions of free CdSe/ZnS QDs decreased by 25–35% during this equilibration period, probably due to desorption of oleylamine capping ligands from the surface of QDs into the EtOH/toluene mixed solvent. Interestingly, the addition of MPA resulted in significant enhancement of emission from core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs (Fig. 5), in contrast to the quenching of emission from core-only CdSe QDs upon exposure to MPA (Fig. 2). The quantum yield of emission from CdSe/ZnS QDs within QD/MPA dispersions was unchanged during the equilibration period of 2.5 h (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The wide-band-gap ZnS shell apparently effectively confined photogenerated holes within the CdSe core, preventing their transfer to MPA. Therefore, no static or non-time-resolvable quenching of emission of CdSe/ZnS QDs was observed. The elimination of hole-transfer quenching by MPA is beneficial from the standpoint of photoinduced ET within QD–MPA–TiO2 assemblies. The transfer of holes to MPA decreases the oxidizing potential of the holes, reduces the average separation between electrons (in TiO2) and holes (on MPA rather than in the QD) in the charge-separated state, and additionally has the potential to oxidatively degrade MPA. Thiolated ligands have been shown to replace amine-bearing ligands from the surfaces of CdSe and CdSe/ZnS QDs.52,62,63 The observed enhancement of steady-state emission from CdSe/ZnS QDs upon exposure to MPA (Fig. 5) is consistent with a mechanism in which MPA displaces oleylamine from the surface of the QDs and passivates the surface more effectively. Due to the increased quantum yield of emission, we were able to use a higher concentration of MPA (1.5 mM) in experiments involving core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs than in those involving core-only CdSe QDs.

TiO2 NPs quenched emission from MPA-capped CdSe/ZnS QDs to a much greater extent than did ZrO2 NPs (Fig. 5 and Fig. S2c, ESI†). Values of %Q, relative to QD/MPA dispersions, were ∼90% for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions and ∼35% for QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions. The greater quenching of emission by TiO2 than ZrO2 provides evidence that photoexcited CdSe/ZnS QDs transferred electrons to TiO2.


Time-resolved emission measurements. 
TRPL data were acquired from 500 to 575 nm, throughout the band-edge emission band of the core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs, for dispersions of free QDs, QD/MPA dispersions, and QD–MPA–TiO2 and QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions. TRPL decay traces were fitted using multi-exponential reconvolution (eqn (1)). The decay traces were modeled most accurately by triexponential fits with the exception of the decay traces corresponding to emission at 508 and 520 nm from QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions, for which biexponential reconvolution gave the best fits. Representative decay traces and fits for emission at 537 nm, near the band-edge maximum, are shown in Fig. 6. Values of 〈τ〉 are compiled in Table 1 (at the band-edge emission maximum) and Table S6 in the ESI† (at wavelengths throughout the band-edge emission band). Representative values of Ai and τi for the different dispersions containing core/shell QDs are in Table S7 in the ESI.† The enhancement of steady-state emission upon addition of MPA to core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs (Fig. 5) manifests as an increase of the emission lifetime in TRPL data (Fig. 6). Values of 〈τ〉 from decay traces at 537 nm increased from (13.3 ± 0.1) ns for dispersions of free CdSe/ZnS QDs to (18.0 ± 0.3) ns for QD/MPA dispersions (Table S6, ESI†). Values of 〈τ〉 for emission at 537 nm for QD–MPA–TiO2 and QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions were (4.2 ± 0.2) ns and (15.1 ± 0.2) ns, respectively (Table 1). The lower value of 〈τ〉 for QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions was caused primarily by a nearly 3-fold increase of A1, the preexponential factor for the fastest component of decay, and 2-to-2.5-fold decreases of the three lifetimes (Table S7, ESI†). The significant additional dynamic quenching in QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions, relative to QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions, confirms the presence of an additional excited-state deactivation pathway, which we attribute to ET from CdSe/ZnS QDs to TiO2 NPs.

Dynamics and efficiency of ET. 
Values of ket and ηet were calculated, using eqn (3) and (4), from measured values of 〈τ〉 for wavelengths throughout the band-edge emission band and are compiled in Table S6 (ESI†). Values of ket ranged from (3.3 ± 0.4) × 108 s−1 at 500 nm to (1.1 ± 0.1) × 108 s−1 at 575 nm. Because 〈τ〉 of QD–MPA–ZrO2 dispersions was essentially independent of emission wavelength (Table S6, ESI†), the decrease of ket with increasing wavelength gave rise to a corresponding decrease of ηet. Calculated values of ηet decreased from (85 ± 2)% at 500 nm to (66 ± 3)% at 575 nm (Table S6, ESI†). The decreases of both ket and ηet with increasing wavelength within the band-edge emission band are similar to those observed for core-only CdSe QDs (Table S4, ESI†) and are logically attributed to variations of the driving force of ET and/or the interfacial electronic coupling.

ET from core-only vs. core/shell QDs
For the QD–MPA–TiO2 assemblies that were the subject of this study, the measured values of ket and ηet for ET from excitonic states were nearly identical (Table 1, Tables S4 and S6, ESI†), despite the presence of the ZnS shell as an energetic and spatial barrier to ET in the case of the core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs. This result is intriguing and stands in contrast to previous reports that rate constants of charge transfer from QDs to molecular and nanoparticulate acceptors decreased with the thickness of the shell.31,59,64–66 We speculate that the apparent insensitivity of ket and ηet to the presence of the ZnS shell in our measurements arose from differences in the amount of MPA ligands adsorbed to QDs and the extent of cross-linking to TiO2 NPs. Several factors may have contributed to these differences. First, the commercial core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs were capped initially by oleylamine, which was more labile than the native capping ligands of the nominally TOPO-capped core-only CdSe QDs, as evidenced by the initial decrease of emission from the core/shell QDs as they equilibrated with surrounding solvent. The lability of oleylamine probably facilitated the attachment of MPA to the surface. Second, the surface area of the core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs was approximately six-fold greater than that of the core-only CdSe QDs, assuming spherical particles, potentially enabling significantly higher saturation loadings of MPA on the core/shell QDs. Finally, the concentration of MPA in core/shell CdSe/ZnS QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions was 15-fold greater than in core-only CdSe QD–MPA–TiO2 dispersions, as described above. Therefore, at equilibrium, the core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs were probably cross-linked to TiO2 NPs to a greater extent than were the core-only CdSe QDs, potentially increasing the fraction of QDs interfaced with TiO2, the stability and persistence of such interactions, and the average interfacial electronic coupling. These effects would lead to an increase in the value of ket extracted from TRPL decay traces. Alivisatos and coworkers recently reported a similar effect.67 They found that the presence of a CdS shell as charge-transfer barrier in type-I core/shell CdSe/CdS QDs coupled to adsorbed hole-accepting ferrocene derivatives could be compensated for by increasing the average number of adsorbed acceptors on the significantly higher surface area of core/shell CdSe/CdS QDs as compared to core-only CdSe QDs.67
Conclusions
TRPL measurements have revealed new insight into the mechanisms and time scales of ET from photoexcited core-only CdSe and core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs to molecularly-tethered TiO2 NPs. Dynamic quenching of both band-edge and surface emission clearly indicates that electrons were transferred from both excitonic and surface states of core-only CdSe QDs to TiO2 with ket of 107–108 s−1. Efficiencies of ET, which are more important than rate constants from the standpoint of converting incident irradiance into electrical power or chemical potential, were ∼66–85% for ET from excitonic states and ∼64–76% for ET from surface states. Thus, relaxation of electrons into surface states of core-only CdSe QDs did not greatly affect the efficiency of ET to TiO2. The 2-to-3-fold increase of ket for ET from excitonic states relative to ET from surface states probably arose from the increased driving force and/or differences in electronic coupling. More generally, trapping of electrons prior to their extraction from QDs is potentially undesirable, as it reduces the potential energy of the electrons.
Direct comparisons between the dynamics of ET from core-only CdSe QDs and core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs are complicated by differences in their sizes, band gaps, and driving forces for ET to TiO2, as well as the extent of ligand-exchange and linker-assisted attachment to TiO2. Nonetheless, our results reveal that type-I core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs possess several advantages relative to core-only CdSe QDs as sensitizers of TiO2. First, the ZnS shell minimized the trapping of electrons, as is well-established60,61 and evidenced by the absence of surface emission (Fig. 5). Second, the ZnS shell minimized the transfer of photogenerated holes to MPA, as evidenced by the absence of quenching of emission upon reaction of the QDs with MPA (Fig. 5, 6 and Table S6, ESI†). Third, the values of ket (∼108 s−1) and ηet (∼66–85%) for ET from excitonic states of core/shell QDs were nearly identical to those for ET from excitonic states of core-only QDs under our conditions. The presence of the ZnS shell as tunneling barrier to ET may have been offset by an increase in the number of linkages between the QDs and TiO2, owing to their greater size and the increased surface loading of MPA. Our results provide mechanistic insight into the superior performance of Type-I core/shell QDs as excited-state electron donors.
