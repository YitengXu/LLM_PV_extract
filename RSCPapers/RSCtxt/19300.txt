    , Accepted 24th April 2018First published on 25th April 2018AbstractBuckminster fullerene (C60) based hybrid metal oxide materials are receiving considerable attention because of their excellent fundamental and applied aspects, like semiconducting, electron transfer, luminescent behaviors, etc. and this work briefly discusses the successful fabrication of C60 decorated ZnO tetrapod materials and their detailed structure–property relationships including device sensing applications. The electron microscopy investigations indicate that a quite dense surface coverage of ZnO tetrapods with C60 clusters is achieved. The spectroscopy studies confirmed the identification of the C60 vibrational modes and the C60 induced changes in the absorption and luminescence properties of the ZnO tetrapods. An increased C60 concentration on ZnO results in steeper ZnO bandgap absorption followed by well-defined free exciton and 3.31 eV line emissions. As expected, higher amounts of C60 increase the intensity of C60-related visible absorption bands. Pumping the samples with photons with an energy corresponding to these absorption band maxima leads to additional emission from ZnO showing an effective charge transfer phenomenon from C60 to the ZnO host. The density of states model obtained from DFT studies for pure and C60 coated ZnO surfaces confirms the experimental observations. The fabricated C60–ZnO hybrid tetrapod based micro- and nanodevices showed interesting ethanol gas sensing characteristics.
Introduction
Since its discovery, buckminsterfullerene (C60), among all the low dimensional carbon allotropes, has always introduced new fundamental and applied research paradigms in various disciplines due to its unique physical and chemical properties.1 Together with other fullerenes (such as C70, C84etc.), buckyballs belong to the semiconductor family with a bandgap energy from 1.5 to 1.98 eV, which makes them attractive for optical and electrical applications.2 Taking into account their excellent charge extraction and accommodation capabilities,3 diverse applications in photovoltaics,1b photocatalytic water purification,4 as a photocorrosion protective layer,5 energy6 or even as an antibacterial barrier,7 have been proposed. Generally, in most of the applications, fullerenes were immersed in a hybrid layer in the form of fullerene agglomerates. In this strategy, fullerenes were involved as the bulk phase, allowing only a small fraction of individual fullerene molecules to be accessible for interaction with the other phases/materials. Surface accessibility is the most important criterion towards many applications. To achieve a higher surface accessibility compared to conventional methods, advanced synthesis strategies in adequate hierarchical forms need to be developed. In this context, three-dimensional (3D) architectured substrates play an important role as they can support nanocrystals (or several monolayers) of fullerenes on their surface, thereby increasing the overall accessibility. An appropriate highly porous and non-conductive 3D cellular material in which fullerenes can be homogenously decorated on the surface would provide new fundamental research scopes in the direction of the fundamental structure–property relationship and can also lead to a large number of advanced applications because of high surface accessibility and simplicity of use.
Nanoarchitectured porous materials in the 3D form are the most adequate candidates for such desired applications, boosting their research focus in the last couple of years. Various physical, chemical, and biologically inspired and other innovative strategies have been adopted for their fabrication. However, issues like versatile fabrication, cost effective process, upscalability, etc., have been the main concerns for the advanced materials community. Structural aspects of nanomaterials could play a very important role in this context, since a macroscopic porous network material can be easily built out of complex shaped nanostructures, for example from nanoseaurchins, tetrapods, multipods, etc., in a cost-effective way which could be rather efficient in contrast to complex multistep processes or clean room technologies.8 Because of its unique crystalline nature, zinc oxide (ZnO) is a remarkable candidate for complex nanostructuring and the usually flame based process offers the possibility of a large scale growth of nano- and micro-tetrapods.8a,b These tetrapods are formed with four interconnected arms via a central core, facilitating the easy accessibility of 1D nanoscale features in a complex 3D shape and offering large technological opportunities.8b,9 Additionally, these zinc oxide tetrapods can be used as building blocks for synthesizing highly porous 3D interconnected networks, which can be used as solid backbones for fabricating hybrid materials or as sacrificial templates10 for developing a new class of porous 3D materials.8a,b,11
With n-type conductivity, ZnO is one of the most active materials from the II–VI metal oxide semiconductor family because of its hexagonal-wurtzite crystal structure, featuring a high polarity along the c-axis, supported versatile growth nature and unique physical (e.g. optical and electrical) properties.1e,12 The complex shapes additionally facilitate ZnO nanomaterials with many structural aspects, thereby making tetrapods from ZnO a very relevant nanomaterial candidate for various technological applications.8b In order to enhance or even tune their properties, the ZnO nanostructures need to be hybridized with other nanostructured materials. For the successful fabrication of any hybrid materials, two necessary requirements should be fulfilled, (i) structural appropriateness of the underneath backbone, and (ii) desired properties of the nanostructures utilized for hybridization. Three dimensional networks consisting of interconnected ZnO tetrapods, which can be synthesized in large amounts by the flame transport synthesis, are a very adequate choice as the template.11 Owing to the three dimensional shape of the tetrapodal microparticles, highly porous networks can be fabricated. Due to the super-hydrophilic properties of such templates and the large free volume, these networks can be homogenously coated using any kind of nanoparticle dispersion.11 Fullerene C60 exhibits remarkable properties such as strong UV absorption, excellent electron accepting, charge transfer, etc.1e when used in the form of a very thin coating. Therefore, the characteristic features of individual C60 molecules are very useful for the desired functionalities. Both being very unique nanomaterials in terms of physical properties, accordingly we aimed to synthesize a 3D hybrid material in the form of C60 coated ZnO tetrapods and investigate its optical, electronic, and sensing properties in detail.
Actually, ZnO and C60 are very complementary, because they can significantly enhance each other's functionalities, thus making the hybrid system a very interesting candidate in terms of technological relevance.13 For example, ZnO is a very important gas sensing material and its sensitivity as well as selectivity can be further improved by decorating the ZnO surface with carbon nanostructures.12c,14 On the other hand, ZnO-fullerene based hybrid structures have shown increased electron mobility leading to an enhanced efficiency of solar cells.1b Several hybrid material systems based on carbon–ZnO have been synthesized towards different applications14a,15 but to the best of our knowledge, the effect of fullerene layers on the ZnO surface has been less explored, and mainly with studies of its properties at room temperature (RT).16 A temperature dependent investigation might reveal more about the mutual effects of ZnO and C60 with respect to each other's properties, for example, electron transfer behaviors,1a optical responses and electrical conductivity changes, etc.
ZnO inherits n-type electrical conductivity due to unavoidable defects which can be easily enhanced by doping with group III elements.17 For optoelectronics applications, e.g., LEDs, a p–n junction is required which provides the necessity to make ZnO p-type as well. But achieving p-type conductivity in ZnO is really difficult and has been a topic of discussion since ever.18 Although a successful p-doping of ZnO utilizing N,19 As or P sources has been reported, its stability and reproducibility are still an open topic. In general, p-type conductivity is achieved by doping with acceptor elements and this requirement is nicely fulfilled by fullerene molecules due to their strong charge ejecting properties.20 Inspired by the unique properties of ZnO material and C60, we have fabricated a C60–ZnO tetrapod based hybrid 3D porous networked material, where fullerene molecules are strongly attached to the surface of nano-microscale arms of ZnO tetrapods by using a simple infiltration technique.11 ZnO itself exhibits exceptional optical properties and the addition of C60 introduces additional states within the bandgap, which promotes further advanced applications. In the present work, we successfully varied the amount of C60 on ZnO tetrapods and investigated the samples’ morphological, structural and optical properties in detail, under various conditions. The C60 decorated ZnO samples have also been explored via low temperature photoluminescence (PL) studies, which indicate electron transfer processes from C60 to ZnO. The computational modeling for the density of states of the C60–ZnO hybrid system also supports the experimental results and preliminary gas sensing studies hinted its potential towards technological applications, showing excellent ethanol sensing properties. Since ethanol is one of the main products of alcoholic fermentation in winemaking processes,21 various studies have been performed to develop cost-effective ethanol sensors for continuous monitoring of the ethanol concentration during the wine production.22
Motivated by the abovementioned features, we synthesized hybrid composites using flame based ZnO tetrapods covered with different C60 floodings in a simple strategy.11 The hybrid composites were fully characterized by morphological, structural, optical and electrical techniques. Optical spectroscopy investigations highlighted the effect of the C60 addition on the absorption and luminescence properties of ZnO. Noticeable differences were observed in the near band edge (NBE) region with the amount of the C60 floodings, namely an increase in the relative intensity of the free exciton (FX) and 3.31 eV emission line. Furthermore, exciting the composite samples at the maximum of the C60 absorption band led to the observation of the ZnO green luminescence, evidencing the occurrence of charge transfer processes. Further rationalization of the interaction of C60 with ZnO and the related charge transfer process was also supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Experimental
ZnO network synthesis
For the scaffold material for deposition of fullerenes a newly developed flame transport synthesis8a,23 was further modified. For this purpose a conventional muffle furnace,8a with a metal crucible, is preheated up to 950 °C, and a nitrogen rich atmosphere is achieved using a N2 gas flow of 41 L h−1. After that, a simple Zn wire (of a total weight of 10–15 g, with a purity of approx. 99.95%) was inserted and placed into the metal crucible. After the temperature stabilization, pressured air was let into the furnace leading to a rapid Zn oxidation and thus to the formation of a large amount of ZnO 3D structures. In the next step, 3D ZnO pellets were formed out of the produced ZnO powder by compressing and sintering it at 1150 °C for 5 hours (Fig. 1a and S1a†).

Fullerene solution preparation
A water-based solution of fullerene powder (with 99.5% purity purchased at Sigma Aldrich) was prepared based on the method proposed,24 where toluene was taken as a solvent (C60 exhibits excellent solubility in toluene).25 First fullerene powder was diluted into toluene and then an identical amount (fullerene + toluene) of water was added into the solution and sonicated for several hours (typically 4 to 5 hours) until all the toluene was evaporated. Mixing the C60 in the toluene, with a slightly lower concentration (2.0 mg ml−1) than the maximum reported solvable concentration (3.8 mg ml−1),24 and dispersing it with an ultrasonic tip, resulted in a dark purple solution with no visible precipitation of fullerenes. Additionally, the beaker with C60–toluene solution was placed into the ultrasonic bath and the same amount of distilled water was rapidly added to the pristine solution. During the preparation of the solution with toluene no visible C60 precipitates were observed, however when the distilled water was added to the mixture and the sonication process started, two clear phases were visible: a dark purple phase (standing for toluene + C60) and a white phase (representing the possible hydrogenation of C6026). After several hours when the toluene was evaporated, the color of the solution changed to a yellowish-brown5,27 and a water based solution of fullerenes was successfully produced.
Drop-coating of the ZnO network
The so prepared C60 solution was subsequently drop–cast onto fresh sintered pellets of ZnO that were kept on a hot plate (∼80 °C), as shown in Fig. 1b. The moderate density of the pellets was chosen (0.3 g cm−3) to guarantee a high porosity of the template for the optimal accessibility of the tetrapod surface for the C60 molecules. For the small size of the cylindrical pellets (3 mm in thickness and 6 mm in diameter), 50 μL of the solution was taken per round. A hot plate maintaining a temperature of 65 °C was utilized to accelerate the evaporation process. Intervals of 1.5 hours were kept between the rounds to let the water and the remaining solvents present in the solution evaporate (ESI Video, V1†). The total number of coating cycles was varied from 5–60, thus resulting in the total amount of fullerenes on the ZnO surface in the range of 0.5–6 mg, respectively. In the final step the C60 coated ZnO templates were dried in a vacuum furnace (at 65 °C, 100 mbar, for at least 8 hours). Even though some drop–casting procedures took several weeks, the solution remained unchanged and formed no visible precipitates. Fresh sintered ZnO pellets revealed extreme hydrophilic properties, allowing a fast penetration of the droplet of the water solution of C60, while the pellets that were kept for several weeks in the room with the typical humidity and the absence of UV light turned out to be hydrophobic. Performing a heating treatment of these templates at 600 °C in the ambient atmosphere for 30 min solves the problem of hydrophobicity.
Characterization
The produced ZnO/C60 composites were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), Raman spectroscopy, absorption, photoluminescence, PL-excitation (PLE) and electrical measurements. SEM analysis was performed in a Zeiss Supra 55 V with a working voltage of 15 kV and a working current of 10 μA. For TEM characterization a Tecnai F30 STwin was used (with FEG, accelerating voltage of 300 kV, Cs = 1.2 and an EDAX EDX detector). A small amount of the hybrid network, consisting mostly of single tetrapods or even of only the tetrapod part, was placed on a Cu grid with a carbon mesh sample holder. In order to evaluate the chemical and structural composition of the ZnO/C60 composites, RT Raman spectra were obtained by using a alpha300 RA, WITec system, with a triple grating spectrometer (600 gr mm−1) and a CCD detector. The measurements were performed in a backscattering geometry using the 532.2 nm line of a cw laser. The spot size of the laser on the sample was ∼1.41 μm, the maximum power at the sample was ∼52 mW and the entire scattered beam was collected by an optical fiber with a diameter of 50 μm. The spectra were taken with a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1. Additional measurements were performed in a Jobin Yvon HR800 spectrometer, using the 442 nm wavelength radiation from a cw He–Cd laser, a ×100 magnification lens and a 1800 gr mm−1 diffraction grating.
The RT samples absorption was recorded in a UV/Vis JASCO V-560 system equipped with deuterium and halogen lamps and a ISV-469 integrated sphere. Steady state PL spectroscopy was performed as a function of temperature (from 10 K to RT) using a cold finger He cryostat. The 325 nm line of a cw He–Cd laser (power density I0 < 0.6 W cm−2) was used as the excitation source, corresponding to an energy of ∼3.8 eV. The luminescence radiation was dispersed using a Spex 1704 monochromator (1 m, 1200 gr mm−1), then it was detected with a cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier. All the measurements were conducted using a neutral density ND1 filter to avoid damaging the samples by overheating with the UV radiation. The RT PLE was assessed in a Fluorolog-3 Horiba Scientific set-up with a double additive grating Gemini 180 monochromator (1200 gr mm−1 and 2 × 180 mm) in the excitation and a triple grating iHR550 spectrometer in the emission (1200 gr mm−1 and 550 mm). As excitation source a 450 W Xe lamp was used. The PLE has been measured by setting the monochromator in the maxima of the optically active defects and the excitation has been scanned to higher energies. Additionally, the same Fluorolog-3 system was used to perform energy dependent RT PL measurements. Namely, the RT PL of the ZnO/C60 was evaluated by exciting the samples with below ZnO bandgap energy, corresponding to the blue absorption maxima reached after the functionalization with C60.

I–V measurements were performed using a self-designed setup consisting of a PC-controlled micromanipulator with Cu/Au sputtered contacts, Keithley that is controlled through a Labview program allowing to measure the current flowing through the template at the set intervals in the studied voltage ranges. (Due to the still high template resistance 2-wire measurements were performed.) Cylindrical templates of the same ZnO density with and without C60 coating were analyzed. Several types of electrical contacts deposited at both ends of a cylindrical template were tested: adhesive silver paste with its solvent being evaporated, or sputtered gold contacts, or sputtered Ni–Au contacts.
Device preparation and gas sensing measurements
The devices based on ZnO/C60 were fabricated using the same approach reported in previous studies,28 while devices based on individual hybrid microstructures were fabricated in a FIB/SEM system using the procedure reported by Lupan et al.28 Hybrid individual microstructures were contacted with a Pt complex to Au/Cr pads (Fig. S8a†). UV measurements were performed at RT in the dark and in air (relative humidity ∼ 30%) and upon UV illumination at λ = 365 nm (∼3.4 eV) and an intensity of ∼10 mW cm−2, as was reported earlier.8b In the case of devices based on networks, gas sensing measurements were performed in the range of 20–400 °C, in order to determine the optimal operating temperature (OPT). For the devices based on individual structures, the measurements were only performed at RT. More details on gas sensing measurements were presented in our recent work.28 The gas response (S) was defined as,  where Rgas and Rair are the resistance of the sensor under exposure to gas and ambient air, respectively.
DFT computational modeling
Under the framework of density functional theory (DFT)29 computational modeling is performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).30 The projector-augmented-wave (PAW)31 method as implemented in VASP is used with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof32 (PBE) variant of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as the exchange correlation functional. A plane-wave cutoff of 520 eV has been kept for the kinetic energy. We have also included van der Waals correction in the form of Grimme's semi-empirical corrections.32a The hexagonal stable phase of ZnO (space group P63mc) has been considered in our modeling where each Zn atom occupies the tetrahedral void formed by 4 adjacent O atoms and a similar configuration is maintained for O atoms. We have considered a supercell of ZnO to model the surface adsorption of C60 molecules on the oxide. The fullerene molecule is adsorbed on the (0 0 1) surface of ZnO. A space of 30 Å is kept along the c-direction to avoid any spurious interactions of the simulation cell with their periodic images. During structural relaxation, to minimize the computational cost associated with a relatively large supercell, only top one layer of ZnO along with the adsorbed molecules on it is allowed to relax keeping the bottom layers of ZnO fixed. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a k-mesh of within the Monkhorst-Pack33 scheme.
Results and discussion
The fabrication strategy for the C60–ZnO based hybrid composites is presented in Fig. 1(a–d). The micro- and nanoscale tetrapods with pyramidal arms (length in the range of 10 to 50 μm, base and tip diameters ∼10 μm and 500 nm, respectively) as shown in the scanning electron microscopy image in Fig. 1(a) are utilized as a backbone for C60 molecules decoration. The tetrapod based 3D interconnected network tablets with a porosity of ∼92%, which were achieved by post-sintering (favors interconnections), were infiltrated with commercially available C60 in the solution form via a pipette (Fig. 1b and ESI Video, V1†). The high porosity and hydrophilicity in the network allow a homogeneous flow of C60 based solution in the entire network and drying results in an attachment of C60 molecules on the surface of the ZnO tetrapod arms (Fig. 1c). The amount of C60 molecules decorated on ZnO tetrapods depends on the number of infiltrations and the used concentration of the dispersion. The initial ZnO templates are white in color (Fig. 1b), turning into brownish color (Fig. 1d and S1†) after C60 infiltrations (∼50 floodings). The number of floodings is the most important parameter deciding the C60 coverage at ZnO tetrapod arms and, depending on the requirements, from well separated C60 molecules to continuous C60 layers (mono and multiple) on the surface of ZnO tetrapod arms can be easily achieved by the here adopted drop-cast strategy. Typical SEM images corresponding to C60 coated ZnO tetrapods from the hybrid network in Fig. 1d are shown in Fig. 1e, S2 and S3.† The detailed SEM analysis of the coated templates revealed a homogeneous coverage of the ZnO tetrapods and, depending on the number of cycles (ESI Video, V1†), more or less dense distribution of C60 was achieved (Fig. 1f–k, S2 and S3†). However, measuring the smallest particle at the ZnO surface, it is visible that C60 is drawn together forming clusters with sizes varying from 100 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 1g, i, k and S3†).
The crystallinity of the ZnO/C60 was evaluated by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. In particular, transmission electron microscopy studies revealed the presence of fullerite, a crystalline solid C60 modification.34 In bright field mode several clusters attached to ZnO tetrapods have been identified as shown in Fig. 2(a and b). High resolution TEM studies confirmed a highly crystalline arrangement, demonstrated in Fig. 2c. The corresponding fast Fourier transform pattern (Fig. 2d) matches well with a simulated electron diffraction pattern from the cubic C6035 in the [1 0 2] orientation (Fig. 2e). Based on the high resolution images, the interplanar spacing corresponds to 3.23 Å for (4 0 2) (literature value: 3.17 Å (ref. 36)) and 7.89 Å for (1 1 1) (literature value: 8.18 Å (ref. 36)). The deviation for (020) indicates an increased lattice parameter b. Moreover, a tilt in α and γ was observed. Similar to Fig. 2a many fullerite fractions have been identified next to ZnO tetrapods. Basically, C60 molecules were arranged to form spherical clusters with diameters from 50 to 1000 nm (Fig. S3 and S4a†). By a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from the red marked region (Fig. S4b†) it was shown that every cluster is an independent crystalline domain (Fig. S4c†) and every interface between two spheres represents a domain boundary. Thus in the beginning small clusters of C60 molecules start to agglomerate. While continuously growing occasionally clusters merge and form a common boundary.
 Fig. 2  (a) TEM low magnification bright field micrograph of several C60 clusters on top of a ZnO tetrapod surface (appearing black due to the larger thickness compared to the thickness of C60 clusters). (b) TEM bright field image of a single cluster of C60. (c) HRTEM micrograph from the position marked in (b) aligned to [102]. (d) FFT pattern from (c). (e) Simulated ED-pattern from [102] orientation. (f) Raman spectra of reference fullerene powder (pink), reference ZnO network (black) and ZnO network coated with fullerenes. Number of floodings for the analyzed samples was: 5 (cyan), 10 (blue), 20 (green) and 60 (red). For the ZnO network with 60 floodings of C60 on the surface the D peak at 1350 cm−1 becomes sharper and more defined. 
RT Raman spectra of the ZnO/C60 composites are presented in Fig. 2f. Beside the vibrational modes known for the ZnO (black curve), all of the peaks have been identified and correspond to the values reported in the literature for fullerenes.37 For the latter, the strongest peak at 1469 cm−1, the pentagonal pinch mode (PPM) corresponding to a totally symmetric Ag(2) mode,38 is seen in samples having the number of floodings from 5 to 20 (cyan, blue and green curves in Fig. 2f). The samples with 10 floodings (blue curve) show most clearly the presence of the further fullerene peaks Ag(1) at 495 cm−1 and a broader peak at 1565–1581 cm−1 that could be assigned to the Hg(8) mode. An interesting phenomenon is observed for the sample with the much higher counting (60 floodings, red curve), namely the distinct D band peak at 1350 cm−1, well known for the carbon materials indicating the presence of defects. Explanation for that might be the fullerene structures building a layer on top of ZnO and producing edge defects that are Raman active.38
PL and PL excitation measurements were carried out in order to investigate the influence on the optical properties of the 3D ZnO networks by the addition of C60. Fig. 3a depicts the normalized PL spectra of the ZnO/C60 samples (from the UV to the near infrared) obtained at RT. All samples exhibit a dominant green/yellow emission band with maxima slightly shifted between the samples. While for the samples with 10 and 20 floodings the maxima are located at ∼2.23 eV, the samples with the lowest (5) and highest (60) C60 content evidence a high energy shift of the band maximum peak position (∼2.27–2.28 eV). As reported in the literature,17b this PL band is frequently composed by the overlap of different emitting centers, which may have different relative intensities in the analyzed samples, resulting in the shift of the maxima of the overall emission. Even so, if the emission is originated from the same optical center, the ∼50 meV apart could be related to distinct band bending effects on the ZnO electronic structure and ZnO/C60 interface, assuming that the green/yellow band involves effective mass described electronic states. At 14 K (Fig. 3b), spectra are also dominated by the visible band, evidencing a vibrational assisted structure, similar to the so-called structured green band, widely reported in the literature.17b,39 Regarding the NBE recombination that appears in the UV region (inset of Fig. 3b and Fig. S5†), noticeable changes can be observed with increasing C60 content, meaning that distinct interactions between the ZnO surface and C60 molecules occur for the different hybrid systems. In particular, a strong quenching of the NBE is seen in the sample with the lowest (5) flooding. In this case, the NBE seems to be absent when compared with the visible emission, however an ultraviolet/blue band at 3.0 eV was also detected, probably related to disorder-induced defects, as was previously observed in thin films.40 For the samples with higher floodings (10 to 60), a well-defined NBE emission was observed (Fig. 3c and S6†). While the sample with 10 floodings exhibits NBE PL mainly dominated by the Al-donor bound exciton transition, increasing the C60 floodings (20 and 60) promotes changes in the dominant donor bound exciton recombination, accompanied by the observation of the emission at 3.31 eV and its phonon-replicas. This line has been widely discussed in the literature41 and associated with distinct recombination mechanisms, such as structural defect-related transitions41,42 or surface excitonic contribution.43 Recently, this emission was studied in detail by J. Rodrigues et al.44 in ZnO microrods grown by laser assisted flow deposition (LAFD). This line was seen to dominate the low temperature PL spectrum in the UV region, evidencing a spectral shape similar to the one obtained for the ZnO/C60 samples with 20 and 60 floodings. The reported work suggests a strong correlation of the 3.31 eV emission line with the presence of surface states, as identified by the influence of distinct plasma treatments on the recombination line intensity. In fact, the same authors observed an increase in the relative intensity of this line when ZnO tetrapods grown by LAFD were mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs).45 This fact constitutes another indication that the 3.31 eV emission is affected by surface states. When incorporated in the CNT composite, the surface of the ZnO tetrapods was in direct contact with the functionalized CNTs, leading to a higher concentration of electron–hole pairs on the surface of the ZnO 3D structures. The enhancement of the PL intensity in ZnO/carbon composites was previously reported in the literature,15b,c and attributed to the generation of a higher concentration of optically active centers, namely improving surface and excitonic related recombination. A similar phenomenon is likely to be present in the ZnO samples with a higher amount of C60 on its surface and thus the enhancement of the relative intensity of the 3.31 eV emission. It is important to note that the intensity of this line increases with the increase of C60, as in Fig. 3c. Moreover, besides the enhancement of the 3.31 eV emission, also the intensity of FX recombination is seen to increase (inset of Fig. 3c and Fig. S6†), accompanied by a decrease in the relative intensity of Al donor-bound exciton, meaning that with the used conditions an enhancement of free carrier concentration is favored rather than the carriers captured through the Al shallow donor. With the increase of C60 floodings differences in the electronic states band alignments are expected, inducing changes in the preferential recombination paths. Indeed, the offset between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of C60 and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of ZnO defines the barrier for charge transfer between the two materials and was seen to depend on the thickness of the C60 layer covering the ZnO structures.46

(b) Normalized 14 K PL spectra of the same samples under the same excitation conditions. The inset shows an amplification of the UV region. (c) Normalized 14 K PL spectra of the NBE region for the samples with 10, 20 and 60 floodings, evidencing a well-resolved emission. The inset includes high resolution spectra in the FX-D0X region and a comparison with the bulk ZnO emission (dashed line). (d) RT PLE spectra of the ZnO-T-C60 samples with different floodings, monitored at 2.3 eV (visible band maximum). 
These differences are also reflected in the RT PLE spectra (Fig. 3d) when monitored at the visible band maxima. The spectra show that the emission is mainly populated with photons with energy equal to or higher than the ZnO bandgap. Furthermore, it can be also shown that the ZnO bandgap absorption feature becomes slightly narrower as the C60 floodings increase, exhibiting a steeper absorption and a slight shift towards the expected bandgap to pure ZnO. Such behavior indicates a suppression of the effective mass described electronic states in the population pathways of the broad emission, suggesting that a charge transfer from ZnO to C60 cannot be discarded. As shown in Fig. 3d, the band tail observed below the ZnO bandgap is more pronounced for samples with lower C60 floodings.
Comparing these results with the ones observed for the NBE emission, one notes that the absence of this emission in the sample with the lowest C60 floodings is accompanied by a more pronounced effect in the band tail states of the PLE spectra, while steeper absorption results in a well-resolved NBE (Fig. 3c and Fig. S6†). Absorption measurements (Fig. 4a) reveal, besides the ZnO bandgap, additional visible and near infrared absorption bands in the samples with C60 on the surface, where the band with the highest intensity is peaked at 448 nm (∼2.77 eV). The wide absorption region appears when C60 is added to the ZnO tetrapods, with its intensity increasing as the C60 amount increases up to 20 floodings. For comparison, the RT absorption of a C60 sample from ref. 47 is included in Fig. 4a. As can be seen, the most intense absorption band in the visible region (dashed line in Fig. 4a) of the composite samples is not present in the C60 absorption spectrum, suggesting that its origin is likely related to ZnO–C60 interactions. The additional absorption bands are related to the C60 molecules.

The valley at ∼517 nm (∼2.40 eV) corresponds to the blaze of the grating. (c) Schematic representation of the band alignment for ZnO and C60 molecules, based on the spectroscopy results and ref. 3. (d) Relative intensity of the visible band as a function of the temperature for the analyzed samples. 
In order to evaluate the possibility of charge transfer from the C60 molecules to ZnO, PL measurements were carried out exciting the samples at 448 nm (maximum of the mentioned absorption band), using a Xe flash lamp with a delay time close to the pulse lamp width in order to approach the steady-state conditions (Fig. 4b). For comparison purposes a band to band excitation was also performed using the same delay. In both cases a ZnO green band was detected, evidencing that this ZnO emission band can be populated via both excitation processes. The excitation at 448 nm corroborates the hypothesis of charge transfer from the C60 to ZnO. These results are also in line with the behavior observed for the ZnO NBE where an increase in the relative intensity of the FX and the 3.31 eV line was seen to occur with the increase of the amount of C60 in the ZnO surface, meaning that more electrons are being transferred to the ZnO conduction band and surface states, respectively. Fig. 4c shows a schematic representation of the possible band alignment for these materials, evidencing the two described charge transfer mechanisms suggested by the spectroscopic measurements.
In order to gain a better insight into the mechanisms involved in the luminescence process, temperature dependent PL studies were carried out, as can be seen in the ESI (Fig. S7†). Fig. 4d shows the dependence of the integrated green/yellow PL intensity band on the temperature. All the analyzed samples exhibited a similar behavior, with the overall intensity of the visible band decreasing up to 130–150 K followed by an increase in the intensity between these temperatures and 230–260 K and with a subsequent decrease up to RT. These results corroborate the hypothesis of having different optical active centers contributing to the broad visible emission. With increasing temperature, competitive nonradiative mechanisms start to take place, leading to a decrease in the intensity of all the emitting centers present. As the temperature rises, one of the defect states involved in green/yellow emission becomes thermally populated at the expense of another, resulting in an increase of the overall intensity. Finally, at higher temperatures, the nonradiative transitions dominate and the band intensity decreases again. A similar behavior was previously observed for ZnO with Zn2SnO4 and with Bi2O3 hybrid networks synthesized by the same method.39c
Hybrid nanostructures, especially ZnO based, exhibit a very important role towards nanosensing, which also motivated us to investigate their sensing capabilities. Based upon the number of C60 floodings, individual micro- and nanoelectronic devices were fabricated and their detailed electrical sensing characteristics with respect to different volatile gases have been studied. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of devices fabricated using individual zinc oxide tetrapod (ZnO-T) arms coated with C60 (ZnO-T-C60). Three sets of devices were fabricated with relatively different contents of C60 on the surface of the ZnO-T arm: 10 floodings (Fig. 5a, its inset and Fig. S8a†), 20 floodings (Fig. 5b and inset) and 60 floodings (Fig. 5c and inset). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices are presented in Fig. S8b,† showing the formation of asymmetrical double Schottky contacts, due to a higher work function of Pt contacts.48 All individual structures have similar diameters in the range of 1–3 μm from one end to another. The calculated gas response of devices to different vapors of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hydrogen (H2) gas is shown in Fig. 5d. The concentration of VOCs was 100 ppm and of H2 gas was 1000 ppm. Actually, a previous study showed that pristine individual ZnO micro- and nanostructures showed a higher gas response to hydrogen gas (100 ppm),49 with the highest gas response of ∼34% (for pristine ZnO with a diameter of ∼100 nm (ref. 49)). However, in the present case, a higher response to ethanol compared to H2 gas is observed (see Fig. 5d).

(d) The calculated gas response at RT of fabricated devices using individual hybrid structures ZnO-T-C60. The transient gas response at RT of: (e) Device #1; (f) Device #2; (g) Device #3. 
Electrical contacts might lead to a varied sensing response and therefore nanodevices with both types (ohmic and Schottky) of contacts were fabricated and investigated, showing identical electrical/sensing characteristics. Hence, silver paste based ZnO/C60 devices were chosen for the matter of simplicity. In line with the generation of more free carriers with increasing C60 floodings, a notable increase in the conductivity is observed (ESI, Fig. S9a†). Based on the linearity of the I–V curves, it can be assumed that an ohmic contact was achieved for the network templates and the corresponding dynamic UV sensing response is presented in Fig. S9b.† The calculated response (IUV/Idark) is ∼1.6, which is much lower compared to pristine ZnO-T networks reported earlier (>500). This can be explained based on complete covering of the ZnO tetrapod surface with C60, hampering its accessibility for UV light to photogenerate the electron–hole pairs. The same situation was observed in the case of single ZnO-T-C60 structures (not shown here), which suggest that a lower content of fullerene on the surface of ZnO tetrapod arms would be rather preferable for gas sensing applications.
The here fabricated devices based on hybrid networks and individual structures demonstrated interesting gas sensing properties. By increasing the content of C60 the gas response to ethanol vapors is enhanced (taking into account that the diameter of structures is practically similar, Fig. 5). Thus, for Devices #1 (10 floodings), #2 (20 floodings) and #3 (60 floodings) the gas response to ethanol vapors is 4.43%, 6% and 32%, respectively (see Fig. 5d). The dynamic response to VOCs (100 ppm) and H2 (1000 ppm) is shown in Fig. 5e, f and g for Devices #1, #2 and #3, respectively. Due to the operation of devices at RT, the response and recovery time are relatively high. The calculated response and recovery time (defined as the time to reach and recover the 90% of full response) of ethanol vapors are, respectively, 45 s and >350 s for Device #1, 70 s and >350 s for Device #2, 80 s and >15 min for Device #3. Thus, the evident increase in response/recovery times by increasing the content of C60 is confirmed, which could be related to the lower accessibility of gaseous species to the ZnO surface or to a higher influence of C60 on the gas response mechanism. It has been demonstrated that carbon based materials have a slow recovery at RT to VOCs or different gases >such as NH3 and NO2.50 Thus, a higher content of C60 can improve the ethanol vapor response, but results in slower recovery.
C60 mainly exhibits n-type semiconductor conductivity and the oxygen content can drastically change its electrical resistance.14d,51 Also, previous reports showed that C60 thin films have good response to VOCs.14a,d,e Thus, the increase in gas response to ethanol vapors can be attributed to an increase in C60 content. The main mechanism can be thus explained on the basis of the interaction of VOCs and H2 molecules with oxygen from the C60 layer, creating CO2 and water, respectively,52 as well as charge transfer between C60 and gas molecules.14a However, additional studies need to be performed in order to determine the nature of complex adsorption of VOC molecules (physiosorption or chemisorption).14e The incomplete recoveries to the initial baseline in the present devices indicate the adsorption of VOC molecules via chemical adsorption, i.e., a comparatively strong interaction with C60.14e Additionally, the C60 crystals behave like a sponge (with nanoscale porosity) in which the possibility of intercalation of VOCs cannot be ignored.53 The interactions between few VOCs and C60 might lead to certain weak ionic bonds which then result in localizing them within the C60 crystal even at RT.53 Due to RT, these reactions are relatively slow, which lead to lower response and especially recovery of devices (Fig. 5e–g).
Parameters such as sensitivity and limit of detection were also investigated for Device #3. Fig. S10† shows the dependence of ethanol sensitivity at RT versus concentration of ethanol vapors. The sensitivity was defined as the gas response (S) divided by the concentration of ethanol, i.e. %/ppm.54 The theoretical detection limit was estimated to be 5 ppm as was reported in detail by Dua et al., i.e. using (signal/noise) ratio.55 In general, such high response of microscale individual structures (diameter ∼1 μm–3 μm), as in the case of Device #3 (∼32%), can be easily explained on the basis of the C60 coverage on ZnO, because the surface contribution to the electron transport through the ZnO-T arm is quite lower.56 Since both the C60 thin films and ZnO show n-type gas sensing behaviors,14d,51,57 it is very hard to distinguish which dominates the gas response in the case of the C60–ZnO hybrid. However, the increased gas response to VOCs and increased recovery time hint that the C60 film from the surface of the ZnO-T arm is most likely a dominating factor for the here fabricated devices. In the case of ZnO-T-C60 networks, the degradation in response by increasing the temperature was observed. Fig. S11a† shows the gas response of networks versus operating temperature. The optimal temperature seems to be at 300 °C and the highest gas response was observed for the ethanol vapors. The data were calculated by applying one pulse at each operating temperature. However, by repeating measurements at the same temperature, the evident degradation in response was observed. Fig. S11b† shows the transient gas response of ZnO-T-C60 networks at 300 °C by exposing repeatedly to the same concentration of ethanol vapors 5 times. A large shift in the electrical baseline is observed, which also induces the change in gas response. Such behavior was observed at temperatures higher than 200 °C, which can be attributed to the destruction (conversion to amorphous structures and disintegration into icosahedral) of C60 molecules, as reported by Chen et al.58
The adsorption behavior of C60 fullerene on the surface of ZnO was assessed by computing the binding energy of the system (E(ZnO+C60) − EZnO − EC60). We obtain a binding energy of −5.1 eV, which indicates relatively stronger binding of fullerene on the ZnO surface. For a deeper understanding of the binding process, we have presented the total and partial density of states (DOS) for ZnO + C60 in Fig. 6a. It is clear from this figure that following the adsorption of fullerene, significant states are induced which is evident from the partial DOS of C atoms from C60. Moreover, states at the Fermi level with visible contribution of C60 are evident from this figure. This can explain the effect of C60 on the observed enhancement of conductivity. We have performed a Bader charge analysis of the binding process and calculated the amount of charge transfer associated with fullerene adsorption on ZnO. We have observed that there is a charge transfer from C60 to the ZnO surface with a net charge of +0.629 (e) on the fullerene molecule. It is known from the literature that the chemical nature of C60 resembles an n-type semiconductor and it is a highly electronically rich species. The stronger interaction of C60 with the ZnO surface and the resulting charge transfer are supportive of the above fact. To address the promising ethanol sensing properties of C60 covered ZnO as observed in our experiments, we further considered the adsorption of an ethanol molecule on the ZnO + C60 system. The adsorption energy in this case is found to be −0.39 eV, which indicates weak physiosorption. The overall adsorption of C60 on the ZnO surface and subsequent adsorption of ethanol are pictorially depicted as isosurface plots in Fig. 6b and c. The favorable sensing of ethanol gas on C60 can be attributed to the charging effect of the fullerene molecule on the ZnO surface.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a simple strategy for cost-effective fabrication of C60 decorated ZnO tetrapod-based hybrid nanostructures and the corresponding 3D interconnected networks, which offer easy accessibility of features from individual as well as agglomerated C60 molecules in 3D space. The remarkable features from both C60 and ZnO tetrapods complement each other and cumulatively result in new and interesting properties in the hybrid composite form, suitable for advanced applications. Detailed photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation and absorption studies revealed interesting optical properties, including hints about the charge transfer process between the adsorbed C60 molecules and underneath ZnO. The charge transfer process was additionally confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The ZnO/C60 nanostructure based individual nanodevices revealed interesting sensing behaviors towards volatile organic compounds where the operating temperature plays a very crucial role. The interesting optical and electrical properties open further avenues for the application of these ZnO/C60 tetrapod based hybrid materials towards advanced technologies. However, understanding further properties would be highly interesting for the fundamental materials science community.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  ZnO microstructures and the process scheme: (a) SEM image of a ZnO-tetrapodal network after sintering. (b) Actual drop-coating process with a C60 solution. (c) Schematics of the surface after a flooding process was performed. (d) Camera image of a ZnO pellet after the coating. (e) SEM image of the ZnO network coated with C60. (f)–(k) SEM images of the density variation of C60 on ZnO. (f,g) – 10 floodings, (h,i) – 20 floodings, (j,k) – 60 floodings.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) TEM low magnification bright field micrograph of several C60 clusters on top of a ZnO tetrapod surface (appearing black due to the larger thickness compared to the thickness of C60 clusters). (b) TEM bright field image of a single cluster of C60. (c) HRTEM micrograph from the position marked in (b) aligned to [102]. (d) FFT pattern from (c). (e) Simulated ED-pattern from [102] orientation. (f) Raman spectra of reference fullerene powder (pink), reference ZnO network (black) and ZnO network coated with fullerenes. Number of floodings for the analyzed samples was: 5 (cyan), 10 (blue), 20 (green) and 60 (red). For the ZnO network with 60 floodings of C60 on the surface the D peak at 1350 cm−1 becomes sharper and more defined.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Normalized RT PL of the studied ZnO-T-C60 samples, excited with 325 nm (3.8 eV photon energy) and using a ND1 filter. (b) Normalized 14 K PL spectra of the same samples under the same excitation conditions. The inset shows an amplification of the UV region. (c) Normalized 14 K PL spectra of the NBE region for the samples with 10, 20 and 60 floodings, evidencing a well-resolved emission. The inset includes high resolution spectra in the FX-D0X region and a comparison with the bulk ZnO emission (dashed line). (d) RT PLE spectra of the ZnO-T-C60 samples with different floodings, monitored at 2.3 eV (visible band maximum).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorbance spectra of the ZnO-T-C60 (C60) absorption spectrum reproduced from ref. 56 and 57 and (b) RT TRPL of the sample with 20 floodings acquired after 0.05 ms of the pulse of a Xe flash lamp. The valley at ∼517 nm (∼2.40 eV) corresponds to the blaze of the grating. (c) Schematic representation of the band alignment for ZnO and C60 molecules, based on the spectroscopy results and ref. 3. (d) Relative intensity of the visible band as a function of the temperature for the analyzed samples.	 

 	Fig. 5  SEM images of devices based on individual ZnO-T-C60 arms at lower and higher magnification to demonstrate the presence of C60 on the surface of a ZnO-T arm and electrical connections, respectively: (a) Device #1 – 10 floodings; (b) Device #2 – 20 floodings; (c) Device #3 – 60 floodings. (d) The calculated gas response at RT of fabricated devices using individual hybrid structures ZnO-T-C60. The transient gas response at RT of: (e) Device #1; (f) Device #2; (g) Device #3.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Total and partial DOS for fullerene (C60) adsorbed on ZnO surface, (b) charge density difference isosurfaces for binding of C60 on ZnO surface, and (c) binding of ethanol on ZnO + C60 system. (The vertical red dashed line in (a) represents the Fermi energy. For isosurface, the yellow color depicts charge depletion and the cyan color charge accumulation. The isovalue used is 0.001 (a.u.). Atom color code: Zn (blue); O (red); C (green).)
