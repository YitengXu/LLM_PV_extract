    , Accepted 19th December 2021First published on 21st December 2021AbstractMetal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continue to improve their power conversion efficiency to over 25.5%, which is at the same level as silicon solar cells. The stability of perovskite cells is a challenging issue for the commercialization of this photovoltaic technology. The degradation of PSCs is mainly due to external environmental factors, such as oxygen, moisture, light, and heat. The degradation of PSCs by oxygen and moisture can be suppressed through the encapsulation of devices. However, encapsulation cannot reduce light and heat degradation under the operating conditions. In this Review, we mainly focus on the analysis of degradation mechanisms caused by light and heat. Compositional and interfacial engineering of perovskite material lattice sites are the most widely applied strategy to alleviate the degradation of PSCs. The improvements in PSC stability and device efficiency are also reviewed for defect passivation at charge transport layer/perovskite interfaces with various materials such as polymers, small molecules, quantum dots, ligands, charge-transporting layers dopants, and post-treatment of the perovskite film. This Review will help to understand the degradation mechanism of PSCs and improve their stability under illumination. We believe that this Review will help with the design the optimal PSCs for highly efficient and stable devices.

1. Introduction
Over the past decades, thin-film solar cells prepared using diverse new materials that have the advantages of being lightweight, semitransparent, low-cost, and having multifunctional applications have attracted increasing research interest.1–6 Among those emerging new materials, the organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite is an amazing material with some intrinsic properties such as a low exciton binding energy, long-range ambipolar transport characteristics, intrinsic ferroelectric polarization, and a high dielectric constant.7–9 Perovskites solar cells (PSCs) have recently shown great potential for application due to their high-performance power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.5% and have attracted worldwide attention because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties. The family of perovskite materials has demonstrated considerable prospects in achieving efficiencies that are comparable to or even better than those of thin-film solar cells.10–14 Despite the excellent properties of perovskite materials, their long-term device stability has become a major bottleneck for the commercialization of PSCs.15 Indeed, over the past few years, the stability of perovskite solar cells has become a hot research topic in the field, where the number of publications has increased dramatically from only 3 in 2013 to 1705 in 2020, as shown in Fig. 1(a). For the fabrication of highly stable and high-performance PSCs, it is extremely important to understand the degradation mechanisms from different degradation factors. According to various studies, it has been suggested that light, heat, moisture, and oxygen are the most considerable external factors for the degradation of PSCs.16–19 Several encapsulation techniques have been used to remove these external factors of degradation.20,21 However, under illumination, encapsulated PSCs exhibit rapid degradation due to their intrinsic factors of degradation. It has been found that, under illumination, photo-induced ion migration and the charge-carrier trapping in defect centers are the intrinsic factors for degradation in PSCs. The PSC degradation factors can be classified into intrinsic and extrinsic types. The intrinsic degradation factors are related to intrinsic structural and chemical instability, which mostly originate from the materials themselves and the interfaces. The extrinsic degradation factors are related to external environmental factors.22–24 With the advanced development of materials and the appropriate selection of materials as well as improved device-structure design, the effects of intrinsic degradation factors can be reduced, and it can be of help to understand the extrinsic degradation mechanisms.

The data on the number of publications are taken from Scopus (http://www.scopus.com). (b) Stability of perovskite solar cells presented by the PCE merit versus device aging. The PCE merit is the retained PCE value of the device after degradation. Results from stability tests involving illumination are represented with the term “Tested under light,” while results from stability tests under illumination and at elevated temperature are represented with the term “Tested under light & heat.” The figure is drawn based on data in Tables 1 and 2. 
It has been found that some external environmental factors initiate the internal degradation mechanism.25 It is critical to understand the external degradation mechanism and the interaction with intrinsic degradation factors leading to linking with the methodologies for the performance of PSCs.26 The external environmental factors such as light, heat, moisture, and oxygen are related to extrinsic degradation factors, which are the main degradation mechanisms for PSCs.27–29 The illumination of light leads to breaking the perovskite molecules and causes the degradation of device performance via the generation of carrier-recombination centers.28 The solar cell operation temperature can be raised over 80 °C, and for most of the used perovskite materials, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), a phase transition occurs at around 60 °C. Currently, significant progress has been achieved in the field, as some high-performance perovskite devices have already been reported with a lifetime of over 1000 hours under illumination, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Nevertheless, each of the external degradation mechanisms of perovskite materials still needs to be more deeply understood for the fabrication of highly efficient and stable PSCs. For the long-term operational stability of PSCs, it is also important to understand the role of the charge-transporting materials.30,31 Normally, the PSC device structure is composed of a perovskite layer (absorber) sandwiched between two carrier-transport layers that are called the hole-transporting layer (HTL) and electron-transporting layer (ETL), as shown in Fig. 2(a). Each layer of the PSC structure has a different function and has a considerable effect on the performance and stability of the device. The ETL and HTL also suffer from degradation issues. For the long-term stability of PSCs, it is also critical to understand the degradation mechanisms of the HTL and ETL as well as to enhance the performance of the cells. The degradation of the three major layers in PSCs should be controlled using appropriate methods to enhance the device performance and stability. It is encouraging that numerous efforts have been made on the compositional engineering and interfacial engineering of PSCs to improve the device performance and to reduce the effects of environmental degradation and thus enhance the device stability.32–34 In compositional engineering, efforts have been made to develop materials for each major layer as well as the electrode metal in the PSC device structure.35,36 In interfacial engineering, reducing interfacial defects by passivating the layers has been done to boost the efficiency of PSCs and to reduce the effects of degradation factors.37,38

The simultaneous improvement of device stability and efficiency via compositional and interfacial engineering is an important challenge. So far, few reviews have thoroughly discussed the stability issues for single-junction perovskite solar cells,39–41 whereas a systematic review that focused on the defects with regard to the stability of PSCs is still missing in the field. Herein, the quantification of the stability of PSCs is difficult due to a lack of standardized stability measurement criteria and conditions. The criteria of device-aging conditions such as light and thermal stabilities need to be specified. For increasing the PCE and stability, a “stability−efficiency” strategy map is required by establishing a link between perovskite materials and their distinct variations. The key factors of the PSC degradation mechanisms of major layers cannot be eliminated by encapsulation. Compositional engineering, such as via cation/ion substitution, can be focused upon, and interfacial engineering can be focused upon an interface-defects passivation strategy. For the PV market, perovskite technologies with reasonable manufacturing costs can be cost-competitive only if they operate with a long-term stability that is comparable to commercialized c-Si modules. Herein, it is important to achieve a stability of PSCs toward ∼25 years under sunlight at elevated temperatures if stable solar-power generation is to be achieved for future commercial applications. In this Review, we are providing the guidelines for further study and the development of PSC materials and devices toward a longer lifetime.
2. Defects in perovskite-halide materials
Perovskite-halide is an emerging absorber material with some superior photovoltaic properties, such as a high carrier mobility, a tunable direct bandgap, a long carrier diffusion length, etc.4,42–44 The perovskite film crystalline morphology must be playing an important role to achieve a high-efficiency device with good reproducibility.45,46Fig. 3(a) displays a schematic diagram of the ABX3 perovskite crystal structure for a hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite. The A position contains an organic cation, B is a metal cation, and X is a halide anion. The most explored organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite material in the field of photovoltaics is CH3NH3PbI3. This perovskite material consists of a large organic cation, methylammonium (CH3NH3+), lead (Pb) as the smaller metal cation, and iodine as the halogen anion. Perovskites possess multiple desirable traits as absorber materials in photovoltaic devices. Hybrid perovskite materials provide a favorable direct bandgap structure, a high carrier mobility, large absorption coefficients, strong defect tolerance, a shallow point defect, lower grain boundary recombination effects, and reduced surface recombination.47 These properties make perovskite materials superior candidates as absorbers in solar cells. The perovskite layer can be deposited using low-cost coating and printing techniques. This implies that advances made for polymer solar cells can be transferrable to this new material system. The tolerance factor of the perovskite material in the range of 0.8–1 is required to obtain a stable material. The cubic phase realization with a tolerance value of between 0.9 and 1 is preferred. By changing or mixing ions of different sizes, the tolerance factor can be changed to provide an enhancement of the stability.

2.1 Compositional engineering
The instability of the perovskite material MAPbI3 is due to the smaller size of the MA-ion, which makes it adopt the less symmetrical tetragonal phase. Replacement of the MA-ions either partially or fully with a suitable ion size at the A site will change it toward a symmetrical lattice structure, which will improve the stability.49 The mixture strategy and the change of component at the A site, such as using a mixture of MA and formamidinium (FA) as well as the cations with acetamidinium (Ace) and MA, can deliver a high PCE of 19.5% and a promoted device stability. The substitution of larger Ace cations induced distortion of the lattice cubic structure with a changed tolerance factor.50 The compositional engineering of PSCs via substituting MA with Ace has not yet been investigated to enhance the stability of devices. The mixture strategy of FA and MA increases the lattice expansion and strengthens the interaction with I− ions as well as increases the tolerance factor. The PSC efficiency of 21.24% was realized by mixing MA with FA with low stability under illumination because of the unstable yellow phase in the perovskite material due to the incorporation of the FA cation.51 The enhancement of light stability via the full replacement of MA cations at the A site with cesium (Cs) can be realized due to the intrinsic nature of Cs. The enhancement of light stability with CsPbI3-based PSCs with an efficiency of over 16% has already been realized after 3000 h of light soaking.52,53 The main issue of CsPbI3-based PSCs is their low efficiency. More investigations are necessary on the site-based substitution method to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs by tuning the tolerance factor in the range of 0.9–1. A mixed Cs/MA/FA-based PSC efficiency of around 21% was realized under illumination with enhanced stability. The Cs/MA/FA mixture-based PSCs need further investigation for achieving stable and high-efficiency devices. The efficiency of Rb/Cs/FA-based PSCs was realized at over 20% under illumination with good stability due to the better crystallinity and the suppressed yellow phase of FAPbI3.54,55 The cation-mixing strategy facilitates the growth of the desired crystal structure with the required orientation, mitigates trap states through the formation of a smooth perovskite film, reduces charge recombination, enhances electron extraction and transport and improves the thermal stability.56
Iodine (I) is the most used anion at the X site in perovskite materials. Under illumination, perovskites with I− anions suffer from oxidation. Oxidation under light soaking can be reduced by mixing the halides. The band gap of perovskite materials can be tuned by mixing halides, improving their stability, and accelerating charge transport. The crystallization of MAPbI3 can be enhanced by Cl− at the X site. It can accelerate charge transfer, and the carrier diffusion length increases the carrier collection, thus enhancing the PSC device efficiency and stability.57 The bonding strength of MA–Pb is increased via the combination of Br and I, which compresses the lattice as well as enlarges the crystal grain size, improving both the thermal stability and efficiency. With the formation of a high-quality MAPbI3−xBrx absorber layer, the PSC efficiency is increased up to 19.2%.58 The concentration of Br in MAPbI3−xBrx needs to be optimized to achieve high-efficiency and stable PSCs. An excess of Br at the X site creates recombination centers due to the generation of I-rich inclusions. Special attention should be paid to X-site compositional engineering for the better performance and stability of PSCs. Anion substitution at the X site is playing a critical role in the improvement of thermal and light stability.
The simultaneous substitution of both A and X sites can be more effective for the improvement of PSC efficiency and stability.59–61 For example, the substitution of I by Br at the X site leads to a reduction of octahedral tilting and lattice distortion, and simultaneously adding Cs at the A site helps with formation of the cubic phase with tolerance factor modulation for a high-quality perovskite film. The perovskite CsPbBr3 material shows excellent stability under illumination. However, these material-based PSCs have a low efficiency because of their large bandgap of ∼2.3 eV and their narrow-spectra absorption of less than 550 nm.62 Mixing Br with I at the X site in CsPbBr3, such as in CsPbI3−xBrx, can increase the PSC efficiency up to 18.5% due to the reduction of bandgap energy and crystallinity as well as non-radiative recombination suppression.63 Cl-doping in the CsPbI3 material contributed to enhancing the PSC efficiency (up to 19%) and stability under illumination.64 The mixing of Cs and FA at the A site with the Br/I mixture at the X site, such as in FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.7Br0.3-based PSCs, has achieved an efficiency of 20.32% due to perovskite phase crystallization and halide segregation reduction.65 On the basis of a Cs/FA/MA mixture at the A site and a Br/I mixture at the X site, a PSC efficiency of 21.5% was realized due to the formation of a high-quality perovskite film with a larger grain size and a reduction of defect states.66 Mixing and selecting appropriate ions with an optimal concentration at both the A and X sites, we can simultaneously achieve light-stable and high-efficiency PSCs. Both high-efficiency and light-stable PSCs can be realized using the compositional engineering strategy with a preferred perovskite crystal orientation, a uniformity of film morphology with a large grain size, and a reduced trap density.
The device stability is also related to the lead (Pb) element at the B site in PSCs because of the soft nature of Pb–I bonding and Pb2+ ions.67 Under illumination and/or at a higher temperature, the Pb2+ ions tend to form into Pb atoms and generate deep defect states, which leads to severe degradation.68,69 Replacement Pb2+ ions at the B site with tin (Sn) either fully or partially is one of the options for promoting the stability of PSC devices.68,70 The oxidation of Sn2+ ions creates fewer grain boundary defects, improves the crystal quality, and generates a higher Voc, which enhances both the efficiency and stability of PSCs.71 The replacement of Pb with Ca at the B site has also promoted the efficiency to 19.3% and enhanced the stability under illumination.72 CaI2 enhances both the efficiency and light stability of PSCs due to the passivation of defects, and the formation of a smooth, uniform, and dense film with large crystal grains. The partial substitution of Pb by strontium (Sr) has also suppressed the heat degradation of PSCs due to mitigation of the defect density, preventing perovskite decomposition, and generating compact perovskite films.73 The substitution of Pb2+ ions with cadmium ions (Cd2+) can also improve the stability of PSCs due to the stronger Cd–I ionic bonds, which have a higher binding energy. An impressive PSC efficiency of 21.9% and sustainable stability under light illumination are achieved via the replacement of Pb with Cd at the B site.74 Optimization of ion substitution at A, B, and X sites for the development of compositional engineering along with alternative materials will improve both the stability and the efficiency of PSCs for commercial applications. Moreover, some studies have demonstrated that external additives such as PCBM and NH4Cl in the perovskite structure can also have an effect on reducing defects and improving the stability of perovskites.75–77 Herein, a summary of the stability enhancement of devices based on compositional engineering is listed in Table 1.

2.2 Defects in perovskite-halides
There are 12 possible native point defects in the MAPbI3 structure, such as vacancies VMA, VPb, and VI; interstitials MAi, Pbi, and Ii; and anti-site occupations MAPb, MAI, PbMA, PbI, IMA, and IPb, which have been widely studied.82–89 The common message about point defects in MAPbI3 are that these defects with a high energy can contribute to the formation of deep levels in the bandgap, and low-energy defects can contribute to the formation of shallow defect states. Deep-level point defects may not contribute a high density of non-radiative recombination centers. However, there is some variation in opinion about which point defects can contribute to deep levels including IPb, IMA, Pbi, PbI, VI, and PbMA.82,88,89 The defect formation energies of IMA, PbI, and VI are low enough to contribute a significant density of recombination centers.82–84 The formation energy of the PbI anti-site defect is low under iodine-rich conditions. The stable charge state of the PbI defect can make a transition at the Fermi level. Acceptors of shallow point defects are VPb, VMA, MAPb, and Ii under some growth conditions with low formation energies, and MAi, VI, and MAI are donors of shallow point defects.84,89 The donors and acceptors of shallow point defects can convert the MAPbI3 material from p-type to n-type by intrinsic doping. Under stoichiometric growth conditions, the cation and anion vacancies may also dominate the defect formation.87 If the defect formation energies are low, unintentional doping can be minimized by compensating the vacancy with opposite charge carriers.
The four native defects, Vx, VA, VPb, and Pbi, in the perovskite crystal and the probable migration path for these four point defects were identified from the theoretical calculations, as shown in Fig. 3(b).48 The proposed migration pathways are designed based on comparable migration energies to different defects with the displacement of the same chemical species. For example, MA-related defects (e.g., MAPb or MAi) should display a similar activation energy as that calculated for VMA. In fact, the activation energies of VI and Ii are essentially the same.
The migration process of VPb in MAPbI3 is quite slow (1.2 s−1) due to its high activation energy, Ea, of 0.80 eV. The activation energy of 0.46 eV for VMA has been measured experimentally.90 The migration rate of 6.5 × 105 s−1 at room temperature for VMA is estimated from the activation energy value. One can provide an estimation of the migration rate (K) based on the estimated activation energies from the Arrhenius equation:91 K = [(kBT)/ħ]q(Ea/RT)(1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, q is the charge of the electron and R is the ideal gas constant.
The calculated activation energies of VI and Ii are predicted to be 0.08 eV, which is sufficient for a full hop to take place in each crystallographic direction. In the absence of an external field, the charged defect can indistinctly migrate forward or backward in any crystallographic direction. Under illumination within the operating conditions of PSCs, the charged defect (positive/negative) favors migration towards the side of the perovskite film that contacts the hole/electron transporting layer. The interstitial defects VI and Ii can migrate towards the hole/electron contacts that are stabilized due to electrostatic interaction with the electrode. The defects can reach the electrode within tens of nanoseconds, which is much faster than the scanning rate in photovoltaic current–voltage (I–V) measurements.

Fig. 4 summarises the generated probable defects, dipoles, and ions in perovskite solar cells under illumination, which can lead to device degradation and the hysteresis phenomenon during I–V measurements. During I–V measurements, concerning the scan rate/direction, various processes with respect to ion migration, ferroelectricity, charge trapping, and associated capacitive effects can occur simultaneously, which lead to the resultant hysteresis.90 To overcome the hysteresis problem, as well as enhancing the PSC efficiency and device stability, it is very important to control and minimize the various defects and ions in the device structure under illumination.

2.3 Phase segregation in mixed-halides perovskites
So far, many different perovskite compositions have been developed, where the mixed-halides perovskites dominate the research in solar cells due to their promising device performance. Nevertheless, mixed-halides perovskites also suffer from unique phase segregation behavior, which is detrimental to their device stability, as shown in Fig. 5.92–94
 Fig. 5  Example of phase segregation behavior with photoluminescence results of the CsPbIxBr3−x perovskite. Reproduced with permission from ref. 95 Copyright 2020 Cell Press. 
Phase segregation behavior was first observed by Hoke et al. in the perovskite with the composition of MAPb(BrxI1−x).96 They reported that two separate phases featuring bromide and iodide aggregation can occur in perovskite under light illumination. This was confirmed by the PL results, where the PL peak of the perovskite can slowly decrease and with a new red-shifted peak appearing. Such phase segregation behavior can create sub-bandgap trap states within the perovskite film, which can trap photogenerated charge carriers and degrade the device performance.97 On the other hand, those phase segregation induced trap states also seriously limit the current injection and charge extraction in the perovskite, which is detrimental to the device performance.
Despite much research effort, the mechanism behind phase segregation is still controversial. Nevertheless, it is commonly agreed in the field that phase segregation is closely related to defects in the perovskite. A perovskite film with a high concentration of halide defects usually has stronger phase segregation behavior.87 In addition, the inhomogeneous lattice strain in the perovskite film can be another potential origin, which can cause non-uniform charge generation.98 Fortunately, t many effective approaches have been developed to prevent phase segregation.99,100 In 2019, Duong et al. applied a stoichiometric engineering method to suppress the phase segregation of a mixed-halides perovskite. They developed a perovskite with a RbCsFAMA quadruple composition, which exhibits a higher halide segregation threshold.96,101 Hu et al. reported suppressed phase segregation in MAPb(Br0.27I0.73)3 perovskite films through engineering of the perovskite crystallinity and grain size.102 Using potassium iodide to passivate the defects and grain boundaries, Abdi-Jalebi et al. prevented halide segregation in (Cs0.06MA0.15FA0.79)Pb(BrxI(1−x))3 perovskite films.103 In this regard, several papers have comprehensively reviewed these effective approaches to phase segregation.97,99,104
2.4 Carrier transport and recombination process
There is a trade-off between the perovskite active layer thickness needed to maximize light absorption to generate enough electron–hole pairs and the efficient collection of photogenerated carriers. The carrier collection efficiency can be determined by the charge transport towards the electrodes and the carrier recombination. The charge transport is affected by the defects in perovskite films. The main effects are ionized defect scattering such as the Coulombic interaction between the charged defects.105 Neutral defects may also affect the charge transport by scattering.106,107 Charge carriers can be trapped in the deep energy defect states in the bandgap, which can reduce the overall charge conductivity via Coulombic and neutral scattering.108,109 The charge transport also depends on the density of traps and the device operating conditions.110 The charge transport may be negligible when the photocarrier density is much higher than the trap density because the trap is likely to be fully populated. The charge carrier transport in the device can be independent of the applied bias for an intermediate level of trap density where under short-circuit conditions the steady-state carrier density is low but increases towards open-circuit conditions. Hence, developing a charge transport layer with lower defects and better optoelectronic properties is a promising way to further improve the stability of perovskite solar cells.110,111
Under steady-state conditions, the generation and recombination processes of carriers are required for the principal balance. In PSCs, photogenerated carriers may also recombine through non-radiative and radiative processes for a given excitation density and temperature. In PSCs, the charge recombination is directly related to the open-circuit voltage Voc. The recombination mechanism can be classified as (i) band-to-band recombination, (ii) Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) trap-assisted recombination, and (iii) SRH trap-assisted recombination with one pinned charge carrier density. In the solar cell the total recombination rate can be written as: Rtot = Rb + RSRH(bulk) + RSRH(front int.) + RSRH(back int.)(2)where Rb is the band-to-band recombination rate, and RSRH is the trap-assisted recombination in the bulk, and at the interface with the front and back ETL and HTL, respectively.
2.5 Strain in perovskite solar cells
Strain is detrimental to the perovskite device's performance and stability. The existence of strain can accelerate device degradation by distorting the perovskite crystal structure, reducing the ion migration activation energy, and forming defect states.112,113 Strain in perovskites can be divided into two types: the local lattice strain, and externally induced strain.114 The local lattice strain mainly comes from the instability of the perovskite structure and the local lattice mismatch. The externally induced strain in different perovskite solar cells can be very different due to the usage of the different charge transport layers and perovskite compositions with different expansion coefficients. The expansion coefficients of functional layers in perovskite-based solar cells including perovskites, substrates, and different interlayers can be very different. Commonly, perovskites exhibit a high expansion coefficient of around 3.3 × 10−5 to 8.4 × 10−5 K−1. Most perovskite solar cells have a large expansion mismatch, as the widely used glass substrates and electron transport layers have a low expansion coefficient of around 0.37 × 10−5 to 1 × 10−5 K−1.115,116 Under these circumstances, strain in the perovskite solar cells is unavoidable.
Therefore, regulating the strain in perovskite solar cells has attracted much research interest, where many effective strategies have been developed. For regulating the local strain, perovskite compositional engineering has been widely investigated. Seok et al. compositionally engineered their FAPbI3 perovskite with methylenediammonium (MDA2+) and Cs+ cations, which contributed to lower lattice strain in the perovskite and significantly improved thermal stability for their devices.117 Similarly, Sargent et al. incorporated B-site dopants into their perovskite to release the local lattice strain. As a result, their modified perovskites exhibited an increased defect formation energy and showed an order of magnitude higher device stability under ambient conditions.118 For regulating the externally induced strains, using charge transport layers with suitable expansion coefficients is a commonly used strategy. Sargent et al. pointed out that the tensile strain of a perovskite film can be released by introducing an external strain from the charge transport layer above.119 The charge transport layer with a high expansion coefficient, such as poly[5,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylatealt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene] (PDCBT), is beneficial for reducing the strain in perovskite films. By optimizing the annealing temperature of PDCBT on the perovskite, Sargent et al. prepared a compressive-strain device that exhibited promising device stability, which maintained 96% and 95% of the initial PCE values after 1000 hours of heating at 85 °C and 60 hours of MPP tracking, respectively.
2.6 Low-dimensional perovskites
In recent years, and attributed to the promising intrinsic stability, the low-dimensional perovskite has become a hot research topic in the field.120,121 Usually, a 2D perovskite can be synthesized by inserting large organic cations into the 3D perovskite structure, which contributes to the formation of a layer-structured perovskite stack with insulating organic spacer layers, as shown in Fig. 6.122 In 2D perovskites, most of the organic spacer layers show a hydrophobic feature, which can act as an intrinsic barrier for moisture and bring about promising ambient stability.123,124 On the other hand, organic spacers provide strong van der Waals forces in 2D perovskites, which increases the lattice stability.125 Moreover, the layered structure in 2D perovskites can be considered as a multiple quantum well structure, which is beneficial to the device performance via the quantum confinement effects and dielectric confinement effects.126,127

So far, many 2D perovskites with excellent stability have been reported. Sargent et al. confirmed that the incorporation of a large organic cation, PEAI, can increase the decomposition energy of the perovskite layer. They pointed out that the decomposition of the 2D perovskite can be slowed down by as much as 1000 times when compared with the 3D counterpart.125 Recently, Lin et al. introduced BA spacers to synthesize 2D perovskites, which was confirmed via suppressed ion migration behavior. They reported that the ion-migration threshold energy in the BA-based 2D perovskite is as high as ∼41 meV.128 More recently, Ren et al. designed a 2D perovskite with the structure of (MTEA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 using a new bulky alkylammonium cation from 2-(methylthio)ethylammonium hydrochloride (MTEACl). As a result, they demonstrated 2D perovskite solar cells with excellent stability against moisture, which showed a PCE of 18.06% with high tolerance under 70% relative humidity for 1512 h.129
3. Defect generation mechanism by external environmental factors
The degradation of PSCs is caused by external environmental factors such as oxygen, moisture, light, and heat. Under the operating conditions, the main causes of PSC degradation are all four environmental factors, as shown in Fig. 2(b), which need to be investigated by the research community.
3.1 Moisture and oxygen effects
In the mechanism of moisture degradation, water molecules break the hydrogen bonds in the perovskite structure and form hydrated compounds by forming new hydrogen bonds.130 Moisture degradation in PSCs can be protected against by encapsulation of the device in the operating environment. Oxygen degradation effects become a bigger concern than moisture in a dry atmosphere. Oxygen can react with perovskite ions such as MA−, Pb+, and I−, to form electronic traps and charge barriers. On the perovskite film surface, oxygen can create Pb–O bonds that can induce severe oxygen degradation.131 The severe degradation effects of moisture and oxygen can be considerably reduced by the appropriate encapsulation of PSC devices. Micro-cracks and pinholes in the encapsulation layers can be created, which have an unfavorable effect on the device stability over the longer term.
The encapsulation of PSCs cannot protect against the instability of devices caused by light and heat. In the normal operation of PSCs, light can generate charges by photoinduced ion migration, phase segregation, and trap state formation. The photocatalytic degradation of PSCs substantially influenced their real-life stability.28,132–134 For the commercial application of PSCs, light stability plays an important role. Therefore, the selection of perovskite materials with low light-induced degradation is one of the most important steps to ensure the application of PSC devices. Heat is another external factor for the degradation of PSCs. For example, heat-related degradation can affect the device fabrication process of annealing, device encapsulation, testing, and operation due to phase transition or separation, decomposition, ion diffusion, and inhibition of charge transport.135 The thermal stability of PSCs is another very important barrier to commercialization of this technology. The identification of perovskite materials with thermal stability is the second step to be determined. Most of the commonly used materials in PSCs exhibit instability to external light and heat degradation factors, even in encapsulated devices.136–140 A clear understanding of degradation mechanisms induced by light and heat for both charge transporting materials (i.e., HTL and ETL) and the perovskite absorber layer in PSCs is needed to improve the device stability and performance for the commercialization of devices.
3.2 Light effects
Under illumination, perovskite materials are degraded due to the decomposition of materials, even it they a very good light harvester for the generation of electron–hole charge carriers.132,134,141 The light-induced degradation of the most commonly used perovskite material MAPbI3 is decomposed via the generation of hydrogen iodide (HI) under ambient conditions. This HI is released from the methylammonium (MA) cation. Under illumination, this MAPbI3 perovskite material decomposes into MAI and PbI2. The MAI further decomposes into MeNH2, HI, and/or iodine (I2).28 The chemical bonds in the perovskite material can be broken by high-energy photons.142 Light-induced degradation is also present in HTL and ETL materials such as spiro-OMeTAD and TBP, respectively, which also leads to the instability in PSCs.143,144 The mechanism of the light-induced degradation of the HTL dopant spiro-OMeTAD is the inactivation of dopants and the reaction between the perovskite and the dopant.144
In PSCs, both TiO2 and [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) are used as ETL materials. The degradation mechanisms of both TiO2 and PCBM are different.28,145 Under illumination, the degradation of TiO2 is mainly from the desorption of oxygen on the surface, which leads to the generation of oxygen vacancy sites in the film. These oxygen vacancies behave as deep electron-donating sites. Electrons from the donating sites are excited to the conduction band, and the holes that are formed in the valence band interact with oxygen radicals.146–148 The PSC device becomes unstable under light soaking because the free electrons in the conduction band are recombined in the HTL. The stability of the PCBM ETL is much better than TiO2 due to the absence of oxygen desorption. Under light illumination, the PSCs degrade because of significant electron recombination at the PCBM/perovskite interfaces due to the low relative permittivity of PCBM.149 To avoid light-induced degradation from PCBM, researchers need to find alternative ETL materials in order to enhance the PSC stability.
3.3 Thermal effects
At normal operating temperatures of up to 85 °C, perovskite materials are also undergoing heat degradation due to crystal instability. For example, the most used perovskite material MAPbI3 usually undergoes the phase transition from the tetragonal to the cubic phase at around 54–57 °C. Due to its weak bonds and low formation energy, the organic MA cation evaporates at a higher temperature.135 Depending on the ionic radius in the crystal the heat-induced degradation of a perovskite can also be explained by the tolerance factor (t) for the perovskite crystal stability. With a tolerance factor value of 0.8–1.0, perovskite materials show decent stability. When the ‘t’ value is outside this range, severe heat-induced degradation occurs due to lattice distortion.150 Most of the organic HTLs have thermally unstable characteristics, e.g., spiro-OMeTAD HTL suffers from thermal instability at elevated temperatures.151 At high temperatures, charge separation, and transport from MAPbI3 to spiro-OMeTAD occurs due to the low glass transition temperature and crystallization of the HTL.152 The heat-induced degradation of spiro-OMeTAD becomes a serious issue due to the decreased electrical conductivity and hole mobility in the HTL. The heat degradation of ETLs in PSCs becomes negligible because both TiO2 and PCBM have excellent thermal stability. Each of the degradation mechanisms in the PSC structure needs to be understood clearly to find corresponding solutions for the fabrication of efficient and stable devices for commercial applications.
4. Interface engineering for efficiency and stability
To simultaneously enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs, interfacial engineering is an important critical strategy. The selection of promising materials for interfacial engineering can be polymers, ligands, small functional molecules, low-dimensional (low-D) perovskites, and perovskite quantum dots (QDs).153–156 Polymer materials act as both insulation components and defect passivators in perovskite materials as well as on its surfaces, which can also prevent the extrinsic degradation factors. Perovskite surface defects can be passivated by forming strong bonds with ligands, which can protect against degradation of the perovskite lattice. The bandgap and the redox potential of small molecules can be easily tuned. Because of the low crystallinity of small molecules, it is favorable for the deposition of amorphous organic layers for better electronic contact with the perovskite layer by reducing the interface defects. The low-D (2D) perovskites can protect against extrinsic degradation factors as well as prevent the decomposition of the 3D perovskite absorber because of the higher formation energy of 2D materials. Through the incorporation of 2D perovskite materials, ion migration and the defect density can be mitigated to enhance the device's stability. The QDs of many materials are favorable for perovskite layer surface defect passivation, to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Through interfacial engineering, the light and thermal stability of PSCs can be significantly improved by using all of these 2D materials.
4.1 Interfacial protective layer
A suitable interfacial protective layer can be inserted between the ETL/perovskite and the HTL/perovskite interfaces in the PSC structure to prevent degradation of the device due to external effects. This protective layer can protect the PSCs from extrinsic degradation factors and enhance the device's stability. Some of the UV absorber protective layers can be used for ultraviolet light shielding to protect the PSCs from UV light-induced degradation. For example, the 2,5-diphenyl C60 fulleropyrrolidine (DPC60) protective layer at the ETL/perovskite interface passivates the perovskite surface defects, enhancing the perovskite crystallinity and the electron extraction, thus improving the device performance.36 The protective monolayer graphene (MLG) can also improve the device performance by improving the carrier extraction.157 However, both DPC60- and MLG-based PSCs exhibit low light stability. The light stability could be achieved by improving the compatibility of the protective layers with another material layer. The multifunctional photopolymer protective layer can be used to improve the stability of PSCs by eliminating the negative interaction. For example, a luminescent down-shifting (LDS) fluoro-polymeric multifunctional photopolymer protective layer on the front of PSC devices transforms the UV light to visible light and significantly enhances the device light stability.158 The interfacial protective layer between the ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite interfaces improves the PSC efficiency and stability. As an example, the protective layer Eu(TTA)2(Phen)MAA (ETPM) insertion between the TiO2/perovskite interface boosted the device efficiency and light stability.159 The rare-earth element Eu-doped ETPM protective layer absorbs UV light and induces the down-conversion of light, generating more photons, mitigating spectral mismatch losses, improving carrier transport, and reducing carrier recombination. Therefore, it is preferable to insert a protective layer at the ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite interfaces to boost PSC efficiency and light stability. The insertion of a polystyrene (PS) protective layer at the interface of ETL/perovskite enhanced the PSC efficiency up to 21.9% as well as the light stability due to the passivation of interface defects and reducing carrier recombination and ion migration.160 Another tetracene protective layer with a thickness of 120 nm inserted between the HTL and the perovskite layer enhanced the PSC efficiency up to 21.6% as well as the light stability due to interface modification and improvement of crystallinity, which is blocking the extrinsic ionic migrations.161 The tetracene layer reduced the interface defects, inducing a smoother surface for good contact with the perovskite layer. The tetracene protective layer facilitates hole injection and extraction due to its graded bandgap.
As mentioned, a 2D perovskite featuring intrinsic good stability is a promising absorber for perovskite solar cells. Herein, a thin layer of a 2D perovskite layer can also be used as an interfacial layer on top of a 3D perovskite to increase its device performance and stability. As a capping layer, the 2D perovskites can not only passivate the surface defects on the 3D perovskite but also act as a barrier to protect the perovskite from ion migration and moisture penetration.162 Insertion of another protective layer 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI) at the HTL/perovskite interface enhanced the PSC efficiency up to 23.5% and boosted the light stability.163 The tBBAI protective layer induces a smoother surface, passivates interfacial defects, makes better contact with the perovskite absorber, accelerates charge extraction, and suppresses carrier recombination. A 2D (FEA)2PbI4 (FEA, pentafluorophenylethylammonium) protective layer, inserted at the HTL/perovskite interface, improved the PSC device efficiency up to 22% and enhanced the light stability due to the increase of interfacial hole extraction, and the reduction of interlayer ionic diffusion and carrier recombination.164 Another 2D IBA2FAPb2I7 protective layer inserted at the HTL/perovskite interface improved the PSC efficiency up to 23% and enhanced the light stability due to surface defect passivation and improvement of charge transport. Further studies are required for protective layers to promote the efficiency and light stability of PSCs. Herein, a summary of device stability enhancement based on interfacial protective layers is listed in Table 2.

4.2 Post-treatment of perovskite absorber film surface
Deposited perovskite film surface defects are a serious problem for the performance and stability of PSCs. Normally, two types of surface defect exist on the perovskite absorber films, such as under-coordinated Pb and I atoms. These undercoordinated atoms on the perovskite film surface can act as recombination centers of carriers at the ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite interfaces. The reduction of surface dangling bond defects by post-treatment of the perovskite absorber film can be an effective strategy to improve the PSC performance and stability. The passivation of perovskite film surface defects using Lewis acids or bases can be de-activated by the surface defects.167 The fluorine atoms of iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) can withdraw an electron from the aromatic ring via electro-negative induction and a partial positive charge is left on the halogen. IPFB can accept electrons from under-coordinated I to form a halogen bond. A strong electron acceptor, Lewis acid 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), was reported to form a supramolecular interaction with under-coordinated I.168 The interfacial dipole layer is formed at the perovskite/F4TCNQ interface through the diffusion of the electron from the perovskite to F4TCNQ, which also creates an energy barrier for electron diffusion and enhances the PSC current.
For the passivation of under-coordinated Pb, Lewis bases pyridine and thiophene were used for coordination through N and S atoms, respectively.169 The PSC efficiency was enhanced up to 16.5% and the light stability was also improved. The post-treatment of MAPbI3 with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) increases the perovskite film's recrystallization, reduces the defect density, and improves the PSC efficiency up to 18%.170,171 For the passivation of under-coordinated I and Pb, some molecules were introduced simultaneously, for example, Cu(thiourea)I and benzylamine.172–174 Cu(thiourea)I supplies iodide to fill up the halide vacancies in the perovskite film and chelate the under-coordinated halide anions with the electropositive copper atoms. Similarly, the amino group in benzylamine coordinates with under-coordinated Pb thorough the N atom and forms hydrogen bonds using the under-coordinated I and H atoms in benzylamine. Benzylamine-modified FAPbI3 solar cells exhibited an efficiency of up to 19.2%.171
5. Conclusions
In this Review, we have analyzed the literature to understand the defects and degradation mechanisms of PSCs due to external environmental factors such as light and heat under operational conditions. The interface defects at the ETL/perovskite and HTL/perovskite interfaces and the mitigation of defect densities in single-junction PSCs are also reviewed. We have reviewed and analyzed the promising methods to reduce the defect density in the PSC structure so as to enhance the device performance and stability.
As an outlook, for perovskite materials with a higher defect-tolerance from compositional and interfacial engineering perspectives, it is possible to design high-efficiency PSCs with reduced degradation and improved stability. It is important to focus on further studies on PSC to achieve both high efficiency and stability for commercial applications. Further compositional and interfacial engineering methods are needed to study the adoption of compositional and interfacial conditions to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. It is also important to reduce the perovskite film's surface dangling bond defects during the PSC fabrication process via post-treatment processes. The chemical structure of added molecules in the post-treatment process reduces the surface defect density and enhances the charge carrier transfer as well as the device stability. It is expected that the efficiency and stability of flexible PSCs will be greatly improved after addressing the issues of degradation and defects through materials engineering, interface engineering, substrate modification, and post-treatment approaches.
Also, we noticed that current stability results from different studies are miscellaneous, and are based on different non-standard stability-testing protocols. This renders a challenge of being able to compare the available stability results in the field, thus hindering a consensus on stability improvement for PSCs. Herein, consensus stability tests for unifying the stability evaluation are indispensable in the field and need more attention. We also urge the community to follow the discussed standardized stability test protocols, such as ISOS and IEC protocols, in future studies.
