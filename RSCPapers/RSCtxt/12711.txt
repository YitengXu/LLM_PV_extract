    , Accepted 24th August 2021First published on 7th September 2021AbstractPerovskite solar cells need a long-term thermal stability and high efficiencies for commercial viability. Unfortunately, perovskites tend to have more defects making them vulnerable to thermal decomposition. Previous research studies have explored different strategies such as surface passivation, interfacial modification, post-treatments of perovskite films with Lewis bases and acids, and photo-curing to address the challenges due to thermal instability; however, these techniques face obstacles such as the rapid phase segregation of I−Br− based perovskites, poor light and moisture stability, and low efficiency of devices. This review, therefore, discusses the technique of compositional engineering to suppress the defect states to improve the thermal stability of the device.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the new promising solar technologies in recent decades.1 These devices are made from low-cost materials and have low-temperature fabrication processes which allow them to be used in flexible and lightweight applications.2,3 Moreover, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is on-par with market-leading single crystalline silicon technology because of the remarkable optoelectronic properties of perovskites, i.e., high absorption coefficient and long carrier diffusion lengths.4 The high absorption coefficient combined with device optimizations has led to increased light management and carrier collection.5
However, due to the trap state density acting as charge recombination centers in a device,7–9 the device's PCE is still low when compared to the theoretical limit efficiency6 of roughly 30%. Furthermore, perovskites are said to be thermally unstable at even room temperature hindering their commercial viability. Different strategies such as surface passivation, interfacial modification, post-treatments of perovskite films with Lewis bases and acids, and photo-curing for high-quality perovskite films have been employed for reducing the trap state density; however, they face obstacles such as the generation of yellow δ-phase perovskites which show no photoactivity and have a chain-like structure that hampers electron transportation and as a result decreases the device performance, with rapid phase segregation of I−Br− based perovskites, and poor light and moisture stability. For these reasons, compositional engineering was applied, which entails partially or completely replacing the A, B, or X-site ions with appropriate alternatives to improve the pristine conditions.10,11 The improvements made are due to the control of the trap state density without altering the morphology and the optical properties of films12 as well as the addition of more thermally stable cations or halides in the perovskites.13,14 For example, Jacobsson et al.15 found that the optimum efficiency and thermal stability could be reached when the FA:MA and I:Br ratios were 2:1 and 5:1, respectively, from the synthesized FA(1−x)MAxPbI(3−y)Bry perovskite composition in a glove box under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere and a reasonably high flow rate to ventilate away solvent vapors using a two-step method. This was further accelerated by the strategy which has a considerable impact on the morphology of the film and leads to dramatically improved device performance, controlled defects and improved thermal stability. To date, the majority of devices with >20% PCE have used this perovskite composition.15,16 Other examples of compositional engineering have looked at the use of different A-site cations entirely. The utilization of guanidinium (GA) cations, for example, is due to their structural resemblance to FA. An experimental investigation showed a decrease in the number of recombination centers when a minor amount of MA was replaced with GA in MAPbI3,18 while a computational analysis determined a low formation energy for the replacement of FA with GA in FAPbI3.17 However, the GA compatibility with other perovskite compositions and its effect on device efficiency and lifetime remain unknown.
Likewise, Saliba et al.16 demonstrated that adding CsI to the FA(1−x)MAxPbI(3−y)Bry perovskite increases device efficiency and thermal stability. This is owing to Cs+'s small size, which reduces FAPbI3's large Goldschmidt tolerance factor,19 favoring the cubic structure14 and increasing the perovskite layer's compactness resulting from the stronger interaction of the A-site cations with the PbI3 framework.20 Additionally, the yellow α-phases of FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 have more similarities in terms of their atomistic structure and unit cell volume which promote vigorous mixing of the α-phases21 further improving the thermal stability.22 Furthermore, the antisolvent synthesis technique used on these mixed cations and halides has accelerated to an optimal efficiency, resulting in a more thermally23 and structurally stable perovskite crystallization.24 Previous studies have demonstrated that FA(1−x)MAxPbI3 perovskites with larger percentages of FA have superior thermal stability.25 The findings also show that removing MA could increase perovskite's thermal stability significantly. Furthermore, reducing defect states within perovskite crystals, as well as contaminants at grain boundaries and surfaces that might cause non-radiative recombination, increases perovskite's thermal stability.26 One of the strategies for this approach is compositional engineering.
It is known that the defects present in the absorbing layer affects both the thermal stability and the performance metrics of the ensuing solar cells.27 Previous calculation and experimental results depict that the nature and defect state density in perovskites are highly sensitive to the film deposition conditions.28 For example, Nazeeruddin et al.28 reported that defects of IPb lying at ca. −0.60 eV below the conduction band (CB) minimum are dominant in the perovskite treated from a one-step spin-coating technique, while IMA located at ca. −0.75 eV below the CB is the deep defect of perovskite films fabricated from the sequential deposition method.28 Sargent et al.29 calculated the energies formed from MAPbI3 perovskite defects under different conditions and argued that perovskites grown under iodine-rich conditions are prone to a high deep density of electronic traps30 which result into non-radiative losses in the films limiting the thermal stability and efficiency approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit.31–33 Furthermore, the defects could be created during the thermal annealing process due to the lack of stoichiometric compositions at the grain surfaces as well as the sublimation of organic molecules.34 This is because most of the defects in perovskite films are at the grain boundaries or the surface.35 Moreover, the combination of point defects and defect arrays creates a series of dimensional defects on the grain boundaries or surface due to the dangling bonds present on the crystal surface.35,36 These defects have also been visualized by Stranks et al.37 using microscale PL measurements whereby they found lesser PL intensities at the grain boundaries compared to the interiors. This implies that the grain boundaries have more defects as well as a faster non-radiative decay.
However, after pyridine passivation, the PL intensity of the film was improved by a factor of ∼8× integrated over the entire image. Furthermore, the charged ionic defects in perovskite films result into a depletion between the grain boundaries leading to either a band downward or upward bending, which may help or impede the separation of electronic charge carriers.38 For example, the accumulation of positively charged defects on an electron transport resulted in the formation of a potential barrier at the grain boundary of MAPbI3 on titanium oxide (TiO2) substrates,37 whereas a hole transport has formed a potential barrier at the grain boundaries of MAPbI3 on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) substrates.39 Therefore, the defect types affect the optoelectronic properties of grain boundaries depending on the composition of materials, properties of substrates and preparation methods.38,40
Defects causing the electronic states in the band gap of the material behave like the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination centers which tend to decrease the charge carrier lifetimes, thermal stability and photovoltaic performance, especially the VOC.41,42 The VOC is given by the maximum achievable voltage43 which is shown below: (1)where EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the elementary charge. Naturally, ΔVnonradOC can be reduced by controlling the defect density as well as the non-radiative recombination in solar cells. An EQEEL of 0.5% and ΔVnonradOC of ∼0.13 V were attained by Grätzel et al.44 through adding excess PbI2 to suppress non-radiative charge recombination in the film. Moreover, with the introduction of additional triiodide ions, the deep defects associated with interstitial Pb (Pbi) and antisite defects (MAI, PbI, IMA, and IPb) can be reduced.45
To progress further toward the thermal stability of PSCs, an approach of compositional engineering is adopted in this review. Moreover, a greater grasp of the defect states, the mechanism on defect chemistry and the significance of defects in perovskites are discussed. Next, compositional engineering as a method for decreasing the defect trap density within perovskite crystals and increasing the thermal stability are analyzed.
2. Thermal stability of Perovskite materials dependence on defect states
Some atoms may depart their usual location in the lattice due to thermal fluctuations, resulting in a defect site called a vacancy, which makes a perovskite thermally unstable.46 The defective atom could occupy the interstitial space between the lattice sites. Furthermore, an atom from the original location is replaced with an impurity atom, resulting in a substitutional defect. Schottky defects and Frenkel defects are the two primary defect pairings shown to arise in a crystal at thermal equilibrium.
Taking a MAPbI3 perovskite as an example, eqn (2) shows the creation of the I Schottky defect, while eqn (3) shows the generation of the I Frenkel defect pair.47 I0I → V+I + V−(2) I0I → V+I + I−i(3)where I0I represents an I atom occupying its perfect site, V+I represents a positively charged I vacancy defect, and I−i is a negatively charged I interstitial defect. Moreover, the thermodynamic temperature of the system and the formation energy of point defects in materials are related depending on the electronic chemical potential and atomic chemical potential.

Fig. 1 shows the illustration of the appearance of defects in a perovskite crystal lattice whereby the blue, black, and purple dots represent the A-, B-, and X-site ions (halides), respectively.

Several studies show that defects in perovskites induce deep-level traps which tend to trap either electrons or holes48 not escaping by thermal activation49 but will recombine non-radiatively as described by Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) theory.28,50 This led to thermal instability and lowering the PCE of the device.51 Moreover, computational studies on perovskite crystals employing density functional theory (DFT) have been carried out to determine the effect of defect states on the thermal stability of PSCs.49,51,54,55 A crystal structure can accommodate several defects, i.e., when one atom departs its lattice location, there are vacancies. When two oppositely charged ions depart their lattice positions, Schottky defects occur. When an atom fills a space in the crystal structure where there is usually no atom, this is known as an interstitial defect. When an impurity atom is inserted at a regular atomic position in the crystal structure, substitution faults occur and anti-site defects occur when atoms of different type exchange positions. All these contribute to lowering the PCE as well as the thermal stability of the device.
Adinofli et al.50 used a temperature-dependent space charge-limited current (SCLC) technique to investigate the density of trap states (DOST) that can be extracted from the current–voltage characteristics. Fig. 2 shows that for a single-crystal MAPbI3, the DOST appears to be localized at only about 0.2 eV from the conduction band and about 0.1 eV form the valence band. This depicts that MAPbI3 are not stable especially at high temperatures beacuse they contain both shallow holes and electron traps. Leijtens et al.52 investigated carrier dynamics using a combination of transient and steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy and found that deep traps for electrons constitute the major decay mechanism affecting the device's thermal stability.

X-ray techniques usually focus on perovskite structural parameters. Common structural phase transitions can be observed as a function of temperature, including orthorhombic–tetragonal–cubic transformations. X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments are combined to analyze the changes in bond distances. Minns et al.51 showed that for tetragonal perovskites, structural disorder can be associated with the formation of I2. Fig. 3 shows the proposed mechanism for I2 formation in MAPbI3. Using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), the formation of vacancies from the methylammonium site (VMA) and iodine site (VI) was shown which tend to affect the thermal stability. However, the loss of MA and I species did not lead to significant changes in the photoluminescence properties of the material. This is due to the fact that the VMA and VI defects lie close to or within the conduction and valence bands, respectively.53

Likewise, the thermal stability of the defects can be evaluated by calculating the defect formation energy (DFE) as a function of the Fermi level which implies low thermal stability of the device when the value is high and vice versa.56 From this, the thermodynamic ionization levels between the different charged states of a defect (q/q′) can be calculated, which is defined as the Fermi level where DFEs of two charge states are equal, i.e., (DFE (Dq) = DFE(Dq′)). Negative defects can capture holes (acceptors, q0/q−) and positive defects can capture electrons (donors, q0/q+).
Neutral defects can be ionized by the capture of electrons or holes. The thermodynamic ionization level corresponds to the oxidation and reduction potential of the defect and its position with respect to the VBM and CBM determines whether the defect will act as either a shallow or deep trap for photogenerated carriers.

Fig. 4 depicts the transition energy levels and the DFEs for defects in MAPbI3 calculated by Yin et al.55 using first-principles calculations whereby they identified the defects with low formation energies that can be found near the valence band, i.e., iodine interstitials (Ii), MA substitutional defects (MAPb) and vacancies (VMA and VPb). The formation energies of neutral defects are shown in parentheses. The acceptors/donors are ordered by the formation energies (from left to right). In the conduction band, they found MAi, PbMA, and, VI with low formation energies. All these defects have transition energy levels within or close above the valence (conduction) band and are considered to affect the thermal stability. Moreover, the defects with deep transition levels cause thermal instability to perovskites due to their high formation energies. Some defects have transitions where, for example, two electrons are involved (Pbi, (1+/3+)). These defects have low capture cross-sections which make trapping more unlikely.

Similar to Yin et al.,33 other theoretical studies suggest that Pb2+, I− and MA+ vacancies are predominant and only create shallow traps. On the other hand, it can be argued that simple trapping and un-trapping of photogenerated charge might not give a complete picture. The slow charge carrier dynamics and thermal stability-threatening phenomena, such as current–voltage hysteresis, are not readily explained by the presence of shallow traps and only the limited amount of deep level traps. Ion defect transport has been widely observed in perovskite materials which lowers the PCE and device thermal stability.57 Eames et al.54 carried out calculations in order to examine the pathways and relative activation energy for the vacancy-mediated migration of the cations and anions. They proposed a hopping mechanism as shown in Fig. 5. Using transition-state calculations between the adjacent sites, they mapped out energy profiles for these mechanisms. The lowest activation energy was found for iodide ions, which was 0.58 eV compared to 0.84 eV and 2.31 eV for MA+ and Pb2+, respectively, which depicts the thermal stability for iodide ions as compared to other ions. Their findings further highlighted that iodine vacancy-assisted diffusion is favorable since this migration pathway is more ideal as it does not involve motion through the unit cell and they argued that the high activation energy for Pb2+ arises from the immobile Pb sub-lattice. Other theoretical studies support the proposed general mechanism; the ion mobility is directly related by the transport activation energy and the hopping distance.58 In these studies, the iodine ion is also confirmed as both the thermally stable and mobile ion.58,59 Recently, iodine interstitial defects were identified as the main source for trapping electrons and holes in MAPbI3.49 While earlier research suggested that defects with low formation energies generate shallow traps, more recent high-level calculations using hybrid DFT revealed that iodine interstitials do, in fact, cause deep levels in the MAPbI3 band gap.60 Meggiolare et al.49 performed DFT calculations that included both dispersion correlation corrections and spin–orbit coupling. They calculated that interstitial iodine can lead to a deep trap for both electrons and holes at the +/0 and 0/− ionization levels placed at 0.57 and 0.29 eV below and above the CB and VB edges, respectively.

Furthermore, Meggiolare et al.49 found that the various charge states of interstitial iodine (Ii) result in different local geometrical structures during their study on the photochemistry of the defect states; Fig. 6a represents the positive Ii+ state in a trimer structure of a coordinated I3 molecule which is an electron trap (+/0); Fig. 6b shows the neutral I0i state in which iodine formed a bridged dimer and Fig. 6c represents the negatively charged I−i which is a hole trap (0/−) with a similar structure to that of I0i.

Using the description of minimum energy structures to each charged state of interstitial iodine, the trapping pathway can be visualized according to a global configuration diagram. Fig. 6d depicts that the trapping of an electron in Ii+ marked with 1 in red results in a structural relaxation to the I0i (a) depicted in black formed by 2. The thermodynamic barrier is only 0.10 eV above the I0i (b) local minimum. Process 3 in green marks the pathway to untrap the electron to go back to the Ii+ state. If a hole is trapped as in yellow by process 4 to form the I0i (a) state, there is no barrier and the structural rearrangement is limited. This implies that the hole trapping and un-trapping processes are fast. Moreover, because of the enormous lattice reorganization required for electron trapping at positive interstitials, trapping and recombination take a long time.
To support the computational findings, steady-state photoluminescence on poly-crystalline thin films was used. Radiative recombination is found at energies below the band gap because interstitial iodine traps are sub-band gap states. Fig. 6e, in fact, reveals the weak emission in the 1.35–1.15 eV range, below the radiative recombination from the band gap (1.58 eV). Also, at increased excitation energies, quenching of emission is observed. This is expected from radiative trap-assisted recombination since increasing excitation will saturate the traps, which have no time to recombine radiatively. There is also a slow component which does not match any radiative feature, but follows the photo-current, and therefore is suggested to arise from the non-radiative recombination of free holes with electrons trapped by Ii+ as arrow 3 in Fig. 6d. Fig. 6f shows the photoluminescence, which corresponds to the fast band-to-band radiative recombination.
If electrons are trapped, it takes a long time before they recombine and therefore, they will remain inactive for a long period. Trap filling for a long time reduces the effective trap density, which has direct effects on the device's thermal stability. Leijtens et al.52 determined the quasi-Fermi level splitting by estimating the steady-state carrier dynamics and with this calculation, the VOC for different trap situations as shown in Table 1.52 In the ideal case of defect-free perovskites, when only bimolecular recombination occurs, the VOC is 1.30 V. Short-lived carriers reduce the VOC to 1.14 V, whereas increasing the lifetime of the holes increases the value by 0.12 V, creating a VOC close to the Shockley–Queisser limit. This improves both the PCE and the thermal stability.

Defects affect the kinetics and/or thermodynamics of the relevant devices during charge recombination, ion migration, and degradation, affecting their thermal stability.35 As shown in Section 3, effective defect suppression in perovskites not only reduces non-radiative recombination centers to enhance efficiency, but also delays their deterioration under thermal stresses to improve the thermal stability considerably.61
3. Suppressing defect states via compositional engineering to improve the thermal stability
Compositional engineering is a technique that involves partial or complete replacement of the A, B, or X-site ions with appropriate alternatives to improve the perovskite structure due to the ability of adjusting other intrinsic material properties directly, resulting in higher-quality perovskites with both improved device performance and stability. Cation62,63 and halide64,65 compositional engineering has been used to suppress the defect states, and improve the thermal stability as well as PCE of perovskites. In this section, we discuss the compositional engineering techniques based on the A-site, B-site and X-halides with partial or full substitution.
3.1 Compositional engineering through A-site cations
A-site mixed cation-based perovskites result in low defects, improved thermal stability at high temperatures and enhanced PCE of devices.30
For example, Meng et al.66 investigated the thermal stability of (FAPbI3)1−xMAPb(Br3−yCly)x perovskites in air atmosphere. Their findings demonstrate that increasing the heat treatment temperature from 25 to 250 °C caused the MA-perovskite to disintegrate into PbI2, lowering the device's PCE in less than 20 minutes. This was attributed to the increase of defect density from 3.87 × 1017 cm−3 to 9.03 × 1017 cm−3. However, correct heat treatment duration, i.e., 10 min, at a certain temperature, i.e., 85 °C, effectively controlled the defects which led to a thermally stabilized PCE of 16.50% which was retained to about 80% of the initial PCE even after 70 min under the same conditions as in Fig. 7. Similarly, the spin-coating synthesis approach improved the film's morphology and crystallization, resulting in a more thermally stable perovskite.

Eperon et al.67 and Aharon et al.68 compared PSC devices based on formamidinium (FA) lead trihalide (HC(NH2)2PbI3) and MAPbI3. They found that the thermal stability of FA-based devices is higher, i.e., 290 °C, as compared to MAPbI3, i.e., ∼230 °C.68 This high thermal stability of FA-based perovskites is due to the low defect states within the device compared to MA-based ones having defects between 1016 and 1017 cm−3.30 The combination of MA/FA proved to be a success, with MA working as a stabilizer of the black phase of the FA perovskite. However, traces of the yellow phase were always present, even in highly efficient devices which inhibits the charge collection efficiency.13 To overcome this problem, inorganic materials such as Cs and Rb are incorporated to reduce the defect states, and as a result, the device thermal stability and high efficiency are increased69 as shown in Fig. 8.

Saliba et al.16 demonstrated a perovskite using all three cations, i.e., Cs, MA and FA. Their findings revealed a perovskite with a thermally stabilized PCE at 21.1% and about 85% of the initial PCE was retained for 250 h and at 85–250 °C as shown in Fig. 9. This is due to the suppression effect of the halide segregation of the I–Br based perovskite and lowering the defects to 1014cm−3.

The high efficiency and thermal stability of A-cation mixed perovskites are related to the improved defect tolerance properties and lower defect densities. It has been estimated that the incorporation of Cs can reduce the trap density of FA0.83MA0.17Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 from 2.5 × 1015 to 8.0 × 1014cm−3.69 This trap reduction minimizes the charge recombination which influences the thermal stability by keeping almost 87% of the initial PCE under continuous illumination of 80 °C and 250 h.
Choi et al.70 presented methylammonium lead iodide perovskites (CsxMA1−xPbI3) which demonstrate that adding a little amount of Cs results in a controlled defect concentration of 1014 cm−3, a thermally stabilized perovskite film with PCEs of 8%. The synthesis strategy of spin-casting at 5000 rpm for 90 seconds and drying on a hot-plate at 110 °C for 10 minutes aided this. Moreover, their findings revealed that the device retained about 92% of the initial PCE even above 75 °C for more than 1000 h as shown in Fig. 10. The addition of Cs to the absorbent layer improves the thermal stability by allowing for more effective control of defect states and enhanced film shape. Furthermore, Park et al.22 found that Cs/FA combinations had improved thermal stability, with PCEs of 16.5%. The action of Cs in facilitating the crystallization of the black phase in FA perovskites due to entropic stabilization is responsible for the increased thermal stability.71 Furthermore, the Cs+ incorporation leads to larger perovskite grains, lower trap densities and longer charge carrier lifetimes improving the PCE.22

On the other hand, partial substitution with even smaller rubidium cations (Rb+) stabilizes the active black phase of FAPbI3, while pure RbPbI3 only crystallizes in the photo-inactive δ-phase.72 Park et al.,72 on the other hand, found that the rubidium-smaller cation's ionic radius has a greater impact on the perovskite crystal structure of FAPbI3. The resulting performing solar cell maintained 97% of the initial PCE over 1000 hours and 25 °C at an average relative humidity (RH) of 55%, as shown in Fig. 11. This is because, rubidium acts as a passivation layer, which reduces the defect density at the grain boundaries.

Further attempts to stabilize MAPbI3 were performed by inserting small amounts of the bigger guanidinium-cation [C(NH2)3+, GA] into the host lattice, which improves the thermal stability, i.e., GA0.25MA0.75PbI3 keeps 90% of the initial PCE for up to 1000 h at 60°C under continuous light illumination and MPP tracking in an argon atmosphere73 as shown in Fig. 12, due to the increased number of H–I bonds interacting with the inorganic framework. H-bonding enhancement is also thought to improve grain size, free defect density, charge carrier transit at the interface, and passivation of under-coordinated iodine within grain boundaries.74 The FA-based PSCs have made significant development as well by using the FA1−xMAxPb(I1−yBry)3 perovskite composition; however, when compared to the market-leading silicon solar cells, the PSC efficiency and thermal stability are still low.75 Saliba et al.16 published a cesium-containing triple-cation perovskite composition (FA0.95−xMAxCs0.05Pb(I1−yBry)3) in 2016, which had much enhanced thermal stability, fewer defect states, and phase impurities than earlier perovskite compositions. This resulted in a stabilized power output of over 21% under continuous one sun illumination over 200 hours.

Considering that the bandgap of the triple-cation perovskite is as high as 1.63 eV, while the VOC of the PSCs achieved was only ∼1.15 V, there was still a significant VOC loss compared to that of the commercial silicon solar cells; this loss is accelerated by the defect states present in the perovskite film which further hamper the thermal stability of the perovskite.16 Controlling defect densities, on the other hand, is critical for improving both the thermal stability and PCE. Saliba et al.76 published a quadruple-cation perovskite composition using the Rb cation in combination with a triple-cation perovskite composition that showed a thermally stabilized PCE of 21.6% after 500 hours of exposure to the sun at 85 °C. Other studies have found that K mixed triple-cation perovskite-based PSCs have improved thermal stability due to regulated defect states and increased perovskite film quality.77,78 Pellet et al.79 used a blend of MA and FA cations to create an FA1−xMAxPbI3 perovskite. Surprisingly, the composition maintained the majority of the FAPbI3 broad absorbance range, with no phase impurities, no defects, better crystalline, thermal stability, and a superior PCE of 15%.

3.2 Compositional engineering through B-site cations
Perovskites can create multi-layered compositions on the same chemical formula with minimal to negligible defect states, improving both the thermal stability and PCE by varying the inclusion of B-site cations.80
Ogomi et al.81 noted a thermal stabilized PCE of 4.18% whereby 98% of the initial PCE was retained when they fabricated a CH3NH3SnxPb(1−x)I3 perovskite after 100 hours of exposure to the sun at 55 °C. This has been accelerated by the suppression of defect states and morphological improvement of the film, especially on a low-bandgap perovskite. Using a two-step perovskite fabrication technique, the efficiency was raised to 14.14%. Yan et al.82 demonstrated FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3-based inverted perovskite solar cells with a thermally stabilized PCE of 13.6% and a negligible current–voltage hysteresis. Furthermore, after 30 days in a glove box, the unencapsulated cells maintained 80% of their initial PCE as seen in Fig. 13. The enhanced thermal stability is accelerated by the two-step synthesis strategy, reduced recombination and improved charge transportation caused by the vertically aligned larger grains, free defects and higher crystallinity in the perovskite film.

Filip et al.83 considered the thermal stability, PCE and desired bandgap as two concurrent prerequisites for suitable candidates of MAGeI3 perovskites under 75 °C and 1000 h. Their findings further showed that about 90% of the initial PCE was retained. They concluded that replacing Pb with Mg might possibly minimize defect states, increase thermal stability, and improve the device's PCE. Recently, Wang et al.84 showed that Cu, Ag, Bi, and Sb can also be used to substitute Pb in perovskites, resulting in fewer defect states, increased PCE, and enhanced thermal stability. In addition, when homovalent elements are substituted, Sn-based perovskites display a stronger s–p antibond coupling towards the maximum value of the valence band (VBM) than Pb-based perovskites.85 This is due to the Sn 5s lone pair being shallower and more active than the Pb 6s lone pair. Furthermore, the Sn 5p orbital is shallower and less dispersive than the Pb 6p orbitals due to the substantially weaker spin–orbit coupling (SOC).
Unfortunately, defect calculations revealed that the high-energy Sn 5s2 state renders the Sn–I bond easier to break, resulting in high-density Sn vacancies in the Sn-based perovskite,85 resulting in an extremely high defect density (>1017 cm−3). Similar to Sn-based perovskites, Ming et al.86 found that the Ge vacancy is the major defect in Ge-based perovskites, with shallow transition levels and low formation enthalpy, yielding high-density holes, primarily under Ge-poor synthesis conditions. At the same time, Sun et al.87 demonstrated the thermal stability of MAGeI3 and MASnI3 under the temperature of 75 °C and 1000 h. Their results show that 92% of the initial PCE was retained for Ge-based perovskites and 65% of the initial PCE was retained for Sn perovskites. This revealed a better thermal stability on Ge-based perovskites compared to Sn-based perovskites. In addition, the thermal stability has been accelerated by the low defect states within the MAGeI3 compared to MASnI3. The calculated band structure showed that the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band are very dispersed corresponding to low electron/hole effective masses. This implies that the replacement of Pb in perovskites by Ge is also possible.
The defect calculations revealed that most defects with low formation energies yield deep level states in the bandgap, which act as recombination centers,88 in a theoretical analysis of heterovalent replacement using Cs3Bi2I9 as an example. Fortunately, the thermal stability of this sort of perovskite material has been projected to be outstanding. Table 3 shows the B-cation mixed compositions, level of defect density, treatment conditions and the state of thermal stability.

3.3 Compositional engineering through X-site halides
Iodide can be partially or completely substituted by bromide or chloride in halide compositional engineering to modify the material's optoelectronic properties and improve the thermal stability.24,89 Although chloride is too small to directly substitute iodide in the APbX3 lattice, its presence in the perovskite precursor solution results in low defect states, and improved absorbing layer crystallization, thermal stability and PCE of the device.90 Misra et al.91 compared two different precursors for preparing the perovskite materials, PbI2 and PbBr2, and after performing accelerated aging tests in sealed PSCs concluded that the MAPbI3 device suffers degradation after 60 minutes of exposure to 100 suns and temperatures between 45 and 55 °C, while the MAPbBr3 device did not decompose the perovskite material as shown in Fig. 14. This is due to the fact that the Pb–Br and Pb–I bonds are shorter and stronger than the Pb–I bond, making them more difficult to break, as well as the fact that the Br-added halides have fewer defect states than their iodide counterparts. Moreover, the film's binding strengths and crystalline formation have improved as a result of the two-synthesis approach.

Tan et al.92 examined the thermal stability of the Cs0.17FA0.83Pb0.7Sn0.3(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite in a relative humidity of about 60% and temperature of 127 °C. The study revealed that the thermally stabilized PCE was above 18% and retained the initial PCE to over 92% after 500 h under the prescribed conditions, as shown in Fig. 15. The thermal improvement is accelerated by the lessened defect on the perovskite due to the partial addition of Br. Similarly, the addition of Br− has also been demonstrated to increase the defect tolerance properties of perovskites.

Angelis et al.49 discovered that bromide ions can substitute interstitial iodides and shift defect energy levels by 0.3 eV towards the valence band, resulting in the transformation of mixed-halide interstitial deep traps into shallow traps, which are less harmful according to the SRH recombination model as shown in Fig. 16. The Br-added samples had a significantly longer PL decay, which is consistent with the hypothesized curing of deep defects. The trap passivation action caused by the bromide ions improves the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells.

To modify film formation, a non-stoichiometric solution of PbI2 and organic iodide was successfully used. Excess PbI2 has been shown to effectively suppress non-radiative charge recombination in perovskite films by Tress et al.,44 resulting in a thermally stabilized PCE of 20.8% of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 films under AM1.5 sunshine. Further analysis revealed that about 90% of the initial PCE was retained when the device is illuminated at the same intensity and 70 °C for 600 h. This was possible due to the effective control of defects that were eliminated by the deposition of a PCBM overlayer. It is also important to note that the role of excess PbI2 depends on the fabrication methods and the location of PbI2 in perovskite films.93 For example, the excess PbI2 introduced by the two-step spin-coating method can decrease the defect density at the interface. By controlling the dipping time of PbI2 films in MAI solution, the residual PbI2 could modify the perovskite/TiO2 interface.94 It was also found that the trap density of TiO2 could be decreased from 1016 cm−3 to 1012 cm−3 and 1011 cm−3.95 Moreover, the presence of PbI2 at the interface could inhibit the back electron transfer from TiO2 to the valence band of the perovskite which can affect the thermal stability by causing charge recombination.96
According to the characterization results from transmission electron microscopy, Liao et al.97 found that excess PbI2 is mainly included in the grains for one-step solution processing, which can increase the grain size and improve the crystallinity of perovskite films; this enhances the thermal stability by lowering the defect states. The excess PbI2 can also be introduced by annealing perovskite films. The majority of the degraded PbI2 is thought to be located near the grain boundaries,98,99 because the decomposition begins with MA exiting the grain boundaries. PbI2 at grain boundaries was discovered to have a passivation effect and boost contact selectivity.
Similarly, Khatiwada et al.100 investigated the effects of annealing temperatures on single and mixed halide perovskites, finding that single-halide perovskites do not display significant changes in defect states, film morphology, or crystal size when annealing temperatures are increased, as compared to mixed-halide perovskites. However, high-temperature annealing favorably enhanced the thermal stability of mixed-halide PSCs by retaining 80% of the initial PCE at 150 °C and over 700 h as shown in Fig. 17. This is due to the reduced defect states, and enhanced film morphology and crystal grain sizes in mixed-halide perovskites (MAPbI3−xClx).

The iodine/bromine site occupancy factors for all overall compositions are shown in Fig. 18 and the spinodal composition of I–Br halides in Fig. 19. With the increasing bromine content, the iodine site occupancy factors (S.O.F.) in the iodine-rich single-phase area decrease nearly linearly.101 This is consistent with Vegard's law, which states that the lattice parameters are linearly dependent. Bromine incorporation into the crystal structure of MAPbI3 occurs as an ideal solid solution in this composition range. The iodine-rich phase rapidly integrates the bromine into a two-phase region (0.29 (±0.02) ≤ x ≤ 0.92 (±0.02)), over up to 80% of the composition range. However, the fraction of this phase declines at the same time, and an increase in the amount of the bromine-rich phase is observed. There was no evidence of bromine being substituted for iodine, and the bromine-rich phase refines to pure MAPbBr3. It is worth noting that in the two-phase region, a continuous shift in the lattice parameter for iodine-rich compositions occurs, indicating the partial solubility of bromine in iodine crystals, whereas no iodine substitution was found in the bromine-rich phase.101

Moreover, Chiang et al.101 used a one-step hot solution spin-coating approach using the precursor solution of halogens Cl and Br to create high-quality mixed-halide MAPb(I/Br/Cl)3 perovskite films that preserved around 82% of their initial PCE under continual illumination of 60 °C for 200 hours. This was attributed to the presence of Br which helped to reduce the defect states, increase the Voc values and improve the device thermal stability. Fig. 20 shows a similar research in which single- and mixed-halide PSCs were made using MAPbI3−yCly, MAPbI3−yBry, and MAPbI3. As a consequence, the use of Br helped to enhance the thermal stability due to the suppression of the defect states of the device while Cl positively impacted the film morphology as well as the charge transport processes.102

Likewise Jeon et al.103 and Noh et al.104 reported that a substitution of 10–15 mol% Br− for I− in MAPbI3 can improve the thermal stability and efficiency of the PSCs. Furthermore, an efficiency of 16.2% was achieved for the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.1–0.15) composition-based PSCs whereby about 70% of its initial PCE was retained under ambient conditions and 900 h.103 This is due to the reduced defects. Excitingly, although Cl− does not substitute I− of MAPbI3, it plays a great role on passivating defects which improves the carrier diffusion length which results in a thermally stabilized PCE of the corresponding PSCs.105 Though the efficiency and thermal stability of MA-based PSCs have been greatly improved, particularly a PCE of around 20% was achieved utilizing various approaches, one of which was defect suppression by compositional engineering,106,107 it is still far from the final commercialization.108
Since 2015, Yang et al.109 found that adding more Br− halides to the mixed composition of the PSCs could improve their efficiency and thermal stability. The addition of Br− halides was found to reduce defect development, which aids in the crystallization of the perovskite layer. This results in improved morphology and thermal stability by retaining 80% of the initial PCE under a temperature of 50 °C and 1000 h of the final perovskite composition FA1−xMAxPb(I1−yBry)3. Table 4 shows the X-halide mixed compositions, levels of defect density, treatment conditions and the state of thermal stability.

If the difference between the ionic radii of the substitution partners is less than 15% and the crystal structures are isotypic, solid solutions are more likely to form.92 The difference between the ionic radii of iodine and chlorine calculated is roughly 21%. As a result, a low miscibility is expected. For all samples with less than 3.0 mol% Cl in the overall anion content, the synchrotron experimental data clearly reveal single-phased solid solution powders. A phase separation occurs above this number, resulting in the formation of two phases. The particle diffraction pattern identifies this second phase as MAPCl. When the Cl level is increased to 36.7 mol%, the phase composition remains essentially the same, with an increasing fraction of the MAPCl phase.92
The iodine-rich margin of the miscibility gap could already be identified as 2.65 ± 0.35 mol% Cl/(Cl + I) from the initial appearance of MAPCl. For the sample having entirely 3.0 mol% Cl, semi-quantitative phase analysis using the Rietveld method revealed that the amount of the MAPCl phase was only 0.3 (1) wt%, equivalent to 0.5 (1) mol%.
Conclusions
This review has demonstrated that compositional engineering is essential in controlling trap state density and improving thermal stability. Furthermore, the technique of defect suppression in A-site, B-site, or X-site compositions has resulted in thermally stable perovskite solar cells. These findings contribute towards developing rational fabrication methods in future to create thermally stable materials approaching theoretical limits.

 	Fig. 19  Spinodal composition of the halide perovskite. (a) The effect of source/substrate temperature and chamber pressure on the type and morphologies of the halide perovskite is depicted in this diagram. The location of the appropriate mixed halide perovskite can thus be determined. The inset depicts the typical growth results of pure Br perovskite morphologies. (b) The I/Br mixed halide perovskite has a schematic phase diagram. The spinodal decomposition of the as-grown single-phase material with I composition of X0, aided by the photon, would result in coherent α1 and α2 phases. (c) Mixed halide perovskite atomic model. Once the phase separation is complete, the Br-rich and I-rich phases should emit completely different PL colors following laser excitation. (d) Schematics of the photon promoted diffusion in microscopic scale under photon illumination. (e) The type-I band alignment of the two perovskite phases resulted in a diagram of electron and hole quenching at the I-rich phase. (f) Schematics of the phonon mismatch (upper part) giving rise to the phonon confinement. The equations at the bottom show the quantized phonon wave vectors and the Fröhlich electron–phonon interaction Hamiltonian.
