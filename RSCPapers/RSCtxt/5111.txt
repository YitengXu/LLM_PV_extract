    , Accepted 30th November 2018First published on 3rd December 2018AbstractAimed at high-efficiency biomimetic CO2 photoelectrochemical conversion, a bio-proton coupling metal-complex/semiconductor hybrid photoelectrocatalytic interface (Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O) was constructed by covalently modifying an in situ proton-transfer functionized molecular catalyst (Ru-BNAH) on the surface of a TiO2/Cu2O composite semiconductor substrate electrode. Due to the excellent proton coupling of the bio-proton carrier, the light current density in a CO2 atmosphere of the prepared Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photoelectrocatalytic interface was twice as high as that without a proton carrier under the same conditions. Simultaneously, based on the excellent photosensitivity of the metal oxide substrate, the photogenerated electrons could rapidly transfer to the molecular catalyst for efficient CO2 reduction in a water medium. After 8 h irradiation at −0.9 V potential, the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photoelectrocatalytic interface produced 409.5 μmol formic acid, which was 2.44 times more than that without a proton transfer carrier. In addition, the in situ UV-visible absorption spectra and in situ Raman spectra indicated that the proton transport carrier supplied protons during CO2 reduction. Moreover, the generation of HCOO− in CO2-saturated D2O medium confirmed the proton (H) originated from the proton transfer carrier rather than the solvent (D2O).
Introduction
Due to an escalating rate of fossil fuel combustion, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has reached unprecedented levels and continues to increase, causing concern about climate change and rising sea levels.1,2 The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce chemicals and fuels (such as formic acid, methane and methanol) is regarded as an effective way to solve the problem of global warming and energy crisis attributed to the inexhaustible supply of solar energy.3–6 The photoelectrocatalytic conversion of CO2 has thus been attracting more and more attention on account as photoelectrocatalysis can synergize the advantages of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis.7–9
Molecular catalysts represent a series of metal–organic complexes equipped with a metal ion catalytic centre that displays excellent CO2 reduction activity or hydrogen evolution activity.10,11 Thanks to the metal ion catalytic site, the molecular catalysts have high selectivity for formic acid or CO in CO2 reduction, but without the formation of multiple electron reduction products, such as methanol.12–15 Therefore, CO2 reduction oriented by molecular catalysts has attracted deep attention in the field of CO2 transformation.16 Although molecular catalysts used for CO2 reduction have achieved remarkable results in recent years, the proton coupling process in the CO2 reduction process still restricts the efficiency of the reaction. Though CO2 could convert to various hydrogenated products (such as formic acid, methanol and methane) with the proton coupling process, the simplest product is formic acid, which is generated from activated CO2 with a two-electron migration and one-proton coupling process.8 The use of a biomimetic redox mediator/redox cofactor can provide useful reference information for the proton coupling reaction.17
In the photosynthesis process, NADH, as a derivative of N-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, plays a vital role in maintaining the cell differentiation, in the polysaccharide repairing and in proton transfer of the organism for oxidation/reduction.3,18 The NAD+/NADH couple is a ubiquitous redox mediator/redox cofactor in chloroplast, distinctive for its proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactivity based on C–H bond cleavage/formation reactions with NADH providing C–H-based hydride equivalents.19–21 To further investigate the proton-transfer process, numerous scientists have conducted extensive research on the application of NADH in bionics.22,23 The pivotal reactive group of NADH is a 1,4-dihydronicotinamide derivative. NADH can provide equivalent protons to the oxidation material in the changes of 1,4-dihydronicotinamide into niacinamide. In order to elucidate the proton-transfer process of NADH more conveniently and effectively, numerous NADH substitutes have been widely exploited due to its complex structure and unstable chemical property. N-Benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) which is equipped with a 1,4-dihydronicotinamide structure, is one of the most widely used substitutes, attributed to its simpler structure and stable performance.24,25 However, when BNAH was employed as a proton donor, it generally worked well in an organic system rather than in aqueous solution due to its inferior solubility in aqueous solution.26 In addition, more than 10 eq. BNAH was needed to ensure enough protons were supplied for the reduction to run successfully.27 For improving the efficiency of the proton transference, it was useful and convenient to change the proton migration style from intermolecular to intramolecular. In view of the organic properties of these two components, covalently bonding BNAH on the molecular catalyst was an optimal method to achieve such an integration. For many precious-metal centre molecular catalysts, it is necessary to minimize the amount of required catalyst as much as possible.28 Heterogenizing the homogeneous catalyst by binding the molecular catalyst directly onto the surface of the photocathode is a feasible strategy, which not only decreases the amount of molecular catalyst required but also restrains parasitic light absorption in the homogeneous system caused by the inherent dark colour of the molecular catalyst.16,29–31
When it comes to the metal oxide substrate electrode, TiO2 is one of the optimal choices thanks to its photostability, which protects otherwise unstable photocathode materials (such as Cu2O).32,33 The metal oxide mixture constitutes an ideal photoelectrochemical carrier for the covalent binding of molecules by molecular linking groups, such as carboxylates or phosphonates. A number of examples of molecular catalysts linked to the surfaces of photocathodes have been developed due to the attractive prospect of decreasing the catalyst loading while retaining the efficiency.28,34 However, in situ proton-supplying systems for CO2 reduction are rarely utilized.
Hence, this manuscript demonstrates a photoelectro-catalytic system for formic acid production as a solar fuel by the covalent attachment of molecular CO2 reduction catalysts equipped with a proton carrier on the surface of TiO2-protected Cu2O photocathodes by means of carbonic ester linkers (as shown in Scheme 1). The photosensitivity of the metal oxide semiconductor provides electrons for the molecular catalyst, while the BNAH proton carrier supplies the protons in situ, and thus CO2 can be effectively reduced on the Ru(II) catalytic site of the molecular catalyst. Under the photoelectrocatalytic reduction, the catalytic system equipped with a BNAH proton carrier produced formic acid in twice as high an amount as that in the absence of the BNAH proton carrier. In situ UV-visible absorption spectra and Raman spectroscopy were employed to explain the probable proton transfer and CO2 reduction mechanism. An isotopic-labelling experiment was employed to confirm that BNAH supplied the protons in situ proton during the CO2 reduction process.

Experimental section
Preparation of the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photoelectrocatalytic interface
The TiO2/Cu2O nanocomposites were prepared as follows.35,36 With constant stirring, TiO2 (P25, 1 eq.) was added into an ethanol solution (100 mL) containing copper(II) acetate dihydrate (200 mg, 1 mmol) and then stirred at 60 °C for 30 min to obtain a uniform suspension. Subsequently, 100 mL glucose aqueous solution (0.2 mol L−1) and 120 mL NaOH aqueous solution (0.3 mol L−1) were added into the suspension dropwise consecutively. After stirring at such temperature for 15 min, the mixture was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were collected by filtration, washed by deionized water and ethanol 3 times and then dried at 40 °C in vacuum.
The freshly prepared TiO2/Cu2O nanoparticles were immobilized on fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) as the substrate electrode. Generally, to a suspension of TiO2/Cu2O (50 mg) in acetone (50 mL), I2 (10 mg) was added under continuous stirring. After that, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 5 min to give the electrolyte solution. FTO and Pt plates were used as the cathode and anode respectively. They were immersed in the solution in parallel at a distance of 1.5 cm, and 10 V of voltage was added for 10 min using a DC power supply. The electrode was used directly after drying in vacuum at 40 °C for 12 h.
The brief synthesis route of Ru-BNAH is shown in Scheme 2 and the specific procedures are listed in the ESI.† The Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photocathode interface was prepared as per the following. Ru-BNAH (50 mg) was added to N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 50 mL), and then TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrodes were added to the above solution. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for at least 8 h under the protection of N2 to achieve saturation adsorption. The electrodes were taken out, washed with acetonitrile and dried in vacuum at 40 °C for 4 h to give the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photocathode catalytic interface.

Chemical and structural characterizations
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultra HSA, Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK) was used for the surface element analysis of the prepared catalyst. All the binding energy values for the high-resolution spectra were calibrated with the signal of contaminated carbon C 1s at 284.8 eV. The crystal structures of the synthesized TiO2/Cu2O were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Focus D8, Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The 1H NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-7000) was employed to characterize the steady-state fluorescence spectra of Ru-BNAH. The absorption spectra were obtained using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis, Agilent 8453).
A CHI660C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA) was employed to collect all the PEC performance data by using a conventional three-electrode system with the as-prepared electrode as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution. All the potentials were referenced to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) unless stated otherwise. A standard two-compartment electrolysis cell, which separated the cathode and anode reactions, was used for controlling the potential CO2 reduction in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution supporting the electrolyte. The amperometric i–t curve was recorded with an interval of 200 s for light on/off under the light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at a constant potential of −0.6 V (light source: LA-410UV, Hayashi, Japan).
PEC reduction of CO2 and products detection
The PEC reduction of CO2 proceeded under a typical three-electrode-system in a 100 mL homemade double-chamber reactor, which was divided with a proton-exchange membrane. Typically, 100 mL 0.1 M KCl solution was added as the electrolyte solution. The Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O-loaded FTO working electrode and Ag/AgCl (filled with saturated KCl) reference electrode were placed in the cathodic chamber, while a graphite plate counter electrode was placed in the anodic chamber. A 2 cm−2 quartz window was placed on the cathode chamber to view the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Generally, a 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution (100 mL) was added to the reactor and then bubbled with high purity CO2 (99.99%) gas at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 for 40 min to completely remove the dissolved oxygen. The potential during the PEC reduction was kept constant at −0.6 V under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation (light source: PLS-SXE300 xenon lamp, Beijing Perfect Light Co., Ltd, China, with AM 1.5 filter). Note that the water used for all the solutions preparation was ultrapure with its conductivity reaching 18.2 MΩ cm.
The products in the aqueous phase were determined by Nash's reagent method (as described in the ESI†). The gaseous samples were tested for the potential products from CO2 reduction, such as CO, methane, ethylene and ethane, by injecting into a Shimadzu GC-2014C gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 5 Å molecular filled column.
Results and discussion
Construction of the proton-coupling functional interface
Complexes based on Ru(II), Re(II) and Ir(II) have shown excellent performance as well as robustness when used as homogeneous photoelectrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2. Simultaneously, for low-cost p-type light harvesters for water splitting, TiO2-protected Cu2O photocathodes take up an important position. Carboxyl linking groups were employed to enable the BNAH-linked Ru(II) complex (Ru-BNAH) to covalently bond on the surface of the TiO2-protected Cu2O photocathode.
XRD showed that the diffraction peaks of TiO2 and Cu2O in the TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrode were all represented. As shown in Fig. S1,† the diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 25.26°, 37.77°, 47.98°, 54.01°, 54.01°, 62.70° and 68.86°, corresponding to the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (116) planes of typical anatase TiO2. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra (DRS) were recorded to characterize the optical performance of the TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrode. As shown in Fig. S2,† the prepared TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrode had a remarkable optical absorption performance in the UV-visible region, and the absorption band edge could extend to nearly 650 nm, which indicated the effective harvesting of UV-visible light. In order to maintain the light absorption and to decrease the photocorrosion performance of TiO2/Cu2O nanoparticles, TiO2/Cu2O (1:1) nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the surface of FTO to prepare the substrate photocathode for CO2 reduction. The band gap value of the prepared TiO2/Cu2O nanoparticles was 2.02 eV, which was attributed to the intrinsic properties of Cu2O, while the values of pure TiO2 and Cu2O were 3.2 eV and 2.06 eV, respectively.
The Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O catalytic interface was obtained by refluxing the TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrode in a solution of Ru-BNAH in ethanol. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted (as shown in Fig. 1) to examine the chemical composition and chemical status of the constituent elements in the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O catalytic interface. Referring to Fig. 1a, the XPS survey spectra depicted that C, N, O, Ti, Cu and Ru elements were detected in the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O sample. The binding energy was calibrated against the reference C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The N 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks: peaks centred at 398.9 and 401.7 eV derived from the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms in CN–C groups and a peak at around 400.5 eV, attributed to the tertiary nitrogen N–C3 groups of the ligand. In the Cu 2p3/2 core level XPS spectra, the peaks corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 were observed at 932.6 and 951.2 eV and could be assigned to Cu2O.37 Further, the existence of the two shake-up satellite peaks, one in the range 938–948 eV and the other at 961.8 eV in the spectra also reiterated the chemical state of copper in the nanocomposite as a little Cu2+ (CuO) caused by the oxidation of Cu2O.38 The major peak at 570.1 eV in the CuLMM auger spectra further substantiated the presence of copper(I) oxide (As shown in Fig. S3†).39 The peaks at 284.8 and 288.2 eV were assigned to the CN coordination and sp2-hybridized carbon in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN), respectively. Additionally, the binding energy of Ru(II) 3p3/2 at 282.3 eV overlapped with C 1s. Ru(III) was not detected with the binding energy at 282 eV, which indicated no other phases of the Ru complex were present.

As a typical inorganic–organic hybrid catalytic interface, the electron migration between the components is an important element to evaluate the catalytic performance. The photoluminescence spectra were introduced to investigate the photogenerated electron migration trend of the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photoelectrocatalytic interface. Under 325 nm irradiation excitation, TiO2 had a strong fluorescence at the maximum emission wavelength of 400 nm (Fig. 2a), which belonged to the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole in excited TiO2. By coupling the Cu2O nanoparticles, the fluorescence intensity clearly decreased more than that of the same weight of TiO2, indicating the favourable fluorescence quenching of the Cu2O nanoparticles. Furthermore, with Ru-BNAH loading on the surface of TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrode, the fluorescence almost vanished, indicating the inhibited recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The inhibited recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs can promote CO2 reduction by enabling the electrons to be used more effectively. The electron transfer from the TiO2/Cu2O semiconductor to the Ru-BNAH molecular catalyst was the main reason for the recombination inhibition of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, Fig. 2b shows the fluorescence quenching of the Ru(II) molecular catalyst in the presence of BNAH. The non-proton carrier molecular catalyst (Ru-PLA) showed obvious fluorescence under the 420 nm light excitation. However, the fluorescence intensity decreased observably upon the addition of the dissociative BNAH. As the proton carrier (BNAH) bonded on Ru-PLA molecular catalyst by C–C bond to form an organic whole (Ru-BNAH), the fluorescence intensity further decreased due to the intramolecular rapid electron migration.

Efficient proton coupling of the Ru-BNAH molecular catalyst
As is well known, catalytic CO2 reduction has two important processes: electron migration and proton coupling. Same as the electron migration, proton coupling plays an important role for the hydrogenate production in catalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, a proton carrier equipped with an efficient proton transfer ability could powerfully promote hydrocarbon generation during CO2 reduction. As shown in Fig. 2c, the transformation between BNAH and BNA can simulate the proton-transfer process. A UV-visible absorption spectrometer was employed to record the proton-transfer capacity of the BNAH. In the solution of BNA in methanol, an apparent absorption peak was observed at 360 nm immediately upon the addition of excess NaBH4, which was attributed to the changes between BNA and BNAH (as shown in the scheme of Fig. 2c). Similar changes should also occur in the transfer with the molecular catalysts Ru-BNA and Ru-BNAH. As shown in Fig. 2d, an obvious absorption enhancement of Ru-BNA was recorded by its UV-visible spectrum accompanied by the addition of NaBH4, which was due to the proton transfer of Ru-BNAH and Ru-BNA. To a certain degree, the absorbance located at 350–500 nm of their UV-visible spectra reflect the proton transfer process. The enhanced absorption means the generation of proton carriers, while the reduced absorption reflects the consumption of proton carriers.

In situ UV-vis spectroscopy was employed to demonstrate the proton transfer of Ru-BNAH in the catalytic CO2 reduction process (Fig. 2e). In CO2-saturated 0.1 M KCl aq. solution, the UV-vis peaks at 275 nm increased significantly accompanied with sustaining the illumination, which might be attributed to the intermediate (Ru-COO−) generation based on CO2 injection into the Ru(II) active unit. Meanwhile, a decreased absorption tendency also arise at 350–400 nm, attributed to the proton contribution of the proton carrier (BNAH). CO2 reduction was realized following a Ru-COO− intermediate receiving a proton from BNAH. The evolution of the UV-vis spectra for Ru-BNAH under CO2 is shown more clearly in Fig. 2f, in which the absorbance at 275 nm (intermediate generation) and 360 nm (proton transfer) are plotted smoothly versus the irradiation time. The absorption intensity of both wavelengths was changed significantly in the first 200 s, which indicates the rapid intermediate generation and proton migration. However, after exceeding 200 s, the absorption intensity flattened out, which indicates the equilibrium state of the BNAH's regeneration and consumption.
In order to further investigate the CO2 reduction capacity of the designed catalyst, cyclic voltammetry was employed to evaluate the electrochemical behaviour. The electrochemical responses of Ru-BNAH and Ru-PLA were probed in N2- or CO2-saturated organic media (1 M H2O in DMF) containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte. In the CO2-saturated solution, the Ru-PLA showed distinctly increasing current density compared with that in N2-saturated solution starting at −1.1 V. The current changes between the CO2- and N2-saturated solutions indicated the Ru-PLA was equipped with a conspicuous CO2-reduction capacity. However, the current density of Ru-BNAH in CO2-saturated solution was much higher than that in N2-saturated solution. Thus, the current density rapidly increased beginning at −0.80 V, which also indicated the bonded proton carrier favoured CO2 reduction. To further expound the complicated relationship between the CO2- and N2-saturated solutions of Ru-PLA and Ru-BNAH clearly, the difference in values of the current density (Δj) in the CO2- and N2-saturated solutions over time are summarized in Fig. 3b. The two catalysts showed evident CO2 reduction because both of them showed obvious Δj values. Thus, Ru-BNAH possessed a much higher Δj value than Ru-PLA at −0.9 V which robustly demonstrated the acceleration of CO2 reduction due to the proton carrier.

The amperometric i–t curves of these electrodes under chopped-light irradiation (Fig. S4a†) also agreed with the above results. The i–t curve of the Cu2O/TiO2 electrode showed an obvious increase by at least 100 s irradiation duration, under N2 or CO2 atmosphere, which was attributable to the slow separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs within Cu2O/TiO2. The added value of light current over the dark current was 0.02 mA cm−2 in the N2-saturated solution, while the value was 0.05 mA cm−2 in the CO2-saturated solution. After Ru-BNAH was loaded onto the TiO2/Cu2O electrode, the current increment in the N2-saturated solution between light on and off was rarely 0.025 mA cm−2; whereas when it came to the CO2-saturated solution, the value reached 0.09 mA cm−2. The current density increasement indicated that the Ru-BNAH loading benefited electron migration, which further caused the enhancement of CO2 reduction. To further investigate the effect of the BNAH proton carrier bio-enzyme on the photoelectric catalytic reduction of CO2, amperometric i–t curves of Ru-PLA/TiO2/Cu2O electrode which had no BNAH proton carrier was introduced. As shown in Fig. S4b,† the light current of the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O electrode was much higher than that of the Ru-PLA/TiO2/Cu2O electrode in the CO2-saturated solution which clearly indicated the efficiency electron migration by the bonding.
Excellent photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction activity
Formic acid was the only liquid product detected in the final liquid phase after 8 h PEC CO2 reduction. Due to the variety of products in CO2 reduction, trace CO and ethylene were detected in the final gas phase (Fig. S5†). The presence of the photosensitizer (Cu2O) responded to the generation of ethylene and the molecular catalyst caused the CO generation. As shown in Fig. 4, formic acid production increased persistently under the irradiation of simulated solar at −0.9 V potential (vs. NHE). After 8 h PEC reduction, the formic acid production reached 409.5 μmol with a TON of 321. The catalytic efficiency achieved was significantly comparable with many similar molecular catalysts in the literature, such as Ru(H4P2O6-C2H4-bpy)(CO)2Cl2/g-C3N4, Ru(dcbpy)/N-Ta2O5, Ru(II)–Re(I) catalyst with the presence of BNAH, RuRu′ binuclear catalyst/Au/g-C3N4 and so on (Table 1).10,29,40–45 The high efficiency was mainly attributed to the effective proton transfer between the BNAH proton carrier and Ru(II) molecular catalyst through covalent bond connection. Generally, the BNAH proton carrier was used in homogeneous reactions, which require a large number of BNAH to fortify the chance of a collision. However, the BNAH covalently bonded on a molecular catalyst can change the intermolecular proton to transfer it into an intramolecular one. Additionally, formic acid production reached 80 μmol h−1 in the initial 4 h, but the value then decreased to 22.4 μmol h−1 in the final 4 h. The probable reason for this was the higher concentration of CO2 and the preeminent catalytic ability of the catalyst in the original 4 h.

Furthermore, the substrate electrode fulfils the following functions: Cu2O serves as photoabsorber and TiO2 nanoparticles serve as a protective layer to avoid the photocorrosion of Cu2O. Simultaneously, TiO2 serves as a scaffold to support the molecular catalyst.28 The formic acid production and TON were tested following the ratios of Cu2O. As shown in Fig. S6,† the formic acid yield of 1:1 TiO2/Cu2O was higher than those of other substrates, which reflected the synergistic effect between the repressed photocorrosion and favourable light harvesting of Cu2O.
As a pivotal aspect of the photoelectrocatalytic reaction, the applied potential plays an important role in the synergetic photoelectrocatalytic CO2 conversion. Therefore, to investigate the impact of the potential for CO2 reduction, formic acid generation following the changed potential was analyzed, as shown in Fig. 4c. Without the potential applied on the photocathode, the pure photocatalytic CO2 reduction process gave 57.2 μmol formic acid production. Simultaneously, the formic acid amount increased constantly following the raised applied potential. However, only 139.5 μmol formic acid was detected at −0.5 V, which indicated that formic acid generation increased slowly at a cathode potential of less than −0.5 V. As the cathode potential exceeded −0.6 V, formic acid generation increased significantly alongside the cathode potential rising. For instance, 409.5 μmol formic acid was detected when a −0.9 V cathode potential was applied, according to the result shown in Fig. 4b (the current density grew rapidly when the cathode potential exceeded −0.65 V in the CO2-saturated solution). The applied potential was mainly used to separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs when the cathode potential was less than −0.6 V (photocatalytic CO2 reduction dominant process). When the cathode potential exceeded −0.7 V, the electrocatalytic process not only functioned as an assistant for the photocatalytic process, but also catalyzed CO2 reduction directly (synergetic photoelectrocatalytic process).
To further investigate the enhancement of CO2 reduction caused by the BNAH proton carrier, the catalytic efficiency of the non BNAH proton carrier modified photocathode (Ru-PLA/TiO2/Cu2O) was assessed (the structure of Ru-PLA is shown in Scheme S1†). After irradiation for 8 h at −0.9 V, the Ru-PLA/TiO2/Cu2O photocathode produced 161.7 μmol formic acid, which was far less than the amount generated by the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photocathode under the same conditions. When BNAH (0.1 M) was added to the Ru-PLA/TiO2/Cu2O system, the generated formic acid increased to 231.0 μmol, which was also much less than the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photocathode produced. This intuitively indicated the acceleration of CO2 reduction caused by covalent bonding.
Probable mechanism for Ru-BNAH catalytic CO2 reduction
In the CO2-saturated solution, in situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to detect the probable mechanism for Ru-BNAH-oriented CO2 reduction. The working electrode was prepared by uniformly loading a Ru-BNAH coating on the surface of the polished Ag electrode, using Pt wire electrode as the opposite electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. As shown in Fig. 5a, from −0.1 V to −1.4 V, two constantly enhanced peaks at 430 and 570 wavenumbers appeared following the continuous increased potential. The changes might be attributed to the stretching vibration of Ru(II)–O bond in the Ru-COO− intermediate, which was generated from activated CO2 inserting in to the d orbital of the Ru(II) centre because this region belongs to the vibration of metal–ligand (M–L) (CO2 inserting process, as shown in Scheme 3).46,47 It's worth noting that from −0.1 V to −0.8 V, the Raman signal intensity changed rarely. From −0.8 V to −1.4 V, the Raman signal at 430 and 570 wavenumbers were enhanced significantly, indicating a demarcation point of the catalyst for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction beginning at −0.8 V. The region from −0.1 V to −0.8 V was predominantly related to a photocatalytic process, while the region beginning from −0.8 V was a photoelectrocatalytic synergetic process.

Simultaneously, significant Raman peaks were observed at the wavenumbers of 1130, 1220, and 1560 cm−1, which increased in line with the increment in potential. The enhanced peaks may be attributed to the generation of C–O single bonds and cleaving of CO double bonds followed with electron migration (CO2 activation process or electron migration process).48,49 Furthermore, the weakening Raman peak at the wavenumber of 1350 cm−1 is attributed to the proton donor process of the BNAH proton donor (proton coupling process in Scheme 3). Following the proton migration, the activated CO2 was converted into formic acid, before finally realizing the catalytic CO2 reduction (product generation process).
In order to further investigate the proton transfer and proton source during the Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O photocathode catalytic CO2 reduction, the isotope-labelling method was employed. First, the GC-MS spectrum of unlabelled formic acid aqueous solution was prepared as the standard. In the headspace GC-MS spectrogram, the retention time of standard formic acid was 1.88 min with the 46 m/z+ value corresponding to the rod-like signal peak (as shown in Fig. 6). Then, the CO2 photoelectrocatalytic reduction proceeded in CO2-saturated D2O solution with Ru-BANH/TiO2/Cu2O as the photocathode. The headspace GC-MS spectrum of the resulting mixture after 20 min irradiation was recorded. As shown in Fig. 6a, the significant red peak appeared at 1.88 min, which was attributed to the formic acid produced from photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction. By comparing the GC-MS spectrum of standard formic acid and the reaction solution, the 47 m/z+ in reaction solution was attributed to single deuterium formic acid (HCOOD). If the protons of formic acid were derived from the solvent directly, the detected MS value of formic acid should be 48(DCOOD). Thus, the detection of formic acid with the 47 m/z+ indicated a proton (H) replacing a deuterium proton (D) of deuterium formic acid (DCOOD) during CO2 reduction. Further analysis showed that Ru-BNAH and the solvent were the proton sources for CO2 hydrogenation. Therefore, Ru-BNAH was the only remaining compound that could supply H atoms for CO2 reduction in the D2O system. Furthermore, by structural analysis, BNAH was the only active proton source for CO2 reduction in Ru-BNAH. Based on the above information, the generation of mono-deuterium formic acid further proved that the necessary protons for CO2 photoelectrocatalytic reduction originated from the BNAH proton carrier.

(b) MS peak intensities of pure formic acid and liquid phase in D2O solution after photoelectrocatalytic CO2 conversion, respectively; (c) 1H NMR spectrum of the CO2-saturated D2O solution after photoelectrocatalytic CO2 conversion. 
For the purpose of further investigation of the generation of mono-deuterium formic acid, the 1H NMR method was used to detect the production after 8 h irradiation in the CO2-saturated D2O solution. As shown in Fig. 6c, there was a significant aldehyde H atom chemical shift at 8.23 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum, which corresponded to the characteristic H atom of HCOO−. If the protons in the formic acid originated from the solvent directly, only deuterium formic acid DCOO− would be generated because D2O could only supply the D atom, thus no aldehyde H would be detected. Therefore, H atoms can only be obtained from BNAH proton carrier according to the structural analysis. The result also proved that the BNAH proton carrier transferred protons to CO2 during photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction indirectly.
Conclusion
To sum up, the biomimetic CO2 catalytic reduction interface (Ru-BNAH/TiO2/Cu2O) equipped with a proton transfer carrier was constructed by bridging a proton-coupling functionized molecular catalyst (Ru-BNAH) on the surface of a TiO2/Cu2O substrate electrode. The bionic BNAH proton transfer carrier, molecular catalyst and photocathode were constructed as a unified interface, thus achieving efficient photoelectrocatalytic CO2 conversion by in situ proton coupling and photogenerated electron migration. Under the synergetic photoelectrocatalytic function, the formic acid production was much higher than that without the proton carrier, following a selectivity of more than 98%. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ UV-visible spectroscopy and the isotope experiments in CO2-saturated D2O solution confirmed the efficient proton-transfer process during photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work represented a new demonstration of using covalent linking to immobilize a proton carrier to generate a semiconductor/metal-complex hybrid photoelectrocatalytic interface and showed the path towards further research into improving the system stability and efficiency.
