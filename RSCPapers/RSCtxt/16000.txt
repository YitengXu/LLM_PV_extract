    , Accepted 12th March 2022First published on 14th March 2022AbstractHomojunction single-material organic solar cells (HOSCs) based on small donor–acceptor molecules represent the ultimate stage of simplification of OSCs. While single-material OSCs based on double-cable polymers or fullerene-based dyads have recently emerged on the forefront of research, the literature contains very few examples of homojunction SMOSCs. In this work a series of small donor–acceptor molecules involving arylamine donor blocks connected to an electron acceptor group by a thienyl or phenyl conjugating bridge has been synthesized. Results of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and theoretical calculations show that the band gap of the materials can be tuned over a wide range by modification of the bridge and acceptor group. The photovoltaic properties of the materials have been evaluated on direct and inverted cells. The two series of devices give consistent results showing that the photocurrent, conversion efficiency and spectral response of the cells are tightly correlated to the chemical structure of the active material. These results thus represent a first step towards a systematic analysis of structure–properties relationships of small D–A molecules as active material for homojunction SMOSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a focus of high interest motivated by the promise to develop a possible complement or alternative to silicon cells combining low environmental impact, low cost, lightness, flexibility and transparency.1–3 While early research was carried out with materials not specifically designed for photovoltaic (PV) conversion,1,2,4,5 the emergence of a chemistry focused on the synthesis of active materials for OSCs at the turn of the millenium has become a major driving force for the progress of this research field. Tailored band gap π-conjugated polymers,6–8 molecular donors,9–13 and more recently non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs)14–16 have strongly contributed to raise the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of donor/acceptor (D/A) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs from 1% to ∼ 20% in two decades.17 However, the industrial development of OSCs remains constrained by persistent problems of cost, scalability and stability of active materials.18–20 An increasing complexity of cell fabrication and chemical structure of active materials seems to be the price to pay for the spectacular progress of PCE accomplished in the past twenty years. To face this problem, efforts aiming at the simplification of the structure of active materials and devices has been undertaken. The replacement of polydisperse conjugated polymers by small molecular donors of unequivocal chemical structure is a first illustration of this trend.9–13 Single-material organic solar cells (SMOSCs) represent a further step of simplification of OSCs.21,22 After sporadic reports during a decade, this topic is now emerging on the forefront of research. SMOSCs materials involve a variety of chemical architectures resorting to different fundamental concepts. « Double-cable » polymers and oligomers with pendant electron acceptor groups are the most widely investigated materials.21,22 Although much more stable than BHJ cells, SMOSCs based on double cable systems pertain to the same basic concept in that sense that charge separation occurs at the boundary of D and A domains, which implies a precise control of the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. PCE values of 8.4% have been obtained with double-cable polymers23 and 5.34% with oligothiophene-fullerene dyads,24 while PCEs of 9–11% were recently reported for in-chain D–A block copolymers although the exact structure and composition of these materials remain imprecise.25,26
Homojunction organic solar cells (HOSCs) based on small molecules are the ultimate stage of simplification of SMOSCs and hence of OSCs.27 Although the low efficiency of primitive HOSCs4 has severely hampered research in this direction, some recent reports suggest of renewal of interest in this of topic.28–37 Research on HOSCs is a high-risk challenge but the knowledge accumulated during a half-century of OSC research represents a valuable intellectual capital which makes it possible to consider the problem on new bases. Charge-generation is the key problem posed by HOSCs. The splitting of excitons into positive and negative charges requires an electric field sufficient to overcome the strong hole–electron pair Coulomb attraction.38 Early devices use the field-effect resulting from the different work function of the electrodes.4 However, possible alternative driving forces have been recently disclosed like for example the energy offset between domains of different molecular orientation.29 D–A intramolecular interactions can also contribute to charge separation.28,30–40 In this case, the possible exciton dissociation on the molecular site of photon absorption could pave the way towards non « excitonic » OSCs,41 and thus erase some of the major problems posed by multi-component cells. HOSCs based on subphthalocyanines,28 A–D–A30,31 or star-shaped D–A systems32–36 have been reported, however, simple small D–A molecules already investigated in multi-component OSCs,10,13 have been investigated only in one publication.37
In this context, we report herein a first systematic analysis of structure–properties relationships on a homogeneous series of small D–A molecules consisting of a triarylamine donor block connected to dicyanovinyl (DCV) and indanedione-based acceptors by thienyl and phenyl conjugating bridges (Scheme 1). The synthesis and characterization of the electronic properties of the molecules by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and theoretical calculations are reported and the relationships between the chemical structures, the electronic properties of the compounds and the performances of the resulting SMOSCs of direct and inverted structures are discussed with the aim of contributing to the definition of possible guidelines for future design of HOSCs active materials.

Synthesis
Electron acceptors derived from indanedione (In) 2-(2,3dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile (13) (InOCN) and 2,2′-(1H-Indene-1,3(2H)-diylidene)bis propanedinitrile (15) (InCN2) are commercially available. Compounds 142 and 2,43 aldehydes 9,4210,431144 and 1245 and the naphthalene-based acceptor 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1Hcyclopenta bnaphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (14)46 (np-InOCN) were synthesized according to known procedures. The target compounds 3–8 were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes 9–12 with acceptor blocks derived from indanedione 13–15 (Scheme 2). The structure and purity of all target compounds was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).

X-Ray diffraction
The crystallographic structure of compounds 6, 7 and 8 was determined by X-Ray diffraction of single crystals obtained by slow evaporation of dichloromethane (DCM) solutions.47 All molecular structures display the usual propeller-like geometry of the TPA block. The already described structure of compound 1 shows that, except for the two outermost phenyl rings of TPA, the molecule adopts a quasi-planar conformation, with a dihedral angle (θ1) of 3.18° between the inner benzene ring of TPA and the thienyl conjugating bridge (Table 1) and an angle (θ2) of 2.98° between the latter and the plane of the DCV group.42 The structure of compound 6 reveals an asymmetric unit involving a single molecule solvated with a DCM molecule (Fig. 1). The main part of the np-InOCN acceptor block is almost coplanar with the thiophene ring with a dihedral angle θ2 of 2.5° while the inner cyano group forms an angle of 15.1° with the plane of the acceptor unit. The planarity of the acceptor-thienyl block is further reinforced by strong intra-molecular sulfur–oxygen interaction with a S⋯O distance of 2.673 Å, significantly inferior to the sum of the van der Waals radii of sulfur and oxygen (1.8 + 1.55 = 3.32 Å). However, the angle between the inner TPA phenyl group and the thiophene θ1 increases to 21.1°.

 Fig. 1  Thermal ellipsoid representation (50% probability) of the molecular structure of 6 (top), 7 (middle) and 8 (bottom). 
The lattice shows head-to-tail orientation of the molecules stabilized by intermolecular contacts such as C–H⋯π interactions between the naphthyl moiety and the thiophene ring (dCg⋯H21 = 3.119 Å, Cg – centroid (C26–C27–C35–C34–C33–C32)), O⋯H contacts (dO1⋯H36 = 2.522 Å and dO1⋯H40A = 2.526 Å with DCM) and N⋯Cl contacts with DCM (dN2⋯Cl1 = 2.976 Å). The structure of compound 7 shows that the two DCV groups on InCN2 cause a significant distortion of the entire molecule. The acceptor part InCN2 adopts a butterfly shape, with two CN groups pointing outwards on the same side of the indene unit plane with and angle of 22.5° for the inner vinylene bond carrying the CN groups and 7.5° for the outer one. Unlike compounds 1, 6 and 8, the acceptor block is not coplanar with the conjugating spacer ring but forms an angle θ2 of 12.5° while similarly to compounds 1, 6 and 8 a value of 21.5° is found for θ1 (Table 1). The lattice of 7 shows a 2D-network of head-to-tail molecules stabilized by N⋯H interactions (dN3⋯H4′ = 2.628 Å, dN4⋯H21′ = 2.457 Å and dN5⋯H15′ = 2.554 Å), while the parallel sheets are 3D connected in a slightly tilted head-to-head arrangement via C⋯H contacts (dC18⋯H11′ = 2.776 Å and dC2⋯H2′ = 2.715 Å) (Fig. S1, ESI†). For compound 8 in which the thienyl bridge is replaced by a phenyl, a deviation from planarity is observed for one of the CN groups forming a 12.3° angle with the indene plane. An angle θ1 of 21.9° is observed between the phenyl spacer and the TPA phenyl ring while the acceptor block is almost coplanar with the phenyl spacer (θ2= 4.5°). Interestingly, the lattice of 8 exhibits a high degree of organization with the formation of 2-D sheets via N⋯H interactions on one direction in a head-to-tail manner (dN2⋯H8′ = 2.526 Å) and on the perpendicular direction in a head-to-head arrangement (dN3⋯H34′ = 2.591 Å). The parallel 2-D sheets are then connected in the 3D structure by short C⋯H contacts (dC34⋯H11′ = 2.732 Å) and sustained by various π–π stacking of aromatic rings in biphenyl and indene units in the different sheets (dcentroid⋯centroid = 3.35–3.38 Å, not represented) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The comparison of the angles θ1 and θ2 which control the effective conjugation between the D and A parts of the molecules and hence the strength of the ICT, shows that the replacement of the DCV acceptor group by indanedione derivatives leads to a deviation from planarity between the TPA block and the conjugating bridge with a dihedral angle independent of the nature of the bridge. This unexpected result could be attributed to indirect consequences of specific intermolecular interactions among the large indanedione-based acceptors.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of compounds 1–8 in DCM solutions and as thin films spin-cast on glass from chloroform solutions while the corresponding data are listed in Table 2. All spectra exhibit a first transition in the 300–450 nm region attributed to a π–π* transition followed by a more intense transition in the visible region corresponding to an internal charge-transfer (ICT).48 Replacing a phenyl ring of 1 by a naphthyl group (2) leads to a small bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (λmax) from 500 to 503 nm. Similarly, a small red shift (2 nm) is observed between compounds 3 and 5. Substitution of DCV in 1 and 2 by InOCN in 3 and 5 produces bathochromic shifts of λmax of 104 and 106 nm respectively. Similarly a 115 nm red shift of λmax is observed for 4 compared to its analog with DCV.41–43 Replacing the InOCN acceptor of 3 by its naphthyl analog np-InOCN in 6 leads to a further 31 nm red shift of λmax. Finally, comparison of the data for 3 and 7 shows that the replacement of InOCN by the stronger acceptor InCN2 leads to a 56 nm red shift of λmax to 660 nm. These results show that structural changes in the arylamine donor block have practically no influence on the absorption spectrum whereas, the modification of the acceptor group allows the tuning of the absorption over a 150 nm range. The data for compounds 3 and 8 show that replacement of the thienyl conjugating bridge of 3 by a phenyl one produces a 74 nm hypsochromic shift of λmax. This suggest that the combined effects of the larger twist angle between the TPA block and the spacer and the higher aromatic resonance energy of the phenyl ring limit the effective conjugation between the D and A groups. This less effective conjugation results in a decrease of the relative intensities of the ICT vs. π–π* transitions from 1.5 for compound 3 to 0.65 for compound 8. The spectra of the films present a bathochromic shift of λmax and a broadening of the absorption band typical of π-stacking intermolecular interactions in the solid. However, the magnitude of these effects significantly depends on the structure of the molecule. Thus, the 15 nm red shift of λmax observed for films of compound 1 increases to 55 nm for compound 8 while the broadening of the absorption band suggests a more disordered molecular packing. This hypothesis is consistent with the twisted geometry of the acceptor observed in the crystal structure. The band gap (Eg) of 1–8 was estimated from the intercept of the tangent to the long wavelengths absorption edge to the horizontal axis. Table 2 shows that the modification of the nature of the acceptor and conjugating spacer allows a modulation of Eg over ca 0.70 eV.

The electrochemical properties of compounds 1–8 have been analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in DCM in the presence of Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. The oxidation and reduction processes were investigated in distinct experiments in order to prevent possible interferences between the process of interest (oxidation or reduction) and the eventual products of degradation of the opposite process.
The CV of all compounds shows a reversible one-electron oxidation wave with an anodic peak potential (Epa) around 1.0 V corresponding to the formation of a stable radical cation (Fig. 3). The small dependence of Epa on the nature of the acceptor is consistent with a strong localization of the HOMO on the donor block (see below). The CV of compound 1 and 2 shows an irreversible reduction wave with a cathodic peak potential (Epc) at ca. −1.20 V. Replacement of DCV by InOCN produces a positive shift of Epc to −0.79 and −0.75 V for 3 and 5 respectively. Substituting InOCN by np-InOCN produces a further 50 mV positive shift of Epc between 3 and 6 while replacement by InCN2 leads to a further shift to −0.58 V for 7. Changing the thienyl spacer of 3 by a phenyl one in 8 produces a 30 mV negative shift of Epc to −0.82 V. These results are consistent with optical data and they confirm that the HOMO of the compounds is essentially determined by the arylamine donor block while the LUMO level, the HOMO–LUMO gap (ΔE) and the band gap are controlled by the nature of the spacer and acceptor groups.

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) studies were performed using the Gaussian 09 package. All geometries were fully optimized in DCM as the solvent. The optimized structures of the molecules (Fig. S3, ESI†) show that except for compounds 7 and 8, the conjugating bridge-acceptor part of the molecule is fully coplanar. A small twist angle is observed for compound 8 and a larger one for compound 7. Fig. 4 shows that for all compounds, the HOMO is essentially distributed over the donor-bridge part of the molecule while the highest LUMO coefficients are observed on the acceptor-bridge part. It is noteworthy that a more contrasted situation is observed for compound 8 for which the HOMO and LUMO are more clearly separated, a result consistent with the less effective conjugating efficiency of the phenyl bridge.
 Fig. 4  Distribution of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals for compounds 1–8. 
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels and dipole moments of the compounds are listed in Table 3. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps agree well with experimental results (Fig. S4, ESI†) and confirm the small differences among HOMO levels and the large variations of LUMO levels associated with the various acceptor and spacer groups. The calculated values of the dipole moment (μ) reflect the relative strength of the D and A groups and their spatial disposition. Thus, in spite of a stronger acceptor strength, InOCN and np-InOCN lead to lower μ values than the DCV group, except for compound 4 for which the effect is counterbalanced by the stronger methyl-containing donor. The lowest value found for compound 8 can be attributed to the less effective phenyl conjugating spacer. The dipole moments of compounds T and P (Scheme 3) used for comparison of the PV properties (see below) have been also calculated.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performances of compounds 1–8 have been analyzed on direct and inverted cells of 28 mm2 active area of structure ITO/MoO3/M/Bphen/Aluminium and ITO/ZnO/M/MoO3/Aluminium fabricated by thermal evaporation under vacuum where M is the active material. To the best of our knowledge, molecules P and T49 are the only examples of small D–A molecules evaluated in HOSCs so far,37 while only one example of SMOSC with inverted structure based on the large A–D–A molecule (BTID) has been reported.31
Although most of the compounds are solution processable, the vacuum deposition method was preferred because it leads to better performances and more stable films (see Fig. S8, ESI†). Table 4 lists the main PV characteristics of the two types of cells under AM 1.5 simulated solar light. The good agreement between the two series of results confirms that the observed differences are effectively related to the chemical structures of the molecules (Fig. S5, ESI†). Except for 7, the inverted cells show ca twice larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE values. Fig. 5 shows as a representative example, the J vs. V curves for direct and inverted cells based on compound 5. For both series of cells, the J/V curves for all compounds are very similar and show that J does not saturate at negative voltages indicating a strong dependence of the efficiency of charge photogeneration on the electric field (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). This phenomenon results in low fill factors (FF) of 30–40% for direct cells and 25–30% for inverted cells. Such low FF values have been observed for almost all HOSCs cells based on D–A systems reported so far.28,32–37

Comparison of the results for the cells based on 1 and 2 with 3 and 5 shows that substituting the DCV acceptor by InOCN produces a twofold increase of Jsc while PCE increases from ∼0.2% for 1 and 2 to 0.46 and 0.48% for 3 and 5 respectively. The same effect is observed for the inverted cells with an increase of PCE from ∼0.5 to ∼0.9%. These better performances can be attributed to the stronger light-harvesting properties of the IOCN containing molecules.
We have shown already that the replacement of a phenyl ring of TPA of compound 1 by a β-naphthyl or a methyl group leads to a large increase of the efficiency of the resulting two-component solar cells.43,44 The results for compounds 3–5 show that for both types of cells, the improvement expected for 4 and 5 is not observed. The cells based on 3 and 5 lead to rather similar performances while the results for 4 are inferior to those of cells based on 3. However, the highest FF value observed for both types of cells based on 4 is consistent with the previously observed higher hole-mobility of D–A systems based on the methyl-diphenylamine donor block.43
It has been shown that films of the analog of 4 with a DCV acceptor undergo a spontaneous molecular reorganization at ambient temperature leading to a 0.30 eV decrease of Eg.44 This metastable molecular packing, at the origin of the mechano-fluorochromism of some parent compounds,50,51 is not observed with compound 4 for which the optical spectra of spun-cast and vacuum-deposited films remains stable after long storage in ambient conditions and even after thermal annealing (Fig. S8, ESI†). This suggests that the replacement of DCV by InOCN freezes the molecular packing presumably through interactions among the planar acceptor groups as previously discussed in the literature.52 However, the rigidification of the molecule by intramolecular S⋯O interactions can also play a role (Fig. S9, ESI†). The data for compounds 3 and 6 where InOCN is replaced by np-InOCN show that contrary to the increased Jsc expected on the basis of the 30 nm red shift of λmax, the opposite is observed with a large decrease of Jsc and PCE for both types of cells. The thickness dependence of absorbance for vacuum deposited films of compounds 3 and 6 shows a twice lower slope for compound 6, while similar slopes and absorbance values are found for solution-processed films. This suggests a partial decomposition of compound 6 during thermal evaporation. This conclusion is confirmed by the spectra of solutions of the dissolved vacuum deposited films. While for 3 this spectrum is identical to that of the initial pure compound, the strong new absorption in the short wavelengths region for 6 confirms that the molecule partially decompose during thermal evaporation (Fig. S10, ESI†). While the naphthyl group could increase the fragility of the structure, the DCM molecule found in the crystal structure of 6 may also plays a role in this phenomenon. In order to complete these results, an inverted cell based on spin-cast film of compound 6 has been fabricated and the results confirm that a much higher efficiency is obtained in this case.
Compound 7 in which InOCN is replaced by InCN2, leads to poor performances for both types of cells. The deleterious influence of this acceptor is consistent with previous results on two-component cells and can be attributed to the effects of the twisted molecular structure on ICT and molecular packing.53 The thienyl bridge of compounds 1–7 was replaced by a phenyl one in 8 in an attempt to limit geminate recombination by inserting a less effective conjugating bridge than thiophene. However, the resulting decrease of the strength of the ICT finally leads to inferior light-harvesting properties and thus to lower Jsc and PCE values. As a general trend Voc increases with Eg, while the replacement of DCV by stronger indanedione-based acceptor leads to a simultaneous lowering of the LUMO and decrease of Voc. However although there is no clear correlation for the whole series of compounds. On the other hand, a better correlation is found between the dipole moment of the molecule and the decrease of Voc (Fig. S11, ESI†). Based on the relation between the dielectric constant of the material and the dipole moment of the molecule, this trend is consistent with previous observations that higher dielectric constants could lower the energy of the charge-transfer state (ECT) and hence Voc.54 However, further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Fig. 6 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the cells. These spectra are very similar to the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the corresponding films (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the similar shape of the two series of EQE responses is consistent with charge generation occuring in the bulk of the material. The ca. twice larger values observed for inverted cells at the maximum of the ICT band (EQEmax) are correlated with PCE values (Table 4) while the Jsc values obtained by integration of EQE spectra agree well with the results under simulated solar light. The highest EQEmax are found for compounds 3 and 5 with values of 9–10% for direct cells increasing to ∼23% for inverted structures. In contrast the spectra for compound 7 confirm the low conversion efficiency associated with the weak intensity of the ICT band.

Fig. 7 shows the light intensity dependence of Jsc for the direct and inverted cells based on compound 3. The relation between Jsc and the power light intensity (P) follows a power law Jsc ∝ Pα where α = 1 in the absence of bimolecular recombination.55,56 In both cases, the slope is close to unity (0.986 and 0.993 for direct and inverted cells respectively) suggesting that bimolecular recombination is negligible and that the low efficiency is essentially due to geminate recombination, as could be expected for a device based on a single D–A molecule. However, around P = 70–80 mW cm−2 the slopes seem to decrease suggesting that some bimolecular recombination begins to occur at high illumination intensity.

The literature contains very few examples of HOSCs based on D–A compounds. The best results reported so far have been obtained with star-shaped D–A molecules with PCE = 1.13% and Jsc = 3.54 mA cm−2 for a 3 mm2 cell with Ca/Al cathode.33 A 4 mm2 inverted cell based on BTID gave Jsc = 1.5 mA cm−2 and PCE = 0.9% increasing to 2.6 mA cm−2 and 1.6% after thermal annealing.31 To the best of our knowledge, molecules T and P are the only examples of small D–A molecules evaluated in HOSC giving Jsc of 0.5 and 1.0 mA cm−2 and PCE of 0.11% and 0.30% for cells of unspecified area.37 As appears in Table 4, with Jsc of ∼1.5 mA cm2 and PCE of ∼0.5% for direct cells and Jsc of 3.5 mA cm2 and PCE of ∼0.9% for inverted structures the results obtained with compounds 3 and 5 compare favorably with previous results based on larger D–A molecules and clearly surpass those reported for small D–A systems particularly when taking into account the ∼10 times larger active area of the devices.
Conclusions
A series of small donor–acceptor molecules combining triarylamine donor blocks with different acceptors through aromatic conjugating bridges has been synthesized. Optical, electrochemical and theoretical show that the band gap can be modulated over 0.70 eV by varying the conjugating bridge and the strength of the acceptor. Homojunction SMOSCs of direct and inverted structures give consistent results which clearly evidence the relationships between the chemical structure of the molecules and the photovoltaic characteristics of the cells. The modifications of the donor block known to improve the efficiency of bi-component solar cells become ineffective when the DCV acceptor is replaced by indanedione-based acceptors, suggesting that these larger planar acceptors tend to control the molecular organization with in some cases, deleterious effects. In spite of these limitations, some of these molecules lead to the highest PCE and JSC values reported so far for HOSCs based on small D–A molecules. While these results provides some interesting first informations on the structure–properties relationships of HOSC materials based on small push–pull molecules, it is clear that this work is only a modest first step on a long and difficult road and it is hoped that these preliminary results will contribute to stimulate an intensification of research on this exciting topic.
