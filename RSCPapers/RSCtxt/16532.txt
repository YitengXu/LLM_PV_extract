Simultaneous enhancements of the fluorescence emission and solubility in organic solvents for the resultant aromatic heterocyclic compounds 1–13 have been achieved. Analyses on twelve X-ray single-crystal structures indicate that the thiophene ring of the TIP unit in this series of compounds shows the same trans configuration with its imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]-phenanthroline core but different dihedral angles with the adjacent aromatic heterocycles. Thermal gravimetric analyses for ten imidazole N-substituted TIP derivatives reveal that they still retain good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures higher than 300 °C originating from their common TIP core, even with the introduction of the n-butyl radical in their molecular structure. Moreover, TPA and carbazole substituted compounds 2 and 9 were used as the ancillary ligands to prepare their corresponding ruthenium(II) sensitizers, BM3 and BM4, and their dye-sensitized solar cell performance was evaluated.
1. Introduction
In recent years, research on organic luminescent materials has attracted great attention because of their importance in the application of light technology such as signaling, imaging and fluorescent biosensor/chemosensor materials.1–5 In particular, materials bearing the “donor–acceptor” or “push–pull” structural architectures are more fascinating due to their efficient absorption of electromagnetic radiation by virtue of an intramolecular charge transfer and emission from their corresponding photoexcited state.6–8 Consequently, considerable efforts have been conducted in designing and synthesizing diverse classes of the abovementioned fluorescent molecules.9–14
Among the classes of organic π systems, nitrogen-containing heterocycles are very promising building blocks to synthesize a great number of strongly emissive materials.15–18 1,10-Phenanthroline, as a type of common electron-deficient group, is often fused with electron-rich thiophene rings and bridged by imidazole groups. Therefore, a typical donor–acceptor molecule, i.e., 2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]-phenanthroline (TIP), was formed.19 Moreover, the two chelating coordinative sites of 1,10-phenanthroline are still reserved and makes it possible to fine-tune the optoelectronic properties over a wide range.20–22 However, the fluorescence activity of TIP is not high enough and it is probably caused by its short conjugated π system.
In this work, the aim was to incorporate various aromatic units into the TIP backbone to extend the conjugated π system and the rigidity of resultant molecules, thereby manipulating their electronic structures and increasing their fluorescence emissions. Considering that the aromatic heterocyclic extension is limited by the solubility of resultant molecules, which will significantly reduce their reaction activity and make them very difficult to isolate and characterize, the alkylation strategy was used before the extension of the delocalized π system. So we report herein a family of TIP based compounds following the strategy of introducing alkyl chains and extending different S-, N- and O-containing aromatic heterocyclic tails from α position of the TIP thiophene ring, where simultaneous enhancements of fluorescence emission and solubility in organic solvents have been achieved. In addition, X-ray single-crystal structures of twelve compounds as well as thermal gravimetric analyses for ten imidazole N-substituted TIP derivatives have been explored. Moreover, TPA and carbazole substituted compounds 2 and 9 were used as the ancillary ligands to prepare their corresponding ruthenium(II) sensitizers, BM3 and BM4, and their dye-sensitized solar cell performance was evaluated.
2. Results and discussion
Syntheses
Generally, the Debus–Radziszewski reaction23 between 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione and a variety of formyl-thiophene derivatives in the presence of excess ammonium acetate is an effective way to construct TIP based aromatic heterocyclic compounds.22,24–27 Herein the 2-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]-phenanthroline (TIP) core was selected as the starting material for subsequent imidazole N-alkylation and aromatic heterocyclic extension because TIP based derivatives, including their metal complexes, have shown excellent optoelectronic properties and thermal stability. As shown in Scheme 1, our synthesis started from TIP based compounds 1 and 2, which were prepared using the Debus–Radziszewski reaction in high yield. Compared with TIP, 1 has two n-butyl chains in 3 and 4 positions of the thiophene ring and showed better solubility in common organic solvents. However, the two crowded n-butyl chains have large steric hindrance effects, which will generate large dihedral angles between the adjacent aromatic rings thereby influencing the extension of the delocalized π system to different extents.28–31 Actually, mono-alkylation at the β position of the thiophene ring is an effective method for retaining the molecular planarity, but this strategy has the disadvantage of synthetic difficulties originating from molecular symmetry.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for TIP based heterocyclic aromatic fluorescent compounds. 
As an alternative approach to increase the solubility and reaction activity of TIP based compounds, including easier purification and characterization of the final products, the following N-alkylation reactions to obtain compounds 3 and 4 were proceeded in the presence of NaH as a base in 73% and 74% yield, respectively. As expected, introduction of the mono-alkyl chain in compounds 3 and 4 results in an evident improvement of solubility in common organic solvents in comparison with TIP. In our experiments, two synthetic methods (methods A and B in Scheme 1) have been used to prepare 8, where the discrepancy between them is the sequence of the N-alkylation and Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Our results reveal that N-alkylation before cross-coupling (method B) has advantages of easy-handling and even higher yields mainly due to the increase in solubility and reaction activity. For example, in the case of compound 8, method B gave a higher two-step yield of 56% than method A (37%). Therefore, method B has been used to prepare other TIP based compounds (6–13). Consequently, all the TIP based target compounds 6–13 bearing pyridine-, ethyl benzoate-, triphenylamino-, phenylcarbazole-, thiophene-, formyl thiophene-, formyl furan- and dibenzothiophene-terminated substituents were prepared by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions between intermediate 5 (obtained by the bromination from 4 using NBS in CH2Cl2 in a 91% yield) and a variety of boronic acids. All the reactions proceeded smoothly, which could be monitored directly by a UV-light detector excited at 365 nm with the color of fluorescence emission altering from light blue to deeper color. Furthermore, the molecular planarity of compounds 6–13 has been retained by our N-alkylation synthetic strategy, which could be verified by the following X-ray single-crystal structures with the dihedral angles between thiophene and its vicinal aromatic rings being less than 24.4(3)°.
Spectral characterization
The photophysical properties of the TIP based compounds 4–13 in CH2Cl2 at a concentration of 5.0 × 10−5 M were investigated and the spectral data are summarized in Table 2. Multiple absorption bands are observed in the UV-vis absorption spectra, as displayed in Fig. 1a. The wide peak located at 325–396 nm can be assigned as the π–π* transition absorption of the conjugated system. Evidently, TIPs 6–13 with the extension of aryl radicals to α position of the thiophene ring in the TIP unit exhibit not only a more red-shifted absorption, but also a considerably enlarged absorption area. Namely, when compared with the short conjugated length in 4 (325 nm and 24800 L mol−1 cm−1), compounds 6–13 have larger λmax (358–396 nm) and higher ε (28100–46900 L mol−1 cm−1) values. Moreover, it was also found that TIPs 6–13 show red-shifted absorptions to different extents with increase in the delocalized π system for all molecules after the aromatic heterocyclic extension.
 Fig. 1  UV-vis absorption spectra (a) and fluorescence emission excited at 350 nm (b) for the TIP based compounds in their CH2Cl2 solutions at room temperature with the same concentration of 5.0 × 10−5 mol L−1. 
Similar to the absorption spectra, the fluorescence spectra of TIPs 6–13 also exhibit red-shifted emission bands in comparison with 4, and the photoluminescence capabilities also strengthened significantly. In our compounds, strong fluorescence signals were observed for compounds 6–9, whereas the fluorescence emission intensity of compounds 10–13 was considerably weaker. It is noted that compounds 6–9 have high Φ values of 70%, 69%, 73% and 72% (Table 1), whereas 5 is the weakest fluorescence emitter with a Φ value of 5.0% because of the fluorescence quenching effects of the bromine atom.32,33 When compared with 10, having a Φ value of 38%, its structural analogue 11 bearing an additional formyl end group shows a higher Φ value of 46%. In addition, the replacement of thiophene with furan in 12 also leads to a distinct Φ value of 53%, which agrees well with the previously reported uridine monophosphate derivatives bearing a formyl-substituted thiophene or furan ring in position 5.34

Single-crystal structures of TIP based compounds 3–13
When compared with the traditional means of characterization, X-ray single-crystal diffraction has evident advantages of characterizing the molecular geometry, crystal packing modes and supramolecular interactions. In this work, we have obtained single-crystal structures of eleven compounds, namely, 3·CHCl3, 4, 6·H2O, (7)2·C2H5OH·(CHCl3)2, 8·CHCl3, 9·CHCl3, 10, 10·CHCl3, 11·CHCl3, 12, 13·CHCl3 and intermediate 5·CHCl3 (Fig. 2 and SI16†). These single crystal samples suitable for X-ray diffraction were grown by slow evaporation of their solution in CHCl3 or in a mixture of CHCl3 and EtOH.

All the solvent molecules are omitted for clarity. 
In comparison with the conventional double β-alkylation of thiophene ring, our results reveal that the single imidazole N-alkylation strategy for TIP based compounds has the advantage of maintaining the planarity of the entire molecule in addition to significantly improving the solubility, which can be clearly verified by the small dihedral angles between the adjacent TIP rings in the twelve X-ray single-crystal structures. When compared with the dihedral angle between imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline and their neighbouring thiophene rings in the synthetic precursors 3·CHCl3 and 4 (38.1(3)° and 38.2(2)°), the others target TIPs 6–13, which are terminated by various aryl groups at the α position of the thiophene ring in the TIP core, show smaller dihedral angles in the range of 4.6(4)°–24.4(3)°, indicating that the introduction of one n-butyl group in the imidazole ring does not destroy the planarity of the TIP based molecules too much. The observation of the discrepancy in the dihedral angle for compounds 6–13 before and after aromatic heterocyclic extension is consistent with the aforementioned fluorescence emission variations. In addition, the alkyl substituted nitrogen atom in the TIP unit and the neighbouring sulfur atom of the thiophene ring are found to point in opposite directions, exhibiting a common trans configuration. The crystal packing view of this family of TIPs is shown in Fig. SI17,† where typical intermolecular π–π stacking interactions are found between the adjacent aromatic rings.
Thermal stability
Thermal properties of all the powder samples of n-butyl containing TIP based compounds 4–13 have been further investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) for comparison. As depicted in Fig. 3, all compounds, except 8, which may be impacted by the solvate CHCl3, display excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures higher than 300 °C, and Td10 values ranging from 374 to 463 °C. It is worth mentioning that the phenylcarbazole- and dibenzothiophene-terminated TIPs, 9 and 13, exhibit the best thermal stability. It is concluded that all the TIP derivatives bearing different terminating chromophores at the α position of the thiophene ring still retain good thermal stability even with the introduction of the n-butyl radical in the imidazole ring for better solubility and ease of purification.

Dye-sensitized solar cell performance of ruthenium(II) sensitizers containing TPA and carbazole substituted ancillary ligands
In recent years, ruthenium complexes containing 1,10-phenanthroline based ancillary ligands have been used in studies of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs).35–38 In particular, TPA and carbazole involved ancillary ligands have shown good DSC performance39–41 with high power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Therefore, in this work, TPA and carbazole substituted compounds 2 and 9 were used as the ancillary ligands to react with half molar ratio of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 and then with excess ammonium thiocyanate to produce corresponding ruthenium(II) sensitizers BM3 and BM4 (Scheme 2). In comparison with ligands 2 and 9, BM3 and BM4 display a new UV-vis absorption peak at 527 and 521 nm (Fig. 4a), respectively, indicative of typical metal-to-ligand charge transfer within the molecules.

The photocurrent density–voltage curves and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of BM3 and BM4 under the AM1.5 sunlight illumination are shown in Fig. 4b and c, respectively, together with our recently reported ruthenium(II) sensitizer BM142 containing a carbazole terminated TIP ancillary ligand in the absence of an alkyl chain for comparison. It is noted that the BM4 based DSC has a relatively low PCE value of 4.62% compared to that of BM1 (Table 2) after the introduction of the n-butyl group on the imidazole nitrogen atom using the same cell fabrication and efficiency measuring procedures, which is consistent with the results of their IPCE spectra. In addition, the DSC fabricated from the TPA based ruthenium(II) sensitizer BM3 shows a considerably lower PCE value of 4.01% and an open-circuit voltage of 0.61 V. Our results indicate that the phenylcarbazole tail is better than the triphenylamino one in their PCEs of corresponding DSCs and the introduction of a long alkyl chain into the imidazole unit of the TIP based molecule cannot efficiently improve the overall DSC performance.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have described herein a group of TIP based heterocyclic aromatic fluorescent compounds, including imidazole N-substituted alkyl chains (allyl and n-butyl). Synthetic, spectral, structural and thermal studies have been carried out to reveal the influence of N-alkylation and aromatic heterocyclic extension on the resulting TIP derivatives. It is concluded that a simultaneous enhancement of the fluorescence and solubility by N-alkylation and the following aromatic heterocyclic extension has been achieved for this series of heterocyclic aromatic compounds. In addition, good molecular planarity and thermal stability of the resultant aromatic heterocyclic extended TIPs can be retained by means of our synthetic strategy even with the introduction of an alkyl radical for better solubility and ease of purification, which can be verified by the small dihedral angles between the adjacent aromatic rings in nine X-ray single-crystal structures (<24.4(3)°) and the high decomposition temperatures (>300 °C). Furthermore, TPA and carbazole substituted compounds, 2 and 9, have been used as the ancillary ligands to prepare their corresponding ruthenium(II) sensitizers, BM3 and BM4, and their DSC performance was evaluated.
4. Experimental section
Materials and measurements
The synthetic details and characterization of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione,43 3,4-dibutylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde44 and 2-triphenylamine-thiophene-5-carbaldehyde45 have been previously reported. Unless otherwise specified, solvent of analytical grade was purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (300–400 mesh). Standard techniques for synthesis were carried out under argon atmosphere. All melting points were measured without any corrections.
1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic measurements were obtained with a Bruker AM-500 NMR spectrometer using TMS (SiMe4) as an internal reference at room temperature. Electron ionization mass spectra (EI-MS, electron energy 70 eV) were recorded using a GCT TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded by a Thermo Fisher Scientific LCQ Fleet mass spectrometer over a scan range of 200–2000 amu. Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded by a Thermo Fisher Scientific LCQ Fleet mass spectrometer over a scan range of 100–2000 amu. Infrared (IR) spectra (4000–400 cm−1) were recorded using a Nicolet FT-IR 170X spectrophotometer on KBr disks. UV-vis spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3150 double-beam spectrophotometer using a quartz glass cell with a path length of 10 mm. Elemental analyses (EA) for carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen were performed using a Perkin-Elmer 1400C analyzer. Luminescence spectra were recorded using an F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature. Thermogravimetry analyses were carried out using a NETZSCH STA449C thermogravimetric analyzer under a nitrogen flow from 50 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10.0 °C min−1.

Luminescence spectra were recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature (25 °C) using the same solutions as those used for the UV-vis determination. The fluorescence quantum yield gives the efficiency of the fluorescence process and the popular method to calculate it is to compare the fluorescence intensities (integrated areas) of a standard sample and the unknown one using the following equation. As can be seen in eqn (1), Φs is the luminescence quantum yield of the unknown sample, Φstd is the luminescence quantum yield of the standard substance, I is the wavelength-integrated area of the corrected emission spectrum, and A is the absorbance value at the excitation wavelength. ηs and ηstd represent the refractive indices of the corresponding solvents (pure solvents were assumed). We use anthracene in its ethanol solution as a standard sample (Φstd = 27.0%, ηstd = 1.36),46 and TIP based compounds 4–13 were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (ηs = 1.42).
Photovoltaic measurements were recorded with a Newport Oriel solar simulator (Model 91160) equipped with a class a xenon light source powered by a Newport power supply. The power output of the lamp was measured to 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) using a certified Si reference cell. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of each cell were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley digital source meter (Model 2400).
X-ray data collection and structural determination
Single-crystal samples of twelve compounds were covered with glue and mounted on glass fibers and then used for data collection. The crystal system was determined by Laue symmetry and the space groups were assigned on the basis of systematic absences using XPREP. Absorption correction was performed to the data and the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by a full-matrix least-squares method on Fobs2 using the SHELXTL-PC software package.47,48 All non-H atoms were anisotropically refined and all hydrogen atoms were inserted in the calculated positions assigned fixed isotropic thermal parameters and allowed to ride on their respective parent atoms. A summary of the crystal data, experimental details and refinement results for all twelve compounds is listed in Table 3, whereas selected bond distances and angles are given in Table SI1.†
