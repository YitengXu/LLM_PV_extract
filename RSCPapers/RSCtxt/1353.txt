    , Accepted 4th June 2019First published on 4th June 2019AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) decomposition of water at room temperature and separation of hydrogen and oxygen has been achieved using a solid-state cell with a proton exchange membrane (PEM). The PEM–PEC cell can use water vapor instead of liquid aqueous electrolytes for solar hydrogen production. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of thermally oxidized rutile TiO2 layers on titanium microfiber felt for the photoanodic oxidation of water vapor in the gas phase. We investigated the effects of perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer coating, the wavelength and intensity of incident UV light, and external electric bias on the photocurrent density of TiO2 photoanodes in a humidified gaseous condition. The gas-phase PEC performance of the rutile TiO2 thin layer electrode was much higher than that of the anatase TiO2 nanotube array electrode under 385 nm UV illumination at high irradiance (40 mW cm−2). The H2 evolution rate in the PEM–PEC cell using a rutile TiO2 layer as an oxygen-evolving photoanode was 330 μmol h−1 under 385 nm UV (irradiation area 16 cm2) at an applied voltage of 1.2 V.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water decomposition is a method for large-scale solar energy conversion into hydrogen (H2) as a storable and transportable fuel.1–4 In the PEC system, H2 and oxygen (O2) are easily separated by a membrane because the reactions take place on different electrodes, in contrast to the case of powdered photocatalysts.5–8 Research on PEC water splitting has usually been performed in liquid aqueous electrolytes. However, water supply could be a big issue in practical operation in water-scarce areas such as deserts with long hours of sunshine. Currently, gaseous water has been attracting attention as an alternative water resource for water-splitting facilities.9–12 Water vapor, which is present as humidity in ambient air, could potentially reduce the cost of the liquid water supply in PEC systems.
For the gas-phase operation, the electrolyte should be a solid membrane such as a proton conducting polymer.10,13–18 However, it was previously shown that the performances of all solid PEC cells under purely gaseous conditions were lower than those of conventional aqueous electrolytes.10,13–16 One of the reasons was the slow kinetics of proton conduction on the photoelectrode surface in the absence of an electrolyte. Amano et al. have found that the gas–polymer electrolyte–semiconductor triple-phase boundary of nanostructured macroporous photoelectrodes is important for the PEC reaction at the gas–solid interface.19–21 A surface coating of Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer as a proton conducting polymer markedly enhanced the photocurrent of a TiO2 nanotube array (TNTA) electrode in PEC oxidation of water vapor.21
The ionomer-coated anatase TNTA photoanode exhibited an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 26% at an applied voltage (ΔE) of 1.2 V under 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.21 The photoanode induced oxidation of water vapor by photogenerated holes to form O2 and protons (2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+). The PEC oxidation of water vapor was even induced under atmospheric pressure air. The protons are transported through a proton exchange membrane (PEM) and reduced to H2 over a Pt catalyst cathode using photogenerated electrons, which pass through the outer circuit (2H+ + 2e− → H2). The H2 production rate was 600 μmol h−1 in a PEM–PEC cell (irradiance I0 = 40 mW cm−2, irradiation area 16 cm2) using an anatase TNTA photoanode.21 However, the bandgap photoexcitation of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV) is achieved only under UV irradiation (wavelength, λ < 388 nm).
Rutile TiO2, which is a polymorph of titanium(IV) oxide, is an efficient water oxidation photocatalyst.22,23 It possesses a band gap 3.0 eV narrower than that of anatase. The conduction band edge of rutile is more positive than that of anatase by about 0.2 eV.24 This photoabsorption (λ < 413 nm) is an advantage of rutile TiO2 compared with anatase TiO2. However, the photoactivities of rutile TiO2 are frequently lower than those of anatase TiO2 in many photocatalytic applications. In contrast, recent publications show that partly reduced rutile TiO2 exhibits high photocatalytic activity.25,26 Further, rutile TiO2 electrodes have been reported to display high PEC performance in water oxidation.27–29
In this study, we focused on rutile TiO2 photoanodes for PEC water vapor splitting into H2 and O2 (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). Titanium microfiber felts with a three-dimensional network structure have been used as a conductive substrate as the photoanode in a PEM–PEC cell should be porous to facilitate gas diffusion and proton transport in the vertical direction.17–21,30,31 Tsampas et al. reported that the anatase phase of TiO2 photoanodes prepared on Ti microfiber felt was more active compared with the rutile phase under 365 nm illumination in the gas-phase PEC reaction.17,31 Herein, we represent that rutile TiO2 thin layer photoanodes show a much higher photocurrent than that of anatase TiO2 under 385 nm illumination owing to the difference in the band gaps (3.0 and 3.2 eV). The PEC water vapor splitting over the thermally-oxidized rutile thin layers was achieved by coating the surface with Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer. The PEC properties of the TiO2 electrodes in the gaseous condition were investigated under different reaction conditions such as wavelength and intensity of incident light and external electric bias to understand the characteristic of the newly developed PEM–PEC cell.
Experimental
Preparation of TiO2 electrodes
Sintered Ti microfiber felt (thickness 0.1 mm, porosity 67%, Nikko Techno, Japan) was used as the conductive material for the TiO2 electrodes. After ultrasonic cleaning in acetone and deionized water, the Ti microfiber felt was calcined in the air using an electric muffle furnace at different temperatures (450–750 °C) for several hours (1, 2 and 3 h). During the calcination, the TiO2 layer is formed on the microfiber surface by thermal oxidation of Ti in the presence of O2. The obtained thermally oxidized TiO2 layer on the Ti microfiber was coated with a drop of Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer dispersion (5 wt% in 50 wt% alcohols and 45 wt% water, Sigma–Aldrich Japan, Japan). The drop casting (5 μL cm−2 for each of the front and back sides) was repeated several times after drying at 80 °C. Anatase TNTA was prepared by anodization of the Ti microfiber felt in ethylene glycol containing fluorine and water at 50 V for 3 h and subsequent calcination in the air at 550 °C for 2 h.21,27
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 200 mA. Laser Raman spectra were recorded on an NRS-5100 spectrometer (JASCO, Japan) using 532 nm green radiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were performed with a JSM-7800F microscope (JEOL, Japan). The SEM images were obtained at a working distance of 10 mm and an acceleration voltage of 10 kV.
PEC measurements in aqueous electrolyte
A conventional three-electrode system was used in a one-compartment glass reactor. The electrolyte was an aqueous solution of 0.2 mol L−1 sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and 0.1 mol L−1 sodium phosphate buffer with a pH of 6.7. The solution was purged with argon (20 mL min−1). The reference electrode was a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), and the potential versus RHE (ERHE) was obtained by the equation, ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.195. Photoirradiation was performed using a UV light-emitting diode (LED, central λ = 365 nm, Nitride Semiconductor, Japan) and a 300 W xenon lamp with bandpass filters (Asahi Spectra, Japan) at room temperature. The irradiation area of the photoanode was adjusted to 1 cm2. The intensity of the incident light was measured by an optical power meter (Hioki, Japan). IPCE was calculated from photocurrent density (Jphoto) [mA cm−2] and I0 [mW cm−2] at λ [nm] using the equation, IPCE = (1240/λ) × Jphoto/I0.
A Mott–Schottky plot was recorded on a VersaSTAT 4 potentiostat with a frequency response analyser (Ametek, USA). The space charge layer capacitance (C) was measured in the electrolyte in the dark using the electrochemical impedance method at a frequency of 1000 Hz.
Preparation of membrane electrode assemblies
Carbon black-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/CB, TEC10E50E, Pt loading 47 wt%, Tanaka Kikinzoku, Japan) were used as the cathode catalyst for H2 evolution. A mixture of Pt/CB and Nafion ionomer (weight ratio 1:1) in propanol was used as the cathode catalyst ink for preparation of ionomer-mixed Pt/CB films (0.1 mgPt cm−2). To fabricate a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), the ionomer-mixed Pt/CB films and TiO2 electrodes were hot pressed onto each side of a Nafion N117 membrane (thickness of 183 μm, DuPont, USA) at 140 °C with pressures of 15 kN and 10 kN, respectively.
PEC measurements in the gas phase
A two electrode system was used in an H-type dual-compartment glass reactor and a planar-type dual-compartment stainless-steel reactor (see Fig. S2†). The sizes of the Nafion membrane and electrodes were 40 × 40 mm2 and 14 × 14 mm2 for the H-type reactor and 80 × 80 mm2 and 50 × 50 mm2 for the planar-type reactor. The water vapor (3 vol%, relative humidity > 90%) was prepared by passing argon through a bubbler filled with deionized water at room temperature and introduced to the dual compartments with each flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The relative humidity was measured by a humidity transmitter (EE33, E+E Elektronik, Austria). The direct-current voltage between the two electrodes was controlled by the potentiostat. Photoirradiation was performed for the TiO2 electrodes using UV LEDs (central λ = 365 nm and 385 nm). The irradiation area was 2 cm2 for the H-type reactor and 16 cm2 for the planar-type reactor. The exhaust gases were analyzed by online gas chromatographs equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-8A and GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan). Molecular Sieve 5A and ShinCarbon ST columns were used for the gas separation with argon and helium, respectively, as the carriers gases.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the Ti microfiber calcined in the air at 650 °C for 2 h, which is denoted as R650 hereafter. The XRD pattern of the Ti microfiber was consistent with that of hexagonal α-Ti (PDF #00-044-1294). After the calcination at 650 °C, the peaks assigned to hexagonal α-Ti broadened and the peaks assigned to rutile TiO2 (PDF #00-021-1276) emerged. The broadening is due to the formation of hexagonal Ti3O (PDF #01-073-1583) (see Fig. S3†). Raman spectrum of R650 displayed bands at 606, 437, and 239 cm−1, which are assigned to the A1g mode, Eg mode, and second-order scattering of rutile TiO2, respectively.32 The rutile TiO2 phase was obtained by thermal oxidation of Ti microfiber felt.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the rutile TiO2 layer on R650. The macrostructure of the microfiber felt was not changed by calcination at 650 °C. The microfibers are folded to form a network-like structure with macroporous void spaces. The porous structure will be an essential property for their use as a substrate of gas diffusion electrodes. The cross-sectional images show square-like shapes with diameters of about 20 μm. The surface nanostructure changed from a flat to a grainy texture after the formation of rutile TiO2. Needle-like nanostructures were observed in some parts of the surface.

Fig. 3 shows the results of EDS elemental analysis of the cut surface of the thermally oxidized Ti fiber. The cross-sectional SEM image shows that the thickness of the TiO2 layer was about 0.6 μm. The atomic percentages of Ti and O were 20–30% and 60–70% at the surface region and 70–80% and 10–15% at the bulk, which was exposed by the cutting. Carbon was detected as an impurity from the carbon tape for sample adhesion. The formation of the thermally oxidized layer on the Ti surface was confirmed by the oxygen-enriched region at the boundary. The Ti–K and O–K elemental mapping images clearly showed the oxygen-enriched thin layer around the square cross-section of the microfibers.

PEC properties of R650 were investigated by a three-electrode configuration in a conventional aqueous electrolyte (pH 6.7). The cyclic voltammograms of R650 (Fig. 4a) show the negligible current in dark and anodic current under UV irradiation. This behavior agreed with the typical behavior of n-type semiconductor electrodes under anodic polarization. The photocurrent onset potential was about −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl in the forward scan, indicating that water oxidation was induced at ERHE > +0.3 V under UV irradiation. The photocurrent was increased by calcination at 650 °C for 2 h accompanied by the formation of the rutile TiO2 crystallites (see Fig. S3 and S4†). The microfiber felt calcined at 750 °C for 2 h was difficult to apply to the electrode because it exhibited brittle behaviour.

Inset shows the normalized action spectra. 

Fig. 4b shows a plot of 1/C2 of R650 in the applied potential function. Flatband potential (EFB) was determined by using the Mott–Schottky equation, 1/C2 = (2/(q × ε × ε0 × ND)) (E − Efb − kT/q), where q is the elementary electric charge, ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum and kT/q is the thermal voltage. The EFB of R650 was −0.06 V vs. RHE, which was similar to the reported values for rutile TiO2.23,24,33 The difference between the EFB and the photocurrent onset potential (ERHE = 0.3 V) is an overpotential required to suppress the fast recombination of photoexcited electron and hole. The donor density (ND) of the n-type semiconductor was calculated from the positive slope to be 2.2 × 1018 cm−3 using an ε of 86 for the rutile TiO2. The ND value was similar to the reported values of TiO2 electrodes.33

Fig. 4c shows steady-state Jphoto of R650 at 1.2 V vs. RHE under 365 nm UV (I0 = 43 mW cm−2). The IPCE was calculated to be 17.5%. This efficiency was lower than the IPCE of an anatase TNTA electrode (26.5%) measured under the same conditions.21Fig. 4d shows the action spectra of IPCE at λ of the incident light. The IPCE of TNTA was higher than that of R650 at λ ≤ 370 nm, whereas there was no significant difference at 385 nm (12.2% for TNTA and 13.7% for R650). In the normalized action spectra, the onset of IPCE was estimated to be 385 nm and 405 nm, which corresponds to 3.22 eV and 3.06 eV for TNTA and R650, respectively. The energies are similar to the reported band gaps of anatase (3.2 eV) and rutile (3.0 eV), respectively.23
The R650 photoanode was applied to a PEM–PEC cell for a water vapor splitting reaction. Nafion ionomer-mixed Pt/CB catalyst film was used as an H2-evolving cathode. The MEA composed of a photoanode, a Nafion membrane, and a cathode was installed in an H-type dual-compartment glass reactor (Fig. S2a,† irradiation area 2 cm2). The PEC properties were investigated using a two electrode configuration under continuous flows of humidified argon into the two compartments at room temperature.

Fig. 5a shows the cyclic voltammograms of the MEA in the 3 vol% water vapor flow. There is no chemical potential difference between the two compartments. The current response was negligible in the dark. We confirmed that bare R650 exhibited a photocurrent response under the gas-phase conditions, but the Jphoto was small compared with that in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we found that the drop casting of a Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer dispersion on R650 drastically enhanced the Jphoto of the MEA. The enhanced Jphoto by Nafion ionomer coating was also reported for other semiconductor electrodes.20,21

(b) Effect of Nafion ionomer coating on the photocurrent at an applied voltage (ΔE) of 1.2 V. (c) Loading amount of Nafion ionomer as a function of the number of coatings. (d) Effect of Nafion ionomer loading on IPCE at a ΔE of 1.2 V. 

Fig. 5b shows the steady-state Jphoto of R650 in the PEM–PEC cell. The ΔE was set to 1.2 V between the O2-evolving photoanode and the ionomer-mixed Pt/CB catalyst cathode. The Jphoto of R650 gradually increased with an increase in the coating time of the 5 wt% Nafion ionomer dispersion. The drop amount was 10 μL cm−2 for each coat. Fig. 5c shows the loading of Nafion ionomer determined using an analytical balance. The weight of ionomer loading increased with the number of coating treatments (about 0.5 mg cm−2 per coating). Fig. 5d summarizes the relationship between the IPCE, which is converted from the steady-state Jphoto at 1.2 V, and the ionomer loading on the R650. The IPCE was proportional to the ionomer loading below 2.0 mg cm−2 and became saturated at the fourth coating. Importantly, the saturated IPCE of 17% was consistent with that of bare R650 in the aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 4c). This suggests that the Nafion ionomer coating improved the proton-coupled electron transfer, which was the rate determining step in the gas-phase reaction. It is proposed that solid electrolyte thin film coatings provide a gas–electrolyte–semiconductor triple-phase boundary on the photoanodes.20,21 Nafion ionomer is also adsorbent for a low concentration of water vapor in the gas phase. The hydrated ionomer shows proton conductivity even at room temperature.34

Fig. 6 shows EDS fluorine mapping images of Nafion ionomer-coated R650 microfiber felt. The content of fluorine and carbon increased with the increase in number of coatings of Nafion ionomer (the molecular structure is shown in the inset of Fig. 5c). The mapping image shows that the Nafion ionomer covered the microfibers and some of the polymer electrolytes aggregated in the void spaces at the intersection of the microfibers. The coating was not homogeneous, but the microfibers were almost covered by the ionomer after three coating treatments. The electrolyte covers not only the surface but also the middle part of the microfiber felt (Fig. S5†).

We further investigated the PEC properties of the ionomer-coated R650 in the H-type glass reactor under UV irradiation with different λ and I0. Fig. 7a shows the spectrum of LEDs with a central λ of 365 nm and 385 nm. The full width at half maximum was about 10 nm. The I0 was linearly controlled by the LED forward voltage. Fig. 7b shows the steady-state Jphoto of Nafion ionomer-coated TNTA and R650 electrodes under 365 nm and 385 nm UV (I0 = 40 mW cm−2). The Jphoto of TNTA (IPCE = 21%) was higher than that of R650 under 365 nm (IPCE = 16%). However, the trend was reversed under violet light (λ > 380 nm). The IPCE of R650 (11%) was much higher than that of TNTA (5.6%). This is probably because the bandgap of rutile TiO2 is narrower than that of anatase.

(c) IPCE action spectra at 1.2 V. The inset shows the I0 of monochromatic light for IPCE measurements. (d) Effect of light intensities (λ = 365 nm and 385 nm) on the IPCE of R650 and TNTA at 1.2 V. 

Fig. 7c shows IPCE action spectra for the oxidation of water vapor in the PEM–PEC reactor. The spectra in the gas-phase were similar to that in the aqueous electrolyte. The IPCE of R650 (17.4%) was higher than that of TNTA (13.1%) at 385 nm and lower than that at λ ≤ 370 nm. The ionomer-coated R650 exhibited a photoresponse even under 400 nm irradiation (IPCE = 1.9%) owing to the bandgap of rutile (3.0 eV). The IPCE of TNTA at 365 nm in the action spectra (41%) was much higher than that recorded under a I0 of 40 mW cm−2. This was because the IPCE in the action spectra was obtained at a low I0 (0.8 mW cm−2) as shown in the inset of Fig. 7c. The IPCE was found to be decreased with an increase of I0 (Fig. 7d). The decrease of IPCE was significant under 365 nm irradiation compared with 385 nm irradiation. This may be related to the difference in the penetration depth of the light into the semiconductor surface at wavelengths near the band gap. The light penetration depth at 365 nm is shorter than that at 385 nm for anatase TiO2 (band gap 3.2 eV).35,36 Many holes are generated inside the electric field of anatase TNTA (film thickness 5 μm) under 365 nm irradiation with low intensity. The PEC performance of the rutile TiO2 electrode was comparable with the anatase TNTA electrode at high I0 (40 mW cm−2, λ = 365 nm).
A planar-type dual-compartment stainless-steel reactor, which has a UV irradiation area of 16 cm2 (Fig. S2b†), was used for PEC water vapor splitting to evolve H2 and O2 separately. The TNTA and R650 electrodes with four coats of Nafion ionomer were applied to the MEA as O2-evolving photoanodes. Fig. 8a and Table 1 show that the photocurrent of R650 (IPCE = 8.7%) was higher than that of TNATA (IPCE = 4.8%) at an ΔE of 1.2 V under 385 nm irradiation. The IPCE was lower than that observed in the H-type glass reactor because of the insufficient current collection owing to the increase of the electrode area from 1 cm2 to 25 cm2.

The gases evolved in the photoanode and cathode compartments, which were separated by a Nafion membrane, were analysed by different gas chromatographs. In the cathode compartment, we observed the formation of H2 as a product (Fig. 8b). The H2 evolution rate was consistent with half of the electron flow (e−/2), which passed through the outer circuit. The current efficiency of H2 was close to 100% (Faraday efficiency (FE) shown in Table 1). This indicates that the two-electron reduction of protons by photoexcited electrons is promoted on the Pt/C catalyst electrode. The H2 evolution rate of R650 was 5.5 μmol min−1, which was about 1.8 times higher than the rate of the TNTA photoanode, at 1.2 V under 385 nm illumination. The yield of H2 was calculated to be about 20%, which is the ratio of the H2 produced from the cathode compartment to the H2O fed into the photoanode compartment.
In the photoanode compartment (Fig. 8c), we observed O2 evolution by four-electron oxidation of water vapor by photogenerated holes. This indicates that water vapor splitting into H2 and O2 was induced in the PEM–PEC cell. However, the O2 evolution rate was slightly less than one-quarter of the electron flow. The current efficiency of O2 was 94% for R650. It is suggested that there are side reactions in the photoanode compartment.
We detected carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct in the photoanode compartment (Fig. 8d). The evolved CO2 is considered to be generated by the decomposition of the Nafion ionomer. The formation rate of CO2 over R650 was constant in the PEC reaction. This suggests that part of the Nafion ionomer is gradually degraded during the PEC operation in the presence of water vapor. The undesired oxidation of the Nafion ionomer would be promoted by oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals, which can be generated by photogenerated holes (H2O + h+ →·OH + H+). In the case of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell, hydroxyl radicals originating from H2O2 are attributed to the oxidant to degrade ionomers.34 The formation rate of CO2 over TNTA was high immediately after the light was switched on, suggesting the initial formation of·OH for anatase TiO2 photoanode.
As CO2 was detected as a byproduct, we investigated the long-term stability of the PEM–PEC system (see Fig. S6†). It was demonstrated that the photocurrent and H2 evolution rate were increased in the beginning and gradually decreased with the PEC operation time. The photocurrent was decreased to one-third of the initial value after PEC water vapor splitting for 20 h (Table S1†). The removal of the Nafion ionomer from the electrode surface was confirmed by EDS fluorine mapping (Fig. S7†). The carbon and fluorine content decreased by half after the PEC reaction (Table S2†). The degradation of the Nafion ionomer was also observed in the anatase TNTA photoanode. To improve the stability of the PEM–PEC system for gas phase reactions, it is necessary to suppress the CO2 formation by improving the reaction selectivity. The photogenerated holes should be used for O2 evolution reaction without the formation of the oxidants that decompose the ionomer.

Fig. 9 shows the effect of external electric bias on the PEC water vapor splitting over the rutile TiO2 photoanode. The photocurrent was increased with an increase in ΔE. The IPCE was decreased to 1.4% when ΔE was reduced to 0.6 V (Table 2). The current efficiency of H2 was 100%, but that of O2 was 89% suggesting the presence of side reactions at low ΔE. Although the CO2 evolution rate slightly increased with ΔE, the current efficiency of O2 was close to 100% at ΔE higher than 0.9 V. These results demonstrate that a relatively high external voltage should be applied to induce overall water splitting into H2 and O2 (2:1) when using TiO2 photoanodes. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (STH) is calculated from the energy gain of water splitting (reaction Gibbs energy 237 kJ mol−1 and theoretical voltage 1.23 V).2,4 When a bias voltage is applied to the PEC systems, the external energy should be subtracted from the energy gain. Therefore, ΔE has to be reduced to improve STH. The development of n-type semiconductor electrodes with negative Efb and low overpotential is a further challenge in developing a PEM–PEC system for water vapor splitting. However, the all solid system has the capability to reduce the energy required to supply liquid water and separate H2 from O2.

Conclusions
We evaluated the PEC performance of a rutile TiO2 thin layer, which was handily prepared by thermal oxidation of Ti microfiber felt, for the decomposition of water vapor into O2 and proton. The macroporous rutile TiO2 electrode exhibited relatively high PEC properties in an aqueous electrolyte. As reported for anatase TNTA electrode, the photocurrent response in the gas-phase condition was drastically enhanced by the coating of the macroporous surface with Nafion perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer to facilitate proton transport. In the PEM–PEC system (irradiation area 2 cm2), anatase TNTA and rutile TiO2 electrodes exhibited IPCE of 21% and 16% under 365 nm UV irradiation, whereas the IPCE of the rutile (11%) was much higher than that of the anatase (5.6%) under 385 nm UV irradiation. The action spectra indicate that the enhanced photocurrent response of rutile TiO2 is consistent with the bandgap energy. The light intensity dependence revealed that the IPCE of anatase TNTA was only high under low I0. Overall water vapor splitting into H2 (FE = 100%) and O2 (FE = 98%) was successful using the rutile TiO2 photoanode and Pt/C cathode with the benefit of the perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer coating. However, two problems appeared in the PEM–PEC system in this study. One is the undesired oxidation of the Nafion ionomer into CO2 during the PEC water-splitting reaction, which resulted in the gradual decrease of the photocurrent. The other is the high voltage required to improve the IPCE and current efficiency. A challenge for the future is developing semiconductor electrodes with higher selectivity and efficiency to establish robust PEC H2 evolution from water vapor at low applied voltage.
