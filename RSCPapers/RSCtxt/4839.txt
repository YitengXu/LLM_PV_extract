    , Accepted 12th December 2017First published on 19th December 2017AbstractThe aim of the study was to monitor the operational sustainability and efficacy of rainwater harvesting solar pasteurization (SOPAS) treatment systems installed in a local informal settlement in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Indicator organisms, cations and anions were routinely monitored in the tank water before (untreated) and after SOPAS treatment, while molecular-based techniques were used to identify and quantify pathogens associated with rainwater sources. The operational sustainability of the systems was monitored to determine the volume of water produced, the total water usage by the end-user households and the required system maintenance. Anions and cations analyzed for in the untreated and SOPAS treated rainwater were within national and international drinking water guidelines, with the exception of zinc which exceeded the limits in all samples. Additionally, the total coliform, E. coli, fecal coliform and heterotrophic bacteria counts exceeded drinking water guideline limits in 100%, 55%, 36% and 100% of the unpasteurized tank water samples (n = 11), respectively. However, a minimum pasteurization temperature of 66 °C was required to reduce all indicator organism counts to within drinking water standards. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. were still detected following SOPAS treatment. Monitoring of the operational sustainability of the systems indicated that minimal system maintenance was required and that the systems were effectively able to provide water to the participating households during the rainfall periods. Based on microbiological indicator analyses, the SOPAS systems may be used in rural areas and informal settlements for the provision of an alternative water source.

Water impact
Rainwater harvesting has been identified as an alternative and sustainable water source. However, numerous microbiological contaminants are associated with rainwater. The use of decentralized water treatment systems that effectively treat rainwater to within drinking water standards will help alleviate the existing pressures on centralized water supplies and allow for the provision of water in areas with an inadequate water supply.

1. Introduction
Population growth, urbanization and climate change (prolonged and increased droughts) have placed severe pressure on existing centralized governmental water supplies.1,2 While global initiatives such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and more recently the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, the provision of sustainable safe water sources is not always guaranteed.3–5 This problem is exacerbated in Africa where numerous communities resort to utilizing contaminated water sources for potable and domestic purposes.3,6 Thus, while waterborne disease due to the consumption of contaminated drinking water is a significant problem worldwide, 46% of the 502000 deaths attributed to waterborne diarrheal disease each year occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.4 Developing countries (such as South Africa) have thus earmarked domestic rainwater harvesting (RWH) as an additional decentralized water source that could provide clean and potable water directly to the consumer.7–11
However, numerous research groups have detected chemical pollutants, such as heavy metals and pesticides12,13 and microbial contaminants including the commonly described traditional fecal indicators, various pathogenic bacterial and protozoan species, in rainwater.7,9,14,15 Factors such as the type, quality and cleanliness of the catchment area (roof surface), geographical location (level of atmospheric pollution) of the tank and storage conditions (e.g. sealed lid) may all negatively affect the quality of stored rainwater. In addition, while chemical contaminants have not been directly associated with incidences of disease, sporadic outbreaks of infection associated with microbial pathogens have been linked to the utilization of rainwater for potable and domestic purposes,16–18 with immunocompromised individuals, young children and the elderly being at the greatest risk of infection.8
Thus in order to ensure that harvested rainwater is safe to utilize for all daily water requirements, treatment technologies, such as chemical disinfection, filtration, solar disinfection (SODIS) and solar pasteurization (SOPAS), have been investigated for their ability to treat harvested rainwater to within drinking water standards.15,19–21 Although, various limitations have been identified for each method,21 SOPAS has been described as a reliable cost-effective method for the treatment of large volumes of water, with the removal of microbial pathogens being independent of parameters such as, turbidity and pH.19,20,22 In a study conducted by Spinks et al., it was reported that the storage of rainwater at temperatures between 55 °C to 65 °C was sufficient to thermally inactivate heat-resistant bacterial species including Enterococcus spp., Escherichia spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Salmonella spp.2 Moreover, in developing countries, such as South Africa, an extremely high potential for solar power generation exists as a result of the high solar irradiation that is observed across the country annually, with an average direct normal solar irradiance of 7.0 kW h m−2 d−1 reported.23 This, coupled with an average annual rainfall of 464 mm, makes RWH SOPAS systems a viable solution in providing an alternative water source in South Africa.
To date our research group had predominantly conducted pilot-scale SOPAS studies on Welgevallen experimental farm (Stellenbosch, South Africa) to monitor the efficiency of the system.19,24,25 In order to monitor the operational sustainability and maintenance of the systems, field trials were thus conducted in the current study using a newly designed SOPAS system with a 125 L high-grade polyethylene storage tank for the treatment of harvested rainwater on-site in Enkanini informal settlement. This study was launched in Enkanini since currently only 32 communal standpipes service a community consisting of approximately 8000 inhabitants.26 Solar pasteurized rainwater could thus serve as a supplementary or additional water source; and the on-site testing of the systems would provide an improved understanding of the systems' efficiency as (1) various social and technical factors may influence the acceptance of a treatment system within a community,21 (2) the chemical quality of the water was monitored over a 1 year period, thus the possible influence of the RWH SOPAS system components on the chemical quality of the water could be determined and (3) the operational sustainability and required system maintenance can be monitored on-site.
The primary aim of the current study was thus to monitor two RWH SOPAS treatment systems installed in Enkanini informal settlement for their efficiency in providing the community with a safe alternative water source. Moreover, in order to determine if the treated harvested rainwater may be used for potable purposes, the chemical (cations and anions) and microbial (indicator organism analysis) quality of the water was assessed by comparison to national and international water quality guidelines that specify microbial and chemical parameters.27–30 Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were also utilized to screen for pathogens such as Legionella spp. and Pseudomonas spp., generally associated with harvested rainwater. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were then utilized to quantify the pathogens exhibiting high detection frequencies in the harvested rainwater samples. The operational sustainability of the systems was monitored firstly by determining the volume of pasteurized tank water that could be produced by the systems, secondly monitoring the households pasteurized tank water usage and lastly monitoring the required maintenance of the systems as these factors would indicate whether the systems are efficient in serving as an alternative water source in rural areas and peri-urban informal settlements.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Sample site and description of SOPAS systems
Two small-scale (Phungamanzi™ system) SOPAS systems were installed in Enkanini informal settlement, Stellenbosch, South Africa (GPS Coordinates: 33°54′ 28.42′′S 18°25′ 03.56′′E) in August 2015. The first SOPAS system was installed next to a house in Enkanini (site 1) (Fig. 1A) and the second system was installed at a local church (site 2) (Fig. 1B). Site 1 was located on the periphery of the informal settlement, alongside an open field, while site 2 was surrounded by dirt roads that were continuously used throughout the day by the inhabitants of the informal settlement. For both systems, a polyethylene RWH tank (site 1 – 2500 L; site 2 – 5000 L) was installed and connected to the catchment systems constructed from zinc sheeting (roof area: site 1 – 15.27 m2; site 2 – 55.9 m2). The SOPAS systems were connected to the RWH tank at an angle which allowed for the passive flow of harvested rainwater (hereafter referred to as tank water) from the RWH tank into the SOPAS systems (Fig. 1). Information on the working mechanism and water movement through the SOPAS system is described in Strauss et al.25 In total six households had access to the RWH SOPAS systems (three households per site).

The labelled system components are: (A) rainwater harvesting tank, (B) pipe connecting rainwater tank to SOPAS system, (C) storage tank of SOPAS system, (D) high borosilicate glass tubes, (E) outlet tap. 
2.2 Sample collection
For the microbial and chemical analysis of the water produced by the SOPAS systems (Fig. 1), a 5 L sample was collected directly from the rainwater tank (A) (before pasteurization) and the outlet tap of the SOPAS system (E) (after pasteurization). For both systems, pasteurized tank water samples were collected at temperatures exceeding 50 °C [site 1 – 52 °C, 60 °C, 67 °C, 72 °C, 73 °C, 75 °C (duplicate samples collected on different sampling occasions) and 85 °C; site 2 – 53 °C, 58 °C and 66 °C]. For both systems, samples were collected from October 2015 to October 2016 [site 1 (n = 8); site 2 (n = 3)]. The temperature and pH of all water samples was measured at the sampling site using a hand-held mercury thermometer and pH meter (Martini Instruments, Rocky Mount, USA). Rainfall data was obtained from the Stellenbosch Weather Services, Engineering Faculty.31
2.3 Chemical analysis
The chemical quality of the tank water samples, before and after pasteurization, was determined by monitoring cation and anion concentrations as described by Reyneke et al.24 Representative samples of a specific temperature range were analyzed [site 1 – 52 °C, 67 °C, 75 °C and 85 °C; site 2 – 58 °C and 66 °C].
2.4 Culturing of indicator organisms
The microbial quality of the tank water samples collected from sites 1 and 2 were monitored before and after pasteurization treatment. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were enumerated simultaneously according to Dobrowsky et al.,19 while enterococci, fecal coliforms and the heterotrophic plate count (HPC) were enumerated according to Strauss et al.25 All analyses were performed in duplicate.
The regrowth of bacteria in the pasteurized tank water samples where HPC were reduced to below the detection limit [BDL; <1 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 mL], were monitored for two weeks after sampling. Briefly, 20 mL of each pasteurized sample was stored in a sterile McCartney bottle at room temperature and 100 μL of the treated tank water was spread plated onto Reasoner's 2A agar (BD Difco, New Jersey, USA) every second day, for a period of two weeks. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for up to four days.
2.5 Extraction of total genomic DNA from tank water samples
Concentration of 1 L tank water samples and subsequent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extractions were performed for each of the samples collected before and after pasteurization as outlined in Reyneke et al.32
2.6 Genus-specific PCRs for indigenous rainwater pathogens
Primers and PCR conditions as outlined in Table S1 (ESI†) were utilized in the current study for the identification of bacterial and viral pathogens commonly associated with rainwater. Each PCR mixture was performed in a final volume of 25 μL in a T100™ Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All PCR mixtures consisted of 1× Green GoTaq® Flexi buffer (Promega), 2.0 mM MgCl2 (Promega), 0.1 mM dNTP mix (Thermo Scientific Fisher, Finland), 0.1 μM to 1 μM of the respective forward and reverse PCR primers (Table S1†), 1.5 U GoTaq® Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) and 2.5 μL template DNA. For each PCR, sterile distilled H2O was used as a negative control, while genomic DNA extracted from ATCC and sequence verified environmental and clinical strains was used as positive controls. The following strains were cultured as positive controls: Legionella pneumophila ATCC 33152, Shigella sonnei ATCC 25931, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Aeromonas hydrophila (environmental strain), Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13385, Serratia marcescens ATCC 13880, Enterococcus faecalis CAB 176, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25925, Streptomyces spp. ATCC 25607 and Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 27729. An adenovirus positive control DNA obtained from Coris BioConcept (Belgium) was also included.
Once the size of all the PCR products had been confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis, representative PCR products were purified and concentrated using the DNA Clean & Concentrator™-5 Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). The cleaned PCR products were sent to CAF at Stellenbosch University for sequencing performed in accordance with the BigDye Terminator Version 3.1 Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems®, Foster City, USA). Sequences were examined using FinchTV version 1.4.0 software and identification completed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Sequences that showed >97% similarity to organisms on the database were recorded.
2.7 Quantitative PCR parameters for readily detected indigenous rainwater pathogens
In order to quantify the indigenous rainwater pathogens exhibiting the highest frequency of detection percentages (as identified during conventional PCR analysis), qPCR assays were conducted using a LightCycler® 96 (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) instrument in combination with the FastStart Essential DNA Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) as outlined in Reyneke et al.32 The primer pairs LegF/R (Legionella spp.),33 PS1/2 (Pseudomonas spp.),34 rpoD-20-F/R (Salmonella spp.)35 and PanStaphF/R (Staphylococcus spp.),36 were utilized for the respective qPCR assays. Quantitative PCR analysis of the tank water samples was only conducted for the water samples collected from site 1, as the samples had a broader temperature range as compared to site 2. Representative PCR products of each of the qPCR assays were cleaned and concentrated and sequenced as described in section 2.6.
2.8 Operational sustainability of the SOPAS systems
In order to determine whether RWH in combination with SOPAS treatment systems may serve as an alternative water source in rural areas and peri-urban informal settlements, the operational sustainability of the systems was monitored. Only participating households within the community had access to the pasteurized tank water, while the research team had access to both the untreated and pasteurized tank water. Ethical clearance exemption was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee (Humanities) Stellenbosch University, as the participating households would only utilize the pasteurized water for domestic activities such as washing, bathing and laundry. It was strongly recommended that the water should not be used for potable/drinking purposes. In order to determine whether the SOPAS systems would be able to produce an adequate volume of water for the households to use, the volume of pasteurized tank water (m = kg h−1) that could theoretically be produced was calculated as described by Dobrowsky et al.19 Additionally, the municipal and treated tank water usage over the monitoring period for each of the six participating households was recorded by completing a weekly questionnaire.
2.9 Statistical analysis
The data obtained from the microbial and chemical analysis and the temperature of the collected tank water samples (before pasteurization and after pasteurization), was assessed using the statistical software package Statistica™ Ver. 12.6 (Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). The means of duplicate replicates were used during data analysis. Analysis was performed to determine whether the data differed significantly following pasteurization using the parametric paired t-test and then confirmed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. In all hypothesis tests, a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05) was used as standard.37
3. Results
3.1 Physico-chemical properties
For site 1, an overall mean pH of 7.15 and 7.68 was obtained for the pasteurized (n = 8) and unpasteurized (n = 8) tank water samples, respectively. Correspondingly, an overall mean pH of 7.50 was obtained for all pasteurized (n = 3) tank water samples collected at site 2, while a mean pH of 7.67 was measured for all unpasteurized tank water samples (n = 3). The temperature of the unpasteurized tank water samples collected directly from the RWH tank ranged from 20.8 °C to 25.9 °C and 20.7 °C to 24.5 °C, for sites 1 and 2, respectively.
3.2 Chemical analysis
Results for the chemical analyses of the tank water samples, collected from both SOPAS systems before and after treatment, indicated that all anions (results not shown) and cations (Table 1; representative cations presented) were within the drinking water guidelines according to the Department of Water Affairs (DWAF), South African National Standards (SANS) 241, Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (ADWG) and World Health Organization (WHO),27–30 with the exception of zinc (Zn) which exceeded the DWAF and ADWG limit of 3000 μg L−1 and the 5000 μg L−1 limit as stipulated by SANS 241, in four of the six sampling sessions analyzed (site 1–52 °C and 75 °C; site 2–58 °C and 66 °C).27–29 However, for both SOPAS systems no significant difference (site 1: p = 0.21; site 2: p = 0.76) in Zn concentrations was observed between the unpasteurized and pasteurized samples.

3.3 Indicator bacteria detected in the tank water samples
Total coliforms, E. coli, heterotrophic bacteria, fecal coliforms and enterococci were enumerated in all collected samples, with the results compared to various national and international drinking water guidelines to determine if the water could be used for potable purposes.27–30 All tank water samples collected before and after pasteurization from both sites 1 and 2 were within the <1 CFU per 100 mL enterococci guideline limit as stipulated by ADWG, as no enterococci were detected (results not shown).29 Additionally, fecal coliforms were only detected in 38% (n = 3; mean 2.2 × 103 CFU per 100 mL) of the unpasteurized samples collected from site 1 and one unpasteurized sample (1.0 × 103 CFU per 100 mL) collected from site 2. All fecal coliforms were however reduced to BDL (<1 CFU per 100 mL) and were within the drinking water standards in the corresponding pasteurized samples (minimum of 53 °C required) (results not shown).27–30

Escherichia coli was detected in 75% (n = 6) of the unpasteurized tank water samples collected from site 1 (mean 8 CFU per 100 mL) and exceeded the drinking water standards, which stipulate that no E. coli (<1 CFU per 100 mL) may be present in water if it is to be used for potable purposes.27–30 However, the detected E. coli was reduced to BDL (<1 CFU per 100 mL) following pasteurization treatment for the respective samples (minimum of 52 °C required). In contrast, no E. coli was detected in both the unpasteurized and pasteurized tank water samples collected from site 2 (results not shown).
All the unpasteurized tank water samples collected from sites 1 and 2 exceeded the DWAF (<5 CFU per 100 mL) and SANS 241 (<10 CFU per 100 mL) drinking water standards for total coliforms.27,28 For site 1, a mean total coliform count of 1.4 × 103 CFU per 100 mL before pasteurization was reduced to 2.9 × 102 CFU per 100 mL after pasteurization (0.68log reduction) at 52 °C. However, for the remaining samples pasteurized at 60 °C and above (n = 7), a mean total coliform count of 7.0 × 103 CFU per 100 mL before pasteurization was reduced to BDL (<1 CFU per 100 mL) after pasteurization treatment (3.84log reduction) (results not shown). Similar to the results obtained for site 1, on average a 3log reduction in total coliforms was observed in the pasteurized samples collected from site 2, as the mean total coliform counts were reduced from 1.0 × 103 CFU per 100 mL before pasteurization to BDL (<1 CFU per 100 mL) after pasteurization for all temperatures analyzed (n = 3) (results not shown).
According to the DWAF drinking water guidelines, HPC should not exceed 1.0 × 104 CFU per 100 mL as this increases the likelihood of microbial infection related to the use of the water source.27 For site 1, with the exception of the 52 °C and 60 °C samples where HPC was still detected following solar pasteurization treatment (mean of 5.3 × 106 CFU per 100 mL reduced to 3.6 × 105 CFU per 100 mL after pasteurization), a 6.78log reduction in HPC was observed at pasteurization temperatures of 67 °C and above, as the HPC was reduced from a mean of 6.3 × 106 CFU per 100 mL before pasteurization to BDL (<1 CFU per 100 mL) after pasteurization (results not shown). For site 2, a mean decrease of 0.71log in HPC was recorded for the samples collected at 53 °C and 58 °C following pasteurization (mean of 1.4 × 107 CFU per 100 mL before pasteurization reduced to a mean of 2.7 × 106 CFU per 100 mL after pasteurization), while a 6.64log reduction was recorded for the sample treated at 66 °C [4.4 × 106 CFU per 100 mL reduced to BDL (<1 CFU per 100 mL) after pasteurization] (results not shown).
As no heterotrophic bacteria were detected in the 67 °C, 72 °C, 73 °C, both 75 °C (1 and 2) and the 85 °C pasteurization samples collected from site 1 and the 66 °C pasteurization sample collected from site 2, the samples were subsequently monitored for a two week period in order to determine how long the treated tank water could be stored. The results then indicated that the water could be stored for up to six days after treatment at 66 °C and 67 °C and up to two weeks following treatment above 72 °C, before microbial regrowth occurred (results not shown).
3.4 Genus-specific PCRs for identification of indigenous rainwater pathogens
For site 1, Aeromonas spp. and Shigella spp. were not detected in any of the unpasteurized or pasteurized tank water samples (results not shown), while Bacillus spp. (GenBank Accession no. KJ534453.1) were detected in 25% (n = 2) of the unpasteurized and 13% (n = 1; 60 °C) of the pasteurized tank water samples (Fig. 2). Similarly, Enterococcus spp. (Accession no. CP014529.1) and Yersinia spp. (Accession no. CP016945.1) were detected in 25% (n = 2) of the unpasteurized tank water samples, but were not detected in any tank water samples following pasteurization treatment. Salmonella spp. (Accession no. CP009565.1) and adenovirus (Accession no. K01264.1) were then only detected in 50% (n = 4) and 38% (n = 3) of the unpasteurized tank water samples, respectively, but were also absent in the pasteurized tank water samples (Fig. 2). In contrast, Klebsiella spp. (Accession no. AF303617.1) and Streptomyces spp. (Accession no. KP082881.1) were both detected in 75% (n = 6) of the unpasteurized tank water samples and in 25% (n = 2; Klebsiella spp., 72 °C and 73 °C; Streptomyces spp., 60 °C and 72 °C) of the pasteurized tank water samples. Similarly, Serratia spp. (Accession no. CP005927.1) were detected in 63% (n = 5) of the unpasteurized tank water samples, whereafter the detection of this organism in the pasteurized samples decreased to 38% (n = 3; 52 °C, 67 °C and 72 °C). Both Pseudomonas spp. (Accession no. LC130640.1) and Staphylococcus spp. (Accession no. CP009623.1) were detected in 88% (n = 7) of the unpasteurized tank water samples, however, Pseudomonas spp. were only detected in 38% (n = 3; 60 °C, 72 °C and 75 °C) of the pasteurized tank water samples, while Staphylococcus spp. were detected in 50% (n = 4; 52 °C, 72 °C, 73 °C and 75 °C) of the pasteurized tank water samples. Legionella spp. (Accession no. LC094348.1) were the most prevalent opportunistic pathogens as it was detected in 100% (n = 8) of the unpasteurized tank water samples, while 88% (n = 7; 52 °C, 60 °C, 67 °C, 72 °C, 73 °C, 75 °C and 85 °C) of the pasteurized tank water samples tested positive for the presence of Legionella spp.

For site 2, Aeromonas spp. and Shigella spp., Bacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Serratia spp. and Yersinia spp. were not detected in any of the unpasteurized or pasteurized tank water samples (results not shown). Klebsiella spp. and adenovirus were detected in 33% (n = 1) of the unpasteurized tank water samples. However, Klebsiella spp. were not detected in any pasteurized tank water samples, while adenovirus was detected in one of the pasteurized tank water samples (58 °C) (results not shown). Additionally, while Staphylococcus spp. and Streptomyces spp. were detected in all unpasteurized tank water samples (n = 3), they were only detected in 67% (n = 2; Staphylococcus spp., 53 °C and 66 °C; Streptomyces spp., 53 °C and 58 °C) of the pasteurized tank water samples, respectively. In contrast, Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp., were detected in all unpasteurized and pasteurized tank water samples (n = 3), respectively (results not shown).
3.5 Quantitative PCR analysis of the prevalent indigenous rainwater pathogens
Based on the results obtained during the conventional PCR analysis of the tank water samples collected from sites 1 and 2, Legionella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. were identified as the most readily detected indigenous rainwater pathogens and were thus quantified using qPCR. However, during the Staphylococcus spp. qPCR analysis, multiple melting peaks were obtained in a single sample for the melt curve analysis, which indicated that non-specific binding of the primers occurred. The accurate quantification of Staphylococcus spp. could thus not be performed and subsequently the gene copies for only Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. were quantified for the small-scale SOPAS system located at site 1 (broader temperature range obtained at site 1 as compared to site 2).
The qPCR assays for the quantification of Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. (Fig. 3) had an average amplification efficiency (E) of 93% (1.86), 92% (1.84) and 97% (1.94), respectively, while the linear regression coefficient (R2) for all three assays was 0.99. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) for the Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. qPCR assays was 8 to 12 gene copies per μL, 5 to 11 gene copies per μL and 6 to 9 gene copies per μL, respectively.
 Fig. 3  Quantification of Legionella spp. (A), Pseudomonas spp. (B) and Salmonella spp. (C) in the tank water samples collected from the SOPAS system at site 1. 
The qPCR analysis for Legionella spp. indicated that there was a significant (p = 0.034) mean reduction (89.03%; 0.96log reduction) in 23S rRNA gene copies per mL following SOPAS treatment (Fig. 3A). For the samples collected before pasteurization, the gene copies ranged from 5.88 × 105 gene copies per mL to 7.67 × 106 gene copies per mL (mean of 2.86 × 106 gene copies per mL), while the gene copies ranged from 6.44 × 104 gene copies per mL to 7.38 × 105 gene copies per mL (mean of 3.13 × 105 gene copies per mL) after SOPAS treatment.
Similarly, the qPCR analysis for Pseudomonas spp. indicated that there was a mean reduction (p = 0.058) (93.42%; 1.18log reduction) in oprI gene copies per mL following SOPAS treatment (Fig. 3B). For the samples collected before pasteurization, the gene copies ranged from 2.26 × 106 gene copies per mL to 9.27 × 107 gene copies per mL (mean of 2.02 × 107 gene copies per mL), while the gene copies ranged from 6.62 × 104 gene copies per mL to 3.52 × 106 gene copies per mL (mean of 1.33 × 106 gene copies per mL) after SOPAS treatment.
The qPCR analysis for Salmonella spp. also indicated that there was a significant (p = 0.0057) mean reduction (83.79%; 0.79log reduction) in rpoD gene copies per mL following SOPAS treatment (Fig. 3C). For the samples collected before pasteurization, the gene copies ranged from 1.18 × 105 gene copies per mL to 2.72 × 106 gene copies per mL (mean of 1.03 × 106 gene copies per mL), while the gene copies ranged from 1.86 × 104 gene copies per mL to 6.70 × 105 gene copies per mL (mean of 1.67 × 105 gene copies per mL) after SOPAS treatment.
3.6 Operational sustainability of the SOPAS systems

3.6.1 Volume of pasteurized tank water produced by the SOPAS systems. 
The total thermal energy (Q) of the SOPAS system was calculated as 620 W (62 W per evacuated tube; personal communication), which was converted to 2232 kJ h−1 (3.6 MJ = 1 kW h). The theoretical volume of pasteurized tank water produced (m) could then be calculated by using the specific heat (cp) of water (4.2 J g−1 °C) and the unpasteurized (input) and pasteurized (output) temperatures of the collected tank water samples according to Dobrowsky et al.19
Using an average of 6 h sunshine per day, 1000 W m−2 solar irradiance and a 30% solar energy conversion rate, 17.14 kg h−1, 12.75 kg h−1, 10.84 kg h−1 and 8.74 kg h−1 pasteurized tank water could be produced at 52 °C, 60 °C to 67 °C, 72 °C to 75 °C and 85 °C, respectively, for the SOPAS system located at site 1. Similarly for site 2, 16.25 kg h−1 pasteurized water could be produced for the 53 °C to 58 °C temperature range, while 12.81 kg h−1 pasteurized water could be produced for the 66 °C pasteurization temperature.


3.6.2 Monitoring the water usage by the households utilizing the SOPAS systems. 
In order to monitor the water usage for each of the six participating households, a co-researcher on the project (inhabitant of Enkanini informal settlement) was provided with a log book for each site. The co-researcher visited the participating households every Friday from September 2015 to October 2016 to obtain information on the volume of water utilized (SOPAS systems) by the respective households for domestic activities including bathing, cleaning and laundry (pasteurized water was not used for drinking purposes). Additionally, the rainfall over the monitoring period was recorded as it would affect pasteurized tank water availability.
Based on the observed total rainfall, the monitoring period could be divided into low, medium and high rainfall periods. A total rainfall of 61.0 mm was recorded during October 2015 to February 2016 (low rainfall period), while 84.7 mm was recorded during March to May 2016 (medium rainfall period). The rainfall then increased to 276.4 mm during June to September 2016 (high rainfall period) and decreased again to 16.5 mm during October 2016 (start of second low rainfall period).
In total three households had access to the SOPAS system located at site 1. For ease of analysis, the households were designated and identified using the codes house 1 (5 residents), house 2 (3 residents) and house 3 (3 residents). Monitoring of the pasteurized tank water usage indicated that 68 L per week, 65 L per week and 105 L per week, of pasteurized tank water was being used by house 1, 2 and 3, respectively, during the low rainfall period. However, during the medium rainfall period there was a decrease in tank water usage recorded, as house 1, 2 and 3 reported using 45 L per week, 25 L per week and 47 L per week. An increase in pasteurized tank water usage was then observed during the high rainfall periods as 165 L per week, 145 L per week and 135 L per week, of pasteurized tank water was being used by house 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
In total three households had access to the SOPAS system installed at site 2. For ease of analysis, each household was designated and identified by the codes church 1 (1 resident), church 2 (4 residents) and church 3 (4 residents). Monitoring of the pasteurized tank water usage indicated that 90 L per week, 104 L per week and 130 L per week, of pasteurized tank water was being used by church 1, 2 and 3, respectively, during the low rainfall period. However, as was observed with site 1, during the medium rainfall period there was a decrease in tank water usage recorded, as church 1, 2 and 3 reported using 50 L per week, 40 L per week and 50 L per week, respectively. An increase in pasteurized tank water usage was then observed during the high rainfall periods as 69 L per week, 61 L per week and 75 L per week, of pasteurized tank water was being used by church 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
Although the required SOPAS system maintenance was mostly limited to cleaning the surface of the borosilicate glass tubes (prevent dust accumulation that may affect system efficiency), one borosilicate glass tube had to be replaced at each system during the monitoring period. However, no specialized equipment was required and replacement of the tubes could be performed in <10 min.

4. Discussion
Alternative technologies that improve water provision, such as the RWH SOPAS treatment systems investigated in the current study, may contribute to the provision of water sources in rural areas and peri-urban informal settlements. However, before a potential new water source is used for drinking purposes, it is essential that both the chemical and microbiological quality of the water is assessed, as various water contaminants have been shown to cause adverse health effects if consumed.5
The results obtained for the physico-chemical (pH) analysis of the unpasteurized and pasteurized tank water samples collected from sites 1 (pH range of 6.5 to 8.4) and 2 (pH range of 6.7 to 8.4), indicated that the pH of the tank water samples, fell within the target quality range (6.0 to 9.0) as stipulated by DWAF.27 The pH of rainwater is an important consideration of water quality, as Abbasi and Abbasi stated that a pH of less than 6 could lead to the corrosion of metal surfaces which could result in the subsequent leaching of toxic metals such as lead (Pb), Zn and copper (Cu) from the roofing material into the rainwater.38 This is of concern as long-term exposure to metals, can lead to impaired cognitive and behavioral development in children or degenerative neurological disorders in adults.39
In the current study, all anion concentrations were within drinking water standards following SOPAS, which corresponded to results reported in literature, where it was shown that the anion levels in tank water samples were generally within drinking water guidelines.10,19,24 Moreover, the results corresponded to previous studies where it was also indicated that SOPAS does not adversely affect anion concentrations.19,24,25 While all the cations analyzed at sites 1 and 2 were within drinking water standards, three unpasteurized and corresponding pasteurized tank water samples exceeded the DWAF and ADWG Zn limit of 3000 μg L−1, while one unpasteurized and corresponding pasteurized tank water sample exceeded the 5000 μg L−1 Zn SANS 241 limit.27–29 Although the Zn concentrations exceeded the recommended guidelines, no adverse health effects are to be expected at the observed concentrations, as adverse health effects have only been reported at concentrations exceeding 10000 μg L−1.27 It is hypothesized that the high Zn concentrations observed in both SOPAS systems can be attributed to the galvanized Zn sheeting, which was used as the catchment roofing material at the respective sites (sites 1 and 2). Metal roofing materials have been shown to be a major contributor of metal ion contamination, as the acidity of rainwater (pH 5.0–5.6) in combination with the exposure of the roof surface to the sun, could facilitate the leaching of metals from the roofing material.40 Additionally, a protective coating of zinc or zinc–aluminum alloy is generally applied to the surface of metal-based roofs to prevent rust accumulation and corrosion of steel.41 This coating may also leach into the water during a rain event and the monitoring of the concentration of zinc in harvested rainwater is therefore an important consideration when analyzing the chemical quality of harvested rainwater.
It has been well documented that numerous pathogens and opportunistic pathogens are associated with stored rainwater and that the levels of microbial contaminants may fluctuate as a result of seasonal variation, the system location and the surrounding environment.38,40 It is therefore essential to monitor the microbial quality of harvested rainwater before it can be used for potable purposes; however, no guidelines for rainwater quality have been formulated. Studies investigating the microbial quality of harvested rainwater thus use various national and international drinking water guidelines as reference.15,42 These guidelines require the monitoring of multiple indicator bacteria such as enterococci, E. coli, fecal coliforms and total coliforms.27–30 The presence of total coliforms indicate that the water source may be prone to contamination by other harmful organisms, while E. coli, enterococci and fecal coliforms serve as an indication of fecal contamination of the water source.7 Monitoring for the removal of these organisms thus serves as an indication of the general water disinfection effectiveness of the SOPAS treatment systems.30
Corresponding to results reported in literature, E. coli, total coliforms, fecal coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria were detected in harvested rainwater during the current study at levels exceeding the various drinking water guidelines.7,19,38 It should however be noted that a minimum temperature of 53 °C (total coliforms, E. coli and fecal coliforms) and 66 °C (heterotrophic bacteria) was sufficient to treat the water to within the drinking water guideline limits.27–30 The results obtained in the current study therefore correspond to results obtained in literature,2,19,25,43,44 where it was demonstrated that at temperatures ranging from 55 °C to 72 °C the microbial contamination in rainwater was reduced to within drinking water standards.27–30 However, as it has been reported that a lack of in-house water supply often results in the storage of the collected water in the home, the regrowth of heterotrophic bacteria after pasteurization at the various temperatures was determined by enumerating the heterotrophic counts.3,5 The results then indicated that the water could be stored for up to six days after treatment at 66 °C and 67 °C and up to two weeks following treatment above 72 °C, before microbial regrowth occurred. In comparison, Dobrowsky et al. indicated that rainwater treated >78 °C could be stored for one week (storage analysis only conducted for one week) without microbial regrowth being observed.19 Although results from the storage analysis of the treated water indicated that the water could effectively be stored in a closed container for up to two weeks, it is important to note that re-contamination of the stored water could occur due to consumer handling practices and unsafe storage conditions (open containers or inadequately cleaned containers), which will negatively influence the storage period of the treated water.5
Genus-specific PCR assays were then utilized to screen for opportunistic pathogens commonly associated with rainwater. Results indicated that a range of opportunistic pathogens were present in the unpasteurized rainwater, including Klebsiella spp., Legionella spp. and Yersinia spp., amongst others, with the detection of the selected opportunistic pathogens in rainwater corresponding to previous studies.14,19,24,25 It is however important to note that a decrease in the frequency of detection of the selected genera was observed with increasing pasteurization temperature. Results from the genus-specific PCR assays then identified Legionella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. as the most readily detected indigenous rainwater pathogens and they were thus quantified using qPCR. However, the accurate quantification of Staphylococcus spp. could not be performed as non-specific binding of the primers occurred within the samples. Quantitative PCR analysis then indicated that while a significant mean decrease in the detection of Legionella spp. (89.0%), Pseudomonas spp. (93.4%) and Salmonella spp. (83.8%) was observed following SOPAS treatment at site 1, these bacteria persisted in the treated rainwater. The results obtained during the current study for both sites, thus correspond to the results obtained in, where Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella spp., were detected in tank water samples after pasteurization treatment above 73 °C.19 While it is important to note that the conventional PCR and qPCR assays utilized in the current study cannot provide an indication of the viability of the detected organisms as DNA may persist in the environment after cell death,45 Moore et al. stated that the consistent detection of nucleic acid sequences from pathogenic bacteria in an environment can indicate potential health risks, as the detected organisms would likely be viable as they are either consistently introduced into the environment or they are able to proliferate.46 It is thus hypothesized that the opportunistic pathogens detected by conventional PCR and qPCR in the untreated and treated rainwater may be continuously introduced into the RWH systems in two ways. Firstly, it has been proposed that bioaerosol particles (suspension of airborne particles that contain living organisms) may contaminate rainwater during a rainfall event by acting as cloud condensation nuclei which enable the transfer of microbial pathogens into rainwater through cloud droplets as the cloud and rain droplets traverse the atmosphere.47,48 This proposal was then supported by the detection of Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus spp. in bioaerosol particles49,50 and the detection of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in freshly captured rainwater.47,48 Secondly, it has been shown that organic debris and fecal matter (which may contain microbial pathogens) deposited on rooftops, will be washed into the RWH tanks during a rainfall event and thereby continuously contaminate the harvested rainwater.8,14,51 Moreover, research has demonstrated that certain pathogenic microorganisms are able to survive disinfection treatments, such as SOPAS, as a result of heat shock proteins,52,53 their ability to form and proliferate within biofilms,53,54 ability to form survival structures such as endospores or cysts55 and finally, certain bacteria such as Legionella spp. and Pseudomonas spp., can survive as intracellular parasites of protozoa.52 Additionally, it has been reported that bacteria are able to undergo an adaptive response and build-up resistance to an environmental stressor such as high temperatures, if constantly exposed to the same stress condition.56
The detection of specifically Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. in the treated rainwater is thus of concern as these organisms are considered opportunistic pathogens and pose a serious health risk to especially immunocompromised individuals.57,58 The consumption of water containing Salmonella spp. has been associated with gastroenteritis (abdominal pain and diarrhea),59 while the risk of infection from Pseudomonas spp. is primarily limited to nosocomial infections resulting in pneumonia, urinary tract infections and bacteremia when the organism comes into contact with an open wound.60,61 In contrast, based on the mode of infection, the risk of infection from Legionella spp. is not associated with the consumption of the water, but rather the inhalation of aerosolized droplets containing Legionella spp., which may be generated during various domestic activities.52 Based on the health risks associated with the diverse range of opportunistic pathogens that may be associated with rainwater sources and their varying modes of infection, quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) studies need to be conducted in order to determine the acceptable exposure levels to these pathogens when using the rainwater for drinking and domestic purposes.
Although the microbiological analysis of the pasteurized tank water indicated that the SOPAS systems were able to reduce the microbial contaminants in the tank water, numerous technical and social factors may influence the effectiveness and acceptance of a particular water treatment system within a community.21 The operational sustainability of the systems was thus determined in order to determine whether the systems may be a viable solution in serving as an alternative water source in rural areas and peri-urban informal settlements. Calculation of the theoretical volume of water that could be produced by the SOPAS systems indicated that depending on the household size, it would be possible for the SOPAS systems to provide a household with a supplementary water source, as the United Nations recommended that individuals living in Sub-Saharan Africa require 25 L per person per day.62 However, it is important to note that the actual volume of water that could be produced by the system will vary from day to day depending on climate conditions.
Monitoring of the water usage by the households at both sites 1 and 2, indicated that the pasteurized tank water usage decreased from the low rainfall period to the medium rainfall period and then increased again during the high rainfall period. The decreased tank water usage in the medium rainfall period in comparison to the low rainfall period may be attributed to the RWH tanks being full at the start of the low rainfall period (systems installed during August 2015 – high rainfall period) and as the water was being utilized on a daily basis, less water was available during the start of the medium rainfall period and therefore less pasteurized tank water was being used by the respective households. However, when the rainwater availability increased during the high rainfall period, pasteurized tank water usage increased. A social perception survey regarding RWH was conducted in Enkanini informal settlement as part of a Water Research Commission (WRC) Report.63 Results from the report indicated that 61% of the respondents were familiar with the concept of RWH and that 67% were favorably inclined towards using rainwater for their daily needs. Moreover, respondents indicated that they would use the water for domestic activities such as bathing, cleaning their house and cooking.63 Personal communication with the households utilizing the systems in the current study then revealed that as the SOPAS systems provided warm water, less paraffin/gas to heat water for domestic purposes was being utilized.
5. Conclusions
The chemical and microbial quality of water produced by two SOPAS systems were assessed in order to determine whether these decentralized systems may be viable solutions in providing inhabitants of peri-urban informal settlements with an alternative water source. Results for the chemical analyses indicated that the roofing material utilized for the catchment system could influence the chemical quality of tank water samples. Research should therefore be conducted to determine the effect of roofing materials generally utilized in informal settlements as well as paints or other materials (rubber coating) commonly used to cover roofing materials, on the chemical quality of harvested rainwater. A reduction in the level of the chemical contaminants detected may then be achieved by combining the current SOPAS technology with filtration systems. The efficacy of different cost-effective filtration systems will however, also need to be investigated in future studies.
Based on culturing analysis, the SOPAS systems were effectively able to reduce the level of indicator organisms detected to within drinking water standards, with a minimum pasteurization temperature of 66 °C required. Although the results of the genus specific PCRs indicated that a pasteurization temperature of 85 °C is required to reduce the majority of indigenous rainwater pathogens to BDL, qPCR analysis revealed that gene copies of Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. were detected following SOPAS treatment. However, as PCR assays cannot assess viability, future studies should assess the viability of the readily detected opportunistic pathogens following water disinfection treatments. The use of molecular-based viability assays would not only provide a better indication as to the treatment efficacy of the disinfection treatment, but will also provide an indication of the health-risks associated with using the water. Moreover, QMRA studies are required to determine whether the treated rainwater is safe to use for drinking purposes. Results from the operational sustainability monitoring then indicated that decentralized RWH SOPAS treatment systems, may be a viable solution in providing the inhabitants of rural areas and peri-urban informal settlements with an alternative water source which could be utilized for domestic purposes.

Water impact
Rainwater harvesting has been identified as an alternative and sustainable water source. However, numerous microbiological contaminants are associated with rainwater. The use of decentralized water treatment systems that effectively treat rainwater to within drinking water standards will help alleviate the existing pressures on centralized water supplies and allow for the provision of water in areas with an inadequate water supply.
