    , Accepted 2nd March 2012First published on 5th April 2012AbstractCrystalline Mn doped ZnO nanowires were synthesized by chemical vapour deposition. The presence of Mn dopant was confirmed by X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photoconductivity of an individual Mn doped ZnO nanowire was investigated under different visible light excitations (532 and 405 nm). The nanowire exhibited high dark to photocurrent ratios (∼50), fast photocurrent response (∼100–250 ms), and reasonably high responsivity and external quantum efficiencies with good repeatability under different visible light illuminations. These results indicate that Mn doped ZnO nanowires would be promising for efficient multispectral photodetectors and optical switches.
Introduction
A wide variety of applications such as solar cells, LEDs, sensors, lasers etc. have been investigated with ZnO nanostructures owing to their unique optical properties.1 ZnO has a large exciton binding energy (60 meV) desirable for laser applications and a wide band gap (3.3 eV) for white and ultraviolet LEDs.2 Among the optoelectronic properties of ZnO, photoconductivity and photodetection have been investigated intensively. Photodetectors are key components for applications in light wave communications, imaging techniques, optical storage devices and optoelectronic circuits.3 ZnO nanowires have been demonstrated to exhibit high photocurrent gain under ultraviolet light illumination and hence have been extensively studied for ultraviolet photodetection.4–6 Electronic, magnetic and optical properties of ZnO nanowires could be effectively tuned by doping with various transition metals. For instance, by doping ZnO nanowires with Cu, photodetectors were fabricated previously.7 Similarly by doping Mn in ZnO thin films by pulsed laser deposition, mid-gap electronic states can be introduced.8 However, Mn doped ZnO has been primarily studied for its magnetic and spintronic properties as it is a dilute magnetic semiconductor.9 The optical properties such as photoconductivity have not been investigated extensively in Mn doped ZnO in different nanostructured morphologies. One dimensional nanostructures provides the advantage of superior photosensitivity due to large surface to volume ratio.3 Therefore the investigation of the optoelectronic properties of Mn doped ZnO (tunable optical properties) in nanowire morphology (high photosensitivity) could pave the way for the development of optical photodetectors, optical switches and image sensors.
In this report, crystalline Mn doped ZnO nanowires were synthesized by chemical vapour growth. A single nanowire device of Mn doped ZnO nanowire was fabricated by focused electron beam induced deposition of platinum (Pt). The photocurrent response of the nanowire device (with 532 nm and 405 nm wavelength laser) and transient response were studied. Despite the photon energy being less than the band gap (∼2.3 eV), the Mn doped ZnO nanowire exhibited a significant photo response (50 times increase in photocurrent) and fast photocurrent rise and decay time (∼200–250 ms). The responsivity (Rλ) of Mn doped ZnO nanowire obtained with sub band gap excitation (green light 532 nm) were comparable to other photodetectors obtained with above band gap excitation. With blue light (405 nm), the Rλ and external quantum efficiency (EQE) (4 A W−1 and 1200%, respectively) were much higher and indicated that Mn doped ZnO nanowires are suited for applications as multispectral photodetectors, optical switches and image sensors.
Experimental section
Mn doped ZnO nanowires were synthesized in a horizontal tube furnace system by the carbo-thermal reduction method. ZnO powder and graphite powder were mixed together at a 1:1 molar ratio and thoroughly ground. This mixture was placed in an alumina boat and located at the centre of the furnace. MnCl2 was used as the dopant source and was placed in a separate alumina boat next to the (ZnO + graphite) boat. Silicon substrates coated with 2 nm Au catalyst were placed 19 cm away from the (ZnO + graphite) source. The system was pumped down to 2 × 10−2 mbar and a constant flow of Ar (200 sccm) and O2 (10 sccm) was maintained in the furnace. The temperature in the tube furnace was ramped up to 900 °C and then maintained for 45 mins. After this the system was allowed to cool down to room temperature while maintaining the gas flow. The surface morphology of the nanowires was examined using a JEOL JSM-7600F field emission scanning electron microscope. Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) was also performed using the same electron microscope. Samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL2100F) were prepared by ultrasonicating the films in ethanol and the suspension was dropped on to the holey carbon–copper grid. High resolution TEM (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy were utilized to analyze the crystal orientation, presence of defects and elemental distribution mapping. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns were collected at room temperature with Bruker D8 Discover using a Cu Kα source radiation. Absorption spectrum was obtained using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). Micro-Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Renishaw System 2000 (excitation wavelength 514 nm and laser spot size ∼2 μm). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the samples was carried out using a VG ESCA Lab-220i XL XPS. Monochromatic Al Kα X-Ray was employed for analysis of one spot on each sample with a photoelectron take-off angle of 90°. The analysis area was 700 μm × 700 μm, while the maximum analysis depth lies in the range of ∼4–8nm. Charge compensation was performed by means of low-energy electron flooding and further correction was made based on adventitious C1s at 285.0 eV using the manufacturer's standard software. The pass energy for survey scan is 150 eV and for high resolution scan is 20 eV. The photoluminescence spectrum was obtained using a He–Cd laser with 325 nm excitation source. The as-grown Mn doped ZnO nanowires were sonicated and drop-cast on Si substrates with an insulating layer of 100 nm SiO2. The substrates were pre-patterned with Cr/Au (10/50 nm) electrodes using standard photolithography techniques. These nanowires were then connected to the electrodes using electron beam induced deposition (EBID) with a platinum (Pt) metal–organic precursor ((CH3)3CH3C5H4Pt) in a FEI Quanta 200 3D dual beam system. Photoconductivity studies of nanowires were performed on single nanowires by using a diode laser (wavelength: 532 nm SUWTECH LDC-2500 and wavelength: 405 nm Power Technology model no: LDCU12/7443) and varying the laser intensity and voltage bias across the nanowire. Photocurrent studies were conducted in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10−5 Torr in a two probe configuration using a Keithley 2636 as the source meter.
Results and discussion
The as-grown Mn doped nanowires obtained by chemical vapour deposition were yellow (inset Fig. 1 (a)) in colour and were uniformly distributed across the silicon substrate. Fig. 1 (a) shows the SEM image of Mn doped ZnO nanowires. The SEM image shows that the morphology of ZnO nanowires has not been affected due to incorporation of Mn as a dopant. The nanowires have lengths ranging from 6–10 μm and diameters of approximately 150–200 nm. The EDX spectrum (supporting information Fig. S1†) clearly reveals the presence of the Mn in the ZnO nanowires with a Mn:Zn ratio of ∼2%. The XRD patterns show that the (100) and (101) peaks of Mn doped ZnO shift to a lower 2θ angle, attributable to the lattice expansion of ZnO (Fig. 1 (b) and supporting information Fig. S2†). As Mn exists in several oxidation states, only Mn2+ is larger than the parent Zn2+ (ionic radii of Mn2+ and Zn2+ in 4-coordination are 0.66 Å and 0.60 Å, respectively).10 Prior to data collection, the height of the sample was adjusted so that the recorded intensity is half the intensity of the incident beam. This ensures that the sample displacement was minimized allowing the observation of the peak shift between Mn doped and undoped ZnO and the determination of lattice parameters accurately. Rietveld refinement of the whole patterns led to the lattice parameters of Mn doped ZnO: a = 3.2519 ± 0.0001 Å, c = 5.2075 ± 0.0002 Å, volume = 47.690 ± 0.003 Å3 and undoped ZnO: a = 3.2501 ± 0.0001 Å, c = 5.2070 ± 0.0002 Å, volume = 47.634 ± 0.004 Å3. The crystallite size for both samples is 75 ± 3 nm. Also, no impurity peaks such as MnO2 were observed in the XRD pattern. Fig. 1 (c) shows the Raman spectrum of Mn doped ZnO nanowire arrays. The E2H mode corresponding to a wavenumber of 437 cm−1 was observed in Mn doped ZnO nanowires. This mode is characteristic of the wurtzite structure of ZnO. The peak at ∼524 cm−1 can be attributed to local vibrations of the substitutional Mn ions and Mn doping induced effects.11 The substitution of Mn ions into the ZnO lattice is also evident due to the higher intensity of E1LO mode in Mn doped ZnO in comparison to undoped ZnO (supporting information Fig. S3). The increase in intensity of the E1LO mode can be attributed to the larger ionic radius of Mn2+ than Zn2+.12 The Raman spectrum provides further evidence of Mn doping of ZnO nanowires in our study. Fig. 1(d) shows the absorption spectrum of Mn doped ZnO nanowires. Absorption edge of the Mn doped ZnO nanowires estimated from the plot of (αhν)2vs. (hν) is around ∼2.18eV. The band gap of the Mn doped ZnO remains similar and the samples display the typical UV photoluminescence peak associated with ZnO13 (supporting information Fig. S4†). It is only the absorption edge which starts from ∼2.18 eV and this is consistent with other reports on Mn doped ZnO thin films (2.2 eV).8

Fig. 2 (a) shows the HRTEM image of the Mn doped ZnO nanowire that was aligned along the [100] zone axis. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) confirmed the crystal structure of ZnO with d002 = 0.26 nm and d010 = 0.28 nm and the growth direction was determined to be along the c axis.14 The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image shows a perfect lattice with contours close to the edge (Fig. 2 (a)). EDX-STEM elemental mapping was performed to study the distribution of the dopant over the nanowires. The amount of Mn dopant was quantified to be 2% by semi-quantitative standardless EDX measurement (Fig. 2 (b)). An elemental map of the nanowire shown on Fig. 2 (c) was obtained for the elements oxygen, manganese and zinc in Fig. 2 (d), (e) and (f), respectively. The Mn dopant was homogenously distributed along the nanowire as confirmed by elemental mapping. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to study the chemical composition and the chemical state of Mn in doped ZnO nanowires. Fig. 3 shows the XPS spectra of Mn doped ZnO nanowires for the different elements of Zn, O and Mn. In Fig. 3 (a), the peaks at binding energies of ∼1021.5 eV and 1044.6 eV corresponds to the energies of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2.15 In Fig. 3 (b), the O1s XPS spectra shows a peak at a binding energy of ∼530 eV and a shoulder peak at ∼532 eV. The peak at 530 eV can be attributed to the Zn–O bond and the shoulder peak to the chemisorbed oxygen.16Fig. 3 (c) shows the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 XPS spectra. The Mn 2p1/2 peak has a binding energy of 641 eV and this indicates the Mn2+ valence state of manganese ions in the nanowires and the substitution of Zn ions with Mn.17,18 The Mn doping concentration was also estimated from XPS data to be ∼2%.

Fig. 4 (a) shows the schematic of the single nanowire device fabricated. The nanowire device was placed in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of 10−5 Torr for 12 h prior to illumination with a 532 nm laser. The laser spot size was 4 mm. Fig. 4 (b) shows the I–V curves of the nanowire in dark and under a light intensity of 320 mW cm−2 and 160 mW cm−2. The voltage was swept from −8 V to 8 V and all measurements were made at room temperature. The distance between the Pt electrodes was ∼5 μm and the nanowire's diameter was ∼180 nm. The Pt electrode and Mn doped ZnO nanowire forms a metal–semiconductor junction where the work function of the metal (Pt = 5.6 eV) was larger than the work function of the semiconductor (ZnO = 4.1eV) resulting in the formation of a Schottky barrier at the Pt–nanowire junction.19 The I–V behavior under illumination with 532 nm laser (320 mW cm−2 and 160 mW cm−2) drastically differs from the dark I–V behavior. The I–V characteristics under illumination present a fairly symmetrical, non-linear behaviour at positive and negative bias. The dark I–V indicates that the nanowire was highly resistive in vacuum. However under illumination with 532 nm laser light (photon energy = 2.33 eV), the conductance of the nanowire increases significantly due to the photogenerated carriers. Fig. 4 (c) shows the variation of photocurrent with light intensity. The photocurrent versus illumination light intensity can be expressed by a power law dependence of the form I = CPθ where I is the photocurrent, C is a constant for a particular wavelength and P is the intensity of illumination and the exponent θ determines the photocurrent response to light intensity.20Fig. 4 (c) shows the photocurrent versus light intensity variation at a bias of 8 V. The photocurrent versus light intensity at a bias of 8 V was fitted with the power law as I ∼ P0.45 indicating a near square root dependence of photocurrent on incident light intensity. Fig. S5 (a) and (b)† show the photocurrent versus intensity at an applied bias of 2V and 5 V. The photocurrent versus intensity dependence at 2 V (I ∼ P0.46) and 5 V (I ∼ P0.43) bias exhibited a similar power law dependence to that of an 8 V bias. When there is a uniform distribution of traps, the photocurrent dependence of the incident light intensity would be linear but an exponential distribution of traps would result in the photocurrent following a square root dependence of the incident light intensity.21 This non-integer power dependence could also be attributed to a complex process of carrier generation, recombination and trapping along the nanowire.20

Photoconductivity in semiconducting metal oxide nanowires can be attributed to the increased charge carrier density by exciting the charge carrier to the conduction band and the oxygen adsorption–desorption process on the nanowire surface.22,23 In Mn doped ZnO, the photoconductivity can originate from the excitation into the mid gap electronic state introduced by Mn doping.8 This mid gap band can be assigned as a donor type photoionization of Mn2+ which generates delocalized charge carriers upon photoexcitation. Therefore excitation with photon energies of 2.3 eV and above can generate mobile charge carriers thereby increasing the charge carrier density, resulting in the photocurrent in the nanowires. The other mechanism is oxygen adsorption–desorption where, when the nanowire is excited with photons, the oxygen adsorbed on the nanowire surface is desorbed, releasing the surface bound electrons in the depletion layer and hence increasing the conductance of the nanowire. However, the effect of oxygen readsorption on the conductance of the device in this experiment can be considered to be minimal, as the experiments were performed at high vacuum where longer carrier lifetimes have been reported.24 Various photoconductive parameters such as responsivity, external quantum efficiency, photoconductive gain, photocurrent rise time, photocurrent decay time and stability of the photocurrent have to be analyzed to evaluate the nanowire's suitability for photodetector applications. The photodetector's responsivity (Rλ) which is defined as the photocurrent per unit power on the effective area of the photoconductor and expressed by the formula Rλ = I/(PA) where I is the photocurrent, P is the light intensity and A is the photoconductor area.25 The Rλ obtained for the current device at a light intensity of 160 mW cm−2 at 8 V bias was 0.11 AW−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the photodetector is defined as the number of electrons detected per photon and is expressed by the formula EQE = hcRλ/eλ where h is the Plank's constant, c is velocity of light and e is elementary electronic charge.26,27 The EQE obtained for the current device at a light intensity of 160 mW cm−2 at 8 V bias was ∼26%. Remarkably, this Rλ of Mn doped ZnO under sub band gap excitation is comparable to ZnS nanobelts (∼0.12 AW−1) and ZnSe nanobelts (∼0.12 AW−1) with above band gap excitation and the EQE was fairly comparable to ZnSe nanobelts (37.2%).28,29 It is notable that Mn doped ZnO nanowire exhibited EQE values of 26% with below band gap excitation (2.33 eV) whereas the EQE achieved in ZnSe nanobelts were above band gap excitation.
Another important parameter for photodetectors is the photoconductive gain. The photoconductive gain is defined as the number of charges collected from the excitation of a photon and can be expressed by the expression G = (I/Poptical)(hν/e) where I is the photocurrent, Poptical is the power absorbed by the nanowire, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of the incident photon and e is the electronic charge.30 At the interface between materials of different refractive index, Fresnel reflection of incident light will occur and therefore the transmission rate of the incident light is given by 4n1n2/(n1 + n2) where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two medium. Taking into account the Fresnel reflection from the nanowire (refractive index of Mn doped ZnO is 1.95), and the Poptical was calculated indicating that the power absorbed by the nanowire is lesser than the incident power accordingly.30,31 The photoconductive gain obtained for Mn doped ZnO nanowire was 0.55 at 160 mW cm−2 and the gain decreases with increasing light intensity (Fig. 4 (d)). The photoconductive gain was fitted with an inverse power law yielding a fractional power dependence of photoconductive gain for Mn doped ZnO nanowires (G ∼ P−0.57).32 Similarly, the photoconductive gain versus intensity (Fig. S5 (c) and (d)†) dependence at 2 V (G ∼ P−0.57) and 5 V (G ∼ P−0.53) bias also exhibited a power law dependence similar to that at an 8 V bias. With increasing light intensities the number of photogenerated carriers are increased and therefore the space charge region width and the surface band bending in the nanowire are decreased resulting in lower photoconductive gain.33

Fig. 5 (a) shows the photocurrent transient response of the nanowire device with a green light (532 nm) intensity of 400 mW cm−2. Different bias voltages (2 V, 5 V and 8 V) were applied to investigate the influence of bias voltage on photocurrent. Illumination was switched on and off periodically at regular 10 s intervals by means of shutter to study the photoresponse of the nanowire to green light (532 nm). At 8 V bias the dark current was ∼7 pA and when the device was illuminated with green light (400 mW cm−2), the current increased to 0.34 nA (∼50 times increase from dark current). At a lower bias of 5 V, the dark current was ∼5 pA and the photocurrent was ∼0.16 nA (∼32 times increase). The photocurrent was stable with minimum fluctuation (less than 5%). The same device was illuminated at varying light intensities and showed increasing photocurrent with incident power (Fig. 5 (b)). The photocurrent response time and decay time are key factors in determining a photodetector's sensitivity to a fast varying optical signal. The photocurrent rise time and decay time was estimated from the photocurrent versus time plots (Fig. 5 (c) and 5 (d)). The rise time was defined as the time needed to reach 90% of the photocurrent from dark current value after light illumination and the decay time was defined as the time needed to reach 10% of the photocurrent after switching off the light illumination. The rise time was 200 ms and decay time was 250 ms at 400 mW cm−2 illumination. The rise time and the decay time in our nanowire device were found not to depend on the applied bias within the measurement resolution of the Keithley 2636 source meter employed in the experiment. This rapid photoresponse time can be explained by the enhanced carrier recombination rates due to the large surface area of the nanowires.34 Due to the large nanowire surface area, there are many dangling bonds on the surface that might act as recombination centers for the charge carriers resulting in fast photocurrent decay time. Such fast and stable photoresponse would suggest that the Mn doped ZnO nanowire device would be ideally suited for applications in photodetectors and optoelectronic switches. The response times of Mn doped ZnO nanowires (200–250 ms) with sub band gap excitation were better in comparison to other nanowire systems such as ZnTe (1.3 s), In2O3 (10 s), ZnSnO3 (20 s).35–37 The 3-dB bandwidth of Mn doped ZnO nanowire can be obtained from the relationship f3-dB = 0.35/trise.38 The f3-dB of Mn doped ZnO nanowires was 1.75 Hz and was higher when compared to a previous report on ZnO nanowires (5 × 10−3 Hz).6 The Mn doped ZnO nanowire device was also illuminated with a 405 nm laser to investigate its photo-response to different wavelengths. The photocurrent versus time plots was shown in Fig. 5 (e) at a bias of 8 V under a light intensity of 7 mW cm−2. The Rλ (4 AW−1) and EQE (∼1200%) and the photoconductive gain (∼24) of the nanowire under 405 nm illumination was higher in comparison to 532 nm light illumination. The difference is probably attributable to the number of photoexcited mobile charge carriers that contribute to the photocurrent. The number of mobile carriers created by excitation into the midgap states is lesser than that generated by band to band excitation. This is in line with the work of Gamelin and coworkers who observed the formation of strongly bound charge carriers resulting in absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency of the Mn induced state to be only 10% as large as band to band transitions in Mn doped ZnO films.8 This results in higher photoconductive parameters (40 times increase in Rλ) at 405 nm with a much lower power (7 mW cm−2). The photocurrent rise time was ∼100 ms and the photocurrent decay time was 150 ms. The fast photocurrent response, high Rλ and EQE values of Mn doped ZnO with various excitation (532 nm and 405 nm) can be attributed to high crystalline quality, large surface to volume ratio and low recombination barrier.39

Conclusion
Mn-doped ZnO nanowires have been prepared using a CVD technique and their physical and optoelectronic characteristics were examined. HRTEM studies reveal that Mn doping is very uniform along the nanowire, while XRD analysis shows a slight shift in the spectrum due to lattice expansion by incorporating Mn atoms in the ZnO unit cell. The Mn doping of ZnO nanowires was further confirmed with XPS and Raman spectroscopy. A systematic understanding of the photoconductivity of Mn doped ZnO nanowires under different visible light excitations was developed. We achieved photoresponse from the Mn doped ZnO nanowire device in visible wavelengths (<532 nm) by exploiting the mid gap electronic states introduced by Mn doping. The nanowire device exhibited good Rλ and EQE values with sub band gap excitation (532 nm) which was comparable to other photodetector materials with above band gap excitation. The Mn doped ZnO nanowire exhibited an even higher Rλ and EQE (4 AW−1 and 1200%) with excitation from a 405 nm light illumination. The Mn doped ZnO nanowire also exhibited fast photocurrent rise and decay times (∼100–250 ms) for different wavelengths (532 nm and 405 nm). These results suggest that Mn doped ZnO nanowires could pave the way for efficient, multispectral photodetectors and optical switches.
