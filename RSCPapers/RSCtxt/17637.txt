    , Accepted 23rd February 2015First published on 23rd February 2015AbstractNanostructured transition-metal oxides exhibit excellent properties, such as ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, photoluminescence and semiconductive behaviors, etc. The band gap and electronic structure of these oxides can be controlled by size and dimensions; they can also be used in a wide range of applications including microelectronics, energy storage, sensors, and biomedicine due to their tunable chemical and physical properties. Here, we give a comprehensive review of the controllable growth of some typical transition-metal oxide nanostructures (e.g., WOx, FeOx, ZnO, TiO2, VO2, etc.), which can be used to effectively understand the fabrication methods as well as the growth mechanism and inspire their potential applications.

1 Introduction
Over the past few decades, transition-metal oxide nanostructures (MONSs), which have great potential in magnetic, electronic, and optical applications, have been widely studied. MONSs have been integrated into a variety of devices to achieve unprecedented excellent performance, such as enhanced gas sensing and efficient photocatalysis.1,2 In transition-metal oxides, although the s-shells of positive metallic ions are always fully filled by electrons, the d-shells of them may be not completely filled. This characteristic brings them various unique properties, which involve reactive electronic transitions,3,4 high dielectric constants,5,6 wide bandgaps,7,8 good electrical characteristics9,10 and so on. Meanwhile, transition-metal oxides possess various states, such as ferromagnetic state, ferrimagnetic state and semiconductive state. Therefore, transition-metal oxides are considered to be one of the most fascinating functional materials.
Currently, the studies of nanostructures have greatly promoted the development of electron devices. Nanostructures are defined as the materials with at least one dimension between 1 and 100 nm. In general, nanostructures possess three different morphologies: zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. It has been well-known that with the size and dimension reduced, the electronic structures of the nanostructures can be tuned, which lead to a variety of changes in both chemical and physical properties.11,12 For example, magnetic properties of MONSs can transform from ferro/ferrimagnetic to superparamagnetic with their size reduced. Thus the nanoscale design and process of synthesis can be used to tune the properties of nanostructures.
Up to now, the control of the size, shape and structure of MONSs has been achieved by various synthetic methods. Vapor phase growth is always carried out in a thermal furnace. In this process, it is necessary to regulate the reaction between oxygen gas and metal vapor source. In order to achieve it, various methods have been developed to control the aspect ratio, diameter and specific surface area of the product. They mainly involve thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD), metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), etc.13,14 Meanwhile, the mechanism could be classified as vapor–solid (VS) and vapor–liquid–solid (VLS). Back in 1964, Wagner and Ellis first presented the VLS mechanism to describe the growth of Si whiskers.15,16 Generally, metal nanoparticles are used as the nucleation seeds, which have essential influences on the growth direction and diameter of products in the VLS process. In the beginning, catalysts are molten into liquid alloy droplets which also contain the source metal. When the alloy droplets achieve supersaturation, the source metal starts to precipitate and form metal oxide under oxygen flow. In general, the as-synthesized metal oxides preferentially grow along a particular orientation, which leads to the formation of 1D nanostructures. So far, the preparation of metal oxide nanowires, such as ZnO,17 CdO,18 In2O3,19 SnO2 (ref. 20) and TiO2,21 has been achieved by means of the VLS mechanism. From what have been discussed above, the VLS process belongs to catalyst-assisted growth, while the VS process belongs to catalyst-free growth.22,23 In the course of the VS process, the reactants are first heated to form vapors under high temperature and directly condensed on the substrate, on which seed crystals will take shape and serve as the nucleation sites. The subsequent facilitated directional growth will minimize the surface energy of the product.
Electrochemical deposition has been successfully applied to fabricate metal oxide nanostructures. It exhibits many advantages during synthesis. Take the preparation of ZnO24 for example, making use of appropriate electrolyte, ZnO has been successfully prepared. Meanwhile, researchers also try to introduce the template into the electrochemical deposition method. A gel comprising sol particles is essential for the sol–gel process. Firstly, precursor molecules, which compose the sol particles, are used to synthesize a colloidal suspension. Then a template will be introduced into the suspension, and the particles will aggregate on the surface of the template. After sol particles fill the channels of the template, a structure with predesigned morphology will be formed. Using thermal treatment to remove the residual gel, the final product will be achieved.
Back in the 1970s, the hydrothermal process was firstly employed to synthesize crystalline structures. The reactants are placed in a closed vessel with water as a reaction medium. The reaction is conducted under high temperature and pressure conditions. The hydrothermal process can accelerate the reactions between ions and promote the hydrolysis reaction. Ultimately, the growth and self-assembly of crystals will be achieved in solution. The advantages of the method involve low cost, mild reaction conditions and controlling the device easily. By changing the experimental parameters (temperature, pressure, time, reaction medium, etc.), the morphology, structure and properties of the product can be well regulated. In order to improve the hydrothermal process, surfactants are introduced into the system. Surfactant-promoted processes have been demonstrated to be an effective method to fabricate metal oxide with a variety of morphologies. The system is always composed of three phases: oil phase, surfactant phase and aqueous phase. In the course of the process, surfactants can confine the growth of the product. Meanwhile, the temperature, pH value and concentration of the reactants also have an essential influence on the morphology, structure and properties of the product.
In this review, recent developments of MONSs, including fabrication of representative MONSs with designed shape and dimensionality and their important technological applications in various fields, have been presented. Due to rich morphologies and structures, various synthetic methods, wide applications and excellent properties, a comprehensive review of the syntheses and applications of a variety of MONSs (e.g. nickel oxides, tungsten oxides, zinc oxides, vanadium oxides, iron oxides, etc.) was presented. The applications involve gas sensors, electrochromic devices, LEDs, field emitters and so on. Finally, the outlook of the MONSs is given.
2 WOx
It is well known that nanostructures with specific exposed facets and hierarchical structures usually exhibit unique physical and chemical properties.25–27 Among various transition metal oxides, tungsten oxides (WOx, 2 ≤ x ≤ 3) attracted great interest and have been extensively investigated due to their outstanding performance in applications such as photocatalysis,27–29 gas sensors,30–34 anode materials of Li-ion batteries,35 supercapacitors,36,37 field emitters,38 electrochromic (EC) devices39–42and so on.
Besides stoichiometric WO3 (ref. 27, 32 and 33) and WO2,38,43 non-stoichiometric WO3-δ (0 < δ < 1) was synthesized, for example WO2.9,44 W5O14 (WO2.8),45,46 W18O49 (WO2.72),47–49 W2O5,50 and W3O8.51 It should be noted that many types of stoichiometric WO3 crystals have been found, which makes it more difficult to be understood. Generally, WO3 crystals are formed by corner and edge sharing of WO6 octahedra. Based on the tilting angles and rotation direction of WO6 octahedra with reference to the “ideal” cubic structure (ReO3 type), the corner sharing phases can be classified as follows: monoclinic II (ε-WO3), triclinic (δ-WO3), monoclinic I(γ-WO3), orthorhombic (β-WO3), tetragonal (α-WO3), and cubic WO3.52,53 In addition, the hexagonal phase (h-WO3) with the form of three and six-membered rings of WO6 octahedra in the ab-plane was observed.54–58
For the purpose of obtaining nanostructures with specific exposed facets and hierarchical structures, tungsten oxides can be synthesized using varying techniques to form 0D,30,55,59–61 1D,33,43,62–65 2D34,66–69 and 0 (ref. 70)/1 (ref. 71)/2D-based32,72,73 hierarchical structures. In this section, we present a general review on shape-controlled syntheses of WOx nanostructures. Because other WOx nanostructures have attracted more interest due to their structural stability and excellent properties, various nanostructured forms of WO3 and W18O49 have been presented emphatically in the literature to date. We also summarize methods for syntheses of nanostructured WOx based on two major categories: vapor phase and liquid phase.
2.1 0D WOx nanostructures
In this paper, 0D nanostructures only refer to quantum dots (QDs) and nanoparticles with specific exposed facets.
0D QDs now attract much attention because their energy levels can be designed by controlling their particle size due to the strong quantum-size (Q-size) effects.74,75 Among various liquid phase methods for syntheses of WOx QDs, template directed synthesis is usually used. For example, Watanabe et al.76 successfully prepared WO3 QDs (~1.0 nm, Fig. 1a) with the help of a new template called super-microporous silicas (SMPSs). In contrast, liquid phase template-free synthesis of WOx QDs is rather difficult, and structure-tailoring agents usually lead to 1D47,77/2D78 morphologies due to the unequal growth rate in the plane and normal to the plane direction.79,134 In this case, the vapor/liquid phase method based on the decomposition of precursor and appropriate structure-tailoring agents will be a good choice. Cong et al.75 synthesized tungsten aryloxide (W(OC6H5)6) precursor firstly, then reacted it with octylamine at 180 °C under N2 flow to obtain γ-WO3 QDs (~1.6 nm, Fig. 1b, γ phase was re-indexed by us mainly according to Raman peaks at ~270, 310, 700 and 805 cm−1,80,81 together with its size, colour82 and XRD pattern82). By exchanging surface ligands, γ-WO3 QDs stabilized with pyridine bring about excellent hydrophilicity and conductivity, which exhibited excellent electrochromic performance with coloration/bleaching time within 1 s (>50 s for bulk sample, Fig. 1c and d) and coloration efficiency up to 154 cm2 C−1, which is much superior to inorganic analogues and even competitive to organic related materials.75

Vapor phase methods for syntheses of uniform and undoped WOx QDs were rarely reported, which might be due to a wide range of temperature (wide particle size distribution) and difficulty in collecting QDs. However, the vapor phase method is suitable for 0D nanostructures with specific exposed facets. For instance, Guo et al.61 prepared α-WO3 octahedra bounded by eight {101} exposed facets via a DC thermal plasma system (Fig. 2a and b). Similarly, Zhang et al.30 reported the synthesis of uniform γ-WO3 octahedra enclosed by eight {111} exposed facets via a RF thermal plasma system (Fig. 2c). Both α-WO3 (stable at temperature > 740 °C) and γ-WO3 (stable at 17–330 °C)83,84 octahedra are in equilibrium forms determined by the corner sharing of WO6 octahedra at different temperature regions. The main reason why WO3 octahedra bound by {111} facets performed good gas sensing properties (Fig. 2d) can be attributed to dangling bonds of W– or O– on the surface (highly active crystal surface).

0D nanostructures with specific exposed facets can also be prepared by the liquid phase method, of which hydro/solvothermal reaction assisted by directed/capping agents was usually used. Directed/capping agents can control growth rates along a specific direction by changing the free energies of different crystal facets. For example, via a simple solvothermal route with the assistance of urea, γ-WO3 octahedra with eight {111} facets can be obtained (Fig. 2e).60 In contrast, growth rates along [001], [010] and [100] can be controlled to the slowest directions (Fig. 2f).59 The crystal phase can be tuned by changing the reaction temperature. By increasing the temperature to 180 °C, more stable phase β-WO3 cuboids were obtained.
2.2 1D WOx nanostructures
The width and thickness of 1D nanostructures are confined to the nanoscale range between 1 and 100 nm, while the length can be hundreds of nanometers or more. The length scale allows the 1D nanostructures to contact the macroscopic world. It should be noted that although lengths (width) of some nanostructures described in this section are less (larger) than 100 nm, which should be 0D (2D) nanostructures according to the general definition of 0D (2D) nanomaterials, we classified them as 1D nanostructures for their significant aspect ratios.
Enormous efforts have so far been made to synthesize and characterize 1D metal-oxide nanostructures in the forms of rods,35,40,41,55,57,85 wires/fibers,33,62,63,86,87 needles/tips,33,64 tubes,65,88 hemitubes89 and belts.58,63,71
For the vapor phase method, the growth mechanism can be simply summarized as VS22 and VLS.15 And morphologies of products can be controlled by changing the parameters such as deposition temperature,33,62 assisting electric field,64 catalyst,38 substrate,62 pre-treament,40etc.
With a rich oxygen atmosphere, we can find that vapor phase methods usually obtained WO3 1D nanostructures with high aspect ratios (e.g. nanowires/fibers, nanoneedles, etc., Fig. 3a), which exhibited excellent performace in various applications such as a field emission displays (FED, Fig. 3b), gas sensors, photodectors and so on.33,62–64,90–94 In most cases, it is easy to understand the formation of monoclinic γ-WO3 phase (stable at 17–330 °C)83,84 by considering that each growth temperature was lower than 1000 °C, the phase transitions of WO3 is partially reversible52 and that γ-WO3 has been reported as the most stable phase at room temperature.83 1D nanostructures always grew on heterogenious substrates.33,38,62–64,92 Affected by the surface of the substrate, most of them showed a [001] growth direction along the length (Fig. 3c), while nanowires on Si wafer63 or Si + W supported Au film38 exibited a [100]/[010] or [010] growth direction (Fig. 3d and e). By replacing the substrate with Si + W supported Ni film, WO2 nanowires were synthesized due to the lack of oxygen gas caused by oxidation of Ni (Fig. 3f).38

With a poor oxygen atmosphere, WO3-δ (0 < δ < 1) 1D nanostructures (especially W18O29) can be fabricated via the vapor phase method (reacted with leaking/poor oxygen or gas like CO2).48,95–98 Because the close-packed planes are {010}, W18O29 1D nanostructures (nanowire,48,96 nanotip,97 nanoneedles,98etc., depending on substrates) usually showed the monoclinic phase with selective growth along the [010] direction (Fig. 4).

As for liquid phase methods, more abundant morphologies and crystal phase of WOx 1D nanostructures were observed than vapor phase methods. In spite of different reactants (WO3·nH2O,57,58 Na2WO4,35,41,49,54,55,85,88 Li2WO4,56etc.) and directed/capping/accelerating agents (Li2SO4,56,57 NaCl & HCl,85 Na2SO4 & H2C2O4,94etc.) used, final products of hydrothermal reaction at 140–180 °C (pH: 1.0–2.0) were usually h-WO3 1D nanostructures with the [001] direction along the length (Fig. 5a and b). Among these studies, stabilizing cations (e.g. Na+, NH4+, Li+, etc.) and directing anions (e.g. SO42−, Cl−, C2O42−, etc.) were reported as the key factor to determine the crystal phase and morphologies of final products, respectively (Fig. 5c–e).99 As a typical example for structure directing studies, the hydrothermal system of Na2WO4, H2C2O4 and Rb2SO4 (0.3 g) at 180 °C reported by Gu et al.71 is worth studying. During the growth stage, SO42− may act as a capping agent to preferentially adsorb on the faces parallel to the c axis of the h-WO3 nanocrystal, leading to the formation of c-axis oriented nanorods and finally urchin-like spheres (Fig. 5g). The high concentration of sulfate (1.0 g Rb2SO4) tends to induce the oriented aggregation of the nanorods, thus nanoplates were observed (Fig. 5h). Similarly, h-WO3 nanowires (Fig. 5i) and nanobelts growing along the [001] direction (Fig. 5j and k) can be observed when 0.3 g and 1.0 g of K2SO4 were used instead of Rb2SO4, respectively. In addition, the pH value was reported as an essential factor to affect the crystal phase (Fig. 5f).35

Without using any ions mentioned above, W18O49 nanowires were obtained by solvothermal reaction of WCl4 and ethanol.47,100 By changing systematically the kind and concentration of alcohols and W-source raw materials, W18O49 nanostructures with interesting morphologies were obtained, including nanorods, nanofibers, nanospheres, nanoparticles, and even nanoassembles.49
Other types of liquid phase methods (e.g. template directed synthesis, precursor based method, electron beam irradiation, etc.) were utilized to synthesize WOx 1D nanostructures. Taking carbon nanotubes (CNTs), SBA-15, polymeric fiber, porous anodic alumina (PAA) as templates, 1D nanostructures such as nanowires86,87,101 and hemitubes (γ-WO3,89Fig. 6a and b) can be obtained. Zhao et al.65 synthesized tungstic acid hydrate (H2W1.5O5.5·H2O) nanotube precursor via solvothermal reaction firstly, then calcined it at 450 °C to obtain porous δ-WO3 nanotubes (Fig. 6c–f). Besides, β-WO3 nanorods with [100] direction along the length were synthesized by electron beam irradiation in aqueous solution containing WO3 particles and triethylamine.102

2.3 2D WOx nanostructures
2D WOx nanostructures were usually obtained via liquid phase methods.
By changing the stabilizing caions and structure directing agents (p-aminobenzoic acid,103 tartaric acid,59 HBF4,68etc.), nanoplates can be synthesized via hydrothermal reactions (Fig. 7a).

Assisted by agents66–68 or not,69 2D H2WO4 precursors (Fig. 7b) were fabricated, which can be transformed into δ-WO3 (ref. 68) or γ-WO3 (ref. 34, 66, 67 and 69) nanoplates or nanoleaves (Fig. 7c). Oaki et al.104 synthesized BaWO4-PAA (poly(acrylic acid)) hybrids as the precursor of WO3 by a co-precipitation method in aqueous solution. Kalantar-zadeh et al.82 developed a three-step method (Fig. 7d–f) based on WO3·2H2O precursor to obtain atomically thin γ-WO3 quantum sheets. The minimum resolvable thickness of the hydrated flakes was ∼1.4 nm (Fig. 7g).
2.4 0/1/2D-based WOx hierarchical nanostructures
Numerous hierarchical structures based on 0/1/2D units possessing enhanced physical and chemical properties compared to the pristine structures have been introduced into nano-structure based devices for a given application.
For vapor phase methods, substrates are often required for the growth of WOx hierarchical structures such as forests (Fig. 8a),105 hierarchical arrays,92,95,106,107 3D networks (Fig. 8b and c),106 and so on.

The liquid phase method is an effective way to fabricate 0/1/2D based hierarchical structures. For 0D based hierarchical structures, mesoporous hollow spheres70 and mesoporous thin films (Fig. 8d and e)109,110 can be fabricated via removal of the template. In addition, Ou et al.111 reported that they prepared a 3D WO3 nanoporous network at room temperature by the electrochemical anodization of a RF sputtered tungsten film deposited on a FTO glass (Fig. 8f–j).
Various 1D based hierarchical structures (urchin-like spheres,71,113 nanoforests (Fig. 8k),95,114etc.) can be obtained by solvo/hydrothermal reaction36,71,113,114 and precursor based methods.115 Similarly, 2D based hierarchical structures (e.g. flower (Fig. 8l),112 array (Fig. 8m),27,116 brush-like (Fig. 8n),113etc.) can be synthesized by solvo/hydrothermal reaction113,117 and precursor based methods.27,73,112,116

Iron oxides represent the most common iron compounds found in nature. Up to present, apart from amorphous iron(III) oxide, six crystalline nonhydrated iron oxides have been recognized:118,119i.e. Fe3O4 (magnetite); four polymorphs of Fe2O3, labeled as α-Fe2O3 (hematite, rhombohedrally centered hexagonal structure of corundum type, space group Rc), β-Fe2O3 (body-centered cubic “bixbyite” structure, space group Ia), γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite, cubic crystal structure of an inverse spinel type, at least three different crystal symmetries), and ε-Fe2O3 (orthorhombic structure, space group Pna21); and FeO phase (wüstite). Highly crystalline α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 occur in nature, while β-Fe2O3 and ε-Fe2O3 are generally synthesized in the laboratory.120 Research also indicated that the following sequence of polymorphous transformations may occur with increasing temperature and particle size: γ-Fe2O3 → ε-Fe2O3 → β-Fe2O3 → α-Fe2O3.121,122
Iron oxide nanostructures have attracted great attention from many research fields due to their low-cost, corrosion-resistant and environmentally friendly features. Iron oxides can be synthesized using varying techniques to form 0D,123–125 1D,126–129 2D130–133 and 0 (ref. 134 and 135)/1 (ref. 136–139)/2D140,141-based hierarchical structures. They have been found highly applicable and versatile in lithium ion batteries,129,142–146 supercapacitors, catalysis (including photocatalysis),124,136,140,147,148 gas sensors,124,132,137,149 field emitters,141 removal of heavy metal ions,150 antimicrobial applications,126 diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),123,151,152 thermal therapy,153 drug delivery,154etc. In this section, a general review on shape-controlled syntheses of iron oxide nanostructures (especially for Fe3O4, α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3) is presented based on two major categories of synthetic methods: vapor phase and liquid phase.
3.1 0D iron oxide nanostructures
Iron oxide QDs are usually prepared by liquid phase methods. Park et al.155 successfully prepared monodisperse Fe3O4 (5–12 nm, Fig. 9a) based on the thermal decomposition of iron oleate precursors in high boiling solvent. Similarly, Kim et al.123 synthesized γ-Fe2O3 QDs (ESION) of <4 nm by controlled thermal decomposition of iron oleate complex in the presence of oleyl alcohol via the heat-up process (Fig. 9b). The size of the QDs could be reduced by increasing the ratio of oleyl alcohol to oleic acid or decreasing the reaction temperature. Their low toxicity, high r1 relaxivity, long blood half-life, and low synthetic cost enable ESIONs to be competent T1 MRI contrast agents for various clinical applications (Fig. 9b). The solvothermal reaction is an effective approach to prepare iron oxide QDs, too. Tian et al.156 synthesized ultra-small monodisperse Fe3O4 QDs (4–6 nm) via solvothermal reaction. In addition, a template directed method was used for the synthesis of semiconductor–magnetic hybrid nanocrystals (HNCs) with selectable heterodimer topologies and tunable geometric parameters (Fig. 9c–e).

Vapor phase methods for preparing nanomaterials always involve thermal decomposition (pyrolysis), reduction, hydrolysis, disproportionation, oxidation, or other reactions to precipitate solid products from the vapor phase.158,159 Normally, vapor phase methods are used for preparations of iron oxide continuous thin films160,161 or 1D162,163/2D146 nano-arrays.
For syntheses of 0D Fe3O4 nanostructures with specific exposed facets, liquid phase methods will be good choices. Through a solvothermal approach, Wang et al.125 synthesized magnetite with different morphologies and sizes by using ferrocene as a single precursor and isopropanol (IPA) or an isopropanol–water mixture as solvent (Fig. 10a). Without any additive agents, it is most likely that the growth rate of (100) is much faster than that of (111) of the formed primary Fe3O4 seeds, which leads to the formation of star-shaped hexapods. By varying the ratio of IPA to water and the reaction temperature, octahedra or star-shaped hexapods of opposite vertexes with a difference of six arms changing from spindle to round can be prepared. Due to the adsorption and etching effect of SDBS, concave octahedra formed at an appropriate concentration of SDBS, and octahedral frameworks become dominant at a high input of SDBS (SDBS/Fe at 2:1). Similar to the report of Wang et al.,135 uniform Fe3O4 octahedra could be synthesized with the help of the nonionic surfactant Triton X100 (Fig. 10b and c).164

For a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal, the surface energies corresponding to different crystallographic facets are in the order of {111} < {100} ≪ {110},168 which could explain why most of Fe3O4 crystals synthesized without capping/directing agents have an octahedral shape bounded by {111} facets. With addition of capping/directing agents, Fe3O4 crystals with different morphologies formed starting from the Fe3O4 truncated cuboctahedral seeds. One way is to minimize the growth speed along the [100] direction to form truncated cuboctahedra (seeds), truncated octahedra (Fig. 10d–f),165 truncated cubes () and cubes ();166 the other is to minimize the growth speed along the [110] direction to form rhombic dodecahedra (RD, Fig. 10h and i).167
The capping/directing agent assisted liquid phase method is also applicable to controlled syntheses of α-Fe2O3 crystals with specific exposed facets. It is reported that without the addition of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and N2H4 molecules, the crystal growth along six crystallographically equivalent directions of the hematite crystalline structure resulted in the dendritic shape (Fig. 11a and b); while in contrast, α-Fe2O3 spheres (Fig. 11a and c) and truncated hexagonal bipyramids (Fig. 11a and d) were obtained.169 In the same way, α-Fe2O3 rhombohedra with nearly 100% exposed {104} facets could be obtained via a solvothermal reaction by simply tailoring the ratio of water to 1-propanol, of which the solvent plays the role of the capping/directing agent (Fig. 11e and f).170

Furthermore, the exposed facets of α-Fe2O3 crystals could be tailored by supersaturation without using any capping/directing agents (Fig. 11g–l).124 The higher ratio of water to ethanol (higher supersaturation) led to a smaller ratio of {001} to the total surface, which results in the morphology evolution as follows: thin nanoplates → thick nanoplates → truncated pseudocubes → pseudocubes (Fig. 11g–k). Further increasing the supersaturation by adding more Fe(acac)3 will be conducive to the formation of exposed facets with higher surface energy, which results in the formation of hexagonal bipyramidal nanocrystals exposed with {113} facets (2 mmol) and nearly spherical nanocrystals bounded by multiple groups of uncertain high-index facets (>3 mmol). The catalytic activity of facets in CO oxidation was demonstrated to follow the order of {012} > {113} > {001} (Fig. 11m), while the sensing ability followed the order of {113} > {012} > {001} (Fig. 11n and o). The distinct catalytic and sensing performance was ascribed to high chemisorption amounts of CO on {012} facets and high percentage of OV and OC of bipyramid Fe2O3-{113}.
3.2 1D iron oxide nanostructures
Morphologies of 1D nanostructures can be controlled to form rods,126,163 wires/fibers,171 columns,126 belts, tubes, etc. Using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method (Fig. 12a) with Au catalyst, aligned α-Fe2O3 (along [110] direction) and Fe3O4 (along [111] direction) 1D nanostructures can be obtained on alumina substrates (Fig. 12b).172 Using CuO as the catalyst, cubic Fe3O4 nanowires grown along the [110] direction can be synthesized (Fig. 12c–f).171 Without the catalyst and with a rich oxygen atmosphere, α-Fe2O3 nanowires (800 °C) and nanobelts (700 °C) growing along the [110] direction can be obtained by direct oxidation of Fe substrate (Fig. 12g–i).173 In a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system, the temperature for the formation of α-Fe2O3 nanowires (570 °C) was lower than nanobelts (680 °C) due to highly reactive oxygen plasma.162 By applying a potential difference of 2.7–7.8 V to 5.8–15.0 cm long Fe wires in air, α-Fe2O3 nanowires (700 °C) growing along the [110] direction were observed.174

With a porous anodic alumina membrane (AAM) as the substrate and template, Bachmann et al.175 prepared Fe2O3 nanotubes with tunable size and variable layers by atomic layer deposition (Fig. 12j–l). Similar results can be obtained by simply decomposing Fe nitrate that precoated into AAM in air at 400 °C.177 Using the same template, Fe3O4 tubes can be obtained by first thermally decomposing Fe nitrate solution at 250 °C in nanochannels of AAM, and then reducing it in hydrogen for 2.5 h at 560 °C (Fig. 12m and n).176
Iron oxide 1D nanostructures fabricated by liquid phase methods (e.g. sonochemistry driven synthesis,178 laser-induced (Fig. 13a and b)/assisted (Fig. 13c and d) reaction,179,180 sonoelectrochemical anodization (Fig. 13e),181 hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 13f–l),182 co-precipitation,183etc.) have various morphologies such as rods,182 wires/fibers, necklaces,184 belts,180 tubes,185 multi-tubes,151 urchin-like nanostructures,186,187etc.

In addition, precursor based/template directed methods with subsequent pyrolysis at high temperature are usually used for syntheses of α-Fe2O3188/Fe3O4189 nanorods, Fe2O3 hollow fibers,190 α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 nanotubes,191–193 γ-Fe2O3 tube in tube (Fig. 13f–h),127,194 and so on.
3.3 2D iron oxide nanostructures
2D FeOx nanostructures synthesized by liquid phase methods showed richer morphologies (e.g. hexagonal nanoplates,190 nanodisks,195 nanorings,191 graphene-like nanofilms,209 quantum sheets,189etc., Fig. 14) and phases (e.g. α-Fe2O3,131 Fe3O4,196 γ-Fe2O3, etc.) than those of vapor phase methods.146,197 In these studies, the basal surfaces of 2D nanostructures are usually (0001) for α-Fe2O3 and (111) for Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3; and thicknesses of 2D FeOx nanostructures are usually tailored by changing the amounts and types of directing/capping agents from solutes255 or solvents.190 Latest studies indicated that template directed methods might be effective ways to obtain ultra-shin 2D FeOx nanosheets (Fig. 14h–j).130,143 As shown in Fig. 14i, Cheng et al.130 synthesized atomically thin α-Fe2O3 quantum sheets via an CuO-template-assisted oriented growth strategy. After calcination, the obtained α-Fe2O3 quantum sheets with a half-unit-cell thickness robust intrinsic ferromagnetism of 0.6 μB per atom at 100 K remain ferromagnetic at room temperature.

3.4 0/1/2D-based iron oxide hierarchical nanostructures
For vapor phase methods, substrates are usually used for the growth of hierarchical structures. As shown in Fig. 15a–d, on the surface of Si substrate with a monolayer of polystyrene (PS) spheres, 0D- and 2D-based α-Fe2O3 hierarchical structures can be obtained by PLD-CVD at oxygen pressures of 60 Pa and 6 Pa, respectively.141 Since O atoms are rich and Fe atoms are deficient in the (110) plane, it can be considered to be the driving force for the preferential growth along the [110] direction. By pyrolysis of ferrocene in supercritical CO2 at 450 °C, Cao et al.198 successfully synthesized 1D-based 3D Fe3O4 networks on the inside wall of the autoclave (Fig. 15e and f). A decrease in the amout of CO2 resulted in the reduction of the length of nanorods, while an increase in the amount of Fe sources led to the formation of 2D nanosheets. In a PECVD system at room temperature, well defined α-Fe2O3 nanoplatelet arrays can be obtained on the FTO substrate (Fig. 15g–i), the thickness of which increased with increasing amount of Fe sources.140

For liquid phase methods, various FeOx hierarchical nanostructures can be synthesized by a simple solution method, solvo/hydrothermal reaction, a template-directed method and a precursor based method. 0D based FeOx hierarchical structures (meso-porous particles such as super-structures,199,200 spheres,144 hollow spheres201,202/bowls,203 cubes,135,204etc., Fig. 16a–c) are usually prepared by solvo-/hydrothermal reaction152,202 and precursor based methods.135,144,204 As a new type of precursor, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with controllable size, shape, composition, and shell/internal structure have received great attention for MOX hierarchical nanostructures. For example, Lou et al.204 synthesized Fe2O3 microboxes with various shell structures (Fig. 16e–j) based on controlled annealing of preformed Prussian blue (PB) microcubes (Fig. 16d). When evaluated as potential anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the as-prepared Fe2O3 microboxes with unique shell structures exhibited high lithium storage capacities and excellent cycling performance. Furthermore, since well defined hollow interiors can be created inside PB nanoparticles through controlled chemical etching in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone),205 nanoporous iron oxide nanostructures with hollow interiors and various phases can be synthesized by controlled calcination of these PB nanoparticles as starting precursors.135

As shown in Fig. 17a and b, an interesting type of 1D based hierarchical structures is the snowflake-like dendrites (up and bottom surfaces parallel to {0001} plane) synthesized by hydrothermal reactions,138,139 which can be transformed into Fe, γ-Fe2O3, and Fe3O4via H2 reduction for microwave absorption.206 In addition, CNT template directed synthesis of CNT@β-FeOOH and subsequent transformation into CNT@Fe2O3via calcination is a typical example for 1D based hierarchical structures prepared by precursor based methods.136

Solvo/hydrothermal reaction and precursor based methods are two typical methods for the syntheses of 2D based hierarchical structures. For instance, 2D hollow microplatelets with different porosities but similar platelet-like shapes can be synthesized by a solvothermal method with different amounts of NH4F (Fig. 17c–e).147 And Fe3O4 nanosheet-flowers can be synthesized by a simply aqueous solution method (Fig. 17f).207 For precursor based methods, meso-porous flower-like nanostructures are the most common morphologies observed on porous hierarchical structures based on precursors such as FeOOH,137,148 Fe-EG,208 and so on (Fig. 17g–k). In addition, wood templates can be used for the synthesis of hierarchical iron oxide with controllable porous structures (Fig. 17l and m). Basic units of such nanostructures can be found to be 2D films and 0D nanoparticles.
4. ZnO
4.1 0D nanostructures of ZnO
In all of the 0D structures of ZnO, ZnO hollow structures with well-defined structures have attracted more and more attention due to their great potential applications in areas such as catalysis, chemical and biological sensors, protection of biologically active agents, waste removal, and large bimolecular-release systems. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to fabricate ZnO with hollow structure in recent years. Many ZnO hollow structures have been successfully prepared.
The research mainly focused on template-assisted processes, which usually employed polystyrene spheres, carbon spheres, spherobacteria and so on as a template for the growth of ZnO hollow structures. In the course of fabrication, ZnO nanoshells or precursors were first deposited onto the surfaces of template spheres to form core–shell composite spheres. Soon after, the template particles were removed by dissolution in an appropriate solvent or by calcination at elevated temperature. Finally, ZnO hollow spheres could be obtained.
Zeng et al.210 developed a three-tiered organization of ZnO nano-building blocks into hollow spherical conformations using cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB) as a template (Fig. 18).210 CTAB surfactant can form colloidal vesicles in polar media, which act as a soft template for the self-assembly of ZnO multipod units, whereas ZnO nanorods are synthesized with the assistance of EDA chelating agent.

Wu et al.211 presented a novel process for the synthesis of ZnO hollow spheres. In this approach, when Zn(Ac)2·2H2O was put into the ethanol solution with sulfonated polystyrene core–shell spheres, zinc ions would adhere on the surfaces of template spheres via electrostatic interaction. As the NaOH solution was added into the solution, they would react with zinc ions to form ZnO crystal nuclei, which was followed by the formation of ZnO nanoshells. Therewith, neither additional dissolution nor calcination was employed to remove the PS core–shell spheres, template cores could be directly “dissolved” in the same solution, and form ZnO hollow spheres in the end (Fig. 19).211 The size of hollow spheres could be controlled by the size of the template spheres, and the wall thickness could be tailored by the concentration of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O.

Lv et al.212 also synthesized hollow spheres of ZnO using the PS core–shell spheres as the template spheres. In this process, inorganic precursors were adsorbed into the sulfonated PS templates with negative charge. The sulfonation process could facilitate the adhesion of Zn2+ on the surfaces of PS. Afterwards, the PS template would be removed by calcination, and the hollow spheres of ZnO formed.
Wang et al.213 employed trisodium citrate assisted rapid alkaline precipitation techniques to fabricate well-defined ZnO hollow spheres. The shell of ZnO hollow spheres with partial open gaps was composed of a mass of ZnO nanospheres, which were in pure hexagonal phase. Trisodium citrate was demonstrated to play an essential role in the formation of hollow spheres. And the annealed ZnO with hollow sphere architecture showed excellent gas response.
Wu et al.214 reported the preparation of ZnO hollow spheres templated by carbon microspheres. The prepared ZnO hollow spheres had a diameter of 200–400 nm and a shell thickness of about 25 nm. Song et al.215 prepared ZnO hollow spheres by the glucose-mediated, one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of Zn-coated carbon spheres, and then calcined it at 500 °C. Finally, the hollow ZnO microspheres with diameters of 1–2 mm were gradually transformed into solid microspheres.
The traditional template-assisted technology always employs an inorganic template, which is time-consuming, expensive and environmentally unfriendly. To overcome these problems, biological templates begin to be applied to fabricate ZnO hollow spheres.
For instance, Zhang et al.216 successfully prepared ZnO hollow spheres in a hydrothermal process by applying Streptococcus thermophilus as a green and economical biotemplate, which was based on the interaction between the reactants and the inherent functional groups on the cell walls, followed by calcination (Fig. 20).216 They considered that the formation of as-obtained ZnO hollow spheres involves a two-step encapsulation process, which has an influence on the pore structure of the products.

The techniques discussed above require an additional template, which needs to be removed later, to construct sphere structures. Recently, many efforts have been devoted to research template-free approaches, which could avoid these complex processes. Nevertheless, great challenges still remain to prevent the incorporation of impurities and to control the size.
Xie et al.217 extended the methods of coordination chemistry to fabricate hollow spheres of inorganic materials, which has been successfully put forward to synthesize ZnO submicrometer hollow spheres. In this approach, no additional template materials are needed to obtain submicrometer hollow sphere structures. It is worth noting that the 1D rigid chain of the coordination polymer and the amount of NH4OH are crucial to the formation of ZnO hollow spheres. A possible mechanism has also been proposed.
Gao et al.218 reported the conversion of Zn(NH3)42+ under hydrothermal conditions, which resulted in the formation of ZnO hollow spheres with an inner diameter of 100 nm and an outer diameter of 600 nm. The hollow spheres were composed of ZnO nanorods (Fig. 21).218 And it was demonstrated that the pH value of the initial mixture and the volume ratio of the ethanol to the solution have an important part in the formation of hollow spheres. Meanwhile, the results of characterization showed that the ZnO hollow spheres obtained presented excellent room-temperature photoluminescence properties with UV emission at 390 nm.

4.2 1-Dimension (1D) nanostructures of ZnO
In 2001, Kong et al.219 and Yang et al.220 synthesized single-crystalline ZnO nanowires using high-temperature VLS growth methods. In the process, ZnO nanowires have been prepared by the formation of Zn vapor at a high temperature. The growth process of the ZnO nanowires involved two stages: the nucleation of eutectic alloy droplets and the growth of nanowires through supersaturated liquid droplets. Wang et al.221 reported an effective process to fabricate large-area and patterned ZnO nanorods (Fig. 22).221 They combined the self-assembly-based mask technique with the surface epitaxial process to synthesize hexagonal arrays of ZnO nanorods. In the beginning of the experiment, submicron spheres and gold particles were deposited onto the substrate successively to form a gold catalyst array with hexagonal pattern. The catalyst could guide the VLS growth of ZnO on the substrate.

From what have been discussed above, it can be concluded that 1D ZnO nanostructures have been successfully fabricated via the VLS process. Furthermore, in the VLS process, Au, Sn, Co and NiO are always introduced into the preparation process of 1D ZnO nanostructures as catalysts, which initiate and guide the growth of 1D nanostructures. Subsequently, the techniques based on CVD without catalysis were achieved, which involved low-temperature CVD, MOCVD, MOVPE and template-assisted growth.
In general, CVD processes were always carried out at rather high temperature so as to form Zn vapor, which increased the cost of equipment and complexity of operation. In 2002, Wu et al.222,223 presented low-temperature CVD technology to synthesize high-quality and well-oriented ZnO nanorods on different substrates. In addition, they achieved diameter-controlled growth of the nanorods. In the process of preparation, zinc acetylacetonate hydrate was used to be the zinc source and the temperature was controlled to be at 130–140 °C
Since the pioneering work of the discovery of carbon nanotubes by Iijima, numerous studies have contributed to the synthesis and characterization of nanotubular structures. In 2003, Yu et al. reported the fabrication of ZnO nanotubes via vapor phase growth. ZnO and Zn powders were well mixed in a quartz boat, which was placed in an alumina tube. The synthesis of ZnO nanotubes began with the thermal evaporation of the ZnO–Zn powder mixture under wet oxidation conditions. The ZnO nanotubes obtained had a hollow core, and possessed an 8–20 nm thick crystalline wall.
In addition to nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes of ZnO, a variety of ZnO nanostructures consisting of ZnO nanobelts have been fabricated under controlled conditions based on CVD methods.
Wang et al.224 achieved ZnO ultralong nanobelts by simply evaporating the commercial ZnO powders at high temperatures with no catalyst. In the experiments, thermal evaporation of ZnO powders was carried out at 1400 °C for 2 hours, the products formed on the surface of the alumina substrate exhibited white wool-like structure. SEM and TEM observations indicated that the products involved abundant nanobelts with uniform width in the range of 50 to 300 nm, and the typical width-to-thickness ratio of the nanobelt was in the range of 5 to 10. HRTEM and electron diffraction show that these nanobelts were formed through two growth directions. The one, growing along [0001], was free from dislocations, while the other along [010] possessed a single stacking fault (Fig. 23).224

Structurally, the crystal structure of ZnO can be described as a mass of planes consisting of tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2+ and O2− ions stacked along the c axis alternatingly. The as-produced oppositely charged polar surfaces involve negatively charged O2− (000) and positively charged Zn2+ (0001) polar surfaces, which lead to the divergence of surface energy for polar surfaces. Compared with the polar surfaces, the commonly observed nonpolar planes of (010) and (20) have lower surface energy, which gives rise to anisotropic growth of ZnO. So for 1D ZnO nanostructures, the most common morphologies are the nanostructures, which restraint large area (0001) polar surfaces to minimize the surface energy. In general, during the course of growth of ZnO nanobelts, the highest growth rate is along the c axis and the large facets are usually {010} and {20}.
Wang et al.225–228 synthesized novel nanostructures based on ZnO nanobelts, which grow along the a-axis and whose surfaces are dominated by the polarized ±(0001) facets, by a VS process. In the products, the positive and negative ionic charges on the polarized ±(0001) surfaces would give rise to a spontaneous polarization across the nanobelt thickness. For the sake of minimizing the energy contributed by polar charges, surface area, and elastic deformation, nanohelixes (Fig. 24),228 nanorings and nanospirals would be formed via a spontaneous self-coiling process of single-crystal nanobelts.

The VLS process has been widely applied to fabricate ZnO nanorods or nanowires. In this process, metal nanoparticles are used as catalysts to grow ZnO nanorods. However, a very high growth temperature was essential to form Zn vapor, which dissolved into metal droplets. Meanwhile, metal nanoparticles are easy to be incorporated into the final product. It is well known that even low impurity concentrations have an impact on physical properties of the device based on ZnO. These are the drawbacks of the VLS growth technique.
In 2002, Park et al.229 introduced MOVPE, which required no metal catalysts, to grow ZnO nanorods. In the course of synthesis, diethylzinc and oxygen were used as the reactants, and argon was employed as carrier gas. The growth temperature was controlled in the range of 400–500 °C. The ZnO nanorods grown on Al2O3 substrates showed length distributions and uniform thickness, which benefited many device applications. The results demonstrated MOVPE to be the effective approach to fabricate ZnO nanorods at a low temperature without metal catalyst.
Subsequently, Liu et al.230 grew vertically well-aligned ZnO nanorods on different substrates by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) without any catalyst. The method was divided into two steps: nucleation and growth. In this process, diethylzinc and oxygen gas were employed as sources of zinc and oxygen, respectively. The ZnO nanorods obtained possessed highly uniform length and diameter. In addition, they proposed a possible growth mechanism for the growth of ZnO nanorods, which suggested that lattice matching, electric field enhancement and the amount of defects of nuclei might play an important role in the self-alignment of nanorods.
According to the CVD techniques mentioned in the literature, although they have advantages of high-quality products and simplicity, high temperatures are also essential, which is economically prohibitive.
Subsequently, researchers introduced the MOCVD approach, which made use of organometallic zinc precursors, into the synthesis of 1D ZnO nanostructures to reduce the deposition temperature. But this approach remains constrained by the expensive substrates needed for oriented growth, and the size and cost of the equipment.
In consideration of the requirement for the applications in solar cells, sensors, and other promising areas, the fabrication of 1D ZnO nanostructures should be a low-temperature, large-scale, and versatile synthetic process. During the past years, solution-phase growth has attracted much interest due to its low growth temperatures, low demand for equipment and good potential for the yield. This synthesis technique is large-scale production on any substrate regardless of them being crystalline or amorphous.
Vayssieres et al.231,232 grew highly oriented ZnO microtubes and nanorods on solid supports by a hydrothermal process at low temperature (Fig. 25).231 The results demonstrated the solution synthesis to be a potential process for 1D ZnO nanostructures. Zeng et al.233 developed the hydrothermal synthesis to prepare monodispersed ZnO nanorods with high crystallinity in the diameter regime of 50 nm.

In 2002, Liu et al.234 prepared helical ZnO rods and columns by a two-step process: controlled nucleation and growth (Fig. 26).234 The achievement presented a new approach to control orientations and shapes of nanostructures for practical applications. Soon afterwards, Yang et al.235 presented a similar process to grow well-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays on arbitrary substrates by a mild solution process. Before the hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanowires on a substrate, homogeneous ZnO nanocrystals were dispersed onto the substrate to form a seed layer. Chang et al. made use of the two-step process to grow well-aligned crystalline ZnO nanotubes on a variety of substrates.

In order to improve the hydrothermal process, many efforts have been devoted to this field. Xu et al.236 introduced microemulsions into the solution-phase growth of ZnO nanorods firstly, then employed dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid sodium salt as the modifying and protecting agent. In the course of reaction, Zn(OH)2 precursors were formed after the in situ reduction of Zn salt, which originated from microemulsions. The ZnO nanorods obtained were well-proportioned and exhibited perfect crystallinity. The experiment presented a novel solution-phase chemical route, which realized easily controlled and mild conditions. Oh et al.237 introduced a sonochemical route into the hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanorod arrays and to fabricate a resistive-type gas sensor. Vertically aligned ZnO nanorod arrays were successfully grown on alumina substrate under ultrasound-assisted conditions.
Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) is a chemically and thermally stable template, which possesses ordered porous structures and provides channels with nanoscale diameter for the growth of ZnO. It has been demonstrated that AAO template-assisted growth is an effective method to fabricate ordered nanowire arrays of ZnO.
In 2000, Li et al.238 synthesized highly ordered ZnO nanowire arrays by a three-step process: electrochemically generating an alumina template with nanochannels, which were highly ordered; electrodepositing metal Zn in the template; oxidizing the metal Zn to form nanowire arrays. The nanowires obtained with the diameters ranging from 15 to 90 nm were uniformly assembled into the ordered nanochannels of the template. In 2003, Lee et al.239 reported the fabrication of ZnO nanowire arrays in AAO templates (Fig. 27)239 by vapor deposition. The arrays obtained with narrow diameter distribution, high aspect ratio and high wire density were ordered and homogeneous.

5. TiO2
Over the past 10 years, more than forty thousand papers concerning TiO2 have been published, which makes it to be one of the most investigated semiconductor materials in materials science. TiO2 was applied in many devices which exploit solar energy due to the strong oxidizing power of photogenerated holes, low cost, and well stability. The dye-sensitized solar cells based on TiO2 can convert sunlight into electricity more efficiently. Hydrogen, which may be the fuel of the future, can be produced by splitting water under the help of photogenerated electron–hole pairs of TiO2. In addition, TiO2, as a photocatalyst, can degrade organic pollutants into environmentally friendly species, such as carbon dioxide and water.
For these applications, the specific surface area of the material has much influence on the overall efficiency, which leads to the widespread use of nanoparticulated forms of TiO2. However, due to the existence of defects, grain boundaries and surface states, the electron diffusion coefficients of TiO2 nanoparticles are comparably low.240,241
In order to considerably overcome the bottleneck, one-dimensional nanostructures of TiO2, such as nanotubes,242,243 nanorods244,245 and nanowires,246 are developed to substitute nanoparticles for the application. It is well known that the specific surface area and electronic behaviors can be effectively improved by reducing the dimension of the materials to the nanoscale, making the system more excellent. These 1D nanostructures are able to significantly accelerate electron transport behavior, and also possess large specific surface area. Herein, we mainly focus on the approaches for the synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes.
Up to now, many approaches have been applied to synthesize 1D TiO2.247–251 These approaches can be mainly classified into three groups, namely, template method, electrochemical synthesis and hydrothermal approach.
5.1 Template method
During the last decade, the methods for synthesis of nanostructured materials using templates have been rapidly developed.252
The method makes use of a material with desired morphology as a template to guide the formation of products, which as a result possess a similar morphology with the template. By means of this general approach, a large number of traditional or advanced materials with a variety of controlled shapes have been obtained through adjusting shape parameters of the template.
It should be noticed that much effort for the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes attempted to use porous alumina as a template.253–255
Back in 2001, Chu et al.253 successfully introduced porous Al2O3 template into sol–gel technology to fabricate TiO2 nanotube arrays, which possess large surface areas and anatase structure with (101) preferential orientation, standing on glass substrates (Fig. 28).253 In the process of preparation, highly pure Al film was first deposited on a glass substrate followed by an anodized process in phosphoric acid solution to obtain porous Al2O3 structures. The results of characterization showed that the TiO2 nanotubule arrays obtained exhibited high transmittance and strong absorbance for visible and ultraviolet light, respectively.

Based on the molecules, the templates applied for the preparation of TiO2 nanotubes can be divided into several groups. Among these groups, self-assembled organic surfactant templates have been widely used due to a large variety of organic molecules.256–360
In 2000, Hanabusa et al.256 reported the preparation of TiO2 nanotubes using an amphiphilic compound, trans-(1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanedi-(11-aminocarbonylundecylpyridinium) hexafluorophosphate, as a self-assembled template. The process contained the sol–gel polymerization of Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 and the self-assembly of the amphiphilic compound. Finally, TiO2 nanotubes could be obtained by the electrostatic interaction between the TiO2 species and the compound under basic conditions (Fig. 29).256 Subsequently, in 2003, Peng et al.257 obtained TiO2 microtubes with high specific surface areas by means of a surfactant-mediated template in a laurylamine hydrochloride/tetra-n-butyl-orthotitanate system. The microtubules obtained possessed well-developed cylindrical nanochannels and mesoporous walls, whose thickness was 0.2–2 μm. In the same year, Rao et al.258 employed a tripodal cholamide-based hydrogel as a template to synthesize TiO2 nanotubes. The diameters of the nanotubes can be controlled through adopting the suitable hydrogelator or modifying the conditions of gelation.

From what have been discussed above, it can be concluded that the method for the synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes using templates in general involves three steps as follows: the hydrolysis of titanium-containing compounds in the presence of templating agents, the polymerization of TiO2 or deposition of TiO2 onto the surface of the templates, and selective removal of the templates.
However, in most cases, the template method has an obvious disadvantage that the template used in the process needs to be removed at the end of synthesis, which increases the preparation cost and makes the process more complex.
5.2 The hydrothermal approach
In 1998, Kasuga et al.261 attempted to fabricate nanotubes composed of TiO2 with a large specific surface area by treating fine TiO2-based powders in NaOH aqueous solution with appropriate concentration at temperatures in the range of 110–150 °C. In this process, no sacrificial template was involved. The outer diameter and the length of TiO2 nanotubes obtained in the work are about 8 nm and 100 nm, respectively. This opens up a new route to synthesize TiO2 nanotubes using hydrothermal approaches.
Soon afterwards, much effort was devoted to transform a variety of TiO2 polymorphs to TiO2 nanotubes under hydrothermal conditions. It has been demonstrated that all polymorphs of TiO2 (anatase, rutile, brookite or amorphous) can be transformed to TiO2 nanotubes under hydrothermal conditions.
In 1999, Kasuga et al.262,263 succeeded in transforming anatase-phase and rutile-phase TiO2 to nanotubes. In the process, the raw materials were treated successively with NaOH aqueous solution, HCl aqueous solution and distilled water. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of obtained TiO2 nanotubes was also discussed. Kasuga et al. considered that during the alkali treatment, an amorphous product would be formed, and after treatment with distilled water and HCl aqueous solution, TiO2 nanotubes were obtained. In 2005, Gao et al.264 reported the fabrication of TiO2 nanotubes from rutile TiO2 powder by means of simple hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 30).264 In such a process, the raw TiO2 powder first reacted with NaOH solution to form layered sodium TiO2 with hollow-tube morphology. Subsequently, the structure can be transformed to layered hydrogen TiO2 retaining the same morphology through treatment with dilute HCl. Meanwhile, the effect of experimental parameters (such as time, temperature) on TiO2 obtained was explored and a possible mechanism for the reaction was also proposed.

5.3 Electrochemical synthesis
The products prepared by above methods often showed single tubes and loose agglomerates of tubes in the solution, which possess a wide distribution of tube lengths. For the application of electron devices, TiO2 nanotubes in the form of layers are often attached on the electrode surface. However, the layers prepared by above methods often involve nanotubes with arbitrary orientation, which cannot make the best of many advantages of 1D nanostructures. To overcome this problem, the electrochemical anodization approach is developed to fabricate an array of TiO2 nanotubes with uniform orientation and perpendicular to the substrate. Through electrochemical anodization, almost any shape of substrate can be coated with dense nanotubes, which is in favor of fine electrical connection and easy to handle.
In 2001, Grimes and co-workers265 fabricated well-aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays with a barrier layer at the bottom, the top of the nanotube was open while the bottom was closed, by anodizing pure Ti sheets in a H2O–HF electrolyte under variable conditions. The diameters of the nanotubes range from 25 to 65 nm and increase with anodizing voltage, while the length of the nanotube was independent of anodization time. In contrast to the products achieved by other methods, the nanotubes obtained here were perpendicular to the surface of the electrode with the same orientation forming a continuous film (Fig. 31).265 Finally, a possible growth mechanism was also proposed.

A number of papers describing electrolytes for the preparation of TiO2 nanotubes by anodization of titanium have been published.
In 2005, Schmuki et al.266 obtained layers composed of TiO2 nanotubes with high aspect ratio and porosity through anodic oxidation in (NH4)2SO4 electrolytes containing NH4F by potential sweeps. The nanotubes obtained possess diameters in the range of 90–110 nm and porosity in the order of 37–42%. It was demonstrated that the sweep rate had an influence on the thickness and morphology of the structures. In addition, they proposed a possible mechanism for the growth of the structure. They believed that a thin layer composed of titanium oxide-hydroxide would appear in the initial periods of anodization, followed by the formation of porous structure underneath the initial layer. Subsequently, the porous structure would grow randomly and self-organize.
In the same year, Schmuki et al.267 yet prepared the self-organized TiO2 nanotubes using phosphate electrolytes with small amounts of fluoride ions. The work explored the influence of electrochemical conditions, such as applied potential, anodizing time, and sweep rate, on the pore diameter and length of TiO2 nanotubes. The results showed that by tailoring the electrochemical parameters, the highly self-organized TiO2 nanotubes with diameters in the range of 40 nm to 100 nm and lengths from 100 nm to 4 μm were obtained.
Subsequently, Schmuki et al.268 reported the preparation of TiO2 nanotube layers by means of electrochemical anodization of Ti in water-free electrolytes (CH3COOH/NH4F). The results of the work indicated that the morphology of TiO2 nanotube layers obtained was strongly dependent on the applied potential. At low potentials, nanotubes as-synthesized possessed a diameter of 20 nm and a length of about 100 nm. In addition, bridging rings forming on the sidewall of the layers promoted the formation of a connection between ordered TiO2 nanotubes. Yet, at higher potentials, due to the appearance of local breakdown on the layers, some parts of them resembled coral reefs.
6 VO2
There is much interest in vanadium oxides owing to their broad range of applications in areas such as electrodes for lithium batteries,269 catalysis,270 electrochromic/-optical devices,271 and sensors.272 Vanadium oxide compounds exhibit a rich phase diagram due to the multiple valence states. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is the most stable member of these compounds since it possesses the maximal oxidation state. As a Li+ intercalation host, V2O5 has further advantages due to its layered structure.1 In addition, V2O5 (Eg = 2.8 eV) is susceptible to photoactivation with wavelengths less than 443 nm and has been used as a semiconductor-type photocatalyst.273
Nanomaterials offer unusual mechanical, electrical, and optical properties and the overall behaviors of such materials exhibit combinations of bulk and surface properties. For example, the nanostructure of vanadium oxide can considerably improve the capacities of molecules for sensing as well as for energy-storage devices in comparison to bulk. V2O5 nanorods with nanometer-sized diameters (e.g., 70 nm) deliver dramatically higher specific discharge capacities at low temperature than V2O5 nanorods with micrometer-sized diameters.274 A variety of vanadium oxide nanostructures have been synthesized, such as nanoparticles,275 nanoneedles, nanowires, nanorods,276,333 nanorolls,277 and nanoribbons.278,279 Many chemical and physical methods had been reported for the synthesis of nanostructured vanadium oxide. Those methods are classified into two categories:280 (1) dry processes including chemical vapor deposition (CVD),281 flame spray pyrolysis,275 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),339 and thermal treatment;282 (2) wet processes such as hydrothermal treatment,283 sol–gel synthesis,284,285 self-assembly,286 and templating methods.286–288 The wet process, which is a solution-based method or liquid phase method, is well-known for its advantages in tailoring the size and morphology of the nanostructures. In addition, they can combine with each other to produce the most desirable nanostructures with remarkability, selectivity, and variety.
Petr Novák et al.275 had successfully synthesized crystalline, spherical-like V2O5 nanoparticles (30–60 nm) by a one-step and scalable flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) and optimized the process conditions to obtain nanoparticles with improved electrochemical performance. Aldo et al.282 had easily prepared highly stable and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 15 nm by thermal treatment of a bariandite-like vanadium oxide, V10O24·9H2O. Reshef280 and his team showed the synthesis of hollow and closed V2O5 nanoparticles (NIF-V2O5) with a structure analogous to that of inorganic fullerene-like structures (IF) by PLA.
The tubular form of V2O5 is especially attractive because it possesses three different contact regions: inner and outer surface as well as the tube ends. Spahr et al.277 reported the synthesis and electrochemical properties of vanadium oxide nanorolls. In their reaction procedure, the sol–gel reaction contacting with hydrothermal treatment of vanadium oxide precursor was conducted in the presence of hexadecylamine that acted as a structure-directing template. TEM images of the resultant nanorolls indicated the multishell structure of the tube walls with an average layer thickness of about 3 nm. The free inner diameter of the tubes ranges between 25 and 35 nm and the total tube diameters are between 50 and 70 nm (Fig. 32).277

Martin289 and co-workers used a sol-gel-based template method to synthesize V2O5 nanorod arrays by depositing vanadium oxide (TIVO) into the pores of polycarbonate filtration membranes followed by removal of membranes at high temperature. In the latest work, they prepared V2O5 nanorods with different diameters and compared their electrochemical properties.274 Single-crystal vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanorod arrays were first reported by Cao's group.276 They utilized a template-based electrodeposition method by depositing V2O5 into pores of polycarbonate templates with the assistance of an electric field from different solutions or sol. Uniformly sized vanadium oxide nanorods with a length of about 10 μm and diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm were grown over a large area with near unidirectional alignment. In the case of nanorods made from the V2O5 sol by electrophoretic deposition, the formation of single-crystal nanorods is explained by homoepitaxial aggregation of crystalline nanoparticles.290
Nanoribbons, with a rectangular cross section, have been synthesized, and their morphology is distinctly different from that of nanowires and nanotubes. Such a nanostructure was mostly synthesized by hydrothermal treatment with different vanadium precursors. Li et al.337 obtained the nanoribbons by a simple hydrothermal method with the assistance of organic surfactant. The ribbons are tens of micrometers, typically 60–100 nm wide and 10–20 nm thick. Xie et al.291 successfully synthesized uniform V2O5·0.9H2O nanobelts with high aspect ratios on a large scale by a simple hydrothermal growth method using NH4VO3 as the raw material in the presence of sulfuric acid. The possible mechanism for the formation of the nanobelts was presented. Based on the layered structure of vanadium pentoxide and the experimental results of the hydrolysis and condensation of NH4VO3, the H3O+ intercalating and splitting process was proposed to elucidate the formation of the nanostructure. [VO(OH)3] units which were formed at the initial stage, each coordinated with two water molecules, were condensed and polymerized to form the layered framework of V2O5·xH2O. Then, the interlayer spaces in the layered structure of V2O5·xH2O were occupied by H3O+ ions, and thus the interactions between the layers were weakened and the layered V2O5·xH2O gradually split to form nanobelts.
7 NiO
NiO has received a great deal of attention in industry and academia due to its potential applications in fuel cell electrodes, thermistors, high-power ultra-capacitors and optical switching devices. NiO is considered a proto-typical p-type, wide band gap (3.6–4.0 eV) semiconductor.292–294 Nanostructures of NiO may result in various interesting properties compared to its bulk properties which may bring breakthroughs in its traditional applications. Many ways are developed to get the dimension NiO material. This part reviews several current studies that center on producing low dimension NiO material. Various methods have been used and developed for synthesizing NiO powders in nanoscale dimensions.
7.1 0D nanostructures of NiO
0D nanostructures of NiO have attracted more and more attention due to their great potential applications in areas such as catalysis, chemical and biological sensors, and electrodes. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to fabricate NiO nanoparticles in recent years. The research mainly focused on the microwave–hydrothermal process, which is an easy route of obtaining various morphologies of NiO nanoparticles.
Vijayakumar et al.295 reported that they synthesized the nanoflake nickel oxide successfully using the microwave heating method. In their work, nickel nitrate hexahydrate was added to cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Then, the pH of the solution was increased to 10 by dropwise addition of ammonia. After the microwave radiation, they collected the precipitate. Finally the as prepared nanoparticles are converted into NiO nanopowder by calcination. In the process the formation mechanism of the NiO nanoflakes includes the following: nucleation, growth, and oriented attachment. Microwave accelerates the nucleation rate and also enhances the growth process.
Zhu et al.296 reported that they synthesized the flower-like NiO. They also used nickel nitrate hexahydrate, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, and ammonia but with different ratios. Through the hydrothermal system they got the flower-like Ni(OH)2. To obtain the NiO architectures, the as-prepared Ni(OH)2 was calcined in air for 4 h.
Ren et.al.297 got the similar nanostructure of NiO, but their way was much simple. In the experiment nickel nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol, then the precursor solution was subjected to microwave heating maintained at 150 °C. After calcination, they also got the flower-like NiO.
Chemical deposition is also an efficient way to produce the NiO particle with different nanostructure. To obtain the uniform nanostructure by chemical deposition, a suitable temperature is needed to control the reaction speed. Zhang et al.298 got the three-dimensional mesoporous NiO nanostructures by a simple ethylene glycol (EG)-mediated self-assembly route and subsequent calcination process. They point out that the role of acetate was found to be very critical in this synthesis method. The acetate will precipitate to become the nuclei with EG. Xia et al.299 reported hierarchically structured NiO nanoflowers that were facile synthesized by incorporating a convenient solution process with a subsequent thermal treating process.
7.2 1D nanostructures of NiO
1D nanofibers have gained intensive attention due to their excellent magnetic, optical, electric, and chemical properties.300 Compared with general ferromagnetic materials, one-dimensional nanostructured magnetic materials have greater values of spontaneous magnetization and coercivity due to their low-symmetry structure.301Among various methods of making one-dimensional nanostructure magnetic materials, electrospinning is a simple, versatile and convenient approach with characteristics of easy control and low cost. A high voltage was applied between the needle and the acceptor. Under the power of static field, the sol–gel will be ejected from the needle tubing forming the nanowire. The voltages, viscosity of the sol–gel, speed of syringe pump, and the humidity are the key factor which will affect the nanostructure of the nanowire. Luo et al.302 reported that they have fabricated the NiO nanowire by electrospinning. First Ni(AC)2·4H2O and an appropriate amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O with different atomic ratios were mixed. Then they added the PVP powder slowly into the solution. The precursor sol solution was loaded into a plastic syringe. A high voltage was applied between the cooper plate collector and the syringe needle. Then the PVP/Ni(CH3COO)2 composite nanofibers were collected on the cooper during electrospinning processes. NiO nanofibers were finally obtained by calcination at 650 °C.
The precursor is a key factor in the electrospinning process. The volatility and the content of the precursor will affect the feature of the nanowire during the electrospinning process. According to the work of Wang et al.,303 they reported that an N,N-dimethylformamide solution containing 10 wt.% polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was prepared, and then nickel nitrate hexahydrate was added into this solution. Applied with a 10 kV voltage and the 600 °C calcination they got the porous NiO fiber.
Electrospinning is an efficient way to produce the 1D NiO nanowire. However, it cannot provide a large amount of NiO nanofibers, which means to obtain enough NiO nanofibers, large energy may be wasted. Compared with the electrospinning methods, microwave heating has unique effects and significant merits such as rapid volumetric heating, high reaction rate, short reaction time, and energy savings. Song et al.304 got polycrystalline NiO nanorods using a microwave-assisted method. First, the microwave-assisted method has been successfully used for fast synthesis of rod-shaped CH3COO–Ni–OC2H4OH. Then they got the pure polycrystalline NiO rod after calcination.
7.3 1-1 Dimension nanostructures of NiO
Electrospinning and hydrothermal methods are two simple but efficient ways to produce nanostructure materials. Combining these two methods together may provide an efficient way to design the complex nanostructure of the material with large surface area and unique performance. Lin et al.305 controlled the growth of ZnO nanorod arrays on NiO nanowires (NWs) to construct nanocomposites by electrospinning and hydrothermal methods (Fig. 33).305 The results indicated that the UV photosensors based on the nanocomposites exhibited excellent performance.

8 The application of transition-metal oxide nanostructures
Over the past decade, metal-oxide materials have been studied extensively as an important class of materials with useful functionalities and unique properties for optical, electronic, and magnetic applications. In this section, these applications will be discussed briefly.
8.1 Photovoltaic application
Metal oxide semiconductors, which are stable and environmentally friendly materials, are used in photovoltaics either as a photoelectrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) or to build metal oxide p–n junctions. Binary metal oxides, such as TiO2,306–308 ZnO,309–314 Fe2O3,315,316 ZrO2,317 Nb2O5,318,319 and Al2O3,320 and ternary compounds, such as SrTiO3 (ref. 321–325) and Zn2SnO4 (ref. 326–329), have been tested for their use as photoelectrodes in DSSCs (Fig. 34). TiO2, ZnO, and Nb2O5 are the best candidates as photoelectrodes due to their high chemical and thermal stability, hole blocking properties, and suitable electron selectivity.

8.2 Lithium ion batteries
Lithium-ion batteries are emerging as the technology of choice for portable electronics, electrodes for lithium-ion batteries made of metal oxide nanoparticles (such as SnO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, Co3O4 and complex metal oxides) provide high specific capacity, superior rate capability, and improved cycling performance (Fig. 35).330–335 Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used for electronics, electric vehicles, and other applications. Transition metal oxides, which possess significantly higher capacities than that of the current commercial anode material (graphite), hold great promise toward a high-energy density anode.

8.3 Photocatalysis
In the main classic photocatalytic areas (pollution degradation, water splitting and organic synthesis), TiO2 has been the most investigated photocatalytic material, photocatalytic reactions on TiO2 have over the last 30 years attracted tremendous scientific and technological interest (Fig. 36).338,339 In addition to the TiO2 photocatalyst, other metal oxides, such as SnO2, ZnO, WO3, Fe2O3, Cu2O and SrTiO3, have been studied to determine their photocatalytic oxidation properties.336–347 It is widely recognized that a photocatalyst with high photocatalytic activity requires both high crystallinity and large surface area to reduce recombination of the photo-generated electron–holes and to increase the density of active surface sites, as well as to enhance the light harvesting. The high-ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (m-WO3) hybridized with reduced graphene oxide has been successfully fabricated for the photocatalytic O2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation.342 It was found that CdS nanorod/reduced graphene oxide composites possessed excellent photocatalytic properties under visible light for the degradation of MO with a rate constant about three times higher than that of blank CdS nanorods.344

8.4 Gas-sensing
Semiconducting metal oxides such as WO3 (Fig. 37a), SnO2 (Fig. 37b), TiO2, and ZnO are used for gas sensing applications due to the sensitivity of their electrical conductivity to the ambient gas composition, which arises from charge transfer interactions with reactive gases such as O2, NOx, CO, hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds (Fig. 37c and d).348–350 For gas sensing materials, considerable effort has been made to achieve better sensitivity and higher selectivity towards low concentrations of pollutant gases at low operating temperatures. SnO2 nanostructures have attracted the most attention for the detection of a range of harmful gases due to their good chemical and long term thermal stability under the operating conditions of sensors.351–355

8.5 Biomedical application
Magnetic metal-oxide materials which have been functionalized with biological agents have many potential and exciting applications in the biomedical field. For example, the superparamagnetic Fe3O4 (ref. 356–363) is chemically and magnetically stable and biocompatible, and it can serve as a potent nanoprobe for magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Fig. 9b), and biosensors. Ferrite MFe2O4 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, etc.) has also been studied as a carrier for targeted drug delivery and therapy.364–366
9 Summary and outlook
This article provides a relatively comprehensive review of achievements on the growth control of metal oxide nanostructures with various morphologies synthesized by different approaches. However it cannot be the full coverage of all the achievements reported due to a large number of research studies. The research on fabrication of metal oxide nanostructures has been well-developed, meanwhile the morphologies of the nanostructures have been well-controlled through various methods. The fundamental effort has resulted in tremendous achievements and paves the way for the future applications in devices based on metal oxide nanostructures, such as nanolasers, field-effect transistors, solar cells, sensors and so on. The achievements inspire more enthusiasm of researchers to overcome the challenges that remain.
