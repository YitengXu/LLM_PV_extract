1. Introduction

Graphene is the most basic building block for all its allotropic materials.1,2 It can be wrapped up into 0D fullerenes,3 rolled into 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs)4 and stacked into 3D graphite as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Intrinsic graphene is a semi-metal or zero-band gap semiconductor. Long-range and delocalized π-conjugation in the graphene plane endows itself with exceptional electrical, mechanical and thermal properties: ultrahigh intrinsic carrier mobility (∼200000 cm2 V−1s−1),5 high thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1)6 and Young's modulus (∼1.0 TPa).7,8 Specifically, single-layer graphene (SLG) shows unique electronic structure: band overlaps at two inequivalent conical points K and K′ (called Dirac points) in the first Brillouin zone (Fig. 1b).9 In addition, because it only consists of one monoatomic layer, its theoretical optical transmittance can reach as high as 97.7%,10 which, along with its high electrical conductivity, may find interesting applications in next generation transparent electrodes, especially on flexible substrates.11–13

Similar to other new materials, the availability and processability of graphene have been the prerequisites for its further applications. Early attempts to synthesize monolayer graphite could be traced back to 1975, when Lang found evidence of monolayer graphite by thermal decomposition of carbon on single-crystal Pt substrate.14 Nevertheless, due to failure to identify its potential applications, graphene still remained “hidden” from the public. In 2004, Novoselov et al. employed a micromechanical exfoliation technique to successfully isolated two-dimensional crystal graphene from three-dimensional graphite onto a 300 nm oxidized silicon wafer and identified its potential applications in electronics,1 which gradually unveiled this mysterious material. Since then, research efforts have followed up on developing new processing routes for efficient synthesis of high-quality and large-scale SLG. Until now, there have been several widely used methods to produce “pristine” graphene: micromechanical exfoliation,1,15 liquid-phase exfoliation,16–18 epitaxial growth on SiC19,20 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth,21,22etc.
The large theoretical surface area (∼2630 m2 g−1) of graphene,23 which provides possibilities for its chemical functionalization, along with strong and flexible mechanical properties makes it promising in many applications. Modulation of its chemical and physical properties from the macroscopic to molecular scale has propelled a large share of the current research efforts.24–29 Note that many reviews have summarized the up-to-date achievements of graphene and graphene-based materials.9,30–36 From a different perspective, we review the research of the liquid-phase exfoliation of graphene, and then topically summarize the recent progress in its functionalization for various applications.
2. Liquid-phase exfoliation
Liquid-phase exfoliation is a widely used method to make colloidal dispersions of graphene in a variety of solvents. Its typical procedures involve exposure of graphite or graphite oxide powders to particular solvents, and then exposing these solutions to sonication. Based on the different starting graphite sources and exfoliation process, we generally summarize the current status of liquid-phase exfoliation into the following categories: liquid-phase exfoliations from graphite oxide, pristine graphite and expanded graphite (EG), and sonication-free liquid-phase exfoliation.
2.1 Liquid-phase exfoliation from graphite oxide

          Graphene oxide (GO) can be easily exfoliated by sonication from graphite oxide which can be easily prepared by the Hummers method.37 GO consists of an sp2-bonded carbon structure occupied by a large number of covalently bonded hydroxyl or carboxyl groups which give GO a significant advantage as it can be dispersed in some organic solvents at concentrations of up to 1 mg mL−125,38,39 and in water up to 7 mg mL−1.40 However, the oxidization process introduces significant defects in the as-made graphene, degrading its unique properties. Therefore, it is necessary to produce much less defective graphene and develop more effective reduction methods to obtain chemically reduced graphene (CRG). At early time, Stankovich et al. proposed to reduce a GO film in hydrazine at 100 °C for 24 h (Fig. 2).38 In the following years, some other reducing agents were also developed such as hydroquinone,41sodium borohydride (NaBH4).42 Using a different chemical environment, Wang et al. developed an effective solvothermal reduction method which was carried out in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 180 °C by using hydrazine as the reducing agent.43 The solvothermal process of GO with N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) in the absence of hydrazine was also reported.44 Recently, metal Fe was reported to reduce exfoliated GO.45 Nevertheless, none of these reduction methods can recover the graphene structure completely and some oxygen-containing groups are still irremovable.

2.2 Liquid-phase exfoliation from pristine graphite
To minimize the oxide defects in graphene, Hernandez et al. developed a gentle method to produce high-quality graphene through dispersion and exfoliation of pristine graphite in certain organic solvents which have been known to effectively disperse CNTs, such as NMP, DMF, γ-butyrolactone (GBL), 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone.18 After sonication of 30 min, followed by centrifugation (500 rpm, 90 min), the concentration of graphene dispersion can reach up to 0.01 mg mL−1, and the monolayer yield was around 1 wt% in NMP, which could be potentially improved up to 7–12 wt% with further treatment. Although technically similar to the exfoliation of GO, this simple protocol differs essentially from it by the absence of the oxidation step. Among all of the test solvents, NMP provided the best thermodynamic stabilization due to the best matching surface energy with that of graphite (Fig. 3a). Raman spectra of individual flakes further identified defect-free monolayers or multilayers from absence of the D band and the shape of 2D band, confirming the high quality of the graphene (Fig. 3b).

It is demonstrated that the success of such exfoliation depends on the small net energetic cost of the whole process.18 This energy balance can be expressed as the enthalpy of mixing per unit volume, which can be derived as:  where δ is the square root of the surface energy of graphite or solvents (the surface energy of graphite is defined as the energy per unit area minimum required to overcome the van der Waals forces when peeling two sheets apart), Tflake is the thickness of a graphene flake and ϕ is the volume fraction of graphene. The matching of graphene and solvent surface energies is one criterion for a successful exfoliation process: the closer the graphene and solvent surface energies are, the smaller the enthalpy of mixing is, and the higher degree of exfoliation will be.
A range of solvents with varying surface energies were tested to exfoliate graphite into dispersions as shown in Fig. 4. The concentration of resulting graphene (after centrifugation) showed a peak for surface energy close to 40 mJ m−2 which matched with the reported values for the surface energy of graphite.46,47 This implies the possible surface energy criterion for graphene exfoliation. As the surface energy of water (72.75 mJ m−2) is much higher than this criterion, surfactants are employed to tune the water surface energy to a proper level for aqueous processed exfoliation. Lotya et al. used water and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate to exfoliate graphite with the aid of sonication.48 As a result, more than 40% of these graphene flakes were less than five layers, with 3% of flakes consisting of monolayers, and showed to be free of defects under atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectra. Due to the adsorbed surfactant and charged surface of graphene, the dispersed flakes were relatively stable against aggregation. However, the concentration was still very low within a range from 0.002 to 0.05 mg mL−1, much lower than dispersion from NMP exfoliation. Recently, the concentration of water/sodium cholate exfoliated graphene dispersion was reported to reach up to 0.3 mg mL−1 after an ultralong sonication time.16

These essential properties of solvents also play a significant role in avoiding graphene aggregation. Recent theoretical work by means of molecular dynamics simulations and the kinetic theory of colloid aggregation has elucidated the stabilization mechanism of liquid-phase exfoliated graphene, and demonstrated their dispersion ability as follows: NMP ∼ DMSO > DMF > GBL > H2O, which is quite consistent with the reported experimental results.49
In addition to the organic and inorganic solvents discussed above, ionic liquids (ILs) are another promising candidate. IL is considered as a “green solvent” due to its unique properties such as negligible vapour pressure, low toxicity and high chemical stabilities. Most importantly, IL has a surface tension closely matched with that of graphite, which is the key prerequisite of solvents for direct exfoliation.50 It was reported that stable and highly concentrated suspensions (0.95 mg mL−1) of non-oxidized few-layer graphene (FLG) was obtained via tip sonication of natural graphite flakes in the IL such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][Tf2N]).51
2.3 Liquid-phase exfoliation from expanded graphite
High temperature or microwave treatments have been employed to expand graphite for better liquid-phase exfoliation.52–54Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are also widely used as starting materials for exfoliation.55–57 Our group, using thermally EG as the starting material, showed that monolayer and bilayer graphene could be produced by a solvothermal-assisted exfoliation process in acetonitrile (ACN), with the production of monolayer and bilayer graphene nanosheets (GNS) around 10 wt% (Fig. 5).52 Recently, it was reported that large-flake graphene up to 300 μm2 can be exfoliated from graphite by oleylamine in solvothermal conditions, with a high concentration of 0.15 mg mL−1.58

The insolubility of graphite is another key factor limiting the degree of liquid-phase exfoliation. To tackle this problem, chemical modification of graphite has been explored for facilitating their solubility and subsequent exfoliation. For example, Sun et al. used in situdiazonium reactions to bond 4-bromophenyl onto the surface of EG, and followed by mild sonication in DMF. These functionally-assisted exfoliated graphene had higher solubility than pristine graphene without any stabilizer additive of which more than 70% of these soluble flakes had less than five layers.59 Recently, our group developed aqueous dispersed graphene solution using 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ)-anion as stabilizer and EG as starting material, which could also provide high-quality water soluble graphene for various applications.60
In 2008, Liet al. developed a liquid-phase method to exfoliate graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), with the assistance of poly(m-phenylenevinylene-co-2,5-dioctoxy-p-phenylenevinylene) (PmPV), directly from EG for potential molecular electronics (Fig. 6).61 It involved exfoliating expandable graphite at 1000 °C and 30-min sonication of EG in the 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solution. The polymer PmPV, which noncovalently functionalized the graphene, played a role in π-interaction with conjugated plane and consequently stabilized nanoribbons in a homogeneous suspension. GNRs are materials with different properties from graphene sheets.62–65 The all-semiconducting nature of sub-10 nm GNRs could solve the problem of the lack of bandgap in the pristine graphene. Electrical transport experiments on these exfoliated GNRs demonstrated, unlike single-walled CNTs, that all of the sub-10 nm GNRs were semiconductors with on–off ratios of about 107 at room temperature. After evaluation of all the GNR devices with varying widths from ∼sub-10 to ∼55 nm, the bandgap was fitted inversely proportional to their width.65

Although GNRs appear to be a promising candidate to replace CNT for future nanoelectronics, making GNRs using lithographic,64,66 chemical,67–69 and liquid-phase exfoliation61 methods is still at the initial stages before scalable fabrication. Recently, well-designed GNRs were obtained from exfoliating multi-walled CNTs by Ar plasma63 or solution-based oxidation process using KMnO4,62 which proposed a new concept for the production of GNRs. Besides, thick carbon nanoribbons could also be produced directly from graphite through an electrochemical process by anionic intercalation and oxidative cleavage.70 With these merits of GNRs, the next major challenge is to find an efficient and reliable way to synthesize GNRs in solution.

          Sonication-free liquid-phase exfoliation

Supercritical CO2 exfoliation. 
A supercritical CO2 processing technique was reported for intercalating and exfoliating layered graphite to graphene. Specifically, FLG was produced by immersing powdered pure graphite in the atmosphere of supercritical CO2 for 30 min and followed by rapidly depressurizing the supercritical fluid to expand and exfoliate graphite. The graphene sheets were collected by discharging the expanding CO2 gas directly into a solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate to avoid restacking.71


Electrochemical exfoliation. 
The IL modified graphite can be exfoliated into graphene through one-step electrochemical approach by applying static potential bias between the two graphite rods.70,72 The exfoliation mechanism is due to a complex interplay of anodic oxidation of water and anionic intercalation from IL.


Self-exfoliation in liquid phase. 

Graphene can also be self-exfoliated by induced strong repulsions between the interlayers. For example, GICs such as K(tetrahydrofuran)xC24 dissolved in NMP could spontaneously exfoliate into stable, air-sensitive solutions of graphene sheets without sonication due to strong negative charge repulsions (Fig. 7a).73 Recently, Behabtu et al. demonstrated that graphite could be spontaneously exfoliated into SLG in chlorosulfonic acid, and dissolved at isotropic concentrations as high as 2 mg mL−1, which was an order of magnitude higher than previously reported values (Fig. 7b).74 Similarly, such exfoliation also resulted from the strong repulsions induced by acid protonated graphene interlayers. The resulting highly concentrated isotropic liquid phases are promising for scalable manufacture of nanocomposites, films and high-performance fibers.

3. Functionalization for applications
Modifying the surface of graphene (basal planes or edges) by bringing foreign atoms or molecules onto the surface through chemical bonding, van der Waals forces or π–π interactions can modulate the properties of graphene for various applications such as strengthening GO paper, field effect transistors (FETs), electrochemical sensors, chemical catalysts and energy storage and conversion devices.
3.1 Strengthening graphene oxide paper
Theoretical simulations and experimental studies of the mechanical properties of graphene, including Young's modulus and fracture strength, predict that graphene and graphene-based materials may possess superior mechanical properties,7,8,75–77 which lays a solid foundation for its other applications. Individual defect-free graphene has a Young's modulus of 1.0 TPa and a fracture strength of 130 GPa.7 In contrast, the CRG obtained by reducing GO with hydrogen plasma exhibited a lower elastic modulus of 0.25 TPa.78 The mechanical properties of individual functionalized graphene are rarely reported. Another graphene-based novel material is GO paper which can be made by filtration or flow-directed assembly.79 The average elastic modulus and the highest fracture strength were 32 GPa and 120 MPa, respectively. The mechanical properties of this GO paper could be improved by cross-linking the individual platelets using divalent ions (Mg2+ and Ca2+)80 or poly(allylamine) hydrochloride.81 In both cases, significant enhancement in mechanical stiffness and fracture strength of GO paper compared with the unmodified graphene could be attributed to an increase in the interlayer cross-linking by bonding between the GO sheets and functional counterparts.
3.2 Field effect transistors
Although graphene has shown great potential for next generation nanoelectronic devices in replacement of silicon, one of the biggest challenges for graphene is the lack of a bandgap in its electronic spectra. Another problem is that most of the as-made graphene FETs are p-type owing to unintentional doping by species absorbed from the ambient such as oxygen or water. Several methods have been developed to deal with these bandgap engineering issues. In addition to substrate82 and confined-dimensions61 induced bandgap, an alternative approach is to dope exotic atoms or chemical groups in the lattice or edges that can also open the bandgap.
In recent years, various studies of the electronic transport in nitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene FETs, both theoretically and experimentally, have been presented.24,26,83–85 Wei et al. reported the preparation of N-doped FLG by adding NH3 during the CVD process at a temperature of 800 °C, exhibiting an n-type behaviour.26 N-Type FETs obtained by nitrogen doping graphene materials via electrothermal reactions of GNRs24 (Fig. 8a, b) or high temperature annealing of GO in NH3 have been demonstrated.84 Sinitskii et al. performed a kinetics study of diazonium salts functionalization of GNRs and showed that they could monitor the electrical properties of GNR FETs (Fig. 8c, d).86

3.3 Electrochemical sensors

Graphene is a promising electrode material due to its large surface area23 which facilitates the electron transport along its surface. As exotic molecular disruption on the intrinsic graphene electronic structure can be easily detected, graphene-based sensors are expected to be highly sensitive for detecting individual molecules on and off its surface.87–90
For example, graphene sheets decorated with Pt and Pd nanoparticles (NPs) (Fig. 9a) displayed sensitive and fast response to glucose.88 The presence of Pt and Pd NPs increased the electroactive area of the electrodes and substantially decreased the over-potential in the detection of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the Pt/graphene glucose biosensor had a sensitivity of 61.5 ± 0.6 μA mM−1 cm−2 and gave a linear response of up to 20 mM, with a detection limit of 1 μM (Fig. 9b). In another example, cationic polyelectrolyte poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) functionalized graphene sheets with high loading Au NPs enhanced the performance for H2O2 sensing.89 It is also worth noting that GO on the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) modified electrodes could be directly reduced through an electrochemical process.91 The reduced GO adsorbed on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were modified with glucose oxidase by covalent bonding via a polymer generated by electrografting N-succinimidyl acrylate and the modified GO electrodes were also successfully used to detect glucose. Recently, an IL-functionalized graphene electrode was reported for low-potential NADH detection (440 mV decrease) and biosensing for ethanol.90 The IL-graphene/chitosan/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) modified electrode biosensor showed rapid and highly sensitive amperometric response to ethanol with a low detection limit of 5 μM (Fig. 9 c, d).

3.4 Chemical catalysts
The large surface area of graphene can serve as a host material for metal NPs and its convenience in charge transfer provides a new way to develop advanced catalysts.92 For example, chemically converted graphene (CCG) with 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) and Au-ionic liquid (Au-IL) (CCG/PTCA/Au-IL) composites exhibited good electrocatalytic behavior toward oxygen reduction.93 It was demonstrated that the modification of CCG with Au-IL could play an important role in increasing the electrocatalytic activity of CCG (Fig. 10a, b). Many studies implied that graphene should be a favourable candidate for the catalyst supports in methanol oxidation. It was reported that graphene-supported Pt or Pt/Ru NPs displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation.94,95 Recently, PtRu/PMo12/graphene catalysts were synthesized and exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and better electrochemical stability for methanol oxidation compared with the PtRu/graphene catalysts.96

Selective electrochemical analysis could be achieved due to the selective catalysis of metal/graphene nanocomposites. Scheuermann et al. reported that the Pd/graphene composite catalysts were successfully applied to the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction (Fig. 10c).28 Recently, graphene modified with Au NPs was also used to act as efficient catalysts for the Suzuki reaction in water under aerobic condition.97 Furthermore, the catalytic activity of Au NPs/graphene hybrids was influenced by the size of Au NPs.
Besides metal NPs, N-doped graphene prepared by nitrogen plasma treatment displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide.98 Noncovalent functionalization of CRG with methylene green exhibited a lower charge transfer resistance and better electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of NADH, compared with pristine CRG.99
3.5 Energy storage and conversion devices
The merits of graphene-based electrodes for applications in energy storage and conversion devices, such as rechargeable lithium ion batteries (RLBs), supercapacitors and solar cells have been widely reported recently.29,100–105
The key to increase the energy densities and cycling performance of RLBs is to optimize the anode materials. Many research attempts have been made to design new graphene-based electrode materials, especially metal oxide/graphene composites. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh g−1, which was much larger than that of graphite. With addition of macromolecules of CNTs and C60, it increased to 730 and 784 mAh g−1, respectively.100 Such increased storage capacity is due to the increase of interlayers distance between the graphene platelets intercalated by CNTs or C60 molecules. Following this work, Paek et al. further found that SnO2/GNS electrodes exhibited a reversible capacity of 810 mAh g−1 (Fig. 11a, b) with its drastically enhanced cycling performance compared with that of the bare SnO2 NPs.101 The dimensional confinement of SnO2 NPs by the surrounding GNS limited the volume expansion upon lithium insertion, and the developed pores between SnO2 and GNS could be used as buffered spaces during charge and discharge, resulting in the superior cyclic performances. Wang et al. developed an anionic surfactant mediated growth of self-assembled TiO2/graphene hybrid nanostructures.29 The nanostructured graphene hybrid materials showed enhanced Li-ion insertion and extraction kinetics in TiO2, especially at high charge and discharge rates. Co3O4/graphene composites were reported to exhibit a large reversible capacity (935 mAh g−1 after 30 cycles), excellent cyclic performance, high Coulombic efficiency (above 98%) and good rate capability.102 Recently, Fe3O4/GNS composite electrodes showed a high reversibility, and its reversible capacity even gradually increased to 1026 mAh g−1 after cycling (Fig. 11c, d).103

Supercapacitors, as a system between dielectric capacitor and battery, have attracted great interest recent years. Due to its different mechanism of storing electrical energy, it can be sorted as electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor. Stoller et al. reported a novel graphene-based supercapacitor from chemically modified graphene, showing excellent performance with specific capacitances of 135 and 99 F g−1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively.104 Nanostructured metal oxide–graphene hybrids such as SnO2, ZnO, MnO2/graphene, were widely used for supercapacitor applications.106–108 Supercapacitor devices based on CCG and polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers films and composites displayed high capacitance of 210 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 and 480 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, respectively.109,110 Wang et al. reported that single-crystalline Ni(OH)2 hexagonal nanoplates directly grown on GNS could exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1335 F g−1 at a charge and discharge current density of 2.8 A g−1 and 953 F g−1 at 45.7 A g−1 with excellent cycling ability.27
Recently, noncovalent functionalization of graphene with 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid was employed to fabricate multifunctional devices such as highly sensitive and selective sensors (resistance changes >10000% in saturated ethanol vapor), and supercapacitors with extremely high specific capacitance (120 F g−1), power density (105 kW kg−1), and energy density (9.2 Wh kg−1).111
In addition, functionalized graphene films have also emerged as an interesting alternative electrode material in solar cells.112–114
4. Conclusions and outlook
Liquid-phase exfoliation process opens up a promising approach to scale up the production of graphene. Although GO exfoliation gives the highest concentration in organic solvent or water dispersions, it faces some significant demerits. Due to the irreversible induced destruction in the π-orbital conjugated structures by oxidation, the degradation of the electronic properties, which make graphene unique, can hardly be completely recovered by a chemical reduction process. Specific evidence of poor electronic properties can be found by the low conductivity in cast films and low on–off ratio in its FETs. Solution processing of high-quality graphene exfoliated directly from pure graphite in NMP simply overcomes these weak points, retaining its high electrical performance with few structural defects. However, this process is not perfect. Some solvents, such as NMP, are expensive and toxic with a high-boiling point, requiring special treatment when handling. Meanwhile, many applications are ruled out by the need of using high-boiling-point and toxic solvents. The subsequent aqueous exfoliation generally makes the production “greener” and possible in low-cost manner. Meanwhile, a charged surface of graphene with adsorbed surfactants avoids rapid aggregation. Furthermore, graphene dispersed in an aqueous environment greatly facilitates post-processing such as deposition on a variety of substrates or filtration to form a thin film on membranes.
Of all the methods discussed above, self-exfoliation without sonication seems to be more promising due to its low-energy input, high-quality and high-concentration output. Obviously, the resulting graphene size is directly restricted to the starting graphite size which is typically around several millimetres. Future challenges should aim to address the problems with uncontrollable and random size and layer number in liquid-phase exfoliation, which still limits the applications of graphene. At the same time, aggregation of graphene must be avoided and a high concentration of monolayers of graphene or GNRs must be achieved.
With all the merits from liquid-phase exfoliated graphene, it is efficient to modulate its properties by functionalization through wet chemical routes. Experimental studies of functionalization demonstrate that not only the electronic properties but also the chemical properties of graphene can be modulated, and make it unique in all kinds of applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, relatively less theoretical work was conducted on understanding the modified parts with graphene. It is highly suggested that the future work should emphasize the understanding of functional parts in the system and then design the desired materials. With precise control of the properties of graphene, it is expected that more interesting applications will be developed with predicted functionalities.
