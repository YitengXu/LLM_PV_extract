    , Accepted 16th December 2014First published on 16th December 2014AbstractA new diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative with appropriate energy levels and bipolar charge-transport properties is designed and synthesized. When this molecule is used as either electron donor or acceptor, the resulting organic solar cells both give the power conversion efficiencies over 3%.
Until now, fullerene and its derivatives (e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, abbreviated as PC71BM) have been the predominant electron acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs). When PC71BM is blended with some high-performance polymers or small molecule electron donors to fabricate bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as ca. 10% can be achieved.1 However, fullerene derivatives have some obvious drawbacks, such as poor light-harvesting ability and high-cost purification process. These limitations will inevitably hinder the future commercialization of OSCs. Therefore, the exploration of new organic electron acceptors for OSCs attracts more and more interest, and has made impressive progress in recent years.2 For example, with a perylene dimide derivative as the acceptor and a low band gap polymer as the donor, respectively, the resulting BHJ OSC shows a PCE up to about 6%.2c Nevertheless, if the most frequently used polymer donor, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), is applied in the non-fullerene acceptor-based OSCs, the PCEs are normally below 3%.3
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is an excellent building block to construct high-performance small molecules and polymers for electronic and opto-electronic applications due to its advantages of good photochemical stability, strong light absorption, and well-conjugated structure. When DPP is copolymerized or linked with an aromatic five-membered ring (e.g. thiophene), the resulting molecules adopt easily a quinoid state to delocalize π-electrons along the chemical bonds, in favour of molecular coplanarity, the narrowing of the band gap, and intermolecular π–π stacking.4 Thereby, this type of DPP-based material is suitable to be applied as the charge-transport material in field-effect transistors (FETs)5 and the donor in OSCs,6 but not as the acceptor since good molecular coplanarity will lead to large aggregates, which can disrupt efficient exciton dissociation in the active layer of OSCs.
Taking these considerations into account, in this communication, we design and synthesize a new DPP derivative, F(DPP)2B2, in which a fluorene ring is functioned as the core, two DPP units as the arms, and two benzene rings as the end-groups (Fig. 1a). Here we select two kinds of aromatic six-membered rings (fluorene and benzene) to connect two DPP moieties because there exist moderate dihedral angles between DPP and aromatic six-membered rings (through theoretical simulations, two dihedral angles, φ1 and φ2, are calculated to be 22.2° and 24.4°, respectively, Fig. 1a). Thus, the obtained DPP molecule would show a narrowed band gap as well as a lower-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, i.e. the appropriate energy levels for use as the acceptor. More importantly, due to the bad molecular coplanarity of F(DPP)2B2, the active layer is expected to exhibit fine phase separation domains when F(DPP)2B2 is blended with P3HT, ensuring high exciton dissociation efficiency of the non-fullerene OSCs.

F(DPP)2B2 is synthesized through traditional palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reactions of DPP units with fluorene and benzene rings, and its chemical structure is fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS (ESI, Fig. S1–S3†). Fig. 1b depicts the UV-visible absorption spectra of F(DPP)2B2 in CHCl3 solution and thin film. As expected, the F(DPP)2B2 film shows intense absorptions in the range of 550–700 nm, which are red-shifted relatively to those of the DPP unit (300–500 nm), and complement well those of P3HT (400–600 nm), suggesting the excellent light-harvesting capability of the OSCs when F(DPP)2B2 is used as the electron acceptor and P3HT as the electron donor. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements are done to characterize the energy level structure of F(DPP)2B2. From the onset oxidation potential (0.81 V versus SCE) and the onset reduction potential (−1.01 V versus SCE) presented in Fig. 1c, the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of F(DPP)2B2 are obtained to be −5.21 and −3.39 eV, respectively. Thereby, both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of F(DPP)2B2 are lower than those of P3HT (−4.76 and −2.74 eV), but higher than those of PC71BM (−5.8 and −4.0 eV),7 as illustrated in Fig. 1d. We observe that the differences between their LUMOs are large enough to dissociate excitons, in the mean time, the offset between the LUMO of F(DPP)2B2 and the HOMO of P3HT, as well as that between the LUMO of PC71BM and the HOMO of F(DPP)2B2 are both very large, which can provide high VOC of the OSCs. We also employ the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to determine the charge-transport properties of F(DPP)2B2. Fig. 1e shows the J0.5–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices with the as-cast F(DPP)2B2 film as the charge-transport layer. From Fig. 1e, the electron and hole mobilities of F(DPP)2B2 are calculated to be 2.8 × 10−4 and 4.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The above findings demonstrate that F(DPP)2B2 possesses appropriate energy levels and charge-transport characteristics as either electron donor or acceptor in the OSCs.
To evaluate potential applications of F(DPP)2B2 as both electron donor and acceptor in OSCs, two types of organic photovoltaic devices are fabricated. For the first one, F(DPP)2B2 is used as an electron donor and PC71BM as an electron acceptor with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/F(DPP)2B2:PC71BM/PFN/Al. For the second one, F(DPP)2B2 is functioned as an electron acceptor and P3HT as an electron donor with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:F(DPP)2B2/PFN/Al. Fig. 2a and b present the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the two kinds of OSCs under AM 1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and all photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. We can observe that the first kind of OSC gives a maximum PCE of 3.26% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 8.08 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.89 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.453 when the blend weight ratio of donor (F(DPP)2B2) and acceptor (PC71BM) is 1:3. For the second kind of OSC, it is found that thermal annealing can improve significantly the device's photovoltaic performance. With a 1:1 blend ratio of donor (P3HT) and acceptor (F(DPP)2B2), the device exhibits the highest PCE of 3.17% with a JSC of 5.35 mA cm−2, an extremely large VOC of 1.18 V, and a FF of 0.502 after annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is one of the highest values ever reported for P3HT and non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs.2e,8 Shown in Fig. 2c and d are external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two kinds of OSCs. It is apparent that the shapes of the EQE spectra resemble those of the combination absorptions of the donor and acceptor, suggesting that each component in the active layers contributes to the photovoltaic responses of the two types of OSCs.

We investigate the morphologies of the active layers in the two kinds of OSCs by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3). It can be seen from Fig. 3a that the as-cast 1:3 F(DPP)2B2:PC71BM film is very smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.87 nm, leading to perfectly fine phase separation domains in a scale of 20–30 nm, as shown in Fig. 3b. For the as-cast 1:1 P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 film, P3HT is completely compatible with F(DPP)2B2, and the RMS roughness of the blended film is only 0.40 nm, so that no obvious donor–acceptor phase separation can be observed (Fig. 3c and d). After thermal annealing, due to the self-organization of P3HT and F(DPP)2B2 to orderly crystalline structures (ESI, Fig. S4†), the RMS roughness of the 1:1 P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 film increases to 2.14 nm, and the donor–acceptor phase separation domains at the size of 40–60 nm are formed and well interconnected, giving the percolated network for charge transportation (Fig. 3e and f), which can be proved by the improvement of electron and hole mobilities (ESI, Fig. S5†). The above changes in the morphology are beneficial to efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection in the OSCs. In addition, we observe that thermal annealing also induces stronger absorptions of P3HT and F(DPP)2B2 in the red-light region (ESI, Fig. S6†). Therefore, thermal annealing elevates tremendously the photovoltaic performances of the P3HT:F(DPP)2B2 based OSCs.

In conclusion, a new DPP molecule F(DPP)2B2 is designed and synthesized by linking two DPP units with fluorene and benzene rings. Because of the twisted molecular conformation, F(DPP)2B2 exhibits suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels matching perfectly those of PC71BM and P3HT, and provides fine phase separation domains in the blended films favourable for exciton dissociation. Thus, the resulting OSCs both give the PCEs of more than 3% while F(DPP)2B2 is used as either electron donor or acceptor. The above results also demonstrate that the accurate tuning of the molecular conformation is one feasible route to obtain high-performance organic photovoltaic materials, especially non-fullerene acceptors.
