    , Accepted 22nd February 2017First published on 23rd February 2017AbstractThe inclusion of iodide additives in hybrid perovskite precursor solutions has been successfully exploited to improve the solar cell efficiency but their impact on perovskite formation, morphology and photovoltaic performance is still not clear. Here an extensive analysis of the effect of iodide additives in the solution-phase and during the perovskite film formation, as well as their effect on device performance is provided. The results demonstrate that in the solution-phase the additives promote the formation of lead poly-iodide species resulting in the disaggregation of the inorganic lead iodide framework and in the formation of smaller nuclei inducing the growth of uniform and smooth perovskite films. Most importantly, the complexation capability of different iodide additives does not only directly affect film morphology but also influences the density of defect states by varying the stoichiometry of precursors. These findings demonstrate that the fine control of the interactions of the chemical species in the solution-phase is essential for the precise control of the morphology at the nanoscale and the growth of the perovskite films with a reduced density of defect states. Therefore, the in-depth understanding of all the processes involved in the solution-phase is the first step for the development of a facile and reproducible approach for the fabrication of hybrid perovskite solar cells with enhanced photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed metal halide perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications, spanning from photovoltaic devices1,2 to light-emitting diodes.3,4 Owing to their excellent photophysical properties, namely large absorption coefficients,5 tunable bandgaps,6 ambipolar charge mobilities,7 long carrier diffusion lengths8 and lifetimes,9 perovskite solar cells have recently surpassed the power conversion efficiency of 21%,1 which is comparable to the state of the art photovoltaic technologies.
A perovskite structure consists of an inorganic cage of corner sharing octahedra and organic cations filling the voids, and its formation occurs spontaneously onto the substrate upon the deposition of a mixture of the two precursors, usually lead halide and methylammonium (MA) halide salts to form the most studied CH3NH3PbI3.10 Because of the intrinsically disordered self-assembly formation process, the resulting perovskite polycrystalline films are often heterogeneous and loaded with defect states acting as charge traps or recombination pathways for photogenerated charges. Being determinant for the morphology of the film, the crystallization process also dramatically affects the solar device performance. In order to overcome this issue, many efforts have been devoted to the fine optimization of the deposition process aiming to gain a control over the nucleation process and crystallization kinetics.11,12,45 Several approaches have been pursued, including solvent engineering techniques, one-/two-step solution depositions or thermal evaporation,13,14 in combination with disparate post-deposition treatments15,16 or with the use of functional substrates.17,18 Nonetheless, one-step solution deposition remains the simplest and most straightforward approach, thus envisioning attractive large-scale production of devices. However, the raw spin-casting of an equimolar mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2 precursors leads to an uncontrolled growth of the perovskite grains, and it always results in perovskite films with non-ideal morphology with pinholes and voids, causing severe shortening and charge carrier recombination in actual devices. In this regard, it has been found that perovskite crystallization depends not only on the casting conditions but it is also largely influenced by the composition of the precursor solutions,19 which can be efficiently tailored through the use of additives. The use of additives could indeed alter the complex equilibrium of ionic species in the solution of precursors, which form a soft-coordination framework evolving in the final perovskite film, thus having a great influence on the resulting morphology.20,21 To this purpose, a huge variety of acids,22,23 salts24,25 and other compounds,26–28 have been explored for the fabrication of highly smooth and continuous films amenable to device fabrication. Among all the possible additives, halide compounds, such as iodide derivatives, have been successfully employed reaching highly efficient perovskite solar cells22,26via single step deposition, but their role in the perovskite formation is not fully understood. Most importantly, besides morphology control, halide additives could also be involved in other aspects of material growth, not yet in-depth investigated, such as the stoichiometric composition and defect density. The inclusion of additional halide species, indeed, will inevitably modify the stoichiometry and, therefore, the density of halide vacancies within the resulting crystal.
In this frame, the present study aims at elucidating the effect of iodide additive inclusion in the MAI/PbI2 precursor mixture and the possible complexation phenomena having an impact on the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film formation and properties. We thus evaluate the role of two different iodide additives on the processing of perovskite thin films and device efficiency. As iodine sources, we select hydroiodic acid (HI) because it is one of the most efficient additives for perovskite solar cells22,29,30 and compared it with an iodide salt with a lower acidity, ammonium iodide (NH4I). We demonstrate that the evolution toward a continuous perovskite film is related to the rate of poly-iodide species formation, which is determined by the availability of iodide ions in solution. The perovskite precursor mixture is a colloidal suspension, consisting of coordination complexes between rod-shaped PbI2 crystals and MAI, in which MAI acts as a surfactant facilitating the dispersion of PbI2.19 Morphological differences encountered during the fabrication of perovskite polycrystalline films can be attributed to the perovskite nucleation process. In general, crystallization is a stepwise process, which starts from a relatively slow nucleation, followed by a faster growth step.31 The coordination complexes function as nucleation seeds for the perovskite growth and thus their dimension and crystal structure largely predetermine the final CH3NH3PbI3 crystal size and shape.19 Due to the low solubility of PbI2 at the concentrations commonly used for device fabrication, the starting nuclei thus the growing CH3NH3PbI3 crystals preserve the rod-like shape typical of the inorganic PbI2 structure hindering the formation of a good film coverage and morphology. Here we demonstrate that the complexation of PbI2 in the form of poly-iodide species, besides increasing PbI2 solubility, reduces the colloid size and the dimension of the nuclei evolving in uniform and smooth perovskite poly-crystal films, finally resulting in improved photovoltaic performances. Through the use of iodide additives with different complexation capabilities, we can act on the nucleation and crystallization processes and tune the dimension of the starting colloidal PbI2 seeds obtaining perovskite films with distinct grain sizes. Most importantly, through monitoring the effects of ambient atmosphere exposure on the device performance and photoluminescence decay time of the corresponding perovskite films, we propose a correlation between the complexation degree and the defect state concentration, drawing some guidelines for the judicious choice of additives towards high-quality perovskite thin films.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Lead poly-iodide species formation through additive inclusion
To evaluate the effect of iodide inclusion, we firstly study an equimolar mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2 in DMF. Here we found that the addition of iodide derivatives to the mixture of precursors in DMF solution causes an increase of I− concentration inducing the formation of a variety of lead poly-iodide species with different degrees of coordination (i.e. PbI3−, PbI42−, PbI53− and PbI64−). To investigate the capability of HI and NH4I additives to efficiently coordinate PbI2, we evaluate the formation of poly-iodide complexes through UV-Vis spectroscopy. We consider two different precursor concentrations, which are 25 mM and 150 μM, with the aim to evaluate the possible effects imputable to the concentration regimes. As recently reported, concentrated MAI/PbI2 blends (typically above 1 mM) behave as a colloidal dispersion while concentrations lower than 1 mM show a solution behaviour, due to a better dissolution of PbI2 species.19 The different nature of precursor solutions at the two concentrations is clearly reflected in absorption features. Fig. 1 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the precursor solutions prepared at a concentration of 25 mM and 150 μM, in which incremental amounts of either HI or NH4I are added.
 Fig. 1  (a and b) Absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor colloidal solutions (25 mM) with increasing amounts of HI and NH4I additives, and (c) additive concentration dependence of the absorption band edge red-shift; (d and e) absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor with real solution behaviour (150 μM) with increasing amounts of HI and NH4I additives, and (f) additive concentration dependence of the change in absorbance monitored at 370 nm and 425 nm. 
The 25 mM solution shows a plateau extended in a wide spectral range, resulting from the overlapping of the absorption bands of several coordination complexes (Fig. 1a and b). We observe that, although CH3NH3I partially forms complexes with PbI2, the addition of HI or NH4I causes a red-shift of the absorption band-edge of pure precursors, which is located at about 400 nm, indicating the further formation of coordination compounds in the solutions. In both cases, we found a red-shift of about 50 nm (Fig. 1a and b), however it is evident from the plot of the absorption plateau offset versus additive molar concentration (see Fig. 1c) that HI is more efficient in the generation of coordination complexes. Since at such a high 25 mM concentration, specific absorption features of possible coordination complexes cannot be isolated and thus specific lead poly-iodine species cannot be identified, the effect of HI and NH4I has been investigated also in a precursor solution at a concentration of 150 μM. By reducing the precursor concentration we can observe a transition from the plateau (Fig. 1a and b) to well-defined absorption bands in the range of 350–450 nm (Fig. 1d and e). Such absorption features are picked at 370 and 425 nm and are ascribed to PbI3− and PbI4− species, respectively.32 The intensity of both the peaks increases by adding incremental amounts of iodide additives, but the growth of the peak at 370 nm is faster than the one at 425 nm. This is due to the distribution of the starting PbI2 between the PbI3− and PbI4− complexes and the existing equilibrium between them:PbI2 + I− ⇄ PbI3− and PbI3− + I− ⇄ PbI42−
In Fig. 1f we plot the intensity of the two absorption bands versus the mM concentration of the HI and NH4I in the dilute precursor solutions. It can be readily observed that the increment of the two peaks is steeper for HI compared to NH4I since, in agreement with what we have already observed for the concentrated colloidal solutions (25 mM), HI coordinates PbI2 more efficiently than NH4I. In addition, also in dilute solutions NH4I does not reach the same level of lead complexation mediated by HI, even at higher NH4I loading. The different behaviour of the two iodide additives to form complexes with PbI2 can be related to the availability of I− ions and thus to the relative degree of dissociation of the additive itself in the solution. Given the strong acidic nature of HI, the available I− concentration is higher compared to NH4I, and the formation of poly-iodide species is more efficient. These results demonstrate that the choice of iodine source plays a critical role in the coordination of PbI2, which is strongly affected by the effective availability of iodide, thus the acidity of the additive.
We evaluate the effect of lead complexation on the size of colloids by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis to verify the size distribution of the soft coordination complexes in the precursor solutions. In Fig. S1† we report the statistical distribution of the measured hydrodynamic diameter (Dh). From this analysis we could estimate the presence and the dimension of aggregates both in the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite precursors and in the presence of either HI or NH4I, which confirm the colloidal nature of the precursor solutions. However, we can observe a first clear difference between the size of aggregates in pristine perovskite precursors and upon the addition of HI or NH4I. The size distribution of colloidal complexes in pristine solution is peaked at about 250 nm while both HI and NH4I lead to a shift of the distribution peak toward a smaller dimension. The formation of smaller colloids could be attributed to the complexation of Pb2+ and therefore to a break-down of rod-shaped PbI2 structures. In the presence of HI it is possible to note the presence of two populations of aggregates, with sizes of about 6 nm and a less dense aggregate at 250 nm, the bigger size population of aggregates being comparable with the size of the pristine precursors. The NH4I shows uniformly distributed aggregates in solution with sizes of about 140 nm. Overall the PbI2 dissolution effect is much pronounced in HI than in NH4I, the size of the principal population of aggregates being smaller. This finding demonstrates that the complexation level of Pb2+ directly influences the dimension of the colloids in the starting precursor solution.
2.2 Morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films in the presence of iodide additives
Here we discuss the impact of the complexation degree and the size of colloids in the precursor mixture on perovskite film morphology. As expected, the raw spin-coating of an equimolar mixture of CH3NH3I and PbI2 in DMF solution leads to the formation of needle-like and discontinuous morphologies guided by the rod-shaped nucleation seeds of PbI2, which has a low solubility in DMF (see Fig. S2†). We select DMF as a solvent because, due to its lower polarity, it has a weaker coordination ability with PbI2 than dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO is known to form a stable Lewis base adduct MAI·PbI2·DMSO, resulting in a long-lasting intermediate phase during the self-assembly of the perovskite films. This intermediate phase slows down the solvent evaporation and increases the window to perform a two-step solvent dripping process,33 or to encourage the self-assembly packaging of perovskite grains in a double step deposition method.34 In our case, the formation of perovskite occurs through a completely different mechanism. The iodide precursors allow the disaggregation of PbI2 to form a smooth and homogeneous film morphology by single-step with no need of solvent dripping. In Fig. 2 we report the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of perovskite films obtained from precursor solutions containing 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 equivalents of HI or 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 equivalents of NH4I on PEDOT:PSS coated substrates. The additive/PbI2 ratios of 0.3/1 for HI and 0.8/1 for NH4I are selected because they result in the best-suited morphology for device integration (Fig. 2), for this reason the corresponding morphologies are also measured on flat TiO2 (Fig. S5a and b†). Notably, we found that a smaller amount of HI with respect to NH4I is needed (∼1/3) and we anticipate that this is likely due to the more efficient complexation of the HI additive (Fig. 1) (vide infra). The ratios of 0.15, 0.6 for HI/PbI2 and 0.4, 1.6 for NH4I/PbI2 are selected to maintain the HI/HN4I proportion (∼1/3) and to just vary the additive/PbI2 ratio. For completeness we also compare the NH4I at the same ratio used for HI, namely 0.3/1 (Fig. S5†).
 Fig. 2  SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 processed with the HI additive added at a HI/PbI2 molar ratio of (a) 0.15/1; (b) 0.3/1; (c) 0.6/1; and CH3NH3PbI3 films processed with the NH4I additive added at a NH4I /PbI2 molar ratio of (d) 0.4/1; (e) 0.8/1; (f) 1.6/1. All the perovskite films are deposited on glass/PEDOT:PSS substrates. Scale bar is 1 μm. 
Both films, with HI or NH4I, show the formation of a pure CH3NH3PbI3 phase as evidened by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. S3†). The broadening of the characteristic peaks is similar for the two additives. It is worth underlining that the average size of crystalline domains extrapolated from XRD cannot be directly correlated to the size morphological features observed by SEM. Indeed, the instrumental broadening limits the accessible size range, so that the XRD sensitivity to the crystallite size tends to reach saturation in our case for crystallites of ∼100 nm.16 Therefore, despite the similar broadening of the peaks for the two samples, the actual size could largely exceed this value, possibly reaching the size of the grains revealed by SEM inspection. SEM images show that HI and NH4I lead to different morphologies with an overall trend associated with the additive/PbI2 ratio. Indeed, with both HI and NH4I, the increasing amount of additives results in a better surface coverage and reduced grain sizes, which can be attributed to the formation of smaller colloids and disaggregation of PbI2 in the precursor mixture. It is worthy of note that the film prepared starting from a precursor solution having a HI/PbI2 molar ratio of 0.15/1 shows a discontinuous morphology with some needle-like domains composed of smaller grains of approximately 100 nm possibly due to residual rod-shaped PbI2 seeds (Fig. 2a). Upon increasing the ratio between the HI additive and PbI2 (i.e. 0.3/1 and 0.6/1) the films become uniform and evenly covered. Furthermore, the incremental addition of HI to the precursor solution leads to a reduction of grain size from approximately 200 nm to 150 nm (Fig. 2b and c). This is consistent with the observation that the increasing amount of additives determines the high level of lead complexation, which results in the dissolution of the colloidal PbI2 framework in solution. Similarly, films prepared from a precursor solution with the NH4I/PbI2 ratio 0.4/1 show micron sized island-like polycrystalline domains and poor surface coverage (Fig. 2d); the same behaviour can be observed for the NH4I/PbI2 ratio of 0.3/1 albeit with larger voids (Fig. S6c and d†). Increasing the NH4I/PbI2 ratio (i.e. 0.8/1) we observe a good substrate coverage and the formation of grains with an average dimension of around 400 nm (Fig. 2e). A further increase in additive concentration evolves into smaller grain morphology along with the formation of domains with not well-defined features (Fig. 2f), probably caused by the excess of NH4I, which at such a concentration strongly affects the crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3. Overall, we can observe that, independently of the additive concentration, the inclusion of NH4I induces the formation of larger grain sizes compared to HI.
It is worth underlining that the one-step solution deposition protocols have been optimized for device integration for each additive. For instance HI leads to a uniform and smooth film by simply spin-casting the solution for a long dwell time (200 s), as reported in the literature,22 while the precursor solution with NH4I must be deposited on a pre-heated hot substrate (100 °C) in order to enhance the perovskite nucleation process. It is possible that the crystallization process of perovskites with NH4I is slower than HI, needing a hot-substrate to accelerate the perovskite formation. In this regard, a very recent report35 demonstrates that the rapid crystallization of metal halide perovskites is strictly related to the dissolution of colloids, which increases the concentration of solute species up to supersaturation and triggers the crystallization. Therefore, the efficient disaggregation and complexation of PbI2 by the HI additive is likely to improve itself the supersaturation leading to a rapid crystallization into small and uniformly distributed perovskite polycrystals, regardless of the hot-substrates. Contrarily, the NH4I additive is less efficient in forming poly-iodide complexes with PbI2, resulting in larger PbI2 seeds. Consequently, in order to obtain a well-covered morphology the cooperative effect of NH4I and temperature is needed. The temperature here could induce a further dissolution of the colloids and improve the supersaturation, thus the perovskite crystallization.
Furthermore, despite the fact that both films became brownish during the spin-coating step, suggesting that perovskites are already formed during the deposition process, perovskites prepared with NH4I require a long annealing step at 110 °C to remove any residual additive. Films annealed for less than 100 minutes rapidly become nearly transparent when exposed to air moisture, revealing the presence of a large excess of ammonium component, which leads to the formation of a perovskite hydrate phase (Fig. S4†).36,37 In order to exclude that the increased grain size is due to the adopted deposition methods, we process a solution containing HI under the same conditions of NH4I, namely on hot-substrates (Fig. S6†). Despite the fact that such a film shows grain sizes of ∼250 nm, which are larger than those observed when the standard protocol for HI is used, these grains are still far smaller than the ones obtained with NH4I, underlining the tendency of NH4I to form perovskites with larger grains.
Considering these pieces of evidence, we can confirm that differences in the average grain size are related not only to the additive/PbI2 ratio but also to the capability of complexation of the two additives. The low level of lead complexation, as in the case of NH4I or low concentration of the additive, is associated with larger grains while better lead complexation, as in the case of HI or an increasing amount of additive, results in the formation of smaller grains and smoother perovskite morphology with a roughness of ∼10 nm (see Fig. S7†). The variation in film morphology can be explained with the capability of halide additives to improve the solubility of PbI2 through the formation of poly-iodide complexes. If lead iodide is not well dissolved, as in the case of the pristine binary precursor mixture, the growth process consists of an in situ templated transformation through the intercalation of CH3NH3I in the PbI2 crystals (see Fig. 3).38 Thus, the final CH3NH3PbI3 morphology maintains the structure of the inorganic PbI2 framework with a needle-like structure, typical of PbI2 crystals. On the other hand, halide additives break down the inorganic PbI2 framework through lead complexation19 and the small lead poly-iodide complexes act as building blocks for re-crystallization with CH3NH3I (Fig. 3). Therefore, the dimension of the lead poly-iodide complexes guides the grain size of the final CH3NH3PbI3, as also corroborated by DLS analysis. HI allows a higher lead complexation and, as a result, CH3NH3I grain sizes are smaller than the ones obtained with NH4I. From the above consideration, we can conclude that the morphology of the CH3NH3I films can be efficiently mastered by controlling the complexation of PbI2 through the amount and type of iodide additive.
 Fig. 3  Simplified sketch of the two possible perovskite formation mechanisms: the templated transformation, occurring without the use of additives, and the disaggregation–crystallization assisted by iodide additives. The two mechanisms result in completely different perovskite morphologies. 
Comparing the optimized morphology of HI and NH4I on PEDOT:PSS and planar TiO2 coated substrates (Fig. 2b, e and S5a, b†) a further very simple but important conclusion can be drawn: in the presence of iodide additives the film morphology is guided by the presence of the additive rather than by the flat substrate. This corroborate the determining role of iodide additives and in-solution complexation to act on the perovskite self-assembly formation.
2.3 Device performance
To evaluate the effect of iodide additive complexation on devices, we fabricate planar p-i-n heterojunction CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells in both inverted and standard architectures.
The devices consist of a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film between p- and n-type transporting layers, which are PEDOT:PSS and PCBM, for inverted, and Spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2 for the standard solar cells. For device fabrication, we use the additive/PbI2 ratio giving a smooth and uniform film, which is of 0.3/1 and 0.8/1 for HI (HI-CH3NH3PbI3) and NH4I (NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3), respectively (see the Experimental section for further details). The resulting films have comparable thicknesses and mirror-like surfaces (Fig. S8†). The morphologies of HI-CH3NH3PbI3 and NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 on the two different planar substrates are comparable (Fig. 2b–e and S5a and b†). We show the relative current–voltage (J–V) curves in Fig. 4 and summarize the solar cell performance in Table 1. The relative dark J–V curves are reported in Fig. S9.† Despite the improved morphology (Fig. 2b and e), only HI-CH3NH3PbI3 in the inverted configuration shows good photovoltaic performance with a Jsc of 21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.93 V, and a FF of 0.75, leading to a PCE of 14.7%, in line with previous reports.28 Contrarily, NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells show very poor performance with low Voc and FF, suggesting a high rate of recombination centres. Nevertheless, in the standard configuration both HI and NH4I additives lead to comparable device performance reaching a PCE of 11.8% and 11.4%, respectively, suggesting comparable quality, albeit with very different grain sizes, of both CH3NH3PbI3 films (Fig. 4b and Table 1).

The morphologies of NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 on either PEDOT:PSS or TiO2 being very similar (Fig. 2e and S5b†), such a huge difference in the performance of NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 in the inverted and standard configurations cannot be explained in terms of roughness or grain sizes. The only difference between the inverted and standard configurations consists of a post-fabrication device ambient atmosphere exposure step, which we have performed for the two perovskites HI-CH3NH3PbI3 and NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 before TiO2 standard solar cell characterization. Indeed, unlike devices with the inverted configuration, standard devices (with TiO2) are exposed to the ambient atmosphere following a standard protocol to improve the conductivity of the Spiro-OMeTAD hole transporting layer, inevitably exposing the CH3NH3PbI3 layer to air as well. According to the literature, air exposure of the perovskite material could have an effect of defect curing on the CH3NH3PbI3 film mediated by oxygen and moisture.39–41 Comparing the HI-CH3NH3PbI3 and NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 with our standard 1 M CH3NH3PbI3 fabrication method without additives, namely a modified solvent dripping approach,42 in which we have obtained a PCE of ∼9.4% on PEDOT:PSS18 and ∼10.9% on TiO2,16 the use of HI seems to be beneficial in particular in the inverted device configuration. No significant differences can be observed in the conventional device architecture with TiO2. It is worth noting that device performances for the two additives, contrarily to what is expected from the literature, cannot be straightforwardly correlated to the perovskite grain size. Commonly, larger grains ensure an enhanced carrier mobility, longer diffusion length and higher device efficiency.43 In our case, however device performance seems to correlate more to air exposure and therefore to the device architecture rather than the dimension of grains, suggesting that the use of HI and NH4I results in perovskites with a different optoelectronic quality, which finally determines the efficiency of charge collection and solar cell devices.
To better assess the evolution of the perovskite film in time during air exposure and the differences between the films prepared from the solution containing the two diverse additives, we performed time resolved photoluminescence investigation (TRPL). In order to reproduce the conditions of the photovoltaic tests where the whole devices were exposed to the air atmosphere and to avoid at the same time perovskite degradation, we studied with TRPL perovskite films deposited on glass and covered by poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The PMMA layer protects the perovskite film as the Spiro-OMeTAD does in the complete device and concomitantly does not quench the perovskite luminescence. In Fig. S10† are reported the PL decays obtained on different days while storing the samples in air and in the dark. Both films show very short luminescence decays on the first day of measurements. Afterwards the two films follow a different trend, HI-CH3NH3PbI3 films reach long-living luminescent conditions in a shorter time interval, after five days, in fact, the decay is bi-exponential with τ1 = 20 ns and τ2 = 120 ns and after 21 days the film shows a long mono-exponential decay of about 490 ns. This directly proves a faster positive evolution of HI-CH3NH3PbI3 for an effective photovoltaic response.4 Differently, NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 shows a slower evolution; after 5 days the bi-exponential decay is τ1 = 1.5 ns and τ2 = 44 ns and after 21 days the mono-exponential decay is of about 230 ns. Noticeably this behaviour differs from what we usually observed, in fact after exposure, the PL decay times for HI-CH3NH3PbI3 and NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 are longer compared to our standard 1 M CH3NH3PbI3,16 which is shorter, double exponential and above all invariant under light-soaking or aging (storage in the dark). The difference has to be related to the presence of additives, which having an impact on the material growth, influence its maturation. Importantly, it has already been shown how ambient atmosphere exposure could have an influence on perovskites as efficient luminescent materials.44 Among the phenomena that could cause the time dependent PL evolution and justify the differences observed between the investigated films, the main factor active here could be the oxygen/moisture mediated curing of the defects.39 We comment on such results as an indication of a higher density of halide vacancy in the NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 films caused by a less efficient lead passivation in the crystallization step. These findings nicely agree with the enhanced FF and Voc observed for both HI-CH3NH3PbI3 and NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 based devices in the standard configuration upon ambient atmosphere exposure with time (Fig. S11†). Furthermore, the different dimension of the CH3NH3PbI3 grain in HI and NH4I processed CH3NH3PbI3 could potentially influence the timing of the curing process as well. The smaller dimension of the HI-CH3NH3PbI3 grains, indeed, could allow a faster diffusion of oxygen and moisture across the single grain, while the larger poly-crystals of NH4I-CH3NH3PbI3 require a longer time of exposure. However, such considerations do not explain the efficiency reached without air exposure in inverted devices for HI-CH3NH3PbI3. Therefore, these results suggest that when HI is introduced as an additive into the perovskite precursor solutions, it allows the formation of films with much lower halide vacancies with respect to the corresponding films fabricated by using NH4I.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the role of iodide additives in perovskite film growth. Iodide additives act in the solution-phase through the complexation of PbI2 and the formation of poly-iodide species that serve as small nucleation seeds for the growth of uniform and smooth perovskite films. The availability of the iodide ions, which depends on the additive type and concentration, directly influences the degree of complexation of PbI2 and the dimension of the starting nuclei, which determine the dimension of the growing crystals. As a result, additives that efficiently coordinate PbI2, as in the case of HI, lead to perovskite films with smaller grains, while additives that do not ensure an efficient degree of complexation, as for NH4I, determine the formation of enlarged grains. Furthermore, it has been found that iodide additives critically determine not only the morphology but also the density of defect states of the final perovskite films influencing the stoichiometry of the precursor solutions. As a consequence, a higher degree of PbI2 complexation, leads to a lower density of trap states and vice versa. These results are crucial for the understanding of the role of additives in the perovskite film growth enabling a proper exploitation of iodide additives as tools for the modulation of morphology and uniformity of the perovskite layers as well as for the growth of perovskite films with a reduced density of defect states.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 solution
CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution is prepared by mixing an equimolar ratio of CH3NH3I (Dyesol) and PbI2 (ultra-dry 99.999% (metals basis), from Alfa Aesar) in N,N-dimethylformamide, and then heating at 60 °C until complete dissolution of precursors. The solution is filtered through a 0.2 μm GHP filter and the additive HI (57% in water, Aldrich) or NH4I (99% Aldrich) is added. The concentration of precursors is 40 wt% and 20 wt% for HI and NH4I respectively. Such concentrations have been selected in order to have similar film thicknesses with HI and NH4I. For optical characterization, we use a 25 mM and 150 μM CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution in DMF added with HI or NH4I. For morphological characterization, precursor solutions are prepared at the same concentration of solutions used for device fabrication.
4.2 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements
A ZetasizerNano ZS90 (Malvern, USA) equipped with a 4.0 mW He–Ne laser operating at 633 nm and an Avalanche photodiode detector was used. Measurements were performed in low-volume disposable cuvettes kept at 25 °C. Typical concentrations: 1 wt% in DMF solvent.
4.3 Device fabrication and characterization
To fabricate a device with the standard configuration, a 90 nm thick TiO2 compact layer is deposited on a cleaned FTO/glass substrates (Pilkington, TEC15) by spin-coating (3000 rpm) a double layer of 0.15 M and a final layer of 0.3 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% Aldrich) in 1-butanol (Aldrich). Between each layer a mild annealing step (125 °C for 5 min) is performed. Finally, the TiO2 coated FTO glasses are heated at 550 °C for 2 hours. The CH3NH3PbI3 solution with additives is spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 200 s, in the case of HI, and at 7000 rpm for 30 s on a preheated (100 °C) substrate for NH4I. The films are then annealed at 100 °C for 2 min (HI) or 110 °C for 100 min (NH4I). Then, a Spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene solution (63 mg per 1 mL) added with 29 μl tert-butylpyridine and 41 μl lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide salt/1-butanol (170 mg per 1 mL) is spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Solar cell devices are completed by thermal evaporation of 100 nm Au electrodes.
For the inverted device configuration a 40 nm poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P 4083, filtered through a 0,45 μm PTFE filter) thick layer is spin-coated on a cleaned In-doped SnO2 (ITO) glass substrate (Visiontek) at 3000 rpm for 60 s and heated at 150 °C for 15 min. Then, the CH3NH3PbI3 solution with additives are spin-casted and annealed following the same protocols described earlier. Finally, the PC61BM solution (25 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) is deposited by spin coating at 1000 rpm for 30 s. LiF (0,6 nm) and Al (150 nm) electrodes are deposited by thermal evaporation. The current–voltage characteristics are determined using an Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (Spectra Physics Oriel150 W) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter. The step voltage is fixed at 10 mV and the delay time to 100 ms.
4.4 UV-Vis absorption, morphological and structural characterization
The absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solutions are recorded with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. For the UV-vis NIR measurement we use 1 mm length-path cuvettes.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging is performed by using a MERLIN Zeiss SEM FEG instrument at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV using an In-lens detector.
The XRD spectra of the prepared films were recorded with a PANalytical X'Pert-PRO Materials Research Diffractometer using graphite-monochromated CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å).
4.5 Time-correlated single photon counting
Time resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed using time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) apparatus of Hamamatsu FL980, 100 ps time resolution with deconvolution analysis.
