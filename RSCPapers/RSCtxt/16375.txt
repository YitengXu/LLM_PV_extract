, Accepted 23rd February 2015First published on 24th February 2015AbstractReagent-free nanostructure synthesis provides an additional dimension for green chemistry, significantly reducing chemical contamination of the environment and indirectly reducing damage to human health. Photon-generated free reactive electrons can initialize many chemical reactions without the presence of reducing agents, giving rise to clean synthetic routes. In this study, we directly synthesized silver dendroid structures on a wide bandgap GaN epitaxial thin film, which produces vast numbers of reductive electrons under continuous UV-irradiation. Uniform spheroidal nanocubes first developed on the planar GaN surface, then grew into Ag dendrites with hyperbranches. The silver crystals are interwoven and interpenetrate to give an intriguing fern texture, which doubles in role as an optical enhancer and catalytic site for many chemical reactions. In this way, a multifunctional GaN substrate is developed using a facile, green and photochemical approach, on which catalytic reactions, and simultaneously high quality SERS measurements can be performed with considerable sensitivity. Thereby, this hybrid material is exploited to reveal detailed chemical insight into liquid/solid interfaces without additional modification, well-balancing the economic and technical needs.
Gallium nitride (GaN) is a compelling semiconductor with a wide bandgap, ∼3.4 eV, which is essentially important in the development of blue/green light emitting devices,1,2 high power electronics,3 microelectromechanical systems, high-speed transistors4 and solar cells.5 Moreover, high quality epitaxial GaN films, followed by simple chemical etching, have an exquisite nanoporous architecture, and have been extensively applied in optoelectronics, chemical/biochemical sensors and matrices for desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.6–8 The new research direction recently has been exploited for the supplemental functionality of GaN in photochemical water splitting,9 pollutant degradation and next-generation electronic/photonic GaN devices,10 because of its excellent thermal, chemical and optical properties. Relative to its counterparts, GaN, serving as a supporting scaffold for catalysts, possesses intrinsic chemical inertness against extremely harsh reaction conditions, particularly strongly basic and acidic solutions.11
One of the potential applications of GaN is as a photoanode for the reduction reaction of metal ions by rendering reductive surface electrons, from which a variety of delicate nanostructures are directly generated on a substrate, without the presence of any chemical reagent or surfactant. It thereby provides an alternative green approach for nanoparticle synthesis, friendly to the environment and human health.12 In theory, a wide straddling band provides reductive potential alignment to most redox pairs, including hydrogen generation directly from water. Particularly under continuous UV-irradiation, photoelectrons constantly move to the conduction band and facilitate the chemical process, giving rise to diverse nanostructures in a relatively clean and large-scale manner.13,14 This hybrid composite possesses many advanced attributes with regard to light scattering, absorption and emission in ways that are not available to either material applied in isolation. For example, a Pt–GaN Schottky diode provides an ultra-sensitive response for hydrogen sensing, with which an order of magnitude improved sensitivity was observed.15 Ag nanoparticle decorated GaN can significantly amplify spontaneous emission rates on GaN-based LEDs.16–18 Moreover, the InGaN/GaN quantum well enhances electron transfer rate, improving photocurrent harvest efficiency in GaN solar cells.19 Coating GaN with fine metal nanostructures enables the light absorption and scattering to be precisely tuned. This makes this hybrid system an ideal SERS substrate, as well as a provider of catalytically active sites due to highly reactive surfaces. In addition, the intrinsic chemical inertness and mechanical strength mean that it can provide high quality support for catalysts, even under harsh conditions, where other alternatives become questionable. Though many methods have been developed for the synthesis of branched metal nanostructures using seed-mediated reactions20 (CTAB, ascorbic acid,21 polyvinylpyrrolidone,22 tris-base(TB),23 dopamine24), they are in a way limited by the principles of fluid dynamics. It is often a challenge to accurately position products inside the minute apertures, such as nanopores. Direct on-chip synthesis certainly renders an additional dimension to well-disperse active sites throughout supporting surfaces, especially, within tiny compartments. In addition, reducing agents cause unexpected contamination of the resulting nanostructures, adversely impacting the performance of SERS detection and catalytic reactions. Previously, electroless deposition was employed to fabricate nanoparticles in the interior walls of micropores. However, this approach often involved reducing agents and loaded surfactants to moisturize solid surfaces, which was costly and harmful to the environment.
In this study, our aim was to develop a reliable SERS-active GaN substrate using a reagent-free photochemical approach that involves minimal synthesis procedure and few devices. Photon-generated electrons facilitate metal reduction at the solid/liquid interface, gradually ossifying to a dendroid nanostructure, the composition of which was experimentally confirmed by surface based MS analysis (cf. Fig. S3†). Our method starts with an n-type GaN thin film deposited on a sapphire wafer, approximately 8 μm in thickness with a carrier concentration of 4 × 1018 cm−3. Each wafer was cut into 10 mm × 10 mm square pieces and degreased consecutively in a bath of acetone, ethanol and water. The native oxidation products were removed using 1 M hydrofluoric acid in a small plastic container, followed by copious rinsing with DI-water. A drop of aqueous solution of 10 mM AgNO3 (or 10 mM AuCl4−, in a separate case) was cast on a planar GaN substrate. A 20 W low-pressure mercury lamp (Oriel Instruments Model 6182, Oriel Instruments 68806 power supply) was employed as a UV-source for irradiation right above the GaN slide for 3–10 min to produce rugged metal nanostructures.
A dendritic growth mechanism is proposed and briefly depicted in Scheme 1. First, free electrons on the GaN surface react with aqueous silver ions, consolidating them into the indiscernible nucleation. This is because the reduction potential of the Ag+/Ag pair (0.799 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) is below the GaN valance band. At the solid/liquid interface, conduction and valance bands in GaN (bandgap ∼ 3.4 eV) split to −0.875 eV and 2.525 eV vs. SHE respectively. In the formation of surface electric field, the density of free electrons, ns, is governed by eqn (1): 
(1)where n0 = 4 × 1018 cm−3 for an n-type GaN crystal and ϕse represents the surface potential derived from band bending. Hence, surface electrons become very reductive, the potential of which is much lower than the Ag+/Ag pair, which induces galvanic replacement. This facilitates the nucleation process at the solid/liquid interface. Having depleted the surface electrons, further growth of the Ag structure relies on continuous pumping of electrons out of the conduction band. Noted by the Gerischer model,25 a UV-photon (wavelength < 360 nm) is totally absorbed by the GaN lattice and generates an electron–hole pair, elevating the Fermi level and pouring electrons into the solid/liquid interfaces for dendroid growth.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of the Ag dendrite growing process on a GaN substrate under UV-irradiation. 
Fig. 1 shows the resulting Ag (and Au) dendroid structures profiled by SEM, where hyperbranched “needle” crystals are observed in a variety of forms, ranging from a “tree-like” spike to a nanoflower. In Ag deposition, typically, dendrites grow slowly and gradually, complying with the model of diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA).26 Under UV-irradiation, sufficient electrons with high reactivity are driven to conduction bands and migrate to the interface. Hence, the growth rate virtually relies on a random walk of aqueous ions, driven by Brownian motion, when they approach solid Ag nuclei. It first developed polyhedral or “rock-like” Ag nanocubes, in accordance with the Volmer–Weber model,27 producing a large number of well-dispersed 3D islands throughout the substrate, as outlined in Fig. 1A. The surface number density of Ag NPs is approximately 5 × 107 cm−2. By high magnification SEM image, i.e. Fig. 2B, the singlet cube is observed with short branched nanowires on jagged rectangles, maybe because the sharp edge region is more reactive, relative to the plain substrate. The wires gradually bifurcated and branched to a dendroid structure with the aid of sufficient surface electrons. A series of SEM micrographs in Fig. 2, briefly illustrate this chemical process and morphologic development. The synthesized wires were considered to be many nanometric electrodes, on which electron transfer was favored compared to a planar GaN surface. It thereby produces the oriented crystal growth along the tip and forms a hyperbranched fern structure. Virtually, the rate of crystal growth is determined by molecule diffusion based on a random-walk mechanism. The backbone of the dendrites reaches approximately 3 to 5 μm in length with multiple branches consisting of ∼200 nm-in-length projections. These interpenetrated crystals render considerable roughness, a vast surface area and, most importantly, vast nanogaps, which provide additional portion for optical enhancement. Finally, the composition of the resulting dendrites was verified by surface-based mass analysis, since GaN and Ag grains both can serve as an excellent matrix for laser-induced ionization mass spectrometry.6 Fig. S1† shows the results from surface MS analysis, where the Ag element is identified and verified by the presence of Ag+ cluster ions with unique isotopic patterns (singlet m/z 107/109, doublet m/z 214/216/218, triplet m/z 321/323/325/327) and combined AgnGam+ adducts. On the other hand, gold nanoparticles formed a coral-like nanoflower, in accordance with the results from solution-based synthesis.28 Rather than the formation of tree ferns, dendroid gold seemingly assembled to hair-ball structures, illustrated in Fig. 1C (low magnification) and Fig. 1D (zoom-in image) with approximately 50 to 250 nm crystal tips. The possible development of Au NPs is likely following the Volmer–Weber mechanism, in which the crystal growth is mediated by the delicate equilibrium buildup of gold nanoparticles. The continuous growth relies on AuCl− ion migration and diffusion, which generates dendritic nanocrystals, randomly positioned around a spherical core. Numerous crystal tips radiate from the center and form a flower-like structure, giving rise to disorderly nanoscale roughness and immense surface area. The former is responsible for Raman enhancement, while the latter counts for widespread catalytic sites over many chemical reactions. To corroborate SERS activity, the heterogeneous GaN chip was incubated in a 100 μM ethanolic 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) solution, which forms a self-assembled layer through strong Ag–S interactions. In addition, a drop of 1 pmol Rhodamine 6G (R6G) was directly deposited on the hybrid system prepared for SERS detection. Each optical spectrum was acquired in the range of 500–1400 cm−1 with a 10 s integration time. Presumably, the SERS-active sites are considered to be the interpenetrated branches, especially the apex of crystal tips and overlapped nano-needles.

Fig. 3 shows Raman spectra with substantial intensity and great band resolution. In the resulting spectra from 4-ATP and Rhodamine 6G, vibration bands caused by aromatic rings and associated substituents are facile to discern. The peak near 585 cm−1 corresponds to natural GaN; briefly, the dominant peak near 1587 cm−1 represents the a1 ring breathing mode. Two other bands at 1439 and 1394 cm−1 are b2 vibrational modes that result from the Ag–S interaction and which have been implicated in the charge transfer (CT) mechanism for optical enhancement. In another study, characteristic R6G bands at 612 cm−1, 774 cm−1, 1182 cm−1 and 1364 cm−1 appear and are easily distinguished from the background. The intensities of the two Raman peaks at 612 and 774 cm−1 were assigned to the C–C ring in-plane vibration and the C–H out-of-plane bending mode. The presence of surface-bounded analyte was further confirmed experimentally by LDI-MS analysis, as illustrated in Fig. S1(b).† The mass-deficit molecular ion, [ATP − H]+ (m/z 124.1) was detected directly on the hybrid substrate without the additional aid of matrix, because GaN and Ag nanoparticles themselves both serve as alternative matrices for low weight molecules (<1000 Da). The underlying mechanism of special gaseous ion formation was explained in our previous study.29

Silver dendrites double in role as catalytic active sites and optical enhancers, which is further demonstrated by a simple chemical approach, in which the starting material and product exhibit a substantial distinction with regard to chemical affinity on metal surfaces. SERS detection reflects and intensifies this discrepancy, because immense optical enhancement often originates from the first-layer analyte on a plasmonic network. The analyte that was refractory to coinage metal surfaces produced negligible signal enhancement, which renders the opportunity of monitoring a dynamic catalytic reaction using in situ SERS measurements. A drop of aqueous solution containing 100 μm 4-NP and 5 mM BH4− was cast on a GaN chip and was covered with a glass slide to prevent the liquid evaporating during the reaction. Fig. 4 shows the resulting series of Raman spectra, reflecting the progress of the catalytic reaction. Initially, 4-NP exhibits a deep yellow color and remains unaltered for quite a long time without the presence of a nanostructured catalyst. In this particular case, product (4-AP) exhibits more chemical affinity to the Ag nanostructure than any other starting reactants. Therefore, a semi-quantitative analysis of products is performed by SERS with minimal interference from reactants. The resulting SERS signal reflects only the Raman fingerprint of the product, as an amine substituent is apt to chemically absorb on the Ag dendrite. Conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP is facilitated by dendrites on GaN, giving rise to gradually increased Raman signals. Raman intensity finally remains unaltered at 5 min, suggesting the full consumption of reactant and a near 100% molecular conversion rate. The kinetic study, despite more equivocal quantification in comparison with UV-vis absorbance spectra, shows a clear trend of accumulated products on SERS-active “hotspots”. Fig. S2† illustrates the dependence trace of Raman intensity of signature peaks at 850 cm−1, 1600 cm−1 and 1240 cm−1 upon the course of reaction, subject to subtraction of background. A parallel experiment using UV-extinction spectroscopy was performed on an identical dendrite-coated GaN substrate. As described in Fig. S3,† the extinction peak near 400 nm, which represents the absorption of 4-NP, gradually decreased to background level, in accordance with SERS measurements in a temporal fashion. Therefore, the “one-pot” dendrite fabrication on GaN surfaces provides an excellent candidate for the integration of a nanostructured catalyst and in situ SERS detection, particularly for those reactions under harsh conditions. Meanwhile, the simplest route for chemical synthesis renders the great potential for large-scale manufacture, well-balancing technical and economic needs.
