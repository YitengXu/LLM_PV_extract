    , Accepted 29th June 2021First published on 22nd July 2021AbstractIn this work we have synthesized Mn doped GdFeO3 nano-particles using a green and facile sol gel method and studied their photocatalytic, optical, vibrational and electrical properties. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD profiles suggests that all the materials have an orthorhombic Pbnm crystal structure. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show the decrease of the average particle size from 140 to 80 nm with the Mn concentration. The high crystallinity of the synthesized particles is confirmed from the HR-TEM images. Raman spectrum is employed to investigate the phonon modes of the materials. The optical band gap of the materials is obtained from the UV-vis reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) using Tauc relation which indicates the reduction of the band gap from 2.18 to 1.72 eV with Mn-doping. The photocatalytic activity of the materials is studied by the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B (Rh-B) in aqueous solution under visible light illumination. The substitution of Mn at the Fe site introduces an extra electronic state between the conduction band and the valence band which reduces the electronic band gap and enhances the Rh-B degradation efficiency. A 30% Mn doping at the Fe site (GFMO3) provides an optimum space charge width which assists to attain the maximum rate of degradation of the Rh-B dye. The doping of Mn3+ reduces the photogenerated electron and hole recombination rate and hence more charge carriers take part in the redox reaction which facilitates the photo-catalytic efficiency in GFMO3. The degradation rate enhances by a factor of 2.5 for GFMO3 as compared to pure GdFeO3. The highest photocurrent density of 1.31 μA cm−2 of GFMO3 with respect to other materials promotes the separation and transfer of the photo generated charge carriers. The possible photocatalytic mechanism of the Mn doped GdFeO3 is also critically discussed. Alternating current impedance spectroscopy is used to study the electrical properties of the synthesized materials. The increase in the conductivity with the Mn concentration is explained on the basis of the band gap reduction and this is consistent with the Smit and Wijn theory. Magnetic measurement is performed to measure the magnetization strength which is useful to separate the photocatalyst by simply using a magnet. The temperature dependent magnetization measurement suggests the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) behaviour of the studied materials with the decrease of Néel temperature (TN) with Mn concentration. The XPS study reveals the presence of multiple oxidation states of Fe(2+/3+) and Mn(4+/3+) in these materials which facilitates the conductivity as well as the oxidation/reduction efficiency at the surface of the catalyst. The band gap reduction and its effect on the enhancement of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency with Mn doping are also discussed from the density of states calculations. Thus, this study describes a promising approach for the organic pollutant degradation by designing an efficient and stable perovskite photocatalyst.
I. Introduction
Environmental remediation has attracted our attention because of the expansion of the utilization of dyes in various industries like paints, leather, rubber, cosmetics, plastics, etc. The dyes discharged from these industries create environmental issues such as contamination of water, release of poisonous gases with unpleasant smell, etc. In this regard, solar light driven photocatalysis has been considered as an efficient, sustainable and eco-friendly way to degrade organic pollutants.1,2 Recently, the photocatalysis process has been extensively used to degrade organic dyes (such as methyl red, methyl orange, rhodamine B (Rh-B), thymol blue, and ethylene blue) in wastewater in an environmentally friendly green way.3,4
In the photocatalytic process, the photogenerated electrons and holes are formed by absorbing the high energy photons, where electrons are transferred to the conduction band (CB). Furthermore, the excited electrons and the holes are migrated to the surface of the catalyst for the reduction/oxidation reactions to occur. The excited electrons react with the adsorbed oxygen molecules on the surface to produce superoxide radicals (O2˙−), and the hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) are formed by the holes via reaction with the water molecules, which further reduce the organic compounds.5–10 Therefore, the efficiency of a photocatalyst depends on two factors: the efficient light absorption and the electron–hole separation.
Since the discovery of water photolysis in 1972 using TiO2 photocatalyst as the photoanode,11 oxide semiconductors have attracted numerous research interests in this field. Although TiO2 has been considered as a benchmark catalyst due to its high efficiency, nontoxicity and abundancy, its application is limited within the UV region because of the large bandgap (∼3.2 eV). Thus, research focus has been devoted to developing a low bandgap semiconductor catalyst which can absorb visible light consisting of 43% of the total solar spectrum.12 In this contest, the ABO3 type oxide semiconductors having a perovskite structure with corner sharing eight BO6 octahedra and 12 oxygen coordinated with A cations have received significant attention in photocatalysis due to their high crystal stability, tunability, suitable bandgap and band edge potentials.13,14 Depending on the ionic radii and the electro-negativity of the A and B site cations, the tilting of the octahedra takes place, which further influences the electronic and optical properties (via band structure), the electron and hole transport, the photoluminescence and the dielectric behaviour.15 An efficient catalyst can be designed with a suitable combination of A and B site cations. Therefore, perovskite oxides are widely used in various applications, like memory devices, sensors, supercapacitors, photovoltaics, and energy harvesting and thermoelectric applications.16–22 For example, the perovskite BiFeO3 is a well-known room temperature multiferroic material in which the ferroelectric and the anti-ferromagnetic properties exist simultaneously, which makes it attractive for the energy harvesting applications.23 On the other hand, SrTiO3 has shown an excellent photocatalytic activity in organic pollutant degradation because of its low band gap and high amount of oxygen vacancies.24,25 Recently, rare earth based orthoferrite perovskites like LaFeO3, SmFeO3, and GdFeO3 are gaining attention as photocatalysts due to their excellent photodegradation rate and photo-Fenton-like reaction.26–30 Hydroxyl radicals are produced on the surface of these photocatalysts by the Fenton oxidation reaction of Fe(II)/Fe(III) and hydrogen peroxide. The synergistic effect between the photocatalytic activity and the Fenton-like reaction may further accelerate the degradation rate of the pollutants.31 In this regard, gadolinium iron oxide, GdFeO3 (GFO), a prototype orthoferrite perovskite oxide belonging to the Pbnm space group family with a G-type magnet, has become an interesting material for the photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation.32–34 Moreover, GFO possesses a strong uniaxial anisotropy, and high coercivity and Faraday rotation, and is hugely used in terahertz sensors and magneto-optical data storage devices because of its interesting electrical and magnetic properties.35,36
It is well known that the fast recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes for these perovskite semiconductors reduces the catalytic activity.37–42 Up to now, various strategies, such as surface engineering, crystal facet engineering, doping, morphology tuning, coupling with other materials, heterostructure formation etc. have been used to overcome the issues of large bandgap as well as fast recombination.43–47 Among these, doping is one of the effective ways to tune the band gap of a semiconductor by introducing an extra electronic state.48,49 For example, Bhat and his co-workers48 have developed Rh-doped BaTiO3 by one pot hydrothermal method and demonstrated that 0.5 mol% Rh-doping at the Ba-site leads to a decrease in the band gap due to the appearance of donor Rh3+ states and consequently enhances the degradation of methylene blue (96%) within 120 mins under visible light irradiation.48 Ma et al.50 have reported that the doping of transition metals (Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Rh) in the SrTiO3 lattice effectively reduces the band gap and enhances the visible light absorption ability with improved photocatalytic H2 evolution from water. Bantawala et al.51 have shown the role of atomic ratio variation of Sr and Ti in the case of SrTiO3 for the organic pollutant methylene blue degradation. Very recently, they have prepared SrTiO3 nanocubes and modified them by partial V-doping at the Ti-site to introduce a dopant state near the CB, which reduces the fast recombination rate by acting as an electron trap centre.52 Lu et al.53 have modified the perovskites ATiO3 (A = Ca, Sr, Br) by co-doping La at the A-site and Cr at the Ti-site to make them active for H2 generation through the water reduction under visible light illumination. Furthermore, structure dependent photocatalytic activity has been shown by Lv et al.54 for the Ni-doped double perovskite A2InTaO6 (A = Sr or Ba). They have demonstrated that Ni-doping has generated an additional spin-polarized band of In(Ni)–O–Ta inside the intrinsic band gap of the perovskite semiconductors which effectively reduces the band-gap and improves the metal–oxygen–metal interaction. Abdi et al.55 have also reported effective longer wavelength light absorption and 19-times greater photocatalytic activity of La–Fe co-doped SrTiO3 perovskite for organic pollutant degradation.
It is to be mentioned that many studies have been reported on the photocatalytic degradation of different pollutants (like rhodamine-B, methyl orange etc.) by GdFeO3 and its composites with other materials.56–62 Inspired by the crystal engineering technique, we have tried to tune the band gap of GFO by adding Mn at the Fe-site to enhance its visible light photocatalytic performance. In this work, the effect of partial substitution of Fe by Mn in GFO has been studied towards the optical, electrical, magnetic, electrochemical and photocatalytic performance; a 30% doped material, GdFe0.7Mn0.3O3, has shown maximum photocatalytic degradation efficiency for rhodamine-B (Rh-B) under visible light irradiation. A complete degradation of Rh-B is achieved by GdFe0.7Mn0.3O3 in only 25 min. Thus with respect to the previous studies, GdFe0.7Mn0.3O3 is more promising to be used as a photocatalytic material for the degradation of organic pollutant under visible light irradiation in a very short time. Finally an effort has been made to establish a correlation between the photocatalytic and the electrical properties. The X-ray photoemission spectroscopic (XPS) study has also been performed to find out the oxidation state of the cations in the materials. The band gap reduction with Mn doping is also discussed from the density of states calculations.
II. Experimental section
A. Synthesis of Mn doped GdFeO3
The GdFeO3 (GFO), GdFe0.9Mn0.1O3 (GFMO1), and GdFe0.7Mn0.3O3 (GFMO3) nano-crystals were synthesized by a low cost sol–gel method.63 The Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Loba Chemie, 98%) and Mn(NO3)2·4H2O (Merck, 98.5%) were taken according to the stoichiometry ratio and dissolved in the deionized water separately. After this, the solutions were mixed together and stirred vigorously using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min to form a stable and transparent solution. Citric acid was taken according to the 1:1 ratio with the metal nitrates and dissolved in deionized water. The citric acid solution was added to the previously mixed solution of metal nitrates. Then, ethylene glycol was added drop-wise to the above mixture in a ratio of 1:4 with metal nitrates. In this process, citric acid was used as a chelating agent and ethylene glycol was added to the chelated solution to initiate a poly-esterification reaction. The mixture was stirred continuously for 6 hours at a constant temperature of 353 K to form a uniform solution. Then, the solution was dried to form a gelled mass. The gelled mass was heated until auto combustion takes place. The formed dried gel was ground using an agate mortar pestle. After this the ground gel was calcined at a temperature 1073 K for 8 h. The calcined powder was compressed to form a pellet with a radius of 8 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm. The pellets were sintered at the temperature of 1173 K for 6 h in air and cooled down to the room temperature at a cooling rate of 100 K h−1.
B. Characterization
The room temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the calcined materials were obtained using an X-ray powder diffractometer (Rigaku Miniflex II) in the 2θ range of 10° to 80° with a step scanning at 0.02° per step to identify the phase and to obtain the lattice parameters of the as prepared GFMO samples. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns is performed using the Full-prof code.64 The particle size, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2, 200 kV). The room temperature Raman spectra were taken using the back-scattering geometry using a Lab RAM HR Raman spectroscope (Jobin Yvon) to ensure about the phase formation of the materials. An Ar-ion laser of effective power of 200 mW was used as the exciting line (488 nm). The complex impedance, the conductivity and the phase angle of the sintered pellet of the samples were measured at an AC voltage of 1.0 V in the frequency range from 42 Hz to 5 MHz and in the temperature range from 313 K to 723 K using a HIOKI LCR meter. The measuring temperature was controlled using an inbuilt cooling-heating system and each measured temperature was kept constant with an accuracy of ±1 K. The optical band gap of the materials was obtained from the diffuse reflectance (DR) spectrum in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm using a Shimadzu 2401 spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence spectra of the samples were collected at room temperature using a JASCO FP-8500 spectrofluorometer. The magnetic measurement was performed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM; Lakeshore). The temperature vs. magnetization measurement was carried out at an applied magnetic field of 2 kOe with an accuracy of ±5 K. The field dependent magnetization was measured at room temperature.
C. Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic experiment was performed through the degradation of organic pollutant Rh-B under the illumination of a 250 watt MPMVL UV-vis lamp, used as a visible light source. The suspension of the Rh-B solution (5 mg L−1) and the photocatalyst was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for one hour to attain the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. To enhance the photocatalytic performance of the materials, 1 mL of 4% H2O2 was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction temperature was kept constant by a cool water flow in the system to prevent any thermal catalytic effect and the thermal evaporation of the solution. A small amount of the suspension was collected from the reactor at regular time intervals. The photocatalyst powder was separated from the suspension using a Millex syringe driven filter of 0.22 micro-metre. The clear solution was then taken to the UV-Vis spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance and thereby evaluate the degradation percentage of Rh-B.
D. Photo-electrochemical measurements
The photo-electrochemical (PEC) properties of the synthesized materials were investigated using a galvanostat-potentiostat (PGSTAT302 N, Autolab, The Netherlands) with a standard three-electrode cell. In this three electrode system, Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, the reference electrode was saturated Ag/AgCl and the thin film of the as prepared material on the FTO was used as the working electrode. To prepare the thin film, 1 mg of the synthesized powder was mixed with 2.5 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) in a centrifuge tube under sonication and the resulting paste was coated on the FTO glass. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was carried out within the potential range of 0.6 V to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a medium pressure vapour lamp of 100 W with an incident beam intensity of 100 mW cm−2. 0.1 M Na2SO4 phosphate buffer (pH 7) was used as the electrolyte. The I–t amperometry study was performed at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl potential to study the stability of the synthesized materials. The photo-response of the as prepared electrode was measured under the periodic chopped irradiation.
E. X-Ray photoemission spectroscopic study
The XPS images of the samples were taken using a commercial VG ESCALAB 220I-XL imaging system. The spectra were collected using an Al Kα radiation source at 1486.6 eV. The energy spectra of the electrons were analysed using a hemispherical mirror analyser with an energy resolution of 0.5 eV. The measured binding energies were compensated in a conventional manner with a C 1s binding energy (BE) of 285 eV. The core level XPS spectra of the ions were de-convoluted using the XPSPEAK 4.165 software. The Shirley-type background subtraction was done to remove the unwanted spectrum and the spectra were fitted with the sum of the Lorentzian–Gaussian peaks. The accuracy of the determination of peak position is ±0.03 eV.
F. Density of states calculations
The total density of states (DOS) and the site projected partial density of states (PDOS) of the doped GFMO3 and the un-doped materials, GdFeO3 and GdMnO3, were calculated using the WIEN2k electronic structure code.66 In our calculations we have used 2 × 2 × 2 supercells for the un-doped systems with 20 atoms per unit cell. The 3 × 3 × 3 supercell calculations were carried out to model the doped system where the host Fe ion is replaced by Mn ion. The experimental structure of the orthorhombic GFMO was used as the initial structure. All the geometries were fully optimized by the relaxation of both the ionic positions and the cell parameters using the DFT formalism with the modified Beckee Johnson (mBJ)67 potential as the exchange correlation term. In the calculations, an energy cut-off of 680 eV was employed for the plane wave basis. The self-consistent iteration process was continued till the total energy and the charge density convergence reaches less than 0.01 mRy per unit and 0.001 e a.u−3, respectively. The onsite Coulomb potential U values of 7.1, 6.8 and 5.8 eV were applied for the f-state of Gd, d-state of Mn and d-state of Fe respectively in the calculations.
III. Results and disscussions
A. Structural analysis
The Rietveld refinement of the room temperature XRD patterns of pure GdFeO3 and Mn doped GdFeO3 is shown in Fig. 1(a)–(c). The refinement shows that the materials are synthesized in the orthorhombic phase with a Pbnm space group. A schematic representation of the GFMO unit cell is shown in Fig. 1(d), with the following distribution of ions in the crystallographic positions: Gd3+ ions at 4c, Fe3+/Mn3+ ions at 4b and O2− ions at 4c and 8d. In this crystal structure the Fe3+/Mn3+ ions are surrounded by six O2− ions which basically constitute the BO6 octahedra. The orientation of the corner-sharing BO6 octahedra in GFMO can be depicted by the Glazer system a−a−c+ which demonstrates that the octahedra turn along the Cartesian axes x and y in the consecutive layers in the inverse directions, and along the z-axis in the same direction.68 The refined unit cell parameters, the ionic positions and the isothermal parameters of the constituent ions of GFMO are listed in Table 1. The obtained lattice parameters a, b and c are given as a function of Mn content. The lattice constants a and c decrease with the increase in Mn content while the lattice constant b increases with the increase in Mn. As a result, there is a small decrease in the unit cell volume with the increase in Mn. It is observed from Table 1 that the decrease of the lattice parameter a, is lesser than the lattice parameter c and up to 30% doping of Mn at the Fe site; all the lattice parameters follow the condition a < c/√2 < b which confirms that the compound GdFe1−xMnxO3 exhibits O-type orthorhombic structure.69,70 The reliability factors, the bond lengths and the angles of Fe/Mn–(OI,OII)–Fe/Mn calculated from the refined structural parameters of GFMO are also given in Table 1. From the refinement data we have seen that with increase in the Mn concentration at the B-site of the material, the bond angle is increased which means that the distortion is getting less with the Mn concentration.

The TEM images of the GFMO particles are shown in Fig. 2. The average particle size of pure GFO is 140 nm (calculated from Fig. 2(a)), and with the doping of Mn at the B-site of the material the particle sizes are reduced and found to be 103 nm and 80 nm for GFMO1 and GFMO3, respectively (Fig. 2(b and c)). The accuracy of the particle size measurement by TEM is approximately ±1%. The GFMO particles are further analysed by the HRTEM and SAED techniques. The HRTEM images presented in Fig. 3 clearly indicate the high crystallinity of the as prepared materials. The nanoparticles exhibit well resolved lattice fringes in the HRTEM images with the interplanar spacings of 0.33, 0.2 and 0.347 nm corresponding to the (111), (122) and (111) planes of the orthorhombic structure of GFO, GFMO1 and GFMO3, respectively. Notably, better crystallinity has been observed for the doping materials compared to the pure material which may enhance the photocatalytic efficiency under light illumination. The SAED patterns in Fig. 3(d–f) show strong spots in regular positions indicating that the particles are clearly single crystalline in nature. In these figures some spots are indexed with Bragg reflections corresponding to the Pbnm orthorhombic phase.

B. Raman spectra
The role of the lattice distortions in the interplay of the various physical properties of the perovskite oxides is widely recognized. Raman spectroscopy can provide a significant additional information on the distortions and their variations with both the temperature and the cations at the A and B sites. The ideal perovskite with a cubic (Pm3m) unit cell has no Raman-active modes. But due to the loss of translational symmetries or for a less symmetric crystal structure the Raman lines are observed. The symmetry reduction in these materials can be considered as a combination of four basic distortions: an out of phase tilting of the neighbouring BO6 octahedra around the cubic [101] axis D[101] an in-phase tilting around the cubic [010] axis D[010], a Jahn–Teller distortion of the octahedral DJT and a shift of the R3+ cations DR.71–75 With respect to the parent cubic perovskite phase Pm3m, the Pnma structure in orthoferrites can be derived using the octahedral rotations. In contrast to the Pnma coordinate axis orientation, the Pbnm orientation is also used in some cases with the axis inter-conversion code from Pnma to Pbnm (a → b, b → c and c → a) and the notations of the phonon normal modes of the B symmetry are B1g ↔ B2g. The a- and c-axes of the orthorhombic Pbnm unit cell are obtained from the prototype Pnma cell by a 45° rotation of the cubic [100] and [001] axes around the [010] cubic axis and multiplication by a factor , while the orthorhombic b axis is obtained by multiplying the cubic [010] axis by a factor of 2.76,77 The Raman spectra of GFMO are measured in the frequency range of 50–800 cm−1 and are shown in Fig. S1(a)–(c) (ESI†). The identification of the microphases in GFMO requires a knowledge of the spectra of the two parent compounds, GdFeO3 and GdMnO3.78,79 The observed experimental Raman spectra of GFMO are de-convoluted using a number of Lorentzian profiles. As observed from the XRD analysis that GFMO crystallizes in the Pbnm (D162h) symmetry, the Fe/Mn ion should occupy the 4b Wyckoff-site of the Ci symmetry, the Gd and O(1) ions occupy the 4c sites of the CXZS symmetry and O(2) occupies the 8d sites of the general C1 symmetry. The irreducible representation of the D162h point group obtained from the site group symmetry is given by:80–83
ΓPbnm = 7Ag ⊕ 7B1g ⊕ 5B2g ⊕ 5B3g ⊕ 8Au ⊕ 8B1u ⊕ 10B2u ⊕ 10B3u
ΓIR = 7B1u ⊕ 9B2u ⊕ 9B3u
ΓAcoustic = B1u ⊕ B2u ⊕ B3u
ΓSilent = 8Au
ΓRaman = 7Ag ⊕ 7B1g ⊕ 5B2g ⊕ 5B3g
Thus, from the group theoretical analysis, the Pbnm symmetry allows 24 Raman active phonon modes. These phonon modes correspond to the vibrations of the Gd3+ cations (2Ag ⊕ Au ⊕ B2g ⊕ 2B2u ⊕ 2B1g ⊕ B1u ⊕ B3g ⊕ 2B3u), the oxygen anions (5Ag ⊕ 4Au ⊕ 4B2g ⊕ 5B2u ⊕ 5B1g ⊕ 4B1u ⊕ 4B3g ⊕ 5B3u) and the Fe3+/Mn3+ ions (3Au ⊕ 3B1u ⊕ 3B2u ⊕ 3B3u) in GFMO.
Schematically, the phonon modes below 200 cm−1 are mainly characterized by the displacement of the heavy rare-earth ion Gd. Above 300 cm−1 the motions of the light oxygen ions dominate and in the inter mediate frequencies the phonon modes are characterized by the vibrations of both the cations. In the present study, the Fe3+/Mn3+ ions occupy centres of inversion in the Pbnm structure, and therefore the characteristic phonon vibrations involving Fe3+/Mn3+ remain Raman inactive. The Raman spectra of GFMO varying with x are identified and indexed. The remainder of the predicted modes are either masked by the band overlap or their intensities remain low due to the polycrystalline nature of the materials.
In the case of pure GdFeO3, multiple Raman active bands are visible which correspond to the 〈Fe–O(1)–Fe〉 bond angle, and Fe–O1, Fe–O2 and 〈Gd–O〉 bond lengths. As the Mn-doping increases the Raman modes undergo shift in the frequencies. Also the peak broadening results from the lattice disorder due to the incorporation of Mn at the Fe-site. The band between 600 cm−1 and 645 cm−1 presents some peculiar characteristics. The frequency seems to be independent of the doping concentration of Mn in GdFeO3, besides showing strong asymmetry. As can be seen from Table 2, the calculations predict two bands of B1g and B3g symmetry in this region. Since, all the seven Ag modes are conclusively identified and indexed within 500 cm−1 no Raman active Ag mode is present between 600 cm−1 and 645 cm−1. We therefore conclude that this is not a first order Raman mode. A precise interpretation of this band is beyond the scope of this work. But we note that similar features have been shown to exist for other rare earth orthoferrites78 and also for other perovskite oxides83 with unclear assignments and conflicting reports.

C. Electrical conduction mechanism
The temperature and the frequency dependent ac conductivity of GFMO samples is represented in Fig. 4(a–c). In general the ac conductivity is analysed to understand the nature of the conduction mechanism followed by the materials. The frequency dependent ac conductivity is originated due to the free as well as the bound charge carriers. When the ac conductivity is decreasing with the increase in temperature, the free charge carriers are responsible for the conduction mechanism. In our case the conductivity is increasing with the increase of temperature which is due to the bound charge carriers. As the conductivity depends on temperature, the conduction process is thermally dependent. Due to the increase in temperature, the bound charge carriers are released from the electronic trap centres in the materials which causes the conductivity to increase. For a particular temperature the frequency dependent conductivity spectrum is divided into two regions: the first region which lies in the lower frequency side is frequency independent. This plateau region when extrapolated towards the zero frequency gives the dc conductivity value. The second frequency dependent region in the high frequency side is called the dispersion region. In this region the conductivity isotherms tend to get superimposed with each other. All the experimental conductivity data are fitted with the Jonscher's power law defined as:84 σ = σdc[1 + (ω/ωH)n](1)where σdc represents the value of dc conductivity, ωH is the hopping frequency which divides the plateau and the dispersion regions of the conductivity spectrum and n represents the degree of interaction between the mobile ions and the lattices.

Since the material is an orthoferrite material, the conduction mechanism in this type of material occurs due to the hopping of the delocalized electrons between the available localized sites. In this material, the 3d electrons are split into less stable eg electrons and more stable t2g electrons due to the electrostatic interaction. The electron density in the eg level is represented by the equation ne = n0exp(eV/kT), where ne is the electron density at any temperature T (K), n0 is the electron density at zero temperature, e is the electron charge and V is the potential applied. With the increase in temperature the hopping probability of the electrons is increased between the localized sites and hence the conductivity increases.85,86 It is also observed from Fig. 4(a–c) that with the increase in Mn concentration, the conductivity increases. The Mn doping at the B site of GFO introduces some extra conduction paths between the grains through which the electrons are conducted.87 Moreover the increase in the Mn concentration reduces the deviation of the bond angle (Fe/Mn–O–Fe/Mn) from the ideal 180° and therefore reduces the octahedral distortion. This results in the increase of the overlap of the d-orbitals of Fe/Mn with the p-orbital of O which also assists to increase the conductivity.88
The dc conductivity values are plotted in Fig. 4(d) against the inverse of temperature according to the Arrhenius equation σdc = σ0exp(Ea/kT) [where, σ0 is the pre exponential factor, k is the Boltzmann constant and Ea is the activation energy for conduction]. The dc conductivity data are fitted linearly to derive the activation energy (presented in Fig. 4(d)). The obtained values of the activation energy are found to be 0.43 ± 0.01, 0.45 ± 0.01, and 0.42 ± 0.01 eV for GFO, GFMO1, and GFMO3, respectively. It is known that if the value of activation energy lies in between 0 and 0.2 eV, the n-type polaronic hopping takes place whereas a value between 0.2 and 0.9 eV indicates the p-type polaronic hopping.89 So, the obtained values of the activation energy for the GFMO materials indicate that the conductivity mechanism is due to the p-type polaronic hopping between the available localized sites.
D. Complex impedance analysis
For the better understanding of the electrical properties of the materials we have employed the complex impedance spectroscopy (CIS).90 The Cole–Cole plot of Z′′ vs. Z′ is displayed in Fig. 5(a–c). The plots show a single semi-circular arc passing through the origin at each temperature for the GFMO materials which suggests that only grain effect is present in the relaxation mechanism of the materials. This type of behaviour allows us to employ a single parallel R–C circuit to interpret the nature of the plots and to correlate the electrical properties with the micro-structure of the materials. All the experimental data are fitted using the following equation:91,92 (2)where, Rg is the grain resistance, Cg is the grain capacitance, τg = 1/ωg = RgCg, the parameter p represents the angle of tilt of the semi-circular arc from the real axis (0 < p < 1), and ωg represents the angular frequency corresponding to the maximum value of Z′′ vs. logω plots. The diameter of the semi-circular arc denotes grain resistance. With the increase in temperature the diameter of the arc is decreasing i.e., the grain resistance is decreasing which is the cause for the increase in conductivity with temperature as shown in Fig. 4. The decrease of the resistance with the increase in temperature suggests the semiconducting nature of the materials. Moreover, we have seen from Fig. 5(d) that the resistance decreases with increase in the Mn concentration, which can be due to the reduction of the barrier height in the material. The scaling behaviour of Z′′ (where, Z′′ has been scaled by  and frequency by ωm) of the samples at different temperatures is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†), which shows that all the graphs coincide with each other indicating that the relaxation mechanism is the same at all the temperatures for GFMO materials.

E. Dielectric properties
The dielectric constant is an important parameter for the miniaturization of the electronic circuit. The high dielectric constant and the low dielectric loss are the main requirements for this purpose. The complex dielectric constant is represented by ε* and according to Mott theory it is expressed as ε* = ε′ − jε′′, where ε′ is the real part of the permittivity and ε′′ is the imaginary part.93 The room temperature dielectric constant (ε′) and tanδ for different concentrations of Mn are represented in Fig. 6(a and b), respectively. The tanδ is characterized by a relaxation peak where the energy storage is minimum. The value of ε′ increases with the increase in the Mn concentration and has the highest value for the sample GFMO3 and correspondingly tanδ becomes minimum which is represented by the lowest peak.
 Fig. 6  Frequency dependence of (a) the real part ε′ and (b) loss tangent (tanδ) for GdFeO3, GdFe0.9Mn0.1O3 and GdFe0.7Mn0.3O3 samples at 313 K. 
According to Smit and Wijn theory, the relationship among ε′, σac (ac conductivity) and tanδ is given by:94 ε′ = 4πσac/ωtanδ.(3)From Fig. 4 we can see that conductivity increases with the Mn concentration and the same is true for the dielectric constant which is in good agreement with Smit and Wijn theory.87 The concentration dependent increase of the dielectric constant is due to the increase in the chemical pressure which is introduced by the doping of Mn at the B-site of the material. Since the increase of Mn doping produces more trivalent and tetravalent states at the B-site, the Fe3+ ions may transfer to the Fe2+ and the Mn3+ goes to the Mn4+ state to maintain the charge neutrality in the system according to the following equation.95 Fe3+ + Mn3+ ↔ Fe2+ + Mn4+(4)This charge transfer produces more hopping of the charge carriers between Fe3+ ↔ Fe2+ which results in the reduction of resistance and hence increases the polarization and the dielectric constant of the material. Apart from concentration dependency, the dielectric constant is also frequency dependent. It can be observed from Fig. 6(a) that after a certain frequency there is a sharp decrease in the dielectric constant. This is may be due to the resistance of the motion of the dipoles along the applied electric field direction or due to the increase in the free charge carriers which remains a cause for the decrease of polarization.
F. Oxidation state of ions studied by X-ray photoemission spectra
To determine the chemical states of the constituent ions Gd, Fe, Mn and O in GFMO materials, XPS technique is employed. The XPS spectra of GFMO materials in the energy window of 0–1300 eV are identified and indexed in Fig. S3(a)–(c) (ESI†). The broad peak at 600 eV originates from the Gd (MNN) Auger line. The high-resolution core-level spectra of Gd-3d, Gd-4d of GFMO are shown in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†), respectively. Fig. 7–9 show the core level spectra of O-1s, Fe-2p and Mn-2p, respectively. The d3/2, d5/2 peaks in Gd-3d and Gd-4d and 2p1/2, 2p3/2 peaks in Fe-2p and Mn-2p core level spectra are attributed to the spin–orbit interactions having a lower J (= l − s) value component in the higher energy side and a higher J (= l + s) component in the lower energy side. The spin–orbit splitting energies of the Gd 3d peak is found to be 31.97, 32.37 and 32.43 eV, respectively, for GFO, GFMO1 and GFMO3. In addition to spin–orbit peaks, one weak satellite at 1195.35 eV between the main Gd 3d5/2 and Gd 3d3/2 split components could be observed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The spin–orbit energy separation between the 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 peak of Gd is only ∼5.6 eV for all the materials. In the case of Gd 4d XPS peak, the main spectral feature arises from the multiplet splitting due to the electrostatic interactions between the 4d hole and 4f7 valence electrons to form the 9D and 7D final ionic states. The line shape and the peak positions of the 3d and 4d photoemission spectra of Gd are in good agreement with the reported spectra of Gd2O3 powder.96 This confirms the 3+ oxidation state of Gd in GFMO materials of Gd2O3. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that the O 1s spectra consist of three peaks. According to Petrovic et al.97 the highest binding energy (BE) peak is associated with the adsorbed oxygen, such as water and carbonates. In GFMO this peak is originated due to the hygroscopicity of gadolinium which is the common feature of the lanthanide oxide materials. The low BE peaks are assigned to the lattice oxygens which are bonded with the cations in GFMO. The presence of the two low energy peaks in the O-1s spectra is due to the two different crystallographic positions of O ion in orthorhombic GFMO. The chemical shift of O-1s spectra is calculated with respect to its literature value 531.6 eV98 and the values are found to be −4.3/−3.14 eV (peak 1/peak 2), −3.3/−1.66 eV (peak 1/peak 2) and −3.5/−1.68 eV (peak 1/peak 2) for GFO, GFMO1 and GFMO3, respectively. The negative chemical shifts are observed for all the three materials.

 Fig. 9  The Mn-2p core-level spectra of GFMO1 (a) and GFMO3 (b). 
The spin–orbit splitting energies of the Fe 2p spectra [Fig. 8] are found to be 13.53, 13.75 and 14.01 eV for GFO, GFMO1 and GFMO3, respectively. It is observed from the XPS studies of the high spin Fe3+ and Fe2+ compounds that the 2p3/2 peak is broadened compared with the metal Fe0 or low spin Fe2+.99 Gupta and Sen100 suggested that the broadness of the Fe-2p peaks could be due to the inclusion of the electrostatic interactions, the spin–orbit coupling between the 2p core hole and the unpaired 3d electrons of the photoionized Fe cation and the crystal field interactions. They have calculated the multiplet structure of the core p-vacancy levels in the Hartree–Fock free-ion approximation and predicted a large number of final states for a 2p vacancy. A distinct satellite around 719 eV is observed in the Fe 2p3/2 peak in Fig. 8 for all the materials. This satellite is originated from the dynamic charge transfer during the photoemission process and its presence is common in the XPS for other transition metal compounds. The presence of another satellite around 716 eV in GFMO3 and the position of the 2p3/2 peak maximum around 709.3 eV for GFMO1 and GFMO3 suggest the existence of the Fe2+ state along with Fe3+ though only the Fe3+ state is present in the GFO compound. Thus, we have fitted the experimental Fe 2p spectrum with the two spin–orbit peaks for GFMO1 and GFMO3 compounds. The ratio of the amount of the divalent to trivalent iron ions in GFMO is calculated and given in Table 3. It can be observed from Fig. 8 that the chemical shift of the 2p3/2 peak of GFMO materials is positive with respect to its literature value of 707 eV for Fe0.98

Due to the asymmetric broad nature of the Mn 2p spin–orbit main lines in Fig. 9 we have fitted the spectra with two pair of spin–orbit peaks; one for the Mn3+ state and the other for the Mn4+ state. The lower and the higher energy peaks for each of the main lines of Mn 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 correspond to Mn3+ and Mn4+, respectively. The final state configuration of 2p53d3 for Mn4+ and 2p53d4 for Mn3+ ionic states is derived from the 2p63d3 and 2p63d4 initial states, respectively. From the results of de-convolution of the Mn 2p peak, the tetravalent to trivalent ratio of the Mn 2p3/2 peak is estimated and given in Table 3. It can be observed from Table 3 that the Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio increases with the increase of Mn content and simultaneously the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio increases. This observation also support our prediction made in section E (Dielectric properties). Similar to the Fe 2p3/2 peak the chemical shift of the Mn 2p3/2 peak for GFMO materials is positive with respect to Mn0 (639 eV).98 The positive chemical shift of Fe and Mn 2p3/2 and the negative chemical shift of the O 1s suggest the strong covalent character of the Fe/Mn–O bond in GFMO materials.
G. Optical properties
The light absorption range of a material is one of its crucial characteristics for photocatalytic activity. The absorbance spectra of GFMO materials are represented in Fig. 10(a). From this figure we can see that the absorbance range of all the materials lies in the visible light region. Furthermore, it is observed that with the increase in the Mn concentration the absorbance range is increased and the material GFMO3 shows that almost the total portion of the visible light is absorbed by it. It is well known that the photocatalytic reaction is directly proportional to the number of photons adsorbed by the photocatalyst. Thus with the increase in the Mn dopant more photons are absorbed in the visible region due to the wide absorption range of GFMO, facilitating the photocatalysis reaction.
 Fig. 10  (a) Absorption spectra and (b) Tauc plot for GdFeO3, GdFe0.9Mn0.1O3 and GdFe0.7Mn0.3O3 samples. 
From the absorbance data, we have calculated the band gap of the materials by using the Tauc relation as given below:101,102 (5)where, α is the linear absorption coefficient, hν is the photon energy, Eg is the band gap and n represents the type of electronic transition that occurs between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB) [n = 1/2, 2, 3/2, and 3 for direct-allowed, indirect allowed, direct forbidden and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively]. Here we consider n = 1/2 for the direct allowed transitions and plot (αhυ)2vs. hν which is presented in Fig. 10(b). From this plot, the calculated values of the band gap are found to be 2.18 ± 0.05, 1.9 ± 0.05 and 1.72 ± 0.05 eV for GFO, GFMO1 and GFMO3, respectively. The continuous decrease in the band gap with increase in the Mn concentration allows more electrons to transfer to the CB due to the application of the electric field and therefore supports the increase in conductivity.
H. Photocatalytic performances
The photocatalytic efficiency of the Mn doped GFO materials is studied by the degradation of Rh-B. Rh-B is an organic pollutant which is used extensively for industrial purpose. The absorption spectra of the Rh-B solution at successive time intervals are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The Rh-B concentration decreases with increase in time. The bar diagram presented in the inset of Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the concentration of Rh-B at the wavelength of 553 nm at successive time intervals. The percentage degradation of the Rh-B dye is evaluated using the following formula103,104: (6)where, C0 is the initial concentration and Ct is the concentration after t hours of the degradation experiment. The accuracy of the % degradation measurement is ±0.5%. Pure GFO shows degradation of Rh-B within 1 h, while 10% Mn doped GFO and 30% Mn doped GFO show the degradation in 40 min and 25 min, respectively. So, the Mn doping increases the degradation efficiency and 30% Mn doped GFO shows exceptionally good photocatalytic efficiency and help us to obtain almost clean water (Rh-B free). To study the reaction kinetics of the degradation experiment, we have fitted the experimental data using the pseudo first order model. The (Ct/C0) vs. visible light irradiation time (t) curve for GFMO sample is shown in Fig. 11(a). Fig. 11(b) represents the ln(C0/Ct) vs. the visible light irradiation time (t) curves, where the linearity nature indicates the first order kinetics of the visible light driven photocatalytic Rh-B degradation. The rate constant (k) is evaluated from the first order equation ln(C0/Ct) = Kobst [where, Kobs is the observed pseudo first order rate content and t is the total time]. The obtained values of Kobs are 0.14406, 0.09149, 0.06655 and 0.00156 for GFMO3, GFMO1, GFO and without catalyst, respectively.

In view of the practical applications of the photocatalyst, the reusability and the stability are the two important factors. To study the reusability we have recycled the GFMO3 catalyst for 5 successive runs as presented in Fig. 11(c). It is observed that the degradation efficiency falls only 10% after the five repetitive runs. This small loss may happen due to some mass loss during the collection of the photocatalyst after each successive run. Furthermore, to check the stability, we performed the XRD measurement of the photocatalyst before and after the photocatalysis reaction as presented in Fig. 11(d). From this figure we found that there is no change in the XRD pattern which indicates that no structural change occurred in the photocatalyst. Also no secondary phase in the XRD pattern is observed after the reaction. These demonstrate that the GFMO3 nanoparticles have high stability and do not photocorrode during the photocatalytic reaction. The above results suggest that GFMO3 is an efficient photocatalyst in the visible light region.
It is known that the photocatalysis process basically depends on the principle of adsorption–degradation–release. The photo induced reaction between the organic pollutant and the photocatalyst takes place on the surface of the photocatalyst. So, with the increase in the surface area of the photocatalyst, the degradation rate also increases. The TEM result shows that GFMO3 has the smallest particle size and therefore provides largest surface area for the degradation reaction among the three materials which makes an impact on its increased degradation efficiency. Another effect of the doping of Mn3+ in GFO is that it may introduce an energy level which is acting as an electron or a hole trap centre. These electron or hole trap centres separate the electrons and the holes for a short time.105 With the increase in the Mn concentration more number of electron and hole trapping sites are created which help the material to adsorb more O2 and OH−.106 For the sample, GFMO3, more number of electrons and holes are separated which take part in the surface redox reaction to produce more hydroxyl radicals. These hydroxyl radicals degrade the organic pollutant. Thus, this material shows maximum degradation of the pollutant and can be used to produce clean water from the waste water.
In Table ST1 (ESI†) we have compared our results with the reported degradation efficiency of the organic pollutant by GFO-based materials.56–62 It can be observed from this table that GFMO3 has maximum photocatalytic efficiency to degrade Rh-B in the lowest time. Thus we can conclude that GFMO3 is a more promising material to use as a photocatalyst for the degradation of the organic pollutant under visible light with respect to other GFO-based materials.
I. Photocatalytic mechanism
In order to explore the photocatalytic mechanism, the reactions which occurred in the photocatalysis process have to be analysed. Generally, the hydroxyl radicals react with the organic pollutant during the photocatalysis which are produced by the reaction between the holes and the water molecules in the presence of light. On the other hand electrons react with oxygen and produce the superoxide anion. In this case the hydroxyl radicals react with Rh-B and produce water and carbon dioxide. Below we represent the possible reactions which can occur during the degradation period:107,108GdFe1−xMnxO3 + hν → hVB+ + eCB−O2 + e− → O2˙−e− + Mn dopant → e− (Mn dopant trapped)O2˙− + h+ → ˙HOO2H2O + O2˙− → 4˙OHh+ + H2O → ˙OH + H+e− + H2O2 → OH− + ˙OH˙OH + RhB → degradation productsO2˙− + RhB → degradation productsIt is believed that the photo-catalytic activity of a photo-catalyst is largely dependent on the generation, the separation, the transport and the recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs. To shed light on the enhanced photo-catalytic mechanism of GFMO, we have further investigated the photo-generated carrier behaviours using various photo-electrochemical techniques including the PL and the photocurrent measurements. A comparative study of the PL spectra of the samples excited at 250 nm is presented in Fig. 12(a). All the samples show a peak at 275 nm. This peak denotes the recombination rate of the electrons and holes. It is believed that a lower recombination rate of the electrons and the holes supports the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. As the GFMO3 has the lowest peak, its electron–hole recombination rate is poor.109,110 Hence, in GFMO3, more separated electrons and holes take part in the redox reaction and increase the photocatalytic efficiency of this material.
 Fig. 12  (a) PL emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm for all the three samples, (b) linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves, and (c) chronoamperometric plot of the GFO and Mn doped GFO thin film semiconductor electrodes on FTO substrates in the presence of 0.1 M Na2SO4–phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) under chopped illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The chronoamperometric plot measured at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl and (d) M–H curve for the samples GFO, GFMO1 & GFMO3 at room temperature and applied magnetic field 2 kOe. 
So, it is clear that the doping of Mn3+ reduces the recombination rate and facilitates the photocatalytic efficiency of the material. Furthermore, the linear sweep voltametric (LSV) study has been carried out under a light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 12(b)). The bare GFO photo-anode shows a low current density in the full potential range, because of its poor ability of the charge separation, which leads to the fast recombination of the photo-induced electron–hole pairs. However, an enhanced current density has been obtained for GFMO1 and GFMO3 electrodes and it reaches a maximum value of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for GFMO3. This result demonstrates that the incorporation of Mn significantly improves the visible light absorption and efficiently separates the photo-induced electrons and holes, leading to a notable enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. After this, transient photo current measurement has been performed to gain insight into the carrier separation efficiency of the catalysts under the chopped light. As shown in Fig. 12(c), GFMO3 has maximum enhanced photocurrent (1.31 μA cm−2) compared to others, revealing the promoted separation and the transfer of the photo generated charge carriers after Mn doping.
Apart from the above mentioned factor, the degradation efficiency is also affected by the interface charge separation and the migration of the charges which are determined from the dielectric constant and the complex impedance plot. We know that the dielectric constant is directly related to the Debye length and the Debye length is proportional to the space charge width according to the following relations:111,112 (7) (8)where, ε0 is the dielectric constant of the free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the material, Vs is the potential applied on the surface and ND is the donor density of the material. From the above equations we have seen that with the increase in the Mn concentration the space charge width is decreased which is favourable for the better charge carrier transfer through the interface. Again much lower width of the space charge region reduces the photocatalytic efficiency as it offers more recombination of the electrons and the holes. In the case of GFMO3, the increase in the dielectric constant and the Mn dopant may result in an optimum space charge width which gives a justification to the remarkable increase in its photocatalytic efficiency. It is observed from the Cole–Cole plot obtained from the EIS measurement (presented in Fig. 5(d)) that the radius of the grain (i.e., resistance) decreases with the Mn concentration. This decrease in resistance is advantageous for the acceleration of the electrons and therefore enhances the migration of the electron113.
J. Density of states calculations
The spin-polarized DOS of GFMO3 obtained from GGA calculation is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). No energy gap is observed in the up spin channel at a Fermi level set at 0 eV, whereas an energy gap of 2.82 eV is present in the down spin channel between the O-p states in the VB maxima and the Fe-d states in the CB minima. In GFMO3, Mn is in the 3+ oxidation states with the electronic configuration [Ar] 3d4, thus the partially field d-states of Mn contribute at the Fermi level in the up spin channel. To open up an energy gap at the Fermi level in the up spin channel we have used an orbital potential term U with mBJ calculations. The total DOS and the PDOS obtained from the mBJ+U calculations for GFMO3 are shown in Fig. 13. It is observed that an energy gap of 1.15 eV is opened between the O-p states at the VB and Mn-d states at the CB in the up spin channel. As well as in the down spin channel 4.2 eV energy gap is present between the O-p states at the VB and the Mn-d states at the CB. The analysis of the PDOS spectra indicates that in the up spin channel the VB extended from 0 eV to −10 eV is mainly consists of the Gd-f, Fe-d, Mn-d and O-p states. On the other hand in the down spin channel the major contribution of the d-states of Fe and Mn and the f-states of Gd appears in the CB extended from 1.15 eV to 8 eV. The outer electrons from Gd, Fe and Mn atoms are transferred to complete the 2p shell of the oxygen atoms, resulting in the nominal chemical formula of Gd3+Fe0.73+Mn0.33+O32−. The over-lapping of the O-p states and the d-states of Fe and Mn in the VB suggests the strong hybridization of the O-p states with the d-states of Fe and Mn. In GFMO3 the electronic configuration of Gd3+ is [Xe]4f7 thus the half-filled f-states of Gd reside in both the VB and the CB. In the up spin channel the bonding state of Gd-4f7 is completely filled and lies in deep VB around 7.5 eV whereas the anti-bonding state lies in the CB. Both the bonding and the anti-bonding states of Gd-4f7 lie in the CB at the down spin channel. The splitting of the 3d states of Fe and Mn is due to the combined effects of the crystal-field, the exchange, and the Jahn–Teller (JT) distortion. The JT distortion of the O octahedron in this material can be viewed as the t2g3eg2 and t2g3eg1 electronic configuration of Fe and Mn, respectively. The Jahn–Teller effect is usually important for an odd occupancy level of eg and it is very week in Fe3+ (t32ge2g). Moreover due to the orthorhombic crystal structure of GFMO3 all the t2g (dxy dyz dzx) and eg (dx2−y2 dz2) states are non-degenerated and hence the d-states of Fe and Mn are extended in a wide energy range in the VB and the CB. It is observed from the PDOS spectra that the Mn-d states are present in between the O-p states in the VB and the Fe-d states in the CB and hence the doping of Mn in GFO reduces the band gap which is in good agreement with the experimental results. These Mn-d states can act as the trapping centre for the charge carrier which facilitates the migration of the photogenerated electrons; as a result, the photocatalytic efficiency increases with the increase of Mn content.

In the band engineering strategy, the doping of Mn at the B-site of GFO displays remarkable effect on the reduction of the band gap as observed by the UV-vis measurement (Fig. 10). The spin-polarized DOS spectra obtained from the mBJ+U calculations for the undoped materials GdFeO3 and GdMnO3 are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) which indicate that the 3d orbital energy of Fe is higher than that of Mn and hence the 3d-states of Mn lie towards conduction band minima with respect to the Fe-3d states. Similar conclusions can also be made from the electronic band structure calculations of GdFeO3 and GdMnO3 by Mekam et al.114 In the case of Mn doping, when Fe is substituted with Mn, the interaction of Mn-3d with O-2p produces several discrete midgap bands between the Fermi level and the Fe-3d states in the CB. As a result the band gap decreases with the Mn concentration in GFMO. These bands provide the extra electronic states at the bottom of the CB to promote the electrons from VB under the visible light irradiation of GFMO materials. Thus photocatalytic efficiency enhances with Mn doping in GFMO.
From the above discussions it can be seen that Mn doping increases the photocatalytic efficiency and the 30% Mn doped GFO shows highest photocatalytic efficiency. However, in virtue of better visible-light absorption and efficient separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes, Mn doped GdFeO3 shows attractive photocatalytic activity, which is promising for the better utilization of the visible light of solar spectrum and further applications.
K. Magnetic study
The temperature dependence of magnetization (M) for GFMO at an applied magnetic field of 2 kOe is shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The value of M increases with the increase in temperature and shows an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) to paramagnetic transition. The data show a significant change in the magnetic transition temperature with Mn ion concentration in GFO. It is observed that the Néel temperature (TN) decreases with the Mn concentration. The value of TN for GFO is found to be 664 K which is in good agreement with the previously reported value.115 The 10% doping of Mn shifts the TN to 615 K for GFMO1. For GFMO3 no magnetic transition has been observed in the measured temperature window from 300 K to 683 K (inset Fig. S7, ESI†). It is known that the TN of GdMnO3 is only 43 K.116 Hence the doping of Mn in GFO decreases the TN value. The increase of magnetization with the decrease of temperature indicates that the magnetic transition for GFMO3 occurs below the room temperature. The M–H curves in Fig. 12(d) illustrate the variation of the magnetization with the applied magnetic field for GFO, GFMO1 and GFMO3 at room temperature.117 The inset of Fig. 12(d) shows the canted AFM nature of the M–H curve for GFMO and GFMO1 with a weak ferromagnetic moment due to the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction which originates due to the canting of the Fe3+ ions via oxygen ligands.118,119 Since the magnetic transition temperature of GFMO3 is below the room temperature, the pure paramagnetic nature is observed in the M–H curve. It is observed from the M–H curves that the value of the magnetization increases with Mn concentration. In general the opposite alignment of the spins of the individual magnetic species gives rise to anti-ferromagnetism in the materials. With the increase in Mn concentration, the number of Fe ions decreases in GFMO which may oppose the cancellation of all the Fe spins due to the unpaired Fe ions. Thus the unpaired Fe or Mn ions in GFMO result in the increase of the magnetization with Mn doping. The magnetic separation of the materials has also been examined by using a magnet placed at the bottom of the glass bottle. The black samples are strongly attracted by the magnet which indicates that the samples are magnetically separable from the solution. This experiment denotes that this kind of magnetically separable material having higher photocatalytic efficiency is highly desirable for environmental remediation.
IV. Conclusions
All the materials under investigation are synthesized by the sol gel method. The Rietveld refinement of the XRD profiles suggests that all the materials have an orthorhombic Pbnm crystal structure as that of the parent compounds GdFeO3 and GdMnO3. The Mn doping at the Fe site of GdFeO3 shows particle size reduction with the dopant concentration which effectively enhances the photocatalytic efficiency of the material. The UV-vis spectra reveal the band gap reduction with the increase in Mn concentration which helps to absorb a wide range of visible light and hence increases the photocatalytic efficiency. The band gap reduction with Mn doping is also verified from the DFT calculations. The Mn doping at the Fe site reduces the band gap by forming a midgap between the Fermi level and the conduction band. It is also seen that Mn doping reduces the recombination rate of the carriers and hence more separated electrons and holes are created. These electrons and holes produced more hydroxyl radicals and super oxide anions which degrade the pollutant. The XPS study reveals that with the increase in the Mn content, the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio increases and Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio decreases. This observation supports the proposed charge transfer theory. Since the increase of Mn doping produces more trivalent and tetravalent states, the Fe3+ ions may transfer to Fe2+ and Mn3+ goes to the Mn4+ state to maintain the charge neutrality. This charge transfer produces more hopping of the charge carriers between Fe3+ ↔ Fe2+ which reduces the resistance and hence the dielectric constant of the material increases. GFMO3 shows the highest photocatalytic efficiency and degrades the Rh-B pollutant in just 25 min under the visible light illumination which is much lower than the degradation time of pure GFO. Furthermore, due to the nearly same ionic radius of Mn3+ and Fe3+, GFMO materials have good structural stability and provide reliable recycling photocatalytic performance. The reusability experiment shows that GFMO3 can be reused for five successive cycles which is also crucial for the further applications of this photocatalyst in the industry.
