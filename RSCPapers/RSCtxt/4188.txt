    First published on 1st August 2022AbstractRecent advances reveal that upconversion (UC) luminescent materials are highly important not just from a scientific, but also from a future application standpoint. Although significant progress has been made in this field in recent decades, still their versatile applications are hindered by the low upconversion luminescence intensity and low tuneability, which has hampered further implementation in real life applications. We find it highly beneficial to compile a summary of recent relevant literature and propose ways to enhance upconversion efficiency in lanthanide nanomaterials. One very promising way to tackle this problem is through implementing transition metal ion co-dopants into the materials, which is the focus of this tutorial review. In this review, the recent studies related to the tailored design of UC materials with transition metal ion co-dopants have been summarized, and the desirable functionality of transition metal ions in the host matrixes has been discussed. Apart from improving the upconversion efficiency, the implementation of transition metal-co-dopants into lanthanide upconversion materials has recently sparked interest in applications such as in vivo imaging, drug delivery or nanothermometers.

Introduction
Photon upconversion (UC), known as anti-Stokes emission, is a nonlinear optical phenomenon in which two or more low-energy photons are sequentially absorbed via intermediate long-lived energy states, resulting in a high-energy photon emission. This phenomenon was first proposed by N. Bloembergen in 1959.1 Since then, several strategies for developing UC luminescent materials, as well as bulk materials, based on trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) have been extensively explored and effectively utilized for display devices and compact solid-state lasers.2,3 In general UC has been reported in transition metal (3d, 4d, 5d), lanthanide (4f), and actinide (5f) materials, although the maximum efficiencies are observed in lanthanide-doped materials.4 Ln3+-based UC materials have piqued interest due to large anti-Stokes shifts, narrow band emissions, long luminescence lifetimes, excellent photostability and low cytotoxicity as well as are gaining popularity for being able to be used for monitoring biological processes.5–8 Near infrared (NIR) rather than ultraviolet (UV) excitation is used in the UC process, which considerably reduces background autofluorescence, photobleaching, and photodamage to biological specimens making it useful for various biological applications. UC enables in vivo imaging with significantly higher spatial resolution, as well as offers remarkable sample penetration depths which are far greater than those possible with UV excitation.9,10 UC nanomaterials appear to be a promising alternative for organic fluorophores or quantum dots in biological assays and medical imaging.11 Energy transfers were not recognized as significant in UC processes until 1966, when Auzel proposed that energy transfers between Ln3+ ions may occur between two ions that were both excited at the time of the energy transfer initiating step.12 Some of the most prevalent UC processes usually involve excited state absorption (ESA) after ground state absorption (GSA), energy transfer upconversion (ETU), cooperative sensitization, cooperative luminescence, and two-photon absorption (Fig. 1). The ESA process involves the successive absorption of pump photons by a single Ln3+ ion due to the ladder-like structure of a simple multilevel system. Both ETU and ESA use sequential absorption of two photons to populate the metastable level. The primary distinction between ETU and ESA is that in ETU, excitation is achieved via energy transfer between two neighbouring ions. The cooperative sensitization involves two sensitizers transferring their absorbed energy to the activator at the same time without the use of an intermediary metastable state corresponding to a single pumping photon. Furthermore, in a two-photon absorption mechanism, the activator can absorb two photons simultaneously. For cooperative luminescence, two ions (such as Yb3+) assemble their absorbed photons to a virtual emitting level with eventual luminescence. The ETU process has been most widely used to provide incredibly efficient UC among the four processes due to the matching of the intermediate energy level of the activator and the excited state of the sensitizer for resonant energy transfer.2 The Ln3+ ions, with the exception of Yb3+, exhibit many metastable levels, which is a prerequisite for UC. This is because the outer-lying 5s and 5p electrons shield the spectroscopically active 4f electrons from their chemical environment, resulting in exceptionally low electron–phonon coupling strengths for the multiple excited f–f states. As a result, when compared to other ions, luminescence processes in Ln3+ are far more competitive with multiphonon relaxation and their excited state lifetimes are usually between 10−6 and 10−2 seconds.13 Lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) show a wide range of promising applications, however, due to low extinction coefficients and low UC quantum yields,14 improvements are still required to optimize and enhance the characteristics of UC nanomaterials for possible commercial applications.

Having a closer look at lanthanides, the trivalent lanthanide ions are characterized by a gradual filling of the 4f orbitals, from 4f0 (for La3+) to 4f14 (for Lu3+). The shielding of the 4f electrons of Ln3+ by the completed filled 5s2 and 5p6 sub-shells results in weak electron phonon interactions, which is responsible for significant phenomena such as sharp and narrow f–f transition bands and long lifetimes of the excited states.8,15 Among the Ln3+ ions, Yb3+ has the potential to act as a sensitizer in ETU systems. This is due to its exceptional, simple energy level with only one excited level of 2F5/2. Er3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ (mainly Er3+ and Tm3+) ions are deemed the most efficient activators. They have energy levels in a ladder-like arrangement, long-lived excited states, and excellent resonance with the Yb3+ transition (2F7/2 → 2F5/2).
Among the three types of activators, Er3+ has the highest UC efficiency due to its similar sequential energy gap, namely between the 4I11/2 and 4I15/2 states and between the 4F7/2 and 4I11/2 states.16,17 To minimize non-radiative relaxation and improve UC efficiency, the doping ions (sensitizer and activators) must be doped into hosts with low phonon energy, such as oxides,18 fluorides,19 and phosphates.20 Already in the early 1970s, sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF4) was investigated as an efficient UC host.21 These fluoride hosts are rather straightforward to synthesize and show low solubility in water, which leads to their chemical resistance against hydrolysis. Homann et al.22 reported that NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ upconversion nanoparticles with an inert shell of NaYF4 with mean sizes ranging from 15 to 45 nm were synthesized using a modified synthesis based on anhydrous rare-earth acetates. According to absolute photoluminescence quantum yield studies, they found that the maximum quantum yield of 45 nm core/shell particles is comparable to that of microcrystalline upconversion phosphor powder. In general, increasing the efficient concentration of the Ln3+ dopants in a material can boost photoluminescence efficiency. However, high dopant concentrations might cause potential cross-relaxation, leading to excitation energy quenching. To avoid the quenching effect, the concentration of activator ions should be kept low and appropriately regulated. The maximal concentration limit is determined on the exact distance between the lattice sites occupied by lanthanide ions. In most UC materials, Er3+ concentrations do not exceed 3% and Tm3+ concentrations do not surpass 0.5%. Yet, at these concentrations light absorption is insufficient, preventing these materials from being used as phosphors.16 In order to take advantage of the efficient ETU process between the sensitizer and the activator, a sensitizer (e.g. Yb3+) with a significant absorption cross-section in the NIR region is usually co-doped with the activator for enhancement of UC luminescence efficiency.17 Yet, despite the introduction of Yb3+ as a sensitizer, in general, UC efficiency is still far from satisfactory in nanomaterials.
To overcome this problem, many strategies have been proposed to boost the UCL intensity, and among them some of the most explored are (1) growing one or more (un)doped (inert) shell layers epitaxially or nonepitaxially, (2) harnessing the surface plasmon resonance effect, (3) altering the crystal phase of nanocrystals, (4) co-doping with a sensitizer, and (5) annealing treatment.23–25 Among countless methods for improving UCL, doping of optical activators into the host lattice, such as transition-metal ions (TMn+), has been shown to present a potential strategy for improved UCL when compared to only Ln3+ ion doped materials. This is the main topic of this tutorial review. In general, this is a very interesting topic, as transition metal ions are usually known as effective quenchers of Ln3+ ion luminescence. This is because most d metals typically emit in the NIR. Therefore, most inorganic hosts with high energetic cut-off phonon modes lead to a non-radiative relaxation pathway, especially since the transition metal ions and their expanded 3d, 4d, and 5d orbitals couple well to vibrational modes. However, in the last decade, it has been observed that for some transition metals there is huge potential to be employed as candidates for energy transfer or magnetic exchange interaction processes. It has been shown that doping with certain TMn+ ions is an excellent approach to effectively utilize and modulate the excitation energy of Ln3+ ions, which can improve energy-transfer efficiency for specific applications.26 The first consideration of TMn+ co-doping in a UC system was reported by Cresswell et al.27 in 1978. In their study, Re4+, a 5d3 ion, replaced Yb3+ in the Yb3+-Tm3+ system (yielding a Re4+-Tm3+ system) for blue UC, in the Cs2NaYCl6 host-lattice, with the idea of having a two-photon process instead of a three-photon process. Following that, the UC behaviour of materials where the TMn+ ions were either formula components or dopants was thoroughly researched by Auzel and Güdel et al.2,13 The effects of metals such as Mn2+, Cr3+, Re4+, V3+, Mo3+, Ni2+, and Ti2+ were studied. Even though most TMn+ have large multiphonon relaxation probabilities and luminescence quenching, there are still certain successes in studying the UC of TMn+. This is particularly for those metals with tuneable single band NIR emission, such as Mn2+(3d5) and Cr3+ (3d3), which have relatively large gaps between the adjacent emitting level and ground state, which is desirable for bioimaging. However, when coupled with the metastable energy levels of Ln3+, it is possible to achieve enhanced UC emission or other intriguing UC phenomena.28 The susceptibility of d electrons to the chemical environment can be used to achieve wavelength-tuneable single UC emission in various TMn+ ion-activated systems, which is useful in molecular sensing and lighting. As shown in many reports the UC emissions of Ln3+ can be regulated by TMn+, which benefit from the particular metastable energy levels of Ln3+ due to the well-shielded 4f electrons, as well as the tuneable energy levels of the TMn+.2,13 To date, a variety of transition-metal ions, including Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Mo3+ have been doped into lanthanide UCNPs, with the goal of tuning or improving their UCL properties.
In this review, we investigate and overview in detail how energy is transferred in such Ln3+-TMn+ co-doped materials. We focus on why certain transition metals, and certain concentrations of these metals, are best suited for a particular host matrix. This review provides better knowledge on how transition metals can be used to alter the morphology of lanthanide materials, as well as how to enhance or control their luminescence properties. This knowledge is undeniably beneficial to the inorganic materials chemistry and lanthanide luminescence communities, since this information can be used for developing a variety of novel materials, allowing for improved design and control of their properties.
Mechanisms of transition metal ion co-doping for luminescence enhancement
The significant parameters influencing luminescence efficiency in UC nanostructures are the Ln3+ dopants and the host matric. Dopants, such as sensitizers and activators, offer luminescence centers, whereas host matrices provide a platform for energy transmission between the dopants.4,29 Energy transfer dominates the UCL processes when it comes to complicated upconversion systems (e.g. Ln3+-TMn+ systems).30 When Ln3+ and appropriate TMn+ ions are incorporated in the same host lattice, novel cooperative UC mechanisms involving both ions emerge (see Fig. 2 for a schematic overview of the main roles that TMn+ ion co-dopants play in the host lattices).13 The introduction of TMn+ ion co-doped UCNPs has piqued a lot of interest because of its potential luminescent intensity enhancement and tuning ability. TMn+ ions have a crucial role in increasing the asymmetry around the Ln3+ ions by manipulating the host lattice, resulting in an increase in electronic dipole transitions. Selective TMn+ ions also improve the overall energy transfer efficiency and have the potential to overcome the phonon quenching impact by providing an effective pathway in the energy transfer process.31,32 In the next section we will provide an overview of the key factors that affect the UCL mechanisms. This has been divided into three different categories: transition metal ion co-dopants, host lattice manipulation, and energy transfer modulation.
 Fig. 2  Schematic overview of the main roles transition metals play in host lattices: (A) new emission centers, (B) mediators of crystal field, and (C) energy transfer medium. In all cases the amount of the co-doped transition metal ion has a significant influence on these effects. The scheme has been drawn for NaYF4 co-doped with Mn4+. 
Transition metal ion co-dopants
Co-doping is known to boost UC luminescence efficiency by incorporating atoms or ions of appropriate elements into host lattices to yield hybrid materials with desirable characteristics such as stabilizing a specific crystallographic phase33 or constructing energy transfer.34 Moreover, a change in the metal dopant/co-dopant ions has a significant impact on the UC emission properties of a compound by modulating the color of the emitted light.13 The key source of lanthanide luminescence is the electron transition within the 4fn configuration, which consists of extremely intricate energy levels due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal field interaction. Although the main intra-4f electronic–dipole transitions of Ln3+ are forbidden, nevertheless, combining opposite-parity configurations can cause the selection rule to break down, resulting in weakly allowed electric dipole transitions.35 The probability of electronic dipole transitions is considerably boosted in response to an asymmetric crystal field. As a result, modifying the crystal structure to lower the symmetry around the lanthanides may increase the luminescence emission intensity.32 The improvement of UCL in TMn+ ion co-doped UCNPs is ascribed to the strengthening of the electron–phonon coupling and significantly improved susceptibility to crystal-field and exchange perturbations, since the d orbitals of transition metals have a bigger radial extension than the f orbitals of lanthanides.36 For TMn+ with [Ar]3dn (0 < n < 10) configurations, electrons in the incomplete and unshielded 3d orbitals interact strongly with the surrounding chemicals resulting in a strong crystal field that is comparable to the Coulomb interaction and has a considerable impact on the free-ion energy states.37 Because of the exposure of d electrons, the spectroscopic properties of TMn+ are extremely sensitive to the environment, enhancing their ability to tune excited state features to match the acceptor ions. By introducing TMn+ ions as sensitizers for Ln3+ ions, a new potential enhancer of UC luminescence is established and novel cooperative NIR to visible UC processes are anticipated. Various TMn+ ions with appropriate higher energy levels have been incorporated into Ln3+ doped nanomaterials (often the Yb3+-Er3+ system), culminating in the development of distinctive luminescent characteristics with nearly single-band emission. When TMn+ ions are introduced, d energy levels are actively involved in energy migration with lanthanide ions, enabling the population of different excited states of lanthanide activators to be controlled.38 TMn+ ions such as Mn2+ and Mo2+, co-doped into YbAG:Yb,Er nanoparticles, showed considerably increased UC emissions, with the sensitization mediated through energy transfer from the Yb3+-Mo2+/Mn2+ ionic pair to the activator.39,40 Moreover, upon Mn2+ co-doping into host lattices like α-NaLnF4:Yb/Er (Ln = Lu, Gd), the energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+ ions leads to dominantly single-band enhanced red emission.41 The involvement of transition metals in the energy transfer processes in UCNPs will be discussed in detail in the subchapter ‘Energy transfer modulation’.
In oxide and fluoride host lattices with lanthanide activators, successful examples of boosting upconversion emission have been reported with co-doping TMn+ for the following ions: Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Mo3+.42–49 UC luminescence can be tuned by controlling the doping concentration of the transition metal ions. For instance, Wei et al.50 reported that the strongest UC emission intensity was obtained in Fe3+ co-doped NaGdF4:20 mol%Yb3+,2 mol%Er3+, when the stoichiometric ratio of Fe3+ was 20 mol%. However, when the stoichiometric ratio of Fe3+ exceeded 20 mol%, the UCL decreased. Notably, the incorporation of increased Fe3+ concentrations generated significant lattice distortion, which influenced the spatial distribution of the Ln3+ ions and caused concentration quenching, leading to a reduction in emission intensity. It should however be realized that the small size of co-doped transition metal ions usually leads to stabilization of the cubic α polymorph of NaREF4 (RE = Y, Gd, Lu). It is therefore simple to stabilize α-NaLuF4 at low temperatures as Lu3+ is a small ion. On the other hand, no cubic α polymorph of NaREF4 has been reported to date when the rare earth is larger than Gd3+. Therefore gradual incorporation of small transition metal ions can lead to a phase segregation where both the NaF and α-NaREF4 are formed from the respective β polymorph (when a high doping amount of the transition metal is reached).51 As a result, adding an appropriate quantity of co-dopant TMn+ ion to the host material is crucial for obtaining improved UC emission.
Also, in combined Ln3+-TMn+ compounds, two essentially distinct UC strategies are possible such as Ln3+ sensitized transition metal UC or TMn+ sensitized lanthanide UC. In Ln3+ sensitized TMn+ UC systems, in general, the Yb3+ ion serves as the sensitizer, while Mn2+, Cr3+, and Mn4+ serve as the activators. Moreover, TMn+ ions in these systems have a sufficient energy gap between their energy levels, enabling them to absorb the pumped light and help the UC process. This system is highly relevant for luminescence thermometry because transition metal luminescent centers with efficient deep red or NIR emission can be cooperatively sensitized by Yb3+ to achieve UC emissions. However, in TMn+ sensitized Ln3+ UC systems, the sensitizer is a TMn+ ion, and the UC emitter can either be a Ln3+ or a TMn+ ion. This line of research holds a lot of promise for future applications, such as sensitizing UC with effective broad-band NIR absorbers and could be used in lighting devices. In TMn+ sensitized Ln3+ UC systems, the commonly utilized NIR sensitizer, Yb3+, is ineffective since its 4f–4f absorption band around 1 μm is narrow in all probable hosts.52
Host lattice manipulation
Changing the host lattice can have a significant impact on radiative and nonradiative (multiphonon relaxation and energy transfer) features, resulting in completely distinct UCL behaviour.53 For example, switching from a lattice with high phonon energies (oxides) to one with low phonon energies (chlorides, bromides, iodides, fluorides) might reduce the efficiency of multiphonon relaxation processes.54,55 Choosing a host with appropriate optical and/or magnetic qualities might affect the UC emission properties of a dopant ion by sensitizing or perturbing it via exchange interactions.56 Thus, the choice of host lattice opens up a wide range of opportunities for developing compounds with novel properties. Given their crucial role in influencing the surrounding habitats of dopant ions, such as spatial distance, coordination numbers, and energy transfer efficiency, UCL efficiency is directly tied to the host matrix. A large number of suitable hosts doped with transition-metal ions (3d, 4d, 5d) were investigated by Gudel and co-workers to show upconversion luminescence, for example Ti+,57 V3+,58 Cr3+,59 Mn2+,60 Ni2+,56,61 Mo3+,62,63Re4+,64,65 or Os4+66 doped or co-doped alongside Ln3+ in various halide compounds.
Besides selecting various host matrixes, a host lattice may also undergo distinct modifications when co-doped with metal ions with varying radii. For homo-valence ion co-doping, the crystal lattice will shrink when small TMn+ ions are co-doped and will expand when large TMn+ ions are co-doped to replace the host ions. Whereas, when the co-dopants have different valences, than the substituted host ions, due to the requirement of charge compensation, extra vacancies or interstitial ions are introduced into the host lattices during nucleation and growth. Therefore, different sized ions can significantly impact the coordination environment and crystal field splitting of the lanthanides. Hence, introducing TMn+ ions can change the crystal field and the surrounding environment of Ln3+ ions. As a result of this approach, the electron distribution density may vary. A change in the surroundings of the Ln3+ ions could induce hypersensitive electron transitions which boosts the UCL.67 For example, Hu et al.68 reported that in the NaYF4 crystal lattice, Mn2+ (0.81 Å)/Fe3+ (0.64 Å) ions were small enough to replace Y3+ (0.89 Å), so when Y3+ ions were replaced with an optimal concentration of Mn2+/Fe3+ ions, the resulting size mismatch caused the lattice to shrink, lowering the crystal symmetry around the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions, which is advantageous for breaking the forbidden transitions of the lanthanide ions, leading to an increase in the luminescence intensity of Er3+.
TMn+ ion co-doping has been reported to have a significant impact on the growth of a variety of functional materials. For example, Mn2+ co-doping alters the growth dynamics and allows for simultaneous control of the crystalline phase and size of the resultant NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UC nanoparticles synthesized with a modified liquid-solid solution solvothermal approach. Without the addition of Mn2+ as the co-dopant the obtained product is a mixture of the cubic and hexagonal phases. After a significant amount of Mn2+ is co-doped into the material, the hexagonal phase transforms into the cubic phase (Fig. 3).26 Also, in NaLnF4:Yb/Er (Ln = Lu, Yb, Gd) UC nanoparticles, similar phase transformation phenomena (hexagonal (β) phase to cubic (α) phase) were found, with simultaneous phase/size control and considerably improved UC intensity, caused by Mn2+ co-doping.69 Furthermore, Wang et al.70 proposed that Cu2+ ion co-doping induces simultaneous crystal phase transformation from YF3 to α-NaYF4 to (α + β)-NaYF4. Moreover, Wang et al.41 reported that the crystal phase of NaErF4:Yb NPs changed from hexagonal to cubic, then leading to the formation of a new orthorhombic phase, NaMn3F10 with increasing concentration of Mn2+. In addition, they showed that with increasing Mn2+ dopant content, the morphology of NaErF4:Yb was tuned from nanodisks to nanocubes and then to large nanoflakes.
 Fig. 3  TEM image of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ (18:2 mol%) nanoparticles (A) without Mn2+ dopant ions and (B) with 30 mol% Mn2+co-doping. The effect of transition metal co-doping on nanomaterial morphology is very clearly visualized here (reprinted with permission from ref. 26 Copyright 2012, Wiley Materials). 
The optical characteristics of TMn+ doped UC nanoparticles are also known to be influenced by variations in the crystal structure of the host materials. For example, Zhou, et al.71 observed that, unlike the lower-lying excited state of octahedral VIMn in cubic NaLnF4 (Ln = Y, Gd, Lu) which enhances red UC luminescence selectively, the high-lying excited state of tetrahedral IVMn in tetragonal LiYF4 boost the probability of both green and red UC luminescence. Moreover, a significant red to green intensity ratio of Er3+ emission band tuning can be achieved in cubic phase NaYF4 nanoparticles rather than hexagonal microtubes by varying the quantities of Mn2+ ions. This is caused by the fact that hexagonal-phase NaYF4 has better polarizability than cubic phase NaYF4, and hence is not more compatible with Mn2+ ions.72
Energy transfer modulation
The Stokes law, which basically asserts that the energy level of the excitation photons is greater than that of the emitted photons, is generally followed by all fluorescence light emitters. However, when lanthanides or transition metal ions are imbedded in materials, they can easily deviate from the above principle given a sufficiently powered excitation, resulting in anti-Stokes UC emissions. Energy transfer is a multi-ion phenomenon. Energy is transferred in a system where absorption and emission do not occur in the same center. This can occur even if there is no charge transportation. As a result, there is a distinction between radiative and nonradiative energy transfer, as well as resonant and phonon-assisted energy transfer. Energy transfer between two given ions cannot boost efficiency by itself because it consists of the product of two processes with intrinsic efficiency less than or equal to 1; it can only provide a new excitation wavelength range with a reduced efficiency. Therefore, the overall efficiency improvement caused by energy transfer can only be obtained by spatial averaging as a result of the macroscopic diffusion process.73 To limit nonradiative energy loss and enhance radiative emission during a UC process, a host lattice with low phonon energy is usually required.32 Moreover, because the prohibited transition would result in poor absorption and emission of Ln3+ and TMn+ ions, efficient Ln3+ and TMn+ luminescence usually necessitates energy transfer sensitization, which plays a significant role in tuning and optimizing the optical characteristics of Ln3+ and TMn+ co-doped luminescent nanoparticles.74
Unlike the intra-4fN transitions, the oscillator strengths of hypersensitive transition change sensitively to a small change of the surrounding environment. Hence, a hypersensitive transition can be induced by changing the environment around rare-earth ions by co-doping TMn+ ions.75 As the UC luminescence intensity of lanthanide ions is mainly dependent on electronic transition probabilities, as a result, increasing the probability of hypersensitive transition will be significant for enhancing the luminescence intensity of UCNPs.
More significantly, the d–d electronic transitions of metal ions may be involved in the energy transfer between activators and sensitizers in the host lattice, which is considered to be an efficient energy transfer pathway. For example, Wang et al.76 proposed that the efficient forward and backward energy transfer between Er3+/Ho3+/Tm3+ and Mn2+ at different energy levels is responsible for the single band emissions of Er3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+ in KMnF3. Similar observations of single-band emission were also reported in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ or NaY(Lu)F4:Yb3+/Eu3+ nanoparticles by Mn2+ co-doping.26,77–79 In general, the first excited level 4T1(4G) of Mn2+, which lies between the red and green emitting states of Er3+, is substantially accountable for single-band red emission (Fig. 4), which causes red emission to be enhanced while green emission is suppressed. Furthermore, the effect of photon energy modulation has also been observed for other TMn+ ions such as Fe3+, where in Fe3+ co-doped Na(Ln)F4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles, the surrounding environment of Er3+ could be tailored through co-doping small radius Fe3+ ions. The change in the surrounding of Ln3+ ions can induce a hypersensitive electron transition, resulting in an increase in Er3+ luminescence intensity.80,81

Synthesis methods for obtaining transition metal doped lanthanide upconversion materials
Several parameters influence the UC photoluminescence efficiency and/or emission wavelength of UCNPs, including size, size distribution, shape, crystalline phase, and purity.33 It is worth noting here that the selected procedure used for the synthesis of UC nanoparticles has an influence on how TMn+ co-dopants affect the symmetry of the host lattice. For example, when utilizing a hydrothermal method, the hexagonal NaYF4 became cubic after raising the Fe3+ concentration.80 However, even with a high Fe3+ concentration, the crystal structure of the NaGdF4 host lattice is impervious to the thermal decomposition method.82 Therefore, TMn+ co-doped UC nanoparticles have been synthesized using a range of chemical processes, such as co-precipitation, thermal decomposition, hydrothermal synthesis and combustion synthesis to address specific needs. These methods have been overviewed below.
Co-Precipitation method
The co-precipitation route is a simple and rapid method for producing ultrasmall UCNPs where the particle size can be controlled by the reaction temperature. In a few circumstances, it has been observed that crystalline nanoparticles can be made directly via co-precipitation synthesis, without the additional need for heat treatment. For example, Xia et al.83 prepared a monodisperse high-performance multi-modality imaging contrast agent Co2+-co-doped Yb3+,Tm3+ nanorods by a co-precipitation method under an argon atmosphere at a temperature of 300 °C for 1 h, which showed dual contrast enhancement of both NIR-to-NIR UCL imaging and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Also, to investigate the temperature sensing performance and enhancement of UCL, Mahata et al.84 used the coprecipitation method to synthesize BaTiO3:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles doped with Zn2+ with particle sizes within 40–60 nm. Furthermore, UCNPs doped with TMn+ ions such as Fe3+82 and Mo3+44 were synthesized using a co-precipitation approach using oleic acid as the coordinating ligand and 1-octadecene as the non-coordinating solvent to explore the enhancement of UCL and its application in bioimaging.
Thermal decomposition method
The thermal decomposition approach relies on the temporal separation of nucleation and crystal growth, which is accomplished by gradually adding precursors to the solution and then altering the temperature. Although it necessitates the preparation of precursors, this synthesis is relatively quick and simple. For the synthesis of highly monodispersed UCNPs, thermal decomposition is used, which involves dissolving organic precursors in high-boiling-point solvents (e.g., oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OM), and 1-octadecene (ODE)).85 For instance, Mikalauskaite and co-workers86 presented a decomposition approach for the preparation of upconverting NaGdF4 nanoparticles doped with Yb3+, Er3+, and Cr3+ ions that were produced by heating a combination of chloride precursors in OA/ODE. According to their studies, they observed that brighter red emission was obtained when samples were co-doped with higher concentrations of Cr3+ ions. Moreover, Zhu et al.87 proposed a trifluoroacetate thermolysis approach to synthesize LiYF4:Yb3+,Er3+(Tm3+) UC nanoparticles co-doped with different concentrations of Cd2+ ions to give uniform diamond-shaped structures with good dispersibility.
Hydrothermal method
The purpose of hydrothermal synthesis is to generate UCNPs with controlled crystal sizes and good dispersibility in solutions. The hydrothermal process is a heterogeneous reaction in aqueous media at pressures and temperatures above its critical point to boost solid solubility and speed up solid–solid reactions that are difficult to dissolve under normal circumstances.88 The capacity to form highly crystalline phases at considerably lower temperatures is one of the potential advantages of this method over other synthetic procedures. For example, Hu et al.68 used a hydrothermal approach at 180 °C for 5 h to develop monodisperse Mn2+/Fe3+ co-doped NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+nanoparticles. In their study, these UCNPs were homogeneous and spherical in shape and could be utilized to boost red UCL intensity, making UCNPs useful diagnostic imaging tools. Another interesting development was reported by Dong et al.89 who utilized the hydrothermal method for the synthesis of Er3+-Mo3+, Tm3+-Mo3+ co-doped Yb3Al5O12 (YbAG) which are well crystallized with average particle sizes ranging from 40 to 80 nm. This Er(Tm)-Yb-Mo system has a high UC efficiency, making it suitable for applications like temperature sensing and in vivo imaging. Furthermore, NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ with enhanced (UCL) was successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method by co-doping with Cu2+ ions90 or Ni2+ ions.42 However, the hydrothermal approach has several drawbacks, such as the requirement for specialized reaction vessels known as autoclaves, and the inability to observe the nanoparticles as they grow. Autoclaves are made up of thick-walled steel cylinders and a Teflon chamber that can survive high pressure and solvent corrosion.
Combustion method
Unlike hydrothermal procedures, which often require heating for many days at high temperatures to complete a synthesis, combustion synthesis uses controlled explosions in reactions to produce reaction products in minutes. Highly exothermic reactions with temperatures ranging from 500 to 3000 °C occur in the form of a combustion wave that propagates through the reaction materials in a self-sustaining way without requiring further heat once triggered by a heat source. It is one of the most appealing approaches for synthesizing a wide range of oxide and oxysulfide UCNPs.16 For example, Dey et al.91 reported the synthesis of Y2O3:Nd3+ phosphor co-doped with Yb3+ and Zn2+ through a low temperature combustion process for efficient UC emission in the green region. However, this approach exhibits significant particle aggregation.
Characterization techniques used for the detection of transition metal ion co-dopants in lanthanide upconversion materials
When introducing TMn+ co-dopants into an inorganic host there is always the possibility that they will not build into the host matrix, which is why it is crucial to thoroughly investigate the presence of these metal ions. In this chapter we investigate the different techniques that are commonly used for this. To comprehensively examine the presence of TMn+ ions in various matrices atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are frequently used. ICP spectroscopy allows simultaneous assessments of all periodic-table elements, with a lower limit of detectability in the parts-per-billion range, while AAS can quantify the amounts of individual metals contained in a substance or its extract. When combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) or wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can reveal topographic images and elemental information. The combination of imaging and X-ray analysis is critical for identifying small particles. Elemental analysis utilizing SEM/EDX or SEM/WDS is beneficial for determining elemental content in a qualitative or semi-quantitative manner, as well as to establish a correlation between microstructures and elemental composition. For example, by using the EDX spectrum, Duet et al.81 confirmed that Er3+,Yb3+,Fe3+ tri-doped NaBiF4 nanoparticles contained the elements Na, Bi, F, Er, Yb, and Fe. Furthermore, the results of the elemental mapping showed that the elements present in the produced compounds were distributed evenly throughout the nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study the chemical states, binding energy, bonding information, and stoichiometry of the constituents in a compound. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique is used to study grain size, solid solubility, phase formation, lattice orientation, residual stress, and the presence of unknown components. For example, to confirm the presence and study the distribution of Cu2+ ions in the NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ system, Du et al.90 combined several of these techniques. In their study. XPS was used to confirm that Ln3+ and Cu2+ ions were successfully incorporated into the NaYF4 host material. Whereas inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry elemental analysis (ICP–OES) was used to determine the concentration of doped Cu2+ ions. Through the XRD technique, they determined that when the Cu2+ ion concentration is increased to 60 mol%, a significant amount of Cu2+ ions occupy the interstitial sites, which may cause the host lattice to expand, resulting in an increase in the unit-cell volume and interplanar distance, and thus the (100) peak shifts to the lower-angle side (Fig. 5A). In addition, the presence of Na, F, Y, Yb, Er, and Cu elements in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3 was fully evident in high angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images with elemental mapping (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, Qiang et al.92 reported that the diffraction peak shifts slightly to a higher angle when Mn2+ is added to the NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ system. This is due to Mn2+ replacing Gd3+ in the NaGdF4 host, which results in a reduction in unit cell volume. Furthermore, investigation using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) showed the existence of Na, Gd, and doped Yb, Mn elements, confirming the substitution by Mn2+.

In addition, the morphology and size control of the NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ samples were demonstrated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealing that the NaGdF4:Yb,Er sample showed irregular shapes, whereas the NaGdF4:Yb,3+Er3+,5% Mn2+ sample was almost uniformly hexagonal-shaped. Likewise, Zhou et al.71 were able to determine evidence of the incorporation of Mn2+ into the LiYF4 lattices by substituting Y3+ in Mn2+ doped LiYF4:Yb3+,Er3+UC nanoparticles through XPS and ICP-AES analysis.
Enhancing upconversion intensity and tunable emission through transition metal ion co-doping
In general, the electron-phonon coupling effect for d electrons in TMn+ ions is greater than for f electrons in Ln3+, leading to a substantial nonradiative transition possibility for TMn+ ions.93 The emission levels for Mn2+ (3d5) and Cr3+ (3d3) ions are usually the first excited states (4T1 and 4T2 or 2E, respectively), with huge gaps above the ground states (about 10000–20000 cm−1). The enormous gap reduces the possibility of multiphonon relaxation. However, for resonant energy transfer, a significant gap without a metastable energy level that complements the excited state 2F5/2 of Yb3+ at 10000 cm−1 necessitates cooperative sensitisation or an exchange-coupled Yb3+-TMn+ dimer model.13,94 Inspired by this, Wang et al.95 reported that, when Yb3+, Mn2+, and Eu3+ ions were introduced to the fluoride hosts (NaY(Lu)F4), Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers formed readily. Under a 980 nm continuous wave laser diode excitation, the energy harvested by the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers were effectively transferred from the excited state |2F7/2, 4T1> of the Yb3+–Mn2+ dimers to the 5D0 energy level of Eu3+ ions to generate strong Eu3+ UC emission. Multiple emission peaks and low chromatic colour purity are common with Ln3+ ions because they have more than one metastable excited state energy level. Likewise, Han et al.96 proposed that in the Yb3+,Mn2+,Eu3+ tri-doped fluoride KCdF3, high Eu3+ UC emission is achieved by regulated and efficient unidirectional energy transfer from Yb3+-Mn2+ dimers and the emission color can be well-tuned from yellow to orange by adjusting the concentration of Eu3+, eventually obtaining the pure red UC of Eu3+. In addition, the Yb3+-Fe3+ dimer was produced in the Yb3+,Er3+,Fe3+ tri-doped NaYF4 host lattice, which could be used to regulate the energy transfer between activators and sensitizers, for selectively enhanced red emission.80 Mn2+ doping enhances the intensity of UC emission and facilitates the single band feature of red emission, which emerges from a change in the surrounding environment of Ln3+ ions and the energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+. For example, Wang et al.41 reported that with Mn2+ co-doping, NaErF4:Yb3+ UC nanoparticles show a stronger single-band red emission. In their investigation, they demonstrated that the red to green ratio (R/G) of NaErF4:Yb3+ nanoparticles exhibited a trend of being significantly increased from 19 to 367 after co-doping Mn2+ (see Fig. 6). This could be ascribed to the successive non-radiative energy transfer from the 2H9/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ to the 4T1 level of Mn2+, followed by back-energy-transfer to the 4F9/2 level of Er3+. When the dopant concentration of Mn2+ reached 30%, the luminescence intensity of the single-band red emission of NaErF4:Yb3+,30% Mn2+ is 2.3 times stronger than that of the Mn-free samples. Improved single-band red emission could be beneficial for optical bioimaging, specifically in vivo optical bioimaging for deeper tissue penetration. Moreover, Wang et al.70 proposed that compared to Cu-free microcrystals, YF3:Yb3+,Er3+ microcrystals co-doped with Cu2+ ions boost UV/violet, green, and red UC emissions by 6.6/6.6, 10 and 7 times, respectively. Importantly, Cu2+ ion co-doping in Ln3+-doped nanoparticles to improve UCL offers a wide range of applications in sensors, solar cells, and photocatalysis. Furthermore, Nannuri et al.97 reported that the NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles co-doped with Cr3+ ions at a concentration of 10–15% and post-annealed at 600 °C were found to be most effective in improving the upconversion luminescence with an enhancement factor of 24 for the green region and 33 for the red region. Under the excitation of a 980 nm continuous wave (CW) laser, Yb3+/Ho3+/Mn2+ tri-doped CaF2 microspheres exhibit green-yellow-red tuning colors and outstanding improvement of both red to green ratio (R/G) and red to blue ratio (R/B) when the Mn2+ concentration was varied from 0 to 30 mol%.98 In addition, incorporating Mn2+ ions as a co-dopant allows for a multicolor output of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ ranging from yellow to red. Besides that, enhancing the Mn2+ concentration from 0% to 30% resulted in a remarkable improvement in the red to green emission (R/G) ratio from 1.79 to 10.71.99

The insets of (A) are the corresponding digital photographs of the NaErF4:Yb3+,Mn2+ (X = 0, 5, 20, and 30) nanocrystals dispersed in cyclohexane solution. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 41.

To further strengthen the luminescence efficiency, significant effort is required to prevent mutual quenching when controlling the spatial distribution of TMn+ and Ln3+ ions to a given distance, such as by developing a core-shell structure. For example, the generation of photon upconversion through Mn2+ co-doped NaGdF4:Yb/Tm@NaGdF4 core–shell nanoparticles can be obtained by utilizing energy migration through the gadolinium sublattice (Yb → Tm → Gd → Mn). By varying the power density of the excitation source, these UCNPs could lead to an enriched color output ranging from whitish-blue to bright green.100 Modification of lattice parameters and particle sizes, among other effects, are also thought to contribute to improved luminescence. For example, the insertion of Zn2+ into the matrix, either at the host-metal location (e.g., Gd3+ 105.3 pm) or at an interstitial site near the Ln3+, results in a change in lattice characteristics due to its small size. Photon absorption and energy transfer properties are improved as a result of the change in crystal field splitting at the Ln3+ location. As a result, using Zn2+ as a substitutional dopant at Gd3+ sites reduce the cell volume significantly, improving optical performance.47,101
Extremely effective UC emissions can be obtained by incorporating a specific concentration of transition metal ion co-dopants into a specific host matrix nanoparticle. This has been overviewed in Table 1.

Improvement of magnetic properties in lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles through transition metal ion co-doping
The magnetic moment of an atom is generated by intra-atomic or Hund's rules exchange, which favors parallel spin alignment on an atomic scale. Furthermore, ferromagnetism necessitates inter-atomic exchange in order to ensure that the moments of nearby atoms are aligned in a parallel manner.102 The magnetic behaviour of free ions, whether TMn+ or Ln3+ ions, arises as a result of spin-spin, orbital-orbital, and spin-orbital interactions. In TMn+ ions like Fe3+, Co2+, and Ni3+, the magnetic moment due to unpaired electron spins is more efficiently aligned parallel to the external magnetic field, resulting in an exceptionally strong reinforcement of paramagnetism. And these TMn+ ions are termed as ferromagnetism. Cr3+ and Mn2+, on the other hand, exhibit antiferromagnetism, in which neighbouring electron spins align themselves antiparallel to the external magnetic field.
Moreover, the spectroscopic properties of a TMn+ can be significantly influenced by magnetic interactions.103 Magnetic exchange interactions are more easily formed in TMn+ than in Ln3+ systems, because of the smaller orbital shielding, and such effects may be substantially more evident in mixed TMn+-Ln3+ UC systems.53 The susceptibility of the d electrons of TMn+ ions may enable them to magnetically interact with each other or Ln3+ ions, leading to novel multifunctional physical processes. The optical and magnetic properties of nanoparticles containing a combination of strongly para-magnetic d and f metal ions have attracted the attention of researchers. In particular, the combination of rare-earth ions (RE3+) and Mn2+ in UCNP systems.104–106 For instance, Wang et al.107 reported that Mn2+ co-doping can enable NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles to exhibit superparamagnetic properties. In their studies, they showed that as the concentration of Mn2+ ion increases, the paramagnetic property (due to Gd3+) changes, causing a transition from a paramagnetic to a super-paramagnetic state. The unpaired inner electrons have a major role in the paramagnetic behavior, where Mn2+ possesses five unpaired inner 3d orbital electrons that are bound to the nucleus and successfully shielded from the crystal by the outer closed shell electrons. Furthermore, the unpaired inner 3d orbital electrons of Mn2+ are closer to the nucleus than the unpaired inner 4f orbital electrons of Gd3+, enabling it to be shielded from the crystal field more efficiently by the outer closed shell electrons and having a greater magnetic moment. This finding suggested that UCNPs co-doped with Mn2+ could be used as a magnetic resonance probe. Moreover, Tian et al.26 demonstrated that because Mn2+ is a paramagnetic ion, introducing it to NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs modifies the magnetic response of the energy level in Mn2+. As a result, it changes the nonradiative transition processes of the samples, which can be attributed to this stable characteristic of the Mn2+ doped UCNPs. These findings could be used to develop multi-functional rare earth nanoparticles with a high energy transfer efficiency and good magnetic and optical properties. Likewise, Xia et al.83 proposed that NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanorods co-doped with Co2+ can be used as a high-performance dual contrast agent for T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) and UCL dual-modality imaging. Furthermore, Yin et al.44 reported that due to the presence of three unpaired 4d electrons bonded to the nucleus, Mo3+ has a significant magnetic moment and generates paramagnetic behavior in the nanoparticles. Moreover, doping nanomaterials with TMn+ ions like Cr3+ can provide UCNPs with exceptional paramagnetic characteristics.108
The influence of transition metal ion co-doping on upconversion luminescence thermometry and optical heating
Thermometers based on the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) are more reliable and have higher temperature sensitivity than thermometers based on other parameters such as peak position, luminescent lifetimes, single emission band intensity, and bandwidth. FIR allows precise temperature measurements, which are not affected by external interferences, spectral losses, and fluctuations in the excitation density. The sensitivity of a sensor using this ratiometric approach is substantially influenced by the energy gap of thermally coupled levels (TCL), which is constrained to a range of 200–2000 cm−1. The thermally coupled energy levels are present in Dy3+ (4F9/2, 4I15/2), Er3+ (2H11/2, 4S3/2), Ho3+ (5F2,3/3K8, 5G6/4F1), Tm3+ (3F2,3, 3H4) and Nd3+ (4F7/2, 4F3/2) ions, based on the energy level distribution of the Ln3+ ions. The Er3+ ion is studied most extensively for optical temperature sensors due to its distinctive green UC emissions and appropriate energy separation.117 Luminescent thermometers based on the transition metal and lanthanide co-doped nanoparticles have grown in popularity due to their high sensitivity to temperature changes. Recent studies have shown that transition metal d–f emission thermometry is more sensitive than traditional f–f transitions in rare-earth ions. For luminescent thermometers, the strong temperature luminescence intensity dependency of Mn4+ and Cr3+ ion emissions (3d3 electronic configuration) in several host materials have been studied. However, in this review we will only focus on thermometers based on a lanthanide UC system co-doped with TMn+ ions. Mn4+ ions co-doped into inorganic host materials like oxides and fluorides exhibit lower Racah parameter (β) values compared to those incorporating Cr3+ centers with the same ligands. However, in doped solids, the higher metal oxidation state (Mn4+) leads to a stronger nephelauxetic effect, which reduces the mutual repulsion between d-electrons and lowers the energy of the emissive 2E state, resulting in lower β values.118 For systems to shift emissions into the desirable NIR range, it must exhibit low β values.119 Because of its very strong red emission, the Mn4+ ion is one of the most intriguing of all TMn+ ions when it comes to luminescence applications. Mn4+ with three electrons in the unoccupied 3d shell is usually stabilized at the octahedral site when doped into oxides, fluorides, and other host lattices. It possesses strong broad excitation bands in the UV (300–400 nm), blue (400–500 nm), or deep red (630–750 nm) emission region. Mn4+ ions, which favour octahedral sites, have a high crystal field strength (CFS) due to their high positive effective charge. This crystal field has no effect on where the emission band is located, but it does influence the rate at which it is thermally quenched.93 Chen, Daqin, et al.120 developed a strategy for achieving Mn4+-based room-temperature near-infrared upconversion luminescence via efficient energy transfer of the Yb3+ → Ln3+ → Mn4+ system in specially synthesized Yb3+/Ln3+/Mn4+ (Ln = Er, Ho, Tm): YAlO3. According to their findings, yttrium orthoaluminate (YAlO3, YAP) was chosen as the host material due to its suitability for incorporating both Ln3+ and Mn4+ dopants, as well as the appropriate ligand-field environment for efficient energy transfer from Ln3+ to Mn4+. The relative temperature sensitivities (Sr) were determined to be as high as 1.95% K−1 based on Mn4+/Er3+ UC FIR at 530 K and 1.19% K−1 based on Mn4+ UC decay at 525 K, respectively. The introduction of the TMn+ may change the thermometric performance of the phosphor, increasing its sensitivity to temperature changes. For example, the Sr for CaWO4:Er3+,Yb3+ increased from 1.36% °C−1 to 1.91% °C−1 with the addition of Cr3+. This effect was discussed in terms of efficient energy transfer between the Er3+, Yb3+, and Cr3+ ions.121 Furthermore, the temperature sensing characteristics were also improved with Mn2+ co-doping. For example, Mn2+ co-doped into NaGdF4:Yb3+/Er3+ exhibits strong sensing sensitivity, with a maximum absolute temperature sensitivity (Sa) of 0.0043 K−1 at 523 K.92 In addition, Peng, Yan, et al.122 reported that by co-doping KLu2F7:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles with Mn2+ ions the nanoparticles exhibited not only improved upconversion emission, but also presented a better performance in temperature sensing by changing the crystal field around Er3+ and the maximum Sa of KLu2F7:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles doped with 8% Mn2+ was 45.11 × 10−3 K−1. Cui et al.123 reported that the addition of the Mn2+ co-dopant into the KMnF3:Yb3+,Er3+ system allows thermal coupling between the 4F9/2 and 4S3/2 states, increasing the sensitivity of green to red emission intensity ratio-based luminescent thermometry up to 5.7% °C−1 at 30 °C. Zhao, Yan, et al.124 presented a co-doped Ho3+/Cr3+ tungstate material with an absolute sensitivity of 0.0217 K−1 over the temperature range of 163–663 K. This novel high-sensitivity UC temperature sensor opened a new field of optical temperature measurement and demonstrated the use of the linear sensitivity effect in sensing applications. Sushil et al.125 revealed that the temperature sensing properties could be enhanced by doping Gd2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals with Zn2+ and 0.0116 K−1 has been reported as the maximum sensitivity. On the other hand, it has also been reported by some researchers that the addition of Cr3+ may have a negative impact on Yb3+,Er3+-based thermometers. Mikalauskaite et al.86 reported that introducing Cr3+ ions into the NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ reduced the relative sensitivity of 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 based thermometer.
Furthermore, it has also been observed that in UCNPs, TMn+ co-doping can induce an outstanding optical heating behavior. For example, the Mn2+, Er3+, Yb3+ co-doped NaGdF4 phosphor generated somewhat higher optical heat as a result of laser power density compared with the Er3+–Yb3+ doped NaGdF4 phosphor. As a result of Mn2+ co-doping, the energy absorbed by the sample may increase slightly. The non-radiative relaxing process, as well as the crystalline nature of the synthesized materials, are well known for generating heat inside the sample. When energy is not fully utilized in the radiative transitions, the extra energy is converted into phonon-assisted non-radiative transitions, leading to an increase in temperature. Hence, the Mn2+, Er3+, Yb3+ co-doped NaGdF4 NPs are not only a potential candidate for optical heaters, but also produce temperature within the recommended range based on hyperthermia treatment, making it suitable for local hyperthermia-based cancer treatment due to the excellent capability of rapid photo-thermal conversion.126 Also Du et al.81 reported that Fe3+ doped NaBiF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles have the ability to transform the excitation light source into heat, making them ideal for use as optical heaters in cancer therapy.
Biological applications
The significant tissue absorption of short-wavelength light below 600 nm has impeded the application of UCNPs, especially for in vivo applications. As a result, a strategy for achieving single-band red emission is crucial for bioimaging to overcome these limitations. In recent years, the introduction of the TMn+ into UCNPs has significantly improved their emission, allowing for a wide range of applications ranging from the biomedical to electro-optic fields, and especially focusing on bio-applications. For example, due to considerable red UC emission, Hu et al.68 revealed that TMn+ (Mn2+ or Fe3+) co-doped NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs may be explored for a variety of purposes, such as promising bio-labels for in vivo imaging, tissue imaging applications, and as potential drug carriers for intracellular drug delivery, emphasizing their potential as a multifunctional nanoplatform for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy. In addition, the other benefit of TMn+ ions like Mn2+ co-doping is that these paramagnetic ions are able to provide a second imaging capacity as a magnetic resonance imaging probe.26 Another interesting development was reported by Xiang et al.,127 who obtained the strongest red luminescence with an enhancement factor of 7.5 times in NaScF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles upon co-doping with 10% Mn2+ ions. In their studies, NaScF4:Yb3+,Er3+,10% Mn2+ showed outstanding temperature sensing performances within the physiological temperature region. The red and NIR emission of these nanoparticles had penetration depths of at least 3 mm and 5 mm, respectively. As a result of the intense red UC emission and ultrasensitive NIR optical thermometer, these nanoparticles perform as a potential bi-functional nanoprobe that can be employed for bioimaging and temperature sensing in deep tissue. Likewise, NaErF4:Yb3+,Mn2+ UCNPs with improved single-band red emission could be useful in optical bioimaging, particularly in vivo optical bioimaging for deeper tissue penetration.41 Luo et al.128 designed core@shell Fe3O4@NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+,Mn2+ nanoparticles which can be utilized as dual-mode T1/T2-weighted MRI due to the coexistence of Fe3O4 and Mn2+ in the host matrix. Amphiphilic polymer (C18PMH–mPEG) coated Fe3O4@NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+,Mn2+ nanoparticles showed acceptable biocompatibility after 24 hours of incubation at concentrations ranging from 0.0625 to 1 mg mL−1. Even at a high concentration of 1 mg mL−1, the cell viability exceeded 78% (Fig. 7A). In addition, the material could be used for in vivo NIR-to-NIR imaging (Fig. 7B). As a result, these core@shell multifunctional nanoparticles combine the advantages of magnetic-induced drug delivery, NIR-to-NIR UCL, and MRI contrast agents and could aid anticancer therapy. Furthermore, Rao et al.129 demonstrated that the small-sized (sub-10 nm) BaLaF5 UCNPs co-doped with 20% Mn2+ could be utilized as effective nanoprobes for dual-modal UC luminescence/X-ray bioimaging with non-autofluorescence and improved lung disease detection.

Moreover, it has been shown that transition metal co-doped UCNPs can be used as fluorescent probes for the detection of heavy metal ions and biomolecules. For example, Zhang et al.130 found a ≥100 enhancement in the normally weak blue-band emission of 7 mol% Zn2+ co-doped NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles, which could be a promising fluorescent probe for detecting Cu2+ ions. In addition, for the determination of H2O2 and uric acid (UA), a label-free fluorescence method was developed by Zhou et al.131 According to their research, this sensor can detect UA with a low detection limit and can be used to detect UA levels in human serum. This sensor could be a new viable platform for clinical assays. In general, TMn+ ion co-doped nanomaterials with emission in the first biological window (NIR-I: 650–950 nm) and especially in the second and third biological windows (NIR-II: 1000–1350 nm, NIR-III: 1550–1870 nm) are attracting attention in new applications of luminescence thermometry and in bioimaging. NIR light in the second and third biological windows is becoming widely attractive because it improves the penetration depth into biological tissues, image contrast, and phototoxicity and photobleaching as compared to traditional illumination.
Anti-counterfeiting applications
The emission color of luminescent materials is important in encoding information for anti-counterfeiting and optical multiplexing.8,132 Ln3+ based UCNPs are highly suitable for such applications due to their long luminescence lifetime, a large anti-Stokes shift and distinguishable spectroscopic fingerprint.33,133 However, despite these remarkable advances, conventional UCNPs have a limited capacity for information storage or the complexity to prevent counterfeiting.93,134 TMn+ ions emerge as a competitive alternative to Ln3+ dopants for temporal encoding owing to their significantly longer lifetimes.135 For example, Liu et al.104 demonstrate that combining long-lived Mn2+ upconversion emission with relatively short-lived lanthanide upconversion emission enables the development of binary temporal codes for efficient data encoding useful for multilevel anti-counterfeiting. In their studies, they showed that UCNPs possessing binary color scales can be obtained by spatially controlled co-doping of Mn2+ ions into a hexagonal-phased NaLnF4 lattice. Because of the spin-forbidden transition character of the transition metal with a 3d5 configuration, it can act as a long-lived emission center within lanthanide-based host lattices. When the Mn2+ dopants are excited at 980 nm, their dual-mode luminescence at 531 nm exhibits lifetimes of more than 30 ms. The long lifetime of dual-mode Mn2+ luminescence aids the capacity to build various up- and down-conversion time-domain optical characteristics for multilayer anti-counterfeiting and multiplexed biolabeling.136
Conclusions
In this review, we have provided an overview of the recent findings and current state of knowledge in the field of transition metal co-doped lanthanide nanomaterials, with a focus on upconversion nanomaterials. The co-doping of transition metals into upconversion nanoparticles has been investigated in terms of mechanism, synthesis, methods to boost upconversion luminescence, as well as certain applications. We have also given a number of representative examples to show the various characteristics of transition doped upconversion nanoparticles in significant detail. Due to their intriguing applications for background-free biosensing, TMn+-co-doped UC luminescent nanoparticles have attracted renewed interest in recent years. Despite the advances and huge potential, several substantial obstacles still need to be resolved. To begin with, better UC materials, with higher quantum yields are still strongly recommended. To date, despite all the efforts with transition metal co-doping, still materials known to have the highest quantum yields are purely lanthanide doped UC materials. However, the fact that quantum yield measurements are seldomly performed for UC materials may be the cause of this. It is possible that these data have just not been collected and reported. On the other hand, chemical stability, biocompatibility, dispersibility, and long-term toxicity are still known challenges that should be extensively taken into account during the development of UC nanomaterials both with and without transition metal co-dopants. Last, but not least, there is still room for more imaginative and innovative research work that allows researchers to be creative with the mechanism and applications of these nanomaterials. Despite these limitations, the appealing electrical and magnetic properties of TMn+ make TMn+ co-doped UCNPs ideal in applications involving multifunctional nanoplatforms, such as for simultaneous diagnostics and therapy. Yet, a good understanding of how TMn+ co-dopants affect UC properties is crucial for any further implementations.

Sonali Mohanty
	Sonali Mohanty is currently a 2nd year PhD student at the NanoSensing Group at Ghent University in Belgium. She is carrying out her studies under the supervision of Prof. Kaczmarek. Currently, she is working on developing different approaches to synthesize hollow hybrid nanothermometers for simultaneous drug delivery. Previously, she obtained an MSc in Analytical Chemistry from the National Institute of Technology Warangal (NITW) in India. Following her MSc, she joined the Special Centre for Nanoscience as a research assistant at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi in India.

Anna M. Kaczmarek
	Prof. Dr Anna M. Kaczmarek studied Chemistry at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland. She acquired a PhD at Ghent University, Belgium in 2015 in the field of luminescent lanthanide-doped inorganic nano- and micro- sized materials. After that she worked as a post-doctoral researcher in several groups at Ghent University, as well as carried out research stays at Cordoba University (Spain) and Utrecht University (the Netherlands). In 2020 she obtained a permanent position at the Chemistry Department of Ghent University and created the NanoSensing Group, which focuses on the development of luminescent (nano)thermometers. In the same year she obtained the prestigious ERC Starting Grant on the topic of nanothermometers for theranostics, which has allowed her to build an excellent team of young researchers.

Key learning points
1. The effect of transition metal ion co-dopants, and the importance of the host matrix, on the upconversion mechanism in lanthanide (nano)materials.
2. Energy transfer mechanisms in lanthanide and transition metal co-doped (nano)materials.
3. Characterization techniques suitable for detecting transition metal ion co-dopants.
4. Transition metal ion co-doping as a way to enhance and tune upconversion intensity.
5. Thermometric performance of lanthanide-transition metal co-doped systems.


 	Fig. 1  UC processes for lanthanide-doped nanoparticles: (A) energy-transfer upconversion (ETU), (B) excited-state absorption (ESA), (C) cooperative sensitization, (D) cooperative luminescence, and (E) two-photon absorption.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic overview of the main roles transition metals play in host lattices: (A) new emission centers, (B) mediators of crystal field, and (C) energy transfer medium. In all cases the amount of the co-doped transition metal ion has a significant influence on these effects. The scheme has been drawn for NaYF4 co-doped with Mn4+.	 

 	Fig. 3  TEM image of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ (18:2 mol%) nanoparticles (A) without Mn2+ dopant ions and (B) with 30 mol% Mn2+co-doping. The effect of transition metal co-doping on nanomaterial morphology is very clearly visualized here (reprinted with permission from ref. 26 Copyright 2012, Wiley Materials).	 

 	Fig. 4  Proposed energy transfer mechanisms under the excitation of a 980 nm laser have been redrawn from ref. 69.
