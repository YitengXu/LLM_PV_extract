    , Accepted 17th May 2019First published on 18th May 2019AbstractDue to the designability of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), semiconductor MOFs have become the focus of research as photocatalysts of useful chemical processes utilizing clean solar energy. In this work, we developed a method of tuning the framework charge of MOF materials and determined how the framework charge can affect the band edge positions and bandgaps of the novel anionic Cd(II) porphyrinic metal–organic framework (PMOF) 1 ([Cd3.2(H2TCPP)2][(CH3)2NH2]1.6). It was constructed from H2TCPP4− (H6TCPP = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin) and Cd(II), forming a tube-like structure, and shown to have a negatively charged framework with a 60% occupancy of one type of Cd(II) ion. By increasing the reaction time and the amount of Cd(II) ions in the reactants, the nearly neutral counterpart of PMOF 1 was also obtained. The [(CH3)2NH2]+ counterions of PMOF 1 were also exchanged with Li+. Although the surface area of PMOF 1 and its derived PMOFs were only 407–672 m2 g−1, the CO2 and CH4 uptakes reached, respectively, 44–65 ml g−1 (8.7–12.7%) and 22–26 ml g−1 (1.6–1.8%) each at 1.0 atom and 273 K; at 9.0 atm these values nearly tripled. Li+-exchanged 1 favoured N2, CO2 and CH4 adsorption, especially at 9 atm and a relatively low temperature (273 K). PMOF 1 subjected to a solvent exchange process showed an unstable structure in water, while PMOF 1 not subjected to this process was found to be stable in water. Thus, a method for making water-stable divalent-metal carboxylate MOFs was proposed. The counter ion type showed little effect on the band-edge positions and bandgaps, but the framework charge did show effects. Under visible light and with tris(2,2′-bipyridine)dichlororuthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)3Cl2) as the co-catalyst and triethylamine (TEA) as the sacrificial agent, the efficiency of CO production resulting from CO2 reduction using 1-DMF reached 56 μmol g−1 h−1, about 5 times greater than that for the system without using Ru(bpy)3Cl2.
Introduction
Environmental pollution, global warming, and the energy crisis caused by massive fossil fuel combustion have been the focus of world attention.1 The more than 13 gigatons of CO2 generated annually from the combustion of fossil fuels for the production of heat and electricity is a major contributor to climate change and ocean acidification.2 To alleviate this problem, CO2 capture3–8 and storage,9–11 and its conversion12–14 to useful chemicals or fuels have become current research focuses.
Solar energy is an inexhaustible and clean energy source worldwide. However, the spatial and temporal discontinuities of this renewable energy resource result in low energy delivery efficiency. Solutions include converting solar energy to electricity or chemical fuels that can be easily stored and transported.15 Semiconductors can convert sunlight into electricity or be photocatalysts utilizing sunlight in important chemical processes, for example in splitting water to hydrogen and in CO2 reduction reactions, which convert the greenhouse gas to fuels (such as CO and CH4). Given that UV light accounts for only 4% of solar light while visible light contributes 43% of solar energy, it is rather imperative to develop visible-light-responsive photocatalysts.16 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), also called coordination polymers (CPs), are compounds consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands and form two- or three-dimensional structures. These materials can be synthesized as narrow-band semiconductors due to their designability and have drawn increasing attention as photocatalysts.16–20 In recent years, researchers have started to investigate the electronic properties of these interesting framework materials.21,22 However, systematic studies on how to control their band gaps, band structures and band-edge positions are still lacking.22 To the best of our knowledge, whether and how the framework charge affects the band-edge positions have not been determined.
Although MOFs stable in water can be synthesized using trivalent or tetravalent ions,23 most of the divalent metal (Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, etc.) carboxylate MOFs, including many highly porous and conventional ones (MOF-5, MOF-74, HKUST-1, etc.), are not very stable in water, limiting their applications.24
Of the various types of MOFs, porphyrin MOFs (PMOFs) have attracted particularly widespread interest owing to the key roles played by porphyrins in many chemical and biological processes. PMOFs can find applications in gas storage and separation,25–29 light harvesting,30–32 photovoltaics,33–35 sensing,36–38 heterogeneous catalyses39–42 including photocatalyses,43,44 electrochemical catalyses,45–49 and photodynamic/photothermal therapies.50–52 However, the poor crystallization and weak diffraction of PMOFs have greatly limited their developments and applications. Compared with the fast-developing area of porphyrin chemistry,53 the field of the PMOF is still in its incipiency.54–58
Herein, single crystals of a 3D anionic PMOF 1 ([Cd3.2(H2TCPP)2][(CH3)2NH2]1.6) have been prepared from the reaction of Cd(II) with tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin (H6TCPP) in the presence of benzoic acid. Since the occupancy of one type of Cd(II) in the structure is only 60%, we prepared the nearly neutral counterpart of 1 by increasing the reaction time and the amount of Cd(II) in the reactants. In addition, we prepared the ion-exchanged version of 1 by carrying out Li+ exchange. Without the solvent exchange process, 1 was found to be stable in water, but after the solvent exchange, the structure was observed to be unstable in water. PMOF 1 and its derived products were characterized, and gas sorption experiments indicated high CO2 and CH4 uptakes by these products. And Li+-exchanged 1s favoured N2, CO2 and CH4 adsorption, especially at 9 atm and a relatively low temperature (273 K). How the framework charge and the counter ion type would affect the band-edge position and bandgap was investigated by following a well-established electrochemical method. Finally, the reduction of CO2 using 1-DMF as the photocatalyst was investigated. Adding Ru(bpy)3Cl2 to the system increased the CO production rate about 5 fold.
Experimental
Materials and general methods
The ligand tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)-porphyrin (H6TCPP) was synthesized according to the reported procedures.59 Ultrapure water obtained from a Millipore water purification system (≥18 Ω cm, Millipore) was used in the electrochemical experiments. Other chemicals used in these experiments were of analytical reagent grade. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were taken using a Bruker D8-Advance diffractometer with a Cu sealed tube (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA. Unless specified, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) experiments were carried out using a SDT 2980 thermal analyser under Ar flow of 15 mL min−1 over the temperature range from 25 to 250 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and O2 flow of 15 mL min−1 over the temperature range from 250 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were carried out using an Elementar Vario EL III element analyzer. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) from 4000 to 400 cm−1 were recorded from KBr pellet forms of the samples using a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectral measurements were taken using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Surface area and pore characteristics measurements were taken by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 or with a Micromeritics ASAP 2050 Xtended Pressure Adsorption Analyzer. Before taking the adsorption measurements, the freshly prepared samples were exchanged with methanol for 3 d and then acetone for 3 d (with solvent replaced with fresh solvent every 6 h). After the removal of acetone by heating each isolated sample at 52 °C for 12 h, the samples (about 30–50 mg) were activated by heating them under vacuum for 10 h at 120 °C.
Making modified ITO electrodes for electrochemical (EC) studies
A mass of about 1.5–2.0 mg of an MOF was combined with 0.50 mL of ultrapure water and the resulting mixture was ultrasonicated for 2 h before a volume of 20 μL of the mixture was dropped onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, the geometrical area of which was 0.28 cm2. The electrode was then dried at room temperature in a desiccator over silica gel for 24 h before being used for PEC measurements.
Determining the positions of the valence- and conduction-band edges using an EC method
EC measurements were taken with a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments Inc, USA). All experiments were carried out at room temperature using a conventional three-electrode system with the ITO electrode (sheet resistance 20–25 Ω per square) modified with MOF compounds as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. After the modified electrode was put in the electrolyte for 10–30 s, cathodic (or anodic) linear potential scans (100 mV s−1) were acquired to determine the conduction- (or the valence-) band edges of the MOF compounds using a Tris-HCl-buffered saline (0.1 mol L−1, pH 7.4) solution. We also applied an H2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 5.01) as the electrolyte to verify the results. The method used here has been described in our previous publications.60–62
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiments
The photocatalytic performance of 1 was evaluated by applying it to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CEL-SPH2N-S9, AULTT, China). The experiments were carried out in a 100 mL Pyrex flask. A 300 W xenon arc lamp (CEL-PF300-T8, AULTT, China) (photocurrent: 14.5 A) through a UV-cutoff filter with a wavelength greater than 420 nm was installed 10 cm away from the reaction solution, and was employed as a visible-light source to promote the photocatalytic reaction. In one experiment, a mass of 9.3 mg of 1-DMF was suspended in a mixture of MeCN and triethylamine (TEA, as a sacrificial base) (50 mL, 4/1 v/v). In other experiments, masses of 10–15 mg of different catalysts were each suspended in a mixture of MeCN and TEA (50 mL, 4/1 v/v) with 11.0–11.9 mg of tris(2,2′-bipyridine)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate. Before irradiation, the system was evacuated slowly to remove the dissolved oxygen. About 0.9 bar CO2 was then introduced into the system and we waited for about 5 min to see the pressure drop. This operation was repeated until the pressure did not drop any more. The reaction mixtures were then irradiated by visible light. The CO content was analysed by performing gas chromatography (GC7920-TF2Z, AULTT, China).
Synthesis of 1 (also denoted as 1(3.5:1)-2d), [Cd3.2(H2TCPP)2][(CH3)2NH2]1.6
In a typical reaction, Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (16 mg, 0.052 mmol), H6TCPP (12 mg, 0.015 mmol) (molar ratio of Cd(II):H6TCPP = 3.5:1), and benzoic acid (350 mg, 2.86 mmol) in 2 mL of DMF and 1 mL of H2O were ultrasonically mixed in a Pyrex vial, which was then sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 °C for 2.0 d. After the vial was allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally in the oven, dark purple block-like crystals were harvested by performing filtration, followed by being washed with DMF three times and then put in acetone for 3 d, during which the acetone was replaced with fresh acetone every 6 h. The product was then isolated from acetone and dried at 100 °C in an oven for 6 h, giving a mass of 5.0 mg, corresponding to a 33% yield based on H6TCPP. Elemental analysis was carried out on the product obtained using filtration, and the product was then washed with DMF and dried at room temperature. Anal. calcd (%) for 1·[Cd3.2(H2TCPP)2][(CH3)2NH2]1.6(H2O)2.5(DMF)5: C, 56.74; H, 4.37; N, 8.46%. Found: C, 56.08; H, 4.31; N, 8.28%.
Large-scale synthesis of 1
In a typical reaction, H6TCPP (121 mg, 0.15 mmol) was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF, and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (163 mg, 0.52 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of H2O. The above two solutions were then ultrasonically mixed with benzoic acid (3.50 g, 28.7 mmol) in a Teflon liner (total volume: 60 ml) for 5 minutes. The Teflon liner was then put into the corresponding stainless steel autoclave, sealed and heated at 120 °C for 2.0 d and was then cooled down naturally to room temperature in the oven. The recovered crystals were rinsed with DMF until the resulting solution became colourless. The crystals were then heated at 120 °C for 24 h. The PXRD result of the obtained product (denoted as 1-DMF) is given in Fig. 1(b). The IR spectra of the product are given in Fig. S4.† The solvent-exchanged product (denoted as 1-ex, also as 1(3.5:1)-2d-ex) was obtained using methanol and acetone to remove the DMF and H2O by applying the method described below. TG/DTA (Fig. S5†), PXRD (Fig. 1(b)), and isothermal sorption data (Fig. 4(a) and 5(a)) of 1-ex were obtained.

Syntheses of 1(4:1)-4d, 1(6:1)-4d and 1(8:1)-4d
H6TCPP (12.1 mg, 0.0153 mmol) was dissolved in 2.0 ml of DMF. And certain amounts of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (1(4:1)-4d: 18.9 mg (0.0612 mmol), molar ratio of Cd(II):H6TCPP = 4:1; 1(6:1)-4d: 28.4 mg (0.0918 mmol), molar ratio of Cd(II):H6TCPP = 6:1; and 1(8:1)-4d: 37.8 mg (0.123 mmol), molar ratio of Cd(II):H6TCPP = 8:1 were dissolved in 1.0 ml of H2O. The above two solutions were then ultrasonically mixed with benzoic acid (350 mg, 2.86 mmol) in a glass vial for 5 minutes. The vial was then sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 °C for 4.0 d. After the reaction was cooled down to room temperature, crystals were obtained under the mother liquor. These crystals, denoted as 1(4:1)-4d, 1(6:1)-4d and 1(8:1)-4d, respectively, were recovered by performing filtration followed by washing them with DMF until the resulting solution became colourless, and then heating them at 120 °C for 24 h, with the obtained products denoted as 1(4:1)-4d-DMF, 1(6:1)-4d-DMF and 1(8:1)-4d-DMF, respectively. Solvent-exchanged products of 1(4:1)-4d, 1(6:1)-4d and 1(8:1)-4d were also obtained using methanol and acetone as described below, and denoted as 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, and 1(8:1)-4d-ex, respectively. The PXRD patterns and IR spectra of 1(4:1)-4d-DMF, 1(6:1)-4d-DMF and 1(8:1)-4d-DMF are shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S4(a),† respectively. TG/DTA (Fig. S5†), UV-Vis reflectance spectra (Fig. 6), and gas sorption properties (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S7†) of the solvent-exchanged products (1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, and 1(8:1)-4d-ex) were obtained. Anal. found (%) for 1(4:1)-4d-ex: C, 54.20; H, 3.87; N, 5.49%; calcd(%) for [Cd3.77(C48H26O8N4)2][(CH3)2NH2]0.46(CH3OH)6.4(H2O)3: C, 54.49; H, 3.86; N, 5.20%; anal. found (%) for 1(8:1)-4d-ex: C, 53.48; H, 3.95; N, 5.31%; calcd(%) for ([Cd3.9(C48H26O8N4)2][(CH3)2NH2]0.20(CH3OH)6 (H2O)5: C, 53.39; H, 3.83; N, 4.99%. The ICP and TG (Fig. S5(e)†) measurements of the 1(8:1)-4d-DMF sample suggested a formula of [Cd3.8(C48H26O8N4)2][(CH3)2NH2)]0.4 for 1(8:1)-4d.
Syntheses of 1(6:1)-2d single crystals
Crystals of 1(6:1)-2d were obtained by using the same procedure as that used for the synthesis of 1(6:1)-4d, except that the reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 2.0 d instead of 4.0 d. The single-crystal structure of 1(6:1)-2d was determined. Its formula was determined to be [Cd3.27(C48H26O8N4)2][(CH3)2NH2]1.46(H2O)3(DMF)5 by including the TG result of 1(6:1)-2d-DMF-RT (Fig. S5(k)†), which was obtained by washing the ground 1(6:1)-2d crystals with DMF and drying them at room temperature.
Syntheses of 1(3.5:1)-4d-DMF, 1(4:1)-2d-DMF, 1(6:1)-2d-DMF and 1(8:1)-2d-DMF

1(3.5:1)-4d-DMF was obtained by following the same procedure used for the synthesis of 1-DMF, except that the reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 4 d instead of 2 d. 1(4:1)-2d-DMF, 1(6:1)-2d-DMF, and 1(8:1)-2d-DMF were obtained by following the same procedure used for the syntheses of 1(4:1)-4d-DMF, 1(6:1)-4d-DMF, 1(8:1)-4d-DMF, except that the reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 2 d instead of 4 d. The PXRD spectra of these compounds are given in Fig. 1(a).
Procedures for subjecting the products to solvent exchange
In a typical procedure, the mother liquor over the product (10–50 mg) was removed after the reaction was cooled down to room temperature. The product was then rinsed with methanol, and then was put into 45 ml methanol in a capped centrifuge tube for 3 d, during which the methanol was changed every 6 h. Then, the methanol was replaced with 45 ml of acetone and changed every 6 h for 3 d. The product was then filtered and dried at 52 °C for 12 h.
Syntheses of Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d and Li+-1-10d
A mass of 80 mg of 1-ex was put into a 40 ml methanol solution of LiNO3 (1.0 M) in a capped centrifuge tube. The solution was replaced every 24 h with a fresh LiNO3 solution for a certain amount of time (2 d for Li+-1-2d, 5 d for Li+-1-5d or 10 d for Li+-1-10d). The products were rinsed with methanol 2 or 3 times and dried at 62 °C for 24 h. IR (Fig. S4(b)†), TG/DTA (Fig. S5†) and gas (N2, CO2 and CH4) isothermal sorption data (Fig. 4, 5, Fig. S8†) were then obtained. Anal. found (%) for Li+-1-2d: C, 51.50; H, 3.72; N, 4.36%; calcd(%) for [Cd3.2(C48H26O8N4)2]Li1.4[(CH3)2NH2]0.2(H2O)17: C, 51.27; H, 3.91; N, 5.09%. Anal. found (%) for Li+-1-5d: C, 52.13; H, 3.61; N, 4.77%; calcd(%) for [Cd3.2(C48H26O8N4)2]Li1.6(H2O)15: C, 52.07; H, 3.73; N, 5.06%. Anal. found (%) for Li+-1-10d: C, 54.40; H, 3.24; N, 4.87%; calcd(%) for [Cd3.0(C48H26O8N4)2]Li2.0(H2O)10: C, 54.78; H, 3.45; N, 5.32%.
ICP measurements
A small amount of product (Li+-1-2d: 2.01 mg; or Li+-1-5d: 2.16 mg; or Li+-1-10d: 2.05 mg) was ultrasonically dissolved in an aqueous NaOH solution (1.0 ml, 0.038 M). A concentrated aqueous HNO3 solution (10 ml) was then added to the above solution and diluted by H2O to obtain final concentrations of 10.05, 10.80 and 10.25 mg L−1 for Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d and Li+-1-10d, respectively. The ICP experiments were carried out using these solutions, and the concentrations of Cd and Li were found to be 1.71 and 0.043 mg L−1, respectively, for Li+-1-2d, 1.81 and 0.051 mg L−1 for Li+-1-5d, and 1.49 and 0.048 mg L−1 for Li+-1-10d.
ICP investigations of 1-DMF, 1(6:1)-2d-DMF, 1(8:1)-4d-DMF were carried out similarly. The concentrations of dissolved products were found to be 21.5, 10.9 and 10.8 mg L−1, and the concentrations of Cd were 3.46, 1.81 and 1.97 mg L−1, respectively. TGs of the compounds used for ICP measurements were also obtained.
X-ray crystallography
Suitable crystals of compounds were selected from the mother liquor for analysis using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The data were collected at 296 K using a Bruker APEXII CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromatized Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) from an enhanced optic X-ray tube. Raw data for the structure were obtained using SAINT, and absorption correction was applied using SADABS programs. The structure of 1 was solved using direct methods, and refined by performing full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL-2018/3 program.75 The structure of 1(6:1)-2d was solved by carrying out intrinsic phasing using the XT-2015 program, and refined by performing full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXL-2018/3 program. Free dimethylammonium cations and solvent molecules in the compounds were highly disordered and could not be successfully located and refined. The diffuse electron densities of these residual cations and solvents were removed from the data set by using the SQUEEZE105 routine of PLATON63 software, and then the generated data were used to further refine the structure. The final formulas of the compounds were assigned based on the X-ray crystal structure determinations, charge balances, TGAs, ICPs and elemental analyses. The crystallographic data and selected bond lengths and angles are given in ESI (Tables S1–S3†). The crystallographic material can also be obtained from the CCDC, and the deposition numbers are CCDC 1911670 (1) and 1865065 (1(6:1)-2d).†
Results and discussion
Syntheses and general characterizations

Syntheses and general characterizations of MOF 1. 
The framework was indicated, from the single-crystal refinement results, to be anionic. The occupancy factors were refined based on diffraction intensities. The occupancies of Cd(1), Cd(2) and Cd1′ were 0.45(4), 0.301(2) and 0.274(19), respectively, indicating an anionic framework with a formula of [Cd3.2(C48H26O8N4)2]−1.6. We proposed that its counterion was the (CH3)2NH2+ cation since it was synthesized in the mixed solvent of H2O and DMF. High-temperature solvothermal reactions have been previously shown to easily cause the hydrolysis of DMF, forming dimethylammonium cations.64–66 Actually, quite a few charged MOFs, especially anionic ones, have in situ-formed (CH3)2NH2+ cations trapped in their pores or channels as counterions.64–71 But these cations in the currently studied MOF were not detected by the single-crystal X-ray analysis and were hence concluded to be disordered.
The ICP, TG and elemental analyses all provided evidence for compound 1 (also called 1(3.5:1)-2d) being composed of an anionic framework. Compound 1 was synthesized in a mixed solvent of DMF and H2O with 2:1 volume ratio. It was ground and washed with DMF until becoming colorless to remove all unreacted H6TCPP including those in the channels. It was then dried at room temperature to obtain 1-DMF-RT, or heated at 120 °C for 24 h to obtain 1-DMF. TGAs of both 1-DMF-RT and 1-DMF (Fig. S5(a)–(c)†), as well as ICP of 1-DMF were carried out. The formula of compound 1-DMF-RT and 1-DMF was proposed to be Cdx(C48H26O8N4)2(NH2(CH3)2)(8-2x)(H2O)y(DMF)z. Close inspection of the DTG curves in the TG-DTA results indicated that compound 1 lost H2O, DMF and NH(CH3)2 before the temperature reached 270 °C (Fig. S5†). The decomposition of NH2(CH3)2+ in 1 was proposed to occur according to eqn (1), similar to that of NH4Cl. (1)
Based on the TG measurements (Fig. S5†), we deduced that, at the plateau at about 270 °C, approximately 80.0% of 1-DMF-RT consisted of Cdx(C48H26O8N4)2H(8-2x). To ensure a final decomposition product consisting only of metal oxide, the TGA was done in an O2 atmosphere in the range of 250–600 °C. The content of metal oxide was experimentally determined from TGA to be 16.5%, consistent with x = 3.2 based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction (the theoretical percentage of metal oxide is 17.0%).
The 3.2 value of x was also found to be consistent with the ICP result for 1-DMF. In addition to the TGA results that showed that 84% of 1-DMF consisted of Cdx(C48H26O8N4)2H(8-2x), the ICP result showed that 21.5 mg L−1 of dissolved 1-DMF contained 3.46 mg L−1 Cd(II). This experimentally determined value was found to be consistent with the theoretical value of 3.36 mg L−1 determined from using x = 3.2 in the formula 21.5 × 0.84/MCd3.2(C48H26O8N4)2H1.6 × 3.2 × MCd.
The mass percentage of H2O, DMF and NH(CH3)2 in the product was indicated to be 20.0% (i.e., 100% − the percentage of Cdx(C48H26O8N4)2H(8-2x)) shown in the TG curve of 1-DMF-RT (Fig. S5(a)†). Based on this information and the electron numbers found in the single-crystal X-ray determination (where a solvent mask was calculated and 530 electrons were found in a volume of 1905 Å3), the formula of 1-DMF-RT including solvents was deduced to be Cd3.2(C48H26O8N4)2(NH2(CH3)2)1.6 (H2O)2.5(C3H7NO)5.0 (calcd (%): C, 56.74; H, 4.37; N, 8.46. Found (%): C, 56.08; H, 4.31; N, 8.28). The theoretical weight loss of H2O, DMF and NH(CH3)2 was 19.7%, consistent with the experimental loss of 20.0% (Fig. S5(a)†).
In the 1(6:1)-2d case, the framework formula based on XRD-diffraction intensities on a single crystal picked from the mother liquor was determined to be [Cd3.27(C48H26O8N4)2]−1,46 while the formula based on ICP and TG results was determined to be [Cd3.31(C48H26O8N4)2][NH2(CH3)2]1.38. Based on the mass percentage of H2O, DMF and NH(CH3)2 (20.4%) in 1(6:1)-2d-DMF-RT (1(6:1)-2d dried at RT) derived from its TG curve (Fig S5(k)†) and the electron numbers found in the single-crystal X-ray structure determination (a solvent mask was calculated and 504 electrons were found in a volume of 1774 Å3), the amounts of solvents (H2O and DMF) in the formula were deduced. Thus, the formula of 1(6:1)-2d-DMF was found to be [Cd3.31(C48H26O8N4)2][NH2(CH3)2]1.38(H2O)2(C3H7NO)5, with a theoretical total content of H2O, DMF and NH(CH3)2 of 19.2%, consistent with the experimental value of 20.4% (Fig. S5(k)†).
The phase purity of compound 1 was also verified by carrying out powder X-ray diffraction studies (Fig. 1(a)). Without adding water and benzoic acid, amorphous product was obtained. Adding suitable amounts of water and benzoic acid was found to be important for obtaining single crystals, and too much benzoic acid resulted in a clear solution.


Manipulating the framework charge of MOF 1. 
Although excess Cd2+ (yielding a 3.5:1 molar ratio of Cd2+:H6TCPP) was introduced into the reaction, the resulting 1 ([Cd3.2(H2TCPP)2][(CH3)2NH2]1.6) showed a deficiency of Cd2+ in the framework. To include more Cd2+ into the framework, we prepared 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, and 1(8:1)-4d-ex by increasing the amount of Cd2+ in the starting reaction mixtures and the reaction time was extended from 2 d to 4 d, followed by performing a methanol and acetone exchange process to remove DMF in the products. TG-DTA measurements of 1(4:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex were taken (Fig. S5(f)–(g)†). The first weight loss of each product before ∼60 °C was attributed to the absorbed acetone or methanol solvent molecules (∼8%). The second weight loss in the temperature range 60–130 °C was attributed to the absorbed H2O molecules and more strongly absorbed methanol molecules (7–9%). A plateau was observed between 130 and 290–320 °C, beyond which framework decomposition occurred. Since the experiments were carried under an O2 atmosphere, eventually only CdO was left. The ICP result and TG pattern (Fig. S5(e)†) of the 1(8:1)-4d-DMF sample suggested a formula of Cd3.8(H2TCPP)2(NH2(CH3)2)0.4 for 1(8:1)-4d. Based on these TG curves and eqn (1), we deduced the solvent-free formulas of 1(4:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex to be [Cd3.77(H2TCPP)2][(CH3)2NH2]0.46 (WCdO/Wtotal: 19.8% (found 19.9%)), and [Cd4.0(H2TCPP)2] (WCdO/Wtotal: 20.7% (found 21.2%)), respectively. The elemental-analysis (C, H and N) results of the samples of 1(4:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex were obtained and found to be consistent with the above results (x = 3.77 and 3.9, respectively). The theoretical ICP value based on a neutral framework would have been 2.06 mg L−1, still consistent with the experimental value of 1.97 mg L−1 for 1(8:1)-4d-DMF. Thus, 1(8:1)-4d-DMF was concluded to be a nearly neutral framework with x = 3.8–4.0.
In addition, the ICP and TG measurements of 1(6:1)-2d-DMF both suggested its formula to be Cd3.31(H2TCPP)2(NH2(CH3)2)1.38, consistent with the single-crystal diffraction data of 1(6:1)-2d (x = 3.27). Its Cd2+ content was thus indicated to be slightly greater than that of MOF 1, due to the higher molar ratio of Cd2+ to the ligand in the starting materials.
The Langmuir specific surface areas of 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex were determined to be 559, 594 and 586 m2 g−1, respectively, significantly larger than that of 1-ex (407 m2 g−1) due to the lack or near lack of balanced cations in the channels. Since the specific area of 1(6:1)-4d-ex was much larger than that of 1(4:1)-4d-ex, but very close to that of 1(8:1)-4d-ex, it also mostly likely achieved the same nearly neutral framework as did 1(8:1)-4d-ex. In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized frameworks of increasing negative charge: (1(4:1)-4d ([Cd3.77(C48H26O8N4)2][(CH3)2NH2]0.46) < 1(6:1)-2d ([Cd3.31(C48H26O8N4)2] [(CH3)2NH2]1.38) < 1 ([Cd3.2(H2TCPP)2] [(CH3)2NH2]1.6)); as well as 1(6:1)-4d and 1(8:1)-4d, which each showed a nearly neutral framework (Cd4.0(C48H26O8N4)2). In addition, we found that (1) the products of different reaction times produced essentially indistinguishable PXRD patterns despite the framework charge differences and that (2) higher Cd(II):H6TCPP molar ratios in the starting reaction mixtures and longer reaction times favoured the formation of a neutral framework.


IR spectra. 
H6TCPP, 1-DMF, 1(4:1)-4d-DMF, 1(6:1)-4d-DMF and 1(8:1)-4d-DMF yielded essentially indistinguishable IR spectra (Fig. S4(a)†), each showing a band at 1707 cm−1, a value too high to be assigned to CO stretching of DMF molecules. Based on comparing the IR spectrum of 1(8:1)-4d-DMF with those of 1-ex and H6TCPP in Fig. S4(c),† we proposed that this band was probably due to H6TCPP or benzoic acid trapped between crystals or in the channels, i.e., not washed completely away by DMF solvent. In contrast, no band at 1707 cm−1 was observed for the solvent-exchanged sample (1-ex) (Fig. 4(c)), indicating an absence of H6TCPP or benzoic acid molecules in this sample. The strong band at 1605 cm−1 and the weak signal at 1560 cm−1 of H6TCPP were assigned by others to CC and CN stretchings.72–74 Inspection of the crystal structure indicated a wide variation in the CO bond length of compound 1 (e.g. 1.2500(74), 1.26(2) and 1.29(2) Å). Thus, two of the IR bands were perhaps due to asymmetric stretching of CO2−. We therefore tentatively assigned the strong bands at 1603 and 1541 cm−1 to asymmetric stretching of CO2−, and the strong signal at 1387 cm−1 to symmetric stretching of CO2−.

Syntheses and general characterizations of Li+-exchanged MOF 1 (Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d and Li+-1-10d)
Due to the presence of (CH3)2NH2+ cations in the channels of 1, which could reduce the porosity of the product, we set out to effectively enlarge the channels by replacing these ions with Li+ through an ion exchange process using methanol as solvent. Details of this process are given in the Experimental section. Relative to the starting materials with a formula of Cd3.2(C48H26O8N4)2(NH2(CH3)2)1.6, ICP analyses and TG measurements (showing the mass percentage of Cdx(C48H26O8N4)2H8-2x (eqn (1))) revealed that 88%, 100%, and 100% of the NH2(CH3)2+ and in each case 6% of the Cd2+ in MOF 1 were replaced by Li+ when producing Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d and Li+-1-10d, respectively. The theoretical concentrations of Cd and Li in Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d and Li+-1-10d were calculated based on the above values to be 1.7 and, 0.046, 1.79 and 0.055, and 1.59 and 0.083 mg L−1, respectively, consistent with the experimental values of 1.71 and 0.043, 1.81 and 0.051, and 1.49 and 0.048 mg L−1, respectively. PXRD patterns of these compounds were observed to be similar to that of MOF 1, but not identical with a few peak shifts and with a greatly reduced of the peak at 11.26° (Fig. 1(b)). However, these samples yielded IR spectra essentially identical to that of 1-ex (Fig. S4(b)†), suggesting that the bonds in the structure were virtually unchanged after the Li+ exchange process. Thus, the small changes in the PXRD patterns were attributed to the flexibility of the framework and not due to decomposition of the framework. Elemental analyses results (Experimental section) were also found to be consistent with the above findings.
The specific areas of the obtained product increased significantly after the Li+ ion exchange, from 407 m2 g−1 of 1-ex to 600–700 m2 g−1, indicating that (CH3)2NH2+ cations in the channels had been successfully replaced by the much smaller Li+ ion.
Structure of MOF 1 and 1(6:1)-2d
Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed essentially identical structures for 1 (also denoted as 1(3.5:1)-2d) and 1(6:1)-2d, but with different occupancies of Cd2 in these compounds. The occupancy of Cd2 was refined and found to be 0.602 in 1 and 0.635 in 1(6:1)-2d; in contrast the refined occupancy of Cd1 was found to be 1.0. Based on these results, we modeled the structure of 1(6:1)-2d, as shown in Fig. 2. We specifically modeled it to include fully deprotonated carboxylate groups of H6TCPP with each of these groups forming bridges to Cd1 and Cd2 as shown in Fig. 2(a), and phenyl rings tilted away from the porphyrin macrocycle plane by dihedral angles of 59.6° or 81.2°. Note that 1(6:1)-2d crystallized in the C2/c space group as a 3D framework. Inspection of the structure, displayed in Fig. 2(b), revealed the presence of chains of cadmium oxides, made of two kinds of Cd(II) ions (denoted as Cd1 and Cd2), along the a axis, and showed Cd1 eight-coordinated by eight carboxylate oxygen atoms of 4 carboxylate groups through a bidentate coordinating mode and Cd2 4-coordinated by 4 oxygen atoms from 4 different carboxylate groups using monodentate a coordinating mode. The framework was indicated, from the above-described ICP, elemental analysis and TGA results, to be made up of negative charges that were balanced with free dimethylammonium cations [(CH3)2NH2]+. The dimethylammonium cations were highly disordered and were not visualized in the channels using the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. Channels could only be seen along the a axis (Fig. 2(d)), with the two different channels observed having dimensions of 4.1 (2.4) × 9.6 (8.3)104 and 5.7 (4.0) × 13.4 (12.1). The solvent-accessible pore volumes of the channels without considering the presence of [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations were calculated, using the PLATON program,63 to be 33.8 and 31.7%, for 1 and 1(6:1)-2d, respectively.

By using a large excess of Cd(II) ions in the starting materials, specifically a Cd(II):H6TCPP molar ratio of 6.0:1 for 1(6:1)-2d instead of 3.5:1 for 1, the occupancy of Cd2 increased from 0.602 to 0.635, and the negative charge of the framework correspondingly decreased a little bit.
To the best of our knowledge, several Cd(II)-containing PMOFs using the H6TCPP ligand have been reported.76–78 The structure of compound 1 was found to be similar to that of the [Cd1.25(Pd-H1.5TCPP)(H2O)]·2DMF (Cd-Pd-MPF) synthesized in a mixed solvent of DMF, MeOH and acetic acid at 80 °C for 10 days by Wu et al.78 Cd-Pd-MPF also included cadmium oxide chains, but with coordination modes different from those of compound 1 as shown in Fig. 2(d)—specifically with one type of Cd 8 coordinated like Cd1 in PMOF 1, but with the other type of Cd 4 coordinated by two O atoms from a carboxylate group and two H2O molecules. Similarly the occupancy of the 4-coordinated Cd(II) cations was only 0.25. These two structures showed similar channels and cell parameters, and the same 4,6T156 topology. (The detailed topology analysis of compound 1 is given in ESI.†)
Water and thermal stabilities
For MOFs to find practical applications in industry, they must be chemically and thermally stable.79 Unfortunately, most MOFs are unstable in water or humid conditions. The TG/DTA results (Fig. S5†) of Li+-exchanged and solvent-exchanged 1 suggested a relatively high thermal stability of the products among MOF materials, which decompose at about 290–320 °C. The PXRD pattern of 1 did not change after gas adsorption measurements were taken, indicating that 1 can be stable at 120 °C for 12 h under vacuum. And it was stable after heating at 160 °C for 12 h (Fig. 1(b)).

1-DMF and 1(8:1)-4d-DMF showed similar stability levels, despite their different framework charges. They were observed to be stable in water, CH3CN/TEA (v/v: 4:1, a mixed solvent for CO2 photocatalytic reductions) for at least 24 h, and in Tris-HCl buffer solution for 1 h; but unstable in a CH3CN/TEA/H2O mixed solvent (v/v: 3:1:1) for 24 h (Fig. 3(a) and (c)). And the solvent-exchanged (by methanol and then acetone for 3 d) products 1-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex showed significantly reduced stability (Fig. 3(b) and (d)).
 Fig. 3  PXRD patterns of 1-DMF (a), 1-ex (b), 1(8:1)-4d-DMF (c), 1(8:1)-4d-ex (d) 2–24 h after they were put into various solvents. A mass of 12 mg of each compound was put into various solvents (8 ml), kept there for 2–24 h, washed with acetone twice and dried at 52 °C for 24 h. 
Inspection of the IR spectra of 1-DMF and 1(8:1)-4d-DMF (Fig. S4(a)†) indicated an absence of DMF, based on the lack of a band at 1670–1690, but they contained H6TCPP (Fig. S4(c)†). Without solvent exchange, we were not able to determine specific surface areas for 1-DMF and 1(8:1)-4d-DMF using N2 gas adsorption, and these results provided evidence for the channels having been filled with foreign species. But after carrying out the solvent exchange process, we were able to determine their specific surface areas, indicating that some foreign species (but not (CH3)2NH2+) were removed from the channels by the solvent exchange. This process was found to destroy a metal ion-ligand bond requiring several water molecules to interact with the same bond.80 Thus, we proposed that the stability levels of these two compounds were due to the H6TCPP residues blocking the channels or being entrapped in the channels. Thus, they prevented enough water molecules from getting into the channels to interact with and destroy the framework. This understanding provides a way to increase the water stability of divalent metal ion carboxylate MOFs or any water-unstable MOFs, namely by reducing its channel or pore sizes. One way to do so, as in this work, is to introduce foreign species to block the windows or to become entrapped in the channels or pores to prevent enough water molecules from getting into the channels or pores to destroy the framework. This strategy could even transform a water-unstable framework into a water-stable one as in the cases of 1-ex and 1-DMF.
Sorption properties
Without solvent exchange (except for the Li+-exchanged 1s), we were unable to determine the porosity of 1 using N2 gas. After solvent exchange and activation of the products at 120 °C for 12 h, the specific surface areas of the various products were determined and the results are given in Fig. 4 and Table 1. They yielded type I adsorption/desorption isothermal curves, consistent with their microporous structures. The 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex compounds (136–137 ml g−1) adsorbed more N2 at 77 K than did 1-ex (128 ml g−1), attributed to a nearly complete absence of (CH3)2(NH2)+ ions in the channels. The Li+-exchanged 1 showed significantly higher adsorption (143–160 ml g−1), suggesting Li+ in the channel and/or the charged framework favouring the adsorption of N2, and despite these frameworks having accessible volumes smaller than that of the neutral framework.

The CO2 and CH4 adsorption levels of 1 and related products (Fig. 5, S7 and S8†) were measured and the results are given in Table 1. Li+-exchanged 1s (Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d, Li+-1-10d) absorbed almost the same amount of CO2 as did 1 at 298 K, but absorbed obviously more CO2 than did 1 at 273 K. Similar trends were observed for the adsorption of CH4, but to a lesser extent. Of the Li+-exchanged 1s, Li+-1-2d gave the overall best performances for N2, CO2 and CH4 uptakes. Of the solvent-exchanged 1s, 1(6:1)-4d-ex showed the best uptakes for these three gases. For CO2 uptakes, Li+-1-2d, 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1 absorbed 41–43 ml g−1 (8.0–8.5 wt%) at 298 K and 1 atm—and, respectively, 65 ml g−1 (12.7 wt%), 58 ml g−1 (11.4 wt%) and 53 ml g−1 (10.5 wt%) at 273 K and 1 atm. For CH4 uptakes, Li+-1-2d, 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1-ex absorbed, respectively, 16 ml g−1 (1.2 wt%), 15 ml g−1 (1.1 wt%) and 13 ml g−1 (1.0 wt%) at 298 K and 1 atm; and, respectively, 26 ml g−1 (1.8 wt%), 24 ml g−1 (1.7 wt%) and 22 ml g−1 (1.6 wt%) at 273 K and 1 atm. The above results indicated the uptakes of CO2 and CH4 being favoured to a small extent by having Li+ in the channels and/or charged framework. At 9 atm, the absorption of these materials increased significantly (almost tripled) compared to the amounts at 1 atm.
 Fig. 5  CO2 (273 and 298 K) and CH4 (273 and 298 K) adsorption/desorption isotherms of 1-ex (a) and Li+-1-2d (b). 
Considering the low surface areas of these three materials (672, 594 and 407 m2 g−1, respectively), these uptakes were very high for MOFs.81,82 For example, the CO2 uptake of UiO-66 (Langmuir surface area: 1066 m2 g−1) was reported to be 65 cm3 g−1 CO2 at 273 K and 1 bar;83 and UiO(bpdc) was reported to display high CO2 and CH4 uptakes,84 to have a relatively large BET surface area (2646 m2 g−1), and to absorb 13.0 wt% CO2 and 1.3 wt% CH4 at 1 bar and 273 K, compared to Li+-1-2d, 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1-ex, which were shown to absorb 10.5–12.7 wt% CO2 and 1.6–1.8 wt% CH4 under the same conditions.
UV-Vis reflectance spectra
UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of H6TCPP (this work), 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, 1(8:1)-4d-ex and Li+-exchanged 1s in the form of absorbance versus wavelength are shown in Fig. 6. The above MOF compounds absorbed strongly in the 320–800 nm region and Li+-1-10d absorbed more light in the 680–800 nm region. The absorbance intensities and peak positions of the above MOF compounds were similar to those of H6TCPP except that H6TCPP absorbed more light in the 400–480 nm region and absorbed less in the 610–640 nm region than did the MOF compounds. It appeared that when the framework was neutral, the absorption intensity was relatively low, especially in the 470–660 nm region; and replacing the (CH3)2NH2+ with Li+ also apparently increased the adsorption intensities of the compounds except for the 670–800 nm region (for Li+-1-2d and Li+-1-5d).
 Fig. 6  UV-Vis reflectance spectra of (a) 1(4:1)-4d-ex (red), 1(6:1)-4d-ex (blue), 1(8:1)-4d-ex (green) compared to those of M2(TCS)(BPY) (M = Co, Ni and Cu), AlTCS-1, H4TCS and BPY; (b) Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d, Li+-1-10d and H6TCPP; and (c) 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, 1(8:1)-4d-ex and H6TCPP. 
The porphyrin spectrum showed, in the visible-light region, two important features related to π → π* transitions: the intense Soret band (S0 → S2) between 400 and 450 nm, and the weaker Q-bands (S0 → S1) between 500 and 700 nm, which also involved various vibrational states.85 The bands each at about 364 nm from 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, 1(8:1)-4d-ex and Li+-exchanged 1s were attributed to the Soret bands since they are usually stronger than Q bands, meaning that the Soret bands blue shifted compared to that of H6TCPP (418 nm) by 54 nm. The Q bands of the above four compounds were observed at 510, 547, 588, 645 nm, only slightly blue shifted compared to the 515, 550, 590, and 645 nm Q bands of solid H6TCPP.85
Previously, we acquired the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of AlTCS-1,60 [M2(TCS)(BPY)] (M = Co(1), Ni(2) and Cu(3); H4TCS = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) silane, BPY = 4,4′-bipyridine)61 using the same method and the same instrument as reported herein. These PMOFs absorbed visible light significantly more strongly than did AlTCS-1, but surprisingly less than [M2(TCS)(BPY)] (M = Co(1) and Cu(3)) in the range of 320–800 nm although the ligands (H4TCS and BPY) absorbs very limited visible light. Thus, we found that introducing Co(II) and Cu(II) transition metals in MOF structures could strongly increase the visible-light absorbance, even surpassing that of PMOFs.
Band edges of 1-DMF and its derived compounds
The CB edge (LUMO) and VB edge (HOMO) positions of the materials were also determined, by following the linear potential scan method, which can be viewed as producing partial cyclic voltammetry curves. This method is well established in the literature.60 The first oxidation potential (Eox) and the first reduction potential (Ered) can be observed by separate cathodic and anodic scans, respectively, and equal the energy levels of the HOMO (the CB edge) and LUMO (the VB edge) of the material, respectively. The band gap is the difference between Eox and Ered. As shown in Fig. 7, the valence and conduction band edge positions of 1-DMF were found to be −0.85 and 0.59 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode; and −0.65 and 0.79 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. The band gap was found to be 1.44 eV. We also carried out the same study on 1-ex, 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, 1(8:1)-4d-ex, Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d, and Li+-1-10d (Fig. S10–S12†). The band edge positions are summarized in Table 2. The band edge positions determined in pH = 5 H2SO4 (No. 2, 4) were slightly different from those in Tris-HCl solution (No. 1, 3). Since pH has been shown to affect the band edge positions of semiconductors,86–88 we chose to use values determined in neutral electrolyte (the 0.1 M Tris-HCl aqueous solution).

We observed an increase in band gap after solvent exchange. The CB edge position of 1-ex increased in magnitude from −0.85 V to −0.89 V (1-DMF), and the VB edge position decreased to 0.68 by 0.09 V from that of 1-ex, and the bandgap increased from 1.44 to 1.57 eV.
Despite a slightly negative framework for 1(4:1)-4d-ex (see the synthesis discussion section), and nearly neutral frameworks for 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex, they all were calculated to have nearly identical bandgaps and band edge positions, suggesting a relatively low sensitivity of these values to framework charge. Weak trends were nevertheless discerned, with a more negative framework associated with a decrease in the VB edge position, and increases in the CB edge position and bandgap. Making the framework neutral, as in the case of 1(6:1)-4d-ex and 1(8:1)-4d-ex, was found to be associated with increases in the CB and VB edge positions (to a higher-energy positions) by, respectively, 0.15 V and 0.10 V from those of 1-ex. The overall bandgap was determined to increase from 1.57 to 1.61 V.
Replacing (CH3)2NH2+ with Li+ resulted in compounds having nearly the same bandgap and band edge positions as those of 1-DMF, indicating the lack of any significant influence of the counterion type on these properties.
The bandgaps of 1(4:1)-4d-ex, 1(6:1)-4d-ex, 1(8:1)-4d-ex were determined to be 1.60–1.65 eV, very close to the values 1.60 eV determined by plots of (Abshυ)2vs. hυ based on UV-Vis reflectance spectra (Fig. S9†),61,89 suggesting that these semiconductors have direct band gaps. The bandgaps of Li+-1-2d, Li+-1-5d were determined to be 1.43–1.44 eV, the same as that determined by plots of (Abshυ)1/2vs. hυ based on UV-Vis reflectance spectra (Fig. S9†), suggesting that these semiconductors have indirect band gaps.
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO using 1-DMF
The CB and VB band-edge positions suggest that 1 and its derivative compounds could have applications as visible-light photocatalysts. When using 12 mg of H6TCPP as the catalyst and 11.3 mg of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 as cocatalysts, only 0.8 μmol of CO was produced over 14 h (efficiency: 5 μmol g−1 h−1). When using similar amounts of t 1-DMF (9.3 mg) in CH3CN and TEA (V/V: 4:1) without adding Ru(bpy)3Cl2, only a small amount of CO was formed (0.78 μmol over 8 h, efficiency: 10 μmol g−1 h−1). When adding Ru(bpy)3Cl2, the amounts of CO increased to 6.0 μmol over 8 h (efficiency: 56 μmol g−1 h−1) and 9.4 μmol over 14 h (efficiency: 50 μmol g−1 h−1). The catalyst was recovered and the second run was conducted, which also produced 3.6 μmol of CO over 14 h (efficiency: 22 μmol g−1 h−1). The PXRD of the recovered catalysts after two runs was essentially the same as that of the starting material (Fig. S6†). The recovered solution of the first run gave similar CO production as that using H6TCPP (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  Rates of production of CO from the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in CH3CN (40 ml) and triethylamine (10 ml) using (a) 9.3 mg of 1-DMF without adding tris(2,2′-bipyridine)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate (Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O), (b) 12 mg of H6TCPP and 11.3 mg of Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O, and (c) 13.5 mg of 1-DMF and 11.9 mg of Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O, (d) the catalyst of (c) after being centrifuged and washed with CH3CN and dried at room temperature for 2 d (here, about 2.0 mg of the catalyst was lost during the procedure, and a mass of 11.3 mg of Ru(bpy)3Cl2·6H2O was also added), and (e) the solution of reaction (c) after it was irradiated under the same reaction conditions as the others. 
Based on the redox potentials of Ru(bpy)32+ (denoted as RuII)90 and TEA,91,92 we derived the mechanism shown in Fig. 9. Without adding RuII, only TEA can donate electrons to the valence band to combine with the photogenerated holes, and the potential difference between the CB edge and the E°′(CO2/CO) (eqn (2), with H+ from water in CH3CN and TEA) was shown to be quite small (only 0.12 V), resulting in a low efficiency. When RuII was added, the RuII was excited by absorbing light at 452 nm to form RuII*, which donated electrons to the holes in the valence band of 1-DMF and formed RuIII. RuIII accepted electrons from TEA to form RuII. Thus, RuII not only absorbed visible light, but also acted as a visible-light photocatalyst. By adding RuII, more light was absorbed and holes were eliminated by TEA and RuII*, and perhaps also RuI, causing a much better charge separation than in the case when only TEA was present. CO2 + 2e− + 2H+ → CO + H2O E°′ = −0.53 V (pH = 7)(2)
 Fig. 9  Proposed mechanism for the formation of CO from the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using 1-DMF and Ru(bpy)32+ (denoted as RuII). 
By using visible-light catalysts90 such as Ru-polypyridyl or Ir-phenylpyridine, high CO formation rates have been achieved using MOF materials93–98 or other types of semiconductors (such as ZnCo2O4 and Co3O4 and CoP)99–101,102 under visible light. By using RuII and a conductive 2D-MOF Ni3(HITP)2 as the catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent, Deng and Peng et al.94 achieved a high CO yield rate of 3.45 × 104 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light, which was among the best performances. We think that the rather low overpotential between the CB edge and the E°′(CO2/CO) reduction potential was one possible reason for the poor performance of 1-DMF.
Conclusions
Due to their designability, semiconductor MOFs have been intensely studied as photocatalysts. In this work, a method of tuning the framework charge of MOF materials was developed and how the framework charge can affect the band-edge positions and bandgaps of PMOF 1 was investigated. Our work indicated that the occupancy of metal ions of a MOF framework, when less than 1.0, could be adjusted by adjusting the reaction time and the amounts of the metal ions in the reaction mixture, and thus the framework charge of the MOF material can be tuned. We also demonstrated an influence of framework charge on band edge positions and bandgaps, but a lack of influence of the counterion type on these properties at least in the case of PMOF 1 with (CH3)2NH+ or Li+ as the counterions.
In addition, we were able to increase the water stability of the carboxylate Cd(II) PMOFs by involving the trapped species. These species can apparently block the channels or become entrapped in them and hence prevent enough water molecules from entering and destroying the framework. This strategy can be used to increase the water stability of MOFs.
Considering the small specific surface areas of PMOF 1 and its derived PMOFs (407–672 m2 g−1), their CO2 and CH4 storage capabilities were found to be rather high. They absorbed 44–65 ml g−1 (8.7–12.7%) and 22–26 ml g−1 (1.6–1.8%) of these gases, respectively, at 1.0 atom and 273 K; at 9.0 atm these values nearly tripled. Li+-exchanged 1 was found to favour N2, CO2 and CH4 adsorption, especially at 9 atm and a relatively low temperature (273 K).
Finally, this work demonstrated that Ru(bpy)3Cl2 could effectively increase the photogenerated charge separation by eliminating the holes. It was found to act as not only an absorber of visible light but also as a visible-light photocatalyst, and increased the performance of 1-DMF about 5 fold. Thus, our work demonstrated that using transition-metal-complex catalysts90 as co-catalysts is a very effective method of increasing the efficiency of the photocatalysis of chemical reactions. This strategy has started to attract attention in recent years.93–102
