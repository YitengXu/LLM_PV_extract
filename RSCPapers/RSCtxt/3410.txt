1. Introduction
Among the various types of functional materials, oxide-based systems play a strategic role in many areas of chemistry, physics and materials science, thanks to their broad variety of structures, stoichiometries and chemico-physical properties.1 Their assembly into nano-arrays and composite architectures with tailored features is of key importance due to the unique effects arising from the large interfacial area, high defect content and quantum confinement of charge carriers.2–12 As a matter of fact, the control of the system nano-organization, with special focus on the interplay between structure, morphology and composition, offers several degrees of freedom for a plethora of technological applications. The latter span from heterogeneous catalysis13,14 to photo-activated energy production and pollutant removal,15–18 from chemical sensing19-20 to innovative batteries,21,22 up to piezoelectric nanogenerators,23 information storage, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaics.24–26
In the last decade, increasing efforts have been devoted to the preparation of multi-component oxide-based nanosystems with diverse morphological organizations.7,8,10–12,27–37 This interest is fuelled by the possibility of joining the multi-functional behaviour of low-dimensional materials with the synergistic interplay between single component properties.9,10,38 For instance, an improved charge carrier separation occurs at metal/semiconductor (SC) oxide interfaces due to the formation of Schottky barriers, with significant benefits in various areas including luminescence, molecular detection and photo-activated H2 production.27,29,39–45 In a similar way, the controlled formation of oxide/oxide p–n junctions and the related electron transfer processes are responsible for improved performances in optoelectronics, photocatalysis or gas sensing with respect to single-phase systems.25,46–54 In addition, increasing attention has been devoted to the combination of oxides and carbon-based nanomaterials, especially involving carbon nanotubes (CNTs), that display attractive properties in terms of chemical and mechanical stability, adsorption capacity, electrical conductivity and nano-size effects.9,55–64 Such features pave the way to the use of the resulting carbon/oxide composites in various fields, including wear-resistant materials, electronic/magnetic nanodevices, supercapacitors, photocatalysts and gas sensors.7,9,24,28,58–63,65–67 In all the above cases, the development of composite systems with an intimate contact between the constituents is a key issue to exploit a unique chemical reactivity and obtain unprecedented and improved performances.9,10,15,27
The assembly of multi-component nanomaterials with controlled morphology, from nanopowders to supported 1D materials and hierarchical nanostructures,1,5,23,27,56,68–74 requires the development of versatile and efficient fabrication procedures, which have a crucial influence on the ultimate system behaviour.68 Among the different techniques, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes, involving the controlled transformation of molecular precursors from the vapor phase into the target materials, are well-established pathways to oxide-based systems. The main advantages offered by CVD are high flexibility, high growth rate, good control of the reaction environment, excellent conformal step coverage and adaptability to large scale processing.63,74–80 The unique tailoring of nanomaterial morphology, enabled by a careful control of operational parameters under non-equilibrium conditions, has been exploited for the fabrication of various systems, from inorganic oxides to carbon-based systems, in the form of nanopowders, coatings, nanocrystals, nanorods (NRs) and nanotubes (NTs).7,8,56,57,63,74,78–88 Beyond the great interest devoted to CVD precursor design and synthesis,89–93 intensive efforts have led to the development of a large variety of CVD processes, related to different precursor delivery and operational/activation modes. These involve atmospheric or low pressure-CVD (AP-CVD or LP-CVD),78–80,94 fluidized-bed CVD, liquid injection-CVD (LI-CVD),75,76 aerosol assisted-CVD (AA-CVD)95 and plasma enhanced-CVD (PE-CVD).69,71,74,86,94 In the last decade, the interest in oxide-based nanomaterials has also triggered combination of CVD tools with other techniques, such as Sol–Gel (SG), to obtain oxide/oxide systems,96,97 and sputtering, to yield metal/oxide materials.27,39,40,44,45,98 Yet, beyond these examples, the large majority of work has been devoted to single-phase materials, whereas the obtainment of multi-component systems by CVD-related routes undoubtedly deserves further attention.
In this highlight, we aim to give a brief overview of CVD-related growth of multi-component nanosystems possessing as a common feature the presence of an oxide material. We will focus our main attention on bi-component systems, and, in particular, on three distinct material categories based on metal/oxide (section 2), oxide/oxide (section 3) and carbon/oxide (section 4). The examples provided herein include various kinds of nanomaterials, from multi-layers to NR-based composites, and do not consider solid solutions, which are beyond the aim of the present paper. Emphasis is given to innovative approaches to multi-component nanomaterials, with regard to current trends and future directions. Although many excellent works/reviews focused on different kinds of inorganic and hybrid multi-component systems have been published up to date,9–11,15,18,27,37,63,64,73,74,78–80,94,99–101 no similar literature survey on oxide-based nanocomposite systems obtained by CVD-related methods has been attempted so far.
2. Metal/oxide nanomaterials
In this section, the growth of multi-component metal/oxide nanomaterials by CVD-related techniques will be discussed, focusing on metal nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in oxide matrices or dispersed over their surfaces. The vividly ongoing research of such materials is motivated by various applications with far-reaching technological impact, including plasmonics and photoluminescence, as well as anti-bacterial systems, photocatalysts and gas sensors.15,18,27,33,37,39,40,44,45,102,103 As a general rule, the properties exhibited by the final material are directly dependent on the nature and composition of metal and oxide counterparts, as well as on metal NP size, shape and dispersion.18,94 In this regard, Bahlawane et al. recently reported on a novel single-pot LI-CVD route to nanocomposite films formed by metal NPs (Ni, Cu, Ag, Au…) embedded in ZnO matrices, by alternating tailored pulse sequences for the deposition of the single components (Fig. 1). The in situ formation of metal NPs enabled by this approach is an effective mean to minimize their agglomeration/segregation and to ensure their homogeneous distribution. This is indeed displayed by TEM micrographs of Fig. 1b, showing faceted Ni NPs immersed in a ZnO matrix. These results disclose interesting perspectives for the development of 3D high-density magnetic recording media.104 In the case of gold, progressive variations of deposition time resulted in an increase of NP dimensions, and a parallel shift of the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) peak, originating from collective oscillations of conduction electrons as described by the Mie theory.27,33,105 This shift was also affected by the concurrence of the spill-out effect and plasmon coupling phenomena, dominating at lower and higher NP sizes, respectively.104
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic representation of metal/oxide nanocomposites grown by LI-CVD from precursor ethanolic solutions. (b) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Ni/ZnO nanosystems obtained starting from Ni(II) and Zn(II) acetylacetonates. (c) Normalized optical absorption spectra for Au/ZnO systems with different Au particle size/density, that were controlled by variations of the growth time for the metallic phase [t(Au)]. In this case, methyl(triphenylphosphine) gold(I) was chosen as the metal precursor (adapted from ref. 104). 
Another one-step process towards metal NPs embedded in a metal oxide host was demonstrated by Palgrave and Parkin, who reported on the preparation of Au/TiO2 or Au/WO3 nanocomposites by AA-CVD using HAuCl4, Ti(OiPr)4 (OiPr = iso-propoxide) and tungsten phenoxide as precursors for Au, Ti and W, respectively.106 AA-CVD uses a liquid–gas aerosol to transport soluble precursors to the heated growth surface and enables to overcome restrictions of precursors exhibiting low volatility and/or thermal instability.34 SPR absorption of gold nanoparticles underwent a red-shift and an intensity increase upon increasing Au concentration in the precursor solution due to the higher Au NP density and dimensions, resulting in enhanced NP–NP interactions. Tuning of the above SPR properties can be advantageously exploited in light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices.104
Notably, the above described LI-CVD and AA-CVD methods for the fabrication of embedded metal NPs are very versatile and can thus be adapted to the fabrication of various metal/oxide systems on different kinds of substrates.
As a matter of fact, ZnO-based systems are among the most investigated metal/oxide composites obtained by CVD-based approaches. In this regard, Becker et al. synthesized Cu/ZnO systems by a two-step CVD approach, starting from Cu(II) diethylamino-2-propoxide and bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amido]zinc.107 Under mild conditions, highly dispersed Cu particles with an intimate Cu/ZnO contact could be obtained, leading to higher turn-over frequencies in methanol synthesis than for the homologous commercial ternary catalysts.
Another interesting example of CVD grown ZnO-based materials is provided by Wu et al.103 The authors developed Au/ZnO nanocomposites by combining the CVD growth of ZnO NRs and the subsequent photo-deposition of gold NPs (Fig. 2a). Under optimized temperature conditions, ordered ZnO nanorod arrays could be synthesized (Fig. 2b), with a surface area 30 times larger compared to a ZnO film having the same geometric area. The subsequent gold deposition led to uniformly dispersed Au NPs on the ZnO NR tips (Fig. 2c). The presence of metallic gold in the outermost region of ZnO NRs resulted in higher photocatalytic activities for the degradation of methyl orange aqueous solutions, the best performances corresponding to Au NPs with diameters <15 nm. This result, ascribed to a higher concentration of Au/ZnO Schottky barriers for lower metal particle sizes, demonstrates that charge separation at metal/oxide junctions can be tuned by a proper choice of processing conditions.
 Fig. 2  (a) Scheme of the synthesis procedure adopted for the preparation of Au/ZnO nanocomposites. After the CVD of ZnO from Zn(II) acetylacetonate at 525 °C on Si(100) substrates, dispersion of Au nanoparticles was performed by photo-deposition from HAuCl4 ethanolic solutions (10−4 mol L−1) under UV illumination (30 min). (b) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of ZnO NRs. (c) Back-scattered electron micrograph of Au/ZnO nanocomposites (adapted from ref. 103). 
Following a scheme similar to that of Fig. 2a, our research group recently focused on multi-functional Ag/ZnO nanocomposites developed by a PE-CVD/sputtering hybrid route.44,45 This two-step synthesis approach involved the PE-CVD of strongly oriented ZnO arrays, followed by silver sputtering. Taking advantage of the infiltration power of the latter technique, a controlled in-depth distribution of Ag NPs in the ZnO matrix was achieved. A key point of the present strategy was the use of mild processing conditions, enabled by the unique activation mechanisms occurring in cold plasmas.44 In particular, the (001) ZnO growth was further promoted by the sheath electric field,108 leading to NRs oriented perpendicularly to the substrate surface. At variance with the results of Wu et al.,103 the deposited Ag NPs diffused through zinc oxide grain boundaries down to the interface thanks to the porous ZnO morphology, resulting in an intimate metal/oxide contact (Fig. 3b). This feature was indeed the key point to obtain an appreciable H2 photo-production upon UV-Vis irradiation, whereas pure ZnO specimens did not show any significant activity (Fig. 3c). Beside the Schottky junction between ZnO and Ag NPs, preventing electron–hole recombination, a further promotion of the observed process might result from the unique reactivity of silver(I) oxide species, present at the Ag/ZnO interface, and to the formation of Ag2O/ZnO p–n junctions.44 The same phenomena were likely responsible for enhanced gas sensing responses in ethanol detection upon silver introduction in zinc oxide (Fig. 3d). The beneficial impact of Ag NPs could be also observed in the detection of acetone and ozone, and a discrimination between oxidizing and reducing analytes was possible at different working temperatures. Overall, these features are of great interest for the development of multi-functional Ag/ZnO systems with improved performances.

The systems were obtained by PE-CVD of ZnO from a bis(ketoiminato) precursor, followed by Ag sputtering from Ar plasmas at 60 °C (5 W) and annealing at 400 °C in air. (c) H2 evolution by photoreforming of H2O/CH3OH solutions under UV-Vis illumination, and (d) gas sensing response to ethanol at 300 °C for pure ZnO and Ag/ZnO nanocomposites supported on polycrystalline Al2O3 (adapted from ref. 44, 45). 
The joint CVD/sputtering technique has also led to interesting results for more complex metal/oxide systems. For instance, our attention was devoted to the combination of CuO and TiO2 with Au NPs. These materials take advantage of the higher TiO2 stability against photocorrosion and the improved chemical reactivity in H2 production by visible light irradiation enabled by gold NPs.15 As sketched in Fig. 4a, these systems were prepared by a two-step thermal CVD process and ultimately functionalized with Au NPs by sputtering.39,40 Under these conditions, CuO aggregates with a mean size of 400 nm were obtained. The porous system morphology, indicative of a high active area, led to a homogeneous in-depth dispersion of TiO2 and gold particles (mean size = 5–10 nm). Such a controlled nanocomposite design was the key factor in obtaining attractive performances for photo-assisted hydrogen production by means of the sole Vis light, with higher rates in comparison to those offered by Ag/ZnO systems (see above and Fig. 4c). This behaviour could be traced back to the improved Vis absorption of CuO with respect to ZnO, depending on the lower band gap of the former [EG(CuO) = 1.2 eV; EG(ZnO) = 3.4 eV].15,39,44,108 The doubling of H2 yield upon Au introduction was attributed to: i) the unique catalytic activity of nanosized gold NPs; ii) their above discussed benefits in improving the separation of photo-generated charge carriers; iii) their SPR absorption (compare Fig. 1), resulting in an enhanced light harvesting. Metal NP introduction was also responsible for the remarkable response enhancement in O3 sensing at temperatures as low as 100 °C (Fig. 4d). This result, along with the negligible response to possible interfering species,40 is extremely promising in view of technological applications of such multi-functional nanocomposites.

Au sputtering was performed at 5 W and 60 °C from Ar plasmas. (b) Field emission (FE)-SEM and HR-TEM images for Au/CuO/TiO2 systems.

3. Oxide/oxide nanomaterials
As already discussed in the Introduction, the design and preparation of nanocomposites based on SC oxides is an important goal for various applications, such as magnetism, optoelectronics, photocatalysis and gas sensing.12,15,30,35,36,38,109 In line with motivations fuelling the attention on metal/oxide systems, some efforts in the fabrication of oxide/oxide nanostructures involve coupling of a target matrix (for instance, Al2O3, ZnO or ZrO2) with a catalytic promoter (such as MoO3, TiO2 or CeO2), and are often aimed at achieving an enhanced charge carrier lifetime.36,96,97,110,111 In this context, p–n composite SCs have come under intense scrutiny due to the build-up of an electric field at the junction interfaces.54 As anticipated, this phenomenon is advantageous for optoelectronics, thanks to the resulting rectifying effects, and photocatalysis, due to the increased lifetime of photo-generated electrons and holes.25,46–51,53 As regards gas sensing applications, the combination of p- and n-type nanomaterials can provide enhanced performances due to the formation of a more extended depletion layer.38,54 In this section, selected multi-component oxide/oxide systems with different morphological organization will be presented, with the purpose of providing an overview of CVD versatility and benefits in their obtainment.
Beyond the classical multi-layered materials, CVD approaches offer a significant potential for the production of different morphologies. For instance, Xia et al. synthesized ZrO2/SiO2 nanocomposites by CVD of [Zr(OiPr)2(tBuaoac)2] (tBuaoac = tert-butylacetoacetate) on SiO2 gels at 300 °C under O2-containing atmospheres.112 The surface Zr concentration increased linearly with Zr loading, and TEM studies pointed to the formation of a ZrO2 monolayer on the SiO2 support, thanks to the typical conformal coverage of CVD processes. The high dispersion degree for ZrO2 on SiO2 was attributed to a strong interaction between Zr and Si species through the formation of Si–O–Zr bonds. Notably, the use of moderate temperatures prevented the formation of undesired ternary phases.
Whereas many reports have focused on the incorporation of noble metal NPs into metal oxide hosts, as discussed in section 2, fewer examples of oxide NPs incorporated into oxide matrices are available. In this context, Warwick et al. reported on the use of a hybrid AA-CVD/AP-CVD method, which combines the versatility in precursor choice of AA-CVD with the mechanical robustness of films prepared by AP-CVD.34 In this way, pre-formed TiO2 and CeO2 nanoparticles manufactured by hydrothermal synthesis and dispersed in methanol could be incorporated into VO2 matrices, obtained from V(acac)2 (acac = 2,4-pentanedionate) between 500 and 600 °C. Vanadium dioxide was chosen as a matrix as it is a well-known thermochromic material with a wide range of uses, including solar heat control coatings. Conversely, TiO2 and CeO2 possess well-established photocatalytic properties. Hence, the target combination enables the development of thermochromic-photocatalytic materials, with potential applications as both energy-saving and self-cleaning coatings.
Thanks to the moderate process temperatures and the inherent infiltration power, PE-CVD processes are a powerful tool to be integrated with other nanofabrication approaches for nanocomposite development. In particular, beyond the specific CVD-based approach, a unifying concept in the preparation of oxide/oxide composites is the use of a porous host matrix for the subsequent dispersion of guest particles. In this regard, Armelao et al. proposed a hybrid PE-CVD/SG approach to CeO2/ZrO2 nanocomposites, based on the PE-CVD of CeO2 (guest) from Ce(dpm)4 onto a porous ZrO2 xerogel (host) prepared by SG, at temperatures as low as 200 °C.96,97 The proposed pathway takes advantage of the inherent xerogel porosity and high amount of –OH groups, which can provide active sites for successive chemical modifications on both the surface and sub-surface layers. Moreover, PE-CVD enables the obtainment of nanosystems thanks to the competition between deposition/ablation phenomena, producing an intimate host–guest intermixing. Such effects can be further enhanced by ex situ thermal treatments, resulting in CeO2/ZrO2 composites with tailored features. The flexibility of the proposed strategy makes it an attractive tool for the preparation of various multi-functional nanosystems.
The convincing evidence for the fruitfulness of PE-CVD in nanocomposite development has recently been demonstrated by us for Co3O4/ZnO nanomaterials (Fig. 5a).38 The adopted strategy, which has never been previously reported for the synthesis of such systems, involves the initial ZnO deposition under optimized conditions108 (see also section 2), followed by the dispersion of Co3O4 particles. As shown in Fig. 5, the process resulted in the synthesis of columnar ZnO arrays with an average length of 120 nm and a strong (001) orientation (compare Fig. 3), over which Co3O4 nanoparticles were dispersed. The relatively mild conditions enabled the formation of Co3O4/ZnO composites free from ternary phases, with Co3O4 outermost thickness controllable by varying the cobalt oxide deposition time (Fig. 5d, g). Concomitantly, the system morphology, initially characterized by globular-like particles, underwent a progressive change towards pyramidal-like aggregates, a typical Co3O4 growth habit associated to the exposure of low surface energy (111) planes.98 The controlled morphology and intimate p-Co3O4/n-ZnO contact are attractive features for eventual applications not only in gas sensing,38 but also in photocatalysis for both pollutant degradation and H2 production.

In both cases, PE-CVD was performed from Ar/O2 plasmas, with a RF-power of 20 W. Plane-view/cross-sectional FE-SEM images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) line-scan profiles for samples obtained with a Co3O4 deposition time of 60 min (b–d) and 120 min (e–g). 
In the current tide of oxide nanostructures, materials based on iron oxides are promising for manifold magnetic and biomedical applications.24,113 In this regard, Mathur et al. produced an interesting example of one-dimensional core–shell SnO2/Fe3O4 (magnetite) structures (Fig. 6). As can be observed, initially grown tin dioxide nanowires were uniformly covered by a dense assembly of Fe3O4 nanocrystals, forming a polycrystalline layer. Such a result was enabled by the inherent conformal coverage of CVD techniques, leading to interconnected magnetite superstructures with several junctions at the microscale. Investigations on the electrical and magnetic properties for the obtained systems are expected to pave the way to their applications in spintronics.113
 Fig. 6  Representative SEM micrographs of: (a) SnO2 nanowires, and (b) core–shell SnO2/Fe3O4 nanostructures obtained by a two-step CVD route. In the first processing step, SnO2 growth was performed from Sn(OtBu)4 (OtBu = tert-butoxy) by catalyst-assisted CVD, followed by the deposition of Fe3O4 from [Fe(OtBu)3]2. (c) Modulation of electronic properties for the target SnO2/Fe3O4 nanostructures (CB = conduction band; VB = valence band; adapted from ref. 113). 
In the same context, the Mathur group recently presented another interesting example of SnO2 core–shell systems.110 In particular, core–shell SnO2/TiO2 wires were fabricated by a two-step thermal CVD process (Fig. 7), growing first single-crystalline SnO2 rods and subsequently a conformal TiO2 overlayer. Interestingly, the length, diameter, and lateral density of SnO2 NRs and the thickness of TiO2 shell could be precisely tuned by controlling the CVD parameters, such as the precursor flow and deposition time.

(a) TEM image of the as-prepared core-shell structure; (b) SEM and (c) HR-TEM of SnO2/TiO2 composites after annealing in air at 950 °C. (d) Photobleaching of methyl violet aqueous solutions as a function of UV-Vis irradiation time by various nanowires and thin films (adapted from ref. 110). 
The effect of annealing in air on the system properties was also investigated. At 950 °C, the rod-like morphology was preserved, despite a significant surface roughening taking place. These results indicate a good thermal stability of the present nanomaterials, an important pre-requisite for their functional applications. Notably, the photocatalytic properties of these core–shell NRs in dye degradation were improved with respect not only to single-phase SnO2 and TiO2 films, but also to pure SnO2 rods (Fig. 7d). Possible phenomena explaining the higher activity are size effects, surface area increase due to TiO2 deposition, and improved charge separation at the oxide/oxide interface.110
Despite most of the examples discussed in this section being devoted to nanocomposites based on two single-phase oxides, attention has been recently paid to more complex multi-component oxide/oxide systems. For example, Pan et al. embedded ferrimagnetic CoFe2O4 branched filaments in a piezoelectric PbTiO3 matrix by a one-step CVD process on SrTiO3 (001), based on the simultaneous vaporization of Co(dpm)3, Fe(dpm)3, Pb(OEt)4 (OEt = ethoxy) and Ti(OtBu)4.109 CoFe2O4 filaments reduced the CoFe2O4/PbTiO3 interfacial strain and induced a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Nevertheless, due to the increased system complexity, research efforts in this area are still highly required to attain a deeper understanding of the system structure–property interrelations.
4. Carbon/oxide nanomaterials
The last category of oxide-based systems examined in this highlight, carbon/oxide nanocomposites, lies at the borderline between inorganic and organic materials. Such systems encompass a large variety of carbon nano-organized forms, from graphite sheets to carbon nanowalls (CNWs) and 1D structures, namely CNTs and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). As anticipated in the Introduction, considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of carbon/oxide nanomaterials for a broad range of applications, including improvement of supercapacitors,9 fracture toughness,58 electromagnetic shielding/microwave absorption,59 photocatalysis,62,81 gas detection,61 energy storage devices,28,58,65 fuel cells67 and electrodes for Li-ion batteries.9,114 In the latter case, various examples of carbon/oxide nanomaterials have been recently reviewed.7,114 In spite of these efforts, the use of CVD-based approaches to obtain similar kind of materials is still relatively limited and most of the pertaining works have been focused on powdered materials.24,59,63,66,67 In the following, the discussion will be devoted to supported carbon/oxide nanomaterials, highlighting some key advantages of CVD-based approaches through specific examples.
As discussed in the previous sections, TiO2 has received considerable attention owing to its manifold applications. However, the practical use of TiO2 powders presents various drawbacks,81 whereas its immobilization on conventional solid substrates was found to reduce its functional efficiency.115 In order to overcome such problems, the fabrication of hybrid nanomaterials formed by nanostructured TiO2 onto single-wall CNTs has been successfully achieved (Fig. 8a). To this regard, Fig. 8b shows self-organized NTs joined together in bundles, grown perpendicularly to the substrate surface. Upon TiO2 deposition (Fig. 8c), a compact and uniform coverage along the whole CNT length took place and the orientation of the bundles was maintained. The good contact and adherence between supporting CNTs and the TiO2 coating represents a critical point for applications in photovoltaics and photocatalysis, enhancing light absorption and improving charge transfer processes.
 Fig. 8  (a) Preparation strategy for TiO2/CNT composites. Representative FE-SEM micrographs of: (b) bare CNTs; (c) TiO2-coated CNTs. A higher resolution image is presented in the inset. The systems have been obtained by a two-stage procedure, based on: i) the initial CNT preparation by CVD on Fe-coated Si(100) substrates at 900 °C; ii) the CVD of anatase TiO2 from Ti(OiPr)4 under a N2 atmosphere at 400 °C (adapted from ref. 115). 
Beyond these applications, CVD of TiO2 has also been performed on multi-wall CNTs in view of gas sensing applications.61 In particular, activity improvements were observed for high surface area systems characterized by an intimate CNT/TiO2 contact. In this regard, the p–CNT/n–TiO2 heterojunction plays an important role in the observed sensing performances.
Another example of the successful formation of carbon/oxide heterojunctions was shown by Wang et al.62 In this case, the first growth stage involved the deposition of 2D carbon nanowalls (Fig. 9a–b), which, under optimized conditions, were homogeneously distributed and aligned perpendicularly to the substrate. As illustrated in Fig. 9c, the porous CNW morphology was conformally covered by TiO2 with excellent uniformity. A variation of TiO2 deposition time from 5 to 15 min resulted in a parallel increase in the thickness of the 2D structures from tenths of nanometres to approximately 200 nm. TiO2 growth occurred at the CNW surface and gradually expanded to the empty space between them, which was indeed progressively reduced. For TiO2 deposition times of 20 min, quasi-continuous films were obtained.
 Fig. 9  (a) CVD route to TiO2-coated CNWs. After CNW growth on Ti substrates from H2 and CH4 at 700 °C, TiO2 deposition was performed at 320 °C starting from Ti(OiPr)4. Plane-view SEM images of (b) bare CNWs and (c) CNWs covered by TiO2 (deposition time = 5 min). (d) Photocatalytic degradation of phenol aqueous solutions as a function of UV illumination, comparing the performances of TiO2/CNW systems obtained at different TiO2 deposition times (adapted from ref. 62). 
The results of the photocatalytic activity in phenol degradation under UV illumination are displayed in Fig. 9d. After irradiation for ∼4 h, 62% of phenol was degraded without any photocatalyst. In contrast, the degradation efficiency was 71, 86 and 96% for TiO2 deposition times of 5, 15 and 10 min, respectively, a phenomenon attributed to an optimal thickness of TiO2/CNW heterojunction under the latter conditions. It is worth noting that the best sample showed superior properties compared to pure TiO2 systems, mainly due to an enhanced separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the TiO2/CNW junction region. These observations open intriguing perspectives for the use of TiO2/CNW systems even in other related applications, such as gas sensors and light conversion devices.
Great attention has also been devoted to decorating carbon nanostructures with oxides different from TiO2. Zhang et al. deposited Fe2O3/TiO2 coatings on carbon fibers, possessing a large pore volume and a uniform micropore size distribution.81 CVD processes were performed at 600 °C under a N2 flow starting from Ti(OtBu)4 and Fe(CO)5 as precursors, and adjusting the Fe/Ti ratios by controlling the Fe(CO)5 source temperature. The fiber pore structure was well preserved after loading with Fe2O3/TiO2 coatings, and the systems displayed attractive photocatalytic properties in methyl orange degradation under Vis light. Such a phenomenon could be related to TiO2 photosensitization with Fe2O3, for which the use of an optimal loading window maximizes its charge transfer action suppressing, at the same time, the action of Fe(III) as recombination center.
The functionalization of 1D carbon nanostructures with transition metal oxides different from TiO2 and possessing various redox states has received attention for the development of hybrid supercapacitor electrodes.9,60 In this regard, Chen et al. deposited IrO2 nanocrystallites onto CNTs (Fig. 10a).28 The initial CNT surface was uniformly covered by IrO2 aggregates, whose morphology varied from particle-like to tube-like as the growth time increased from 5 to 60 min. Notably, literature reports about nanotube-on-nanotube growth are rather scarce.59 HAADF-STEM analysis (Fig. 10b) showed that CNTs maintained their hollow structure after deposition of IrO2. The particle-like IrO2 coating may be used as a protective layer on CNTs, enabling stable and uniform field emission properties, whereas the tube-like structure may increase the surface-to-volume ratio, making the present IrO2/CNT nanocomposites attractive candidates for supercapacitor applications.

(b) HAADF-STEM and SEM (inset) micrographs of an IrO2/CNT composite obtained with an IrO2 growth time of 60 min (adapted from ref. 28). 
In the latter field, the use of carbon/manganese oxide materials is particularly promising because of the low toxicity, reduced cost, and outstanding structural versatility of manganese oxides. In this context, Liu et al.65 reported on vertically aligned CNFs (VACNFs) coaxially coated with MnO2. The latter can provide a potential solution for both large active area and good electrical connection, if grown on conductive substrates. The systems were obtained by a combined PE-CVD and electrodeposition approach (Fig. 11a). The average VACNF length was 4 μm, resulting in an aspect ratio ≥27. The well-defined vertical alignment and the large open space between VACNFs enables the electrolyte to easily access the entire surface of all CNFs, producing a uniform manganese oxide deposition (Fig. 11b). Thanks to the CNF high conductivity and large area, along with the MnO2 conformal coverage and redox activity, outstanding supercapacitor characteristics could be achieved. Charge–discharge curves (Fig. 11c) were nearly linear and symmetric, highlighting an excellent electrochemical reversibility. This feature, along with the high specific energy and power, indicated that these new architectures can be potentially developed as multi-functional electrical energy storage devices.

After HNO3 treatment to remove the latter, cathodic electrodeposition of MnO2 was performed from Mn(II) acetate solution, resulting in a uniform coverage of the MnO2 core (TEM micrograph, b). (c) Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves for an acid-treated sample obtained with 20 min of MnO2 deposition (I0 = 0.3 mA cm−2; adapted from ref. 65). 
Recent studies also involved the use of graphene to fabricate hybrid carbon/oxide nanomaterials with tailored properties. As an example, Lee et al. developed MnO2/graphene composites by a hybrid approach, consisting of the alternating electrodeposition of MnO2 and CVD of graphene sheets.116 The obtained systems were tested as electrodes for supercapacitors, and the results showed that graphene intercalation was a key tool to enhance both the electroconductivity and capacitance of the MnO2 electrode. In a different way, Lin et al. reported on the CVD of hybrid composites comprising large-area graphene layers and ZnO nanostructures. The combination of electrical and optical properties of graphene and ZnO building blocks provides unique characteristics for future optoelectronic devices.117
5. Summary and outlook
This highlight has examined a series of selected aspects related to multi-component nanosystems developed by CVD-based approaches, possessing oxide materials as a common platform. We have divided the target composites into three main groups, metal/oxide, oxide/oxide and carbon/oxide, mainly focusing on systems with controlled morphological organization supported on solid substrates. Each of these categories has been given a dedicated section reviewing representative experimental results and some relevant applications associated to that type of nanosystems.
Notwithstanding the considerable progress made on multi-component materials in recent years, their fabrication and utilization open new fundamental and applicative challenges. Besides nano-size phenomena, other effects concurring in determining the nanomaterial overall behaviour are structure–morphology interrelations and phenomena arising at material interfaces, which can be controlled by proper synthetic approaches. In this regard, CVD-related techniques are amenable preparation tools due to their inherent flexibility that, beside offering several degrees of freedom, allows integration into multi-step fabrication of composite materials.
We believe that further appropriate combinations of CVD processes with other nanostructure preparation methods stand a good chance for the efficient development of multi-component nanosystems. In addition, CVD-related routes offer the possibility of future up-scaling and commercialization, one of the key issues towards technological exploitation of functional nanocomposites in advanced devices.
Nevertheless, progress in this area has to date been driven by phenomenological investigation. In fact, the knowledge of interrelations between operating conditions (such as precursor nature, temperature, pressure, reaction atmosphere…) and the system nano-organization have been largely based on an empirical approach. Indeed, the exact growth mechanisms, as well as the interdependence between specific process parameters and the overall nanostructure formation, are not yet understood in detail on a rational basis. Furthermore, a deeper insight into the nature, concentration and spatial distribution of defects, which play a key influence on the system performances, is highly demanded. Last but not least, additional research progress in this field needs a deeper understanding of complex phenomena responsible for interfacial effects, governing the synergistic coupling of material properties. The achievement of this goal undoubtedly requires the combined use of advanced characterization methods, including in situ techniques and flexible theoretical modeling, which can yield unique information on the system nucleation and growth dynamics. To this aim, well-defined interfaces will ensure advancements in the exploitation of nano-scale effects, such as tunneling and quantum confinement of charge carriers, to tailor the system optical and electrical properties. Disclosing general concepts and key ideas in this area can in fact be a magic spyglass for a deeper knowledge of fundamental phenomena and for the development of novel materials and devices.
