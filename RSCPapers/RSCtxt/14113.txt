    , Accepted 26th April 2020First published on 27th April 2020AbstractA facile and low-cost method for preparing a nickel–cobalt phosphide/multilayer graphene (MLG) (NiCoP/MLG) composite was developed in this study using a new strategy. NiCoP/MLG was prepared through calcination of NiCo-benzoate layered double hydroxide (NiCo-B-LDH) to obtain NiCoO2/MLG first followed by phosphorization to obtain the composite of NiCoP/MLG. Here, NiCo-B-LDH served as a self-sacrificing template. The obtained porous flower-like NiCoP/MLG was tested as a material for supercapacitor electrodes, which exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (1419.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), durability at high current density and long-term operation with 91.7% capacitance retention after more than 3000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. Moreover, the symmetrical supercapacitor based on NiCoP/MLG delivered a high energy density of 32.19 W h kg−1 at a power density of 741.65 W kg−1. Therefore, the as-prepared NiCoP/MLG could serve as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode material.
1. Introduction
With the gradual increase of population and the rapid industrialization of developing countries, the non-renewable energy sources have been unable to meet the increasing global energy demand.1 Therefore, development of new energy sources and new technologies associated with energy conversion and storage is urgently needed.2 Supercapacitors are energy storage devices with a high power density and long life,3,4 which can be divided into electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudo capacitors. The former are based on the adsorption of ions on active materials, and the latter work through rapid and reversible surface redox reactions.5–8 It is well known that electrodes made from pseudo capacitance materials such as transition metal oxides and conducting polymers usually show higher specific capacitance than those made of carbon materials with electrochemical double layer capacitance.
Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted particular attention due to their higher theoretical pseudo capacitance. Compared with the corresponding oxides, TMP has a non-metallic structure and good electrical conductivity, which give it good application prospects in the field of capacitors. Phosphide nanoparticles,9,10 nanowires11 and nanosheets12 have shown good performance as pseudo capacitance electrodes. However, due to their poor rate performance, low cyclic stability and insufficient electrochemical activity, the development of TMPs has been limited. Many research groups are currently making efforts to improve TMP performance. Dong13et al. reported that the electrochemical performance of a P-doped reduced graphene oxide/Ni–Co phosphide composite was better than that of TMP.
It is currently understood that the capacitive properties depend to a large extent on the morphology, porosity and crystallinity of the electrode material, and that a porous structure is especially beneficial for effective ion and electron transport. Another way to improve the electrochemical properties of materials is to introduce conductive phases, such as carbon, into active electrode materials. In the field of energy storage, during the last decade, carbon materials and their composites such as carbon nanotubes, carbon gels and graphene have become popular candidates. Recently, researchers have paid more attention to graphene because of its outstanding physical/chemical properties, which include high room temperature electron mobility, high theoretical specific surface area and good chemical stability.14 In addition, graphene has excellent electrochemical properties, such as a wide electrochemical potential window,15,16 low charge-transfer resistance and excellent electrochemical activity. Based on the physical and chemical properties of graphene and its huge potential, it has been widely used in many fields such as supercapacitors,17 transistors, sensors,18 conductive films,19 lithium ion batteries,20 catalysts,21 composites22,23 and solar cells24 in recent years. The scientific and commercial value of graphene is not limited to the original monolayer or single layer graphene, but also includes related two-dimensional materials that involve few-layer graphene (FLG) and multilayer graphene (MLG).25 The single-layer graphene is still the best suited for significant applications, but the synthesis process of monolayer graphene often involves some strong oxidizing reagents, and the cost of production remains expensive. Therefore, it is not conducive to the sustainable development of materials industry by saving both energy and the environment. So, the much lower cost MLG has attracted a huge amount of interest for electrochemical applications and, thus, MLG has become a promising material that may enhance the electrochemical performance of TMPs. Hence, our objective in this research was to improve the electrochemical performance of TMP by compositing it with MLG. Here, we designed and synthesized TMP/MLG composites by using layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a template for MLG.
Hydrotalcite-like compounds are a kind of anionic clay based on the layered structure of hydrotalcite, also known as LDH,26,27 whose ideal composition can be expressed as [M(II)1−xM(III)x(OH)2]x+(Ax/nn−)·mH2O,28 where M(II) is a divalent cation such as Mg, Fe, Ni, Co, etc., M(III) is a trivalent cation such as Co(III), Al, Fe(III), etc., and A is the anion, either inorganic or organic, which balances the positive charge of the layers through intercalation in the interlayers. Thus, LDH is composed of positively charged brucite-like layers similar to the structure of mineral brucite (Mg(OH)2),29 and negatively charged anions between layers to balance the positive charge. Due to the small interlayer space of LDH, the intercalated organic anions are confined and restricted between the layers by electrostatic attraction, which can effectively avoid a large amount of organic accumulation. After calcination at a certain temperature, we hypothesize that the organic anions between the layers can be decomposed, carbonized and graphitized to form MLG.
Our group's previous research studies have shown that heat preservation and structural/lattice orientation effects of the confinement space in LDHs can reduce the conventional temperature of graphitization.30,31 Herein, we further developed the above concept and designed a facile method to synthesize nickel–cobalt phosphide/multilayer graphene composites (NiCoP/MLG) by intercalating benzoate anions into NiCo-LDH, followed by a calcination process. During the calcination process, the benzoate anions confined in the 2D galleries of LDH were converted into amorphous carbon while the layered structure of NiCo-LDH collapsed and this subsequently led to the in situ formation of NiCoO2 with MLG. Then, the composite material was phosphorylated at an appropriate temperature to obtain the final NiCoP/MLG composite product. The as-obtained 3D petal-like structure of the NiCoP/MLG composite is shown here to have an excellent specific capacitance and this material was successfully assembled into a symmetrical supercapacitor.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the reagents and chemicals such as NiCl2·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, NH4Cl, NaOH, NaH2PO2, sodium benzoate, acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and used without further purification. Deionized water was used for all the experiments.
2.2. Preparation of nickel–cobalt phosphide/multilayer graphene (NiCoP/MLG)

2.2.1. Synthesis of precursor. 
The precursor LDH samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method at room temperature. Salts of NiCl2·6H2O and CoCl2·6H2O with a molar ratio of 4:6 were dissolved in 20 mL of distilled water at the same time and this solution was designated as solution A. Solution B was prepared with 4 mmol of NH4Cl, 1.375 mmol of NaOH and 0.5 g of sodium benzoate by dissolving in 20 mL of distilled water. Solution A was slowly dropped into solution B under vigorous stirring. Then, the mixture was continuously stirred for about 30 min to obtain a precipitate. The resulting precipitate was aged at 60 °C for 12 h. After the aging step, the precipitate obtained was separated by centrifugation, washed extensively with distilled water until pH = 7, and then the solid was dried at 80 °C for 6 h and stored in a desiccator. The obtained powder, called NiCo-B-LDH, was subjected to calcination. To serve as a control, another LDH was also prepared in the same way but in the absence of sodium benzoate and designated as ‘normal LDH’.


2.2.2. Synthesis of NiCoO2/MLG using NiCo-B-LDH. 
NiCo-B-LDH powder was loaded in a quartz boat and then the boat was placed in the middle of a horizontal furnace. The NiCoO2/MLG composites were prepared by calcining at 500 °C for 2 hours under the protection of nitrogen, and then cooling to room temperature naturally.


2.2.3. Synthesis of NiCoP/MLG using NiCoO2/MLG. 
The obtained brown NiCoO2/MGL composite and NaH2PO2 powder were loaded in different quartz boats. The NaH2PO2 powder was put in the front/upstream of the horizontal furnace, while NiCoO2/MLG was put at the opposite end. The samples were then heated to 350 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and maintained at this temperature for 2 h in a N2 atmosphere. Finally, the obtained black NiCoP/MLG powders were collected after the furnace was cooled down naturally. For comparison and to serve as a control, the normal NiCoP was prepared by a similar method as above.

2.3. Fabrication of the NiCoP/MLG electrode
The working electrodes were prepared as follows: according to the appropriate proportion, 80 wt% NiCoP/MLG composite was mixed with 10 wt% acetylene black and 10 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene binder evenly. To this mixture, ethanol and water were added and ground to homogenize and prepare a slurry. The above slurry was evenly coated on the nickel foam serving as an electrode and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. Then, the electrode was dried for 6 h at 70 °C in a vacuum oven. Finally, nickel foams coated with active materials were pressed at 10 MPa to obtain the working electrodes. The mass loading of NiCoP/MLG composite on the electrode was about 1.5 mg cm−2.
2.4. Material characterization
The morphology and the microstructure of NiCoP/Gr were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7500F). The crystalline phases were characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku, D/max 2500 PC instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Laser Micro-Raman Spectrometer (HORIBAYvon, LabRAM XploRA) at room temperature with Ar+ laser of 532 nm excitation. The surface chemistry of NiCoP/Gr was studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Escalab 250Xi spectrometer.
2.5. Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using a CHI660E (Shanghai Chenhua, China) electrochemical workstation. The tests were carried out in a three-electrode system with 3.0 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The Pt electrode and the standard calomel electrode were employed as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The CVs were tested at various scan rates from 5–50 mV s−1 in the range of 0–0.5 V. EIS measurements were carried out at a dc bias of 0.5 V with a sinusoidal signal of 5 mV over the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was performed at the current densities range of 1–10 A g−1 in the voltage range between 0 and 0.5 V. All the electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature.
The specific capacitance Cm (F g−1) of the single electrode in the three-electrode system and the symmetrical supercapacitor, the Coulombic efficiency (η) of NiCoP/MLG, the energy density E (W h kg−1) and power density P (W kg−1) of the symmetrical supercapacitor were calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge results as follows: Cm = IΔt/mΔV(1) E = CV2/2(2) P = E/Δt(3) (4)where I (A g−1) is the discharge current, Δt (s) and td are discharge time, tc is charge time, m (g) is the mass of the active material of a single electrode or symmetrical supercapacitor, ΔV (V) is the voltage drop and V (V) is the potential window.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Schematic of the synthesis process of NiCoP/MLG
The synthesis of NiCoP/MLG is mainly divided into three stages (Scheme 1). Firstly, NiCo-B-LDH was prepared by the coprecipitation method. Then, NiCo-B-LDH was calcined to form NiCoO2/MLG. Finally, NiCoO2/MLG was converted to NiCoP/MLG by a phosphorization process.

3.2. Characteristics of the samples
The XRD patterns of the pure NiCo-LDH, NiCo-B-LDH, NiCoO2/MGL composite, MLG, and NiCoP/MLG are shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic diffraction peaks of normal NiCo-LDH (Fig. 1a) serving as a control appear at 11.1°, 22.2°, 34.1°, 38.4°,45.5°, 59.4° and 60.9° two theta corresponding to the crystal planes of (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110) and (113), respectively, consistent with the standard XRD diffraction peaks for NiCo-LDH32 (JCPDS. 33-0429). Compared with the normal NiCo-LDH, the basal diffraction peaks (003) of NiCo-B-LDH (Fig. 1b) moved to lower angles from 11.1 Å to 5.5 Å. That is to say, the basal spacing increases from 8.0 Å to 16.0 Å (according to Bragg's Law), which indicates that benzoic anions were successfully intercalated into the interlayer space of LDH. After calcination (Fig. 1c), the characteristic diffraction peaks of NiCo-B-LDH disappeared, indicating the collapse of the layered structure and the formation of metal oxides. The new diffraction peaks at 36.7°, 42.6°, 62.0°, 74.0° and 77.9° can be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) crystal planes of NiCoO2 (JCPDS, No. 10-0188), respectively. In addition, the sample NiCoO2/MLG was subjected to etching by hydrochloric acid to verify whether all of the benzoate anions were converted into multilayer graphene during calcination. The XRD pattern of the residuum (MLG) (Fig. 1d) shows that the characteristic peaks of the metal oxides disappeared, indicating that the metal oxides were removed completely by the acid etching but a broad wide peak around 25° was observed, which can be attributed to the (002) plane of multilayer graphene.33 After phosphorization (Fig. 1e), it can be seen that the diffraction peaks of NiCoO2/MLG disappeared but new diffraction peaks appeared, which indicates the formation of a new phase. The new diffraction peaks at 17.5°, 26.6°, 30.5°, 36.0°, 41.0° and 48.2° can be indexed to the (100), (001), (110), (200), (111) and (210) planes of NiCoP (JCPDS. 71-2336).

Raman scattering measurement was carried out on the residuum (MLG) remaining after acid etching and its Raman spectrum is shown in Fig. 2, which shows D and G peaks located at 1335 cm−1 and 1392 cm−1, respectively. The D band is associated with defects resulting from the vibration of sp3 carbon atoms, while the G band is ascribed to vibration of all sp2 carbon atoms within a two-dimensional graphitic hexagonal lattice.34 Specifically, the relative intensity ratio of the D band and G band (ID/IG) is a key parameter for evaluating the degree of graphitization of a carbon material.35,36 According to the relevant literature, the ID/IG ratio follows a two-stage evolution:37 (1) corresponding to low-defect graphene, (2) corresponding to high-defect graphene. Normally, the transition of ID/IG between stage 1 and stage 2 is about 3.38 For our materials, the ID/IG ratio of MLG is 0.85, which suggests that the defect degree of MLG is small. Due to lattice orientation/confinement effects, the intercalation of benzoate anions into layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can improve the graphitization of benzoate anions at relatively low temperature.30

The microstructure and morphology of the composites were characterized by SEM and TEM. Fig. 3a to d reveal the SEM images of the normal NiCo-LDH, NiCo-B-LDH, NiCoO2/MLG and NiCoP/MLG. All the samples show a crumpled foil-like morphology in the form of petals of flowers stacked irregularly. The lamellae of NiCo-B-LDH (Fig. 3b) appear to be somewhat separated compared to the lamellae of the NiCo-LDH control (Fig. 3a). The calcined intercalated LDH (Fig. 3c) still has a three-dimensional petal-like structure similar to that of the corresponding precursor but may have high structural stability because of the supporting effect of the MLG skeleton.39 After phosphorization, the overall morphology of the sample (Fig. 3d) still remained as a three-dimensional porous petal-like structure but the lamellae became thicker and the lamellar surface appeared to be rougher due to the doping of P element and the removal of water vapor during phosphorization. These three-dimensional porous petal-like structures can provide a large number of active sites as well as electrolyte ion diffusion channels, which is beneficial to improve the electrochemical properties.

The detailed morphology of the NiCoP/MLG composite was further characterized by TEM. The nanopores and petal-like structures of NiCoO2/MLG can be observed in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that the TEM image of the NiCoP/MLG composite (Fig. 4b) is not as transparent as that of NiCoO2/MLG (Fig. 4a), which may be due to the uneven thickness of the lamellae, but the porous petal-like structure similar to NiCoO2/MLG can also be seen (Fig. 4b) in the composite. The morphology of the precursor oxides is still maintained after the phosphorization (Fig. 4c), indicating the high structural stability of NiCoO2/MLG. Fig. 4c shows NiCoP nanoparticles of different sizes, which are well dispersed on the surface of multilayer graphene. At the same time, the HRTEM image (Fig. 4d) shows obvious lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 0.26 nm and 0.22 nm corresponding to (210) and (111), indicating the high crystallinity of NiCoP nanoparticles. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 4e) indicates the polycrystalline structure of NiCoP in the NiCoP/MLG composites, which is consistent with the XRD characterization results. In order to determine the distribution of each element, the sample was subjected to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping. The EDX results (Fig. 4f) shows that Co, Ni, C and P are uniformly distributed in the NiCoP/MLG composites.

In order to further determine the chemical bonding state of each element in the NiCoP/MLG composite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used and the different spectra are shown in Fig. 5. The Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 5a) is composed of two spin-orbital doublets and two shake-up satellites. The two spin-orbital peaks correspond to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively. The fitted characteristic peaks of Ni3+ are located at 856.6 eV and 874.2 eV, while the characteristic peaks of Ni2+ are located at 853.5 eV and 871.1 eV, as previously suggested by others.40 The two shake-up satellites occur at 862.9 eV and 879.5 eV. Likewise, the two spin-orbital peaks and two shake-up satellites can be observed in the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 5b). The doublets at binding energies of 793.5 eV and 778.5 eV are assigned to Co2+, while those at 781.5 eV and 797.5 eV correspond to Co3+ as previously suggested.13 These results reveal that there are electron couples of Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ within the oxidation state of NiCoP/MGL. In the C1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 5c), there are two obvious peaks at 284.3 eV and 285.6 eV, corresponding to CC/C–C and C–OH, respectively. The main peak of CC/C–C indicates that carbonization of benzoic acid formed a carbon–carbon bond during the calcination process. However, there is no CO peak, indicating that after calcination at 500 °C, benzoate did not oxidize and had a high degree of carbonization leading to multilayer graphene. The P2p spectrum (Fig. 5d) consists of two spin-orbital peaks. The peak around 129.5 eV can be attributed to the metal–P bond. The peak at 134.4 eV in the higher region is associated with phosphorous oxides formed by surface oxidation when exposed to air. This indicates that the surface composition of the material changes after phosphorization.

3.3. Electrochemical performance
The electrochemical properties of different samples in a three-electrode system were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cyclic stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Fig. 6a shows the cyclic voltammograms of NiCoP and NiCoP/MLG at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Compared with carbon materials used in electrical double layered capacitors,30 both NiCoP and NiCoP/MLG samples show a set of strong redox peaks (Fig. 6a), proving the pseudocapacitance of NiCoP, which is mainly attributed to the faradaic redox reaction with NiCoP. The mechanism of NiCoP involved in the reversible redox reaction using alkaline electrolyte solution can be summarized in the following equations:41NiCoP + 2OH− ↔ NiP1−xOH + CoPxOH +2e−CoPxOH + OH− ↔ CoPxO + H2O + e−
 Fig. 6  CV curves of NiCoP/MLG and NiCoP at a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1 (a) and GCD curves at a current density of 1 A g−1 (b). 
It is well known that the value of the specific capacitance is proportional to the area enclosed by the CV curves. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that the integral area of NiCoP/MLG is larger than that of pure NiCoP, which demonstrates that the composite material has a higher electrochemical activity and specific capacitance, indicating that the synergistic effect of graphene and NiCoP can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of the materials. In addition, NiCoP nanoparticles without graphene are easily agglomerated leading to a reduced specific surface area and so they could not fully participate in the redox reaction.
In order to further study the electrochemical properties of the different electrode materials, GCD measurements were carried out under the current density of 1 A g−1 within the voltage range of 0–0.5 V (Fig. 6b). Each charge–discharge curve is nonlinear and has a platform transition region with an obvious slow change, which further confirms the pseudo capacitance behavior of NiCoP. The transition zone of the platform can be attributed to the charge accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the reversible redox reaction between the electrode surface and the interior. The discharge time of NiCoP/MLG is significantly longer than that of NiCoP at the same current density, indicating that NiCoP/MLG has larger specific capacitance values. By calculation, the specific capacitance values of NiCoP and NiCoP/MLG are 1105.4 F g−1 and 1419.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. These results are similar to the CV results discussed above. This is due to the synergistic effect of graphene and NiCoP. The existence of graphene can not only effectively prevent the agglomeration of NiCoP nanoparticles but also improve the electrical conductivity of the composites.
Cyclic voltammograms of NiCoP/MLG at different scan rates over a potential window of 0 V to 0.5 V are presented in Fig. 7a. A pair of redox peaks can be clearly observed in all CV curves at different scanning rates, which shows the pseudo capacitance of NiCoP. At a low scanning rate, the redox peaks are located near 0.22 V and 0.41 V. With increased scanning rate, the redox peaks were slightly shifted, but the shapes of the closed curves did not change much, indicating that the internal resistance and polarizability of the NiCoP/MLG composite electrode material are small and it has better rate performance at a higher scanning rate.

In order to further evaluate the electrochemical properties of NiCoP/MLG, GCD measurements (Fig. 7b) were carried out at different current densities of 1.0 to 10 A g−1 in the range of 0–0.5 V potential. Each charge–discharge curve is nearly symmetrical, indicating that NiCoP/MLG has a good charge–discharge performance, and each charge–discharge curve is non-linear and has a platform transition zone with an obvious slow change, which is the pseudocapacitance behavior caused by the redox reaction of NiCoP during the charge–discharge process. Also, the redox potential of the nonlinear platform in the charge–discharge curve is parallel to the redox potential in the CV curve. The discharge time decreased with the increase of current density, because the active material cannot be fully utilized due to the limitation of electrolyte ion diffusion at high current density. When the current density increased from 1 to 10 A g−1, the specific capacitances are 1419.6 F g−1, 1343.7 F g−1, 1281.6 F g−1, 1183.2 F g−1, 1047.0 F g−1, 935.2 F g−1 and 834 F g−1, respectively. These results are comparable to the values of some transition metal phosphides previously suggested by others, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). A high specific capacitance was maintained at high current density, which indicates that NiCoP/MLG composites have good rate properties.
The rate capabilities of NiCoP/MLG and NiCoP were studied as a function of current density and specific capacitance. As shown in Fig. 7c, when the current density increases, the specific capacitance of the sample tends to decrease. This may be because electrolyte could not fully permeate and diffuse at high current density, so the redox reaction could not reach completion. The specific capacitance values of NiCoP/MLG and NiCoP at 10 A g−1 are 834 F g−1 and 752 F g−1, respectively. Thus, NiCoP/MLG has a better rate capability and higher specific capacitance, which is due to the constant embedding and release of electrolyte ions in the electrode materials during the electrochemical reaction, and the 3D porous petal-like structure of the sample could also accelerate the diffusion of electrolyte ions.
In order to further understand the electrochemical properties, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the sample were recorded in the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz. All Nyquist curves (Fig. 7d) exhibited two typical characteristics: a semicircle in the high and medium frequency range and an oblique line in the low frequency range. The semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance between the active material and the liquid electrolyte, which is related to the redox reaction while the semicircular radius is proportional to the charge transfer resistance. In addition, the intercept between the semicircle and the X-axis represents the internal resistance, including the contact resistance between the active material and the collector and the resistance of the active material itself. The equivalent series resistance value of NiCoP/MLG is about 0.56 Ω, which is smaller than that of pure NiCoP (0.64 Ω). The above result indicated that multilayer graphene promoted charge transport and improved the conductivity of the NiCoP/MLG composite, which provided an easier charge transfer process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Cyclic stability is an important parameter of electrode materials, and it is one of the factors that determine whether electrode materials can be applied in practice. Fig. 7e reveals the results of 3000 GCD tests for NiCoP/MLG and NiCoP samples at the current density of 5 A g−1. It can be observed that NiCoP/MLG has a good cycling stability in which the retention rate of capacitance after 3000 cycles is 91.7%, while the normal NiCoP shows very poor decay to 74.6% after 3000 cycles. In addition, the Coulombic efficiency (Fig. S1, ESI†) of NiCoP/MLG is approximately 100% during all cycles. The above stability can be attributed to its special petal porous structure and the synergistic effect between NiCoP and graphene, in which graphene not only increases the conductivity of the composite material, but also hinders the aggregation of NiCoP particles, and maintains the overall stability of the structure during charging and discharging by acting as a buffer layer.
To further evaluate the practical properties of the NiCoP/MLG composite material, a symmetrical supercapacitor was fabricated using NiCoP/MLG as an active electrode material. Fig. 8a shows the CV curves of symmetric supercapacitors at different working potential windows ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 V at a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1. It can be seen from the figure that the CV curve has an obvious redox peak, indicating that the energy storage mechanism is mainly a reversible redox reaction. With the increase of voltage window, the curve shape remains the same, indicating the good capacitive performance of the capacitor. Fig. 8b demonstrates the GCD plots for the fabricated supercapacitor at different current densities ranging from 1.0 A g−1 to 5.0 A g−1. When the current density was 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the device could reach 103 F g−1, which can be competitive with those of NiCoP-based systems reported in recent years (Table S2, ESI†). The variation of the specific capacitance at different current densities is presented in Fig. 8c. As can be seen from Fig. 8c, with increasing current density, the specific capacitance of the device decreased, which is due to the insufficient penetration and diffusion of electrolyte at high current density, as has been suggested previously by others.42 It is well-known that the energy density and power density are two key factors to measure the overall performance of supercapacitors and their relationship is shown in Fig. 8d. When the power density of the supercapacitor was 741.65 W kg−1, the energy density reached the maximum value of 32.19 W h kg−1, showing a good energy storage capacity of the present supercapacitor (Fig. 8d). It can be seen from Fig. 8d that the energy density decreased with increasing power density, which could be due to blocking of the movement of electrolyte ions by diffusion at high current densities leading to incomplete reaction of the active material of the electrode. The cycle stability of the device was further evaluated by continuous GCD tests at 3 A g−1 in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The capacity maintains about 67% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile and eco-friendly method for the preparation of a 3D NiCoP/MLG composite under mild conditions. The composite of nickel–cobalt phosphide and multilayer graphene (NiCoP/MLG) was obtained by confinement of benzoate anions in the 2D galleries of NiCo-LDH, followed by a calcination process first at 500 °C and subsequent phosphorization at 350 °C. The benzoate intercalated LDH retained its porous petal-like structure after it was transformed to NiCoP/MLG by calcination and phosphorization, which was found to be beneficial for the transmission of electrolyte ions. The NiCoP/MLG composite as an active electrode material exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1419.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and it also showed good rate capability and cycling stability. In addition, NiCoP/MLG was successfully assembled into a symmetrical supercapacitor with a high energy density of 32.19 W h kg−1 at a power density of 741.65 W kg−1. The currently developed strategy of structural confinement of organic anions to prepare MLG using LDH as a template was found to be effective to prepare inorganic NiCoP/MLG composites and such a strategy is expected to be broadly useful in the field of energy storage.
