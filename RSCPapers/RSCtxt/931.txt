    , Accepted 3rd April 2017First published on 3rd April 2017AbstractNon-fullerene polymer solar cells have attracted extensive attention due to their potential for overcoming the performance bottleneck currently encountered in fullerene-based photovoltaics. Herein, we report non-fullerene polymer solar cells with a maximal power conversion efficiency of over 11% by introducing an n-type water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymer as a cathode interlayer. We found that the contact between the n-type interlayer and the donor provides an extra interface for charge dissociation and the matching of energy levels between the n-type interlayer and the acceptor allows efficient electron extraction from the bulk heterojunction, which eventually leads to much improved performance. This study proposes a significant design rule for designing new interfaces for high performance non-fullerene photovoltaics.

Broader context
We report a new and universal strategy for the interface engineering of non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) by using an n-type water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymer (PFN-2TNDI) as a cathode interlayer, which results in state-of-the-art non-fullerene PSCs with a maximal power conversion efficiency of over 11%. The greatly enhanced performance of the resulting devices was systemically investigated and it was found that PFN-2TNDI works as both the charge collection interlayer and the light harvesting layer, which can enhance electron collection and contribute to photocurrent production in the resulting devices. Our results therefore not only provide a universal approach for the interface engineering of non-fullerene PSCs, but may also open up new design directions for ternary device architectures with a third component in the interface. This opens a new avenue for the future design of multifunctional interlayers for further enhancement of high performance PSCs. In addition to performance enhancement, we also found that a thick interlayer can be used without sacrificing device efficiency, which is more compatible for roll-to-roll printing processes and may pave the way for potential commercialization of organic photovoltaics technology.

Introduction
Polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells (PSCs), which use a phase-separated blend of donor and acceptor as the active layer, have emerged as an attractive technology for renewable energy generation, with the potential advantages of low-cost manufacturing on lightweight flexible substrates by solution fabrication methods.1–3 Fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), have been successfully applied as electron acceptors in PSCs, and over the last decade, considerable progress has been made in fullerene-based PSCs, for which the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been improved from around 1% to more than 11% for single junction devices and tandem devices.4–8 Fullerene is indeed a very important class of acceptor for PSCs and is still being used extensively in organic photovoltaic (OPV) research and even commercial module production. However it is very challenging to further improve the performance of fullerene-based PSCs due to the difficulty in tuning the unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of fullerene while maintaining good charge transport properties. This leads to a relatively large energy loss caused by the existence of a significant offset between the bandgap of the absorber and the energy of the charge transfer (CT) state, together with the non-radiative recombination loss during the photocurrent generation process, which limits the open-circuit voltage (Voc). It is also known that fullerenes have a low absorption coefficient, which limits the short-circuit current density (Jsc). As a result, these two issues have limited the overall performance of fullerene-based PSCs.9,10 Moreover, it is hard to use fullerene derivatives in low-cost and large-area processed PSCs due to their high cost and weak endurance against morphological stresses.11–13 Therefore, over the past few years increasing effort has been focused on the design and synthesis of new motifs for non-fullerene electron acceptors that may overcome these shortcomings.14–16 Recently breakthroughs in molecular design of non-fullerene acceptors with improved absorption and low energy loss during the charge generation process enabled PSC devices reaching record high efficiency.17,18 These achievements suggested that non-fullerene acceptors have great potential for further advancing OPV technology.
In addition to the development of new active layer materials, interface engineering has played an important role in the rapidly improved performance of fullerene-based PSCs.19,20 Among different types of interface materials, water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their many unique advantages. WSCPs can create desired interfacial dipoles to tune the work function of electrodes, which allows the use of less reactive metals as the electron collecting cathode and therefore improves the stability of the PSCs. WSCP-induced interfacial n-doping of fullerene was also identified as an important phenomenon that minimizes the contact resistance at the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)/cathode interface.21–23 Moreover, the orthogonal solvent processability of WSCPs from environmentally friendly solvents (such as alcohol) can avoid the interfacial erosion problem during multilayer device fabrication, making them good candidates for future large-area roll-to-roll industrial applications. As a result, WSCPs have been successfully applied as efficient interface materials for state-of-the-art fullerene-based solar cells,24,25 and even extended to most types of optoelectronic devices, including all-printed polymer light-emitting displays,26 tandem PSCs,6,7 and high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.27,28 However, it is unclear whether the success of WSCPs for interface engineering of fullerene-based PSCs can be translated to non-fullerene PSCs as the optimized interfacial contact formed in the former case may not necessarily be applicable for devices based on new acceptors. In addition, the design criteria of WSCP-based interlayers in non-fullerene BHJ systems were rarely discussed, and the study of the WSCP’s roles in non-fullerene BHJ devices and its contributions to device properties are yet to be addressed in any report so far. Therefore, it is important to develop a new WSCP charge transport layer with desirable chemical, electronic and electrical properties to enhance the performance of non-fullerene PSCs. A systematic study on the nature of the contact formed between the WSCP and the light harvesting layer comprising non-fullerene acceptors is also important to provide new design guidelines for WSCP interface materials.
In this article, we demonstrate, for the first time, by using a solution processed naphthalene diimide (NDI) based WSCP poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracaboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] (PFN-2TNDI) as the interlayer, that efficient non-fullerene PSCs with PCEs larger than 11% can be realised. This is one of the top values that has been reported for single-junction PSCs of both fullerene and non-fullerene devices to date.4,29 More importantly, unlike traditional fullerene derivative based PSCs, in which enhanced PCEs are mainly due to the doping interaction between the WSCP interlayer and the fullerene-based acceptor, we found that due to the CT between the BHJ donor and WSCP interlayer, this interlayer played a dual role in the devices, which could promote better electron extraction and reduce the charge recombination losses as an interlayer, and also contribute to photocurrent production as a light harvesting layer. In addition, the matching of energy levels between the WSCP and the BHJ acceptor allows efficient electron extraction from the BHJ, which eventually leads to much improved performance in non-fullerene PSCs. Our results therefore not only provide a universal approach for the interface engineering of non-fullerene PSCs, but may also open up new design directions for ternary device architectures with a third component in the interface, and the development of high performance PSCs.
Results and discussion
All-polymer non-fullerene PSCs with WSCP interlayers
The molecular structures of the donors, acceptors and interface materials used in this study are presented in Fig. 1a. Both a wide band gap WSCP poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) and a narrow band gap WSCP PFN-2TNDI were chosen as the interlayer materials for non-fullerene PSCs. PFN was chosen because it is one of the most commonly-used WSCPs in fullerene-based PSCs,19,24 while PFN-2TNDI is a self-doped WSCP with enhanced electron transporting capability.31 Both PFN and PFN-2TNDI were used as the interlayer in the devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:N2200/interlayer/Al. A blend of commercially available low bandgap semiconducting donor poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]-dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) and acceptor poly[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4:5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene) (N2200), which has proven to be a promising candidate as the active layer material for all-polymer PSCs,16 was used as the active layer. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the resulting devices with a thin interlayer of ∼5 nm are shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† Devices with bare Al as a cathode exhibited poor device performance with a PCE of 4.3%. When a thin PFN layer was inserted between the Al cathode and the active layer, the resulting device delivered an enhanced PCE of 5.4%, which is comparable to the best reported PTB7-Th:N2200 based all-polymer PSCs.16 This improved performance is due to the work function modification capability of PFN, which can form a better energy-level alignment at the electrode interface and hence enhance electron collection.19,20 By replacing the PFN with PFN-2TNDI, the resulting devices exhibited further improved performance with a maximal PCE of 6.3%. Although both devices showed comparable Voc at 0.76–0.79 V, the average Jsc and fill factor (FF) increased from 13.18 mA cm−2 and 0.51 for PFN, to 13.69 mA cm−2 and 0.58 for PFN-2TNDI, respectively. Moreover, despite Ca/Al being the most common cathode configuration in conventional non-fullerene PSCs, devices with a Ca interlayer had significantly lower PCE values relative to PFN-2TNDI devices. Since such an obvious difference between the efficiency of devices with PFN and PFN-2TNDI WSCP was not observed in PCBM-based solar cells,31 it will be interesting to further explore the origin of the enhanced Jsc and FF of the PFN-2TNDI based non-fullerene PSCs and study the interfacial properties formed between the fullerene and non-fullerene-based BHJ layer and WSCPs.

Interaction between WSCPs and acceptors
As the doping interaction between WSCPs and PCBM acceptors has been proven to be very important for dramatically improving the performance of WSCP-containing PSCs,21–23 we conducted an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy study to investigate the effects of doping WSCPs with PC71BM and N2200 (Fig. 2a). Indeed, in PC71BM-containing blends, intense ESR signals for both PC71BM:PFN and PC71BM:PFN-2TNDI could be detected with a g value of 1.999, indicating that interfacial doping occurred between the fullerene in the BHJ and WSCP, therefore making a conductive contact with small resistance loss and good electron extraction properties. However, only weak ESR signals could be observed with a g value of 1.998 in N2200 blends, suggesting a significantly decreased electron transfer process between WSCPs and N2200. It is not clear whether such a weak doping effect could have an effect on the electron extraction properties of the device, and thus we fabricated bottom-contact top-gate organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices with PFN-2TNDI or PFN as the interface layer (Fig. 2b) to further investigate the influence of n-doping on the charge-transport properties in the final devices. As shown in Fig. 2c, for pure PCBM-based OFETs, a high Ion/off ratio over 105 was obtained, showing a typical semiconductor property. However, when PCBM was covered by a 5 nm PFN, the off current at ∼0 V bias increased from below 10−12 to 10−8 A while the Ion/off ratio decreased to ∼102 when compared to the pure PCBM device. As for the PFN-2TNDI coated PCBM, a nearly constant IDS of ∼8 × 10−8 A independent of the gate bias was observed. These changes in the transfer curve are a good indication that the PCBM was being doped, and both the PFN-2TNDI and PFN interlayer appeared to have a pronounced effect in enhancing the electron injection/extraction properties of the semiconductor layer. Compared with the strong interfacial doping effect observed in the WSCP-coated PCBM films, OFETs based on the PFN- and PFN-2TNDI coated N2200 films did not show an obvious decrease in the Ion/off ratio but only the magnitude of the IDS (Fig. 2d), suggesting that an insignificant n-doping effect occurred at WSCP/N2200 interfaces, which is in good agreement with the ESR results as shown in Fig. 2a.

(b–d) Structure of the OFET devices (b) used in this study, and transfer plots of PC71BM-based (c) and N2200-based (d) OFETs. 
In order to better analyze the charge transport characteristics of the OFETs, the intrinsic charge transport properties of the pure PFN and PFN-2TNDI films were measured with the pure interlayer based OFETs (Fig. S2, ESI†). A significantly reduced current compared to the bilayer device was observed in the single interlayer curve, suggesting the interface layer could not be the major charge transport channel for the bilayer OFETs in terms of charge transport properties. Consequently, combined with the ESR study results, it was clearly shown that the altered performance of PTB7-Th:N2200 based PSCs by using the WSCP interlayer was not caused by the interactions between WSCPs and acceptors, and thus the WSCPs may show different working mechanisms in fullerene and non-fullerene PSCs.
Interaction between WSCPs and donors
At the BHJ/WSCP interface, the WSCP makes contact with both the acceptor and donor domains, and accordingly different WSCPs may have different interactions with donor materials. The solid-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of PTB7-Th exhibited an emission peak at 748 nm (Fig. S3a, ESI†). After adding PFN-2TNDI, the PL emission of PTB7-Th was quenched considerably, but there was almost no drop in the PL peak for the PTB7-Th/PFN bilayer. These results reveal that PFN-2TNDI is an efficient PL quencher for donor material PTB7-Th, and that ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer from the donor to PFN-2TNDI may exist at the donor/PFN-2TNDI interface. In addition, PFN-2TNDI had a lower LUMO level compared to PTB7-Th (Fig. 1b), which provides a prerequisite for PFN-2TNDI to be used as an electron acceptor. To further elucidate the influence of WSCPs on the exciton dissociation efficiency, bilayer heterojunction devices of PTB7-Th coated with PFN-2TNDI and PFN were fabricated (summarised in Table S3, ESI†). In this device structure, the only charge transfer site was the p-type PTB7-Th/n-type WSCP interface. When the thickness increased to 30 nm, the PFN-2TNDI device showed an improved Jsc and observable photovoltaic effect, but the PTB7-Th/PFN bilayer cell still showed insulating behaviour, suggesting that the PFN-2TNDI polymer was a qualified n-type electron acceptor under illumination due to photoinduced electron transfer from the donor to the NDI unit. Indeed, similar results were also found in the dark J–V curve of the bilayer PSCs (Fig. S3c, ESI†), which clearly showed the best diode behaviour and the highest ratio between the forward and reverse current in the thick PFN-2TNDI bilayer device.
Charge modulated electroabsorption spectroscopy (CMEAS) was performed to provide further insight into the charge transfer properties at the different donor/WSCP interfaces (Fig. 3a). A simple bilayer structure without PEDOT:PSS was fabricated to avoid any additional charge transfer-induced signals at other interfaces. The full spectrum electroabsorption (EA) of the four devices showed the typical excitonic features above 1.5 eV in correspondence to the vibronic energies in PTB7-Th, which were attributed to the Stark effect due to coupling between the excitonic level and the higher forbidden states under the applied electric field. While in the sub-bandgap region, no EA signal was detected for pristine donor PTB7-Th and donor/PFN bilayer devices. However, for the PTB7-Th:N2200 blend device, a strong EA signal was observed with an excitation energy above 1.35 eV. This is ascribed to the charge transfer with direct sub-bandgap excitation at the PTB7-Th/N2200 interface.33 As for the donor/PFN-2TNDI device, a notable EA signal was also detected at the 1.2–1.3 eV region, revealing a considerable charge transfer in this bilayer interface. These results further confirmed the electron withdrawing ability of PFN-2TNDI as an n-type electron acceptor. The evidence of charge transfer at the PTB7-Th/PFN-2TNDI interface supports efficient charge separation and reduced backward recombination at the BHJ/WSCP interface. However, PFN neither formed a desired contact with the donor in the BHJ to provide an extra interface for exciton dissociation, nor had an efficient n-doping effect with the non-fullerene acceptor in the BHJ to reduce the interfacial contact resistance. It just provided a better energy-level alignment at the electrode interface through reducing the work function of the metal cathode (Table S4, ESI†), and hence PFN is less effective in improving the performance of non-fullerene based PSCs.

(b) EQE spectra of PTB7-Th:N2200 BHJ solar cells with PFN and PFN-2TNDI as WSCPs. (c) The ΔEQE spectra of devices with PFN-2TNDI and PFN interlayers (orange circle line), and absorption spectra of the PFN-2TNDI film (black line). 
As identified CT states occurred from the donor to PFN-2TNDI, the origin of Jsc enhancement could be further confirmed via optical characterisation of the PSC’s distinguished interlayer and active layer absorption. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed on the PTB7-Th:N2200 devices containing a 5 nm PFN-2TNDI or PFN interlayer. A larger photocurrent collection could be observed in both the 350–400 nm and 550–650 nm sections in the devices containing PFN-2TNDI interlayers relative to devices with PFN, which is exactly covered by the absorption band of PFN-2TNDI. Thus, a ΔEQE spectrum was obtained by subtracting the EQE curves of the PFN-2TNDI and PFN cells, and as shown in Fig. 3c, the absorption from the PFN-2TNDI interlayer (black line) can mostly account for the ΔEQE spectrum (circle line), corresponding to larger Jsc, suggesting that the PFN-2TNDI functions as a light harvesting layer that has a confirmed contribution to the photocurrent of the device. Consequently, there exists a miniature bilayer solar cell at the BHJ/WSCP interface when PFN-2TNDI is applied before metal deposition (Fig. 4). The formation of a heterojunction with more desired interfacial properties for charge extraction together with the ability to tune the work function of the electrodes, leads to extra photocurrent generation and improved electron extraction properties at the interface. This new ternary device structure of BHJ donor/BHJ acceptor/interlayer acceptor has more universality than the ternary blend solar cell, due to the setting of the third component in the interlayer, which is more feasible for tuning the morphology of the ternary device and developing high-performance ternary PSCs.
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the exciton separation and transport in BHJ, and the charge transfer states at the donor/WSCP interface. 
To provide better analysis of the charge extraction properties in the devices, we performed transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements for both the PTB7-Th:PCBM and PTB7-Th:N2200 PSCs with PFN or PFN-2TNDI as the WSCP, which are shown in the Fig. S4, ESI.† The TPC study provides useful information on the competition between carrier sweep-out by the internal field and recombination during the operation of solar cells. In the PTB7-Th:PCBM cases, the electron extraction time of the devices with PFN or PFN-2TNDI are very similar, which are 0.23 μs and 0.22 μs, respectively. This indicated that the n-doping effect at the PCBM/WSCP interface dominated the charge extraction properties and the extra charge separation interface between PTB7-Th/PFN-2TNDI only contributed a minor effect in this situation. However, in the PTB7-Th/N2200 cases, an obvious difference between the charge extraction time of the devices with PFN and PFN-2TNDI WSCP was observed. A larger charge extraction time of 0.30 μs was measured in the PFN case while that of the PFN-2TNDI based device is 0.24 μs. Since only a very weak interfacial n-doping effect was found in both cases that lead to an overall reduced increase in charge extraction time when compared to the PCBM-based devices. The smaller charge extraction time in the PFN-2TNDI could be attributed to the efficient charge separation between the PTB7-Th/PFN-2TNDI interface. In addition, the self-doping effect of the PFN-2TNDI with improved conductivity may also contribute to the reduced charge extraction time. These results indicate that an n-doping interaction between WSCPs and acceptors and a photo-induced charge separation process between the donor and PFN-2TNDI existed simultaneously at the BHJ/PFN-2TNDI interface. Both these effects improve electron extraction in the device, but they have different contributions on the improvement of device performance depending on the type of BHJ.
Compatibility of various BHJ systems
The n-type electron acceptor properties of PFN-2TNDI make it a good candidate as a WSCP interlayer that can work efficiently in an all-polymer BHJ system; here we chose some high-efficiency small molecular non-fullerene BHJs to verify its compatibility with various acceptors and donors. Devices with the small molecular acceptor IDT-2BR, which has a promising PCE value when blended with a polymer donor,14 were evaluated first. We adopted the donor polymer PTB7-Th, as also used in the previous all-polymer BHJ. The solar cell parameters are shown in Table S5, ESI.† Neither of the two WSCPs could n-dope IDT-2BR (Fig. S5a, ESI†), and the n-type advantage of PFN-2TNDI could be maximised in this situation. Devices composed of PFN-2TNDI outperformed the PFN cells, exhibiting a maximal PCE of 8.1% with PFN-2TNDI. We then more intensively investigated another BHJ system, PBDB-T:ITIC, which comprised a different low bandgap polymer donor, but still used a homogenous small molecular non-fullerene acceptor. As shown in Fig. 5a and Table 1, the device parameters Voc, Jsc and FF of the most efficient devices were 0.93 V, 16.80 mA cm−2 and 0.71, respectively, yielding a prominent PCE of 11.1% with optimised PFN-2TNDI WSCP, which is one of the top PCE values for single-junction PSCs. In addition, 20 individual devices were fabricated under optimised conditions to demonstrate the reproducibility of these results, and the histogram of the test results is shown in Fig. 5b. Indeed, our results show very good reproducibility with an average PCE of 10.8%. The device was sent to the National Institute of Metrology, China, for certification and a certified PCE of 10.6% was obtained, which is in the confidence interval reported in Table 1 as 10.8 ± 0.3%. The charge separation between the donor/PFN-2TNDI interface results in this enhanced performance with PFN-2TNDI as the WSCP interlayer, thus making PFN-2TNDI a promising WSCP with a wide compatibility with various non-fullerene BHJ systems.

Thickness sensitivity analysis
Thick WSCP interlayers play a significant role in large-area printed manufacturing, and thus the processing potential of these WSCPs was further evaluated for non-fullerene device applications. The photovoltaic characteristics of devices based on PTB7-Th:N2200 BHJ with a range of WSCP thicknesses from 5 to 30 nm are summarised in Table S6, ESI.† The performance of devices with PFN was extremely sensitive to WSCP thickness. The PCE dropped dramatically when PFN thickness increased slightly from the optimised thickness of ∼5 nm, leading to an insulating device with no photovoltaic response. For PFN-2TNDI cells, performance was still maintained at over 5% even with a relatively thick film of 30 nm, due to the good charge mobility/conductivity of the PFN-2TNDI polymer.31 In addition to their electronic properties, energy level matching is another critical factor that determines the differential thickness dependence. As can be seen from Fig. 5d, when the WSCP is ultrathin (<5 nm), electrons may tunnel through the WSCP and be collected by the cathode, and thus PFN-2TNDI and PFN can both work efficiently as interlayers. Considering that the LUMO level of PFN is higher than N2200, it should indeed form an electron barrier that blocks electrons from reaching the cathode, thus the photocurrent drops significantly if the thickness of the PFN layer increases. However, in the case of PFN-2TNDI, since its LUMO is comparable to that of N2200, charge can be injected into the WSCP and subsequently transport within the WSCP film, so there is no electron barrier formed between the N2200/WSCP interface. Therefore, a large thickness window of PFN-2TNDI can be applied to achieve high performance devices without affecting the electron extraction properties at the cathode interface (Fig. 5e and f).
ITIC has a closer LUMO level to N2200, and presumably it exhibits a similar charge transport process when thick WSCPs are deposited on it. A prominent PCE of 9.8% (Voc = 0.92 V, Jsc = 15.44 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69) with a PFN-2TNDI thickness of >30 nm was achieved. However, for the IDT-2BR system, when PFN-2TNDI thickness increased slightly beyond 10 nm, the Voc dropped sharply from 1.04 to 0.89 V, whereas the trends of Jsc and FF were identical to the expected trends (Table S8, ESI†). Generally, the LUMO of the acceptor in the BHJ should be close to the WSCP to ensure efficient electron transport across their interface. In such case, a maximized Voc that is determined by the difference between the HOMOD–LUMOA can be achieved.34–36 However, when the LUMO level of the PFN-2TNDI is much lower than the LUMO of the acceptor in the BHJ, the Voc value will be determined by the difference between HOMOD–LUMOPFN-2TNDI as electron transport from the acceptor to the PFN-2TNDI will lose energy due to the lower LUMO of the PFN-2TNDI film. This will result in a reduction of Voc and the effect becomes more pronounced when a thick PFN-2TNDI film is used (Fig. 5g). In addition, the interposition of the interface bilayer device may also influence the Voc trend. More in-depth investigations into the electronic properties of this new ternary device are ongoing.
Conclusions
In summary, we have described the difference of the interfacial contact formed between a fullerene-based BHJ and a non-fullerene based BHJ and the function of the interlayer in those devices. At the acceptor/WSCP interface, when the acceptor in the BHJ is PCBM, interfacial doping at the PCBM/WSCP interface was observed no matter whether PFN or PFN-2TNDI was used as the interlayer. The interfacial doping will lead to reduced contact resistance of the PSC devices. When the acceptor in the BHJ is a non-fullerene acceptor, a very weak or even negligible n-doping effect at the WSCP/acceptor interface was observed, therefore, the contact resistance at the BHJ/WSCP interface is expected to be higher than that in the case of PCBM-based OPV devices. In the case of PFN-2TNDI, since it is a self-doped WSCP, the contact resistance formed between the BHJ and the WSCP is expected to be smaller than that in the case of PFN. At the donor/WSCP interface, the donor in the BHJ will form a heterojunction with a straddling gap with the large bandgap PFN and a staggered gap with the low bandgap PFN-2TNDI. The latter one is favorable for exciton dissociation due to the appropriate offset of energy levels between the donor and the WSCP, which resulted in extra photocurrent generation and improved electron extraction properties at the interface. In the former case, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the donor are within the bandgap of PFN, which acts as a blocking layer for both holes and electrons. Consequently, a universal WSCP interface approach that can be used in non-fullerene solar cells to improve device performance has been presented, and we have verified its compatibility with polymer–polymer and polymer–small molecule based BHJ layers. A prominent PCE value of 11.1% with an optimised PFN-2TNDI interlayer was achieved in non-fullerene PSCs. The introduction of a miniature bilayer device at the BHJ/WSCP interface provides a universal approach for the WSCP interface engineering of non-fullerene PSCs, and introduces a new ternary device structure, in which the third component is set in the interlayer. This paves the way for the future of multifunctional interlayers for further enhancement of high performance PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
PBDB-T and IDT-2BR were synthesized according to the reported procedure.14,37 ITIC was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. PTB7-Th and N2200 were purchased from 1-Material Inc. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and solvents were commonly commercially available products and were used as received.
PSC device fabrication
The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were cleaned sequentially under sonication with acetone, detergent, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in a baking oven overnight, followed by a plasma treatment. A PEDOT:PSS layer (∼40 nm) was spun on an ITO substrate and dried at 140 °C for 20 min in air. PTB7-Th:N2200 (1:1 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene solution, PTB7-Th:IDT-2BR (1:1.5 weight ratio) in dichlorobenzene solution, and PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene:DIO (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) solution were spin-coated to obtain a film thickness of approximately 100 nm, respectively. Preparation of the blend solutions and subsequent spin coating and annealing onto the PEDOT:PSS film were carried out in a N2-filled glove box. The PFN or PFN-2TNDI dissolved in methanol (with 0.1% acetic acid) at a concentration of 0.5–5 mg mL−1 was spun onto the active layers at 2000 rpm for 30 s for different thickness devices. An aluminum electrode (90 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation finally through a shadow mask under a base pressure of 1 × 10−7 mbar, which defines the active cell area of 0.05 cm2. To improve the accuracy of measurement, a non-refractive mask with an aperture of 0.04 cm2 was put in close contact and aligned with the solar cells, which defines the illumination area to be 0.04 cm2.
Device characterization
The device photocurrent was measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Taiwan, Enlitech). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the devices were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter, and no applied bias or light soaking process was applied before J–V measurement. The illumination intensity of the light source was calibrated before the testing using a standard silicon solar cell with a KG5 filter, calibrated using a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) calibrated silicon photodiode, giving a value of 100 mW cm−2 in the test. All the J–V curves reported in this manuscript were tested by sweeping the J–V measurement from the forward direction (from short-circuit to open-circuit) with a scan rate of 2 V s−1. PL spectra and ESR spectra were recorded on a FLS920 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments) and a JEOL JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer (300 K, 9.063 GHz, X-band), respectively. The microwave power used was 1 mW, and the magnetic field sweep width ranged from 3195 to 3295 G. The modulation frequency was 100 kHz, and the modulation amplitude was 3.5 G. The thickness was obtained from surface profiler measurements, in combination with extrapolation from an absorbance thickness curve that assumed a linear dependence of absorbance for PFN or PFN-2TNDI on the film thickness.
OFET device fabrication
Bottom-contact top-gate OFET devices were fabricated on glass substrates. 20 nm gold source/drain electrodes were thermally deposited through shadow masks. The semiconductor layer was deposited onto the source/drain electrodes by spin coating PC71BM or N2200 solution (10 mg mL−1 in chloroform) at 1000 rpm. The PFN or PFN-2TNDI interlayer was deposited onto the semiconductor layer using similar conditions to what is described in the PSC device fabrication section. After the interlayer was dried, CYtop (3:1 by weight) was spin coated to obtain a film of ∼400 nm. Aluminum was evaporated onto the CYtop layer as the gate electrode. All OFET devices were characterized at a probe station under vacuum.

Broader context
We report a new and universal strategy for the interface engineering of non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) by using an n-type water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymer (PFN-2TNDI) as a cathode interlayer, which results in state-of-the-art non-fullerene PSCs with a maximal power conversion efficiency of over 11%. The greatly enhanced performance of the resulting devices was systemically investigated and it was found that PFN-2TNDI works as both the charge collection interlayer and the light harvesting layer, which can enhance electron collection and contribute to photocurrent production in the resulting devices. Our results therefore not only provide a universal approach for the interface engineering of non-fullerene PSCs, but may also open up new design directions for ternary device architectures with a third component in the interface. This opens a new avenue for the future design of multifunctional interlayers for further enhancement of high performance PSCs. In addition to performance enhancement, we also found that a thick interlayer can be used without sacrificing device efficiency, which is more compatible for roll-to-roll printing processes and may pave the way for potential commercialization of organic photovoltaics technology.
