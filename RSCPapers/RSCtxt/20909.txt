Fuel cells have attracted great interest as they are promising candidates for providing clean energy.1–5 Over the past few decades, extensive research has been devoted to the development of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) that have been regarded as the promising future power sources, especially for mobile and portable applications.6–8 However, the major challenges in this field lie in the insufficient activity, unsatisfied durability and high cost of Pt catalysts. These limitations inevitably lead to a low operating efficiency of the fuel cells, which highlights the need for low cost and highly active and durable catalysts.9–11
To address the above limitations, recently much attention has been focused on the synthesis of Pt–M bimetallic electrocatalysts (where M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.).12–20 Owing to the synergistic effects between two metals, the bimetallic Pt–M catalysts often display low cost and superior catalytic performance compared to pure Pt catalysts. For example, the bimetallic PtCu alloy catalysts possess high catalytic activity and superior CO tolerance toward methanol electrooxidation in comparison with pure Pt catalysts, and have been considered as promising candidate catalysts for DMFCs.21 On the other hand, it is also realized that the surface shape and crystal structure of nanocrystals play a significant role in the electrocatalytic activity and durability.22–27 In order to further minimize the use of precious metals without sacrificing the catalytic performance, it is therefore interesting to “transfer” the idea of shape-controlled Pt crystals to its binary system. Recently, the yolk–shelled structures have attracted much interest because of their unique properties and the special core@void@shell structure.28,29 Compared with the traditional core–shell structure, the yolk–shell structures possess a higher surface area, larger void space and lower density, which leads to their wide applications in drug delivery, lithium-ion batteries and catalysis.30–32 The catalysts with yolk–shell structures possess following advantages: (i) the outer shells can effectively hinder aggregation of neighbouring particles, even under the harsh experimental conditions. (ii) The interstitial hollow space can allow the electroactive species to fully touch the catalyst and enhance the utilization ratio of the catalyst. (iii) The inner cores can afford more exposed active sites, which in turn provide much more effective interactions with the electroactive species. Therefore, by combining the merits of bimetallic system and yolk–shell structures, it is expected that the novel electrocatalysts with low cost and high catalytic activity and durability could be designed and fabricated.
Herein, we develop novel bimetallic PtCu alloy yolk–shell cube catalysts for methanol electrooxidation by using Cu2O yolk–shell cubes as templates. The Cu2O yolk–shelled cubes were firstly reported in this study, and they were fabricated by combing ZnO-assisted electrodeposition with Ostwald ripening. The formation mechanism of Cu2O yolk–shell cubes is investigated in detail in this study as it is an important p-type semiconductor material and has aroused many interests because of its potential applications in solar energy conversion, catalysis, gas sensors, and so forth. Then PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes were synthesized via disproportionation and displacement reactions in the Cu2O yolk–shell cubes. According to the previous reports, the crystals with yolk–shell structures are usually spherical, and the yolk–shell cubes have been rarely reported.33–35 Compared with the spherical morphology, the cubes exhibit many unique physical and chemical characteristics because the regular crystal planes can show different surface atomic structures and surface energies.36 Here these fabricated PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes exhibit much improved electrocatalytic activity and durability compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts.
The details of the fabrication of Cu2O yolk–shell cubes are described in the experimental section in the ESI.† The SEM image of the Cu2O yolk–shell cubes (Fig. 1a) shows that the sizes of Cu2O cubes are 2.0–5.0 μm. The inset in Fig. 1a shows a broken Cu2O yolk–shell cube. A typical TEM image (Fig. 1b) shows that Cu2O cubes have yolk–shell structures. The sizes of inner cores are 0.5–1.0 μm and the shell thicknesses are 100–200 nm. The HRTEM image and the SAED pattern of Cu2O cubes are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively, which confirm the single-crystal structure of Cu2O. The XRD spectrum of Cu2O yolk–shell cubes is shown in Fig. 2a. The (110), (111), (200), (220), and (311) reflections of Cu2O are seen, and these diffraction peaks can be exclusively indexed to the cubic phase of Cu2O (JCPDS #05-0667). Other peaks come from the substrate. No peak of Cu, CuO, Cu(OH)2 or other impurities is detected in the XRD pattern, confirming high purity of the Cu2O yolk–shell cubes.

Before deposition of Cu2O, a thin layer of ZnO is deposited on the surface of the Ti substrate, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Here the ZnO layer is crucial for the formation of Cu2O cubes. We successfully realized the fabrication of Cu2O yolk–shell cubes by ZnO-induced electrodeposition combined with Ostwald ripening. The electrochemical formation process of Cu2O is suggested as follows. Firstly, Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu+ ions on the cathode, and then OH− ions in solution react with Cu+ ions to form Cu2O. These processes can be expressed as eqn (1) and (2). 2Cu2+ + 2e− + 2OH− → Cu2O + H2O(1) Cu2O + 2OH− → 2CuO + H2O + e−(2)
The role of the ZnO layer is studied by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) measured on ZnO/Ti and Ti electrodes in the solution of 0.02 M CuCl2 + 0.68 mM C6H5Na3O7·2H2O as shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. In Fig. 2b, one reduction wave at −0.75 V is seen, and this wave corresponds to the formation of Cu2O viareaction (1). When potential is scanned positively, one oxidation wave is seen, and this wave corresponds to the oxidation of Cu2O to form CuO viareaction (2). Herein, compared with that on the Ti electrode (Fig. 2b), the CV measured on the ZnO/Ti electrode shows that the reduction wave is positively shifted, indicating that the ZnO layer can obviously induce the electroreduction of Cu2+ to form Cu2O. In addition, the conductivity of ZnO is much poorer than that of metal Ti and this leads to a slower electrodeposition rate of Cu2O. Compared with CVs measured on ZnO/Ti and Ti electrodes (Fig. 2b and c), the peak current density of the reduction wave on ZnO/Ti is much smaller than that on Ti, indicating that the growth rate of Cu2O on the ZnO layer is much smaller than that on the Ti substrate. Accordingly, the slow growth rate is highly propitious to the formation of well-defined regular Cu2O cubes as shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). However, when electrodeposition is carried out on the Ti substrate, hollow Cu2O cubes were not fabricated and only the Cu2O nanosheets were obtained, as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†). Therefore, the above results demonstrate the crucial role of ZnO layer in the fabrication of Cu2O yolk–shell cubes by electrodeposition.
Using Cu2O yolk–shell cubes as templates, we successfully realized the synthesis of novel bimetallic PtCu alloy yolk–shell cube catalysts for methanol electrooxidation. On account of the facts that the disproportionation reaction of Cu2O can occur in acid solution and the reducing potential of Cu2+/Cu pairs (0.337 V) is much lower than that of PtCl62−/Pt (0.735 V), we successfully fabricated PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes by using the disproportionation reaction and galvanic displacement in the Cu2O yolk–shell cubes. The reactions for the formation of PtCu alloys are listed as follows: Cu2O + 2H+ → Cu + Cu2+ + H2O(3) 2Cu + PtCl62− → Pt + 2Cu2+ + 6Cl−(4) Pt + Cu → PtCu alloys(5)
SEM and TEM images of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively, which show the existence of yolk–shell cubes. The HRTEM image and the SAED pattern in Fig. 3c and d indicate the polycrystalline structure of the PtCu yolk–shell cubes. The composition of PtCu yolk–shell cubes is determined by ICP-AES and the ratio of Pt/Cu is ∼1.07. The XRD pattern of PtCu yolk–shell cubes is shown in Fig. 4a. The diffraction peaks of Cu2O disappear and there isn't any Pt or Cu diffraction peak. Two broad diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.8° and 47.6° can be indexed to (111) and (200) planes of PtCu alloys, respectively (JCPDS #48-1549), indicating the formation of PtCu alloys.

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the catalysts is studied and Fig. 4b shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes and commercial Pt/C catalysts in a N2 purged 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. In the CV of Pt/C catalysts, hydrogen desorption/adsorption peaks and Pt oxidation/reduction peaks were clearly seen. Accordingly, in the CV of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes, besides hydrogen desorption/adsorption peaks and Pt oxidation/reduction peaks, Cu oxidation/reduction peaks were seen, indicating the existence of PtCu alloys. The ECSA of catalysts is calculated from the area of hydrogen desorption after deduction of a double-layer region according to the equation37 ECSA = QH/(210 × WPt), where WPt represents the Pt loading (μg cm−2) on the electrode, QH is the total charge (μC) for hydrogen desorption, and 210 represents the charge (μC cmPt−2) required for formation or stripping of a hydrogen monolayer. Herein, the calculated ECSA of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes is 116 m2 (g Pt)−1, and that of the Pt/C catalysts is 69 m2 (g Pt)−1. Therefore, the PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes show a larger ECSA than the commercial Pt/C catalysts.
The catalytic performance of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes toward methanol oxidation was studied in 0.5 M CH3OH + 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and the result is shown in Fig. 4c, which shows that the specific peak current density (all are normalized to the ECSA) of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes was almost 2.5 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, indicating that the specific catalytic activity of the PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes is much higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. In addition, the onset potential of the backward scan peak of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes obviously shifts positively relative to that of Pt/C catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4c. It is well known that the backward anodic peak is attributed to the continuous oxidation of incompletely oxidized carbonaceous intermediates, such as CO, HCOO−, and HCO−, accumulated on the surfaces of catalysts during methanol oxidation.38 Therefore, the positive shift of onset potential of the backward scan peak suggests the weakened chemisorption of intermediate species on PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes, which will facilitate the removal of adsorbed intermediate species to generate clean and active surface sites, and accordingly will enhance electroactivity and durability of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes. In addition, it is worth noting that the difference potential between the forward peak and the backward peak of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes is only 0.16 V, which is smaller than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.21 V). This implies that the Pt atoms in PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes can be more easily refreshed compared with those in commercial Pt/C catalysts.
In order to further evaluate the rate of surface poisoning of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes, the chronoamperometry curves of catalysts were measured in 0.5 M CH3OH + 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, as shown in Fig. 4d. The potential was held at 0.75 V during the measurements. It is obvious that the PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes exhibit a much higher current density over time and a much slower attenuation in comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalysts, indicating a much higher catalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation and a much higher tolerance to the carbonaceous species generated during methanol oxidation.
In summary, we have developed the synthesis of novel Cu2O yolk–shell cube templates and their application for the synthesis of PtCu alloy yolk–shell cube catalysts that have abundant active sites, short diffusion lengths of active species and sufficient void space to buffer volume expansion. When tested as catalysts for methanol electrooxidation, the fabricated PtCu alloy yolk–shell cubes exhibited much improved catalytic activity and durability compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts. Given the facile synthesis, it is expected that the Cu2O yolk–shell cube template method will open a new avenue for the development of novel catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity and durability.
