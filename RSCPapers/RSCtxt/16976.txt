    , Accepted 21st August 2017First published on 22nd August 2017AbstractA new conjugated polymer (PBFZ-OP) based on meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT-m-OP) and difluorobenzotriazole (FBTZ) was designed and synthesized for application as a donor material in non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs). The polymer exhibits a strong absorption in the range of 300–620 nm with a wide bandgap of 1.99 eV, which is complementary to that of the small molecule acceptor ITIC. Meanwhile, it also possesses a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.33 eV and a higher hole mobility of 7.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSCs based on PBFZ-OP:ITIC showed a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.5% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.8% in comparison with the PCE of 5.5% with a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 13.1 mA cm−2, and FF of 57.8% for J52-based PSCs. The results indicate that PBFZ-OP is a promising wide bandgap polymer donor for the photovoltaic application in non-fullerene PSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, non-fullerene polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention, in which the active layers consist of a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor material and an n-type non-fullerene organic semiconductor (n-OS) as the acceptor.1–3 In comparison with fullerene derivative acceptors, non-fullerene acceptors exhibit distinguished advantages of easily tunable absorption and electronic energy levels by chemical modification, good morphology stability and potential for low-cost synthesis.4–6 To date, non-fullerene PSCs have achieved an outstanding PCE of up to 10–13%.7–10 Great efforts have been devoted to developing narrow bandgap (NBG) or medium bandgap (MBG) polymer donors. However, non-fullerene PSCs with NGB or MBG polymers as the donor always exhibit relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) values in the short wavelength region, which limits the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE of the devices.11,12 Since many excellent non-fullerene acceptors such as ITIC,13 IDIC9,14 and IEIC15 exhibit strong absorption in the range of 600–800 nm, wide bandgap (WBG) polymers as donor materials will match well with their absorption spectra and be able to make full use of sunlight and thus enhance the Jsc of the devices. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient WBG polymer donors to improve the performance of non-fullerene PSCs.
Several WBG polymer donors have been designed and applied in non-fullerene PSCs with ITIC as the acceptor.16–19 Among them, the polymers based on difluorobenzotriazole (FBTZ) as the acceptor unit have shown excellent performance. For example, Li et al. synthesized the polymer J61 with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.93 eV and obtained a PCE of 9.5%.20 Our group developed the polymer donor PSBZ with an Eoptg of 1.93 eV and obtained a PCE of 10.5%.21 However, although these polymers have complementary absorption spectra with ITIC, which is beneficial for high Jsc, the Voc values of the devices are lower than 0.9 V, which resulted from their high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. In order to obtain deeper HOMO energy levels of the conjugated polymer donor, several molecular design strategies have been developed to tune the HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers.22,23 In our previous work, it has been proved that through replacing alkythienyl side groups with meta-alkoxy-phenyl side groups on BDT units in D–A polymers, the HOMO energy levels and photovoltaic performance of the polymers can be effectively improved.24,25 For example, from PBT-T to PBT-OP, the HOMO energy level down-shifted by 0.25 eV, the Voc of PSCs increased from 0.60 V to 0.78 V, and the PCE of the PSCs increased from 5.56% to 7.50%.24 From PTB7-Th to PBTF-OP, the HOMO energy level decreased from −5.30 eV to −5.45 eV, the Voc of PSCs increased from 0.78 V to 0.86 V, and the PCE of the PSCs increased from 8.3% to 9.0%.25 Therefore, BDT with meta-alkoxy-phenyl side groups is a potential building block for obtaining excellent wide bandgap donor materials with high Voc.
Recently, a wide bandgap conjugated polymer, named J52 (see Fig. 1a), based on alkylthienyl side chain substituted benzodithiophene (BDT-T) as the donor unit and FBTZ as the acceptor unit was reported by Bin et al. for application in ITIC-based non-fullerene PSCs.20 Although having a complementary absorption spectrum, the high HOMO energy level of J52 resulted in a relatively lower Voc of 0.73 V and PCE of 5.5%. In other words, it is obvious that there is much room to improve the photovoltaic performance of this blend material system. Therefore, in this work, we synthesized a new copolymer, PBFZ-OP, based on meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted BDT (BDT-m-OP) and FBTZ units. Compared with the polymer J52 based on BDT-T, PBFZ-OP exhibits a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum with an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.99 eV, which is more complementary to that of ITIC, and possesses a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.33 eV versus a HOMO energy level of −5.21 eV for J52, which is beneficial for the improvement of Voc in the PSC device.20 The non-fullerene PSCs based on the blend of PBFZ-OP:ITIC (1:1, w/w) with thermal annealing treatment at 160 °C for 10 min showed a higher PCE of 10.5% with a higher Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.8% in comparison with the PCE of 5.5% with a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 13.1 mA cm−2, and FF of 57.8% for J52. These results indicate that the PBFZ-OP is a promising wide bandgap polymer donor for the photovoltaic application in non-fullerene PSCs.

Results and discussion

PBFZ-OP was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille-coupling polymerization as shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† The number average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) of PBFZ-OP are 24.1 kDa and 1.95, respectively, measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the solvent and polystyrene as a standard at 160 °C. PBFZ-OP exhibits excellent solubility in common organic halogenated solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Moreover, PBFZ-OP shows a decomposition temperature (Td) of 409 °C at 5% weight loss as shown in the thermogravimetric analysis plot in Fig. S1a in the ESI,† which indicates that PBFZ-OP has good thermal stability for application in PSCs. No obvious exotherms or endotherms are observed from 30 to 270 °C in the differential scanning calorimetry test of PBFZ-OP (see Fig. S1b in the ESI†).

Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of PBFZ-OP in CF solution and in thin films. In solution, the maximum absorption peak of PBFZ-OP is located at 527 nm and a shoulder peak is at 567 nm, which indicates that PBFZ-OP can form strong intermolecular aggregation at room temperature in solution. In a thin solid film, the maximum absorption peak of PBFZ-OP is located at 530 nm and a shoulder peak is at 575 nm, which indicates the existence of ordered aggregation and strong π–π stacking interaction in the thin film. Meanwhile, PBFZ-OP in the film exhibits a red-shifted absorption spectrum with a stronger shoulder peak in comparison with that in solution. Furthermore, compared with J52, the absorption edge (λedge) of PBFZ-OP exhibits a slightly blue-shift in the thin film. The absorption of PBFZ-OP has a good complementarity to that of ITIC throughout the wavelength range in the film state. The λedge of the PBFZ-OP film is at 621 nm, which corresponds to the Eoptg of 1.99 eV.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure the electrochemical energy levels of PBFZ-OP. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the onset oxidation potentials (φox) and onset reduction potentials (φred) of PBFZ-OP are 0.62 V and −1.70 V vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PBFZ-OP are calculated to be −5.33 eV and −3.01 eV according to the equations:26–30EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.71) (eV). Compared with the HOMO energy level of −5.21 eV for J52, the deeper HOMO energy level of PBFZ-OP is beneficial for higher Voc of the PSCs with PBFZ-OP as the donor. In addition, the hole mobility of PBFZ-OP was measured by a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Al and the hole mobility of PBFZ-OP is 7.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (see Fig. S3a and Table S1 in the ESI†).
The PSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PBFZ-OP:ITIC/MoO3/Al. Firstly, the D/A weight ratio in the blend active layer was optimized. We found that the optimal D/A weight ratio was 1:1 (w/w), and a PCE of 8.0% was obtained with a high Voc of 0.93 V (see Fig. S4 and Table S2 in the ESI†). In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance, different thermal annealing temperatures (140 °C, 160 °C, and 180 °C) for 10 min were optimized (see Fig. S5 and Table S3 in the ESI†). We can see that the devices with the D/A (1:1, w/w) show excellent performance at 160 °C. Finally, different thermal annealing times (5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min) at 160 °C were optimized (see Fig. S6 and Table S4 in the ESI†). When treated by thermal annealing treatment for 10 min, the devices display the highest PCE of 10.5%. Interestingly, with the thermal annealing treatment from 5 min to 20 min, the PCE of all devices is over 10.0%, which indicates that the active layers have good thermal stability. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the PBFZ-OP:ITIC-based PSCs without any post-treatment present a PCE of 8.0% with a Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 16.3 mA cm−2, and FF of 53.0%. Compared with the non-annealed devices based on J52:ITIC, the PBFZ-OP:ITIC-based devices show an enhanced PCE value from 5.2% to 8.0% due to the obvious increase of the Voc value from 0.74 V to 0.93 V and Jsc value from 11.7 to 16.3 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the devices based on PBFZ-OP:ITIC with thermal annealing treatment at 160 °C for 10 min show a higher PCE of 10.5% due to the further promotion of the Jsc value from 16.3 to 18.7 mA cm−2 and FF value from 53.0% to 61.8%. Obviously, the Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, FF of 61.8% and PCE of 10.5% for the PBFZ-OP:ITIC-based PSCs are higher than those of the thermally annealed PSCs based on J52:ITIC (Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 13.1 mA cm−2, FF of 57.8% and PCE of 5.5%), which means that our design strategy is successful in improving the photovoltaic performance by replacing alkythienyl side groups with meta-alkoxy-phenyl side groups based on BDT in D–A polymers. The high Jsc values of the devices can be confirmed from the EQE spectra in Fig. 2b. All the devices show a broad photo response from 300 nm to 800 nm. For the thermally annealed devices, the maximum EQE value reached was 82% at 540 nm, which indicates efficient photon-harvesting and charge collection in the active layer. Moreover, the EQE values are all over 76% from 513 nm to 720 nm, which matched with the high Jsc values. The integral Jsc calculated from the EQE curves were quite consistent with the measured Jsc within 5% error.

The charge carrier mobilities of the blend films with or without thermal annealing treatment in the non-fullerene PSCs were measured by the SCLC method. As shown in Fig. S3b, c and Table S1 in the ESI,† the hole mobilities (μh) of the blend films are calculated to be 9.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the as-cast devices and 3.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the thermally annealed devices, which are measured with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al. The electron mobilities (μe) of the blend films are calculated to be 1.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the as-cast device and 2.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the thermally annealed device, which are measured with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al. The thermally annealed devices show more balanced μh/μe mobilities (1.07) compared with the non-annealed devices with μh/μe mobilities (1.11), which is beneficial to obtain higher Jsc and FF in the PSC devices.
The Voc and Jph values under different light intensities (Plight) were measured to study the influence of thermal annealing treatment on the charge recombination behavior in the non-fullerene system. Fig. 2c shows the plot of the relationship between Voc and Plight. The slope of Vocversus log(Plight) can estimate the degree of trap-assisted or bimolecular recombination. In general, when the slope of Vocversus log(Plight) is equal to 1 kT/q, the dominant recombination mechanism is bimolecular recombination. When the slope of Vocversus log(Plight) is equal to 2 kT/q, the trap-assisted recombination is dominant.31,32 In our work, the thermally annealed device showed a slope of 1.26 kT/q, and the non-annealed device showed a slope of 1.27 kT/q. These results indicated that thermal annealing treatment could suppress trap-assisted recombination and the bimolecular recombination is dominant in the device. The relationship between Jph and Plight can be described by Jph ∝ (Plight)S, where S implies the extent of the bimolecular recombination. It is a linear dependence between log(Jph) and log(Plight) and the slope S value close to 1 indicates weak bimolecular recombination in the device.33 As shown in Fig. 2d, the S value was 0.92 for the as-cast device and 0.94 for the thermally annealed device, indicating that the thermal annealing treatment can inhibit the bimolecular recombination in this non-fullerene system. The weak bimolecular recombination should be beneficial to obtain a higher Jsc and FF.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured for investigating the photo-induced electron transfer behavior between PBFZ-OP and ITIC. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, compared with the PL spectra of the pure PBFZ-OP or ITIC, the PBFZ-OP:ITIC blend films display more than 94% PL quenching. Moreover, the thermally annealed device shows higher PL quenching compared with the non-annealed device. The high PL quenching efficiency indicates that the devices possess effective photo-induced charge transfer between PBFZ-OP and ITIC, which is consistent with the high Jsc values in the devices.
To investigate the effect of thermal annealing treatment for the blend film of PBFZ-OP:ITIC, two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were carried out. Fig. 3 shows the 2D GIXD patterns of the pure and blend films without and with thermal annealing treatment. For the pure PBFZ-OP film, there is a (100) diffraction peak at 0.31 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 20.27 Å in the in-plane (IP) direction and an obvious (010) diffraction peak at 1.70 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 3.69 Å in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, indicating that the pure PBFZ-OP film exhibits a dominant face-on molecular orientation relative to the substrate. The ITIC film shows a weak (100) diffraction peak which is located at 0.33 Å−1 with a d-spacing of 19.12 Å in the IP direction. In the as-cast blend film, the (010) diffraction peak exhibits no apparent change compared with the pure films, which is located at 1.70 Å−1 for PBFZ-OP and 1.77 Å−1 for ITIC in the OOP direction. After thermal annealing treatment, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the IP (100) diffraction peak of PBFZ-OP significantly decreased, indicating a more ordered molecular packing of the polymer chains. Furthermore, significantly enhanced face-on π–π stacking can be observed after thermal annealing treatment, which is beneficial for charge transport. We calculated the coherence length (L010) using the FWHM of the OOP (010) peaks via the Scherrer equation.34 The L010 values substantially increased from 1.82 to 2.68 nm after thermal annealing treatment for the PBFZ-OP, which means that the overall crystallinity of the polymer was enhanced after thermal annealing treatment. The enhanced crystallinity and preferable molecular orientation are beneficial for charge transport and collection and result in high Jsc and FF.

The resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was used to probe the phase separation and average domain purity in PBFZ-OP:ITIC blend films. A photon energy of 284.8 eV was selected to provide highly enhanced material contrast.35,36 As shown in Fig. 4, the characteristic spacing indicated by the peak of the R-SoXS profiles is ∼12 nm for the as-cast blend film. While for the blend films with thermal annealing treatment, the characteristic spacing is ∼16 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the as-cast blend film. The characteristic spacing of 10–20 nm is beneficial for exciton diffusion. The R-SoXS profile data furthermore show that the relative domain purities of the blends with and without thermal annealing treatment are 100% and 75%, respectively. Purer domains can result in suppressed recombination and thus high performance.

To understand the surface and bulk morphology of the active layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out. As shown in Fig. 5, in the AFM images, the root-mean-square (RMS) value is 1.33 nm for the blend films without thermal annealing treatment. After thermal annealing treatment, the RMS value increases to 1.61 nm. The relatively rougher surface suggests a better ordering of the polymer chains and thus a better crystallinity of the polymer.37 In the TEM images, the blend film with thermal annealing treatment shows an obvious fibrillar structure compared to the as-cast blend film, which is beneficial to charge transport and suppression of recombination and achieve a higher Jsc and FF.

In conclusion, a new conjugated polymer (PBFZ-OP) based on BDT-m-OP and FBTZ units was designed and synthesized for application as the donor material in non-fullerene PSCs. The polymer exhibits a strong absorption in the range of 300–620 nm with a wide bandgap of 1.99 eV, which is complementary to that of the small molecule acceptor ITIC. Meanwhile, it also possesses a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.33 eV and a higher hole mobility of 7.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The PSCs based on PBFZ-OP:ITIC showed a higher PCE of 10.5% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.8% in comparison with the PCE of 5.5% with a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 13.1 mA cm−2, and FF of 57.8% for J52-based PSCs. These results indicate that PBFZ-OP is a promising wide bandgap polymer donor for the photovoltaic application in non-fullerene PSCs.
