    , Accepted 4th May 2015First published on 5th May 2015AbstractIn this study, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was utilized to co-axially modify hydrothermally grown Fe2O3 nanorod arrays by depositing a TiO2 overlayer to create Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell photoelectrodes. Comprehensive structural (XRD, SEM, TEM) and compositional (XPS) analyses were performed to understand the effects of the TiO2 shell on the PEC activities of the Fe2O3 core. It was revealed that the heterojunction structure formed between TiO2 and Fe2O3, significantly improved the separation efficiency of photo-induced charge carriers and the oxygen evolution kinetics. A maximum photocurrent density of ∼900 μA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was obtained for the Fe2O3/TiO2 photoelectrodes, which was 5 and 18 times higher when compared to that of hydrothermally synthesized Fe2O3 and PECVD synthesized TiO2 electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays displayed superior stability for PEC water splitting. During 5000 s PEC measurements, a steady decrease of the photocurrent was observed, mainly attributed to the evolution of oxygen bubbles adsorbed on the working electrodes. This observation was verified by the complete recovery of the PEC performance demonstrated for a second 5000 s PEC measurement carried out after a brief time interval (10 min) that allowed the electrode surface to regenerate.
1. Introduction
The growing realization that fossil resources will run out in this century and that the green-house effect caused by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels is adversely affecting the global climate has significantly triggered research interest in exploiting recyclable, earth-abundant, and environmentally friendly resources for energy production.1,2 Ever since the discovery of the PEC water splitting effect by applying TiO2 thin film as photoanodes and a Pt plate as the counter-electrode,3 research has significantly progressed on converting solar energy to chemical fuels such as solar-hydrogen. A huge amount of solar energy (3 × 1024 Joules) reaches the earth's surface every year, which is 10000 times higher than the current global consumption.1 Hydrogen is believed to be an ideal energy carrier because of achievable high energy density, storability, and clean combustion, leaving water as the only by-product. However, the traditional strategies for producing hydrogen (such as water electrolysis or hydrocarbon reformation) suffer severely from high costs and environmental pollution.4
For efficient solar hydrogen production, photoactive semiconductor catalysts are of critical importance as they should unify various materials’ characteristics in a single system.5–7 Besides a relatively narrow-band gap (1.8–2.5 eV) required to harvest most of the visible light region of the solar spectrum, excellent separation efficiency for photogenerated electron and hole pairs and long-term stability under water splitting reaction conditions are the major prerequisites that make the identification of a champion material a synthetic challenge.8–12 Among the numerous materials such as metal oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides and other compositions investigated for PEC water splitting,13–19 transition metal oxides have attracted much interest due to their intrinsically high chemical stability and high abundance. Metal sulfides and metal nitrides usually contain a much smaller band gap, but their poor stabilities significantly limited their further application for PEC applications.20,21 On the other hand, metal oxides usually exhibit a wide-band gap (>3.0 eV) that makes them poor photo-absorbers in the visible range and indicate the necessity of band gap adjustment by electronic doping or structural modifications such as core–shell or multi-layered morphology that allow harvesting maximum incident photons.
Fe2O3 exhibits excellent visible light absorption ability and is considered to be an ideal candidate for PEC water splitting. With a band gap of 1.9–2.2 eV, the theoretical solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency for Fe2O3 was calculated to be 16%.22,23 In addition to its promising optical absorption ability, Fe2O3 also displays superior stability and is non-toxic. As a result, numerous efforts have been made for Fe2O3 based PEC applications,23 however, the obtained PEC water splitting efficiencies so far were still lower than the theoretical value largely due to low concentrations of photo-generated charge carriers, short hole diffusion length and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics that suppressed the PEC water splitting efficiency of Fe2O3.24,25
Given the properties of half-filled d-orbitals, Fe2O3 with d5 electron configuration exhibits less charge carriers and lower mobility than corresponding transition metal oxides with unfilled or mostly-filled d orbits.23 Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to dope the iron oxide lattice with various cations such as Zn, Ti, Sn, Zr and Ta in order to increase the amount of charge carriers and their mobility.26–30 The literature reports suggest that cation doping is an efficient means to regulate the lattice parameters, improve the charge carrier concentration and their separation efficiency, and ultimately the PEC water splitting ability. Surface modification of the photoelectrode has been shown to be another promising approach for improved PEC ability. For example, decorating the Fe2O3 surface with a water oxidation co-catalyst such as Co-Pi31,32 can significantly improve its oxygen evolution kinetics. Also, deposition of a passivation layer was found to improve the PEC performance of Fe2O3 by passivating its surface recombination centers.33
In this study, hydrothermally synthesized Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were successfully modified with a TiO2 overlayer deposited by the PECVD technique. Fe2O3/TiO2 composites with core–shell nanostructures behave as cooperative photo-systems that resemble the tandem band energy structure occurring in natural photosynthesis.34 Promoted by an external driving force created by the applied potential at the interface between Fe2O3/TiO2 heterojunctions, the transfer of photogenerated electron and hole pairs can be effectively improved. As a result, improved PEC performance was obtained for Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays. In addition, the Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays prepared in this study showed superior PEC stability, displaying almost unchanged photocurrent density during 5000 s measurement cycles.
2. Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of β-FeOOH nanorod arrays
A facile hydrothermal method was utilized to synthesize iron oxyhydroxide (β-FeOOH) nanorods as described by Vayssieres,35 but with a minor modification. Typically, 0.15 M ferric chloride (FeCl3, 0.73 g) and 1 M sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 2.55 g) were dissolved into 30 ml deionized water with continuous magnetic stirring, and then the pH value of the solution was set at 1.5 with hydrochloride (HCl). After 15 min of magnetic stirring, the solution was transferred into a steel-lined Teflon autoclave with a cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate (FTO from Sigma Aldrich) placed against the wall of the Teflon tube. The autoclave was then maintained at 120 °C for 24 h. Finally, the β-FeOOH nanorod arrays could be obtained after washing with deionized water and ethanol several times, and after a post-annealing treatment, pure Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were obtained.
2.2 Fabrication of Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays
Plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition of titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OPri)4) was utilized to introduce a TiO2 shell on as-prepared β-FeOOH nanorod arrays. Typically, β-FeOOH nanorod arrays coated FTO substrates were first placed in the chamber of the PECVD machine (Plasma Electronic, Neuenburg, Germany). Then, a round bottom glass flask containing a certain amount of titanium precursor was connected to the reaction system. The glass flask was maintained at 70 °C to make sure the precursor was at a sufficient vapor pressure. After the chamber was pumped down to a pressure lower than 0.5 Pa, 20 sccm O2 was introduced into the chamber. After the PECVD approach with a plasma power of 100 W for different times, coated β-FeOOH nanorod arrays with different TiO2 thickness were obtained. Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays could be obtained after the post-annealing treatment at 750 °C for 2 h. For pure TiO2 film deposition, FTO glass without β-FeOOH nanorods was utilized as the substrate for the PECVD approach.
2.3 Morphological and structural characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from a STOE-STADI MP diffractometer operating in the reflection mode using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The chemical composition was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCA M-Probe (Al Kα) with an energy resolution of 0.8 eV. The charge calibration was performed by correcting C 1s peak of adventitious carbon setting to 284.8 eV to compensate the charge effect. The sample morphology was observed by using a Zeiss NEON 40 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a Zeiss LEO 912 transmission electron microscope (TEM). Raman spectra were obtained by using a triple grating micro-Raman spectrometer (T64000, Jobin Yvon).
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements of the photoanodes
A three-electrode system was utilized for the PEC measurements, in which Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays mounted onto a home-designed electrode holder served as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire with a large exposed area served as the counter electrode. The surface area exposed to the electrolyte was fixed at 0.785 cm2, and 1 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was utilized as the electrolyte. Amperometric photocurrent–potential (I–V) and photocurrent–time (I–t) measurement were obtained by using a SMU (source/monitor unit) E 5272A with two Medium Power SMU modules E5282A by Agilent. The light source was a 75 W Xe-lamp (model 71208, Newport and a Solar Simulator SSR by Luzchem) with an AM 1.5 G filter.
3. Results and discussion
A two-step method was utilized to synthesise Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays. In the first step, β-FeOOH nanorod arrays were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method, and later converted to one-dimensional Fe2O3 structures (Fig. 1a) after a post-annealing treatment (temperature 750 °C). Fe2O3 nanorods with diameters ranging from 30 nm to 70 nm were grown on the FTO substrate, which demonstrated quite smooth surfaces and homogeneous coverage (inset, in Fig. 1(a)). In the second step, PECVD was performed to deposit a TiO2 layer on Fe2O3 nanorods. After 10 min of TiO2 deposition, TiO2 particles were observed on the surfaces of Fe2O3 nanorods (Fig. 1(b) and inset in Fig. 1(b)). When the deposition time was increased to 30 min, Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorods with complete coverage of the iron oxide cores was observed that produced nanostructures of diameters larger than 200 nm. Longer deposition time resulted in thicker TiO2 coatings that filled the intergranular voids among nanorods and thus led to decreased contact area with the electrolyte (Fig. 1(d)), which ultimately suppressed the PEC water splitting ability.36,37

Cross-sectional SEM images of pristine Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 nanostructures exhibited Fe2O3 nanorods with diameters ranging from 30–70 nm randomly grown on a FTO substrate (Fig. 2a), while the length of pristine Fe2O3 nanorods was about 600 nm. TiO2 deposition performed for short time-periods (10 min) produced small TiO2 nanoparticles that uniformly covered Fe2O3 nanorods, leading to enlarged diameters and thickness (∼720 nm), as shown in Fig. 2(b). When the PECVD treatment time was extended to 60 min, Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays with much larger diameters and thickness (∼1200 nm) were obtained (Fig. 2c and d). More interestingly, Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell columnar arrays demonstrated tapered top surfaces, possibly due to the template effects; hydrothermally grown Fe2O3 nanorods also had a tapered morphology, as illustrated in Fig. 3.38–41

In order to confirm the core–shell nanostructure of the composite films of Fe2O3 and TiO2, TEM measurements and elemental mapping (Fig. 4 and S1†) were performed in the study. Whereas pristine Fe2O3 nanorods displayed a single crystalline structure, a strongly rough surface composed of small TiO2 particles resulted upon the PECVD treatment. The surface enhancement as well as the defined interface between the core and shell compositions are evident in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 4(d) shows the elemental EDX mapping results of the selected area in Fig. 4(c), displaying the spatial distribution of Fe and Ti elements. It is revealed that the Fe element was only located in the core region of the nanorod and the Ti element can be observed not only in the core region but also in the shell region, suggesting a uniform core–shell structure of Fe2O3 and TiO2. Moreover, the overlapped image of Fe and Ti elemental mapping images (the third image in Fig. 4(d)) matched very well with the selected area in Fig. 4(c). Large area elemental mapping measurements were also conducted as illustrated in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† suggesting a homogeneous lateral distribution of TiO2 species over Fe2O3 nanorods.

Fig. 5 shows XRD patterns of pristine Fe2O3 and TiO2 decorated Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. For pristine Fe2O3, diffraction peaks arose at 2θ = 35.74° and 54.58° (marked with “α”) and could be assigned to (110) and (116) planes of rhombohedral Fe2O3 (reference code: 00-073-1764). All other peaks at 26.28°, 33.77°, 37.77°, 51.76°, 61.75°, and 65.74° (marked with “*”) were attributed to (110), (101), (200), (211), (310), and (301) planes respectively, of tetragonal SnO2 (reference code: 00-046-1088). The origin of these diffraction peaks was the FTO substrate, composed of fluoride doped SnO2. After TiO2 deposition, a new peak arose at 25.37° corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2 (reference code: 01-073-1764), which was marked with “δ”. Because of the small amount of deposited TiO2, no diffraction peak belonging to TiFe-720 nm was observed. As the thickness of the film increased from 900 nm to 1200 nm, Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays yielded a more intensive (101) diffraction peak, in accordance with the larger amount of TiO2 being deposited, which was verified by SEM and TEM analyses. No other peaks were detected in the XRD patterns, suggesting the films consisted of only Fe2O3 and TiO2. To further confirm the crystal phase of Fe2O3 and TiO2, Raman scattering measurements were performed. According to space group symmetry and factor group analysis, α-Fe2O3 exhibits 7 Raman-active vibration modes (2A1g + 5Eg).42 The Raman peaks arose at 223 cm−1, 290 cm−1, 409 cm−1 and 606 cm−1 in Fig. S2,† and could be assigned to typical A1g, Eg, Eg and Eg modes of α-Fe2O3,43 whereas γ-Fe2O3 displayed obviously different Raman peaks, as described in the previous literature.44 Except for Raman peaks of Fe2O3, Eg (151 cm−1), intrinsically weak Eg (196 cm−1) and high frequency Eg (633 cm−1) vibration modes of anatase TiO2 were also observed for composite Fe2O3/TiO2 samples,45 confirming that the Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays were composed of α phase Fe2O3 core and anatase phase TiO2 shell.

The different symbols in this graph relate to different components with “*” referring to SnO2, “α” referring to Fe2O3 and “δ” referring to TiO2. 
The chemical composition of Fe2O3/TiO2 films was further investigated by the XPS technique (Fig. 6). Before TiO2 deposition, XPS peaks of pristine Fe2O3 corresponded to O 1s, Fe 2p and C 1s, suggesting the presence of Fe and O elements, while the carbon peak originated from the adventitious carbon. The binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 were located at ca. 710.3 eV and 724.0 eV, confirming the presence of Fe3+.46,47Fig. 6(c) shows the survey-scan XPS spectra of Fe2O3/TiO2 with a thickness around 720 nm. In addition to the chemical binding energies belonging to C 1s, O 1s, Fe 2p, the peaks assignable to Ti 2p and 2s were also observed. Owing to the core–shell structure, TiO2 deposits significantly decreased the peak intensity of Fe 2p. When the film thickness was further increased to around 900 nm, no binding peaks according to Fe could be observed, which is in accordance with the surface-sensitive nature of the XPS technique (Fig. S3†). The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ti 2p in Fig. 6(d) showed that the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were located at 458.2 eV and 463.8 eV respectively, which matched well with the typical binding energy values of TiO2.48,49 The possible formation of FeTiO3 was not observed due to the low processing temperature.50

Fig. 7(a) and (b) illustrate the I–V performance of pristine Fe2O3 and Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays. All the samples demonstrated negligible photocurrent density in the dark, indicating their good stability in the present PEC system. However, upon exposure to simulated solar irradiation, pristine Fe2O3, TiO2 and TiO2 decorated Fe2O3 nanorod arrays displayed different photocurrent densities. For pristine Fe2O3 and TiO2, a steady increase in photocurrent densities was observed, which reached the maximum value of about ∼175 μA cm−2 and ∼ 50 μA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. SCE, respectively. For TiO2 covered Fe2O3 nanorod arrays, at lower applied potential, the photocurrent of Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays increased slowly, whereas when the applied potential reached a certain value, the photocurrent densities demonstrated a rapid increase (Fig. 7(b)). This was due to the type-I heterojunction structure between Fe2O3 and TiO2, as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d).51,52 The conduction band of TiO2 is more negative and its valence band is more positive than those of Fe2O3. Therefore, at low or without overpotential the hole transfer from Fe2O3 to TiO2 was suppressed (Fig. 7(c)), which led to decreased PEC performance for the core–shell nanorod arrays. However, when higher overpotential was applied, more significant band bending in Fe2O3 could be created, which made photo-induced holes energetic enough to cross the potential barrier between the valence bands of Fe2O3 and TiO2 (Fig. 7(d)). Besides, the nanoparticle morphology of TiO2 remarkably increased the contact area between the photoelectrodes and electrolyte, which also played a significant role in determining the PEC performance. Nevertheless, a thick TiO2 layer might create more grain boundaries between TiO2 nanoparticles, which, to some extent, restricted the transfer of photogenerated electrons. Along with the advantages of forming core–shell nanostructure between Fe2O3 and TiO2, Ti doping was also expected because of the solid state diffusion effect during the post-annealing approach. By using different substrates in the preparation of Fe2O3 nanorod arrays, Grimes et al.53 demonstrated Ti and Sn diffusion from the substrates to Fe2O3 nanorod arrays during the high temperature annealing approach. Ti and Sn can effectively improve the amount of charge carrier density and their mobility, and therefore much improved PEC performance was obtained for Ti and Sn doped Fe2O3 nanorod arrays. The composite sample with a ∼900 nm thickness showed the maximum photocurrent density of ∼900 μA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. SCE, which was comparable with the photocurrent values of Fe2O3/TiO2 composite films prepared with the different methods described in Table 1.

Time dependent (I–t) measurement was also conducted in this study to investigate the stability of the Fe2O3/TiO2 nanorod arrays with core–shell structure for PEC water splitting, as shown in Fig. 8. During 5000 s measurement, the photocurrent firstly increased at the beginning and then decreased slowly. More importantly, this sample demonstrated a higher PEC performance for the second measurement. The increase of the photocurrent at the beginning could be assigned to the activation effect. After the activation effect, the photocurrent density of Fe2O3/TiO2 decreased slowly. This was due to the produced oxygen bubbles on the photoanode surface decreasing the contact area between photoelectrode and electrolyte. In order to investigate the long-term stability of the Fe2O3/TiO2 photoelectrode, 10 h I–t measurement was applied for the same sample with 900 nm thickness, as shown in Fig. S4.† This measurement was carried out in two stages. Four hours’ measurement was first performed, and then the electrolyte was changed for another six hours’ measurement. During long-term measurement, the photocurrent density decreased slowly. Two reasons led to this decrease, one is the decay of Fe2O3/TiO2 core–shell nanorod arrays and the other is the adsorption of the produced oxygen bubbles on the sample surfaces. When the adsorbed oxygen bubbles were released from the sample surface, a sudden increase of the photocurrent density could be observed (Fig. S4†). After 10 h measurement, we took a picture of the working electrode (Fig. S5†), which clearly displayed the existence of big oxygen bubbles at the sample surface. Fortunately, several strategies have been developed such as utilizing rotating or specially designed electrodes, which have been described in other literature reports.57,58

4. Conclusion
In this study, surface modification of hydrothermally synthesized Fe2O3 nanorod arrays by PECVD-deposited TiO2 overlayers is examined with respect to the PEC properties of single-phase and composite nanostructures. The well-defined phase boundaries and differential band gap energies of the individual metal oxides enable the formation of a tandem heterojunction structure between Fe2O3 and TiO2 that improves the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs with higher applied potential. Under the illumination of simulated solar light, the composite film with a thickness of around 900 nm displayed a maximum photocurrent density of ∼900 μA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. SCE, which was 5 times and 18 times higher than those of hydrothermally synthesized Fe2O3 and PECVD synthesized TiO2 respectively. Furthermore, this unique nanostructure also demonstrated superior stability for PEC water splitting during 10 h PEC measurement. This study on preparing 1D photoelectrodes with uniform core–shell structure will provide some insights for developing new kinds of heterojunction based photoanodes for solar energy conversion.
