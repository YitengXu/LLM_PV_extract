Indeed, significant progress has been made in recent years in terms of lifetime extension and emerging applications in catalysis. For this reason, recent synthetic strategies of new photoactive iron compounds, which have proved to show particularly promising properties, are reviewed here. The lifetime of the excited state serves as a key parameter for comparison with the standard ruthenium complex, [Ru(bpy)3]2+, to discuss the potential and performance of the iron complexes. This approach is complemented by a more holistic examination of the sustainability of such a substitution strategy in order to answer the question: when or at which point can we assume that iron represents a more sustainable alternative for noble metals in photochemical applications?Philipp DierksPhilipp Dierks studied chemistry at Paderborn University with a Hofmann scholarship of the German Chemical Society (GDCh).

1. Introduction
The use of solar energy to initiate chemical processes is a promising alternative to reduce the fossil energy consumption of chemical reactions. This approach is not only extremely attractive for chemical implementations, but also offers the possibility of a sustainable form of energy production and storage in the form of transportable energy carriers. Conducting such reactions with 3d metals, like iron, instead of expensive and environmentally critical precious metals would represent a milestone on the way into a sustainable future. Especially iron is intensively explored in this context, as it has large potential to show sufficient efficiency while being the prototype of a biocompatible and earth-abundant metal. The progress made in this field of research is based on several strategies, which have already been summarized in detail in numerous excellent overviews.1–4 Catalysts based on iron compounds recently attracted attention in the field of organic chemistry. Iron catalysts for example enable substitution, cross-coupling, and polymerization reactions and draw the potential to replace noble metals. Excellent reviews give an overall view on this topic.5,6 Furthermore, the discussion of the sustainability of iron catalysts is an ongoing debate.7 With this review, we aim at shining new light on this development by evaluating the progress made in the use of photoactive iron compounds, providing an additional sustainability assessment. Therefore, this review is divided into three main sections. The first section gives a short introduction to the topic, with a look at problems that have arisen due to high CO2-emissions and outlines the benefits of a low-emission economy. It also examines the ecological influence of metal mining and the resulting human health harm, compared between iron and its noble homologue, ruthenium, as well as iridium as a metal often used in photoactive compounds. In the second section fundamental photochemical processes are described, comparing iron and ruthenium complexes with each other, and addressing the individual advantages and limitations. In this part, the various synthetic strategies and approaches that have led to improvements of the photocatalytic properties of iron compounds are discussed in detail. This is followed in the last part by a summary that combines the advances in the development of iron complex chemistry in research with the conclusions about ecological considerations, and finally addresses the question: how large is the ecological benefit of substituting ruthenium and iridium by iron in photochemistry with metal complexes and how competitive to their noble metal counterparts are iron complexes already for photocatalytic applications?
2. How sustainable is the change from noble metals to iron?
Preliminary considerations
In the International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2020 it is stated: “Avoiding new emissions is not enough: if nothing is done about emissions from existing infrastructure, climate goals are surely out of reach”.8 As a result of the worldwide pandemic, and the downturn in the global economy, a record drop in annual CO2 emissions of 2.4 gigatons could be observed in 2020, a level last seen a decade earlier.8,9 Reduced emissions of greenhouse gases have led to improved air and water quality worldwide, which has a positive impact on human health.10–13 This aspect can be considered as an instructive effect of the pandemic and shows the pronounced impact on the environment that is possible through reduced emissions by industry. To achieve such a reduction in CO2 emissions without restricting economic progress and wealth, it is necessary to open up new sectors focused on clean energy supply, but also to develop new technologies that can replace current processes and are more climate friendly.
One important achievement would be the replacement of precious metals in photocatalysis, as these have a higher toxicity than their 3d homologues.14 The need to find a more sustainable alternative for precious metals becomes clear upon closer examination of various factors related to these elements.7 Ruthenium and iridium, as elements of the platinum group metals (PGM), are currently the key metals in (photo)catalytic applications due to their high activity. However, their abundance is very low, and they can only be mined in low concentrations associated with other PGMs. Mining of these metals takes place in only a few countries worldwide, with the largest deposits found in South Africa and Russia. Together with the USA, Canada and Zimbabwe, these five countries ensure the provision of PGMs worldwide.15 However, PGM concentrations of ores within these deposits range from 3–8 g t−1, which means that large quantities of debris must be removed to obtain sufficient material. With a total production of approximately 34 tons pure ruthenium per year16 and varying contents of ruthenium and iridium from 0.3 g t−1 in the Merensky Reef to 1 g t−1 in the UG2-Reef,17 the total amount of mined debris is at least 34 million tons. As a by-product of this energy consuming mining process, the resulting global CO2 emission was 67.4 kilotons in the year 2008.16 An attempt to take into account the various factors, such as vulnerability to supply restrictions, supply risk or environmental implications was proposed by Graedel et al. by development of an evaluation system consisting of 17 individual subcategories.18 The result of this evaluation system is a single grade for each metal in the range from 0 – of little concern – to 100, i.e. of extreme concern for nature and humans.
To illustrate this, Table 1 and Fig. 1 show a selection of some categories. The overall global production and the resulting CO2 emission are given in kilogram and kilogram CO2 equivalent, respectively. The following toxicity data are given in equivalents to mg 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DB), whereas the water depletion is shown in liters. The resulting criticality score is calculated according to a complicated procedure which is beyond the aim of the current review.15 However, a comparison of the three metals shows that iron is the significantly better alternative in terms of toxicity and environmental impact.

As the most abundant transition metal in the earth's crust, extraction of iron is much more efficient. Compared to ruthenium and iridium, iron is used in a wide range of different applications, which explains the immense amount of iron produced annually. With almost quantitative yield from ore to pure metal, the total amount produced in 2008 was 9.973 × 108 tons, which corresponds to a CO2 emission of 1510 Mt. Since then, production has continued to increase, reaching a value of 1.5 gigatons in 2017.20,21 Despite the large amount produced, the extraction of iron using the 17 categories of the “Criticality Score” shows a significantly lower impact on the environment and human health. For this reason, iron is assigned an overall score of 0.8, which is 68 times smaller than ruthenium with a score of 54.2 and 82.8 times smaller than iridium with a score of 66.3.18 Given these figures, it is obvious that iron as a metal is a much more sustainable and ecologically friendly alternative to precious metals.
Another variable that must be included as a factor of economic efficiency is the price. For pure ruthenium it has been ranging between 200–300$ per oz till 2018 and increased to around 400$ per oz during recent years; this equals around 12135€ per kg.22 The same quantity of iron costs around 10.13€ per kg,23 additionally it offers a significantly larger molar quantity for chemical use due to the smaller molar mass. From this point of view, iron would be superior by a factor of 1200 in a simplified calculation. The economic superiority is even more drastic in comparison to iridium (approx. 182000€ per kg).22 In the following sections, arguments are purely based on the criticality score of the pure metals. The assumption for this work – giving a general survey – is that ligands in transition metal complexes do not affect the evaluation in terms of sustainability. Future work might indeed require a more detailed comparison taking the non-equivalence of ligands into account. For evaluation of the sustainable progress enabled by iron in photochemical applications, first some photophysical aspects need to be considered. Thus, the electronic processes involved in photoexcited states in d6 transition metal complexes of ruthenium and iron will be explained in more detail in the following.
3. Photophysics of d6 transition metal complexes: RuIIvs. FeII
Utilization of solar energy in photocatalysis with transition metal complexes (TMCs) fundamentally relies on the ability of the photosensitizer to engage in single-electron transfer (SET) processes with organic substrates or catalysts in multicomponent systems upon photoexcitation. As key properties of TMCs suitable for photocatalysis, efficient absorption of light is necessary, photocatalytically active excited states must be populated following absorption of light and the lifetimes of these states need to be sufficiently large. Long-lived and high-energy metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) states fulfil this requirement and are usually found in metal complexes of ruthenium(II), iridium(III), osmium(II), and rhenium(I) coordinated by polypyridine ligands with low-energy π* orbitals featuring a 4d6 or 5d6 electron configuration, as in the prototype [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine).24
An exemplary description of the photoexcitation processes in RuIIL6 compounds assumes an octahedral ligand field. According to Fig. 2, the metal centered (MC) d-orbitals split into three orbitals with t2g symmetry and two with eg symmetry in an octahedral ligand field. The six valence electrons occupy the t2g orbitals in the presented strong field case. Therefore, the t2g orbitals typically form the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs). The eg orbitals and the low-energy π* orbitals of the ligands remain unoccupied, leading to a t2g6 low-spin ground-state configuration. Because of the strong ligand-field splitting, resulting from the effective metal–ligand interactions in the cases of 4d and 5d metal complexes, the unoccupied π* orbitals of the polypyridine ligands are lower in energy than the eg orbitals and represent the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of such metal complexes.25 From the singlet ground state (1GS), typically the singlet 1MLCT state is initially populated by excitation into the according absorption bands, followed by a rapid intersystem crossing (ISC), which takes place on the femtosecond time scale.26 The finally populated triplet 3MLCT states are quite long-lived, often emissive, and able to drive photocatalytic processes. In the case of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ a 3MLCT lifetime of 1100 ns is sufficiently long to engage in bimolecular SET reactions with a huge variety of organic substrates in competition with its deactivation pathways to the ground state.27

In FeIIL6 compounds with the 3d6 configuration the quest for strategies to extend the lifetime of photoactive MLCT states is ongoing. Photofunctionality is hindered by a smaller ligand field splitting compared to its RuIIL6 analogues. The eg orbitals are found at lower energies than the ligand π* orbitals and the LUMOs are represented by the eg* orbitals in iron(II) polypyridine compounds (Fig. 2). The absorption processes in the visible still lead to the population of 1MLCT states, since t2g–eg transitions are Laporte forbidden. After rapid ISC, the 3MLCT state is populated. Disadvantageously for photocatalysis, the 3MLCT usually decays into triplet 3MC states essentially without a barrier, followed by ISC and vibrational cooling. Consequently, a long-lived, non-emissive quintet 5MC state is populated.28 Relaxation from 5MC into the 1GS is both spin- and Laporte forbidden and therefore rather slow in comparison to the 3MLCT and 3MC states. The 1GS-5MC transition can be triggered by light as a consequence of the described relaxation cascade. A long-lived, non-emissive and non-catalytic active state can thus be populated by light, which is referred to as light-induced excited spin-state trapping (LIESST).28 Following this discussion, in [Fe(tpy)2]2+ (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) the populated 3MLCT state relaxes ultrafast within 150 fs into the 3MC. From here, a 5MC state is observed, with a lifetime of 5.35 ns, which naturally limits its use in photocatalytic applications,29,30 although first reports on MC reactivity could be recently provided.31
Stabilization of 3MLCT and destabilization of MC states are the two main strategies to realize the inversion of 3/5MC and MLCT states and to prevent deactivation and a loss of photocatalytic activity by MC state population. For this purpose, the ligand field splitting can be increased by strong σ-donor ligands (i.e. N-heterocyclic carbenes; NHCs) or by improvement of the octahedral geometry. Both approaches cause a higher MC energy. On the other hand, LUMO-levels can be stabilized by π-acceptor ligands or by increased electronic delocalization, both reducing the energy of MLCT states.32
In recent years numerous attempts have pushed the activity limiting lifetimes to higher numbers. In the following sections the synthetic implementations of the according key concepts are discussed, recent benchmarks are reported and new conceptual breakthroughs of FeIIIL6 metal complexes with 3d5 configuration are highlighted. In this context we will discuss the sustainability of FeIIL6 and FeIIIL6 photosensitizers in comparison to their Ru counterparts.
4. Strategies towards iron complexes of competitive photoactivity
Since various strategies have emerged in recent years to improve the photophysical properties of iron complexes, the different developments are discussed in different subcategories. The key chemical and photophysical parameters achieved by the different strategies reflected in the presented metal complexes are summarized in Table 2.

Improvement of octahedral geometry
High octahedral symmetry maximizes the overlap between the metal d- and ligand π-orbitals. This results in a destabilization of the eg levels. In iron compounds, high local symmetry is achieved by chelating ligands coordinating the iron center with bond angles as close as possible to the 180° N–Fe–N trans angle in FeIIN6 ligand systems.
A N–Fe–N trans angle of 178.3° was reported by McCusker and co-workers in [Fe(dcpp)2]2+ (dcpp = 2,6-bis(2-carboxypyridinyl)-pyridine), shown in Fig. 3.30 Additionally, the π* orbitals of the dcpp ligands are stabilized by the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups used in this ligand. An excited state with a lifetime of 280 ps was observed at room temperature. Although an increase of the 3MLCT lifetime was intended by optimization of the octahedral geometry, the excited state was identified to be of 5MC character by time-resolved X-Ray spectroscopy.35 Following this concept, Heinze and co-workers combined the electron-withdrawing dcpp with an electron-rich ddpd ligand (ddpd = N,N′-dimethyl-N,N′-dipyridin-2-ylpyridine-2,6-diamine) in a push–pull ligand design [Fe(dcpp)(ddpd)]2+ complex, which also aims at the increase of 3MLCT lifetimes. In ddpd electron-donating amines are used to connect the pyridine units instead of the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups in dcpp, therefore ddpd is more electron-rich than dcpp. In the heteroleptic [Fe(dcpp)(ddpd)]2+ complex a N–Fe–N trans angle of 178.4° is realized. Although this particular push–pull ligand design results in a ground-state recovery within 528 ps, still a 3MLCT > 3/5MC energy order is obtained.33,36
 Fig. 3  Molecular structures and excited state lifetimes of [Fe(dcpp)2]2+,30 [Fe(dcpp)(ddpd)]2+,33 [Fe(dcpp)(dqp)2]2+34 and [Fe(pdmmi)2]2+34 with optimised octahedral geometry. 
Using microwave assisted synthesis, [Fe(dqp)2]2+ (dqp = 2,6-di(quinoline-8-yl)pyridine) with a N–Fe–N trans angle of 178.4° was prepared by Gros and co-workers. [Fe(dqp)2]2+ shows a more [Fe(tpy)2]2+ like relaxation behaviour with a 3MLCT lifetime of 0.45 ps and a 5MC lifetime of 3.0 ns.34 In the same publication the improval of octahedral geometry is successfully transfered to C^N^C ligands using NHC ligands as strong σ-donors. In [Fe(pdmmi)2]2+ (pdmmi = 3,3′-pyridine-2,6-diyl(methylene)bis(1-methylimidazolylidene)) a C–Fe–C trans angle of 176.1° is realized. For [Fe(pdmmi)2]2+, 3MLCT lifetimes in the range of 7–17 ps and 3MC lifetimes in the range of 0.8–1.5 ps are reported. The deactivation pathway has not yet been fully understood, but includes a parallel decay of the 3MC- and 3MLCT-state or a mixed state decay.34 In [Fe(pdmmi)2]2+ the 5MC is excluded from the relaxation pathway. This finding is frequently reported on NHC metal complexes and further described in the following section.
Although an improved octahedral symmetry does not significantly increase the 3MLCT lifetimes, an increased MC lifetime in these cases was discovered to be an interesting tool to enable electron and energy transfer reactions, which are discussed in detail in section 5.
Introduction of NHCs and cyclometalating ligands
The energetic order of the MC and MLCT levels can be significantly influenced by N-heterocyclic carbene ligands as strong σ-donors. The use of tridentate C^N^C ligands in form of 2,6-bis(imidazol-2-ylidene)pyridine was first described by Liu et al. in 2013.29 By replacing the two external pyridine rings of a terpyridine ligand with imidazolium, a 3MLCT lifetime of 9 ps was observed for [Fe(pbmi)2]2+ (pbmi = (pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methyl-imidazol-2-ylidene)) (Fig. 4). In comparison, the lifetime of the corresponding [Fe(tpy)2] is only 145 fs.37 Studies by Wärnmark29 and Duchanois38 showed the high impact of steric shielding on the structural and electronic influence of the carbenes by demanding alkyl substituents, like tButyl in [Fe(pbbi)2]2+ (pbbi = (pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-tert-butyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene). However, such bulky alkyl ligands lead to an expansion of the Fe-carbene bond length, which has a disadvantageous influence on the carbene induced ligand field splitting. This structure expansion in turn leads to a classical behaviour observed for polypyridine compounds: after excitation, a rapid deactivation to a meta-stable MC state can be observed, followed by relaxation to the ground state.39–41
 Fig. 4  Molecular structure and excited state lifetimes of [Fe(pbmi)2]2+29,38 and [Fe(pbbi)2]2+39–41 to show the effect of coordinating NHC ligands with small and bulky side chains. 
Additionally, we showed that by increasing the number of NHC groups coordinating the FeII center, a higher degree of iron-carbene covalency can be achieved, which leads to a destabilization of the metal centered MC states (HOMO). On the other hand, this leads also to a destabilization of the π* orbitals (LUMO) due to the lower number of pyridine groups.42
To counteract the destabilization of the ligand centered LUMO orbitals, while achieving a maximal destabilization of the HOMO levels, expansion of the ligand π-system showed promising results. Initial attempts increased the π-system of the imidazole scaffold by using benzimidazole. This modification of the parent [Fe(pbmi)2]2+ complex, resulted in the corresponding benzimidazole derivative [Fe(pbmbi)2]2+ (pbmbi = (pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methyl-benzimidazol-2-ylidene) displayed in Fig. 5. The negligible difference in the σ-donor strength of the imidazole and benzimidazole NHCs is overcompensated by the increased π-system at the benzimidazole ligand, and this metal complex exhibits the desired stabilization of the ligand-centered LUMO levels.43 However, the stronger π-acceptor properties of benzimidazole also stabilize the t2g-orbitals (HOMO), leading to an increased HOMO–LUMO gap. A hypsochromic shift of the MLCT absorption is accordingly observed.44,45 Despite this undesirable blue shift of the MLCT absorption, [Fe(pbmbi)2]2+ exhibits an extended 3 MLCT lifetime of 16 ps, and thus a significant increase compared to the [Fe(pbmi)2]2+ complex.45
 Fig. 5  Molecular structure and excited state lifetime of [Fe(pbmbi)2]2+.43,44 
Following this strategy, alternative approaches to stabilize ligand π* orbitals and thus MLCT states were followed, summarized in Fig. 6. Addition of a carboxylic acid group in 4-position of the pyridine ring in [Fe(cpbmi)2]2+ (cpbmi = (carboxypyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methyl-imidazol-2-ylidene)) leads to an increase of the MLCT lifetime up to 16.5 ps due to the electron-withdrawing effect.44–47 In addition, this functionalization enables the metal complex to be grafted on a TiO2 semiconductor surface. This allowed the first use of an Iron–NHC complex in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).46,48 Here, [Fe(cpbmi)2]2+ showed an incident to photon currency efficiency (IPCE) of 2.3% which is the first IPCE for an Iron–NHC complex ever recorded. Despite the good optical and photophysical properties the measured low photocurrents was subject to a detailed analysis of the interfacial electron-transfer processes based on high-level DFT calculations.48 As a result, the use of homoleptic complexes with two electron withdrawing groups in different directions lead to disadvantages in the injection process onto the semiconductor material. However, subsequent studies with heteroleptic complexes carrying electron donating groups on the imidazole did not show any improvement. Overall, despite sufficiently long MLCT lifetimes in all cases, the inefficient electron coupling between the sensitizer and the TiO2 semiconductor orbitals lead to low injection rates.4,48 For this reason, alternative strategies are required to generate improved MLCT lifetimes, absorption properties and corresponding electronic properties that allow an efficient use of such NHC complexes in DSSCs.

Another approach is the use of pyrazine instead of pyridine in [Fe(pzbmi)2]2+ (pzbmi = (pyrazine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methyl-imidazol-2-ylidene)) leading to an increased acceptor strength of the central ring as well, which in turn leads to an even increased MLCT lifetime of 21–25 ps.49 The opposite effect, i.e. destabilization of the ligand centered π* levels, could be observed by amine functionalization, such as in [Fe(bipNMe2)2]2+ (bipNMe2 = (4-dimethylaminopyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methylimidazol-2-ylidene)), which, however, shows no significant shortening of the MLCT lifetime (10.2 ps) despite this type of functionalization.50
Using asymmetric bidentate ligands, Magra et al. described the influence of the octahedral geometry on the optical properties.51 The positive effect of using bidentate ligands has already been widely investigated for example by comparing the properties of [Ru(tpy)2]2+ and [Ru(bpy3)]2+.52–56 As a result of the bidentate ligands, different geometric isomers in a meridional and facial arrangement (14:1) around the iron center were obtained. Since both isomers could not be separated from each other, a “hemicage” ligand was developed to mimic the pure facial isomer. Both isomers reveal different potential surface landscapes and accordingly different photophysical properties. Those bidentate ligand compounds decay to the ground state via a parallel two-state mechanism which is composed of triplet states of unknown character and with a fast and a slow lifetime.51
A slightly different strategy which also uses expanding functionalization of the pyridine 4-position of C^N^C ligands, is the so-called multichromophoric approach. As described for ruthenium metal complexes, it relies on a thermal equilibrium established between the populated 3MLCT state and a nearly isoenergetic triplet state of an organic chromophore (3Chrom) in the backbone of the ligands.57 Theoretical calculations by Monari et al. for heteroleptic tetra-NHC iron compounds carrying an anthracene molecule at 4-position of the central pyridine ring, connected by different spacers, predicted the lowest-energy triplet state to be localized on anthracene, which could thus act as a reservoir for an excited state population.58 Experimental realization of this approach in the complexes [Fe(bim-ant)2]2+ (bim-ant = (4-anthracene-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methylimidazol-2-ylidene)) and [Fe(bim-pyr)2]2+ (bim-pyr = (4-pyrene-2,6-diyl)bis(1-methylimidazol-2-ylidene)) yielded in 3MLCT lifetimes of about 13 ps (Fig. 7). In both metal complexes no reservoir effect by an equilibrium between the 3MLCT and the 3Chrom states could be observed. Instead, these compounds exhibited an antenna effect from the 1Chrom to the 1MLCT. Therefore the 3MLCT state in these multichromophoric Fe(II) metal complexes is populated to a larger extent in comparison to the analogous metal complex [Fe(pbmi)2]2+ without a backbone chromophore.32

Since an inversion of the 3MC and 3MLCT states could not be achieved by the previous ligand modifications, another approach was theoretically pioneered by Dixon et al. for cyclometalated FeII metal complexes.59 This study predicts that tridentate polypyridine compounds with twofold cyclometalation can achieve an inversion of the 3MC and 3MLCT states if the cyclometalation can be realized on the terminal position of the tridentate N^N^C ligand. At the same time, in these metal complexes the 5MC state is not populated in the relaxation cascade.59 Experimental attempts to realize this strategy by us offered challenges in the metal complex synthesis. Only a mono-cyclometalated polypyridine FeII metal complex [Fe(pbpy)(tpy)]+ (pbpy = 6-phenyl-2,2′-bipyridine) could be obtained initially (Fig. 8).60 Photophysical characterization shows that a single cyclometallation is not sufficient to inverse the common 3MC < 3MLCT energy order.60 Although the 3MLCT lifetime of 0.8 ps is comparatively short, it presents a significant increase compared to [Fe(tpy)2]2+ (145 fs). In addition, only a long-lived 3MC state (12 ps) is found in the deactivation cascade. Contribution of a quintet MC state could thus be excluded, as theoretically predicted by Dixon et al.59,60

Mesoionic carbenes as strong σ-donors
While NHCs are strong σ-donor ligands, their π-acceptor capability is limited. Mesoionic carbenes (MICs) carry a negative charge on the carbene carbon atom in one of their resonance structures and act as stronger σ-donor ligands than classical NHCs. Beside this, the π* levels are lower in energy than in NHCs by the increased number of N atoms, resulting in an improved π-acceptor capability.61
This concept was first used in the heteroleptic [Fe(btz)2(bpy)]2+ complex (btz = 3,3′-dimethyl-1,1′-di-p-tolyl[4,4′-bis-(1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene)]) accessible from [Fe(bpy)Cl2] and shown in Fig. 9. Excited state kinetics of [Fe(btz)2(bpy)]2+ exhibited a decay process with three different time components, all showing MLCT character by comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments. Time constants of maximum 13 ps for the 3MLCT lifetimes were reported. DFT calculations reveal a smaller 3MLCT-3MC energy gap and a larger structural distortion of the 3MC in comparison to the corresponding tetra-NHC metal complexes. Deduced from this quantum chemical calculations the 3MLCT might begin to dictate the deactivation cascade, indicated by the lifetimes measured by TA spectroscopy.61 Detailed time-resolved X-Ray spectroscopy revealed a hot branching mechanism of the relaxation cascade. This means a vibrationally excited, hot 3MLCT is populated after photoexcitation by ultrafast ISC and vibrational redistribution leads then quickly to a relaxed 3MLCT state. The redistribution process competes with a direct channel to the 3MC state, in which a fraction of 30% of the population ends up within the first 0.15 ps. The remaining population of 70% in the relaxed 3MLCT state decays comparatively slowly (7.6 ps) to the 3MC state, which deactivates more rapidly (2.2 ps) back to the ground state 1GS.62

Recently, with [Fe(btp)2]2+ (btp = 4,4′-(pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(1-ethyl-3-methyl-1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene)) (Fig. 9) a pseudo-isomer of [Fe(btz)2(bpy)]2+ was reported to show very similar excited state kinetics. The tris(bidentate) [Fe(btz)2(bpy)]2+ is characterized by a slightly higher symmetry, however the bis(tridentate) pseudo-isomer [Fe(btp)3]2+ offers potentially higher stability.63
In the hexa-MIC metal complex [Fe(btz)3]2+ two excited state decay components were identified. A 3.6 ps time component is assigned to vibrational cooling of the excited state, while a 528 ps time constant is fully ascribed to the 3MLCT state, which is so far the largest 3MLCT lifetime ever reported for a FeII metal complex. As the 3MLCT energy is calculated to be about 1.0 eV above the ground state and the excited state oxidation potential is −1.6 V vs. Fc/Fc+, [Fe(btz)3]2+ is in principal suitable as photosensitizer in photoredox reactions.64 The increased lifetime in [Fe(btz)3]2+ in comparison to [Fe(btz)2(bpy)]2+ indicates a similar correlation between the MIC number coordinated to the FeII center and MLCT lifetime as described for NHC compounds.42,61,64
Strong mixing of amido donors and FeII orbitals
As a combination of strategies, namely strong donating ligands, energetically accessible heterocycle-based acceptor ligands and the concept of HOMO inversion introduced by theoretical investigations,65 Herbert and co-workers designed two panchromatic absorbing [Fe(pqa)2] complexes (pqa = (phenanthidin-4-yl)(quinolin-8-yl)amido, R = -tBu/-CF3) (Fig. 10) showing nanosecond charge transfer state lifetimes.66
 Fig. 10  Molecular structure and excited state lifetime of [Fe(dqa)2]66,67 and simplified molecular orbital diagram showing the effective mixing of t2g(Fe) and π-orbitals. 
In [Fe(pqa)2] the highest occupied molecular orbital is representing the π-antibonding (PA) linear combination of the N(2p) and the Fe(t2g) orbitals. The [π*(p + d)]-character HOMO is an intermediate case of HOMO inversion. One t2g orbital remains non-bonding and the lowest metal-centered orbital set is representing the π-bonding (PB) linear combination of the N(2p) and the Fe(t2g) orbitals (Fig. 10). The N(2p)–Fe(3d) mixing is further destabilizing the MC-states due to the strong σ-donating character of the amido ligands in favour of the CT-states. The unique splitting of the Fe(t2g) orbitals results in a panchromatic absorption of [Fe(pqa)2] with contributions from π-bonding to ligand (PBL)-CT in the range of 430–515 nm, MLCT (non-bonding t2g- to π*-orbitals) transitions in the range of 530–613 nm and π-antibonding to ligand (PAL)-CT in the range of 650–900 nm.66
Transient absorption spectroscopy identified two principal features, an excited state absorption (ESA) at 485 nm and a ground state bleach (GSB) at 600 nm, after PALCT excitation, both indicating a lifetime of >2 ns in both metal complexes (R = -tBu and -CF3). The ESA and GSB in the transient spectra are consistent with the interpretation of a 3MLCT state and fit to single-exponential rise and decay functions.67 The lowest lying triplet excited state was calculated to have substantial CT character with a diminished spin density on the iron center. The increased energy of the MC states and typically spectral GSB and ESA features in the transient absorption spectroscopy suggest that the nanosecond CT lifetimes can be attributed to the decay of 3PALCT which is a mixed MLCT type state.66 The lifetimes of these [Fe(pqa)2] complexes are beyond FeII analogous and competitive to those of FeIII compounds described in the following sections.
FeIII NHC-complexes
As an alternative to FeII-d6 metal complexes remarkable advances could be achieved with FeIII-d5 compounds with respect to photochemical applications. Prominent examples with outstanding excited state lifetimes, absorptivity and emission are the two metal complexes [Fe(btz)3]3+ (ref. 68) and [Fe(phtmeimb)2]+ (ref. 69) (phtmeimb = phenyl(tris(3-methylimidazol-1-ylidene))borate) shown in Fig. 11. Progress here is caused by the distinct photophysics of FeIII metal complexes combined with sophisticated ligand design concepts, resulting in FeIII hexa-carbene complexes. Frontier MOs are typically the same in octahedral in 3d5 and 3d6 metal complexes. Simplified MO diagrams include the same basic metal- and ligand-based orbitals. The partially filled t2g orbitals in the t2g5 low-spin ground-state configuration enable LMCT (ligand to metal charge transfer) transitions from a filled π orbital of the ligands to the t2g orbitals (Fig. 11). Optical spectra thus consist of π–π*, MLCT, MC and, additionally, LMCT transitions in 3d5 metal complexes, while LMCT bands are typically the lowest energy transition in FeIII hexa-carbene compounds.70 [Fe(btz)3]3+ displays a 2GS-2LMCT charge transfer absorption band at 558 nm resulting in an emissive 2LMCT excited state with a lifetime of 100 ps and a quantum yield of 3 × 10−4 in MeCN. This assignment is based on transient absorption kinetics of the ground state recovery and time resolved luminescence kinetics, which exhibit identical kinetics.68

Bottom panel: Molecular structures and excited state lifetimes of the iron(III) complexes [Fe(btz)2]3+,68 [Fe(phtmeimb)2]+.69 
With [FeIII(phtmeimb)2]+ a metal complex with nearly ideal octahedral geometry could be realized. An additional negative charge on the ligand is improving the σ-donor properties here. In this case a 2GS-2LMCT charge transfer absorption band at 502 nm and an emission maximum at 655 nm with a quantum yield of about 2% is observed and the excited state lifetime is 2 ns. The same 2GS-2LMCT excitation/deactivation processes, and typical excited state energy landscapes are proposed in [Fe(btz)3]3+ and [FeIII(phtmeimb)2]+, both shown in Fig. 11.69
As lifetimes are in the picosecond or low nanosecond range and only moderate quantum yields are observed in FeIII hexa-carbene metal complexes, non-radiative mechanisms contributing to the deactivation from the photoactive 2LMCT to the 2GS must be contemplated. As there is no obvious way to undergo ISC to higher spin states, there is still a limitation of the lifetimes in this type of metal complexes by the spin-allowed direct relaxation into the 2GS by fluorescence or non-radiative pathways. This fact is so far limiting the promising photophysical results, and it presents a future challenge to overcome this fundamental property of FeIII complexes.
5. Photoactivity of iron photosensitizers
Besides numerous activities to understand and improve the photophysics of iron complexes following visible light absorption, applications of iron complexes to initiate and enable chemical reactions are still rarely reported and the mechanistic details for the photocatalytic processes remain mainly unexplored,71–74 although iron-mediated photo redox chemistry is surely an emerging field.75 The photochemical applications of iron-based photosensitizers described in the following are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 14. Photoinitiated organocatalytic α-alkylation of aldehydes using [Fe(bpy)2]2+ and an imidazolinone organocatalyst has been reported by Gualandi et al.76 The mechanistic details of this reaction remain unknown, but assumingly a photoexcited state of [Fe(bpy)2]2+ is needed to initiate a radical reaction by an ET process, which is the starting step. Formed organic radicals are consumed and reconcentrated in an organocatalytic cycle. The mechanism proposes that [Fe(bpy)2]2+ is only necessary to initiate the reaction by an electron transfer step, but experimental proof is not provided yet.76

McCusker et al. reported an electron transfer (ET) from the 5MC state in [Fe(tren(py)3)]2+ (tren(py)3 = tris(2-pyridylmethyliminoethyl)amine; Fig. 12) with a lifetime of 55 ns to different benzoquinones (BQ) of varying reduction potentials as electron acceptors in bimolecular quenching studies.31 Reaction kinetics of transient absorption during the quenching experiments suggest the reactivity for BQ derivatives with reduction potentials more positive than −0.35 V vs. Fc/Fc+ with a quenching rate constant of 2.1–2.7 × 105 M−1 s−1.31 This research is providing the first experiments supporting an ET mechanism in photoredox reactions involving an iron(II) photosensitizer. The quenching rates support sufficient effectiveness, but a comparison to ET from [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to benzoquinone gives a quenching rate constant of 2.2 × 1010 M−1 s−1, which is about 5 magnitudes more effective.77 The criticality score is roughly about the factor 50 larger in ruthenium. Dividing the factor in quenching rate constants and the factor in the criticality score (105 divided by 50) results in [Ru(bpy)3]2+ still being more effective by a factor of 2000 in the sense of sustainability.
 Fig. 12  Molecular structures and excited state lifetimes of the iron(II) complexes [Fe((tren(py)3)]2+31 and [Fe(tri)2]2+.63 
Recently, we could observe an unprecedented energy transfer (EnT) from a long-lived metal-centered state with a lifetime larger than 1.6 ns in [Fe(tri)2]2+ (tri = 2,6-bis(1-ethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine; Fig. 12) to oxygen leading to the conversion from triplet oxygen 3O2 to singlet oxygen 1O2. Experimental results suggest that this Dexter-type energy transfer is caused by the 3MC state, but unequivocal proof for this conclusion could not yet be provided. The existence of 1O2 was shown directly by the detection of singlet oxygen phosphorescence and indirectly by singlet oxygen reactivity for the ring opening oxidation of DPBF (1,3-diphenyl-isobenofuran) after excitation in the visible range.63 Assessment of the reactivity in comparison to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in the ring opening oxidation of DPBF63 showed approximately half the reactivity of the reported iron complex. Taking the criticality score into account and assuming that the ligands have a similar impact on the score, this means an overwhelming superiority of the iron photosensitizer by a factor of 34. Under ecological aspects using the criticality score, iron is 68 times better than ruthenium, which allows iron to be a little less effective than ruthenium, but still being more sustainable. Further research in the field of energy transfer reaction thus offers the potential of iron complexes becoming an ecological and economical much more beneficial photosensitizer in comparison to their noble metal counterparts.
Both photocatalytic mechanisms of [Fe(tren(py)3)]2+ and [Fe(tri)2]2+ are relying on MC-states and thus differ fundamentally from the charge transfer-based photoredox chemistry associated with metal complexes of the second and third transition metal series, commonly using i.e. ruthenium(II) and iridium(III) complexes.
Application of iron complexes in photoinduced charge transfer reactions using reactive MLCT states can also be found only rather rarely. In our group a series of heteroleptic Fe(II)–NHC complexes was realized, which can be used as a noble-metal free catalysts for light-driven proton reduction.78,79 The activity ratio of the photosensitizer [Fe(pbdppi)(tpy)]2+ (pbdppi = (pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(3-2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene); (Fig. 13) compared to the well-established iridium complex [Ir(ppy)2bpy][PF6] is 1:17 in the applied photocatalytic set-up.78 With the criticality score ratio of 1:82 for iron vs. iridium, this supposedly small reactivity of iron becomes competitive. In order to circumvent diffusion limitations, which can completely prevent photoreactions with photosensitizers showing short lifetimes, noble-metal free dyads offer a valuable approach. We developed such an assembly, connecting an iron photosensitizer and a cobaloxime catalyst, which showed a beneficial effect on the observed MLCT lifetime at the FeII center.
 Fig. 13  Molecular structures and excited state lifetimes of the heteroleptic iron(II) PS [Fe(pbdppi)(tpy)]2+78 and the heteroleptic dyad [Fe(bpbmi)(pbdppi)]2+.79 
By increasing the acceptor properties of the cobalt catalyst, the lifetime of the iron center can be increased and low reversible reduction levels of the linker can be achieved.79
Following this strategy, we recently presented a Fe–Co dyad with an activity ratio of 1:3 compared to an iridium-cobalt multi-component system, yielding an activity modified criticality score in which the iron system is 27 times more beneficial than the iridium one.80 In this dyad, the respective photosensitizer [Fe(bpbmi)(pbdppi)]2+ (bpbmi = (4,4′-bipyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(3-methyl-imidazol-2-ylidene); (Fig. 13) contains a bridging ligand with a C^N^C donor set instead of the previous described used N^N^N of terpyridine. This system is stable to dissociation at the pyridine-cobalt bond in concentrated solutions above 5 mM. Catalytic experiments via photocatalytic proton reduction showed higher activity of the dyad compared to the dissociated multi-component system. This behaviour was explained by an exhaustive characterization of the ground and excited states. The electronic interaction of the Fe- and Co-center is observed in the optical absorption, showing a unique spectral feature, which can be attributed to a reduction of the HOMO–LUMO gap as a result of MLCT state stabilization, following the connection of both metal centers.80 This effect was observed in the excited state lifetimes of both species, as well, since the dyad possesses an additional increase of 3 ps of the 3MLCT lifetime (19.8 ps) compared to the multi-component system (17.1 ps).80 Although not very frequently reported, these studies represent a considerable progress in charge-transfer catalysis initiated by FeII complexes, which can be considered competitive to noble metal complexes by comparison of the reactivities and taking into account the criticality scores.
A similar situation is found for FeIII photosensitizers. The previously described [FeIII(phtmeimb)2]+ turned out to be a photooxidant and photoreductant in two different electron transfer model reactions.69 Reductive quenching was demonstrated by diphenylamine (DPA) as electron donor with a quenching rate of 1.4 × 1010 M−1 s−1. Oxidative quenching was demonstrated with MV2+ (methyl viologen) as an electron acceptor with a slightly lower quenching rate of 2.7 × 109 M−1 s−1. For both quenchers, the formation of electron transfer products was confirmed by characteristic absorption signals in transient absorption spectra. Bimolecular quenching rates are comparable with those of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ emphasizing a similar quenching rate in electron transfer oxidation and reduction reactions.81,82 According to a more detailed study tracing the full bimolecular photocycle of [FeIII(phtmeimb)2]+ the charge separation rate using dimethylaniline as sacrificial electron donor is 1.25 ps−1 and significantly faster than the charge recombination rate of 0.2 ps−1. These values are higher than for standard Ru-based sensitizers and in the same range as those of organic dyes.83
Very recently Aydogan et al. have reported reductive α-dehalogenation using [FeIII(phtmeimb)2]+ as a PS and green light.84 After photoexcitation the generated 2LMCT state is reductively quenched by dimethylaniline via ET, having a solvent cage escape yield of >0.6. The reduced PS induces an irreversible heterolytic C–Cl bond cleavage at the substrate. Hantzsch ester is dehydrogenated in a further step to yield in the final product of the reductive α-dehalogenation (Fig. 14 and Table 3 entry 6.3).84
 Fig. 14  Schematic overview of the wide range of applications of iron photosensitizers in photocatalysis. 
In light of the criticality score the similar quenching rates, advantageous charge separation rates and accessibility of photoredox transformations make iron complexes advantageous in terms of sustainability. Since such reactivity studies are still rare, individual comparisons are of course still limited. Nevertheless, due to the huge difference in the criticality score, even rather low photoactivities of iron complexes become competitive concerning sustainability aspects.
6. Conclusions
In addition to the development of new sustainable processes to achieve the climate targets we have set ourselves, the further development of existing processes plays an important role. From this point of view, iron has become established as an ecological alternative in photocatalysis, and there have been pioneering advances in tuning of the photophysical properties of iron complexes in recent years. In this context, some promising strategies have emerged that make the application of iron complexes in photocatalysis increasingly efficient. Sophisticated ligand design was able to extend the lifetime of photocatalytically active states to the nanosecond range, allowing them to show significant activity in various photocatalytic applications. The current limited number of available examples does not fully allow a general comparison of iron and noble metal photosensitizers, however already now some cases are found in which iron and noble metal complexes show a comparable activity. Even in cases where iron complexes show lower activity, inclusion of sustainability considerations in form of the criticality score, leads to conclusions in favour of iron complexes. With respect to the first part of the title, it is clear: iron is by far more sustainable than precious metals, which is indeed common knowledge.
Referring to the second part of the title is then of course a bit more differentiated. If only environmental aspects are considered, then iron complexes could already now substitute noble metals. But for large scale applications, also other factors, mainly economically driven, play a decisive role, and reaction engineering and upscaling cannot be neglected. In order to give iron photochemistry a chance, the activities of noble metals must be reached. If this aim is reached, the full sustainable power of iron comes into fruition. The challenge thus is still present, and it is defined by reaching equal activities compared to noble metals. The task is clearly defined in the realization of reactive states of sufficient lifetime. Considering the rather young age of iron photochemistry, and the limited number of works on this topic, the intermediate success is very promising. Finally, there are some other base-metal elements on the horizon, which also show exciting photochemical properties.85–92 Thus the future of photochemistry might face a base metal age.
