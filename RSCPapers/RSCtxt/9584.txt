        Lithium-ion battery constitutes one of the most popular energy sources which powers current electronic instruments. It is also a promising candidate to be used in future electric devices. To fulfil its potential in future battery market, the better properties of lithium-ion batteries, e.g., higher capacity, better rate performance, are undoubtedly required.

Broader context
The demand for sustainable energy sources to power electrical devices has become a serious issue, since traditional energy sources such as fossil fuel cannot alone satisfy the fast growing demands, and the carbon emission associated with their use has caused great environmental concerns. Among all the new energy sources under research, lithium ion battery (LIB) is proved to be among the most promising ones due to its inherent merits such as low cost and environmental friendliness. The exploitation of advanced electrode materials is essential to the application of LIB in electrical devices because only when the electrochemical performances (capacity, rate performance, cycling stability, etc.) of LIB meet all the demands of the devices, can the application of LIB be possible. Recent research has established that the application of a unique ‘nanocable’ structure in LIB electrodes can greatly improve the electrochemical performances of the battery, which is of great importance to the development of LIBs. To fulfil the potential of such structure, the clarification of these ‘nanocable’ materials and further intensive research about them are highly desired.

1. Introduction
Currently, the demand for energy sources to power diverse electric devices is growing fast.1–8 The reduction of carbon emissions has also become a serious issue.1–8 All these have driven humanity to reconsider their energy economy to meet the energy and environmental demands.1–8 This new economy must be energy-saving and sustainable. Lithium-ion battery (LIB) has been considered as a suitable energy source that can be used both currently and in the future, since it possesses many merits such as being cost-effective and environmentally friendly.1–8 However, to take the place of battery-of-the-future, LIB still need to achieve many goals. Higher capacity and better rate performance are highly desired for LIBs to be used in the future electronic instruments and vehicles. This requires scientists to search for various composite and morphological solutions of electrode materials to meet the demands. The nanotechnology has been a powerful tool in the design of new electrode materials for LIBs.9–25 Recently, it has been found that the application of nanocable or the like structure in LIBs can significantly improve batteries' electrochemical performances.17,20,26–29 Thus, it is important to get an overview of the nanocable studies and try to figure out how the application of nanocables would bring out better batteries and affect the long-term development of LIBs.
In this perspective, we will discuss the definition, designs, synthesis approaches and application of nanocable-like electrode materials in LIBs. The latest achievements and the future developments in this research field are also discussed. We hope that this may give us a better understanding of the unique nanocable-like structure and its future applications in batteries and other possible energy sources.
2. Structure features and superiorities of nanocables
In the search for better LIBs, the selection and fabrication of appropriate electrode materials are imperative. The electrode materials need to possess many properties like enabling fast ionic and electronic transport, storing high amounts of lithium and doing so rapidly and reversibly.3–7,30 It is really hard and perhaps impossible to find a single component that can fulfil so many harsh and often conflicting requirements. Thus, it always needs to use more than one component to fabricate composite electrode materials. A single component of the material is able to fulfil part of the requirements and thus all the requirements may be fulfilled by the composite. However, there comes a technical problem at the same time: how to preserve the advantages of the components while avoiding their disadvantages. The nanotechnology has provided a solution: to synthesize nanocomposites that possess specific structures.11–23 Both the shape and size of the nanocomposites can be almost precisely controlled with the advanced nanotechnological methods. Various composite nanostructures have been successfully synthesized, such as nanorods, nanowires, and so on.17,20,24,26–32 Among these nanostructures, nanocables have been proven to be especially effective.17,20,26–30 For convenience, we will use the word ‘nanocable’ to represent all the nanocable-like electrode materials below.
Although there have been many reports on nanocables for potential applications in the fields of photonics, electrics and magnetics, there are few reports on their use in lithium-ion batteries. So what is a nanocable? What specific features should a nanocable possess to meet the requirement as electrode material in LIBs? Fig. 1a gives a schematic illustration of a nanocable structure suitable for use in LIBs. As shown here, a nanocable can be defined as a one-dimensional (1D) nanocomposite with different components forming a core/shell structure. The shell component generally consists of the active material while the core component consists of the electronic conductive material. Generally, the core component is more electronic conductive while the shell component is more ionic conductive.27,29,30,33 The lithium could be stored in all the components or just one of them (usually the shell).33,34 Typically, the length of a nanocable is in the micrometre scale (1–100 μm). The aspect ratio of length to width of the nanocable is generally larger than 2. The outer diameter of the nanocable is in the range of 10 to 1000 nm while its inner diameter is in the range of 1 to 800 nm. Correspondingly, the thickness of the shell of the nanocable is normally in the scale of 1 to 200 nm. The surface area of the nanocable is generally comparable with that of the nanoparticle which constitutes its main component, e.g., the surface area of a typical TiO2-based nanocable is generally in the range of 50 to 200 m2 g−1 (close to that of nanostructured TiO2). In order to design nanocables suitable for use in high-efficient lithium-ion batteries, they should possess two important characteristics. One is that the shell layer should be porous with interconnected nanochannels to guarantee quick transport of Li+ from liquid electrolytes. The other is that the nanocables should have open ends with exposed core to form interconnected networks together with added electronic conductive material (e.g., carbon black) for electrons.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of nanocables with electronically conducting core (yellow) and Li+ providing nanoporous sheath (blue). (b) Corresponding schematic illustration of the effectively mixed conducting 3D networks formed by the nanocables and carbon black. 
Such a nanocable structure can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of the active material in the composite.33 Many active materials used in LIB electrodes are sufficiently ionic conductive but suffer from the problem of lacking adequate electronic conductivity, which limits the electrochemical properties of the battery.27,30,33,34 The introduction of electronic conductive materials into active materials to form nanocomposites has been used a lot to solve this problem.27,30,33,34 However, the morphologies of the nanocomposites need to be precisely controlled for making full use of the advantages of the active and conductive materials but avoiding their drawbacks. There are not so many specific structures of the nanocomposites that can meet such demands. After intensive research, it has been established that the nanocable structure is one of the most advantageous ones. The active material is always at the outside and constitutes the shell of the nanocomposite, which makes it easy for the lithium ion to diffuse from the liquid lithium-ion-containg electrolyte. The core material acts as the electron diffusion pathway and enables fast electron transport in the electrode. Through this way excellent ionic–electronic wiring is successfully achieved in the nanocables and good electrochemical performance is obtained in LIBs.27,30,33
The nanocable structure might also solve another annoying problem in LIBs, i.e., the capacity losses and rate performance decreases of the batteries due to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers upon cycling.33–37 Generally, the SEI layer is formed due to the reduction of electrolyte on the surface of the electrode materials.36,37 Such layer would consume active materials and electrolytes as well as hinder Li ion transport. Thus a thin and stable SEI layer is highly required for achieving good electrochemical properties of LIBs. Electrode material in LIBs generally consists of only one component. Thick and unstable SEI layers are often formed on the surface of electrode materials, causing fast decrease of battery capacity.36–38Li ions also cannot quickly go through thick SEI layer, which in turn makes the rate performance of battery rather poor. When a nanocable structure with a stable surface is applied, the as-formed SEI layer could be thin and stable, which fully meets our demands. Currently, although the researchers are still unclear as to why the SEI layer is so different in the nanocables, this unique property has already benefited the LIBs.
A single nanocable can be taken as a small ‘conductive network’ on the nanometre scale, in which the Li ions and electrons are readily transported. When a 3D nanocable network is built upon addition of electronic conductive materials (e.g., carbon black), a larger conductive network is formed on the micrometre scale (Fig. 1b).19,33,34,39 The 3D nanocable network can further enlarge the advantages of nanocable structures. That is because the separate nanocables are efficiently connected by the added electronic conductive materials, so that the electrons can be more effectively transported within the whole electrode. An important point to be emphasized again is that a single nanocable must have the end of its electronic conductive core component exposed, so that the added material can connect these nanocables. In this 3D nanocable network, the Li ions move via the active materials and the electrons move via the conductive materials. This obviously indicates an excellent ionic–electronic wiring, which undoubtedly leads to good electrochemical properties of the LIBs.
Let us address the other issues of nanocables for their use in LIBs. The unique core/shell structure of nanocable effectively prohibits the aggregation of nanoparticles and thus provides good stability of the material, which further benefits the electrochemical performance of the nanocable. The coulombic efficiency of the nanocable for an initial cycle is normally in the range of 70 to 80%, which is comparable to those of the nanomaterials with other structures. Due to the enhanced stability of the nanocable, its coulombic efficiency after the initial cycle is quite high, especially in high-rate conditions. For example, the coulombic efficiency of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable can stabilize between 99–100% after the initial cycle.33 Generally, the volumetric capacity and energy density of the nanocable are similar to those of other nanomaterials with identical components in normal conditions but even better in high-rate conditions. To promote the practical application of nanocables, cheap materials and cost-effective synthesis routes are highly desired, as demonstrated in the following section of the paper.
3. Approaches for the synthesis of nanocables
Many experimental approaches have been reported for the synthesis of nanocables, which include electrodeposition method,40chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method,27,30,41 hard template method,42electrospinning,31,43hydrothermal method, wet-chemical method20,26,29,33,44–47 and so on.48–52 Usually, structure-directing templates are utilized in these studies to assist the construction of the nanocables. The templates include porous membranes,27,30 colloidal crystals,42,49 and surfactants,44etc. In the following sections we will briefly introduce several representative experimental procedures for the fabrication of nanocables and their electrochemical properties toward lithium storage.
The electrodeposition synthesis of nanostructured materials has been successfully used for a long time. A representative example of this approach for the synthesis of nanocables is the fabrication of self-supported Fe3O4–Cu nanocables by Simon et al., which uses an anodized alumina oxide (AAO) membrane as a template.30 In the procedure, well-dispersed and uniform Cu nanopillars were firstly made by direct electrodeposition of copper into the pores of the AAO membrane supported on a commercial copper foil. The size of the Cu nanopillars can be readily controlled through adjusting the pore size of the AAO template. After the AAO membrane was dissolved, polycrystalline Fe3O4 was coated onto the Cu nanorod arrays. The as-synthesized Fe3O4–Cu nanocables showed a well-distributed pattern. Fe3O4 was the active material while the Cu nanorods acted as the current-collectors in the nanocables. Every Fe3O4-coated Cu nanopillar can be taken as a single nanocable and obviously a 3D nanocable network was formed by these Fe3O4–Cu nanopillars.
The template-assisted CVD synthesis of nanocables has also been used by Ajayan et al. to fabricate CNT@MnO2 nanocables.27 In this procedure, AAO template was also used to firstly fabricate MnO2 nanotubes, followed by growth of CNTs in MnO2 nanotubesvia the CVD method. Then the template was dissolved in NaOH solution. The as-prepared CNT@MnO2 coaxial nanocables exhibited uniform morphology and formed a 3D nanocable network from the large-scale viewpoint.27
Traditionally, the electrodeposition and CVD methods as mentioned above are hard to operate and cannot be applied to large-scale production.27,30 Solution-based wet-chemical method does not suffer from these problems and can thus be a promising choice for the large-scale fabrication of nanocables.20,26,33,44–46 Using this method, we have successfully fabricated nanocables with a TiO2-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) structure.33 In this synthetic procedure, the CNT was firstly treated by HNO3 and then dispersed in ethanol solution. Subsequently, tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) was added to the solution, followed by the addition of water to promote its hydrolysis. Then the solution was refluxed and centrifuged to get the TiO2 precursor-coated CNT, which was further annealed under Ar atmosphere to get the CNT@TiO2 nanocables.33,53 These nanocables exhibit a unique core/porous-sheath coaxial structure (Fig. 2), i.e., the CNT constitutes the core component while the TiO2 constitutes the sheath component. It should be noted that the TiO2 sheath was not dense but porous so that Li ions can readily get through it. The end of the nanocable was CNT-terminated, which enables the connection of the nanocables by added electronic conductive acetylene black. In this way an efficient mixed conducting 3D network was established. It is hard to precisely determine the surface ratio of the exposed end and the covered cable part of the nanocable. Based on the SEM images of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable, we roughly estimate that the width of the exposed end and covered cable part is almost the same while their lengths are about 100 and 2000 nm, respectively. Thus, the surface ratio of the exposed two-end to the covered cable part should be about 0.1 (or less). Since the exposure of the core at the end of the nanocable is mainly achieved through cut-off of the shell by ultrasonication, the ratio of the exposed two-end and covered cable part can be controlled through adjusting the ultrasonication time. Our experimental results showed that the nanocables can easily have all their ends exposed after proper ultrasonication treatments.
 Fig. 2  (a) TEM images of CNT@TiO2 nanocables, inset shows the HRTEM image of the CNT core, (b) HRTEM images of the TiO2 nanoporous sheath of the CNT@TiO2 nanocables.33 
Another choice for the fabrication of nanocables on a large scale is the soft template method, which takes organic surfactants as the template. Recently, we have successfully synthesized Cu/TiO2 nanocables using this method in a wet-chemical procedure, in which polyethylene glycol (PEG) was chosen as the template.29 In this procedure, CuCl2, PEG and NaOH were dissolved in water. In this way Cu-based nanowires were obtained, which were further dispersed in ethanol solution. Then TBT was added to this solution. Upon the addition of water to this solution and subsequent heating, TiO2-coated Cu-based cable-like nanocomposites were formed, which were defined as Cu/TiO2 precursors. These precursors were further annealed under firstly either air or Ar atmosphere and then H2/Ar atmosphere to get the final Cu/TiO2 nanocables (Fig. 3). The size of TiO2 crystals in the Cu/TiO2 nanocables can be controlled by adjusting the calcination conditions. In the Cu/TiO2 nanocomposites, the Cu acted as the current collector while the TiO2 was coated and acted as the active material. The length of the nanocomposites was at the micrometre scale while its width was at the nanometre scale. At the end of these 1D nanocomposites, the Cu nanowire was exposed so that all the 1D nanocomposites can be efficiently connected when electronic conductive acetylene black was added. In this way an efficient mixed conducting 3D network was also successfully built up.
 Fig. 3  (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM images of Cu@TiO2 nanocables. Inset in (a) is schematic illustration of the nanocable structure, TiO2 (blue), Cu (red).29 
The above methods can be readily applied for the fabrication of all kinds of nanocables through carefully choosing the suitable templates and corresponding synthetic procedures. The shape, size and morphology of the nanocables are all controllable since the properties of the templates can be adjusted according to the demands. The experimental conditions can also be precisely controlled. It is promising that the fast-developing nanotechnology can extend the fabrication of nanocables to large-scale production with low cost, which might open up a shining pathway for future LIBs.
4. Electrochemical performance of nanocables as electrode materials in LIBs
4.1 Electrochemical performance of symbiotic coaxial nanocables
As discussed in Section 2, excellent electrochemical performances of LIBs are expected when nanocables are applied as electrode materials, which mainly originates from the hybrid structure of the electrodes with improved electronic and ionic conductivity. When both the core and the shell components are active materials, the symbiotic effects for the storage of lithium in the nanocables could also contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of the electrodes. In the following we will take the CNT@TiO2 nanocable as an example and show its improved electrochemical properties when applied as anode material in LIB.33 The reason associated with the improvement of the electrochemical performance will also be discussed.33

Fig. 4 displays the electrochemical performance of the CNT@TiO2 nanocables. The chemical composition of the nanocable is 72 wt% TiO2 and 28 wt% CNT as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It is known that lithium could be stored in both CNT and TiO2. Fig. 4a shows the discharge/charge profiles of the CNT@TiO2 nanocables cycled under a current density of 50 mA g−1. The total reversible capacity of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable is about 406 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. Since the storage of lithium in TiO2 normally occurs between 1–3 V while that in CNT occurs under 1 V, the total capacity of the nanocable could be divided into the specific capacity of TiO2 and that of CNT, respectively. Back to the charge curve obtained between 0.01–3 V indicates a capacity of 153 mA h g−1 below 1 V. Therefore, the specific capacity of the mesoporous TiO2 sheath in CNT@TiO2 is calculated to be 212 mA h g−1 (i.e., 153/0.72 mA h g−1), which is >3 times larger than that of normal TiO2 (66 mA h g−1). In turn, the specific capacity of the CNT core is calculated as 904 mA h g−1 (i.e., (406–153)/0.28 mA h g−1), which is also much larger than that of the bare CNT (367 mA h g−1). These results demonstrate the superior electrochemical property of the CNT@TiO2 nanocables. Both the lithium storage in TiO2 and that in CNT are improved in the as-formed core/shell structure. One reason for such enhancements is that the electronic conductivity of TiO2 is significantly improved by the presence of CNT, i.e., the electronic conductivity of CNT@TiO2 nanocomposite (1 × 10−3 S m−1) is as much as 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of pure TiO2 (1 × 10−7 S m−1). The other reason is that the presence of TiO2 effectively prevents the formation of a thick and unstable SEI layer on the surface of CNT, which subsequently guarantees the efficient storage of lithium in CNT, as explained in more detailed below. Moreover, the fast transport of lithium ion to the CNT core is promoted by the presence of the TiO2 nanoporous sheath.33
 Fig. 4  Typical discharge-charge profiles of CNT@TiO2, TiO2-free CNT, and CNT-free TiO2 sample under current densities of (a) 50 and (b) 3000 mA g−1 between voltage limits of 1–3 and 0.01–3 V. The inset in (a) shows the corresponding differential capacity plots. (c) Comparison of the rate performance of CNT@TiO2, TiO2-free CNT, and CNT-free TiO2 sample between voltage limits of 0.01–3 V. The specific storage capacities in CNT core and TiO2 sheath are also shown. Shaded areas represent the capacity contribution from TiO2 or CNT in the CNT@TiO2 nanocables. (d) Cycling performance of CNT@TiO2 nanocables under a current density of 1000 mA g−1 between voltage limits of 0.01–3 V.33 
Besides the as-mentioned high capacity, the CNT@TiO2 nanocable also exhibits low polarization, excellent rate performance, and remarkable cycling stability. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4a, the polarization value of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable is only 120 mV, which is much lower than that of bare TiO2 (220 mV). Fig. 4c shows the rate performance of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable in a current density range of 50–5000 mA g−1. The specific rate performances of the TiO2 sheath and CNT core in the nanocable, which were calculated according to their weight percentage, are also shown and compared with those of bare TiO2 and CNT in Fig. 4c. The specific capacity of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable can still maintain ∼90% of its initial capacity when the current density increases from 800 to 5000 mA g−1. This is much better than the rate performance of bare TiO2 (where almost no capacity is kept) or CNT (only ∼30% of the initial capacity is kept). Especially, the CNT@TiO2 nanocable can still deliver remarkable capacities at high current densities (Fig. 4b). When the current density is as high as 3000 mA g−1, the capacity of the nanocable is 244 mA h g−1, which is about 3 times higher than that of CNT (74 mA h g−1) and much higher than that of TiO2 (<5 mA h g−1). Fig. 4d displays the cycling stability of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable. As shown here, almost no capacity loss is observed over 100 cycles when the current density is 1000 mA g−1, which indicates the excellent stability of the nanocable structure during use in LIB.
As discussed before, a major reason for the excellent electrochemical performance of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable is that the presence of CNT provides good electronic conductivity, which benefits the storage of Li in TiO2. Besides, there is another major reason for the improvement of the electrochemical performance, i.e., the formation of a thick and unstable SEI layer on the surface of CNT is prohibited by the protection of TiO2.33TEM investigation has demonstrated that a SEI layer as thick as 20 nm is formed when bare CNT is fully lithiated whereas the SEI layer decreases to only 2 nm thick when CNT is delithiated. Such thick and unstable SEI layer consumes active material and electrolyte and also hinders Li transport, which causes large irreversible capacity loss, poor cycle life and low rate performance of the electrode. However, only a very thin SEI layer (∼1 nm) is found on the surface of TiO2-coated CNT in both lithiated and delithiated states. This unique property of the CNT@TiO2 nanocable efficiently avoids the loss of active material and guarantees quick Li access to the CNT core, which leads to an improved electrochemical performance of the nanocable.
All the above excellent electrochemical performances indicate that the symbiotic coaxial nanocable structure provides a ready solution to the ionic–electronic wiring problem and leads to much improved electrochemical properties of electrode materials in LIBs. Such a nanocable structure is very beneficial and might be applied to designing many other electrode materials. For example, when designing cathode materials for high-power LIBs, LiFePO4 can be chosen to fabricate in the form of nanocables with CNT core since it needs electronic wiring and its surface is quite stable when exposed to organic electrolyte.
4.2 Electrochemical performance of nanocables with integrated nano-current collectors
To improve the electrochemical performance of the active materials in LIB electrodes, a clever choice is to fabricate nanocables with integrated nano-current collectors. As discussed in section 2, the lack of good electronic conductivity is a major problem for many active materials with poor kinetics. The integration of nano-sized electronic conductive material into active material leads to the formation of a cable-like nanocomposite.30 Since the nanocomposite possesses its own nano-current collector, electronic conductivity could be greatly enhanced, which would lead to better electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, the integrated nano-current collector also acts as a mechanical support to strengthen the structural stability of the composite.
Now let us revisit the Cu-TiO2 nanocable which is discussed in section 3. In this nanocable, the TiO2 particles in shells are the active material while the Cu nanowires in cores are the electronic conductive materials. Each Cu nanowire can be taken as an integrated nano-current collector of the corresponding nanocable. In a typical synthesis, the Cu-TiO2 nanocables (denoted as S1) were synthesized through calcination of the Cu-TiO2 precursor in air atmosphere and a further reduction process in H2/Ar atmosphere. The average size of the anatase TiO2 particles in the as-prepared S1 is ∼18 nm as determined by XRD and TEM. The Cu content in S1 is 13.9 wt%. This nanocable exhibits excellent rate performance when applied as anode material in LIB (Fig. 5a). As the current density increases from 50 to 5000 mA g−1, the specific capacity of the nanocable decreases slowly from 183 to 82 mA h g−1, whereas that of bare TiO2 decreases dramatically from 147 to 12 mA h g−1 under the same conditions. The result demonstrates that the Cu-TiO2 nanocable anode material with Cu nanowires as its ‘own’ current collectors could improve the contact efficiency between the active material and the current collector (copper), and effectively enhance electronic conductivity as well as rate capability.
 Fig. 5  (a) Comparison of the rate capabilities of the Cu-TiO2 nanocables obtained by calcining under air atmosphere (S1) and bare TiO2 nanospheres prepared in the absence of Cu-based nanowires by quenching under air atmosphere at different current densities. (b) Comparison of the rate capabilities of the Cu-TiO2 nanocables obtained by calcining under Ar atmosphere (S2) and bare TiO2 nanospheres prepared in the absence of Cu-based nanowires by quenching under Ar atmosphere at different current densities. Voltage limits are between 1 and 3 V.29 
However, an even better electrochemical performance can be obtained in an alternative Cu-TiO2 nanocable (denoted as S2) with the same components of Cu and TiO2 as S1 but with different Cu content and TiO2 particle size. The Cu-TiO2 precursor was annealed in Ar instead of air atmosphere at first and then further annealed in H2/Ar atmosphere to get S2. The average size of TiO2 particles in the as-synthesized S2 is much smaller (possibly <1 nm) than that of S1 as determined by XRD, HRTEM and Raman. The Cu content in this sample is 27.4 wt%. The S2 with higher Cu content and smaller TiO2 particle size exhibits better rate performance compared to S1 when also tested as anode material in LIB (Fig. 5b). Even under an extremely high current density, i.e., 7500 mA h g−1, this nanocable can still hold a favorable specific capacity of 125 mA g−1, which is about 58% of its initial capacity delivered at 50 mA g−1 (216 mA h g−1). Such an outstanding performance is much better than that of bare TiO2 and is also superior to those of most TiO2-based materials.
The differences in the electrochemical performances of S1 and S2 inspire some reasonable considerations. Since S1 and S2 contain the same compositions of Cu and TiO2 and possess a similar structure, the differences of their electrochemical properties must be related to the distinction of the Cu content and the grain size of TiO2 therein. As shown above, the Cu content in S2 is higher than that in S1. Thus, the larger content of conductive phase could partially contribute to the better rate performance of S2. Moreover, the smaller TiO2 grain size in S2 could also contribute to the better rate performance of S2. That is because the complete lithiation of TiO2 to LiTiO2 is only possible in the first 4 nm of the particle.54 The present TiO2 in S2 with an X-ray amorphous structure (possibly less than 1nm) is right in the fully lithiated range, whereas that in S1 (∼18 nm) is not. This also coincides with the well-known ‘size effect’ in LIBs, i.e., nanoparticles with smaller size generally exhibit higher lithium electroactivity.55–59 The fast-developing nanoscience and nanotechnology has already established that the electrochemical properties of nanomaterials are closely linked with their nanostructures.11–21 As for the nanocables, the particle size could also be one of the determining factors for tuning the electrochemical performance of nanocables.
The above example clearly shows that the integration of nano-current collectors into active materials to fabricate nanocables is very effective for the improvement of electrochemical performance. This will allow future researchers to carry out the synthesis and application of various nanocables with their own integrated nano-current collectors in LIBs. Many challenges still exist, e.g., how to fulfil these designs remains one. The promising nanotechnologies are expected to provide substantial solutions in the future.
5. Other applications of nanocables in energy storage systems
The nanocables may find many other applications in energy storage systems besides being used as electrode materials in LIBs as the principles of many electrochemical energy storage systems are quite similar. For example, the LIBs and supercapacitors can be regarded as different points of a continuous electron transfer system. In LIBs, the energy is stored as electrochemical reactions between two opposing electrodes, while in supercapacitors, the energy is stored as electrostatic charges between the electrodes. The recent discovery of interfacial mass storage by Maier et al. blurs the boundary between batteries and supercapacitors and promises advanced hybid electrochemical energy storages.60 In the following part we will show the promising properties of the two nanocables of CNT@TiO2 and Cu-TiO2 when used as electrode materials in hybrid supercapacitors.
To test the performances of the two nanocables as supercapacitor electrode materials, hybrid capacitors were assembled by using the counter electrodes made from actived carbon (AC). The working electrode was fabricated by pressing a mixture of 80 wt% active material (CNT@TiO2 or Cu-TiO2), 10 wt% super-P acetylene black conductive additive, and 10 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) onto a piece of nickel mesh. The counter electrode was prepared by casting a slurry consisting of 90 wt% AC, 10 wt% PVDF per nickel mesh. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate with a weight ratio of 1:1:1. The capacitor was cycled at different current densities (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15 A g−1) between voltage limits of 0 to 2.5 V. Ragone plots (Fig. 6) for the two nanocables were calculated by means of the galvanostatic charge–discharge method based on the mass of the nanocables. Both nanocables exhibit outstanding high-energy and high-power performance as compared to the traditional AC electrode. For example, at a power density of 1470 W kg−1, the CNT@TiO2 nanocable and the Cu-TiO2 nanocable in the supercapacitors can still deliver an energy density of 148 and 142 Wh kg−1, respectively, which is about 15 times and 14 times larger than that of AC (typically 10 Wh kg−1). The results indicate the possible application of the nanocables in advanced supercapacitors with enhanced energy densities.

Besides being used as supercapacitor materials as shown above, the nanocables may also find possible applications in electrochemical sensors,61 solar cells40,45,52,62 and so on.46 The potentials of nanocables are still needed to be fully explored and many advanced characterization techniques need to be employed.
6. Conclusions
Nanocables are able to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of electrode materials in LIBs, bringing about higher capacity, better rate performance, longer cycling life, and many other favorable properties. Such improvements mainly originate from the unique core/shell structure of the nanocable. In a nanocable, the functions of electron transport and lithium storage could be fulfilled, respectively, in the core component and the shell component. The better electronic conductivity of the nanocables leads to better electrochemical property as compared to the bare active material system. When the core component is also the electrode material, the electrochemical performance of the nanocable can be further enhanced by its dual functions.
Moreover, the stability of the electrode material might also be improved by the unique nanocable structure in the case of the shell material with good surface stability, which also contributes to the improvement of electrochemical performance. Furthermore, an efficient mixed conducting 3D network can be formed when electronic conductive materials like carbon black are mixed with nanocables, which makes the nanocables possess remarkable rate capabilities when being used in LIBs as electrode materials.
Electrochemical tests show that these nanocables exhibit much better properties than bulk electrode materials. The integration of own nano-current collectors can further improve the electrochemical performances of the nanocables. The nanocables can also be used in many other energy storage systems such as hybrid capacitors. Despite these achievements, more intensive research is still required to fulfil the potential of nanocables. The promising nanotechnology can undoubtedly help us fabricate various nanocables with well designed characteristics, which promotes the development of better batteries.

Broader context
The demand for sustainable energy sources to power electrical devices has become a serious issue, since traditional energy sources such as fossil fuel cannot alone satisfy the fast growing demands, and the carbon emission associated with their use has caused great environmental concerns. Among all the new energy sources under research, lithium ion battery (LIB) is proved to be among the most promising ones due to its inherent merits such as low cost and environmental friendliness. The exploitation of advanced electrode materials is essential to the application of LIB in electrical devices because only when the electrochemical performances (capacity, rate performance, cycling stability, etc.) of LIB meet all the demands of the devices, can the application of LIB be possible. Recent research has established that the application of a unique ‘nanocable’ structure in LIB electrodes can greatly improve the electrochemical performances of the battery, which is of great importance to the development of LIBs. To fulfil the potential of such structure, the clarification of these ‘nanocable’ materials and further intensive research about them are highly desired.
