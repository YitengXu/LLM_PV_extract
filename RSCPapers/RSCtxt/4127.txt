    , Accepted 28th May 2023First published on 29th May 2023AbstractGel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are emerging materials for Zn–air batteries (ZABs), since the GPE can act as a combined electrolyte and separator in the battery. GPE-KOH was fabricated through the polymerization of poly(acrylic) acid in the presence of KOH and ZnO. GPE-KOH-KI was fabricated following a similar procedure, followed by immersion in a solution containing KOH, KI, and ZnO. The addition of KI to the electrolyte changed the conventional charging reaction to a reaction with a lower thermodynamic barrier, which improved the battery efficiency with a maximum increase of 36% relative to ZABs without KI. This work focused on extending the working temperature range of the ZAB to low temperatures (as low as −41 °C) as well as exploring the reaction mechanism for ZABs using KI as an additive. It is proposed that the discharging reaction at the air electrode is a combination of the oxygen reduction reaction and iodate reduction reaction.
Introduction
The increase in global temperatures in recent years has raised awareness of climate change caused by the use of fossil fuels.1,2 The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies, such as solar energy and wind energy, is considered as a potential solution to mediate this problem.3,4 However, these energy sources are subject to weather conditions which can cause the supply to be unstable.5,6 Electricity, as one of the forms of these energy sources, can be stored in batteries. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have proven their success in commercial use, but the high cost of using LIBs in grid storage makes them less competitive compared with other batteries, such as metal–air batteries.7 One of the candidates that is receiving considerable attention is zinc–air batteries (ZABs).8 Zinc is a much safer material compared with Li and is more abundant in the earth's crust, which makes ZABs potentially more affordable.9–11
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are electrolytes stored in a polymer host.12 They can also act as a separator in ZABs and, therefore, prevent short circuiting caused by dendrite formation at the Zn electrode.10,13,14 In addition, GPEs have good mechanical properties which allow them to be used in flexible batteries.12,15–19 When applying ZABs in electronic devices, the batteries are expected to be able to function in reasonably cold environments.20 However, when the temperature is decreased to sub-zero values, GPEs may freeze, causing the electrochemical reactions to slow considerably, resulting in significantly reduced battery efficiency or even failure.21,22
The aggregation of water molecules linked by hydrogen bonded networks results in ice formation.23 Therefore, disruption of the formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be used as a strategy to extend the operating temperature of GPEs to low temperatures. Selecting a suitable polymer host should be the first step as the polymer provides the backbone of the GPE. Pei et al. compared PVA and PAA as a potential host polymer for their GPEs and used density functional theory to calculate the interaction energy between the polymer and water molecules. A larger absolute value of the interaction energy indicates stronger bonds between the polymer and water molecules as well as better tolerance to low temperatures. PAA was selected as the host polymer because the carboxyl group in PAA with adjacent water molecules has a larger interaction energy (−54.06 kJ mol−1) than that of PVA (−25.56 kJ mol−1).24
In addition to the selection of a proper host polymer, additives can be utilized to reduce the crystallization temperature of GPEs. One approach is to add organic solvents (e.g., ethylene glycol and glycerol) to GPEs.25 This method reduces the crystallization temperature of GPEs, but the ionic conductivity of GPEs is reduced at the same time.24 To successfully add ethylene glycol to GPEs also requires costly and complex procedures that may be harmful to the environment.26 Another approach is to add a suitable salt (e.g., CaCl2, NaCl, ZnCl2, and their mixtures) to the GPE during the synthesis step.25 This method utilizes one of the colligative properties of ionic compounds. In the study conducted by Pei et al., alkalifying the carboxyl groups in PAA into the salt form improved the interaction energy between water molecules and PAA from −54.06 kJ mol−1 to −70.96 kJ mol−1.24 The crystallization of water was reduced due to ion hydration in this method.20 In the case of ZABs, 6–7 M KOH is generally selected as the electrolyte due to the maximum ionic conductivity and near-maximum Zn/Zn2+ exchange current density achieved.9 This feature gives ZABs an advantage in low-temperature applications as the crystallization temperature of the electrolyte without any additives may already be sufficiently low for most battery applications.
Efforts have been made through the use of catalysts for ZABs to achieve better battery efficiencies at room and low temperatures.27–34 From the perspective of electrolytes, KI has been reported as a reaction modifier in ZABs when utilized as an additive to the electrolyte. This is achieved by altering the path of the reaction when charging the battery. Instead of following the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) path during charging, an alternative pathway which has a lower thermodynamic barrier is followed.35,36 Also, since KI is a salt, its colligative properties can be used to further reduce the crystallization temperature of the electrolyte.24 Therefore, the battery efficiency of ZABs at both room and sub-zero temperatures can be greatly improved. However, the discharging reaction(s) of the battery are not clear, which raises concerns regarding the reversibility of ZABs utilizing KI as an additive in the electrolyte.
In this study, GPEs using PAA as the host polymer with KI (GPE-KOH-KI) and without KI (GPE-KOH) are investigated for application in rechargeable ZABs at room and low temperatures. The addition of KI to the electrolyte altered the conventional charging reaction, which significantly improved battery efficiency. Both GPEs, with and without KI, demonstrated excellent low-temperature tolerance, to temperatures as low as −41 °C. The synthesis procedures for the GPE without KI and the air electrode electrocatalysts are based on previous work done within the authors' research group.37–41 The objectives of this study are to develop GPEs for ZABs that can deliver competitive battery performance at room and low temperatures and to explore the viability of utilizing KI as an additive to the electrolyte.
Experimental details
Synthesis of GPEs
GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI were synthesized for this study. All chemicals for the electrolytes were purchased from Fisher Scientific and Sigma-Aldrich and used in the as-received condition.
The target precursor solution volume for both GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI was 20 mL. For GPE-KOH, 7.29 g KOH, 0.3256 g ZnO, 0.685 mL acrylic acid, 0.0925 g N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA), and 0.008 g KPS were added to a conical tube and mixed with deionized water (DIW) using a vortex mixer. The solution was mixed vigorously for about 2 min before transferring it to round-bottom tubes. The tubes were then kept in an oven at 65 °C for 1 h to complete polymerization. The prepared GPEs were air cooled to room temperature overnight before use. GPE-KOH-KI was synthesized using the same synthesis procedure but without ZnO added during fabrication. Instead, after air cooling overnight, samples without ZnO were immersed in a solution containing 6 M KOH, 2 M KI, and 0.4 M ZnO to obtain GPE-KOH-KI.
Synthesis of electrocatalysts
(Co,Fe)3O4 decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), developed previously in the authors' group, and Pt/RuO2 mixed with carbon black (benchmark catalyst, containing 40 wt% Pt and 20 wt% Ru, purchased from Alfa Aesar) were used as air electrode electrocatalysts. Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O (98+%) was purchased from Acros Organics. FeSO4·7H2O, NaOH pellets, reagent alcohol (RA) (histological grade), and Nafion (D-521 dispersion, 5% w/w in water and 1-propanol) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. N-CNTs (30–50 nm diameter, 1–2 μm length) were purchased from MKnano. Gas diffusion layer (GDL) substrates (5% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated, Sigracet 39 BB) were purchased from the Fuel Cell Store. Carbon cloth (W0S 1009, Cetech) was purchased from Taobao.
To prepare the GDL substrates impregnated with (Co,Fe)3O4 decorated N-CNTs, 35 mg Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 175 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 80 mg NaOH, 50 mg N-CNTs, and 10 mL reagent alcohol were stirred at 800 RPM for 10 min in a 30 mL glass vial. The suspension was then sonicated for 5 h before being transferred to a 250 mL beaker. 15 mL of RA and 1 mL of Nafion were added to the beaker and a circular GDL (4.5 cm in diameter) was soaked in the suspension. Sonication of the suspension was performed for 20 min with the beaker sealed with a piece of parafilm. The GDL was then taken out and dried in air before placing it in a vacuum filter. The vacuum filter allowed 7 mL of the catalyst suspension to pass through the GDL. Once the GDL appeared dry, it was rinsed twice with RA, once with DIW, and one more time with RA. The 20 min sonication and filtration processes were repeated for two other pieces of GDLs. All GDLs were air dried overnight and annealed at 300 °C for 30 min before use. The mass loading of (Co,Fe)3O4 on each GDL was roughly 2.5 mg cm−2.
A spray coating technique was used to prepare Pt/RuO2 on carbon cloth (W0S 1009, Cetech). 50 mg of a Pt/RuO2 mixture on a carbon black support, 2 mL DIW, 1 mL of isopropyl alcohol, and 0.1 mL Nafion were added to a 1 dram vial. The vial was then sealed and placed in ice water to sonicate the suspension for 45 min. A spray brush (Royalmax Airbrush, 0.2 mm nozzle diameter) was used to spray coat the post-sonication suspension onto a piece of 4 cm × 8 cm carbon cloth. The Pt/RuO2-coated carbon cloth was dried at 60 °C for 30 min with a resulting mass loading of about 0.47 mg cm−2.
Cell fabrication
Fig. S1a† shows a sandwich-type cell made from acrylic sheets that was utilized for ZABs with GPEs. A piece of polypropylene film was used in the sandwich-type cell to restrict the contact area. Two pieces of GPEs were employed to achieve better current distribution. The thickness of the GPE in the cell was 3 mm. The contact area between the electrolyte and the air electrode was 1 cm2, with 1 cm2 exposed to air.
Zn foil (0.25 mm thick) and acetone were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Prior to use in galvanostatic charge–discharge cyclability tests, pieces of Zn foil were ground using abrasive sandpaper (1200 grit, LECO) and washed with acetone and then RA. Once dry, all sides of the highlighted areas (shown in Fig. S1c†) of the Zn foil were coated with epoxy (EpoThin 2, BUEHLER). The epoxy-coated Zn foil was left in a fume hood overnight to let the epoxy harden. This epoxy was utilized to prevent water line corrosion of the Zn foil during electrochemical testing.
Materials characterization
A Tescan VEGA3 SEM coupled with an Oxford energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was used for microstructural characterization of the Zn and air electrodes. The accelerating voltage utilized was 20 kV for both SEM and EDX analyses.
Ionic conductivities of PAA-KOH and PAA-KOH-KI were measured using potentiostats (BioLogic VSP and SP300) through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at open circuit potential with an applied 10 mV AC potential from 100 kHz to 10 mHz in a sealed CR2032 coin cell. For measurements at low temperatures, the coin cells containing GPE were stored in a freezer (DW-60W28, Ligfreezer Low-Temp Equipment Co., Ltd or Midea WHS-65LB1) for 20 min before testing. The following equation was used to calculate the ionic conductivities of the GPEs. (1)where δ is the ionic conductivity of the GPE, l is the thickness of the GPE, R is the resistance of the GPE, which is the value of the intersection with the x-axis in the Nyquist plot, and A is the area of the GPE.
An electrolyte retention capacity test of GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI was performed in dry (58% relative humidity) and humid (85% relative humidity) environments with the GPEs exposed to ambient air (21 °C). The masses of the GPEs were recorded over time and the following equation was used to calculate the electrolyte retention capacity of the GPEs. (2)where Wr and Wi are the electrolyte retention capacity and the mass of the GPE at time i, respectively. W0 is the initial mass of the GPE.
The rheological properties of the GPEs were characterized by using a rheometer (Kinexus Lab+) with a parallel plate geometry. An amplitude sweep from 0.1 to 100% strain at 1 Hz was utilized to determine the linear viscoelastic region (LVER).
To determine the volume occupied by PAA in GPE-KOH, a 4 mL GPE-KOH sample was taken out of the round-bottom tube and immersed in DIW for 3 days to allow the electrolyte to leach out of the GPE. Then the sample was completely dried in a vacuum oven.
To analyze composition changes in the electrolyte after charge and discharge, an aqueous mixture of 6 M KOH and 2 M KI was charged at 0.83 V vs. Hg/HgO and an aqueous mixture of 6 M KOH, 2 M KI, and 0.0467 M KIO3 was discharged at −0.77 V vs. Hg/HgO using a potentiostat (BioLogic VSP) and carbon cloth coated with Pt/RuO2 as the air electrode. The setup is shown in Fig. S2a.†
An ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometer (Varian Cary 50) was employed to generate UV-vis spectra for aqueous KOH, KIO3, KI, and their mixtures. The samples were diluted to ensure that the absorbance values were smaller than 1. Quartz crucibles with a path length of 5 mm were used for testing.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Ultima IV, Cu Kα radiation) was used to analyze the crystal structures of pristine Zn foil and the cycled Zn electrode. The 2θ range was from 9.47 to 100° with a scan rate of 2° min−1.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were performed using BioLogic VSP and SP300, as well as Arbin LBT20084, potentiostats. For batteries using GPEs as electrolytes, the batteries were left in the ambient environment for 1 h before any full cell testing to allow the GPE to wet the GDL or carbon cloth. To bring the temperature of the battery to low temperatures, the batteries were kept in a freezer (DW-60W28, Ligfreezer Low-Temp Equipment Co., Ltd or Midea WHS-65LB1) for 2 h after assembly and the 1 h wetting step. The temperatures of the freezers were set to 0 °C, −25 °C, and −45 °C. However, due to fluctuations of temperature in the freezers, the actual temperature ranges were −3 ± 2 °C, −28 ± 5 °C, and −41 ± 3 °C. The corresponding temperature for each temperature range is reported as −3 °C, −28 °C and −41 °C, respectively. In galvanostatic charge–discharge cyclability tests, each cycle was 30 min long and composed of a sequence of 10 min discharge, 5 min rest, 10 min charge, and 5 min rest. During galvanostatic charge–discharge rate tests, the batteries were discharged at 2, 5, 10, and 20 mA cm−2 for 10 min at each current density, followed by a 10 min rest before charging at the same current densities for 10 min each. Cut-off voltages for the rate and cyclability tests were set at 0.7 V and 3 V. Battery efficiency for both cyclability testing and rate testing was calculated using the following equation. (3)where η is the battery voltage efficiency, while Edischarge and Echarge are the battery discharge voltage and charge voltage, respectively.
The battery efficiency improvement percentage was calculated using the following equation. (4)where ηGPE-KOH-KI and ηGPE-KOH are the calculated battery efficiencies for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI and GPE-KOH, respectively.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the reactions at the Zn electrode and the air electrode in aqueous electrolytes. The three-electrode setups for CV tests for the air electrode and the Zn electrode are shown in Fig. S2a and b,† respectively.
Discharge polarization curves were obtained by discharging the battery from 0 mA to 400 mA with a scan rate of 1 mA s−1. The power density of the batteries was determined using the discharge polarization curve and the following equation. P = J × V(5)where P, J, and V are the power density of the battery, discharge current density, and the corresponding discharge voltage, respectively.
Results and discussion
Characterization of gel polymer electrolytes
Rheological measurements were performed for GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI using an amplitude sweep for the confirmation of successful synthesis of GPEs. Conventionally, in rheology testing, the phase angle (δ) needs to be between 0° and 45° in order for a sample to be considered as solid-like (i.e., gel state).41 As shown in Fig. 1a, tanδ values for GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI are both smaller than 1, which indicates that both samples can be classified as GPEs.

Impedance plots and ionic conductivity (shown as insets) of (e) GPE-KOH and (f) GPE-KOH-KI at different temperatures. The color schemes for the main legend and inset bars are matched. 
To estimate the crystallization temperature of GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI, the phase diagram for the KOH–H2O system (shown in Fig. 1b) was used. The amount of K corresponding to a 6 M KOH aqueous solution is about 3.5 at%. As illustrated in the diagram, the corresponding crystallization temperature for KOH solution at this concentration is about −50 °C, which should be sufficient for most battery applications. When stored in a freezer at −41 °C overnight, neither of the GPEs froze. Therefore, GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI both have good low temperature tolerance and were later used in low temperature electrochemical tests.
Electrolyte retention capacity testing for GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI was performed in a closed container in both dry (58% relative humidity) and humid (85% relative humidity) environments by exposing the GPEs directly to air at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 1c, when tested in a dry environment, GPE-KOH-KI has better electrolyte retention than GPE-KOH, with an electrolyte retention of 98.7% at 12 h and 90.7% at 100 h compared with GPE-KOH with an electrolyte retention of 96.9% at 12 h and 84% at 100 h. The host polymer plays a vital role in the water retention capability of the GPE. PAA is highly hydrophilic and is known as a superabsorbent which can absorb water in amounts corresponding to several hundred times its weight, which may hinder water evaporation from the GPE.42,43 The slower dehydration rate of GPE-KOH-KI may be attributed to the hydration of K+ and I− that improved the attraction between ions and water molecules.36 When tested in an environment with an 85% relative humidity (RH), Fig. 1d shows that the weights of both GPEs increase at nearly the same rate, to 110% of their initial weights at 12 h and 155% at 100 h. This result reveals the hygroscopic properties of the GPEs.44 In daily use, RH fluctuation in ambient air is common and the intrinsic semi-open structure of ZABs allows water in the electrolyte to evaporate. Therefore, the GPE can absorb water when the RH is higher to offset water loss when the RH is lower. The volume occupied by the polymer in a 4 mL GPE was 0.28 mL, which means the polymer backbone in the GPE only occupies 7% of the total volume.

Fig. 1e and f show ionic conductivities, determined from the EIS plots, for GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI at 21 °C, −3 °C, −28 °C, and −41 °C. Ionic conductivities for both samples are almost the same at low temperatures with the ionic conductivities of GPE-KOH being slightly higher than those of GPE-KOH-KI. At 21 °C, GPE-KOH has an ionic conductivity of 216 mS cm−1 whereas GPE-KOH-KI has a conductivity of 184 mS cm−1. An increase in the amount of ions may improve the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. However, when the temperature is −3 °C or lower, the viscosity of the electrolyte increases and the ion transport kinetics are expected to decrease, which affects the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Depressing the freezing point of the electrolyte by adding more salt is considered an effective strategy for enhancing the ion transport kinetics of electrolytes at low temperatures.45 The addition of KI to the GPE lowers the crystallization temperature of GPE-KOH-KI relative to GPE-KOH, which helps narrow the ionic conductivity gap between the two electrolytes at low temperatures. Zhang et al. added KI to PAM and compared its crystallization temperature with that of the sample without KI. PAM with KI added exhibited a crystallization temperature of −63.3 °C, whereas the crystallization temperature of the sample without KI was −45.0 °C.36
Electrochemical performance of ZABs using GPE-KOH
A sandwich-type cell (shown in Fig. S1a†) was used for full cell testing of ZABs with GPE-KOH. Pt/RuO2 was used as a benchmark electrocatalyst. However, as shown in Fig. S3,† the electrochemical results obtained using Pt/RuO2 are worse than those obtained using (Co,Fe)3O4 decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) as the air electrode catalyst. Therefore, a GDL with (Co,Fe)3O4 decorated N-CNTs was used as the air electrode. Fig. 2a shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves at different current densities (referred to as rate tests) and different temperatures. Table S1† summarizes the rate test battery efficiency as well as the peak power density for each condition. ZABs using GPE-KOH delivered relatively stable battery performance at current densities up to 10 mA cm−2 at −41 °C and remained operable at 20 mA cm−2 and −28 °C with reduced stability relative to higher temperatures. Also, the battery efficiencies dropped as the temperature was decreased. Larger decreases in efficiency occurred at higher current densities. For example, the battery efficiency for 2 mA cm−2 dropped by 13% when the temperature was decreased from 21 °C to −41 °C, but the efficiency for 10 mA cm−2 was reduced by 22% with the same temperature drop. Furthermore, ZABs using GPE-KOH failed when tested at 20 mA cm−2 and −41 °C. As the temperature dropped, the ionic conductivity of GPE-KOH decreased and electrochemical reaction kinetics became more sluggish. Operation at higher current densities requires relatively higher electrolyte ionic conductivities and faster reaction kinetics, which may be the reason why the decrease in battery efficiency was larger at higher current densities and why the battery could not operate at 20 mA cm−2 when tested at −41 °C.

Cyclability tests at different temperatures of ZABs using GPE-KOH at (c) 2 mA cm−2, (d) 5 mA cm−2, and (e) 10 mA cm−2. (f) ZAB lifetime test using GPE-KOH at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2. 

Fig. 2b shows the discharge polarization curves and their corresponding power densities at different temperatures. The peak power density for ZABs using GPE-KOH decreased significantly when the temperature was reduced from 21 °C to −3 °C, with 127 mW cm−2 achieved at 21 °C and 38 mW cm−2 at −3 °C (70% drop in power density). However, the differences in power density at the lowest temperatures were not as significant as the difference when the temperature was decreased from 21 °C and −3 °C, with a 21 mW cm−2 drop from −3 °C to −28 °C and a 6 mW cm−2 drop from −28 °C to −41 °C. A number of factors may be responsible. A decrease in temperature results in an increase in charge transfer resistance and a decrease in ionic conductivity.47 Therefore, ion diffusion velocity is reduced. As the temperature approaches the crystallization temperature of the GPE, the GPE becomes more rigid and the wettability of the GPE worsens, resulting in an increase in the interfacial resistance. At low temperatures, electrochemical reaction kinetics also become more sluggish.47–49 These factors are responsible for the decrease in power density.
To investigate the cyclability of ZABs using GPE-KOH, GCD cyclability tests were performed at different current densities and temperatures. Fig. S4a† shows a comparison between two cyclability tests conducted in the winter and summer. Initially, a cyclability test was conducted at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2 in the summer using GPE-KOH as the electrolyte and a GDL with (Co,Fe)3O4 decorated N-CNTs as the air electrode. The same test was performed later in the winter using the same setup to check the repeatability of the result. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the cyclability of the battery was significantly worse and the battery failed (i.e., reached the cut-off voltage of 3 V) close to the end of the test when tested in the winter. Efforts were made to identify the cause(s) of the poor results. Fluctuations in the RH in the laboratory were eventually determined to be the reason. Therefore, for all cyclability tests conducted at 21 °C, the RH of the test environment was controlled to about 85%, to reduce the effect of RH fluctuations. When tested at other temperatures, the corresponding RH was measured but not controlled. The measured RH values in the freezers at −3 °C, −28 °C, and −41 °C were 45%, 36%, and 35%, respectively.

Fig. 2c–e show the GCD curves for cyclability tests conducted at different temperatures at 2 mA cm−2, 5 mA cm−2, and 10 mA cm−2, respectively. The fluctuations in the charging and discharging voltages were caused by temperature fluctuations in the freezers. As shown in the figures, ZABs using GPE-KOH cycled for 100 h with little performance degradation at 2 mA cm−2 and 5 mA cm−2 when tested at −41 °C, and at 10 mA cm−2 when tested at −28 °C, demonstrating excellent cyclability at low temperatures. The initial and final battery efficiencies for different test conditions are shown in Table S2.† The battery efficiency decreased with decreasing temperature for each current density, which is attributed to a decrease in ionic conductivity and electrochemical reaction kinetics. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the ZAB with GPE-KOH could operate at −41 °C and 10 mA cm−2 but the charging voltage increased slightly during the test, which indicated poorer stability under these conditions. This instability may be responsible for the failure of the battery in the cyclability test conducted under the same conditions.
Since the degradation in battery performance was not severe when tested at 10 mA cm−2 and 21 °C, an extended cyclability test was performed (Fig. 2f) using GPE-KOH to reveal the lifetime of the ZAB. As shown in Fig. S4b,† the ZAB using GPE-KOH was cycled for 260 h before experiencing accelerated degradation in discharging performance. Degradation after cycling is attributed to the air electrode substrate. The air electrode lost its rigidity and the two layers (i.e., macroporous backing layer and microporous layer) of the GDL were easily separated after cycling. The initial battery efficiency was 61% and the battery efficiency after 260 h was 42%. Even though the efficiency decreased during cycling, the battery still had not failed after 260 h.
Electrochemical performance of ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI
Initially, a GDL with (Co,Fe)3O4 decorated N-CNTs as the air electrode was used with aqueous 6 M KOH + 2 M KI + 0.4 M ZnO. As shown in Fig. S5a,† the cyclability of this configuration was poor. The air electrode was changed to carbon cloth (CC) coated with Pt/RuO2. The selection of this catalyst was based on recent literature, where Pt-based catalysts were utilized at the air electrode for electrolytes containing KI.35,47,50 Zhao et al. reported that Pt/C is capable of catalyzing both the oxidation and reduction reactions.51 Other test conditions and the battery configuration were the same as those for ZABs using GPE-KOH. Fig. 3a shows rate tests for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI under different test conditions. Table S3† summarizes battery efficiencies as well as peak power densities for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI under different conditions. Battery efficiencies and power densities decreased with a decrease in temperature, due to reduced reaction kinetics and lower ionic conductivity. Table S4† summarizes the improvement in battery efficiency when compared with ZABs using GPE-KOH. Fig. S3c† shows a comparison of rate test results obtained using GPE-KOH with different air electrodes. As exhibited in the figure, the ZAB using GPE-KOH with a (Co,Fe)3O4 coated GDL had better performance at all current densities. Therefore, battery efficiency improvement calculations were performed based on the results obtained using (Co,Fe)3O4 coated GDLs. Fig. S6† shows comparisons of rate test results obtained using GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI. The charging voltage is significantly reduced with the addition of KI, leading to battery efficiency improvement. With the change in the charging reaction from the traditional OER to the oxidation of I− to IO3−, battery efficiencies are greatly improved because of a reduction in the charging voltage. When tested at 21 °C and 20 mA cm−2, the charging voltage dropped from 2.0 V to 1.7 V (15% improvement). However, the ZAB using GPE-KOH-KI had a lower battery efficiency when tested at −41 °C and 10 mA cm−2, due to the much lower discharging voltage. The peak power densities for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI are also smaller than those for ZABs using GPE-KOH.

(f) Optical images of pieces of Zn foil after cycling for 100 h at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2 using GPE-KOH-KI (left) and cycling for 144 h at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2 using GPE-KOH (right). 

Fig. 3c–e show GCD curves of cyclability tests for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI. Similar to the GCD curves for the cyclability tests for ZABs using GPE-KOH, there are fluctuations in the discharge and charge voltages when tested at low temperatures due to temperature fluctuations inside the freezers. Table S5† summarizes the initial and final efficiencies of the cyclability tests for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI. When cycled at 2 cm−2 and 5 mA cm−2, the ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI demonstrated excellent battery cyclability (100 h for both current densities) at all temperatures with impressive initial (77% and 74%, respectively) and final (73% and 66%, respectively) battery efficiencies at 21 °C. Table S6† shows a summary of battery efficiency improvement for ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI compared with ZABs using GPE-KOH. Fig. S7–S9† show comparisons of the cyclability test results. The efficiency improvement is reflected by the greatly reduced charging voltage in the figures. When tested at 2 mA cm−2 and 5 mA cm−2, the improvement in the initial battery efficiency was between 13% and 33%, and 8% to 36% for the final battery efficiency. However, when cycled at 10 mA cm−2, the cyclability of ZABs using GPE-KOH-KI was not as good as that of ZABs using GPE-KOH. The ZAB using GPE-KOH-KI cycled for 72 h at −28 °C before battery failure, whereas the ZAB using GPE-KOH cycled for 100 h under the same test conditions. Moreover, the difference in the initial and final battery efficiency when tested at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2 was much larger (nearly 20%) for the ZAB using GPE-KOH-KI than for the ZAB using GPE-KOH (10%). The poorer battery cyclability at 10 mA cm−2 for GPE-KOH-KI is attributed to passivation at the Zn electrode. Fig. 3f shows an optical image comparing a Zn electrode cycled for 100 h at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2 using GPE-KOH-KI and a Zn electrode cycled for 144 h under the same conditions using GPE-KOH. The surface of the Zn electrode obtained from the test using GPE-KOH is much smoother than the one obtained from the test using GPE-KOH-KI, even though the sample obtained using GPE-KOH was cycled for an additional 44 h. SEM and EDX spectroscopy were used to characterize the Zn electrode surface after cycling. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the Zn surface obtained using GPE-KOH-KI had large oxide particles (spectrum 2 in Fig. 4a and b) on the surface, whereas the sample obtained using GPE-KOH and cycled for 144 h had more metallic Zn exposed, with scattered small oxide particles (spectrum 5 in Fig. 4c and d) on the surface. XRD analysis was performed on the surface of pristine Zn foil and the surface of cycled Zn foil using GPE-KOH-KI. As shown in Fig. S9d,† the XRD patterns for both Zn samples have peaks corresponding to metallic Zn (PDF #00-004-0831). The cycled Zn foil has additional peaks which can be indexed to ZnO (PDF #01-079-5604). Therefore, the poorer cyclability of the battery using GPE-KOH-KI at 10 mA cm−2 was likely due to passivation, which formed an insulating ZnO layer on the Zn electrode that eventually made Zn dissolution and redeposition more difficult as cycling proceeded.

Table S7† shows comparisons of battery performance for GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI and the literature, where both GPEs have better battery performance relative to the competitors. When tested at 10 mA cm−2 and 21 °C, the ZAB using GPE-KOH was able to cycle for 260 h and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the best reported cycling performance using a GPE. Also, when cycled at 5 mA cm−2 and 21 °C, the ZAB using GPE-KOH-KI was able to cycle for 100 h and potentially longer, whereas the battery reported in ref. 47 used an aqueous electrolyte containing KI and was only able to cycle for 80 h. Tables S8 and S9† summarize the rate and cyclability performance of ZABs using GPE-KOH and GPE-KOH-KI, respectively, under different conditions.
Reaction mechanisms for ZABs using KI as an electrolyte additive
In previous work from the literature on ZABs utilizing KI as an additive to the electrolyte, Pt was used as the catalyst.35,36 It was hypothesized that Pt was essential for the reversal of IO3− to I−. Therefore, to investigate the reversibility of the I−/IO3− reaction, a Pt wire was used in a CV test with the cell setup shown in Fig. S2a.† The aqueous electrolyte had a concentration of 1 M KOH + 0.33 M KI to maintain a 3:1 KOH to KI ratio. As shown in Fig. 5a, with Pt wire as the working electrode, an oxidation peak (peak (1)) corresponding to the reaction from I− to I2 and two reduction peaks, corresponding to the reduction of IO3− to I− (peak (3)) and I2 to I− (peak (2)) are present. The oxidation step is believed to be an electrochemical–chemical step, where I− is first oxidized to I2 during an electrochemical reaction and then I2 disproportionates to IO3− and I− through a rapid chemical reaction since I2 is not stable in an alkaline environment.52 The proposed two-step reaction is shown below.

Electrochemical reaction: 6I− + 6e− → 3I2(6)
Chemical reaction: 3I2 + 6OH− → IO3− + 5I− + 3H2O(7)
The oxidation of I− has a much lower thermodynamic barrier than the conventional OER, which is the reason that the charging voltage is greatly reduced.35,36,51
The two reduction reactions are shown below.
Peak (2): I2 + 2e− → 2I−(8)
Peak (3): IO3− + 3H2O + 6e− → I− + 6OH−(9)
The reduction peak for I2 to I− is only observed at high scan rates as the reaction from I2 to I− is fast.52 The CV results suggest that the redox reaction of I−/IO3− is reversible when Pt is used as the catalyst.
To determine whether the reaction at the Zn electrode remains reversible after the addition of KI, a CV test on the Zn electrode was performed in different electrolytes using the setup shown in Fig. S2b.† As shown in Fig. 5b, when tested in 6 M KOH + 2 M KI + 0.4 M ZnO, an oxidation peak and a reduction peak appear at almost the same potential as for the electrolytes without KI. Therefore, the addition of KI does not negatively impact the Zn electrode reaction.
It is important to confirm whether IO3− converts back to I− during discharge to determine whether the battery is fully rechargeable. For this work, individual solutions of 0.012 mM KOH, 0.004 mM KI, and 0.00008 mM KIO3 were prepared to determine whether UV-vis measurements could be used to confirm the presence of IO3− and I− when they also coexist with OH− in the electrolyte. These concentrations were chosen to maintain the 3:1 KOH to KI ratio utilized in the battery tests and to ensure that the absorbance values for UV-vis testing were smaller than 1. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, only the KI solution had a peak between 220 nm and 230 nm; no peaks were observed at other wavelengths. The peak is, therefore, attributed to I−. UV-vis testing was also performed on a diluted KOH + KI + KIO3 solution and a peak, corresponding to I−, appeared in the 220 to 230 nm range. According to the proposed reactions shown in eqn (6)–(9), the concentration of I− is expected to decrease after charging the battery and to increase after discharging the battery. As illustrated in Fig. 5d, the absorbance of I− decreases after charging the half-cell in an aqueous electrolyte containing 6 M KOH + 2 M KI, which corresponds to the expected conversion from I− to IO3−. The three-electrode setup shown in Fig. S2a† was used for the charging reaction, while the setup shown in Fig. S10d† was used for the discharging reaction to prevent the reverse reaction shown in eqn (9) from happening at the carbon rod, which occurred when the setup shown in Fig. S2a† was utilized during discharge. Fig. 5e was plotted using the peak currents obtained from Fig. 5a. Fig. 5e shows that the peak currents for both the oxidation reaction from I− to I2 and the reduction reaction from IO3− to I− exhibit a linear relationship with the square root of the scan rate, which means that both reactions are limited by diffusion.53 Therefore, the concentration of KI needs to be sufficiently high to allow the conversion from I− to I2 to happen. Likewise, it is likely that the amount of KIO3 needs to be concentrated so that the conversion from IO3− to I− can occur. Since the I− concentration in the electrolyte is already high, such a conversion is difficult when considering Le Chatelier's principle. Therefore, the authors attempted to dissolve as much KIO3 as possible in a 6 M KOH + 2 M KI solution to confirm whether IO3− can be converted to I− during battery discharge when using carbon cloth with Pt/RuO2 as the working electrode. Fig. 5f shows an increase in absorbance for I− after discharging sample A (i.e., the starting solution), indicating the conversion from IO3− to I− during battery discharge. Fig. S10a† shows a linear relationship between the absorbance and I− concentration. With an increase of 0.001 mM in I− concentration, generated by the discharging reaction, the absorbance is expected to increase by 0.017. Since the sample before discharge had an absorbance of 0.699, the absorbance of the discharged sample is expected to be 0.716 based on the quantity of KIO3 dissolved in sample A. The UV-vis measurement was performed three times (results shown in Fig. S10b†) on three post-discharge samples (obtained through three individual dilution processes) to minimize the error. The average absorbance for the post-discharge sample is 0.720, which is very close to the expected value (i.e., 0.716). Therefore, the UV-vis results confirm the conversion from IO3− to I− during battery discharge. However, Liu et al. conducted linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests with electrolytes containing KOH, KI, and KIO3, in both Ar- and O2-saturated environments, and confirmed the coexistence of the ORR and the reduction reaction of iodate during battery discharge.54 In an Ar-saturated environment, the ORR cannot occur and the non-zero current displayed during LSV is solely due to iodate reduction. However, with the introduction of O2, the current during LSV is increased substantially and is much higher than that in the Ar-saturated environment, demonstrating that an oxygen-dependant reaction (i.e., ORR) occurs during the discharge process and accounts for a majority of the observed current. For electrochemical testing at 2 mA cm−2 (Fig. S7†), the discharge voltage during cycling is almost the same for electrolytes with and without KI, which further supports that the ORR, and not the iodate reduction reaction, dominates the discharge process. In other cyclability tests at higher current densities (Fig. S8 and S9†), there is more variation in discharge voltages, but they are similar for both types of electrolytes. Therefore, even though the reduction reaction of iodate happens during battery discharge, it is likely that the ORR dominates the discharge process.
Conclusions
In summary, both gel polymer electrolytes without KI (GPE-KOH) and with KI (GPE-KOH-KI) demonstrated competitive battery performance at various current densities and temperatures. The addition of KI to the electrolyte changed the path of the charging reaction from the traditional oxygen evolution reaction to the oxidation reaction of I− to IO3−, which has a lower thermodynamic barrier. As such, the charging voltage was significantly reduced and this led to greatly improved battery efficiency. However, the cyclability of the battery using GPE-KOH-KI at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was not as good as that of the ZAB using GPE-KOH when tested at 21 °C. The ZAB using GPE-KOH was able to cycle for 260 h at 21 °C and 10 mA cm−2, whereas the ZAB using GPE-KOH-KI showed accelerated performance degradation after 90 h under the same test conditions. It is likely that the addition of KI to the electrolyte transformed the traditional ZAB into a battery where the discharging reaction at the air electrode is a combination of the oxygen reduction reaction and iodate reduction reaction. The addition of KI to the electrolyte for ZABs provides a new strategy in terms of designing ZABs.
