, Accepted 2nd June 2015First published on 2nd June 2015AbstractThree-dimensional spherical Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 microcrystallines were synthesized for the first time via a facile hydrothermal process without any oxychlorides at 100 °C. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern showed that the product corresponded to the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites. The combination of the product was further confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that the irregular shaped nanoblocks self-organized into spherical assemblies. The suitable temperature, the possible mechanistic pathway in the formation of the structures and the mechanisms are discussed. Moreover, the as-prepared materials also had an excellent visible light photoactivity for methyl orange (MO) degradation, and could remove 82.9% MO in 60 min.
1. Introduction
Over the past several years, due to the controllable size, various types of unique morphology and shape-dependent properties, materials with three-dimensional structures synthesized by large-scale self-assembly of micro- and nanostructured building components have become a hot topic of material preparation.1–8 With one-dimensional (1D) structure-based materials as building units, a variety of self-assembling morphologies such as dandelion-like,9 flower-like,10–12 urchin-like,13 peanut-like structures14 and tube-like structures15 have been reported. Most of these studies usually rely on spherical superstructures prepared with hydrothermal or solvothermal routes.9–12 However, due to the high temperature and surfactants, severe preparation conditions result in high production costs for the oriented growth of building units requirements. As a result, the development of mild and surfactant-free methods for preparing materials with three-dimensional spherical structures is necessary but remains a challenge.
The semiconductor composites synthesized by different metal compounds (such as ZnO/ZnS, SnS2/SnO2, CuO/CuS, BiOCl/BiOBr and Bi2S3/BiOCl) have been another hotspot in material preparation in recent years due to their outstanding physicochemical properties.16–19 For example, Lu et al. used a thermal evaporation process to synthesize ZnO/ZnS nanowire arrays which could be applied in electricity generation from mechanical energy.20 Zhang and co-workers successfully prepared SnS2/SnO2 nanoheterojunctions via a simple one-step hydrothermal method, and the photocatalytic efficiencies of the composites were higher than pure SnO2 and SnS2 nanoflakes at different dosages of photocatalysts.21 In addition, Bi2S3/BiOCl hybrid architectures with good visible light photocatalytic activity were also reported.22 Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3), another kind of semiconductor material, possesses high thermoelectric power and good photosensitivity.23 Owing to its suitable band gap (1.5–2.2 eV (ref. 24)) and wide solar spectrum, Sb2S3 has received significant attention for potential applications in solar energy conversion and optoelectronic materials.25–30 Sb2S3-based composites such as TiO2/Sb2S3 (ref. 25) and Ag/Sb2S3 (ref. 31) have been widely applied to synthesize various optical materials in the application of energy and environmental field. Nevertheless, so far very few researchers are focusing on the development of the synthesis of composites composed of Sb2S3 and antimony-based compounds.
Herein, a simple, mild and environmental (without any oxychlorides) hydrothermal method, based on the reactions of antimony trichloride and different dosages of sodium sulfide in water at 100 °C for 12 h, is employed for the synthesis of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 microspheres with building units of one-dimensional nanostructure-based blocks and rods. Indeed, Sb4O5Cl2, with a wide band gap of about 3.25 eV (the obtained result in this study), has matched band potentials with Sb2S3. What’s more, it’s easy to combine Sb2S3 with Sb4O5Cl2 since both are prepared in an acidic environment. Technically, this is the first time that Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites have been successfully synthesized. As an example of application, the prepared samples are also simply discussed as photocatalysts for the degradation of methyl orange (MO).
2. Experimental
The sample preparation, characterization and photocatalytic activity measurements are shown in the Experimental section in the ESI.† The molar ratio of SbCl3/Na2S was set to be 2:3, 1:1 and 2:1, and the corresponding products were denoted as C1, C2, and C3, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the as-obtained samples
The purity and crystallinity of the as-prepared samples were confirmed by XRD. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of pure Sb4O5Cl2. All the reflections of the sample crystals obtained are indexed to the structure of Sb4O5Cl2 (JCPDS files, no. 30-0091). The XRD patterns of the C1, C2 and C3 samples are also shown in Fig. 1a. All the diffraction peaks of Sb4O5Cl2 are present in the three samples. In addition, the main diffraction peaks of Sb2S3 (JCPDS files, no. 42-1393) are clearly found at 15.7° (020), 17.5° (120) and 32.3° (221). Remarkably, the XRD patterns of the C1 sample shows an interesting problem: the molar ratio of SbCl3/Na2S is set to be 2:3, but the as-prepared sample is not pure Sb2S3. Then an experiment was carried out in which an excess of Na2S was added, and the same result was also observed. The reasons have been investigated in the following section.

Important information on the surface electronic state and composition of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 was provided by XPS (Fig. S1†). The survey XPS spectrum (Fig. S1a†) reveals that the C2 composites are composed of Sb, O, Cl, and S, and the position of Sb 3d binding energy is superposed with that of the O 1s binding energy. Therefore, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Sb 3d (Fig. S1b†) was obtained to identify antimony chemical states. The two peaks at 529.3 eV and 538.4 eV correspond to the Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2, respectively, confirming the presence of Sb3+ cations.32 The high-resolution spectra of S 2p shows one peak at 161.7 eV, which is consistent with the results obtained in a previous study.33 In addition, the XPS signal of Cl 2p fitted with the peaks at binding energies of 198.3 eV and 200.1 eV. On the basis of the above discussion, the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites were successfully synthesized.
Fig. 1b and S3† show the general morphologies of the as-prepared C1, C2 and C3 samples. Interestingly, the composites crystallites self-organized into spherical assemblies, and the yield of the spheres is very high. In addition, the surface of the spherical particles reveals obvious edges and corners. The SEM images of the pure Sb4O5Cl2 samples are presented in Fig. 1c and S3d.† These spherical morphologies are irregular and flower-like. It is worth noting that the structure of pure Sb4O5Cl2 is significantly different to the composites, the components of which are of different shapes and a larger size (Fig. 1b and c). Moreover, the EDX spectrum of the C2 sample (Fig. 1d) shows the presence of Sb, O, S and Cl elements, and the molar ratio of Sb/S/Cl/O obtained from the peak area is 40.81:14.16:14.85:30.18 (the mass fraction of Sb2S3 is about 26.2%), confirming the successful combination of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 in the products.
In order to gain a deeper insight into the samples, a HRTEM image of C2 is provided. Two kinds of lattice fringes are obviously observed in Fig. S4a.† One is not well defined with an inter-layer distance (d-spacing) of around 0.146 nm, which corresponds to the (431) plane for Sb4O5Cl2. The other is ordered with a d-spacing of 0.363 nm, consistent with the (101) plane of the orthorhombic structured Sb2S3. The elemental mapping images further verify that the hybrid microspheres are composed of Cl, O, S and Sb, and the compositional distributions of all the elements are uniform (Fig. S4b–f†). These results demonstrate the heterogenous junction formation between the Sb2S3 and Sb4O5Cl2 architectures.
3.2 The effect factors for hybrid preparation
3.2.1 Temperatures. A temperature-dependent experiment has been conducted to explore the suitable temperature for the formation of the spherical structures of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2. The SEM images of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 synthesized by a hydrothermal method at different temperatures are presented in Fig. S5.† Fig. S5a† shows the SEM image of the obtained samples synthesized at 150 °C. Compared with the samples prepared at 100 °C, the spherical structure has become abnormal, and some of them are even broken. Furthermore, with an increase of the reaction temperature (200 °C), it can be clearly seen that the structure of the samples is converted into irregular microrods with different lengths and diameters (Fig. S5b†). These results indicate that the temperature plays a significant role in the synthesis of spherical structures.
3.2.2 pH. The pH value of the solution also exerts an important influence on the growth of the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 microcrystallines. Sb4O5Cl2 is not formed until the solution pH value is maintained at 1–2.34 On the contrary, no Sb2S3 deposition would be obtained for a high concentration, since they are dissolved out.5
3.2.3 A comparison before and after the hydrothermal reaction. For the purpose of further understanding the possible mechanism in the formation of the spherical Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites, the morphology of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 before and after the hydrothermal reaction was explored. The as-prepared solution turns from colorless to white when the SbCl3 and HCl mixture is added into the NaOH solution. It turns out that SbCl3 is strongly hydrolyzed to produce a white precipitate, suggesting the formation of Sb4O5Cl2. Then the mixture turns immediately from white to orange after the addition of Na2S solution, demonstrating that some Sb2S3 is successfully obtained. After 10 minutes of stirring, the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 precursors were collected and the morphology is presented in Fig. S6.† Apparently, there are some scattered abnormal spheres.Further observation shows that lots of coral-like amorphous nanoparticles have grown on the surface of the irregular spheres. The irregular spheres are Sb4O5Cl2, while the coral-like nanoparticles are Sb2S3, and the mechanism in the combination of the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites is an anion exchange strategy. However, before the addition of Na2S solution, trivalent antimony ions have cooperated compactly together to form three-dimensional structures of Sb4O5Cl2 in the process. Therefore, the S2− cannot be exchanged for the O2− and Cl− anions, and the pure Sb2S3 is not able to form even after adding an excess of Na2S. Moreover, after the hydrothermal reaction, the obtained regular spherical structure has been mentioned above (Fig. 1b and S3†). Thus, time-dependent experiments were developed to provide the assembly mechanism of the regular spheres. As shown in Fig. 2, for a reaction time of 3 h, a brush-like structure generating a curvature is readily formed. The bottom of brush-like microcrystallines is composed of amorphous nanoblocks derived from a three-dimensional framework Sb4O5Cl2 structure, and the surface is composed of irregular nanorods. In particular, the nanoblocks and nanorods are not isolated, which is attributed to the successful combination of the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites. With a longer reaction time, the brush-like Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 microcrystallines are gradually organized into unenclosed microspheres via the oriented attachment mechanism.9 The same irregular nanorods are observed in the interior of the microspheres, composed of building units of one-dimensional nanostructure-based blocks and rods. In fact, the three-dimensional framework structure, which is easily formed by the self-assembly of Sb4O5Cl2 crystallites at room temperature, is the foundation of synthesizing spherical Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites. Furthermore, three relevant chemical reactions for the synthesis of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 hybrid microcrystallines are proposed: 
4SbCl3 + 5H2O → Sb4O5Cl2 + 10HCl
(1) 
6S2− + Sb4O5Cl2 → 2Sb2S3 + 5O2− + 2Cl−
(2) 
nSb2S3 + mSb4O5Cl2 → Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 microcrystallines

3.2.4 The effect of hydrochloric acid or NaOH concentration. An idea of the formation mechanism of the three-dimensional framework Sb4O5Cl2 structure based on the effect of the concentration of hydrochloric acid or NaOH is established. Accordingly, one contrast experiment was undertaken in a different HCl concentration without adding NaOH, and another contrast experiment was carried out in the same HCl concentration without adding NaOH. Fig. S6† presents the general morphologies of the samples synthesized without NaOH, It shows that the samples prepared in different HCl concentrations are in the form of microrods, and no spheres can be found. However, for the samples prepared in the same HCl concentration, lots of nanorods appear with some olivary spheres (Fig. S6†). The results clarify that HCl concentration plays a vital role in the formation of the three-dimensional framework Sb4O5Cl2 structure. Three-dimensional Sb4O5Cl2 structures are formed under the action of a specific concentration of HCl and stirring. Effectively, NaOH is suitable for adjusting the HCl concentration in the mixture solution. Obviously, the morphology samples that resulted from the contrast trials are different from C1, C2 and C3 (Fig. S6 and S3†), supposing that NaOH also has a significant influence on the direction and size of crystal growth during the period of neutralization for sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid.
3.3 Mechanisms
On the basis of these experiments, the possible mechanistic pathway in the formation of spherical structures is illustrated in Fig. 3. Sb4O5Cl2 nanoparticles form at early stages, and then aggregate into nanoblocks and self-assemble into an abnormal three-dimensional structure. With the release of S2− from Na2S, a reaction with Sb4O5Cl2 by ion exchange leads to the combination of the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 microcrystallines. Finally, with the increase of reaction time, the microcrystallines gradually self-assemble into regular spheres. Besides, since no surfactants or emulsions are used, the geometrical shape of the building units must play a key role in the formation of the spherical structure.5

3.4 Optical properties and photocatalytic activity evaluation
The optical properties of the products were studied by UV-vis reflectance spectroscopy, and the corresponding UV-vis absorption spectrum of Sb4O5Cl2, C1, C2 and C3 are shown in Fig. 4a. Compared to Sb4O5Cl2, Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites exhibit a strong absorption in both the UV and visible range due to the introduced Sb2S3, suggesting that the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites are excited by visible light. It is well-known that the relationship between the absorption coefficient and the band gap energy of an indirect-gap semiconductor is described by the formula (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg), where α, ν, Eg and A are the absorption coefficient, light frequency, band gap energy, and a constant, respectively.12 Then the band gap values of the synthesized samples were calculated: the band gap energies of Sb4O5Cl2, C1, C2 and C3 are estimated to be 3.25, 2.6, 2.45, and 2.83 eV, respectively (Fig. S7†). Considering that the optical absorption is a noticeable factor of photocatalytic performance, the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 hybrids may be used as photocatalysts under visible light irradiation.
 Fig. 4  (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of different samples; (b) photocatalytic degradation of MO over different samples under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation. 
Further, the photocatalytic activity of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 was evaluated by the degradation of MO, a representative organic dyestuff. Fig. 4b presents the variation of the MO concentration (C/C0) as a function of the irradiation time over Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 photocatalysts. The dark experiment with no significant changes means that the adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved after 60 min stirring at dark. As a photocatalyst, Sb4O5Cl2 shows no photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MO because of its band gap energy. As shown in Fig. 4b, the degradation efficiency of the C1, C2 and C3 are 64.3%, 82.9%, and 56.2% respectively after 60 min, indicating that C2 has a higher catalytic activity than C1 and C3 under visible light, which is consistent with the results of the UV-vis reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 4a). However, the difference in the photocatalytic activity of different samples is based on many factors, including morphology, specific surface area, optical absorption, band gap, composition, crystallinity, etc. A systematic investigation should be carried out in future research. Most importantly, this Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composite also has great potential in the applications of photoelectric conversion and solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the spherical structure of Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composed of nanoblocks was synthesized for the first time by a facile hydrothermal route without any surfactants. The mechanism in the combination of the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 composites is an anion exchange strategy. The temperature and hydrochloric acid concentration played crucial roles in the formation of the spherical structures. Furthermore, the band gaps of the products were deduced from UV spectra, and the Sb2S3/Sb4O5Cl2 samples exhibited a suitable bad gap between 2.45 and 2.83 eV. The photocatalytic efficiency of the as-prepared material C2 for the degradation of MO can reach 82.9% after 60 min. It is believed that this composite may be a potential optoelectronic material.
