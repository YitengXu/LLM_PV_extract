In this study, an alkali metal salt solution was be used to modify the surface of the SnO2 electron transport layer to optimize electron transport. The I–V characteristic measurements and UV-Vis spectroscopy were used to investigate whether introducing the interface modification can increase the electron coupling and effectively extract the energy lever of electrons. The results indicated that the interfacial modification could reduce the trap density of states and increase the mobility of the SnO2 thin films. The efficient defect passivation significantly suppressed the recombination at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This method aims at passivation using simple and low-cost inorganic material poles.
1. Introduction
With the advent of the energy crisis, the proportion of renewable energy in the energy structure has been increasing. Because of its clean, convenient, and inexhaustible characteristics, solar energy has attracted the attention of numerous research institutions. Perovskite solar cells are one of the most attractive materials for the third-generation photovoltaic cells. Despite their advantages, the development and actual processing of these solar cells is limited by high cost and unfriendly environment. Therefore, the transformation of the perovskite batteries from laboratory to industrialization still needs efforts.1,2
Organic–inorganic lead perovskite halides (such as CH3NH3PbI3) have been used in solar cells because they have numerous functions such as strong light absorption, charge separation, and long-distance transmission of holes and electrons.3–8 In the past few years, the performance of the perovskite solar cells has been greatly improved due to improvements in interface engineering, shape control, equipment design and manufacturing.9–12
Organic solar cells have attracted extensive attention for many years due to their advantages of flexibility, low cost, and lightweight. Particularly in recent years, the perovskite solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid have developed rapidly. In a few years, the photoelectric conversion efficiency has exceeded 25%.13–16 Due to the low thermal stability and low formation energy of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, the ETL perovskite interface defects are one of the main composite materials, which may be related to the evaporation of the organic components from the surface during the thermal annealing process. SnO2 has appropriate energy levels, ideal bandgap, and high electron mobility, which will provide better optical stability and charge injection.17–21 SnO2 has become a promising metal oxide and can be used as an effective electron transport layer (ETL) in PSC. Liu et al.22 used inorganic binary alkaline halide in low-temperature-processed planar-structure perovskite solar cells. Moreover, it provided strong evidence that KCl, which remains at the interfacial functional layer, has effective defect passivation at the SnO2/perovskite interface.
In recent years, a large number of studies have shown that the alkali metal doping has a positive effect on the perovskite solar cells. However, the influence of alkali metals on the interface modification of the perovskite solar cells has not been systematically reported. In this study, we systematically studied the preparation of the perovskite solar cells with the SnO2 films being modified by alkali metal salt solutions as interface modifiers. The roughness and conductivity of the SnO2 films were improved. The interface modification of alkali metals improves the electrical properties of SnO2, which is beneficial to the extraction and transfer of electrons from perovskites.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Alfa Aesar provided SnO2 colloid precursor [Sn(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion], anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and chlorobenzene. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, methylammonium iodide (MAI), and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) were purchased from You Xuan Technology. PbI2 and spiro-OMeTAD were provided by Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP) was obtained from Aldrich. Shanghai Jufeng Chemical Technology Co. provided LiCl. NaCl and KCl were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. RbCl and CsCl were obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. All commercially available materials were used as received.
2.2 Material preparation
The SnO2 electron layer was fabricated by dissolving the SnO2 colloid precursor in deionized water in a volume ratio of 1:5. LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, and CsCl were dissolved in deionized water at 2 mg mL−1, respectively. By dissolving 1.2 M PbI2 in anhydrous DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v), a PbI2 solution was prepared. 60 mg MAI was dissolved in 1 mL of isopropanol. By dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL of CB, 17.5 μL of the Li-TFSI solution (520 mg in 1 mL ACN), and 28.8 μL of TBP, the spiro-OMeTAD solution was produced.
2.3 Device fabrication
The ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, and absolute ethanol for 15 minutes, followed by the flowing nitrogen gas to dry the glass. Then, the glass was irradiated with UV-Ozone for 15 min. After that, the SnO2 solution was spin-coated on the top of the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min. Then, LiCl, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, and CsCl solutions were spin-coated on the top of SnO2 at 5000 rpm for 20 s, respectively, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. PbI2 (1.2 M) was spin-coated on the top of SnO2 at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then the MAI solution was directly coated on the “wet” PbI2 layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. The spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 4500 rpm for 20 s to obtain the hole transporting layer. Finally, 80 nm of gold metal was thermally evaporated on the top of the device to form the back contact.
2.4 Characterization
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded using a ZEISS SUPRA55 microscope. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded using a 300HV scanning force microscope (SEIKO). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a Smart Lab from Rigaku using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). Related electrochemical tests were performed using a chi660d electrochemical station. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed in the wavelength range of 350 to 800 nm using a DK240 monochromator. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was measured using the FLS980 spectrometer (Edinburgh, England). The UV-vis light absorption measurement was performed by an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis-IR) spectrophotometer (Lambda 950).
3. Results and discussion
Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows a schematic of a two-step process for preparing a perovskite device. After spin-coating the electronic layer, a thin layer of alkali metal was spin-coated to make an interface modification.23,24 The device configuration of the obtained device is shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†). A thin alkali metal film was introduced onto the surface of SnO2. The section diagram of the device with the alkali metal interface layer is shown in Fig. S1c (ESI†). The structure of glass/ITO/SnO2/xCl/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au was obtained to validate the feasibility of using an alkali metal as a SnO2 interface layer.
The morphology of the SnO2 films, with and without interface treatments, was studied via SEM and AFM. Fig. 1(a)–(f) shows the SEM images before and after spinning the LiCl/NaCl/KCl/RbCl/CsCl solution, in which it is clear that there was no obvious crystalline or other similar morphology on the substrate after the alkali metal halide deposition process, thus confirming the amorphous nature of the passivation layer. Fig. 1(g)–(l) shows the AFM images of the SnO2 films after different interface treatments. It can be seen that the surface roughness (Rq) of the SnO2 films based on SnO2, SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, SnO2/KCl, SnO2/RbCl, and SnO2/CsCl were 2.85 nm, 2.39 nm, 2.35 nm, 2.44 nm, 3.04 nm, and 2.37 nm, respectively. In addition to the higher roughness of the SnO2/RbCl film, the roughness of the other interface treated films was lower than that of the untreated film. Lower roughness reduces electrical resistance and facilitates electron transport.

XRD was used for studying the influence of the underlying passivation layer on the composition and quality of the perovskite films. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of the perovskite films based on SnO2, SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, SnO2/KCl, SnO2/RbCl, and SnO2/CsCl. As shown in the figure, all of the passivated samples had nearly identical patterns, indicating the formation of a similar black perovskite phase. No systematic peak shifts relative to the control sample were observed, indicating the identical crystal structure of the perovskite.

To understand the effect of the interface processing on the optical properties of the perovskite film, an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrum was measured, as shown in Fig. 3a. After the interface treatment of the SnO2 film, the perovskite film shows strong absorption in the entire light absorption range, and the absorption edge was red-shifted, thereby ensuring that the perovskite can capture the low-energy photons. This was attributed to an increase in the grain size and a decrease in the reflectance.25 In order to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the interfacial modification of the alkali metal cation on the bandgap of the perovskite materials, the bandgap was calculated from the Tauc curve. The bandgaps of the perovskite films based on the pristine SnO2, SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, SnO2/KCl, SnO2/RbCl, and SnO2/CsCl are shown in Fig. 3b, and no significant changes in the bandgap are observed.

(f) The EQE curves of pristine SnO2, SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, SnO2/KCl, SnO2/RbCl, and SnO2/CsCl. 

Fig. 3c shows the transmission of the SnO2 film based on the pristine SnO2, SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, SnO2/KCl, SnO2/RbCl, and SnO2/CsCl. The interfacial treatment of the alkali metal reduced the transmittance of the film in the ultraviolet region, particularly in the wavelength range of 350–450 nm and 400–500 nm. The figure also indicates that the interface treatment improved the UV absorption capacity of the film.
The charge transfer behavior at the interface between ETL and perovskite was further analyzed via the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) quenching of perovskites. Fig. 3d shows the PL spectrum of the perovskite films based on the pristine SnO2, SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, SnO2/KCl, SnO2/RbCl, and SnO2/CsCl. Fluorescence emission of the perovskite is observed at 770 nm. It should be noted that when LiCl and NaCl were used for the interface treatment, the PL strength of the perovskite significantly reduced after the interface treatment, and the perovskite film showed significant PL quenching.26,27 Therefore, it was apparent that after the interface treatment of the SnO2 film, the efficiency of extracting charges from perovskite before recombination at the interface was improved, and the trap state density was lowered.
In order to better characterize the effect of the interface modification on the properties of the SnO2 films, the I–V characteristics were studied, as shown in Fig. 3e. The SnO2 and SnO2/xCl films were measured using ITO/SnO2/xCl/Au and ITO/SnO2/Au sandwich structures. An increase in current in the membrane after the modification by the interface can be observed. The direct current conductivity (σ0) can be calculated according to the formula I = σ0Ad−1V, where d is the thickness of the film, and A is the area of the film. The conductivity of the devices is shown in Table 1, indicating that the interface modification can increase the conductivity.28–30

Fig. 3f shows the EQE and integrated current density of the display device in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. The device was found to have similar spectral shapes. The highest value for the SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, and SnO2/KCl devices was above 90%, while the value for the pristine SnO2 device was only 89% at 520 nm. This is mainly because the transfer of Li+, Na+, and K+ between the perovskite layer and the interface layer enhance the charge collection and light collection capabilities, thereby enhancing the charge collection.
Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the steady-state power output measured at the maximum power. In addition to the device based on SnO2/CsCl, the photocurrent rose up and reached maximum very quickly after switching on the light. Under the bias voltage, the current of the SnO2/CsCl-based devices decreased rapidly.
In order to test the high repeatability of the device performance, Fig. 4 shown the statistics of PCE of 20 devices based on different interface treatments. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the Voc of SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, and SnO2/KCl devices were greatly improved. Devices based on SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, and SnO2/KCl showed a statistical reproducibility of 17.70 ± 0.63%, 18.29 ± 0.45%, and 18.13 ± 0.21%, respectively, compared to 17.30 ± 0.44% of the SnO2-based counterparts. Moreover, the superior average Voc of the devices using the NaCl passivation layer than other xCl suggests that there is an additional passivation effect from Na because both of them have the Cl component.

We also tested and calculated the photocurrent hysteresis of the devices. The J–V curves of the devices in different scanning directions are shown in Fig. 5, and the relevant J–V parameters are listed in Table 2. The hysteresis index was calculated by .31,32 The PCE of the SnO2-based device was 17.84% in the reverse J–V curve and 17.20% in the forward J–V curve, and the hysteresis index was 3.59%. The PCE of the SnO2/LiCl-based device in different scanning directions was 18.29% and 18.05%, and the hysteresis index was 1.31%. The PCE of the SnO2/NaCl-based device in different scanning directions was 18.53% and 18.12%, and the hysteresis index was 2.21%. The PCE of the SnO2/KCl-based device in different scanning directions was 18.67% and 18.34%, and the hysteresis index was 1.77%. The PCE of the SnO2/RbCl-based device in different scanning directions was 17.85% and 17.20%, and the hysteresis index was 3.64%. The PCE of the SnO2/CsCl-based device in different scanning directions was 17.73% and 17.02%, and the hysteresis index was 4.00%. Due to the passivation of xCl at the interface, the recombination of the SnO2/perovskite interface was suppressed, thereby reducing the device-based hysteresis.

After the interface modification, the average PCE showed a significant improvement. In order to study the long-term stability of battery devices, the storage stability was tested for 40 days under dry conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that there was a PCE rising process in three days, which was mainly caused by the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD and the integration of interface. Obviously, after 40 days of storage, the devices based on SnO2/NaCl showed excellent stability. Such excellent ambient air stability can be attributed to large grain size and high crystallinity.

4. Conclusion
SnO2/xCl ETL was prepared for planar PSC. The performance of devices based on SnO2/LiCl, SnO2/NaCl, and SnO2/KCl was found to improve. In addition, the introduction of an alkali metal can reduce the trap state density and increase the mobility in the SnO2 film. Compared with the SnO2 device, the SnO2/xCl device had better stability and repeatability and maintained more than 90% of the initial PCE after 40 days of storage in dark and dry conditions based on the SnO2/NaCl device. In summary, we showed that the interface modification of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells by inorganic binary alkaline halides is a simple and low-cost passivation approach to remarkably enhance the efficiency and stability of devices, and also remove the hysteresis.
