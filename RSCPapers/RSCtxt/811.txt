    , Accepted 5th May 2016First published on 5th May 2016AbstractCompared to organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites, full inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) exhibit higher stability. In this study, full inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Br, I and mixed halide systems Br/I) perovskite QDs have been synthesized and interestingly, these QDs showed highly polarized photoluminescence which is systematically studied for the first time. Furthermore, the polarization of CsPbI3 was as high as 0.36 in hexane and 0.40 as a film. The CsPbX3 perovskite QDs with high polarization properties indicate that they possess great potential for application in new generation displays with wide colour gamut and low power consumption.
1. Introduction
The emerging organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites,1–5 such as MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3; X = Cl, Br, I) QDs, have attracted much attention due to their excellent performance in solar cells6 and optical devices.7 Among these organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites, MAPbI3 has been studied extensively in the field of solar cells since 2009,8–13 and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has approached about 20% recently.14 On the other hand, owing to the wide wavelength tunability (400–800 nm) and narrow band emission with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of about 20 nm,10 organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered as the emissive component in phosphor-converted white-light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) and electroluminescence (EL) devices for high quality lighting and wide color gamut display.5,7,10,15 Compared to organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites, full inorganic perovskite QDs, such as CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), exhibit higher stability16 and provide superior photoelectric performance.17
In wide color gamut liquid crystal displays (LCDs) with quantum dot LEDs as backlight,18 besides a narrow FWHM, polarized emission is another important and key issue for the backlight source to achieve high system optical efficiency. More than half of unpolarized light will be absorbed and lost passing through the two orthogonal polarizers without a dual brightness enhancement film (DBEF) (i.e. lower cost).19,20 LCDs require a backlight source with narrow FWHM and strong polarized emission for wide color gamut and low power consumption displays.21 In addition to display applications, polarized emission with a precisely controlled peak wavelength has huge potential to be applied in ultra-sensitive photodetectors, information storage, etc.
In this study, we discovered that CsPbX3 perovskite QDs emit polarized light either in solution or in film without using an extra polarizer. We have synthesized CsPbX3 QDs (X = Br, I and mixed halide systems Br/I) and they show wide wavelength tunability through compositional modulations (500–700 nm), a narrow FWHM of 24 nm and a high quantum yield (QY) of ∼70%. More interestingly, these QDs showed strong polarization properties and the polarization of CsPbI3 reached 0.36 in hexane and 0.40 in film. As far as we know, firstly the polarization properties of CsPbX3 perovskites have been observed and studied systematically in this paper. These perovskites possess the potential to be applied in LCD backlight units as polarized emission sources directly for high color-gamut and low power consumption displays.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Most chemicals used in the experiments including Cs2CO3 (99.99%), octadecene (ODE, 90%), oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OLA, 70%), PbI2 (99.999%) and PbBr2 (99.999%) were purchased from Aladdin. n-Hexane (>97.0%) was purchased from Lingfeng Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). All solvents and reagents were of analytical grade and directly used without further purification.

Instrument. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Advance D8 Ew, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The operation voltage and current were 40 kV and 25 mA, respectively. The 2θ range was from 10° to 60° in steps of 0.02°. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. UV–vis absorption spectra and florescence spectra were recorded on a PERSEE TU-1901 spectrophotometer and a Gilden Photonics fluoroSENS spectrofluorometer, respectively. Freshly prepared samples in 1 cm quartz cells were used to perform all UV–vis absorption and emission measurements.

2.2 Preparation of Cs-oleate
The preparation process is similar to the previous report by L. Protesescu et al.22 with slight revision here. Typically, 0.0814 g Cs2CO3 was loaded into a 25 mL 3-neck flask along with 4 mL octadecene, and 0.25 mL OA, dried for 1 h at 120 °C, and then heated under inert argon gas to 150 °C until all Cs2CO3 reacted with OA.
2.3 Synthesis of CsPbX3 QDs
Firstly, 5 mL ODE, PbX2 (0.188 mmol) such as 0.087 g PbI2, 0.069 g PbBr2, 0.5 mL dried OLA and 0.5 mL dried OA were loaded into a 25 mL 3-neck flask. They were heated under vacuum for 30 min at 50 °C and then heated to 120 °C for 1 h. And then the temperature was raised to 180 °C and Cs-oleate solution (0.4 mL, prepared as described above and preheated before injection) was quickly injected. After 5 s, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath to room temperature. The color of the reaction solution changed quickly (yellow-green for CsPbBr3 and crimson for CsPbI3). The crude solutions were separated by centrifugation. The obtained supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was dissolved in hexane to obtain a stable colloidal QD solution of CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3. The synthesis of CsPbX3 QDs possesses the advantages of low preparation cost and easy processing.
2.4 Synthesis of the mixed CsPbBr3−xIx QDs
Firstly, ODE (5 mL), mixture reagents (PbI2 and PbBr2) with different mole ratios, dried OLA (0.5 mL) and dried OA (0.5 mL) were loaded into a 25 mL 3-neck flask. They were heated under vacuum for 30 min at 50 °C and then heated to 120 °C for 1 h. And then the temperature was raised to 180 °C and Cs-oleate solution (0.4 mL, prepared as described above and preheated before injection) was quickly injected and, 5 s later, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath to room temperature. The crude solutions were separated by centrifugation and the precipitate was dissolved in hexane.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and structure of the CsPbX3 QDs
The synthesis of CsPbX3 QDs was performed under water-free and oxygen-free conditions. Color changes were observed rapidly after the injection of the Cs-oleate precursor into PbX2 salt solution (yellow-green for CsPbBr3 and crimson for CsPbI3 shown in Fig. 1). A mixed halide perovskite CsPbBr3−xIx was prepared by the same process, except that appropriate mole ratios of the PbBr2 and PbI2 salts were used instead.
 Fig. 1  The synthesis schematic of CsPbX3 QDs. 
TEM and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to detect morphologies and elemental content of CsPbX3 perovskites. The size of CsPbBr3 QDs is 17 ± 0.10 nm seen from Fig. 2a and b and the inset in the top-right is the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of CsPbBr3 QDs. The characteristic diffraction points confirm that the structure of CsPbBr3 QDs belongs to the single crystal cubic phase. The size of CsPbBr1.5I1.5 QDs gets slightly larger than that of CsPbBr3 and crystal defects could be observed from the irregular diffraction points in SAED images shown in Fig. 2c and d. The CsPbI3 QDs have a similar tendency in the crystal structure shown in Fig. 2e and f. The diffraction images prove that the CsPbBr3 perovskite is of a single crystal structure corresponding to the perfect cubic phase and the other two samples have been deviated from the cubic phase.

XRD data in Fig. 3 confirm the changes of the crystal structure between the CsPbBr3 QDs and CsPbI3 QDs, in which the sample with a bigger iodine amount results in a shift moved to the small angle degree.16 In accordance with the TEM analysis, the CsPbBr3 perovskite belongs to the cubic crystal structure. Other samples, especially the CsPbI3 perovskite, are more or less deviated from the cubic phase. The EDS results show that the Br/Pb atom ratio of CsPbBr3 QDs is 3.5, confirming the presence of the Br-rich surface (shown in Fig. S1†) in good agreement with the literature.10,23,24 The Br/I atom ratio is 1.3 for the CsPbBr1.5I1.5 QDs, almost consistent with the stoichiometry.

3.2 Optical properties of the CsPbX3 perovskite
Fig. S2† shows the UV/vis absorption spectra of the CsPbX3 perovskite in hexane solution. It can be seen that the absorption spectra of samples with higher bromine composition stay slightly blue-shifted.
The PL emission spectra of the CsPbX3 perovskite depend on the compositional modulations (different ratios of the PbX2 salt). Fig. 4a shows the optical images of the CsPbX3 samples under UV light (λex = 365 nm) while Fig. 4b shows the PL emission spectra of the perovskites in hexane solution (λex = 450 nm). For example, the maximum PL emission peak is at 517 nm at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm for the CsPbBr3 perovskite, whereas it is at 700 nm for the CsPbI3 perovskite. The PL emission spectra of other samples with different ratios of Br to I are distributed among 517–700 nm spreading from green light to red light. This confirms that the PL emission wavelength for CsPbX3 perovskites is controlled by composition modulations. On the basis of the reported studies,3,10,22 perovskites can be synthesized using the PbCl2 salt to obtain blue PL emission. Thus, the perovskite quantum dots exhibit compositional-tunability through the entire visible spectral region of 410–700 nm. Detailed information on the perovskite samples is provided in Table S2† including the maximum PL emission wavelength, narrow FWHM and QY. The absolute QY of the CsPbI3 reached up to 70% using the integrating sphere method under excitation at 450 nm. For traditional nanoparticles, such as ZnO,25 comprehensive spectral studies are usually considered to be associated with the surface effect. The same is true for the perovskite QDs. According to the literature,24 halogen ions were found to be enriched on surfaces of CsPbX3 QDs, resulting in the self-passivation effect on defects, which would greatly reduce non-radiative trappers. It is one of the major reasons for achieving the unexpected outstanding luminescence properties of CsPbX3 QDs.

3.3 Polarization properties of the CsPbX3 perovskite
Surprisingly, the CsPbX3 QDs exhibited polarization properties despite being in hexane solution or in the film form. To our knowledge, the polarization properties have been studied systematically for the first time. The experimental setup is schematically depicted in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of the polarization experimental setup. We detected the polarized emission of the perovskite with collimation light, which has no polarization property. 
CsPbI3 in hexane can be taken as an example to illustrate the polarization properties of perovskites. The polarization of a light beam is as follows: P = (Imax − Imin)/(Imax + Imin)(1)where I is the intensity of polarized emission after passing through the polarizer.22 According to Fig. 6a, the change of intensity of the polarized emission is almost consistent with the sine function and the polarization is 0.36. Moreover, the polarization of CsPbI3 remained almost unchanged (about 0.34) after 15 days. Fig. 6b shows the polarization of all the samples in hexane. We can find that the increase of iodine amount helps improve the polarization of perovskites. Referring to the TEM images and XRD analysis in the last section, the CsPbBr3 perovskite belongs to the cubic crystal structure while CsPbI3 QDs are distorted from the cubic structure caused by bigger iodine atoms.4,10 The distorted cubic structure breaks the space inversion symmetry and the resulting asymmetrical structure26 would be responsible for the polarization properties of CsPbX3 perovskites. Another possible reason for the polarized emission is that CsPbX3 perovskites are highly ionized, which facilitates self-organization forming ordered packing structures in hexane.
 Fig. 6  (a) Polarization properties of the CsPbI3 perovskite in hexane; (b) polarization of all the perovskite samples in hexane. 
In an effort to investigate the effect of concentration on the polarization properties, a set of experiments using CsPbBr0.3I2.7 QDs at different volume concentrations was performed and the results are shown in Fig. 7 and Table S4,† giving positive results between polarization and concentration. Note that the last two samples of CsPbBr0.3I2.7 solution were highly diluted, which possibly contributed to the drastic reduction of PL intensity especially the 2nd peak of the sine function.

In addition to the solution, we have also tested the polarization properties of perovskites in the film form (Fig. 8, S4 and Table S5†). Fig. 8 shows the polarization spectra of the CsPbBr3 film and the CsPbI3 film. The polarization of the CsPbI3 film is as high as 0.40, which is slightly higher than that of CsPbI3 in hexane. The polarization properties of perovskites are related to the crystal structure and the degree of order among the perovskite quantum dots. But there is no polarized emission for the CsPbBr3 film at all. From Fig. 8, the 2nd peak is significantly lower than the 1st one, indicating a stability issue of the CsPbI3 film, which is much lower than the solution form.

There are some other well-known polarized-luminescence materials, such as quantum rods (QRs). Although the polarization of a single QR is able to reach as high as 0.75,27 the polarization of QR solution will dramatically decrease to less than 0.2 due to the random arrangement of quantum rods in solution. To realize polarized emission, QRs need to be aligned by electrospinning, photoinduced alignment, mechanical rubbing, etc. In this study, relatively strong polarization of CsPbX3 QDs has been achieved in hexane directly without further alignment processes. There are two major reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, the polarization is related to the crystal structure of the perovskite. The CsPbBr3 perovskite belongs to the cubic crystal structure while the CsPbI3 perovskite is distorted from the cubic structure caused by the bigger ionic radius of the iodine atom, which will induce the movement of ionic species.4,10,28 Moreover, many previous reports showed that the phenomenon of the movement of ionic species, especially halide ions, does exist in the perovskite structure and will induce a reaction towards the change of electronic charge distribution.28–32 It will break the space inversion symmetry under an electric field or the ‘built-in’ potential of CsPbX333 and produce the dipole moment (μa = μb ≠ μc)34 which is responsible for the polarization properties of CsPbX3 QDs. Secondly, it may be caused by the spatial arrangement and the degree of order among the individual nanoparticles.35 As we all know, the distribution of QDs is the random arrangement in solution and the average of polarization will be cancelled out. But for the CsPbX3 QDs, they are attracted to each other and uniformly aligned in a large area named a cluster and every cluster will result in polarization. The comparison of QD distribution in TEM is shown in Fig. S6.† The well-ordered assemblies of perovskite QDs could provide possibilities of polarization.36
A CIE chromaticity diagram (introduced by the Commission International de L'Eclairage) allows the comparison of the quality of colors by mapping colors visible to the human eye in terms of hue and saturation. Fig. 9 shows that the CsPbX3 QDs enjoy a wide color gamut with a narrow FWHM, that is a selected triangle of red, green, and blue emitting CsPbX3 QDs encompasses 103% for the Rec. 2020 standard and 138% for the NTSC standard.

4. Conclusions
In summary, full inorganic CsPbX3 perovskite QDs have been synthesized using inexpensive precursors. Moreover, the CsPbX3 QDs exhibit not only excellent photoluminescence but also highly polarized emission, which is systematically studied and reported for the first time. The polarization of CsPbI3 reached up to 0.36 in hexane and 0.40 in film. The highly polarized emission from CsPbX3 perovskites promised great potential for low power displays with wide color gamut.
