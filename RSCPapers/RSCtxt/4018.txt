    , Accepted 18th August 2014First published on 20th August 2014AbstractAn interpenetrating iodine-doped-Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 heterojunction network has been fabricated by controlling the crystallization of a chalcogenide glass. These two crystals absorb strongly and widely the solar spectrum for efficient charge photo-generation, and the heterojunction formed by these two crystals greatly promotes the charge separation. More importantly, these free charge carriers can be efficiently transported through the conductive channels formed by the oriented Cu2GeSe3 nanoparticles aggregated between the Sb2Se3 rods. The photo-electrochemical measurement shows that this structure results in a photocurrent of 74 μA cm−2 and a photo-current/dark-current ratio over 12 times at a bias voltage of −0.6 V and under an illumination of 250 W cm−2. This photocurrent is at least 100 times higher than any of these two crystals individually.
1. Introduction
Charge photo-generation, dissociation and transport to external collectors are the key steps for efficient conversion of solar energy into electrical or chemical energy via a photovoltaic effect or via a photocatalytic process. One single material cannot be optimum for all the three tasks. Organic solar cells have attracted much attention because of the low cost, flexibility and ease of processing. The introduction of internal donor–acceptor heterojunctions was a key breakthrough for improving the efficiency of polymer photovoltaic solar cells.1,2 The principle was to attribute one specific function (charge photo-generation or charge diffusion) to different molecules in order to overcome the mismatch between the exciton diffusion length (around 10 nm) and the optical absorption depth (more than 100 nm). In this way, each molecule can be optimized for a dedicated function.3,4 With the creation of an interpenetrating network, the carrier collection efficiency is improved by two orders of magnitude in comparison with bi-layer flat heterojunction devices.5–7
Recently, semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted considerable attention for potential application in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants or water splitting.8–10 A heterojunction structure has been extensively studied because of its efficiency for promoting the separation of photo-generated charge carriers.11–17 Especially for the nano-scale heterojunction with a narrow bandgap, it can not only efficiently inhibit the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs due to the size effect of particles and the intimate contact between heterophase nanoparticles,18 but also extend the absorption wavelength range to the visible region. Consequently, this kind of junctions has become a promising strategy for improving the visible light photocatalytic activity.
In this work, we present an original technique for preparing an efficient interpenetrating inorganic heterojunction structure with two relatively narrow bandgap semiconductors, Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3, by controlled crystallization of a precursor glass. These two crystals have a complementary direct bandgap of 1.0–1.2 eV for Sb2Se3 (ref. 19 and 20) and 0.78 eV for Cu2GeSe3,21 allowing efficient harvesting of solar energy from UV up to 1600 nm. Sb2Se3 has a high absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 and is considered as a promising semiconductor for building heterojunctions to potentially achieve high energy conversion efficiency.22 It has recently attracted more and more attention,23,24 but its low conductivity of 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1 (ref. 25) is certainly a big issue for charge transport which can be ensured by the Cu2GeSe3 phase with a conductivity of 101 Ω−1 cm−1.26 The structure of Sb2Se3 is orthorhombic with cell parameters a = 1.113 nm, b = 1.142 nm and c = 0.385 nm. It grows typically as rod-like crystals which can be easily interconnected.27 This is an important feature for building up an interconnected network. The structure of Cu2GeSe3 seems more diversified as cubic (a = 0.555 nm), tetragonal (a = 0.560 nm, b = 0.548 nm) and orthorhombic (a = 1.186 nm, b = 0.396 nm and c = 0.546 nm) phases are all reported.28,29 With our experimental conditions, only the cubic phase was precipitated.
Our first Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 heterojunctions were fabricated by chance when we studied the GeSe2–Sb2Se3 chalcogenide glasses for infrared transmission.30,31 Our unpublished works indicated that CuI can be introduced into these glasses in large quantity. Controlled crystallization of an optimized composition, 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI, leads to unusual optical absorption in the mid-infrared region (2–10 μm). Indeed, the absorption increases with increasing wavelength, indicating the existence of free charge carriers.32 A more detailed study has been then performed.
2. Structure characterization and photoelectric performance
The Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 interpenetration structures were fabricated by a typical synthesis procedure of the chalcogenide glass-ceramics: firstly, precursor glasses were prepared by the melt-quenching method; then the glasses were annealed between 260 and 284 °C, slightly above the glass-transition temperature, to realize controllable crystallization of the precursors (detailed information is provided in the Experimental section). As the best photoelectric performance was achieved in the glass-ceramics after annealing the glass 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI at 284 °C for 1 hour, the structure of these samples was studied in detail.
To characterize the photoelectric performance, the photo-electro-chemical (PEC) measurement has been carried out by using the classic 3-electrode method with a chopped illumination of 250 W m−2 from a broad band tungsten halogen lamp. For the optimized glass-ceramics, these measurements give a photocurrent of 74 μA cm−2 (at a bias voltage of −0.6 V versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode) as shown in Fig. 1b. The ratio of photocurrent over dark current is higher than 12 at the same bias voltage. The X-ray diffraction pattern of these samples is presented in Fig. 1a, showing that the crystallized phases created within the glass-ceramics are Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3 (Fig. 1a). These two crystals were therefore individually prepared. Their PEC results under the same measurement conditions are also presented in Fig. 1b for comparison. It can be obviously seen that these two crystalline single phases give negligible photocurrent, less than 1 μA cm−2. These results show the importance of coexistence of these two crystalline phases for generating strong photocurrent.

(a) XRD pattern of the glass-ceramic, giving the crystallized phases of cubic Cu2GeSe3 and orthorhombic Sb2Se3. (b) Results of PEC measurement under a chopped light source (250 W m−2) showing much more intense photocurrent in the glass-ceramic than in Cu2GeSe3 or Sb2Se3. 
The TEM bright field image reveals more information about the microstructure of the glass-ceramics (Fig. 2b). It shows that the obtained glass-ceramic contains micrometer-sized crystalline domains embedded inside the glassy matrix. These domains are composed of parallel nano-rods with a diameter of 10–30 nm. A careful study on the composition of the rod-like crystalline structure has been carried out using a STEM equipped with an EDS system. It can be clearly seen from the EDS elemental mappings that the Sb element is mainly enriched in the bright region on the rods, corresponding to the Sb2Se3 phase, whereas Cu and Ge elements mainly coexist in the dark region between the rods, corresponding to Cu2GeSe3 (Fig. 2c). Based on the above results, it can be confirmed that the crystalline domains are aggregates of Sb2Se3 nano-rods while the space between the rods is filled with Cu2GeSe3 crystallites (Fig. 2a).

(b) TEM bright field image of the glass-ceramic. (c) STEM image and EDS elemental mappings of the glass-ceramic, showing that the bright area is rich in Sb while the dark area is rich in Cu and Ge. 
From these results, it seems that iodine does not play any role in the photoelectric performance of the glass-ceramic. However, if the precursor glass does not contain any iodine, the photocurrent of the resulting glass-ceramic is very weak. A more detailed study on the crystallized phase has been performed. The results are summarized in Fig. 3. The EDS elemental mapping of the 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass-ceramic reveals that there exist two interconnected regions, including I and Sb rich regions, as well as Ge and Cu rich regions, whereas the Se element distributes throughout the sample. The overlap between Sb and I indicates the doping of I2− ions in the lattice of Sb2Se3, which is further confirmed by XRD. It can be seen that the introduction of CuI (above 20 mol%) into the base glass GeSe2–Sb2Se3 leads to an obvious shift of the main diffraction peak of Sb2Se3 (about 0.13°) toward a small angle. This can easily be understood since the ionic radius of I2− (2.2 Å) is larger than that of Se2− (1.9 Å). An excessive CuI content (30 mol%) may even induce the formation of SbSeI crystals.

With these results, we can conclude that crystalline phases are iodine-doped Sb2Se3 and cubic Cu2GeSe3. The remaining Ge, Se and I2 can form a stable glass and stay in the amorphous phase. The ternary Ge–Se–I system has a large glass-forming region and has already been studied many years ago.33,34
3. Origin of the improved photoelectric performance in the glass-ceramics
The above results indicate that the significant photocurrent enhancement in the glass-ceramic could be attributed to the nano-scale structure composed of iodine-doped Sb2Se3 nano-rods and Cu2GeSe3 crystallites. In this section, two aspects will be discussed in detail in order to better understand the origin of the improved performance in the glass-ceramics: the first one is the very significantly increasing electric conductivity, which greatly improves the mobility of the photo-generated carriers; the second one is the formation of bulk heterojunctions, which results in an efficient dissociation of the photo-generated carriers. The mechanism of the photoelectrical process in the glass-ceramics will then be proposed in the last part of this section.
3.1. Improved conductivity
A series of glass-ceramics have been prepared by annealing the precursor glass 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI for different durations at 260 °C (experimental optimized annealing temperature) to study the evolution of electric conductivity and photocurrent enhancement. The electrical conductivity and the photocurrent density of this series of materials have been measured in relation with the microstructure, as shown in Fig. 4. There is a clear correlation between the electric conductivity and the photocurrent intensity (Fig. 4a). The precursor glass without crystals does not show any measurable electric conductivity (<10−8 Ω−1 cm−1). We do not notice any improvement of conductivity in iodine-doped Sb2Se3. It is then clear that the conductivity of the glass-ceramics is due to the presence of the Cu2GeSe3 phase, which has a relatively high conductivity of 101 Ω−1 cm−1.26 The glass-ceramic annealed for 1 hour at 260 °C still shows pretty weak conductivity and photocurrent. Correspondingly, it is revealed by the SEM images that in this sample the Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 clusters are separately distributed in the glassy matrix (Fig. 4b), whereas in other samples with longer annealing durations (3–9 hours), the clusters are interconnected (Fig. 4c). Therefore it can be concluded that the interconnected Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 clusters form conductive channels which facilitate the transport of the photo-generated charge carriers.

(b) Glass-ceramic with a short annealing time of 1 h, containing isolated Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 clusters still with low conductivity, prepared from the glass 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI. (c) Glass-ceramic with a long annealing time of 3–9 h. The clusters are interconnected, as further shown in the HRTEM image (inset in Fig. 3c), increasing considerably the conductivity, prepared from the glass 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI. (d) Glass-ceramic containing conductive cubic Cu2GeSe3 which cannot be efficiently interconnected, leading to low conductivity and low photocurrent, prepared from the glass 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI. (e) XRD patterns of the glass-ceramics presented in (c) and (d), showing a higher fraction of Gu2GeSe3 in the glass-ceramic 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI than that in the glass-ceramic 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI. 
Glass-ceramics were also fabricated from the precursor glass with higher Ge content, such as 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI. According to XRD patterns (Fig. 4e), it can be seen that by increasing the Ge content in the precursor glass, the diffraction peaks of Cu2GeSe3 increase while those of Sb2Se3 decrease, indicating the increase of the fraction of Cu2GeSe3 and the decrease of the fraction of Sb2Se3. The ratio of the integral intensity of the strongest peak of Cu2GeSe3 (111) to the strongest peak of Sb2Se3 (221) is calculated. This ratio is 0.43 in the glass-ceramic 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI and increases to 5.0 in the glass-ceramic 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI.
As discussed above, the conductivity of the glass-ceramics is due to the presence of Cu2GeSe3. It is therefore expected that the glass-ceramic 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI has higher conductivity due to its higher ratio of Cu2GeSe3/Sb2Se3. However the conductivity and photocurrent are negligible in this sample. Because of the highly symmetric cubic structure and relatively low concentration of Cu, the Cu2GeSe3 phase alone cannot be interconnected efficiently in this sample (Fig. 4d). In contrast, in the glass-ceramic 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI, even though the percentage of Cu2GeSe3 is relatively low in the Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 clusters, Sb2Se3 has a rod-like structure that facilitates considerably its interconnection (Fig. 4c). These nano-rods act as a substrate for Cu2GeSe3 growth, leading to the formation of conductive channels throughout the glass-ceramic. As a result, the ratio of Cu2GeSe3/Sb2Se3 is not essential for conductivity. It is clear that the evident conductivity improvement is attributed to the interconnected Sb2Se3 nano-rod/Cu2GeSe3 crystallite clusters inside the glass-ceramic. It means that the order of crystallization plays an important role and it is important that the Sb2Se3 phase crystallizes first, to form the interconnected network, which is then covered by the conductive phase. This order is achieved in our case by selecting an appropriate precursor glass composition.
3.2. Formation of bulk heterojunction
The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image (Fig. 5) shows clearly a typical Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 interface. Our measurements, with a commercial PN tester, indicate that Cu2GeSe3 is a p-type semiconductor and iodine-doped Sb2Se3 is an n-type semiconductor. In order to confirm the existence of an internal heterojunction inside the glass-ceramics, the I–V characteristic of different samples has been measured with two silver or gold contacts sputtered on the surface (as shown in Fig. 5b). The ohmic character of the metallic contacts was preliminarily confirmed. The I–V curve clearly confirms the existence of heterojunctions which are randomly distributed inside the composite materials and are generally connected by the conductive channels discussed earlier. These heterojunctions can be simplified as two opposite junctions connected in parallel (Fig. 5c).
 Fig. 5  Nano-heterojunction structure and electronic properties. (a) HRTEM image showing the interfaces between n-type Sb2Se3 and p-type Cu2GeSe3 in the glass-ceramic. (b) I–V curve of the glass-ceramic showing a rectification behavior, indicating the existence of junctions. (c) Schematic illustration of the origin of the rectification characteristic. (d) Spatial distribution of the minority charge carrier lifetime over the surface of the glass-ceramic disk. A long average lifetime of 16.6 μs is associated with the efficient charge separation by heterojunctions. 
The existence of nano-junctions is of course extremely favorable for charge separation and this is probably one of the reasons why the composite materials show an extremely long lifetime of minority charge carriers of about 16 μs (Fig. 5d), compared for example to the well studied chalcopyrite CIGS with a lifetime typically shorter than 0.1 μs.14 The inhomogeneity of lifetime is associated with the composite character of the material with randomly distributed conductive channels which will be experimentally confirmed below.
3.3. Mechanism of the photoelectrical process
The detailed mechanism of charge photo-generation, separation and transport is illustrated in Fig. 6. Firstly, the Cu2GeSe3 nano-crystals grow on the surface of Sb2Se3 rods, leading to the formation of a semiconductor heterojunction between Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3. At the same time, the Cu2GeSe3 nano-crystals will connect to each other along the rod orientation, thereby forming such crystalline functional domains. The oriented and relatively conductive Cu2GeSe3 aggregates provide conductive micro-domains in the glass-ceramic. However, the conductivity of the glass-ceramics is determined not only by the formation of the conductive micro-domains but also by the interconnection of these conductive micro-domains at the macroscopic scale, finally forming the network (as shown in Fig. 4b and c). This network creates many conductive channels throughout the bulk, which correspond to the low surface potential regions in the AFM surface potential image (details provided in the ESI, especially Fig. S1 and S2†). Consequently, the likely photoelectric process can be proposed as follows: photons are efficiently and essentially absorbed by Sb2Se3 as well as by Cu2GeSe3, and then the heterojunction formed by n-type Sb2Se3 and p-type Cu2GeSe3 enhances the charge separation and the charge is efficiently collected by the network formed with interconnected rod-like Sb2Se3 crystals covered by conductive Cu2GeSe3. Therefore, the photo-generated carriers can be transported through the conductive channels to the back contact, and the charge collection ability is improved that is reflected by the significant enhancement of the photocurrent in the glass-ceramics.
 Fig. 6  Mechanisms of charge photo-generation, dissociation and transport in the photoelectric glass-ceramic. Photons are absorbed by Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3. The heterojunction formed by n-type Sb2Se3 and p-type Cu2GeSe3 enhances the charge separation and the charge is efficiently collected by the network formed with interconnected rod-like Sb2Se3 crystals covered by conductive Cu2GeSe3. This network creates conductive channels, as confirmed by the AFM surface potential image. 
4. Potential application for photocatalysis
The strong absorption of visible/near infrared light favours the photo-charge generation in these glass-ceramics under sunlight. This feature makes these glass-ceramics promising for visible photocatalysis. The visible photocatalytic activity of selected glass-ceramics has been evaluated by decomposing methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution under visible light illumination.

Fig. 7 illustrates the UV-visible absorption spectra of MO solutions photocatalytically degraded by the 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass-ceramic powders for different times. With the progress of the photocatalytic reaction, the absorption peaks of MO centred at 464 nm, 403 nm and 276 nm decrease gradually, and a new absorption peak ranging from 228 nm to 251 nm appears simultaneously, indicating that some intermediates may be generated. This new absorption peak can be deconvoluted into two peaks located at 228 nm and 251 nm, which probably correspond to 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid sodium and 4-dimethylaminophenol respectively.35 Detailed discussion on the pathways of MO photodegradation is provided in the ESI.†
 Fig. 7  UV-Vis absorption spectra of MO solutions before and after the photocatalytic reaction with the 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass-ceramic powders for different times. 

Fig. 8 shows the plots of ln(C0/Ct) versus photocatalytic reaction time for three photocatalysts: 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass powders, 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass-ceramic powders and the commercially available P25 TiO2 nano-powders. Here C0 is the initial concentration of the MO solution and Ct is the instantaneous concentration. All the reaction systems have the same condition, that is 0.1 g powders in 10 mL MO solution (10 mg L−1) under visible light illumination (>420 nm). The half-life τ1/2 of the photocatalytic degradation with the glass and glass-ceramic powders is 30 min and 14 min respectively. With P25 powders, the half-life is 121 min. It indicates that the visible photocatalytic ability of the glass and glass-ceramic powders is higher than P25 powders. This can be attributed to the narrow bandgap (1.4 eV for the glass) and strong visible absorption of the glass and glass-ceramic powders, leading to efficient photo-charge generation under visible light illumination. Additionally, it is found that the photocatalytic activity of the glass-ceramic powders is higher than that of the glass powders. This may be due to two reasons: the first one is the narrower bandgap of the glass-ceramics; the second one is the bulk heterojunction structure in the glass-ceramics. Considering the large particle size of the glass-ceramic powders between 20 μm and 30 μm, the photocatalytic activity of the glass-ceramic powders might be greatly improved by further decreasing the particle size.

5. Conclusion
We have demonstrated the feasibility of an interpenetrating heterojunction network in a purely inorganic composite material, by controlling the crystallization of a GeSe2–Ga2Se3–CuI glass. The network was formed by low conductive rod-like Sb2Se3 crystals, covered by highly conductive Cu2GeSe3 crystals. Sb2Se3 is efficient for charge photo-generation, the heterojunction formed by these two crystals greatly promotes the charge separation and Cu2GeSe3 plays the role of an efficient charge collector. This structure results in high photocurrent (at least 100 times higher than any of these two crystals individually) and an exceptionally long lifetime of charge carriers (around 16 μs). It has been demonstrated that the studied composite materials show great potential as efficient visible photocatalysts. This original technique for preparing an efficient interpenetrating inorganic heterojunction structure can also be used to fabricate optoelectronic devices so that much more materials, such as Sb2Se3, with many excellent features but low electrical conductivity can now be selected for these applications.
6. Experimental
6.1. Glass-ceramics
Precursor glass is prepared by using high purity polycrystalline germanium (99.999%), antimony (99.999%), selenium (99.999%) and copper iodide (98%) as raw materials. The glass with the composition of 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI was prepared by melting these raw materials in appropriate proportion, in a vacuum-sealed quartz tube of 9 mm inner diameter. The glass melting process is classic for the preparation of chalcogenide glasses. The mixture was heated up slowly to avoid overpressure in the quartz tube, to 800 °C at the rate of 1.5 °C min−1 in a rocking furnace and held for about 12 hours to ensure complete melting and thorough homogenization. The temperature was then cooled down to 700 °C that is slightly above the liquidus temperature of the melt, in order to decrease the vapour pressure over the melt for avoiding the formation of bubbles inside the glasses during the subsequent quenching in water at room temperature. In order to reduce the stress in the glass, the glass was annealed at 200 °C for 3 h. The glass was then cooled slowly and released from the silica tube. The obtained glass rod of 9 mm was sliced into discs with a thickness of about 1.5 mm for preparing glass-ceramics with heterojunctions by ceramisation slightly above the glass-transition temperature, i.e. 260–284°. The ceramisation process, designed for generating Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3 crystals simultaneously, was experimentally optimized.
6.2. Single polycrystalline phases
Polycrystalline Sb2Se3, iodine-doped Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3 are also synthesized by using these elements as starting materials in a sealed silica tube. The mixture was heated up to 100 °C above the melting temperature in a rocking furnace and held at that temperature for 10 hours before cooling down to room temperature in the furnace at a rate of 1° per minute.
6.3. Characterization
The samples were characterized by using the following equipment: differential scanning calorimeter DSC (TA Instruments, DSC Q20), X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, X'Pert Powder diffractometer), scanning electron microscope SEM (JOEL, JSM-6301F Scanning Microscope), high-resolution transmission electron microscope HRTEM (FEI Company, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN Transmission Electron Microscope), atomic force microscope AFM (NT-MDT company, NTEGRA Prima), and minority carrier lifetime (Semilab, WT-2000/2M). The conductivity type was checked with a Semilab PN tester PN-100. The electric conductivity was measured in the dark using the 4-probe method. To measure the current–voltage characteristics, two 1.8 mm metallic circle contacts were deposited on the same face for each sample by electron beam evaporation and their separation is 2.5 mm. The metallic contacts were in silver for the n-type sample or gold for the p-type to ensure ohmic contacts. Then the 2-point method was used to measure the I–V characteristics in the dark.
6.4. Photo-electrochemical measurement
To prepare working electrodes for PEC measurement, silver paint was homogeneously applied on one face of the φ 9 mm × 1.5 mm glass-ceramic discs, acting as a back contact. After linking the back contact layer with a copper wire, it was then covered by epoxy resin to be isolated from the solution during the PEC test. PEC properties were measured by using the 3-electrode method and the Ag/AgCl standard electrode was used as the reference electrode, Pt as the counter electrode and the sample as the working electrode. These three electrodes were put into the electrolyte (0.5 mol L−1 LiClO4 solution). A white light tungsten halogen lamp of 150 W with a power density of 250 W m−2 was used as a light source. An Autolab Metrohm potentiostat was used to record the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics under darkness and illumination. The result was analyzed using the NOVA software.
6.5. Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic activity of the selected glass-ceramics was evaluated by decomposing methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution under visible light illumination. A 35 W CDM-T Philips metal halide lamp with a 420 nm UV-cutoff filter was used as the visible light source. Prior to the test, a precise amount of glass-ceramic powders was dispersed into 10 mL MO solution by ultrasonic dispersion for 5 min. The suspension was then magnetically stirred in the dark for 1 h to reach an adsorption–desorption equilibrium of the solution before the photocatalytic reaction. The suspension was magnetically stirred throughout the process of reaction. When the reaction time was reached, the suspension was centrifuged (4000 rpm, 5 min) to remove the glass-ceramic particles from the solution. The resulting supernatant was analyzed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Lambda1050, PerkinElmer, USA) and the characteristic absorption peak of MO at 464 nm was used to determine the extent of its degradation.

(a) XRD pattern of the glass-ceramic, giving the crystallized phases of cubic Cu2GeSe3 and orthorhombic Sb2Se3. (b) Results of PEC measurement under a chopped light source (250 W m−2) showing much more intense photocurrent in the glass-ceramic than in Cu2GeSe3 or Sb2Se3.	 

 	Fig. 2  Microstructure of the 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass-ceramic. (a) Illustration of crystalline domains of the glass-ceramic, composed of parallel Sb2Se3 nano-rods and Cu2GeSe3 crystallites. (b) TEM bright field image of the glass-ceramic. (c) STEM image and EDS elemental mappings of the glass-ceramic, showing that the bright area is rich in Sb while the dark area is rich in Cu and Ge.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) STEM images and EDS elemental mapping of the 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI glass-ceramic, showing clearly the overlap of Sb and I, and (b) the XRD patterns of the glass-ceramics with different CuI contents, (i) 0%, (ii) 10%, (iii) 20%, and (iv) 30%.	 

 	Fig. 4  Structure-dependent conductivity of the glass-ceramics. (a) Correlation between the electric conductivity and the photocurrent of different glass-ceramics. (b) Glass-ceramic with a short annealing time of 1 h, containing isolated Sb2Se3/Cu2GeSe3 clusters still with low conductivity, prepared from the glass 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI. (c) Glass-ceramic with a long annealing time of 3–9 h. The clusters are interconnected, as further shown in the HRTEM image (inset in Fig. 3c), increasing considerably the conductivity, prepared from the glass 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI. (d) Glass-ceramic containing conductive cubic Cu2GeSe3 which cannot be efficiently interconnected, leading to low conductivity and low photocurrent, prepared from the glass 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI. (e) XRD patterns of the glass-ceramics presented in (c) and (d), showing a higher fraction of Gu2GeSe3 in the glass-ceramic 56GeSe2–24Sb2Se3–20CuI than that in the glass-ceramic 40GeSe2–40Sb2Se3–20CuI.	 

 	Fig. 5  Nano-heterojunction structure and electronic properties. (a) HRTEM image showing the interfaces between n-type Sb2Se3 and p-type Cu2GeSe3 in the glass-ceramic. (b) I–V curve of the glass-ceramic showing a rectification behavior, indicating the existence of junctions. (c) Schematic illustration of the origin of the rectification characteristic. (d) Spatial distribution of the minority charge carrier lifetime over the surface of the glass-ceramic disk. A long average lifetime of 16.6 μs is associated with the efficient charge separation by heterojunctions.	 

 	Fig. 6  Mechanisms of charge photo-generation, dissociation and transport in the photoelectric glass-ceramic. Photons are absorbed by Sb2Se3 and Cu2GeSe3. The heterojunction formed by n-type Sb2Se3 and p-type Cu2GeSe3 enhances the charge separation and the charge is efficiently collected by the network formed with interconnected rod-like Sb2Se3 crystals covered by conductive Cu2GeSe3. This network creates conductive channels, as confirmed by the AFM surface potential image.
