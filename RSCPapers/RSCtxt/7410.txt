, Accepted 24th August 2015First published on 4th September 2015AbstractIn this work, a two-step method of cold-press sintering–dealloying was applied to fabricate nanostructured copper/copper oxide mixtures. As-sintered AlxCu(100−x) (x = 60, 67 and 85 at%) alloy bulks that were prepared using cold-press sintering were dealloyed in 20 wt% NaOH solution under free corrosion conditions. In addition, Al67Cu33 was studied in detail to study the effects of sintering parameters on precursors and products. The XRD and SEM results suggest that a higher temperature and long duration are beneficial to promote atom diffusion and the formation of a single Al2Cu phase and tailored Cu, Cu2O and CuO with various morphologies were obtained after dealloying. During dealloying, the Al2Cu phase could be fully corroded, whereas the AlCu phase obtained from a higher sintering temperature remains after dealloying. Electrochemical studies show that the critical corrosion potential (Ecrit) of the as-sintered alloys, pure Al and pure Cu, are extremely close to the free corrosion potential (Ecorr), the intersection point of potentiodynamic cathodic and anodic polarization curves. Cyclic voltammetry results imply that the formation of oxides may be related to the reaction of dissolved oxygen and copper ions. A group of recommended parameters was identified: a pressure of 312.5 MPa, sintering temperature of 500 °C and holding time of 60 min, from which a mixture of Cu/Cu2O/CuO could be obtained which exhibits an excellent initial (10 min) degradation efficiency of 77.4% to methyl orange when exposed in an ultrasonic environment in ambient atmosphere.
1. Introduction
Recently, nanoscaled oxides have drawn extensive attention because of their potential applications in energy storage, switch devices and catalysis.1–8 In addition to Fe2O3, WO3, TiO2, etc., Cu2O has drawn considerable interest profiting from its potential applications in solar energy conversion and environmental protection, for example, in solar cells, gas sensors and photocatalysts.9–12 As a semiconductor, Cu2O has a band gap of about 2.0–2.2 eV, which can be excited with visible light and consequently contributes to the effective utilization of solar energy. In addition, Cu2O is nontoxic and inexpensive, so it is a promising alternate to other photocatalysts, such as TiO2, for the degradation of organic pollutants (e.g. methyl orange). Xu et al. firstly prepared single-crystal hollow cuprous oxide (Cu2O) spheres with glucose as the reducing agent and gelatin as the soft template.13 Di Li et al. developed a general and facile one-pot template-free hydrothermal strategy to synthesize metal oxide hollow spheres with unified morphologies.14 But the use of Cu2+ is not environmentally friendly in their methods and it makes sense to explore other methods to prepare Cu2O.
In the last decade, dealloying, a method of selective dissolution of the most chemically active metal atoms out of an alloy, is drawing increasing attention in directly and rapidly synthesizing nanoporous metals, alloys and oxides.15–19 As reported, nanostructured oxides of copper produced by dealloying have been extensively studied. Qin et al. adopted Al–Cu–Hf amorphous alloys as precursors and mixed Cu/Cu2O/CuO were synthesized through dealloying in acid solutions.20,21 Aburada et al.22 also produced hybrid Cu/Cu2O by dealloying an amorphous Al–Cu–Mg alloy in HCl solution. In addition, porous CuO nanoplates were also finally fabricated by dealloying an amorphous Al–Cu alloy film and during that period a Cu2O intermediate was found.23 Given the facts above, it appears that it is feasible to obtain nanostructured copper oxides through a dealloying method.
Up to now, dealloying precursors have been extensively studied. Generally, ultrathin ribbons (with a thickness of about tens of microns) obtained through a high-speed spinning alloy melt are mostly considered,24,25 as well as through a thin alloy leaf rolled from “hammering” ultrathin foils.26 Thin films prepared via plating or magnetron sputtering are also taken as dealloying precursors.23 However, their industrial applications would be limited because of the limits of the manufacturing features of thin ribbons or films. Bulk precursors, therefore, need to be studied.19,27 Like casting, sintering is also a powerful and well-developed method for preparing alloys.28–33 However, compared with widely studied ribbons and films, precursors prepared through a sintering method are still less studied.34,35
In this work, AlxCu(100−x) (x = 60, 67 and 85 at%) alloy precursors were prepared through cold-press sintering followed by dealloying in an alkali solution under free corrosion conditions. The effects of the sintering parameters on precursors (Al67Cu33) and products are studied in detail. Various products, including nanostructured Cu, Cu2O and CuO or a mixture of them with various morphologies were obtained by monitoring the sintering conditions. In addition, possible mechanisms of the formation of the oxides were also studied using electrochemical techniques. Moreover, catalytic degradation performance towards an organic pollutant, methyl orange, were evaluated and the proper parameters are recommended.
2. Experimental
Nanostructured materials were fabricated through a combined alloying–dealloying process. Precursors were alloyed through a method called cold-press sintering (cold means room temperature in sintering terms29,36,37). Specifically, first of all, raw Al and Cu powders (>99.8 wt%, ∼40 μm) with a nominal composition of AlxCu(100−x) (x = 60, 67 and 85 at%) were placed in a tubular furnace under flowing hydrogen gas at 200 °C for one hour to remove the oxide layer on the surface of the powders, followed by ball milling to mix well. During the 5 h mixing at an angular speed of 300 rpm, the argon atmosphere was controlled to prevent the re-oxidation of the powders which were blended with the help of corundum balls, with a mass ratio of the powder/ball of about 10/1 and 0.4 wt% zinc stearate working as the grinding agent. Thirdly, the well-mixed powders were filled in a stainless steel mould and pressed under a pressure of 500 MPa for 2 min at room temperature. Then, green compacts with thicknesses of ∼2 mm and diameters of 22 mm were obtained, which were successively sintered in a tubular furnace under a flowing argon atmosphere at 550 °C for 120 min to obtain the desired precursors. The as-obtained precursors were then dealloyed in a 20 wt% NaOH aqueous solution (which has a pH value of 14 and ∼8 mg L−1 dissolved oxygen (ref. 23)) under free corrosion conditions at room temperature. During the dealloying, hydrogen bubbles were observed because of the reaction of Al with the NaOH solution and the dealloying process did not stop until no obvious bubbles emerged. The products (which exist in the form of powders) in the bottom of the beaker were collected and rinsed with distilled water and dehydrated alcohol. Then the dry products were kept in a vacuum chamber for later characterization. According to a phase diagram,38 Al67Cu33 is expected to be composed of a single phase of Al2Cu and it was selected as the representative object to study the effects of the sintering parameters including the applied pressures, sintering temperature and sintering time on the morphologies and performance of the products, and the detailed results are shown in Table 1. For convenient description, the products that were obtained from Al60Cu40, Al67Cu33 and Al85Cu15 are named P1, P2 and P3, respectively, and those obtained from the dealloying of the Al67Cu33 alloys that were handled at different conditions are assigned as the sequence of their precursors as listed in Table 1.

The phases presented in the products were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE) with Cu Kα irradiation. The morphology and microstructure were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEIQUANTAFEG250) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental analyses. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and porous structure were evaluated using nitrogen adsorption–desorption at 70 K with a surface area and pore radius distribution apparatus (Quantachrome NOVA, America). A Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and the desorption branch of the isotherms were employed to calculate the pore size distribution.
Electrochemical experiments were carried out to study the electrochemical corrosion process under a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI 760D) at room temperature in a 20 wt% NaOH solution. The electrochemical cell consisted of a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. In addition, all alloys involved were sequentially ground with a series of SiC grit papers (400–2000 grade) to a smooth surface and then polished using 0.3 mm alumina paste to get a mirror-finish surface. All potentials mentioned are on the SCE scale unless otherwise stated.
Sonocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out to evaluate the catalytic performance of the as-prepared samples using an ultrasonic generator with a frequency of 40 kHz and an output power of 100 W in open air. Various amounts (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 g L−1) of sample 8 were added into a 50 mL methyl orange (MO) solution with a mass concentration of 10 mg L−1 to determine the optimum content of the catalyst. Then 20 mg (the optimum content, namely, 0.4 g L−1) of the catalysts of samples 1 to 9 were added into 50 mL of 10 mg L−1 methyl orange solutions to find out which sample gives the best performance. Before operating, all solutions were placed in the dark room for 30 min to achieve the adsorption equilibrium. During ultrasonic irradiation, a 5 mL aliquot of the turbid solution was removed every 10 min and was immediately centrifuged which ensured that a clear supernatant was obtained. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured using a UV-3200 spectrophotometer at the maximum absorption wavelength of 464 nm of methyl orange (see Fig. S1†). The degradation efficiency is calculated according to eqn (1), 
(1)where C0 and A0 are the initial concentration and absorbance of methyl orange at the maximum absorption wavelength of 464 nm, C and A are the instantaneous concentration and absorbance, respectively. At least three experiments were conducted for each sample to ensure a reasonable repeatability, then the measurement results were averaged and reported.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1a shows a prototypical SEM image of the as-sintered Al67Cu33 alloy. Obviously, the as-sintered alloy contains a great deal of irregular channels which may be caused by the expansion of the residual air existing in the Al–Cu powder compact gaps and the random diffusion of the atoms during sintering. The existence of the channels is favorable for the permeation of the NaOH solution and thus consequently accelerates the dealloying process. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns of the as-sintered Al–Cu alloys. The results reveal that Al60Cu40 contains Al2Cu and AlCu phases. The AlCu phase disappears when the content of Al increases to 67 at% and only Al2Cu can be detected. In addition to the Al2Cu phase, Al could also be examined because of the excess content of Al when the Al content rises to 85 at%. The phase components in the current alloys are consistent with the results published previously,19,24,27 suggesting that sintering with our applied parameters is feasible to prepare the precursors. The alloying process can be briefly accounted as follows: according to a previous study,31 during sintering, the diffusion in the reaction precipitates the first interphase (Al2Cu) between the Cu–Al particles at around 100 °C. With the increase in temperature, the atoms diffuse more severely and Al2Cu grows. When the temperature exceeds 500 °C, the amount of Al2Cu increases with the enhanced diffusion rate and a reversible eutectic reaction (Al + Al2Cu ↔ L) occurs when the temperature is about 540 °C. Various phases are obtained when their compositions are changed as detected. Obviously, however, the XRD characteristics of Al2Cu in Al85Cu15 are different from those in the Al67Cu33 and Al60Cu40 alloys although they all match a standard XRD pattern (PDF Card no. 25-0012). They share a common point around the sharp peak at around 2θ = 42.07°, suggesting that the corresponding (220) crystal faces are well-crystallized.39,40 The sharp peak at around 2θ = 20.619° indicates an orientated (110) crystal face in the Al60Cu40 and Al67Cu33 alloys and the tiny peak at the same position in Al85Cu15 suggests a poorly-crystallized crystal face.40,41 This is also true for the (402) face which corresponds to 2θ = 73.46°. In Al85Cu15 it is well-crystallized whereas the situation is the opposite in the Al60Cu40 and Al67Cu33 alloys. From the facts above, it appears that the orientated growth in different precursors with various components is obtained, and this phenomenon is probably due to the random diffusion of atoms during the sintering process.30,32,33,42

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the as-dealloyed Al–Cu alloys. Obviously, P2 and P3 share a similar characteristic XRD pattern and a mixture of Cu, Cu2O and CuO phases can be detected in both products. It should be pointed out that a well-crystallized (200) crystal face of Cu2O could be detected at around 2θ = 42.362° in P2, whereas the peak at around 2θ = 42.362° is not distinguishable in P3 (as marked by the dotted line). In addition, a relatively better-developed Cu phase (fcc) formed after dealloying the as-sintered Al85Cu15 alloy as indicated by the sharper peak at around 2θ = 43.316° which corresponds to a well-developed (111) face in P3 as compared to that in P2. As for P1, the Cu2O and AlCu phases were indexed and no Al2Cu was found. That is to say, the corrosion of the AlCu phase is dynamically unfavorable in this corrosion condition (the as-sintered Al60Cu40 immersed in 20 wt% NaOH) although it could be completely corroded as reported in previous papers.19,27 In addition, the dealloying of Al60Cu40 is about 60 h, longer than those of Al85Cu15 and Al67Cu33 (both are about 50 h). Based on the facts above, it therefore appears that the existence of Cu2O can always be identified when the as-sintered Al–Cu alloys are dealloyed. This phenomenon is different from Kou’s report in which Cu2O was formed when nanoporous copper was post-heated after dealloying.43 Moreover, the products vary when the content of Al increases from 60 at% to 85 at%.
 Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the as-dealloyed samples; P1–P3 represent the products that were obtained from dealloying Al60Cu40, Al67Cu33 and Al85Cu15 in 20 wt% NaOH solutions, respectively. 
Fig. 3 shows the microstructures of the as-dealloyed Al67Cu33 alloys after dealloying in 20 wt% NaOH solution. Fig. 3a and b show the microstructure of the P1 powder which is obtained from dealloying the Al60Cu40 alloy. Obviously, powders are composed of nanostructured particles with varying sizes from 50 to 200 nm. As shown in Fig. 3c, nanostructured particles and nanoplates are observed and are marked by dotted ellipses with letters A and B. The sizes of the nanoparticles and nanoplates are about 100 nm and 200 nm. Fig. 3d shows the side faces of the nanoplates and the average thickness of these nanoplates is about 50 nm. Based on the EDS elemental analysis (Fig. S2†) of the nanoparticles and nanoplates at site 1 and site 2 in Fig. 3c, only Cu and O are present and the atomic ratios of Cu/O are almost 2/1 and 1/1 (Table 2), respectively. The results are also in accordance with previous reports.20,23 Fig. 3e and f depict the morphologies of P3. Obviously, a nanocube with sizes ranging from 50–250 nm (Fig. 3e) and cap-like nanoplates with diameters ranging from 500 to 1000 nm (Fig. 3f) are observed and EDS results suggest that the nanocubes and nanoplates are Cu2O and CuO, respectively. Although the microstructures of P1, P2 and P3 are not akin to a porous structure as often seen during dealloying precious metal alloys,15,19 the gaps among the nanoparticles or (and) nanoplates develop in another form of porous channel. The characteristic hysteresis loop in the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves of P2 (as an example) in Fig. 4a suggests the nature of porous materials with a specific surface area of ∼26.4 m2 g−1 and a narrow pore size distribution mainly below 5 nm (Fig. 4b).

Fig. 5 illustrates the XRD results of the Al67Cu33 precursors that were processed at different conditions and the corresponding products obtained from immersing the precursors in the 20 wt% NaOH solution. When the sintering temperature was 400 °C for cases 3, 6 and 9, in which the sintering times are 30, 60 and 120 min, respectively, slight atom diffusion and surface diffusion are expected from Fig. 5a, especially for cases 3 and 6. When the sintering time increases to 120 min (case 9), sharper peaks belonging to the Al2Cu phase (PDF Card no. 89-1981) appear but it is clear that the Al and Cu phases can still be detected, meaning that not all of the raw Al and Cu atoms interact, even though the powders have suffered a 120 min sintering process. This finding proves the surface diffusion at relatively low temperatures mentioned above. In addition, AlCu phases (PDF Card no. 88-1713) are also detected in the three precursors (Fig. 5a) probably because of the raw AlCu on its way to the Al2Cu phase under such a low temperature of 400 °C (∼0.6 times that of the melting point of Al, even though this temperature is feasible theoretically) and short duration.30 Moreover, a small amount of Al4Cu9 may also be formed during this limited diffusion process although its diffraction was not detected. After immersing these three alloys in the 20 wt% NaOH solution, no Al peaks are detected as shown in Fig. 5d because of the reaction of Al and the NaOH solution. It is not surprising that Cu is detected not only because of the dealloying of the Al2Cu phase but also because of the existence of uninvolved copper during sintering which is inert in an alkaline solution. The Cu2O may come from the dealloying of the Al2Cu phase, similar to the phenomenon in P2. It is reported that the Al4Cu9 phase is less susceptible to an alkaline environment compared to an acid environment.35 Thus it is reasonable to recognize that Al4Cu9 would take up a higher proportion in the residue after the depletion of Al and Al2Cu and can consequently be detected as shown in Fig. 5d. When the temperature rises to 500 °C (cases 5, 8 and 2) no signal of Cu or Al is found as shown in Fig. 5b. Both the Al2Cu and AlCu phases are detected in precursor 5, and the occurrence of AlCu may be because of the inadequate diffusion when the green compact suffers a 30 minute sintering process. Maybe a longer sintering time is in favor of the diffusion of atoms and therefore, the AlCu phase (PDF Card no. 88-1713) gradually disappears as the sintering time increases and only Al2Cu (PDF Card no. 89-1981) is detected in precursor 2. A hypothesis is proposed that, however, maybe 120 minutes is still not enough to make all of the Al and Cu turn into Al2Cu. Namely, a small amount of AlCu still exists but cannot be detected, just like Al4Cu9 mentioned above. After dealloying, various products including Cu, Cu2O, CuO and AlCu are found as shown in Fig. 5d (products 5, 8 and 2). In product 8, a mixture of Cu, Cu2O, CuO is formed like P2. As for product 2 and 5, however, they are composed of Cu, Cu2O and AlCu which are not completely dealloyed. Theoretically, the AlCu phase could be fully corroded in alkali conditions as seen in previous reports19,27 and in our findings in products 3, 6 and 9, whereas it could not be fully corroded in cases 2 and 5 as shown in Fig. 5d. Maybe a higher sintering temperature (500 °C and 550 °C for case 7 in the following) makes a more complicated interaction between AlCu and Al2Cu so that AlCu corrodes dynamically slow and finally it remains in the products. The appearance of AlCu in product 2 indirectly verifies the hypothesis proposed above, suggesting that a 120 minute sintering process under 500 °C is indeed not enough to get a single Al2Cu phase. However, it should also be pointed out that AlCu in precursor 8 is not detected, in other words, they are dealloyed. It may be related to the sintering press. As reported,30,31,44 the density of green compacts can be affected by pressure and a low-density compact is more beneficial for a homogeneous sintering process. Compared with cases 2 and 5, the applied pressure in case 8 is the smallest and we assume that this low pressure may play an important role in the formation of CuO as well as the synergic corrosion of Al2Cu and AlCu. When the sintering temperature increases to 550 °C (cases 7, 1 and 4) the only phase detected in all the precursors is Al2Cu (PDF Card no. 25-0012). Apparently, the XRD patterns (Fig. 5c) of precursors 7, 1 and 4 are different from those (PDF Card no. 89-1981) of the other six precursors. This is mainly because of the higher sintering temperature (∼0.83 times of melting point of Al) which greatly contributes to the diffusion of the atoms during sintering as well as the eutectic reaction. In addition, due to the higher sintering temperature and the random diffusion, a severe thermal vibration of atoms is expected so that the atoms would deviate from the lattice position where they should stay. Namely, their crystalline structures would be affected and therefore it is not surprising that some crystal faces are well-crystallized and some are poorly-crystallized. That is why the characteristics of the peaks of (100), (200), (220), etc. vary from each other in precursors 7, 1 and 4 as shown in Fig. 5c. Products 7, 1 and 4 are quite similar (Fig. 5d, cases 7, 1 and 4), and a mix of Cu, Cu2O and CuO are formed. No AlCu (except for product 7, and the appearance of AlCu could be interpreted as the appearance of AlCu in product 2, indicating that a 30 minute sintering process under 550 °C is insufficient to obtain a single Al2Cu phase) or Al4Cu9 is found either. From the facts above, the precursors that were obtained from different conditions are different and so are their products.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of the Al67Cu33 precursors that were processed under the sintering temperature of 400 °C (a), 500 °C (b) and 550 °C (c) coupled with other conditions as listed in Table 1; (d) shows the XRD patterns of as-dealloyed products obtained from dealloying the corresponding precursors (Table 1) in the 20 wt% NaOH solution. 
Fig. 6 shows the morphologies of products 1–9. As a whole, it can be found that the morphology of each product varies from the others. Specifically, sample 1 is composed of a number of nanoplates forming nest-like structures with small pores (∼20 nm in diameter, Fig. 6a). Samples 2, 4, 5 and 6 are all made up of small particles packing in different patterns. Sample 2 is characterized by hierarchical structures with particles forming lower level pores on the ligaments (inset in Fig. 6b). Particles in Fig. 6d seem to exist in a form of layers while those in Fig. 6e tend to randomly pack and form larger pores as seen in these two photos. As for sample 6, more condensed masses composed of small nanoparticles are observed in Fig. 6f. In sample 7, the particles seem to melt and the edges are ambiguous and irregular (inset in Fig. 6g) but the units are bigger than the particles in samples 2 and 4–6. For the morphologies of samples 3 and 9, traditional ligament–channel structures are obtained as usually seen in previous reports45–48 (Fig. 6c and i). EDS results testify that the ligaments contain both Cu and O elements and their ratios are in accordance with that of Cu2O, implying a core/shell structure with Cu2O as the shell covering on the nanoporous copper ligaments (namely, cores) as reported by Kou and Jiang et al.43,48 As for product 8, two morphologies of nanoparticles with smaller particles covering them (Fig. 6h1) and nanoplates (Fig. 6h2) were found. In conclusion, taking the EDS analyses in to consideration, Cu2O is prone to exist in the from of particles (samples 2, 4 and 5–8) although thin nanoplates/films (samples 1, 3 and 9) are also observed. In addition, CuO nanoplates are only found in case 8, for which the sintering parameters are moderate.

In general, for crystalline X–Cu alloys (X = Al,24 Zn,49 Mg,50 etc.), with Cu (more noble element in Al–Cu systems) content less than the parting limits,16,51 when immersed in electrolyte solutions under free corrosion conditions the chemical dealloying process starts with the selective dissolution of the less noble Al, Zn, Mg, etc. atoms because of their low standard electrode potentials (−1.66 V, −0.763 V and −2.37 V vs. SHE for Al/Al3+, Zn/Zn2+ and Mg/Mg2+, respectively52), leaving more noble copper (0.337 V vs. SHE for Cu/Cu2+) atoms diffusing and agglomerating along the alloy/electrolyte interface and forming the ligament–channel structures.15,19,27,49 As for this work, a possible corrosion process is proposed as follows.
Before conducting electrochemical experiments, the structure of an orientated alloy, P2’s precursor, was studied by refining its XRD pattern. A TOPAS (TOtal PAttern Solution, Bruker Co.) program package is an effective tool to get an actual structure by refining an as-detected XRD pattern based on a standard crystallographic information file (CIF). Based on the data (herein, the XRD data and its corresponding structure are regarded as standards) reported by Meetsma et al.,53 P2’s precursor was then obtained. The as-refined and the standard structures are illustrated in Fig. 7 and their parameters are listed in Table 3. From the aspects of their parameters, they have the same space group of I4/mcm (140) and a similar lattice constant but the atomic coordinates (x, y, z) and numbers are quite different especially for copper atoms. Particularly, the z value of the coordinates of copper in the as-refined Al2Cu is about one half of that in the standard Al2Cu. Therefore, four copper atoms (Fig. 7d) could be observed on the unit cell edge along the z-axis in the as-refined Al2Cu while only two copper atoms are observed in the standard Al2Cu (Fig. 7c). Thereby it is not too difficult to understand why the copper number (28) in the as-refined Al2Cu is about thrice of that (10) in the standard Al2Cu. In addition, the ratio (1.75) of Cu/Al in the as-sintered alloy is about twice of that (0.83) in a standard alloy, indicating a copper-rich phase in the as-sintered alloys. Moreover, this phase segregation phenomenon may also occur in other sintered alloys.

Potentiodynamic polarization tests of precursors 1, 6 and 8 (examples of each sintering temperature), the as-cast Al67Cu33 alloy,19 Al slices and Cu slices (>99.8 wt% for both alloy slices) were respectively performed in a 20 wt% NaOH solution and the curves are shown in Fig. 8. According to basic electrochemical knowledge,52,54,55 the potential at which the corresponding current density is 1 mA cm−2 is considered as the critical corrosion potential (Ecrit). When the applied potential is smaller than a metal’s Ecrit, the metal is considered to corrode at quite a low rate. The Ecrit values of the test samples are shown in Fig. 8a. From the polarization curves, it can be seen that Cu has the largest Ecrit and is about 0.8 V and 1 V larger than the Ecrit of the as-cast Al67Cu33 and Al, respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization curves of precursors 1, 6 and 8 in the small current density region are not distinguishable and they have a similar Ecrit which is smaller than that of Al, merely 50 mV. Generally speaking, if an alloy’s Ecrit is bigger than that of its less noble component, the discrepancy between this rule and the factual Ecrit of the as-sintered alloys may result from the orientated growth and segregation in the alloys. In this work, the as-sintered alloys were freely immersed in a NaOH solution and a balance between the cathodic and anodic reactions were achieved at the condition that the cathodic current density value is equal to that of the anodic reaction.52 Therefore, a free corrosion potential (Ecorr) is obtained and is regarded as the potential at which the cathodic branch intersects with the anodic branch (Fig. 8b). Interestingly, from Fig. 8c, the polarization curve of Cu, a small difference of merely 30 mV is found between the Ecorr and Ecrit. In addition, the differences of the two potentials for other alloys and metals are also very small, ranging from 12 to 27 mV. Because of the extremely small differences, we assume that severe corrosion also occurs although the alloys experience a free corrosion. Therefore, the chemical dealloying of the as-sintered alloys happens at −1.45 V which is similar to the Ecorr of Al (as marked by the dotted line) as shown in Fig. 8b. It is noted that the difference between the Ecorr(as-sintered alloys) and Ecorr(Cu) is ∼1 V, therefore, the massive dissolution of copper in the as-sintered alloys is not likely to occur at −1.45 V. To further study their dealloying behavior, Al, Cu and precursor 8 were subjected to a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test around their Ecorr values. As shown in Fig. 8d, there are three reductive peaks (marked as A, B and C) in the reserve scanning for Cu and they can be associated with the reduction of Cu+ to Cu, Cu2+ to Cu+ and Cu2O to Cu,56 respectively. As for precursor 8, two reductive peaks are detected, marked as D and E. The peaks may be related to the reduction of copper ions rather than aluminum ions since no reductive peak is observed for Al as seen in Fig. 8d. As mentioned above, massive dissolution of copper is not likely to occur around the Ecorr value for the as-sintered alloys, the copper ions inferred from the CV curve may be ascribed to the interaction of a copper atom and the dissolved oxygen. As reported by Chen et al.,57 the oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte strongly adsorbs on the fresh copper surfaces and before the formation of Cu islands, the starting structure of NPC, by surface diffusion, the fresh Cu atoms on the corrosion front become copper ions, which react with the adsorbed O–O to form Cu2O which could be further oxidized to CuO. In addition, the characteristic reductive peaks for precursor 8 are also observed in previous reports,55,58 which imply the dissolution–redeposition process during dealloying.59 Maybe in this work the partial copper ions re-deposit to form copper and others may react with oxygen to form oxides as we detected.23,57 As far as the cathodic reaction is concerned, hydrogen bubbles evolve as we saw during dealloying. In basic solutions, the hydrogen evolution reaction is involved through which H2O is reduced to produce hydrogen and OH−.52 In addition, dissolved oxygen may also be involved but the oxygen reduction may be slow because the concentration of OH− is high in the present system. Reactions involved during dealloying are listed as follows:23,52,57,60 
Al + 3OH− → Al(OH)3 + 3e−
(2) 
Al(OH)3 + OH− → Al(OH)4

The sonocatalytic performance of products 1–9 towards methyl orange (MO) was investigated to identify an optimum group of sintering parameters. Because of the existence of the CuO phase, product 8 was selected as an example to recommend an optimal catalytic content. As shown in Fig. 9a, the degradation efficiencies of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 g L−1 are plotted. When no catalyst is added the degradation efficiencies at various periods remain steady at around 14%. It may be attributed to the formation of highly reactive ˙OH radicals which result from the hot spots (local high pressures and temperature) caused by the formation, growth and collapse of cavities during ultrasonic irradiation.61,62 However, as reported, the number of radical ˙OH generated by cavitation may be too low to be of practical use in degradation (14% as mentioned above) and the addition of a catalyst would create active sites and lead to the increase of ˙OH radicals which subsequently increase the degradation ability toward methyl orange.61 Therefore, as observed in Fig. 9a, efficiencies dramatically increase as soon as the catalysts are added and they increase with increasing catalyst content until the content reaches 0.4 g L−1, beyond which the efficiencies decrease. That may be because an excess of the catalyst may prevent the propagation of sound and finally cause the decline of degradation efficiencies.63 It should also be noted that a longer exposure time in an ultrasonic environment does not contribute to a bigger degradation efficiency. That may be because of the desorption of MO.64 In addition, a high efficiency of 77.4% at the 10th minute is obtained and is meaningful in a case where an urgent degradation is needed such as dye leakage. Other products (0.4 g L−1) were then studied to determine the optimal sintering parameters, as shown in Fig. 9b. Degradation efficiencies of samples 2 and 3 exceed 95% within 60 min but their initial performances are much poorer than that of sample 8. This may be ascribed to the existence of CuO. As reported previously, high energy light may also be generated using ultrasonic cavitation and could excite semiconductor oxides (Cu2O and CuO in this work) to generate holes and electrons as photocatalysts do.48 The smaller band gap of 1.2–1.9 eV of CuO than that (2.0–2.2 eV) of Cu2O could make CuO be more easily excited and consequently contributes to a high initial degradation efficiency for sample 8.65,66 As for sample 4, its performance is poorer, less than 30%, and it is even lower after 120 minutes. As for cases of 5 and 7, unexpected extremely low efficiencies of ∼4% are observed. The efficiencies are even smaller than in the case in which no catalyst is added. In other words, samples 5 and 7 play a negative role in sonocatalyzing MO in this work. After ultrasonic irradiation, residuals of samples 7 and 8 were collected and characterized, their SEM images are shown in Fig. S2.† Compared with sample 8, which still retains the porous structure, sample 7 becomes more compact with small particles stacking together. In addition, the particles in sample 7 have a much smaller size, 50–200 nm, than that (∼500 nm) of their original particles (Fig. 6g), while the particles in sample 8 remain ∼100 nm in size (Fig. S3b† and 6h1). We speculate that the tiny chips suspended in solution caused by the shrinkage of the particles may be responsible for the negative effects.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the as-sintered bulk AlxCu(100−x) (x = 60, 67 and 85 at%) alloys were dealloyed in 20 wt% NaOH under free corrosion conditions and Al67Cu33 was studied in detail to evaluate the effects of sintering parameters on the precursors and products. By monitoring the sintering parameters, a higher sintering temperature and longer sintering duration contribute to the formation of a single phase of Al2Cu and tailored Cu, Cu2O, CuO or a mixture of them with various morphologies was obtained. The Al2Cu phase could be fully corroded whereas the AlCu phase obtained from sintering at a higher temperature remained after dealloying. In addition, the sonocatalytic performance of the as-dealloyed samples was evaluated, and a group of recommended parameters was identified: a pressure of 312.5 MPa, a sintering temperature of 500 °C and a holding time of 60 min, from which a mixture of Cu/Cu2O/CuO could be obtained. From this aspect, this work provides another strategy to fabricate nanostructured copper oxides, which is distinct to hydro-thermal and solvothermal methods or amorphous precursors involved in a dealloying method. In addition, phase segregation which affects the electrochemical behaviors is studied and the formation of oxides is related to the reaction of dissolved oxygen and copper adatoms/ions.
