    , Accepted 10th November 2016First published on 11th November 2016AbstractTiO2 nanotubes are a promising system to implement photoelectrochemical water splitting for the production of hydrogen fuel from sunlight. Besides the limited absorption spectrum, their performance is limited by the presence of trap states, which facilitate recombination, and the sluggish kinetics of the water splitting reaction. Long TiO2 nanotubes can potentially capture more light, but photogenerated charges are more prone to being lost to recombination as they must travel a longer path length. We demonstrate here that the use of Li doping extends the optimum nanotube length from 7 to 15 microns, yielding a photocurrent of 1.5 mA cm−2 under simulated sunlight at 1.65 VRHE. To identify the conditions under which photocurrent conversion is limited by the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the OER efficiency of TiO2 nanotubes was quantified by measuring photocurrent in the presence of a hole scavenger. TiO2 nanotubes doped with Li exhibited up to 78% efficiency towards water splitting under an anodic bias above 1.2 VRHE. Under conditions where water oxidation was a limiting factor, addition of a CoOx OER catalyst yielded up to a twofold improvement in the photocurrent under a small applied bias of 0.4 VRHE.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting provides a potentially revolutionary method to convert and store energy as a fuel, which overcomes the main drawback of conventional solar photovoltaics, i.e. the transient nature of solar energy.1 A PEC device consists of an electrochemical cell with at least one semiconductor electrode,2 which upon illumination generates electron/hole pairs that are directly used to perform the reduction and oxidation reactions, respectively. In this context, TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTs) formed from the anodization of Ti in fluoride-containing electrolytes constitute an attractive photoanode due to their inherent n-type doping, outstanding chemical stability in solution and under irradiation, high surface area, excellent 1-D charge transport properties and conduction band edge close to the redox potential of hydrogen evolution.3,4 The PEC performance of anatase TiO2 NTs is however limited by the wide 3.2 eV bandgap, which restricts light absorption only to the UV portion of the solar spectrum,5 resulting in a maximum theoretical photocurrent of 1.1 mA cm−2 at a planar electrode.6 Furthermore, the synthesis process of TiO2 NTs results in the generation of a large density of exciton-like trap states,7,8 which may facilitate charge carrier recombination.9 Various approaches have been used to circumvent the above limitations, including (i) the incorporation of anionic dopants to narrow the bandgap,10–12 (ii) pairing with narrow bandgap semiconductors to enhance visible light absorption,13 (iii) forming a heterojunction that promotes electron–hole separation,14 and (iv) doping with transition metals such as Nb and Ta to increase NT conductivity. These approaches have all been partly successful, reaching photocurrents in the order of 1 mA cm−2.15–18 A distinct approach involves reductive TiO2 doping, achieved either by combustion,19 exposure to the reducing agent NaBH4,20 annealing in high pressure H2 (ref. 21–24) or via milder electrochemical reduction,25–28 to induce Li or H doping. In the latter process, upon incorporation of H or Li, the reaction in eqn (1) occurs (M stands for H or Li), accompanied by a color change from gray to blue or black.26 M+ + Ti(IV)O2 + e− → M+Ti(III)O2(1)
Note that the formation of Ti3+ through this mechanism does not necessarily require the presence of an oxygen vacancy, as it would occur in intrinsic TiO2. The exact mechanism responsible for the improvement of the PEC performance in reduced TiO2 remains unclear. Mid-gap states were observed by Chen et al. after high pressure H2 annealing, which resulted in visible light absorption.21 In other reports, the presence of surface Ti3+ sites was proposed to enhance reactivity, to the extent that no co-catalyst was necessary to achieve an open circuit water splitting.23,29 Ti3+ sites were also found to induce 2–3 times more catalytic activity towards methylcyclohexane and methylene blue oxidation in the liquid phase, suggesting that the formation of this surface defect may also be able to catalyze other oxidation reactions.30,31 Temperature-programmed desorption and scanning tunneling microscopy studies by Lira et al. found that Ti3+ sites may contribute to higher photocatalytic activity by binding atmospheric O2 to the TiO2 surface, thus enhancing the upward band bending at the interface via charge-donating near-surface defects.32 Finally, we have shown that when TiO2 is reduced electrochemically, deep trap states usually present in the nanotubes are passivated, increasing the PEC performance by limiting recombination, without however achieving visible light absorption.26,27,33 In this passivation mechanism, electrons are injected into the trap states prior to performing PEC measurements, eliminating an available recombination pathway and thus enhancing the electron mean free path.
Besides limited light absorption, the PEC performance of the photoanode is often limited by the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, which requires a four hole transfer to occur, and by the short electron mean free path. In order to better understand the influence of these phenomena on the overall efficiency, we consider two subsequent processes, schematically shown in Fig. 1: (i) the separation of electron–hole pairs in the bulk and (ii) the injection of holes into the electrolyte to run water oxidation at the interface. If the flux of holes to the solid/liquid interface is greater than the rate at which they can be injected into the electrolyte and react, hole accumulation will occur and the observed photocurrent will suffer losses due to surface recombination. This problem can be addressed by NT modification with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, but in order to quantify and understand their effect it is necessary to first identify the conditions when PEC performance is limited by water oxidation. Such conditions are determined in this work by performing photocurrent measurements with and without a hole scavenger,34 as discussed in the Experimental methods. Increasing the length of TiO2 nanotubes to enhance light absorption is another possible route to improve the PEC performance, but recombination would also increase as charge carriers travel along an extended path length, placing a limit on the gains achievable by following this route.35 Most of the UV light irradiated onto TiO2 NTs is absorbed in the first 2 μm, implying that the electron mean free path must be comparable to the remainder of the tube length in order for the charge to reach the back contact. Using Nb-doped TiO2 NTs it was found that the optimum tube length was 7 μm, with an associated maximum photocurrent of 1 mA cm−2, close to the theoretical limit for a smooth surface.15 Finally, while various cobalt oxide-based catalysts have been reported in the literature, a side-by-side comparison of such oxides on reduced TiO2 nanotubes has yet to be studied.
 Fig. 1  Charge separation and reaction at the TiO2 interface. Once photogenerated electron–holes are created, they must first be separated and reach the interface with efficiency ϕCS before they react with water with efficiency ϕWS. 
In this report, we demonstrate that, in contrast with pristine TiO2 nanotubes with a relatively low OER efficiency (ca. 66% at 1.5 VRHE), Li-doped NTs exhibit an enhanced OER efficiency (ca. 78% at 1.5 VRHE), evidencing an intrinsically increased catalytic activity for this class of materials. Furthermore, we show a photocurrent of 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.65 VRHE in a neutral phosphate buffer electrolyte by using 15 μm long NTs doped with Li, roughly doubling the optimum tube length beyond the 7 μm limit found by Das et al.,15 thus demonstrating decreased recombination and a significantly longer mean free path. Finally, modification with three distinct cobalt oxide-based catalysts resulted in a sizeable cathodic shift of the PEC response when tested in alkaline electrolytes, increasing the photocurrent at 0.4 VRHE by up to a factor of 2, whereas under large applied bias, the photocurrent is limited by parasitic light absorption in the presence of the catalysts.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 nanotubes
TiO2 nanotubes were synthesized by a double-anodization method36 starting from Ti foils (Alfa Aesar, annealed, 99% metals basis, 2 × 0.7 × 0.127 cm3). Prior to anodization, the Ti foils were sonicated sequentially for 30 min each in acetone, isopropanol, and methanol. The nanotubes were anodized in 0.3 wt% NH4F (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%+, trace metals basis) and 2 vol% H2O in ethylene glycol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%, anhydrous). Anodization was performed using a Kepco BOP-100 voltage supply controlled by LabVIEW. First, a 50 V anodization was carried out with a Pt gauze counter electrode for 1 hour to generate 11 μm long nanotubes, which were then stripped off by sonication in water followed by removal with an adhesive tape. The second anodization was carried out with the same solution and potential, but the time was varied from 5 min to 4 hours to achieve a predetermined length.36 All aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized water from an in-house Millipore system (18.2 MΩ cm). The samples were annealed in air at 350 °C to crystallize the anatase phase.37
2.2. Photoelectrochemical characterization
Photoelectrochemical tests were carried out in 0.2 M Na2SO4 (Fisher), and 0.1 M NaCH3COO (pH = 7) for bare TiO2 NTs, and in 1 M KOH (Fisher Scientific, 85%+) for TiO2 nanotubes modified by OER catalysts. Doping of TiO2 nanotubes was carried out by applying −1.55 VSCE for 3 s in 1 M LiClO4 (Sigma Aldrich, ACS Reagent). Linear scan voltammetry (LSV) under chopped simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (Oriel Sol1A solar simulator) at 100 mV s−1 was used to record the photocurrent. In the neutral electrolyte, the LSV ranged from 0 to 1 VSCE, while in the alkaline electrolyte, the potential window was −0.75 to 1.0 VSCE; these potential ranges were selected to avoid inadvertent cathodic hydrogen doping. Measurement of the water oxidation reaction efficiency was performed by comparing the photocurrent of TiO2 nanotubes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.2) with and without 1 M sodium sulfite. With only KOH or buffer solution present, the reaction that occurs is only water splitting due to the absence of other potential reactions, while Na2SO3 undergoes oxidation to Na2SO4 when this species is added as a hole scavenger.38
2.3. Modification with the CoOx OER catalyst
TiO2 nanotubes were modified with cobalt oxide catalysts using three different methods. Except for cycling in 2 M KOH + 10 wt% EtOH where a Hg/HgO reference electrode was used, all electrochemical measurements described here use a three electrode configuration with a Pt gauze as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE), and a BioLogic SP-150 as the potentiostat. Prior to catalyst modification TiO2 nanotubes were doped to passivate trap states with Li by application of −1.55 VSCE in a solution of 1 M LiClO4.27 Metallic Co was prepared by electrodeposition from a solution of 0.3 M CoSO4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%+) + 0.25 M H2SO4 at −1.4 VSCE for 1–15 seconds. Co was converted to Co3O4 by cycling39 between the potentials of 0.1 and 1.3 VRHE in a solution of 2 M KOH + 10 wt% EtOH. A mixed phase cobalt oxide was formed by precipitation of 5 to 100 mM CoSO4 and 0.05 M NaOH40,41 by immersing TiO2 nanotube samples into this solution and stirring at 700 RPM for 15 minutes, followed by rinsing with DI water and drying in air. A portion of the precipitate was extracted from the liquid and dried prior to Raman spectroscopy measurements. Cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) was photodeposited from a solution of 0.5 mM CoNO3 and 0.1 M KH2PO4 (pH = 7 by addition of KOH(s)). The samples were exposed to 300 W Newport Solar Simulator with a UV-only filter and an applied bias of 1.0 VSCE for 2 to 8 minutes.
2.4. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
TiO2 NTs were first grown for 30 minutes to reach a 7.5 μm length, annealed, doped with Li, and then were sonicated in hexane to detach them from their substrate and dispersed into the hexane solvent. This dispersion was then loaded by pipetting into a capillary tube (Wilmad LabGlass, a 4 mm Thin Wall Quartz EPR sample tube, 100 mm length), allowing the tubes to settle to the bottom of the capillary, heated to boil off the solvent, and the process repeated until all the dispersed nanotube material had been loaded into the tube. EPR measurements were performed at room temperature on a Bruker EMX instrument using an applied microwave field of 9.82 GHz, approximately 2 mW of microwave power, and a modulation amplitude of 1 G p–p. Spectra were obtained by integrating 20 scans between 3475 and 3725 G. A room-temperature ER 4123D dielectric resonator was used and the data were fit using the EasySpin42 library and MATLAB version R2014b (Mathworks) by a non-linear least squares method.
2.5. Morphology and phase characterization
The morphology of TiO2 nanotubes was investigated using scanning electron microscopy in a FEI Quanta 650 FE-SEM. TEM imaging of catalyst modified TiO2 nanotubes was performed using a JEOL 2000FX. Raman spectra of CoOx catalyst modified TiO2 NTs were obtained by measurement with a 488 nm laser with a Renishaw InVIA Raman Microscope.
2.6. Determination of water oxidation efficiency
To assess the water splitting reaction efficiency, the photocurrent can be modeled as a product of three factors (eqn (2)), as illustrated in Fig. 1. Light absorption determines the maximum theoretical photocurrent, Jmax, under the assumption that 100% of photogenerated electron–hole pairs reach the interface and undergo the desired reaction. Once the electron–hole pairs are created, ϕCS represents the efficiency for charge separation and transport; this may be limited by small band bending and by bulk recombination, the latter being alleviated by trap state passivation.27 Once the holes reach the interface, they perform water splitting with reaction efficiency ϕWS. This last step is known to be sluggish due to the four holes needed for water oxidation, and is usually facilitated by the use of OER catalysts. In order to determine ϕWS for water splitting, we compare the photocurrent measured in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution to that in the same solution additivated with 1 M Na2SO3, the oxidation of which is known to exhibit reaction efficiency ϕsulfite ∼ 1 (eqn (3)).34 Assuming Jmax and ϕCS to be the same in the two solutions, the efficiency of water splitting can be derived as the ratio of the photocurrent in the sulfite electrolyte and in the solution without sulfite (eqn (4)). JWSPC = Jmax × ϕCS × ϕWS (water splitting)(2) JsulfitePC = Jmax × ϕCS × ϕsulfite (sulfite oxidation); ϕsulfite ≈ 1(3) (4)
3. Results and discussion
TiO2 nanotube arrays with various lengths are shown in cross sectional SEM images in Fig. 2(a) and their length as a function of time is plotted in Fig. 2(b). As the anodization time increases, the nanotubes grow from 2.8 μm at 15 minutes to 20 μm after 4 hours. The decline of the growth rate is caused by the ionic diffusion limitations in the anodization electrolyte as the tubes grow longer.43 The growth rate of TiO2 NTs decreases with increasing anodization time with an approximately logarithmic dependence: it takes 1 hour to go from 11 μm to 15 μm, but 2 hours to go from 15 μm to 20 μm. Finally, after 4 hours, etching at the mouth of the TiO2 nanotubes leads to the collapse of the top third of the tubular structure into bundles (Fig. 2(a), right), a non-ideal morphology for photoelectrochemical applications. This sets a limitation on how long the nanotubes can be grown by using this synthetic route. Fig. S1† shows the morphology of the TiO2 nanotubes from the top, and also displays the collapsed structure formed after 240 minutes of anodization. Using the image analysis program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, version 1.48v), the pore size frequency distributions for varying anodization times are calculated in Fig. S2.† With anodization time increasing between 15 and 120 minutes, the average pore size widens from 70 to 110 nm.

According to eqn (1) H or Li doping of the nanotubes should lead to the formation of Ti3+ with a concentration close to that of the dopant. The Li doping level produced by electrochemical intercalation under the same conditions studied herein was estimated in a previous study to be 3.6 at% by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, but using XPS we were unable to detect the Ti3+ species.27 In that study, we integrated the signal from Li over the volume of the TiO2 nanotube as it was etched, to obtain the ratio of Li to TiO2. This limitation in the detection of Ti3+ is supported by studies by Liu et al., who suggested that XPS could not detect Ti3+ at the concentration of several at% for high pressure H2 annealed NTs.23 In other studies, XPS was able to detect Ti3+ from the intercalation of Li into TiO2 nanoporous films, but only at the 32 at% level.44 Even in the work by Chen et al. where high pressure hydrogen annealing gave a mass ratio of TiO2:H2 of 400:1, corresponding to a molar ratio of TiO2:H2 of 10%, no change in the high resolution XPS spectra of the Ti 2p3/2 peak associated with the formation of Ti3+ was observed between “white” and “black” TiO2.24
An alternative method to detect Ti3+ is electron paramagnetic resonance; in this work EPR spectra were collected on undoped and Li doped TiO2 nanotubes and fitted using EasySpin. The results are plotted in Fig. 3. The prominent signal at g = 2.001 is assigned to oxygen vacancies,23,31 and a pair of weak signals detected at g = 1.992 and 1.961 can be assigned to the Ti3+ states.45 A weak peak located at g = 2.014 is also detected, and is assigned to the capture of O2 by Ti3+ sites at the surface.19,45,46 The latter were identified as centers with potentially high catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.46 To limit the number of variables included in the fitting, this third peak was not included. The EPR signals seen in our measurement from Ti3+ are weak compared to the intense signal detected by Liu et al.23 at room temperature, and they can be explained by the smaller amount of Ti3+ states introduced by electrochemical doping compared to high pressure H2 annealing. Given a 1:1 ratio of Li to Ti3+ from eqn (1), the amount of Ti3+ that we introduce with electrochemical doping is at the 1 at% level (1020 cm−3), while the density of the deep trap states targeted by electrochemical doping is on the order of 1017 cm−3.9,27 Since there is a three order of magnitude difference between the amount of trap states and the concentration of Ti3+ sites being produced, it is unnecessary to introduce the high concentration of dopants produced via high pressure doping to take advantage of trap state passivation. For PEC applications the high degree of disorder may even be harmful, as it may limit the carrier lifetime.

Fig. 4(a) shows the photocurrent as a function of potential for unmodified and Li doped TiO2 nanotubes with length 2.8 μm (grown for 15 minutes). The unmodified TiO2 NTs exhibit a slow photocurrent onset transient, characteristic of electron recombination by trap states,47 and a saturated photocurrent response, which we ascribe to Fermi-level pinning by the high density of trap states, limiting the band bending and thus separation of electron–hole pairs at the interface.27 After Li doping, the passivation of trap states increases the photocurrent up to threefold at 1.65 VRHE. Taking this as a benchmark potential, the photocurrent of TiO2 NTs of various lengths is compared in Fig. 4(b). For undoped TiO2 NTs, the optimum length appears to lie between 8 and 16 μm, with a photocurrent of about 0.5 mA cm−2; in contrast, the doped TiO2 NTs exhibit an increasing photocurrent up to 16 μm length, with a maximum of 1.5 mA cm−2, significantly larger than the maximum theoretical value for planar TiO2. This result demonstrates that by doping it is possible to extend the optimum NT length beyond the 7 μm limit reported by Das et al.,15 resulting in higher collection efficiency.
 Fig. 4  (a) Photoelectrochemical LSV of TiO2 nanotubes with and without Li doping demonstrates the ability to increase the photocurrent by trap state passivation. (b) Photocurrent as a function of the TiO2 nanotube length shows an optimum at 16 μm associated with a 1.5 mA cm−2 photocurrent. 
The PEC response from 1 μm long doped and undoped TiO2 nanotubes in a phosphate buffer solution with and without 1 M Na sulfite, a hole scavenger, is plotted in Fig. 5(a). For the undoped TiO2 nanotubes, a significant difference in the photocurrent as a function of potential is observed upon the addition of the hole scavenger in the solution. The photo response at 1.2 V increases by about 1.5 fold, due to the rapid kinetics of the sulfite oxidation. In addition, the onset potential shifts negatively from ∼0.2 to 0 VRHE, exhibiting improved performance with respect to BiVO4.34 For the Li-doped nanotubes, the onset potential shift is similar, but difference in photocurrent is significantly reduced, due to the acceleration of the water splitting process caused by the enhanced catalytic activity of the Li-generated Ti3+ sites. The Fermi-level pinning due to the trap states in the undoped material artificially enforces a fixed degree of band bending (schematically represented in Fig. 6), limiting the maximum rate at which the holes can be transferred to the electrolyte. On the other hand, in Li-doped NTs, the band bending increases with applied bias, and weaker bending in the region below 1.2 VRHE results in enhanced recombination and low photogenerated hole flux. In addition to delivering more holes to the interface, the electric field is expected to keep the electron–hole pairs separated, allowing holes to reside at the interface long enough for the water oxidation reaction to occur. By replacing the water oxidation reaction with sulfite oxidation in the presence of Na2SO3, the holes can be readily injected into the electrolyte irrespective of the magnitude of the hole flux. A comparison of the photocurrent observed in these two solutions, assuming that light absorption and charge separation in the bulk are not affected by the presence of sulfite in the solution, yields the OER efficiency vs. applied potential (eqn (2)–(4) in the Experimental section). Below 1.0 VRHE the OER yield is less than 65% in either case (Fig. 5(b)); afterwards the efficiency of undoped NTs saturated, while that of Li-doped NTs kept increasing, reaching up to 78% at 1.5 VRHE. It should be noted that, even though the limitations set by water oxidation relax with increasing bias, this is in part due to the ability of Li ion intercalation to suppress recombination.

Photocurrents of doped TiO2 NTs are limited by water oxidation kinetics below 1.2 VRHE. (b) OER efficiency of TiO2 NTs, 1 micron length. The reaction efficiency rises from 66% to 78% at 1.5 V vs. RHE.

In parallel the traps facilitate recombination of electron–hole pairs. 
In order to further investigate water oxidation kinetics while keeping the electrode geometry fixed, TiO2 nanotube arrays of 1 μm length were modified with three different Co-based catalyst systems: electrodeposited Co3O4, a mixed phase Co3O4/CoOOH obtained by chemical precipitation, and photo-deposited Co phosphate Co-Pi.
The electrodeposited system was identified by a Raman peak at 691 cm−1 to be Co3O4 (Fig. S3†) and further confirmed by EDS (Fig. S4†); SEM images of Co3O4 particles decorating the surface of the nanotubes are presented in Fig. S5,† suggesting that electrodeposition favors growth on the top surface of the nanotubes.
The chemically precipitated material was identified to be a mixture of Co3O4 and CoOOH (Fig. S3,† inset) by Raman spectroscopy of the precipitated extracted from the solution. EDS mapping (Fig. S4(b)†) showed that Co was distributed uniformly across the surface of the sample. In contrast with the electrodeposited samples, where the catalyst clusters on the surface, Fig. 7 shows TEM images of TiO2 nanotubes modified with the catalyst prepared by precipitation. Particles decorate the inner and outer surfaces of the TiO2 nanotube walls, while EDS measurements taken in this area confirm that Co is present inside the tubes (Fig. 7(b)).
 Fig. 7  (a) TEM image of TiO2 NTs modified with the mixed Co3O4/CoOOH catalyst. (b) EDS measurements taken with the TEM confirm the presence of Co inside the nanotubes. Cu comes from the TEM grid itself. 
With regard to the photo-deposited Co-Pi system, EDS spectra (Fig. S4†) obtained by scanning the surface at low magnification were able to confirm that Co and P were present in the samples even when the deposit was not visible. As Co-Pi's structure can only be detected using X-ray absorption techniques,48 our inability to detect it with Raman is understandable.
Photocurrent measurements on TiO2 NTs after modification with the precipitated OER catalyst are shown in Fig. 8(a), comparing the photocurrent of the catalyst-modified, Li-doped TiO2 nanotube array with the photocurrent of bare Li-doped TiO2 NTs. The same general behavior is seen in NTs decorated with each of the three catalysts, while the effect of increasing the amount of catalyst is discussed later. Fig. 8(b) shows the ratio R of the photocurrent without the catalyst to that with the catalyst as a function of potential. Photocurrent is observed to shift towards more negative potentials with the addition of cobalt oxide, corresponding to approximately a 2-fold enhancement in the photocurrent at 0.5 VRHE; specifically, the photocurrent increases from ∼0.1 to ∼0.22 mA cm−2. However, as the potential is raised to more positive values, the photocurrent difference decreases, until R reaches 100% above 1.2 VRHE. Above 1.4 VRHE, a strong electrochemical OER current is observed, resulting in a current density of 12 mA cm−2 at 2.0 VRHE, 60 times higher than the 0.2 mA cm−2 dark current without the catalyst. Our observation of photocurrent enhancement by deposition of the OER catalyst only within the potential window below 1.2 VRHE supports the above hypothesis that this is the regime where the water oxidation kinetics are a limiting factor in the photocurrent conversion of TiO2 nanotubes.
 Fig. 8  (a) Photocurrent generated by 1 μm long TiO2 nanotubes modified with the Co3O4/CoOOH catalyst shows a negative shift in the photocurrent. (b) Ratio of the photocurrent with and without the catalyst shows an increase from 0.4 up to 1.0 at 1.2 VRHE. Measurements above 1.4 VRHE cannot be taken due to the strong electrochemical OER behavior in the dark. 
To compare the effectiveness of the three different types of catalysts deposited on the nanotubes, Fig. S6† shows the photocurrent of TiO2 nanotubes modified with varying amounts of the three catalysts under a small applied bias at 0.4 VRHE, i.e. in the window where OER kinetics are limiting, and 1.23 VRHE, in the window where it is not. We observe that under small applied biases, all three catalysts produce approximately a doubling in the photocurrent, unaffected by the amount of deposit. This appears to support the observations by Liu et al. that, once the surface area was accounted for, Co3O4 and CoOOH were equally effective catalysts with identical Tafel slopes.49 In the high bias case, however, adding more catalyst material results in decreasing photocurrents. This indicates that in the latter scenario where OER kinetics are not limiting, the catalyst may be detrimental to the performance by parasitically absorbing the incoming light.
4. Conclusions
Our study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the Li doping technique in enhancing the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 nanotubes, identified the conditions where water oxidation kinetics are the limiting factor in photocurrent conversion, and showed also that their response can be improved at small applied bias with addition of OER catalysts. By Li intercalation, we have been able to produce an optimum TiO2 nanotube length of 15 μm, generating a photocurrent of 1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.65 VRHE. Comparing the photocurrent in the presence of a sulfite hole scavenger, we have determined that in the region from the onset potential to 1.0 VRHE, the interface recombination plays an essential role in limiting the photo response caused by the sluggish water oxidation kinetics and reaction efficiency (less than 60%). At higher bias above 1.2 VRHE, the fraction of holes which can be transferred to the electrolyte in unmodified NTs saturates at 66%, while Li-intercalation under sufficiently strong anodic bias can further induce separation of electron–hole pairs, and an OER efficiency close to 80% can be obtained. Modification of TiO2 nanotubes with an OER catalyst shows improvements only in the low bias range, validating the use of a sulfite solution to identify the regions where the reaction is limited by the water oxidation.

Table Content:
M+ + Ti(IV)O2 + e− → M+Ti(III)O2	(1)

 	Fig. 1  Charge separation and reaction at the TiO2 interface. Once photogenerated electron–holes are created, they must first be separated and reach the interface with efficiency ϕCS before they react with water with efficiency ϕWS.	 
JWSPC = Jmax × ϕCS × ϕWS (water splitting)	(2)
JsulfitePC = Jmax × ϕCS × ϕsulfite (sulfite oxidation); ϕsulfite ≈ 1	(3)
	(4)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Cross sectional SEM images of TiO2 nanotubes for anodization times between 15 min and 240 minutes. (b) Length of nanotubes vs. anodization times shows a slowing of the growth rate after 60 minutes. Data for the 1 μm sample are from ref. 27.	 

 	Fig. 3  EPR spectra of TiO2 nanotubes. The primary peak at g = 2.001 corresponds to oxygen vacancy signals while the signals at g = 1.992 and 1.961 are assigned to Ti3+. The blue traces indicate fitting obtained with the EasySpin package.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Photoelectrochemical LSV of TiO2 nanotubes with and without Li doping demonstrates the ability to increase the photocurrent by trap state passivation. (b) Photocurrent as a function of the TiO2 nanotube length shows an optimum at 16 μm associated with a 1.5 mA cm−2 photocurrent.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Photocurrent of TiO2 NTs in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution with and without the Na2SO3 hole scavenger. Photocurrents of doped TiO2 NTs are limited by water oxidation kinetics below 1.2 VRHE. (b) OER efficiency of TiO2 NTs, 1 micron length. The reaction efficiency rises from 66% to 78% at 1.5 V vs. RHE.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic of band bending at the Li-modified TiO2 nanotube interface in the presence of an electrolyte and under illumination with a freely moving Fermi energy (top) and undoped TiO2 NTs with the Fermi energy pinned by defects (bottom). In parallel the traps facilitate recombination of electron–hole pairs.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) TEM image of TiO2 NTs modified with the mixed Co3O4/CoOOH catalyst. (b) EDS measurements taken with the TEM confirm the presence of Co inside the nanotubes. Cu comes from the TEM grid itself.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Photocurrent generated by 1 μm long TiO2 nanotubes modified with the Co3O4/CoOOH catalyst shows a negative shift in the photocurrent. (b) Ratio of the photocurrent with and without the catalyst shows an increase from 0.4 up to 1.0 at 1.2 VRHE. Measurements above 1.4 VRHE cannot be taken due to the strong electrochemical OER behavior in the dark.
