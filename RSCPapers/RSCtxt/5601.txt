    , Accepted 16th December 2019First published on 18th December 2019AbstractWe prepared novel conjugated polymer based NIR-II nanoparticles, which display extremely high photothermal conversion efficiency (65%). Both in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed that the as-prepared nanoparticles exhibit excellent theranostic properties including an extremely high cancer cell killing ability, admirable tumor elimination efficiency (100%) and a remarkable photoacoustic imaging contrast enhancing ability.
Although great efforts have been devoted towards developing new anticancer strategies over the past few decades, the prognosis and clinical outcomes of cancer patients still remain unsatisfactory.1,2 Currently, most cancer patients are diagnosed and treated in the late stage with metastasis, so precise detection and treatment of cancer at an early stage is crucial for reducing the mortality and improving the prognosis of cancer patients.3,4 So far, many theranostic agents have been exploited, which can be used to detect the location of cancer, ascertain the accumulation of agents, monitor their therapeutic efficacy and destroy tumors with excellent specificity and sensitivity.5,6 However, these traditional theranostic agents, which are usually chemically or physically assembled from several diagnostic and therapeutic agents,7 have many disadvantages, such as unstable structures, and high fabrication complexity and cost. Therefore, the biomedical applications of traditional theranostic agents may be limited.8 Hence, exploring single components with multiple purposes for “all-in-one” theranostic nanosystems has attracted great attention in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment.9,10
Over the past several years, theranostic strategies of photoacoustic imaging/photothermal therapy (PAI/PTT) based on photothermal conversion agents have gained extensive attention.11,12 PAI allows the imaging of tissues exceeding the optical diffusion limit because it monitors phonons rather than photons after light excitation, which could provide eminent spatial resolution and a higher depth of tissue penetration in vivo compared to the traditional optical imaging method.13,14 In addition, PTT is an excellent and admirable therapeutic approach for tumor treatment due to its unique advantages, such as its (1) high selectivity, (2) minimally invasive nature, (3) easy procedure and (4) short treatment time, etc.15 In a word, theranostic systems with PAI/PTT dual-functionalities have superior merits.
In recent years, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) based on conjugated polymers (CPs) have been widely explored and used in PAI/PTT theranostic systems due to their prominent light-absorption and excellent photo-stability properties.16–18 However, the maximum absorption peaks of conventional CPNs were located in the NIR-I region,19 which sustains severe light scattering and attenuation, resulting in a decrease of light penetration depth. Recently, the NIR-II window has attracted extensive attention due to its excellent merits compared to conventional near-infrared I light in terms of lower tissue scattering, thus leading to significantly improved light penetration.20,21 Despite this excellent light penetration depth, CPNs for PAI/PTT theranostics are still extremely limited due to their (1) few types of materials and (2) low photothermal conversion efficiency. Thus, developing novel NIR-II conjugated polymer nanoparticles with high photothermal conversion efficiency for PAI/PTT theranostic applications is highly desired.
In this study, we designed and prepared a novel co-benzobisthiadiazole-dithienosilole (PBBTDTS) polymer (Fig. S1, ESI†), which was confirmed by H-NMR (Fig. S9a, ESI†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBBTDTS was measured to be 34.9 kDa. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum displayed the maximum absorption peak of the PBBTDTS polymer in the NIR-II region (Fig. S9b, ESI†), which means that it had a superior narrow bandgap. And the PBBTDTS polymer presented a kermesinus colour in CH2Cl2 (Fig. S9c, ESI†). Then, the polymer was fabricated as water-soluble nanoparticles NPsPBBTDTS (BD NPs) via a nanoprecipitation approach with DSPE-PEG-N3 as the encapsulation matrix (Scheme 1). Afterwards, the aptamer was modified on the surfaces of the BD NPs using click chemistry to obtain NPsPBBTDTS-Aptamer (BDA NPs) with an active targeting ability. The successful modification was confirmed by zeta potential changes. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the zeta potential decreased when the BD NPs were functionalized with the aptamer, which are single stranded DNA fragments carrying negative charges. Meanwhile, the molar ratio of the aptamer to DSPE-PEG on the BDA NPs’ surfaces was calculated to be about 1/4000. It is gratifying that the as-prepared BDA NPs could be directly dissolved in phosphate buffer solution (PBS), exhibiting a similar kermesinus colour (Fig. S9c, ESI†). The TEM image showed that the BDA NPs exhibited excellent dispersity, and had a spherical morphology with diameters around 5–10 nm (Fig. S9d, ESI†). The hydrodynamic diameters of the BDA NPs were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), showing diameters in the range of 40–60 nm (Fig. S9e, ESI†), which were significantly bigger than the TEM results. This phenomenon was ascribed to the increased hydrophobicity caused by the shorter PEG chains of DSPE-PEG2000-N3. No precipitation and obvious size change were observed for BDA NPs during storage in PBS (pH = 7.4) both with and without 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) even for 15 days (Fig. S11, ESI†). Finally, the absorption properties of the BDA nanoparticles were investigated, as shown in Fig. S9b (ESI†). Notably, the obtained BDA nanoparticle dispersion still displayed the maximum absorbance in the second near-infrared region (1090 nm), which implied that the as-prepared BDA NPs mainly had an excellent NIR-II photothermal conversion effect.

(i) The photostability of the photoacoustic signal under irradiation with different laser powers for 20 min. 
Therefore, we attempted to survey the potential of the BDA NPs as a photothermal conversion agent. Firstly, concentration-dependent temperature increases were distinctly observed for the BDA NPs under NIR-II laser irradiation (Fig. 1a), which was similar to many photothermal agents.22 Meanwhile, the temperature increase was also intensely dependent on the laser power (Fig. 1b). Then, the photothermal conversion efficiency of the BDA nanoparticles was evaluated to be as high as 65% by the reported method (Fig. 1c and d), which was much higher than those of most reported photothermal conversion agents.23 Meanwhile, the BDA nanoparticle dispersion also presented an admirable photostability (Fig. 1e).
According to the literature, photothermal agents could produce an intense photoacoustic signal which relied on the conversion of absorbed photo-energy into heat to subsequently generate pressure waves (sound waves) via thermo-elastic expansion.24 Based on this, the photoacoustic properties of the BDA NPs were also evaluated. Firstly, the BDA NPs were added into an optically and acoustically penetrable silicon tube (Fig. 1f). Then, the photoacoustic imaging was monitored at 1064 nm. Concentration-dependent photoacoustic effects were obviously detected for the BDA NPs under NIR-II laser irradiation and the photoacoustic signals significantly increased with the increase of BDA NP concentration (Fig. 1g). The imaging profiles along the purple dashed line from the photoacoustic images are displayed in Fig. 1h, where the seven sharp peaks corresponded to the silicon tube with different concentrations of BDA NPs. It is worth noting that our BDA NPs displayed excellent photoacoustic signal stability under irradiation with different light powers for 20 min (Fig. 1i). In a word, the as-prepared BDA NPs had an excellent photoacoustic imaging effect and photothermal conversion ability in the second near-infrared window.
Encouraged by their desirable photothermal-conversion properties, the photothermal killing effect was monitored on HepG-2 cells. Initially, the targeting capability of the BDA NPs was evaluated. As presented in Fig. 2a, obvious red fluorescence of Cy3 from labelled BDA-Cy3 NPs could be clearly detected in the cytoplasm after incubation for 4 h. Meanwhile, only weak red fluorescence signals from the cells could be observed after 4 h incubation in the other groups including HeLa cells which could not be targeted by the TLS11a aptamer (Fig. S12, ESI†). These results suggested that our as-prepared BDA NPs had an excellent active targeting ability to HepG-2 cells.25 Then, the cytotoxicity of the BDA NPs was investigated through CCK-8 assay. After co-incubation for 24 hours, no obvious cytotoxicity was detected even at a high concentration of 80 μg mL−1, revealing the remarkably high biocompatibility of BDA NPs. We further investigated the in vitro efficacy of photothermal therapy against HepG-2 cells. Concentration-dependent phototoxicity was observed (Fig. 2b). The cell mortality increased with the increase of BDA nanoparticle concentration and the BDA NPs displayed an excellent photothermal killing capability. As expected, the killing effect was remarkably reduced when the cells were incubated with BDN (the control aptamer instead of the targeting aptamer) or BDA with free aptamer pre-blocking even at an extremely high concentration of 80 μg mL−1. In order to enable intuitive observation for the anticancer efficacy, cell apoptosis assay after photothermal therapy was further performed by fluorescence microscopy imaging. As shown in Fig. 2c, obvious red fluorescence could be observed and no green fluorescence was captured in group (5), which further demonstrated that our BDA NPs had excellent antitumor capability under 1064 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, the percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells was determined to be significantly increased from 14.1% (blank control) to 81.9% (cells treated with BDA and irradiated for 5 min) (Fig. 2d), further verifying the powerful apoptosis/necrosis-inducing capacity of BDA NPs with 1064 nm irradiation in tumor cells.

(c) IR thermal images of HepG-2 tumor-bearing mice after injection of PBS, BDN or BDA NPs with laser irradiation (1064 nm, 1 W cm−2) over time. (d) Temperature curves of tumors in the mice with the indicated treatments. (e) Tumor volume changes of the mice after the indicated treatments. (f) Body weight changes of the mice with the indicated treatments. (g) Images of tumor slices stained by H&E staining, proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry (Ki-67) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) after the indicated treatments in different groups: (1) control, (2) BDA NPs, (3) 1064 nm only, (4) BDN + 1064 nm, and (5) BDA + 1064 nm. The scale bar is 200 μm. 
The excellent photothermal conversion and remarkable targeting ability in vitro motivated us to employ BDA NPs for in vivo PAI and PTT of cancer. Firstly, the PAI capability of BDA nanoparticles in the tumor site was surveyed through tail vein injection. As exhibited in Fig. 3a, the PA signal was observed in the tumor as early as 4 h post-injection. And the signal intensity increased gradually from 4 to 12 h post-injection, giving the maximum value at 12 h. Along with the metabolism in the body, the signals decreased 24 h post-injection. It's worth noting that the PA signal intensity of BDA NP treated mice was higher than that of BDN NP injected mice at all the time points (Fig. 3a and b), which demonstrated that our obtained BDA NPs also had excellent targeting capability in vivo.
Encouraged by the excellent photothermal therapy efficacy in vitro, and the admirable targeting accumulation and photoacoustic imaging ability of BDA NPs to HepG-2 tumor cells, their in vivo anti-cancer capability was further investigated in tumor bearing nude mice. As the photoacoustic imaging results revealed that the BDA nanoparticles reached the highest accumulation 12 h post-injection at the tumor site, the mice were treated with localized 1064 nm near-infrared light irradiation on the tumor site 12 h post-injection. As presented in Fig. 3c and d, the temperature at the tumor site of the BDA NP injected mice rapidly increased to 63 °C, whereas the temperature at the tumor site of the mice injected with BDN or PBS only increased by 21.7 °C or 8.3 °C, respectively. Moreover, the thermal images further confirmed the excellent accumulation and high photothermal conversion capability of BDA nanoparticles in the tumor region. After the indicated treatments, the tumor sizes and body weights of the mice were, respectively, recorded every three days (Fig. 3e and f). The tumors gradually increased in the control, BDA, and free laser groups, demonstrating that the laser irradiation and BDA alone cannot affect tumor growth (Fig. 3e and Fig. S13, ESI†). The tumors treated by BDN injection with 1064 nm laser irradiation showed excellent inhibition at the starting stage of treatment, but recurrence was observed at a later period of the treatment. Significantly, the tumors completely disappeared with no recurrence, and the mice showed remarkably improved treatment outcomes in the group treated by BDA injection with 1064 nm laser irradiation, illustrating that our as-prepared BDA NPs had a more thorough tumor eliminating ability with active targeting. Meanwhile, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunofluorescence analysis and TUNEL staining of tumor tissues further verified that the as-prepared BDA NPs had a superior targeted tumor growth inhibition effect under NIR-II irradiation in vivo, as shown in Fig. 3g. Finally, the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) analysis revealed the BDA NPs with NIR irradiation exhibited an admirable biocompatibility (Fig. S14, ESI†).
In summary, we prepared novel narrow bandgap conjugated polymer based NIR-II theranostic nanoparticles, which exhibited an admirable photostability and an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 65%, as well as superior PAI efficacy. Furthermore, the obtained BDA NPs displayed an excellent targeting accumulation ability toward HepG-2 cells in vitro and in vivo, and had an admirable PA contrast enhancing ability in vivo under NIR-II irradiation. Moreover, the excellent anti-tumor efficacy of the BDA nanoparticles was also demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo with wonderful biosafety. Overall, we developed a novel “all-in-one” NIR-II semiconducting polymer nanoparticle system for cancer photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy.
