    , Accepted 9th August 2021First published on 9th August 2021AbstractIn this study, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been synthesized. The cobalt-doped (CoO/g-C3N4) samples prepared by the impregnation method and their catalytic property were investigated on the ODS process. The structure and components of the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption–desorption (BET), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The parameters, such as the reaction temperature, oxidant dosage, amount of catalyst, different cobalt contents loaded (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 wt%), and reaction time, were optimized by the Taguchi method. Results demonstrated that under the optimal condition (65 °C, 0.05 ml oxidant, 0.06 g catalyst, 45% of cobalt loading, and 80 minutes), the conversion reached 86.7%. Besides, it revealed that cobalt contents loaded are the most effective parameters in the ODS process. In addition, the efficiency decreased sharply by adding cyclohexanone, which demonstrated that it has a strong negative effect on efficiency. Finally, a reaction mechanism for the catalytic oxidation of DBT in the presence of CoO/g-C3N4 was proposed.
1. Introduction
Sulfur compounds in gasoline continue to pollute the atmosphere, and the desulfurization of diesel fuel has become a major concern around the world.1 At present, the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process is the dominant method in the desulfurization of liquid fuel.2 This technology removes sulfur compounds, including the aliphati, and acyclic. However, for dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives, it demonstrates little performance. Extensive research has been done on alternative processes because hydrogen is not suitable in terms of the cost and process conditions.3 Many methods have been recently reported for the deep desulfurization of liquid fuel in the literature,4 such as biodesulfurization,5 selective adsorption,6 extraction by ionic liquid,7 and oxidative desulfurization (ODS).8 Since the work is being done in a mild setting, ODS is taken into account. Various sulfur compounds are selectively DBT-oxidized to sulfoxide (DBTO) and sulfone (DBTO2), or both, using a shift in polarity in this method.9 Currently, the best oxidant is H2O2 because it is cheap and easily accessible commercially.10
Heterogeneous catalyst transition-metal (Mo, V, W, Co) composites are highly capable of oxidative desulfurization (ODS).11–15 It has been demonstrated that the catalytic properties of such catalysts depend upon the dispersion and interaction of the cobalt species with the support. Commonly, the contents of Co dispersion will cause a different number of catalytic active sites. Thus, the preparation of the Co species with an appropriate size and their stabilization under the specific reaction conditions is important in heterogeneous catalysis.16 Chica et al. studied the catalytic performance of Ti-MCM-41 in a continuous fixed-bed reactor and gained 100% desulfurization.17 Zhang et al. showed that 90% oxidation of a thiophene compound could be obtained with cobalt at room temperature within two hours using air as an oxidant.18
Nakhaei Pour et al. investigated the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) functionalization as support on the cobalt catalyst activity in the Fischer−Tropsch synthesis (FTS).19 Wei et al. studied the novel catalysts of Co supported on KIT-6 for the oxidation of dibenzothiophene under room temperature, and atmospheric pressure showed 98.68% desulfurization by this heterogeneous catalyst.20 A number of MoO2/g-C3N4 compositions successfully prepared and used in the ODS process demonstrated that MoO2/g-C3N4 displays the best catalytic performance among all the samples examined, and the conversion was achieved at 96.0% under optimal conditions.21 Nakhaei Pour et al. investigated the effects of the metallic cobalt crystal phase on the catalytic activity of cobalt catalysts supported on carbon nanotubes in the FTS reaction.22
Graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as an organic semiconductor material has been of much consideration because of its incredible efficiency in photocatalysis and fluorescence properties.23 At ambient temperatures, graphitic carbon nitride is thought to be the most stable allotrope of carbon nitride due to its 2D-layered sheet-like structure. The g-C3N4 with a layered structure has become an interesting research subject everywhere in the world. It is commonly synthesized by the thermal condensation of nitrogen-rich precursors, such as dicyandiamide, melamine, and urea.24 Thermal condensation, solvothermal, chemical vapor deposition, microwave-assisted, polymerization, and hydrothermal synthesis approaches are methods that have been efficiently used in the preparation of carbon nitride for different purposes.25 The tri-s-triazine (C6N7) and s-triazine (C3N3) rings, respectively, make up the exact architecture of g-C3N4. Tri-s-triazine is more stable in the presence of oxygen. Calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) on the two major units of g-C3N4 have also revealed that tri-s-triazine is the most thermodynamically stable. It typically contains a two-dimensional sheet of sp2-hybridized carbons, whereas g-C3N4 has π-conjugated graphitic planes formed by sp2-hybridization of carbon and nitrogen atoms.26
The bandgap of graphitic carbon nitride is 2.7 eV, and it has several intriguing optical characteristics, making it an organic and metal-free semiconductor. Photoelectric nanodevices, chemical sensors, photovoltaic solar cells, and energy storage are all possible uses.27 Due to its unique thermal stability, appropriate electronic structure, and low cost of preparation, graphitic carbon nitride is a promising catalytic material in the areas of photocatalytic hydrogen production, metal-free heterogeneous catalysis in various organic systems, and oxygen reduction for fuel cells.28 There are numerous emerging applications of this graphitic carbon nitride. Such applications include based sensing, wastewater and environmental treatment, biomedical applications, solar energy application, and being used in device making.
In the previous work, Zhao et al. found the Co/g-C3N4 composite as a photocatalyst, complexing agent, and sacrificial agent as essential parameters for the photochemical deposition process.29 Hassani et al. prepared the composition of Co3O4/g-C3N4 in heterojunction photocatalysis to for the decay of organics dyes for the first time.30 Nakhaei Pour et al. studied the performance of cobalt catalysts on a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) support in the FTS reaction.31 Liu and Zhang prepared Co/g-C3N4, and graphene oxide was available and very useful in the ORR process.32 Nakhaei Pour et al. studied a series of cobalt catalysts supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with the loading of 5, 15, and 30 wt%, and evaluated the activity of the prepared catalysts in the FTS reaction.33
In the present work, the cobalt-doped (CoO/g-C3N4) samples have been prepared. The samples were characterized, and the catalytic ability of the samples was examined through the oxidation of DBT as a sulfur compound. The effects of the cobalt content loaded, amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, oxidant dosage, and reaction time have been evaluated on the ODS process. Taguchi's experimental design methodology has been applied for optimizing the reaction conditions. The most effective parameter on the process has been shown by using the experimental design method.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All substances were commercial products (Merck) and used without further treatment. Melamine, ethanol (99.9%), cobalt nitrate (Co (NO3)2·6H2O) (>97.0%), citric acid (>99.5%), sulfur compound: dibenzothiophene (DBT, 99%), n-heptane, and hydrogen peroxide (aqueous solution, 30%).
2.2. Preparation of g-C3N4 as a support
The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheet was prepared directly by heating melamine as a nitrogen-rich precursor. In summary, 20 g of melamine was placed into a crucible with a cover. Afterward, it was heated from room temperature to 550 °C at the rate of 5 °C min−1, and kept at this temperature for 2 hours. In the next step, the samples were cooled to ambient temperature. Finally, the yellow solid was milled, pressed, and sieved for catalyst preparation. The prepared sample was named GNM for g-C3N4 prepared using melamine.
2.3. Preparation the CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst
The prepared g-C3N4 samples were used as support to prepare cobalt catalysts for the ODS process using an incipient impregnation method. Briefly, 8.5 g of prepared g-C3N4 was dispersed in 20 mL ethanol by the ultrasonic bath at a frequency of 40 kHz and a power of 155 W for one hour. Then, 7.6 g of the cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and 4.5 g of the citric acid were dissolved in 20 mL ethanol. Afterward, this prepared solution was added to support the dispersion in ethanol, and the resulted mixture was again placed into an ultrasonic bath for one hour to diffuse the cobalt solution into the g-C3N4 sheets. The precursor was dried at 90 °C for 72 hours, calcined from ambient to 400 °C with a 5 °C min−1 heating rate, and was kept at 400 °C for 4 hours under nitrogen atmosphere.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared catalysts after calcination were recorded on a GNR instrument using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 1.54 Å) and a detector type of Detris (Fast Strip). Peak detection was performed using the JCPDS database. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were displayed by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN BRNO-Mira3 LMU, Czech Republic). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TecnaiG2 F20, FEI) images of the catalyst were used to define the internal morphologies.
FT-IR spectra were obtained using a Thermo Nicolet AVATAR 370 FT-IR (Nicolet, USA). A thin pellet for the FT-IR spectra was prepared by grinding of g-G3N4 with potassium bromide (KBr) powder and then pressed into a disk. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and non-local density functional theory (DFT) model for the pore size and pore volume results of the support g-C3N4 and prepared catalysts were evaluated by N2 adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 automated system. Before analysis, 0.5 g of the sample was degassed at 100 °C for one hour, heated to 300 °C for 2 h, and analyzed by N2 physisorption at −196 °C. The hydrogen chemisorptions of the fresh catalysts were measured in a quartz reactor. 0.5 g of the calcined catalyst was reduced by hydrogen at 400 °C, and purged by helium at 100 °C for the elimination of the physically adsorbed hydrogen. Then, desorption of hydrogen from the example was evaluated at 400 °C under the helium flow. The metallic cobalt particle size was calculated from the cobalt metal dispersion by assuming spherical uniform cobalt metal particles with a site density of 14.6 at nm−2, using eqn (1): (1)
2.5. Oxidative desulfurization of the model fuel
The experimental section included the oxidation of DBT to DBTO2, which was performed at atmospheric pressure. The model fuel was prepared by dissolving DBT in n-heptane as a solvent that had a sulfur content of 500 ppm (μg g−1). Reactions were performed in a 100 mL two-necked flask. First, 20 mL model fuel was stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer and heated in a water bath. Then, a certain amount of catalyst was added to the mixture. When the temperature was fixed, a specific amount of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide was added into a two-necked flask as an oxidant to start the reaction. The reactor is equipped with a reflux condenser to reduce the loss of the heptane vapor.
The concentration of sulfur was detected by (GC-FID) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis 2100 spectrophotometer, SHIMADZU) spectrophotometer in the range of 200–350 nm. The conversion was calculated using eqn (2): (2)where χ is the DBT conversion, and c0 and c are the DBT concentration (ppm) before and after oxidation experiments, respectively.
2.6. Experimental design
In the present work, the effect of five parameters was investigated. The parameters include the cobalt content loaded, amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, oxidant dosage, and reaction time, and each of the parameters has five levels. All experiments have been summarized in Table 1. Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for each response exclusively to investigate whether the process parameters are statistically significant. In addition, the most effective parameter of the reaction and the optimal condition have been determined for this method.

2.7. Effect of the aromatic composition on ODS
In this work, the effect of the aromatic compounds was evaluated on the ODS process. Toluene and cyclohexanone were selected as delegate compounds and DBT to make model fuels with a volume fraction of 5%, 10%, and 20%, and the conversion of the reaction was measured.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the catalyst
The XRD pattern of the prepared g-C3N4 supports using melamine fresh calcined CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, there are two peaks in the XRD pattern of the g-C3N4 support. The stiff peak is located at 2θ values of 27.4°, which can be indexed as the (002) crystal plane (JCPDS 87-1526).34 This is a characteristic peak of the typical inter-planar stacking of the aromatic systems with a d spacing of 3.3 Å.35
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the samples (a) g-C3N4 and (b) CoO/g-C3N4 (45%). 
There was another peak shown that is positioned at the 2θ value of 13.5°, indicating that the synthesized catalyst comprising tri-s-triazine units was structurally oriented in-plane of the packing motif, and related to the (100) crystal plane of the interlayer structure and d spacing of 6.8 Å (JCPDS 87-1526).35,36 Compared to the g-C3N4 support, both peak intensities for the CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst were lower due to the reduced crystallinity of g-C3N4 during heating treatment of the prepared catalyst.37 The increase of Co prevented the polymeric condensation during the thermal process. Moreover, CoO is generally observed in calcined cobalt-based catalysts based on the 2θ values of 37° and 43° for the (111) and (200) surfaces (JCPDS 24-5323),38 respectively. These results show that the CoO active site is prepared on the surface of the g-C3N4 support.
The surface morphology of the g-C3N4 supports synthesis by melamine and the CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst was displayed. As shown in Fig. 2, the surfaces were formed from smooth sheets, although loading cobalt on g-C3N4 resulted in the bulk being located on the surface, and it seemed to be rough. The dispersion of cobalt particles was low on the GNM support with the cobalt particle size being between 15–35 nm. The direct relationship between the cobalt dispersion and g-C3N4 surface area may be explained by a strong association between the cobalt species and the g-C3N4 support, which prevents the cobalt particles from clumping together. The CoO still maintained the interlayer structure with black spots detected among the layers, which showed that these regions were more destructive than the light-colored ones. This was presumably due to the existence of CoO loaded between the interlayers of g-C3N4.

The BET surface area, average pore diameter, and pore volume of the prepared g-C3N4 support and CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts are given in Table 2. It was demonstrated that as the surface area and pore volume of the prepared g-C3N4 support increased, the pore size decreased by impregnation of cobalt on the surface of the g-C3N4 support. We have assumed that the stoichiometry of hydrogen adsorption on cobalt is H:Co = 1, and the results are given in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, H2 uptake is 66.2 μmol hydrogen desorbed per gram of catalyst for the CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts, dispersion is 4.1% and cobalt particle size is 23.4 nm.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution curves of the prepared g-C3N4 support and CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst are shown in Fig. 3. As per the International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the entire arranged models show type IV isotherms with H3 hysteresis circles, which recommend the presence of mesopores and macropores within them. These pores are cut molded, which are framed from the agglomeration of chip-like particles. The pore size appropriation of the pre-arranged models was set up dependent on the non-neighborhood thickness useful hypothesis (NLDFT) model. Additionally, the porosity and surface space of the pre-arranged impetuses expanded after metal stacking and calcination because of the ultrasound impact that isolates the carbon plates. The incomplete obliteration of the help and extra pores arrangement (Fig. 3) and the warm peeling of g-C3N4 into slenderer nanosheets during the calcinations of CoO/g-C3N4 impetuses might also be another purpose behind the increment of the porosity and surface space of the pre-arranged cobalt impetuses.
 Fig. 3  Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the prepared samples were obtained at 77 K: (a) GNM, (b) CoO/GNM (45%). 
Moreover, it indicated that the pore size of the CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts is smaller than that of the pure g-C3N4 supports due to the tamping of pores by the loading of CoO nanoparticles on the g-C3N4 nanosheets.
The FT-IR spectra of the prepared g-C3N4 support using melamine and prepared CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts using melamine are shown in Fig. 4. The broad peak between 3000–3500 cm−1 is related to the N–H and O–H bond stretching vibrational modes, which shows that the structures have the uncondensed amino functional groups for sample preparation. In addition, the region of 1250–1650 cm−1 is attributed to the distinctive stretching vibration groups of the C–N and CN heterocyclic.34,39 The band at 890 cm−1 was related to the deformation mode of N–H, which shows the partial condensation of amine groups.34,39 The peak at about 810 cm−1 is due to the characteristic breathing mode of the tri-s-triazine unit.35,36 Except for the strong peaks based at 493 cm−1 and 2180 cm−1, which are attributable to the CoO species and CN stretching vibration due to the deformation of the CN heterocycles caused by high-temperature treatment in catalyst calcination, all of the characteristic vibration peaks of the CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst are the same as that for pure g-C3N4 support in the FT-IR spectrum.40 No peaks at 570 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 are shown in the FT-IR spectrum of the prepared CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts, which is attributed to the Co–O stretching of Co3O4 in the prepared catalyst.41 These results show that the active sites in the prepared catalysts are CoO, and no evidence of Co3O4 was found.

3.2. Optimization of the ODS reaction
In this work, the Taguchi design was used for the optimization of DBT oxidation as a sulfur compound in the fuel. The basic principle of the Taguchi method is to evaluate the effects of many different factors by varying them concurrently, rather than changing one parameter at a time. The Taguchi experimental design was utilized, followed by an orthogonal array (L25), and the effect of different parameter levels, including cobalt loading, amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, oxidant dosage, and reaction time on DBT conversion and turnover frequency (TOF), were investigated in Table 3. The TOF is the converted reactant/(amount of active sites * reaction time), and was calculated using eqn (3) as the surface-specific activity: (3)where nDBT is the amount of CO molecules (mmol) converted per second, nCo-surf (mmol gcat−1) is the amount of the surface cobalt atoms determined by the hydrogen chemisorption, and mcat is the catalyst weight loaded to the reactor.

3.2.1. Effect of cobalt loading (wt%). 
In general, metal oxides (such as MoO2, MnO2, PdO, TiO2, CoO) cause the formation of peroxo-complexes, which oxidize DBT in the non-polar phase. To improve the catalytic activity of these active sites and increase the surface area, metal oxides are loaded on various supports. As mentioned in the previous section, CoO active sites are dispersed on the g-C3N4 support in the prepared CoO/g-C3N4 catalysts in the present work. It has been reported that the metal-support interactions may noticeably affect the surface properties, and hence catalytic reactivities.42 From the essential viewpoint, these interactions depend mainly upon factors, such as the concentration of metal species, nature of the support, and temperature and duration of calcinations.43 Meanwhile, the activity and selectivity of a catalyst depend on its degree of dispersion, which is the ratio of surface metal atoms to the total number of metal atoms. The support prevents the agglomeration of the active phase particles, and exposes all available metal particles to the reaction. Catalytic performance samples on the ODS process are dependent on the cobalt content in CoO/g-C3N4.
The effect of cobalt loading (wt%) on desulfurization has been displayed in Fig. 5(a). It has been shown that by increasing the loading content of cobalt, the conversion rate has increased. Due to the lack of active site species at <45% loading, a low DBT conversion rate was obtained. When the loading content is higher than 45%, the efficiency of the catalyst decreases because an accumulation of metal particles occurs with the increase of the weight percentage; thus, the partial destruction of the nanosheet structures is inevitable. To prove this point, pictures were taken of a sample with a cobalt content of 60 (wt%). As shown in Fig. 2(c), part of the structure has been destroyed. Ji et al. synthesized the HSiW/h-BN samples with loading amounts (0.05–50 wt%) for the ODS process, and demonstrated that the mass loading of 25% was the optimal value and 50% HSiW/h-BN sample generated serious aggregation.44 Zhang et al. also prepared catalysts with different loading Ti (10–60 wt%) for the oxidative desulfurization process, and they reported that the best sample was 30 (wt%) among other Ti-containing hierarchical zeolite Y, and the rise of the Ti content caused a reduction of the catalytic performance.45

3.2.2. Effect of the reaction temperature. 
The Gibbs free energy of DBT oxidation is positive. Thus, it is clear that at the low reaction temperature, the conversion is reduced.46 On the other hand, the reduction in conversion at low temperatures may be attributed to the final product DBTO2 being more polar than DBT. This makes it easier to adsorb onto the catalyst active sites at lower temperatures.
As displayed in Fig. 5(b), with the rising reaction temperature, the conversion accelerates until it reaches 65 °C. The reason for this significant improvement in conversion might be attributed to the movement of the molecules speeding up at high temperature, which may provide more reaction probability between DBT, agent oxidant, and catalyst surface due to the fact the reaction is done on the surface.47 Moreover, increasing the reaction temperature promotes the desorption of products, which makes the vacant position of the active site for new molecule oxidation because the desorption of products from the catalyst surface requires heat.
If the temperature is higher than 65 °C, the efficiency of the reaction decreases because the oxidant (H2O2) also rapidly undergoes thermal decomposition with increasing reaction temperature, such that the conversion is reduced. The thermal decomposition of the oxidizing agent (H2O2) occurs according to reaction (4): 2H2O2·→ 2H2O + O2(4)
This shows the non-productive decomposition of H2O2 to form O2 and H2O. The presence of water and oxygen molecularly reduces the efficiency. Shen et al. prepared tungsten-containing mesoporous silica as a catalyst for the oxidation of DBT and it performed at (40–70 °C), and 60 °C was found to be a satisfactory operating temperature because hydrogen peroxide decomposed at higher temperatures.48 Teimouri et al. also reported that even though the ODS reactivity was improved at first upon raising the reaction temperature, the decomposition reactant (H2O2) was dominant after 70 °C and the reaction conversion was reduced.49


3.2.3. Effect of the amount of catalyst. 
As indicated in Fig. 5(c), it is clear that increasing the catalyst weight can achieve more catalytic performance, and provided more chances for the DBT, oxidant, and catalyst to contact. The opportunity is provided for DBT, which is more easily oxidized. When the amount of catalyst is more than 0.06 g, the DBT conversion decreases because the further increase in catalyst amount (0.06 g) might provide a more active phase. However, it can either concurrently interact with counter metal ions, leading to agglomeration/clotting, or it can compete with oxidant molecules instead of oxidizing DBT, leading to a decrease in DBT conversion. On the other hand, a large amount of catalysts results in pore blocking and agglomeration, reducing the usable surface area for DBT oxidation and the conversion is reduced.12
Moreover, in the ODS process, a rich catalyst active phase and oxidizing agent resulted in the best-fit chemistry in the current oxidant-catalyst scheme, lowering the catalyst and oxidant content requirements without sacrificing the DBT conversion. Li et al. reported that the reduction of catalytic activity was due to the decrease in the contact area between DBT and the catalyst.14 Chamack et al. prepared and applied MoV/Zr/SBA as a catalyst in the ODS process (0–0.2 g), and the result revealed that 0.1 g was the best amount of catalyst. Thus, the best amount is 0.06 g for this parameter.50


3.2.4. Effect of oxidant dosage. 
Subsequently, according to the stoichiometric reaction from DBT to DBTO2, only 2 mol of H2O2 as an oxidant is required for the oxidation of 1 mol of dibenzothiophene. However, the result showed that DBT cannot be completely converted at H2O2/DBT = 2 by extending the reaction time, and H2O2 was not detected after the reaction. The reason can be credited to a little amount of decomposition of H2O2 in the reaction process.
As shown in Fig. 5(d), increasing H2O2 can raise the conversion of DBT in the ODS process. When the H2O2 dosage was 0.05 mL, which gives an oxidant/sulfur (O/S) molar ratio of 5, the ODS of dibenzothiophene was the highest value. When the H2O2 dosage was enhanced by more than 0.05 ml, the desulfurization was reduced specifically. Increasing the amount of H2O2 precipitates the oxidation of DBT, and also increases the amount of H2O, which could prevent the reaction.51 On the other hand, a high O/S molar ratio is unfavorable because of wasting the oxidant and safety risks.
Zhang et al. used H2O2 as an oxidant for the oxidation of DBT and the value of O/S was the optimal ratio. Beyond this value, the reduction of conversion was attributed to the water produced from the oxidative desulfurization process and the thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide that hindered the reaction.3 Kermani et al. reported that when the O/S molar ratio was greater than the optimum value, the efficiency decayed due to the production of water from the thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Thus, 0.05 ml was chosen as the optimum oxidant dosage.52


3.2.5. Effect of the reaction time. 
The reaction time is one of the most important parameters affecting chemical reactions. The effect of the reaction time on the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) is shown in Fig. 5(e). It is clear that as the reaction time increases, the conversion of DBT increased. Indeed, when the reaction time increased, more opportunity was provided for a contact time of DBT, oxidant, and the catalyst, so the efficiency increases. The conversion does not change after 80 minutes from the reaction time because at a constant temperature, the amount of desorption from the surface is low and the active sites are occupied with products. Therefore, the amount of active sites decreases and the conversion remains constant.
Based on the comparison of published literature for ODS of DBT as a model oil (Table 5), it can be stated that the current work's low operating temperature and low quantity of catalytic catalysts with 86.1 percent conversion is a promising step forward in the field of fuel oil desulfurization.

3.3. Effect of aromatic compounds on ODS
As with most studies, the efficiency of the fuel model and the actual model is different.58,59 This is most likely due to the presence of compounds, such as olefins and aromatics, that are also prone to oxidation, and the competitive reaction results in a decreased conversion. As shown in Fig. 6, these aromatic compounds harm the oxidation of dibenzothiophene, and the conversion is reduced steadily with incremental amounts of toluene and cyclohexanone. The result is that cyclohexanone and toluene inhibitors have a minor effect on the removal of DBT, which is useful for further study into the latest prepared catalyst in real-world applications.
 Fig. 6  Effect of the other compositions on ODS: (a) toluene, (b) cyclohexanone. 
Moreover, the efficiency was reduced sharply with the addition of cyclohexanone, which demonstrated that it has a strong negative effect on oxidative desulfurization. The reason is the competitive reaction between the oxidation of DBT and the other aromatic compounds.60
3.4. Proposed mechanism
A possible mechanism for the catalytic desulfurization of DBT in the presence of CoO/g-C3N4 catalyst will be suggested and outlined as follows, based on the literature61,62 and our findings in this study (Scheme 1). The results of the catalyst characterization by XRD showed CoO, as generally observed in calcined cobalt-based catalysts, based on the 2θ values of 37° and 43° for the (111) and (200) surfaces, respectively. Furthermore, the FT-IR spectrum of the catalyst showed strong peaks based at 493 cm−1 and 2180 cm−1, which are attributable to the CoO species. Therefore, the active sites in the catalyst are CoO.
 Scheme 1  The proposed mechanism in the oxidative desulfurization of DBT. 
The nucleophilic attack of H2O2 on the CoO bonds of cobalt (1) on the graphitic carbon nitride help produced the active metal peroxide intermediate hydroperoxomolybdate (2). The hydroperoxocobalt species then produced the peroxo species (3) during the water removal process (4). Since the electron density of the sulfur atom was higher, the oxidation of the sulfur in DBT had to be followed by a nucleophilic attack of the sulfur atom on a peroxo species to produce DBTO and recover the cobalt oxide species (1). The sulfoxide is then further oxidized in the presence of another hydrogen peroxide to form the resulting DBTO2.
4. Conclusion
In this study, CoO/g-C3N4 as a catalyst, was prepared and used for the oxidation of the model fuel. The effects of the cobalt content loaded, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, oxidant dosage, and reaction time were investigated. Under the optimal condition of the reaction temperature (65 °C), oxidant dosage (0.05 ml), amount of catalyst (0.06 g), cobalt content (wt%, 45%), the conversion reached 87.4% in 80 minutes. Moreover, the result showed that the cobalt loaded (wt%) was the most effective parameter, among other parameters. The significant order of the main effective parameters on the ODS is as follows: Co loading (wt%) > temperature > reaction time > amount of catalyst > oxidant dosage. Finally, cyclohexanone, as an aromatic compound decreased strongly the conversion, and demonstrated that it harms the ODS process.
