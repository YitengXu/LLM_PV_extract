    , Accepted 11th September 2018First published on 14th September 2018AbstractEndohedral metallofullerenes and phthalocyanine derivatives are recognized as excellent active materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The tri-metallic nitride endohedral C80 fullerenes have greater absorption coefficients in the visible region and electron-accepting abilities similar to C60, which can allow for higher efficiencies in OPV devices. In this work, we have investigated the ground and charge transfer excited states of two co-facial donor–acceptor (D–A) molecular conjugates formed by the non-covalent coupling of trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerene (Sc3N@Ih–C80) with metal-free (H2Pc) and zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) chromophores using DFT calculations. The charge transfer (CT) excitation energies are calculated using the perturbative delta-SCF method that enforces orthogonality between the ground and excited states. The binding energies calculated using the PBE and DFT-D3 methods indicate that the dispersion effects play an important role in the stabilization of these complexes. The ground state dipole moment of the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyad is much larger than that of Sc3N@C80–ZnPc, but this is reversed in the excited state where the dipole moment of Sc3N@C80–ZnPc increases significantly. The lowest few excitation energies in the gas phase for the two complexes are very close, in the range of 1.51–2.66 eV for Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and 1.51–2.71 eV for the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc complex. However, the lower ionization potential and lower exciton binding energy make the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc dyad a better candidate for OPVs as compared to the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyad.
I. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent a class of cost-effective, lightweight solar energy conversion technology for long term sustainable energy production, which has attracted much scientific attention in recent years.1–3 Substantial progress has been made in increasing the power conversion efficiencies of OPVs by the development of novel donor–acceptor (D–A) blends, utilization of new device architectures, and the use of interfacial materials for improved charge-carrier collection.3–7 However, the power conversion efficiency of OPVs is still much smaller than their inorganic counterparts owing to poor material properties like low charge carrier mobilities, poor band offsets and low dielectric constants.8 It is well established that the open circuit voltage (VOC) in OPVs is linearly dependent on the energetic difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor, viz., the donor–acceptor effective energy gap.9–14 In general, only a small fraction of the incident solar irradiation is harvested by the organic materials due to their large band gaps. Consequently, alignment of LUMO and HOMO levels of the donor and acceptor plays a crucial role in determining the performance of solar cells. Hence, increasing the open circuit voltage by choosing efficient and appropriate D–A pairs is a relevant and active area of research.
Metal containing endohedral fullerenes or endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) have attracted particular interest as electron acceptors in D–A dyads due to their unique structure and properties.15,16 Apart from their higher absorption coefficients in the visible region and low reorganization energies, the ability to fine-tune their HOMO–LUMO gaps by varying the nature and composition of the encapsulated species makes them excellent candidates as electron acceptors.17,18 Since the discovery of a trimetallic nitride template endohedral metallofullerene by Stevenson et al. in 1999,19 a variety of other endohedral families with different types of endohedral units has been synthesized and characterized. EMFs of the type M3N@C80 (M = Sc, Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Lu) possess a reduced donor/acceptor LUMO offset and hence offer the possibility of dramatically increasing the power conversion efficiency.20 The stability and unusual reactivity of nitride EMFs can be explained using an ionic model that considers a charge transfer of up to six electrons from the endohedral species to the carbon cage, leading to a (M3N)6+@(C2n)6− species. Ross et al.20,21 cleared a path towards higher power conversion efficiencies in OPV devices by synthesizing Lu3N@C80 and incorporating its derivative, phenyl-Lu3N@C81 butyric hexyl ester (also known as Lu3N@C80–PCBH), as the acceptor in a P3HT/Lu3N@C80–PCBH device with an VOC of 890 mV, the highest reported VOC for any P3HT-fullerence device. This work initiated the development of a series of covalently linked D–A systems containing conjugates of endohedral fullerenes with a myriad of acceptors such as ferrocenes, triphenylamines, porphyrins, corroles and tetrafulvalenes.22–28 Non-bonding interactions like hydrogen bonding,29–31 electrostatic interactions,32 π–π stacking33–35 and metal coordination36 have also been efficiently utilized as an excellent alternative to the covalent approach for the construction of novel functional electron D–A systems. For instance, the radical ion pair, viz., (ZnPc)˙+–(C60)˙−, in the ZnPc/C60 D–A architecture formed by biomimetic organization principles37 has been found to be about three orders of magnitude longer-lived compared to similar covalently linked ZnPc–C60 conjugates.38 More recently, several examples of EMF based D–A conjugates have been reported where the EMF acts as an electron donor when covalently linked to electron accepting moieties like tetracyanoanthraquinodimehane,39 perylene-diimides40,41 and subphthalocyanines.42 A very recent report by Guldi et al.43 highlighted the amphoteric nature of EMFs, acting both as electron-acceptor and electron-donor, where the activation of the oxidative and/or reductive electron-transfer reactions is simply by the electronic nature of its counterpart.
Owing to their outstanding electronic and photophysical properties, fullerene derivatives as electron accepting units in combination with porphyrin/phthalocyanine derivatives as electron donors appear particularly promising. Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are highly π-conjugated porphyrin analogs that are capable of binding a variety of transition metals within their central cavity, thus leaving the axial positions available for binding with a variety of ligands. Bruder et al.44 examined a series of bilayer heterojunction solar cells employing C60 as n-conducting and CuPc, FePc, NiPc or ZnPc as p-conducting organic layers and identified the ZnPc based device as the best performing metal phthalocyanine among their probed cells. Recently, Wolfrum et al.45 showed that electron transfer reactions between ZnP as an electron donor and Sc3N@C80 as an electron acceptor promote long-range charge transfer events with lifetimes in the range of microseconds. This is longer than most other organic dyads or solar cells where the exciton lifetimes range from the picosecond to nanosecond range. However, extra long lifetimes from seconds to days have also been achieved through multistep charge transfer processes in supramolecular structures with several components.46–49 These recent experiments have shown that through careful rational design, it is possible to achieve very long lifetimes comparable to those in bacterial photosynthetic centers.
In a previous work,50 we carried out DFT calculations on the ground and excited state electronic structures of two D–A complexes in which Sc3N@C80 and Y3N@C80 molecules were coupled with Zn-tetraphenyl porphyrin (ZnTPP) and showed that the charge transfer excited state energies of endohedral fullerene–ZnTPP dyads are larger than those of C60–ZnTPP and C70–ZnTPP dyads. In this work, we study the electronic and charge transfer excited state properties of D–A dyads made by pairing Sc3N@C80 with two members of the phthalocyanine (Pc) family, viz., the free base (H2Pc) and zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc). ZnPc has been used in organic photovoltaics before, but in this study, we also include H2Pc to understand the role of the metal center in the phthalocyanine. The photovoltaic properties of H2Pc were recognized decades ago.51,52 The photovoltaic properties of H2Pc with C60 show strong structural effects.53,54 The CT excitation energies are calculated using our perturbative delta-SCF method that has been shown to be a reliable approach for this purpose. The effect of changing the donor component on the ground state and excited state electronic structures of the D–A dyads with Sc3N@C80 as the acceptor is analyzed.
II. Computational method
The geometry optimization of the isolated Sc3N@Ih–C80 and ZnPc/H2Pc molecules as well as the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc/H2Pc complexes was performed at the all-electron level using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof55 (PBE) exchange correlation function using the NRLMOL code.56–59 We employed icosahedral C80 or Ih–C80 for the calculations since it has been reported as the most stable isomer of the outer C80 cage among various Sc3N@C80 isomers.17 The Sc3N unit in Sc3N@Ih–C80 interacts with the icosahedral C80 cage through ionic interactions and can rotate freely within the C80 cage. Five different orientations of Sc3N cluster in the icosahedral cage have been reported previously by Dorn et al.60 We used an arbitrary orientation of Sc3N with respect to the plane of ZnPc or H2Pc for the calculations, since our previous work50 indicated that the orientation of the endohedral unit does not significantly affect the CT state energies. The NRLMOL default basis set, optimized for the PBE exchange–correlation energy functional, was used for all the calculations. It has been shown to correctly satisfy the Z10/3 rule for Gaussian basis sets, where Z is the atomic number, so that the basis set superposition errors are minimized.61 The binding energies of the complexes were calculated using the supramolecular approach, i.e., interaction energy of the complex = energy of the complex − energy of the reactants optimized separately.
Here, the binding energy, EBE = ESc3N@C80−ZnPc/H2Pc − (EZnPc/H2Pc + ESc3N@C80).
Since the complexes are bound by van der Waals interactions, DFT-D3 parameters62 with the Becke–Johnson damping model as implemented in the NRLMOL code were used for calculating the binding energies. The vertical ionization energies (vIEs) were calculated as the energy difference between the neutral molecule and positively charged molecule while vertical electron affinities (vEAs) were calculated as the energy difference between the neutral molecule and negatively charged molecule where the molecular geometry of the two states is the same. The quasi-particle gap (QP) was calculated from the difference between ionization potential and electron affinities thus calculated, and the exciton binding energy (EBE) was calculated as the difference between the quasi-particle gap and the optical gap where the optical gap is the same as the HOMO–LUMO excitation energy.
The charge transfer excited states were obtained using the perturbative delta-SCF method,63,64 which is a variant of the standard delta-SCF approaches. The delta-SCF approximation places one or more electrons in high lying Kohn–Sham orbitals, instead of placing all electrons in the lowest possible orbitals as one does while calculating the ground state energy in standard DFT calculations. The perturbative delta-SCF method, developed in our lab and implemented in the NRLMOL code, enforces an orthogonality constraint between the ground state and excited state determinantal wavefunctions. In this method, the occupied orbitals are relaxed using the first order perturbation method where the perturbation Hamiltonian is the change in the ground state Hamiltonian due to the rigid shift of an electron from the hole to the particle orbital. The occupied orbitals are relaxed in the space of unoccupied orbitals while the hole orbitals are relaxed in the space of occupied orbitals. This constraint enforces the strict orthogonality between the ground and excited state wavefunctions. The perturbative delta-SCF method has been shown to accurately describe the CT excitations of several molecular D–A dyads and triads.65,66 Furthermore, previous benchmark calculations50 on a set of small D–A pairs have shown that this method in conjunction with the pure GGA functional can yield results with accuracy comparable to that of the TDDFT method employing range-separated functionals. The charge transfer excitation energy for the donor–acceptor complexes was estimated using Mulliken's formula67 as IP − EA − 1/R within the point charge approximation, where IP and EA are the ionization potential of the donor and electron affinity of the acceptor, respectively and R is the particle–hole separation. The 1/R term is the Coulomb energy originating from the electrostatic interaction between the charged donor and acceptor species.
All the calculations performed here are in the gas phase, although in practice, the D–A pairs are placed in a solvent like toluene, chloroform or benzonitrile. It may be noted that the excitation energies may change slightly due to polarization effects in solution or in aggregated form.
III. Results and discussion
The dyads studied in this work are in co-facial orientation and are bound together by van der Waals interactions. Sc3N@Ih–C80 is the most abundant metallo-fullerene obtained as a single isomer and can be readily purified by non-chromatographic methods. The optimized geometry of Sc3N@Ih–C80 displays a trigonal planar geometry for the entrapped Sc3N cluster similar to the available experimental reports. The icosahedral cage of Sc3N@C80 has a radius of 4.11 Å and displays two types of C–C bonds, viz., the 5:6 bonds, abutted by a hexagon and a pentagon and the 6:6 bonds, abutted by two hexagons. The average bond lengths for the 5:6 and 6:6 bonds were found to be 1.45 and 1.43 Å, respectively while the average Sc–N bond length is 2.04 Å. Fig. 1 presents the optimized geometries of the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyads. The smallest surface-to-surface distance between the fullerene cage and ZnPc in the optimized geometry of the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc dyad is 3.17 Å and that for the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyad is 3.16 Å. It can be seen that the orientation of the endohedral Sc3N unit is not altered in both complexes during the optimization. As mentioned in the computational methods, the binding energy of the complexes was calculated using the Becke–Johnson damping model to account for the dispersion contribution. The binding energy values are reported in Table 1. The energies of the complexes calculated at various separations show a shallow flat potential well.

The complexes studied here are bound mainly by van der Waals interaction. The calculated binding energies at the PBE level of approximation and those with inclusion of van der Waals interaction are presented in Table 1. It is evident that dispersion plays an important role in the stabilization of the dyads. The binding energies for the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyads are 0.44 eV and 0.42 eV, respectively, at the DFT-D3 level. The binding energies indicate slightly greater stabilization of the dyad with the zinc coordinated phthalocyanine donor compared to the one with the free-base phthalocyanine donor.
The DFT calculated vertical ionization potential (vIP) and vertical electron affinity (vEA) of these two systems along with their isolated components are reported in Table 1. The calculated electron affinity of Sc3N@C80 at the PBE level is 2.49 eV, which differs by ∼0.32 eV from the experimental electron affinity reported by Ioffe and coworkers.70 Using the Knudsen cell mass spectrometry ion-molecular equilibria method, Ioffe et al. reported the experimental electron affinity of Sc3N@C80 in the gas-phase to be 2.81 ± 0.05 eV in a temperature range of 914–1016 K. The discrepancy between the experimental and the calculated values might be due to the fact that the experimental measurements were performed at high temperature while our calculations were performed at T = 0 K. Further, as reported in our previous study,50 the use of different density functionals can result in variation of the electron affinity by as much as 0.6 eV, with a general trend that inclusion of the Hartree–Fock exchange leads to a reduction in its value. The present methodology accurately predicts the electron affinities of C60 and C70 fullerenes (ref. 64–66). The calculated vertical ionization potentials for ZnPc and H2Pc are 6.35 and 6.39 eV, respectively, which are in close agreement with the results of gas-phase photoelectron spectroscopy experiments71 for the vertical ionization potentials of ZnPc (6.37 eV) and H2Pc (6.41 eV). A comparison of the vIP values in the isolated donors and the D–A dyads indicates that the HOMO levels of ZnPc and H2Pc are raised by 0.24 eV and 0.23 eV, respectively, as they couple with Sc3N@C80 forming the complexes. On the other hand, the LUMO of Sc3N@C80 is lowered by 0.12 eV in Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and 0.15 eV in Sc3N@C80–H2Pc. The smaller ionization potential for Sc3N@C80–ZnPc (6.12 eV) compared with Sc3N@C80–H2Pc (6.17 eV) is consistent with the observation by Torres et al.72 that Zn-containing complexes are easier to oxidize than their Zn-free analogues. The quasi-particle gap calculated as the difference between vIP and vEA is nearly of the same magnitude for both the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyads with values of 3.50 and 3.53 eV, respectively (cf.Table 1).
The HOMO–LUMO gap, calculated as the difference between eigenvalues, is 1.44 eV at the PBE level for the isolated Sc3N@C80 fullerene, suggesting a noticeable chemical stability similar to C60. This value is close to that obtained earlier by Zhu et al.73 using pseudopotentials. The HOMO of Sc3N@C80 is spread over the C80 cage whereas the LUMO is spread over both the cage and the Sc3N unit.50 The ground state HOMO–LUMO gaps for the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc complexes are 1.14 eV and 1.32 eV, respectively. However, the HOMO–LUMO gap as obtained from the Kohn–Sham eigenvalues does not present the correct corresponding excitation energies for two reasons. Firstly, because the Kohn–Sham DFT underestimates the band (fundamental) gap due to missing derivative discontinuity. This is the case even if the exact exchange–correlation functional is employed. In practical calculations, such as those employed, the self-interaction correction also affects the eigenvalue spectrum resulting in a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap. Secondly, the HOMO–LUMO gap also does not provide an estimate of the optical gap as particle–hole interactions are missed.66

Fig. 2 illustrates the ground state density of states (DOS) of the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyads projected on their corresponding components in the left and right panels, respectively. The red line indicates the Fermi energy level that separates the occupied states on the left from the unoccupied states on the right. The DOS plots show a good number of low-lying closely spaced unoccupied molecular orbitals above the LUMO level for the complexes, which are inherited from the Sc3N@C80 molecule. The HOMO is located on the donor component, viz., ZnPc or H2Pc, in both the complexes whereas the LUMO orbital localization is different in both. In Sc3N@C80–ZnPc, the LUMO orbital is localized solely on Sc3N@C80 while in Sc3N@C80–H2Pc, the LUMO is delocalized on both Sc3N@C80 and H2Pc components. Thus, the HOMO to LUMO transition corresponds to a charge transfer excited state in the ZnPc complex, which is in agreement with the earlier observations on Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP and Y3N@C80–ZnTPP dyads.50 The HOMO–LUMO transition in the H2Pc complex is the result of a partial charge transfer (since there is a non-zero overlap between the particle and the hole orbitals). Furthermore, the lowest three LUMOs (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) are degenerate in this dyad. Another noticeable feature of these complexes is the high lying occupied states of Sc3N@C80 fullerene, as can be seen from the DOS plot.

An important parameter that determines the efficiency of the photovoltaic device is the open-circuit voltage, which is proportional to the charge-transfer excitation energy. The excitation energies (both singlet and triplet excited state energies of the single particle excitations) of several low-lying excited states of the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyads are listed in Table 2. We carried out the calculations of the excited states corresponding to the transitions from HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 to the lowest four LUMOs. Due to the hybridization between the orbitals of the donor and acceptor moieties, there are very few states that are purely charge transfer states with nearly zero transition dipole moment. The transitions that correspond to local excitations and partial charge transfer excitations are indicated with one and two asterisks, respectively, in the table. The singlet excited state energy (ES) was calculated using the prescribed Ziegler–Rauk method,74 which determines ES as ES = 2EM − ET, where EM and ET are the excitation energies of the mixed and triplet states. The LUMO in Sc3N@C80 is a nondegenerate orbital whereas the next higher unoccupied orbitals have double or near degeneracies. All the indicated transitions are optically allowed with HOMO to LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 transitions having the highest probability of occurrence in both complexes. Our orthogonality constrained delta-SCF method gives the optical gap of 1.52 eV for the isolated Sc3N@C80. This energy corresponds to the HOMO to LUMO transitions in the fullerene, which are very weak in intensity. This result is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured optical gap of 1.51 eV by Dunsch et al.75

The excitations from HOMO and HOMO−1 to the lowest three LUMOs of both the complexes are also presented schematically in Fig. 3 and 4. In both complexes, the HOMO is located on the phthalocyanine but HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 are on the fullerene. Similarly, LUMO and LUMO+3 mainly arise from the fullerene in both complexes but LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 are located on the phthalocyanine. The DFT calculated singlet excitation energies lie within a range of 1.51–2.66 eV for the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc complex and 1.51–2.71 eV for the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc complex. The lowest excitation energy at 1.51 eV corresponds to excitation of Sc3N@C80 in the ZnPc complex but H2Pc in the H2Pc-containing complex. The energies of the lowest two excited states involving significant charge transfer from ZnPc to Sc3N@C80–ZnPc are 1.93 and 2.14 eV. In the H2Pc analogue, the lowest excitation with significant CT character is at 1.63 eV that corresponds to the HOMO–LUMO excitation. On the other hand, the reverse charge transfer excitations involving charge transfer from fullerene to phthalocyanine are seen at 2.20 eV and 1.93 eV for the ZnPc and H2Pc containing complexes, respectively. Previously, Basurto et al.50 reported the lowest CT excitation energies for two isomers of Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP as 2.11 eV and 2.16 eV. Our present results suggest a lowering in the CT excitation energy as Sc3N@C80 fullerene couples with ZnPc/H2Pc compared to its coupling with Zn tetraphenyl porphyrin. To check the effects of different orientations of the Sc3N unit on the CT energies in the H2Pc complex, we calculated the CT energies with an orientation that is parallel to the plane of the phthalocyanine. We found that our earlier observation holds for H2Pc complexes as well where the CT energies change on the order of a few hundredths of eV (0.01–0.05 eV). Overall, the Q-band excitations of the donor moieties are unlikely to lead to charge transfer to the fullerene moiety. Higher excitations are needed to achieve charge transfer to the fullerene. Trukhina et al. earlier prepared N-pyridyl substituted Sc3N@Ih–C80 axially attached to ZnPc.43 They found that electron transfer occurs from the ZnPc to the fullerene when the ZnPc is electron rich but the reverse can also happen if the ZnPc is electron deficient.43 Their electrochemical measurements in dichlorobenzene gave an estimate of 1.20 eV or 1.81 eV for the ZnPc to fullerene charge transfer excited state for the electron-rich and electron-deficient complexes, respectively. For these systems, the reverse electron transfer excited states are at 1.79 eV and 0.94 eV, respectively.43 A direct comparison of our results with the experimental values presented in ref. 43 is not possible since in the experiment of Trukhina et al.,43 derivatives of ZnPc and Sc3N@C80 are used. Moreover, the solvent effects and ionic relaxations are also not accounted for in the theoretical calculations. Both of these effects tend to stabilize the energies of the charge transfer states. The relaxation of the fullerene in the anionic state is small, leading to small ionic relaxation effects on the charge transfer energies. The solvent polarization effects on the other hand will be stronger. The incorporation of the solvent polarization effects will be pursued in a future work.

The ground state dipole moment near the equilibrium separation of the supramolecular D–A pairs indicates the formation of interfacial dipoles, which facilitate orbital alignments that lead to better exciton dissociation. The interfacial dipole originates predominantly from polarization effects or from the ground state charge transfer from the donor to acceptor. The ground state charge transfer reduces as the D–A components get farther away and the polarization effect becomes entirely responsible for the dipole formation at large separations.65 Based on experimental reports68 on the co-sublimated thin films of ZnPc and C60 at room temperature, the ground state appears to be an intrinsic charge transfer state with partial charge transfer from the ZnPc moiety to C60, whereas some other experiments69 claim no evidence of ground state charge transfer in the C60–H2Pc system. Our calculated dipole moments for the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc complexes are 0.32 and 1.4 Debye, respectively. The dipole moment tends to approach zero as the fragments of the dyads get farther away from each other. Although it is observed that the ground state dipole moment of the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc complex is nearly four times larger than that of the other dyad, this is interestingly reversed in the excited state involving the HOMO to LUMO transition as the dipole moment values are increased to 23.5 D and 8.7 D for the fullerene–ZnPc/H2Pc complexes, respectively. This can be explained by the fact that an overlap is observed between the hole and particle orbitals in the excited Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyad corresponding to the HOMO–LUMO transition for which the dipole moment values are reported.
Earlier experimental investigations76 on a series of D–A complexes, using C60 and C70 as acceptors and tetra-tert-butylphthalocyanine (H2TBPc) and its zinc derivative (ZnTBPc) as donors in solution, suggested higher efficiencies for electron transfer from ZnTBPc to C60 (or C70). However, the lifetimes of the ion radicals of C60–H2TBPc and C70–H2TBPc compounds were shown to be longer than those of C60–ZnTBPc and C70–ZnTBPc. A similar observation was made by Guldi et al.38 in their studies on C60–ZnPc (or H2Pc) dyads. Although the calculated excitation energies tabulated in Table 2 seem to be very close for the two dyads, we should keep in mind that there are many other factors contributing to the overall performance of OPVs. The exciton binding energies for the lowest CT transitions from phthalocyanine to fullerene in the ZnPc and H2Pc dyads are 1.57 and 1.90 eV, respectively (Table 1). The higher exciton binding energy of the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyad makes the charge separation step more challenging, making it a less favorable candidate. As discussed before, the ionization potential for the ZnPc dyad is smaller. This makes the oxidation step easier for this dyad compared with Sc3N@C80–H2Pc. Thus, from all the above mentioned facts, viz., the smaller ionization potential, lower exciton binding energy and the available experimental results, we expect a better cell performance for the dyad employing ZnPc as the donor moiety.
In summary, we have studied the ground and excited state electronic properties of two non-covalently bound co-facial D–A molecular conjugates, Sc3N@C80–ZnPc and Sc3N@C80–H2Pc, in which Sc3N@C80 fullerene acts as the acceptor and Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc)/Zn-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) plays the role of the donor. Our results on the electronic structure show that the interaction between the Sc3N@C80 fullerene and the zinc- and metal-free phthalocyanines is different. The ground state dipole moment of the Sc3N@C80–H2Pc dyad is much larger than that of Sc3N@C80–ZnPc. The values of the lowest CT excitation energies for the two complexes differ by 0.3 eV. This is in contrast to the results obtained with C60 and C70 fullerenes with ZnTPP and TPP, where the choice of acceptor component rather than the donor, i.e. C60vs. C70, produced larger effects on the CT energies. Overall, the role of the metal center is pronounced in the phthalocyanine based compounds. Considering other factors like the ionization potentials and exciton binding energies, a better performance may be expected for the Sc3N@C80–ZnPc dyad.
