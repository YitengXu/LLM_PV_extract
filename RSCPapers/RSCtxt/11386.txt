    , Accepted 9th February 2012First published on 10th February 2012AbstractThe research field of photovoltaics is booming due to the recognised imperative to realise a long term solutions to clean and inexpensive power generation. With this rapid growth in activity, new concepts and new directions, it is becoming more and more important to be able to effectively compare technological advances made in different research groups, and between the different competing technologies. In this article it is illustrated how challenging it can be to fairly asses the efficiency of a solar cell. Specific examples of how much of an influence a range of measurement practices can have on the estimated short-circuit photocurrents and efficiencies are shown for a number of the most commonly researched excitonic solar cell concepts. In the worst case scenario, systematic overestimations by a factor of 5 can be made. For completeness, the influence of the light source, and the correct method to properly calibrate a solar simulator and estimate the spectral mismatch factor is also described. The error in calibrating the light source is actually likely to lead to a much smaller variance than the definition of the active area of the solar cell. The undeniable implication is that it is essential for excitonic solar cells to be correctly masked to define the active area, if the measured efficiency is to bear a true resemblance of the device performance. Adoption of standard protocols across the field will enable a much better comparison between literature values of efficiency and more rapid and well directed technological advancement will occur.

Broader context
Power conversion efficiency is the “currency” by which advances in solar technologies are judged. Increasingly so, “record” power conversion efficiencies are desirable for high impact publications and as such there is a significant pressure upon the field to constantly improve the efficiency and compete with the best-in-class. However, the protocols used to measure the solar cells in research labs are far from standard and specifically defining the active area of the solar cell is broadly ambiguous. Here, real examples of a range of excitonic solar cells, namely electrolyte based and solid-state dye-sensitized and polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction, are measured following the range of practices routinely adopted. It becomes apparent that in the worst case scenario five-fold photocurrent overestimations can be made. Calibration of the solar simulator and considerations when setting up the testing apparatus are also discussed, to give a broad overview of the major issues and important considerations when assessing solar cell performance. If the issues addressed in this article are considered by researchers, reviewers and editors alike, it is likely that a fairer comparison between new innovations will be made, which will result in a more effective rapid advancement of the technologies.

Introduction
Photovoltaics is becoming an increasingly popular field of research with an ever growing number of research groups turning their hand to developing materials and devices for new and exciting solar cell concepts. The standards for solar cell measurement and testing protocol have been set for a long time.1 Many of these standards have been transferred to the laboratory measurement of excitonic solar cells, which includes organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaics (OPV),2dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC),3 and hybrid solar cells (HSC).4–6 When new materials and systems are being developed and variations in parameter space are being explored, it is necessary to assess their overall impact upon solar to electrical power conversion efficiency. It is not expected that this growing community has a similarly rigorous testing protocol as the certified national testing facilities. However, despite a number of previous articles addressing common measurement errors,7–11 relatively unstandardized testing protocols are still adopted across the field which has led to a broad spread of efficiency reports in the literature and an unknown level of uncertainty. Since there is a significant pressure on enhanced device efficiency leading to high impact scientific output, it is ever more important that scientists and reviewers alike are fully versed in acceptable methods for measurements, and understand the level of potential error introduced by the measurement procedures. There are a number of articles describing the correct measurement protocols for excitionic solar cells, some examples of which are referenced here,7–11 however previous reports do not clearly illustrate the potential scale of the measurement error, nor show direct examples for a range of excitonic solar cells to illustrate the hazards across the community. Furthermore, there remains an on-going stream of solar cell articles where the simulated solar measurement conditions are unclear, and hence a report clearly identifying the issues is required.
In this article measurement data is shown on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), both liquid and solid, and polymer fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells measured under AM1.5 G simulated sun light with a range of different masking configurations. It becomes very apparent that to be certain that the active area of the solar cell is not underestimated, for all the technologies tested the solar cells must be masked with a non-transparent optical mask apart from a single aperture in the mask of well-defined area which is taken to be the total active area of the solar cell. The mask must be suitably large as to cover the whole of the device substrate, and used in conjunction with a light tight sample holder or extra masking of the edge of the device should be employed to prevent “light piping”, where scattered or reflected light can significantly increases the illumination on the active region of the cell. By showing comparatively measured examples, it is clear that this is an extremely important issue, and in the worst case scenario inappropriate masking can lead to greater than a 5-fold overestimation in the photocurrent generated under simulated sun light. After identifying a suitably accurate way to measure the solar cells, for completeness and in order to illustrate the relative scale of the two issues, the calibration of the solar simulator light source is addressed, which in fact leads to much smaller errors provided a suitably spatially uniform illumination source is employed.
Measuring your solar cell
In the first part of this article the light source output spectra is assumed to be a “perfectly” calibrated AM1.5G light source with no spectral mismatch.12 Though, unlike real sun light, the divergence of even the best solar simulators is in the order of 8° which has a surprisingly large effect on the measurements. If the light source is perfectly calibrated in spectrum and the test cell is in the correct location such that the equivalent solar light intensity incident upon the cell is precisely 100 mWcm−2, then the only parameter left to specify is the active area of the solar cell. This should be relatively simple, however there is not a consistent practice employed in the community to define this. Common methods used to define the cell area include: 1. Assuming the active area to be the overlapping area between the bottom transparent conducting oxide and the top metallic contact (polymer and hybrid). 2. Assuming the active area to be the area of the printed dye-sensitized metal oxide dot (DSCs). 3. Masking the solar cells with a non-transparent mask with a number of apertures and different cells on a single substrate. 4. Masking the solar cells with a non-transparent mask with a single aperture. 5. Additionally to 4, taking care that the edges of the solar cells are masked to ensure that no light can enter the solar cell (typically on a glass substrate) from the side. Below current voltage characteristics for a range of different excitonic solar cells are presented, employing these different masking configurations.
Liquid electrolyte based dye-sensitized solar cells
For details on the concept, device structure and development directions for liquid electrolyte based DSCs please see the following review article.3 Liquid electrolyte based DSCs are generally composed of a “dot” of mesoporous TiO2 which acts as the photoanode when dye-sensitized. A photograph of such a cell is shown in Fig. 1a. The common measurement mistake here is to assume that the active area can be taken as the projected surface area of the screen-printed TiO2 dot.9 Unfortunately, due to the cavity structure in the glass-glass DSC laminate, and the light source never being perfectly collimated, “light-piping” results in significantly more light absorbed in the TiO2 dot, than would be expected to be the case. A further consideration which must be made is that a significant fraction of the light incident on the cut glass edges is scattered into the cavity, and ends up being absorbed in the dye-sensitized TiO2. Furthermore, if there are any reflective surfaces beneath or near the solar cell, then light can be scattered off these and into the device. In Fig. 1a photographs of the different masking conditions are shown. The terminology is None, is for no mask, Mask is for the single aperture mask but without consideration of masking the sides of the solar cell, Mask + Edge (or Mask + E) is for a single aperture mask with the edges of the cell also screened from light (in this instance with black tape). Also shown is a cell side-on where the cell is mounted at 90° to the illumination source and not masked. In Fig. 1b shows current voltage curves for a single representative high efficiency DSC measured under the different masking conditions, and orientation. The solar cell performance parameters extracted from the JV curves are shown in Table 1. Unmasked, the photocurrent density is estimated to be 27 mAcm−2 with an efficiency of 15%. Unexpectedly, when masked carefully, but not taking care to prevent light from entering the side of the device, the estimated photocurrent density goes up to 36 mAcm−2 and the efficiency correspondingly to over 20%. The measured current at short-circuit (Isc) for this specific cell, reduced from 7.72 mA unmasked to 3.85 mA when masked. However, the assumed active area reduces by a larger fraction from 0.283 cm−2 (TiO2 printed dot) to 0.108 cm−2 (mask aperture), resulting in an overall increase in the estimated short-circuit current density (mAcm−2). This emphasises the scale of the issue of scattered, reflected or divergent light entering the side of the device and being guided into the active region of the cell. When measured correctly with a mask and the edge screened, the net photocurrent reduced to 1.94 mA and the estimated photocurrent density to 18.4 mA/cm−2, giving an efficiency of 10.4%. This illustrates that in this instance 1.9 mA of current is generated from the light entering the edge of the device. Clearly having the mask area as close as possible to the printed dye-sensitized TiO2 dot projected area will minimise the impact of this error on the estimated short-circuit current density.9 However, in the worst case scenario the possible overestimation of efficiency for electrolyte based DSCs is of the order of a factor of 2, but more commonly, unmasked cells will result in an overestimation of around 1½. Simply as an amusing illustration of the light piping effect, holding an electrolyte based DSC on its side still results in a significant generation of photocurrent, the photocurrent (not photocurrent density) for this device side-on is 3.20 mA, as compared to 7.72 mA when flat and unmasked. The area taken is arbitrary since the side-on projection of the 10 micron thick mesoporous film is clearly not the equivalent active area.
 Fig. 1  (a) Photographs of a liquid electrolyte based DSCs with different masking configurations, including no mask and set on its side. The active area of the “None” is taken to be the area of screen printed dye-sensitized TiO2 dot, Mask and Mask + Edge taken to be the area of the square mask aperture, and “side-on” to be the same as None. (b) Current–voltage curves for a liquid electrolyte based DSC (iodide/triiodie redox couple in acetonitrile/varionitrile solvent) measured under simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100mWcm-2 in the different masking configurations (the active area taken for the side-on cell is the same as the unmasked cell, namely 0.283 cm2. 
Table 1 Performance parameters for the excitonic solar cells measured under AM1.5G simulated sun light at 100mWcm−2. +E indicates that the edges of the cell substrate are masked-off to prevent light piping. “Area” is the perceived area of the cell and “Effective Area” is the actual equivalent active area inferred by comparing the short-circuit current of the same cell correctly masked. The most accurately masked cell configuration is indicated in bold.

Solid-state DSCs employing spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporter
For a detailed description of solid-state DSCs please see the following review.13 Small molecular based solid-state DSCs are typically fabricated on fluorine doped tin oxide glass (FTO) coated with dye-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 infiltrated with spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporter and capped with a metallic electrode. Typical device substrates will have a number of individual devices on them, and here a typical substrate pattern with three individual cells per substrate is shown.
In Fig. 2a, Schematics and photographs of solid-state DSCs with differing masking configurations are shown. The terminology is (ii) None for no mask, where the active area is defined by the spatial overlap of the FTO anode and metal cathode, (iii) stripe for a single stripe mask with the depth of the overlap between the FTO and silver defined by the metal mask, but the width of each cell defined by the width of the evaporated top silver electrodes, (iv) 3-cell for a mask with 3 individual apertures defining the area, one covering each individual cell, and (v) single-cell for a single aperture over the central device. As with the electrolyte cell, (vi) Edge or E implies that the edges of the substrate have been masked off to prevent light piping. In Fig. 2b the current voltage curves measured under simulated sun light of 100 mWcm−2 are shown, the extracted performance parameters are presented in Table 1.
 Fig. 2  a) Schematics and photographs of masking configurations for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (SDSCs) and other solid-state excitonic solar cells. The substrate patterning and cell layout for the results presented in this work is such that there are 3 devices per 1.4 × 1.4 cm glass substrate illustrated in i. The dashed squares in i, ii, and iii identify the “active area” of the central solar cell. For the unmasked devices the active area is defined as the overlap area between the FTO anode and the silver cathode. The dashed lines in v and vi indicate the edge of the glass substrate. A more ideal layout only has one larger active device per glass substrate, as illustrated in vii, viii, and ix. b) Current voltage curves measured under AM1.5 simulated sun light at 100mWcm−2 equivalent intensity for a solid-state DSC employing spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporter. The masking configuration is indicated in the legend. 
Since there is not a large cavity between two sheets of FTO and the conductivity of both the mesoporous TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD is relatively low, the severity of the masking effects is not as significant as for electrolyte based DSCs. However, there is still an overestimation in photocurrent density by around 14% or a factor of 1.2 if the cell is not masked at all. Though relatively small, this makes a difference in absolute power conversion efficiency of around 0.5% (i.e. 4.0 to 3.5%).
The influence of PEDOT:PSS as a hole-collecting interlayer
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a p-type conducting polymer commonly used as a hole-collection interlayer in bulk heterojunction and hybrid solar cells. It is well know that highly conductive PEDOT:PSS can induce significant errors in device area estimations in bulk heterojunction cells.14 Despite this clear message however, PEDOT:PSS is still used with ambiguous cell area definition, for example with the active area being estimated by taking the areal overlap between the metal top electrode and the FTO or ITO conducting glass. The main error in this estimation is that the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS can be suitably high such that charge can be collected around the edges of the electrodes,14 either by increasing the effective area of the conducting oxide if used in the conventional structure for bulk heterojunction, or the metal top electrode if used in inverted BHJs, solid-state DSCs or HSCs. Clearly this error will be much more severe with highly conductive PEDOT:PSS, as compared to the low conductivity PEDOT:PSS commonly employed in polymer LEDs. Here, the severe influence of PEDOT:PSS is illustrated by showing different masking conditions for solid-state DSCs employing spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporter and PEDOT:PSS (Clevios CPP 105 DM) as a top hole-collection interlayer. The terminology and masking configuration is the same as for the solid-state DSC above. In Fig. 3 the current–voltage curves are shown for cells under different masking configurations, with the extracted performance parameters shown in Table 1. Staggeringly, the presence of the PEDOT:PSS enables photocurrent to be collected from almost the entirety of the substrate area, turning the whole of the top surface of the device into one large electrode. Similarly to the electrolyte based DSC, light entering the side of the substrate is also extremely significant. In this instance a relatively low light intensity entering the sides of the substrate, can be active on a large area (∼0.6 cm−2), contributing almost as much to the photocurrent as the full sun illumination on the small central aperture (0.12cm−2). This is the worst case scenario from this study, where the overestimation in the photocurrent density is as high as a factor of 5.4. Here however the fill factor does suffer, resulting in an efficiency overestimation of 4.4, still an excessive error.
 Fig. 3  Current voltage curves measured under AM1.5 simulated sun light at 100mWcm−2 equivalent intensity for solid-state DSC employing spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporter with a top coating of PEDOT:PSS as an interlayer between the spiro-OMeTAD and a gold cathode. 
Solid-state DSCs employing P3HT as the hole-transporter
It is quite apparent that highly conductive materials used in excitonic solar cells can result in significant underestimations of active area size. There has recently been significant increase in the activity in semiconducting polymer based DSCs. Originally, insitue polymerised transparent polymers such as polypyrrole and PEDOT were employed,15,16 and more recently light absorbing semiconducting polymers, such as poly(3-hexylthiphene) (P3HT) have also been employed very successfully.17,18 P3HT is a little more conductive than spiro-OMeTAD when not doped. However, in the most efficient configuration for solid-state DSCs a significant quantity of ionic additives, typically Li-TFSI, are added to the system which result in a many orders of magnitude increase in the conductivity (σ∼10−2 Scm−1).19 In the Fig. 4 the current voltage curves for a P3HT based solid-state DSC are sown measured under simulated sun light with different masking conditions, extracted performance parameters are shown in Table 1. All these measurements were performed in a light-tight sample holder in order to eliminate light-piping effects for all measurements.
 Fig. 4  Current voltage curves measured under AM1.5 simulated sun light at 100mWcm−2 equivalent intensity for solid-state DSC employing P3HT as the hole-transporter including Li-TFSI and tBP in the solar cell. For these measurements all the cells had the edge masked to prevent light-piping. 
The short-circuit current density ranges from 9.6 mAcm−2 when unmasked to 3.3 mAcm−2 when correctly masked. It appears that photocurrent from adjacent cells can contribute almost equally to the overall charge collected from any single device. Therefore for this cell structure, even with light piping taken care of, the overestimation in photocurrent density can be approximately a factor of 3. It is noted that PEDOT:PSS is not employed in this instance, but the degree of overestimation does vary from batch to batch and indeed is strangely dependent upon the dye-sensitizer employed (reasons for which will not be addressed here), and ranges between a factor of 1.5 to 3. It is also important to note, that in this instance and for the case of using a PEDOT:PSS interlayer, the open-circuit voltage drops considerably when the cell is correctly masked. This is due to the majority of the “active area” of the device being in the dark, and contributing to the dark current but not the photocurrent. The clear solution here is to only fabricate one large cell per substrate, and ensure it is properly masked. To maximise efficiency the masked area should be only fractionally smaller than the active area of the solar cell. A picture of a more suitable device structure for solid-state cells exhibiting high conductivity is shown in Fig. 2a iv.
Polymer based bulk heterojunction solar cells
For more details on bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells please see the following review.2 The conductivity of un-doped polymer semiconductors is reasonably low in the dark, however, under illumination increased conductivity could lead to edge effects and underestimation of active area sizes, especially if very small active areas are being used. In Fig. 5 current voltage curves for P3HT:PC60BM bulk heterojunction “inverted” solar cells are shown, consisting of FTO coated with a compact ZnO layer as the anode, a spin-coated blend active layer and a thermally evaporated silver cathode. The cell pattern and masking terminology is the same as for the solid-state DSCs.
 Fig. 5  Current voltage curves measured under AM1.5 simulated sun light at 100mWcm−2 equivalent intensity for an “inverted” bulk heterojunction solar cells with a cell structure of an FTO-ZnO anode, P3HT:PC60BM photoactive layer with a Ag top cathode. 
The overall difference between entirely un-masked and correctly masked is reasonably significant and implies an approximate 40% or a factor of 1.4 overestimation in the photocurrent density for this device configuration. The ZnO compact layer is in itself quite conductive (σ∼10−4 Scm−1), and is deposited to marginally overlap the FTO electrode. This is likely to contribute to ∼1 mAcm−2 drop in photocurrent density going from the no mask to the stripe mask configuration. However, all further overestimations must be due to increased active area of the top electrode due to hole conduction in the P3HT. It is also worth noting that these cells were fabricated and tested in air, and that the edge effects may be less severe if tested in an inert atmosphere where the P3HT is less likely to become doped by oxygen.
Choosing and calibrating your solar simulator
The light source which most closely resembles the terrestrial solar spectrum is that of a Xenon lamp. In conjunction with standard AM0 and AM1.5 filters (either as one single AM1.5 filter, or as two separate AM0 and AM 1.5 filters) the mismatch between the lamp output and the solar spectrum within the visible to nearIR region can be less than 2%.11 However, as the lamp ages, the precise spectrum can deviate somewhat. The first issue is to have a suitably uniform illumination intensity, and the second issue is correctly calibrating the intensity.
Uniformity of beam illumination
The illumination intensity should be uniform to within a rated accuracy (<3% deviation for class A) over an area greater than both the test cell and calibration diode. There are a range of available “solar simulators” ranging from a basic 150W xenon lamp with filters, to more uniform Class A simulators. Budget does not always allow purchasing of the best solar simulators, but there are issues with using a basic xenon lamp which must be considered. The main issue is that it is close to impossible to obtain uniform illumination over an area much greater than a few cm2 with a 150W xenon lamp and no further optics. Most critically, there is usually a bright spot close to the centre of the beam which can be up to 3 times the intensity of the surrounding region. In Fig. 6 an intensity map of the output of such a lamp is shown.20 Clearly, if a large calibration diode is used to calibrate the intensity and a small test cell is placed in the beam, it will significantly overestimate the photocurrent of the test cell if positioned in the maximum, and underestimate the photocurrent if positioned off the maximum. Ideally the calibration diode will be the same or similar area to the test cell and located at exactly the same distance in exactly the same spot. The only way to ensure the location is to have a fixed sample holder so that there is no deviation and minimal human error.

For a higher specification solar simulator the illumination uniformity can be very good, however regular checking and tweaking of the optics is required to maximise uniformity. Again however, due to the divergence of the light, the intensity will reduce as the distance from the light source is increased. It is thus essential that the test cells (and calibration diodes) are fixed in the same location between measurements.
Calibrating the intensity of the solar simulator and calculating the spectral mismatch factor
The most convenient method for calibrating a solar simulator is to use a standard silicon reference diode calibrated at a national standards laboratory, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) USA, Fraunhoffer Institute of Solar Energy, Germany or the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) Japan. The solar simulator output will have a spectral mismatch rating. However, this is not the same as the spectral mismatch factor (M) which needs to be employed when calibrating the “equivalent” solar intensity of the lamp, which is set such that the absorbed photon flux is the same in the test cell as would be the case if measured under standard AM1.5G illumination of 100mWcm−2. There is a comprehensive paper by Seaman, which describes how to estimate the spectral mismatch factor from a number of different light sources,12 and other more recent papers dealing with this issue for dye-sensitized and organic solar cells.10,11 For completeness, and to illustrate the relative scale of the error in comparison to the measurement errors, here the method and the rationale behind estimating the spectral mismatch factor is described.
In order to obtain “equivalent” illumination conditions to AM1.5G sun light at 100mWcm−2, the illumination intensity on the solar simulator needs to be set so that the same number of photons are absorbed in the solar cell and converted to charge as would occur under true AM1.5G sun light of 100mWcm−2. Since the lamps do not output light of comparable intensity across the whole of the solar spectrum, the actual integrated total output intensity will usually be less than 100mWcm−2. The simplest way to minimise this mismatch is to use a calibration reference diode with a spectral response (SR(λ)) as similar as possible spectral response to the test cell (ST(λ)). This can be achieved for most excitonic solar cells by employing KG5 filtered Si reference cells.8,11 For lower band gap solar cells, unfiltered silicon diodes may be preferable.
In order to estimate the spectral mismatch, the fractional variation between the test cell short-circuit current measured under the solar simulator (JT,S) and the test cell short-circuit current measured under AM1.5G sun light of 100mWcm−2 intensity (JT,R) needs to be calculated. If the precise output spectrum of the solar simulator E*S(λ) and the precise spectral response of the test cell ST(λ) were known, then this would be relatively straight forward. Simply by integrating the spectral response of the test cell ST(λ) over E*S(λ) would give the current obtained under the solar simulator, and integrating ST(λ) over the AM1.5G reference spectra at 100mWcm−2 (ER(λ)) would give the current expected under standard solar illumination. The ratio of these two would be the mismatch factor (M), (1)
The issue here is that this calculation requires an extremely accurate and absolute measurement of the output power spectrum of the solar simulator.
A route around this is to employ a single calibrated reference cell for all measurements with a well-defined spectral response function (SR(λ)) and a certified short-circuit photocurrent measured under AM1.5G sun light at 100mWcm−2 (JR,R). If the relative, but not absolute, output spectrum of the solar simulator is known (ES(λ)), and the solar simulator output intensity is set to generate JR,R from the reference cell, then it is possible to calculate the precise output from the solar simulator and hence the mismatch factor. This is achieved by integrating ES(λ) over SR(λ) and scaling ES(λ) so that this integral is equal to JR,R. Otherwise put, the measured ES(λ) is scaled such that the mismatch factor for the reference cell is 1: (2)where A is a calibration factor to ensure that A × ES(λ) = E*S(λ), thus, (3)
Therefore, substituting the precise spectral output function form the solar simulator, E*S(λ), in (1) for A × ES(λ) (the calibration factor A multiplied by the measured output function ES(λ)), gives the well-known form for the mismatch factor: (4)
Hence, if the solar simulator outputs too much power in the spectral region of the test cell (M > 1) the intensity should be reduced by the same factor, and if the simulator outputs too low a power in the region of spectral response of the test cell (M < 1), then the intensity should be increased by the same factor. i.e. JR,S should be set to JR,R/M.
Since ST(λ) and SR(λ) are on both the top and bottom of the RHS of eqn (4), it is not necessary to know the absolute spectral response of either the test or calibration diode, purely the form of the response curve. Therefore, in order to calculate the mismatch factor and hence correctly set the intensity on the solar simulator, the following data is required:
1. The spectral response of the calibrated reference diode (SR(λ)) (not absolute).
2. The spectral response of the test cell (SR(λ)) (not absolute).
3. The precise AM1.5G Solar Spectrum.21
4. The precise reference cell short-circuit photocurrent density (JR,R), measured under AM1.5G sun light at 100mWcm−2 (certified reference cell).

In Fig. 7b, the spectral response of a number of excitonic solar cells exhibiting photoaction in different regions of the visible to nearIR region are shown. The corresponding mismatch factors for the cells calculated using the silicon reference cells with and without the KG5 filter are shown in Table 2. It is clear that for all the test cells, with responsivity ranging from the blue (<500nm) to the nearIR (up to 900nm), the mismatch is much lower when calibrating with a KG5 filtered Silicon reference cell than an unfiltered reference cell. With the KG5 filtered reference, the largest mismatch is for the DSC employing a yellow dye, which is just over 3% with all the other device types with less than 1% correction required. With the unfiltered reference cell, the error is about 10%. This indicates that though it is important to carefully set the intensity of the solar simulator with a suitably chosen reference diode, the relative scale of the potential error due to spectral mismatch is of much smaller magnitude than the potential measurement errors discussed in the first part of the article. A basic spreadsheet for estimating the mismatch factor is available via supplementary information.†

Conclusions
In summary, it is clear that in order to obtain a reliable measurement of a solar cell under simulated sun light, extreme care has to be taken in the measurement protocol. It is advisable to adhere to the following key points if efficiency is an important aspect of the research output:
1. The test cells should be masked with a single aperture excluding all light from entering the cell elsewhere, including shading of the edges of the substrates.
2. An AM1.5G filtered light source should be used, with good spatial uniformity of the illumination area.
3. The cells should be positioned in exactly the same place as the reference cell (x, y and z positions).
4. A calibrated reference cell should be used with the mismatch factor applied; ideally, the reference cell will have a suitable filter, such as KG5, such that the reference cell spectral response is close to the test cell spectral response, minimising the mismatch factor.
If these basic protocols are considered by researchers in the field, referees and editors alike, then it is likely that a much fairer comparison between technological advances can be made, and more effectively directed research should ensue.

Broader context
Power conversion efficiency is the “currency” by which advances in solar technologies are judged. Increasingly so, “record” power conversion efficiencies are desirable for high impact publications and as such there is a significant pressure upon the field to constantly improve the efficiency and compete with the best-in-class. However, the protocols used to measure the solar cells in research labs are far from standard and specifically defining the active area of the solar cell is broadly ambiguous. Here, real examples of a range of excitonic solar cells, namely electrolyte based and solid-state dye-sensitized and polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction, are measured following the range of practices routinely adopted. It becomes apparent that in the worst case scenario five-fold photocurrent overestimations can be made. Calibration of the solar simulator and considerations when setting up the testing apparatus are also discussed, to give a broad overview of the major issues and important considerations when assessing solar cell performance. If the issues addressed in this article are considered by researchers, reviewers and editors alike, it is likely that a fairer comparison between new innovations will be made, which will result in a more effective rapid advancement of the technologies.

The substrate patterning and cell layout for the results presented in this work is such that there are 3 devices per 1.4 × 1.4 cm glass substrate illustrated in i. The dashed squares in i, ii, and iii identify the “active area” of the central solar cell. For the unmasked devices the active area is defined as the overlap area between the FTO anode and the silver cathode. The dashed lines in v and vi indicate the edge of the glass substrate. A more ideal layout only has one larger active device per glass substrate, as illustrated in vii, viii, and ix. b) Current voltage curves measured under AM1.5 simulated sun light at 100mWcm−2 equivalent intensity for a solid-state DSC employing spiro-OMeTAD as the hole-transporter.
