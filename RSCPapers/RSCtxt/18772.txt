    , Accepted 19th June 2019First published on 24th June 2019AbstractIn this paper, highly efficient Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) free organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated by employing a light manipulating electrode based on high optical haze textured Al-doped zinc oxide (Textured-AZO) film. The Textured-AZO film is fabricated by a tunable acidic gas etching method with high haze value up to 85% and high total transmittance about 87%, which elongates the optical path length and enhances the light absorption of OSCs. As a result, by employing PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F as the photoactive layer, the device based on the Textured-AZO electrode shows much improved Jsc compared to the device based on the Flat-AZO electrode (22.11 mA cm−2vs. 19.86 mA cm−2), resulting in a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.11%. The high PCE is among the best results for ITO-free OSCs reported so far. More significantly, the Textured-AZO based device even shows higher Jsc and PCE than the ITO-based device (PCE = 12.86%, Jsc = 20.93 mA cm−2), indicating a great potential of using Textured-AZO as a transparent conducting electrode in future commercialization of OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are one of the promising cost-effective alternatives for future renewable energy conversion due to their unique advantages of low-cost, light-weight and flexible solar cells.1–3 The past several years have witnessed great progress in this field and landmark power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 14–15% have been demonstrated in single junction devcies.4,5 One of the main reasons for the rapidly enhanced efficiencies is the design and synthesis of low-bandgap donor/acceptor materials, which highly enhanced the absorption of visible and near-infrared light in the active layer.6–8 A broad and full absorption of incident light is a prerequisite for all kinds of high-efficiency solar cells. However, due to the low charge carrier mobility and the short exciton diffusion length of the organic semiconductor, the optimum film thickness of the photoactive layer is normally around 100–200 nm to minimize the charge recombination loss for charge extraction, which inevitably leads to insufficient photon absorption and charge carrier generation, restricting further PCE breakthrough.9,10
By redistributing the optical fields and trapping the incident light in the photoactive layer, light manipulation has become an increasingly popular strategy to capture solar radiation more efficiently into the thin photoactive layer and thus to increase the device performance.11–13 A variety of methods have been developed to fabricate the light trapping structure, such as light-scattering textures,14,15 anti-reflection layers16–19 or metal nanoparticles with near-field surface plasmonic resonance.20–22 In recent years, using a pre-made haze film on top of the transparent side of photovoltaic devices became an effective approach for light manipulation over a wide optical spectrum to improve the light absorption, by scattering the incident light and extending the optical pathway.23,24 For example, by using self-aggregated alumina nanowire bundles to fabricate an ultra-high haze film on top of glass/ITO, the short-circuit current densities (Jsc) for OSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM active layer increased from 16.19 mA cm−2 to 18.10 mA cm−2 (11.8% enhancement).24 By using a PDMS-based biomimetic haze film on top of glass/ITO, the Jsc for OSC showed 13.5% improvement.25 High haze films based on nanostructured cellulose paper and wood composites were also used to highly improve the device performance.26,27 Although these haze films can effectively improve the PCE of OSCs, the fabrication of them complicates the device fabrication process and the exposed haze films (without the protection of glass) show potential instability issues under adverse weather conditions.
Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is the most commonly used transparent conducting electrode in OSCs; however, the limited reserve of indium element in the earth is considered as a bottleneck for the commercialization of OSCs. Among the possible alternatives to ITO, Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) is a very promising candidate due to the abundance of Al and Zn in the earth, and the mature technology for the large area fabrication of AZO films through sputtering methods.28 Compared to ITO, the major drawback of using AZO as a transparent conducting electrode is its relative low transmittance.29 For example, to meet the 15 Ω □−1 requirement, the thickness of ITO is around 150 nm with an average visible light transmittance about 86% while the thickness of AZO should be 500 nm with average visible light transmittance about 81%. Therefore, it is necessary to fine tune the light absorption in AZO-based devices, which is of great importance for developing ITO-free OSCs.
In this work, we demonstrate a light manipulating electrode based on a high optical haze AZO film and apply it as the cathode for high-efficiency ITO-free OSCs. The haze AZO electrode is fabricated by a tunable acidic gas etching method, which changes the surface topography of AZO from flat (Flat-AZO) to a random texture (Textured-AZO). The optical haze value for the Textured-AZO electrode is up to 85% with high total transmittance about 87%. The Textured-AZO electrode shows strong light-scattering properties and elongates the optical path length in the active layer, which highly improves the light absorption. For OSCs using PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F as the active layer, the device based on the Textured-AZO electrode shows much improved Jsc compared to the device based on Flat-AZO (22.11 mA cm−2vs. 19.86 mA cm−2), resulting in a promising PCE of 13.11%, which is among the best results for ITO-free OSCs.30,31 More significantly, the Textured-AZO based device even shows a higher Jsc and PCE than the ITO-based device (Jsc = 20.93 mA cm−2 and PCE = 12.86%), which indicates the great potential of using Textured-AZO as a transparent conducting electrode in future commercialization of OSCs.
Results and discussion
The Textured-AZO was fabricated by a tunable acidic gas etching method as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, AZO glass was put in a self-assembly device to get a slow acidic gas etching process. The acidic gas was made from slightly heated acetic acid (CH3COOH):hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water solution. This process is highly adjustable by varying the conditions such as the concentration and ratio of CH3COOH:HCl, the temperature of the solution, etching time, the distance between the AZO surface and the liquid surfaces, and the flow of the steam. After the gas etching, the appearance of the AZO electrode changed from transparent to hazy while the surface topography of AZO changed from flat (Flat-AZO) to a random texture (Textured-AZO), which will be discussed below. By tuning the etching parameters, the degree of haze, electrical conductivity and the microstructure of the AZO can be greatly changed. In this work, we used an optimized condition to fabricate Textured-AZO (detailed parameters in Experimental section) with both high optical haze value and good electrical conductivity.

The topography of the AZO films was studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) and a 3D optical surface metrology system. As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 1a and b), the smooth and compact surface of the untreated AZO film changed to a crater-like textured morphology after the acidic gas etching (the diameter of the craters is around 0.5–1 μm). From the AFM images (Fig. 1c and d), the root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the Flat-AZO film was 6.7 nm, while that of the Textured-AZO film reached 59.0 nm. The 3D images in the AFM images confirmed the crater-like textured morphology observed in SEM and showed that the depth of the craters is around 100–200 nm. To further confirm the morphological change, the 3D optical surface metrology system was used to give a broader view of 25 μm × 20 μm, from which a continuously random textured morphology for the Textured-AZO film was clearly shown.

As shown in previous studies, a nanostructure with a random texture morphology could show a strong light scattering effect. To visualize the scattering of light, we took a picture of a red laser (λ = 650 nm) beam irradiated onto the white screen after passing through the Textured-AZO film (Fig. 2a). The laser beam is highly scattered and spread out behind the haze film as observed in Fig. 2b. When the light passed through the haze film, the crater-like textures act as light scattering centers because they made boundaries of refractive index-mismatch between AZO and air. Such a strong light scattering effect would elongate the optical path length in the active layer, and thus improve the light absorption.

(d) Optical haze spectra of the films. 
To quantitatively assess the transparency and optical haze of the films, total and diffuse transmittance spectra of the Flat-ITO (untreated glass/ITO substrate), Flat-AZO and Textured-AZO were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (Fig. 2c). The total transmittance for Textured-AZO and Flat-ITO were higher than that for Flat-AZO, which is consistent with previous results. Higher total transmittance is a critical parameter for the transparent conducting electrode, which is regarded as the main reason for the better performance of the devices based on the ITO electrode than those based on the AZO electrode. The reduced film thickness of the Textured-AZO film contributes to the increased total transmittance of Textured-AZO. It should be noted that although the Textured-AZO film thickness was reduced, the good electrical conductivity was preserved (slightly decreased from 15 Ω □−1 to 17 Ω □−1) and meets the requirement for a transparent conducting electrode. For the diffuse transmittance, the three films showed distinctly different behavior. Both of the Flat-ITO and Flat-AZO showed very low diffuse transmittance (average 2.1% for Flat-ITO and 3.1% for Flat-AZO), while the diffuse transmittance for Textured-AZO was 45–70% over a wide spectral range of 400–900 nm. To evaluate the light scattering ability, the optical haze values (haze = diffuse transmittance/total transmittance) for Flat-ITO, Flat-AZO and Textured-AZO over the visible spectrum are shown in Fig. 2d. The Textured-AZO film showed very high optical haze over a wide spectral range. For example, the optical haze values were all over 70% when the wavelength is less than 700 nm. Such high haze value over a broad spectral range indicates the strong scattering ability of the haze Textured-AZO electrode, which has the potential to highly enhance the light harvesting in photovoltaic applications.
To utilize the transparency and strong scattering ability of the haze Textured-AZO film, we use it as the cathode to construct inverted OSCs based on the PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F photoactive layer. The photovoltaic performances of the OSCs were investigated based on the following device structure: glass/Textured-AZO or Flat-AZO or Flat-ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F/MoO3/Al. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Table 1. Fig. 3a illustrates the representative current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices with the different cathodes (Textured-AZO or Flat-AZO or Flat-ITO) under simulated AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Both the Flat-AZO and Flat-ITO electrode were used to make control devices.

The Flat-AZO control device exhibited a maximum (PCEmax) of 12.15% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 19.86 mA cm−2 and a FF of 72.83%. The Flat-ITO control device showed a higher Jsc of 20.93 mA cm−2 and an increased FF of 73.15%, resulting in a PCEmax of 12.86%, which was mainly due to the higher total transmittance of the Flat-ITO cathode. Changing Flat-AZO to Textured-AZO as the cathode dramatically increased the Jsc to 22.11 mA cm−2 with a decreased FF to 70.59%, resulting in a promising PCEmax of 13.11%. The remarkable increase in Jsc could be understood as that the Textured-AZO electrode causes an improved light harvesting in the photoactive layer for the photocurrent generation due to the strong light scattering that elongates the optical path length (Fig. 3b). On the other side, the crater-like textured morphology of the Textured-AZO electrode increased the thickness of the active layer and then resulted in higher Jsc. The high PCE of 13.11% is among the highest values reported to date for ITO-free OSCs. Moreover, it is exciting that the PCE for the device based on Textured-AZO exceeded that for the device based on ITO, which is the most commonly used transparent conducting electrode in OSCs. The decreased FF for the device could be attributed to the increased sheet resistances of the Textured-AZO electrode.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were conducted to confirm the photocurrent generation of these devices. As shown in Fig. 3c, all the devices demonstrated a broad photo-response covering from 320 to 800 nm. The Textured-AZO based device showed a remarkably enhanced EQE compared to both of the control devices in the entire wavelength range, contributing to the increased Jsc. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra for the Flat-ITO, Flat-AZO and Textured-AZO devices were 20.43 mA cm−2, 19.31 mA cm−2 and 21.45 mA cm−2, respectively, agreeing well with J–V measurements (the error is within 3%). The difference in the EQE spectra between the Textured-AZO based device and Flat-AZO based device was plotted for comparison in Fig. 3d. The increase in EQE was >10% below 650 nm wavelength and was gradually reduced from short to long wavelengths, which might be due to the decreased light scattering ability (haze value) in the long wavelength range as shown in Fig. 2d.
To gain further insight into the light propagation process in the devices, a theoretical study on the optical effects of the Textured-AZO film was conducted by using the finite element method (FEM) and traditional full-wave propagation method based on the direct discretization of the Maxwell equation (see Experimental section for the details of the optical simulation). Fig. 4 showed the cross-section field intensity distributions and photon flux of transverse magnetic (TM) polarized incident light at 450 and 770 nm in OSCs with Flat-AZO (Fig. 4a and c) and Textured-AZO (Fig. 4b and d), respectively. According to the simulation result, the different electrodes can remarkably influence the optical field distribution of the incident light in devices and the field intensity in the active layer was highly increased by using the Textured-AZO film both at 450 nm and 770 nm wavelength. The field enhancement is due to the excitation of the waveguide mode induced by the scattering and constructive interference between traveling waves. The increase in field intensity will promote the light harvesting to the photocurrent; thus, the EQE of the device was enhanced. In addition, the simulation results clearly show that the field intensity enhancement at 450 nm is stronger than 770 nm, which is consistent with the EQE enhancement behavior in Fig. 3d and light scattering ability (haze value) in Fig. 2d.

Simulated cross-section near-field distributions for TM polarized incident light at 770 nm in OSCs with a (c) Flat-AZO and (d) Textured-AZO electrode. 
The photon flux direction in OSCs was marked by the arrows in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the photon flux in OSCs based on Flat-AZO only propagated along the direction perpendicular to the device, and the optical path in the active layer is limited. However, in the OSCs based on Textured-AZO, the scattering and interference of the incident light can make the photon flux propagate along the plane of the active layer at some place. Therefore, the path of light propagation was greatly extended and more light was absorbed and trapped inside the active layer, which converted into photocurrent in the end.
Conclusions
In conclusion, highly efficient ITO-free organic solar cells were fabricated by employing a light manipulating electrode based on a high optical haze Textured-AZO film. The Textured-AZO film was fabricated by a tunable acidic gas etching method with high haze value up to 85% and high total transmittance about 87%, which elongated the optical path length and enhanced the light absorption in the active layer. Using PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F as the active layer, the device based on the Textured-AZO electrode shows much improved Jsc compared to the device based on untreated Flat-AZO (22.11 mA cm−2vs. 19.86 mA cm−2), resulting in a promising PCE of 13.11%. These enhancements caused by the Textured-AZO film have been testified by both experimental data and optical simulations. The high PCE is among the best results for ITO-free OSCs. More significantly, the Textured-AZO based device even shows higher Jsc and PCE than the ITO-based device (Jsc = 20.93 mA cm−2 and PCE = 12.86%), which indicates a great potential of using Textured-AZO as a transparent conducting electrode in future commercialization of OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. The AZO glass substrates (15 Ω □−1) with a thickness about 800 nm were purchased from South China Science & Technology Company Limited. IT-4F was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. (Beijing). PBDB-T-2F was synthesized via the method from Adv. Mater., 2015, 27, 4655.
Textured-AZO preparation
The AZO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a nitrogen stream. After the substrates were cleaned by plasma treatment for 10 min, the substrates were put on a self-assembly device with slow and adjustable acidic gas etching for 1 h. The acid solution was constituted by CH3COOH:HCl:H2O = 5:5:100 (v/v). The distance between the AZO surface and the acid solution is 5 cm. The acid solution was heated to 35 °C. After the etching process, the sample was immediately cleaned by deionized water in an ultrasonic bath, and dried in a nitrogen stream.
Device fabrication and measurement
Patterned Textured-AZO, AZO or ITO were used as the cathode in organic solar cells. The substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a nitrogen stream. The Sol–gel-derived ZnO films were prepared using zinc acetate in 2-methoxyethanol:2-aminoethanol as a precursor solution by the spin-coating method onto the cathode followed by thermal treatment at 200 °C for 60 min. The PBDB-T-2F:IT-4F (1:1, w/w) blend was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 (for polymer), with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (1% by volume) as additive. The solution was stirred for 5 hours at room temperature and then spin-coated on the surface of the ZnO layer in the nitrogen-based atmosphere glove box, and the optimal film of the active layer is 100 nm. The active layer was then thermally annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. Finally, a 10 nm thick MoO3 layer and a 100 nm thick Al layer were deposited onto the active layer under a high vacuum of 2 × 10−6 mbar. All the device fabrication processes were carried out in an N2-filled glove box (Braun GmbH). The PCE was determined from J–V curve measurements (using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter) under a 1 sun, AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192; 1000 W m−2). Masks made using laser beam cutting technology to have a well-defined area of 4 mm2 were attached to define the effective area for accurate measurement. The solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with KG-5 visible colour filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Theoretical Jsc values obtained by integrating the product of the EQE with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum agreed with the measured value to within 3%.
Theoretical modeling and simulation
The field intensity distributions in OSCs were simulated based on the rigorous electromagnetic theory through the finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach by Lumerical FDTD Solutions. In OSCs modeling, the optical properties of the polarized incident light, reflection, and absorption were taken into account. For simplicity, the Textured U-shaped nanostructures with linearly tapered profile were representatively constructed instead of randomly distributed geometry, whereas the groove depth, period, and fill factor data were constructed as determined from the AFM images. In the device modeling, the extinction coefficients and complex refractive indices of n and k of all layers used in the simulation were obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometer measurement.
