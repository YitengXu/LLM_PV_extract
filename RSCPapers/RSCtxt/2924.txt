    , Accepted 21st January 2017First published on 23rd January 2017AbstractAlthough numerous superior nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for the UV-vis to the near-infrared (IR) region have been established, the development of an efficient NLO material capable of broadband second harmonic generation (SHG) in the mid-IR region is still a big challenge. In this work, we performed hybrid functional calculations to accurately assess the mid-IR NLO capabilities of a group of I3–V–VI4 compounds (with I = Ag or Cu, V = P or As, and VI = S or Se). The linear and nonlinear optical properties of these crystals were predicted and analyzed. This group of compounds display moderate optical anisotropy of refraction (0.1 > Δn > 0.03) to fulfill the phase-matching conditions. In particular, the static SHG coefficients of Cu3AsS4, Ag3PSe4 and Cu3PSe4 are predicted to be about twice that of the benchmark AgGaSe2. A detailed analysis of their precise electronic structures and local dipole moments suggests that it is the coupling of the large dipole moment vector of the constituent asymmetry [I–VI4] tetrahedron and the strong covalent character between V and VI ions that contributes to the large SHG response. These candidates would promote the development of the mid-IR NLO functional materials.
1. Introduction
High-power tunable mid-infrared (mid-IR) lasers in the range of 2–8 μm have a wide range of scientific and technological applications, such as molecular spectroscopy, atmospheric sensing, information communications, laser guidance, and laser intrusion.1–10 An efficient approach to realize the output of mid-IR lasers is frequency-conversion using an IR nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal. Unfortunately, the benchmark NLO crystals with superior performance in the UV-vis to near-IR region, such as KH2PO4 (KDP),11 KTiOPO4 (KTP),12 β-BaB2O4 (BBO)13 and LiB3O5 (LBO),14 are limited in the mid-IR region because of their inadequate optical transparency and relatively low SHG efficiency.15 It is of particular difficulty to find suitable crystals working in the IR region. To date, only a few are commercially available. They are primarily the I–III–VI and II–IV–V chalcopyrite-type compounds, such as AgGaS2,16,17 AgGaSe2,18,19 and ZnGeP2.20 Nevertheless, they are not good enough due to the low laser damage thresholds (LDT) for AgGaS2 and AgGaSe2, and the two-photon absorption of a 1 μm laser by ZnGeP2. In addition, their low thermal conductivities and strong anisotropy of thermal expansion result in difficulty in growing big crystals. Thus, exploration of new IR NLO materials with good performance is urgent.
A general strategy to design new NLO materials is to employ a noncentrosymmetric chromophore with high microscopic second-order NLO response as building units, such as borate π-orbital systems,21 distorting coordinated units with a lone-pair cation,22 distorted polyhedral with a d0 cation center,23 and polar displacement of a d10 cation center.24 A large macroscopic SHG response can be obtained if the stacking pattern of these polarizable asymmetric units is noncentrosymmetric. Metal oxides often suffer from low efficiencies and optical transparency in the mid-IR and IR regions, which arise from the absorption bands of metal–oxygen bonds and their overtones.1 Therefore, the metal sulfides and selenides are still the major source of new IR NLO materials.2 Recently, increasing attention has been focused on ternary I–V–VI compounds because the strong covalent character of V–VI bonds and the special alignment of the building units are believed to contribute to a large SHG response. These compounds include NaAsSe2,1,25 Li(Na)AsS2,26 APSe6 (A = K, Rb, and Cs),27,28 K2PSe6,29 Cs5P5Se12,30 β-CsPSe6,31 and so on. For more details on metal chalcogenides as NLO materials, we can refer to the thesis and review paper of Chung et al.2,32 Among these ternary I–V–VI chalcogenides, γ-NaAsSe2 has been demonstrated to possess a very strong SHG response, about 75 times stronger than that of AgGaSe2 in the wavelength range of 700–900 nm.1 This is one of the highest SHG responses among known materials with band gaps larger than 1.0 eV ever reported. Song and Bera et al. revealed that the quasi-one-dimensional structural character results in high density of states and consequently a large spatial overlap between the optical transition states to yield large SHG coefficients.1,25
In the I–V–VI ternary systems, I3–V–VI4 compounds are receiving increasing attention in the context of NLO research.4,33 The I3–V–VI4 compounds can usually be classified into two main groups: (i) Ag or Cu based compounds with a noncentrosymmetric Pmn21 space group, including Ag3AsS4, Cu3AsS4, Ag3PS4, Cu3PS4, Ag3PSe4, and Cu3PSe4 and (ii) alkali metal based compounds with a centrosymmetric Pnma space group, such as Rb3AsSe4, Cs3AsSe4, K3PS4, Li3PS4, Rb3PS4, and Cs3PSe4. As the SHG response only occurs in an acentric compound, the latter six alkali metal chalcogenides possess no SHG response. However, some special acentric phases of alkali metal based I3–V–VI4 chalcogenides, such as γ-Li3PS4 (Pmn21 symmetry), α-Na3PS4 (P21c symmetry), and K3PS4·H2O (P21212 symmetry), have been recently reported to exhibit large SHG effects (about 2.59–8.15 pm V−1) and are promising mid-IR NLO materials.4 Here we pay attention to the former six ternary Ag or Cu based I3–V–VI4 compounds with a wurtzite-like enargite structure, and perform hybrid functional calculations to accurately assess their mid-IR NLO capabilities. We note that Cu3AsS4, Cu3PS4 and Ag3PS4 have been studied in a recent work by Liang et al.33 who used the sX-LDA functional to predict the band gaps and the following SHG coefficients. Their calculations reveal that Cu3AsS4 exhibits a very large SHG coefficient (∼80 pm V−1), and Cu3PS4 and Ag3PS4 show a rather small SHG response (∼7 pm V−1). However, as the SHG coefficient is roughly inversely correlated with the band gap, the nearly 30% underestimation of the band gap of Cu3AsS4 by Liang et al. (0.89 eV vs. 1.28 eV) would significantly overestimate the SHG coefficient. Similarly, the overestimation of the band gap of Cu3PS4 would also underestimate its SHG response. In this work, we found that the HSE06 exchange–correlation functional is more appropriate than the sX-LDA functional in calculating the electronic structures of Cu-based chalcogenides. Additionally, the NLO properties of Ag3AsS4, Cu3PSe4 and Ag3PSe4 are determined for the first time in this work. It is worth mentioning that there are three other Ag/Cu-based chalcogenides crystallizing tetragonally with the space group I2m, including Cu3AsSe4, Cu3SbS4, and Cu3SbSe4. Pfitzner et al. have suggested that the size differences between the tetrahedral units may account for their structural differences.34 Moreover, they stressed that the preparation method and the sample temperature also play a crucial role in the resulting structure. The reason for not considering Cu3AsSe4, Cu3SbS4, and Cu3SbSe4 in the work is that they show relatively small band gaps (Cu3AsSe4 ∼ 0.8 eV, Cu3SbS4 ∼ 0.46 eV, and Cu3SbSe4 ∼ 0.31 eV),35 which might result in a small LDT.
In general, practically usable mid-IR NLO materials should satisfy the following conditions: large SHG coefficients, a wide optical-transparency energy window, good IR phase-matchability and high LDT.4 The SHG coefficients can be predicted by the length-gauge formalism derived by Aversa and Sipe36 based on the DFT momentum matrix elements. We speculate that the polar displacement of the d10 Ag+/Cu+ cation center in a [I–VI4] tetrahedron unit is favorable for yielding large SHG coefficients. Moreover, the covalent character of V–VI bonds is also believed to contribute to the SHG response.1,25 The transparency window and phase-matchability are assessed from the optical absorption spectrum and the birefringence, respectively. The calculation of LDT from theoretical model is still difficult so far due to the complex mechanisms of laser damage. The small band gap has been thought to be one of the factors resulting in laser damage.4 However, it is important to note that the LDT is also affected by many other factors, including the crystal thermal diffusivity and impurities.37–40 Based on the above calculations, the mid-IR NLO generation capabilities of this group of I3–V–VI4 compounds were systemically investigated. Several potential mid-IR NLO materials were screened out. They would greatly promote the development of the mid-IR NLO functional materials.
2. Computational methods
Our ab initio calculations for the I3–V–VI4 compounds were performed using the full-potential projector augmented wave (PAW) method,41 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).42–44 The exchange–correlation (XC) interaction was treated by four XC functionals including the local density approximation (LDA),45,46 the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)47 functional, and the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functionals (HSE03 and HSE06).48 In combination with PBE potentials, attributing a value to HFSCREEN (the range separation parameter in range separated hybrid functionals) will switch from the HSE03 (HFSCREEN = 0.3) to HSE06 (HFSCREEN = 0.2) functional.42 The default value of AEXX was set to 0.25. The PAW potentials with valence states 3d and 4s for Cu, 4d and 5s for Ag, 3s and 3p for P and S, 4s and 4p for As and Se were used. A plane wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 450 eV was employed throughout. A Γ-centered 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst-Pack grid for the Brillouin zone sampling49 and a cutoff energy of 450 eV for the plane wave expansion were found to get convergent lattice parameters. Due to the high computational cost of screened hybrid functionals in structural optimization, a Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack grid was used when HSE03 and HSE06 functionals were adopted. A denser k-point grid (5 × 5 × 5) was also tested in the structure relaxation and the almost same lattice parameters were obtained as compared with that obtained by a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point grid. In geometry optimizations, all the atomic positions and lattice constants were fully relaxed until the quantum mechanical forces became less than 0.05 eV Å−1, and the total energy was converged to 0.1 meV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry structures
Ag or Cu based I3–V–VI4 compounds with Pmn21 symmetry include Ag3PS4, Ag3PSe4, Ag3AsS4, Cu3PS4, Cu3PSe4, and Cu3AsS4. They crystallize in the wurtzite-based enargite structure with a simple orthorhombic unit cell with 16 atoms in the unit cell. For clarification, only the crystal structure of Cu3AsS4 is depicted in Fig. 1. We see that they belong to the group of normal tetrahedral structures where each atom has four nearest neighbor atoms located approximately at the comers of a surrounding tetrahedron. In detail, Fig. 1 shows that both the monovalent Cu+ and the pentavalent As5+ cations are coordinated to four chalcogen S2− anions forming [CuS4] and [AsS4] tetrahedra.

(b–d) Are [AsS4], [CuS4]1 and [CuS4]2 units, respectively, with the bond lengths in Å, bond angles in units of degrees and the black arrows indicating dipole moment vectors. (e) Top view of the unit cell of Cu3AsS4 at Z = 0.5 and 1, respectively. The black arrows show the XY projection of dipole moment vectors of [AsS4], [CuS4]1 and [CuS4]2 units. 
The cell volume and atom positions were fully relaxed by the GGA–PBE, LDA, and HSE06 XC functionals, respectively. The predicted lattice constants and the corresponding maximum absolute percentage errors (MAPE) are listed in Table 1. From these results we see that the HSE06 hybrid functional is more accurate than PBE and LDA approaches for predicting the atomic structures of these compounds. Especially, the MAPE values for the lattice constants of Ag3PS4, Cu3AsS4, Cu3PS4 and Cu3PSe4 at the HSE06 level are all smaller than 1%. One exception is Ag3PSe4, for which the calculated lattice constants are severely overestimated no matter which functional is used. Thus, a more precise experiment to refine the crystal structure of Ag3PSe4 may be needed. Hereafter, we shall discuss the structural properties given by the HSE06 functional. The volume of the six I3–V–VI4 compounds (Table 2) follows the order Cu3PS4 < Cu3AsS4 < Cu3PSe4 < Ag3PS4 < Ag3AsS4 < Ag3PSe4. All three Ag based compounds have larger volumes than Cu based compounds due to the much larger atomic radius of Ag (1.60 Å) with respect to Cu (1.35 Å) and the significantly longer average bond length of Ag–S(Se) (>2.58 Å) versus Cu–S(Se) (<2.46 Å). Although Se and As have similar atomic radius (about 1.15 Å), the substitution of S by Se has a larger effect in enlarging the cell volume than the substitution of P by As. The [I–VI4] and [V–VI4] tetrahedra as building units play an important role in the electronic structure and associated optical properties. There exist two different [I–VI4] tetrahedron configurations (denoted as [I–VI4]1 and [I–VI4]2) and one [V–VI4] tetrahedron in the structure. Fig. 1(b)–(d) illustrate the bond lengths and bond angles of the three tetrahedra in Cu3AsS4. It is shown that the [CuS4] and [AsS4] tetrahedra are slightly distorted with S–Cu–S and S–As–S angles close to the normal tetrahedron value of 109.47°. The Cu–S covalent bond is a little longer than the As–S bond indicating the stronger covalent character of the As–S bond. Bader charge analysis (Table 2) confirms that the As atoms lose 1.09e each, while the Cu atoms lose about 0.5e each. Table 2 also compares the average bond lengths and atomic Bader charge for these compounds. We find that there is less charge transfer from cations to anions in selenide (Ag3PSe4 and Cu3PSe4) than in sulfide (Ag3PS4, Cu3PS4, Ag3AsS4 and Cu3AsS4) due to the lower electronegativity of Se than S. The average V–VI bond length ranges from 2.05 to 2.24 Å, following a trend P–S < As–S < P–Se. It is of interest to find that the lengths of these V–VI covalent bonds are all smaller than that of the As–Se bond (about 2.44 Å) in NaAsSe2,25 in which the record-breaking SHG coefficient has been attributed to the formation of a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy with strong V–VI covalent bonds.

3.2. Band structure and density of states
It has been proven that the conventional XC functionals such as GGA/PBE and LDA usually underestimate the band gap of semiconductors due to the self-interaction error in the approximate exchange functional. A hybrid functional that includes a portion of exact exchange can correct much of this error. In this work, the HSE03, HSE06, GGA/PBE and LDA XC functionals were adopted for the electronic structure calculation of the I3–V–VI4 compounds based on the HSE06 optimized structures. Experimentally, the band gaps of three Cu-based compounds, Cu3AsS4, Cu3PS4, and Cu3PSe4, have been determined based on optical spectroscopy50,51 (Table 3), while the experimental band gaps of Ag3AsS4, Ag3PS4, and Ag3PSe4 are absent. The predicted band gap values for all six compounds by different XC functionals are listed in Table 3. Consistent with expectation, the PBE and LDA functionals both seriously underestimate the band gaps, implying the inability of a conventional XC functional in predicting the band gap of Ag/Cu-based compounds.52 Inspiringly, the performances of HSE03 and HSE06 are much better than PBE and LDA. Moreover, the HSE06 results are a little closer to the experimental values than the HSE03 results. The results by HSE06 show that Cu3PS4 has the largest band gap of 2.54 eV than Ag3PS4 of 2.3 eV. The other four I3–V–VI4 compounds have the band gaps ranging from 1.31 to 1.77 eV. It is of interest to note that the gap values of Ag3PSe4, Cu3AsS4, and Cu3PSe4 are in the desired range for solar photovoltaic devices (1.0–1.6 eV). We note that the obtained band gap of Ag3PSe4 by HSE06 (1.34 eV) in this work is somewhat smaller than that of 2.09 eV previously predicted by the PBE0 functional.53 In this work, we find that the PBE0 functional seriously overestimates the band gaps of Cu3AsS4, Cu3PS4, and Cu3PSe4 (not shown in Table 3). Therefore, we conclude that the HSE06 functional might be more appropriate for calculating the band gap of Ag/Cu-based selenide and sulfide, while for Ag/Cu-based oxides the PBE0 functional is more accurate. In this group of compounds, Cu3PS4 and Ag3PS4 possess the largest band gaps, suggesting they might have the larger laser damage threshold than the other four compounds. However, as we mentioned in previous section, the band gap value is not the only criterion for evaluating the laser damage threshold.

Fig. 2(a–f) depict the obtained band structures of the six I3–V–VI4 compounds by the HSE06 functional. Common features are observed due to their similar crystal structure. Except for Cu3PS4, the other five compounds present direct band gaps with the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the G point (0 0 0). We find that there exists another low lying valley along the path of G(0 0 0)–Z(0 0 0.5) in the bottom of conduction bands of Cu-based compounds (Fig. 2(d–f)), which is not observed in the conduction bands of Ag-based compounds. In addition, a peak at X(0 0.5 0) is observed at the top of valence bands for all six compounds. In the case of Cu3PS4, these two low lying valleys change to be the CBM and VBM, respectively, giving rise to an indirect band gap of 2.54 eV, which is consistent with previous theoretical and experimental indirect band gaps of 2.55 eV and 2.38 eV, respectively.51

(g) First Brillouin zone of space group Pmn21 in the reciprocal lattice. The red line represents the k-point path of the band structure diagram, and kx, ky, and kz correspond to the reciprocal vectors. 
We further examined the projected density of states (PDOS) spectra for them, as shown in Fig. 3. The valence-band edge shows similar orbital compositions for different compounds, consisting mainly of S/Se p orbitals and Ag/Cu d orbitals. As the Ag/Cu ions are fourfold coordinated, the tetrahedral crystal field splitting engenders the separation of Ag/Cu-d valence bands into the t2 Ag/Cu-d and e Ag/Cu-d orbitals. The bonding states between t2 Ag/Cu-d and Se/S-p lie at about −5 eV below the Fermi level (0 eV), and the corresponding anti-bonding states lie at the top of valence bands. Between the bonding and anti-bonding states of t2 Ag/Cu-d and Se/S-p, the e Ag/Cu-d orbitals form highly localized nonbonding states. Specifically, the e Ag-4d nonbonding states tend to locate close to the bonding states of t2 Ag-4d and Se/S-p, whereas e Cu-3d nonbonding states tend to lie with the anti-bonding states of t2 Cu-3d and Se/S-p. Additionally, the strong covalent interaction between P/As-p and Se/S-p states is evidenced by the bonding states located at approximately −7 eV below the VBM in Fig. 3. The corresponding anti-bonding states exist at about 2–4 eV above the Fermi level (0 eV). P/As-s states also hybridize with Se/S-s states, yet the bonding states of P/As-s and Se/S-s (at about −11 eV, not shown in Fig. 3) are energetically lower than those of p–p bonds, and the anti-bonding states occupy the CBM.

The valence bands (E < 0 eV) are scaled on the left y axis and the conduction bands (E > 0 eV) are scaled on the right y axis. The Fermi level is set to zero energy. 
Compared with the valence bands, the compositions of the lowest conduction bands are much more complex. The first three contributions to the lowest conduction bands are S/Se-p, P/As-s, and Cu/Ag-d orbitals. For Ag3PS4, there also exist contributions from S-s and Ag-s orbitals. These characters are different from a recently developed photoelectrode material, Ag3PO4, in which the highly delocalized Ag-5s orbitals dominate the CBM.54 The difference is largely attributed to the different crystal structure and Ag+ network. Ag3PO4 crystallizes in cubic symmetry with space group P3n, whereas the sulfides (selenides) studied in this work present orthorhombic symmetry with space group Pmn21. Moreover, a short Ag–Ag distance (∼3 Å) in Ag3PO4 results in the formation of a metallic Ag–Ag bond, giving rise to the hybridization of Ag s and Ag s in the CBM. By contrast, the smallest Ag(Cu)–Ag(Cu) distance in I3–V–VI4 sulfides (selenides) is as large as 3.61 Å, indicating the negligible interaction between Ag(Cu)-s and Ag(Cu)-s in the compounds studied in this work. Additionally, we see that the anti-bonding interaction between S/Se-sp and P/As-sp contributes to shifting of the energy level of the CBM to a more negative potential by substituting S(P) with Se(As), resulting in the smaller band gaps of Ag3PSe4, Ag3AsS4, Cu3AsS4, and Cu3PSe4 than that of Ag3PS4 and Cu3PS4.
3.3. Linear optical properties
To obtain the linear optical properties of these compounds, the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω) has been determined in the random phase approximation from the HSE06 wavefunctions without including the local effect. The imaginary part of the dielectric function (ε2) is the pandect of the linear optical properties and can be obtained from the momentum matrix elements. Many linear optical parameters, such as the real part of dielectric function (ε1), absorption coefficient (α), and real part of refractive index (n), can be derived from ε2. In general, the direct and indirect interband transitions contribute to ε2. The indirect interband transitions are usually neglected due to the small contributions to ε2. The peak of the ε2 can thus relate the optical absorption at a given frequency to the direct interband transitions of electrons.55
Due to the orthorhombic symmetry of the I3–V–VI4 compounds, the εxx (along [100]), εyy (along [010]), and εzz (along [001]) are independent. The ε1 and ε2 curves of the I3–V–VI4 compounds as a function of photon energy along three principal axes are shown in Fig. 4. The ε2 curves of these compounds have common features due to their similar crystal structures. There exists a sharp peak at about 4–5 eV (indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 4(b), (c), (e) and (f)) and a weak shoulder at about 2.5 eV (the red arrows) for Ag3PSe4, Ag3AsS4, Cu3PSe4 and Cu3AsS4. The weak shoulder is mainly arising from the electron transitions from the VBM (Ag/Cu-d and Se/S-p orbitals) to the CBM (hybridization orbitals of Se/S-p, P/As-s, and Cu/Ag-d). The sharp peak results from the electron transitions from the VBM to the CBM + 1 (hybridization orbitals of P/As-p and Se/S-p). For Ag3PS4 and Cu3PS4, their larger band gaps (>2.0 eV) shift the ε2(ω) curves to higher energies. A sharp peak at about 5 eV is observed. The real part of the dielectric function (ε1) is obtained from ε2 by a Kramers–Kronig transformation. The ε1(ω) curves for different I3–V–VI4 compounds are similar as well, having some overlapping peaks at about 4 eV and a smooth peak below zero at about 11 eV. There exists a zero crossing at about 8.5 eV. The negative value of ε1(ω) in the region of 8.5–18 eV indicates the metallic behavior with high density free carriers. The direction-averaged static ε1(0) for Ag3PS4, Ag3PSe4, Ag3AsS4, Cu3PS4, Cu3PSe4, and Cu3AsS4 are 5.13, 6.64, 5.69, 5.82, 7.88, 7.09, respectively. These values would be larger when considering the effect of vibration at room temperature.

The direction-averaged optical absorption coefficients α for the six compounds were calculated and are shown in Fig. 5(a). The calculated optical absorption spectra show that they have no absorption when the photon energy is below 1 eV (λ > 1.24 μm). However, it is important to note that the obtained optical absorption spectra here only include the contributions from the electronic interband transitions, and ignore the IR absorption resulting from lattice vibration, which might play an important role in the IR light absorption for these compounds. A further IR absorption measurement is needed in future to quantify the contributions of lattice vibration to the IR optical absorption below the band gap. The absorption intensity of light with a photon energy of 1–2.5 eV follows the order: Cu3PSe4 ≈ Cu3AsS4 > Ag3PSe4 > Ag3AsS4 > Cu3PS4 > Ag3PS4. The result is consistent with previous prediction that Cu3PSe4 is a potential solar absorber.51 In the high-energy region upon 11 eV (not shown in Fig. 5), the absorption spectra for all six compounds decreased as the electron is hard to respond.56 For a practically usable IR NLO crystal, a moderate value of birefringence (0.04–0.1) is also important in fulfilling the phase-matching conditions.4 The birefringence in the orthorhombic structure could be calculated from the difference of the maximum and minimum values of the refractive indices (Δn = nmax − nmin) along three principal axes. The dispersion curves of the principal refractive indices of the six compounds are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†Fig. 5(b) shows the birefringence in the range of 0–2 eV for these compounds. For 0.15 eV < ℏω < 0.62 eV (mid-IR region, 2 μm < λ < 8 μm), the birefringence values of Ag3PS4, Ag3PSe4, Ag3AsS4, and Cu3PS4 are all larger than 0.04, indicating their effective optical anisotropy for phase-matching in the mid-IR region. We note that these birefringence values are comparable to the level of commonly used IR nonlinear optical materials, such as AgGaSe2 (Δn ∼ 0.031),57 AgGaS2 (Δn ∼ 0.053),58 and ZnGeP2 (Δn ∼ 0.04).20 While the birefringence of Cu3AsS4 at 0.62 eV is slightly smaller than 0.04 (Δn ∼ 0.038), the birefringence is larger than 0.04 as ℏω < 0.47 eV (λ > 2.6 μm). It suggests that Cu3AsS4 can realize phase-matching in most parts of the mid-IR spectrum. Different from the former five compounds, the birefringence of Cu3PSe4 is always smaller than 0.04 in the range of 0–1 eV (Δn ∼ 0.033 at ℏω = 0.62 eV). The relatively low birefringence of Cu3PSe4 would limit its phase-matching capability in practical applications.

3.4. Nonlinear optical properties
For calculating the static χ(2) coefficients, the so-called length-gauge formalism derived by Aversa and Sipe36 and modified by Rashkeev et al.59 is adopted, which has been proved to be successful in calculating the second order susceptibility for semiconductors and insulators.60–63 In the static case, the imaginary part of the static second-order optical susceptibility can be expressed as: (1)where r is the position operator, ℏωnm = ℏωn − ℏωm is the energy difference for the bands m and n, fmn = fm − fn is the difference of the Fermi distribution functions, subscripts a, b, and c are Cartesian indices, and rbmn;a is the so-called generalized derivative of the coordinate operator in k space, (2)where Δanm = (pann − pamm)/m is the difference between the electronic velocities at the bands n and m. As the nonlinear optical coefficients are sensitive to the momentum matrix, a much finer k-point grid and a large amount of empty bands are required to obtain a convergent χ(2) coefficient. The χ(2) coefficients here were calculated from PBE wavefunctions with a much finer 10 × 10 × 10 k-point grid and about 200 empty bands. A scissor operator has been added to correct the conduction band energy (corrected to the HSE06 gap, Table 1), which has been proved to be reliable in predicting the second order susceptibility for semiconductors and insulators.64–66
Since the I3–V–VI4 crystals belong to the Pmn21 symmetry group, there exist three non-zero independent χ(2) components: χ(2)xzx = χ(2)xxz = χ(2)zxx, χ(2)zyy = χ(2)yyz = χ(2)yzy, and χ(2)zzz. Customarily, the second-order coefficients are expressed by dij coefficients, which have the following relations with χ(2): d31 = 1/2χ(2)zxx, d32 = 1/2χ(2)zyy, and d33 = 1/2χ(2)zzz. As far as we know, there are no experimental values of dia available for all the six I3–V–VI4 crystals. To verify the method used in the current study for the assessment of SHG coefficients, the d36 (the only one nonvanishing independent component) values of the benchmark AgGaSe2, AgGaS2, and ZnGeP2 were also calculated. The obtained value of d36 for AgGaSe2 is 35.2 pm V−1, which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 32 ± 4 pm V−167 and some other theoretical results such as the values obtained by Song et al. (32.4 pm V−1)25 and Rashkeev et al. (32.8 pm V−1).18 The predicted d36 value for AgGaS2, and ZnGeP2 are 19.37 pm V−1 and 81.85 pm V−1, respectively, which also well reproduce the experimental results67 (12.5 ± 2.5 pm V−1 for AgGaS2, 75 ± 8 pm V−1 for ZnGeP2). It suggests that the method used here is adequate for predicting the static SHG coefficients for metal chalcogenides. Table 4 lists the obtained static SHG coefficients for all six I3–V–VI4 crystals. The magnitude of d33 is significantly larger than the other two components (d31 and d32). Specifically, Cu3AsS4 has the largest absolute value of d33 (62.567 pm V−1) than Ag3PSe4 and Cu3PSe4 (about 55 pm V−1). They are about twice the d36 value of AgGaSe2. For the Ag3PS4 and Ag3AsS4, their d33 values (30.623 and 35.285 pm V−1, respectively) are close to the d36 value of AgGaSe2. The Cu3PS4 crystal has the smallest d33 value (18.224 pm V−1, comparable to that of AgGaS2) due to its largest band gap. Fig. 6 also shows the frequency dependent SHG coefficient |d33| for the six I3–V–VI4 compounds in the energy range of 0–1.25 eV. The magnitude of d33 of all six compounds increases with the photon energy, reaching 33.66, 67.30, 41.19, 20.98, 82.68, 103.61 pm V−1 for Ag3PS4, Ag3PSe4, Ag3AsS4, Cu3PS4, Cu3PSe4, and Cu3AsS4, respectively, at λ = 2.1 μm. Specifically, the d33 values of Cu3PSe4 and Cu3AsS4 increase more rapidly than that of the other four compounds. The above results suggest that Cu3AsS4, Cu3PSe4 and Ag3PSe4 are potential mid-IR NLO crystals with large SHG coefficients.

 Fig. 6  Frequency-dependent SHG coefficient |d33| of I3–V–VI4 crystals (with I = Ag or Cu, V = P or As, and VI = S or Se). 
It is known that the SHG response is related to the polarity of the crystal, which is determined by the local dipole moment of each polar group and its geometric arrangement.68 There are four [I–VI4]1, two [I–VI4]2 and two [V–VI4] tetrahedra in a unit cell of this group I3–V–VI4 compounds. The local dipole moments of these tetrahedra were calculated by using the Gaussian 09 Package69 with a hybrid B3LYP functional. Fig. 1(b–d) illustrate the dipole moment vector of [AsS4], [CuS4]1, and [CuS4]2 tetrahedron, respectively. We see that the dipole moment is sensitive to the minor structural change of the tetrahedron. [I–VI4]1 and [I–VI4]2 possess quite different dipole moment vectors. More importantly, the dipole moments of all tetrahedra in Cu3AsS4 are found in the yz plane with μx = 0. In addition, the summation of μy of all tetrahedra in a unit cell is also equal to zero due to the opposite alignment of tetrahedron units (Fig. 1(e)). Therefore, the superposition of the μz of building units determines the total dipole moment μtotal of the unit cell. For Cu3AsS4, all three tetrahedra have positive values of μz, which contribute to a large net dipole moment along z direction. This well explains why d33 is the largest component of SHG coefficients. Table 4 lists the local μz values of the [I–VI4]1, [I–VI4]2 and [V–VI4] tetrahedra for the six compounds. It can be seen that the magnitude of μz of the three tetrahedra decreases in the order [I–VI4]1 > [I–VI4]2 > [V–VI4], revealing that [I–VI4] units play an important role in the polarity of the crystal. However, we note that it is hard to relate the SHG coefficient d33 to the superposition of local dipole moments of the building units due to the omission of the influence of the electronic structure. Table 4 shows that the total dipole moment (μtotal) within a unit cell of the six compounds does not follow the same trend as the SHG coefficient d33. We see from formula (1) that the SHG response is inversely correlated with the volume (Ω) and the square of band gaps (Eg2). A corrected total dipole moment (μc) is proposed here and defined as μc = μtotal/(Ω × Eg2). Interestingly, we find the magnitude of μc (Table 4) now follows the similar trend as the SHG coefficient d33, that is (Ag3PSe4, Cu3PSe4 and Cu3AsS4) > (Ag3PS4 and Ag3AsS4) > Cu3PS4. The results reveal that the total dipole moment (μtotal) and the electronic structures (Eg) are the two factors that must be considered in evaluating the SHG response. We see that μtotal (Ag3PS4) > μtotal (Ag3AsS4), meanwhile Eg (Ag3PS4) > Eg (Ag3AsS4), therefore the difference of d33 between Ag3PS4 and Ag3AsS4 is small due to the offset between μtotal and Eg. By contrast, for Cu3PS4 and Cu3AsS4, they possess similar total dipole moment, while significantly different band gap values. Therefore, the difference of d33 between Cu3PS4 and Cu3AsS4 is large. Although we have established that the [I–VI4] unit possesses larger local dipole moment (μz) than that of [V–VI4], the quantitative separation of individual contributions of [I–VI4] and [V–VI4] units to the electronic structure is difficult due to the overlap of atomic orbitals. We found, however, that the Eg value of Ag3PS4 (2.3 eV) is close to that of Cu3PS4 (2.54 eV), the Eg value of Ag3PSe4 (1.34 eV) is close to that of Cu3PSe4 (1.31 eV), and the Eg value of Ag3AsS4 (1.71 eV) is similar to that of Cu3AsS4 (1.31 eV). It indicates that the [V–VI4] unit plays an important role in determining the band gap. By further analyzing the projected DOS around the band gap (Fig. 3), we see that the bottom of conduction bands is mainly derived from the anti-bonding interaction between S/Se-sp and P/As-sp orbitals. The analysis suggests that the large dipole moment vector of the constituent asymmetry [I–VI4] tetrahedron and the strong covalent character between V and VI ions contribute to the large SHG response in these compounds.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have presented a systematic calculation of the structure, electronic, linear and nonlinear optical properties of the I3–V–VI4 crystals (with I = Ag or Cu, V = P or As, and VI = S or Se) based on first-principles hybrid functional calculations to assess their mid-IR NLO capabilities. The conclusions are as follows: (i) the electronic structure calculations show that Cu3PS4 has the largest band gap of 2.54 eV than Ag3PS4 of 2.3 eV. The other four I3–V–VI4 compounds have the band gap with the value ranging from 1.31 to 1.77 eV. Cu3PS4 and Ag3PS4 might have the larger laser damage threshold than the other four compounds; (ii) they possess suitable birefringence (0.04 < Δn < 0.1) to achieve the phase-matching conditions in the mid-IR region, except for Cu3PSe4, in which the Δn value is always smaller than 0.04 in the energy range of 0–1 eV; (iii) the static SHG coefficients d33 of Cu3AsS4, Ag3PSe4 and Cu3PSe4 are about twice d36 of commercially used IR nonlinear optical crystal AgGaSe2. The coupling of the large dipole moment vector of the constituent asymmetry [I–VI4] tetrahedron and the strong covalent character between V and VI ions contributes to the large SHG response in these compounds; and (iv) Cu3AsS4 possesses the largest SHG coefficient d33 in these compounds, moderate birefringence Δn, and is a very promising mid-IR nonlinear optical material.
