    , Accepted 18th March 2020First published on 18th March 2020AbstractHerein, we report the synthesis of a nanohybrid material with hierarchical Bi2MoO6 and g-C3N4 by a solvothermal method. It shows impressive performance towards photoelectrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications due to the formation of type-II heterostructures, a higher surface area of 60.7 m2g−1 (Bi2MoO6 – 44.0 m2 g−1) and higher wettability. The formation of type-II heterostructures reduces the electron–hole recombination and boosts up the interfacial charge transfer in g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6, and the nanohybrid material (10 wt% g-C3N4) shows about 7- and 20-fold higher PEC efficiency than that of Bi2MoO6 and g-C3N4 under illumination (100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G)). Besides, due to the combination of non-faradaic and faradaic processes, g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 (5 wt% g-C3N4) exhibits a high specific capacity of 1628 C g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 in a three-electrode configuration. The symmetric supercapacitor delivers a maximum cell voltage of 1.8 V with a high energy density and a power density of 47 W h kg−1 and 4500 W kg−1, respectively, and also shows excellent electrochemical stability with 90% capacitance retention even after 10000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1.
1. Introduction
At present, the transport sector is fundamentally relying upon fossil fuels, which cause greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and ecological contamination. This leads to the demand of zero-emission fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) (e.g., Toyota Mirai, Honda Clarity) to avoid environmental pollution and utilization of fossil fuels.1,2 In FCEVs, hydrogen is used as a fuel and the electrical engines are powered by fuel cells; moreover, fuel cells with electrical energy storage assemblies (batteries/supercapacitors) are used for rapid dynamic response, which makes it well suitable for practical applications.3,4 The development of a suitable method for the production of hydrogen and the construction of highly efficient electrical storage devices are needful for FCEVs.5–7 Among the various energy storage devices, electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors are the ultimate choice as next-generation energy storage devices owing to their high-power densities, long cyclic stability, high performance, eco-friendliness, safety and so on.8,9 Till date, hydrogen is produced by steam reforming and coal gasification methods from fossil fuels with by-products of CO, CO2 and other compounds, which is again polluting the environment.10 Therefore, the better way of producing hydrogen is splitting of water to make use of the energy derived from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower. Out of various water splitting methods, the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting via semiconductor electrodes is one of the most promising pathways for the production of hydrogen from more abundant resources such as sunlight and water.11,12 Recently, Bi-based oxides such as BiVO4, Bi2WO6, and Bi2MoO6 have been extensively utilized for PEC applications, due to their suitable band-gap and band edge positions.13–15 Among them, bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) is a promising photocatalyst with high visible-light absorbance and the valance band edge is suitable for water oxidation, and therefore, it is used as a photoanode in the PEC application.16,17 However, the high recombination rate of electron–hole pairs and slow charge-carrier transfer mobility have limited the performance of Bi2MoO6 in PEC water splitting.18 Moreover, the formation of heterostructures with other semiconductors that have appropriate band positions promotes electron–hole separation and enhances the PEC activity of Bi2MoO6.19 There are some examples of Bi2MoO6-based heterostructures used in PEC applications, which include Bi2MoO6/BiVO4,20 Bi2MoO6/TiO2,21 Bi2MoO6/Pd/TiO2,22 Bi2MoO6/ZnO,23 CdS/Bi2MoO6,24 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3,18 which show better PEC activity than bare-Bi2MoO6.
However, recent reports have suggested that Bi2MoO6 is not only an excellent photocatalyst, but also a good electrode material for supercapacitors.25–28 Ting Yu et al. report flower-like Bi2MoO6 hollow microspheres with a specific capacitance of 182 F g−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1.29 Bi2MoO6 nanosheet arrays on a Ni foam show a specific capacitance of 37.3 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1.30 However, the performance of these Bi2MoO6 supercapacitors is far below that required for practical applications. Moreover, metal oxide-based supercapacitors suffer from poor electronic conductivity, due to the semiconducting nature that reduces the capacitance retention and rate capability during fast charge–discharge processes.31 Therefore, improving electrical conductivity is a vital function of metal oxide-based supercapacitors, which is done by coupling with carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphenes (G), and graphene oxides (GO).32,33 For example, K. J. Samdani et al. report that Bi2MoO6 couples with carbon spheres (carbon sphere@Bi2MoO6), showing a high specific capacitance of 521.42 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared to bare-Bi2MoO6 (ref. 34) and F. Wu et al. report Bi2MoO6/PANI with a high specific capacitance of 826 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.35
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has a 2D layered semiconductor material with a narrowband-gap (∼2.7 eV) and suitable band structures for water splitting applications.36–38 g-C3N4 forms heterostructures with other semiconductors, thereby enhancing the PEC activity compared with individual semiconductors.39,40 For example, g-C3N4/TiO2,41,42 NiTiO3/g-C3N4,43 g-C3N4/Bi2O3/BiPO4,44 ZnO/ZnS/g-C3N4,45 g-C3N4/Pt/ZnO (ref. 46) and g-C3N4/BiVO4 (ref. 47) heterostructures show better PEC activity compared to bare materials, which is due to the suppression in the recombination of electron–hole pairs and therefore enhancement in the interfacial charge transfer process. Furthermore, the nitrogen content in g-C3N4 is comparatively high, which enhances the surface polarity and wettability, and consequently, improves the mass transfer efficiency.48–50 Despite the inherent low electronic conductivity, g-C3N4 is considered as a promising replacement of carbon nanotubes, graphenes and graphene oxides for the formation of hybrid electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors due to its ease of fabrication, low-cost, etc.51,52 For example, FeWO4/g-C3N4 composites exhibit a high specific capacitance of 357 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 compared with bare-FeWO4 (168 F g−1).53 H. L. Zhu et al. prepared Co3O4/g-C3N4 composites, which show a high specific capacitance of 780 F g−1 at 1.25 A g−1 compared with pure Co3O4 (419 F g−1).54 D. Jiang et al. report that g-C3N4/CoS composites exhibit an excellent high specific capacitance of 668 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 compared with bare-CoS.55 Similarly, Ni foam@Cu–AlLDH/g-C3N4,56 g-C3N4/Ni(OH)2,57 g-C3N4/SnO2 (ref. 48) and g-C3N4/MnO2 (ref. 48) showed enhanced capacitive performance compared with that of the individual components, indicating that the incorporation of g-C3N4 can significantly boost up the capacitance performance. These achievements inspired to study the g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid material for PEC water splitting and supercapacitor applications. Some of the reports are available based-on g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 composites for photocatalytic dye degradation applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focused on g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid materials for supercapacitor application.
Herein, we report the facile synthesis of g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid materials by a simple solvothermal method. The physicochemical and morphological properties of the synthesized materials were explored via suitable analytical techniques. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared g-C3N4, Bi2MoO6, and g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid materials was scrutinized under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination in 1 M KOH. g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 with 10 wt% of g-C3N4 photoanodes shows the highest photoelectrocatalytic efficiency, which is about 7- and 20-fold higher than that of bare-Bi2MoO6 and g-C3N4, respectively. The electrochemical properties of electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 3.5 M KOH electrolyte. From the CD profile, g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 with 5 wt% of g-C3N4 nanohybrid exhibits a high specific capacity of 1628 Cg−1 at 2 Ag−1 current density. The symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated, and it delivered a high energy and power density of 47 W h kg−1 and 4.5 kW kg−1, respectively. This g-C3N4/Bi2MoO6 nanohybrid material could be a potential candidate for multiple applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride
All solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade (SRL laboratories) and used without any further purification. The graphitic carbon nitride nanostructure was prepared by a simple pyrolysis polymerization method.58 Equal amounts of melamine and ammonium sulphate (1:1 wt. ratio) were mixed homogeneously, and the resulting powder was calcined at 520 °C for 2 h and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. Finally, the graphitic carbon nitride nanostructure (g-C3N4) was obtained.
2.2. Synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride-bismuth molybdate hybrid materials
The graphitic carbon nitride-bismuth molybdate (g-C3N4–Bi2MoO6) hybrid materials were prepared as follows (Scheme 1). First, an appropriate amount of g-C3N4 (1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12 wt%) was dispersed in 20 mL ethanol and sonicated for 30 min. At the same time, 2 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved into ethylene glycol under mild stirring, and after 15 min, 20 mL of 1 mmol (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in ethylene glycol was added into the solution, which results in a transparent solution. Then, the g-C3N4 suspension was added into the reaction mixture. Then, the resultant solution was loaded into a Teflon-lined autoclave, placed in an oven at 160 °C for 12 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The product was collected, washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol several times, and dried at 80 °C for 24 h.

For comparison, the pristine Bi2MoO6 was prepared by following the similar protocol without adding g-C3N4 in the first step. Hereafter, the samples were denoted as gCN (g-C3N4), BMO (Bi2MoO6), 1-gCN/BMO (1 wt% of g-C3N4), 3-gCN/BMO (3 wt% of g-C3N4), 5-gCN/BMO (5 wt% of g-C3N4), 7-gCN/BMO (7 wt% of g-C3N4), 10-gCN/BMO (10 wt% of g-C3N4) and 12-gCN/BVO (12 wt% of g-C3N4).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and morphological analysis of graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth molybdate hybrid materials
From the XRD pattern, the purity and crystallinity of the as-prepared gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials were obtained. In Fig. 1A, the XRD pattern of the pure BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials shows peaks at 10.86°, 28.27°, 32.54°, 35.92°, 46.74°, 55.16° and 58.30°, which are assigned to the (020), (131), (002), (151), (202), (133) and (262) crystal planes due to BMO; all the diffraction peaks can be perfectly indexed with the orthorhombic phase of BMO (JCPDS 76-2388).59 The XRD pattern of gCN shows two peaks, which are attributed to the (002) plane (peak at 27.50°) interplanar spacing and (100) (peak at 13.0°) in-plane structural repeating units of tri-s-triazine, respectively (JCPDS No: 87-1526).47,60 Moreover, no impurity peaks were observed, which demonstrate the high purity of the prepared materials. However, gCN/BMO hybrid materials with different weight percentages of gCN (Fig. S1A†) display only diffraction peaks of BMO, due to the small amount of gCN in the hybrid materials. The presence of gCN in nanohybrid materials has been further confirmed by FT-IR and XPS analyses.
 Fig. 1  (A) XRD patterns and (B) FTIR spectra of gCN, BMO and 10-gCN/BMO. 
In the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1B), the absorption bands at 950–625 cm−1 and 630–410 cm−1 in pure BMO are attributed to the Mo–O stretching vibrations and Bi–O stretching and deformation vibrations, respectively. The band at 738 cm−1 is ascribed to the asymmetric stretching vibrations of the equatorial oxygen atoms of MoO6, whereas the band at 552 cm−1 is ascribed to the bending vibration of the MoO6 octahedron.61 The gCN shows a sharp and distinct band at 810 cm−1, which is due to the out-of-plane ring bending of the triazine unit. The bands in the range of 1200 to 1700 cm−1 are assigned to the typical stretching vibration of the heptazine heterocyclic ring (C6N7).62 The N–H stretching vibration of the terminal –NH2 and –NH– group bands are observed at 3000 to 3500 cm−1. The FT-IR results of nanohybrid materials with different weight percentages of gCN (Fig. S1B†) clearly indicate the presence of gCN in hybrid materials. However, in hybrid materials, the structural integrity of BMO and gCN remains intact, which revealed the formation of heterostructures.

Fig. 2A shows the XPS survey scan spectra of BMO and gCN/BMO, and the survey spectra clearly indicate that both the samples contain Bi, Mo and O elements; meanwhile, additional peaks for carbon and nitrogen are present in the survey spectrum of gCN/BMO hybrid materials and it confirms the presence of gCN in hybrid materials. Fig. 2(B–F) displays the core-level spectra of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, O 1s, C 1s and N 1s state for the gCN/BMO hybrid material, respectively.

Fig. 2B shows the binding energies of 158.9 eV for Bi 4f7/2 and 164.2 eV for Bi 4f5/2 in gCN/BMO hybrid materials, which indicates the 3+ oxidation state of bismuth.63 In the core level spectrum of Mo 3d (Fig. 2C), peaks are observed at 232.1 and 235.2 eV due to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo6+, respectively.64 In the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2D), the peaks at 529.1, 530.0 and 531.1 eV are attributed to Bi–O, Mo–O and surface hydroxyl groups (O-H), respectively.63 The core level spectrum of C 1s (Fig. 2E) shows a peak at 285.7 eV, which corresponds to sp2-bonded carbon (N–CN) and the peak at 287.7 eV is due to atmospheric carbon on the surface of the material. Fig. 2F shows three deconvoluted peaks at 397.4, 398.2 and 400.5 eV, which confirm the presence of nitrogen attached to sp2-hybridized carbon atoms (CN–C), the amino groups (C–N–H) and N bonded with three carbon atoms (N–(C)3) in the aromatic ring, respectively.65 Moreover, in gCN/BMO hybrid materials, the binding energy of Bi3+ and Mo6+ slightly shifted towards higher binding energies as compared to pure BMO (Fig. 2G and H), which indicates the strong interactions between gCN and BMO, thereby the formation of heterostructures at the interfaces.
The morphology of the as-prepared gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO were investigated by FESEM analysis. The FESEM image of bare-BMO (Fig. 3A and B) clearly shows many hierarchical spheres with a diameter of ∼1 μm, and the high-magnification image (Fig. 3C) clearly displays the hierarchical spheres formed by the agglomeration of many BMO nanorods with a diameter <100 nm. The FESEM image of pure-gCN (Fig. S2†) displays a sheet-like morphology, but in gCN/BMO hybrids, the gCN shows a nanoparticle morphology. During the gCN/BMO hybrid synthesis, sonication in ethanol (exfoliation) followed by a solvothermal process, the gCN sheets are converted into nanoparticles. Moreover, the FESEM images (Fig. 3D–F) of gCN/BMO hybrid materials show the gCN nanoparticles uniformly covered on the hierarchical spheres of BMO, from which the formation of heterostructures between BMO and gCN was confirmed. Furthermore, the formation of heterostructures between BMO and gCN was demonstrated by STEM-EDX elemental mapping analysis.

Fig. 4 shows the STEM image of gCN/BMO hybrid materials and the corresponding elemental maps, which proved the homogeneous distribution of Bi, Mo, O, C and N elements in the hybrid material. Moreover, the homogeneous distribution of elements throughout the sample (in the long range of 50 μm) was evidenced by FESEM-EDX mapping analysis (Fig. S3†), and the results clearly indicate the formation of heterostructures and the uniform distribution of gCN nanoparticles throughout the sample.

3.2. Optical property of the graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth molybdate hybrid materials
The light harvesting property of the gCN/BMO hybrid materials was investigated by UV-visible DRS spectroscopy. Fig. 5A shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials, and the absorption edge of gCN, BMO and 10-gCN/BMO are 472, 509 and 499 nm, respectively, which shows that all prepared materials are strong harvesters of visible light. Moreover, increasing the weight percentage of gCN leads to a slight blue-shift (Fig. S5†) compared to bare-BMO. The optical band-gap of the materials was calculated from Tauc's plot (Fig. 5B). αhν = A(hν − Eg)n/2(1)where α, h, ν, Eg, and A are the absorption coefficient, Planck's constant, light frequency, optical band gap, and a constant, respectively, and the n value depends on the characteristics of the type of optical transition in the semiconductor.64,66,67 For gCN and BMO, the value of n is 1 corresponding to direct transition semiconductors (direct band-gap).68,69 Based on Tauc's plot, the calculated band-gap of gCN, BMO and 10-gCN/BMO are 2.70, 2.48 and 2.55 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 5  (A) UV-vis absorption spectra and (B) plots of (αhν)2vs. hν obtained for gCN, BMO and 10-gCN/BMO. 
3.3. Surface area and wettability analysis
The surface areas of gCN, BMO and 5-gCN/BMO were determined by BET analysis. Based on the BET analysis, the surface area of gCN, BMO and 5-gCN/BMO are 48.34, 44.04 and 60.73 m2 g−1, respectively. The result indicates that the introduction of gCN into BMO can enlarge the specific surface area, which introduced a greater number of reaction sites for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting, and that the surface area is directly proportional to the capacitance of supercapacitor electrodes.70–72 The surface wettability of gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO was investigated by contact angle measurement. The surface wettability plays an important role in the energy conversion and storage applications, which explain the effective contact between the electrode and electrolyte solutions.73 The high wettability of the electrode with the electrolyte leads to the diffusion of electrolytes into the inner layer of the material and enhances the charge carrier mobility, which improve the overall efficiency of the material toward energy conversion and storage applications.74
From the contact angle measurement (Fig. 6), gCN is more hydrophilic than BMO, due to the presence of lone-pair electrons in nitrogen, which gives more polarity to gCN. The gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials show lower contact angle (68.3°) than bare-BMO (83.7°), due to the hydrophilic nature of gCN.48 The result indicates that the hybrid materials effectively in contact with electrolytes enhance the charge carrier mobility and interfacial charge transfer, which improve the overall efficiency of the gCN/BMO hybrid materials toward photoelectrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitor applications.

3.4. Photoelectrocatalytic water splitting
The photoelectrocatalytic performance of the prepared materials towards water splitting was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques under darkness and illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) in 1 M KOH (pH = 13.22). In Fig. 7A, the dashed lines correspond to the dark current of the photoanodes fabricated by gCN, BMO and 10-gCN/BMO hybrid materials, which shows no significant current under dark condition. However, upon the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), improvement in current is noticed, clearly indicating that the fabricated photoanodes are photoactive, which could efficiently oxidize the water molecule into oxygen atoms. Moreover, the current density of pure-gCN (0.76 μA cm−2 at + 1.23 V vs. RHE) and bare-BMO (3.1 μA cm−2 at + 1.23 V vs. RHE) under illumination is lesser compared to gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials with different weight percentages of gCN, due to the high recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and less interfacial charge transfer in pure-gCN and bare-BMO. Fig. 7B shows the current density of the prepared materials at +1.23 V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent of the photoanodes follows the following order: gCN < BMO < 1-gCN/BMO < 12-gCN/BMO < 3-gCN/BMO < 5-gCN/BMO < 7-gCN/BMO < 10-gCN/BMO. The prepared gCN/BMO hybrid materials (Fig. S6B†) are having high PEC activity than bare-BMO and pure gCN, due to the formation of heterostructures between gCN and BMO, which leads to extremely large surface area that provides more reaction sites, less recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and rapid interfacial charge transfer. Under the optimum condition, for the gCN/BMO with 10 wt% of gCN having the highest PEC activity towards water splitting, the photocurrent of 10-gCN/BMO (21.19 μA cm−2 at +1.23 v vs. RHE) is ∼28- and ∼7-fold greater than those of gCN and BMO, respectively.
 Fig. 7  (A) Linear sweep voltammograms obtained for g-CN, BMO, 10-gCN/BMO under the dark and light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH; (B) photocurrent density of different photoanode materials under light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH; (C) linear sweep voltammograms obtained for gCN/BMO hybrid materials under chopped condition; and (D) chronoamperometric J–T curves of photoanodes prepared with BMO and 10-gCN/BMO at 0.8 V vs. Hg/HgO. 
The quick photo-response of the fabricated photoanodes was examined by LSV measurement under chopped illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 7C and D, displays the sudden rise and fall in the photocurrent, which demonstrates the quick generation of electron–hole pairs and ready response under the illumination due to the formation of heterostructures, which leads to the rapid charge transport in the photoanodes.75 The J–T curve (Fig. 7D) shows an enhanced PEC activity in gCN/BMO hybrid materials compared with bare-BMO, which suggests the fast surface oxidation kinetic of water molecules and suppressed electron–hole recombination in the nanohybrid material. Moreover, the steady photocurrent with respect to time proved the excellent photochemical stability of the gCN/BMO photoanode. Applied bias photo-current efficiency (ABPE) of the fabricated photoanodes was calculated from the J–V curve using eqn (2): (2)where Jphoto is the measured photocurrent at a particular applied potential (Eapp) and Pphoto is the power density of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2); Erc corresponds to the cell potential of the redox couple, and 1.23 VRHE corresponds to the standard cell potential for water splitting.43,76

Fig. 8A shows the plot of ABPE (%) vs. applied potential (vs. RHE), which is in good agreement with LSV results. The BMO and gCN show the maximum ABPE of 6.33 × 10−4 and 2.18 × 10−4%, respectively. However, photoanodes fabricated by gCN/BMO hybrid materials show higher efficiency (Fig. 8B) than BMO and gCN, 10-gCN/BMO yields a maximum efficiency of 4.44 × 10−3%, which is about 7- and 20-fold higher than that of bare-BMO and gCN, respectively.

The interfacial charge transfer process of the photoanodes was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. The diameter of semicircles in the Nyquist plot is related to the interfacial charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrodes.77Fig. 8C displays the Nyquist plot of gCN, BMO and 10-gCN/BMO under dark and illuminated conditions. It can be clearly seen that the Rct value is lower under illuminated conditions than under dark conditions, which suggests a rapid-interfacial charge transfer upon illumination. However, in darkness, the Rct value of the hybrid material is lower than that of bare-BMO due to the high surface area and high wettability compared with BMO, which enhances the charge transfer rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the case of electrodes fabricated by hybrid materials having lower Rct than gCN and BMO under illumination, a rapid-interfacial charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface is observed, which reduces the rate of electron–hole pair recombination and proves the formation of heterostructures between gCN and BMO.11 Among all the fabricated electrodes, 10-gCN/BMO possesses the smallest Rct value (Fig. 8D), which explains the enhanced PEC activity of 10-gCN/BMO. The results indicate the formation of heterostructure, which enhance the PEC activity of the nanohybrid materials towards water splitting by increasing the surface area, enhancing the charge transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface and reducing the recombination of charge carriers.
3.5. Charge transfer mechanism in the graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth molybdate hybrid material
The charge transfer mechanism in the heterostructure of gCN/BMO evolved from the valance band and conduction band potential level of gCN and BMO. The CB and VB levels of gCN and BMO were calculated using eqn (3) and (4): EVB = χ − Ee + 0.5Eg(3) ECB = EVB − Eg(4)where χ is Mulliken's electronegativity, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.50 eV) and Eg is the band gap.21 The absolute electronegativity of pure gCN and bare-BMO is 4.73 and 5.55 eV, respectively.78,79 Based on the equation, the calculated VB potential of BMO and gCN is +2.29 and +1.58 eV, respectively. The CB potentials of BMO and gCN are −0.19 and −1.12 eV, respectively.
The VB of BMO (+2.29 eV) is more positive than the VB of gCN (+1.58 eV); however, the CB of gCN (−1.12 eV) is more negative than the CB of BMO (−0.19 eV), which leads to the easy transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of gCN to the CB of BMO and the holes are moved from the VB of BMO to the VB of gCN. Therefore, the gCN/BMO heterostructure follows the type-II mechanism,19,59,80 in that the photogenerated electrons are accumulated in the CB of BMO, while the holes are populated in the VB of gCN, which is beneficial for the good separation of photoinduced charge carriers. Scheme 2 illustrates the overall water splitting mechanism in gCN/BMO hybrid materials based on type-II heterostructures.

3.6. Electrochemical studies of graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth molybdate hybrid materials
The electrochemical behaviour of gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials with different weight percentages of gCN was measured using three electrode configurations in 3.5 M KOH electrolyte. The cyclic voltammogram of gCN with different scan rates shows an ideal symmetric rectangular profile without any redox behavior, which suggests the pure EDLC behaviour of gCN (Fig. 9A). Fig. 9B and C displays the CV profiles of bare-BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials, and the obtained CV curves exhibit the set of reduction and oxidation peaks, which evidently proved the presence of the faradaic nature of the BMO. The redox peaks are assigned to the quasi-reversible faradaic process of Bi3+ ⇌ Bi0.81 The single reduction peak with high current at −0.60 V (vs. Hg/HgO) is attributed to the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi0 and the two oxidation peaks at −0.55 and −0.45 V are attributed to the oxidation of Bi to Bi+ and Bi+ to Bi3+. Meanwhile, molybdenum (Mo) is not involved in the redox reactions, but it improves the specific capacity by increasing the electrical conductivity.82 The probable mechanism of Bi3+ ⇌ Bi0 is as follows:28
 Fig. 9  CV profile of (A) gCN and (B) BMO electrode materials at different scan rates, respectively; (C) CV profile of 1-gCN/BMO, 3-gCN/BMO, 5-gCN/BMO, 7-gCN/BMO and 10-gCN/BMO nanohybrid electrode materials at 50 mV s−1 scan rate; (D) and (E) CD profile of gCN and BMO electrode materials at different current densities, respectively; (F) CD profile of 1-gCN/BMO, 3-gCN/BMO, 5-gCN/BMO, 7-gCN/BMO and 10-gCN/BMO nanohybrid electrode materials at a current density of 2 Ag−1. 
During reduction reaction:BiO2− + e− → BiO22−2H2O + 3BiO22− ⇄ 2BiO2− + 4OH− + Bi0Bi0 → BiDuring oxidation reaction:Bi → Bi+ + e−2Bi+ ⇄ Bi3+ + 2Bi3OH− + Bi3+ → Bi(OH)3Bi(OH)3 → BiOOH + H2OAdditionally, all CV curves show enhancement in the current density with retained shapes while increasing the scan rate (Fig. 9A and B and S7†), indicating the fast diffusion of electrolytes into the electrode and good capacitive behavior of the materials.26 Moreover, the BMO and gCN/BMO electrodes show predominant redox peaks and exhibit quick shifts while increasing the scan rates, suggesting the superior rate capability of the material.83 The CV curve of gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials showed more enclosed area, which leads to better capacitive behaviors in gCN/BMO hybrid materials compared to bare-gCN and bare-BMO.53 The specific capacity of gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO was calculated from the charge discharge profile. Fig. 9D and E displays the CD profile of gCN and BMO at different current rates, and the CD profile of gCN displays the linear and symmetrical nature, which further confirms the EDLC behaviour of the gCN and showed specific capacitance of 150 F g−1 at a current density of 2 Ag−1. The BMO CD profile is a non-linear pattern and shows the redox peaks within the potential range, which confirms the quasi-reversible faradaic process of Bi3+ ⇌ Bi0 and gives the specific capacity of 670 C g−1 at a current density of 2 Ag−1. The CV and CD profiles of other gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials at different scan rates and different current densities are shown in Fig. S7.† From the CD profile, the calculated specific capacity values of gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials with different weight percentages of gCN are given in Fig. 10D. From the observed results, it is clear that the nanohybrid materials have high specific capacity compared to bulk gCN and bare-BMO. This mixture of non-faradaic (gCN) and faradaic (BMO) materials will induce a strong interaction between the electrode and electrolyte (increase the wettability), which improves the rapid surface charge transfer reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface and capacitor behavior. Among all the hybrid materials, 5-gCN/BMO exhibited a high specific capacity value due to the synergistic effect of combinations of non-faradaic and faradaic mechanism for charge storage processes. The CD profile of 5-gCN/BMO electrode materials at different current densities is displayed in Fig. 10B. When the current density increased to 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 Ag−1, the 5-gCN/BMO electrode showed a superior rate capability with calculated specific capacity values of 1628, 1305, 1076, 940 and 580 C g−1, respectively. The CV and CD profiles of other gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials at different scan rates and different current densities are shown in Fig. S7.† The specific capacity of the gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO hybrid materials with respect to the current density are given in Fig. S8.†

3.7. Fabrication of graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth molybdate hybrid material-based symmetric supercapacitors
As of late, carbon-based materials are commonly utilized as electrode materials for non-aqueous-based supercapacitors of high cost. However, the non-aqueous-based supercapacitors have noteworthy points of interest like high power, high electrochemical stability, and more extensive working cell voltage. However, it has few limitations, for example low vitality thickness and staggering expense limit supercapacitor as an option for conventional energy storage devices. The exploration network needs to manufacture a supercapacitor to convey a high cell voltage, high vitality, and power thickness with minimal effort for future current innovation. For that, the symmetric supercapacitor cell was fabricated using two equal-mass-loaded 5-gCN/BMO hybrid electrodes in 3.5 M KOH electrolyte. The CV profile of the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor cell at different scan rates shows an operating cell voltage of 1.8 V (Fig. 11A). The shape of the CV profile is non-symmetrical with set reduction and oxidation peaks, which evidently proved the presence of faradaic nature of the BMO in the 5-gCN/BMO nanohybrid material. Fig. 11B illustrates the CD profile of fabricated symmetric supercapacitor cells at different current densities. From the CD profile, the calculated specific capacities of the electrode material (eqn. S5) are found to be 752, 568, 372, 336 and 220 C g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 A g−1, respectively. Scheme 3 illustrates the symmetric supercapacitor based on the synergistic effect of combinations of non-faradaic and faradaic mechanisms for charge storage processes. For further understanding of practical applications, the electrochemical stability of the electrode was also evaluated by CD analysis. The CD analysis was carried out at a high current density of 5 A g−1 for 10000 charge–discharge cycles (Fig. 11C). Even after 10000 charge–discharge cycles, 90% of the initial capacity was retained, which reveals the high reversibility of the electrode materials during the electrochemical charge–discharge process without any oxygen and hydrogen evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the best values and highly stable electrodes among the reported aqueous supercapacitors based on BMO (Table 1) and gCN (Table 2)-based electrode materials. Furthermore, the charge transfer process and the resistance associated with the electrode/electrolyte interface in the fabricated symmetric cell were studied by EIS measurement. EIS was performed in the frequency ranging from 10 MHz to 100 kHz with an alternate current amplitude of 5 mV. From the Nyquist plot in Fig. S9,† the vertical line in the high-frequency region (angle greater than 45°) represents the lower Warburg impedance (W). This indicates the good capacitive behavior of the material, and the smaller semicircle in the low-frequency region suggests the low charge-transfer resistance between the electrode and electrolyte. This result indicates that the fabricated symmetric cell has excellent electrical contact with minimum ionic and interface resistance.

The energy and power density of the supercapacitors are the important factors for actual applications. Fig. 11D illustrates the typical Ragone plot of the symmetric supercapacitor cell fabricated with the 5-gCN/BMO hybrid material at a cell voltage of 1.8 V. The energy and power density of the 5-gCN/BMO symmetric supercapacitor have been evaluated using eqn (S7) and (S8).† The fabricated symmetric cell exhibited a remarkably high energy density of 47 W h kg−1 and a power density of 904 W kg−1 at a current density of 2 Ag−1. Even at a high current density of 5 Ag−1, the fabricated symmetric cell delivered a high power density of 4500 W kg−1 and retained its energy density of 13.75 W h kg−1. The observed high energy and power densities are significantly higher than the reported values for BMO (Table 1) and gCN (Table 2)-based nanocomposite materials for symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolytes. It could be clearly seen from the Ragone plot that the symmetric supercapacitor cell can provide a high energy density without sacrificing much power density.
4. Conclusion
gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials with different weight percentages of gCN have been synthesized by a simple solvothermal method, and it has been confirmed by XRD, FT-IR and XPS analysis. The optical and morphological properties of the gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials have been investigated by UV-vis DRS spectroscopy, FE-SEM and HR-TEM analysis. The photoelectrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared gCN, BMO and gCN/BMO nanohybrid materials has been investigated under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination in 1 M KOH. The 10-gCN/BMO photoanode showed the highest photoelectrocatalytic efficiency, which is about 7- and 20-fold higher than that of the bare-BMO and gCN. The improved PEC performance in gCN/BMO nanohybrids could be explained by the formation of type-II heterostructures between gCN and BMO, which improved the interfacial charge transfer and reduced the charge recombination. The electrochemical properties of electrodes have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 3.5 M KOH electrolyte. From the CD profile, it was found that 5-gCN/BMO nanohybrid exhibits a high specific capacity of 1628 Cg−1 at 2 Ag−1 current density. The symmetric supercapacitor device has been fabricated by 5-gCN/BMO, and it delivered a high energy density and power density of 47 Wh kg−1 and 4.5 kW kg−1, respectively. This exhibits excellent electrochemical stability and shows 90% retention even after 10000 cycles at a current density of 5 Ag−1. The results indicated that the gCN/BMO nanohybrid material could be a potential candidate for photoelectrocatalytic and supercapacitor applications.
