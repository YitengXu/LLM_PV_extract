    , Accepted 1st June 2018First published on 4th June 2018AbstractDespite their high power conversion efficiency, the commercial applications of hybrid organic–inorganic lead (Pb) halide perovskite based solar cells are still hampered by concerns about the toxicity of Pb and the structural stability in open air. Herein, based on density-functional theory computation, we show that lead-free tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge) based two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites with a thickness of a few unit-cells, BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Sn or Ge, n = 2–4), possess desirable electronic, excitonic and light absorption properties, thereby showing promise for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications. In particular, we show that by increasing the layer thickness of the Sn-based 2D perovskites, the bandgap can be lowered towards the optimal range (0.9–1.6 eV) for solar cells. Meanwhile, the exciton binding energy is reduced to a more optimal value. In addition, theoretical assessment indicates that the thermodynamic stability of Sn-/Ge-based 2D perovskites is notably enhanced compared to that of their 3D analogues. These features render the Sn-/Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites with a thickness of a few tens of unit cells promising lead-free perovskites with much improved structural stabilities for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications.
Hybrid organic–inorganic lead (Pb) halide perovskites, commonly referred to as methylammonium (MA: CH3NH3+) lead iodide (MAPbI3) or formamidinium (FA: NH2CHNH2+) lead iodide (FAPbI3), have been broadly recognized as a promising candidate for the next-generation cost-effective solar cells and have reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as ∼22.7%.1,2 Despite their high PCE, the poor open-air stability of bulk MAPbI3/FAPbI3 perovskite solar cell (PSC) remains a challenge for large-scale commercial applications.3 The use of the toxic element Pb in MAPbI3/FAPbI3 based PSCs is also a concern for the environment and health.4,5
Numerous strategies have been proposed to resolve the instability issue of the PSCs, such as changing or mixing the halide ions and/or organic cations, altering the electron and/or hole transport materials (ETMs/HTMs) or modifying the additives of the ETMs/HTMs.6 Recent studies suggested that by inserting bulky alkylammonium cations, e.g., butylammonium (BA: C4H9NH3+) or phenylethylammonium (PEA: C8H9NH3+), three-dimensional (3D) MAPbI3 can be sliced into a 2D Ruddlesden–Popper form with a general formula of A2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (A = PEA, BA, etc.). Previous experiments showed that the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskites exhibit highly enhanced moisture stability, compared to that of the 3D analogue, due to the protective organic ligand layer made of PEA or BA.7–14 The planar structures of 2D hybrid perovskites enable efficient encapsulation which further improves the open-air stability. In addition to the improved stability, the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper A2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with high n values (n ≥ 3) are quite promising for use in a PSC device with a rapid increase of PCE from initial values of 4.02–4.73%8,9 to 12.5%.11 Recently, a certified PCE of 15.3% for PEA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 with n = 60 was reported along with highly improved device performance longevity.10
Meanwhile, many efforts have been devoted to finding efficient lead-free perovskites. Strategies reported thus far include replacing all or a partial amount of the Pb with tin (Sn) or germanium (Ge) or mixed Sn–Ge in the perovskites.4,5,15–17 However, the Ge- and Sn-based hybrid perovskites still have similar instability issues as both perovskites can be easily oxidized from a +2 to +4 valence state, thereby disrupting the initial perovskite structures.4,5 To date, very limited experimental trials have been undertaken for the synthesis and device fabrication of Sn and Ge-based hybrid perovskites, which largely impedes their advancements.5 Another strategy to obtain Pb-free or Pb-less perovskite materials is to synthesize chalcogenide-based perovskites or double perovskites,18–21 although the PCE values reported thus far are still low.
The much-enhanced stability of 2D Pb-based perovskites motivated this study to examine the properties of Sn- and Ge-based 2D Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskites with reduced dimensionality whilst improving the stability. Note that previous experimental studies already demonstrated the feasibility of Sn- and Ge-based 2D Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid perovskites about two decades ago.7,22,23 In addition, previous studies suggested that single-unit-cell-thick (n = 1) BA2SnI4 and BA2GeI4 can serve as lead-free 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductors with tunable bandgaps and small effective carrier masses, which suggests that BA2SnI4 and BA2GeI4 have good potential for photoelectronic applications.24,25
However, as a trade-off for the improved stability, the bandgaps of the thinnest 2D hybrid perovskites, BA2MI4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb) with single-unit-cell thickness (n = 1), are much larger than those of bulk MAPbI3, and are all beyond the optimal range of 0.9–1.6 eV for solar cells.26 Moreover, their higher exciton binding energies make the separation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs (excitons) harder, which is due to the quantum confinement effect associated with reduced dimensionality.24 Hence, a natural strategy would be to increase the layer thickness (n) of the 2D hybrid perovskites to gain back some of the properties of their 3D analogues, such as smaller bandgaps and reduced exciton binding energies, as well as improved light absorption, while retaining the good stability of the 2D forms.27
In this work, we investigate the electronic and excitonic properties of Sn- and Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites with a thickness of a few unit-cells, BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Sn or Ge, n = 2–4), via ab initio computational methods. We find that both the bandgaps and exciton binding energies of the 2D hybrid perovskites can be gradually reduced by increasing n from 2 to 4. We note that very recently, 2D Sn-based PSCs with n = 2–6 have been experimentally fabricated with PCE values of 1.94% (for n = 3) and 2.53% (for n = 4).28 The much thicker (n = 9) 2D Sn-based PSCs yield a PCE of 5.94% without further device-structure engineering.29 The latter PCE value is very close to the state-of-the-art value (6.4%) achieved with the lead-free perovskite MASnI3.30 By mixing the 2D Sn-based perovskites with 3D FASnI3, highly reproducible Sn-based PSCs with 9% PCE are achieved experimentally with much improved stability.31 Further improvement of the PCE and stability of 2D Sn-based PSCs is highly anticipated.
The density-functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.4).32,33 The projected augmented wave (PAW) method and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) were employed.34–36 The Grimme's DFT-D3 scheme was adopted to describe the dispersion correction.37 For bandgap computation, the more accurate PBE038 hybrid functional was used to obtain the electronic structures of the Sn- and Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites. The spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect was included in the DFT computations. More computational details can be found in part I of the ESI.†
The structure schemes of 2D BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) and 3D β-phase MASnI3 (n → ∞) are presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively (see ESI Fig. S1 and S2† for the Ge and Pb cases). The lattice constants computed based on the PBE + D3 method are presented in ESI Table S1,† and the values are in good agreement with experimental results. These 2D perovskite structures consist of multiple inorganic sheets of corner-sharing [MI6]4− octahedra terminated by intercalated bulky BA cations from two opposite surfaces. As the [MI6]4− octahedral sheet number n increases, the 2D hybrid perovskite structures slowly approach their corresponding 3D bulk structure. It is expected that their bandgaps decrease and gradually approach that of the 3D bulk.

Fig. 2 shows the bandgaps of BA2MAn−1GenI3n+1, BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 and BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–4 and ∞) computed via hybrid functional + SOC schemes. Note that the computed bandgaps, 2.04 eV, 1.27 eV and 1.39 eV, are in good agreement with the measured ones, i.e., 1.9–2.0 eV,17,39 1.2–1.3 eV15,28,30 and ∼1.5 eV,40 for MAGeI3, MASnI3 and MAPbI3, respectively, which validates our theoretical approach (see part II of the ESI†). Nearly all of the computed bandgaps of the 2D hybrid perovskites are reduced by increasing the layer thickness (n). The two exceptions are BA2GeI4 and BA2MAGe2I7, with the bandgap of the latter perovskite being larger than that of the former perovskite by 0.08 eV. The difference can be understood to be a result of the lattice expansion of BA2MAGe2I7 caused by the MA ion which is absent in BA2GeI4. As the atomic radius of Ge (1.25 Å) is less than that of Sn (1.45 Å) and Pb (1.54 Å),41 the lattice constants of BA2GeI4 are less than those of BA2SnI4 and BA2PbI4 by ∼2%–3% along the a axis and ∼4%–5% along the b axis (see ESI Table S1†), respectively, thereby resulting in smaller interspaces between the [GeI6]4− octahedrons. From single to double [GeI6]4− octahedral sheets, the lattice constant along the b axis is enlarged by ∼3.6% to accommodate the MA ions, compared with the enlargements of ∼1.7% and ∼1.2% for the cases of Sn and Pb, respectively. The lattice expansion induced excess strain is responsible for the anomalous bandgap increase from BA2GeI4 to BA2MAGe2I7. Beyond the thickness of the latter, the bandgaps of BA2MAn−1GenI3n+1 monotonically decrease with an increase in the number of [GeI6]4− octahedral sheets from n = 2 to 4 within the individual layer. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the bandgaps of Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites decrease monotonically as n increases, eventually approaching the bandgap of 3D MASnI3. The latter bandgap is within the optimal range (0.9–1.6 eV) for solar cells. It is thus reasonable to expect that the Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites with a high layer-number (n > 4) will show optimal bandgaps for solar cells while their stabilities would be superior to their 3D analogues (as will be discussed later). Although the bandgaps of Ge-based 2D perovskites are all above the optimal range for solar cells, they could still be used in tandem solar cells to promote open circuit voltage.39

As the bandgaps of the Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites (n = 3–4) are closer to the optimal bandgaps of light absorber materials, the calculated electronic band structures of BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 3–4) are shown in Fig. 3. The Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites with n = 3–4 are also included for comparison (see ESI Fig. S3†for Sn- and Ge-based 2D perovskites with n = 1–2 and Fig. S4† for the Pb case). The 2D hybrid perovskites are all direct-gap semiconductors with a valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the Gamma (G) point. It is known that the carrier (hole and electron) mobility plays a vital role in the performance of solar cells, a property also closely related to the carrier effective mass. We calculated the effective masses of the hole () and electron () based on the band structures and the formula m* = ħ2/(∂2E/∂k2), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, k is the magnitude of the wave vector in momentum space, and ∂2E/∂k2 is obtained by fitting the energy dispersion curves near the VBM and CBM with a simple parabolic function for the hole and electron, respectively. Both hole and electron effective masses increase with the layer thickness n for the Ge- and Sn-based 2D perovskites (see ESI Tables S5 and S6†). As the SOC induced energy band spin splitting also increases with the 2D perovskite thickness, slightly non-parabolic behavior arises from the crossing of the sub-band, resulting in the increase of carrier effective mass.27 Previously, a similar trend has been experimentally observed in the 2D quantum wells of carbon-doped (100) GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs heterostructures which might be saturated at a critical thickness.42
 Fig. 3  The computed band structures of BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Ge or Sn, n = 3–4) based on the PBE0 + SOC scheme. G (0, 0, 0), X (0.5, 0, 0) and Y (0, 0.5, 0) are the high-symmetry special points in the first Brillouin zone. The Fermi level is set to zero. 
The 2D hybrid perovskites can be considered to have a heterogeneously stacked sandwich structure. The enhanced carrier effective mass for the 2D hybrid perovskites is expected to be saturated at a critical value of n. Indeed, we find that the carrier effective masses of BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 increase from n = 1–3 but decrease from n = 3–4 (see ESI Table S7†). So we predict that for Pb-based 2D perovskites the critical value of n is around n = 4, consistent with the results of a recent study.43 For the Sn- and Ge-based 2D perovskites, however, determination of the critical value of n is beyond our current computational capability, thus it calls for future experimental determination. The effective masses of Ge- and Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites are generally smaller than those of their Pb counterparts, implying that higher carrier mobility may be expected for the Ge- and Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites. Likewise, bulk MASnI3 has a very high carrier mobility of over 2000 cm2/(V s), measured from a previous experiment.40
The in-plane Wannier–Mott exciton binding energy (Eb) of the 2D hybrid perovskites can be estimated using a modified hydrogen-atom-like Bohr model, Eb = μe4/2ħ2ε2,44 where ε is the dielectric constant calculated by the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT),45 is the reduced effective mass of the exciton (hole–electron pair) and e is the charge of the electron (see ESI Tables S5–S7†). As expected, Eb decreases as thickness n is increased due to the reduced bandgaps and enhanced dielectric properties for all of the 2D hybrid perovskites. It is shown that the Eb values of Ge- and Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites are much smaller than that of their Pb counterpart, and the Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskite has the smallest Eb at the same n. Thus, the separation of photo-excited excitons (electron–hole pairs) into free carriers would be easier in Ge- and Sn-based 2D hybrid perovskites than in their Pb counterpart. Further reduction of Eb is highly feasible by increasing n, rendering thicker (n > 4) 2D hybrid perovskites more suitable for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications.
As sunlight absorption of absorber materials is critical to the performance of solar cells, we compute the absorption properties of the Sn- and Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites, namely, the absorption coefficient α based on the formula46 (1)where υ is the photon frequency, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and ε1(υ) and ε2(υ) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. Note that computation of the absorption spectra based on the PBE0 + SOC scheme is extremely expensive due to the need of a much denser k-point grid (see part I of the ESI†). Hence, we calculate the absorption spectra of the 2D hybrid perovskites (n = 2–4) using the PBE functional, followed by shifting the absorption peak by ΔPBE0 − ΔPBE (Δ: bandgap). As shown in Fig. 4, the light absorption of Sn- and Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites over the visible light range can be improved by increasing the layer thickness n. A similar trend can be seen for the Pb-based 2D hybrid perovskites (see ESI Fig. S5†). Therefore, thicker (n > 4) 2D hybrid perovskites are expected to be more desirable for solar cell devices. Moreover, the light absorption of Sn-based 2D perovskites is expected to be better than that of the Ge-based 2D perovskites in the visible light range due to the smaller fundamental bandgaps of Sn-based perovskites.

Experimentally, the temporal stability of 2D perovskites is superior to that of their 3D analogues.28 This is partially due to the protective organic ligand layer. However, a deeper understanding of the improved stability of 2D hybrid perovskites is still required. To this end, we assess the thermodynamic stability of 2D perovskites BA2MAn–1MnI3n+1 (M = Ge or Sn, Pb) by computing the decomposition enthalpy (ΔHdec), defined as the energy change from the decomposition of the 2D perovskites. A negative ΔHdec value means that the decomposition is endothermic and thermodynamically unfavorable, whereas a positive ΔHdec value means that the decomposition is exothermic and is thermodynamically favorable. One possible pathway (pathway 1) is simply given by29 BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 → 2BAI + (n–1)MAI + nMI2(2)where M = Ge, Sn or Pb and n = 1–4 or ∞ (3D). Since Sn2+/Ge2+ can be readily oxidized to Sn4+/Ge4+, another possible decomposition pathway (pathway 2) involving oxygen for Sn- and Ge-based 2D perovskites is given by (3)
The computed decomposition enthalpies (per metal atom) of the corresponding pathways (1 for Ge, Sn and Pb; and 2 for Ge and Sn) of the 2D hybrid perovskites versus thickness n are presented in Fig. 5 and ESI Table S8.† The negative ΔHdec in the lower half of Fig. 5 suggests that the Ge/Sn/Pb-based 2D perovskites are all stable with respect to pathway 1, while the positive ΔHdec in the upper half of Fig. 5 indicates that the Ge/Sn/Pb-based 2D perovskites are unstable with respect to pathway 2. The ΔHdec decreases as n decreases. Hence, ΔHdec for n = ∞ (3D MAMI3) is the highest value and that for n = 1 is the lowest value for both pathways. The positive value of ΔHdec for pathway 2 suggests that the oxidation of Sn- and Ge-based perovskites in air is exothermic, and is thus thermodynamically favourable, while the significant decrease of ΔHdec with a decrease of n for pathway 2 implies that the oxidation resistance of Sn- and Ge-based 2D perovskites is higher for smaller n values, similar to the elevated moisture resistance of 2D perovskites, due to encapsulation by the organic ligand layer and reduced dimensionality.8,29 Also, the positive value of ΔHdec for pathway 2 with the involvement of oxygen implies that further improved encapsulation techniques are critical to the protection of Sn- and Ge-based 2D perovskites from contact with oxygen. The higher members of 2D perovskites (n > 4) are expected to show less advantages than those with n = 1–4 with regards to thermodynamic stability but could be still superior to their 3D analogues. On the other hand, the efficiency of 2D perovskites solar cells is expected to be promoted as n increases. Thus, finding the balance between a respectable efficiency and acceptable stability for 2D hybrid perovskites solar cells would be a future direction for 2D perovskite research.

Only the +2 valence state of the metal ion is considered in pathway 1 (eqn (2)) and no oxygen is involved, while pathway 2 (eqn (3)) is merely based on Sn4+/Ge4+ ions with oxygen involved. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have investigated the electronic, excitonic and light-absorption properties of Sn- and Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites, BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Sn or Ge, n = 2–4), with a thickness of a few unit-cells. We find that their bandgaps decrease from 2.04 eV to 1.75 eV for Sn-based and from 2.35 eV to 2.29 eV for Ge-based 2D perovskites, respectively, by increasing the layer thickness from n = 1 to 4. The bandgaps of Sn-based 2D perovskites approach the optimal bandgap range for solar cells. The smaller carrier effective masses of the Sn- or Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites imply that their carrier mobility may be higher than that of their Pb counterpart. The exciton binding energies are also reduced while the light absorption is improved with increasing layer thickness. We expect that Sn- and Ge-based 2D hybrid perovskites with a thickness of several to tens of unit-cells would exhibit even smaller bandgaps, more reduced exciton binding energies and better light absorption. In addition, it is found that the thermodynamic stability of 2D perovskites is notably enhanced compared to that of their 3D analogues. All of these features of Sn- and Ge-based 2D perovskites are highly desirable for the design of lead-free hybrid perovskites for photovoltaic and/or photoelectronic applications with reasonable performance and greatly enhanced device longevity.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Structure schemes of BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 (n = 1–4) and (b) MASnI3 (n → ∞). Examples of the atomic view of the unit cell of BA2MA3Sn4I13 (n = 4) along the (c) c-axis, (d) a-axis and (e) b-axis, respectively (all hydrogen atoms are removed for clarity).	 

 	Fig. 2  The computed electronic bandgaps of BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Ge or Sn and Pb; n = 1–4 and ∞) based on the hybrid functional plus SOC schemes. The light-green horizontal bar denotes the optimal bandgap range (0.9–1.6 eV) for solar cells.	 

 	Fig. 3  The computed band structures of BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Ge or Sn, n = 3–4) based on the PBE0 + SOC scheme. G (0, 0, 0), X (0.5, 0, 0) and Y (0, 0.5, 0) are the high-symmetry special points in the first Brillouin zone. The Fermi level is set to zero.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 4  The computed light absorption spectra of BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 (left panel) and BA2MAn−1GenI3n+1 (right panel) for n = 2–4. The light-grey vertical bar denotes the photon energy range of visible light (wavelengths from ∼390 nm–700 nm).	 
BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 → 2BAI + (n–1)MAI + nMI2	(2)
	(3)

 	Fig. 5  The calculated decomposition enthalpy (per metal atom) with respect to two possible pathways (lower half for pathway 1 and upper half for pathway 2) of BA2MAn−1MnI3n+1 (M = Ge, Sn or Pb, n = 1–4 and ∞). Only the +2 valence state of the metal ion is considered in pathway 1 (eqn (2)) and no oxygen is involved, while pathway 2 (eqn (3)) is merely based on Sn4+/Ge4+ ions with oxygen involved.
