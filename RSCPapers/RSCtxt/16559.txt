    , Accepted 9th January 2012First published on 8th February 2012AbstractWe investigated the effect of power dissipation on microwave-accelerated simultaneous extraction and transesterification of dry algal biomass (Nannochloropsis salina) to biodiesel. The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to design the experiments and optimize the process parameters, including dry algae to methanol ratio, reaction time and catalyst concentrations, by evaluating their influences on the fatty acid methyl ester yield (FAME) under controlled microwave power conditions. The microwave energy utilization efficiency was estimated at various power levels to optimize the power dissipation, maximize FAME yields and minimize energy losses. The algal biomass characterization and algal biodiesel analysis were performed using various analytical instruments such as FTIR, SEM-EDS, TGA and GC-MS. The Nile Red method was applied for lipid localization in microalgae cells using confocal microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The direct conversion technique has the potential to provide energy-efficient and economical routes for biodiesel production from algal biomass.
Introduction
Conventional energy sources are finite and their combustion to derive energy is an unsustainable practice as it results in the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the environment.1,2 Biofuels are well accepted as potential alternatives to replace and combat the negative effects of conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels. Among all the renewable biofuels sources today, biodiesel from renewable feedstocks looks more promising as an alternative sustainable fuel as it is biodegradable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly.3,4 Algae have long been considered as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production due to high oil content, rapid growth rate, high per-acre yield and ability to reduce the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere.5–8 However, the extensive upstream and downstream processing makes algal biodiesel production an expensive process. Therefore, it is critical to improve and optimize the algal biodiesel production process to provide a sustainable component to the solution of the worldwide energy crisis.
Transesterification of algal biomass or lipid to yield biodiesel can be performed by the following methods: (1) conventional heating,9 (2) supercritical methanol conditions,10 (3) enzyme-catalyzed method,11 and (4) microwave irradiation.12 Among these methods, conventional heating requires longer reaction times with higher-energy inputs and losses to the environment. Supercritical methanol processing operates in expensive reactors at high temperatures and pressures resulting in higher-energy inputs and higher production costs. The enzymatic transesterification reaction proceeds with a slower reaction rate and there is a strong possibility of enzyme inactivation by methanol during the process. Of the four methods, microwave-assisted transesterification, is the most energy-efficient, quick and reliable process to produce biodiesel from algal biomass.
Microwave irradiation has been used to extract oils from biomass, soils and vegetable feedstock.13–17 The main advantage of using microwave accelerated organic synthesis is the shorter reaction time due to rate enhancement. The rate of reaction can be described by the Arrhenius equation as: K = Ae−ΔG/RT, where ‘A’ is a pre-exponential factor, ‘ΔG’ is free energy of activation. The rate of chemical reaction can be increased through the pre-exponential factor A, which is the molecular mobility that depends on the frequency of the vibrations of the molecules at the reaction interface18 or the pre-exponential factor can be altered by affecting the free energy of activation.19 The two basic mechanisms of oil extraction from algal biomass observed during a microwave irradiation process are reported as: (1) diffusion of lipids across the cell wall into the solvent due to selectivity and solubility; and (2) disruption of the cell wall with a release of contents into the solvent.20 The direct conversion (in situ transesterification) of algal biomass under microwave irradiation conditions has proven to be an effective method for biodiesel production as this method achieves a high degree of oil–lipid removal from the dry algal biomass and efficiently converts oils–lipids to biodiesel.12,21 It also reduces the reaction time and the solvent volume as compared with the separate lipid extraction and transesterification processes. However, the application of suitable power dissipation control in microwave-assisted transesterification reactions may result in greater benefits in terms of energy efficiency and reaction product yield.
The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of power dissipation on microwave-enhanced in situ transesterification of dry algal biomass (Nannochloropsis salina) to biodiesel fuel. A response surface methodology technique is applied to optimize the influence of process parameters on the FAME yield under controlled microwave power conditions. The microwave energy efficiency calculation indicates that appropriate application of power dissipation control will result in effective use of microwave energy to achieve better reaction product yield. The results for algal biodiesel obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are presented.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Algal paste from outdoor open raceways (inoculum Nannochloropsis salina) provided by Solix biofuels was used in this study. For GC-MS analysis, FAME 37 comp. mixture 10 mg mL−1 in methylene chloride (47885U) and internal standard kit (44898U) were purchased from Supelco® Analytical. Extra pure (99%) methanol, hexane, potassium hydroxide flakes (KOH) and activated carbon were procured from Acros Organics. For FTIR analysis, KBr IR cards were obtained from International Crystal Lab. All chemicals were at least of A.C.S. grade.
Apparatus
The experiments were performed in an Anton Paar Synthos 3000 microwave reactor (Operating parameters: 0–80 bar, 25–300 °C, 0–1400 W, 12–60 mL per reactor tube with 8 tubes) enclosed with a specially designed rotor with robust quartz glass vessels (8SXQ80) which enable reactions under extreme pressure and temperature conditions that are difficult to reach safely with conventional systems. The Synthos 3000 microwave reactor also allows the use of gaseous reagents up to 20 bar of either inert gas (argon, nitrogen) or reactive gas (CO2, Cl2, ethylene, etc.) for microwave-mediated synthesis. Both the power- and temperature-controlled methods can be achieved for organic synthesis with this microwave reactor.
Characteristics of Nannochloropsis salina algal species
Qualitative elemental analysis of algal biomass was determined by scanning electron microscopy equipped for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The major elements and their approximate composition in (wt%) were carbon (70.43%), oxygen (22.19%), sodium (0.74%), magnesium (1.16%), phosphorous (2.42%), chlorine (0.36%), and potassium (1.32%), calcium (0.94%), sulfur (0.34%). It is important to note that the elemental composition for N. salina is dependent on various harvesting conditions, cultivation periods and isolation methods.22 The total lipid content in algal biomass was determined as 50–55% (% of dry biomass) by Folch method. The lipid composition is 75% triglycerides (TAG), 8% polar lipids, 2% hydrocarbons, and the rest being pigments, free fatty acids, and other various molecules. The FTIR spectra of the N. salina algal species show the same general features indicating: (i) a highly aliphatic character of the residues revealed by strong absorption at 730 cm−1, (ii) the presence of hydroxyl groups (non-bonded) characterized by absorption centered at 3300 cm−1, and (iii) the presence of carboxyl acid ester groups possibly aliphatic characterized by absorption band at 1710 cm−1, (iv) the presence of carbonyl groups indicated by the absorption band at about 1740 cm−1.
The fatty acid composition (% as methyl esters) in the algal lipid was reported as: tetradecanoic acid, C14:0 (3.76%); hexadecanoic acid, C16:0 (36.34%); hexadecanoic acid, C16:1n7 (33.06%); cis-9-octadecanoic acid, C18:1n9c (14.24%); cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid, C18:2n6c (2.61%); cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, C18:3n3 (1.40%); cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentenoic acid, C20:5n3 (8.48%). The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was calculated to be 1.50. The low ratios of the sums of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids indicate the suitability of N. salina as a potential source for the production of biodiesel. One possible method to increase the economic feasibility of microalgal biofuel production is to coproduce high-value products along with the biofuels.23 Some of the high value bio-products that can be extracted from microalgae are phycobiliproteins carotenoids (e.g. indole, oxalic acid, diethyl phthalate, naphthalene); polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins (e.g. ascorbic acid).
Pre-treatment of algal biomass
Wet algal paste (frozen biomass stored at −80 °C) received from Solix biofuels was sun dried (open-air solar drying) for 2–3 days. Dry algal powder was obtained by breaking the individual algal biomass cells in liquid N2 with a mortar and pestle and rupturing it in the laboratory grinder. Pretreatment methods, such as drying and cell disruption of algal biomass have been demonstrated to aid lipid extraction.24–26 One major benefit of processing dried biomass is better percolation of the solvents through the biomass, leading to an increase in lipid extraction.25,27 The minimal quantity of liquid nitrogen quantity was used in the pretreatment process. Liquid N2 is non-toxic and does not have any adverse effects from discharging into the environment. The solar drying process was employed to dry the wet algal biomass as it is a low-cost quality drying method that preserves high-value bio-products and maintains bioavailability.28 It has been reported that 1 kg of algal biodiesel production from wet algae requires 42.3 MJ and the same from dry algae requires 107.3 MJ. According to a previous study, drying of the algae accounts for a major portion (∼84%) of the total energy consumption. If the free solar energy is utilized for drying the algal biomass, the energy requirements for dry algae biodiesel production can be reduced to as low as 17 MJ with 56% energy consumption for extraction and transesterification.29
Experimental procedures
The experimental protocol for the single-step microwave-assisted extraction and transesterification process for dry algal (N. salina) biomass is illustrated in Fig. 1. The calculated amount of dry algae powder was added to the premixed homogeneous solution of methanol and KOH catalyst. The reactions were conducted under a variety of conditions: power dissipation of 700, 1000 and 1400 W; reaction times of 4, 7 and 10 min; catalyst (KOH) concentrations in the range of 1–3 wt% of dry biomass; and dry algae to methanol (wt/vol) ratios of 1:9–1:15. Averages of test results obtained for three repetitive tests were analyzed to evaluate the reproducibility of the microwave effect. The downstream process includes volatilization of methanol, separation and purification of crude FAME to pure algal biodiesel. The purification was done with the aid of subsequent dilution of n-hexane and filtering through activated carbon using 1.2 μm GFC filter in a step-wise manner. The resulting product is then dried with sodium sulfate and analyzed with GC-MS, FTIR and TGA. TGA analysis revealed that there was still moisture (8–10%) left in the dry algal biomass sample. The process parameters were selected and optimized for FAME calculation based on these tolerable concentrations of the moisture content in the dry algae sample. The lipid extracted-algae (LEA) was further processed for nutritional and toxicological analysis to demonstrate the suitability of algae biomass as a valuable feed supplement or substitute for conventional protein sources. The exact composition of LEA depends on the algal species as well as the growth conditions and the lipid extractive-transesterification methods used. The high microwave power reaction chemistry was employed to accelerate the extraction of lipids from algal biomass (containing rigid cell walls) and convert them to biodiesel in a shorter reaction time. Real time analysis plot for direct conversion of dry algal biomass to biodiesel is illustrated in Fig. 2. The power method used for the microwave transesterification process is described in Table 1.

Microwave-enhanced transesterification
The microwave effect on the transesterification reaction is twofold: (1) enhancement of reaction by a thermal effect, and (2) evaporation of methanol due to the strong microwave interaction of the material.30,31 The microwave interaction with the reaction compounds (triglycerides and methanol) results in a large reduction of activation energy due to an increased dipolar polarization phenomenon. This is achieved due to molecular-level interactions of the microwaves in the reaction mixture resulting in dipolar rotation and ionic conduction.32 The reduction in activation energy is essentially dependent on the medium and reaction mechanism.33 Methanol is a strong microwave absorption material and, in general, the presence of an OH group attached to a large molecule behaves as though it were anchored to an immobile raft, and the more localized rotations dominate the microwave spectrum and result in localized superheating, which assists the reaction to complete faster.34 The microwave-enhanced transesterification reaction of algal biomass to yield methyl ester is illustrated in Fig. 3. The base-catalyzed microwave transesterification mechanism is described elsewhere.21

Experimental design
A response surface methodology (RSM)35 was used to analyze the influence of the four process variables, namely, the dry algae to methanol (wt/vol) ratio, the power dissipation, the reaction time and catalyst concentration on the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) content. The primary interest was to observe the controlled power factor influence on the yield of biodiesel so the study was performed in two phases: the first phase was to analyze the boundary regions and to interpret the results, and the second phase was to include the center point of the factors and analyze the factor effect to a greater extent. A full quadratic model was tested for its significance. The detailed statistical analysis of experimental design is presented elsewhere.10 The analysis of variance was conducted without the square terms and insignificant interaction terms and the analysis were done down to the factor level with one degree of freedom to explain the variability. Fifty sets of experiments were performed in a completely randomized fashion (Table 2). The inferences based on the P-value of our data indicate that all the factors are significant. The P-value close to zero indicates that power played a significant role in the yield of algal biodiesel. Any change brought about to the power will significantly affect the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME).

The regression model provided an accurate description of the experimental data indicating a successful correlation between the transesterification process parameters that affect the yield of algal biodiesel. This was further supported by the value of the correlation coefficient, R2 (0.8325). Method of least squares was employed to ascertain the values of the model parameters and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to establish their statistical significance at a confidence level of 95% (in our case). The estimated regression coefficients for response and analysis of variance for the response are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Analytical methods
For the quantification of reaction product, the algal biodiesel samples were analyzed by a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) system incorporated with an Agilent 5975 C MSD (Triple-Axis Detector) and an Agilent 7890 A GC equipped with a capillary column (DB-23, 60 m × 250 μm × 0.15 μm nominal). FAME yield (g FAME extract/g dried algae) measured the actual amount of biodiesel detected by GC-MS per unit mass of dried microalgae. The external standard calibration method was implemented for the final product quantification. Approximately, 1 μL sample was injected into the GC. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The injection was performed in split mode (20:1). The parameters of the oven temperature program consist of: start at 50 °C with 10 °C min−1 intervals up to 220 °C (1 min) and up to 250 °C with 5 °C min−1 intervals (2 min). The temperatures of the injector and detector were set at 245 °C and 250 °C, respectively.
The infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 400 FT-IR/FT-NIR spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of wet algae, algal biodiesel (FAME) and algal lipid was performed using Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA. The samples were heated from 25 to 1000 °C at constant heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in an atmosphere of nitrogen at a constant purge rate of 20 mL min−1 at the pan. Algal lipid localization was imaged with a model SP5 II laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wurzburg, Germany) using the 488 nm line from an argon laser for excitation and two channels of emission, (500–550 nm for non-specific autofluorescence and 670–690 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence) and a 63× oil immersion lens.
Results and discussion
Influence of process parameters and optimization

Fig. 4 shows the response contours of FAME yield against power and other three process variables at algae to methanol ratio of 1:12, catalyst concentration of 2% and reaction time of 7 min. Three contours were demonstrated to include the variation of response for each of the factors with the remaining factors. The holding values of all the factors are the corresponding center levels. Lower ratios of algal biomass to methanol (1:9 wt/vol) are ineffective to shift the equilibrium transesterification reaction to the product side to get maximum conversion. Higher ratio of biomass to methanol could shift the reversible reaction forward (as observed) perhaps due to increased contact area between methanol and oil/lipid, resulting in higher yield of FAME. Methanol is a good microwave radiation absorption solvent (loss factor, tan δ = 0.659) that dominate the microwave spectrum and result in localized superheating, which assists the reaction to complete faster.32 However, higher dry algae to methanol ratios did not show any significant influence on extraction- transesterification reaction yield with an increased power dissipation factor because much of the microwave irradiation will be absorbed by the solvent, lessening the effect on the dry algae which could result in inefficient extraction of algal oils. Furthermore, it was noticed from statistical analysis that no interaction between the power and methanol at 95% confidence level was observed. A positive coefficient in power, dry algae to methanol, reaction time and catalyst concentration indicates that all the factors influence the yield in direct proportion within the experimental region of interest (Fig. 4).

A lower concentration of the KOH catalyst (1%) with the influence of low power dissipation (700 W) may not efficiently advance the reaction as the catalyst effect was hindered by the presence of a variety of organic compounds (lipids, olefins, fatty alcohols, phytols, sterols, pigments) resulting from algal biomass extraction. The homogeneous, solvent-catalyst methoxides prepared with potassium hydroxide (KOH) are more susceptible to higher microwave irradiation power and yield high biodiesel conversion rates.36 It has been observed that the active sites of the catalyst in liquid solvent heated continuously by microwaves resulting in higher local temperature and increased reaction rate with the increasing microwave power, which contributed to a higher FAME conversion rate. However, higher concentrations of catalyst above 2.5% (wt) did not show any considerable effect on the biodiesel conversion with an increase in power dissipation. This may be due to the corrosive nature of basic catalyst (KOH) and its tendency to form soap which hinders the transesterification reaction.37,38 The reaction time has a significant effect on algal biodiesel yield. Lower reaction times do not provide sufficient interaction of the reactant mixture as the microwave effect is two-fold in the extraction and transesterification reaction. Thermal effect caused by the microwaves increases the extractive properties of methanol to remove the oils from the algal biomass in suspension (diffusive extraction) and extended microwave effect causes penetration through the cell walls and forces out the oils into the solvent mixture (disruptive extraction). The reaction time around 8–10 min seems to be adequate for the complete extraction and transesterification reaction under microwave irradiation. The advantage of microwave-assisted reactions clearly is reflected in short reaction times. Microwave irradiation is more effective in the destruction of the cells and accelerates the transesterification reaction in a shorter reaction time. Thus reduced processing time minimizes unwanted side reactions, which are potentially dangerous. Based on the experimental analysis and RSM study, the optimal conditions for this process are reported as: dry algae–methanol (wt/vol) ratio of around 1:13, KOH concentration around 2.5% (wt) and the reaction time of 8–10 min at a power dissipation of 1400 W. The algal direct conversion microwave process was optimized for improved reaction conditions and it has been found to be cleaner, leading to fewer by-products and wastes as compared to the conventionally extracted and esterified processes.12 The non-catalytic microwave transesterification process is being developed for algal biomass using green solvent with low energy consumption approach to make this process even ‘greener’ and safer in the future.
Influence of power dissipation and microwave energy efficieny
The influence of power dissipation in correlation with microwave energy efficiency on FAME yield is presented in Table 5. It has been reported that high power enhances localized rapid superheating within the algal biomass system which assists in cellular wall degradation and enhanced mass transfer rates to produce good quality extract with better target compound recovery.39

Different power dissipation levels (200, 400, 700, 1000, 1400 W) were tested and respective algal biodiesel yields and microwave energy efficiencies (% η) were calculated. It was observed that the process yields a lower algal biodiesel conversion of 6.75% at a minimum power dissipation (200 W) level. The yield increases at a faster rate with the increased power dissipation factor and attained a maximum yield of 40.03% at 1400 W. The quick reorientation of the dipole moment of methanol took place at elevated microwave power, which destroys the two-tier structure of the interface of methanol and lipid extracted from the dry algae. As a result, the dielectric constant and polarity of the methanol are reduced allowing it to solvate lipids to form a single phase and produce a higher algal biodiesel yield. The heat energy supplied and thermal energy associated with 200 W power dissipation are 120 kJ and 10.29 kJ respectively while for 1400 W, the energy requirements are 840 kJ and 101.47 kJ respectively for the test volume and reaction duration used for algal FAME. A study of the catalytic conversion of Camelina sativa oil to biodiesel through both conventional heating and microwave radiation that the microwave-heating method consumed less than 10% of the energy to achieve the same higher yield as the conventional heating method.40 Microwave-enhanced transesterification reactions with maximum power dissipation for longer reaction time should be avoided for algal biomass ester conversion. In this subcritical methanol condition, the FAME yield can be hampered due to the autoxidation of the reactive intermediates (organic substrates) and unsaturated fatty acids in algal biomass leads to the formation of hydroperoxides which are thermally unstable.41 The initiation of the degradation of FAME is also possible due to the isomerization of the double bond functional group from cis-type carbon bonding (CC) into trans-type carbon bonding (CC) owing to the high content of unsaturated fatty acids only, if the reaction is carried out at the supercritical methanol (SCM) condition.10,42
The energy efficiency of a microwave-assisted transesterification reaction of algal biomass is represented as eqn (1) which represents the heat energy supplied by the microwaves which is given in terms of the power dissipation and the time of exposure. Eqn (2) quantifies the thermal effect caused by the microwave radiation in the sample volume. Energy efficiency of the microwave energy is the ratio of the observed resultant temperature effect to the total energy supplied to the sample as in eqn (3).43 Qmw = Pmwt(1) Qth = mcpΔt = (macpa + mmcpm + mccpc)Δt(2) η = Qth/Qmw(3)where, ma, mm and mc represent the mass of algae sample, methanol and catalyst, respectively, used in the reaction system (in grams); cpa, cpm and cpc represent the specific heat associated with algae sample, methanol and catalyst, respectively (kJ g−1); Δt is the temperature difference observed for the reaction. The energy efficiency was also calculated for lower power dissipation with various amounts of sample volume and reaction time used for algal biodiesel. The microwave energy efficiency was calculated for two different case studies, 1400 W for 4 min and 700 W for 4 min, as 19.88% and 16.54%, respectively. From Table 5 and case results, high efficiency can be observed when high power microwave energy is used for a large amount of sample volume processed in the same batch of a reaction system for a shorter reaction time, or low power microwave energy is used for shorter reaction time. Low efficiencies can be observed when a high-power microwave device is used for a very small sample volume for a longer reaction time. These results suggest that proper application of power dissipation control will result in effective use of microwave energy to achieve higher FAME yields and to minimize energy losses to the surroundings. The chemical safety for extractive transesterification of algal biomass can be possible using green microwave instruments.44
Lipid localization in microalgae
Approximately, 100 μL of thawed algal cell paste from a frozen aliquot was suspended in 2.5% glutaraldehyde–0.1 M imidazole HCl buffered solution at pH 7.2 and rapidly mixed. Small aliquots (2–5 μL) of the settled algal cells were deposited in multiwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope using the 488 nm line from an argon laser for excitation and two channels of emission (500–550 nm for non-specific autofluorescence and 670–690 nm for chlorophyll autofluorescence) and a 63× oil immersion lens. Spectra of autofluorescence from 500–750 nm was (Fig. 5a and 5b) measured before and after the addition of 100 μg mL−1 Nile Red to an aliquot of the algal cell suspension and images with three emission channels were obtained, 500–550 nm, 580–620 nm (Nile Red fluorescence) and 670–690 nm. Non-specific (green) fluorescence probably from Schiff bases resulting from partial cross-linking with the glutaraldehyde fixative solution to cellular proteins defines the microscopic details of the roughly spherical algal cells, whereas the red fluorescence probably outlines the profile of chloroplast structures containing chlorophyll in the cells (Fig. 5c). The addition of Nile Red to the algal suspension (Fig. 5d) highlights large areas of yellow fluorescence in many cells that are often superimposed on green fluorescent areas. Although in some cells discrete yellow-fluorescent areas are well defined with little or no spectral component from green fluorescence; these areas probably represent lipid droplets based on the known lipophilic staining of Nile Red.45

Analysis of algal biodiesel
The composition of triglyceride fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) found in N. salina detected by GC-MS analysis was identified as: C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3 and C20:5n3 (Fig. 6A). The percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were calculated to 47.30% and 12.49%, respectively. In a major research concern, high percentage of EPA, i.e. C20:5n3 is not acceptable in algal methyl ester in terms of fuel properties (e.g. oxidative stability, ignition quality, cold temperature properties, pollutant formation). The extent of unsaturation of algal biodiesel which makes it susceptible to oxidation during storage can be reduced easily by partial catalytic hydrogenation of the oil.46 From GC-MS and TIC data; it was observed that algal biodiesel also contains olefins, fatty alcohols and sterols in minor quantity. The algal lipid profile of direct conversion of dry algae detected by FT-ICR MS analysis also indicates the presence of dicarboxylic acids, hydroxyl fatty acids, oxo fatty acids, epoxy fatty acids, wax monoesters, steroids, isoprenoids, betaine DGCC, cholesterol and mono-, di- and tri-radylglycerols.
 Fig. 6  (A) GC-MS analysis of algal biodiesel; (B) FTIR analysis of FAME converted algal biomass; (C) overlay of thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis of wet algae, crude lipid and crude algal biodiesel. 
The possible structures (interpretation of results) obtained from FTIR spectrum search are the alkyl group (general and long chain substituent), a carboxylic acid ester (possibly aliphatic), long chain aliphatic esters (possibly unsaturated) and carbonyl compounds (Fig. 6B). The observation of an absorption peak around 1200 cm−1 may be assigned to the antisymmetric axial stretching vibrations of CC(O)–O bonds of the ester, while peaks around 1183 cm−1 may be assigned to asymmetric axial stretching vibrations of O–C–C bonds. Since biodiesel is mainly mono-alkyl ester, the intense CO stretching band of methyl ester appears at 1743 cm−1 for algal biodiesel. The percent loss of water (physical change) at onset temperature of 146 °C in the wet algae sample was reported as 60.35% (i.e., solid concentration of wet algae paste was 39.65%). It was observed from the plot (Fig. 6C) that slow degradation of wet algal biomass started at 260 °C. This result attributed to vaporization of organic matter and initiation of thermal degradation of sample at a high temperature owing to the high content of unsaturated fatty acids in the algal biomass.47 The mass of the algal biodiesel starts to decrease at approximately after 145 °C, this being attributed to the volatilization point of algal biodiesel. The mass continues to decrease until all the biodiesel present in the sample is vaporized. Similarly, evaporation of crude algal oil/lipid starts at approx. 265 °C. In addition, the mass loss recorded for the biodiesel at 145 °C correlates to the mass percentage of the biodiesel present in the sample. Because these temperatures vary by a relatively large value (∼120 °C); this method should be quite effective in distinguishing biodiesel from algal oil.
Conclusions
A single-step microwave-enhanced irradiation process for simultaneous extraction and transesterification (in situ) of dry algal biomass to biodiesel has been demonstrated. Process optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) design proved to be a valuable tool for evaluating the effects of the process variables such as dry algae to methanol (wt/vol) ratio, catalyst concentration and reaction time at controlled power dissipation on the FAMEs yield. The application of proper power dissipation control has positive influence on the yield of reaction product and could result in greater benefits in terms of energy efficiency. In addition, appropriate power dissipation may offer the benefits of shorter reaction duration, thus reducing the energy consumption of the process. The direct conversion (single-step) process has the potential to provide an energy-efficient and economical route for algal biodiesel production.
