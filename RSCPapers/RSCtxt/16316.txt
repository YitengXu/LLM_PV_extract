    , Accepted 21st September 2015First published on 21st September 2015AbstractBrookite-TiO2 is a promising next-generation semiconductor material for solar energy conversion, but it suffers from difficulty in achieving high quality and phase purity due to its metastable characteristics. Long-chain fatty acid modification or surfactant assisted methods could orient the growth of brookite; however, purifying the products is complicated and the surface reactivity is invariably undermined. Herein, we demonstrate the design and tuneable synthesis of brookite nanostructures with geometric features of quasi-octahedral (QO), ellipsoid-tipped (ET) and wedge-tipped (WT) nanorods that are exposed primarily with {210} facet via water-soluble titanium precursors. When tested as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water or for the degradation of organic pollutants, QO brookite nanocrystals exhibited the highest catalytic activity compared to ET and WT nanorod counterparts. This observation could be due to the redox facets that form a “surface-heterojunction” and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers. The precursor-directed method reported here may usher in a new phase for the synthesis of novel metastable nanocrystals with specific facet exposure that are highly useful for applications in energy conversion and environment protection.
1. Introduction
Polymorphs of TiO2 with compositions that are abundant in the earth's crust have shown great impact on a wide range of scientific investigations and technological applications because of its chemical activity, it being environmentally benign and having a low cost.1,2 The three most common polymorphs, namely, rutile, anatase and brookite, are built by the same fundamental TiO6 polyhedral units, while the phase formation differs only due to the nature of the connection (sharing corners or edges). Brookite, previously considered as the least studied TiO2 phase,3 has recently attracted increasing interest in pure phase preparation and applications in environmental and energy fields.4–7
Brookite is also a representative metastable phase. Its TiO6 polyhedral units in an orthorhombic structure (space group: Pbca) share three edges and corners of an octahedron, and are arranged parallel to the c-axis, forming chains by edge sharing and then cross-linking via the shared edges. These features totally differ from those of the tetragonal structures of rutile and anatase, which are organized in terms of shared faces.8,9 In addition, the arrangement of distorted TiO6 octahedra is similar for all these polymorphs, which makes it difficult to obtain brookite in a pure phase, and as a result one would usually observe brookite as a by-product of anatase or rutile.10,11 High-quality metastable brookite crystals have to be obtained just by deliberate control at the atomic scale of the TiO6 octahedral configurations. Although a multitude of efforts have been devoted in this regard, it is still a challenge to simultaneously control the structure and quality of brookite. For instance, brookite nanorods12 and nanotubes13 have been prepared from an inorganic sodium titanate NaxH2−xTi3O7·nH2O precursor. Moreover, it has been considered that Na+ ions and a basic environment are essential for the formation of pure brookite under hydrothermal conditions.14,15
Several cations can initially serve as the stabilizers for the layered structure of lepidocrocite titanate, an intermediate that could transform to the single crystalline brookite.16 However, using these methods, one cannot achieve good crystalline well-faceted brookite nanocrystals, or brookite nanocrystals with specific facets exposed, which is essential for property tailoring.
The precursor-directed approach based on inorganic–organic hybrid compounds has been deemed as an effective way to achieve various functional inorganic nanomaterials with unique composition, morphology and size.17–19 Concerning the synthesis of brookite TiO2, water-soluble titanium complexes have been proved to be promising for constructing high quality nanoparticles.20,21 Ellipsoid-like brookite with high crystallinity has been prepared through an intermediate with oxalate anion ligands in the form of Ti2O3(H2O)2(C2O4)·H2O.5 Other shapes like nanorods and nanosheets have also been prepared by forming an organic–inorganic titanium compound with glycolic acid, namely, (NH4)6[Ti4(C2H2O3)4(C2H3O3)2(O2)4O2]·4H2O, in a monoclinic structure (space group: P21/n).20,22 An oleate-modified hydrothermal growth process can further change the shape of brookite nanocrystals from the rod-like morphology to a pseudo-cubic shape, which mainly exposes four {210} and two {001} faces.23 Recently, our group developed a novel in situ-generated precursor, [Ti(C3H4O3)3]2− or Na2Ti(C3H4O3)3, that yielded high-quality brookite TiO2 nanosheets and nanorods surrounded by four {210}, two {101} and {201} facets through a low-basicity hydrothermal process.6,24 Such a precursor method does not follow the previously claimed rules. For the latter case, crystalline brookite should be obtained in the presence of lots of Cl−.25 Kandiel et al.26 used a commercially available water-soluble titanium bis(ammonium lactate) dihydroxide (TALH) as a precursor and synthesized high quality brookite nanorods with the exposure of {210} and {111} facets. This is also the only example where the intensity of the (211) diffraction, which is located at the two theta value of 30.81°, is higher than that of the (210) peak, which is located at 25.3°, in the ever reported brookite TiO2. Hierarchical metastable brookite microspheres have been reported using the hydrothermal treatment of a water-soluble titanium–picolinato complex in an alkaline solution (pH = 10).27 A surfactant-assisted nonaqueous strategy relying on high-temperature aminolysis of titanium carboxylate complexes has been developed to produce anisotropically shaped TiO2 nanocrystals growing along the [001] direction.28 However, this synthetic strategy involves extremely complicated procedures or capping complexes that invariably undermine the surface reactivity; thus, water-soluble complexes of titanium are believed to be the most encouraging reagents for the preparation of metastable single phase brookite TiO2.
Based on these previous studies, the main purpose of this study is to broaden the range of synthetic conditions to obtain different shapes of brookite by controlling the terminal faces of the single crystal brookite TiO2. Herein, we report on the selective synthesis of quasi-octahedral nanocrystals and ellipsoid-tipped and wedge-tipped brookite TiO2 nanorods with available and low toxicity ligands by tuning the hydrothermal treatment procedures. Furthermore, the as-obtained brookite quasi-octahedral nanocrystals with exposure of reductive facets could orient the deposition of noble metals, leading to excellent photocatalytic properties toward hydrogen generation from water and organic pollutant degradation. Atomic configuration of the exposed facets and the mechanism of the transfer of photoexcited holes and electrons are also proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample synthesis
All the chemicals were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Corp, P. R. China, and used without further purification.

2.2.1 Brookite ellipsoid-tipped (ET) nanorods. 
In a conventional operation, under agitating conditions, 0.015 mol TiOSO4·2H2O was added to 60 mL of deionized water in a Teflon autoclave to obtain a white suspension. Subsequently, 0.25 mol urea and 0.032 mol sodium glycolate were solubilized to generate a yellowish solution. The autoclave was then sealed and placed in an oven at 200 °C for 24 h to obtain precipitates. The resultant white precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethanol and dried at 80 °C to obtain ET nanorods.


2.2.2 Brookite wedge-tipped (WT) nanorods. 
Typically, a strong acidic titanium-containing solution with a concentration of 0.25 M was prepared beforehand by slowly dropping TiCl4 into ice-cooled deionized water. Subsequently, 0.25 mol urea and 5.0 mL sodium lactate solution (60%) were added into 60 mL of the abovementioned acidic solution with agitation. Finally, the solution was reacted hydrothermally at 200 °C for 12 h. After reaction, the product was washed and dried at 80 °C.


2.2.3 Brookite quasi-octahedral nanocrystals. 
The fabrication of quasi-octahedral nanocrystals was carried out according to the processes employed for synthesizing WT nanorods but with a notably declined supply (0.083 mol) of the in situ alkaline source, i.e. urea, to slow down the formation of monomers derived from the decomposition of water-soluble titanium-involved complexes.

2.2 Sample characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected by a Rigaku MiniFlex II diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) at 30 kV and 15 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies were carried out using a Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope. Raman vibrations of the samples were observed on a Renishaw, UV-vis Raman System 1000 with an excitation light source of 532 nm. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were recorded with a Varian Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were tested using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. Chemical compositions and valence-band spectra of the samples were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCA-LAB MKII apparatus equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source.
2.3 Photocatalytic activity measurements

2.3.1 Methyl orange (MO) degradation. 
The photocatalytic degradation of MO was measured under UV-light illumination (780 ≥ λ ≥ 340 nm). A 300 W Xe lamp with a 340 nm cut-off filter was employed to ensure the desired illumination, and 100 mL of MO solution (10 mg L−1) containing 0.1 g of catalyst was used for the reaction. Before irradiation, MO suspensions with varying catalysts were stirred for 5 h to reach the adsorption and desorption equilibrium. At a regular time interval, the illuminated suspension was extracted and centrifuged at a rate of 9000 rpm to achieve a solid/liquid separation, and the relative content of MO in the supernatant was determined from UV-vis absorption spectra, which was recorded by a Perkin-Elmer UV lambda 35 spectrophotometer.


2.3.2 Hydrogen evolution. 
The photocatalytic reaction for hydrogen generation from water was carried out in a 100 mL Pyrex flask with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a cut-off filter (780 ≥ λ ≥ 340 nm) as the light source. The reaction temperature was kept at 5 °C. Typically, 50 mg TiO2 was dispersed into a flask containing 80 mL aqueous solution of 25 vol% methanol. An H2PtCl6 solution that acts as co-catalyst was added to the suspension to ensure a Pt loading of 5 wt% on the catalyst. Before light irradiation, the reactor was sealed, and the residual air was evacuated by a vacuum pump. The experimental duration was set as 4 hours, and the produced gas was detected every 1 hour using a gas chromatograph (Fuli 9790II, Zhejiang, China) with a TCD.

2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photocurrent detection was performed on a conventional electrochemical cell with a working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Prior to the test, indium-tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass was ultrasonically cleaned by deionized water, acetone and ethanol for 10 min. 20 mg of TiO2 was first dispersed into 0.2 mL of dimethylformamide under sonication for 1 h to obtain a slurry, which was then spread onto the ITO glass surface to obtain a film area of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. Subsequently, the naked part of the ITO glass was coated by epoxy resin. The electrolyte was 0.2 M NaSO4 solution, and the required irradiation was obtained employing a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a 365 ± 15 nm band pass filter.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal phase, microstructure, and formation mechanism of brookite with different shapes
A possible formation process of brookite TiO2 is schematically proposed in Scheme 1. The structure (e) in Scheme 1 is a supposed intermediate, which is vividly shown as the chain-like distorted TiO6 octahedral building units that share corners and edges in bulk brookite. The water-soluble precursors in this process actually involve two complexes: one is the [Ti(OH)2(H2O)4]2+ octahedron,24 which is formed when TiCl4 is added into water, as shown in Scheme 1b. With the introduction of sodium lactate, taking the WT nanorods for example, the other precursor is the titanium-containing complex [Ti(C3H4O3)3]2− (Scheme 1c), which is generated via an analogous ligand exchange reaction. The formation reactions of these brookite precursors have been represented by the reaction eqn (1)–(4) in the ESI.† Under hydrothermal conditions and weakly basic environment, [Ti(C3H4O3)3]2− may lose a peroxo group (same as the compound of titanium and glycolic acid20) to yield a dimer and then a tetramer by a bridging oxo group, which might further grow to produce stripes of Ti4nO14n+4 and finally crystallize to brookite TiO2 (Scheme 1f).

Following such a process, three morphologies of single phase brookite with high quality were prepared. Table 1 shows the summary of physicochemical properties of the synthesized well-faceted brookite, including quasi-octahedral (QO) nanocrystals and ellipsoid-tipped (ET) and wedge-tipped (WT) nanorods. The pure phase of the as-obtained brookite TiO2 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. S1†). The diffraction peaks of each sample match well with those of standard diffraction data of brookite (JCPDS no. 76-1934). The intensity ratios of the {211} diffraction at two theta of 30.83° to {210} diffraction at 25.36° (I(211)brookite/I(210)brookite), which was previously used to identify the phase purity of brookite, are larger than the standard diffraction data of brookite (about 0.9, as listed in Table 1), which demonstrates that the as-synthesized TiO2 is highly crystalline and phase pure. The Raman spectroscopy, a phase-sensitive technique described in Fig. S2,† further confirms the purity of brookite phase. The locations of the vibration bands are similar for all the three as-prepared brookite samples with those reported elsewhere.26

TEM and HRTEM images of the well-crystallized brookite exposed with different facets are displayed in Fig. 1 and S3.†Fig. 1A presents the TEM image of the as-obtained QO TiO2. The close-up view indicates that the average particle width and length for QO were around 45 and 60 nm, respectively (Fig. 1B). FFT analysis in Fig. 1C further reveals that the QO particles are dominantly exposed with (210) and (101) facets. Similarly, the average dimensions of brookite ET and WT nanorods were bigger in length and smaller in width than QO, respectively, as displayed in Fig. 1C and D and S3(B and D).† More details can be clearly seen from the particle size (width and length) distributions presented in Fig. 1F–H. From the abovementioned observations, it can be inferred that all these brookite particles are enclosed by four equivalent {210} facets [(210), (0), (10) and (20)] at the centre part. In addition, the strong diffraction spots in Fig. S3A and F† demonstrate that QO TiO2 and WT nanorods are single crystals. The co-existence of diffraction rings and spots in ET nanorods indicates a complex of single crystals and polycrystals (Fig. S3C†). The presence of dominantly exposed {210} planes could be due to the fact that these facets are the most stable faces, and that during the synthesis, the solution or ligand molecules were adsorbed onto the surface active sites (Ti4+ or noncovalent bonding oxygen atoms) in these planes and may thus direct the growth of brookite crystals.20,23,28,29 Two ends of ET nanorods are dominated by a curved surface with no specific planes exposed (Fig. 1C and S3C†). Interestingly, both ends of the QO nanocrystals and WT nanorods are surrounded by {201} and {101} crystal faces (see the schematic diagrams in Fig. 1), and the lattice fringes of the nanorods terminate sharply at two {101} edges and two {201} borders in the [1] zone axis and [13] crystalline axis, respectively (Fig. S3E and F†). Furthermore, the percentages of the {101} and {201} crystal faces of QO nanocrystals were both optimized at 15%, which is considerably larger than those of the WT nanorods.

The evolution of the phase structure of the obtained products was monitored by XRD based on a batch of time-regulated experiments, as indicated in Fig. 2. The initial solution was highly acidic at a pH value of around 1–2, which was gradually increased to 7–8 due to the decomposition of urea. The reaction lasted for about 1 h. Anatase TiO2 with a considerably small size (ca. 4 nm as estimated from Scherrer formula) was produced, as evidenced by the distinct peak broadening (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, orthorhombic brookite TiO2 (JCPDS no. 76-1934) of about 24 nm appeared when the reaction proceeded for 2 h (pH = 8–9). This was identified by the newly appeared characteristic diffraction located at 2θ = 30.8° in Fig. 2b, which does not overlap with the peaks of anatase or rutile components, as reported elsewhere.15,26 On prolonging the preparation time to 5 h (pH = 8–9), the XRD signal changed obviously, and the pattern was almost like that of a neat brookite (ca. 32 nm) with the elimination of the broadened peaks of anatase (Fig. 2a). When the hydrothermal reactions were further sustained for 12 h (pH = 8–9), as indicated in Fig. 2d, the purity of brookite was continuously enhanced, and a single-phase brookite lattice was obtained. In addition, it has been proved that anatase prefers to exist in a highly acidic environment (pH < 3), and the structural similarity and high pH (≥8) trigger the phase transformation from anatase to brookite.15,26,28

It is well documented that the morphologies of semiconductors affect the light absorbance and band-gap energies.24 The UV-vis absorption spectra of diversely shaped brookite crystals are exhibited in Fig. 3. The optical absorption edges were determined to be 378 nm for ET nanorods, 374 nm for WT nanorods, 376 nm for QO nanocrystals and 405 nm for Degussa P25. The band gap (Eg) of these nanocrystals can be fixed according to the following relational expression: A = K(hν − Eg)n/hν, where A is the absorbance, K is a constant, and n can equal 1/2 or 2, depending on the direct transition or indirect transition.30 Brookite TiO2 is widely acknowledged as an indirect semiconductor, i.e. n = 28. The optical band gap energy of these TiO2 samples was calculated to be 3.24 eV for ET nanorods, 3.28 eV for WT nanorods, and 3.27 eV for QO nanocrystals; all these values are larger than that previously reported for brookite nanosheets (3.1 eV).24 However, ET nanorods showed a different absorbance between 380 and 420 nm, which could be due to the presence of some defects generated from the adsorption of SO42− onto the nanorod surfaces under the hydrothermal conditions. This is because SO42− species have a higher affinity for Ti4+ in an aqueous solution relative to many other anions (such as Cl−, NO3−,ClO3−, ClO4−, or –OOH),8 which also resulted in the absence of special crystal facets exposed at the tips of the ellipsoid nanorods and a complex of single crystals and polycrystals (Fig. S3F†).

3.2 Photocatalytic performances of brookite with different shapes
The shape-dependent physicochemical properties arising from the different surface energies of nanomaterials have generated more and more interest in their possible applications. The exposure of distinct redox facets can facilitate charge carrier transport to different facets, thereby reducing the charge recombination rate.31 The chemical nature of these facets was studied through the oriented deposition of other species. Herein, we performed photo-deposition experiments to identify the redox sites on the facets of brookite QO nanocrystals. It was found that, under UV-light illumination, PbO2 grains were deposited onto brookite {201} facets (Fig. S4 and S5†), which was somewhat like the photocatalytic oxidation deposition of ZnO2 onto brookite,6 while Pt nanoparticles (2–3 nm) were mainly loaded onto the {210} and {101} planes. Therefore, we inferred that the {201} facets mainly act as the oxidative surfaces, while {210} and {101} facets function as the reductive sites. The presence of redox facets in brookite nanocrystals is beneficial for the spatial separation of photo-generated electrons and holes between different facets, thus providing the possibility of improving photocatalytic performances.
To confirm this assumption, transient photocurrent responses were examined for these brookite particles. As illustrated in Fig. S6,† electrodes made of brookite TiO2 with redox facets (QO and WT nanorods) or heterojunctions (Degussa P25) exhibited efficient separation of the photogenerated carriers, except for ET nanorods. The quick photocurrent response was beneficial for the synergy of redox facets or heterostructures, which facilitated the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. ET brookite TiO2 nanorods, however, exhibited a negligible photocurrent; this could be due to the presence of defects (Fig. 3) that were induced by the surface adsorbed SO42− species in the hydrothermal process, which causes the recombination of the photoexcited carriers.
Generally, catalysts with a lower recombination rate of photo-induced charge carriers will be more reactive. Based on the photocurrent tests (Fig. S6†), separation capabilities of photogenerated electrons and holes for brookite with different shapes were found to follow such a sequence: WT nanorods > QO nanocrystals > ET nanorods. It is well known that photocatalytic reactions are typical of surface-based processes, and thus surface area could be a pivotal factor in determining the apparent performance. For the purpose of more accurate evaluation, reactivity comparisons were carried out after normalization of BET specific surface areas (Table 1 and Fig. S7†). The photocatalytic generation of hydrogen was employed to evaluate the photoreduction activities of these faceted brookite crystals. As shown in Fig. 4, brookite QO nanocrystals exhibited the highest rate for hydrogen production (∼1000 μmol m−2 h−1 g−1), which is about 7 times or 2.5 times higher than that of ET nanorods and WT nanorods, respectively. Furthermore, photocatalytic performances for creating hydrogen over brookite QO nanocrystals were considerably better than that of Degussa P25, in spite of its relatively weak power in separating the photoexcited carriers. Thus, we could come to the conclusion that the photoreactivity of hydrogen evolution for brookite nanocrystals complies with the order of QO nanocrystals > WT nanorods > ET nanorods. In addition, the same activity order was observed for these nanocrystals in the photodegradation of MO organic dyes (Fig. 5). Obviously, the tardy photoactivity displayed in ET nanorods was ascribed to the defects caused by the surface adsorbed SO42− during preparation, and thus the separation of photogenerated carriers and decomposition of MO was retarded, which is consistent with the lowest photoactivities in water splitting (Fig. 4). The complete breakdown of MO requires 90 min for WT nanorods and 60 min for brookite QO nanocrystals. The apparent pseudo-first-order rate was determined according to ln(Co/C) = kt. The obtained k values are listed in Table 1, which reveals a positive correlation with photoreactivities. Therefore, the abovementioned experimental outcomes manifest that the photocatalytic performance of brookite TiO2 is highly surface-facet dependent, and can be remarkably heightened through the augmentation of the reactive facets {101} and {201}.

3.3 Crystal effects and photocatalytic mechanism of brookite with different shapes
The observation of the unique chemical nature of these facets is surprising. To interpret this phenomenon, electronic band structures of brookite nanocrystals with different shapes were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectra. Although the QO nanocrystals possess nearly the same bandgap as WT nanorods (Fig. 3), the valence band maximum (VBmax) of the QO nanocrystals shifted upwards by 0.18 eV, relative to the WT nanorods (Fig. S8†). Consequently, the conduction band minimum (CBmin) of QO nanocrystals was increased. On the other hand, no traces of Ti3+ or Ti2+ were detected in these samples (Fig. S9†). By comparison, it was inferred that the difference in CBmin and VBmax of brookite originated from the percentage of oxidative facet {201} and reductive surfaces {210} and {101}. As a result, both CBmin and VBmax of {201} planes could be higher than those of {210} and {101} facets. Such differences in energy levels can drive holes to move forward to the {201} facets, whereas drive the electrons to move to other planes, which is in accordance with the observations reported in other systems;32–34 this accounts for the unique chemical nature of these facets. The transformation mechanism of electrons and holes at different planes is proposed and displayed in Fig. 6.

In photocatalysis reactions, such as the inactivation of E. coli35 and the degradation of organic pollutants,36 ˙O2− and ˙OH are well-known active species, which are generated when photogenerated electrons are efficiently transferred. Considering the band-gap energy (Fig. 3) and the redox potential of the valence band (VB, Fig. S8†) in brookite, ˙O2− production is thermodynamically favored by directly reducing O2 into ˙O2− [E0(O2/˙O2−) = −0.33 eV vs. NHE] by the CB (more negative than −1.0 eV vs. NHE) of brookite. Alternatively, ˙OH generation is thermodynamically forbidden because its valence band (less than +2.18 eV vs. NHE) cannot directly oxidize H2O/OH− [E0(OH/˙OH) = 2.38 eV vs. NHE].35 However, ˙OH could be generated from the reductive site in brookite by reducing the adsorbed oxygen to generate ˙O2−. Subsequently, there occurs a facile disproportionation that produces ˙OH by a two-electron oxygen reduction route (˙O2− + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2 →2˙OH),36,37 as clearly demonstrated in Fig. 6.
Herein, ˙OH radicals produced by the catalyst under UV-light irradiation were monitored using terephthalic acid as a trapping agent. Because most photoexcited carriers will recombine again, only a small part of the photogenerated electrons can efficiently separate and be transferred to the surface of brookite TiO2, which then take part in the photo-reductive reactions. Photogenerated electrons were studied indirectly by detecting the production of ˙OH radicals, as depicted in Fig. 7 and S10.† No signals for ˙OH radicals were found in the absence of catalyst, and negligible ˙OH radicals were produced in ET nanorods after 9 min UV-light illumination. Comparatively, greatly enhanced ˙OH radical signals appeared as WT nanorods and QO nanocrystals were introduced. More importantly, the sequence of the intensities of ˙OH radicals is in good agreement with the amount of H2 production (Fig. 4) and MO degradation (Fig. 5). These observations further demonstrate that brookite nanocrystals with distinct redox facets could facilitate the separation of charge carriers that participate in photoreactions, thus greatly promoting the photocatalytic activity.

The atomic structures of the exposed facets of brookite may have impact on catalytic performances. The facet models for brookite are illustrated in Fig. 8. There are coordinatively unsaturated (cus) five-fold Ti (Ti5c) and two-fold O (O2c), as well as saturated six-fold Ti (Ti6c) and three-fold O (O3c) atoms in the {210} surface (Fig. 8a). For the {101} plane (Fig. 8b), cus Ti4c, Ti5c, and O2c atoms, along with coordinatively saturated Ti6c and O3c atoms, were clearly revealed. It appears to be rather striking that an infrequent high-index {201} facet exposed with cus Ti4c, Ti5c, O2c, together with saturated Ti6c and O3c atoms, was cleaved from the brookite lattice (Fig. 8c). Notably, the percentage of Ti4c and Ti5c in the {201} facet is the largest among the facets mentioned above, and the {101} facet exhibits a higher density of unsaturated Ti4c and Ti5c as compared to the {210} facets. Theoretical investigations demonstrated that the surface formation energy of these facets adheres to the following subsequence: 0.62 J m−2 for {001} < 0.70 J m−2 for {210} < 0.87 J m−2 for {101}.38 Even though the surface energy of {201} has not been disclosed before, we believe that the {201} facet could possess a much higher energy than the {101} facet in view of the presence of more cus atoms in it. Fig. 8d illustrates the TiO6 octahedron (Ti6c) with the Ti atom at the centre. Notably, all the six Ti–O bonds are different in the case of brookite, which is much different from other polymorphs such as anatase and rutile.38
 Fig. 8  Ball-and-stick facet models of brookite TiO2: (a) {210} facet, (b) {201} facet, and (c) {101} facet; O atoms are marked red and Ti atoms are marked blue. (d) The coordination of the Ti atom located at the centre of TiO6 octahedra in brookite; the calculated bond distances are given in Å (ref. 38) and O atoms are in red and Ti in grey. 
Moreover, in the production of H2, the existence of redox facets reveals an efficient spatial separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes between the {210} and {201} facets, which is mainly owing to the different energy levels of these facets.32,34,38 Because of a more effective electron (Fig. 7) generation and the ‘surface heterojunction’33 constructed by the redox facets, it is reasonable that the QO nanocrystals exhibited an excellent photoactivity, which was superior to those of WT and ET nanorods. In addition, the surface atomic structure also determines the performance of photocatalytic water splitting.39 As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the percentage of coordinatively unsaturated (Ti–O bond) Ti4c and Ti5c atoms in the {201} facet is the largest, while {101} planes exhibit a higher density of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c and Ti5c as compared to the {210} surfaces. This means that the reduction facets of {210} (amounting to 70%) in brookite QO nanocrystals possess more Ti–O bonds and expose more oxygen atoms than the oxidation facets of {201} and {210}. Eventually, brookite QO nanocrystals exposed with redox facets containing both favorable surface atomic and electronic structures can orient the deposition of noble metals, leading to outstanding activities towards hydrogen evolution and pollutant elimination. This finding may be useful to design and construct novel and highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and environmental applications.
4. Conclusions
Brookite TiO2 with quasi-octahedral, ellipsoid-tipped and wedge-tipped nanorods have been synthesized through tailored water-soluble precursors under hydrothermal conditions. The as-obtained brookite quasi-octahedra nanocrystals with redox facets show the highest concentration of photogenerated ˙OH and photocatalytic performances for water splitting and MO elimination. These advantages come from the unsaturated coordinative Ti and O atoms in the redox planes, which lower the charge transfer resistance, reduce the charge recombination, and improve the photocatalytic activity. The low photoactivities of ellipsoid-tipped brookite TiO2 nanorods are ascribed to the SO42− adsorbed on the surface that result in lots of defects, thus retarding the separation of photogenerated carriers. All these observations demonstrate that redox facets are significant in improving photocatalytic activity. The precursor-directed synthetic route demonstrated here can be a promising strategy to construct low-cost and high efficiency metastable and/or functional inorganic nanomaterials with specific facets exposed for environment and energy applications.
