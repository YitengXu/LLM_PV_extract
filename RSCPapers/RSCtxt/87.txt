1. Introduction
Nowadays the realization of the sustainable development of green energy and environmental protection is still a great challenge.1–4 The large consumption of fast depleting fossil fuels such as petrol, natural gas and coal to satisfy the energy needs of the growing population is alarming and signals to researchers to develop alternative energy sources. Therefore, a new energy production system and an advanced energy storage system need to be established to meet the requirements of continuous energy supply.1 There are several advanced technologies for both clean energy conversion (e.g. fuel and solar cells, water electrolysis, etc.) and storage (batteries, supercapacitors, etc.). These devices are the central constituents for a sustainable energy usage infrastructure and have been widely studied both at lab and industrial scales. The efficiency of all these devices mainly depends on their electrode materials, thus currently intensive research has been carried out to improve their working capabilities by developing new electrode materials.
The structure and morphology of a catalyst have significant influence on its catalytic activity, thus by tuning the electronic structure or surface chemistry, the catalytic activity of the catalyst can be changed extensively. For example, reducing the particle size to nanoscale often results in a higher surface to volume ratio than the bulk counterpart.5,6 For catalysis that occurs on the surface of catalyst, this increased surface to volume ratio is highly favourable by bringing an increased density of active sites on the surface. Similarly, surface complexity also plays important role in determining catalyst activity e.g. morphologies with complex surface structures enable more exposed active sites at tangles and edges on the surface compared with those having simple smooth surfaces.7,8 This phenomenon is very prominent in layered materials like MoS2, for which active sites are mostly linked at the edges while basal planes are catalytically inert.9,10 Therefore, fabrication of nanostructures with appropriate size distributions and well-defined morphology is of significant importance for optimizing the active edge density for high catalytic performance of MoS2.11
Recently, nanostructured MoS2 has received tremendous attention because of its vast applications in various fields such as heterogeneous catalysis,12,13 electrochemical hydrogen generation,14–17 batteries and photocatalysis.18 Its layered structure makes MoS2 an ideal material for energy conversion and storage applications that can further be improved by controlling the number of layers, edge morphologies, the degree of crystallinity and doping of heteroatoms.19 Critical innovations are highly important for engineering the nanostructures of MoS2i.e. different dimensional morphologies and the corresponding fabrication methods such as chemical20–23 and mechanical exfoliation,24 chemical vapor deposition,25,26 and solvothermal27 and hydrothermal methods.28–30 The dimensionality evolution of MoS2 continues from simple 0D to complex 3D morphologies, bringing extraordinary high surface areas and exposing more tangles and edges that contain larger numbers of active sites. Hence, a systematic analysis and deep knowledge of nanostructured MoS2 with different dimensional morphologies are vital to understand active site-interrelated catalysis that will help to fabricate highly efficient catalysts for future energy systems.
There are several review articles about transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and 2D materials, which briefly describe MoS2. But to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive detailed work about the fabrication of MoS2 nanostructures with different morphologies and their applications especially in the field of electrochemistry (e.g. hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER), oxygen evaluation reaction (OER), oxygen oxidation reaction (ORR), supercapacitors) is missing. In this review article we will summarize various methods to fabricate nanostructured MoS2 with different dimensional morphologies and explain the possible solution to the challenges faced by these technologies. Then we will highlight the advantages of nanostructured MoS2 and discuss its applications in several energy production and storage systems, especially in ORR, OER, HER, and photocatalytic hydrogen generation and supercapacitors etc. Finally at the end, the conclusions on current research achievement, solutions to associated challenges and future research directions aiming to inspire more exciting studies in the near future will be discussed.
2. Electronic and physicochemical properties of nanostructured MoS2
MoS2 is a typical two-dimensional layered material and possesses a sandwich-like S–Mo–S structure which stacks together via weak van der Waals interactions in a hexagonal arrangement to form the bulk material.12,31 The existence of weak van der Waals forces among the layers provides an opportunity to manipulate the structure of MoS2 to tune its properties. The weak coupling among the layers in contrast with the strong inner layer covalent bonds enables prominent anisotropic properties that can be engineered to tune the electronic structure of MoS2 with specific utilization. Nanostructured MoS2 possesses a unique electronic structure and distinctive chemical and physical properties compared to its bulk counterpart. For example, bulk MoS2 is a typical semiconductor with an indirect band gap of about 1.2 eV,12 but the single layer MoS2 exhibits band gap transformation from indirect to direct owing to the quantum confinement effect in the d-electron system.
Nanostructured MoS2 possesses exceptional electronic and physical features that play pivotal roles in efficient energy production and storage systems including photocatalytic and electrochemical hydrogen production. Nanostructured MoS2 with low dimensionality (e.g., zero-dimension (0D), 1D) and fine thickness renders exceptional luminescence and high electron and hole separation efficiency due to a quantum confinement effect.32,33 A further nanoscale analysis of monolayer MoS2 exhibits a theoretical Bohr radius value of 0.93 nm that is much higher than the interlayer distance (0.62 nm) of MoS2.6
Nanostructured MoS2 exhibits smaller particle sizes and increased specific surface area as compared with their bulk material counterparts. Considering the application of MoS2 in electrochemical catalysis and photocatalysis, nanostructured MoS2, rather than their bulk counterparts, show intriguing potential for better catalytic activity. By tuning their structures and tailoring their surface chemistry, MoS2 based materials undergo a significant change in electronic and physicochemical properties, such as the transformation of band gaps from indirect to direct and increased conductivity from phase change (2H-phase to 1T-phase).34 Nanostructured MoS2 possesses sufficient contact between the electrode material and electrolyte in electrochemical hydrogen/oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction and supercapacitors. As the particle size and layer thickness induce into nanoscale, nanostructured MoS2 will expose more edge sites which are highly linked with the catalytic activity, and these electronic and physicochemical changes enable fast electron transfer and better conductivity.
3. Nanostructural design and fabrication of MoS2
Designing of MoS2 on a nanoscale will alter its optical, mechanical and electronic properties compared with its bulk counterpart since the size of the object has significant influence over catalytic performance. Such alteration of its electronic structures and morphologies can expand the application spectrum of MoS2 in various fields ranging from energy conversion and storage and chemical transformation to chemical and biological sensing etc. Realization of these promising utilizations requires appropriate designing and fabrication of nanostructured MoS2. The most significant and effective way is to synthesize the nanostructures of MoS2 in 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D networks or complex hierarchical nanostructures assembled using the aforementioned building blocks. The fabrications of well-defined nanostructured MoS2 give the advantage of enriched basal edges, which are highly linked with the number of active sites.35–38 Hence, it is of significant importance to fabricate nanostructures of MoS2 with homogeneously distributed edge sites to inhibit the restacking of MoS2 layers.
In order to improve the catalytic performance of MoS2 based materials, there are mainly two aspects to consider: large specific area and high electrical conductivity.39 The large specific area will guarantee the amount of active edge sites and the high electrical conductivity will boost the transfer of electrons for efficient redox reaction to obtain the desired performance. The surface area of MoS2 can be increased by designing hierarchical nanostructures as these structures bring a higher surface to volume ratio that will expose maximum edge sites, resulting in a large number of redox active centers at the surface for both catalysis and ionic storage. The electrical conductivity of MoS2 can be enhanced by making hybrids with carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon black,10 CNT,51 carbon paper,52 graphene,53,54 reduced graphene oxide,55–59etc.). These hybrid formations can also increase the overall surface area for better electrode/electrolyte contact. It is also observed that a change in the phase state of MoS2 will influence conductivity as well, e.g. 1T-MoS2 with a metallic phase exhibits higher conductivity as compared with 2H-MoS2 that typically has a semiconducting phase. Besides composite formation with conductive materials, fabrication of well-defined nanostructure to increase the number of easily accessible redox sites and doping of heteroatoms in the basal planes of MoS2 are also the effective ways to increase conductivity by disturbing the density of state (DOS) of MoS2 as well as the number of redox sites at each defect point created by the doping of heteroatoms. In the following sections, we will provide an overview of the fabrication of nanostructured MoS2 with different dimensions and the corresponding designing strategies.
3.1 Zero-dimensional MoS2
By decreasing the particle size to a few nanometers, preferable properties such as higher specific surface area, more edge sites and improved luminescence efficiency make MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) a promising catalyst in the fields of both electrochemical and analytical chemistry.44,45 There are several kinds of methods to fabricate MoS2 QDs that have been summarized in Table 1 along with the average particle size and source materials for specific MoS2 QDs.

The methods for synthesis of MoS2 QDs follow two simple approaches that are top-down and bottom-up. The former utilizes exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets or bulk MoS2 powder as the precursor with the help of different solvent such as deionization water, ethanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). While the latter mostly utilizes molybdenum metal salts or molybdate as the source of Mo and organic materials containing sulfur as the S precursor to obtain MoS2 QDs. For further clarification, the top-down approach utilizes bulk MoS2 and breaks it down into small particles and thin layers, while in bottom-up synthesis, MoS2 QDs are generated from atomic or molecular species that work as building blocks for QDs.
Liquid exfoliation is one of the most fundamental strategies to fabricate the fascinating nanostructures of MoS2 and is generally carried out in two successive steps: the first one is insertion of ions into the interlayers of MoS2 and second one utilizes shear force to separate the layers of MoS2. Among various methods, the liquid exfoliation method is extensively used by various research groups to obtain zero dimensional MoS2 with good properties. Li et al. synthesized MoS2 QDs with the assistance of solvent NMP via ultrasonic exfoliation.45 Here, NMP possessing an equivalent surface energy to MoS2 can provide proper dispersion and inhibit the agglomeration of as-obtained MoS2 QDs.43 Dai et al. utilized sulfuric acid as a solvent with the assistance of ultrasonic power to exfoliate the bulk MoS2 and obtained well-defined MoS2 QDs.46 The as-obtained QDs exhibit significant fluorescence under ultraviolet irradiation with blue green color compared with bulk MoS2 as shown in Fig. 1(a). Dong et al. introduced the use of tetrabutylammonium as an inserting species to exfoliate the MoS2via ethanol ultra-sonication.60 Considering the aforementioned examples, the mechanism of liquid exfoliation can be described as first inserting ions into MoS2 interlayers and after inducing power by sonication, separating the inserted MoS2 into QDs.

However, liquid exfoliation technology is facing many challenges e.g. high power and time consumption and associated environmental concerns due to the usage of organic solvents (i.e., NMP, DMF etc.). Hence the electrochemically coupled exfoliation method is one possible solution to the aforementioned problems as it has advantages of cost effectiveness, eco-friendliness and rapidity and been studied as an alternative method to fabricate MoS2 QDs. During the electrochemical exfoliation process, bulk MoS2 is used as an anode where ions are inserted to exfoliate it resulting in the formation of MoS2 QDs. Gopalakrishnan et al. used a single-step electrochemical exfoliation method to fabricate luminescent MoS2 QDs from bulk MoS2 powder in aqueous ionic liquid solution i.e. bis-trifluoromethane sulfonamide lithium salt (LiTFSI) or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([BMIM]Cl) in a two electrode cell.40 The insertion of anions (TFSI− or Cl−) into MoS2 interlayers results small particles of MoS2 (Fig. 1(b)). The as-prepared MoS2 QDs as shown in Fig. 1(c)–(f) possess small particle size distribution and clear lattice fringes. By varying the voltage and concentration of the electrolyte, the morphology and particle size distribution can easily be controlled during the synthesis of MoS2 QDs. Besides using MoS2 directly as an electrode to obtain QDs, Li et al. synthesized MoS2 QDs via an electrochemically induced Fenton reaction in which the MoS2 nanosheets are dispersed in the aqueous electrolyte and reacted with the electro-generated hydroxyl radicals to produce MoS2 QDs as shown in Fig. 1(g).42
Solvo and hydrothermal methods are effective, facile and simple ways to fabricate MoS2 QDs and have been utilized extensively. Gao et al. synthesized MoS2 QDs via a one-pot solvothermal method using Na2MoO4 and thiocarbamide as the corresponding precursors of Mo and S, respectively.47 During the fabrication process, graphene oxide (GO) and commercial TiO2 are utilized for hybrid fabrication of MoS2 QDs–graphene–TiO2, which exhibits improved photocatalytic activity. It's worth mentioning that the functional groups on GO have a significant influence on the formation of MoS2 QDs because they serve as nucleation centers and also prevent MoS2 QDs from aggregation, hence the obtained MoS2 QDs possess better separation of photogenerated electrons (Fig. 1(h)). Ren et al. synthesized MoS2 QDs through a hydrothermal route using sodium molybdate and dibenzyl disulfides as Mo and S sources, respectively.50 They demonstrated that MoS2 with a few-layer nanostructure via proper designing possesses improved conductivity and enriched highly exposed active sites at the edges. These enhanced properties of MoS2 QDs compared with its bulk counterpart are favorable for excellent electrocatalytic performance. Clark et al. have reported an extension to hydrothermal fabrication of MoS2 QDs by designing hybrids of ZnS–MoS2 QDs to enhance the photoluminescence properties of hybrid and opened up ways to decorate metal chalcogenides on MoS2 for various applications.61 Xu et al. explored several different solvents (e.g. DMF, NMP, dimethyl-imidazolidinone (DMEU)) to exfoliate bulk MoS2 during solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 QDs,62 which proved to be good solvents for efficient top-down preparation of MoS2 as well as prevent its agglomeration.
3.2 One-dimensional MoS2
Nanostructured MoS2 with rod-, wire- or tube-like morphology has demonstrated good performance for energy conversion and storage devices as the 1D structure offers fast electronic movement and can shorten the ionic diffusion distance. Mostly the growth of the1D nanostructures of MoS2 is a template-assisted process, thus requiring a soft or hard template like organic polymers, surfactant solutions or/and metal belts in the reaction system.63,64 Wang et al. fabricated Ni3S2@MoS2 core–shell nanofibers on graphene coated 3D Ni foam via a hydrothermal method with the help of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Fig. 2(a)).19 During the fabrication process, the addition of PVP is of great importance for the desired core–shell nanofiber structure, since the individual PVP polymer chains can interact with each other and self-assemble into polymer fibers. These transformed fibers can act as a soft template to control the tubular structure.65

It was observed that the change in reaction time has a great impact on the growth of the core–shell 1D nanostructures as shown in Fig. 2(b)–(h). With the increasing reaction time randomly grown MoS2 nanosheets on Ni3S2 (5 h) start wrapping around Ni3S2 (8 h) and further increase to 12 h results in highly fascinating Ni3S2@MoS2 coaxial nanofibers with an extremely complex surface which provides large ionic storage for sodium ion batteries. In another work, MoS2 nanotubes comprised of MoS2 nanosheets have been synthesized (Fig. 2(i)).63 These hierarchical MoS2 tubular structures exhibit a high surface curvature that results in a large amount of exposed edge sites and high surface area, thus leading to fascinating electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.
Shi et al. utilized octylamine for performing the fabrication of MoS2–C nanotubes as shown in Fig. 2(j)–(l).66 During the solvothermal process, octylamine capped outside Mo and S, forming octylamine containing MoS2 finally resulting in MoS2:C inter-over-lapped nanosheets after carbonizing of the capping molecules (Fig. 2(m)). The insertion of C into MoS2 interlayers causes an enlarged inter-layer distance (0.98 nm) as compared with pristine MoS2 nanosheets (0.62 nm), which provides a larger space for enhanced accommodation of ions. Such functionalized MoS2 nanosheets that assembled into a tube-like morphology bring improved performance for ionic batteries as they have a larger space for ionic storage and highly conductive carbon acts as a highway for faster electronic movement.
3.3 Two-dimensional MoS2
2D designed nanostructured MoS2 in the form of nanosheets is the most commonly used morphology as it offers easy manipulation of electronic and compositional tuning. Highly crystalline pristine MoS2 nanosheets have poor activity due to the inert nature of basal planes and limited number of edge sites. The number of edge sites and the activity of basal planes can be modified by inducing defects into the basal plane. Xie et al. highlighted a scalable method to make defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets.67 It is found that by adjusting the molar ratio of hexaammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) and thiourea in a hydrothermal reaction, defect-rich and defect-free MoS2 nanosheets could be assembled as shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). Note that the excess of thiourea is essential for the fabrication of defect-rich MoS2 because it serves both as a reductant as well as an additive to stabilize ultrathin nanosheets. Moreover the existence of excessive thiourea inhibits the growth of MoS2 (002) and basal planes (Fig. 3(d) and (e)), which correspondingly increases the edge sites in the basal plane. The much thinner and defect-rich nanosheets possess more exposed edge sites that are favorable for active catalysis. Ye et al. fabricated two kinds of defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets through oxygen plasma and hydrogen annealing treatment and successfully introduced cracks and voids in MoS2 basal planes (Fig. 3(f) and (i)).25 Although their performance is still not excellent, compared with their untreated counterpart the defective MoS2 nanosheets possess an increased density of active sites and exhibit lower onset potential (300 mV) and Tafel slope value (147 mV dec−1) (see in Fig. 3(g)–(k)).

Here, we will outline two main strategies to prepare highly active MoS2 nanosheets for various applications: (i) fabricating hybrid structures of MoS2 with other conductive materials (carbonaceous or inorganic structures) and (ii) tuning the electronic structure through introduction of heteroatoms (metallic or non-metallic) in the basal planes of MoS2 nanosheets. To tackle the issue of the low conductivity of MoS2, carbon with excellent electrical conductivity can be employed to make hybrid structures which provide better catalytic activity for electrochemical hydrogen evolution and ionic storage in batteries. Xie et al. synthesized MoS2 nanosheets vertically aligned on carbon fibers via a hydrothermal method as given in Fig. 4(a) and (b).68 The obtained MoS2 nanosheets exhibit a charge capacity of 286 mA h g−1 at 160 mA g−1 for sodium ion batteries, an improved result compared with the one without MoS2 (172 mA h g−1) (Fig. 4(c)).

The utilization of carbon paper for dispersing MoS2 nanosheets could compensate the intrinsic low conductivity, thus improving the electrochemical performance Yu et al. synthesized MoS2 hybrid structures by decorating MoS2 nanosheets on N-doped hollow carbon nanoboxes via a hydrothermal method as illustrated in Fig. 4(d) and (e).69 The N-doped carbon backbone could improve electronic conductivity and the hollow structure could bring higher ionic diffusivity. As a result, the hybrids possess higher current density (40 mA cm−2) compared with bare MoS2 nanosheets (10 mA cm−2) at an overpotential of 200 mV for HER catalysis (Fig. 4(f) and (g)).
It is worth mentioning that the usage of carbon materials not only improves integral conductivity but also provides a way to fabricate binder free electrodes. The as-prepared MoS2 nanosheets on carbon cloth could be directly used as electrodes for electrochemical tests, thus preventing the utilization of polymer binders. This could minimize the inactive volume and lower the contents of non-conductive species in electrode films. Zhang et al. fabricated 3D vertical graphene on carbon cloth and used it as substrate to grow MoS2 nanosheets through a hydrothermal method.70 The obtained MoS2 composites exhibit onset potential as low as 50 mV (vs. RHE) and overpotential of only 78 mV (vs. RHE) at −10 mA cm−2 for HER, which is among the best results for MoS2 based materials. Similar to the carbon material induced MoS2, many other TMD materials have also shown improved electrochemical conductivity and better electrons transfer rates, e.g. MoSe2–rGO,71 WS2–rGO72etc.
The catalytic activity of MoS2 could be improved by increasing the specific surface area and exposing more active sites at the edge. In this regard, Zhang et al. synthesized MoS2 hierarchical nanosheets by vertically decorating them on a freestanding carbon nitride substrate by calcining the mixture of melamine and (NH4)2MoS4.7 The polymerization of melamine into carbon nitride could direct the horizontal growth of MoS2 nanosheets and also provides a large area for as-prepared catalysts. Beyond hybrid fabrication, doping of non-metallic elements e.g. nitrogen could modify the chemical and physical properties of MoS2 nanosheets and could also enhance conductivity and catalytic activities at the same time. Qin et al. carried out in situ doping of nitrogen to MoS2 nanosheets by heating powders of molybdenum chloride and thiourea in a tube furnace73 and the resulting MoS2 hybrids possess better electrical conductivity and improved performance by delivering a specific capacity of 998.0 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 100 cycles as the anode of Li-ion batteries.
3.4 Three-dimensional MoS2
Presently, the tuning of MoS2 properties by changing its dimensions at the nanoscale is receiving much attention. Typically, 3D MoS2 nanostructures e.g. nanospheres, nanocages, nanoclusters exhibit high values of both the surface to volume ratio and the specific surface area. Many properties are dependent on this particle size transformation, especially the number of active edge sites, which is highly correlated with the catalytic activity of MoS2. Hence analysis of strategies for fabricating active 3D nanostructures of MoS2 is essential for understanding the relationship between physicochemical properties and performance of MoS2 that will further be inspiring for effective synthesis of catalytically more active MoS2. Zuo et al. synthesized hollow MoS2 nanocages via solution-phase reduction of (NH4)2MoS2.74 The in situ evolved NH3 gases act as a bubble template for the formation of hollow MoSx as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The as-synthesized MoSx transformed into well-defined MoS2 nanocages with a wall thickness of 15 nm (Fig. 5(b) and (c)) after ex situ thermal annealing for recrystallizing. Similar to the above mechanism, Yu et al. fabricated hollow structures (prism, sphere, polyhedron) of M–MoS3 (M = Co, Ni) ternary sulfides via a simple precipitation process of M precursors and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ((NH4)2MoS4) (Fig. 5(d)).75 Cobalt or nickel precursors with corresponding structures guide the formation of specific hollow structure and act both as a source of transition metal elements and a template. This protocol is versatile for yielding a series of M–MoS3 with different 3D hollow structures as shown in Fig. 5(e)–(h).

Mo–S based molecules and clusters provide the maximum exposure of edge density and hence result in better catalytic activity. Kibsgaard and co-workers synthesized a MoS2 analogue trimer [Mo3S13]2− nanocluster; in these nanoclusters most sulfur atoms exhibit active sites towards HER (Fig. 5(i)).76 The clusters of thiomolybdate [Mo3S13]2− exhibit a better HER turnover frequency (TOF) with small onset overpotentials of 0.10–0.12 V (vs. RHE) and 0.18–0.22 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 than other molybdenum sulfides fabricated by wet-chemistry.76 Huang et al. fabricated dimeric [Mo2S12]2− clusters besides [Mo3S13]2−, and the as-prepared dimeric [Mo2S12]2− clusters have a low overpotential of 161 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm−2 and small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec−1. In particular, the hydrogen adsorption energy of [Mo2S12]2− clusters (−0.05 eV) is much lower than Pt(111) (−0.09 eV), which contributes to the superior HER activity.10
Besides the aforementioned nanostructured MoS2, many researchers have also studied other traditional metal dichalcogenide nanostructures, e.g. David Lou's group has reported a series of novel 3D nanostructures like MoS2 hollow nanospheres,77 Ni–Co–MoS2 nanoboxes,78 CoS2 nanobubble,79 metal doped Co3S4 hollow tubular with Ni, Mn, Zn80etc. These novel hierarchical 3D nanostructured TMDs exhibit good activity and show intriguing potential in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.
4. Applications of MoS2 nanostructures
The easy manipulation of morphology, variety of structures and room for electronic modifications make MoS2 very attractive for a large number of applications. Here, we will highlight the applications of MoS2 nanostructures in electrochemical energy conversion and storage such as ORR, HER, OER, supercapacitors and photocatalytic hydrogen evolutions.
4.1 Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
Oxygen reduction is the main constituent in the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy in fuel cells and storage of electrical energy as chemical bonds in metal–air batteries. The catalysts’ activity towards ORR can be judged mainly based on four parameters: (1) peak potential; (2) onset potential; (3) half-wave potential; and (4) the electron transfer number (n) during the reduction process.81
In Table 2 we have summarized the possible reactions in alkaline aqueous solution for ORR, from where it can be seen that the 4e− pathway exhibits higher efficiency and the intermediates are less hazardous than the 2e− process. The mild reaction process of the 4e− pathway is also important for the long cycling duration of the equipment. In this regard, a catalyst that can catalyze the oxygen reduction by transferring 4e− is designated an efficient and promising candidate. Nanostructured MoS2 has been widely studied to catalyze ORR with significant activity (Table 3) and it has been demonstrated that the exposed Mo atoms are the active sites that contribute towards the catalysis process.82

Doping of foreign elements in nanostructured MoS2 basal planes could modulate the electronic properties and thus tune its catalytic activity. Huang et al. induced low-electronegative phosphorus83 and oxygen84 heteroatoms into the basal planes of MoS2, which exhibits good ORR activity. Further, C3N4 was used as a support matrix to provide a large area due to its porous structure that increased the electrolyte/electrode contact area as well as increased the conductivity. These modulated MoS2 hybrids have a good selectivity of 4e− pathway and bear positive onset potentials of 0.96 V for P-doped MoS2 nanosheets and 0.94 V for O-incorporated MoS2vs. RHE.
Wang et al. studied MoS2 particle size influence on electrocatalytic oxygen reduction by preparing bulk MoS2 into ultra small nanoparticles with the aid of N,N-dimethylformamide.82 Smaller sized particles will expose more Mo active sites on the surface because of increased surface to volume ratios. Their results show that the obtained MoS2 nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent ORR activity and the catalytic activity increases with the decreasing particle size, while 2 nm particles show the best activity for ORR and follow the 4e− pathway. Furthermore, the Mo active sites in oxygen evolution catalysis are demonstrated by covering the particle surface with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which blocks the Mo edges. After treatment with EDTA the typical reduction peaks of MoS2 nanoparticles disappear in the CV curve for ORR performance. This change in electrochemical performance indicates that the Mo edge sites contribute to catalytic activity.
Combining highly conductive materials (like graphene) with MoS2 could compensate for the poor conductivity of MoS2 and improve its electrocatalytic performance. Du et al. synthesized MoS2 nanodots on porous nitrogen-doped graphene via in situ pyrolysis reaction.85N-Acetyl-L-cysteine was used as the capping agent since it can prevent the obtained MoS2 from aggregation and can be removed easily to expose the active sites. Compared with bare MoS2, the hybrid of MoS2 nanodots with N-graphene exhibits a 200 mV positive shift at onset potential towards ORR. Illathvalappil et al. fabricated Co(OH)2 decorated MoS2 nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide via a one step hydrothermal method.86 The as-prepared Co(OH)2–MoS2/rGO hybrids significantly improve the onset potential with 0.855 V (vs. RHE), a nearly 147 mV positive shift as compared with the pristine MoS2. Furthermore, ORR catalysed by other layered TMDs such as MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 exhibit similar but less significant electrochemical performance than nanostructured MoS2.93
4.2 Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
Nanostructured MoS2 is known as a geologically abundant semiconductor and a robust and efficient alternative catalyst for HER.27 Both theoretical and experimental studies have revealed that the active sites for efficient HER activity corresponds to S atoms at the edges (i.e. S edge sites).10,11 However, as bulk MoS2 is comprised of stacked MoS2 monolayers with low levels of exposed active edge sites, it suffers from poor catalytic activity towards HER. Therefore, fabricating nanostructured MoS2 with a large amount of active sites, high catalytic activity of each site and efficient contact between the active sites and electrolyte are key points in optimizing hydrogen evolution activity.94
There are three possible steps (Table 4) in the HER process and for every specific catalyst it may follow the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism or the Volmer–Tafel mechanism.95 Both of these mechanisms involve the adsorption of hydrogen ions on the surface of electrode, thus a catalyst with a free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) close to zero is favorable as both too low or high values affect the effective adsorption step and the following desorption. Increasing the amount of active sites of MoS2 can significantly improve HER performance. The comparative HER performances have been summarized in Table 5, where the overpotential at −10 mA cm−2 is taken as the basic parameter for comparative performance and it is found that MoS2 based materials exhibit overpotentials of around 200 mV, some even less than 100 mV. Gao and coworkers synthesized a MoS2/CoSe2 hybrid with superior HER activity; the overpotential at −10 mA cm−2 is as low as 68 mV (vs. RHE) and there is small Tafel slope of 36 mV dec−1,27 which is the best result among non-noble metal based materials for HER catalysts (Table 5). The addition of CoSe2 nanobelts can mediate the growth of MoS2 to form more exposed terminal S22− sites, which is demonstrated to be catalytically active for improved HER performance.

As aforementioned, a combination of MoS2 with conductive materials could improve electrocatalytic activity significantly. Yang et al. synthesized MoS2 nanosheets supported on porous metallic MoO2via a hydrothermal method, which possess one-dimensional channel-like structures and exhibit high conductivity (Fig. 6).96 The decoration of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of MoO2 brings improved electrochemical hydrogen evolution activity with a small Tafel slope of 76.1 mV dec−1 and onset potential of −104 mV (vs. RHE), almost 100 mV lower than the bare MoS2. Generally, the basal plane of MoS2 is thought to be catalytic inert for hydrogen evolution due to the lack of active edge sites. Besides, semiconductor 2H-phase MoS2 also hinders its fast electron transfer through the reaction. However, by tuning the interaction between MoS2 and the substrate, charge transfer kinetics could be improved. Voiry et al. studied the electronic coupling between MoS2 and the substrate and concluded that the catalytic activity of 2H-phase MoS2 could be improved, compared to the metallic 1T-phase via proper contact with the substrate.97 By lowering the resistance between MoS2 and the substrate, electrons could be injected into MoS2 from the support sufficiently and efficiently hence improving integral hydrogen evolution performance.

Similarly, Yi Xie's group studied the phase transformation of other TMD materials during the fabrication process, e.g. V-doped semimetallic MoS2,98 CoS2,99 and VS2100 in energy conversion and storage utilization. These TMD materials are typical semiconductors, thus hindering efficient electron transfer during electrochemical and photocatalytic catalysis, and the phase change from semiconductor to semimetallic or even metallic state will highly increase the conductivity of the integral materials.
Other typical TMDs such as WS2, WSe2 and MoSe2 have also aroused much interest in electrochemical hydrogen evolution due to their intriguing catalytic activity and high abundance as compared with Pt based materials, which exhibit excellent performance but still suffer from high cost. Jaramillo's group has made many inroads in exploring new electrode materials that exhibit low onset overpotential and high current density in HER. They studied a large amount of materials for electrochemical catalysis in both HER and OER and made several benchmarks for quick analysis of material performance.101,102
4.3 Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
OER is the process to generate O2 through oxidation of H2O, which is a typical half reaction during the water splitting117 and charging process of rechargeable metal–air batteries.118 The chemisorptions and dissociation of OH− followed by generation of oxygen-containing and hydrogen intermediates are the main factors that determine the oxidation of water,119 while up till now only the chemisorptions part has been considered for advanced OER electrocatalysts.120–122 Furthermore, molybdenum disulfide nanostructures have been analyzed comprehensively both by experimental methods and DFT calculations for hydrogen evolution,9,52 but very limited efforts have been devoted to OER. The tuning of the undercoordinated metal sites on the surface of MoS2 may result in good performance of the catalyst of OER. These sites are considered vital for water oxidation especially transition-metal (Fe, Co and Ni) based sulfides,123 metal oxide materials,124 Ni based hydroxides,125 and Co based phosphates.126 MoS2 for OER with reasonable activity and stability in alkalines has not been much reported. It appears that application for hydrogen evolution dominates a large part of MoS2 utilizations, since theoretical studies for OER to thoroughly understand the mechanisms of MoS2 activities are still in their infancy.
Zhang and co-workers fabricated MoS2 and Ni3S2 interface heterostructures on nickel foam with highly efficient OER.114 MoS2 nanosheets are fabricated as the outer coat on Ni3S2 nanoparticles, which directly grow from the nickel foam in hydrothermal reaction with the existence of a sulfur source. The hybrids exhibit an overpotential of 218 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH, much better than that of bare Ni3S2 and MoS2. Moreover, the obtained MoS2 hybrids are tested in an alkaline electrolyzer for water splitting and the cell voltage at 10 mA cm−2 is as low as 1.56 V. Their DFT results show that the in situ formation of interfaces between NiO and MoS2 as well as Ni3S2 and MoS2 give the optimum chemisorptions of H on MoS2 as well as HO on nickel sulfide and nickel oxide, which result in improved OER and HER activity. Further, Yan et al. demonstrated that conductive Ni foam with high surface area provides good contact with MoS2 microspheres and thus these hybrids show high current density and reduced overpotential towards OER.127 The OER activities of the as-prepared MoS2 in 1 M KOH at 20 mA cm−2 occurred at an overpotential of 310 mV (vs. RHE).
4.4 Supercapacitors
Supercapacitors are potential energy storage devices with high power density and excellent rate capability.128–131 The energy density (E) of supercapacitor is determined by using the equation E = 1/2CV2,52,132–136 therefore to increase E it is desirable to enhance the specific capacitance (C) of electrode materials and increase the voltage windows (V). Supercapacitors mainly follow two charge storage mechanisms.137,138 One is charge separation at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode (electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs)), while the other one occurring via redox reactions undergoes a Faradaic process (pseudocapacitors). Due to the high density of charge storage through the redox process, pseudocapacitors bear higher specific capacitance than EDLCs. The layered structure of MoS2 offers enormous opportunities to tune the morphology, structure and surface chemistry that make it very attractive in the field of energy storage especially for batteries and supercapacitors.139 MoS2 has the potential to exhibit high capacitance due to its dual electrochemical charge storage ability rendered by the double-layer within its layered structure as well as the Faradaic process occurring at the dangling edge structure and defects on its surface as illustrated in Table 6. Mo elements have a wide range of oxidation states from +2 to +6 and have the ability to participate in redox reaction.140–142 Continuous redox reactions eliminate dead time, which is the main concern of metallic oxides, sulfides and hydroxides in their application for supercapacitors.

Both the charge separation efficiency and redox reaction activity are based on the available active surface area and the surface chemistry. Hence improving the active surface area of MoS2 by tuning the surface topology or chemistry can significantly increase its specific capacitance when used as an electrode for supercapacitors. Further increasing the specific surface area and electrical conductivity of MoS2 and combining it with other redox-active materials could enhance its performance with a high value of pseudocapacitance.148 Wang et al. fabricated flower-like MoS2 nanospheres through a two-step hydrothermal method using as-prepared MoO3 nanorods as sacrificial precursors,138 and converted them to MoS2 by sulfidation reaction. The as-prepared MoS2 nanospheres possess EDLCs behavior as there is no peak found in their CV curves and deliver a capacitance of 168 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is the best value among the other reported values of pure MoS2 (comparison is presented in Table 6).152–154 Even though good results for bare MoS2 have been achieved in this work, its usage as an electrode for supercapacitors is still limited due to its low conductivity and inefficient surface interaction with ions of the electrolyte.138,141 Further, Pandey et al. have investigated the effect of electrolyte nature on the electrochemical capacitance of MoS2 by testing its performance in both aqueous and ionic liquid media. It is found that MoS2 delivers higher specific capacitance in ionic liquids than in aqueous electrolytes within the entire range of scan rates due to the ease of ionic hopping in ionic liquid medium.143
Increasing the surface area of MoS2 or making its hybrid nanostructures with conductive materials or combining both of these two factors could significantly improve the performance of MoS2. This improved activity is due to good ion intercalation and fast transport of electrons. Leite's group synthesized MoS2/reduced graphene oxide hybrids with MoS2 layers covalently bonded on the surface of rGO.140 At low concentration of MoS2, only small islands of MoS2 grow on rGO while restacking of MoS2 nanosheets is observed through van der Waals interactions with folded edges on increasing the amount of MoS2 as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). This increased amount of MoS2 results in the transformation of the electrochemical storage mechanism from that of EDLCs to the Faradaic process. Thus, by changing the amount of MoS2 loaded, it is possible to tune the electrochemical supercapacitive behavior of the MoS2/rGO hybrids. When the amount of MoS2 is low (i.e., LCMoS2/rGO), the hybrids undergo a typical double-layer process and exhibit a specific capacitance of 1558 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 7(b). As the amount of MoS2 increases (i.e., MCMoS2/rGO and HCMoS2/rGO), significant redox processes deriving from Mo(IV), Mo(V) and Mo(VI) contribute to the total capacitance (Fig. 7(c)). It is noticed that too high a concentration of MoS2 in MoS2/rGO hybrids also hinders activity as it increases the amount of stacked MoS2 on rGO, which in some way blocks the active sites and slows down the ionic and electronic movements, resulting in poor capacitive performance.

Zhu et al. fabricated polyaniline (PANI) nanoneedle arrays on exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets as shown in Fig. 8(a).148 PANI nanoarrays vertically standing on MoS2 nanosheets help to hold more ions than pure MoS2 and also offer a fast pathway for electrons as illustrated in Fig. 8(b). The resulting MoS2@PANI architectures render a specific capacitance of 853 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and undergo a typical pseudocapacitive behavior (Fig. 8(c)). Zhang et al. fabricated amorphous MoS2 nanospheres via a simple hydrothermal method.142 The specific capacitance of amorphous MoS2 is 1440.9 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, which is 1.6 times higher than that of crystalline MoS2. The high specific capacitance is attributed much to the disordered structures, which may offer more active sites and transportation channels for ions.

The solid-state supercapacitor is considered an excellent alternative to its liquid counterpart for the reason that it can prevent liquid leakage and also enable long life cycles.155 These advantages make it fascinating for the application of wearable electronics.156 Nevertheless the obstacles hindering its activity lie in how to combine the high specific capacitance with flexibility, conductivity and high density of energy. As for MoS2 applied for solid-state supercapacitors, much headway has been made in making hybrids to compensate poor conductivity with high performance. Li et al. synthesized a novel Ti/TiO2/MoS2 coaxial fiber structure which can be directly used in a planar format for supercapacitors.146 The as-obtained hybrids exhibit a specific capacitance of 230.2 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 8(d). Furthermore, these solid state hybrid fibers can be applied in self-powered photodetection systems (in Fig. 8(e)) as the energy storage part due to their steady energy storage performance. Hao et al. synthesized MoS2 nanosheets for flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors by incorporating Ni(OH)2.157 The insertion of Ni(OH)2 is able to weaken the restacking of MoS2 layers, which is of significant importance for efficient ion-accessible surfaces and high capacitance.158 Though not as widely studied as MoS2, other TMD materials like MoSe2 also show potential for utilization as electrodes for supercapacitors.159,160 MoSe2 with a similar sandwich structure as that of MoS2 exhibits comparative capacitance and rate capability.
4.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolutions
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is one of the most fascinating methods to store solar energy as chemical energy that can be used as fuel energy.161,162 As a result of sluggish hydrogen production efficiency on bare semiconductors alone, most of the photocatalysts consist of a co-catalyst in order to realize a high hydrogen evolution rate via solar irradiation.163–165 The ultimate steps in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution lie in the effective separation of charge carriers (i.e. quantum yield) and the reaction kinetics at the interface of catalysts.166 Noble metals are effective co-catalysts to improve the quantum yield but suffer from limited earth abundance and high price. Hence, non-noble metals with considerable photocatalytic activity have been viewed as good alternatives among which MoS2 has been manifested to be a potential co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with significantly improved activity.167–169 Li et al. synthesized an MoS2 monolayer combined with Bi12O17Cl2 monolayers which give a much improved visible light-induced hydrogen evolution rate with 33 mmol h−1 g−1.170
Resistance along the basal plane of MoS2 is much smaller than that through the layers94,171 and the edges of MoS2 are more active than the plane towards hydrogen evolution,9,10,94,109 hence fabricating MoS2 with the edges connected to the main catalysts and active sites exposed as much as possible is highly desired for high H2 evolution activity; in this way the photo-excited electrons could be transported from the main catalyst to the co-catalyst directly along the basal plane of the MoS2, much reducing the transportation resistance. He et al. synthesized MoS2 with good control on the growth direction on TiO2 for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as presented in Fig. 9(a),166 for comparison MoS2 nanosheets grown along the basal plane were also fabricated. The obtained hybrids of MoS2 nanosheets vertically aligned on TiO2 nanorods exhibit much improved hydrogen evolution activity (4300 μmol h−1 g−1 at the load of 3 wt% MoS2) as compared with MoS2 grown along its basal plane on TiO2 nanorods (see in Fig. 9(b) and (c)). This improved performance is due to the fast electron transportation along the basal plane directly from the main catalysts as given in Fig. 9(d).

Other than tuning the growth direction of MoS2 on the substrate to expose active edge sites, the phase condition of MoS2 also influences the integrated performance extensively. The 1T metallic phase MoS2 exhibits much higher conductivity than the 2H phase MoS2 which is a typical semiconductor. Fabricating the metallic phase MoS2 as a co-catalyst is an intriguing way to improve the photocatalytic hydrogen generation rate. Bai et al. synthesized metallic MoS2 (1T phase) nanosheets as a support for photocatalytic water splitting with enhanced activity as compared with semiconducting MoS2.172 The enhanced conductivity of 1T MoS2 nanosheets provides high mobility and efficient transport of photoexcited electrons thus resulting in much improved electron–hole separation efficiency as illustrated in Fig. 9(e) and (f). Besides, amorphous MoS2 as compared with crystalline MoS2 possesses a more disordered crystal structure which enables more unsaturated S atoms. Yu et al. fabricated amorphous MoSx as an electron cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with improved activity compared to its crystalline counterpart.173
5. Conclusion and perspectives
MoS2 has aroused great interest since it was found to be catalytically active towards both electrochemical and photocatalytic procedures. The chemical composition, structure, crystal size and surface chemistry have potential influence on both electrochemical and photocatalytic activity of MoS2. Considering the aim to have a thorough understanding of MoS2, in this review article we have summarized the morphological evolution of MoS2 and discussed its different morphologies like quantum dots, 1D, 2D and 3D nanostructures and their respective fabrication methods. We have also outlined various strategies to improve the performance of MoS2 in electrochemical hydrogen and oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, supercapacitors and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, e.g. engineering the surface chemistry via introducing defects within the MoS2 monolayers, doping of heteroatoms and formation of hybrid nanostructures with conductive materials like carbonaceous matrixes, inorganic structures, organic materials, etc. as well as template guided growth of MoS2 to increase its surface area.
MoS2 as the typical transition metal disulfides (TMDs) possess a unique band gap, which gives it special properties that make it suitable for electro and photo-chemical application. But one thing should be kept in mind, which is that MoS2 still suffers from the inert nature of its basal plane that limits its activity towards catalysis. Efforts have been made to improve this aspect, however, there is still a long way to go. As existing methods to tune the electronic structure and surface chemistry modifications bring MoS2 poor stability, further advancements in effective synthesis of stable MoS2 with better chemical functionalization strategies for advanced catalysts in energy conversion and storage devices are still desired.
